[36:21] [Music]
[36:30] Amazing Grace let's pray together this
[36:34] evening we just ask that the mercies of
[36:38] the Lord be our portion or gracious
[36:40] Heavenly Father we just ask that you
[36:43] bless us this evening be with us and
[36:46] your wonderful and holy
[36:48] precious name we pray amen amen
[36:53] god bless you may be seated maybe
[36:54] somebody could run grab my mic or maybe
[36:59] I could run and grab my mind but then
[37:03] we'd have an empty an empty pulpit I
[37:08] preached a sermon about the unseen God
[37:13] now I was going to preach a sermon about
[37:16] the unseen congregation and then the
[37:20] next one would be the unseen preacher
[37:30] this is a good thing that this just
[37:35] happened and you'll see in a moment why
[37:38] we just want to continue to let you know
[37:43] you have the freedom to do all that you
[37:49] didn't feel that you need to do to
[37:53] protect yourself in any way
[37:56] we'll provide what spacing we can for
[38:01] people and wearing masks they kind of
[38:06] asked us to wear masks outside so we try
[38:10] to do that and try to do spacing inside
[38:14] they say it's optional so I say it's
[38:17] optional you can wear masks if you like
[38:21] if you don't like what I preach put a
[38:23] mask on and you can murmur all you want
[38:26] nobody'll know but so we try to do that
[38:30] and I explained the other day that
[38:34] people say well why are you conforming
[38:38] to this well let me say it this way
[38:41] the the government gives us as a church
[38:45] special benefits they don't tax us for
[38:49] our land they give special benefits to
[38:52] the ministry they they they do things
[38:55] for churches and sometimes I think to
[38:59] show that we appreciate that then we try
[39:03] to conform to the things they ask us to
[39:06] do there would be no quicker way to
[39:09] close down churches than to tax them so
[39:13] just to give you an example they
[39:15] appraise this church at about eight
[39:20] hundred and fifty thousand I'm not
[39:23] counting the property next door so if
[39:26] you took the property next door with
[39:28] this church this area would appraise for
[39:31] around a million three and the tax rate
[39:35] on that would be like eight dollars per
[39:39] thousand so we'd have about an $80,000 a
[39:43] year tax bill and and you are the best
[39:46] most generous people in the world but we
[39:51] have not risen to the occasion of eighty
[39:54] thousand dollars of the year and nor
[39:57] would I put the pressure upon you to do
[39:59] that but so anyway we're trying to do
[40:02] our best and I know that anybody can
[40:05] find little flaws here and there but in
[40:08] my heart I I abide because the scripture
[40:13] says agree with them quickly lest they
[40:15] deliver in your prison and that they're
[40:17] servants of the Lord to carry out the
[40:20] wrath of God against them that are
[40:22] disobedient on the other hand I think
[40:26] church is the safest place in the world
[40:28] to be you know because you have all
[40:32] people that are here aren't out in the
[40:34] world they're not in places where bad
[40:37] things are going they keep their
[40:39] distance from people I think it's great
[40:42] I can stay away from people and they
[40:45] just stay away from me
[40:47] it it makes it nice so we're doing those
[40:50] things for those purposes now Sunday
[40:56] evening it's it's going to be an outdoor
[41:00] setting so you know you can wear your
[41:03] mask and then like they do in a
[41:06] restaurant you wear your mask into the
[41:08] door you sit down at the table you take
[41:11] your mask on the waitress leans over you
[41:15] and put your food there and hauls the
[41:17] food all through the kitchen past
[41:19] everybody that's sitting there without
[41:21] their masks and sets it on your table
[41:25] now you're worried about that brother
[41:27] McGarrett no I pray over that food you
[41:30] know what I mean I place it into the
[41:33] hands of the Lord and and that's all we
[41:38] can do so we're not going to get a
[41:40] rebellious spirit but you know we had
[41:44] some extra seats sunday and you know
[41:47] we're not going to turn anybody away
[41:49] that comes to the house of the Lord if
[41:53] we have to put a row of chairs right
[41:54] down the middle we'll do that we want
[41:57] people to come hear the gospel and so
[42:01] there's a lot of conspiracy theories
[42:04] going on but we don't need to know what
[42:07] the conspiracy theories are we don't
[42:09] need to know what Satan's up to as long
[42:13] as we know what this is up to and if we
[42:16] know what this is up to then we can
[42:19] follow this this is our guide through
[42:23] the time this has been interpreted to us
[42:27] in the last day by a prophet messenger
[42:31] who came and was vindicated there were
[42:36] scriptural promises in the Bible behold
[42:39] I will send you Elijah the Prophet
[42:42] before the Great and dreadful day of the
[42:44] Lord that was a prophecy that was
[42:47] fulfilled in one person was in a spirit
[42:52] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[42:55] angel fulfilled in one person those are
[42:58] Pacific
[43:00] ritual prophecies that came to pass in
[43:04] the flesh all the Word of God comes to
[43:07] pass in the flesh all through the Old
[43:09] Testament they prophesied and they spoke
[43:13] of one that would come one that would be
[43:15] like this one would be like that and
[43:17] then finally that word showed up in the
[43:23] flesh
[43:23] and manifested in the flesh in the
[43:27] person called the Lord Jesus Christ and
[43:30] He fulfilled everything that was
[43:33] prophesied concerning him many of it was
[43:37] prophesied fulfilled in the last three
[43:40] or four hours of his life so just
[43:43] remember this God's Word is on time it's
[43:47] coming to pass perfectly and and there's
[43:52] a reason behind it all we might not know
[43:56] all the things that are going on but we
[43:59] know we have a vindicated word that will
[44:02] feed our souls and we can rest in
[44:05] assuredly in that this evening so we
[44:10] just like to have a little subject now
[44:12] tonight we're having communion but we're
[44:15] not having foot washing it's because of
[44:18] the seating and the arrangements it
[44:20] makes it easier without moving a lot of
[44:23] things around plus it avoids any
[44:25] uncomfortable contact so there's no
[44:29] pressure in any of this to show yourself
[44:33] spiritual you understand if you feel
[44:36] comfortable putting on a mask it doesn't
[44:38] mean you're any less spiritual than I am
[44:41] I haven't figured out how to breathe in
[44:44] a mask let alone preach so just be a
[44:48] cover so we're not anti what the
[44:51] government's doing where we're
[44:52] supporting them we're we try to wear our
[44:56] masks for the people who are in fear so
[44:59] we're not the cause of putting any fear
[45:01] upon them but may they see in our
[45:04] spirits and in art or they can't see our
[45:07] smiles but may they see in our
[45:10] atmosphere that
[45:12] we have a joy bringing in our heart amen
[45:15] so we don't want to do that so let's go
[45:18] ahead and stand and we'll open our
[45:20] Bibles and we're gonna read some
[45:27] scriptures and you'll kind of figure out
[45:29] pretty quick I think what I'm going to
[45:34] preach on but let me just draw the
[45:38] conclusion it won't be long and we'll
[45:40] move right into communion so let's turn
[45:42] in our Bibles we're going to reread for
[45:45] what we'll do is I'll read this first
[45:47] passage of Scripture then we'll be
[45:50] seated and read the rest of the
[45:52] scriptures first Timothy the first
[45:56] chapter the 16th verse is what I believe
[46:05] that I have written here and I don't
[46:12] know if that's going to be right but
[46:18] that isn't
[46:38] dealt with a little bit different let's
[46:41] go to turn over to Titus and we'll start
[46:47] at Titus 2 & 7
[47:00] Titus 2 & 7 so let's read there so in
[47:07] Titus 2 & 7 it says he's speaking there
[47:11] and he says in the fourth verse he says
[47:14] that they may teach this is a Titus the
[47:18] 2nd chapter starting with the 4th verse
[47:23] that they may teach the young women to
[47:26] be sober to love their husbands to love
[47:30] their children to be discreet chaste
[47:33] keepers at home good obedient to their
[47:38] own husband's that the word of the Lord
[47:40] be not blaspheme young men likewise
[47:44] exhort to be sober-minded in all things
[47:48] showing thyself a pattern of good works
[47:53] in doctrine showing uncorrupt in this
[47:57] gravity and sincerity in all things
[48:02] showing thyself a pattern of good works
[48:08] amen you may be seated
[48:15] and so I'm going to read a scripture
[48:20] here I think this is the one I found in
[48:23] Timothy 1 in 6 howbeit for this cause
[48:29] that you can turn there
[48:40] and the 15th verse says of first Timothy
[48:44] chapter 1 this is a faithful saying in
[48:48] other words something this is something
[48:50] we can say with confidence and it's a
[48:55] true saying it says this is a faithful
[48:57] saying and worthy of all accepted
[49:07] Jesus that Christ Jesus came into the
[49:10] world to save sinners of whom I am chief
[49:15] howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy
[49:20] that in me first Jesus Christ might show
[49:25] forth all long-suffering for a pattern
[49:30] to them which hurt here which should
[49:35] hereafter believe on him to ever lasting
[49:40] light
[49:41] so Paul saying that my my conversion and
[49:46] God allowed me to take this course
[49:49] because that would be a first thing is
[49:52] why would God allow the first church age
[49:56] messenger the Apostles to the Gentiles
[50:01] to persecute the church it makes no
[50:06] sense you wouldn't think that something
[50:11] would transpire it transpired that way
[50:15] but now Paul comes back and he says that
[50:18] this mercy was shown forth to me because
[50:23] it now laid a pattern for every believer
[50:28] that hereafter believe to know that God
[50:34] saved the cheapest of all sinners and we
[50:40] would sit back oh one that even
[50:42] persecuted the church consented unto the
[50:45] death of Stephen and that was his
[50:48] testimony he that once persecuted
[50:52] is now a part of us but Paul said that
[50:56] was laying there as a pattern so now
[51:01] what we're seeing is there was a pattern
[51:04] that was laid out for every Gentile that
[51:09] was going to come after that because the
[51:12] Gentiles that were going to come after
[51:14] that were not sanctified under the law
[51:20] so to speak as much as the law could
[51:23] give sanctification so it was it was a
[51:27] pattern so he's got the message that's
[51:32] going to go out to the Gentiles and what
[51:35] the message to those Gentiles is those
[51:38] that were that were adulterous as those
[51:41] that were drunkards though that were
[51:43] thieves those that lived in all kinds of
[51:46] manner of sins things which wouldn't
[51:48] even be mentioned in Israel without
[51:52] being stoned and Paul representing that
[51:58] spirit of the law that went out and and
[52:03] tried to purge Israel of those that
[52:07] blaspheme in the name of this one called
[52:11] Jesus so to end Paul there's a pattern
[52:15] in his life of who that he was how that
[52:20] he studied how he stunned ER studied
[52:22] under Gamaliel
[52:24] he was this great this great orator and
[52:29] zealous in the law now it
[52:34] Paul's berrykin version showed the exit
[52:40] from the law to grace so there was
[52:44] actually a pattern in Paul's life that
[52:49] of what he was trying to do so if what
[52:54] he represented what he stood for how
[52:57] that he thought he was doing it out of
[52:59] righteousness
[53:00] now his conversion and launch
[53:06] this long-suffering of God and it shows
[53:10] the pattern of conversion that God was
[53:16] going to use for everybody that was
[53:19] converted amongst the Gentiles and
[53:22] thereafter that God was going to be
[53:25] long-suffering and forgiving sins so we
[53:30] understand that that and that's what I
[53:33] want to kind of work towards tonight in
[53:35] just a few moments that there's a
[53:38] pattern of the way God does things God
[53:42] has a pattern though the people that can
[53:45] see that pattern there's actually arts
[53:48] and skills and people go to school to
[53:52] try to find patterns a reoccurring event
[53:58] but but the greatest pattern anybody
[54:02] could ever find is the pattern of how
[54:04] God does things because if he ever does
[54:09] one thing one way he'll continue to do
[54:12] it forever
[54:13] so that Paul says this is a faithful
[54:15] saying that Jesus Christ came to save
[54:19] sinners you don't have to be qualified
[54:21] to be a sinner we have all sinned and
[54:26] come short of the glory of God but there
[54:30] was a pattern even and the purpose for
[54:34] Paul's conversion the way that it was
[54:38] it literally represented a departure
[54:41] from the law which Paul was defending
[54:45] with vigor to the experience personal
[54:51] experience that Paul had of personally
[54:55] meeting the Lord Jesus Christ and being
[54:58] saved by grace oh it's awesome I like it
[55:03] amen the pattern that the Lord has and
[55:08] then when we turn I I think we just read
[55:12] that Titus about Paul is now talking to
[55:17] Titus saying lay for yourself
[55:20] a pattern of good works what wife it was
[55:24] he's asking he's telling Titus Titus he
[55:27] wants Titus to be a good pastor he wants
[55:30] him to have a good church he wants him
[55:33] to be a real representing a
[55:36] representation of what the love of God
[55:39] is and the gospel stands for and so if
[55:42] he tells Titus he says tell tell the
[55:45] people how to live basically he was
[55:49] telling them the pattern which they
[55:52] should follow and then he's just lay for
[55:55] yourself a pattern of good works
[55:58] something that could be identified
[56:02] therefore it's by the pattern if
[56:06] something is random it's very difficult
[56:11] to understand from whence it comes if
[56:15] it's just something that blips in but if
[56:19] it's a pattern if it repeats itself over
[56:22] and over again then you can sit back and
[56:26] you can look it and you understand there
[56:29] has to be something I don't want to
[56:32] sound like a scientist but there has to
[56:34] be something that causes the pattern
[56:42] it's just not random you know I like to
[56:48] shoot pistols and and I could take the
[56:53] target and I could stand there
[56:56] you know they changed the way you used
[56:58] to shoot used to shoot like this and
[57:00] then they said that's no good stand more
[57:03] sideways where they can hit you better
[57:06] but they found out if you face your
[57:10] target like this you have better control
[57:12] and also by the way that you shoot you
[57:17] can understand what's happening in your
[57:21] pattern so as I shoot at the target a
[57:26] pattern emerges I change the target a
[57:29] pattern emerges a pattern emerges a
[57:32] pattern emerges then someone that can
[57:34] look at that thing they can
[57:36] automatically tell what I'm doing and
[57:39] what I do is I push my the inside of my
[57:44] palm I push it in when I pull the
[57:48] trigger and it's always taking the
[57:53] bullet no right no right so you know I
[57:58] might be pointing at the top of the
[58:00] target but a patterns going to emerge a
[58:03] patterns going to emerge now so if I try
[58:06] to correct that pattern by turning my
[58:08] gun that's not gonna work now I'm lower
[58:12] left or will higher high left and the
[58:15] pattern emerges but they can find the
[58:19] caused by the pattern something's
[58:25] causing the pattern so Paul's came
[58:27] Timothy later yourself a pattern of good
[58:31] works because of this pattern of good
[58:34] work it's going to identify that there's
[58:38] something working in you because we know
[58:43] that our actions speak louder than our
[58:45] words so there's got to be a pattern
[58:50] that emerges and and we see from the
[58:56] scripture that God is an institute er of
[59:02] patterns God has a pattern you say well
[59:08] how is that we were taught that if God
[59:11] ever does one thing one way he has to
[59:16] continually do it the same way
[59:19] so in other words that pattern is going
[59:22] to repeat itself repeat itself if he
[59:25] ever forgave one sinner of his sins on
[59:30] the basis that that sinner came to him
[59:34] and asked for forgiveness he will repeat
[59:39] that pattern over and over and over
[59:42] again look I want to get that part of
[59:46] what I want to share with you this
[59:49] evening down you've got to understand
[59:52] God as a God of pattern you say give me
[59:59] another example the Sun has been rising
[1:00:04] in setting for a long time it's a daily
[1:00:12] pattern that men know that there's death
[1:00:17] burial and resurrection when the prophet
[1:00:22] of God spoke to the infidel and he asked
[1:00:26] the infidel who wear those apples he
[1:00:29] says that tree every year when it gets
[1:00:34] cold
[1:00:35] that tree loses its leaves and goes down
[1:00:39] into the crown but every spring that
[1:00:43] life comes back up out of that ground
[1:00:46] God laid that pattern there of death
[1:00:52] burial and resurrection it's everywhere
[1:00:56] that in the pattern that the invisible
[1:01:00] things of God can clearly be seen in the
[1:01:04] visible things around us remember the
[1:01:06] story of a little lady that the little
[1:01:08] girl that was in the rowboat of the
[1:01:10] little boy that was in the rowboat and
[1:01:12] he asked the question has shown me God
[1:01:15] he said I see God everywhere why because
[1:01:19] he's in the pattern he's in the pattern
[1:01:22] of creation he's in the patter of the
[1:01:25] blue bird singing he's in all these
[1:01:27] things the pattern
[1:01:28] oh my goodness I think it behooves
[1:01:34] to understand that there's something
[1:01:38] trying to blind us that he becomes the
[1:01:48] unrecognized God
[1:01:54] man tries to establish his own pattern
[1:01:57] and therefore they don't recognize that
[1:02:02] God has been very very fair to us been
[1:02:11] long-suffering he's done everything he's
[1:02:14] can thought the the the pattern is there
[1:02:18] so if he wants he wants him to lay a
[1:02:21] pattern of good works in doctrine
[1:02:24] showing uncorrupted us gravity sincerity
[1:02:28] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[1:02:33] that he that is contrary they that he is
[1:02:39] of the contrary part may be ashamed
[1:02:42] having no evil thing to say of you oh my
[1:02:49] did you imagine if we all could just
[1:02:52] adopt and understand there's a reason
[1:02:58] for a good conversation there's a reason
[1:03:01] for works that we stand blameless and
[1:03:05] that we could take that word and run
[1:03:07] that all through the scripture plain
[1:03:08] let's be blameless you know and again so
[1:03:12] the reason of that is Paul is
[1:03:14] understanding there was a pattern wrath
[1:03:16] of God in me now I'm going to see this
[1:03:22] is the pattern of salvation so now he's
[1:03:24] telling Titus Titus if you lay for
[1:03:27] yourself a pattern of good works it
[1:03:29] becomes a living gospel and the effect
[1:03:33] of not having any blame for them to lay
[1:03:36] on you is that they become ashamed
[1:03:39] what's another word for that they become
[1:03:42] convicted they come under conviction
[1:03:45] and you know you don't know it and I
[1:03:50] know I've shared this with you before
[1:03:52] but just so that you can understand I
[1:03:54] worked as electrician a long time when I
[1:03:57] was younger and the church was very
[1:03:59] small and I went every day the job and I
[1:04:02] was a Christian I'd read my Bible I
[1:04:04] wouldn't cuss I wouldn't you know I
[1:04:06] would do the things like any Christian
[1:04:08] would do nothing if spectacular of
[1:04:10] myself was just the Lord had saved me
[1:04:12] and I was a Christian basic Christian
[1:04:14] believed the message and I didn't even
[1:04:19] realize it because I was about my
[1:04:23] business but they would put on the rock
[1:04:26] and roll stations as loud as they could
[1:04:27] I just figured all they all had demons
[1:04:30] they had to feed it they did it with the
[1:04:33] intention of aggravating me they'd moved
[1:04:37] my tools they were locked my box they
[1:04:40] would do all this stuff and without
[1:04:43] knowing it's totally Beyonc to me I
[1:04:45] would I thought I left my toolbox here
[1:04:48] oh praise the Lord here's where I left
[1:04:52] it and then they were on a full mission
[1:04:58] to flip me out and get me to speak
[1:05:03] vilely about the God and they say you're
[1:05:10] gonna watch the cowboy game this Sunday
[1:05:12] no no I'm going to church if they like
[1:05:15] to rent their clothes this is what was
[1:05:19] going on inside of them I never knew it
[1:05:23] I was about my business and not to speak
[1:05:27] of me I just had a lot of flaws and a
[1:05:30] lot of frustrations like any person does
[1:05:33] but I didn't understand that they were
[1:05:35] viewing me through their eyes one day
[1:05:41] I'm at electrical counter picking up
[1:05:45] parts and this great big fella about the
[1:05:51] size of Big John back there that's Big
[1:05:54] John Beale in the back rather big John
[1:05:57] Beale
[1:05:58] and I thought I was dead this guy comes
[1:06:04] sauntering over to me he said are you
[1:06:07] David McGarry I said I am did I park in
[1:06:10] your spot what did I do
[1:06:13] you know I mean I just pulled in here
[1:06:15] park where I always do it didn't mean to
[1:06:17] offend you in any way did I get the last
[1:06:20] part that you were looking for and this
[1:06:23] great big guy they're starting to get
[1:06:26] the sniffles you're seeing a kid you
[1:06:29] spanking it gets the sniffles you know
[1:06:32] what I mean this great big I began to
[1:06:34] sniffle and I thought what did I do in
[1:06:39] tears started pouring down his face he
[1:06:45] said I've been looking for you for three
[1:06:47] years I thought I'm really in trouble
[1:06:52] then I thought did I owe you money he
[1:06:56] says he remembered that job out at Texas
[1:06:59] Instruments he says yes a while back I
[1:07:02] was working for I think Hearst Electric
[1:07:04] or something he says we out there tried
[1:07:07] to just make your job a living hell for
[1:07:10] you and I said he said I want to
[1:07:16] apologize for you I have come to know
[1:07:20] the Lord Jesus and I'm so ashamed of how
[1:07:25] that I treated you I always felt that
[1:07:29] somewhere in that process that got to
[1:07:32] him why because it's a pattern it's the
[1:07:37] way God works never be ashamed of the
[1:07:40] reproach that you bear by laying for
[1:07:44] yourself a holy life in a holy style it
[1:07:48] is a part of the pattern of salvation we
[1:07:56] get all politically trying to be correct
[1:08:00] not to offend anybody
[1:08:03] we're the very actions the pattern of
[1:08:07] good works that the Holy Spirit has
[1:08:10] placed in your lives
[1:08:12] is for the very purpose of bringing
[1:08:15] conviction so he knows what he's doing
[1:08:21] you've just got to have such confidence
[1:08:25] so what we're talking about tonight just
[1:08:28] a little bit is that God has a pattern
[1:08:33] you have to understand that God if God
[1:08:36] is not out of control nothing he hasn't
[1:08:42] missed anything you know someone told me
[1:08:47] one time he says oh I just can't believe
[1:08:49] that got past the Lord I said that thing
[1:08:53] didn't get past the Lord I had to go
[1:08:58] help a man on the side of the road
[1:09:01] because he bought a battery that was no
[1:09:02] good if he didn't understand that was
[1:09:05] the whole pattern of things so I got out
[1:09:10] there and I got to testify to him and he
[1:09:12] looked over said oh I just can't believe
[1:09:14] that this got by the Lord no it did to
[1:09:16] get by the Lord you're hearing the truth
[1:09:20] you know and so you've got to understand
[1:09:26] that many of the things that happen in
[1:09:30] your life are part of the pattern that
[1:09:33] God's unfolding and that you got
[1:09:37] preached less than any morning the part
[1:09:40] that you play in the plan of God well
[1:09:43] you have to understand if you're in that
[1:09:45] plan of God there's a pattern that's
[1:09:49] going to reoccur in your life over and
[1:09:52] over and over again God is working his
[1:09:58] pattern through you you might think oh
[1:10:02] I've got my own little life my own
[1:10:04] little world my whole total separation
[1:10:06] I'm not Pardo's what I'm doing he does
[1:10:10] and he fits and joins the body together
[1:10:15] that the pattern that he's trying to
[1:10:17] present might be manifested in the flesh
[1:10:21] so there's a pattern
[1:10:24] we just want to lay that down let's turn
[1:10:27] over to Hebrews the eighth chapter now
[1:10:38] I'd like to stay on this section for a
[1:10:40] long time because it's really deep but
[1:10:44] let's just start in the first verse of
[1:10:51] the eighth chapter of Hebrews
[1:11:06] I mean if this is such a great subject
[1:11:09] about Malky so that these two chapters
[1:11:11] go back and read them you'll get lost in
[1:11:14] them they're so magnificent now of the
[1:11:17] things which we have spoken this is the
[1:11:21] sum so he just went all through
[1:11:23] Melchizedek the priesthood he says this
[1:11:26] is the son of what this is what I'm
[1:11:29] coming to this is what I'm trying to say
[1:11:31] this is the son we have such an high
[1:11:35] priest who is set on the right hand of
[1:11:39] the throne of the Majesty in the heavens
[1:11:43] a minister of the sanctuary and of the
[1:11:48] true Tabernacle which the Lord pitch
[1:11:53] a--the and not man for every high priest
[1:11:59] is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifice
[1:12:04] wherefore it is of the necessity that
[1:12:08] this man have somewhat also to offer for
[1:12:14] if he were on earth he should not be a
[1:12:19] priest seeing that there are priests
[1:12:23] that offered gifts according to the law
[1:12:30] whose serveth unto the example and
[1:12:34] shadow of heavenly things as Moses was a
[1:12:39] Mohnish dove God who was about to make
[1:12:43] the tabernacle for saith he that maketh
[1:12:50] all things according to the pattern
[1:12:53] showeth to thee in the mountain but now
[1:13:00] have he obtained a more excellent
[1:13:02] ministry but how much also is he the
[1:13:06] mediator for a better covenant which was
[1:13:09] established upon better promises so he's
[1:13:16] talking about the high priest
[1:13:19] and that the high priest had certain
[1:13:22] functions that he that he did in
[1:13:26] offering gifts and sacrifices and and
[1:13:30] the the Lord was very specific to Moses
[1:13:34] to tell Moses follow this pattern
[1:13:37] exactly the quartering of the beasts the
[1:13:41] burning of it the way that all these
[1:13:44] things are done because all these things
[1:13:46] were shadows and types bearing witness
[1:13:50] to a greater one that was not going to
[1:13:55] make an earthly mediation but was going
[1:14:01] to make a heavenly mediation that wasn't
[1:14:05] going to make an earthly sanctification
[1:14:09] what was going to make a spiritual
[1:14:12] sanctification why because he's fixing
[1:14:15] to depart from the natural pattern of
[1:14:21] natural things and moved to the
[1:14:24] spiritual pattern of spiritual things if
[1:14:26] you follow Paul's gospel and you ever
[1:14:30] got into this main of the types of the
[1:14:35] Old Testament to what Paul was teaching
[1:14:38] the Gentiles he was always teaching the
[1:14:41] Gentiles the pattern of God how God was
[1:14:47] rich in mercy how God rewarded he didn't
[1:14:51] labor them in the the law because he
[1:14:55] said if you have the spirit you fulfill
[1:14:58] the law you don't walk after the law
[1:15:00] which is of the flesh but you walk after
[1:15:03] the spirit
[1:15:04] so you fulfill the thing that the law
[1:15:07] put currently you fulfill the pattern of
[1:15:11] the law to grace in the Spirit of the
[1:15:13] Lord so we could go into that for a
[1:15:21] wonderful time but it was important to
[1:15:25] follow the pattern
[1:15:30] so you understand that pay I don't know
[1:15:33] maybe some of you are asking yourselves
[1:15:35] right now is there any pattern to my
[1:15:38] life most people who aren't successful
[1:15:45] have a pattern
[1:15:48] how many knows one of the patterns the
[1:15:50] prophet of God told us to do every day
[1:15:53] read our Bible and pray what is that
[1:15:58] that's a pattern because a pattern is
[1:16:03] going to produce results if I went and
[1:16:08] said I lifted weights today you'd look
[1:16:12] at me and say yeah but if I lifted
[1:16:17] weights in a continual pattern over a
[1:16:21] period of time the evidence of the
[1:16:25] pattern would now begin to manifest now
[1:16:30] if I told you that I had the best pizza
[1:16:32] last night and I had pasta today and
[1:16:38] this you would look at me and say yeah
[1:16:41] I see you have a pattern of carbs and
[1:16:46] that is evident is there evidence that
[1:16:49] you have a pattern of carp many times
[1:16:53] even in counseling people come in and
[1:16:56] they talk to me and they have worries
[1:16:59] and problems and all these things and
[1:17:01] I'll actually have to sit down with them
[1:17:03] and be honest with them that it would do
[1:17:05] you good to take care of yourself
[1:17:11] eat good exercise do these things you
[1:17:17] say well physical exercise that
[1:17:19] profiteth little don't you don't
[1:17:22] misinterpret that scripture for her to
[1:17:24] let your life go to pieces I'll never
[1:17:30] forget when Dalston Rolly talked about
[1:17:31] time he walked he walked all these
[1:17:33] mountains and he went up there and down
[1:17:35] through valleys and woods and everything
[1:17:37] he said there ain't a man in the world
[1:17:38] that could follow me and he was quite a
[1:17:41] bit younger than brother
[1:17:42] here comes brother round did you see
[1:17:46] this did you see that did you see this
[1:17:48] did you see that it was evident that he
[1:17:52] had walked it was evident that he had
[1:17:55] hunted it was evident and you know he
[1:17:58] made a tremendous statement
[1:18:00] he says one step look in place you know
[1:18:09] it because there is so much pattern with
[1:18:16] God that if you if you don't start
[1:18:21] bringing that into your thinking you let
[1:18:24] everything that's fed to you start
[1:18:28] controlling the way you think so let's
[1:18:34] read our last scripture and then I'll
[1:18:35] finish up and we can go and this is
[1:18:42] found in Hebrews 9 chapter starting with
[1:18:47] the nineteenth verse
[1:19:01] and again this is another thing about
[1:19:04] Testament and living and debt is
[1:19:06] tremendous but for when Moses had spoken
[1:19:10] every precept to all every when Moses
[1:19:18] has spoken every precept to all the
[1:19:21] people according to the law he took the
[1:19:26] blood of calves and of goats with water
[1:19:30] and scarlet wool and hyssop and
[1:19:34] sprinkled both the books and all the
[1:19:39] people saying this is the blood of the
[1:19:43] Testament which God hath enjoined unto
[1:19:47] you moreover he sprinkle it with blood
[1:19:51] both the tabernacle and all the vessels
[1:19:54] of the ministry and almost all things
[1:20:00] are by the law purged with blood and
[1:20:05] without the shedding of blood is no
[1:20:08] remission it was necessary that the
[1:20:13] patterns of these things in the heavens
[1:20:18] should be purified with these so there
[1:20:23] was a pattern laid down you understand
[1:20:26] so he's saying that these patterns they
[1:20:31] purified earthly things earthly vessels
[1:20:35] earthly Tabernacles earthly people but
[1:20:38] he says that they heavens needed to be
[1:20:41] purified in this same pattern ok so it
[1:20:49] without blood there was nothing that
[1:20:50] purified it you understand that he
[1:20:53] purified both the heavens and the earth
[1:20:58] glory that's why we're going to get a
[1:21:01] new heavens and a new earth because the
[1:21:03] blood fell on the earth to redeem the
[1:21:06] earth the spirit that was in the blood
[1:21:09] returned back upon the believer oh
[1:21:12] that's exciting
[1:21:14] the pattern of things in the heavens
[1:21:18] should be purified with these but the
[1:21:21] heavenly things themselves with better
[1:21:24] sacrifices than these with better
[1:21:27] sacrifices than goats and lambs with a
[1:21:30] better sacrifice who's that
[1:21:33] hallelujah the son of God himself
[1:21:36] purifying the very creation that he
[1:21:40] created being the Word of God for Christ
[1:21:43] is not entered into the holy places made
[1:21:47] with hands which are the figures of the
[1:21:54] truth but into heaven itself now to
[1:21:58] appear in the presence of God for us Wow
[1:22:07] what a pattern he actually showed us
[1:22:12] that he's in heaven right now with his
[1:22:16] what sacrifice with the blood that He
[1:22:21] shed making intercession for us
[1:22:25] no wonder the Prophet tried to tell us
[1:22:28] there's only one provided place of
[1:22:30] worship and it's under the shed blood
[1:22:34] not a finished work at Calvary so to
[1:22:39] speak but an on-going high priest that
[1:22:45] that taketh our infirmities upon himself
[1:22:49] and now is sitting at the presence of
[1:22:52] God making intercession for us oh my
[1:22:57] that's where I want to meet him I want
[1:23:00] to meet him in that pattern I want to
[1:23:03] meet him where he's at I want to meet
[1:23:05] and what he's doing don't ever get to
[1:23:07] the place to think that you can have a
[1:23:10] spiritual relationship with God through
[1:23:13] the intellectual conception of doctrine
[1:23:20] God is worshiped in spirit and in truth
[1:23:25] seeks such to worship Him it is a
[1:23:31] wonderful relationship now I said that
[1:23:39] to say this you say brother Gary you
[1:23:44] could have saved us all a lot of time
[1:23:45] and just said it but I read that
[1:23:47] scripture that Paul said I said all
[1:23:50] these things to sum this up God is an
[1:23:57] evolutionist another word he worked from
[1:24:03] a pattern he evolves in other words for
[1:24:08] evolutionist is a nun folder he doesn't
[1:24:11] go to the final product when he starts
[1:24:17] the final product he starts the process
[1:24:22] evolutive and moving towards the final
[1:24:25] product he does that so he can have
[1:24:29] fellowship with you which was one of his
[1:24:32] purposes he talked about Michelangelo in
[1:24:37] the end in the message who is this
[1:24:41] Melchizedek and he's talking all through
[1:24:44] that book about how that he started in
[1:24:47] the prophets and began to chisel away
[1:24:51] working towards the final image of
[1:24:54] Christ and he said Michelangelo he just
[1:24:59] tried he's using this story to get the
[1:25:02] image into your mind the purpose of
[1:25:05] getting the image into your mind is to
[1:25:09] under for you to understand that you are
[1:25:12] that rock that God's working on and so
[1:25:16] he gets there and he says Michelangelo
[1:25:20] starts carving he has an image in his
[1:25:22] mind that's the word a thought that he
[1:25:28] wants to express so he's saying God had
[1:25:31] a thought in his mind so he wanted to
[1:25:35] express that thought and he wanted that
[1:25:39] ought to be recognized so he laid a
[1:25:42] pattern in all his people a pattern in
[1:25:45] Moses a pattern and daven a pattern in
[1:25:49] the profits that these prophets were
[1:25:52] moved upon and brotherman made this
[1:25:55] statement he said they didn't even know
[1:25:57] why the things were happening to them in
[1:25:59] their life
[1:26:00] how many knows he said they were forced
[1:26:04] into a pattern not understanding that
[1:26:07] the very things that they were going
[1:26:10] through was a reflection or a pattern of
[1:26:13] that which perfect thing was to come
[1:26:15] glory to God and soak he's he's evolving
[1:26:26] working his way to that perfect son he's
[1:26:35] an evolutionist he unfolds that and so
[1:26:40] we understand that then he had a bride
[1:26:44] now without going into all the church
[1:26:47] ages and coming down the seven church
[1:26:49] ages which we may do a little bit and
[1:26:51] the horse riders but God was evolving
[1:26:55] his church he's giving more word to his
[1:27:02] church he's revealing to his church his
[1:27:06] my church is maturing by sitting in the
[1:27:10] Esso end of the Word of God there was no
[1:27:15] gospel on earth that can mature the
[1:27:19] bride because they were bound from the
[1:27:23] secrets that were hid in the seals so
[1:27:28] God came and veiled himself in a prophet
[1:27:33] he used the Prophet as the veil he was
[1:27:37] hit him and he used that bill so he
[1:27:41] could unrevealed and open up the pattern
[1:27:46] and he could open up the seals and once
[1:27:50] that mystery was opened up
[1:27:52] now there was a gospel there that could
[1:27:56] perfect the bride now real men they
[1:28:00] probed at it they would look at it and
[1:28:04] they'd say oh the tenant the the League
[1:28:08] of Nations or the european union or
[1:28:11] whatever that's the ten toes of daniel
[1:28:14] well daniel lost his foot does that end
[1:28:19] it and they had all these things they
[1:28:22] were probing at because they were
[1:28:25] blinded to the pattern of god they were
[1:28:30] blinded to the fact that god is evolving
[1:28:33] this church in the same way he does the
[1:28:36] world he does the church he does the
[1:28:38] individual all of you have been
[1:28:41] involving those that know me thirty
[1:28:45] forty years ago i hope i've made some
[1:28:48] progress not much but a little
[1:28:52] i ain't what i want to be i mean what i
[1:28:57] need to be but any what i used to be
[1:29:00] there's a transformation god's a
[1:29:04] transformer he's transforming he's
[1:29:07] transforming he uses circumstance to do
[1:29:10] that he uses to tried think you're not
[1:29:13] strange at the trying of your faith is
[1:29:15] more precious in gold because all that
[1:29:19] he justified he sanctifies now that he
[1:29:21] sanctifies he glorifies all these things
[1:29:24] work together for it good dope don't you
[1:29:27] see all those scriptures are telling you
[1:29:29] about the pattern of god there is a
[1:29:31] pattern of god that god has and that's
[1:29:39] what satan has always tried to do is
[1:29:43] break the pattern stop the evolution
[1:29:53] what do you think all this is that's
[1:29:56] going on it's stopping the evolution of
[1:30:00] the believer people are becoming
[1:30:05] complaint
[1:30:06] people are are finding themselves caught
[1:30:12] up in fear their actions are changing
[1:30:17] their view of the futures changing I
[1:30:20] have a view of the future watch me
[1:30:26] demonstrate you know how much I'd love
[1:30:31] just a step behind that curtain and
[1:30:33] become the invisible pastor my vision is
[1:30:40] out of here this is not a stain gospel
[1:30:45] it's a leaving gospel so you understand
[1:30:48] what's happening he's trying to break
[1:30:50] and stop the evolution of you evolving
[1:30:58] growing laying for yourself a pattern of
[1:31:03] fed works he wants me to abandon things
[1:31:06] that you've always done he's a disrupter
[1:31:11] he's the author of what confusion have
[1:31:16] you ever seen a bunch of scientific
[1:31:21] smart people who are so confused by a
[1:31:26] bug I'll tell you what kills that bug is
[1:31:33] prayer laying on his hands fast and pray
[1:31:38] for somebody call the mercies down for
[1:31:41] heaven he said he would not leave you
[1:31:43] nor forsake you he said he's a high
[1:31:46] priest that can be touched but by the
[1:31:48] infirmities you say well we shouldn't
[1:31:50] get it then that's fine I might get it
[1:31:53] they tell me I might have it I don't
[1:31:56] know I could be asymptomatic earth or no
[1:32:00] symptoms or you know they try to make
[1:32:03] everybody out to be a death machine I'm
[1:32:05] not a death machine I'm a life machine
[1:32:08] I've got the Word of God in me and I've
[1:32:11] been told that I can impart eternal life
[1:32:14] cuz faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:32:17] by the word of
[1:32:18] just stay away from everybody and don't
[1:32:21] tell them well maybe I need to put on my
[1:32:27] mask Malachi 4:5 Luke 17 hurry
[1:32:33] revelations 10 7 the hole they'll send
[1:32:39] you alive to the Prophet the mystery
[1:32:42] something but they want to shut you up
[1:32:45] they want to shut your actions up they
[1:32:49] want to do everything don't you see he's
[1:32:51] disrupting the evolution of the church
[1:32:57] the personal evolution of your growth in
[1:33:03] Christ your your fellowship with him in
[1:33:07] the revealed Word of the hour that was
[1:33:10] spoken to us through a messenger that
[1:33:13] message is left Messenger is left but
[1:33:17] the message that he gave us was not
[1:33:21] started in 59 or back or whenever that
[1:33:25] message was lying in heaven before the
[1:33:28] foundation of the world it was the time
[1:33:31] of its delivering and he delivered it in
[1:33:36] his season showed us the pattern and now
[1:33:41] the real church is living it out it's
[1:33:46] coming out coming out growing moving
[1:33:49] moving on now all of a sudden we're
[1:33:52] getting close to the end saying says I'd
[1:33:56] better shut this down all right how to
[1:34:00] break them up these people can't stay
[1:34:02] together I got to get them some of the
[1:34:07] fall away I've got it I can't let this
[1:34:09] group grow I can't let this group do it
[1:34:12] and I'm just not talking about this
[1:34:13] church I'm talking about the bright I've
[1:34:17] got to get their mind off of winning
[1:34:22] souls I've got to get their mind off of
[1:34:27] sharing this message I've got to get
[1:34:30] everybody around them
[1:34:32] so afraid that if they get within six
[1:34:36] feet well let me tell you the Scriptures
[1:34:42] can travel six feet your testimony
[1:34:48] travels miles and in this day and age
[1:34:53] overnight
[1:34:55] you don't think so make a mistake I'll
[1:35:01] guarantee if I took that happen in my
[1:35:03] life that wasn't right by morning every
[1:35:06] preacher in the world would know it I
[1:35:08] knew he was a rat I could have told you
[1:35:14] that well I sure wish you to come and
[1:35:16] told me before I got in the mass but
[1:35:22] that's a pattern the tongue is an unruly
[1:35:26] member hard to bridle
[1:35:28] so you sit back and you begin to
[1:35:31] understand that that what confusion does
[1:35:35] is it stops the pattern and then we drop
[1:35:39] out of the evolution the experience of
[1:35:44] God is an evolution that goes on in
[1:35:47] every individual it grows year after
[1:35:50] year after year after year things that
[1:35:53] bother you you they're so insignificant
[1:35:55] to you now you want to get caught up in
[1:35:59] heavenly places you you want to see the
[1:36:02] bigger picture it guy preach the sermon
[1:36:06] on that the bigger picture what I'm
[1:36:08] saying is don't get caught up in the
[1:36:10] little things understand that God is
[1:36:13] trying to evolve this charge and the
[1:36:16] circumstance that he's put here is for
[1:36:20] our evolution don't let it do what the
[1:36:23] enemy's trying to do and stop your
[1:36:26] evolution or your growing or your
[1:36:31] manifesting the attributes of God don't
[1:36:35] let this stop you from spiritually
[1:36:40] growth
[1:36:43] don't let this crisis stop
[1:36:45] your spiritual growth press into it more
[1:36:50] than ever you need spiritual growth now
[1:36:53] more than ever you need to contact this
[1:36:57] message dig into it look into it read it
[1:37:01] read your Bible pray you need to find
[1:37:04] your place in the plan of God and find
[1:37:07] those for ordained works the pattern of
[1:37:11] good works that God for ordained for you
[1:37:15] before the foundation of the world that
[1:37:17] you walk in them
[1:37:22] or otherwise you're wishy-washy you're
[1:37:26] in and out you're up and down every
[1:37:29] storm that blows it's the end of the
[1:37:34] world I want to solve that question once
[1:37:38] and for all it is
[1:37:40] the end of the world I've got the saith
[1:37:47] the Lord we're at the end time you say
[1:37:52] well you know there's a lot of things
[1:37:55] ending the sanity of man is ending
[1:38:00] reverence is ending respect is ending
[1:38:06] democracy as we know it is ending
[1:38:10] respect for lawless dirt Law & Order is
[1:38:14] ending respect for one another is ending
[1:38:21] men judging by the outward appearance
[1:38:24] when God Himself judges from the inside
[1:38:28] out
[1:38:28] I mean I don't know if you understand it
[1:38:33] but Satan has stopped the evolution of
[1:38:38] mankind they're not evolving they're not
[1:38:44] getting better they're corrupt and now
[1:38:49] their corruption is eating their logical
[1:38:54] common decency of their minds
[1:38:59] Church of the Living God now's the time
[1:39:04] to stand up and let your light shine now
[1:39:07] is the time to evolve in Christ more
[1:39:11] than you've ever evolved don't let this
[1:39:13] stop your evolution and your spiritual
[1:39:16] growth but determined more than ever to
[1:39:19] grow in Christ Jesus
[1:39:21] hey man let's have communion that's part
[1:39:28] of spiritual growth let's love one
[1:39:31] another
[1:39:31] let's care one for another let's look
[1:39:33] after one for for another God the
[1:39:36] unveiling of God is taking place in you
[1:39:40] right now in this hour this
[1:39:42] circumstances has arisen
[1:39:45] so his church can arise and trim their
[1:39:50] lamp and let their light shine that
[1:39:53] their good works might glorify their
[1:39:56] father in heaven let's stand together if
[1:39:58] the brothers would go prepare the
[1:40:00] communion
[1:40:13] let's turn to the book of first
[1:40:16] corinthians the 11th chapter and the
[1:40:20] 23rd verse don't you love this you think
[1:40:29] you're gonna have fellowship you're
[1:40:31] gonna have fellowship with those Saints
[1:40:33] in the first church age because they're
[1:40:36] accepting this because Paul received it
[1:40:40] from the Lord and they love their
[1:40:43] messenger just like there's many things
[1:40:46] we receive that people don't understand
[1:40:49] because we know we've received it from a
[1:40:53] messenger so let's read this together as
[1:40:55] the brothers prepare Communion and we
[1:40:59] won't have foot washing this evening but
[1:41:01] we just have communion for I have
[1:41:04] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:41:08] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:41:12] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:41:14] took bread and when he give thanks he
[1:41:18] brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:41:22] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:41:27] remembrance of me and after the same
[1:41:31] manner also he took the cup when he had
[1:41:34] supped saying this cup is the New
[1:41:37] Testament in my blood
[1:41:39] this do ye as often as ye drink it in
[1:41:42] remembrance of me for as often as ye eat
[1:41:46] this bread and drink this cup ye do show
[1:41:49] the Lord's death till he come what is
[1:41:52] this
[1:41:53] it's a pattern it's a pattern and I've
[1:42:00] already gave my whole thought on
[1:42:03] communion so I forgot what message it
[1:42:07] was in but it's there for as often as
[1:42:10] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:42:11] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:42:13] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:42:16] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:42:18] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:42:21] and blood of the Lord but let a minute
[1:42:24] Ammon himself and so let him eat of that
[1:42:27] bread and drink of that Cup for he that
[1:42:30] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[1:42:32] and drinketh damnation to himself not
[1:42:34] discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:42:37] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:42:40] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:42:43] ourselves we should not be judged so
[1:42:47] that's what this time is this time to
[1:42:49] judge yourself is it time to say you're
[1:42:51] sorry for the things you've done it's
[1:42:53] decided to purpose in your heart that
[1:42:55] you're going to do better it doesn't
[1:42:57] mean if you've done something wrong you
[1:42:59] can't have communion what it means is
[1:43:02] deal with it
[1:43:05] confront it recognize it apologize for
[1:43:10] it he's just unfaithful to forgive and
[1:43:12] then go lay for yourself a pattern he
[1:43:16] that steel steel with no more but work
[1:43:18] with your hands that you might give so
[1:43:22] if you've said something bad about
[1:43:24] somebody go out and say something nice
[1:43:27] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:43:30] should not be judged but when we are
[1:43:32] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:43:36] we should not be condemned with the
[1:43:39] world wherefore my brother when you come
[1:43:42] together to tarry to eat tarry one for
[1:43:46] another and if any man hunger
[1:43:48] let him eat at home that ye come not
[1:43:50] together unto come the nation in the
[1:43:53] rest will I set in order when I come
[1:44:07] let's all pray together our gracious
[1:44:11] Heavenly Father Lord we're gonna take
[1:44:14] bread this evening which represents your
[1:44:18] word the great creative power the bread
[1:44:24] of life that cometh down from heaven
[1:44:27] that your body is meat indeed it's
[1:44:31] spiritual life does it's eternal life
[1:44:34] and we take it in remembrance of that
[1:44:37] and remembrance of the fact that you
[1:44:39] paid a price that has you in the
[1:44:42] presence of God making intercession for
[1:44:45] us we meet you on that ground and we
[1:44:48] bring this to remembrance Heavenly
[1:44:51] Father this line that represents the
[1:44:55] shed blood the stimulation of Revelation
[1:44:58] the life that was in the blood coming up
[1:45:01] back upon the believer we take it father
[1:45:05] that we testify that we've entered into
[1:45:08] communion with you and in fellowship
[1:45:11] with you and we're involving and growing
[1:45:14] into the statute of a perfect man we ask
[1:45:18] you to bless this deceive me in Jesus
[1:45:20] precious name we pray amen
