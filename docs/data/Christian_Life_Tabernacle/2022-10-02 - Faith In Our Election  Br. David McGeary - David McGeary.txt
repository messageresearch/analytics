morning in his presence amen that he may come and cover us with his peace and amen when all seems hopeless we want him to cover us when we don't have understanding we want him to cover us when we are in trouble we want him to cover us with all that we go through it is covering that we need amen want to welcome everyone in the hearts of God this morning all our visitors God bless you man you may turn around and shake the hand of someone who divide by the mic for a Psalm reading and opening prayer God bless you thank you good morning we'll go ahead and turn to Psalm 119 this morning this is it final section and what you would have enjoyed going through this section it's uh you know what a great chapter to read and to uh I think experts say it takes about 15 minutes to read it all by yourself just in one sitting I don't know how anybody can do that because it's so rich you just can sit and just chew over sections of it you know for days but I know I've enjoyed going through it I hope you have too you know I think the thing that you take away from Psalm 119 as we read through it it's all about a relationship with the word that's what it's all about you know church services are wonderful Fellowship is wonderful spending time in the reading the scriptures is wonderful but without without that relationship that personal relationship all that other stuff is just religion just the works of men you know Jesus said in John 17 verse 3 it was kind of his last prayer he said in this is life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou Hast sent who is the word amen and then in first John 5 20 the disciple whom he loved said and we know that the son of God the word is come and hath given us understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ who is the word this is the true God and eternal life you know as we turned that last section of Psalm 119 and pick up in verse 169 you know what it caught my attention is there's back to back verses there that talk about using my mouth to speak forth something to make a noise to make a sound to make a voice it says in verse 169 Let My Cry come near before thee O Lord in verse 170 it said let my supplication come before thee in verse 171 it says my lips shall utter praise and then in verse 172 my tongue shall speak My Cry my supplication my lips my tongue you know we often speak about having eyes to see and ears to hear you know we all I think appreciate the value of having our ears open that we may hear him our eyes opened that we may see him but you know the thing about a relationship is it's two-way foreign you know remember the chapter is all about having a relationship with the word you know and if all we do is sit there and watch and see and hear and listen it's still not much of a relationship you know there's a two-way dialogue required the question is is what do we bring to the relationship after all the hearing and all the seeing what is it that he expects us to bring to the relationship you know there's a section of Revelation that we're all familiar with it's in Revelation chapter 10. when John takes that little book and he eats it and I hope we see ourselves in the scripture you know that there's been a word made available to us that if we take and we eat that and it becomes part of ourselves but there's a scripture at the end in verse 11. where he was instructed to speak amen amen you must prophesy again so after all the seeing and all the hearing and even all the eating there's a speaking that is part of the relationship you know there has to be a voice a sound a response from us in this relationship in verse 169 it says Let My Cry come near before thee O Lord and I don't suppose there's anyone in this room that hasn't ever had a time in their life where they cried out to the Lord you know crying out to him to come on the scene for us or to meet our need you know and there's whole books in Christian bookstores to help people manage the process of crying out to the Lord and maybe not hearing from him you know is it I'm not worthy is it because I haven't cried out enough you know the question is is it the right kind of sound that he's looking for you know what kind of cry does he respond to it says in verse 169 give me understanding according to Thy Word there is no promise that he's going to respond to every time you cry but he will respond to his word when I cry unto the Lord does he hear my desire or does he hear his word in fact brother Branham preached a whole sermon about that why cry speak remember the story of the children of Israel trapped against the sea and Moses stood there in a desperate hour and everyone was crying out to the Lord and his ask what his challenge was why do you cry to me speak he had already spoken he said I'm going to lead you to the promised land so what was he crying out for save me he'd already said what he was going to do it was the same with the disciples when they were stuck on that stormy sea and they saw that storm come up and they were panicking and they cried out Lord save us lest we be destroyed by the storm but he'd already told them we're going to the other side see it's why cry what what sound do you produce when you cry are you crying out and speaking his word right verse 170 let my supplication come before thee my supplication my prayer my request you know once again what's my part what's my voice what sound is being produced from me is it the number of times I pray how many hours I spend on my knees how loud I pray or is it simply as verse 170 says deliver me according to Thy Word see he's looking for a certain sound to come out of us as part of this relationship in verse 171 my lips shall utter praise is it because of the music is it because of the loud preaching is it because of the excitement of the room you know if he's looking for volume if he's looking for music then he's at the Ballpark this morning where he's in the Rock concert down the street what is he looking for what's the sound he's looking for it says in verse 171 let my lips shall utter praise when thou has taught me thy statutes Thy Word we praise in response to the word no music required no no loud preaching required if you've ever came to that place where you heard thus saith the Lord for you you have a basis of praise no music required you know in the last one I think sums it up really well verse 172 my tongue shall speak Thy Word you know the sound that he's looking for you know in a relationship it's a conversation you know we want to hear from him and that's our expectation this morning but you know he wants to hear from us he speaks to us by his word he wants to hear from us by his word word fellowshipping with word speaking word and word responding with word you know may My Cry my supplication my lips my tongue be an outlet for his word is that your prayer this morning it certainly is mine because there's really no other sound that he's looking for as it says in Psalm 19 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord let's read that last section of Psalm 119 together those last eight verses starting in verse 169. it says Let My Cry come near before thee O Lord give me understanding according to Thy word let my supplication come before thee deliver me according to Thy word my lips shall utter praise when thou has taught me thy statutes my tongue shall speak of Thy word for all thy Commandments are righteousness let thine hand help me for I have chosen thy precepts I have longed for thy salvation O Lord and thy law is my delight let my soul live and it shall praise thee and let thy judgments help me I have gone astray like a lost sheep seek thy servant for I do not forget thy Commandments amen amen God bless you may have your seeds [Music] oh victory is mine all victory is mine oh Victory today is my eyes [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] told me oh and a victory is fine go back to me oh and a victory today [Applause] is [Music] the name of Jesus [Music] [Music] birthday of Jesus [Music] [Music] name of Jesus [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right [Music] [Music] boys [Music] give me I know [Music] for me [Music] all over me I know that falls [Music] [Music] oh [Music] my God [Music] oh I'm so glad [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all right [Music] now [Music] [Music] amen aren't you glad you're free this morning amen Amen brother Matthew and Marco have a special I mean if they could come this morning [Music] foreign [Music] time God is good yeah you know who he is he's good all the time [Music] well God is good yes he is he's good all the time God is good all the time [Music] he's not good just once in a while he's good all the time now we all have friends who let us down you know

time God is good all the time [Music] foreign [Applause] amen I think there's actually a reason for that special this morning um if you recall a couple of weeks ago I believe they had written a request they wanted their dad to be able to attend Services because he was working on Sundays and there's a a testimony here it says praise God my dad got a new job and once he starts he'll be able to come to church amen he hears the prayers of little children amen Whoever has a need amen is there to respond to it amen praise God this morning it's uh but a Joelle Cabello birthday happy birthday God

meet right after service uh brother Adrian writes God bless your brothers and sisters uh please pray for my wife Cindy she's having a chest pain and she's at home her desire is to feel better so she can join us for communion we have communion this afternoon please pray for God to come by and to touch her I believe God can make a way for that amen I certainly pray that the Lord will do that for her please remember Sister Heidi in prayer her condition has gotten worse in the in the last couple of weeks certainly when I lift up our sisters amen we believe that our God is the god of Miracles amen when the situation gets worse he gets better at it they're mad there's no God like our God Amen but a Joella Villa writes please pray for the family of Romero Avila she's a niece that lost a son in a vehicle accident yesterday please pray that God blesses them with his love and comfort God bless you amen Richard you want to remember them and that the Lord will strengthen them also we're going to continue to remember the John Morris family that the Lord will continue to be with them in this time it may if you ever need upon your heart just lift your hand up to him the brothers that are taking the offerings if it could come amen by the injury if it could just come uh take this needs before the Lord let us pray together Heavenly Father Lord God we thank you that we can come to you

speak your word Lord and lord it's from our heart that we desire to see you God moving Lord like you've always moved in the hearts of your believing children and so father you heard the request Lord you know what's on our heart and father you know Lord It's it's in our heart and mind that we believe that you know what we have need of before we even ask but Lord somehow just in the Cry of our heart and to know your will Lord we ask that Lord our sisters Lord our sister Heidi and our sister Cindy we know that it's your your desire and your will that they prosper and be in good health so we claim the blood for them now we ask God that you would sue the Broken Heart of that that niece of Romero Avila Lord surely you know what it's like to lose loved ones Lord when Lazarus died you wept oh God and now I pray you'd Comfort them Lord Lord surely there's nothing in this world that can make sense of a loss like that but father Lord I pray that the Great I Am would come and comfort him give him a vision give them strength Lord in this difficult time lord may your word come and the truth give them make sense of it oh Lord somehow father and as we're needy Lord today Lord we know there's

closer to you Lord be more like you Lord father so we're yielding our heart to you Lord we're asking that you would take preeminence in this service lord lord it's our desire to thank you and praise you with all that we are Lord to really know you more Lord and surely Lord your your wisdom and knowledge is too wonderful for us but certainly Lord we love the fellowship Lord and we ask God that

wonderful we just asked this morning that we could be lifted up in your word father our hearts would be encouraged and we'd be blessed today we'd walk out of here with hope we'd walk from this place with strength we'd be encouraged and and we would know that your love's forgiven us of our trespasses and that you'll never forsake us [Music] Lord draw Us close as our brother exhorted Us in this Psalm that it's a relationship it's a two-part father and you've never failed on your side Lord we ask that our part can grow we just ask your grace this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen and amen God bless you may be seated this morning certainly nice to be in the house of the Lord today and to fill a ship around his word do you know Leslie's out in uh San Diego watching over my mom while my sisters away and I appreciate that but I found out a lot of things that you need to find out before you let your wife leave and one is how do you start the dish uh the dishwasher well I can wash dishes by hand but how do you start the washing machine and now so I I pressed a few buttons and I just threw the clothes in there I don't know what it did but now I can't get the door open so I don't know I guess they can sit in there till Thursday right well maybe one of my daughters-in-laws will come and and Rescue Me but uh but anyway I all the little things seem to pop up that she's been uh I noticed all the clothes laying all over the room for the first time I don't know I I guess she's been picking them up all this time but uh so you know I can tell she's missing I can tell when the Lord's missing in my life too amen so we certainly uh trust him I I certainly uh uh am so thankful for all the wonderful support that you gave Brother John and those that you came out for the funeral yesterday and we have some beautiful flower arrangements that sister uh Julia made for the uh uh funeral and they they had to leave them here with us and so um I guess maybe after evening service if some of you sisters want to pull a few of them and you can go ahead and and do that after you're after you get what you want no it's okay so but anyway I want to thank you for your patience during construction and we you notice we're making progress and and I know you have to park in the dirt and walk in the dirt and we're going to try to pour some parking lot here in the next couple weeks but I know it's hardest on our young mothers because we don't have any place for your children to play and run and and we'll we'll see if we can come up with some ways maybe to make a playground area or something we're just going to start praying about that but in the meantime it's very difficult because we just don't have the facilities and it's not your fault it's it's just that's the way things are if we can fight through it and be good but we're still trying to keep an atmosphere in the church house and respect for the church house so I know we we don't have a place for you to feed your children and give them snacks and places but so we'll we'll express our guidelines and then you do your best in the circumstance that you're in to try to maintain the best we can so I'm not trying to make it law and but or anything but just things so uh we don't have enough seating in the sanctuary as you know so we have a large section of overflow we call it overflow but really it's an extension of the sanctuary so when it when Services ended we're still trying to keep a reverent atmosphere in both places the trouble is the Fourier is stuck right in the middle of the sanctuary if you can understand that so that Sanctuary back there and this is sanctuary and the four you're in the restrooms and the nursery is stuck right in the middle so we've got to do our best in the foyer now to try to keep our conversations down if you can move your conversation outside that's better um if you have to talk in the four-year try to keep it down and then so the people that are praying in the back and praying in here can finish their worship and and then go on so I know what's going to be difficult and hard to do do your best to keep that in mind you know what I mean do your best and um you know I give charge to the deacons you know keep it reverent keep it quiet and they do their best to enforce it and of course they take all the grief as that's why I have to have seven deacons because uh all the grief that they've got to take for me but uh we'll uh we'll do our best okay and then I know we don't have a place to feed your children and and the nurseries crowded the nursery is not in is also an extension of everything so let's do our best to be mindful to keep everything quiet and reverent the best we can and uh you know be be careful about um you know what the prophet has said about children running and and things so I know it we don't have a place for them to run we don't have a place for him to go I know it's difficult so I know that this whole process is the most difficult on your young mothers and our hearts are with you do your best others if you the elderly sisters I'd like to say that you know but those of you who are spiritual Elders not age-wise help the younger that's scriptural and and we'll just we'll try to get through this the best we can amen so anyway uh just all those little things but uh but now we'll have my favorite part of being a pastor and that's a baby dedication amen I I I don't mind babies crying because that crime is good it's the crying they do when they get after they get older that's when the it gets hard but right now we're gonna dedicate Everett Matthew Armin and if Josh and Jessica would come and I wonder if Tim and Melinda would join us up here this morning and this let's sing it as they come oh bring bring [Music] foreign Eleanor I didn't see you there I did call your name the most important thing he's called your name right that's right hey man good to see you today God bless you amen well in that wonderful now I'm going to try to hold are these babies getting bigger and heavier or am I getting older can I try yes sir all right you can try oh my be good for me little buddy I'm gonna show you no he's not

today for this this fine young gentleman here Lord and it's good to have grandpa with us I like saying that too you know it was a time to see the Lord a bless us so a brother Tim why don't you say a prayer first and then we'll ask the dad to say a prayer and and let me uh let me quote Mary first you know we often quote biblical Heroes and and Men of the Bible Mary is a hero also both Mary's she said he that is mighty hath done unto me great things and holy is his name and I feel very privileged this morning the Lord has answered prayer let it be known he's he's coming A Great Mighty way we're thankful let's buy rich our gracious and kind Heavenly Father Lord we come to you in the name of your blessed son the Lord Jesus thanking you and praising you Lord for life we know only comes from you [Music] and Lord we Are Thankful Lord that we're capable of of the life that you put us in charge of Lord but we only do that because we just give it back to you Lord the source of it all so today Lord as we celebrate and we're happy Lord that yes your word has been fulfilled yes but Lord we do so in a manner that we give reverence unto you Lord for this little life Lord we ask your blessings upon this family and this little guy here Lord that he'd be raised in the admonition of fear of the Lord and grow up Lord as your word says the calves of the stall and the Lord spread your gospel to those who are in need granted to us this day Lord as we we do this happily and reverently Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen prayer for your son good morning how are you feeling dear heavenly father I want to thank you for the ultimate blessing the just what we've always prayed for what we've always wanted our beautiful Sun Everett and we just and we just ask you to stay with us and stay with him stay within our household and just help us raise him in your by Your Word by your wishes and uh just thank you for everything that you've ever given us and we'll continue to give all of us amen amen he's going to take after his his great grandpa and be a preacher amen we like that we're going to ask a blessing now on Everett Matthew and and uh this family's been a wonderful blessing and and uh and uh Sister Mary God bless you with beautiful children I know people don't know but that's what you are to me amen Joseph when Tim quoted it had made special heart to me so let's ask our blessing this is where we all pray together the whole congregation let's pray for this young child as he enters our our midst he's part of our responsibility let's always keep this family in prayer our gracious family as little Everett sings out praise to you this morning Lord is calling on your name We join in and call on a blessing to him this family may they always walk according to your word may your grace and your mercy be their portion Camp your angels about them and protect them we ask these things in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you God bless you it is great grandma what do you think of that huh that's something in it God bless you amen that's the best part of being a pastor right there you love the Lord this morning amen amen we're just going to have a time of Fellowship in his word this morning you love his word let's stand together and read one Short scripture and then we're going to go through some scriptures uh listen to our messenger and and just have a time this morning uh trying to build our faith so let's go to one of the great scriptures that uh we have we're going to read two little scriptures out of Hebrews the 11th chapter and and we're gonna just trust that the the that this morning that in the Simplicity of God's word that you'll take strength and faith and that you can see this morning what a wonderful way that God has made for you he he's he's done it so perfectly that you can't mess it up amen so let's read in Hebrews as Hebrews the 11th uh chapter it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen so we know that faith is something real and then we come to the sixth verse of the same chapter but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen you may be seated uh I I usually like to play uh the portion of message that we want to speak on uh first but I think I'm going to wait and play it at the end so that as you hear the uh our messenger speak to us that you can reach out and grab hold of it and uh so I'd like to talk this morning if we could if I was to have a sermon title and it would be called faith in our election faith in our election and we want to talk about our election this morning and I'd like to do this by if you wouldn't mind turning with me into the gospel of Saint John and the 15th chapter of the Gospel of Saint John and I'd like to read these scriptures and go through these scriptures together with us this morning now your election is the greatest possession that you have if I could uh re-quote or re-word by no means I have the authority or the ability to do it but just this shed light Jesus says when a man finds a pearl of great price I would like to insert the word election when a man finds his election he sells all that he has uh when he finds his election a treasure buried in the field the greatest possession that you have is your election it's it's it it's it means more to us than anything that that we could realize and and we want to talk about that today about election what it means to you and the great things and so I'd like to start in the 15th chapter of this Gospel of John and start reading the this scripture and and we'll read down a few verses but you've got to understand now this is Jesus talking to his elect he makes references to things that are there as we read this you'll see but now he's this is a special a special message to his elect and when Jesus spoke here he knew that he wasn't just speaking to those that was in front of him he knew he was speaking to you we know we were on his mind we know that we were on his heart he knew he knew whom he was going to Calvary for and so as we expound on this this morning we just uh we we want to do it as a family as as a body no big eyes no little ears uh just the the grace of God uh uh on our behalf speaking to our hearts so let's start and read he says I am the True Vine amen which would tell us that there's false fines there's other places for you to draw strength and life from but he says I'm the True Vine I'm the true place I'm the True Vine so that we don't we we don't want to be drawing a life from something that's not true he says and so he says and my father is the husband so he's the one that's orchestrating it right he's the one that's looking over it he's the one that's in charge of it every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purged it that it may bring forth more fruit so we're not weary and well doing we're not discouraged when we're chastised all that he loves he chastises and he corrects but there's got to be one thing that's sure you understand because you can't be corrected and uh and Fall to Pieces now I spanked my children I may have spanked them too hard I I didn't know how to raise children that's why I'm glad to be a grandpa because now I know how to raise children give them whatever they want and you're happy God don't have grandchildren okay he has children so if you're not if you don't have faith in your election every time that your Chast dies or rebuke you can't go back and and and say you know I don't every time my kids I spank my kids they didn't run up to me and say am I your child you sure I belong in this house you know what I mean now they may have thought it but I don't know but you can't go to Pieces every time because he tells you I can Purge you that you might be more fruitful hey he might take something from you that you really enjoy doing it doesn't mean that sin but he wants to make you more fruitful he wants you to he he we he's a god of fruit that's what he wants so he'll do whatever is best the father will to make you more abundant and more fruitful and because he rewards according to those things so he's a great God he says and every he says that that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you oh that's a long sermon you're clean through the word you didn't make yourself clean you couldn't have thought of the things that he taught you couldn't have come up with it it's not in your nature to turn the other cheek you wouldn't want The Gospel According to David McGarry if someone Smite you on the cheek go get a bigger hammer I mean that would it would be chaos you know what I mean it would be every every uh every man for himself you know what I mean uh my gospel would be do unto others before they do unto you you know that what kind of chaos but you couldn't even come up with the things that he said but he said you are clean through the word which I preached to you he said this is the secret the Secret's my word my secret the secret to life the secret to success the secret to everything is the word that I've taught you that's what cleanses you cling to that word read your Bibles to uh fellowship with his brother Mike said have communion with them that it's beautiful wait wait on his spirit you know his spirits is this real spirit it's a real presence it's something that you can sense you you can know when he's there you can know when he comes by you can you you can know that when you take your scriptures don't just read it intellectually read the scripture then wait on the Lord wait on the spirit of the Lord wait till it comes down it's a good idea before you make decisions before you talk to people before you enter into interviews before you go to school take a moment sit still wait for that peace to come wait for the presence to come wait for that anointing to come say oh because why his word he says he says ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself hold that there when we get to this a little bit later you can't do it yourself there's something that's going to do it for you oh I want to jump right ahead you know it's hard for me I don't I don't like building the things I like just saying like it is right now but look we want to lay it in the word this morning okay you can't do it in yourself so there's got to be some Source someplace that's going to bring you to what you want to be that's our battle we want to be one thing but we realize we're something else and it's what that we're not has more effect on us than what we should than what our hearts desire should be so we don't want to base our faith in the present reality of our weakness we want to build our faith in the promises of God's word and the word that cleans us and made us clean think of that now what is going what is the most solid thing what he said is going to be or what is because faith is the substance of things what hope for but not yet seen in other words I don't see a good Christian I don't see it but the word of God said that I'm going to be a good Christian now what am I going to put my faith in what I see or what I hope for you I'm going to put it in what I hope for what I want to be so we as we read it says and we keep going abide in me and I in you the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me now we want to really come down this morning to what does that mean when you abide in him what are you abiding in abiding what are you holding on to what is your resting place because Faith final resting place is what the word so if your faith abides it abides in the word it not abide in your feelings it doesn't abide the in in the voices around you it doesn't abide in what seems to be evident and pure fact even fact that can be proven but God don't deal with fact why because he's a creator when that nurses begin to not uh in any way uh evil but just the prophets God said because of her training when that person had such low blood pressure and they were so sick and there was just no medical evidence at all that they could come up and the prophet of God Walks In by vision well what's a vision why does it have to be a vision because it's got to be someplace that nobody else can see nurse he can see where you couldn't see he could know what you couldn't know you couldn't know it by the senses you couldn't know by reasoning the inner conscious beings he knew it because he saw it and what God showed him was what was real so he comes back and he says walks in the room he says you'll live the nurse says don't tell them that there's never been a case there's never been this it's over and the prophet of God prays for this little person and and the parents go to rejoicing and she said why are you giving these people false hope you know isn't it funny some people just they they just try to Rob your faith you're looking at certain death and they the only hope that you have is faith and they'll take that away from you you just wish you'd switch places you could just go and take them and put them there on the death bed now do you want to have some hope There's Hope in God's word and and so they got up and rejoiced and they ran over there and and the man said there's just a nurse we understand you're looking at the charts you're looking at the instruments you're looking at the medical evidence you're looking at everything you can see everything that's reasonable Faith goes beyond reason you look at all these things and you look at this and you say well this is the way that it is the way that it is is the way that he says it is that what that's what it is that's the final place that's where it ends up that's the word of God that's how it is I don't care I don't care what he says is eternal so he said it and she said but we're looking at a promise now remember that we're looking at a promise we're looking at what that he said what is the promise of our election let's continue if a man Abide a spirit if a man abideth not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned now this is what he's telling here so I want you to understand he's creating a law of contrast this is what happens to those that abide and this is what happens to those that don't abide let me add what I'm trying to drive home this morning this is what happens to the elected this is what happens to the unelected remember our term of faith in your election if you abide in me seven and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you what a promise what a uh what a thing to add to the law of contrast these people are being cast Into the Fire but you elected can ask what you will how many of you have asked for a loved one how many of you have asked for your children and God has answered your prayer it was how wonderful it is you shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples so it's hard sometimes for us to pick up the responsibility that goes with the election and and we could build on that sermon there for a long time you know I'm not a man of eloquent words and and you know that but there's a responsibility uh meant some maybe many of you maybe in life has got a scholarship or something uh an athletic scholarship or an education scholarship well they they say to you they say okay I'm going to give you four years of college well you know that that ain't a free pass you got to keep your grades up you know what I mean if you're on a some form of sports scholarship you have to make practices you have to do that you can relinquish your practice you can lose your scholarship because you didn't uh keep it that that's in the carnal but it's still a good understanding for us to realize that there's responsibilities that go with the election it glorifies the Father in Heaven if you're fruitful amen that you bear much fruit we we will always want that to have that thing the prophet of God made this statement in three kinds of Believers he said but just remember God is always on the scene he's right there ready at any time so he's always there doing his part he's never forsaken you right he's picked you he started with you he stayed with you so he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end so we have the the author of our faith he's not only the author of our faith but he's the finisher of the faith he's the author and the finisher of our faith let's bring that back down to what we're trying to say this morning about faith in our election he's the author of our election he's the finisher of our election now Jesus said I I could speak to my father and straightway he would send me 12 Legions of angels oh what would one Angel do see but you see he could he could send 12 Legions of angels just at his command but he had a job to do he had something to do he had to go through with that we know he's speaking of calvary you've got something to do yeah now what is it that pleases God faith you have something to believe you've got something to believe this morning something that you've got to settle except and believe and act on you've got something for you to do you may have some heartaches and some troubles you may have some disappointments but do we pray to shun them no Lord take me through them whatever they is whatever it is don't let me escape them if you're set if they're set for me just give me Grace to go through that that's all man we're not trying to run we're going to take whatever comes our way as Christians is there hard times that come our way sometimes yes but it hasn't even entered into the hearts of men that the present suffering of this world is not worthy to be compared to the joy that the Lord has oh this morning if I could ever just in my life and if I could ever say the words to you somehow uh through the preaching of the word or a word of encouragement not to look back to leave those things which are behind behind and press for a higher calling press for what's out ahead of us that is as we continue to go this morning as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue in my love this this is this is the gospel to the elect this is to the called out this is to The Chosen he's he's telling the people that aren't elected that aren't fruitful they're going to be gathered up and burned but he's not talking about you he's talking about you being fruitful let me attributes the statue of a perfect man the patience the kindness the fruits of the spirit let those things embellish your life let them let them flow out of you when there's some when you recognize something in your life uh you you that old prickly pear that old sour spirit that old judgmental attitude that old feeling that's when you rest you stop right there say Lord this isn't you you know Come Holy Spirit Lord I'm going to stop right here am I lift my hands and say Lord come around me fill me with your goodness fill me with your presence take this attitude from me it's just going to hurt me it's just going to hurt other people I I don't need to be like this why because I'm in the palm of your hand and nothing can pluck me out of the palm of your hand yeah you started at work in me you'll finish it Lord I I know I just don't need to let this world make me upset why do we want to put our Treasures where the the where the thief can come in and take them the Lord said on the story of Treasures in Heaven please place your reward to where you're going why do people save up for retirement they put all this money in a retirement fund they put all this money up there they invest all this money because they hope they're going to old age they don't have no guarantee right but they set money aside whole mankind setting money aside based on the fact that when they get old that there will be something there to take care of them I had a good friend dear friend of mine he lived in a trailer hit here hardly spend any money he was saving for retirement because when he grew up his family his grandparents were poor and they died poor and he didn't want to do that didn't want to go to a rest home and didn't want to go and nurture home he wanted any source of all his money up and passed away sometime in his 50s I don't want to put my treasures there if he lets me live to be a hundred he'll take care of me I have a mother that's a hundred she's not wealthy she's not rich she's got everything she has she's surrounded by family that loves her she's content I don't want to be crowned with a gripy old Spirit a crabby old person you know and and not get out of my way you know and and full of bitterness to everybody that's no Spirit of life oh I want the love of God to be shed abroad in My Heart by the spirit I want people to know there's hope you know uh you know I'll be 73 October 27th of this year I hope you got that that was an announcement uh I I want I want to know that I'm in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck me out we're just going to move quickly now if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's commandment and abiding his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you or even David Cried Out return unto me the joy of my salvation may I say it like this this morning to Us return unto me the joy of my election friends yeah and that your joy might be full so he's asking two things here that that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full uh-huh I want to be full of joy what do we call it in the scriptures joy unspeakable he said these things have been spoken to you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be filled this is my commandment that ye love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friend ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for a servant knoweth not what his Lord does but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you glory you talk about the opening of the seals you talk about the mysteries of God being fulfilled you talk about the things that was hid from from the ages just think what he's done the great blessings that he's poured out to us the the revelations that you have the understandings that God getting you because according to the promises of God's word he sent forth a messenger in this age he wasn't he wasn't here to build churches he wasn't here to to start an organization he went everywhere freely wherever the door was opened he went and gave him the words of Hope the understanding the truth of the Gospel so men wouldn't be anchored in the wisdom of man the interpretation of men I don't know why people will take a carnal explanation of the scripture and the person that's giving the explanation doesn't have one bit of Faith to make any of the promises of God come to pass because they've connected with reasoning who's the first person in the scripture that ever connected with reasoning it was Eve it's a cause of everything the death of faith is reasoning you're going to reason it you're going to try to figure it out you're going to try to understand it forget it you don't have the mind the ability the understanding the carnal mind is enmity with God the carnal mind is death but the spiritual mind is life and freedom you can't figure it out you'll never come up with the answer why me I don't even know why you you know I have to have a lot of faith in your election sometimes let's read here I don't call you servant but I've called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you now this is where I want to anchor for just a few moments now and I read all this to build to this scripture ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit so now we have the law of contrast right he said those who are not fruitful those who don't abide in me they'll be cast Into the Fire and now he lays that so that raises a question in your mind but now he's going to come back and solve that question this is what he has got to put to rest and this is what every single one of us in this room this morning has got to finally put to rest no preacher no law no nothing can ever come and attack you I'm tired of Ministries that beat down the people make them feel like sinners try to steal their election and try to give them some Litany of rules to follow all it does is make for starchy religion you know what starts to happen if the preacher dances everybody dances if someone screams and shouts everybody in the building feels if I don't scream and shout I'm not part of it it robs all the individualness out of it it robs the personal experience out of it it turns it into a religion it turns it into some sort of uh uh informal formal worship everything becomes group God didn't save a group he saved individuals then God placed those individuals in a body according to his good pleasure according to his God's word and he gave each one of those members in that body a Ministry to help every other member in that body it's that simple but we're talking about this morning having faith in your election and we're going to listen to 15 minutes here in just a moment if you'll be patient with me ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever ye shall ask of of the father in my name he may give it to you I want to lay this election down for a moment oh good to see you my brother it's been a while take your chair and bring your chair here and set it right here Dylan you take your chair and set it on that side you sit here now you look at this situation here you got two people right now if you give me the moment in this little drama to be God now I could come up with some scripture if you need to okay but uh in in this case uh the scripture said ye are Gods right so okay uh I can I can get some quotes uh to just show you that I'm not out of place now I'm God and I say I've elected you to be the greatest basketball player that ever played in the NBA how tall are you I am 5'7 five seven well how much do you weigh 140 pounds pretty scrawny have you ever played basketball I mean are you like been on a team or anything yeah yeah okay so you think you're pretty good you think you can make the MBA no he don't but this guy how tall are you six three you play a lot of basketball frequently you pretty good is that the way you used to think did you think you could have made the MBA now reason tells you what he's the guy okay let's go to another place in scripture I'm sorry brother yeah I've got you in the negative role but I I hope I've proven my undying love for you how about David and Goliath right all through scripture I mean if we were to play the part if we were going to do a little Sunday school skit you would have him be Goliath and you would have him beat David because that's all in your natural mind if we were to pick Samson this would be Samson didn't know that would be Samson this would be Goliath right now if I was to pick a bodyguard to go someplace with me Dylan I'm sorry son but I wouldn't pick you you know what I mean if we were going to go somewhere you know who I'm taking right I'm taking this this guy here it makes more sense reason tells me to take him right right if I have something big and heavy to pick up right reason tells me to take him every instance that I approach that I make a judgment on and reasoning on I go after what I perceive to be my answer so now let's take this I I as God I've elected Dylan to be an astronaut so I go to him and I say I'm I'm gonna let you go back I've embarrassed you enough for one day but you know me right there will be another opportunity all right Dylan you're going to be an astronaut why is he going to be an astronaut because I said so I've elected him to be an astronaut no he he doesn't perceive himself as an astronaut he doesn't know how he's going to get to West Point he doesn't know how he's going to get in Nassau he doesn't know how he's going to get in that capsule there is no no way that he can perceive that he is going to be an astronaut sit in a capsule and go to the Moon no the people have already been to the Moon you are going to Mars as God I've elected you to go to Mars now how is he going to get to Mars what is the very thing that's putting him on Mars the fact that I elected him so he said I have chosen you and I have four ordained you to go to Mars now he can say okay now boy I better get into college I better brush up on my math I better make call the senator and make an application for West Point he can put up but now he's putting his Trust and the only thing he needs to have faith in is the election that's all that determines it that settles it it's the election if I've chosen him and I've elected him and I'm the creator of Heaven and Earth all things are subject to me I can make a way where there's no way I'm the Waymaker what is the only thing he has to have faith in come on is the election because it's the election that's going to provide for him everything that he has need of to bring him to what I've chosen him to be aren't you glad I'm not sending you to Mars okay thank you what's our trust in our trust is in the in the election what does it say in Romans 9. it's such a great scripture let's just run let's just look there and read it Romans 9 and 10. when I'm trying to get this morning is for us not to look around not to look at our works not to look at our Deeds not to look at what we think we sh we should be living how we should be living not not to look at anything but to settle on one thing he has elected me because everything I have need of all the Forgiveness of my sins all the being lifted up when I fall down all the mud that I have caked on me my election is what takes care of it all if you can do one thing for your salvation Jesus Christ died in vain you've got to know you're elected your whole life screams at you and says You're Not Elected looks back look what you've done look at how stupid you are look at how ugly you are look at how clumsy you are look at how socially inept you are there's not one thing about you that marriage anything he's the vine you're the branches you can do nothing without him I've ordained you to be fruitful Romans and not only this but when Rebecca also having conceived by one even our father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand the purpose of God according to election what he has purposed might stand not by good not by evil not by works not by failure one thing only I chose you I put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life you're mine no matter what the preachers say no matter what the church says they can't put you out they can't take your name off the Lamb's Book of Life they can't change the will of the father in beginning no man can change your election thank the Lord so what am I going to trust in what's my faith in because my election has every Victory I need the very things that I want to overcome in my life my failures my election is what has the substance to overcome my deficiency I cannot go out and make myself better and then become elected when did he elect you before there ever was a star before there ever was anything anywhere he elected you he chose you he puts your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he eternally secured you so now this is what he's saying I forordained it I am going to make you whether you fight it like Paul fighter Paul's out killing the very Church he's elected to be a part of but what did Paul find out he found out he was elected Paul why do you kick against the prey who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom you persecute I'm going to show you the things you have to suffer for my namesake you don't think Paul was at rest with his suffering he says I've been scourged I've been thrown in prison I've been stoned I've done all these things I counted all a joy that I might suffer for Christ he knew he knew he was elected what did he rest in he rested in one thing only one thing is settle it he chose me and because he chose me everything else is going to fall in place my faith is in my election oh I've got long but we'll be out by just a few moments I'm going to just read this scripture for the children not yet being born neither have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth you want to overcome something you want to get better you want to get rid of a sin you know where your answer is it's in your election your election holds the victory if you believe that then you say Lord you've chosen me this part of my life is unfruitful because of my election I believe that you're taking this out of my life I'm not going to trust in the ability for me to get rid of it I'm not going to trust in the ability for me to overcome it I'm not going to trust it's got more power than I've got but there's one thing I've settled on there's one thing I know I'm elected and because I'm elected I'm trusting that in an election and that election possesses my victory to overcome that yeah but if I don't believe in that election if I don't have faith in the fact that I'm chosen if you doubt whether you're elected or chosen you'll be in a forever battle you've got to settle it I could give you every evidence of the election why do we listen to Satan when we know he's the father of lies and there's no truth in them I don't have the vocabulary or the preaching style this morning to come forth in my heart because I don't want you to Anchor in Emotion I don't want you to Anchor in the excitement of it I want it to soak down according to God's word you've got to have faith in your election your election is what does everything for you I am the vine ye are the branches without me you can do nothing you have to abide in me you have to abide in my election my election will make you fruitful my election will take care of you my election will forgive your sins my election will deliver you of your fault I am going to make you what I promised I would make you you don't look like an astronaut but I said you're going to be an astronaut therefore you're going to be an astronaut you say well I don't want to be an astronaut he'll change that too that's right you think I want to be a preacher I don't even think I like people but he changed that I tried to use every single excuse that I could I I I don't have social skills I I don't have facial recognition disorder I've got add you know what I mean everything about it but you know what he says he says I chose you my grace is sufficient my strength is made perfect in weakness I'll make a way I'll take care of it you just believe one thing just believe it you already aren't confess but how long do you halt between two opinions as for me and my house we're going to serve God you've got to settle it you think you're going to choose the world no you're not no he'll seek the hound dogs of Hell after you you're not going to get nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand elect according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth him that elected I said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger and as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated what shall we say then is God therefore unright unrighteous with God God forbid for he saidth unto Moses I have mercy on whom I'll have mercy and I'll have compassion on whom I'll have compassion so then it is not him that willeth nor him that runeth but of God that showeth Mercy I want to play for you and if if you need to go I I totally understand uh this will be a good time but we're going to listen to 15 minutes of perfect faith now as we read this I want you to see what the prophet of God is expressing really what perfect faith is perfect Faith isn't the faith that operates the promises perfect faith is not the faith that makes you well it's like Sin Sin isn't drinking smoking it's the attributes of unbelief fruit and works they're the attribute of those who have perfect faith in their elections perfect faith is oh I can take this promise and work it I can take that promise and work it I can go do this work I can do work no perfect faith is whether you never do a work in your life but you have 100 faith in your election and that's what Satan's been trying to rob a lot of us of we look at ourselves in the mirror and we want to see the election there the election is in him he made the election when you believe that you could be looking at somebody that has got two horns and a fork tail holding a pitchfork but if you believe I've been elected he will transform that you'll lose your horns you'll lose your fork you'll lose your tail you lose your red coat and all of a sudden a Christian is going to emerge by your work by works no by him that calleth him that chose just like he could take Dylan and transform him into an astronaut if that was his will he can take you because he purposed it I have chosen you you didn't choose me I have ordained you to whatever works that it is it will not fail so Faith perfect faith what you're believing God is you first got to believe that God has elected you if you have any doubt in that you are stuck you can't go to the left you can't go to the right you can't be a good sinner and you can't be a good Christian what have you become what is the curse of lady osia lukewarm I would that you were hot or cold because you're lukewarm I've Got The Spill thee out of my mouth there's only one thing that can take you out of that condition is when you can hear the word of God because my word has made you clean and you can put Faith in what he said and you're going to hear our messenger make these turn this these stains therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that can't we rely upon what God made us he says now the only thing you have to do then is to have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are let's listen to this 15 minutes we'll be closed there'll be communion tonight so what we'll do with our Sunday schools will start Sunday school right at five o'clock and then it should be done by the time we have communion and the brothers can fix the back room is everybody okay you got 15 minutes to listen to the messenger amen let's settle it I hope when you walk out of here today that you'll come to one conclusion I'm elected now what you do with that election we can preach on that another time but until that questions answered we're in lady osia we're in a lady you'll see a attitude we're in a lady you'll see a mindset we're in a ladyocia actions the only thing that's going to rise us out of ladyocia is election the only thing that's going to take us in the Rapture is election the first thing we've got to settle and Believe on is election we must have faith in our election let's let the messenger share it with us in the next few minutes God bless you now Faith being the substance and in there we find out in Hebrews what faith was and what those did do have faith see there's many times that people have faced the day and tomorrow they haven't got it the next day they're stopping and something else for when God wants anchors it and you see it there's nothing ever going to make you move from you're just poking reaching pursuing and pursuing this adventure without Authority you're just trying this and trying this and go to this and run here and run there you haven't got the faith yet but when that is what we call Faith excuse me I want you to thank you I I want you to get this now we the church has got to lift itself in the power of God how we're to close to the end now and I believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make-believe out amen see don't get into something real see it's got to be something that you know if you say uh uh brother Branham uh that isn't the line get our noise how do you do it tonight I'm looking at it or how do you know what you could be wrong my side has always declared to me that that was life see and that's the reason I believe those Visions because it's always declared to me the true spot that comes from the word amen then if he says it that settled it now when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be then you hear it thus half the law see because it's beyond the human thinking it's up into the realm of the large thing but you're standing here just as Divine just as a bridge producing the fruit that's in the Vine see God uses man and man only God doesn't use Machinery God doesn't use groups to man God doesn't use organization God uses individuals always thy faith is the substance and five we understand all those things are done it's not a it's not a imagination it is a substance especially perfect Faith that's what I'm talking on tonight getting into perfect faith it is not an imagination now other people come say oh I got all Faith oh I sure have or are you stand here for them see your very actions prove that you haven't got what you're talking about see if you had faith in where you stand the prayer line what do you do these things for see if you had perfect Faith you'd look right straight to God believe it and walk away and you would you would have no need of coming into a prayer you'd have no need of these things because your faith is done made it so and I see it or what would be the use for me saying I got to put a shirt on I got a shirt on how do you know you got a shirt them well I see it feel it and I know it's that well that's just how real that one's perfect Faith takes the whole you don't need no more praise God it's already done you know it hallelujah how do you do it they tell me so amen that's it see do you get it down one of these that's perfect faith in other words I'm venturing out well I'll go with the Bible say to all the elders let them knowing I want to pray over I know how I'm going and you said well I'm going to be you'll see you're making yourself don't watch how you're going to make yourself just just worked out there he was you just have faith your genuine faith will do it right there your your genuine faith will make us so real to you that look at that little woman with the blood issue she said if I can only touch the border of His Garment I'll be made well if I had as soon as she did she said she felt within herself that her blood issues stopped and she actually proceeded I want to see touched it the truth and stop and stopped Jesus turned and said who touched me that's perfect faith and that same perfect faith and I will touch Jesus Christ just as it did that a woman comes with a perfect face for that time now we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they'd had Christ walking with him but then afterwards Christ was in that amen and so you see it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it it does now you say the disciples didn't have perfect Faith No for they had an epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil out of me and they couldn't do it and the father seen Jesus coming and he said we have brought my son to to your disciples and they could not cure him okay and afterwards the disciples asked Jesus saying why could not we cure him and Jesus said because of a lack of faith and of your unbelief that's right because of your unbelief that I remember they had this house Jesus had given them power the heel was sick to raise the dead he cast out Devils just a few days before that yes they had the power but not the face to use the power now there's the grand Tabernacle there is a church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power amen but you haven't got that Faith to prove it everybody see what it means it takes Faith to move it here I got a shell that a hand loaded I know what it'll do by ballistics like the word but I've got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the power the powder's got the power that's got to have the fire to light it up and the same thing that powers in the shell but it needs space to charge it let's go out that's what it takes the perfect Faith to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit which we have now since he's come upon us amen Faith to ignite to see great things is to the faith something that persisted to you for the Heart full of joy you walk into the sick room knowing exactly what you're going to say walk you never know what's going to happen something's already been redeemed and you know it and you walk in in the name of Jesus Christ rise up from there God pay us alone here you are that's perfect faith if there's these 10 million people stand there say it wouldn't happen you know what's going to happen anyhow because you know it it's going to happen regardless what anybody else says you're the one that got the faith could you imagine Joshua he called the Elders of Israel together and said uh brethren we are the Servants of the Lord I would like for you to say uh ask the Lord is it be all right if uh Ezekiel us a little more sunlight see and hold the son of a walk no he has need of it and without prayer without anything he had need of it and he just commanded the son amen not only in the service of the law yeah but he sent me over here to do this job and I'll do the best I don't know how and the enemy is routing and then I didn't hear if I let the sun go down they'll get together and cause me more trouble stand still [Applause] come down for 24 hours [Applause] [Music] now if the world's turning it holds it up and the Sun stays in the place and it don't run what happened there amen that's right now you make yourself an Infidel because if you say of this and then if you don't see children full of science because they said the world will stop and drop from now on did you say God's words not right then you're an Infidel amen ever what happened that's amazing man I don't know the mechanics of it but it happened amen I don't know the mechanics of the Holy Ghost but I know it fell on me and I I can't tell the mechanics of it but I know the blessings of it that's that's all I care to know about is the blessing of the Holy Ghost and mechanics keyword said that's his secret this boy cannot be healed because the disciples had power Jesus gave them power to heal all men are sickness to cast out Devils to cleans the lepers and to raise the Dead and he gave their power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned Jesus and says well now why couldn't we do it now remember they had the word and the Word was resting and the word told them I'd give you power heaven amen I'll give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them amen see what I mean yeah Jesus had he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen amen so bringing here how long will I suffer you he had Faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing in myself wow he relied upon why you are he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and it was in him and that's giving Faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and here every scriptures tied in the proof that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what God had made him amen and if he did that they can't we rely up on what God made us as believers these times shall follow him that believes he had faith and what he was and if you are a Believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer as you've got faith in God the Bible says over here in uh if our uh if our hearts condemn us then we can have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we happy we have confidence towards God if you want to read that found Saint John 3 21. I got the scripture written down there how many thank you Army First John 3 21. uh notice if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards God but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God so you see you can you automatically know that you're wrong you already make a touch yourself back here a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn me and you know you are a Believer and there's nothing between you and God because that's what you will and know that it'll be given amen because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are amen have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me that David in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I am the bread of life that come from God out of heaven amen I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I have all these things I am that I am and he knew that a perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was ending the word may manifest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest or you are a believer see an agreement is the face of God that moves in you you like that I like when you all right before the how to uh what faith really is knowing who he was without a shadowed doubt he knew he was the son of God he knew it for the word identified the word of God identified who he was he said if I do not to worship my father then don't believe me but if I don't do them Works don't believe me but if I do then please the worst for they are the manifested words or if you just wake up to that a minute you see the word itself identified Who You Are and he says who can condemn me instead in other words who can show me that my life and my words don't fulfill exactly what Messiah should do nobody could say nothing for he was and he had Faith to believe that whatever he said would happen then he turned around and said the words that I do shall you also a little while the world says the more yet you shall because I'll be with you even in you take old thought why she's for safe for it's not you to speak it's that father that dwelleth in you he one does the speaking and stop me it's the father that dwells in me he doeth the word now the identification of the scripture Christians these words says Jesus these signs shall follow them I believe now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a Believer and deny any of this one amen amen you can't do it you're not a believer therefore science can't follow it because you just accept what you want to believe and that's the rest of us you want don't believe but you've got to take the whole thing and believe that's right amen and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs follow them at least amen foreign I just want to say this too many Christians get the cart before the horse they they trying to measure themselves by the signs and wonders I'm not a believer because I don't have the signs and wonders if you believe who you are you believe what the scripture said you are if you believe what he made you could you remember this saying he said he had Faith with his power how did he how did he have faith to do this he believed what the scripture said he was can't you believe the key the whole start to everything the signs the Wonders everything is your final without doubt without question without any unbelief whatsoever I'm elected I'm chosen then all things are possible your Transformations possible signs falling every come will come in its season but until that is settled he's settled who he was first he didn't do one sign in one Wonder without knowing who he was that's perfect Faith get the seed planted first get the Seed Faith planted your election settle it you can come to my office and give me a Litany of your sins and we could spend a few hours comparing sins and I've outsinned you all but that's my sins didn't save me my sins don't make me a better Christian what makes me a Christian election I hope I can settle in with you this morning I hope you can see that's exactly what the prophet thought how did Jesus have this Faith he believed in his election have faith when you walk out of here this morning don't look at yourself settle this one question he chose me he'll take care of me he started the work he'll finish at the end my sheep know my voice he'll not leave me not forsake me nothing can pluck me out of the hand I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I ought to be but if he's elected me I will be everything that he ever purposed I am his workmanship of Christ Jesus for ordained unto good work I have not chosen you have not chosen me I have chosen you and if I were danger that you'll be fruitful let's have faith in our election God bless you [Applause] foreign aren't you happy this morning he chose you he elected you to be his son and his
