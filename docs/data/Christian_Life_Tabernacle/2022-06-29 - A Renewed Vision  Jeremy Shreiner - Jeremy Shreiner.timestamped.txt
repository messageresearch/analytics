[4:08] sad time but i'm going to tell you at
[4:09] the side of a saint
[4:11] there's rejoicing why because you know
[4:13] it's not the end of the story
[4:15] amen i'm so glad
[4:19] this afternoon just trying to get his
[4:22] his heart for this evening i was just
[4:23] dealing you know i'm not really much of
[4:25] an evangelist i try to do whatever the
[4:28] lord asks i'm a pastor so i speak as a
[4:31] pastor a lot of times and tonight i know
[4:33] it's a wednesday and and i'm not talking
[4:36] about time i'm just talking about
[4:38] just want to allow god to talk to your
[4:40] hearts tonight you know
[4:42] i believe that you as a body that you
[4:45] had all of those things great great but
[4:48] if if our if our soul if our heart if we
[4:52] are not into christ heard the voice of
[4:54] god brother troy he he was john the
[4:56] baptist
[4:57] a prophet of god
[5:00] and he's seen all of the miracles and
[5:02] vindications of the word of god right
[5:04] he's seen the miracles he's seen all of
[5:06] those things yet somewhere along the way
[5:08] john's vision became blurred
[5:12] we find in matthew 11 2 it says now when
[5:15] john had heard in the prison the works
[5:18] of christ
[5:20] he sent two of his disciples and said
[5:22] unto them art thou he that should come
[5:25] wait wait a minute
[5:27] did he not see already what who the
[5:29] christ was
[5:31] oh that well you gotta i'll tell you i
[5:33] thought that he i thought that he was
[5:35] the one now now now because he's
[5:37] questioned i guess he's out no john was
[5:39] the called prophet of god
[5:42] but john as a prophet of god
[5:45] had a moment of blurred vision
[5:50] aren't
[5:51] art thou he that should come or do we
[5:54] look for another
[5:56] jesus answered and said unto them go and
[5:58] show john again
[6:01] those things which you or ye do hear and
[6:04] see go show him again what does that
[6:07] tell me brothers and sisters he'd
[6:09] already seen it
[6:11] you've already seen the manifestation of
[6:13] god you've already seen the vindication
[6:15] of his word you have seen the revealing
[6:17] word of god in this hour you have been
[6:19] blessed with the revelation and a vision
[6:22] that the world cannot have
[6:26] amen amen
[6:27] but i'm going to bring you back down to
[6:29] humanity
[6:31] and every now and then you're going to
[6:32] find yourself in a prison
[6:35] of life
[6:36] john didn't do anything wrong to be in
[6:38] that prison
[6:40] john john john wasn't uh he didn't
[6:43] deserve there if you would allow me to
[6:45] save brother david he he wasn't he
[6:47] didn't deserve to be there but he found
[6:49] there because of life he was actually
[6:50] doing the right thing
[6:52] he was actually serving god brothers and
[6:54] sisters he was you ever just said god i
[6:56] went to church
[6:57] god i've done this for you lord i've
[6:59] seen your vindications i've seen this
[7:00] why am i going through this
[7:02] lord i i prayed i read the word and i've
[7:05] done all of these things why am i going
[7:07] through this john hold on
[7:11] he didn't give up though because there
[7:13] was something in him that couldn't give
[7:14] up
[7:16] so he knew who to go ask
[7:19] what did what did he say go and show
[7:21] john again
[7:24] let's see what are we trying to look for
[7:25] something new
[7:28] to stir
[7:29] an emotion
[7:30] why are we trying to look for something
[7:32] new because we've left the word
[7:35] jesus didn't tell him go give him
[7:36] something new he said go show him again
[7:40] the blind received their sight the lame
[7:42] walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf
[7:45] hear the dead are raised up and the poor
[7:47] have the gospel preached to them
[7:50] this is not anything new this is the
[7:52] same word of god a vindication of the of
[7:54] the word of god and now john had a
[7:57] moment to be able to say that's the one
[7:59] i remember thank god so don't come to
[8:02] church discouraged when your vision is
[8:04] blurred but let god speak to you through
[8:06] the word of god that your vision can
[8:09] come open again
[8:11] think about it what brother branham says
[8:12] in 59 and who is this he says when the
[8:15] holy ghost come today it brings the same
[8:18] decisions each one of us are responsible
[8:20] for our decision
[8:23] oh it's not he did it or she made me do
[8:25] it or the devil didn't know we're
[8:26] responsible we must make it it's here by
[8:29] us it's here with us there's no way
[8:31] around it anymore there's nothing we can
[8:33] do about it we have to reject it or
[8:36] receive it listen there's no there's no
[8:38] uh if hands or buts about it you either
[8:40] are serving god or you're not
[8:43] if you are not fully surrendered to the
[8:45] power of god you are leaving yourself
[8:47] open to the enemy
[8:50] oh my the same life that was in christ
[8:52] jesus is in the church today
[8:54] it's performing the same works go and
[8:57] tell john again the things that i have
[8:59] done
[9:00] it's doing the same miracles it's doing
[9:03] everything that he did it's healing the
[9:04] sick raising the dead cleansing the
[9:06] lepers casting out devils preaching the
[9:08] gospel the poor is receiving blessed is
[9:10] he who is not offended
[9:15] brother brown says go show john he said
[9:18] these things that are done
[9:20] john in the prison
[9:22] his eagle eye had filmed over
[9:26] oh bless god we're an eagle yes but
[9:28] every now and then your eagle eye is
[9:30] gonna film over
[9:31] and you're gonna need to find your time
[9:34] with god again you're going to need to
[9:36] find your time with god to say lord i
[9:39] just just show me one more time i'll
[9:41] tell you john if john needed it i'm
[9:44] going to need it
[9:45] if brother branham needed it i'm going
[9:47] to need it
[9:48] hallelujah he said john in the prison
[9:50] his eagle i had filmed over his
[9:52] prophetic eye couldn't see like it once
[9:55] seen
[9:57] but then it could see
[9:59] when he said the lame walk the blind see
[10:03] the death here and blessed is he who is
[10:05] not offended in what i do and if i do
[10:08] not the works of my father then believe
[10:09] me not and if i do the works of my
[10:11] father if you can't believe me believe
[10:12] the works see he didn't belong caged up

[11:52] morning i said joy cometh in the morning
[11:55] if you if you don't believe it i'm just
[11:56] going to stand here and say it's the
[11:58] absolute truth i have had times of of
[12:01] just weeping oh god what what do you
[12:03] have for me what's going on all of these
[12:05] things and god has always proved his
[12:08] word time and time again
[12:11] hallelujah you know i i don't much get
[12:14] on with some of these things but
[12:16] being a pastor and
[12:18] and just you know you want to get the
[12:20] mind of god and i understand there's
[12:22] some pastors that just have it all
[12:23] figured out
[12:24] hallelujah to that
[12:26] maybe brother troy one day i'll get
[12:28] there
[12:29] but i don't have it all figured out
[12:31] i go day by day lord what do you have
[12:33] for me
[12:34] i want you to understand what i'm trying
[12:35] to say i i i don't doesn't mean i don't
[12:37] have confidence in god
[12:39] but i don't have all the answers
[12:41] and there are times things come our way
[12:43] and and and i'll never forget uh i was
[12:46] at family camp one that i think the
[12:48] first family came
[12:49] in over here in marshall area
[12:52] and uh and and i remember i was part of
[12:55] a prayer line
[12:56] and the first prayer line i was ever a
[12:58] part of in the sense of just you know so
[13:00] many together and things and and i was
[13:02] really excited about it i was just
[13:04] enjoying the camaraderie with the
[13:06] brothers
[13:06] brothers that i had never met before it
[13:08] was really refreshing to me and so at
[13:10] the end of the prayer line uh i i
[13:13] remember uh you know some of the
[13:14] ministers went through and i just
[13:15] thought to myself i said i'm going to
[13:17] not squat you know scorch this
[13:18] opportunity just to go before and just
[13:20] ask for a rededication for myself i
[13:22] don't think there's anything wrong with
[13:23] that
[13:24] so i went through and i asked for prayer
[13:26] and i remember god just really touching
[13:28] my heart and and this man comes up to me
[13:30] who i have no no idea at the time who he
[13:34] is
[13:35] i just know he was a minister and and
[13:37] you all know who he is he's actually
[13:38] going to minister now a part of my
[13:39] services brother danny steven he comes
[13:42] up to me for the uh and again i'm trying
[13:45] to point this out that god has a perfect
[13:47] way in many many avenues brother danny
[13:50] comes up to me and again i don't know
[13:51] who he is and i'm just you know glory
[13:54] hallelujah i'm going through that how
[13:55] many ever been that okay i hope so
[13:58] i was just
[13:59] i was on a cloud nine brother and he
[14:02] comes up and he says the lord just spoke
[14:03] to my heart
[14:05] and said for me to tell you that
[14:07] something's fixing to happen in your
[14:08] church
[14:09] and when it happens
[14:11] i want you to know that i will be with
[14:13] you
[14:15] and of course i'm sitting there going
[14:16] woo glory
[14:18] hallelujah you know i had no clue
[14:22] what was fixing to happen
[14:23] and i remember going home and we had
[14:25] some circumstances come up and
[14:27] and uh uh when the when the moment
[14:31] happened
[14:32] i remember going to the office in my
[14:34] office and i remember
[14:35] laying out on the floor
[14:38] and i was weeping so much uncontrollably
[14:41] before god
[14:42] god what did i do wrong
[14:44] lord where what you know i and i was
[14:46] placing all the i was placing it all on
[14:48] myself
[14:50] and forgetting the promises of god
[14:53] and and i was i was i was going through
[14:56] a john moment i was human i'm human and
[14:59] i was crying out before the lord lord
[15:01] what you know show me the way what did i
[15:03] do lord
[15:04] it's all my fault all of these things
[15:06] and all of a sudden
[15:09] in my heart
[15:11] he said remember i told you i'd be with
[15:13] you
[15:16] you never had just something you know
[15:18] you try to tell your kids dry it up and
[15:20] they don't dry it up
[15:22] well father god said dry it up
[15:25] and instantly
[15:26] it quickened in my heart this is that
[15:28] moment
[15:29] i stood up went over to my chair sat in
[15:32] that chair and i texted brother dan said
[15:34] brother danny
[15:35] what god spoke to you has happened and i
[15:37] want to say thank you for listening to
[15:39] the lord
[15:40] it's what i needed at that moment
[15:42] you see god had given at that moment now
[15:45] i want to tell you something that we
[15:46] don't live always for that
[15:49] you follow what i'm saying but god in
[15:51] our this hour does give us a vision
[15:55] and that there are times that god uses
[15:57] people in the assembly it doesn't always
[16:00] have to be a minister but have you ever
[16:03] just been sitting in the church and
[16:05] somebody was praying or somebody was
[16:07] sitting there and god began to deal with
[16:09] your heart would you just go and pray
[16:11] for him oh but then satan comes oh what
[16:13] will they think of me oh what about this
[16:15] what about that i'm going to tell you
[16:17] what that's the moment you immediately
[16:18] get up and you go do what god says to do
[16:21] god has given us an eagle vision let's
[16:24] use it for his glory
[16:27] you've got to be reminded that if god
[16:29] called you the song says he didn't bring
[16:31] us this far to leave us
[16:32] our vision must be renewed
[16:35] and i can tell you and i can brothers
[16:37] and sisters i can go time and time again
[16:40] where god
[16:41] where i was going through something as a
[16:43] pastor and god would send a minister or
[16:45] a pastor uh along my way and they would
[16:49] give me maybe maybe not even prophecy
[16:51] but that god would allow them to say
[16:53] something that would speak right to the
[16:55] moment
[16:57] and i'd be like god why why don't i
[16:59] learn
[17:02] why don't i learn that you're there
[17:05] you say why are you telling us this
[17:06] because i want you to know that we all
[17:08] go through these moments and no matter
[17:10] how many times god vindicates his word
[17:13] to us there's going to be times that
[17:14] we're going to be going through life and
[17:17] let me tell you god is telling you
[17:18] tonight to stop
[17:20] just stop for a moment

[18:14] let us stop fighting a fight that's
[18:16] already been won

[18:32] that there are false doctrines don't get
[18:34] me wrong and we've got to stand on the
[18:35] word for those things but let's not be
[18:38] let's be careful

[19:37] show unto the heirs of promise the
[19:39] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[19:42] by an oath
[19:43] can i read this in a different uh
[19:46] and a different uh i don't know what the
[19:48] word is that i'm thinking of here but
[19:49] god wanted to prove
[19:51] that his promise was true
[19:53] he wanted to prove this to those who
[19:56] would get what he promised
[19:58] he wanted them to understand clearly
[20:02] i don't want to just be here tonight and
[20:04] say oh i understand and still have a
[20:07] clouded vision
[20:08] but he said i have sent to you a message
[20:11] i have sent to you a messenger that
[20:14] clearly vindicated my word he did not
[20:17] pull you from the word of god he pointed
[20:19] you to the word of god anybody can have
[20:22] this bible but you've got to be an eagle
[20:25] to see it clearly
[20:27] lord let it be a clear vision to this
[20:29] church let it be a clear vision to the
[20:31] bride of jesus christ let us rise up
[20:34] from our playing and all of the things
[20:36] of the word and come back to the word of
[20:38] god let there be a vision in the body of
[20:41] jesus christ lord i want to see your
[20:44] word more clearly
[20:46] not because i want to outdo you
[20:49] not because i want to out preach you
[20:51] not because i want to out vision you or
[20:53] out to prophesy you or out tongue you or
[20:56] outward you but because we need to bind
[20:58] together with the word of god we as
[21:00] eagles need to help other eagles out
[21:03] you know there's going to be times
[21:04] eagles are on the ground there's going
[21:06] to be times eagles are on the fence and
[21:08] they've just been fighting and bickering
[21:10] and going against one another and
[21:12] they're weak they don't have the
[21:13] strength i believe that there would be
[21:15] an eagle tonight that would fly over
[21:17] them and throw them down some meat of
[21:18] the word of god
[21:20] oh i'm going to tell you what there have
[21:21] been times that i was on the ground
[21:24] brother troy i was struggling
[21:26] i i didn't know brother david where to
[21:28] go from there i didn't know what to do
[21:30] and i was weak i couldn't soar the
[21:32] heights brother but i'm so glad somebody
[21:34] came along and threw me down some meat
[21:37] and i had a choice then brothers and
[21:39] sisters whether i was gonna eat it or
[21:41] not listen meat is not always liv you
[21:44] know we have to be careful we need to
[21:45] encourage one another and not put one
[21:47] another down it's not about going to
[21:49] someone and say you just need a little
[21:51] more faith that's not meat that's flesh
[21:55] you'll just put it where you want to put
[21:57] it there it's the same same but it's not
[21:58] the same but we need to come and say i
[22:00] want you to know that you can make it
[22:03] you're a son you're a daughter of god
[22:05] it's time that we get out of the ground
[22:07] off the ground of circumstance start
[22:10] eating back on this word come on put on
[22:12] oh some of the message of the word of
[22:14] god hear that voice crying out again
[22:17] calling you from that barnyard calling
[22:19] you from those doubts and calling you to
[22:21] a hype that no other bird was intended
[22:26] listen they know you can see something
[22:29] they know you have something
[22:31] but they can't figure it out
[22:34] and you can't make them figure it out
[22:38] and we should never come to a point
[22:41] where we put them down either
[22:44] you never seen your prophet do that
[22:49] let our vision have purpose tonight
[22:52] isaiah 40 28 hast thou not known
[22:55] hast thou not heard
[22:58] that the everlasting god the lord the
[23:00] creator of the ends of the earth
[23:02] fainteth not
[23:04] neither is weary
[23:07] there is no searching of his
[23:09] understanding
[23:11] he giveth power to the faint and to them
[23:14] that have no might
[23:15] he increases
[23:17] strength
[23:18] i don't know about you but that does
[23:20] something for me
[23:21] why because i have found myself brother
[23:23] davey in a moment of weakness and doubt
[23:25] and question
[23:27] and i was weak and i needed it but the
[23:29] word says he's going to give power to me
[23:31] even the use
[23:36] shall faint and be weary
[23:38] and the young men shall utterly fall
[23:43] but they
[23:44] listen this is more than a song
[23:47] but they that wait
[23:49] on the lord
[23:51] shall renew
[23:54] their strength they shall mount up with
[23:57] wings as eagles they shall run
[23:59] and not be weary they shall walk
[24:02] and not thank god
[24:04] renew our vision tonight you say you you
[24:08] may be weary tonight from the journey
[24:11] and listen i'm not just putting any
[24:13] amount of discouragement on you
[24:15] but i believe that there's times that
[24:16] we've got to be real with one another
[24:18] that we need
[24:20] a refreshing
[24:22] and i want you to know that i am not
[24:24] dealing with just the emotion of your
[24:26] flesh but that soul
[24:29] needs a refreshing
[24:32] and it's got to be more than a song
[24:35] it's got to be more
[24:37] than just a a a moment of prayer of
[24:40] laying on of hands i'm not getting rid
[24:42] of those things i still believe in those
[24:43] things but it's got to be something what
[24:46] happened to the word of god being
[24:48] ministered and they were pricked in
[24:50] their hearts
[24:51] they were pricked why because they were
[24:53] told you were the ones that crucified
[24:55] him you were the ones that were in error
[24:58] you know there was other times in the
[24:59] bible just speaking about this with
[25:01] brother davey there were other times in
[25:02] the bible as well where they were
[25:03] pricked in their hearts and then there
[25:05] became gnashing of teeth
[25:10] who are you brother david to preach that
[25:13] word of god
[25:15] well i'm
[25:16] brother david
[25:18] and i've been called
[25:20] to preach it
[25:22] now listen if brother david gets off the
[25:23] word then what were you going to do
[25:24] you're going to go tell everyone about
[25:26] it or you're going to pray for him i
[25:28] hope you don't mind me using you brother
[25:29] david
[25:30] i'm going to go into anyhow and then you
[25:32] can crucify me for it later
[25:36] that's what we're doing
[25:38] what happened to getting on our knees
[25:40] and praying for the ministry
[25:42] what happened we're getting on our knees
[25:43] i'm praying for the song leader and the
[25:45] musicians
[25:47] hey we're we're human we make mistakes
[25:49] we sometimes get in our listen i want to
[25:51] remind you in case you forgot just ask
[25:53] your spouse to slap you one time and you
[25:55] will be reminded that you are a human
[25:56] being and if you don't have a spouse
[25:58] don't ask me i'll come and slap you
[26:00] right now to remind you that you are a
[26:02] human being and you're gonna hurt and
[26:03] you hurt and you have pain and you have
[26:05] agony so you are in the flesh
[26:10] that did hurt
[26:12] you're in the flesh
[26:14] oh but bless god
[26:16] yes bless the lord
[26:18] o my soul and all that is within me
[26:20] bless his holy name
[26:22] but none of this blessed god religious
[26:24] mentality and attitude you're human you
[26:27] are a man in need of a savior you are a
[26:29] sister in need of a savior we are a
[26:32] church in need of a savior and it
[26:34] doesn't hurt to come before him and say
[26:36] god i just need a refreshing
[26:39] i i've been getting my eyes off of the
[26:41] promise
[26:43] listen john didn't john did not leave
[26:46] can i allow me to say john didn't leave
[26:48] the message
[26:50] john john didn't want to walk away
[26:53] john john i believe john's heart was
[26:55] right would you just bear with me i
[26:56] believe those things but he got clouded
[27:00] his vision got clouded and he just
[27:03] needed to be reminded
[27:04] that he was the one
[27:06] and so i don't care how many times
[27:08] you've had your cloud 9 moments and how
[27:10] many times the word has been revealed to
[27:12] you as long as you're in this flesh
[27:14] you're still going to need moments of
[27:16] renewal you're going to need moments and
[27:18] times of reminding god i just need to
[27:20] know that you're there and that's why
[27:22] the song leading is there that's why the
[27:24] worship is there that's why songs are
[27:26] there to remind us of his blessings and
[27:28] what he's done and when the word is
[27:30] coming forth it's what is it doing it's
[27:32] reminding us of all of the things of god
[27:36] you may be weary tonight from your
[27:38] journey but god knows it
[27:42] i think very shortly
[27:44] ver very quickly of two men
[27:47] that were walking
[27:49] on the road to emmaus
[27:52] and
[27:53] we find that these two men as they were
[27:55] walking on the road to emmaus that they
[27:57] actually were leaving what they were
[27:58] told to do
[28:01] brother branham uses it in a sign he
[28:02] said they were backsliding
[28:06] we only remember and i don't remember
[28:08] the name right now but we remember that
[28:09] there's one name that was mentioned i
[28:11] think it was cleopas
[28:14] we don't know the other one so really
[28:16] when it comes down to it they were
[28:17] really an unknown they're really unknown
[28:21] brother josh they just they just i mean
[28:23] who were these two men
[28:25] and i wanted to read i want to leave you
[28:27] with this i want you to i want you to
[28:29] know because satan likes to make you
[28:30] feel like you're inadequate
[28:32] like you're nothing
[28:35] you've been at times of backsliding
[28:38] sitting in a pew
[28:40] listening to the word of god
[28:42] and because of circumstances because it
[28:45] didn't go the way you thought it did we
[28:47] should have
[28:48] you started walking away notice when
[28:50] they were walking away they were still
[28:51] talking about them so their heart was
[28:53] still wanting it to be true
[28:55] but they had because of their haste
[28:58] because it didn't happen as quick as
[29:00] they thought it would happen because it
[29:01] didn't happen in their plan
[29:03] as they thought it should be
[29:05] they were discouraged and they were
[29:07] walking away
[29:10] and then all of a sudden in fact i
[29:12] believe it was even mentioned in the
[29:13] prayer tonight
[29:15] when we leave this place
[29:17] we can say did not our hearts burn
[29:18] within us
[29:20] she walked and talked with us along the
[29:21] way
[29:22] brother troy two backsliding men walking
[29:26] away
[29:27] on the greatest day
[29:29] brother matthew of history
[29:32] you say what do you mean the greatest
[29:33] day of history
[29:35] without resurrection
[29:37] we wouldn't be here today
[29:39] on the greatest day of history when
[29:41] jesus could have went to the the king's
[29:44] palaces and said i told you so when he
[29:46] could have went anywhere he and he could
[29:49] have been in the palaces and he could
[29:50] have been here and he could have been
[29:52] there but he showed up to two sorrowing
[29:54] souls
[29:55] on the greatest day of history don't
[29:57] tell me he won't be here for you tonight
[30:00] he loves you he cares for you and even
[30:02] in a sorrowing soul in a moment he will
[30:05] walk out of the bushes and say
[30:07] what's the matter
[30:10] that's my god
[30:13] he knows your moment he knows what
[30:15] you're going through and he could have
[30:16] said well you should have stayed and
[30:18] because you're walking away i'm not
[30:19] going to show up but he listen he knows
[30:21] who you are he knows your needs and he's
[30:24] stepping out tonight
[30:26] and he's one to commune with you
[30:29] and he began to ask them what's going on
[30:31] and they begin to preach him a sermon in
[30:34] their backsliding
[30:38] they begin to tell them have you not
[30:40] been here
[30:42] you see that's not how they said it
[30:43] brother jeremy i don't know i'm just
[30:44] being evangelistical
[30:49] have you not seen have you not been here
[30:51] well tell me
[30:53] and they begin to tell them what it was
[30:56] now notice something here
[30:59] he
[31:00] he could have just immediately
[31:02] went in and said oh you know oh you know
[31:05] and open their eyes
[31:06] but he had to correct
[31:08] their error
[31:10] oh fools
[31:13] slow i believe of heart
[31:16] and he began to go what did he begin to
[31:18] do he began to go through the scriptures
[31:21] and remind them
[31:23] wait wait
[31:24] when jesus does something he does it
[31:27] he does the same way what did he do to
[31:28] john
[31:29] go and remind him what i've done what
[31:32] did he do with their disciples even in
[31:34] their backsliding even in their despair
[31:37] when it didn't happen as quick as they
[31:38] thought it should happen that's a
[31:39] problem we get ahead of god let's stay
[31:41] with the word of god let's stand on his
[31:44] word listen if god has promised you
[31:46] something and it's from his word stand
[31:47] upon his word and don't get ahead of his
[31:49] promise
[31:50] stay with the word of the hour
[31:53] but then he once he corrected their
[31:55] problem you see if we can't cr if we
[31:57] can't have correction in the church
[32:00] you're you're it's
[32:01] i'm going to just say advil ain't fixing
[32:03] it
[32:05] it's only masking it
[32:07] come on you can't have an advil church
[32:09] and a church be healed
[32:11] you've got to allow the surgeon to come
[32:13] in
[32:15] and you just can't look at the face of
[32:17] the guy that's standing up here and say
[32:19] well it's only brother david it's it's
[32:21] only this one and it's only that one no
[32:23] you have to pray god i know
[32:26] that you're dealing with me because
[32:28] circumcision of the heart is still a
[32:29] real thing
[32:32] and once he corrected oh hallelujah
[32:35] once he corrected once he reminded them
[32:38] and then he begin to break the bread
[32:41] just as he had done before
[32:43] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[32:45] him
[32:47] oh let our eyes be opened tonight break
[32:50] the bread lord like you've done it
[32:51] before
[32:52] let there be correction in the church if
[32:54] there's something that's wrong in my
[32:55] life lord i wanted to be corrected i'm
[32:58] tired of masking the problem no more

[33:27] eagle that cannot just see further

[34:36] around the tent
[34:38] and making sure that it's sealed
[34:40] and making sure there's no bugs
[34:43] and making sure that it's this and
[34:44] making sure that it's that
[34:46] instead of actually looking to our isaac
[34:49] and going into the tent

[42:29] i
[42:31] love
[42:32] your souls
[42:42] [Music]
[42:51] amen didn't you appreciate that tonight
[42:55] it
[42:56] certainly spoke to my heart
[43:01] you know
[43:02] so many times we
[43:05] we think we're talking it over
[43:07] with the lord but it's a one-sided
[43:10] conversation
[43:13] it's like going to the doctor and you
[43:15] tell them what's wrong with you and
[43:18] then you tell them how you want them to
[43:20] treat it
[43:21] [Music]
[43:24] you know and
[43:29] you know a lot of years i've had a lot
[43:31] of people
[43:33] sit in my office
[43:35] with troubles and problems
[43:39] and so many times i've come to realize
[43:42] that
[43:43] all they need is
[43:45] [Music]
[43:46] a trip to the burning bush
[43:55] nothing else to offer
[43:58] just go to the bush
[44:02] take a moment in his presence
[44:05] don't say nothing
[44:08] [Music]
[44:09] just be there a while
[44:16] it can fix so many things
[44:20] but just to take a moment
[44:25] you know before he gets there he knows
[44:27] what you have need of
[44:31] where you're yet a sinner he died for
[44:32] you
[44:33] [Music]
[44:37] he just wants you and him
[44:39] [Music]
[44:41] just to spend some time together
[44:45] it'll sweeten your spirit
[44:47] it'll do like our brother preach to us
[44:50] it will clarify our vision
[44:53] it'll make everything different just
[44:54] being in his presence
[44:58] no need saying quotes to him
[45:03] no need repeating scripture to him he
[45:05] wrote them
[45:07] [Music]
[45:10] but what we need is is him
[45:14] and we all need him
[45:17] there's no big eyes or little use in his
[45:19] presence
[45:20] there's no great ministers of very good
[45:23] so the word really spoke to me tonight
[45:26] really touched my heart and
[45:29] really meant
[45:31] something to me
[45:33] personally
[45:35] and
[45:37] and i'd like to encourage you if you can
[45:39] get a chance that last weekend
[45:42] to go up and support
[45:44] brother jeremy's meeting
[45:46] [Music]
[45:48] amen i'd encourage that i know you'd
[45:51] enjoy brother danny but

[45:56] fellowship i've really come to
[45:58] really love brother jeremy a whole lot
[46:01] and i appreciate what he stands for and
[46:03] i appreciate the word tonight so
