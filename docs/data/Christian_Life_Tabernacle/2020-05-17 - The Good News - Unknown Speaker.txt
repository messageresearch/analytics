John we're just gonna have just just a nice time in the word I certainly enjoyed that special amen now that is just the kind of singing and song and that I like that was just really wonderful the st. John the 21st chapter when I had my talk with my doctor the one that's going to do my little procedure on my hand you know I told them that they you know that I fish you know and I like to fish and and so he said well I'm a tournament bass fisherman so Leslie asked me if I liked him I said yeah he's a fisherman I like him you know he's good but I also liked he told me he said you said now as soon as you get your cast off he said you can go fish and you'll have a brace on he said but you can fish with it he said I would and I thought yeah you know so before he does the operation I'm going to bring him some pictures of the fish I caught so that he'll know that he's doing this operation for a worthy cause right you know you always want to give person a reason for doing something you you you know how true that is brother brems says you've got to have a reason why you want to be healed you cannot have a reason for it something you got to have a motive something that you're looking forward to that mean something to you so how many of you guess the scripture just by that story okay let's turn the 21st chapter in the third verse and Simon Peter said unto them I go a-fishing then they said unto Him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into the ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus amen and I love this story then jesus said unto them children have you any meat and they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast there for now they were not able to draw yet for the multitude of fishes therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter it is the Lord and when Simon Peter heard it it was the Lord he Girt with his fishing coat unto him for he was naked indeed cast himself into the sea Heavenly Father we asked you to bless your word and your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you you may be seated it certainly was something that story in itself is such a wonderful story but Jesus stood on the bank and they didn't know it was him and and I think that's sad apart when he can be with us even amongst us sometimes and we don't recognize him you know then he goes unrecognized and that certainly a great heartbreaker and a great thing to to realize that he can be he can even be present with us and we not realize that he was all there for us and that and the beautiful part of that is that he was resurrected and there he was they they they watched him you know be buried but now they couldn't recognize him in his resurrection and you know it kind of brings to the the story of you know the good news you know and that's what the gospel is it's the good news you know they tell of the time during the emancipation and the problem emancipation proclamation and that was that at a certain time when the Sun has risen that every person that was a slave to go free and the story goes as you know that the people that were able to climb up to the hills into the mountains they climbed up and then as the Sun rose they began to see it and I'd like to pick up the story and read it to you and it says in the days when the slaves when they were in bondage and they were slaves here in the States when Abraham Lincoln died to free the colored man and give him to write not to be a slave any longer they were freed at sunrise and I like he puts here too you were free that sunrise - comparing to the resurrection and they were so happy about it knowing that they were going to be free as soon as the Sun rose some of them that was healthier better physically fit they claimed way up on the mountain some could not go all the way to the top some halfway up and some all the way down and as soon as the Sun began to keep up the great strong ones was on the top I like that today the great strong Christians who rise up into the spheres of the Holy Spirit those who just come along the road under justification those who are all the way down in the valley of confusion they raised up and as soon as the ones that was high could see it first way off when they seen the Sun arising they screamed at the top of their voice - the ones below them saying we are free we are free the minute they've got a glimpse of it they they begin to testify that were free now I love this as we just talked about it for a moment we are free and then those got it and they let out a shout and scream down to the others we are free and the others down below that explained to the others we are free so the first one that was free shouted out we are free we are free and it just kept coming down coming down coming down we are free we are free now look those up on the hill could see the Sun so they were free but as soon as the news came to that fellow in the valley he was just as free as he would ever be whether the Sun was up or not you see it and alls he had to do this received the news Christ come to set the captive free you don't have to be bound down with habits halfway Christian life God don't want you to be that way he wants you to be free god anointed christ to preach freedom to open the prison doors and every time that's what he wants he wants us to be free just think of it you know we were such a people that adapt you know it's easy to go into denial and just adapt and just accept things and it's the way it is and I just accept it and this is how I'm going to have to live that's not what he wanted he didn't want that for us he didn't want us not to be a people without hope he doesn't want us to come to the acceptance that that oh well this is just the way they're gonna be all their life no that's not the kind of God he is that's why we pray because prayer changes things prayer can change things that's what's the beautiful part about asking you shall receive so prayer changes things so that's what he wanted and say you're sitting in there and he said hip he says god anointed christ to preach freedom and to open the prison doors say you're setting in there and your death sentence is on you and the first thing you know they're fixing to take you out and hang you or execute you in some way and the first thing you hear somebody come down the street saying hold it I've got a pardon you don't have to die now you don't have to wait till you're out of prison you're just as free right then as you will be when you're out now that that's a such a beautiful thought it has when you're out of that prison you're just as free right then as you will be when you're out so the man can just be as happy sitting in prison as he would be out of prison as long as he knows his pardon is signed oh my there's so much in that I would really like to be in me you know I don't have to respond to the results but I can be happy with the promise I can be just as happy accepting the promise as accepting the pardon as when the pardon and the promise comes to pass I can be just as happy sitting in that prison cell knowing that I free and knowing that the pardon has come and the days coming that I'll be out don't you feel that way about this old prison pest house right here that we're in the prison of this flesh we've got a promise that we'll be set free from this we should be just as happy in this old flesh as as we will be when we're free amen he says he says that's the way it is this morning here it is to every man or woman that has a hungry heart to come out of prison cell this morning the good news of the gospel is preached and no matter if you're still sitting sick if you're still sitting bound you can be just as free because the news has come to you you are pardoned Christ rose some nineteen hundred years ago this morning and set every prisoner free open the prison doors and let them come out oh what a marvelous thing you can be just as free because you heard the news and when that Sun come up that person that heard the news was just as free as the person who saw it because it was the good news and you know that's what's amazing is that work that's our Commission to go into all the world and give them the good news and and and what is the good news not it's not only that were pardoned because what good would the pardon do if we never had life the pardon is from death that's what the pardon is the pardons from the curse of sin the day you eat is the day that you die that's what the pardons for me it's the status that we've been set free and we know that death we were set free from death because he conquered death hell in the grave he conquered the curse of sin the curse of sin was put on him he took the curse of sin he took death he didn't he didn't he did they didn't take his life he laid his life down he was the resurrection in the life they didn't take it he laid his life down he gave his life there was no sin in them and if there was no sin in them there was no death in him because sin is what caused death death was the attribute of sin death was the attribute of unbelief she didn't believe the word of God and there was death now he didn't believe the word of God who can accuse him of unbelief there was nobody that me to kiss him of unbelief he would have never died but he laid down his life I lay down my life and I take it up again why did he lay down his life he laid down this life for us that's the good news he laid down his life for us so that he could impart to us eternal life and so that that's that was the the Great Commission is that he's risen think of that that that's that's what that our testimony is that's what our gospel is that's what our Commission is our Commission isn't to be history teachers and the history's good if it was just history it would be a wonderful story but it's more than history it's the good news that he's risen he's conquered death hell in the grave he what good would it have done if he he didn't rise we should say that he died but but that's not the news the news is that he's he's alive he's risen and and I like this statement here that is spoken he says and the resurrection is just as vital today and just as real to every human heart that believes it as it was to Mary Magdalene in them who stood at that grave that morning and who's seen him the fact that he's alive it is just as vital to us today as it was to them when they've seen him just be he was they when he set them free were just as free hearing the Word of God just as vital just as free as Mary Magdalene and he says he stood at the grave here he is and there here he is and there her name called Mary and she she looked around and said rabboni or master that's just as real to every heart this morning that's born of the Spirit of God by the resurrection power as it was to the woman standing there that grave in the morning that's the good news is that he's he's resurrected now why is that so good because what good would had done if he was resurrected but he wasn't the same if he was different if he arose somebody that was different if he arose somebody that that didn't have the same care or didn't have the same heart that wouldn't be a very good what gospel would we have but that's our gospel that's what we're commissioned that that's what that what it means to us and that's what he said is he sent us to go tell that he's alive so if he's alive and he's the same then the gospel is he's here doing the same works that he did 2,000 years ago he hasn't stopped he's still in party life he's still doing the same things that he always does and that's the good news is that he's not only resurrected but he's here the church got away from that the church began to worship Him historically they begin to lay down the Commission the Commission just wasn't to go into the war world and talk about the history but the the Commission was to goand in the world and lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover to cast out demons too to do the works that I do you shall do also it was the proof of the resurrection in the believer and when the church got away from that and they were no good they no longer were preaching a present tense just they deceive me he's present tense he said if two or three of you gathered together in my name I will be there I will be in your mess I mean it goes unrecognized that's why lady Asiya needed eyesalve that they could see they needed something to bring us back to the reality that Jesus Christ the same one that was veiled in flesh 2,000 years ago and walked on the shore of Galilee that same person is here present doing the same things that he did then the church got so far away from it that God promised when this world caught in a labial got seeing condition when it got in the condition as it was in the days of Noah and it was in the days of Sodom he would again make a visitation to us to show the Gentiles that he still life if it wasn't a new Jesus it wasn't a Jesus that came down from heaven it was the Jesus that was here that had gone so and the works that he did were no longer being done they weren't talking about him the same yesterday and today and forever they were talking to him about yesterday they were preaching of Jesus of yesterday you know sometimes we get kind of like that with the message of the hour we preach a yesterday's message it's not a yesterday message it's the eternal Word of God and the message was is that that he was going to to become one with us that there's a union going to take place there was a people that he was going to unite himself in and become one with and they were going to become like him that's how they started to preach a historical Jesus and when you just preach a historical Jesus you're not preaching a resurrected Jesus they preaching to Jesus that's gone to heaven but that's not what he promised he said I'll be with you even in you till the end I will not leave you comfortless but I personal pronoun will come again oh you know we would get so far away from the understanding that our very purpose is to magnify the Lord that that's what our our hearts desire is to demonstrate the resurrection that Keith he's here he's risen that that's the news that we preached the good news is he's alive and he's the same and the power of the Resurrection is present and that's what our testimony is you hear the gospel just like they heard the news and you accept it in your heart and pain and you believe it and you repent of your sins you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that resurrection takes its abode in you now you possess resurrection I really believe that I just burns in my heart I can't help it and then so just think that he's Commission's us and sends us out to share this news the news of this message was more than brother Branham was a prophet this message woke it was a demonstration to show that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever and he was present with us veiled in flesh doing the same signs and wonders that he did 2,000 years ago that the faith of the believer would be restored it was a restoration that when Peter in them stood on the shore they they did they didn't recognize him but when that net was full when the sign he did the same works that he did he you know that's one thing I like about the Lord he's the creator of the solution a man he don't need to use things he's the creator of the solution when Abraham needed an offering not created and offering when the children were hungry he created fish and loaves when they tarried all night he created the solution he's resurrected he can create our solution he doesn't use things made by hand he can but also he can create ah I just see it so much even in my own life I'll need something from God and I'll create the way that he can do it Lord if you'll just follow my advice and do this and do that you know if you get such-and-such to lend me this money and you again you'll give me a and this guy hires me and I make so much an hour and oh if you could just get all this lined up then everything will be well he's the creator of the solution I remember I was driving one day and I'd cashed my paycheck and I set it on the seat next to me and I was driving down the road didn't have much air-conditioning pulled the windows down a little bit and my paycheck flew out the window and I got out and tried to find it and the wind was blowing and I just so heartbroken and everything but I wasn't in my heart I thought you know there's somebody down the road praising God you know what I mean thank you Jesus my dentist bill I didn't know how I was gonna pay this and God I believe God might just created the solution you know he sees God more amen those aren't the things we need to worry about we need to worry about testifying to his presence that's what we need to go to we need to go to him like I said this morning he's here that you got to have a conference with them that's the whole point of the resurrection is that he's gonna walk us all the way through they he didn't he said I won't leave you comfortless but I'll go with you I'll be there I'll be present tense oh my you think that if we could start living daily with the present tense Lord what kind of atmosphere would be around us what kind of good news would come out of our mouth what kind of hope would we be telling people people gives you just a real sad sort sob story you see man that's terrible I really feel for you but the only good thing I can say is Jesus Christ is here and he's the same yesterday today and forever and he can create a solution he's still a healer and that's what he did he sent us out into the world now listen to what Jesus said he says the father that sent me is with me oh my what a decoration what a word the father that sent me comes with me it's not I that does the work it's the father that's in me that does the work I know as the father goes with me and in that that was what it was like he said listen as the father sent me so do I send you he don't only send you but he goes with you I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world and that was in God all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he emptied out into the believer the church God is with you though I am with you always even until the end of the world that's the declaration of God's Word that's what the Bible says that's what I believe that's what we believe you know I thought of that statement he said there was another conference which way was they going to do this church where going to put the new Church into the hands of a man having a Pope and Cardinals and bishops and end things were they going to put it in an affiliation another denomination something that we could join and be a part of he say he said no oh they all found this church I will come again and I'll be with them and I'll be in them and I personal pronoun the Holy Spirit is not a third person it's not a second person it's not a separate person it's the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ return back to the believer in the form of the Holy Spirit to lead and guide him the Holy Spirit is him in spirit form with us he didn't leave us and if he sent to us he said as the father hath sent me so do I send you oh my that's something that grab hold of that that's something to hang onto that something to that that's so real and to the believer you know that that he says yoked herself up with him for my yoke is light and my burdens are easy don't yoke up with the things of the world don't yoked up in different societies and organizations yoke yourself singly with the Lord Jesus in order that you can do it and and see the resurrection just to see the resurrection that was so beautiful in in the discernment lines and and in the lane hands on this of the sift and of taking of the hands what we witness was the resurrection we resin we saw a resurrected Jesus demonstrating that resurrection life and the power of that resurrection life to an age that had gone totally dark in other words someone on the mountain saw the rising of the Sun and cried out and said we're free the works that I do shall you do also I wonder why we don't look at ourselves like that it's always so easy to believe it in somebody else instead of accepting it for ourselves what a great what a great Commission that was given you know to yoke ourselves up and and to realize that we're ambassadors because isn't that what we testify to is that we heard we heard about him faith cometh by her hearing they heard they were free and you heard about the Lord and the spirit convicted you of sin it's a wonderful thing to feel conviction it's not present at the time it's not pleasant it doesn't make you feel real wonderful if you're min-seok convicted you just feel like you're vibrating you know and it just seems like you're burning you're on fire I mean it's it's beyond embarrassment you just feel so exposed you just feel so I liked what somebody asked a brother George the other day Smith he said how was it when you meant brother branham for the first time having been talking to his daughter he said well I I could I could tell he was reading the hard drive you know it's like why not let him read it he knows it anyway why not let him you know bring us under conviction why not know he's president Lord your presence your real put me under conviction show me my life let me take a look at myself show me what I have Nita I know you're here I know you're walking with me not only doesn't he send you but he goes with you he says the father says I said so I send you not only does he send you but he goes with you I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world I'll be with you he's right here what a time to come and fellowship with him he's the same yesterday today and forever that's what he wants us to bear witness dude he wants us to bear witness to a resurrected Jesus not a historical Jesus but one that's the same yesterday today and forever that can do the same things in other words a God that still can create the solution he creates the deliverance someone just delivered it wasn't man that did it it wasn't a program that does it I've seen people choose shoes Nicorette or whatever that stuff is like in cigarettes true that went up what are you doing I quit smoking you chew gum you know I'm not saying that gums nasty habit it's just a little nasty of a habit but it ain't terrible but daddy he creates the solution he's alive he's a creator he still does the supernatural if he can't work in the natural realms the carnal mind can only see carnal but the spiritual mind sees spiritual and that that's the beauty of the resurrection he says and he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the scripture that's what we believe to be the truth that's what we accept to be the truth he's same in principle he's same in power he's the same in love he's the same in every way that he was then now he has come with the church as God sent him he went with him as he sends us and Commission's us he goes with us in the same love the same power the same principle now why is this resurrection so important to it why is the fact that he sent us so important to us and that he went with us why is it so important to us and I thought it was so beautifully summed up he said and God raised him up if God hadn't been with him he would have never raised him up on the third day so the father that sent him is always with him and with him and went with him to the grave and raised him up the third day and as God sent me he said so do I send you I'll be with you why is that if that same resurrection is in US isn't that what this is all about if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in us it will also raise our mortal bodies isn't that what the good news is that he rose and that what raised him from the dead was that there was no sin in him he laid his life down he laid his life down at Calvary he took his life because what was that it was the God that sent him in him that's what raised him up what was in him he knew that the God that sent him was in him now if we know that the God that it was that was resurrected that same Christ that was resurrected if he sent us oh he sent us he sent you by putting your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he sent you by predestinated you to be to this age you were sent before the foundation of the world his workmanship Christ Jesus for deigned unto good works that you should walk in them if he sent you he comes with you and if he's in you and with you he goes to the grave with you and if he goes to the grave with you he raises you up because he is the resurrection he is the life oh he says he said through the end of the world he says when our Easter comes he'll be there just the same as God was on that Easter morning raising him up from the dead now in symbol of that he has brought this before there can be a resurrection there has to be a death and it has to be one thing then go anyway and and he says for that has to be one thing then go away and then come back to be a resurrection it means to be brought back and before a man can be raised up in the resurrection with Christ he has to die out to himself he has to die out to all of his worldly associates die out to all the worldly habits die out in everything that's ungodly and be resurrected I knew I just feel that in my heart and you know that that what is what a place that we've come to we just cruising along going in our own pace and people found themselves in all kinds of circumstances and said wait I'm not gonna live like this anymore I'm gonna change I'm getting a new job I'm doing this I'm doing that you know our heart so many things were we're disrupted it's hard to believe that people are protesting and nobody can understand it I I don't understand it you can walk up and down the beach you can go on the boardwalk but you can't go in the water now is that thing in the water it's like a creepy monster show from the 50s or something I can I can stand here and walk by people but I can't walk on the beach and get in the water somebody help me place has gone crazy I need someone to walk with me I need something to go with me every day I need somebody to be there I need the the only thing that saying is the Word of God the whole world the prophet of God said has gone in saying like I said earlier they shut down restaurants in everything but they let everybody go in Home Depot like they knew if they're gonna be at home they better they're gonna fix things you ought to seen the Goodwill store piles and piles and piles of stuff I drove by the goodwill I couldn't believe it everybody had cleaned their closets everybody had got rid of everything Furniture piled up clothes filed up everything piled up I guess they didn't get the memo nobody could come out and buy it they shut goodwill down and the people still kept dumping their stuff all day they like they closed it they click over there left Home Depot sir break it everything fixed I don't know if any of you got honey-do list but I did why don't you fix this why don't you fix that well ok guess I'll have to run to Home Depot they left liquor stores open you know what I mean people couldn't live without it necessity closed churches leave liquor store open I mean we need something that that's what we're testifying to we've got somebody to lead us we got somebody that's present we've got a present tense God what's he gonna do he'll create the solution if he has to we don't have to worry about that we have to keep our eyes on him we've got to be yoked up with him we've got to be visibly and spiritually and mentally conscious of his presence because this is the time heaps most real to us this is the time he said I'll be a present help in the time of trouble I'll not leave you I'll be there with you a walk through it all the way with you I won't separate Mike myself from you I'm not living in in in the past tense I'm in the present tense and I want to worship Him in the present tense I would love for our conduct to be like him how many would be late for dinner if Jesus was the guest forget forget just the president the United States was coming to your house oh you'd sweep it up clean it up and get it all ready you know all the television cameras are going to be flashing onion everybody's house is going to be there you wouldn't be late president of the United States standing there all the cameras and everything you come tooling up about 20 minutes late and your work clothes and hey how are you I voted Democrat No No but yet we treat the presence of the Lord like that just think if his word is true the first time the first two believers comes into the house of the Lord he's there not he don't dwell in buildings or things made with hands he dwells in his word and when two believers come together believing and agreeing on any one thing he's there so the next person that walks in walks into his presence and walks into his present and it were a conscious people of the resurrection the resurrection is just as vital to us and it's real to us as we saw it and when those disciples sat on that shore and when he said cast a net and they pulled out the net and John said it's the Lord Peter girded themself up and swam to the shore and when he got there he took of their catch and he had bread and fish upon the fire and he said come and dine that's what he's telling us come and dine on all my promises all my riches all the things I'm here I'm here to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask for thing you don't have to run off I'm with you well I'm not too clean though he come reason with me come talk with me though your sins be like scarlet I'll make them white as snow I'm resurrected I'm here I'm doing the same things that I did 2,000 years ago I'm alive for you I'm not gonna leave you I'm gonna go with you I'm gonna keep you nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand I'm going to finish the work than you that I started if we don't we take this message and turn it into a denomination we let it drift back to days gone by and stories come by he said what would follow this message is another book of Acts another testimonies of the real resurrected Jesus doing the supernatural in our presence giving God the glory for the things he's done in our life I would hate to think that he's gone unrecognized that day he's like a Wallflower and he's put off to the side and he's not considered that we know he we know that he was and we know that he will be but he didn't say I I was the was and I will be the will be he said I am I'm the I am I'm the present tense God and I just thought thought in my heart oh if we could just come to the place where that resurrected Lord is so real to us it's about him our words glorify him our lives we act like he's sitting right next to us boy that was peep you know that's the only reason prophet of God said that men's sin is because they feel they're out of his presence they don't feel he's there but he said he'd be there so he's there and that when that conviction came in your life and you asked him in his heart and you became one with him he still today keeps his word and really you when our prophet came that's what he kept saying over and over and over again he's the same yesterday today and forever the works that I do shall you do also because I go to the Father I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again and I'll be with you even in you as the father hath sent me so have I sent you also such a beautiful thing that we're built on and I'll just in my heart for our church and I don't know if we'll ever be back to normal you know we've had people that come 20-30 minutes late and they just kind of drift in and maybe they come in and they sit on this pew and and I don't blame them for falling asleep I'm not a very you know deep emotional preacher but just the revelation of his promise to be here and if we could look to him he would do the same not only for us but for the loved ones and the people that we present to him how many would you say if you knew Jesus real well and and when of your friends came along you'd say Lord which here would you I'd like to introduce you to my friend bill and bill he's got a needy daughter and well I'm asking you if you would touch him you think he's alive to do that I do I think he's really a live Church and I think he really loves us and I think he our love I think he's looking for that respect and that love as a bride to her husband as a relationship that he's home and he's one and he's here and I vowed to serve them and be with them and and in that great fellowship would enter into our heart so I just asked as we go forward maybe as a church and we are waiting what the Lord has for us and you know like I said we used to have three rows down the middle and people in the bathroom everyone scrunched together do you like the spacing between the pews better maybe just pray those unbelievers don't come back all right we'll only have a church a one kind of believer right no make believers no one but he was just believers whew I wonder how many of us really meet that qualification let's just strive to go forward but I don't know but the one thing I know is whatever lies ahead I want to go with him whatever lies ahead I want him to be there whatever lies ahead I want to look to that leadership I want to be conscious of his promise and I want to see the resurrection because when I see the power of the resurrection it confirms to me that I possess resurrection and I want it to be real especially now I want to have my ticket in my hand I want to have the token applied I want to be at the train station ready to go I want to have an awareness about me like I've never had before and I just thought of that little message that we read from tonight proof of the resurrection the proof of the resurrection is his presence that proves he's alive because he's here doing what he said he would do and that's how I know he's alive and he's here because I see the effects of his presence in our lives god bless you brother billy if you come let's stand together we ask you to pray for me in fact maybe i could ask some of the brothers to come and and just lay your hands on me and pray for me for my my surgery i i i i just feel that this is the way to go it's not something that is so pressing that i just feel that this is what god's provided i believe god uses doctors you understand the doctor told me that there's nothing we can do you know i mean it just there's nothing that we have we have no medicine we have no help for you then i would be asking you to play hands on me that my faith i could have a miracle but it's a simple solution that they have for a problem that will allow me to be able to hold the glass again in my hand and turn my car keys i accept that that healing comes from the Lord and that he uses men so anyway if we've seen this song maybe some of any other brothers they'd like to pray for me if you just come up and lay your hands on me I'd be happy to have you pray for me that God would would do abundantly for me all that he promised he'll do and that he's really the physician that'll be present so hey man Thank You brothers I believe we have the Jesus that hears your prayers don't you man [Music] to his presence [Music] it's [Music] you [Music] myself
