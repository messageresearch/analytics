[13:06] this morning
[13:07] as you invite buddy mike for some
[13:08] reading amen i trust you're excited to
[13:10] be in his presence this morning
[13:12] amen as the scripture says as the days
[13:14] approach the
[13:15] believers gather together amen god bless
[13:18] you
[13:27] good morning
[13:31] and i think we're all familiar with that
[13:34] message that
[13:35] brother branham preached trying to do
[13:38] god a service
[13:40] without it being his will and
[13:44] the scripture that he chose when he was
[13:47] speaking out was
[13:48] mark 7 7. it says this how be it in vain
[13:53] do they worship me teaching for
[13:56] doctrines the commandments of men
[14:00] you know what i was doing i've been
[14:02] making it a commitment which i generally
[14:04] fail every year
[14:05] to read through the bible this year and
[14:07] uh read through a similar passage in
[14:10] matthew where jesus was saying something
[14:11] similar
[14:12] of the pharisees and you know you read
[14:14] scriptures like that and you tend
[14:16] to ascribe those things to the pharisees
[14:19] or the religious leaders of the day or
[14:22] you know religion and denomination and
[14:24] everything
[14:25] other than us but you know as i was
[14:29] thinking
[14:30] over this it you know occurred to me how
[14:32] much of what we do
[14:33] how much we commit our our time to our
[14:36] efforts to
[14:38] isn't really instructed of the lord
[14:42] not really lead of the lord you know
[14:45] even good things
[14:46] even things that feel religious feel
[14:48] spiritual but
[14:50] have we really heard from the lord on
[14:53] doing that or are we doing it because we
[14:55] think
[14:56] it's right right you know we know the
[14:59] story in
[14:59] exodus of the children of israel who you
[15:02] know were
[15:03] were slaves and you know it says in the
[15:05] beginning of exodus that they had
[15:06] utterly committed themselves to building
[15:08] treasure cities under pharaoh
[15:11] you know to the point that when a
[15:12] prophet came with a deliverance message
[15:15] they they pushed back on that because he
[15:18] was messing with their livelihood
[15:22] but you know that was not their original
[15:23] occupation
[15:25] when they first entered into the chill
[15:26] into egypt and they gave witness
[15:29] you know joseph brought his brothers
[15:30] before pharaoh they gave witness that
[15:32] their occupation was to be shepherds
[15:34] so somewhere along the line they forgot
[15:36] their original occupation
[15:38] and got caught up building treasure
[15:40] cities for pharaoh instead of being
[15:42] shepherds you know i think that
[15:47] sometimes we get so busy maybe building
[15:50] cities
[15:51] that we've forgotten what it is and
[15:54] maybe this is just for me but
[15:56] you know certainly as we go about our
[15:58] time and our day
[16:00] you know how much do we spend
[16:04] on things that aren't necessarily thus
[16:06] saith the lord but they're what we're
[16:07] told are the right things to do
[16:10] being responsible citizen we do this
[16:12] being a good student
[16:14] i do this being a religious person i do
[16:17] this
[16:18] but have we gone before him as
[16:21] individuals
[16:22] to receive thus saith the lord about
[16:24] that
[16:25] you know jesus said that i do nothing
[16:28] nothing unless i the father shows me
[16:32] first
[16:33] you know it wasn't because of what was
[16:35] taught but what i have heard for myself
[16:37] right brother randy you know mentioned
[16:40] the scripture
[16:41] matthew 7 on wednesday it says that
[16:45] you know many will say to me in that day
[16:47] lord lord have we not prophesied in thy
[16:49] name
[16:50] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[16:52] thy name done many wonderful works
[16:54] you know i thought about that that's a
[16:55] pretty good resume of works
[16:58] those are some good spiritual religious
[17:01] things but he still called it iniquity
[17:05] because it was their own works
[17:08] it wasn't thus saith the lord you never
[17:11] knew me
[17:13] you know and so it was just kind of a
[17:14] reminder to me personally
[17:17] that to be so careful about the work
[17:20] that we do
[17:22] the work that i do being first
[17:25] a result of thus saith the lord and
[17:28] seeking him
[17:28] first that i don't get caught up doing
[17:31] all these other things that i forget the
[17:32] principle thing to seek his face
[17:36] psalm 127 we'll go ahead and read that
[17:38] this morning it's a short
[17:39] passage but it opens with this verse it
[17:41] says accept the lord build the house
[17:45] they labor in vain that build it
[17:48] except the lord keep the city the
[17:51] watchmen
[17:52] wakeeth but in vain
