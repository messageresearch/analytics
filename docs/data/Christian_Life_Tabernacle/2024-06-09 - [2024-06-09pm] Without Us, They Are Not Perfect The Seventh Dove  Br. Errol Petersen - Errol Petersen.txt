amen and I just want to thank the pastor for allowing me the privilege tonight to say something to the Bride of Jesus Christ and also I want to thank the Believers this is my last service tonight tomorrow by the the Lord willing I'll be going back to Cape Town again but I have great memories of my stay I've been here five weeks now with the Saints of like Precious faith and I've enjoyed your fellowship and also you're very you're nice people I enjoyed the worship you know it's a wonderful spirit that prevails in this church and I believe that God is doing something beautiful wonderful here in this Christian fellowship and I to thank each and every family every brother that invited me to their home have some fellowship and time to enjoy the food of Dallas amen thank you for that and I don't want to mention by name but the Brethren all know who they are and I'm going to say thank you for your invitation May Godly bless you and be with you and I believe that I will long remember the experience and the fellowship that I had here even our fellowship on the Friday morning amen I've been to all the Bible studies and and truly I enjoyed the fellowship with the Believers there we could just feel the presence of the Lord was with us and tonight as we come to the last service I believe that God has got something for us you know whenever I come to the service I sit in the congregation I look at that Dove you know it's a very prominent figure in the church so I thought maybe I would like to speak on the dove so when you enter here and you look at the dove you know I spoke first on the face of God when you come into the church you see the face of God but now you come into the sanctuary there's a dove offering over those who go through baptism they repent and they are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the next phase is for the dove to come and find its roosting place in their heart so we have there right before you that the dove his presence may be felt in our midst so tonight while we are standing before I read the word shall we just have a word of prayer our heavenly father we are so thankful tonight that once again we could be gathered in your presence Lord we could have been in so many places tonight but father we just felt the tug of the Holy Spirit to come to the house of the Lord once again oh God to feel you in our midst Lord to know that you are the only true and living God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and tonight we pray father may you come and break the bread of life father God we are a needy people as our faces differ so does our needs differ tonight may you come in your own special way and speak to every heart Lord we want to make our confession tonight that we love you and we appreciate you Lord we thank you for this great Plan of Redemption that Lord it was you at the beginning it's you at the end you are the author and the finisher of our faith and therefore tonight we come to give you glory we give you honor and all the praise for what you have done for us may you bless the reading of your word as we ask it in Jesus name amen amen let us turn to our Bibles for a scripture reading to the Book of Exodus CH 12 and verse 13 and also Hebrews 11: 13-6 and then we'll read from verses 37 to 40 we'll started by reading Exodus 12 and verse 13 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and then we turn to Hebrews chap 11: 13- 16 read us these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off see it was quite distant with this great fulfillment of the promise when the Messiah would come but they saw it a far off and listen what they were willing to do knowing that this was a reality to them as you he this morning that this word has got to become reality it is you that the prophet is speaking about amen but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is and Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city amen hallelujah amen so where am I now so let's turn read further on number uh verse number 37 they were stoned they were sown a son were tempted were slain with sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in the deserts and in the mountains and in dens and in the caves of the earth and all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect may the Lord add His blessings reading of his word you may be seated so tonight as a subject like to speak without us they are not perfect and then I would like to focus on the dove specifically the seventh dove as we all understand that Redemption is about blood it starts off with defiled blood causing the fall of Man and the undefiled blood of God to redeem man back to the place where he fell from now when God made the first Adam he made Adam a son Adam was an offspring he was fresh from the hand of God and Adam we find listen to his wife and his wife listened to the serpent instead of a husband and we find that they were both corrupted and they brought pollution upon the Earth by the defilement of the bloodstream they brought sin upon themselves they actually fell from a condition of perfection into a condition where they were subject to sin all kinds of sickness Came Upon them whatever we mention from the pulpit whatever desire was because of the unbelief of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and we find therefore the whole human race was born in sin shaped in iniquity it comes to the world speaking lies because of Adam's condition and we find there was really no way out the holy image of God God left them in the Garden of Eden now just to get a little background about the Holy image of God I'd like to read a quotation here in the message Oneness brother brandham said now the first man and woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God now whatever God determined in Eden before the fall that was God's Eternal thought God cannot improve on what he does his first thought is perfect so if God required harmony with man and his wife and with god brother brah says there were in so much Harmony so much that God could come down at any time he desired to speak lip to ear to them that is the type of relationship with God desires of man before the Fall In the Garden of Eden now that is perfect Oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God God and his family was one they were God's examples to us that is what God's original intention was that perfect fellowship with man what we should be to them ever present never failing when they spoke God answered he watched them daily night when they lay down to sleep he watched over them in the daytime he guided them he fed them loved them communed with them constantly all the time so it wasn't just a a communion on a Sunday morning and maybe a Sunday evening and and again on a Prayer evening on a Wednesday night but it was a constant communion that's God's fellowship with man see they were in God's image amen now how they were they in God's image brother brandham says and God was in them that Dove the Holy Ghost was in them see that's what makes a fellowship that's what makes the union is God in his church that's the union he said much more could be said see United with him is eternal life and only one way we can Unite with him is to come every bit of his word take every promise and believe it see now listen now when Adam and Eve listen to the LIE of the devil you heard this morning about lies amen but if we accept the word that is what we got to live by not by bread alone by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God see Adam and Eve listen to the LIE of the devil the holy image of god let's say the dove left them their Fellowship was broken with God their Fellowship of Oneness with God was broken the very minute they listened to the LIE of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute you listen to the L of the devil it'll break your fellowship that's the very minute that you go out from the presence of God is when you listen to the LIE of the devil so let's stay with the word stay with the message that you have heard amen that's the way we stay in the presence of God not jumping and shouting whatever those are things that can happen if you are full of the joy of the Lord could happen but doesn't say You must have that in order as as a sign that you've got the Holy Ghost amen see that's the very minute you go out from the presence of God like she did is when you fail to take God's word just as it is so we find that man was in a sinful condition when the dove the holy spirit of God left in the Garden of Eden what did it bring suffering it brought sickness it brought death it brought jealousy it brought murder Cain slew his brother Abel sorrow Came Upon man so God had to make a way that the holy image of God could come back to man again that the dove could come back to man again so that he could bring it back to Eden again now Eden was the home of the dove and brother brandham says that the dove is a home loving bird and God reflects his nature amen through a Heavenly creature and that was the Dove and he reflected that nature so much that the dove is a home loving creature let's just listen what he says on the wings of a snow white dove I believe that this is a prophetic message amen and by his home loving conduct by the conduct of its home loving it has been successfully used for a carry a pigeon because it loves home so if this Dove loved home then it must go back to Eden again and that is a whole Plan of Redemption is to bring everything back home again the prophet says God had a threefold purpose that was to reveal himself secondly to have preeminence and thirdly to restore everything back to Eden again Eden is the home of the dove it's a home loving creature says because it loves home you turn it loose anywhere it'll always go back home that's why even a believer amen we are born in Sun shaped iniquity we come to the world speaking lies but there's a nature in us there's a part of God within us that when the light of God shines upon us like the woman at the well she was a prostitute and who would get any hope for a woman that's a prostitute and there Jesus was sitting at the well he was waiting for her Emanuel God in human flesh and she came by the Water by the well it looked like he was you know interfering with her trying to get her attention he says give me a drink of water he says if you know who I am you wouldn't ask me but he said but if you know who was speaking to you and then brother brah says he contacted her spirit he said he says go fetch me your husband he says I have none he says you spoken right he says because Bible says when the Messiah cometh he'll show us these things and he said I am he and that very moment she dropped the water PT see God closed the book of life and he now opened the Lamb's Book of Life she could never be a prostitute again cuz now she manifested that original germ that was in her waiting to be manifested when the word Shone upon that seed amen and that's what happened to all of us here amen we were out in the world we were a different denomination but the day that the message was revealed to us amen we left the book of life and we came amen the L's Book of Life was open unto us who we really are Who I Am Lord who I am amen I'm a part of God I'm a part of his creation I'm an attribute of God expressed we could never use that language before until the time when that seed of life the gene of God became quickened and we became alive and then we realize that I'm a Son of God I'm no longer a son of Charles and El Bram I am a Son of God Amen I'm here to manifest the purpose of God isn't he wonderful amen it loves its way home so no matter where where you were how deep you were in sin you had to find your way home and this is home to you this is where you belong this is heaven to you this is the atmosphere that you enjoy amen it will go back home now Eden being a place of heavenly peace on Earth it was a place of eternal life and the dove is a symbol of life a place where God comes to roost and fellowship with his family amen he comes in Roots he Roots within your heart if you abide me and my word in you then you ask what you will amen that D has come to has got to come and live within you he's got to come and abide with you aen but it couldn't happen until first Emmanuel Came Upon the scene and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell amen and he came to indwell that body the Dove and he went to Calvary to pay and to cleanse sanctify your church and on the day of Pentecost that same Dove came and that Pillar of Fire came and divided itself up and that was the faith and that Faith started in the River Jordan amen it's actually started in the Book of Genesis because God said I'll be a god unto you and to your seed Amen in their generation brother BR says the faith of God wasn't as much referring to Isaac but to Jesus where the Flesh and spirit would be United together amen and then he went to Calvary Sanctified the church so that the dove the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire could come and indwell that first church amen and lick of fire was upon each and every believer god uniting with man amen what was his purpose take it all back to Eden again Hallelujah the home of the dove the prophet says we'd like to stress on that a little while and you Christians would understand what I mean it always finds its way back home so therefore it's been used as a carrier pigeon it's used in a time of War used to be they Soul use them carrier pigeons to carry a message so you see then that makes the dove both by God and man a messenger a dove is a messenger it was a messenger to Noah to tell Noah that there's peace again on Earth God poured out his judgment in the days of Noah but then he sent a sign on the wings of a dove that peace has been restored again amen what was it was that peace of Eden when the dove comes it's a sign of God hallelujah it was a message to Noah it was used by God to vindicate that this was his son the sacrifice to bring peace upon Earth and Good Will to men it was used as a messenger amen I won't go any further then I'll be giving out the end of my sermon amen hallelujah so while the prophet's grandmother was dying brother brandham says she were singing Rock of Ages cleff for me let me hide myself in thee he says her feeble hands up in the air a dove flew in the door come around sat down at the top of the bed started coing and God took a soul amen so we know exactly where that Soul must have gone to because the DB itself came to collect that soul and while praying for his the great granddaughter of Florence nting girl the prophet says I knelt down with your pastor on the room to pray and when I nailed down to pray a little Dove flew up by the window begin cooing when I finished praying I thought it was a pet duve there somewhere foggy outside How England is the British a there say and this little Dove quit cing and flew away I walked over and laid hands upon her and call the name of the Lord and the woman is a great big strong healthy woman today on the wings of a dove was a sign of a healing amen so we find that the serpent introduce the defilement of an undefiled Holy Blood stream of man whom God had created and the requirement was undefiled blood of an innocent substitute to reverse the process of death which was introduced by the serpent as we all know that life is in the blood and the blood is different from the life see the blood is the chemistry of the life so you have the blood but in the blood you find the blood Caples the life and we find when the when the life went out of the sacrifice the blood the life of the animal could not come back upon the worshipper he had to apply the chemistry amen and throughout the Old Testament they had to apply the chemistry see because animal life does not have a Soul so the life in the animal could not come back upon the worshipper it's a living being but it's not a living Soul so we find to redeem Fallen man the father himself had become one of us see Emmanuel and that was the real Lamb with the real life amen the prophet says in the message the token par 118 that's the reason the lamb which is God's Earthly representative was so identified in the Garden of Eden knowing that the lamb and the dove being God's Heavenly representative so here God the dove presented Adam and Eve with the lamb and the prophet says knowing that the lamb and the dove would meet one time when the lamb and the dove would be together so God was already prophesying in the Garden of Eden the day will come when the dove will settle upon the lamb again Hallelujah that would be the second Adam left the first Adam the image of God left them but there would come a time when the dove and you think when the dove comes it reverses everything amen instead of death there's now Resurrection the Bible says he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity he reversed everything which the devil put in Motion in Eden he made a way for our healing by his stripes we are healed Hallelujah shows the significance of the dove there we find the lamb and the dove together again so we find that God identified himself as the dove which is the most innocent and cleanest of all the Heavenly Creatures Amen in bird life Prophet says he always spoke about the dove as being a symbol of God and the crow as a symbol of a hypocrite amen you can eat dve food you can also eat the things of the world carrying he says you're on the wings of a dove so I found out that a dove don't have any G there's no gold in a dove because he has no need of it so that's the way it is with a Christian he doesn't need any bitterness see cuz he can only eat the food of God see so there's no Christian that's bitter because a dove does not behave itself in one person and misbehave itself in another person it's a national spirit and it brings the same result when the dove comes and settle in your heart he says he doesn't need any bitterness here because he can only eat the food of God and it doesn't take bitterness to dissolve that it takes love to dissolve the food bitterness oh they say well they don't they they difference with it but love always receives it the word of God now he has no goal so therefore it's just against him to eat anything bad the nature of the love which nature now comes on the believer a Christian see and if he would it would kill him but there's no danger he isn't going to eat it because he has no appetite for it it's against your nature to do that why because of the dve and that's the way it is with a real Christian did you know a real Christian doesn't even have any sin at all imputed to him David said blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin to when you are washed in the blood of the Lamb not by make belief but really the blood of the Lamb God does not impute sin to you anything that's done because you're under the blood and he doesn't see it amen we don't say believe the devil's Lies We only believe the word of God we only digest the word of God we have got no time for little stories you know things go around amen say what's the latest news or what's the latest Story the gossip story whatever the dove does not digest that amen he lives on the pure holy word of God see he saw you the the blood sacrifice the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name on the land's Book of Life that's all you can look at because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done you are washed in the blood of the Lamb you say amen amen therefore there's no goal in you there's no unclean Habit in you because that blood of the Lamb has did this and God cannot impute sin to you after you have got a sin offering laying there waiting for you so Jesus was identified as the Lamb of God the Earthly creature the most pure and innocent of all Earthly creatures see and those are the only two Natures that will unite upon the earth that is God the dove which God presented to Adam and Eve in the the same lamb he showed him the way back was by the way of the Lamb amen and the way back was the way back to the dove amen that's why we go through water baptism we repent we are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we are identified with the lamb and then God comes with the Dove and he fills you with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost now lives in you amen so once you receive the Holy Ghost you're now God's Property you belong to him amen so the dve presented Adam and Eve with a chemistry of the symbol of the life that would be manifested on earth so the dove could not Unite with the chemistry of the life of an animal it was pointing to the day when the Dove and the lamb will be United again when Heaven and Earth would Embrace each other again like it did before the fall Hallelujah and they remain strangers and Aliens that's why the Old Testament Saints they worship but they only had partial Redemption see they remain strangers they were aliens from the Commonwealth of God until the real Lamb of God came with the undefiled blood of God then that which was in part was done away with see they were not perfect because in that which is perfect is come the perfect life of God God in human flesh again then that which is impart the chemistry will be done away with Hallelujah so we find that the real lamb could come sorry the real lamb could come together so that we could be Sons and Daughters of God again see Adam and Eve man and woman that was God's whole purpose was to bring it back to where it fell from that's what Redemption means to bring back to its original condition so we find in the first Exodus from Egypt God required a chemistry as a token and the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost the literal life of Jesus Christ amen the dove in The Believer the very life of God the attribute of of God the gene of God now dwelling in the human body amen the great logos God is gathering all his subjects together upon the Earth those who are not a part of God they will not accept the message of the hour you can try whatever you do you can give them money to join the message they are not going to stay see it's got to be a part of God an offspring from God hallelujah so we find that the not an blood or chemistry but the Holy Spirit the father's spiritual genes is what God is gathering together God must see the token today that God and man is United together amen not a chemistry that is what Redemption means to bring it back all the years through all the time since the fall of Man God has been working to get it back to Eden again Hallelujah the lamb and the Dove and we find that the lamb and the dove is associated together throughout the Bible from Genesis to Revelation the lamb and the dove God and man Hallelujah so we find back in Egypt they were living in the shadows of judgment and now brother and sister we are living again in the shadows of judgment and God is again requiring a token Hallelujah and we find in Egypt the chemistry of the blood had to be placed on the lentil and on the doorpost it was a sign of the cross they were looking to Calvary the day when the real Lamb of God was going to be slain so God saw reflected on Earth what he saw in heaven his people in the land of Egypt in the land of Goan covered by the blood of the Lamb it was the blood in type amen it was pointing to the lamb at Calvary all those whose names are written in the L's Book of Life they're the only ones that are considered in Redemption so brother brah says everybody coming by could see the chemistry of the blood on the door a sign that a life had died amen a token that the life that was in the lamb has returned back amen and today he says everyone talking to you or associating with you can see that the blood has been applied to you the token life that was in the blood is upon you and you are saved so Jesus was the perfect sacrifice God himself becoming the atonement when he was made flesh and Allelujah he made a way that the life of God the holy image of God could come back to man again Hallelujah so we find in Hebrews 11 it says all these they wondered about in sheep skins and goat skin they were destitute they were uh rejected they were Sor aunder they saw the kingdom whose Builder and maker was God it says here in verse 36 and others had trial and cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and prisonment the they were stoned they were sown a suer they were tempted they were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skin and goat sking being DED Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us cannot be made perfect hallelujah amen brother brandom says here that in a message called uh uh uh you must be born again he said she couldn't get scared there was nothing about her to scare she had perfect love the love caused out fear Adam said come here and Edom and and Eve he says there was no fear in the Garden of Eden but what was the worship like in the garden of Eden he says they went up into the woods the Timber and perhaps the that the Loos that went out of god let's say it was in the form of a pillar of fire now we have prophetic privilege amen he saw by Vision so here he says that they that the lust that went out of god let's say it was in the form of a pillar of fire Halo I can see it just hanging in the bush Yonder and the streaks from it shining down when Adam and Eve knelt before the Creator to worship that's that was their kind of worship they came before that Halo the pillar of fire the logos in the G of Eden he said I can hear the voice coming from it and says as my children enjoy their stay today upon the Earth that the Lord thy God has given thee and they said yes Father so they desired a kingdom see whose Builder and maker was God but that Kingdom could not uh ex that Kingdom that existed before the fall that's the kingdom that they desired but that Kingdom could not be restored until the Lamb of God came with the blood of God to pay for the sins of the world the world that God had in his mind when he placed those names on the land's Book of Life Hallelujah before the foundation of the world Amen but God accepted a substitute blood of an innocent animal the chemistry without the life until the real Lamb of God came with the very life of God on the inside which be would be the dwelling place of of the logos amen the image of God back in the Tabernacle of a man again that is why when John saw the Loos descending like a dove he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world the lamb and the dove was connected together again there was the real Lamb of God the one that God showed in type to Adam and Eve through an animal but here was Emmanuel amen for the first time since the fall they saw the dove the image of God coming back into the image of man again Hallelujah Heaven and Earth embraced each other amen what a day that was this is what he says in the message do uh love and the dove Abode in the lamb he stayed there he was Emmanuel God was in his Tabernacle the Son of God which was Jesus was the Flesh of God a man Tabernacle that God dwelt here on Earth and now that was Christ and God became United he was divided in Eden he left the image of God but here we find God is working his way back to Eden when the image of God came back into an undefiled bloodstream into the image of man again and brother BR say that's the way God could be seen no man has seen the father at any time but the only begotten of the father hath declared him he says here in the message future home paragraph 310 when he went up out of the water he said I saw Heavens open the prophet saw it he saw Heavens open and here come descending Out of Heaven in the form of a dove and a voice saying this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed and from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it see for he is my word made manifest and the whole world has spoken into existence Hew Hebrews 11 and Satan has held it all this time but I've come to redeem it See Redemption is not only for the sons of God but it's also for the Earth it's gone through a water baptism it went through a sanctification and now the fire baptism and then you saw the heaven amen the the the the the New Jerusalem coming God down from God out of Heaven as a bride adorned for a husband amen and the whole world I spoke into existence Satan has held it all this time but I've come to redeem it so much of it has made his body and I'm coming to dwell in it the Earth is going to be God's Dwelling Place amen you that pyamid City and the lamb will be at the top of the city and there will be no more sun for the lamb is the light they'll be no more night there amen he said John said I saw the holy city the new Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven as a bride Adorn for a husband and where they settled on just exactly like it did there upon the Earth so Jesus was a prefigure from this portion I'm going to claim the whole earth because through his death redemption is come to everyone everyone whose names are written on the Book of Life all the Earth is all redeemed through this sacrifice see it can never leave him it's always there he and God are one and so John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem the sitting like a comet a dove coming out of heaven and setting upon the redeemed entire Earth to claim every attribute that made the Earth for every man that was represented in eternity and every woman is redeemed then she has been scoured and burned by fire Jesus in his fiery Temptation in the wilderness for 40 days after that notice it was ready for his ministry then think of it the Holy Ghost descending upon the Earth Jesus that Holy Blood now watch and I hope I don't go too deep for you the Holy Blood that was created by God the blood the life the creation of God Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God you see it God made in creation his Spirit see he is the beginning of the creation Now listen to what brother brand says now in paragraph 317 like how them blind people can't see the serpent seed that's right Eve was put here on Earth and before Satan ever touched the see or anything else God said to them multiply and replenish the Earth that's right but Satan comes in here and if that was Adam's son see Adam was a direct descent from God and you only take the nature of your parent and when you are born again you take the nature of your parent the heaven of heaven and your parent of Heaven is the attribute of the word see the word is the attribute of your parent then how can you deny it for a denomination oh my so the very attribute of God becomes now manifested in you amen that little size of a button now God hasn't got strong Parts he hasn't got weak Parts you got had little size of a button you can create the world and you can go live a private life on it amen why because every bit of God is is God Amen all of God is is got power to create amen that's why God was in the process of restoring the kingdom as it was before the fall the image of God the dove left Adam in Eden but came back when the logos descended Upon Jesus amen it brought back the life of the Resurrection that's why without the return of the logos or the dove there could be no Resurrection there could be no Perfection because there's only one that's perfect and that's God Amen so Jesus shed his blood to sanctify the church so that the logos could come into the church see so under day of Pentecost it was a Sanctified Church by the blood of Jesus Christ that's why he went to Calvary to sanctify the church so that the Holy Ghost had came upon him in the River Jordan could come back the pillar of fire and divide itself out into the first church see that's why there could only be a restoration when the Holy Ghost comes back at the end time for 2,000 years the Holy Ghost was was no longer in the church because they nominated amen because that church fell in IA Rome but after 20 th years the Holy Ghost came back again the P of fire appeared for the first time again to do what to turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers amen the attribute of God now divided amongst his children again the same as it was on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah so we find here that God was in the process of restoring the kingdom the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness to the land of the Resurrection that dwelt in the body of Jesus came on the first day on the day of Pentecost amen that's where we are now it's the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire in the Church of God now that's why the Rapture is already in process we are only waiting for the changing of the body but on the inside we have already been raptured I'll read the quotation right now Amen brother says how did this great py the angel of God the lust that went out of God that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness when it come among the people it separated itself and the great leaks of fire begin to come upon each one as the pillar of fire began to break up the one that they couldn't touch in the Old Testament if an animal touched the mountain it was killed but yet that very same one of Sanctified by the blood comes and divide itself up in the first church on the day of Pentecost amen God divided himself among his people oh that ought to tear the heart of anybody God tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit with each one of us that all together together Hallelujah he says on day of Pentecost when the pillar of fire came down over the people did you notice it separated itself see the tongues of fire set upon each one of them fire like tongues setting on each one what was God doing separating himself into his church see that's why when you appeared on Sunset Mountain it was the rising of the sun Isaiah says Rise Shine for thy light has come the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee his glory shall be seen upon thee this was that faith that was now going to turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers that's why he says the message of Malachi 4 he's got to do two things reveal the mystery of the Thunders and turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers he says these divinely revealed truth will literally turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers amen he says here giving the wom and Men all kind of them parts of the spirit dividing himself the Holy Ghost separate itself on the day of Pentecost God separating himself in that day you'll know that I am in the father I in you and you in me Hallelujah he says in the Easter seal paragraph 113 and you are quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already so you're already in a raptured condition when the Holy Ghost comes upon you amen notice the Pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit listen to me when those Pentecostal group up there on their Pentecost received their abstract Deed from God it glorified their soul they screamed they saw tongues of fire separating upon each and it so Quicken their body till they couldn't even speak in an Earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a Heavenly language the place where they were going to they were raptured amen when the power of God Came Upon them Hallelujah so the church fell at n Rome and for 2,000 years the Holy Ghost was bound by mindmade Creeds and dogmas but God said I will restore sayith the Lord all the years that the cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer worm amen I will restore sayeth the Lord hallelujah the logos of God will return again at the end time the dove will return again Hallelujah to be United with those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen Malachi 4 Luke 730 amen the heart of the children will be restored at the time at the seven thunders of Revelations 10 when the Lost of Dove returns again so remember brother BR says there's a written word and there's also the unwritten word amen he says when the seals are broken I'll read the quotation to you now he says uh okay before I get there let me read he says in the end time evangelism now we're going to end right here by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith that once was delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration I will restore saith the Lord he says here in questions and answers paragraph 57 so all these little things are jumping up and down hallelujah amen so the resurrection could not take place until the pillar of fire came back again the lcus of God returned back because without us they cannot be made perfect amen he said when that which is perfect is come then that which is impart shall be done away with he says here so these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication he says here but as has been every age in modern events is been in every age people let man put their own interpretation to it by Theology and will not believe God's Divine Vindication of it God's interpretation not what I say that's what the prophet says see but what somebody else says but what God has promised and what God does proves that it's God doing his own interpretation by his word amen who could manifest Luke 13 God had to come and do it himself William Bram couldn't do it so God came amen did with his back to the congregation and he started Discerning the hearts of the people amen he told Sarah what she was thinking in the tent behind him amen that wasn't a man that was God the Loos amen the word in a man many manifesting the promise for the hour amen so the Holy Spirit the Loos has come to vindicate the word and lead the people so let every man's word be a liive and God's word be the truth he says in the message Elijah how many knows that the first time Jesus appeared to lead the people he was in the form of a pillar of fire so brother brandham says here that that purifier that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness it was Jesus see the angel of the Covenant led the children of Israel the second time he appeared he was in the form of a man called Jesus the third time he appears he's in the form of the spirit called the Holy Spirit he says he's just the same today as he was when he was led the children of the pillar of fire it's only thing that it is God condescending bringing himself down amen and the next thing he comes down born of a virgin right what's God doing breaking this blood cell to sanctify a church that he could come down himself and have fellowship with the people see God loves you you couldn't do nothing about it he brought himself down and cleansed his way his road that he could come through a away sin till he could come down and fellowship with Adam again so God had one thing in mind Eden it must go back to Eden again from Genesis Revelation he was working on this one purpose to get things back to where the dove could make its way back home again amen he says it wasn't so from the beginning now if that is the same light The Same Spirit it will perform in the church the same thing that it did when it was in him for he said a little while the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me now the works that I do shall you do also More Than This shall you do for I go to my father right and here we find towards the end god making his own way back to fellowship with Adam's children as it did with Adam before the fall he says in paragraph 23 to me my brethren not because of the light he never had his speak andure taken that's that picture there because it was mean there NOA it was because of the message of Pentecost that I represent amen hallelujah so the first church the kingdom Church started on the day of Pentecost fell it I see Rome but God promised I will restore in the token he says the church in this day that received the token of the baptism of the holy spirit that the blood has been shed and that the Holy Ghost is upon the church without us they cannot rise amen so everyone waited for the return of the love they waited for the return of the pillar of fire the return of the logos God coming to to manifest himself through man again but they're depending on us for God promised he would have it and somebody is going to be there I don't know who is going to be there but somebody is going to receive it the one only thing I'm responsible is to preach it he says here and remember Israel came through many things but it was in the evening time when the token was required not in the morning not in the preparation the 14 days of keeping up of the Lamb Israel knowed something was coming this is what he says now so did Luther know it so did Wesley know it so did finny and Knox and Calvin know it this is it they knew there would come a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church again Hallelujah so Israel so Israel knew that something was coming and while they were in Egypt they applied the chemistry of the land's blood a token that they believe the prophet's message that's why the prophet says obedience to every word entitles you to the token and Israel when they applied the blood showed that they came into obedience to the word of the Prophet which he received from the pillar of fire amen so obedience to every word but from the chemistry of the Lamb's blood they came again under the leadership of the logos they came under the leadership of the dove the pillar of fire that led them to the land of the Resurrection again we see the land and the dove amen where Abraham and Isaac and Jacob was buried amen hallelujah the land where the lamb and the dove will be United together LED them all the way back to Palestine from the chemistry of the church ages to the dove the pillar of fire returning leading the bride in the Third Exodus a rapturing faith the resurrection from Mortal to immortality that's why Joseph said don't bury my bones down here the day you leave Egypt take my bones with you amen the resurrection is going to take place in the land of the Resurrection where the man and God will be United together again Hallelujah and they took Joseph's bone with him so from the ministry of the chemistry of the church ages to the leadership of the pillar of fire that's why we are no longer in the church ages we have come out of that we are now in the bright age amen the dove has come the Holy Ghost has come the pillar of fire has come to lead the church see we are no longer with Luther we are no longer with Wesley we are no longer with Pentecost but Amen brother say they did not live long enough to see the coming of the pillar of fire Hallelujah but we Are Witnesses of the return of the logos our eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord hallelujah the lamb blood was placed on the door as a token in the evening time that they believed the message of the pillar of fire so all those who believe the message of the pillar of fire were the ones that were gathered under the leadership of the pillar of fire in The Exodus amen it was the lamb it was the blood through Luther it was the blood through Wesley he preached sanctification Luther preached justification a but now we are beyond that we are beyond the chemistry we are now in Hallelujah the token the very life of Jesus Christ amen so how do we get into the house of God by one's birth we are baptized into the body of Christ Hallelujah say today the Holy Ghost itself not the blood it was not amen that was shed even at Calvary because the blood that was shed at Calvary went back into its chemistry amen went back Amen to its uh to it dried up amen but inside the blood was a Life Cell it was that life that came back upon the believer as a token amen so that is why when his death when they cried they crucified Jesus he they could not kill him because they returned again in the form of the Holy Spirit to continue the work of the book of Acts Hallelujah I just want to go on further here so we find that Egypt typed the church and the world and Israel was a type of the bride and as she came out of Egypt as soon as she left Egypt she came under the leadership of the logos she came under the leadership of the dove leading them to the land of the Resurrection amen and out promised land is the son of man amen led us from the church ages into the promised land of the son of man Hallelujah out of the world churches we've come under the headship of the dove Hallelujah the lamb and the dove Associated together Revelations 5 and 6 it's the lamb breaking the seals and the lamb took the seals and he broke it amen but in Revelations 10 it's the Dove coming to give the bride faith for rapturing Grace brother Rah says here in the message is is the sign of the end time is on the back side when the book is completed not did he say on the front side he said on the back side after all is done completed then the seven Thunder voices is the only thing that's stuck to the book that's not revealed it's not even written in the book oh my I wish I could get that that the people he says don't fail please this time I'm fixing to leave you don't fail if you ever listen listen these seals on the back side of the book at that time that the seventh angel is sounding all the Mysteries that are written in the book is complete completed and immediately the book that was open and written within is closed amen that's the Book of Life the history of the church and all those things that is closed see the mysteries of God and this is the mysteries of God the going of the church and all the other things and the Mysteries is over and when the seventh angel sounds out every mystery it's over let him be what he made whatever it might be God God's word cannot fail but now is the mystery of the Thunders Revelations 10 is the coming of the dove the Covenant angel with the open book see so the lamb all the redeemed that the lamb died for the is now inside the book of the Lamb amen as I said earlier on the woman of the well he took her from The Book of Life and he revealed to her the Lamb's Book of Life so that that book of life was closed now another book was open amen so we find that the book inside the book see was the book in the Bible is those whose names are written in the land's book of life but also in the Bible you find those whose names on The Book of Life they only make part of the story they are what you call it they are the uh the additional actors you know they don't play an important role but the main role there are those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen H Allelujah somebody use a a description once I can't remember it amen they use in the acting world see they just have the props they have there amen but the main thing is the real character and that is the bride the lamb amen and that's what it does in Revelations 10 another book was open so this is the Lamb's Book is now coming me to collect all that he died for because the Bible says the Beast that comes upon the Earth shall deceive all whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life so what are we feeding from the Lamb's Book of Life it's the mystery of redemption the mystery of our position in Christ where we come from the mystery of the Rapture all comes up he says may the seven thunders of Revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for rapturing Faith amen see he says I miss I wish he see those seals On The Backs side of the book and at the time that the seventh angel is sounding at the Mysteries that are written in the book is completed and immediately the book that was open and written within is closed the mysteries of God finished and this is the mystery of God but when that seventh the angel sounds out every mystery is over let him be what he may whatever it might be God's word Can't Fail see so we find now its manifested word no longer written word because we were in the thoughts of God but now the time has come for that thought to be manifested see the written book is closed now but now it's the manifested word hallelujah the open book The be to see if all those whose names were not written in the land's book now it's manifested word the Holy Ghost himself the word the logos in human flesh they no longer Twain but they are one the uniting time and sign the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride who is this MDC amen he shows you where you come from shows where M we not of the worldly order but we of the mesic order amen we have no beginning of days we have no ending of life that's where we started for we've got our record started even before the world began when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy amen hallelujah brother Bram says here in the unveiling of God so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is we are invited into him him which is hid to the unbelievers by the veil of human flesh see they know that Glory they read of it it's in a word here glory to God and things like that it's just a word to them to us it's a manifestation see it's no more a word it's reality amen so you now become the Living Word the epistle R of all man see God said let there be light and that was the word but now there's light it ain't the word it's the light see what I mean now it isn't just a written word to us it's a reality we are in him we are enjoying now we Behold Him now we see him the word manifesting his himself see they they stumbl at the veil William brandham but they never look Beyond the Veil The Mighty God unveiled before us they could not see the unveiling of God Amen God coming to fulfill his promised word to them is still the word they preach out of the word they preach about Luke 730 but to us we see Luke 730 we see the word manifested word manifested before our eyes to us it's the reality to them it's still a promise amen they are waiting for these things to happen now it's just isn't the written word to us it's reality we are in him now we're enjoying now we Behold Him now we see him the word manifesting himself it's hid out there because why it's veiled in human flesh amen the dove leading the eagle to reveal the mystery of the unwritten seals amen so we find brother and sisters not like the Brethren thought before that it was those Seven Virtues Of The Seven Thunders amen it goes Bey it's not even that amen butam says that the pyramid is kept with seven Thunders he caps off the pyramid and we find that he always appears at the top of the pyramid amen that's why Enoch's pyramid could not be kept amen because it could not be sort of design or it had be hued out of the mountain but without human hands see so this took a supernatural molding this was a position for God himself to occupy because if we look far into the future that the lamb is situated right at the top of the pyramid and brother B God always speaks from the top of a mountain amen he always speaks from the top of the mountain and here we find even in the new Heavens in in the city for square is right at the top of the pyramid Mountain Hallelujah so here we find the dove leading the eagle to reveal the mysteries of the unwritten word he says here in the token notice then the preparation for his Promised Land people first he had a people that he had made a land for them he had prepared a land for them and now we sent down there a preparation for it for the promised land people it was only for those who were predestinated to the promised land the bride today see he sent a prophet with a message identified it by a pillar of fire and he gave a token that they could rest assured that it was right he says this is the antitype of the church coming out of denomination not all denominations I mean the the bride some people there is some of the Independence that just as bad as the denominations I'm talking about the applied token the token agrees with every word it's the life that was in the word my words there are Spirit and they are life amen so the ministry of John the Baptist Elijah of that day was to turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers see the heart of the fathers to the children and the old traditions of the elders to the new faith of the dove leading the lamb that was the ministry of John and brother Braham says here in the wings of a dove notice the word come to the prophet in this dispensation of Grace in the water see job John saw the Holy Ghost the dove coming to the lamb revealing the true lamb revealing the presence of the Lamb Hallelujah brother bam says I thought you catch it in the water the first revelation of the word was in the water where the bride started as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming you are sent with a message to forun the second coming it started off in the water see the dove the evening light message in the water the word the two word not mixed up with Creed but came to the prophet in the water Braham says John knew being a prophet that the word had to be fulfilled that's why when Jesus died died on Calvary the Bible says he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity that just th and our pees upon him and with his stripes you are healed this is in the message on the wings of a d sickness Superstition and Devils had us pinned down there was nowhere out the church had gone wrong they went off in denominational things and Pharisees and Sadducees were washing off pots and pans the word of God became no effect but this little Dove came down and there was only one thing could take place there had to be a redeemer but being wounded broken beaten torn but he knew his way back home so from calvary's Cross they bruised him mashed him tore him like a bunch of wolves upon him he made his flight from Calvary and he landed on Heaven's doors saying it's finished it's finished they are free sickness can be healed now Sinners can be saved the captives could both set free though he was wounded and and bruised there great battle there when when even everything against him even the poet cried M rendering rocks and darkening Skies My Savior bowed his head and died the opening Veil revealed the way to Heaven's joy and an endless day Hallelujah it was the end of a suffering world of sickness and pain through his death on Calvary he made a way for our healing amen now the prophet said he was a neurotic all of his life every seven years he had a stomach problem that made him sick and at the age of 56 amen after eight sevens eight is the number of Eternity amen at the age of 56 he saw God gave him the sign of the dove of the end of a suffering man see the dove leading the man to a new dispensation remember Brandon baptized is 70th conquer convert now 17 is H it's actually a change of dispensation the number so there was a change amen when this Dove came he says here about Dove leading man and then I'm going to close I just want to read this little part here where the Lord showed the prophet now how that the ministry is now entered into another phase he says I had a strange dream his mom told him I dream that I seen you laying back sick just about to die with your stomach as usual how many diets she has cooked me and said you were building a house upon a hill a house upon a hill amen and I said I seen six white doves come down from heaven cooing in a letter S and they set upon your chest and he was looking and the one in front was trying to tell you something said they was real glossy white doves and they took their little heads and put it against your neck going Co cool cool and said I couldn't understand it said they just kept going cool cool I said oh I see it praise the Lord they form the letter s again and went up back into the skies going cool cool going back home well the little animal that I saw was 6 in Long the string of doves that Mom saw was six six is incomplete I knew that someday I'd see that seventh one that was man's suffering so on and on it went and that morning I rode up early it was a vision I obeyed the Lord I took my little boy Joseph to school he's listening to me now in tuon I took him to school and told maer I didn't know when I'd be back and I took off up into the calina the food deals and went up into the place where the angel of the Lord put the sword in my hand real early and started climbing up the mountain instead of going the Peaks this way which there was a lot of snakes see I just want to go a bit further down and along about 7:00 paragraph 197 I was going to a little Co back there a little place turn in like that this or over a little deer trail and I had my shirt off my hat in my hand because I was just Laing with sweat and so I turned in there and as I turned into that little Cove I felt the presence of the Lord I jerked up my hat and looked around I thought he's here somewhere I know he's here I thought what is it made a few more steps I said Lord you are here somewhere and I looked laying on the path and there lay the little squirrel had jumped at something and missed it and hit a bunch of CH that's jumping cactus it ran through his head chest stomach and was dead that oddl looking little squirrel he missed my mouth and hit the cha and the voice of the Lord said your enemy is dead I stood there I trembled I took my foot see and I'm just want to go a little bit further 202 I turned turned back around and came back it still laid there when I entered that Cove and the spirit of God came on me again I went around went down the mountain and went in told my wife I said honey I don't know how but I'm going to get over this Dr ravensworth when he gave me the examination he said it's totally impossible possible for you to be well he gave me a shot of pental see let just go a little bit further down here 205 and the next day something said go back to the mountain and that day instead of going one way I was led to go another way and I was standing there and looking sitting in front of me there sat that seventh Little White Dove looking right at me I rubbed my eyes I said surely it's a vision surely it is I looked and I said little Dove where do you come from just as pretty and white could have been a Pion whatever it was away in the wilderness say God Almighty who raised up Jesus from the dead whose servant I am and his word laying here open before me know that I tell the truth I lie not there said the dove looking at me I walked around I thought surely it's a vision turned my head I look back and there he said there them little white Wings just snowy as he could be he little yellow feet and little yellow beak sitting there looking at me he was watching right straight Westward I walked around like that I wouldn't touch him for nothing I looked on the upper Trail looked back and there's still watching me brother as a son of Abram I consider not what the doctor told me I'm going to be well anyhow the third day I went back I was climbing up high and many of you know the vision about the Indian chief riding that little wall to the West something attracted my attention off to a big rock about noon time said Lay Your Hands against that and pray God in heaven knows this is the TRU I laid my hand against The Rock and looked up towards heaven and started praying I Heard a Voice coming out the top of the Rocks there said what are you leaning against over your heart I rais back like this my bare shoulders naked from the waist up hot I look back and there was wrote in the courts in the stone White Eagle just exactly what the vision said that the next message message would come by I was so excited I ran home got a camera and came back and the next day I took the picture of it it was still there wrote In The Rock White Eagle Dove leading Eagle the dove led the prophet to a Fai that he never had before and the dove signified the end of a suffering man see it signified how the next message would come th the dove God himself leading the eagle to a faith which would end the suffering of man a faith that he has never known before a rapturing faith the holy image of God leading us back to Eden again again so there the dove left the god of Eden and yet the end time the dove appears again a sign of the end of suffering man a faith that we've never known before the prophet says here in the message in the prayer on the wings of a snow white love dear God I pray you for these things father you give Noah a sign you give the world a sign and you gave me a sign the next day seeing that the eagle flying oh God there's a message coming forth now and I pray God that you'll let the dove lead see Grant it Lord It's led me to a faith I never had before I know it's going to be all right so I thank you for it father in F is praying and tonight send down your message again Lord on the wings of a dove of the word and everyone that passes through this platform tonight and Yonder in the meeting across the country may your great Dove of Faith fall into their heart and give them Faith Lord for their healing remember that God is not the respector of person he could send the message to Noah he could send it to John the Baptist he could send the message to me he can send it to others when the Holy Ghost comes and give you that Assurance it's settled it's over I pray that the D will fly into every heart right now Lord with its Little Golden beak and Whisper by Stripes by my wounds and Stripes your heal grant that our transgressions be blotted out our iniquity will be forgiven us and that our sickness will be healed is in your hands father amen so we find brother and sister in broken sistance brother brandham says so he come the first time to redeem his bride he comes the second as a Rapture to take away his bride so what is it is the holy ghost coming at the end time there's no main end time leader or whatever says I am the one now that comes after The Prophet the one that comes and takes over after the prophet is the Holy Ghost John said I must decrease and he
