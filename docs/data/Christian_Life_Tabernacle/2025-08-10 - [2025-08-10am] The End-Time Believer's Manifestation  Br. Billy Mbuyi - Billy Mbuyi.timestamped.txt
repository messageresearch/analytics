[50:59] Hallelujah.
[51:01] Aren't you glad your life is in his
[51:02] hand? Let's just bow our heads this
[51:05] morning. Gracious father, Lord, if you
[51:08] really left it up to us, we were going
[51:09] to make a mess of it, Lord. And Father,
[51:12] and we can even recognize within
[51:14] ourselves that we did make a mess of it.
[51:16] But Lord Jesus, we're so thankful for
[51:18] the gift of life, Lord, and that you
[51:21] came and you gave your only begotten
[51:24] son. Father, you moved us from the
[51:27] covenant that you made to Abraham, to
[51:29] Adam, and you moved us into a new
[51:32] covenant, Lord, where he had nothing to
[51:34] do with what we can do, Lord, where he
[51:36] had to do everything with what you had
[51:38] to offer, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[51:40] accepted that you said that it's not
[51:42] what you do, it's what I have already
[51:45] done. And Lord, we can say one thing
[51:48] this morning, but we are only standing
[51:50] here because of what you already done.
[51:52] Lord, we are here. We there is no
[51:55] goodness in within our own self. Father,
[51:58] the scripture says that if there's
[52:00] anything good about us in us, it comes
[52:02] from the Lord God our father. This
[52:04] morning, we summon upon that same God
[52:07] who so rightfully decided and and made
[52:10] it upon his own account to die for us.
[52:13] Lord, may you come and visit with us
[52:15] this morning. Father, I believe that you
[52:17] didn't give your life so we can just
[52:19] come and sing songs and go home. But I
[52:22] believe with all my heart this morning
[52:23] that you had a purpose for giving your
[52:25] life Lord and Father as those that you
[52:28] have died for. We are here Lord so we
[52:31] can learn of you Lord so we may know get
[52:34] instructions from you Lord and be
[52:36] comforted by you be directed by you
[52:38] strengthened by your word Lord to know
[52:41] that Father if we live by your word we
[52:44] shall live eternally. Come and minister
[52:46] to the people this morning. Father, we
[52:48] remember our pastor and sister Leslie
[52:51] this morning. Father, just traveling so
[52:53] many places and just preaching the
[52:55] gospel. Lord, I pray that you just
[52:57] strengthen them, oh God. And Father, I
[53:00] know it was his heart desire to go and
[53:02] just and and and and fellowship with
[53:04] others and just be able to share the
[53:06] word of God. Father, I pray that you
[53:08] make that happen that the word that will
[53:10] be spoken there, it may be a blessing
[53:12] for the people that receive it. Father,
[53:14] we ask that you also that same mercy may
[53:17] be extended to us this morning. Father,
[53:19] that we may speak only what you have to
[53:22] say, Lord. Not our own mind, not our own
[53:24] thinking, but what you are already given
[53:26] to us. Lord, bless the people as we
[53:29] commit what we are to your hands. In the
[53:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray
[53:32] and ask the things. Amen.
[53:35] Amen. God bless you. Welcome all our
[53:37] visitors and and everyone in the house
[53:39] of God. I trust you're happy to be
[53:41] gather in his presence. Amen. You may be
[53:43] seated just for a moment and and then
[53:46] after that we'll stand up for our
[53:47] scripture reading. Um I know I read this
[53:50] this is from uh brother Tim. We read it
[53:52] last Sunday but we're going to read it
[53:54] again for those uh that that are not
[53:57] here uh that that were not here last
[53:59] Sunday. And this is about the Sunday
[54:01] school program. So as you heard the
[54:04] Sunday school program will start
[54:06] September 7.
[54:08] Registration forms are in the library. F
[54:11] please fill them up and return them in
[54:13] the appropriate tray. Uh due to the
[54:16] growth of our Sunday school and limited
[54:18] space, we have had to make changes to
[54:21] the starting age. Amen. The children
[54:24] must have uh must be must turn four by
[54:28] May 1st of this year. So if it's May
[54:32] 2nd,
[54:37] that's a different story. So if you turn
[54:40] four uh after May 1st uh they may have
[54:45] to wait to start Sunday school next
[54:47] year. Also children uh will remain in
[54:51] the original assigned class throughout
[54:53] the year. For example, if a child uh uh
[54:56] is in the six to sevenyear-old class,
[54:58] but it turns eight uh before the end of
[55:01] the session, they will stay in the six
[55:04] to seven year old class and move up next
[55:07] year. So, anyone uh also anyone
[55:09] interested in being a classroom helper,
[55:12] uh please make sure to see Sister
[55:13] Melinda and Brother Tim. Amen. We
[55:15] certainly appreciate the work that they
[55:17] do. Amen. Amen. This morning, we're so
[55:20] happy to be in the house of God. I know
[55:23] um uh we have uh others that are
[55:26] traveling. I know Brother Mike, Sister
[55:28] Liz, and the others. I know even brother
[55:31] Matthew, if I'm not mistaken, they went
[55:32] to a camp in Ohio. Uh we certainly want
[55:35] to remember them this morning. Pray that
[55:37] the Lord will be with them. Like I said,
[55:39] our pastor, we want to pray for him that
[55:42] uh the Lord will continue to strengthen
[55:44] him and sister Leslie and bring them
[55:46] back safe home. I believe they're in
[55:48] Zimbabwe right now, but they're going uh
[55:50] different places to minister. Amen. Want
[55:53] to continue to remember sister Christina
[55:55] and Vifas and the family. I know they uh
[55:59] they they had lost uh sister Christine
[56:02] lost her dad and we pray that the Lord
[56:03] will comfort continue to comfort them
[56:05] and uh yesterday we stopped by there and
[56:08] there were some people that also stopped
[56:10] by there to comfort them and certainly
[56:12] appreciate that and we believe that the
[56:14] word will certainly uh be their portion.
[56:17] Don't forget about the uh annual youth
[56:19] meeting. There's a lot of buzzing sound
[56:23] up here. I just said it. Um the the it's
[56:26] this coming it's coming up soon. So it's
[56:28] in August 29th, 30 and 31st. So it's
[56:32] basically the Labor Day weekend. So if
[56:35] you haven't signed up yet for all of our
[56:37] youth and for your friends and anyone
[56:40] who wants to uh be part of it as part of
[56:43] the youth, uh please make sure you sign
[56:45] up as soon as possible before the all
[56:48] the places are taken. Um there's only a
[56:51] certain limited number. So, please make
[56:53] sure if you haven't signed up uh to sign
[56:55] up as as soon as possible. Amen. God
[56:58] bless you. Let's stand up. We're going
[56:59] to read the word of God this morning.
[57:01] Amen. Are you happy to be in the house
[57:02] of God?
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you excited about the word of
[57:05] God?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. You know, when the prophet
[57:09] said, "This is the most exciting age to
[57:11] live in." Amen. I I wonder if we see it
[57:14] that way.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We um I I I I'll tell you there's
[57:19] nothing that really gets a believer
[57:21] excited like the word of God. You know,
[57:24] when we read and we see the the the
[57:26] things that is promised come to pass,
[57:28] but says he has to create and anoint
[57:31] that faith inside of you. And and I
[57:34] trust that's what he does. When you read
[57:35] your Bible, you read the message, when
[57:38] you see those things that he promised
[57:39] come to pass, something in your heart is
[57:42] rejoicing on that. Let's open our Bibles
[57:45] in Philippians chapter 2. Um, very
[57:48] familiar scripture reading.
[58:00] We'll start from verse uh the fifth
[58:02] verse.
[58:05] It says, "Let this mind be in you which
[58:07] was also in in in Christ Jesus, whom
[58:10] being in the form of God, taught it not
[58:13] robbery to be equal with God, but made
[58:16] himself of no reputation, took upon him
[58:19] the form of a servant, and was made in
[58:22] the likeness of men. And being found in
[58:25] fashion as a man, he humbled himself and
[58:28] became obedient unto death, even the
[58:32] death of the cross. Wherefore God also
[58:35] has highly exalted him and given him a
[58:39] name which is above every name. That at
[58:42] the name of Jesus every knee should bow
[58:45] of things in heaven and things in earth
[58:50] and things under the earth and that
[58:52] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[58:55] Christ is Lord to the glory of God the
[58:59] Father. Father, we ask that you bless
[59:01] your word to us. We committed to you in
[59:03] Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you.
[59:06] May have your seats.
[59:08] So this morning we uh we want to just
[59:14] for a few moments uh uh just speak to
[59:17] you and on the word of God. I know uh we
[59:20] just when we were listening to the
[59:22] message uh um uh the why Christ speak
[59:27] there's just been a theme in my heart uh
[59:30] perhaps just a larger theme rather than
[59:33] uh focusing on the title um and perhaps
[59:36] we'll try to go a different direction
[59:38] this morning and and that is we we
[59:41] called it out is to be the understanding
[59:44] that we are elected that we are called
[59:47] and we are commissioned
[59:49] and and and and to me that's the product
[59:53] um that's what that's the ingredient of
[59:56] a finished product. It's we are elected
[1:00:00] called and commission. In other word,
[1:00:02] God didn't leave any space for error. He
[1:00:05] didn't even leave any space for doubt
[1:00:07] for you to wonder. He he he laid it out
[1:00:11] so when a believers understand the
[1:00:14] fullness of what God is doing, they can
[1:00:17] come to a place where they can actually
[1:00:18] get into action. Because if you if you
[1:00:21] if you wonder if you are elected, then
[1:00:24] you don't know if you can your calling
[1:00:26] is sure. And if you wonder if you are
[1:00:29] called, then you won't be able to know
[1:00:31] if you are commissioned or not. But God
[1:00:33] in the end time he's presented the
[1:00:35] message of the hour in such a way that
[1:00:38] the believer will know that we are
[1:00:41] facing the finished product. We we are
[1:00:43] not in front of God has not left us to
[1:00:47] wonder and figure out the Bible for our
[1:00:49] own self. No in fact we're living in the
[1:00:52] day where theam says that we have
[1:00:54] received the fullness of the revelation
[1:00:56] of the word of God. So there is uh even
[1:01:00] I will say even up to the very revealing
[1:01:03] of the son of uh predition and the very
[1:01:07] works of him that what the devil does
[1:01:10] and and his pattern throughout the Bible
[1:01:13] how he started and his desire to
[1:01:16] continually deceive the church just like
[1:01:18] he did in Eden. So we we are a people
[1:01:21] and I like that statement that brother
[1:01:23] Matthew read about we are a people with
[1:01:25] an objective and we have a goal we have
[1:01:28] a direction that we are moving in and we
[1:01:31] we are not to wonder are we supposed to
[1:01:34] do this and are we supposed to go in
[1:01:36] this direction no and and God don't want
[1:01:39] us to stand still he want us to
[1:01:41] continually march towards the things
[1:01:44] which we have been given and we are
[1:01:47] people with the desire And I believe
[1:01:49] it's every believer's desire to be
[1:01:52] successful in his life of a Christian. I
[1:01:56] believe it's our desire that we as we
[1:01:58] because we have an objective to
[1:02:00] continually march in the direction of
[1:02:03] the objective. And I want to say this,
[1:02:05] the only way for us to become successful
[1:02:08] is to keep focus. You got to keep
[1:02:10] focused in the word of God that's been
[1:02:13] given to you. And I want to say this,
[1:02:15] the word of God is not given for us to
[1:02:18] beat ourselves with. And and when we see
[1:02:21] the lacking, I want to say this, these
[1:02:23] things are spoken and given to us so we
[1:02:27] can know that we can walk into them this
[1:02:30] morning.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; We we we can walk into them when when
[1:02:36] the prophet will come and it will speak
[1:02:38] about who we are and what we are called
[1:02:40] to be. Like I said, elected, called, and
[1:02:42] and commissioned. When we see we are
[1:02:45] lacking in any of these aspects, it's
[1:02:48] not for us to go and say, well, that
[1:02:50] means God didn't call me or God didn't
[1:02:52] elect me. No, God wants us to take the
[1:02:55] word of God and march forward and go
[1:02:58] forward knowing that these things are
[1:03:01] spoken of us and these things are spoken
[1:03:04] for God to bring us into the fullness of
[1:03:06] what he's trying to do. So we need focus
[1:03:09] along the way and we need to invest
[1:03:12] everything that we have into the word of
[1:03:15] God in order for us to re to reap the
[1:03:18] result of it. If if we are halfway we
[1:03:21] will only remain halfway Christian we
[1:03:23] will never obtain to the fullness. In
[1:03:26] other word for us to obtain the fullness
[1:03:28] of what's spoken to us. We have to
[1:03:31] invest everything that we are all that
[1:03:34] we are into the word of God so we will
[1:03:36] see it work. The scripture says it's
[1:03:39] either by faith or by no faith. You
[1:03:42] cannot come God is not a God that expect
[1:03:45] us to come halfway and and try to probe
[1:03:48] is this going to work. If you come with
[1:03:50] that kind of attitude it will never work
[1:03:52] because there's doubt in your heart. But
[1:03:54] if you are sold out, lock, stock, and
[1:03:57] barrel and you jump right into it, it's
[1:03:59] going to work for you. Why? Because you
[1:04:01] have no other plan. You have no other
[1:04:04] place to go. You have invested all that
[1:04:06] you know into the word of God, and it's
[1:04:09] bound to produce what God said it will
[1:04:11] produce. So we we want to come to
[1:04:14] receive the fullness of our inheritance
[1:04:17] that was laid out for us and and and the
[1:04:20] things which we have heard spoken of and
[1:04:23] how that God in the end time he will
[1:04:25] take the fullness of what he was and
[1:04:28] pour into his church. We are here in the
[1:04:31] end time and we want to experience those
[1:04:33] things. So we want we don't want to be
[1:04:36] left out somewhere or leave anything
[1:04:38] out. We want to experience all that's
[1:04:41] left in store for us to partake of.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; So this morning wi with that in mind I
[1:04:47] just want for a few minute uh uh uh
[1:04:50] speak of the end time believers
[1:04:52] manifestation.
[1:04:54] The end time believers manifestation.
[1:04:57] But when I will say in the message um
[1:05:00] identification it says it's it's it's
[1:05:03] almost uh it says it's almost impossible
[1:05:07] to do anything without proper
[1:05:09] identification. And and it says anything
[1:05:12] you do the the day that we are living in
[1:05:15] the identification is more important
[1:05:18] than any other age. You you you could
[1:05:21] take it in the natural if you want to go
[1:05:23] to the bank to withdraw some money. You
[1:05:26] you need to identify who you are. You
[1:05:28] need to present your ID and your bank
[1:05:30] card in order for you to do that. And
[1:05:32] you need to know your passcode and you
[1:05:35] need to if you're flying, you need to
[1:05:37] have a ticket on hand and you need to
[1:05:39] have your your your your ID. They need
[1:05:42] to identify who you are in order for
[1:05:44] them to let you do that. So we the the
[1:05:47] information that's taken of you is
[1:05:50] matched to something that they know
[1:05:52] already existed in order for them to let
[1:05:55] you pass.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; So in other words, if you would show up
[1:05:58] at TSA and then and show up some form of
[1:06:02] identification that is not recognized,
[1:06:05] you won't pass.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Or if the ticket doesn't have your name
[1:06:09] on it, if it got somebody else's name on
[1:06:11] it, they won't let you pass. If what's
[1:06:14] on your ID doesn't match what's on the
[1:06:16] ticket, they won't let you pass. I
[1:06:18] because why? It's the age where they
[1:06:21] want to make sure, and I'm speaking
[1:06:23] naturally, they want to make sure that
[1:06:25] they know everybody who went on the
[1:06:27] plane. They want to know everything
[1:06:29] about everybody who was a pilot, who
[1:06:32] works at the airport, and everything.
[1:06:33] Those you have to be properly identified
[1:06:36] in order for them to let you go. Because
[1:06:40] anything that's not properly identified,
[1:06:43] it it's considered inalien. It's not in
[1:06:45] the system and you don't know what to do
[1:06:47] with it and you don't want to let it go
[1:06:49] because you don't know what the result
[1:06:51] is going to be. That's why we have what
[1:06:53] we call UFO. What is it? It's an object
[1:06:56] that they they have looked at it. They
[1:06:58] can look at the shape. They can look at
[1:07:00] everything. But when they've gather up
[1:07:02] all the information about it, it didn't
[1:07:04] match what we already know. So
[1:07:07] therefore, they call it an identified
[1:07:09] flying object. They've looked at it.
[1:07:12] They they could see it for what it is,
[1:07:14] but it doesn't match anything that they
[1:07:16] know of. And let me say this to you, my
[1:07:19] brother, my sister. We as believers, we
[1:07:21] have to be identified by what's already
[1:07:24] known.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; We we cannot God doesn't have a new
[1:07:29] gospel. God doesn't have a new year, a a
[1:07:33] new new year church, a new year gospel,
[1:07:36] a new year believer. No, God has
[1:07:38] believers and believers has been
[1:07:41] identified since the the beginning of
[1:07:43] time. And every believer has the same
[1:07:45] exact identification and that is through
[1:07:48] the word of God.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; So we have to to to look at ourselves
[1:07:52] and and and ask ourself, am I matching
[1:07:55] what a believer should be like? Am I
[1:07:57] living like a believer should live like?
[1:08:00] Am I walking like a believer should walk
[1:08:02] like? Is my life identified with the
[1:08:05] scripture? Is my life identified with
[1:08:08] the word of God? Now remember because
[1:08:10] the prophet said this. He said that we
[1:08:13] have to identify with every character in
[1:08:16] the Bible because it was given to you
[1:08:20] for your identification. And let me say
[1:08:22] this, it wasn't given to you so you can
[1:08:25] look at it and say, "Wo, it's me." No,
[1:08:28] it's so you can look. But when says it's
[1:08:30] like the boy in a mirror when he began
[1:08:32] to move his hand and he saw the hand
[1:08:34] move when he began to take a step and
[1:08:36] looked at it, he recognized that it was
[1:08:39] talking about him.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; So as believers, we can look at the word
[1:08:44] of God this morning and hear me out. We
[1:08:46] can look at the word of God and look at
[1:08:49] David and see the same heart desire. We
[1:08:52] can look at Abraham and see the same
[1:08:54] faith being manifested. We can look at
[1:08:56] those that are written to here not as a
[1:08:59] stranger, not matching by name, but
[1:09:02] matching by their character, but the
[1:09:05] desire that they had displayed for the
[1:09:07] Lord Jesus Christ. We can see those that
[1:09:10] like the woman with the blood issue who
[1:09:12] said, "Oh, if I could just touch his
[1:09:14] garment." My brother and my sister, she
[1:09:16] had no references in the Bible that if
[1:09:19] she did that, God will do it to him. But
[1:09:22] the great faith that was manifested
[1:09:24] caused God to move. So you can come this
[1:09:27] morning and know that I have a reference
[1:09:29] in the Bible. There was one whose
[1:09:31] heart's desire was to be healed and she
[1:09:34] touched God and God healed her. We can
[1:09:37] look at the blood the woman that the the
[1:09:39] Lord Jesus said and they said that you
[1:09:42] can't eat food that's allocated for
[1:09:44] children. He said she looked at him and
[1:09:46] they said, "Oh, even the dog that eats
[1:09:48] the crumbs that fall off the table." And
[1:09:50] the messenger looked at him and it says
[1:09:52] I have not find that kind of faith. And
[1:09:55] we can be a people in the end time. And
[1:09:58] let me say this, we live in the time of
[1:10:01] the accumulation of all the faith that
[1:10:03] has been since the beginning of time. We
[1:10:06] live in the time where we can accumulate
[1:10:08] the faith that was in Abraham, the faith
[1:10:11] that was in David, the faith that was in
[1:10:13] all the believers. God has taken it at
[1:10:16] the revealing of the end time as made it
[1:10:18] available to the believers at the end
[1:10:20] time and we can partake of that same
[1:10:23] faith.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; So it's not an identification of
[1:10:29] accusing yourself but rather identifying
[1:10:33] the same heartbeat
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; the same desire to serve God. by giving
[1:10:38] all that they have given like the
[1:10:41] disciple will look at him and say we
[1:10:43] have given everything and followed you
[1:10:45] and one that could say oh I was a sinner
[1:10:48] God saved me they can look at the heart
[1:10:50] desire and see those that had left
[1:10:52] everything and they followed the Lord
[1:10:54] Jesus Christ and they knew that he had
[1:10:57] the words of eternal life
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; we we we are not called to to come and
[1:11:05] and and and somehow now uh uh approach
[1:11:09] the word of God by intellect
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; because if we're not careful, we start
[1:11:15] establishing some intellectual pattern
[1:11:18] in order for us to be pleasing to God.
[1:11:20] So we come and say, "Well, they did this
[1:11:23] and they did that." And intellectually
[1:11:26] we try to match the action without the
[1:11:29] heart's desire.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Intellectually, we try to match the
[1:11:34] action. I I'm so amazed, you know, that
[1:11:38] here they are. Uh Cain and Abel, they
[1:11:41] had the same heard the same exact
[1:11:43] instruction,
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; given the same word by the same God. But
[1:11:48] yet when he went, the result of it was
[1:11:51] different.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; The same exact words spoken, but it
[1:11:58] produced a different result. My brother,
[1:12:01] my sister, when Abel went, there was
[1:12:03] something in his heart after he heard
[1:12:05] the word of God and said, "How can I
[1:12:07] fulfill this? How can I better worship
[1:12:10] you?" And there was a hunger within his
[1:12:12] heart. And God revealed to him according
[1:12:16] to his hunger. What is it that was
[1:12:19] needed?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; But what I'm saying, it was by
[1:12:23] revelation. It was not by intellect. But
[1:12:26] came
[1:12:28] he did the most intellectual thing that
[1:12:31] was that he went and he produced and
[1:12:34] says his attitude was well it's this if
[1:12:39] you want you take it or you live it.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And and I want you to notice what the
[1:12:46] intellectual approach will do to you
[1:12:48] versus approach by faith. intellectual
[1:12:51] approach is only desiring to fulfill
[1:12:56] what's in the book. Is wanting to go and
[1:12:59] and and check a box and say, "Well, I
[1:13:02] went to church and I paid my tithe and I
[1:13:04] did all that that word said and
[1:13:07] therefore I'm good." But brother, my
[1:13:08] sister, by revelation is the giving of
[1:13:12] everything. I It's to wonder, father,
[1:13:15] what more can I do? And uh father, I'm
[1:13:18] here. I I don't no only satisfy with
[1:13:21] just coming to church, but I want the
[1:13:24] revening of the word of God for my
[1:13:26] generation to be manifested in my life.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; The the intellectual approach I is only
[1:13:37] satisfied with some facade and and the
[1:13:41] intellectual approach cares about what
[1:13:43] man is going to think of me, what man is
[1:13:46] going to say of me. The intellectual
[1:13:48] approach, as long as it's got the
[1:13:50] covering, is satisfied. But the true
[1:13:53] approach cares nothing about what people
[1:13:55] think about you.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; It it doesn't care whether I roll on the
[1:14:00] ground and where I scream or whether I
[1:14:03] shout or whatever the you know the the
[1:14:05] true revelation only cares about the
[1:14:08] result.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Father, I need you. It I don't care how
[1:14:12] you want to touch me, but I want to be
[1:14:14] touched this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; So the need for identification is
[1:14:23] greater than any other time. So we want
[1:14:26] uh h uh to come this morning and the
[1:14:28] scripture will say by their fruit you
[1:14:30] shall know them. So your true
[1:14:32] identification it's not what we say.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; It's not the title that we assign
[1:14:40] ourselves. is not how we claim to see
[1:14:44] things but the true identification is
[1:14:47] the manifestation of the life that we
[1:14:50] are living in. Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; It's the it's directly connected to our
[1:14:57] action, our conversation, the the places
[1:15:00] we go, the things we do, the things we
[1:15:03] learn, we we people we hang out with,
[1:15:07] and how we interact on the daily basis.
[1:15:10] That's what manifests. That's what
[1:15:13] clearly projects what the identification
[1:15:15] is.
[1:15:19] So, and I the reason I'm and I'm
[1:15:22] speaking to myself this morning, I do
[1:15:25] not want to be deceived by the devil
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; to know and and take security because I
[1:15:32] go to Christian life tabernacle.
[1:15:34] Therefore, I've made it.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; And or or because I I I'm standing here
[1:15:42] as the preacher, that means I made it.
[1:15:46] I I want to make sure that within my own
[1:15:48] life, I'm doing everything that the word
[1:15:51] requires for me to do. I want to make
[1:15:54] sure that within my own life, I'm living
[1:15:56] by the word of God daily. I'm seeing the
[1:15:59] manifestation of his life into my life.
[1:16:03] I am seeing him moving and acting and
[1:16:06] and his spirit moving upon what he's
[1:16:09] saying for us to do. I want to see my
[1:16:11] heart desire to be for the things of the
[1:16:14] Lord
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; because if we if we content ourselves
[1:16:19] with just the description and the badge
[1:16:21] and and the name tag that's never going
[1:16:24] to produce the result. What we need is
[1:16:27] like I said last Sunday what we need
[1:16:29] what when Moses even though he was
[1:16:31] called and elected and commissioned for
[1:16:33] the job what he needed was to come in
[1:16:36] contact with the pillar of fire himself.
[1:16:40] So as believers, we need to understand
[1:16:43] that it will do us no good to come to
[1:16:45] just hear the promises of what's what's
[1:16:48] in us in the book or an inheritance. We
[1:16:51] need individually to come in contact
[1:16:53] with the same God of the promise.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Let him make the promise a reality to
[1:16:58] you. And that's when it becomes an
[1:17:01] individual affair.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see you in my life. I I
[1:17:07] want to see my heart's desire change. I
[1:17:09] want to see my actions change. I want to
[1:17:12] see this word becomes a reality. And let
[1:17:15] me say this, God loves that.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; He loves for people to come that way. He
[1:17:20] wants you to come to him and taste of
[1:17:22] him and know that is is real.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; He he don't he don't want us to be
[1:17:28] limited by some education, but he want
[1:17:30] us to partake of him and to know that
[1:17:32] he's good.
[1:17:35] So we we can say we live in a time where
[1:17:39] there's such a obsession
[1:17:42] for success
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; and to be rich
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; and people are so obsessed everywhere
[1:17:50] you know you you you watch social media
[1:17:53] you watch everywhere I was thinking
[1:17:55] about you you look at especially in the
[1:17:57] younger generation everybody wants to be
[1:18:00] rich
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; everybody wants to have a lot of money
[1:18:04] Everybody wants to live in a bigger
[1:18:05] house and and and have all kinds of cars
[1:18:08] and everything and they are chasing that
[1:18:11] forgetting what their real
[1:18:12] identification is. They they watch a a
[1:18:16] Hollywood star, rich people and famous
[1:18:18] and and and and and social media people
[1:18:21] and and the flesh money and some of them
[1:18:24] don't even have anything but they give
[1:18:27] such a a a deceitful view
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; and and in doing so they say well that I
[1:18:35] have money I I can multiply your money
[1:18:37] give me your money I'll multiply. Well
[1:18:39] if you have money why do you need money
[1:18:41] to multiply it?
[1:18:47] Oh. Oh, just send $5. If you have
[1:18:50] millions, why do you I I mean, it's like
[1:18:52] the Nigerian scam, right? You You've
[1:18:55] inherited $10 million,
[1:18:58] but we need you to send $50 with an
[1:19:01] envelope so we can verify your identity.
[1:19:04] And then you send $50, then they ask for
[1:19:06] another 50. And then you send another
[1:19:08] 50, then they ask for a hundred.
[1:19:13] Let let me say this. You will never be
[1:19:15] satisfied in your worldly
[1:19:17] identification.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; If that's what you are after, it's with
[1:19:22] no end.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And and let me also say this. I have
[1:19:26] never seen anybody with a lot of money
[1:19:28] to say, "I don't need money anymore."
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, some people their money should
[1:19:36] be taken away from them. It's just way
[1:19:39] too much.
[1:19:41] Who am I to say that?
[1:19:44] But they continually want more. They
[1:19:47] continually go. Why? Because it's not
[1:19:50] satisfying.
[1:19:51] Let me say my brother, my sister, the
[1:19:53] only thing that can satisfy a believer
[1:19:56] this morning is the word of God. Is the
[1:19:58] Lord Jesus Christ in your heart. Like we
[1:20:01] said it last Sunday, what happens? What
[1:20:03] happened to Moses? Moses met something
[1:20:07] that was more satisfying than all the
[1:20:10] greatness of Egypt.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; In order for you to be a real Christian,
[1:20:16] you have to meet something that's more
[1:20:18] satisfying than what the world will
[1:20:20] offer.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Something that more satisfying than
[1:20:23] money, something more than works,
[1:20:26] something more than fame, something more
[1:20:28] than everything that the world. That's
[1:20:30] the only way to become a Christian.
[1:20:32] You're never going to achieve it by your
[1:20:34] own works. Therefore, I say this
[1:20:36] morning, let's seek for something more
[1:20:38] satisfying.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Don't fake being a Christian. Ask for
[1:20:44] more satisfying things.
[1:20:54] things of the world and say it don't
[1:20:56] mean anything to me.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; You can take it all but give me Jesus.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Is that your heart desire this morning?
[1:21:03] You can take it all. I don't care. I
[1:21:06] told my wife one day, you know, I get
[1:21:08] this people a job and you know they keep
[1:21:10] changing my titles but they're not
[1:21:11] giving me more money.
[1:21:16] You are junior this, you are senior
[1:21:17] this, you are the most senior this. And
[1:21:20] then one day I just look at my daughter.
[1:21:21] I said, "I don't care if I get called a
[1:21:23] janitor. I just want you to pay me."
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; You know, somewhere along the way,
[1:21:34] you're going to need to catch up.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; You're going to you're going to need to
[1:21:39] find out that this is just a charade.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; I need a reality. Somewhere along the
[1:21:46] way your eyes is got to open where you
[1:21:48] say I don't care what I am to this
[1:21:51] world. I don't care what the world
[1:21:53] considered me. I just need Jesus in my
[1:21:55] life because if I have him I have all
[1:21:58] things.
[1:22:00] He promised the righteous will not break
[1:22:02] bread. He promised you will take care of
[1:22:04] my bills. He promised you will feed me.
[1:22:07] Not only that, he promised you will take
[1:22:09] me into rapture.
[1:22:18] I went away from what I was going
[1:22:19] through.
[1:22:21] So you you find this people they they
[1:22:25] and and and I I I I'm so amazed how they
[1:22:29] are so motivated
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; and they give everything that they have
[1:22:33] for the riches and and for the fame and
[1:22:36] for this things and you see their
[1:22:38] dedication to becoming those things and
[1:22:41] and we see the effort they put in and
[1:22:45] and I wonder how many times us as
[1:22:47] Christian we we have such a great thing
[1:22:50] that's more than money and all of those
[1:22:52] things, but how much effort do we put
[1:22:54] in?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And and and let me not say this. I'm not
[1:23:00] saying it. Let me It's not for
[1:23:02] condemnation, but it's more for
[1:23:04] realization because and I'm not saying
[1:23:07] that you can become a Christian by your
[1:23:10] works. But I'm trying trying to see what
[1:23:12] we need is we need a dedication to the
[1:23:15] very things that we've been called to
[1:23:17] because you cannot be successful unless
[1:23:20] you are dedicated.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; You are dedicated to the Lord Jesus and
[1:23:27] and you come and you give all and and
[1:23:29] and you give everything that they are.
[1:23:32] So there they are looking for money and
[1:23:34] all those things. But I'm glad this
[1:23:36] morning there's a people that just long
[1:23:38] to be like Jesus. I want to walk like
[1:23:41] Jesus. I want to talk like Jesus. And I
[1:23:44] just want the promises for the word and
[1:23:46] and everything that is promised to come
[1:23:48] to pass in my life. I don't care about
[1:23:50] the reasons. I care about him
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; taking the first place in my life.
[1:23:57] So those people
[1:24:00] they live a life and and emulating other
[1:24:04] people and oh I want to be the next Elon
[1:24:08] Musk and and and and and Beaso and
[1:24:12] Zuckerberg and and and and they look at
[1:24:14] him they idolize those people. They
[1:24:17] literally become idols to them. They
[1:24:20] they they they they
[1:24:22] follow their regimen. Uh what you know
[1:24:24] you you have this video they they said
[1:24:26] oh this is what Zuckerberg does every
[1:24:28] day and this is what uh the days in the
[1:24:31] day life in the days obeys or this is
[1:24:33] what it does and and they give
[1:24:35] themselves to that in hopes that they're
[1:24:38] going to multiply or replicate the
[1:24:40] success that those people do.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But yet we are called to be sons and
[1:24:49] daughters of the living God. called to
[1:24:51] be the elected one. I want to say this,
[1:24:54] we said this, you cannot be successful
[1:24:58] as the world is successful.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Your success lies in the word of God.
[1:25:03] Your success lies in obeying and
[1:25:06] following the principle that God has
[1:25:09] given us.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; So as Christians, we what we desire
[1:25:15] above all is to produce the word
[1:25:19] identification. We desire to follow
[1:25:22] after the Bible characters, the
[1:25:25] characters that we put in the Bible
[1:25:27] because we can look at them and see
[1:25:30] ourselves being projected in them. We
[1:25:33] can see our lives be projected in them.
[1:25:35] We can see the very reflection of our
[1:25:39] heart's desire. When David looks at and
[1:25:41] he comes to God and say, "Oh," he says,
[1:25:44] "If you kill me," he says, "shall the
[1:25:46] rock worship you? Shall the earth shall
[1:25:48] the trees worship you?" But if you live,
[1:25:50] if you let my lips live once more, I
[1:25:53] shall worship you, oh God. My brother,
[1:25:55] my sister, that's our heart's desire.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; It says, I will look upon him until I
[1:26:02] become even like him.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; What a dedication.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; What what a commitment to the cause of
[1:26:10] God. Why? Because in them, they found
[1:26:14] that they had something that was
[1:26:16] hungering for those things. in them they
[1:26:19] they could identify that there was such
[1:26:22] a hunger for God that they were willing
[1:26:24] to give up everything for that cause.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; The question is do we have the same
[1:26:31] hunger? Are we willing to commit the
[1:26:34] same way for the cause of Christ or are
[1:26:37] we just trying to fulfill
[1:26:39] a a a checkbox to say I'm a Christian
[1:26:43] and I go to Christian Life Tabernacle. I
[1:26:46] paid my tithe and I did all of this. No,
[1:26:48] it has to be like the boy looking in the
[1:26:51] mirror where we can see the reflection
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ moving into
[1:26:58] your life, moving into my life where I
[1:27:01] can see and say, Lord, I hunger for that
[1:27:04] manifestation to come into my life. Soam
[1:27:07] says it's the end time.
[1:27:10] It's the end time that we living in.
[1:27:13] It's the representation or the
[1:27:15] culmination of what God has been working
[1:27:18] on since the beginning of time. God who
[1:27:22] created man in his image and Satan came
[1:27:25] and destroyed God's family and God has
[1:27:28] been working ever since for the
[1:27:30] restoration of his children. And God
[1:27:33] wants his family back. God wants to
[1:27:36] restore his people. God is here and God
[1:27:40] is here for the purpose of becoming one
[1:27:43] with man again.
[1:27:46] And my question to us is do we desire
[1:27:49] that kind of identification or do we
[1:27:52] desire a different kind of
[1:27:54] identification?
[1:27:56] I was reading I came across this and I
[1:27:58] thought it was uh
[1:28:04] if I could find it
[1:28:07] and it it just spoke to my own heart
[1:28:10] and this is uh spoken and it says this
[1:28:17] people and this is speaking mostly of
[1:28:20] the western world and and the time that
[1:28:22] we are living in. It says that people
[1:28:25] often they identify themselves with
[1:28:28] their work.
[1:28:30] When you meet someone new, one of the
[1:28:33] first questions is usually what do you
[1:28:36] do?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that.
[1:28:41] And then it says it's common because in
[1:28:45] many cultures especially the western
[1:28:47] ones work is tied closely to identity
[1:28:51] and purpose and social status.
[1:28:57] I it's a you you meet somebody it's
[1:29:00] within the first two like if you don't
[1:29:03] ask that you have nothing else to ask
[1:29:05] right
[1:29:08] like if they say do not ask what they do
[1:29:11] for a living that conversation is going
[1:29:14] to last one minute how are you brother
[1:29:16] where you from oh okay good that's it
[1:29:19] you're dried up
[1:29:21] why because we live in such a society
[1:29:25] where our very identity when we define
[1:29:27] ourselves is directly closely attached
[1:29:32] to what we do for a living.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And then it says why does this happen?
[1:29:36] First of all, in the social structure
[1:29:38] they say the job often time places us in
[1:29:42] in social categories. Oh, I'm a doctor.
[1:29:45] I'm a teacher. I'm an artist and an
[1:29:47] engineer. It says which quickly signals
[1:29:51] the education or the lifestyle.
[1:29:57] You with me?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; So the moment the person tells you what
[1:30:01] they do, you you
[1:30:04] now you don't do this on purpose.
[1:30:06] There's like a a a weight scale like you
[1:30:09] know
[1:30:11] man is amazing like like a balance that
[1:30:13] just knows how to just to to to build
[1:30:17] the graph automatically just by the
[1:30:20] answer. I'm a scientist.
[1:30:30] And he says the occupation signals
[1:30:33] education, income, intelligence or
[1:30:37] lifestyle.
[1:30:41] It it it becomes a means by which people
[1:30:44] compare one with another.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Am I better than him or is he better
[1:30:50] than me?
[1:30:53] It's the social trend ranks professional
[1:30:58] like doctors and CEO often as seen more
[1:31:01] successful than janitor or an artist or
[1:31:05] regardless or or or regardless of
[1:31:08] passion or integrity.
[1:31:11] So what you do your position as a CEO
[1:31:16] nobody takes care of the integrity or
[1:31:19] passion. It's automatically viewed
[1:31:22] higher
[1:31:24] as a sign of higher success. So people
[1:31:27] don't measure one another on integrity
[1:31:30] anymore. It's based on how successful
[1:31:33] you are. Basically, how many people have
[1:31:36] you done wrong,
[1:31:40] right? And the more people you've
[1:31:42] wronged, the more successful you are.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; I mean, you can't become a CEO just like
[1:31:48] that, you know? There's got to be some
[1:31:50] casualties.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; I I I mean I I I'm in corporate America,
[1:31:58] I can tell you.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And often time it's the people that seem
[1:32:06] to work the hardest that are the
[1:32:08] sacrificial lambs.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; And people that talk the most and do do
[1:32:14] nothing, they're the ones that remain.
[1:32:18] It's corporate America.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Sorry, let me continue on.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; So it gives the sense of purpose. People
[1:32:27] want to feel useful or impactful and
[1:32:31] work can provide a clear narrative of
[1:32:36] contribution.
[1:32:40] That's right.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; You see, so I do nothing except what I
[1:32:46] do for my job. Therefore, I feel
[1:32:48] important in society.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Your contribution for
[1:32:54] your work is only for your paycheck.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; And it's worth just that.
[1:33:03] What matters is what you do for God,
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; what you do for people, how you live
[1:33:08] your life in your community, how you
[1:33:10] impact people.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; You cannot measure what you are, but
[1:33:15] what you do at your job.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And and it says for many work is a
[1:33:21] source of achievement or growth.
[1:33:25] Because my title got changed.
[1:33:28] That means I'm growing. I'm becoming
[1:33:31] more successful. I'm becoming more
[1:33:33] impactful. Yeah. only on that little
[1:33:36] tree of your company.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And and and it says the achievement and
[1:33:48] meaning that people often time they feel
[1:33:51] pride when their job align with their
[1:33:54] value and make them and make an impact.
[1:33:58] And it says for most most people spend a
[1:34:02] huge chunk of their walk of the of the
[1:34:06] working hours
[1:34:08] of the waking hours at work. It
[1:34:11] naturally becomes a big part of what
[1:34:15] they see themselves.
[1:34:21] It says
[1:34:23] that an average adult spend about 90,000
[1:34:27] hours at work in his lifetime.
[1:34:32] 90,000
[1:34:34] hours in the life. And then it says,
[1:34:38] "And if you do
[1:34:40] something for 40 plus hours a week, it
[1:34:43] naturally becomes a part of your
[1:34:46] identity.
[1:34:51] You see what the problem is?
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; We we forget we we are and and I want to
[1:34:58] say it's not it's not your fault. It's
[1:35:01] not uh our fault, but it's the the
[1:35:04] Satan's e that Satan has built. And it
[1:35:07] it required us to do to be in so much in
[1:35:11] what is trying to do until we we it's
[1:35:14] like building bricks. You do so much
[1:35:16] that you even forget your real identity.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; It says this for for for social
[1:35:23] pressure. Social often it says society
[1:35:26] often reward and praises career success.
[1:35:30] So people tie their self-worth
[1:35:33] to professional achievement.
[1:35:37] From childhood we are asked what do you
[1:35:41] want to do when you get what do you want
[1:35:43] to be when you get old? When you grow
[1:35:44] up, we all thought that our job is our
[1:35:48] future, our path, and our growth.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; And and and now here's the downside. If
[1:35:57] I could just summarize it for the sake
[1:35:59] of time, the downside is that an over
[1:36:03] identifying with work can cause a
[1:36:06] burnout and identity crisis.
[1:36:10] If the job is lost
[1:36:13] and unfulfilled,
[1:36:15] you feeling you'll feel let go. You lose
[1:36:18] your sense of purpose.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; You lose what you are put on earth for.
[1:36:23] You lose the sense of your
[1:36:25] responsibility of what you're worth
[1:36:27] because you don't have a job. You feel
[1:36:29] like I'm lost and everything. And then
[1:36:32] it says that you you don't you don't
[1:36:35] know what to do when you lose your job.
[1:36:37] You are disconnected from the true self,
[1:36:40] your true identity, the loss of life
[1:36:43] purposes, limited view of self or
[1:36:46] others, and you missed the opportunity
[1:36:49] for something that God wanted to do for
[1:36:52] your life.
[1:36:56] I I say this to say, it's very important
[1:36:59] we don't we don't get lost in our jobs.
[1:37:02] It it's very important that we focus and
[1:37:05] understand that God has placed us here
[1:37:07] on on this planet for a purpose. We are
[1:37:09] here to serve the purpose of God. We are
[1:37:12] here as spiritual elected people. Our
[1:37:16] purpose, let me say this, the first
[1:37:18] thing for a believer is God takes the
[1:37:20] first place. The first priority is I'm a
[1:37:23] son of God. Your job comes second.
[1:37:26] Everything else that you do comes
[1:37:28] second. The most important thing says is
[1:37:31] to do the works of Christ is to do the
[1:37:34] job that God placed you here on earth to
[1:37:36] do.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Soam will say we are living in a time of
[1:37:42] identification. He says we the spirit of
[1:37:45] God is here to call the elect out of the
[1:37:49] church. And God is here sending his word
[1:37:52] for the purpose of separating you from
[1:37:55] anything that you were not made to be.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; When when you hear the word of God,
[1:38:02] every time you come to church, you play
[1:38:04] a tape, that word is calling for
[1:38:07] separation from unbelief.
[1:38:10] That word is calling you to move from
[1:38:13] the things of the world to move out of
[1:38:16] your own thinking to move out of
[1:38:18] everything that you are in so you can
[1:38:20] come into the kingdom of God and the
[1:38:23] promises of God. So God is calling his
[1:38:26] people for his name's sake. And he's
[1:38:29] coming in the time what uh the the
[1:38:31] scripture will say he's coming and he's
[1:38:34] calling those who were elected to be
[1:38:36] here in this generation for the purpose
[1:38:40] of manifesting what God has called us to
[1:38:43] manifest in the end time. Amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; The scripture will say, if we could turn
[1:38:49] there in Revelation 22,
[1:39:24] And I and I really like the scripture 22
[1:39:27] and 10. It says,
[1:39:29] "And he saith unto me, seal not the
[1:39:33] saying of this prophecy of this book,
[1:39:36] for the time is at hand."
[1:39:40] Now, think about I want you to think
[1:39:41] about it. Now, it's when he's talking
[1:39:44] here, the time is at hand for the
[1:39:47] revealing of the entire book.
[1:39:50] It's the time when everything has to
[1:39:54] come to the proper identification of
[1:39:57] what it was in the beginning. Because
[1:39:59] remember, and I don't want to spend too
[1:40:01] much time on this, but when says Satan
[1:40:03] had hate two books, the book of Genesis
[1:40:06] and the book of Revelation. He says
[1:40:08] because the book of Genesis revealed the
[1:40:11] origin and the book of Revelation
[1:40:13] revealed what it's going to be at the
[1:40:15] end time. So when you see it in the book
[1:40:17] of revelation, you can track it all the
[1:40:20] way back to the book of Genesis and see
[1:40:22] where he started and see how he's been
[1:40:25] working. So when it comes in the book of
[1:40:27] Revelation and say the time is at hand,
[1:40:30] he's wanting us to come into an
[1:40:32] understanding that God at this time he's
[1:40:35] now revealing. That's why said
[1:40:38] everything, all the mystery that we're
[1:40:40] hidden in this book, God is now
[1:40:42] revealing it at the end time. So he
[1:40:45] says, "He that is unjust, let him be
[1:40:48] unjust still. And he which is filthy,
[1:40:52] let him be filthy still. And he that is
[1:40:55] righteous, let him be righteous still.
[1:40:57] And he that is holy, let him be holy
[1:41:00] still." Let me say this, my brother, my
[1:41:03] sister, the the identification in the
[1:41:05] end time is the return right back into
[1:41:08] the beginning of the very origin of
[1:41:11] everything.
[1:41:14] But but what I'm says it's not the
[1:41:16] changing of of a cocker bird being
[1:41:19] turned into a wheat. No, what it was is
[1:41:22] God is coming and and it says at one
[1:41:25] place it says perhaps you were covered
[1:41:28] like a cocker bird and everything but
[1:41:30] God knew that inside there there was a
[1:41:32] seed of wheat that was in there that was
[1:41:34] to be coming into manifestation. So when
[1:41:37] it comes into identification, even
[1:41:40] though we were born in sin, even though
[1:41:42] we were shaped in iniquity, came into
[1:41:44] the world speaking lies, what matters
[1:41:46] was what was inside of you. Because in
[1:41:49] the time of identification, he came and
[1:41:52] he exposed the flesh for what he was.
[1:41:55] But he also exposed the seed of God that
[1:41:57] was planted on you from since the
[1:41:59] beginning of time.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; My question is now are we still
[1:42:06] identifying according to the flesh or
[1:42:08] are we identifying according to the
[1:42:10] seed? Because if you do according to the
[1:42:13] flesh, you will reap the flesh benefits.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; And if you do according to the seed, you
[1:42:19] will reap the seed benefit.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. We we didn't gather
[1:42:25] here this morning. And let me say this,
[1:42:27] by our own effort, because that's very
[1:42:31] key. How did we come to believe? We were
[1:42:34] like a cocker bird. We were like those
[1:42:37] that were lost and in sin and darkness
[1:42:39] and everything. But because we heard the
[1:42:42] word of God, we had we heard the call of
[1:42:45] God. Something inside of your heart.
[1:42:47] Believe the word of God. God changed
[1:42:50] you. He broke the cocker bird and he
[1:42:53] revealed the seed that was planted in
[1:42:55] you.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; So you believe the word that was
[1:43:01] planted, that was the seed that was in
[1:43:03] you. Therefore, you are sitting here
[1:43:05] this morning.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Now, let me say this. If that's how we
[1:43:09] started, then what is our flesh got to
[1:43:12] do with it?
[1:43:16] Then why are we now turning our eyes
[1:43:19] towards the flesh?
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Why are we now all of the sudden focused
[1:43:27] on our flesh? If the flesh never brought
[1:43:30] you to where you were before, how can
[1:43:32] the flesh take you into God? What God
[1:43:35] desire for you? Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; See, we we have an objective. Let me say
[1:43:44] that. Our objective is the word of God
[1:43:47] is the seed of God. And we need to keep
[1:43:50] our objective into that in order for us
[1:43:53] to produce what God is wanting out of
[1:43:56] you.
[1:43:58] But what I'm says and the word continues
[1:44:01] on. Let me continue to read on 11. It
[1:44:03] says
[1:44:05] a 12 writer. It says, "And behold, I
[1:44:08] come quickly and my and and my reward is
[1:44:11] with me to give every man according to
[1:44:14] his work shall he be. I am the alpha and
[1:44:17] the omega, the beginning and the end,
[1:44:20] the first, the the the first and the
[1:44:24] last."
[1:44:25] But Ram says in the message uh uh God uh
[1:44:29] the the the God of this evil age he says
[1:44:32] he says that the two spirit uh one of
[1:44:35] them God's holy spirit and the other the
[1:44:38] devil's uh spirit working in deception
[1:44:42] this is paragraph uh 56 he says working
[1:44:46] in deception and the people on the earth
[1:44:49] are now making the choices
[1:44:52] he's saying he continues on and says Now
[1:44:55] the Holy Spirit is here calling out a
[1:44:58] bride for Christ and he is doing it by
[1:45:02] vindicating the word of promise to her
[1:45:04] for this age showing that that it it is
[1:45:08] Christ. He says and if the finger
[1:45:11] supposed to move in this age the finger
[1:45:13] will move. And if the foot is supposed
[1:45:15] to move in this age the foot will move.
[1:45:18] If the eye is supposed uhh to see in
[1:45:21] this age the eyes the eye will see. You
[1:45:23] see the spirit of God as he grows into
[1:45:27] the full stature of God in the age that
[1:45:31] we are living in. The Holy Spirit is
[1:45:33] here vindicating the message of the
[1:45:37] hour.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my I I read it. I I was so happy. In
[1:45:42] other word, as you eat the message of
[1:45:45] the hour, as you go into the message of
[1:45:48] the hour, the Holy Spirit is here to
[1:45:52] make it a reality to you.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; As you progress into the word of God, as
[1:45:58] you eat of that manner, you become that
[1:46:01] manner. As you partake of the word of
[1:46:04] God, you become of the word of God. But
[1:46:06] if you partake of the things of the
[1:46:08] world, you become like the things of the
[1:46:10] world. I love what uh uh brother Paul I
[1:46:13] believe couple of Sundays ago when when
[1:46:15] when he was preaching and he says uh I
[1:46:18] can't really recall but I I thought it
[1:46:20] was so wonderful even though the seed
[1:46:23] was made to produce something else but
[1:46:25] because of what else was put in it had
[1:46:28] the ability to produce something that
[1:46:31] was not original. Why? Because of the
[1:46:34] exposure.
[1:46:39] That's why you know we we know that if
[1:46:42] you keep looking at your child and
[1:46:43] calling him you are a liar, you are a
[1:46:45] liar. What is he going to do? Don't be
[1:46:47] surprised if he lies one day.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you called him a liar and
[1:46:52] one day he may decide to identify that.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? And you cannot
[1:47:02] continually feed on the world and expect
[1:47:06] to be a produce a Christian life.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; We cannot expect to uh be in in TVs and
[1:47:13] movies and the things of the world and
[1:47:16] listening to the music of the world and
[1:47:18] and partaking of the things of the world
[1:47:21] and think we're going to produce a
[1:47:23] Christian life
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; that is contrary to the word. Amen.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; But we have a promise. If I partake of
[1:47:31] this word, if I eat the word, I will
[1:47:34] prophesy the word.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; If I eat the word, I become the word.
[1:47:38] But says, you eat the word, you become
[1:47:40] the word. You eat the word, you will
[1:47:43] speak the word. You eat it, it will make
[1:47:45] manifest. I don't care. Let me say this.
[1:47:48] That's why a a person you you just have
[1:47:51] to hang out with somebody, see what they
[1:47:54] do. as a prophet say I just need to come
[1:47:56] and visit you and see the type of place
[1:47:58] you hang out the people you hang out
[1:48:00] with all of that and you will know what
[1:48:02] the person is
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; why because our environment
[1:48:06] determines who we become
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; I cannot hang out with people that curse
[1:48:13] and talk bad and everything and without
[1:48:16] me replicating the same
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; if by going to a store. Unconsciously,
[1:48:26] music is playing and all of the sudden
[1:48:28] you just hear your foot is tapping and
[1:48:30] you didn't even know where that came
[1:48:31] from.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And you think being exposed day in and
[1:48:39] day out will not show up. So that's why
[1:48:42] the word of God is calling for total
[1:48:44] separation. And it's not an accusation,
[1:48:48] but it's you coming into the realization
[1:48:51] that I have a goal and I have an
[1:48:53] objective. And the only way for me to
[1:48:56] reach that goal and objective is to
[1:48:58] remain in the word of God.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Israel
[1:49:08] got out of the pro the the Egypt with a
[1:49:11] goal in going into the promised land.
[1:49:16] How many know that?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; How many of them made it?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; What says two out of how many? 2
[1:49:26] million.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Was what was wrong? I mean, they all
[1:49:35] came and you know, when the Red Sea
[1:49:38] opened and they, the scripture says when
[1:49:40] they cross and the daughters of Israel
[1:49:43] dance and they sing the song of Moses
[1:49:45] and and all that, that was true. But how
[1:49:48] come from that time until the promised
[1:49:50] land, how did they go from 2 million to
[1:49:53] two?
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; You see, there were some, the scripture
[1:49:56] says that God took them into the
[1:49:59] wilderness to reveal to them what was in
[1:50:02] their heart.
[1:50:06] A journey that could have taken a lot
[1:50:09] less time,
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; but God knew what was in their heart.
[1:50:13] And all it took was time for it to
[1:50:17] reveal what was really in their heart.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; All it took was time for them to really
[1:50:24] see what was into their heart.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; And I want you to speak to us this
[1:50:31] morning. We have to be careful what's in
[1:50:33] our heart because what jealousy came in
[1:50:36] and they started fighting for power and
[1:50:39] they came in to a place we read it 14 it
[1:50:43] says they were even talking about Egypt
[1:50:46] being better than where they were.
[1:50:53] Oh, we had onions.
[1:50:56] All of the sudden,
[1:50:59] you know, time is really telling. It's
[1:51:02] amazing how all of the sudden time
[1:51:07] erased all of the labor,
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; all of the killing, all of the working,
[1:51:13] and all of the sudden it became a rosy
[1:51:15] picture.
[1:51:17] or we had onions, we had this and it's
[1:51:20] better that we would have died over
[1:51:22] here. It's better that what is it? It
[1:51:25] was people that lost the objective of
[1:51:27] what they were doing. They forgot what
[1:51:30] they were call out for. That's why says
[1:51:33] the church has to be careful because
[1:51:35] it's Israel when they try to identify
[1:51:37] with the world that's when they wanted
[1:51:40] kings like other people. They wanted
[1:51:42] they were called out to be a separated
[1:51:44] people, a people for God. that wanted to
[1:51:47] live for God, that were day to manifest
[1:51:49] God, they were called to be a people
[1:51:52] according to the word of God,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; not according to what everybody else
[1:51:56] did.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; But yet we are, we call ourselves
[1:52:02] Christians, but you know, we dress up
[1:52:05] and our modelings
[1:52:08] sometimes our idols for the models for
[1:52:11] the dress is worldly people.
[1:52:16] Oh, I saw that dress on such and such. I
[1:52:19] got to get it, too. I saw that purse and
[1:52:22] I got to get it to it. I saw that suit
[1:52:25] from such and such. I got to get it to
[1:52:29] Are you going to the promised land or
[1:52:31] are you going to Egypt?
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Just ask yourself, what direction am I
[1:52:37] going in?
[1:52:40] Oh, I want to be like the person that
[1:52:42] you are following after. Is he going to
[1:52:45] the promised land or is he going to
[1:52:47] Egypt?
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Because it's not going in both
[1:52:50] directions
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; because the the choices you make will
[1:52:57] decide whether you go in one direction
[1:53:00] or the other.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; You cannot go in both directions at the
[1:53:04] same time. The decisions we made in our
[1:53:08] lives lead us into one or the other.
[1:53:10] That's why as children of God, I'm so
[1:53:13] thankful. I've said this before. Man
[1:53:16] comes back here says that man is made.
[1:53:18] We come from monkeys and chapandes and
[1:53:20] everything. And they are surprised when
[1:53:22] people act like that.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; No, I just decided to become my true
[1:53:28] self.
[1:53:35] That's why the message of the hour said
[1:53:37] you came from God and you're going back
[1:53:39] to God. That's why the message of the
[1:53:41] hour said you are even like God. God
[1:53:45] created you for the purpose of having
[1:53:46] dominion here on earth.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; And when you hear that, you want to
[1:53:52] identify with God.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Something in your heart says, I'm a
[1:53:56] child of God. I'm a daughter of God. I
[1:53:59] cannot do what the world is doing. I got
[1:54:02] to keep myself different. I gotta walk
[1:54:04] different. I gotta talk different. I
[1:54:07] gotta live different. Why? Because I'm
[1:54:09] not part of this world. I'm in the
[1:54:11] world, but I'm not of the world. I come
[1:54:14] from a different kingdom.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; We are not a people a people, but we are
[1:54:24] a nation. We are a people that are
[1:54:27] called out to be not part of this world.
[1:54:30] But we are not just a group of Africans
[1:54:32] and deaths. We are a people
[1:54:34] predestinated by the word of God.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; The word said that they will come from
[1:54:38] every nation on earth.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Our objective is the kingdom. Therefore,
[1:54:48] we do things that will lead us into the
[1:54:50] kingdom. And let me say this, he
[1:54:53] provided. He claimed and he said in his
[1:54:55] word, even as he told Moses as part of
[1:54:58] the journey, whatever you have need of,
[1:55:01] I will provide.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Let me say this and I'm speaking to
[1:55:05] myself. Let's not compromise with the
[1:55:08] word of God.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; If you need a job that won't allow you
[1:55:15] to come to church, I believe if you
[1:55:18] sincerely pray,
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; God will hear that.
[1:55:21] You will show him father
[1:55:24] the way to the promised land said that
[1:55:27] when doors open a Christian need to be
[1:55:30] in service.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Lord I want to be in service.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; I believe with all my heart is bound to
[1:55:36] all to do it for you. Why? Because he
[1:55:39] said anything that we ask while we are
[1:55:42] on the journey he's going to provide it.
[1:55:47] If you have financial issues, you pray.
[1:55:50] You say, "Father, I'm caught between two
[1:55:53] opinions. I don't know whether to do
[1:55:55] this or to do that." But you say that I
[1:55:58] need to tell you what my desire is. And
[1:56:01] my desire is I want the promised land to
[1:56:03] be my objective. I pray, Father, that
[1:56:06] I'm going to do what's good for the
[1:56:08] kingdom and you will take care of my
[1:56:10] need. He will do that.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because when you do that, brother,
[1:56:14] it becomes his responsibility.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; God wants you to know that his word is
[1:56:20] true. God don't want me to prove that
[1:56:22] his word is true. God wants to prove for
[1:56:25] himself to you that his word is true.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; His word is true. Not because I say it.
[1:56:31] It's because he's standing behind it to
[1:56:33] prove it.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; And that's why God is looking for people
[1:56:39] that will believe every word of God.
[1:56:42] Amen.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; And my heart desire this morning is Lord
[1:56:50] I I don't want to fall for the things of
[1:56:52] the world and every time having a choice
[1:56:55] to make. Should I go here? Should I go
[1:56:56] here? I have already made my choice and
[1:57:00] the kingdom is my destination. I will do
[1:57:03] all that I know. Now I know I'm going to
[1:57:06] make bad decisions. I know I'm going to
[1:57:08] fall. But father, my heart desire is I
[1:57:11] want to reach the kingdom. And as I go,
[1:57:14] I pray, Father, that you lead me. You
[1:57:17] hold me up into your hands. You bear me
[1:57:20] up into your hands, Father, so I can get
[1:57:22] there. I couldn't get there by my own
[1:57:24] strength. I couldn't get there even if I
[1:57:27] wanted. But Lord, one thing I know is
[1:57:29] you made a promise, and I'm going to
[1:57:31] stay on that promise.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; No compromising, living by the word of
[1:57:36] God.
[1:57:39] The challenge is the devil always have
[1:57:41] something to offer.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to go that quick.
[1:57:47] You're so young. You know,
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; you you need to experience the world,
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; liar.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; You don't need to.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Bring it on.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; You don't need to.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Sin will take you farther than you want
[1:58:01] to go. That's right.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; You don't need to taste everything in
[1:58:06] the world to know that the devil is
[1:58:08] evil.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; What you have tasted is enough to
[1:58:11] already speak to you this morning and to
[1:58:13] know that that's the path of no good.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; We want to grow in revelation. We want
[1:58:24] to grow in our knowledge for him. We
[1:58:27] want to grow in our experiences with
[1:58:29] him. We want to grow and become solid
[1:58:32] Christians. The devil is you know I I
[1:58:35] love it how you now remember he got
[1:58:38] access even to the name of the Lord
[1:58:39] Jesus Christ
[1:58:42] and he will come and says well you know
[1:58:44] in order for you to make it to heaven
[1:58:46] you know you got to obey this rules
[1:58:48] drink not and smoke not and do this and
[1:58:50] do this.
[1:58:54] Is that the scripture? Yeah. But let me
[1:58:56] tell you this morning, brother, you
[1:58:58] couldn't do that even if you wanted.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; You need the new birth.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; You need a change of heart.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; You need a change of desire. You need
[1:59:10] when you take that alcohol bottle, you
[1:59:12] put it to your lips, something inside of
[1:59:15] you, not the preacher, something inside
[1:59:18] of you say, "I do not want this."
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Not in your mind, in your heart. until
[1:59:25] it's done. You're just struggling with
[1:59:27] yourself.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; This program, you know, he built an
[1:59:35] entire program. Come to church, pay your
[1:59:37] tithes, and do this scriptural, right?
[1:59:40] Come to church, do this, and this is a
[1:59:42] list. And then once you say you fulfill
[1:59:44] the list, he adds more, you know, then
[1:59:46] you got to do this and you got to do
[1:59:47] this. You know, Jesus Christ or to
[1:59:50] obtain, you got to be baptized. You got
[1:59:52] to have the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost,
[1:59:54] the moment you think you got it, he adds
[1:59:56] more requirement.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; You can't run a race like that.
[2:00:04] The butam says God only has one way and
[2:00:08] not that you must be born again. The
[2:00:10] moment your heart is changed, God will
[2:00:13] add to it. The moment you are baptized
[2:00:16] with the Holy Spirit, he says the Holy
[2:00:18] Spirit will lead you in all truth and
[2:00:21] righteousness.
[2:00:22] Amen.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit and and I don't know who
[2:00:26] sent it. The Holy Spirit is the rest for
[2:00:29] the believer. It's not the chasing.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; You cease from your own work. You are at
[2:00:37] peace. You know he's got you under
[2:00:39] control. You know no matter what, he's
[2:00:41] going to take care of you. The Holy
[2:00:43] Spirit is the peace that God places
[2:00:46] inside of a believer. You are sure that
[2:00:49] no matter what, he's walking with you.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; If the musician could come.
[2:01:04] Oh,
[2:01:06] he says
[2:01:09] that
[2:01:11] our character
[2:01:13] is molded
[2:01:15] by what's inside of us.
[2:01:18] Now, I thought you and I want you maybe
[2:01:21] I shouldn't have even started this,
[2:01:26] but I really want you to think carefully
[2:01:29] about what he's talking about. We grow
[2:01:31] up in a way where we think I'm building
[2:01:34] my character by learning what to do,
[2:01:38] right? What to not to do and everything.
[2:01:40] I build myself into a charact. No, your
[2:01:43] character is built directly by what's
[2:01:47] inside of you.
[2:01:50] If what's inside of you is the things of
[2:01:53] the world, it will only show up in the
[2:01:56] things that you do. You you you can't
[2:01:59] take a leopard and remove his spot. You
[2:02:03] with me? You can't take an utopian and
[2:02:05] change his skin. It doesn't work like
[2:02:08] that. What you need is the unrooting of
[2:02:11] the desires of the world is to take the
[2:02:14] heart out and put a heart of flesh and
[2:02:16] put a new spirit. Then you will have new
[2:02:19] fruits come out.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we struggle with the symptoms
[2:02:23] in dealing in guess dealing with the
[2:02:25] with the actual disease. If we desire
[2:02:28] the things of the world, that means
[2:02:30] there's something in our hearts that's
[2:02:31] not right.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; So instead of dealing with the symptom,
[2:02:37] let's attack the disease. Let's give him
[2:02:40] our hearts and our everything. When you
[2:02:42] give him your heart, he will deal with
[2:02:44] that and the things the symptoms will go
[2:02:47] away.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. I repeat this again.
[2:02:51] You were made brotherham says you were
[2:02:54] Oh my says, I just don't have time to
[2:02:56] read it. He said that you were born, you
[2:02:59] were made to be a child of God to begin
[2:03:01] with, but the devil came and put a cloud
[2:03:04] over you. And Jesus came to break that
[2:03:07] cloud so you can see who you really are.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; And the purpose of him breaking the
[2:03:15] cloud for you to see it so you can
[2:03:18] hunger for the right thing and he can
[2:03:21] deliver into your heart the right thing.
[2:03:24] When you have the right thing into your
[2:03:26] heart, then you don't have to worry
[2:03:28] anymore. Then the peace of God that
[2:03:31] surpasses understanding can come upon
[2:03:33] you. Then whatever happens outside will
[2:03:37] not affect you anymore. The flesh may
[2:03:39] get hot, but there will be something
[2:03:41] inside that will bring peace and say,
[2:03:42] "Do not worry. Our father's got this
[2:03:44] under control." That's the kind of
[2:03:47] believer I want to be this morning. I
[2:03:49] don't want to be tossed about by my own
[2:03:51] thinking. I don't want my heart and my
[2:03:53] blood pressure to go up because I don't
[2:03:55] understand thing. I want the peace of
[2:03:57] God in my heart. I want the peace of
[2:04:00] that surpasses understanding to know no
[2:04:02] matter what, he's here to take you into
[2:04:06] the promised land. Let's all stand this
[2:04:08] morning.
[2:04:19] I want the program of God this morning.
[2:04:23] I want what he has to offer.
[2:04:26] But says that there's nothing that could
[2:04:29] save
[2:04:30] that could save it but a character that
[2:04:33] came over the top of it all. That there
[2:04:36] was nothing in it that it had to come.
[2:04:39] It had to come from the pure fountain of
[2:04:41] almighty God.
[2:04:44] He says in another place,
[2:04:47] look
[2:04:48] to show that it's the true one
[2:04:52] and that he thought of it. He says
[2:04:58] he thoughts of his Christian today the
[2:05:01] thoughts before the foundation of the
[2:05:03] world. Now remember, man was born in
[2:05:06] sin, shape, and iniquity and came into
[2:05:08] the world speaking lies. It says there's
[2:05:11] nothing in him at all. See
[2:05:14] if he was in God thought when he came
[2:05:18] into the world
[2:05:21] there when he came into the world
[2:05:23] speaking lies. Is that right? There is
[2:05:27] nothing in him at all. See if it was in
[2:05:30] God's thought when he came into the
[2:05:32] world he's come
[2:05:34] and it is God taught in the beginning to
[2:05:36] display his attribute. Do you follow me?
[2:05:40] He says then Jesus came to break the
[2:05:43] clouds
[2:05:46] to break the clouds back so the
[2:05:48] attribute could be displayed itself.
[2:05:52] Amen. That's it. He says he is if it's
[2:05:56] God's expressed word now nothing else
[2:06:00] could be manifested.
[2:06:02] other character had fallen. Then you see
[2:06:06] what did Jesus come to bring back those
[2:06:10] characters? No, they were born in he
[2:06:13] says no they were born shaped in
[2:06:17] iniquity.
[2:06:20] You know I I I've always
[2:06:24] had this question. Excuse me.
[2:06:37] people will ask and he said but when I'm
[2:06:41] will say that
[2:06:43] it's not even when you came to the altar
[2:06:46] that you were saved
[2:06:48] it's not even when you came that's just
[2:06:51] when you came to the realization
[2:06:53] but he said that your real coming and
[2:06:56] your real understanding is that you were
[2:06:58] in the thoughts of God in the beginning.
[2:07:02] But when I'm said that, oh I love this
[2:07:06] that we were in him and often time we
[2:07:09] try to figure out how was I in Jesus.
[2:07:11] Now remember he said the fullness of God
[2:07:16] dwelt in him. So which means you were
[2:07:19] part of that fullness.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; So when he went to the cross the
[2:07:25] fullness was in him. So that's why he
[2:07:28] could say that when he died, you died
[2:07:30] with him. When he resurrected, you were
[2:07:32] resurrected with him. Why? Because the
[2:07:34] fullness. That's why you don't have to
[2:07:36] go to the cross.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's why you don't have to die. That's
[2:07:40] why you don't have to sin a day in your
[2:07:42] life. Why? Because he paid for that.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; And he's wanting you to know this
[2:07:49] morning
[2:07:51] that you were elected, called, and
[2:07:54] commissioned. But when I'm saying that
[2:07:56] if I am a real American,
[2:07:59] I have to identify with everything
[2:08:02] America identifies with. I have to
[2:08:05] identify all the way from George
[2:08:07] Washington all the way until today.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Everything. The whole history about
[2:08:13] America is my history.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this morning, this is
[2:08:18] your history this morning.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Everything that's in here, it's your
[2:08:22] history. You were with David. You were
[2:08:25] with Abraham. You were with Samson. You
[2:08:28] were with the children of Israel. It's
[2:08:30] your history. Don't look at it from the
[2:08:33] real. Look at it from the spiritual
[2:08:35] accent. Know that you have the right to
[2:08:38] the same benefit.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's part of your own
[2:08:42] history.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; What's your heart's desire this morning?
[2:08:50] What what what's your objective? Are you
[2:08:53] going to the promised land?
[2:08:56] Or do you still desire some onions and
[2:09:01] licks and graves and meat and the things
[2:09:07] of Egypt?
[2:09:10] Because the word is here this morning
[2:09:13] calling the believer to separate from
[2:09:18] everything that is of Egypt this
[2:09:20] morning. and is calling us for the full
[2:09:24] manifestation. Hear me. Not a partial
[2:09:27] manifestation, but a full manifestation
[2:09:31] of everything that's in the promised
[2:09:33] land.
[2:09:36] And a true believer cannot be satisfied
[2:09:39] unless they see the fullness of that
[2:09:41] manifestation.
[2:09:43] Is that your heart desire this morning?
[2:09:45] Why don't you just lift your hand up to
[2:09:46] him and pray within your own heart and
[2:09:49] just show him what your desire is this
[2:09:51] morning and call out to him and say,
[2:09:53] "Lord, I want to see that within my
[2:09:55] life." And Lord, I I this is not come as
[2:09:58] a condemnation, but it's come as an
[2:10:01] opportunity for me to realize how below
[2:10:04] my own privileges I'm living, Lord. And
[2:10:06] Father, that I have so much, Lord, and
[2:10:09] to call out to you for and to see the
[2:10:12] manifestation of what you're doing,
[2:10:13] Lord. Father, you said that to the
[2:10:16] believer that every footstep was a
[2:10:18] possession. Lord, I want to walk in
[2:10:20] possession of the land that you've given
[2:10:22] me. I want to walk in possession looking
[2:10:25] towards the objective that you place in
[2:10:27] front of me. I want my heart's desire to
[2:10:30] desire, Father, the things of God. And
[2:10:33] and Father, if like brother Bamu say
[2:10:35] that if there be any wicked way in us,
[2:10:38] Lord, we pray that you take it out.
[2:10:40] Lord, fill us with your presence. fill
[2:10:42] us with your Holy Spirit. Father, you
[2:10:44] said that the Holy Spirit will be the
[2:10:46] tutor that will be given to the
[2:10:48] believer. It will teach us and it will
[2:10:50] remind us of everything that you taught.
[2:10:53] It will remind us of everything that the
[2:10:55] scripture has spoken of. And I pray for
[2:10:57] every uplifted hands I say this morning,
[2:11:00] Lord, lead us on the way of everlasting.
[2:11:04] Forgive our shortcomings, Lord. Amen
[2:11:06] father that you may come this morning if
[2:11:08] there'll be any sick among us whatever
[2:11:10] the need is this morning father we even

[2:11:33] going to complain but we're going to
[2:11:34] take the word and eat it and prophesy
[2:11:38] and move forward. Help us this morning,
[2:11:41] Father. That's our heart's desire. We
