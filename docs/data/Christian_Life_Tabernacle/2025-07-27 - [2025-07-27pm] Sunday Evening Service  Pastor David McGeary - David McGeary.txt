We grow up together and u always always God has something on you know on on his mind on his plan for us each one of us. So we don't know the day of tomorrow and the word of say today today is that day when you can joy you can be happy for what give to you and what you have and his and my moto for this church and for all my brother and sister it's in the I know it's a very very you know common you know uh uh it's first Corinthian chapter Chapter 13. 1 Corinthian chapter 13. This is my moral for this church. The love of God. We are here because he loved us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he expressed his love. Give his given. Not just declaring, not just saying, &gt;&gt; he give everything what he has. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He proved their love. He prove it &gt;&gt; because he sent Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to and the Bible saying the prophet say he was not he made himself a sin he was without sin &gt;&gt; and he has to be paid the sin which we are we was &gt;&gt; we are we we didn't have a right to be there but he made us to be a right to be in in in the age to be to be like you know to be a sons you know &gt;&gt; you know for God &gt;&gt; and u if you don't mind I just want to if you can guys could please brothers put the first Corinthian I want to read for you &gt;&gt; because when you when you read &gt;&gt; and you you just visuals you can put on your heart &gt;&gt; and that was that will be the to be the moral for this church for our body and their love of God. Their love of God, you know, so so many times we you know we just try to say it and we just try to you know uh uh figure out how to we can you know travel how we can do and so many times we are so many confusion in this world. So I want to I want to say a illustration which I want to understand how how the humanity they are how we can see. So that illustration say a man has a very very big house and uh with a twotory 10 bedrooms in a very beautiful morning when the sun is up somebody knock on the door. So when he opens the door, he saw Jesus Christ on that door. And Jesus says say, "Hey, are you willing? Do you want me to come inside of your house?" You say, "Yes, Lord." Lord Jesus, I want you. I want be, you know, at my house. And uh he said, "I have the best room on my house. I will offer you their room for you." Okay. The second day, somebody else knock on his door. So when he go to open the door, he was another one. He doesn't ask him to go to come in. He doesn't he he was not a gentleman. He just forced the door when he saw the person the Satan on that door. He was pushing back. He doesn't want it to be there, but he forced it. So after a while he fight with the you know Satan and he closed the door and he said wow what I'm fighting for my Jesus is in my house &gt;&gt; why I'm what I'm doing &gt;&gt; why what I'm fighting he went up and say Lord Jesus I just fight right now I Satan come to my door and say I'm sorry I can't do nothing for you you give me one room only &gt;&gt; you Give me one room. Oh, you want more space? Yes, I want more space. Okay, I give you the second level. All All is yours. Second day again. This evil spirit is coming every day to bother you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. So again, he's fighting. He's fighting. He He's closing that door finally. And he's remember again, oh Jesus is in my house. Okay. Run again. Lord again this coming to my house. I fight for that. Why you don't help me? I can't. I can't. You are the owner. &gt;&gt; You You You give me just the second floor. You want more? &gt;&gt; Yes, I want more. &gt;&gt; And the man takes it, give the keys. &gt;&gt; That's our heart. &gt;&gt; My illustration is to understand how much you are willing to give from your heart, from your life. He to be your owner. You have to sell out yourself. And when the Satan come the third day to his house, he tried to go to the door and open the door. Say, "Oh, I don't have the key anymore." &gt;&gt; I don't have the key. I can't open the door anymore. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus went to the door and opened the door, they able say, "Oh, I'm sorry. I'm in the wrong house." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the power of God. &gt;&gt; That's the way how we depending on God. That's the way how we offer our heart. If we just put him in one room upstairs, it's not going to help us. If just think about it, we just have in our mind, oh, I have Jesus somewhere in that room, so I'm saved. Oh, I give him the whole, you know, the whole second floor. I'm saved. I'm okay. No, we have to sell out everything what is in us. We have to give the we have to give him the key of our heart, our life and everything has to be dependable on him. That's the way you know. So we just you know I I don't want to be long but I just want to read this moral for this church. The love is the most important in our life in our family in our community in our church. Not only words that you can't declare how much you want it. &gt;&gt; You love a person, you love somebody if you don't prove their love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Doesn't have any anything to do. &gt;&gt; The words is just &gt;&gt; words. &gt;&gt; Action is telling more than what we speaking, what we telling about something. &gt;&gt; So when we love each other, we forgive each other. We give everything what we have for for the for your brother for your sister. We pray for them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you remember when I start first to pray to preach when God was here, I have three question to the church. Do you remember? So I don't want to give names but God is working and I know 100% God will working continue you know like continuous. So he's on he's working he's preparing our soul he's preparing our he's molding us every day every day he's molding us. So if I'm not okay so let's let's read together or I I I read though I speak with the tongues of men of an angel &gt;&gt; and I have no charity I'm become sounding brass &gt;&gt; or a tinkling symbol. And though I have the gift of the prophecy and understanding all the mystery and the knowledge, and though I have of all faith so that I can remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I best bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it profited me nothing. Charity suffer long and is kind. Charity is a not charity bounded not itself is not puffed up. not behave itself unseemly seeking not her own. It's not easily provoked, &gt;&gt; thinking naive. &gt;&gt; Can you listen that? &gt;&gt; Rejoined not in inequity, but re rejoiced in the truth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Beareth all things, believe all things, hope all things, endure all things. Charity never fail. But what whatever there be prophecy, they shall fail. Neither there be tongues, they shall cease. &gt;&gt; Where there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. &gt;&gt; For for we know in part, and we prophecy in part. But when that which is a perfect &gt;&gt; is come then that which is in part shall be done away. Amen. God bless you my brother. Uh I bless you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and u I want to appreciate every every love every prayer which you guys doing for us. And uh I I'm I said I will be part of body of Christ in in us. So the the Bible said like a sign we are a brother and sister. You will love each other. That's the proof. That's the proof. We are the apostle. We are the you know God's kids if we love each other. God bless you brother. God bless you. [Applause] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's all stand. We're going to invite our pastor at this time. Amen. Key of F. Let's sing that song. To know what it's like. Amen. To know what it's like. presence of the Lord. Oh, I don't know what time it is cuz time still. Oh, I'm waiting. families [Music] we [Music] because we stand here [Music] in the presence of the Lord. Oh, I know I have to say a word. [Music] Couldn't even make a sound. [Music] I gave up everything [Music] for this treasure of [Music] Never wanted to end, so I'll stay. [Music] I don't want you to go. [Music] Oh, and my heart is burning. Oh, in the presence of the Lord, we say, [Music] "Oh, and I don't want you to go. [Music] Oh, and my heart is burning. [Music] Oh, in the presence of the Lord. Oh, and I want [Music] I want more. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I want more. [Music] Jesus, I want more. Oh, I want more. [Music] I want more. [Music] I want more. [Music] Jesus, I want [Music] so I'll stay. [Music] &gt;&gt; Where else will I go? [Music] My heart is burning. [Music] in your presence. [Music] Gracious father, where else could we go? The only place safe is in the mighty rock. [Music] Father, hide us in the cliff of the rock. [Music] &gt;&gt; Encamp your angels about us and help us, Lord. We pray. We want to stay, Father, in this word. We want to stay in the spirit of the capstone, the love our brother spoke. Lord, we want to have it to all that we come in contact that the love of God may be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit, Father, that we be a burning light that the people would know that no matter how dark it is, we have hope because we have someone that laid his life down for us. And we just ask, Father, that this evening as we fellowship with our brother and let him know we'll be praying for him and ask you to bless his endeavor, Father, that he would prosper and be in good health, Father, as you're leading him in this great direction. Father, we want him to know that we go with them. Though we're absent in the flesh, we'll be ever present in spirit. We ask you to be with us this evening now in Jesus precious and holy name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you. May be seated this evening. We won't be long because we don't uh we want to have our little time of fellowship together. But so I thought what I would do is share with you my schedule uh that's lying ahead for us and then u you can keep us in prayer as we take our journey and then I'd like to share some scriptures uh what is been on my heart for uh this trip and for this year. So, we leave Tuesday um the 29th of July around 5:00 and we uh fly to Paris and then we have a hour and 50 minute layover in Paris and then we fly to Kenasa and we arrive Wednesday the 30th about 6:00 pm and then the 31st is a down day for us. So we'll try to adjust to the time uh there. And then uh Friday uh morning August 1, we preach the morning service in Kenshasa at brother Amy's uh dedication service. And then uh Saturday a 3rd uh or no Saturday August 2nd we preach the evening service and then Sunday August 3rd whatever part that we play in the dedication and then uh Monday morning which is August 4th at 12:50 a.m. So, if you can put that together, that's it. 10 to one. Now, I didn't know I I thought I was leaving like Monday night to me is Monday night, but 050 is Monday, but it's real early Monday. In fact, I don't think you can get any earlier than that. But anyway, so obviously we're not going to go to bed Sunday night, so we have to get to the airport. And then we fly Monday morning at at 12:50 a.m. Uh we fly to Harrari by way of Johannesburg. And then we arrive in Johannesburg Monday, August 4th at 11:57. And then uh so we'll settle there. And then Tuesday, August uh 5th, we preach for brother uh Amos. And then Wednesday the August 6, we fly to Vic Falls and we'll have fellowship and service with believers there. And then uh Thursday, August 7th, we fly to Balo. And then Friday, August 8th, we preach the evening service. And Saturday, uh August 9th, we preach Saturday evening. And then Sunday, August 10th, uh we preach uh uh Sunday morning and Sunday evening. And then Monday the 11th, we fly back to Harrari and preach uh uh to for brother uh Godwin uh Monday evening. So I'm going to preach for Bongai's uncle and sister Esther's dad. And uh so I got to cover my bases. You know how that that goes. And then uh so Wednesday then we fly from Johannesburg to Paris and my good friend Billy over here is trying to get me services in uh Paris and in Belgium. So whatever he lines up, I'll take care of that. He said, "Well, you got to go preach in Belgium." I said, "Why won't I preach in Belgium?" He says, "Because I've got friends there." So, we'll probably preach in Paris and Belgium and then probably try to get home around the 19th or 20th. Uh I was going to try to stretch it to September so my prophecy would come through, but uh that we're not we're not going to do that. But anyway, so we've got about 11 services, 12 services, and uh you know, just to uh just really express to you what's on my heart and uh what it is, I think the best way to do that is let us stand and turn in our Bibles to uh uh Exodus the 14th chapter. and start with the 10th verse. And this is in Exodus. And the people have come out. And we know that Israel is a type of the church. And so you can look at this personally. You can look at it from from the standpoint of the church. But I think that that we can see uh where we are and the battles that we face. And so it says this, "And when Pharaoh drew nigh because now the children of Israel has left, they've come across and now they've reached the the Dead Sea and I mean not the Dead Sea, they've they've reached the um the Gulf there, that river where they're going to cross. And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them, and they were sore afraid, and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord. And they said unto Moses, because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness, wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians, for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you today. For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever." And the Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore criest th out unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward." Heavenly Father, we ask you to bless your word. Amen. You may be seated. I think we all can say that uh we certainly know what it is to have that Egyptian devil pursue us. He'll try to fight us in our body to make us sick. He'll try to fight us financially. He he'll he'll always try to make it out that it would have been better if we would have just stayed in the world and and serve God than than going out into the wilderness. And you know, the Christian journey is a lot like a wilderness because it it's it's not attached to anything. It's a separate like our brother was saying, it's a separate life. It's a a a sellout. When they left Egypt, you really realize that they plundered the place. You know what I mean? The Egyptians, their firstborn were slain. The the the uh the children of Israel took their jewelry, they took their gold, they took their trees, they took everything, their seeds and everything. They were so vexed. They were so happy to get rid of them, you know. And that's kind of what it is when a believer prays through and really gets the spirit of God and he's got the love of God burning in his heart. You know, the the devil just wants, you know, he's almost as glad that you're not around, but let you cool off a little bit. You know what I mean? Then he starts pursuing you and he starts pursuing you and he comes after you. And and and I always love this because, you know, Moses said to him, he said, 'The Lord will fight for you. If he called you out, he'll fight for you and he'll keep you because he said all the father hath given me will come and that he won't lose one. And he said, if I started a work in you, I I will finish it. And our motive and objective in going to these services uh you know being invited, but you know, I want to go there. I'll preach the same thing there that we preach here because the my the heart of my desire is that we go forward. You you know what I mean? That we quit crying and we quit, you know, always fussing about the devil and worrying about how bad things are and and all the trials are and all the confusions and everything. uh we can come to that place that you know what God made a promise of a land and we can hold that land. We can hold to that place. That's our inheritance. That's what he spoke. And and I love that because I always like this part two because he said, "The Egyptians that you see today, you shall see no more forever." You know, I always put that scripture there. why there's no eternal hell. You know what I mean? Because that old devil, he's not going to be hanging around. You know, he's not going to be where he can rise up. He's not going to be where he can we can be in our remembrance when he's he's going to be eliminated. He's going to be annihilated. He's going to be out of our thoughts, out of our lives, never to tempt us anymore, ever to battle us anymore. and and that's worth making the journey for &gt;&gt; because it hasn't even entered into the hearts of men the things that God has prepared for them that love him. And and we've got to go forward. I I think that's all around the the the world. The bride has got to start rising up above petty differences uh above uh things that are so insignificant and and the the great ability that man has to divide instead of unite. This message really was a uniting sign. It was a It was a a sign that we had something to unite with, something to join ourselves to, something that we could become one with, that we could enter into a union. And entering into that union, we we would now have we would have a fellowship that where he would say, "I will fight your battles for you." and and oh the power that comes on the church when they let God make the way for you. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times you feel like you're in a desert. &gt;&gt; You know, when you come up against the Red Sea and you come up against it seems like an unpassable obstacle and Satan's just pressing in on you. It's almost like time's running out. If you don't make a decision right away, if you you don't hurry up and do something, you know what I mean? You're going to be swallowed up by the enemy. You're going to be he's going to fall upon you and and and take everything you have and take everything that uh that you've worked for. And it just seems like it it he just is right there to come. And they were marching. They were pursuing them. and and they came up against this great spot and yet the word of the Lord was preach speak to the people that they can go forward and that's what our our desire is if we could say that is not to speak to the people not to talk to them about great mysteries and great things but for to let them understand that God will fight their battle battles &gt;&gt; that he called them out that that that we're not a religion. &gt;&gt; We're a people. And this is another part of our body. The people there are believers just like we are. They have families. They have children. They have struggles. They have battles. But yet all of us are in this together. &gt;&gt; Every single one of, it doesn't matter what your personal challenge is. I can stand there based on the word of God, the message why Christ speak, many other places and say go forward because God will fight your battle. If you have the courage to go forward, if you have the courage, I'm going to stay with the word. I'm not going to I'm not going to back away from my pursuit of perfection. I'm not going to back away from my pursuit to do what's right. I'm not going to compromise. I'm going to hold strong to to that endeavor that I started out with. And you know, we started out with joy and here they are at the river with fear. Now fear robs you of your joy. It robs you of your hope. And all they could all that they could say was it would have been better if we would have stayed there and served sin than die out here. And I say that's a lie. &gt;&gt; If it could only enter into our hearts the things that God's got prepared for them that love them. if we could ever come to the spot that we that we know that just across that river. And what did he do? He told him, "You stretch forth with your rod and and depart the sea that the children of Israel will walk across on dry land." And then he said, "I'll harden the heart of that enemy and he'll try to go where it was only ordained for you to go." &gt;&gt; And I think that if if we could be like the children in in Israel and understand our path forward has been ordained for us. It's ordained for us. And God will help us fight the battles that we have to fight in order to achieve that which he has ordained for us. His word isn't spoken in vain. He didn't call you in vain. He didn't take you from wherever you were. He didn't even give you the parents that he gave you in vain. Everything with God is a beautiful planned purpose. And you don't have to be afraid. You don't have to. You got to know that if there's a promise across that river, then there's a promise across that that great sea that that there's a promise across there that God is able to perform that which he promised and that he'll make a way. He'll part your seed. I I think we sing that song, right? you uh if go speak to the mountain. He said if it doesn't move, God will have you fly over it. You know what I mean? But we we go in the wings of faith. And so you when when you see so many of the people, they they're they just are fighting against the age we're in. They're fighting against the spirits we're in there. that there's a fear that and it lies within the hearts of the people that they're going to be overcome by the trials. They're going to be overcome by the finances. They're going to be overcome by this. They're going to be overcome like that. It's like a gloom and a darkness that just wants to press in on the people. And and I just want to be able to be a voice that says there's a path forward. And this word is the path forward. And this message is the path forward for the believer. It will lead us and guide us through every dark spot that there is. It's our way forward. And and so we can speak to the people that they can go forward. And and that's the hope. uh you know, you go to a place and preach and you get one service and you're preaching in English, maybe it's translated in a few different languages. Yeah. You're not going to change everybody's thinking. But if you can put something in their heart that that that co causes them to want to go and pursue what they're entitled to, then then you'll see a great blessing on the people. And and that's our heart's desire is we don't have a message. We don't have a message. We we believe Brother Brandham's message. Amen. That's what we preach, you know, but we what we hope that we can do is that we can stir up their hearts by way of remembrance, their pure hearts, that they can that they can take courage and they can take hope and that they might know by these exceedingly great and precious promises that we are partakers of divine nature. And if if just that little salt gets in the heart of the lowliest defeated believer and that one person gets lifted up, it's worth 10,000 world. &gt;&gt; And so as I go, uh I trust that that uh that you'll pray for us. I I I don't know how many services that is. It's probably 11 or 12 services that we'll have. Uh but you know uh I remember when I got I was ordained to preach and the uh brothers came around and they laid their hands on me. As they prayed, they they spoke one word. They said, "Lord, let him be spent &gt;&gt; for the gospel. let every bit of his candle be burnt. And and that that's what I want. I'm not worried about uh getting tired because the if you wait upon the Lord, he renews your strength. The thing that I want to do is I just want but with your prayers to break any obstacles, any any suspicions, any questions about motive and objective that the love of God can be shown forth and that the people the the the people that the lowliest of the people can be lifted up by God's word and And if the Lord would have us pray for sick, I believe God will heal the sick. &gt;&gt; So we just want to be 100% just willing and to speak without fear or without favor. um not to lean to our own understanding, not to come up, not to try to interpret the word, not try to take it out of season and misplace it, not to try to join uh uh quotes and things together like a patch quilt. You know what I mean? That it it won't stand the stretch. But just to be able to present what the prophet of God said and say, "This is what he said." And have it be in season for their need. Every elected predestinated seed can grab a hold of the voice of this age. They're ordained to hear it. and you can't be ashamed to say what he said and stand there. So if you'll pray for us on this trip uh that uh the Lord will give us strength, he'll give us wisdom. Uh you know I I I take all my book. So, I started, you know, I I'm I can't use a computer um because I touch it and it disappears and I don't know how to f find it, you know. So, I use the book. Well, I started going through the books. I want to take this book and I want to take and then I started taking and pretty soon I had was taking all of 65 and all of 64. And then I thought, well, I'll just get my red books cuz they have a lot of message in and you you you can't take it. But you you know, you find out there's a theme that just runs through all those threads. Recognize what God's done. &gt;&gt; Recognize the fulfillment of the scripture that God promised Malachi 4:5. He promised the ministry of the son of man. He's actually was standing there performing what he promised. And if you could see that and see that that promise has been made real to you and brought out of history and so that promise has become alive, then you know that every other promise in the book also can come alive for you. And that's what he he was trying to do was to restore back the faith to the believer by opening the believer's eyes to see the word for our day made flesh. Now we heard about the word being made flesh. We have heard, but now we've seen. We've heard the stories and now we've met the people. We've saw them. We've shaken their hands. We've talked to him, had dinner with him, had dinner with the people that saw the angel that were called out, that were healed, and so many things. We are compassed with such a great cloud of witness that this is true that it's so worth living for. and and you don't want to turn your eyes away from what God provided for you to live by and and substitute that with man-made creeds, doctrines or churches because this is personal to each of us that you can live and and for us here personally and for uh the the elected in the countries that we're going to. I hope that we can all have the same hope and the same faith and be baptized by the same spirit and realize that we're one body and and that's the most uh beautiful part. So, so keep us in prayer and uh and of course as our brother, we're going to go uh have the little ice cream and a little time of fellowship and you can greet him and and uh say uh that you'll see him in Arizona and then you can go out there. Prescott's a beautiful place. Uh Matthew, you live in Prescott close to there a little bit. It's not exactly the deep Phoenix, but it's a little higher, a little cooler. Uh there's churches on both sides. I don't know if there's a church in in uh Prescott anymore, but uh you always can find a place to worship the Lord. Amen. So, we we pray for the Stephans as they head uh to Arizona. And uh we've had, you know, uh like any church, you have new people come and and and old people go and and uh one day, one by one, we'll cross the portal to dwell with the immortal. But I believe we've got a lot of good young preachers here and brother Billy, brother Matthew and Davey and Andrew and Ben and Paul and that I I'm sure one of these men that you will find that you can trust to uh lead you forward with if the Lord ever takes us. And if not, God will provide for you. So just remember, we're not attached to a man. We're attached to a word. Amen. We're not attached to an interpretation. We're attached to the a voice and we're attached to the tapes that brought the voice. And that's our ultimate. And that's our absolute. And everybody's got to have an ultimate. They've got to have the decision maker in your life. And so, you know, I think that I I would hate to think that if I built the house and I died, the house I built fell apart. That wouldn't be a very good builder, would it? You'd hate to walk up and knock on the door and say, "You better move. I built this house 15 years ago, but I'm fixing to die." No. If it's built right, it'll go on. If your heart's right, he said he would never leave you nor forsake you. But he'd be with you, even in you till the end. I hope I come back, but if I don't, I'll see you on the other side. Amen. Amen. So let's stand together this evening and the musicians can come and we'll sing a I don't think it's a sad song but we'll sing it to our brothers until we meet can at Jesus feet and we'll sing that form and then we'll we'll say a a a word of prayer uh here and u uh for our little uh time of fellowship and then we can go next door and we'll just start the first word. God be with you. Amen. Oh God be with you till we meet again. By his counsel guide uphold you with his sheep sincerely [Music] you God be with you till we meet again till we meet. [Music] Tell we me, tell we me that Jesus. [Music] Tell we till we leave. God be with you till we meet again. Oh God be with you till we meet again. [Music] is we securely hide you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Man still provide you. &gt;&gt; God be with you till we leave. God till we leave. Till we leave. Till we meet at Jesus. Till we Oh God be with you till we hear again. Oh God be with you till we meet again. When life did confound you, would his arms unfailing round you? God be with you till we leave. Amen. Till we [Music] till we meet that Jesus. [Music] Till we leave. [Music] Till we leave. God be with you till we leave again. Oh God be with you till we leave. Yes. He loves banner floating over you. Slide dead frightening waves before you. God be with you till we till we [Music] meet. Till we [Music] Till we [Music] be with you till we meet our &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, that's our prayer. God be with you. Till we meet again. Let's pray. We're going to bless the the what we have over there and and I hope that it's that you like it just real well. And uh if you don't like it, eat it anyway. Let's pray. Our gracious father, Lord, we're taking this little time to thank our brother for the service that he gave us. Father, the meals and the hospitality you show. Father, now he's going to enter into another form of work, another opportunity. Father, another way to serve you, Father. We just ask that you just carry every burden for him, Father. And when things get heavy, may he remember that you promised never to leave them nor to forsake them, but that you'd be with them even in them until the end. Father, may their light shine that people could take hope and know that there's a true kingdom and that there's a true love and a true word that defies all the negativity of this world and shines like a great light that in this generation there was a man that could turn on the light and we could see in this dark time. We ask you to bless them, Father. This ice cream and fellowship that we're having, we ask you to bless it, Father. May we receive it with thanksgiving as we go now, Father, and to have this time of fellowship. We ask you to bless each heart and each one dearly in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus. Father, I pray that you will put it upon the hearts of the church to pray for Lesie and I. Be mindful, Father, of the times that we have to minister, Lord, that you would get us out of the way and that the truth of this word would be what the people see. Father, that they wouldn't connect it to a personality, but they would connect it to the voice that spoke it originally. We ask you to be with each heart now and trust that we enjoy it. Help our brother in his efforts to move. Father, give him grace and strength and prepare the path before him. In the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Go ahead and go over for fellowship. Lord be with you there. Amen. [Music]
