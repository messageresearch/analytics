[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] amen let's just bow our heads precious
[0:04] father Jesus and me
[0:08] savior Lord that name above all names
[0:13] the name that you chose to put life in
[0:15] so we can have the beauty to experience
[0:19] it in this world Lord what a privilege
[0:22] it is to be able to stand here this
[0:24] morning Lord I pray that your Holy Ghost
[0:26] would come and speak to our hearts this
[0:28] morning Lord not only to speak it Lord
[0:30] but may you be The Interpreter of the
[0:32] word Lord to the
[0:34] hearer Lord because you're no respector
[0:36] of persons your word will remain your
[0:39] word yesterday today and forever and
[0:41] it'll never change and so Lord we invite
[0:44] your presence this morning that you
[0:45] would come and dine with us Lord may you
[0:48] come and Lord just share the word that
[0:51] we've already have inside of us it's
[0:53] just a matter of discovering it Lord
[0:55] Jesus it's just a matter of knowing that
[0:57] it's there knowing that we can pull upon
[0:59] that word of God and it just brings life
[1:01] out of us Lord because you are life you
[1:04] are truth you are the way you are
[1:07] love and so Lord this morning we ask
[1:10] that you just put a special blessing
[1:12] Lord upon this church Lord upon the
[1:15] pastor upon everyone that's in this
[1:17] building that you would just fill us
[1:18] Lord with the love of God which is the
[1:21] very message of the
[1:25] hour we love you this morning Lord so
[1:27] many things that we can go and look back
[1:29] in our Liv life and see how you love us
[1:31] how you chose us how you elected us how
[1:33] you let us walk together Lord we just
[1:36] ask this in the precious name of the
[1:38] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may have
[1:42] your seats for a few
[1:45] moments I promise the Lord this morning
[1:47] I'll speak my heart not that I haven't
[1:50] spoken my heart before but that I'll
[1:52] speak my
[1:54] heart so just bear with
[1:58] me and I I really want to take some time
[2:01] before I get started and thank every one
[2:02] of you you've been a family to me you've
[2:06] been u a body that I'd love to be in and
[2:11] um you know when you when you when you
[2:14] meet the same nature of Believers
[2:17] there's something together that clings
[2:19] you there's something together that man
[2:21] cannot describe man cannot explain but
[2:24] you know it's there you know it's the
[2:25] life of Jesus Christ and so I want to
[2:29] thank everyone of you that invited us
[2:30] over for dinners and lunches and all
[2:32] that you've done for us you you are
[2:35] truly the light and so just continue to
[2:38] feed on that that's the life of Jesus
[2:41] Christ is when we can serve one another
[2:44] when we can just love one another and so
[2:47] it was a privilege to be here I know
[2:49] we'll come and visit and uh I want to
[2:52] thank Brother David for being a mentor
[2:54] to me for being a pastor to me for being
[2:56] a really close friend of mine I know
[2:59] that we've we've went through times
[3:02] together and 12 years now since we've
[3:04] been in this church but I want to thank
[3:06] him I want to thank him for being there
[3:07] for me I love him very much amen and we
[3:10] know that it's the love of God that
[3:12] unites the Bride of Jesus
[3:14] Christ amen not
[3:18] man not man because God is not a
[3:21] respector of man but he's a respector of
[3:23] his word and his word has to be spoken
[3:26] and once your word is spoken that it has
[3:28] to be manifest
[3:30] if it's not manifested then it becomes
[3:35] impersonated if you impersonate it
[3:37] doesn't bring the life out of it it has
[3:40] to be lived for it to be able to speak
[3:43] what it is amen it is what it is so we
[3:48] just thank the Lord I I know that I have
[3:51] a lot of special friends so may God
[3:53] bless you I thank you once again from
[3:54] the bottom of my heart and uh pray for
[3:57] us we'll pray for you the battle's the
[4:00] same there just as it is here and so we
[4:04] just greet you in the name of the Lord
[4:05] Jesus Christ let's just stand as we just
[4:07] open our word
[4:08] now amen let's just turn to Matthew
[4:13] 24:35 and then we'll go to 1 Corinthians
[4:15] chapter
[4:20] three Matthew 24:35
[4:32] the scripture would say this way he says
[4:34] Heaven and Earth shall pass
[4:36] away but my words so remember it's
[4:40] words meaning more subjects meaning more
[4:45] but my words shall not pass away so
[4:48] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[4:51] words his
[4:53] promises all that he has ever
[4:56] spoken shall not pass away 1 Corinthians
[4:59] chap 3:
[5:04] 11 actually we can start from verse 9
[5:07] and just read all the way through 11 we
[5:10] love the word this morning
[5:14] amen says for we are laborers together
[5:17] with
[5:18] God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's
[5:24] Building according to the grace of God
[5:26] which is given unto me as a wise master
[5:29] master builder I have laid the
[5:32] foundation and another build it thereon
[5:36] but let every man take heed how he built
[5:39] it there upon verse 11 for other
[5:43] Foundation can no man lay that is that
[5:47] than that that is laid which is Jesus
[5:51] Christ Lord we ask your blessing upon
[5:54] this word may you feed us this morning
[5:55] in Jesus Christ's name
[5:58] amen just excuse
[6:00] me I I feel I feel like home so I'm just
[6:03] going
[6:04] to I'm just going to trust the Lord
[6:09] amen
[6:14] amen I'd like to speak this morning for
[6:17] a few for a few moments God's
[6:21] Lifeline God's
[6:24] lifeline and Luke 6 verse 43 to 49 I'm
[6:29] just going to build a little Foundation
[6:31] this was I pray that the Lord would
[6:34] interpret it to your ears as the Lord
[6:36] revealed it to me I I had a supernatural
[6:39] moment as the Lord was just showing this
[6:41] to me so I pray that God would reveal it
[6:43] to you the same way Luke 6:43 says this
[6:47] it says for a good tree bringeth not
[6:49] forth corrupt fruit neither does a
[6:52] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit for
[6:55] every tree is known by his own fruit for
[6:58] a thorn men do not gather figs this is a
[7:02] paradox nor a nor a Bramble Bush gather
[7:05] they grapes a good man out of the good
[7:08] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[7:11] that which is
[7:13] good and an evil man out of the evil
[7:16] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[7:19] that which is evil for of the abundance
[7:22] of the heart his mouth
[7:25] speaketh verse
[7:27] 46 and why call ye me Lord Lord and do
[7:31] not the things which I say and brother
[7:33] Bram says when he's Lord over something
[7:36] he has
[7:37] Dominion it means that he has he's your
[7:41] ownership he is your lord lord lord he
[7:45] owns you there's something that he did
[7:47] for you so you are no longer nobody
[7:49] else's but the Lord amen and it says and
[7:54] why do you call me Lord Lord and do not
[7:56] the things which I say who whosoever
[8:00] come cometh to me and heareth my sayings
[8:04] and doeth them I will show you to whom
[8:07] he is like he is like a man which built
[8:10] that built a house and dig deep dig deep
[8:14] meaning we get all the roots out meaning
[8:17] we get all the trash out meaning we
[8:19] level the ground meaning that all of
[8:21] that it says and laid the foundation on
[8:24] the Rock and when the flood arose the
[8:28] stream be womenly upon the house upon
[8:32] that house and could not shake it for it
[8:35] was founded upon a rock because it was
[8:39] founded upon a
[8:42] revelation and no man could build
[8:45] thereon because God has already built
[8:47] that
[8:50] Foundation but he that heareth and do it
[8:53] not is like a man that is without a
[8:56] foundation built a house upon the Earth
[9:00] now you can still build a
[9:03] house and it's on it's upon this Earth
[9:06] it's not upon the Revelation it's not
[9:08] upon the rock it's not upon the
[9:10] foundation that he's already built for
[9:12] you and you can build it upon the
[9:15] Earth against which the Sham did beat
[9:18] womenly and immediately it
[9:21] fell Heavens or n shall pass
[9:26] away and the ruin of the house was great
[9:32] Isaiah
[9:33] 59 verse 19-
[9:37] 21 I just like to read a few scripture
[9:39] and then and then we'll get into God's
[9:42] Lifeline think about this God's LIF
[9:47] line so shall they fear verse 19 so
[9:50] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[9:52] from the West and his glory from the
[9:55] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[9:58] come in like a blood the spirit of the
[10:01] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[10:05] him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion
[10:09] and unto them that turn from
[10:12] transgression in Jacob sayeth the
[10:17] Lord verse
[10:19] 21 and as for me this is my Covenant to
[10:23] them with them saith the Lord now this
[10:26] is the word of God to you this is the
[10:27] word of God directly to to you my spirit
[10:31] that is upon thee and my words which I
[10:34] have put in thy mouth shall not dep part
[10:37] out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of
[10:41] thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy
[10:44] seeds seeds saith the Lord from
[10:48] henceforth and
[10:49] forever so now he has placed something
[10:52] inside of
[10:54] you that is already in you his spirit is
[10:57] inside of you his word is inside of you
[11:00] and it's in your
[11:02] mouth it's what you speak it's what you
[11:04] are and
[11:06] so from the beginning ever since mankind
[11:10] has fallen God has always provided a
[11:14] life
[11:16] line in the
[11:18] beginning when Abel and Cain were asked
[11:20] to worship one of them built a house
[11:23] upon the
[11:24] earth and the other one built a house
[11:27] upon a revelation
[11:29] and he grabbed a hold of the lifeline he
[11:33] grabbed a hold of knowing what the
[11:35] Revelation was because he knew that he
[11:38] took a blood an innocent life for him to
[11:43] continue to
[11:45] live he knew that the Revelation might
[11:48] have been
[11:49] messy he knew that the way that it was
[11:51] done it was such a mess but they took an
[11:54] innocent life to redeem that back for
[11:57] him to be able to have Grace for him to
[11:59] be able to know what it's like to
[12:04] die no animal has been killed and had
[12:08] that could you imagine have has anybody
[12:10] killed the
[12:14] chicken I when we when we were in
[12:17] Romania you know back in the day my dad
[12:19] and mom would go to the grocery store
[12:22] which was the farmers's market and so
[12:25] you you picked up your life
[12:27] chicken you know it wasn't it wasn't
[12:30] Frozen and put in the fridge you you
[12:32] said I want that one and so you would
[12:34] bring it home it would be stringed
[12:36] around its feet and you know that way it
[12:38] wouldn't be able to run and and they
[12:40] would just sitting in the front yard and
[12:42] my mom's like hey we need we need that
[12:43] chicken cut said okay it's you know to
[12:46] to kill a to kill a life it doesn't
[12:49] bring it doesn't bring a a a good
[12:52] feeling you you it something happens
[12:55] there's Mercy there for that individual
[12:57] there's Mercy there for even for that
[12:58] little a chicken even though you know
[13:00] that it's the actual thing feeding you
[13:02] when you when you commit that act when
[13:04] that happens there's something that out
[13:06] of a man just starts feeling that nature
[13:09] of of of of
[13:12] mercy and so Abel was able to catch that
[13:15] Revelation But realize this there's
[13:18] always time that people regardless of
[13:22] the condition they were always able to
[13:24] overcome because there was a Lifeline
[13:26] that was given for them to hold on to
[13:29] too and here comes the generation
[13:32] through Abraham and here comes the
[13:34] generation through Isaac and here comes
[13:37] the generation through Jacob and here
[13:39] comes the generation going through
[13:41] Joseph and now God has created a
[13:44] people and now God has created a bride I
[13:48] can
[13:48] say but every
[13:51] time that God had gave him something to
[13:55] hold on to as soon as that went off the
[13:58] scene as a prophet or as a judge you
[14:01] guys remember they would all always go
[14:04] back the other way they will always go
[14:06] back to building false gods they would
[14:09] always be going back to a
[14:11] tradition instead of holding on to the
[14:13] very line to the very life that was
[14:15] given in that
[14:18] day here comes
[14:21] Moses and he brings him the
[14:24] word and they're
[14:26] traveling and after a while they go off
[14:30] off and here comes judges and again God
[14:34] gives them a judge and as soon as the
[14:36] judge gets off the scene here they are
[14:38] to travel again and here they are back
[14:40] into the tradition but God always gave
[14:43] them a word in the day that they were
[14:45] living in because they knew how to
[14:48] recognize
[14:52] him and brother Braham says to receive
[14:55] the Holy Ghost to know you have the Holy
[14:58] Ghost is to receive the word for your
[15:02] day the word for your day identifies the
[15:06] Holy Ghost Inside of You the word for
[15:08] your day identifies the character of
[15:13] God Amen it identifies the character of
[15:16] God in the age that you're living in I
[15:19] can't go back and live in the days of
[15:23] Moses that's there as a testimony that's
[15:26] there as a living word that I can grab a
[15:29] hold of and put that word today to take
[15:32] me out of an exodus and bring me over
[15:34] into a Promised
[15:43] Land brother Brandon would say this so
[15:46] keep that in mind God's
[15:48] Lifeline there's always a Lifeline
[15:51] there's always something that you can
[15:52] grab a hold of there's always a word
[15:54] that God had left for you to grab a hold
[15:56] of and regardless of the condition
[16:00] during the time that you're living and
[16:02] God will bring it to pass right and this
[16:07] word is not a word that's been given to
[16:09] you
[16:10] today this word is a word that has been
[16:12] predestinated before the foundation of
[16:15] the world because he had placed you in
[16:17] this place to be able to believe the
[16:20] very word that was for this
[16:22] age and the word of the hour produces a
[16:26] Rapture the word of the hour produces a
[16:29] change the word of the hour produces
[16:32] salvation the word of the hour produces
[16:35] healing the word of the hour produces a
[16:41] resurrection there's no other
[16:44] word because it has to come through the
[16:47] mouth of a
[16:51] prophet brother Bram says and things
[16:54] that are to
[16:57] be it says I believe that God in the
[17:00] beginning that Noah was the word for
[17:03] that day for his
[17:05] message now Along come after that come
[17:09] Moses now Moses could not have taken
[17:12] Noah's word he could not build a ship
[17:16] and Flo them out of Egypt now think
[17:19] about that Moses couldn't build a ship
[17:23] amen because the ship has already been
[17:25] built the flood has already happened he
[17:28] could did not build a ship and Flo them
[17:30] out of Egypt down the Nile River or to
[17:34] the promised land and so forth his
[17:37] message didn't work in Noah's day that
[17:40] was the part of God's word that was
[17:43] Vindicated to be the truth by
[17:48] Moses neither could
[17:50] Jesus have had Moses's word neither
[17:54] could Luther could have not maintained
[17:58] the word of the C Catholic church now
[17:59] think about that because Luther was
[18:01] given a word Wesley was given a word p
[18:05] Pentecost was given a word Wesley could
[18:08] not maintain Luther's word and the
[18:11] Pentecostal listen they could not take
[18:14] the Methodist
[18:15] word the church is
[18:19] growing each age it's LED in the
[18:23] scripture
[18:24] here so God through the Holy Spirit
[18:28] reveals his word by manifesting it and
[18:31] vindicating it himself himself showing
[18:35] that it's his word being brought to pass
[18:39] in the day that it's
[18:43] promised Jesus said he says if you can't
[18:46] believe me believe the works that I do
[18:49] for they testify who he
[18:52] was if anyone could have known the
[18:56] scripture now think about that
[18:59] if the Pharisees and the Sadducees would
[19:02] have known the scripture and it wouldn't
[19:04] have been a tradition they would have
[19:06] recognized the Son of
[19:08] God but for them thinking that by
[19:12] obeying the law by traditionalized their
[19:16] life they put a period to the word of
[19:18] God instead of a comma like the like the
[19:20] prophet would say all of a sudden it
[19:23] became
[19:24] legalism and because of legalism they
[19:27] missed the very word being
[19:31] manifested it says now he comes so oddly
[19:34] so strange that the people didn't want
[19:37] to believe him because he being a man
[19:40] was making himself God so he was God in
[19:45] form and God was in Christ reconciling
[19:50] the world to
[19:54] himself so think about that as he was
[19:57] living on this Earth Earth God that was
[20:00] in Jesus Christ he was reconciling the
[20:03] word the world into himself because it
[20:07] was that life now that was able to carry
[20:12] you through whatever age that you were
[20:15] predestinated to be in so you can be an
[20:20] overcomer because it's not you that does
[20:22] the
[20:25] work I I uh we were Fellowship in in the
[20:29] morning study and brother Matthew was
[20:32] just sharing something that another
[20:33] preacher was saying he says God don't
[20:35] need
[20:36] workers he doesn't need workers he needs
[20:40] vessels so he can work through
[20:43] them he doesn't need
[20:46] tradition you can do things out of
[20:49] tradition but when the word of God
[20:51] speaks to your heart you obey it and to
[20:53] do it because that is the life of Jesus
[20:56] Christ when a father speaks to a son son
[20:59] a son obeys the father and he becomes
[21:02] faithful he becomes pleasing unto his
[21:07] Lord he says and no man can do these
[21:11] Works without God be with him and as we
[21:14] know Nicodemus said that and the hrin uh
[21:19] hrin believed that it says now we know
[21:21] that he says if they would have known
[21:24] the word he said you would have known
[21:27] Moses
[21:29] you would have known
[21:31] me because Moses wrote Of Me So what had
[21:37] happened now is is even though there was
[21:42] law it was now
[21:45] magnified it was still the same word but
[21:49] now it was
[21:53] magnified because Moses wrote of me and
[21:56] we look if they had looked back in the
[21:59] scripture when see say see what the
[22:02] Messiah was supposed to do then they
[22:05] would have known him by
[22:07] Vindication that God through Christ was
[22:11] reconciling the world to himself and
[22:14] bring to pass all the promises that was
[22:18] to be that was of the Messiah he was to
[22:22] do Jesus bore record of that word
[22:26] hallelujah
[22:28] how could you bear record of God's
[22:31] word a record has to be known a record
[22:34] has to be seen it says making the word
[22:38] live for that
[22:41] day and I believe it's the same thing
[22:44] that we live in today God bearing record
[22:47] of his word by vindicating what he has
[22:51] said he would
[22:54] do now we know that in this last day now
[22:57] listen to this and we know that this is
[23:00] the day of
[23:01] salvation where God is calling men from
[23:04] the world from a life of sin unto a life
[23:08] of
[23:11] service God is calling our life from a
[23:14] life of sin from a life of tradition
[23:17] from a life that we can create with our
[23:20] own atmosphere into a life of
[23:23] service a life of service for
[23:26] him and in the that God has poured out
[23:29] his Spirit from on high it says great
[23:32] signs and wonders are to accompany the
[23:35] ministry of this day it says the when
[23:38] the former and latter rain are falling
[23:41] together and we know that there's
[23:43] supposed to be great signs and wonders
[23:45] which is many it says which in many
[23:47] great denominations this is turned down
[23:51] now think about this
[23:55] because God is is the word in the
[23:59] beginning was the word and the Word was
[24:02] with God and the Word was God so God had
[24:05] always left the part of
[24:08] himself Jesus Christ was the fullness of
[24:11] the Gospel but he had always left a part
[24:14] of himself for his bride to grab a hold
[24:19] of and be changed to the promise of that
[24:24] age in the days of Moses the promise was
[24:26] is they're going to come out of an age
[24:28] of slavery out of Egypt into a promised
[24:31] land and the pro the prophet would the
[24:33] prophet would take this and he would say
[24:35] he says Egypt represents a church the
[24:40] promised land represents the bride and
[24:44] here comes a bride out of a
[24:47] church because it's the promised land
[24:49] it's the life of Jesus
[24:51] Christ how many remember the the story
[24:54] of the shunamite
[24:56] woman it really impressed me that was
[24:58] reading it just the way that the Lord
[25:00] just describes it in there Here Comes
[25:02] Elisha the prophet and he's traveling
[25:04] towards I believe isuna shuna the name
[25:07] of the town and he's coming
[25:10] through he was he was traveling through
[25:14] and this
[25:17] woman she notices that he keeps coming
[25:20] through and he's a man of
[25:22] God and she stops him one day and she's
[25:27] offering him a meal
[25:30] he sat down and he ate bread and I
[25:33] believe he had a servant his name was
[25:35] GES gesi
[25:36] gazi uh
[25:42] and she was older in age she was
[25:46] married now think about this this is
[25:49] powerful because God is a respector of
[25:52] his
[25:53] word she was able to grab a hold of
[25:56] something that not only not only did it
[25:58] bless her but it actually brought a
[26:01] resurrection it actually brought life
[26:03] because she recognized the word of God
[26:06] that's because she knew what was inside
[26:10] the man of God she knew that the word
[26:13] that was inside of that Prophet was her
[26:16] very Hope was her very life so here she
[26:19] comes and she's serving the prophet and
[26:22] all of a sudden because the scripture
[26:24] says that because he's been traveling so
[26:25] much actually as a matter of fact she
[26:27] actually built him room and now he would
[26:30] always come and he would sit inside the
[26:32] room and he would sleep there she put a
[26:34] bed she put a bed and she put she put
[26:37] bread and she put food in there and he
[26:39] would come through and he would stay
[26:40] there and when the prophet had noticed
[26:42] the love of this
[26:44] woman there was something inside the
[26:46] prophet that would say GES go get her
[26:49] and i' would like to find out what she
[26:51] has a need
[26:53] of and she said she said she said GES I
[26:57] tell her well you know she she's she's
[27:00] older an age she can't bear
[27:03] children and you know she has a husband
[27:06] and all of a sudden he tells her around
[27:09] this time next year you shall
[27:11] conceive and have a son now her directly
[27:17] response is like oh Lord he says don't
[27:20] don't lie to me she was she was almost
[27:22] too shocked to believe the promise that
[27:24] was given to
[27:26] her she was was too shock how can this
[27:29] happen to me you're telling me that
[27:31] after so much time you're going to be
[27:32] able to give me a son around this time
[27:35] next year you will have a son because
[27:37] the word had been
[27:39] spoken amen and she was able to pull she
[27:43] was able to hold down to this
[27:45] lifeline and because she believed the
[27:48] very promise had come to pass now think
[27:51] about this later down as she's as she's
[27:54] going through life I believe he's a
[27:56] young teenager now 11 12 years old the
[27:59] Bible says and and and he plays outside
[28:01] and he knocks his
[28:04] head and the mother pull she holds him
[28:07] on his
[28:09] lap the I believe the scripture says up
[28:12] until about the the hour of noon noon
[28:15] hour
[28:16] and he passes away now this whole time
[28:20] she's been serving the Prophet this
[28:22] whole time she knew that there was a man
[28:24] of God that was able to to come through
[28:28] her
[28:29] home that was able she was able to
[28:31] recognize the life of Jesus Christ the
[28:34] life of a prophet the life that was
[28:37] given to that Elisha amen and she was
[28:40] able to see that something was
[28:43] different and you know
[28:50] um she has a design on her heart she
[28:52] says I want to go see that Prophet I'd
[28:55] like to go see that Prophet I'd like to
[28:57] have that prophet do something for me I
[28:59] I the very blessing the very promise
[29:01] that he has given me I know that that
[29:05] same Prophet that was able to give me
[29:07] that promise of Life the same Prophet
[29:10] could do something for me where could
[29:11] bring me out of this
[29:13] condition and give me a restoration of
[29:17] Life there had to be a faith inside of
[29:20] her to know that when she was going to
[29:21] reach that word that something would be
[29:25] able to do something would be able to do
[29:27] for her that man couldn't
[29:31] do and so the prophet sends gesi and
[29:34] says oh get well get get my staff and
[29:36] put my staff upon his face she said no
[29:39] she wanted him to
[29:41] come and so here comes Elisha the
[29:43] prophet the scripture says that he he
[29:45] would go in the room and he shut the
[29:47] door he left them
[29:49] out actually the the kid the the the the
[29:52] young boy was sitting directly on the
[29:54] prophet's bed she placed them in that
[29:56] room
[29:59] and the prophet started praying he
[30:01] wanted to find out the will of God he
[30:02] wanted to find out of this he says the
[30:04] Lord hasn't shown me but I believe I'm
[30:06] going to pray so he's inside that room
[30:08] and he's
[30:10] praying and and and as he's praying he
[30:13] not only does he pray for him but he
[30:14] puts his he puts his whole body on top
[30:17] of his body he says the mouth was upon
[30:19] his mouth the nose was upon his nose his
[30:21] eyes were upon his eyes his hands he was
[30:23] covering the whole body the whole word
[30:26] was upon that that child
[30:29] every bit of that word was upon that
[30:32] child upon his mouth upon his nose upon
[30:35] his eyes upon his arms and he was
[30:38] covered with all of
[30:39] this and before you knew it God had
[30:42] restored
[30:44] life God had restored life in this dead
[30:48] boy why because he's a respector of the
[30:52] word amen
[30:56] amen could you imagine
[30:58] could you
[30:59] [Music]
[31:01] imagine
[31:03] how the shite was was rejoicing in that
[31:08] moment when she knew that the very same
[31:12] word I gave her the promise was the very
[31:14] same word that took her out of the
[31:15] condition she was in in that moment all
[31:18] she had to do is trust in the word all
[31:22] she had to do is trust in what God Said
[31:26] not try to figure it out not try to put
[31:28] one and one together not try to place
[31:31] this here I love how even Brother David
[31:33] has talked about the puzzle sometimes
[31:34] we'd like to take the puzzle from here
[31:36] and jam it in here because we think it
[31:38] creates a picture and before you know it
[31:41] it may create a picture but it's
[31:42] something that you can't
[31:44] see because it puts a veil over your
[31:46] face that you're able to just you're
[31:48] you're confused you're looking at a
[31:50] picture you're like oh what is that the
[31:52] foot shouldn't be there the uh why is
[31:55] the foot where the nose is and and why
[31:58] why is the tail where the eyes are it do
[32:00] make sense but when you trust the Holy
[32:04] Spirit and you have him put the ples in
[32:06] your life the right way by Revelation
[32:08] now you're able to see the foundation
[32:11] that Jesus Christ was built
[32:17] on the prophet would say this in trying
[32:21] to do God's a service with with it being
[32:23] without being at God's will I believe
[32:25] it's paragraph 60
[32:27] it says now but God has his word set and
[32:32] has in all ages he for knowledge has
[32:35] caused him to set in the church and in
[32:39] the people it says certain things that
[32:42] he did from the
[32:44] beginning and then the gospel that's
[32:46] being preached to that age is only
[32:49] revealed to that certain
[32:53] people the rest of them don't see it it
[32:57] says thank thee father thou Hast hid
[33:00] these things from the eyes of the wise
[33:02] and The
[33:03] Prudent and had revealed it to babes
[33:06] such as would learn it says that's
[33:09] predestination not that he did it by you
[33:13] say I'll choose you and I'll and I don't
[33:15] choose you it says by his forn knowledge
[33:19] he knowed what you would do and by him
[33:23] being infinite do you believe his
[33:26] infinite it says if he isn't he can't be
[33:30] God then you think being infinite he
[33:33] knew every flea that would ever be on
[33:36] the earth oh my a god of
[33:41] detail how many times them fleas will be
[33:45] their eyes how much tal was in each flea
[33:48] every blade of grass that he would be
[33:50] set on it says that's infinite we are
[33:54] finite we stumble in darkness God
[33:57] likened us unto sheep and we must have a
[34:02] leader and that leader is not man that
[34:06] leader is the Holy Ghost the spirit of
[34:09] Christ Among Us praise God it says a
[34:12] little while and the world seeth me no
[34:15] more his physical being was raised up
[34:18] through it says he his physical being
[34:20] was raised up to the throne of
[34:23] God where the spirit was on the throne
[34:28] now Christ is on the throne Jesus it
[34:32] says a little while and the world seeth
[34:34] me no more yet ye shall it says yet ye
[34:38] shall see me for I'll be with you to the
[34:42] end of the world even in
[34:45] you it says the Throne of God of Christ
[34:50] is erected in your
[34:54] heart the Throne of God
[34:58] of Christ is erected in your heart and
[35:03] the prophet would say that the nature of
[35:06] a
[35:08] soul is the nature of a
[35:11] man because that's where the seed grows
[35:14] that's where you know the character of
[35:15] God is in that soul and that nature of a
[35:17] soul and it says it says and he's
[35:20] sitting on God's throne but in the
[35:23] Millennium he sits on his own Throne
[35:26] which he swore that he'd raised up it
[35:28] says this man his son David's son to sit
[35:31] on his
[35:33] throne how it says now verse paragraph 6
[35:37] next paragraph it says now he reveals
[35:40] these things by his forn knowledge to
[35:43] those who he who he has
[35:45] ordained to these things otherwise they
[35:49] don't see it standing right here looking
[35:52] right at it he can't see it how many has
[35:55] ever seen that picture of a cow in the
[35:59] bush that you just have to look and look
[36:01] did you ever see that or seen the
[36:04] picture of Christ in the bush or in the
[36:06] sky or clouds
[36:09] Hallelujah seen the picture of Christ in
[36:11] the bush in the sky or in the clouds I
[36:14] believe we've seen that this day that
[36:16] painter has got that so fixed up till
[36:19] you have till you have to look at it a
[36:22] certain
[36:23] way it says well then when you once see
[36:27] it you can't see nothing else but that
[36:33] Hallelujah once you see the picture of
[36:35] Jesus Christ you no longer look in
[36:38] confusion and all of a sudden you see
[36:40] the image that was there from the
[36:44] beginning because God wanted to have
[36:46] sons and daughters of
[36:49] God but sin had entered in and perverted
[36:52] the Flesh and God now brought
[36:56] restoration and every time you look
[36:58] there it is it says well that's the way
[37:02] Christ is himself the gospel the message
[37:06] is when you once see the message of the
[37:09] hour there's nothing else you can see
[37:13] but that
[37:16] Hallelujah the message of the hour
[37:18] Saints is Jesus Christ the message of
[37:21] the Y is the restoration of that God had
[37:24] now coming down uniting the bride and
[37:26] himself do doing the same thing doing
[37:29] the same Works expressing the same
[37:33] nature it says that's all everything
[37:36] else is gone and the rest of it just a
[37:39] filter once you see the message
[37:42] Hallelujah so this message is not a
[37:45] Doctrine this message is not just a law
[37:48] this message is not just something that
[37:50] you can think you can just you can just
[37:52] float with something that you can just
[37:54] stag along whenever you want no this
[37:57] message is life and I want to tell you
[37:59] this morning that this message is the
[38:02] lifeline of Jesus Christ today because
[38:05] Jesus Christ had opened the seals and
[38:09] restored you back to the
[38:12] beginning don't sell yourself short
[38:15] Saints because this word came to
[38:18] identify you unto you I send the spirit
[38:22] of Elijah not to somebody
[38:24] else amen unto you because you are the
[38:28] elect of bride you are the predestinated
[38:31] for this hour and this message takes the
[38:33] veil of tradition off our face to see
[38:36] the foundation of Jesus Christ
[38:42] Hallelujah otherwise we might as well go
[38:45] back to being
[38:47] Pentecostals I'm
[38:49] sorry cuz at least they shout and they
[38:51] jump and they run around and they have
[38:53] fun
[38:58] but let me tell you something when this
[39:00] life is resurrected when this life now
[39:04] that Jesus Christ has restored Us in you
[39:07] it brings a pure
[39:09] worship and it creates the presence that
[39:11] we live under
[39:14] hallelujah it's not
[39:16] you it's the anointed word upon
[39:21] you so you got to water it so it
[39:26] grows you got to water it so it grows
[39:28] Let the Rain Fall upon you but know that
[39:33] it's not what we can
[39:36] do it's not what I can prove it's not
[39:39] what I can show but that the life of the
[39:43] word would now be lived in a vessel in a
[39:46] bride that was meant to express it
[39:49] genuinely yes sir because it's part of
[39:52] you you just got to have a discovery you
[39:55] got to figure out what this Foundation
[39:56] is you got to figure out what this what
[39:58] all of this talk is all
[40:00] about what are we talking about it is
[40:03] what it
[40:04] is it is what it is you just got to
[40:07] believe it it may be a paradox but you
[40:11] got to believe it and the prophet would
[40:14] say you know a lot of people in the days
[40:17] when the angel of the Lord came in the
[40:20] people in the time where the Death Angel
[40:23] The the death angel was passing by he
[40:25] said everybody had heard that the danger
[40:28] was passing and everybody everybody
[40:30] might have known the law but the the the
[40:34] issue was for some was the
[40:38] application they knew that the blood
[40:40] needed to be
[40:41] applied but not all of them applied it
[40:45] and so the prophet would say you can
[40:47] believe upon the word of God all you
[40:48] want you can say you believe the word
[40:51] you can tell me you believe the word and
[40:53] I believe you that you believe the word
[40:55] because you convinced me that you
[40:57] believe the word but unless you apply
[40:59] the word unless you apply the blood of
[41:01] Jesus Christ then when that Death Angel
[41:04] what's going to happen when you have the
[41:06] blood when you have the token when you
[41:09] have the revelation of Jesus Christ
[41:10] he'll pass over you and it doesn't
[41:13] matter about the condition it doesn't
[41:15] matter about the condition I want to
[41:18] tell you there's I mean could you
[41:19] imagine could you imagine uh you know
[41:23] the Bride of Jesus Christ being able to
[41:25] stand in the midst of God of of the of
[41:27] of the devil's Eden now think about this
[41:29] because she's white she's pure she's an
[41:32] adulterated she's the pure word of God
[41:34] and everything else around her is so
[41:36] dark and so and and so perverted that
[41:40] she's the very
[41:44] light that
[41:46] exposes the
[41:48] darkness unless you have light in the
[41:50] darkness you don't know there's
[41:53] Darkness walk into a dark room and try
[41:56] try to watch see something without
[41:59] light you be you you walk you I'll be
[42:02] walking in this piano or I'll be falling
[42:05] down the
[42:06] stairs but when there's light it
[42:09] identifies what the darkness is and that
[42:13] light is the life of
[42:20] men 1 John chapter 4 it says
[42:25] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[42:28] the spirits whether they are of God
[42:30] because many false prophets are gone out
[42:32] into the
[42:38] world hereby know
[42:42] ye this is something that's given to you
[42:44] that you already
[42:46] know all right think about this you
[42:49] already know it it's just a matter of
[42:51] discovering it or finding it inside of
[42:53] you so you can you can receive it it
[42:55] says hereby ye he says hereby know ye
[42:59] the spirit of God every spirit that
[43:02] confessed that Jesus Christ is come in
[43:04] the flesh is of
[43:09] God now I want to bring you present
[43:11] tense because because a prophet had come
[43:14] on the scene because a pillar of fire
[43:17] has been identified because a cloud has
[43:19] been shown
[43:22] now we know that
[43:25] whosoever every spirit that confessed
[43:28] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[43:30] is of
[43:32] God so the Bride of Jesus
[43:35] Christ is Jesus Christ in the flesh of
[43:40] God Jesus Christ in the flesh of God the
[43:43] Bride of Jesus Christ is the Flesh of
[43:45] Jesus Christ and the God Amen it says
[43:48] and every spirit that God every spirit
[43:50] that confess that not that Jesus Christ
[43:52] is come in the flesh is not of God and
[43:55] this is the spirit of antich Christ
[43:58] whereof you know ye have heard that it
[44:00] should come and even now is already into
[44:04] the
[44:05] world ye are of God little children and
[44:08] have overcome them because greater is he
[44:11] that is in you than he that is in the
[44:14] world so don't sell yourself
[44:18] short because all you have to do is grab
[44:20] a hold of that lifeline and once you
[44:22] grab a hold of that Lifeline Everything
[44:26] Changes your nature changes your desire
[44:29] changes your thinking changes your own
[44:32] selfishness changes you stop
[44:34] lying you don't have to worry about
[44:36] doing it on your own all you got to do
[44:38] is just grab a hold of it and you see it
[44:40] working because it's the very message of
[44:43] the hour that changes your condition
[44:46] from something perverted to something
[44:50] righteous it's to come and
[44:53] restore it's to come and restore faith
[44:57] in what faith in
[45:01] what just to say we're
[45:04] Christians just to say everybody in the
[45:07] world says they're Christians I've met
[45:09] people that that genuinely believe that
[45:11] they're Christians and they are
[45:12] Christians with the ability that they're
[45:13] able to serve God but I tell you this
[45:17] there's nothing else other than this
[45:19] message to provide such a sweet and holy
[45:22] life I love this message with all my
[45:25] heart I want to live it I want to eat it
[45:27] I want to breathe it I want to listen to
[45:29] it every hour that I can because in the
[45:31] spa in the time that we go through it's
[45:34] the very voice of
[45:37] Rescue It rescues you out of the
[45:40] condition you're in my condition may be
[45:42] different than your
[45:45] condition because life is life but just
[45:49] know that there's a storehouse that has
[45:51] been stored up for you so in whatever
[45:53] condition you're in God can bring it to
[45:56] pass in your life
[46:02] life praise
[46:04] God we should be thankful to have that
[46:09] Lifeline a Lifeline that creates or I
[46:14] can say that performs or proves
[46:19] Resurrection amen I've seen
[46:22] it and I believe it
[46:27] the prophet would say this and I have
[46:29] heard but now I see when the true
[46:32] genuine Vindication of the scripture of
[46:35] this last day message and you see the
[46:39] presence of Jesus Christ that you had
[46:42] heard what he done in his
[46:45] life and here the scripture say he's the
[46:49] same yesterday today and forever and
[46:52] just before the Sodom condition is fired
[46:55] over with the wrath of God see Jesus
[47:00] returned amongst his people formed in
[47:04] human flesh and do the same things he
[47:11] done it ought to strike our souls to
[47:14] Glory Hallelujah that's right it ought
[47:17] to do something for
[47:19] us why listen it's dropping on
[47:23] that it's dropping on the seed it's
[47:26] dropping on on the soul it says you
[47:29] heard in the Bible what he did when the
[47:32] woman touched His Garment he turned
[47:35] around and told her what her trouble was
[47:38] and her faith was made whole and he
[47:40] promised to do the same thing again just
[47:44] before the world would be burnt and the
[47:47] world would be in a Sodom
[47:52] condition now let me tell you this you
[47:55] know where Jesus Christ was walking when
[47:57] the woman with the blood issue was
[47:59] touching His Garment he was going on his
[48:03] way to Jar's daughter to perform a
[48:09] resurrection and because he was on a
[48:12] road walking to perform a resurrection
[48:15] that's right and and this I I this was
[48:18] amazing how I caught this but he the
[48:21] Bible says that Jar's daughter was 12
[48:24] years old and the woman had an issue in
[48:27] her body for 12
[48:32] years and because she heard a message of
[48:35] the hour was true because she heard
[48:38] something was different behind behind
[48:39] this man because she she because she
[48:42] heard she had to hear something
[48:44] something had to attract her to that
[48:45] word of
[48:46] God a word can be a word unless it's
[48:49] being unless it's being interpreted God
[48:51] and God interprets his word word how by
[48:54] bringing it to pass so he interprets his
[48:57] word by bringing it to to pass into who
[49:00] into
[49:01] you so Jesus Christ is walking walking
[49:04] on his way to her Resurrection because a
[49:06] servant had asked him to go pray for his
[49:09] daughter and this woman having a blood
[49:13] issue she wasn't cleansed imagine she
[49:15] spent all her
[49:17] wealth everything she had she spent it
[49:19] on this
[49:20] condition she probably went to the
[49:23] doctor she probably went to you know I'm
[49:25] sure back then they might have had you
[49:27] know other type of hospitals not the
[49:30] hospitals we have today but whatever
[49:32] Medics that they were able to to to do
[49:34] for her with plants and and you know oil
[49:37] natural stuff whatever if could she
[49:39] spent all her
[49:41] money to get away from this condition
[49:44] that she was
[49:45] in and nothing
[49:48] helped but she heard that there was a
[49:50] man that was walking through the streets
[49:51] of Galilee that was walking through the
[49:53] streets of Samaria that was he was
[49:56] hearing the testimony he says man
[49:57] there's this man around the block that
[49:59] all of a sudden just saved the woman
[50:01] there's this man that went to a wedding
[50:03] supper and all of a sudden he was asked
[50:05] to take the water and turn it into wine
[50:07] and all of a sudden this happened oh
[50:09] Hallelujah I got to get I got to I got
[50:11] to find out what I can do so I can go
[50:16] touch the
[50:19] lifeline it was her only hope it was all
[50:23] that she needed to do it's all this is
[50:25] the last resource
[50:27] I done everything that I can I've tried
[50:30] to live a Christian
[50:33] Life this many years as much as I can
[50:35] and something's still not
[50:38] working somehow I'm still
[50:40] battling somehow I still
[50:43] struggle sometimes I still make
[50:46] mistakes sometimes I get
[50:49] stubborn sometimes I catch myself lying
[50:51] when I shouldn't be lying because
[50:52] actually my lie sounds worse than my
[50:54] truth
[50:58] but I want to tell you this morning when
[51:01] you grab a hold of the lifeline

[55:03] shortly I
[55:06] amen it says well you say now wait a
[55:09] minute brother brandham you're talking
[55:12] about the Old
[55:13] Testament he's the same this is I
[55:16] believe paragraph 191 Christ is the
[55:17] mystery of God
[55:19] revealed he's the same yesterday today
[55:21] and forever listen I love
[55:24] this it's the full revelation of
[55:30] God if that strike you it's the full
[55:35] revelation of God if God ever says
[55:39] anything he can never change it he
[55:43] always magnifies it not change
[55:47] it the law was magnified not changed
[55:51] whosoever commits adultery shall be
[55:53] guilty of death but whosoever now now
[55:56] magnified look it upon the woman to lust
[56:00] after her after her it says he never
[56:02] changed the
[56:03] Commandment he magnified
[56:07] it
[56:08] amen remember the Sabbath day keep it
[56:11] holy one day in a week now he magnified
[56:15] it the rest comes from keeping the
[56:19] spirit of
[56:22] God precept upon precept line upon
[56:26] online here a little there a little hold
[56:29] fast to that what's good for with
[56:32] stammer and lips and with other tongues
[56:34] will I speak to this people and this is
[56:36] the rest that's the refreshing from the
[56:41] presence of the Lord hallelujah if you
[56:44] want to be refreshed in a
[56:46] presence be refreshed in the presence of
[56:48] the
[56:50] Lord because you know that's the
[56:52] lifegiver
[56:56] he's the only source of
[56:59] life and yet they would not hear it and
[57:02] waged their heads and walked away with
[57:04] their denominations this is the
[57:07] refreshening it says magnify the Sabbath
[57:10] day to you sabbatarians and so forth Oh
[57:13] my he don't change it he magnifies it it
[57:17] says paragraph 192 now you can see now
[57:20] the end time message why it's rejected
[57:27] do you see why the end time message is
[57:29] now
[57:31] rejected can you it says now no
[57:35] denomination but the revelation of his
[57:38] mystery no
[57:41] denomination the
[57:44] Revelation so it's not it's not
[57:46] something that I could come up with and
[57:48] and build around me from these works of
[57:50] man right like all of these things I
[57:52] could get myself busy and all of a
[57:54] sudden I've created a tradition around
[57:56] me I go to work I come home I do this I
[57:58] come back I do my grocery shopping here
[58:00] and here's my world and this is my world
[58:03] this is my world there's nothing else
[58:04] that goes outside my world the world
[58:07] that I live in is a world of
[58:10] appointments I'm I got to be here I got
[58:13] to be here and all of a sudden here's
[58:15] God speaking to us here's God revealing
[58:18] his word to us and we're built we're
[58:20] we're controlled by this world around
[58:24] me and I cannot hear or catch the
[58:28] revelation of this mystery as he's
[58:30] walking with me because remember God is
[58:32] an evolutionist he always he always
[58:34] unfolds himself as time passes his word
[58:37] becomes he's always Eternal so as the
[58:41] condition grows the Revelation
[58:44] grows as life unfolds Revelation
[58:48] lives because it's always the it's
[58:50] always the present tense word of God it
[58:53] says
[58:57] it says now you see the end time message
[59:00] why it's rejected can you it says no no
[59:02] denom no denomination but the revelation
[59:04] of his mystery it says God's not known
[59:07] by denomination he's known by revelation
[59:11] God in his body
[59:14] Christ and Christ in his body the bride
[59:19] it says God manifest in Christ Christ
[59:24] was it says Christ made man manest in
[59:26] the bride and as God took from the body
[59:30] of Adam the woman and she fell then God
[59:34] has took from the body of Christ his
[59:37] flesh his body which is his word and is
[59:42] bringing a bride out that won't fall by
[59:45] the denominational
[59:48] Creed it says no sir but she's coming
[59:52] back with the pure unadulterated word
[59:56] God being
[1:00:02] manifested so I want to tell you this
[1:00:04] what went into the
[1:00:06] ground at the day of Pentecost when
[1:00:08] Jesus Christ went to the burial he went
[1:00:10] to the Grave he he he overcome hell
[1:00:13] death and the grave and when he
[1:00:15] resurrected remember there was a time
[1:00:17] that he spent with his disciples upon
[1:00:19] the Earth and he was bones and flesh he
[1:00:22] ate with them and he was teaching them
[1:00:24] about the kingdom of God there was 40
[1:00:26] days and 40 nights that Jesus Christ
[1:00:28] lived in his resurrected form in that
[1:00:31] time and it was in that time that he
[1:00:33] gave them the promise to go stand in the
[1:00:35] upper room and receive that very same
[1:00:40] spirit that was the promise just like
[1:00:44] Abraham had noticed the angel melkisedek
[1:00:48] and you knew exactly what that image
[1:00:50] would be like he seen himself in that
[1:00:53] theophany he knew that over time by
[1:00:55] belie beling upon the word of God that
[1:00:57] he would come to the same
[1:01:01] image the pure unadulterated word being
[1:01:04] being manifested I hope every man that
[1:01:07] hears this tape and every woman will
[1:01:10] understand that see she's the second Eve
[1:01:14] but she's not breaking and spoiling her
[1:01:17] skirts of Purity and Hol Holiness to her
[1:01:23] husband amen I'm going to read that
[1:01:25] again but she's not breaking and
[1:01:27] spoiling her skirt and Purity and
[1:01:30] Holiness to her husband she'll stay with
[1:01:33] the word regardless of what anybody else
[1:01:35] says hallelujah it says you can have all
[1:01:39] your e ecumenical moves you want and all
[1:01:42] the affiliations and they're going to
[1:01:44] bring a persecution on pretty soon to
[1:01:47] shut up all the churches you see that
[1:01:49] and churches like this who's not
[1:01:52] denomination though use them for
[1:01:54] storehouses then and if any man goes and
[1:01:58] offer a prayer or for anybody else that
[1:02:01] don't belong to this ecumenical movement
[1:02:04] will be shot on the spot it says it's
[1:02:06] already the Lutheran the the Lutheran
[1:02:08] Minister the head of it said so it's
[1:02:11] right here you can read right in your
[1:02:13] magazines don't make any difference what
[1:02:16] they
[1:02:17] say the church will stand true in this
[1:02:21] light
[1:02:23] Hallelujah because she's been given a
[1:02:25] life
[1:02:26] Lifeline she's already proved it back
[1:02:30] Yonder and she'll do it again in the
[1:02:33] face of everything
[1:02:36] Hallelujah people are going to come to a
[1:02:39] day where they're not going to have
[1:02:41] faith and I'm not talking about people
[1:02:44] in your in our circle of of believing
[1:02:47] children but people around you could you
[1:02:50] imagine could you imagine how the
[1:02:52] minority now that's influencing all of
[1:02:55] the these other movements that goes
[1:02:57] around this world how they're
[1:02:58] controlling how things are coming to
[1:03:00] pass pass this law pass this law pass
[1:03:02] this law and really if you think about
[1:03:03] it it's only maybe like 1% of
[1:03:07] them but because they're
[1:03:10] influenced the people around
[1:03:13] them start walking into that and before
[1:03:16] you know it but I want to tell you this
[1:03:19] regardless of what anybody says
[1:03:21] regardless of what comes around she will
[1:03:24] stand true in this
[1:03:26] light she's already proved it back
[1:03:28] Yonder she's going to be there without
[1:03:30] spot or wrinkle at the end of that
[1:03:32] paragraph it says right she'll stand
[1:03:34] there it says notice God manifested
[1:03:38] himself in his body Christ do you see
[1:03:41] that three-fold beautiful thing it says
[1:03:43] Christ and his body the church
[1:03:45] vindicating his promised word like God
[1:03:49] did through
[1:03:50] Christ who can condemn me of sin if I do
[1:03:54] not the works of the father then then
[1:03:57] where have I failed now you Fells that
[1:03:59] say you are doing it you denominations
[1:04:01] you show me show me where I failed to be
[1:04:04] the Messiah show where I failed not one
[1:04:08] sign that God said the Messiah would do
[1:04:11] and I haven't fulfilled it he said see
[1:04:13] God and his body now that that that
[1:04:17] struck
[1:04:18] me could you imagine the testimony that
[1:04:22] we have to carry around of how our life
[1:04:26] should be such an
[1:04:28] example that people would be able to
[1:04:30] look upon you like man you don't you
[1:04:32] you're just
[1:04:34] different something's different about
[1:04:37] you you're no longer the same person
[1:04:40] I've
[1:04:40] known all of a sudden all of a sudden
[1:04:43] there's something inside of you that
[1:04:45] longs for that and you recognize that it
[1:04:48] was the hand of God that you you once
[1:04:50] used to get mad and all of a sudden God
[1:04:52] just changed that nature and brought the
[1:04:53] nature you're like oh well any everybody
[1:04:55] can say anything they want some it's
[1:04:57] like have you ever have you ever known
[1:04:59] somebody that's
[1:05:01] numb you can inject them with all that
[1:05:03] you want because he's numb and brother
[1:05:06] Ram says that once you get inoculated
[1:05:07] with the Holy Ghost nothing else can
[1:05:09] change you because now you've been
[1:05:11] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:05:13] what we have to do is try to grieve and
[1:05:14] not try to keep the seal so that way we
[1:05:18] can it could take us all the way to the
[1:05:19] destination it says now Christ The Works
[1:05:22] that I do you should do also see the
[1:05:24] works that I do you should do also Al
[1:05:26] more than this for I go unto the Father
[1:05:28] the church will be a little longer in
[1:05:30] life see vindicating his promised word
[1:05:34] as God did in his promises in Christ's
[1:05:38] body so is Christ doing the same Works
[1:05:42] in Christ body the
[1:05:45] church making his mystery known to his
[1:05:48] bride tree in the last day bringing
[1:05:52] forth the fruit that was in the tree at
[1:05:55] the
[1:05:57] beginning restoring us right back to the
[1:06:00] tree that was right back into the
[1:06:02] beginning because that was the tree of
[1:06:04] life that was the lifeline that God had
[1:06:07] placed so we could always be there and
[1:06:10] touch
[1:06:12] it as long as we moved away from that
[1:06:14] tree of life and went to the tree of
[1:06:15] knowledge of Good and Evil it created
[1:06:18] Darkness it brought you in deception it
[1:06:22] told you something that you shouldn't
[1:06:23] have been but all of a sudden here
[1:06:25] becomes the tree of life and identifies
[1:06:27] you it tells you your name it tells you
[1:06:29] your address it tells you who you are it
[1:06:32] tells you where you come from it tells
[1:06:33] you where you're going it tells you
[1:06:35] you've been elected it tells you you've
[1:06:37] never done that in the first place it
[1:06:38] tells you to do good it gives you life
[1:06:41] it gives you healing it gives you
[1:06:42] everything you have need
[1:06:44] of all you have to go is go eat all you
[1:06:48] have to do is go eat of the fruits and
[1:06:51] when you eat of the fruit you become the
[1:06:53] fruit because how can a good tree bring
[1:06:56] forth corrupt
[1:06:59] fruit when the seed goes into the ground
[1:07:01] it brings the same life right back out
[1:07:03] of the
[1:07:09] ground we're we're we're we're closing I
[1:07:12] I just like to read this paragraph in
[1:07:15] Fellowship 1956 listen to what the
[1:07:18] prophet
[1:07:20] says it says the greatest Miracle ever
[1:07:22] performed when God can take anything
[1:07:27] and convert
[1:07:28] it and bring it back to itself again
[1:07:33] just the same as you can take an animal
[1:07:35] by science and drop a little drop of
[1:07:38] water on top of a hog and make it a
[1:07:42] lamb now that's the miracle of it change
[1:07:47] his whole nature his appetites his
[1:07:50] attitudes
[1:07:51] everything that's what God does when he
[1:07:54] saves a man from
[1:07:57] sin he changes his entire
[1:08:01] makeup so greater Miracle than any part
[1:08:04] of Divine Healing that I've ever seen
[1:08:07] and I by the grace of God I've seen
[1:08:10] pretty near everything that could ever
[1:08:12] think of or hear of done by our Lord
[1:08:14] Jesus Christ even raising the dead after
[1:08:17] they're gone and still I think that
[1:08:20] salvation is the greatest miracle
[1:08:28] Hallelujah if you're looking for a
[1:08:31] miracle you're the
[1:08:34] miracle if you're looking for a miracle
[1:08:37] you can testify today to the devil that
[1:08:39] you are the miracle of God that has
[1:08:42] brought you in this place to manifest
[1:08:45] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:08:47] and
[1:08:48] forever you can get healed today and
[1:08:50] tomorrow you catch another
[1:08:52] sickness but when you know your
[1:08:54] salvation when you know who you are when
[1:08:57] you know that you're the greatest
[1:08:59] Miracle when you grab a hold of this
[1:09:01] Lifeline everything else dies and this
[1:09:07] lives the greatest Miracle oh Lord I can
[1:09:11] only imagine what the prophet had seen
[1:09:12] can you imagine what the prophet had
[1:09:14] seen and he has done and the greatest
[1:09:16] Miracle ever that has ever hit the
[1:09:18] planet Earth is how God Saves
[1:09:22] man people can't figure it out I want
[1:09:25] you to go type me a science project on
[1:09:27] how you become a Christian cuz I'm going
[1:09:28] to tell you right now it's just
[1:09:30] educational there's no way you can
[1:09:31] describe it it's a
[1:09:33] paradox it's a paradox how can you take
[1:09:36] a hog and put a drop of water upon him
[1:09:38] and in a moment of twinkling of an eye
[1:09:40] he becomes a lamb Hallelujah because it
[1:09:43] changes your nature a pig used to go eat
[1:09:46] all the nasty stuff in the world and all
[1:09:49] of a sudden here comes the water the
[1:09:51] rain it hits you and the Miracle of is
[1:09:53] that now you're a lamb and the
[1:09:56] prophecies just like it was in the
[1:09:57] beginning where the lamb and the dove
[1:09:59] can have
[1:10:08] Fellowship listen to what the prophet
[1:10:10] says I'm I'm closing soon I just have
[1:10:12] one
[1:10:13] more it says the invisible Union of the
[1:10:16] bride of Christ
[1:10:19] 1965 it says brother let's get all
[1:10:21] things ready for one of these days the
[1:10:23] fire is going to fall
[1:10:26] we're going up now let's get ready for
[1:10:28] the fire falling time we're in the last
[1:10:31] days we all know that we're ready for
[1:10:35] the coming of the Lord the thing is
[1:10:38] listen this is this this this is amazing
[1:10:41] the thing to do is to separate yourself
[1:10:44] from all
[1:10:48] sin separate yourself don't when you
[1:10:51] think about Sin don't think about the
[1:10:52] attributes of sin
[1:10:55] it's brother Braham clearly teaches that
[1:10:57] sin is
[1:10:59] unbelief so when you're an unbelief that
[1:11:01] means you're not in the word of God but
[1:11:03] when you're in the word of God and God
[1:11:05] blesses you with Revelation now you're
[1:11:06] walking into something else now you're
[1:11:08] out of sin separate yourself from
[1:11:10] anything that pertains to the world
[1:11:13] don't love the world or the things of
[1:11:15] the world it says let no man by his
[1:11:17] Creed deceive you you stay right
[1:11:20] straight in the promise of God the word
[1:11:23] of God and that word if it's a word for
[1:11:27] this day God vindicates his
[1:11:31] soul if he doesn't it's not the word for
[1:11:34] this day the word that fell on the day
[1:11:37] of Pentecost will not work for this day
[1:11:39] no sir that was for Pentecost this is
[1:11:43] for the bride the going home time of the
[1:11:46] Bride it says we got something different
[1:11:49] Saints we got something
[1:11:51] different this is something different
[1:11:54] this is not not just something that man
[1:11:56] teaches this is the life of Jesus Christ
[1:12:00] restored back to into into the bright
[1:12:03] form it says the Pentecostal represented
[1:12:05] that again we're in the bride age no
[1:12:08] more than the word of Noah would have
[1:12:11] worked in the days of Moses no more than
[1:12:14] Moses's law would have worked in the
[1:12:16] time of Paul here where he tried to tell
[1:12:19] them you are dead to that you you cannot
[1:12:22] have that church you who I'm speaking to
[1:12:26] it says tonight Across the Nation if
[1:12:28] you've separated yourself from
[1:12:31] denomination and all the filth and
[1:12:34] things of this world and all those
[1:12:37] things that keep you in a man-made Creed
[1:12:40] and orders and things like that you
[1:12:43] separated yourself look up get ready the
[1:12:47] fire is going to fall one of these days
[1:12:50] God is going to let him
[1:12:53] come God is going to let him come and a
[1:12:58] sight to behold would you be ready when
[1:13:01] he comes would you be ready to go up
[1:13:04] with him when the when he comes it says
[1:13:07] the secret Rapture of the supernatural
[1:13:12] bride man can't figure this
[1:13:16] out it's a secret
[1:13:19] Rapture of the supernatural bride and
[1:13:21] she's the only one that knows it she'll
[1:13:24] be made from Mortal to immortality
[1:13:27] should be changed in a moment in a
[1:13:29] twinkling of an eye and it says we which
[1:13:32] are alive and remain shall not prevent
[1:13:34] or the prophet would take that and say
[1:13:36] or
[1:13:38] hinder them which are
[1:13:41] asleep but a real this is modern EV
[1:13:44] modern events made clear by prophecy but
[1:13:46] the real ordain of God paragraph 63 it
[1:13:50] says the real ordain of God if the
[1:13:53] musicians can come
[1:13:56] the real
[1:13:57] Gene it says but the real ordain of God
[1:14:00] the real Gene you know I was looking at
[1:14:02] I was looking at this word as Gene
[1:14:04] what's Gene you know the word
[1:14:07] regeneration has Gene inside of it so
[1:14:10] when you're regenerated you regenerated
[1:14:12] back to a gene that was already in the
[1:14:14] beginning you the real Gene that real
[1:14:18] germ a soul of God a soul listen a soul
[1:14:22] of God that was in God before the found
[1:14:25] of the world remember you that's really
[1:14:28] got the spirit of God in you tonight you
[1:14:31] were with Christ because he was the
[1:14:34] fullness of the
[1:14:36] word he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:14:39] bodily God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:14:43] world to himself do you believe that
[1:14:46] look he was in Christ then if you were
[1:14:49] in God a gene a word an attribute from
[1:14:54] the beginning then you walked with him
[1:14:58] here on the earth you talked with him on
[1:15:01] the
[1:15:02] earth you suffered with him on the
[1:15:07] earth could you imagine he suffered so
[1:15:10] you know what it's like to suffer with
[1:15:13] him that's the promised
[1:15:16] word don't be sad that he's going to
[1:15:19] leave but he'll come again and he'll be
[1:15:20] your comforter he'll be your leader
[1:15:22] he'll carry you through those times and
[1:15:25] says you died with him at Calvary and
[1:15:28] you Rose with him
[1:15:30] again
[1:15:31] hallelujah it's already a done work
[1:15:34] that's right Hallelujah because there
[1:15:37] was a word that identified you and you
[1:15:39] Rose with him again and now you're
[1:15:41] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:15:44] Jesus communing with him the word as he
[1:15:49] feeds into your soul it says that man
[1:15:52] shall live by every wor that proceedeth
[1:15:56] now that's the only way that a man can
[1:15:59] live is if he feeds on the very Mana of
[1:16:02] the message of the hour of the actual
[1:16:04] word of the hour revealed inside of you
[1:16:07] so you can receive the life of Jesus
[1:16:11] Christ I'm closing if they can play
[1:16:14] something
[1:16:16] softly I was shocked by I've heard this
[1:16:19] story
[1:16:23] before but when I heard it this time it
[1:16:26] did something to
[1:16:28] me if you remember Hurricane Mountain
[1:16:31] the
[1:16:32] prophet if you remember the
[1:16:35] story he's on his
[1:16:38] honeymoon he went up to take Ma and his
[1:16:42] son I believe Billy were up there and he
[1:16:46] had a friend he he gave him the cabin
[1:16:50] for a few days so he can spend a few
[1:16:52] days there before his friend was going
[1:16:53] to come up and they were going to try to
[1:16:55] hunt together and and just have some
[1:16:58] time and the prophet wanted to go
[1:17:00] hunt and he left his wife and he left
[1:17:05] his his um his son up there he came to
[1:17:10] huntting and you know he he was I
[1:17:12] believe close to Canada I don't remember
[1:17:14] the exact
[1:17:17] location and he went to go hunting and
[1:17:20] he catches a
[1:17:22] deer he HS the deer on the tree
[1:17:25] now you know the prophet's been in the
[1:17:27] woods a long time he lived in the woods
[1:17:31] he knew all the he knew he that was his
[1:17:34] life that's exactly where he was finding
[1:17:36] his peace is it was it was a way of
[1:17:38] rescue for him it was a way where he
[1:17:40] would go out and spend could you I mean
[1:17:42] I could only imagine the life the
[1:17:43] prophet's life and all of the things
[1:17:46] that he was pulled towards and all of
[1:17:47] the serving that this Prophet had ever
[1:17:49] done I don't know I I I you know
[1:17:52] I I love this message and I know the
[1:17:55] life that was given for this message was
[1:17:57] a hard life that the prophet had went
[1:17:59] through but he did it because he loved
[1:18:01] the bride he live he did it because
[1:18:03] there was some somebody here this
[1:18:05] morning that would touch the hymn that
[1:18:08] would touch that word
[1:18:09] line and the prophet he he knew he knew
[1:18:14] the woods he was
[1:18:17] confident and he he notices that there's
[1:18:20] there's a storm
[1:18:22] coming he notices that there's uh
[1:18:25] there's some clouds coming this is
[1:18:27] midday I believe 2 3 o' in the
[1:18:29] afternoon and it says I'm going to start
[1:18:31] getting
[1:18:33] back I I've seen these storms before
[1:18:36] I've I've went through these things
[1:18:38] before he says I I I could I can stay it
[1:18:41] out I can I can camp it out you know I I
[1:18:43] can I can put my tent and I can try to
[1:18:45] Camp it out for a few days but it says I
[1:18:47] can't do that because I know that
[1:18:48] there's somebody else waitting I mean M
[1:18:50] has never been in the woods she doesn't
[1:18:52] even know what it's like
[1:18:53] to make a fire she doesn't even know
[1:18:57] what you know this is probably I I
[1:18:58] believe maybe her first time I
[1:19:03] um and uh within timing the prophet
[1:19:07] starts moving towards home or what he
[1:19:10] would call home at that time he was
[1:19:12] wanting to go up to the upper
[1:19:15] cabin and so he goes through
[1:19:20] and all of a sudden he's walking now his
[1:19:23] time piece was you know where he hung
[1:19:25] the deer because he he would be able to
[1:19:28] sell he would be able to smell the blood
[1:19:30] he would be able to see the
[1:19:31] scene and
[1:19:33] so he goes through he comes around he's
[1:19:36] like man I I made a wrong turn here it
[1:19:39] is
[1:19:40] again and
[1:19:43] uh he says okay maybe if it's not this
[1:19:45] way now could you imagine not being able
[1:19:47] to know where you're going he was
[1:19:48] looking for something
[1:19:50] specific he knew where he was at he was
[1:19:54] trying to get to something that was
[1:19:55] there that he can grab a hold
[1:19:57] of because he knew that one day he
[1:20:00] worked with his buddy and he had brought
[1:20:03] some sort of telephone
[1:20:07] line he knew where he was wanting to
[1:20:10] go the problem is is trying to get
[1:20:15] there and
[1:20:16] so he was walking and he was walking and
[1:20:19] he comes right back to the same
[1:20:23] spot and he does it again again and it's
[1:20:25] getting
[1:20:26] darker
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:34] now I could only imagine could you
[1:20:37] imagine thinking that you might know the
[1:20:39] way and here you are traveling and
[1:20:41] you're coming right back to the same
[1:20:43] spot actually the prophet would say that
[1:20:46] a a an Indian would call that the the
[1:20:49] the death
[1:20:50] walk you know an Indian would call
[1:20:52] because you're you're thinking you're
[1:20:53] going the right way but it's bringing
[1:20:55] you right back to where you came from
[1:20:56] it's bringing you right back to where
[1:20:57] you came from it's bringing you right
[1:20:58] back it's like man you you never find
[1:21:00] your
[1:21:01] way and so the prophet breaks down and
[1:21:03] he says Lord I'm
[1:21:05] lost I'm lost I might have thought I've
[1:21:08] known the
[1:21:09] way even though I know the woods even
[1:21:11] though I've experienced the woods and
[1:21:13] I've been through the woods and I've
[1:21:14] seen hunting and I've and I've I've done
[1:21:17] all these things Lord I'm lost I need
[1:21:20] your help in this moment I can't wait I
[1:21:24] can't cannot make my way back to where
[1:21:26] that was I couldn't I've
[1:21:30] tried I've tried I've went around I've
[1:21:34] went around and I'm coming right back
[1:21:35] I'm lost he says Lord help me he gets up
[1:21:40] and he says there was it says just along
[1:21:43] there I heard something say I am the
[1:21:46] Lord a very present help in a time of
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:51] trouble he said I am the Lord a very
[1:21:54] present help in the time of trouble and
[1:21:57] it said that three or four
[1:22:01] times how important it is to move the
[1:22:03] world around me
[1:22:05] out and to be able to hear his voice and
[1:22:09] cling to that word that would be able to
[1:22:11] take me out of that trouble and after a
[1:22:14] while I stopped and I thought either I'm
[1:22:16] beside myself or almighty God has got
[1:22:18] mercy upon me and I knelled down and set
[1:22:22] my gun and I said God I confessed I'm
[1:22:24] lost it says I I he says I said I'm
[1:22:26] completely turned around that's no way
[1:22:29] said I've done got excited you see
[1:22:31] there's no way for me at all to ever
[1:22:33] find my way out I don't deserve to
[1:22:37] live but my wife and baby does so help
[1:22:41] me to get to
[1:22:43] them so that they won't die in the woods
[1:22:47] I said I don't deserve to live but they
[1:22:51] do oh
[1:22:53] Hallelujah could you imagine that same
[1:22:55] action in Jesus Christ I don't desire to
[1:22:58] live but they
[1:23:01] do Lord let let me be perfect so they
[1:23:04] can be perfect like me I sacrificed my
[1:23:07] life I sold my life away so they can
[1:23:10] have a life more
[1:23:12] abundantly and I said if you'll just
[1:23:15] help me I'll be very thankful to
[1:23:18] you oh what an
[1:23:23] attitude he gets
[1:23:25] up and I started like this and at once I
[1:23:28] felt something go a hand I thought who
[1:23:30] is that and I looked up and just in time
[1:23:34] I looked back and enough fog cleared
[1:23:36] away till I seen the top of Hurricane
[1:23:39] Mountain and they were camped just below
[1:23:43] Hurricane
[1:23:44] Mountain
[1:23:46] so the prophet was able to receive Grace
[1:23:49] where now he was able to see the
[1:23:51] direction that he was supposed to go
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:23:57] the sun had moved the clouds
[1:24:00] away the sun had moved the storm away
[1:24:04] and all it took is One Moment In the son
[1:24:07] in the presence of the son so she or he
[1:24:10] can see the direction where he needs to
[1:24:11] go because he was going the wrong way
[1:24:13] the whole time and he thought he was
[1:24:16] going the right way but all of a sudden
[1:24:18] God shined his very light upon the
[1:24:21] situation and his very word gave him
[1:24:24] access to know where he's
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:29] going and it says brother along and done
[1:24:32] pitch black here here he is now he's
[1:24:34] seen where he's
[1:24:35] going and it says along and done pitch
[1:24:38] black dark you know and I've been
[1:24:40] walking about an hour in the darkness in
[1:24:42] my hand and my hand to hit that wire I
[1:24:45] felt it and I bowed my head and started
[1:24:48] crying and you know I thought Lord right
[1:24:52] at the end of this line wa my wife and
[1:24:55] everything see I thought that's right
[1:24:58] and I stood there and held my head on
[1:25:00] down and thank him for it I thought yes
[1:25:03] Lord I got my hand in yours it is it
[1:25:09] it's a current line right there right at
[1:25:12] the end of this line I'm holding now in
[1:25:15] my heart hold it says right at the end
[1:25:19] of the line that I'm holding now in my
[1:25:22] heart holds everything that is dear to
[1:25:24] me see all my loved ones it says my Lord
[1:25:28] my savior all that's dear to me lays at
[1:25:31] the end of this line so the prophet's
[1:25:34] walking if we can just stand the
[1:25:36] prophet's walking and all of a sudden he
[1:25:39] hits this line This is the line that he
[1:25:43] knows that would take him to the top of
[1:25:45] the cabin where his wife and his child
[1:25:47] was and the prophet would say he says as
[1:25:51] soon as I got a hold of that line I was
[1:25:53] not going to let go I was holding my gun
[1:25:55] in one arm and I was holding this power
[1:25:57] line or this telephone line in my other
[1:25:59] hand and as soon as this hand would get
[1:26:01] so tired and weary I would change and I
[1:26:02] would grab it with this hand and hold my
[1:26:04] gun with this other one but I was not
[1:26:06] going to let go of this line because I
[1:26:08] knew at the end of it I would know that
[1:26:11] that's my destination where I got to go
[1:26:14] if a tree was to come around that would
[1:26:16] go right around the
[1:26:17] tree if a fence was to come around I
[1:26:20] would go right around the fence but I
[1:26:21] would not let go of that line that's
[1:26:23] right
[1:26:26] I want to tell you this
[1:26:27] morning the message of the hour the
[1:26:30] revelation of Jesus Christ is God's
[1:26:36] Lifeline all you have to do is grab a
[1:26:39] hold of it and once you grab a hold of
[1:26:42] it don't let ever go because it'll be
[1:26:46] the very life that will keep you it'll
[1:26:49] be the very life that will mold you
[1:26:51] it'll be the very life that will
[1:26:52] transform you it'll be the very life
[1:26:54] that was given for this hour to manifest
[1:26:56] who you are
[1:26:58] hallelujah amen I want to tell you this
[1:27:01] morning that this message is not a Creed
[1:27:03] it's not a Doctrine don't let it just be
[1:27:06] comfortable to you let it be the very
[1:27:08] life that feeds your
[1:27:10] soul because it's the character of Jesus
[1:27:13] Christ and sometimes humankind is
[1:27:17] stubborn human humankind always sting
[1:27:21] and knows its way just like Cain did in
[1:27:23] the beginning
[1:27:26] but there's a separation between the
[1:27:28] wheat and the
[1:27:29] Shu the very life that was in the
[1:27:32] beginning is the very life that has to
[1:27:35] be in
[1:27:36] now amen and sometimes the stubbornness
[1:27:40] of man could could stop a son or a
[1:27:43] daughter of God to grab a hold of that
[1:27:46] line to be able to just hold on to it
[1:27:49] know that once you touch it you will
[1:27:52] never be the same
[1:27:55] and and the same word that gave you that
[1:27:57] revelation of who you are is the same
[1:28:00] word that would change your body into
[1:28:03] this from this Mortal body to Immortal
[1:28:05] body all you have to do is hold on to it
[1:28:09] because it is what it is if you hold on
[1:28:12] to it when you get there you'll find
[1:28:14] out and I want to tell you this I want
[1:28:17] to be there the prophet says if if any
[1:28:22] man
[1:28:24] would be able to stand and say I'm the
[1:28:25] only one that would get into the kingdom
[1:28:27] of God I want to be the only man that
[1:28:29] would get into the kingdom of God
[1:28:30] because I want to be pleasing to him I
[1:28:33] want to be the very character that he's
[1:28:35] built in this age that we should reflect
[1:28:38] the life of Jesus Christ let's bow our
[1:28:42] heads precious
[1:28:45] Lord we truly know from your word just
[1:28:49] like we've heard it today all day you
[1:28:52] are not a respector of a person but
[1:28:54] you're a respector of your
[1:28:56] word and before the foundation of the
[1:28:58] world you have sent a
[1:29:02] word that knew our condition that knew
[1:29:06] our need that knew who we are that knew
[1:29:09] the very troubles and the headaches that
[1:29:11] we would be going
[1:29:14] through and so Lord what a privilege it
[1:29:17] this to get a hold of this
[1:29:20] line and Lord I pray this morning that
[1:29:23] if there's a soul that maybe has not got
[1:29:27] to hold this
[1:29:29] lifeline and maybe they've been
[1:29:30] traveling into the Trap of what the
[1:29:33] prophet would call the death walk I pray
[1:29:36] this morning in the precious name of the
[1:29:37] Lord Jesus Christ that they would get a
[1:29:39] hold of that
[1:29:41] Lifeline because that Lifeline is the
[1:29:43] very image of what you were in the
[1:29:46] beginning Lord you change a sinner from
[1:29:49] a sinner to a saint you change a lame
[1:29:52] man to a man that's healed Lord you
[1:29:54] change a man that once was dead now
[1:29:56] where he can have life Lord I pray this
[1:30:00] morning Lord that you would be able to
[1:30:02] dwell inside of us Lord that I would be
[1:30:05] able to Die daily Lord that I wouldn't
[1:30:08] be living for myself but that Christ
[1:30:10] would be the very life that would live
[1:30:12] inside of me Lord
[1:30:14] providing light in this Darkness being
[1:30:17] able to know Lord that just a moment in
[1:30:20] the presence of the son
[1:30:22] Hallelujah could make all things work
[1:30:26] together for good for those that love
[1:30:29] the
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:32] Lord Lord I I pray from the bottom of my
[1:30:37] heart this morning Lord that you would
[1:30:39] bless every single one of the Believers
[1:30:41] in this
[1:30:43] place Lord that the love of God would be
[1:30:46] upon
[1:30:47] them that you would carry in them Lord
[1:30:50] to through all their troubles through
[1:30:52] all their needs that they would know
[1:30:54] that they have you there lord always as
[1:30:56] a rescue regardless if life is good
[1:31:00] regardless if we're on the top of the
[1:31:02] mountain or maybe in the low valley or
[1:31:04] maybe we're climbing or we're descending
[1:31:06] whatever it may be Lord may we always
[1:31:09] know that you've plac that predestinated
[1:31:11] word that would we could always hold on
[1:31:13] to and it'll be the very present time
[1:31:15] for very present help in the time that
[1:31:17] we have need of Lord that you can lead
[1:31:19] us and give us what we have need of Lord
[1:31:22] It's not what man can do but it's what
[1:31:24] you can do for your bride lord it's how
[1:31:27] you dress her it's how you mold her it's
[1:31:29] how you perfect her Lord Lord and we
[1:31:31] want to be that bride that you've seen
[1:31:33] in that Vision Lord we want to be
[1:31:35] spotless without spot without wrinkle
[1:31:37] marching Lord into that presence of the
[1:31:39] king marching Lord and obeying your
[1:31:42] Commandments knowing Lord that we can be
[1:31:44] disciplined to the word of God and let
[1:31:47] the life of Jesus Christ could dwell
[1:31:49] inside of us Lord if I'm lacking
[1:31:52] anything I pray that you would give me
[1:31:53] Lord Lord Lord even for myself may you
[1:31:57] take away my stubbornness may you take
[1:31:59] away all that I'm dealing with Lord
[1:32:02] maybe my attitude and my actions and
[1:32:04] Lord my thoughts and my thinking maybe
[1:32:06] I'm treating people wrong or whatever
[1:32:09] I'm doing Lord Jesus may you change my
[1:32:11] character may you mold me Lord and may I
[1:32:14] be able to turn the other cheek more
[1:32:16] Lord and Lord and if anybody's asking
[1:32:19] for my shirt that I'll be able to give
[1:32:20] them my quote also Lord because God is
[1:32:23] love
[1:32:25] and you've always showed your token as
[1:32:28] part of Grace and you've always give us
[1:32:31] Lord your blood that would be able to
[1:32:33] keep us clean it' be it was always the
[1:32:36] precious way that you chose for us to go
[1:32:38] by is by that blood is by that token to
[1:32:41] be sealed into the into that
[1:32:44] promise to be circumcised around our
[1:32:47] hearts and to serve you with all that we
[1:32:49] have within us to move away from
[1:32:52] unbelief to move away away from the
[1:32:54] things of this world to move away from
[1:32:56] anything that would Lord disturb us or
[1:32:59] deceive us into the things of this world
[1:33:01] we've even noticed how the devil could
[1:33:03] be so subtle he would want us to get us
[1:33:06] into a tradition not to think that you
[1:33:07] don't exist but that we would just fall
[1:33:09] into a comfort and that we would just be
[1:33:11] carried away but Lord you've left a
[1:33:14] Lifeline for us to grab a hold of that
[1:33:16] would carry us all the way home that
[1:33:18] would be able to give us a changing in
[1:33:20] our body because you are the same
[1:33:22] yesterday today and forever so we just
[1:33:25] thank you this morning for your word we
[1:33:27] thank you Lord for your life we thank
[1:33:28] you for your truth we thank you for
[1:33:30] being inside of our life we just ask now
[1:33:34] that you bless the remaining of our day
[1:33:36] that you bless even this evening service

[1:33:39] portion tonight Lord and I pray that
[1:33:41] even Lord the love from Brother David
[1:33:44] and sister Leslie for the dinner tonight

[1:37:29] shining through
[1:37:31] me amen God bless you this morning you
[1:37:35] may be
[1:37:40] seated this morning brings uh back lots
[1:37:46] of
[1:37:47] memories for
[1:37:49] me um I don't know if many of you
[1:37:52] understand Cosman story but of course
[1:37:56] cosman's background he's from Romania
[1:37:59] he's a Romanian he speaks the language
[1:38:04] and he was going there my my brother
[1:38:08] spent years in Romania uh writing the
[1:38:11] gospel there and Kum was there uh
[1:38:17] preaching and going throughout the
[1:38:19] country and he got in the southern part
[1:38:22] of Romania and came across a group of
[1:38:26] people and and uh that were doing all
[1:38:31] they could to serve the Lord and so you
[1:38:35] know a lot of voices in the land and
[1:38:38] things and the Lord spoke to cosman's
[1:38:42] heart and concerning that group of
[1:38:46] people that he should go there and
[1:38:49] Pastor that group and become the pastor
[1:38:53] of of that church
[1:38:55] and and I know that
[1:38:57] feeling and I know
[1:39:00] that heart when your heart
[1:39:03] attaches to a people or and to a
[1:39:08] place and it happened to me 46 years
[1:39:13] ago and I look at little Gideon and I
[1:39:17] think about Matthew Matthew was just a
[1:39:20] few months old and uh we came
[1:39:24] here and when you come to a place and
[1:39:28] your heart's there your life's there you
[1:39:30] don't know what it is it's an unseen
[1:39:34] connection
[1:39:36] that has got you and you think you have
[1:39:41] a in your mind what it's going to be you
[1:39:44] think that you have an understanding but
[1:39:47] really you're walking into the unknown
[1:39:50] you don't know what's there you don't
[1:39:53] know what it's going to
[1:39:55] become you don't know what you have from
[1:39:59] day to day because there's no
[1:40:02] certainty
[1:40:04] there's you you'll have somebody with
[1:40:06] you today and they'll be gone tomorrow
[1:40:09] you know you have somebody you think
[1:40:11] loves you and the next day they're
[1:40:14] stabbing you in the
[1:40:15] bag I would think I was 27 years old or
[1:40:19] when I came here and
[1:40:25] um you know I can honestly say I came to
[1:40:29] be a pastor but I
[1:40:32] wasn't in fact I don't even
[1:40:34] know what I was doing but one
[1:40:38] knew and and you mold and you your
[1:40:41] people mold you and you become a part of
[1:40:45] them you become part of the land you
[1:40:47] become part of the area and God molds
[1:40:50] your spirit for where you are and he
[1:40:57] puts the words in your heart for what
[1:41:00] the need is there and so when the Lord
[1:41:03] speaks to you you know it's not a
[1:41:05] passing thing it's a lifelong commitment
[1:41:08] who believe I'd be here
[1:41:11] 40 six
[1:41:13] years and uh I I tried to
[1:41:18] leave I tried to retire I tried to go
[1:41:21] away I had plans to move to another
[1:41:25] place but your heart becomes there and
[1:41:30] and a lot of people you can't understand
[1:41:33] it you know what I mean but uh Cosman
[1:41:37] feels this way towards these
[1:41:40] people and that and I that's how I felt
[1:41:45] and and God makes it work you don't make
[1:41:49] it work you got it all figured out but
[1:41:52] it's never the way you figure it out and
[1:41:55] uh so you know it's a life Journey he's
[1:41:59] making a life
[1:42:01] commitment and that's what a Shepherd
[1:42:03] does he's not a hirling you know he
[1:42:06] doesn't go while things are good he
[1:42:08] doesn't go there uh lesie and I can
[1:42:13] remember we started with a group and
[1:42:16] finally one service we came to service
[1:42:20] and uh there was my family and and
[1:42:25] sister Lenny Greenley and that's all
[1:42:28] that was there and it looked like oh my
[1:42:33] I came here and it was a
[1:42:34] failure but you know what if it's of God
[1:42:39] it'll
[1:42:41] last and it'll produce fruit as long as
[1:42:44] you stay with our brother said it'll
[1:42:47] it'll produce fruit and so he's going
[1:42:50] because he feels something in his life
[1:42:53] to go and people around didn't
[1:42:56] understand it they all looked at me and
[1:43:00] you know everybody sees you better than
[1:43:02] you see
[1:43:03] yourself you know what I mean they knew
[1:43:06] I was rough and you know and sharp and
[1:43:11] kind of rough around the edges real
[1:43:14] opinionated real
[1:43:17] judgmental and uh they would just look
[1:43:19] at me and say there ain't no way
[1:43:23] anybody's ever going to stick around
[1:43:26] this guy well you know God's got
[1:43:30] sandpaper and God's got a hammer and God
[1:43:34] knows how to mold you but the thing that
[1:43:37] I think was down inside the most is that
[1:43:40] I love God's
[1:43:41] people and you want the best for them so
[1:43:44] you have to understand this morning
[1:43:46] that's how cosmon
[1:43:48] feels he wants to serve God he wants to
[1:43:52] serve of people and whether it it
[1:43:56] remains 20 or 30 or it grows to 500
[1:44:00] that's not the point of it that's not
[1:44:03] what proves it right or what proves it
[1:44:06] wrong what proves it right and wrong is
[1:44:08] what's in your
[1:44:11] heart and when you have that you know
[1:44:15] it's like a vow it's for better for
[1:44:18] worse for rich or for poor you know tell
[1:44:23] death does far and if you walk this
[1:44:27] right you have the richers and you have
[1:44:29] the poorest and you have the good times
[1:44:31] and you have the sickness and you have
[1:44:34] the hell so as cosmus decided and felt
[1:44:38] that he said God thus sayeth the Lord to
[1:44:41] go to this place let's don't try to
[1:44:45] figure it out you know let's don't try
[1:44:48] to say oh I don't think it's of the Lord
[1:44:51] I don't think it's this or I don't think
[1:44:53] I think it's that just remember here's a
[1:44:55] guy that's fixing to give his
[1:44:57] life leave everything he
[1:45:00] knows and take his children because when
[1:45:03] I came here I took my
[1:45:05] children with me you know what I mean
[1:45:08] they they left what they knew and his
[1:45:12] children are doing the same but the
[1:45:14] sacrifice isn't for this life it's for
[1:45:18] the life
[1:45:19] after and and this message isn't staying
[1:45:23] message it's a leaving message so if he
[1:45:27] can go there and help one person it's
[1:45:30] worth 10,000
[1:45:32] worlds and and so uh we we we want to be
[1:45:37] for him and he'll learn a
[1:45:41] lot
[1:45:43] he'll change a
[1:45:45] lot and I could sit right here and tell
[1:45:48] him the many things that's going to
[1:45:51] happen and the many things he's going to
[1:45:55] go through but he's got to go through it
[1:45:59] himself because he's done something in
[1:46:02] his heart and he wants to live true to
[1:46:04] that heart and if you can't live true to
[1:46:07] your heart you can't live true to God
[1:46:10] am and so uh every people got different
[1:46:15] callings so you might sit here this this
[1:46:17] morning say I don't think P that Cosman
[1:46:21] got the gift of Pastor
[1:46:23] I don't think cosman's smart enough to
[1:46:27] Pastor well let me tell you he's a lot
[1:46:28] better shaped spiritually and mentally
[1:46:31] than when I
[1:46:33] came you know he has a whole lot more of
[1:46:35] the word of God that's been revealed
[1:46:38] them when I came here so it's not about
[1:46:41] the man it's about what God wants to do
[1:46:45] that's right with the man and if God
[1:46:47] wants to do something with somebody God
[1:46:49] will do it and if if you let God do it
[1:46:53] he'll make it
[1:46:55] successful and it'll be beneficial and
[1:46:57] if that last soul is there and Southern
[1:47:01] Romania to get me out of here even so
[1:47:05] come quickly Lord Jesus so we like at
[1:47:09] this time if uh brother Cosmo if you
[1:47:12] bring your family
[1:47:14] and if any of the brothers
[1:47:18] or preachers and ministers and Elders of
[1:47:21] the church would like to come and
[1:47:24] we're just going to pray for his family
[1:47:25] and you can all come up around us
[1:47:28] and we'll lay hands on our brother and
[1:47:31] and ask them and the kids you know it's
[1:47:35] it's it's it's going to be hard for them
[1:47:38] to
[1:47:39] adjust you know and no doubt if the Lord
[1:47:43] carries they'll find their their their
[1:47:47] husbands and and raise their families in
[1:47:52] that part of the world world so this is
[1:47:54] a great
[1:48:03] morning I think of my little kids and I
[1:48:06] think of sister
[1:48:08] lesie holding little
[1:48:11] Matthew now look at Matthew you know and
[1:48:14] that's he was not this was how big he
[1:48:17] was but we're here to serve him we're
[1:48:21] here to go on the journey that he takes
[1:48:23] us
[1:48:25] on he we're here to
[1:48:27] follow his leadership no matter where it
[1:48:31] brings us and that's the
[1:48:34] commitment that we made when he saved me
[1:48:38] I'll say Lord I'll go where you want to
[1:48:41] go I'll serve you with all my
[1:48:44] heart and I'll do what you would have me
[1:48:48] to do and so our brothers made this
[1:48:52] commitment
[1:48:53] so we want to stand with him in his
[1:48:56] commitment in
[1:48:57] prayer and
[1:49:00] confidence and in support we want to
[1:49:03] keep them on our hearts so as we're
[1:49:06] going to ask God to bless his
[1:49:08] family and and to bless them as they
[1:49:11] move to
[1:49:12] Romania and for cosin
[1:49:15] to us start pastoring a church we just
[1:49:20] trust that the real pastor of that
[1:49:22] church
[1:49:23] will be none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:49:25] Christ and the word of God Amen and uh
[1:49:30] the good part about him going there is
[1:49:32] you have a nice vacation place to go to
[1:49:35] when you want to visit and uh uh but
[1:49:41] like I said he's walking into the
[1:49:44] unknown but he's got one that knows
[1:49:48] where he's walking and that's what our
[1:49:51] great blessing
[1:49:53] is and we believe that he'll do
[1:49:59] God's
[1:50:00] bidding and he'll be led of the spirit
[1:50:04] and that'll be fruitful so let us just
[1:50:07] pray for him together if you'd all enter
[1:50:10] into prayer together as we go to pray
[1:50:13] for our
[1:50:14] brother our gracious Heavenly
[1:50:17] Father Lord you are sending one out to
[1:50:21] follow his
[1:50:23] desire
[1:50:26] Lord he believes that you have spoken to
[1:50:29] him father and this is your will in his
[1:50:32] life and father we know that we ask that
[1:50:36] he would be a great
[1:50:38] servant father that you give the heart
[1:50:41] of a
