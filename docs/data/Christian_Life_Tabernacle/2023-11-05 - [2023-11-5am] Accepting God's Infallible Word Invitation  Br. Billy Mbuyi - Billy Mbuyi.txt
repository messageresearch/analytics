let's go ahead and bow our heads commit the service to the Lord this morning Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful to you for all things Lord Lord for your keeping hand upon our lives and Lord the fact that we have the health and strength to be able to come to your service this morning Lord to hear of you Lord we have so many things to be thankful of Lord and for your hand in our lives we want to be careful to commit the service to you this morning morning Lord we've want to dedicate this to you Lord not coming with any program of our own or Lord any schedule or agenda or order of events or human expectations but Lord the only expectation we want to have is that you'll fulfill your word that you'll meet us here if we come together in your name so we commit the service to you Lord asking that you'd meet us Lord we want to make you welcome in this place Lord we pray that you'd have your perfect will to move among your people to speak your word to meet every need and to draw us ever closer to you we pray these things in Jesus name amen you may be seated just a few minutes we're going to turn to Psalm 95 for a scripture reading this morning and you know there are certainly you know some familiar verses in this chapter as we'll read it this morning and but it's a little bit of a strange Psalm because it starts out in one way and then makes a turn and takes a completely different tone you know it starts out with verse one it says oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our salvation and you know each verse just a call to praise the Lord and worship Him verse two and verse three and verse four and on down to verse 7 where it says for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand now notice it doesn't say his sheep it says the Sheep of his pasture and then the Sheep of his hand you know as I thought about that the scriptures from John 10 came to my mind where Jesus said he that entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers then if we run down to verse 14 he says I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and have known of mine you know in Psalm 95 it's speaks of the sheep of his pasture but in John 10 it speaks of his sheep so he has a pasture the pasture is his and there are sheep in it and then there are his sheep the Sheep of his hand you know the difference is is that my sheep hear my voice that's the difference they come when I call so there are sheep in his pasture and then there are his sheep the Sheep of his hand you know I was thinking about that as I was reading Psalm 95:7 where it says we are the Sheep of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand not just one but both Jesus says that this this way there's a distinction made and he says this in John 10:26 he says but you believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me you know we've all heard the phrase seeing is believing this is hearing is believing if you hear his voice but you notice at as we read Psalm 95 and we get to the end of verse 7 it makes a turn you know it speaks of him being our God and being his sheep but then as we start to get into verse 7 verse 8 it takes a completely different turn it says today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my work we've already established that my sheep hear my voice they hear his voice but now Psalm 95 says if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart you know if we're careful we're not not careful we read that scripture and that will just attribute that to those who aren't his sheep to those who can't hear his voice but as I was reading this it struck me it's speaking to the sheep that can hear his voice you know as message Believers we're we're well well taught right we we know that he you have to be given an ear to hear and that we' been given an ear to hear when we read the scripture in John 10 that says my sheep know my voice we believe that refers to us but you know Psalm 957 says if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart this is not written to the unbeliever to the sheep that can't hear him but this is written to his sheep those that have a capacity to hear him he's placed within each of us an ability to hear his voice we have the ability but in order to hear his voice each day calling us by name as he says in John 10 we have to take care that our heart isn't hardened that each day it's not too fixed too set on what we're doing that day our circumstances our daily lives the things that are demanding our attention so unmovable so focused that on whatever is in front of us that we miss hearing his voice for that day you know it's interesting how verse 8 in Psalm 95 describes this says Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness that's the example don't be like that but what exactly is that you know the original Hebrew there actually says it this way it says Harden not your heart as in marba and as in Masa in the wilderness and those of you who are Bible students should recognize those names they were names that Moses gave to a place in Exodus 17 if you remember the situation God LED his people to a place called refidim in the wilderness and there was no water to drink and the people the Sheep of his pasture got so focused on their daily needs their daily situations their circumstance for that day their condition they were so determined on F addressing just that thing that was in front of them they became hardened to what God was trying to tell them you know if they had been less hard less fixed on their life their daily life and their daily activities and the things that demanded their time and things that they had to do less focused on those things they would have heard the voice of the Lord you can read it in John or rather in Exodus 1 17:5 they're in that situation and it says and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the Elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith thou smortest the river take in thine hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in horb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink you know that was the voice of the Lord saying go here and you'll have to that smitten Rock and there'll be plenty of water to drink but you know they were so focused on their need that they remain fixed there in Reid and worrying about their water and then in verse eight the enemy snuck up behind them and ambushed them says then came in a battle they wouldn't have had to fight if they weren't so fixed on their daily thing that they were sensitive to the voice of the Lord for that day it says in Exodus 17:7 and he Moses called the name of that place that spot Masa and marba because of the ch in of the children of Israel and because they tempted the Lord saying is the Lord among us or not you know I was reading that and I I got to wondering how many times I'm so focused on my things that I have to do that day the day that's ahead of me the things that's demanded of me the pressures the circumstances the challenges the problems the tasks whatever it is that I become so fixated on those things that I don't hear what he wants to tell me for that day I don't hear his voice now I may play a tape I may rush through a quick prayer I may do all the things but have I heard his voice leading me that day as he called me by name that day and showed me himself you know I wonder how many times we get to the end of the day and we've never really heard from him never been LED from him but instead went immediately to responding those things that daily life requires of us and we get to the end of the day and we talk about the things that we had to address and the things we got done and the where we went and what we did and what we think and never one time can we point back and say the Lord spoke to be here and he led me here and he came on the scene for me here is the Lord among us or not you know I wonder how many times I've allowed my heart to become so fixated so set on what I have in front of me that I failed to hear his voice for that day you know the last thing I want to do is be guilty of these people as it says in numbers 14:22 it says because all these men men which have seen my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me that phrase actually means put me to the test these 10 times and have not hearkened or listened to or heard my voice surrounded by examples and Witnesses and testimonies that they knew so well but so busy on Monday or Tuesday whatever the day is focused on that which is in front of us to do that we don't hear from him let's go ahead and stand this morning you know if we don't make a point to hear his voice personally each day to be led by him then the question is is do we get to the end of the day and can we ask is the Lord among us or no and certainly for me it was uh important reminder you know we should be able to look at each day and say the Lord was here the Lord came by my way I heard his voice and he led me in this way or directed me in this way or caused me to pause here or whatever the case may be is the Lord among us or not let's just go ahead and read that this morning my prayer is that the Lord will help us help me not to be so hardened so fixed so set on what the day has ahead of me that I can't hear his voice in case he might want us to pause and walk down this road instead of catch that scheduled flight to Memphis that's today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart let's read Psalm 95 together oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods in his hand are the Deep places of the Earth the strength of the hills is his also the sea is his and he made it and His Hands formed the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do he in their heart and they have not known my ways unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest amen amen God bless you you can have your seats am let's sing that song to this morning the Days of Elijah [Music] amen and these are the days of Elijah declaring the word of the Lord and we heard the voice of the seven Angel righteousness being restored and though these

just keep gaining forward amen uh let's turn open our Bibles in Luke 14 uh a very familiar scripture reading I want to remember our pastor this morning pray that the Lord will continue to strengthen him amen that he'll be uh uh getting stronger every day amen uh Luke chapter 14 and verse 16 don't forget all the announcements that we made about the meetings and and things and uh those that normally help just know that you'll be called upon and it will be the same thing that we were all always do and amen we want to invite the friends and do all that we can I trust the hour is late we recognize that and we also know that we are looking for the last one amen so it's not time to relax it's the time to get to work it's time to do everything every member of the body supplying to the need of the body so we can get there as quick as possible amen uh Luke chapter 14 uh this is the scripture we uh uh uh heard about the red Wednesday uh verse 16 and the scripture says that and he said unto unto and he said unto him then said he unto him he said a certain man made a great supper and bade many and send his servant at at supper time remember now it's the evening time to say to them that were being come for all things are now ready and they all with uh one con beg begin to make excuses the first said to him I have bought a piece of ground I must need to go and see it it says I pray the have me excus another said I have bought five yolks of uh yolks of ausen oxen and I go to prove them I pray the have me excuse and and another said I have Mar I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so the servant came and showed his Lord these things then the ma then the Master of the House Began uh being angry said unto his servant go out quickly into the streets and and the lanes and of the cities and bring hither the poor and the the maiden and the Halt and the Blind and it says and these and the servant said Lord it is done and NY house as th commanded and yet there's room now I want you to see I thought this was so capturing to my mind because remember the category now that's being called is completely different from the category that was invited so first it was those that had means and those that had ways and and all of that and banam points it out when he talks we we read it we we we we heard it Wednesday when he talks it says oh they are illiterate bunch of people and all of that and he said you have them for 400 years what have you done with them right so God is Not Looking for how smart we are how intellectual we are how we can expand things and do things and make him look like they never been before he's looking for those that are needy if you go you look at all of this category they had some type of need within their bodies they were hungry there were there were those that were blind there were those that that were on the Wayside they were looking for someone to help them so the Lord is here to help those that have need of him those that recognize the need of him that's the one so he said and the Lord said unto his servant go in go out into the highways and the edges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you it says that none of those men which were bat shall taste of my supper father we ask that you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you may have your seats this morning so I have somewhat of uh uh interesting title uh we'll see how we go and and and and the Lord will help us I want to speak on accepting accepting God's in uh infallible word invitation accepting God's infallible word invitation the the prophet right out of this message he he makes uh such a comment right at the top of it and he says that it's men's nature to always turn God's uh invitation down it's n is in is in it's in his nature every time and and we can take ourselves and place ourselves at this and see the application of it because I don't think the word is preached to somebody else it's preached to our own selves so every time we look at the word we need to look at ourselves it's us looking ourselves in the mirror and so he he says there would come and the word will be preached this morning as any other time and but yet within our minds if we are not careful there will be some excuses why we cannot accept it well that's too good oh that's that's that's for somebody else or whether it be correction whether it be Grace or whichever way it comes there's always within the human mind this battle of of accepting and and and re rejecting and and and trying to place it for somebody else or trying to place it in a position where why they cannot receive it they'll say you are pardon and say no no my sins are in a separate category they're very different uh the the blood is not really strong enough even though you can come today you are it's preached to you you believe it but yet tomorrow the devil is going to come and point it right back to you and and so it's always a constant battle between the acceptance and and the fighting to to to to reject or to feel like you're not good enough and it goes on both sides there are those that the word will be preached and they'll feel like well it's not strong enough for them uh it's not it's lacking something or there's a mistake how many people claim there's mistakes in the message how many people have rejected this Prophet because of his education so whether it be on one side or the other there's always a reason that man comes up with on why they are not fully committed to the word of God oh you know it's not really the application is not really what I'm expecting and and all of that is the the the running away from the obligation of the word is the running away from the dedication to the word is the running away from the effect of the word in their lives is the running way of belonging to the word so there's always and and this is human nature that we speaking about here it's always to try to place you somewhere outside of the promise and the guarantees of things that God is doing the word will be preached and and and perhaps you have a loved one that you have within your heart or you or you may be sick or have a a a condition that you need God to help you but yet while the word is being preach the devil is moving you every step out of what is being preached to let you you know that you don't qualify for it now I'm here to tell you this morning you qualify for it this word of God is for you is written for you and it's written to change that circumstance into something that God himself will come and fix for you now the the prophet will say this and it will say in that same message is your life worthy of the Gospel paragraph 34 he say now Jesus is here it says man always tries to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation though it be firmly proven to them oh my it's not about oh I I I I didn't understand it the god the end time manifestation came with a proof that no one else has ever seen before the end time word when it came it came with the Vindication of the pillar of fire itself but the the scripture says now remember remember that the Lord your God will raise another Prophet like it unto Moses and we seen that Prophet it was Jesus Christ but yet in the end time God comes right back and he does something to the Gentile exactly like he did with the Jews but yet there is people finding a way out of it so they can find an excuse why they shouldn't believe it I'm going a little too fast it says firmly Pro to them he says it it's it's his supper and his invitation but man is constantly making excuses and if you read uh in s uh Matthew 22 you'll find out that the excuse were made where it says it went back all the ages it says he went back into the age and he said a man bid them and had a Vineyard he said uh and and and we found that the parable it says how the servant how his servant to uh and he he sent his servant to collect for his Vineyard first servant came what did they do they run him off the next servant came they also stoned him they also stoned him and they turn him and they ran him and they ran after servants off it says cruel man the king sent finally his son Oh my he he's trying to convince this group of people he's trying everything that he can to to let them know that there's an invitation that's been extended here there's something here that God the master is trying to do for you the master is trying to have you continue in the way that you are going he's trying to help you but yet they are running away from it he sent his son and when his son came we found out that they said this is an heir we'll kill him and then we have all the things then Jesus said to them the king sent forth and slew those men it says those those murderers and and burn the cities it continues in paragraph 36 it says now see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something or to receive the invitation that's given him he turns it down then there's nothing left when when you remember he he said that it was sending three pools even when this the first time he went they refused the second and the third all of that was the purpose of getting them to come to the supper but they continually rejected it and then he says when they do that they will do it for the final time it says after Mercy is spurned by judgment it says if you step over the boundaries of Mercy he says then there's only one thing left and that is the judgment and we find that man has done that in all ages it happened most every age in the Bible so every age when God is taking his infallible word is s man is always finding a way to turn it the invitation down and it will they would have excuse as they have here says one said well I just bought a piece of land I got to go and take care of it I've bought an ox and I got to go and prove it and I've gotten married I need to go I can't come and all of this and I want to say this it it didn't matter what the excuse was the the result was the same because we can sit here and begin to say out of this three man who really had the excuse to not come was it the one who was married was it the one who bought the oxen was it the one who just bought a piece of land and you you can look and I want to say this whatever the condition is the the the you you hear this morning it's not because of the lack of excuse of not being in the house of God and I want you to hear what I just said it's not because you didn't have an excuse you you the therefore will always find your weak points he will always find something that he can trigger to keep you out of the promises of God He will always come and and he's the enemy remember they they presented thems elves something that would not make them qualified to come to the feast this is not something that the one who invited took into consideration it the one who invited he didn't care what the situation was he didn't care how a sinner you were he didn't care what family you came from he didn't care what your background was he invited you to the feast so you can show up but you took the word that he gave you and you begin to find within your own life reasons why you couldn't qualify for the feast and I want to say this there's always something present humanly speaking in this life that we can attribute to our desire or a lack thereof of qualifying for the things of God the devil is always there to provide you a reason now remember it's reasonable to you it makes sense to you why you shouldn't be there it makes sense to you why you you could be you need to be excused it makes sense but at the end of the day the effect is the same is that you are not partaking of the things that God wants you to take of you are not taking full benefit of the word that's been given to you and I want to say it doesn't matter because remember he's the master of creating circumstances faith is the master of circumstances but Satan creates them all he's he's the master at taking things and packaging it and and presenting to you in a way that you will look and say oh my I I don't see myself in that that that's just too complicated for me oh that's just too high for me I'm not educated therefore I cannot no it's given to all people it's given the word of God when Jesus died the scripture says that he died for the sins of the world entire world but yet how many received him right so it's not uh the LA of God trying but it's we have to examine ourselves and see what is it in my life that's uh uh blocking me or that's stopping me from serving God fully what is it in my life that's stopping me from being a church every service what is it in my life that's stopping me to be committed to to this gospel what is it in my life that's stopping me from giving my all to God Amen because that's the thing that will stop you from being at the supper it's not that the word is not good enough but it's that you have found an excuse somewhere whether it be on one side or the other to stop yourself from participating I hope that's not too strong just trying to help us this morning so that it doesn't matter how it's presented the end result is the same it doesn't matter the reason what matter is the result and so the scripture will say in Matthew 13:1 which is another Parable that Jesus speaks and he said it says the it says the same day when Jesus uh Jesus out of this um the same day went Jesus out of the house and sat in the seaside and he said a great multitude were gathered together unto him so he knew so he went into a ship and said and the whole multitude stood uh stood on the Shor side excuse me the whole multitude set on the uh uh a sh side and he spake many things unto them in Parable saying behold or so went forth and he swed and when he SED he said some seed fell up fell by the wayside and the fouls came and devoured them it said some fell upon the Tony uh Tony place it says where they had no much Earth no much Earth and and and and uh forth with and it says they sprung up because they had no deepness deep they they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they they were scorched it says and because they had no roots they withered away and some fell among tones and the tone sprungs up and then he choked them and it says and other fell into a good ground and brought fruits brought both fruits and some 100-fold and some six 60-fold and some 30 fold so now year he is and and and it's a almost a similar Parable you you can see the circumstances you can see it wasn't because of the lack of seed and we know the seed represent the word of God it wasn't because there was no word sent forth it wasn't because uh uh the word was not good enough but it was the even when the word was sent it was the condition of the ground that determined what will be what would be got what you get at the Harvest so the ground that was not deep enough that didn't take the seed in and and swallow it in and and took care of the seed that ground didn't bring any much and the ground that had the tonnes out of it now remember all of this is within the ground the ground that had the tonnes on it and everything it took the seed when it grew up it choked it and everything and the prophet will tell us those are the cares of life and things so you find out in every application it wasn't the lack in the word it was the lack of the ground being ready to receive the seed and what the ground did with the seed that he had received and and I want to say this this morning it it's very important because we we have to look at the type of fruits that we are bringing we have to look at the type of life that we are living it says is the life life that I'm living is it Worthy is it a life worthy of the Gospel that I have received why because yes a Pastor said the other he says as far as the world is going down we should be moving up when you receive the Gospel is not to keep you level up with the things of the world it's not to keep you coping with the things of the world but it's to bring you up from the things of the world into the manifestation of the things of the kingdom of God now I I want to say this I'm I'm glad that God has a prepared ground this morning in his word because remember the last group of seed it says when he fall he fall onto a good ground and the prophet said that that ground is a prepared predestinated ground in that word God has a ground that he's been working on since the beginning of time that in the end time I will not even though my seed will be sent out on the worldall even though my word will be the word of ation will be heard by all that have ears but he knew that there will be a group of people a designated group of people a designated piece of ground that would receive that seed and when they receive it it will bring forth a h hundredfold and and I want to say this this morning perhaps this morning all you bringing forth is 3 fold don't stop there don't don't don't sell yourself short don't give yourself an excuse find out what do I need to do from where I am so I can move forth in the 60 fold and if I'm bringing only the 60 fold what do I need to do so I can get in the 100 fold so because the more word we receive is the more word will Express I don't have time to read this but Pam said Jesus believed the word and he says he was he believed the word until he became one with with the word that's right I thought Jesus was the word he says they believed it so much that he became one with the word and and the reason I like it is because the prophet is trying to take you from the excuse section where I'm not good enough oh Jesus was the word I'm not the word how am I going to become the word now he tells you now Jesus he believed so much the word that he became one with the word and if this morning we can believe the word so much until we become one with the word we'll have the same expression we'll have the same God manifested in our lives so the prepare ground I want to say this morning that this prepared ground is not interested in the cares of life right is not interested in what the world has to offer this prepared ground cares about one thing and I need to bring a h hundredfold of the word that's been committed to me that is a personal decision because remember this is a personal relationship as the prophet will say that is a personal uh uh uh decision that individual makes when the word of God is preached unto them is to say that God I want thaty word to produce a hundredfold in my life there has to be a desire within your heart there has to be an application of the word there has to be a commitment to the word there has to be an obligation to the word and so it's not it's a predestinated ground regardless of the reason regardless of whatever season and condition it find itself in it doesn't make any excuses it press forward like the prophet will talk about the Lily it says it it could have looked and said well I have all all kinds of excuses why I shouldn't go out I have all kinds of excuses why my this flower cannot go up I have all the MK I have all of this I have all of this against me I'll just stay here but even in that condition that it was because it was predestinated to be called by the sunlight it didn't make an excuse it continued to push until it came out to the sunlight now I I want to read this and and before I move on and I I hope this is going to now remember I I said this is a predestinated uh piece of ground it's as the prophet will say so even when the word is going forth it was not addressed to all it was only addressed to a certain particular but the prophet will speak this in the message is it is the rising of the sun paragraph 124 he says now oh my the predestinated one he says of course I like like it says it says like the seed laid upon the Earth it says the one that laid that the one that had life in them it says many of them were dead they were just rotten seeds they were rotten seed the water and the things burned them out it says but you know there was a seed laying ready for life oh I trust you're ready for life this morning God I'm always ready because remember he said the the this it's not about a one- time thing it's a constant battling every day for the expression of Christ out of your life it's a Daily Grind it's a daily pushing it's a daily exercise every morning you woke up Satan already got his priority set it up for you what you're going to do and everything that is caused all the chaos that is caused for you you have to work up and say I refuse to take your priority I take the priority of the word I'll put God first and go forward we heard brother Tim Sal mention and I it has to be I I'm working up today my my my my primary goal is that I need God to speak to me about the direction of the day I need God to show me what I need to do it's not just me running around all day long putting out fires put out fire here fire over there put out fire over there fire you'll do that every day I I'll say this I go to sleep not finishing what I had to do the day before and what and then yet there's more waiting for me the next day sorry so so he says uh there were pred rating for life it says God know it was laying there there now listen to this now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the Holy Ghost for the for the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit comes to claim its own remember now in this message that's where the Prophet tells us that the Holy Spirit was sent to hunt those predestinated seed to hunt them out to bring them out of whatever holes they were in wherever they will run and hide they will come and kick them out out this is not a peaceful coming this is a shaking of Your World this is a kicking you out of wherever you are in this is changing your world so you understand that God is the only thing that's important and I want to say this if you are predestinated seed you got to wait for the shaking coming if you are not living right wait for the shaking is coming why God will get you whatever out you are in he will bring you into his program it's it's the hunting it's not the piss for oh please come oh he will lay you flat on your back he will do whatever it takes so you can come so either you come peacefully or you come by hunting but either way you will come in we fail to realize that God is in control of all of it anyway so the Holy Spirit comes out and he's the desire his objective is to Quicken nose the predestinated one by his word so when they hear the word something within the heart a predestinated seed within will hear and hunger for the reality of the word to be manifested now it says now the predestinated one it says uh uh the pr are the ones are first quickened by the Holy Ghost it says for the Holy Ghost comes to claim those uh it says now this is deep now listen be sure to catch this good now paragraph 126 it says now it says the sun was sent across the Earth not to Quicken not to bring the Rocks not to bring the Rocks which are the dirt also this is very important to life it was not to bring all the dirt to life but was was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around a life oh I read this this morning my heart was just overflowing I couldn't even contain myself not all men will receive Christ but oh but those which God for ordained to life for ordained life in in a house around some of the dirt of the earth he said says those he says that's the one that he comes to Quicken he says they are the ones he says that's that now that dirt would lay there in the Sun and say the sun is too hot and let me say this it say the sun is too hot the rocks will say this old son is too hot now let me say this and and I feel like it's very important I say this the the the Rocks when the sun comes it gets hot it shout it jumps and it brings forth oh it's it's in it's on fire but the moment the sun goes down it's back cold again and he waits for the sun to come up again so it can get hot and then cold and then hot and then cold but when the seed the plant receives it it's another type but what I'm saying that when you receive it and let me just say this this is me saying it God has a process of the energy transfer the sun will transfer the energy that he has into the plant and it becomes food for the plant and the plant is able to grow to move out of the cycle of hot and cold down and up and and going this way and that way God created that process so don't be the son the one that would receive and just get called and get hot and hot and then get cold no ask for God that the sunlight that's coming let it be transformed into food let it feed my soul so I move from just being cold to hot and never go cold again otherwise you get stuck in the same cycle all the time time because to the Sun to the Rock it's just getting it hot man I'm getting hot and and and I love this it's getting warm and we we shouting I I I don't care if I shout or not I don't care if I'm the most quiet or if I'm the most loud low you be what God made you to be but the result of it is I need a change in a growth yes they were all part of the vegetation but the rock that Earth was not what the sun came for even though it will receive the energy of the sun it didn't know what to do with the energy except get hot and cold but the plants on the other hand knew how to go through the process of energy transformation it will Tak in the energy and someone through the process he will take that it becomes food in it it becomes food in it and he goes from going this little plant and he grows into a tree to bring forth fruits so that the master can come and take of its fruit let me move forward and the prophet will say I'll go back to the other message it said a Christian is not a tool or something of a mechanical range paragraph 129 is the life worthy of the Gospel range to bring uh to to it says arrange uh to a great big religious uh regime he says that's right a Christian is not some kind of tool that keeps religious organization moving a Christian is not it says it's not a Christian that's not a Christian it says a Christian is to be Christlike to be born again to receive the energy of the Sun and turn it into something useful it says and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man the Life of Christ is in him then it produced the life that Christ lived and it says and you do things that Christ did it says what it says what am I to talk about personal what am I talking about it says personal relationship personal relationship to Christ what is it it's your is your life worthy of the Gospel so what what we are looking for is the moving forward or the the transformation out of this uh excus cycle why this cannot be why cannot be why I can't progress why I can't do this why do I seem to be failing taking those excuses turning them into something that God can come and change taking those excuses and using them as opportunity that I am lacking of the Sunray so I can receive of the Sun so I can mature in my life he said there but there's only one uh says but there's only one church and there's only one way you can get into it and that's the by birth he said you are born into the Church of Jesus Christ and a member of his body of the spiritual delegation of heaven then the signs the signs that Christ is in you the signs that Christ is with you lived through you as say this you you can take all the intellect you can take all of the understanding just give me life just give me life because this gospel didn't come to just so we can become intellectual giant but it came so that life could be produced it came to bear The Life of Christ in you it came to produce the Life of Christ in you he says here it says it says that the things will produce that it says that's the new birth the new birth is the only thing that will produce the relationship to God that's right he says a son and a daughter then then he says when this takes place he says and here's the question I get I I I get I I want to get to you it says the the man say he said uh what do you do after you've been born again listen to this many asked that question I should it says I should I said what should I then do what should I do then brother brandham if you are born again your entire nature is changed you are dead to the things you once thought and and and I I I read these things because there has to be a way by which we are know if we are progressing or not there has to be some type of fruits that's manifested out of the seed that we have received to know is the seed in me producing the very fruit that God is Desiring out of me is the seed in me marching towards the the destination that God has intended for it to go and I want to say this this morning his word to to us is an invitation for us to get out of our Humanity because remember that's where the excuse is found in our mental in our Humanity how we were because of the way we were born how we were raised how we grew up all of that presents a challenge and an excuse that we bring forth but his word is an invitation to us to get out of our humanity and to partake of his infallible word to partake of his infallible word his word in every age is an invitation to get you out of whatever you are in and get you into the land where all things are possible oh my I I I don't know about you I get tired of living in this world where everything seems impossible you can't do this you can't do that you can't do this says I want to move out of this realm and get into a realm where all things are possible and his word is what presented to you let me say this again his word in every age is an invitation to get you out of whatever you find yourself in to come into the land where all things are possible the scripture we say all things are possible to God God turns it around and says all things are possible to them that believe amen that's right so all things are possible to God all things are possible to you if you believe so we don't just take it and put it upon God God wants you to be a partaker of his divine nature he wants to share his power with you he wants you to taste what it is to be God and I'm tired to taste being like a man I want to taste what it means to be God I I want to think like one I want to think and and act like one and his word is our entrance into that his word to us this morning is an invitation of a way out of this Dying World out of this Dying World into the perfect word To The Feast that he has prepared I want to say this he said this morning ye that are heavy laden ye that are tired ye that have your take he says ye that are hungry it says those that have no money though that have no price he said come on in he's inviting you this morning don't let anything stop you this morning say God I have heard the invitation of your word in the end time and I'm coming in you say well I've seen a lot that's not what's going to stop you let me say this the invitation has what it takes to make you ready for the feast his invitation will tell you will give you what to dress how to walk like how to talk like a Christian how to behave like a Christian where where your seat is going to be what robe you will be dressed in how you going to get from here to there the invitation has all of that included so people reject the invitation the packages all and they go trying to find their own way to make it you won't make it outside of the invitation you'll be like that man who was found in there and all of a sudden he didn't have the robe and so they asked him they said by which way did you get in here he didn't follow the invitation he didn't receive the invitation he didn't read what the invitation requirements were this is not like a human invitation where we say well come and bring some dessert or bring and come and do this or do that no you just show up all the seven courses prepare for you in fact we're going to send you the clothes to wear we're going to bring the send the car to come pick you up we we'll we'll do everything we'll give you a room to stay we'll provide everything you just accept the invitation and everything will be ready for you how can you turn down such an invitation just how let me say this the scripture says come let us rason together though you SE be right as Crimson it said I shall wash you clean come let me show you what I have in store for you that's the gospel in the end time God has reserved it for the weakest the Blind and the lame and the needy people those that couldn't help themselves he's always taken his gospel hate it from the wise and the pden those that feel like they can get there by themselves but he's always made it available to those little babes those that don't know anything those that need help those that need help this morning so he can come and do it for them and I want to say this whatever the struggle is don't let your excuse keep you out of it don't young people I don't care what you struggle with I don't care what is it you feel like it will keep you out of church you let the word of God deal with that don't deal with it yourself you let the word of God deal with it say God I have heard your calling but yet I'm dealing with all this stuff I don't know how to get out of it if you truly have called me to be to that supper I need you to make a way out of this so I can be in the supper God Will Make A Way there's no one that's going to get there by his own strength each one that will be there will have a story about the grace of God that's taking him out of the circumstances that he knew nothing about am it's not the Gathering of the the stronger no it's the Gathering of the elected those that God has paid the price for those that God has died for those are the ones that are going to be there and I want to say this regardless of the question the word is the answer the word is the answer the word is the answer to the struggle the word is the solution to a human problem look at that stuck in men's economy and stock market and inflation and all of this stuff and today you know you you you save a little money tomorrow that money becomes nothing you you get this person over here I mean this is handled by mens I mean they just moving the strings and and you don't understand it's like why would you cause everybody to lose their jobs I it doesn't make any sense how can people get in such a situation where you can no longer Express what you believe oh it's considered violence violence who is committing violence is it you that's causing me to believe what you are or it's me that standing for myself the world has gone completely insane and the only thing that will get out of here is the invitation that we have received so I I beg you this morning do not play with the invitation don't play with this word of God let it be the first thing in your life when you wake up in the morning whatever you find yourself in I don't care how much trouble you are in you put the word first God will come to your [Music] rescue thank Lord if you receive the invitation you are putting God under the obligation to make a way so you could be there he doesn't want to hear it I didn't make it because I didn't have anything to dress he said no I'll provide the dress I didn't have I didn't make it nobody came to pick me I said I will pick you up oh I didn't make it because I needed the Holy Ghost I'll give you the Holy Ghost I didn't make it because I couldn't overcome I will give you overcoming power it's the word it's a complete complete word it covers the beginning to the end of it it's God manifestation in the end time Oh my he has a word allotted for each generation but when it comes to the end time he pulls everything that he was that's the word we have received it says the all that God was that word was not applicable in the first age it was not applicable in the second age it was not applicable in the third age but in the end time the scripture says that all that he was he poured into Christ and Christ takes all that he was he poured into his people the full strength of God is for you amen I invite you into the land of the infallible word the land where all things are possible God's word is the God's word is the program his word to you is an invitation to the land where all things are possible is the invitation out of the main systems that we've been stuck in into the system of God it's an invitation into the land where all things are possible it's an invitation to taste and see what the Lord can do it's not given for us to just take and talk about it or just tell someone else so they can believe our story no it's given with personal invitation and personal experience so everybody that's at the table knows something about what it means to taste of God Amen hallu you say I never taste it up you just didn't see it you just haven't realized it's like that man says I I I said I the little kid said I never I want to see God I never see I said God is all over you just haven't been looking the right way you just haven't had the eyes to look at it and I want to say this this morning it's an invitation to the land of immortal it's an invitation to the Eternal eternal life forever it's moving out of the cycle where men are born and the dead and the things of the world and moving into a new cycle where you shall never die where whatever you have ch he doesn't ask you go solve your challenges then come to me no he just wants you to be elevated with all your challenges solve them not according to the human way but solve it according to God's way the problem is we try to do it ourselves God said no bring them all to me that's what I specialize in things thought impossible and let me say this the word of God is infallible I I I want to say this the word of God is infallible and when we think of God's word we are thinking about something that can never fail I want you to remember that every time you are thinking about God you are thinking about an eternal yes That Remains the Same every time something that will never fail when you take God's word we are taking the routes of the permanent of a permanent Victory when when we are taking the provided way we are taking God's solution the sad part is it seems like we have to try all of our own Solutions and when they fail that's when we try try to wonder well I wonder where God is he's been there all time he's been there all the time so we are taking when we are taking God's word we are taking God we are becoming like God himself and the result is certain excuse me in the message the super sign and I thought this was really a blessing to me uh I've heard it before but it just I was as I was meditating it just came to my mind and it was really a blessing so he says this in the message the super sign paragraph 26 it says I want I want you to notice the unchanging continuity of God's word and his work the unchanging continuity of God's word and his work he says he never changes he he never changes his program he never changes his way just as perfect perfectly the scripture is in perfect continuity everything that God does is in continuity with what he done that's right so when we when we come to God oh I love this that's why the scripture cannot be broken when we read the scripture and we read about Martha and we read about Moses we read about all of them we know that the continuity will make that God will make that word the same it cannot he cannot come to Moses and save him and come to you and fail you the continuity is broken so therefore the prophet will tell us we need to be a people with an understanding as because remember I I keep saying this the word is an invitation into this word is this in this infallibility of who he is so when he's giving you his word you know that you are becoming infallible as you are receiving his word you mean infallible yes you won't fail you won't go wrong you won't you won't be denied you won't be cast down you can't be lost the scripture says what shall we say of these things if God for us oh my if we can only get God on our side if we understand that he's there on our side what can go wrong it's like having a little child you know my kids thinks I can fix everything so they'll go and break something and I look and I see oh yeah this I could put it together and then they break it a different way and then bring it back and then they'll bring it another time I'm looking at it I was like I can't fix it they don't understand that because as far as far as they're concerned I have to fix it I'm the dad I I'm I'm the one who supposed to know and when you look at them in confusion you're like I don't know what to do they look at you and they're like what do you mean you don't know oh I tell you that's how it is with God but we are me we fail but God never failed it doesn't matter which way you break it it doesn't matter which way you turn it it doesn't matter what confusion you find yourself in you bring it to him he will fix it it's the infallibility of God I have spoken my word I can't take it back my word can't go and return for it it will produce every time oh my let let's realize that every day when you woke up in the morning don't forget that when you in trouble don't forget that just understand my father is able I miss stop I shouldn't have done this I don't know how I got myself into it but one thing I know is my father can fix [Music] it it just works my heart you know when we go on and you know we here supposed to be the light and yet Our lives our priorities are messed up and we have all kinds of things coming in and all of that and you wonder where is our mind at what's causing all of this why are we rejecting the invitation can we not see that God is here calling day and night can we not say that he wants to resolve your problem you have money problem God will solve it you have a job problem God will solve it you have a sickness problem you put God first the the problem is we don't want to put him first you put him first you say God if I lose it I lose it because I put you first yes he will come to your rescue you want to see God come to work you put his word first you will see the mighty conqueror you will see him in a way you never seen him [Music] before God's character is always shown up in people being in despair the name of God is not a title it's something that God earned yes that's right when we call him Jehovah Jara is not out of the suddenly just say call me Jehova no he came to one named Abraham who was supposed to give his son who was supposed to give his son to be dead and he stood there and he took his son and he was about to kill him the angel came and hold his hand and says do not do that out of this place God created a lamb that's right God created a lamb out of nowhere that's where he got his name from what is your situation right out of all the seven Redemptive name is there not one that comes to mind is not one that's going to be applicable if you need three names he'll come and combine all three names the the woman who came and Jesus told him that I can't give the food of the children to dogs there was no place for him in the Kingdom of the Jews but he said thou Al Lord the creator of all she invoked not a title she couldn't approach him as a son of David she had no right coming as a son of a daughter of David but she came and said I know even though you are the son of David you are also Lord of all things and not created another place she tapped another title that God was obligated to come in help what title do you need this morning let's not be ashamed let's not be bitten down the Christian has to be the most happy person that's on the face of the Earth because you have something that the world doesn't have you have access to something that the world knows nothing about yes thank thank you sorry we'll continue another time if the musician can [Applause] come the infallible word of the Mighty God he doesn't want it to remain up in heaven he wants the application of it in this human realm he wants to give you access into a place where all things are possible where God is manifesting himself constantly where he can come and move on your behalf where you can come and know for sure that I'm standing on God's word and I cannot be moved not be one that runs through and fro and pray and then run away oh God must have not hurt me I have two plans if God doesn't do I'll do no he wants you to be committed he wants you to be dedicated to his word it's his word or [Music] nothing see the challenges of life shouldn't be the determining factor of our Christianity it doesn't matter how hard the things get out there you hold on to him don't do oh the challeng is are pulling you you let go of him and you go take care no you hold let the challenge if it's going to rip it off let it rip off what is it we afraid God can't repair whatever the devil can do now think about the Bor that bam talks about in Finland yeah he is is just ran over completely dead blood flowing out now where when he was raised where did that blood come from did God go and collect all the blood off of the floor and put it back in [Music] him what happened the woman in Mexico with a dead baby it was pronounced dead it was [Music] done what happened see the woman believe in the infallible God he just knew that if I can get to this man to pray for my baby I know that God will do something she went and she fought and Billy Paul said that I try to get her to stop all the deacons everybody they couldn't stop her there's nothing that could stop her my brother my sister we need that kind of challenge we need that kind of favor we need that kind of fights inside of us we don't something happen and we qu and we no we need the type of fight that I'm not going to quit God is with me if I'm going through challenges he knows I'm going through challenges I'm going to stay here until it does something for me and if it's content for me to be here in my suffering I'll stay in my suffering but what says what would it take if you would live a million years it says I'll still take eternal life because out of the after the million year suffering I will live forever but we have it the other way we have all the cares of this life and the little 70 80 90 100 years that we have outed that's what we prioritize but yet eternal life is just around the corner what would he profit a man through getting the whole world and lose his own soul or what would a man give in exchange to his own soul let don't let the excuse stop you this morning I understand that the word absorbs all your excuses and he makes a way let's all stand our gracious father we're so thankful Lord this morning what really could we say about you that haven't been said by all the Saints of all the ages Lord Your Glory just keeps getting bigger and bigger Lord Lord I can imagine the Praises of your people or your children oh God we're just going to Rejoice forever realizing who you really are and what you were about and father I pray may you change our eyesight this morning and the goal is not to bring condemnation but to bring a realization of something that God is working on help us Lord where we are weak and make us strong and that may we realize that your word of invitation has everything in it Lord God that we may hang on to it and be changed we want to commit if there be any need represented in the body Lord we continue to remember our pastor Lord we pray and we claim good health for him Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may you touch his body and make him well and whatever is bothering him Lord we cast it out in the name of Jesus Christ you have given him a job to do and we commit him to you that Lord that you continue to keep him in good health bless your children this morning those that are listening from home and wherever Lord if there be one thing that we may come to the realization that our father can fix it all our father has it all under control lead us and guide us Lord we love you Lord and we ask that you bless us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen ammen let's just sing that as brother Cosman comes this morning [Music] amen oh my oh when you are [Music] [Applause] more oh for oh [Music] and [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] je

want to make it back for foot washing and communion tonight you can come back but I think it's just fair to provide the opportunity what an invitation of the word of God personally to our own lives you know brother Billy was mentioning you know an invitation gives you all the requirements that we must have and as he was saying that I was thinking about how God unfolds himself by every word that is inside of the Bible it'll clothe us we become righteous it's like a scavenger hunt you know he wants you to go look at this one thing today and is like I want you to have Victory and healing today and the next time you open up another envelope you're like oh today you are going to be an overcomer tomorrow you're going to do this you're going to grow it's a constant walking with the word of God inviting you every day so he can live inside of our hearts sa what an opportunity so I invite you this morning if you have need of something the invitation has been made God never changes our attitudes change our motive changes our objective changes but he never changes he's always been the same and how do you know him by his love he's here Among Us this morning and provided an invitation let's take it if you need prayer you're more than welcome to come up brother Billy can pray for you if maybe you haven't heard that there's a kingdom Beyond this world that there's an actual Dimension that we could be living in as Sons and Daughters of God something that we can taste I want to be like Joshua if I tasted of the kingdom of God I want to testify of the kingdom of God I want to say how good it is to eat of that land because it's not a land that that we've he paid a blood for that land for us to be able to inherit eternal life and it's a sacred invitation oh my what a beautiful place how it makes us happy how we rejoice it gives us it gives us that fighting dog inside of us to say you know I want more I want I really want to make it out there this is it I'm not I don't want the
