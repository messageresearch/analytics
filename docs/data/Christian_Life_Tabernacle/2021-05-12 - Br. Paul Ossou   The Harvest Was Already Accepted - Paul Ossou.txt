anointing may be upon us that [Music] while we give ourselves back into your hands oh no this is in the name of the lord jesus amen to someone called as we still standing [Music] let's take our bibles and open it in the book of leviticus uh leviticus the 23rd chapter uh we're going to read from verse 9 to 11. and the lord speak unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and you say you should you and say unto them when ye come into the land which i gave unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then ye shall bring a sheave of the first fruit of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheave before the lord to be acceptable for you on the on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it may have been your cooking for set for all father we ask you bless again your word in the name of the lord jesus amen you may have your seats who's giving me again the opportunity to speak uh this afternoon i asked my wife a question okay i asked darling do you think i can sp i can preach in english i like her she looked at me with she looked at me she said are you sure she said i'm sure when you when you preach at the end nobody would have understood anything you said darkness you don't even try to adventure me and when brother billy uh greeted me outside he asked me the same question are you going to preach in english i said they already warned me that if i try nobody will understand and when brother david came in asked me again the same question i wouldn't be able to sp with my pronunciation if i try you wouldn't understand anything so i want you to be patient that i would speak in french like i have a great interpreter if you're quaking my ponzi i believe that lord will help that my thought will go across [Music] from the scripture we write in leviticus i would like to title my little thought tonight the the harvest was already accepted in this scripture in leviticus when they left egypt to the promised land under the the guide of moses sula conducted under the guiding of god himself because god made a promise to abraham that your prosperity will your posterity will go in the country that they will go into slavery and then after 400 years i will deliver them myself and when the children of israel found themselves in nature when they went into slavery go to moses unto the jew moses was this mighty hand of god to deliver the children of israel if god guided these people through moses he was there with them under the disguise of the pillar of fire london and it was the cloud by day yes and these people was under the guidance of god these people were waiting for something from god a jedi and god was giving these people instructions god gave them what they had to do hey don't leave the leviticus this book of leviticus chapter 23 [Music] god was asking moses to tell to the children of israel to to to observe certain feasts we'll see that there was a lot of feast that that god will ask the children of israel to observe he was asking them to to observe the the feast of uh passover and we know that the feast of passover la premiere shows la la premiere the first time that they celebrated this feast of passover it was when they had to leave egypt to go into the promised land and god asked them to remember that that they may always have in their minds is that the angel escape that one day they were slaves that god in his goodness god in his mercy he came and he thought about uh delivering them upon that without the grace of god there was no deliverance and then after that feast of passover either please don't they had other feasts a lot of other feasts that they had to observe come la fete depends on liver that the feast of the bread without leaven la fete de tabernacle and there's one of the feasts that we read in verse nine oh jealous where god is giving them an instruction that when you will be in the country that i promised you when you have uh gather up your harvest position when you have come to the position that i want you to be when you will be in the land of promise when you will have and reap your harvest you want to take a a a a a a sheave you want to take the first fruit of that that that harvest you're going to bring it to the priest and the priest will wave the sheave on one side and the other side and the priest will wave the sheave the next day of the sabbath and we knew we know that the the this sheave wave was only the first fruit of the harvest when you can you can only go and harvest the fruit only when the seed has come to maturity agita and the priest had to wave it one side and the other side the next day of the heart of the sabbath so it's the first day of the week it was only a type of the new testament not model it was our model amen the word made flesh and christ when he came on earth he said unless the grain of wheat goes into the ground it is unless the grain of wheat goes into the ground it abides and those fruit has also have to come to maturity so this sheave that was to be waved on one side and the other sacrifices you have to understand that the high priest or the priest could not wave the sheave on the day of the sabbath and we know that sabbath for the for the jews is saturday the next day the first day which is sunday sacrifice was the day that the priest was to wave the sheave they're like that's why christ who was this seed that came to maturity who was the resurrection of jesus christ set up for prove it was to prove god that the price was paid that god may open a door for each and every one of us so we can come to the maturity that's what god is calling us too to be tempted as a man whoever come enough to be it was the first cone of god the gods wheat that had to be raised from the dead le premier grande jew god god's first corn of wheat palace and he was the first fruit of those that sleep the first fruit he was the sheep voila that's what it says that's why they had to waive that shift for for it was the first one that came to maturity okay and it was waived as a memorial of thanksgiving to god that to thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come to it it was a sign so when christ resurrected that is that was proving that god accepted the harvest that god accepted us until the rest of the children of god they are also accepted [Applause] god has already accepted us god promised it through christ but it's for us it's to come it's for us to come to the promised land to take hold of the promise that is to be certain that we are part of that harvest because that what god did with christ not just that he can do it he dwells that he has to do it but guys yes you remember because jesus himself says your faith as your heavenly father is perfect when christ said be he perfect he knows that we can be perfect even when we feel our own weaknesses mankind is some fable even when we are weak paul tells us that the perfect strength of god is manifested in perfect weakness come i am going [Applause] himself he was saying to his disciples i will not leave you alone i will come to you again i will be in you until the end of the world the holy spirit that's death will come upon you and you will make of you my witnesses and the day of the pentecostal i want you to observe these disciples that were cowardly they walked with jesus all the time they heard the preaching of jesus christ we see peter even come to deny jesus we see the two disciples on the way to emmaus just completely uh just uh lost the holy spirit of god that destiny from them it came upon them on uh in the form of the then and the tongues of fire fall upon him i want you to realize these people who were scared they're joking the people who lost hope when they received this power when they were shaken they came out of the upper room filled with power filled with courage because they knew they received something they knew that the same thing that brought christ to maturity the facts that the promise that christ made god sent the speaking of the dead but the holy spirit that was supposed to descend upon them we noticed last sunday new presidency we were preaching on feasts there was the feast of the pentecost and between the feasts of the pentecost and the feast of the trumpet there was a long period of time exactly exactly 50 days between the feast of pentecost and the fist of the trumpet and 50 the harvest 50 days and pentecost means 50. it was the sheave waving the the first fruit of the harvest was brought in and we see it was a type back there a local premise naturally represented a premise you sentence me with a natural uh fresh fruit representing the first fruit of the holy spirit to be poured upon the people and we find out then that them that there was 50 days was received by the gentiles which god called the gentile people for his name the feast of the pentecost and we have been going through the long feasts of pentecost it was another opportunity to wave the sheaves to say that outside of christ who was the first fruit he is christ who was the first among us there is a part of the seed the foundation the foundation of the seed that has also come to maturity that the priest had to wave to see that the harvest was accepted the holy spirit fallen upon the disciples the center through the holy spirit upon the disciples and when the holy spirit came upon the disciples the life that was in christ the power that was in christ fall upon the the disciples and tells us and when the holy spirit is descended that has shown that they had come to maturity and what i promised when peter preached his first sermon on the day of pentecost that every one of you may be baptized in the name of jesus in the name of jesus for the forgiveness of your sins don't descend and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost every what what god asked for it was for us to repent on yourself and for us to be baptized in the name of jesus and the remaining is no longer our problem and you shall receive and he says this promise is for you for your children and all that are far off oh no as many as our lord god shall call god if you also accepted this question if you only believe that this promise is also for you a prescription and you follow the prescription of peter god is obligated to give you the holy spirit god is under obligation to bring you into this harvest that was already accepted he watches upon his promise for him to bring it to pass what god is asking from us it's to accept it to believe it it's for us to take hold on regardless of circumstances that are coming before us let's do a caleb when they went to inspect the country they were uh children children of anarch it was the jebusites and they were tall and big man and there was a reality that presented in front of them that they were like grasshoppers in front of those people it was true easy take on this they were like grasshopper before them but those it was only eyes that were looking at but when caleb looked through with the eyes of god he said that's true we are like grasshoppers but god told us that this country belonged to us how is god going to make me take this country i don't know but all i know that god told me that this country belonged to us who said your sister all i know that i'm sure of take a dream that god told me the promise of the holy spirit is mine color christians you must i don't care how how strong is the uh pressure of the world in the united states i don't care just take a job for me i know god promised me you said this promise god can do so that i can become like christ you have for me because your dwarf when you come here god promised that i must become like jesus god promised that jesus died to take my place and it means i don't have any place in the world the only place that belongs to me is for me to take jesus place because the harvest was already accepted the bible tells us romans chapter 8 [Music] let's take verse 11 and 12. the romans chapter 8 is is a marvelous scripture that i but if the spirit of him that raised christ from the dead dwells in you he that raised christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwells in you therefore brethren we are not deaders we are we are we are we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh here we notice the bible is telling us because he listens that if the spirit yeah that raised christ from the dead still it will also quicken our mortal bodies his second knew that when they called mortal he knows the spirit knows that we have moral bodies he said what they call the he knows that we have bodies of sin he said he knows that we are conceiving iniquity and born in sin is second he knows that we live in an environment of sin milan but he said that he will take off his spirit he'll make that on he will put that spirit in it and when he had put that spirit in us even fiercer he will quicken it will bring this body to submission like the body of christ it will bring this body to live the word of god but one of them says he killed project it says what does it do meth no equity now listen pakis so that you'll know this issue i want this to mean more to you than any easter ever did don't let me say don't leave me tell you we know what he had done for him but i want you to see it not will but has that has done the same for you it's not gonna produce because but what he or what he has already done he has already produced the same thing in you he had already done it all that we have to do what does it do by the act that was accomplished at the cross christ he's bringing us back to life christ is bringing us life the father of the kingdom brother adam says he already done it he cannot bring us to a place to believe that the son of an act at all because the promise belongs to us because the the harvest was already accepted has not been accepted today was already accepted it's for us to grab hold of the promise he says you you women that once had your short hair painted and carried on who portrayed the shot and and and wore shorts hey there and things like that all at once see [Music] when we believe that that that we are part of that harvest when we believe that christ who was resurrected that the same spirit that raised christ from the dead that when i received the holy spirit please when i receive the spirit my being becomes subject to the word and i begin to say amen to every word i did a man a lot of jew i say amen to every word to say amen to the word is just not a screaming it's just not coming to church and we rejoice and we will scream amen to say amen to the word of god is let it be because that what the word is saying i have to [Music] to be adapted to us but it's for us to be to adapt to the world it's for us to be subject to the world it could is there anything impossible to god there's nothing impossible to god there's nothing impossible if there is nothing impossible and to know that that belongs to us dwells in it's uh the rising of the sun paragraph 155. comment rate commit adultery and all these things a quicken them yesterday and much why that thing died it would your body you've heard from denomination to the world the the harvest was already accepted let's go back to the book of romans le chapito chapter eight is a real verse i'm gonna go to verse 28 the bible tells us and we know gratuitous shoes that are all things work together for good of them that love god the cirque de santa please who are called according to his purpose he know that he knows us today those that he he foreign did predestinate to be to be conformed to the image of his son affair the premiere don't preserve that he might be the firstborn among many brothers [Music] christ was the firstborn christ was the first fruit don't please the afraid of many brothers who who are the brotherands it's you and i are true it's you and i that are his brother and he continues and he continues it's because god called us that blessing and if he called us because he knew us before the foundation of the past it's because he predestinated us that he called us tonight i have a scripture that i love it's when i read amos the bible says that god will send uh famine and and hunger amos uh 8 11. don't let we'll have the famine and the thirst to hear the word of god they will go from one side to the other yeah they'll go from uh the the the orient to the occident to look for the word of the lord but they won't find it [Music] and they are condemned and when god knew that we couldn't find ourselves in that promise and that he couldn't change his mind also because god opened a special breach it says for you that are fearing my name but for you that i knew before the foundation of the world here it is the word it means god knew you before the foundation of the world it means god predestinated you and that's why he called you tonight and he says a circular and whom he called them he also justified hallelujah hallelujah and justify means that when you repent when you feel bad about the past that you had when you when you feel bad about the wrong that you're dead when you present yourself before god it's a prosecution god takes that sin he trusted in the sea of forgetfulness he can't even remember that you sinned one day of your life done it to begin with to succeed yes that is difficult to to to take part into this job it's just to repent it says and the remaining is my blessing and the remaining is no longer your problem if your neighbor could say look that so this one did such and such yesterday when god looks at you he says no he never done nothing he'd never done wrong it's a son of god because when you forgive a person you can remember that the person said but when he justified that he he forgives and he forgets men are identification he brings us into the identification of his son he knows that men are completely many shows because of his he brings us to to to do the same works that his son did in his glory he glorifies us he brings us to adoption he brings us into his image it was such wonderful paul says he says what shall we say of these things if god be for us if the promise is for us who can be against us him who never spared his son makila but he has given him for us all he says with him also freely give us all things in other words because god has already fulfilled what he needed with uh brighter and all um to come to the same level with christ he says it says who shall uh who shall who shall accuse the elect of god it's god who justifies don't worry about what the neighbor is going to say who will condemn who will lay any charge on god's elect [Applause] who has the power to condemn who has the right to condemn daniela who shall lay any charge kiss them all christ died and yeah he rather uh he says he it's it is that resurrected and he's at the right hand of god who where he's making who who also maketh into the intercession for us is interceding for us when the father looks at us he's looking us through christ he's looking us through the blood of jesus and he looks that we are without sin because we've been accepted he says he says who shall separate us from the love of from the love of christ shall it be tribulation or the distress or persecution or uh and god is calling us god is calling us that we are not supposed to leave like just any human mortal men of this world here again we don't we don't really see it that much all right but back home in africa when you are a son of a president when you are a son of a king don't you pass when you go by everybody has to know that you're signing up jeff is too pleased everybody knows you're a son of a president no stop defeating the fee we are sons and daughters of the king of kings you say no the lord of lord god almighty and god is calling us to walk like sons and daughters and when this life come to quicken us and this when the spirit comes to give us the dynamic the spirit the scripture says that the whole nature is is crying on a ton of manifestation defeated you looking for the manifestation of sons and daughters of god that nature itself is groaning nature is looking waiting for us to take the position of christ i thought there was a teacher who was teaching little kids you love he made a description of jesus christ that there was a man uh you can uh said villains you can curse him he's not going to get mad you can hit him on the right chest he'll give you the left cheek he was only doing good he was living a life of prayer young child was looking like this and god is calling us to be there and to get there remarkably look at jesus who was without sin and he was praying without sin or without ceasing it was consecrated look at brother branham even in the video he was living a life of consequences and here we are all of us we want the same way that god used by the random could you lose with you that god may use us also but are we consecrating ourselves like brother and i'm dead but are we taking time to meditate the word like brother branham did we know someone please contact us or are we consecrated more to other things the majority of our times we're doing other things god wants to bring us to maturity maturity and that maturity is in our consecration that maturity is in the word of god the promise my brother my sister [Music] it's because he had known us from before the foundation of the world if god spoke if god spoke to us tonight because he knows that he knows us that he took our place and his place has been made available so that every single one of us will take it there's enough place for all of us and christ is calling us to it [Music] father through the words that were spoken you spoke to us [Music] that before the foundation of the world [Music] you protested [Music] when we heard this message [Music] and because you justified us father through sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit you're bringing us into adoption to glorify us [Music] [Music] the whole being was subject to the word god says don't you swallow father like in this end times you did the same thing through your prophet we believe that every single one of his children i believe that every single one of us can come forward and claim the promise and you that made jesus let me quicken the body of my sister that it may quicken my body oh let's do it at any moment let us be in your image let's let that arrest some blood let us be in your resemblance [Music] we believe that the world will see the manifestation of sons and daughters we believe that through our lives that people around us may be able to see you jesus christ that wherever we go that they may see jesus christ you promised to do give us your grace in all things bless once again this church in the name of the lord jesus amen [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is all to jesus [Music] him [Music] is oh [Music] to jesus [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] i surrendered [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] i oh is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] the price was paid all we could do is just accept what he's done for us we can give ourselves to him and let him be manifested amen we're gonna call buddy david to come and dismiss us tonight don't forget the youth meeting meetings are starting on friday as brother matthew announced it so everybody is invited here at the church on friday night saturday night and sunday night and sunday morning and sunday night so the friday this saturday morning is only reserved to the for the youth at the bedford location so it's only going to be for the youth so we're certainly excited i don't know about you you know the more you live the more you realize that the more of god you need you want to dwell in that presence forever you want him to continually just change us amen [Music] amen when that a wonderful message you know just to share a little light on it brother paul i thought it was marvelous marvelous if you caught it tonight you caught the difference between the quickening of your mortal body and the change of your mortal there are two different things we always think quickening and we think it's a future event instead of realizing it's a present it's a present tense event amen so if you let that set in your heart tonight it'll make this message more real to you what the prophet of god said the quickening power brings this mortal body into subjection but if this body be dissolved we've got one wait for it what would this body be doing if it wasn't for that quickening power god forbid we can't even talk about it but amen marvelous word of god tonight marvelous let us just bow our heads together our gracious heavenly father lord we have heard tonight about a power that had been purchased for us and waved over us that we too may be quickened and father that we too may mature and father i believe this body is part of that great harvest that you've accepted and lord i come before you tonight because we have a need and our precious friend and brother mike park senior lord he needs that word power that was preached tonight to go touch his mortal body father if he was spiritually sick we would ask that you would save him lord if he was lost we would ask that you would find him lord if he was discouraged we'd ask that you would lift him up but lord he's in dire need of your healing touch and father when all
