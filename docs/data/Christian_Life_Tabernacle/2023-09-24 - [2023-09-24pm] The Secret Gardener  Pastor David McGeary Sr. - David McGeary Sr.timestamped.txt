[12:36] [Music]
[12:43] good to be back in the house of God Amen
[12:49] amen
[12:49] [Music]
[13:00] um
[13:03] I'm going to pray
[13:05] but uh
[13:07] sometimes you have to say what's on your
[13:09] heart first
[13:13] I'm so glad to see you here tonight
[13:19] we should have a desire to be in the
[13:21] house of God
[13:22] it should be our desire
[13:25] and so often we hear messages from the
[13:27] pulpit that encourage us to do more and
[13:31] be more
[13:32] and some people just don't get it
[13:36] um
[13:39] but this is it
[13:41] I mean all that this is going to be on
[13:43] the test
[13:45] so
[13:46] if you want to pass the test
[13:49] you need to be found faithful in the
[13:51] house of God
[13:53] you need to be found doing the things
[13:54] that God requires to do
[13:57] I've only been here like a couple of
[13:59] years and
[14:01] I probably offended somebody and if I
[14:05] have forgive me
[14:07] of
[14:08] I love all of you and if I did it I did
[14:12] it
[14:12] not willingly but
[14:15] every now and then I slip and fall and I
[14:18] say and I do the wrong things
[14:21] but I love you
[14:23] and I pray that we would be a church
[14:25] that God is calling for in this last day
[14:29] we need to have a burden for something
[14:32] you know if
[14:34] like brother Birmingham said if not for
[14:36] a man hey find a dog or a cat to love
[14:38] but you need to have a burden for
[14:39] something and once God places that
[14:42] burden on your heart
[14:46] you'll do so much better because you'll
[14:48] forget about yourself
[14:50] and you'll look for the needs of others
[14:53] let us look to God In Prayer
[14:55] Heavenly Father we come tonight Lord God
[14:58] in the precious name of Jesus we want to
[15:01] thank you this morning Lord God for the
[15:04] message that we heard Lord God that
[15:06] encouraged our souls to be more than
[15:09] what we are
[15:10] so many of us Lord God are just going
[15:14] through the motions of serving God
[15:18] but we need to be the bride that Jesus
[15:20] Christ is calling for in this last day
[15:23] we have friends and family members and
[15:26] co-workers that depend on us to pray
[15:30] depending on us to live a better life
[15:33] because they're unable to serve God in
[15:35] any capacity
[15:37] but we pray and ask even now Lord God
[15:40] that you would just
[15:42] look down from heaven
[15:44] and look beyond our faults and and find
[15:47] our needs
[15:50] help us to hear the messages that have
[15:52] come across this bullpit to encourage us
[15:55] to be faithful and to be on time
[15:59] and to have a burden for one another
[16:02] Lord God continues to bless the pastor
[16:05] and the efforts of this congregation
[16:08] and I pray that Sunday mornings and
[16:10] Sunday nights would be the same
[16:12] that somebody would have to find a place
[16:15] to sit
[16:16] and that the Overflow would be full
[16:19] Lord God we want your house to be filled
[16:22] we pray in Us in the name of Jesus you
[16:25] told us to go out into the highways and
[16:27] to the byways and to compel them to come
[16:30] that my house
[16:32] might be full we want to say we love you
[16:35] tonight and we want to say we love one
[16:38] another
[16:39] oh Lord God help us to be more than what
[16:43] we are for us in Jesus name we pray
[16:51] I guess I'll say it's good to be in the
[16:53] hearts of God
[16:54] amen God bless you may have your seats
[16:56] amen oh there are people almost
[17:01] everywhere those hearts are all aflame a

[39:43] we ask you to bless us now in Jesus name
[39:46] we pray amen
[39:49] amen
[39:50] let's just turn our Bibles this evening
[39:53] let's just read one little scripture
[39:55] then we'll refer to more but this is in
[39:59] in Matthew
[40:01] the 24th chapter
[40:04] and the 35th verse
[40:09] and the minute you see it you'll say oh
[40:12] I knew that
[40:14] right
[40:15] all right it says Heaven and Earth
[40:19] shall pass away but my words shall not
[40:23] pass away father we ask you to bless
[40:26] your word to us this evening in Jesus
[40:29] precious name we pray amen amen God
[40:33] bless you may be seated this evening
[40:35] we we certainly won't be long tonight we
[40:39] all hope you enjoyed them sermon this
[40:42] morning from our brother from Cameroon
[40:45] and and uh encourages you to be fruitful
[40:51] and uh
[40:52] and I want to talk about that
[40:55] from another side of it
[40:59] because I think we all want to be
[41:01] fruitful I think we all want to do
[41:04] something for the kingdom of God
[41:06] but I've I've had this little message on
[41:09] my heart and it says sermon title I've
[41:12] always kind of wanted to preach
[41:15] um
[41:16] and it just is something that's
[41:20] comforted me
[41:21] through the years and I call it the
[41:25] secret gardener
[41:28] the the secret gardener and and so we we
[41:32] want to approach it and and we're going
[41:36] to read a few scriptures
[41:38] but when we we speak about it much
[41:42] about us being the seed of God
[41:47] and we know the scripture talks to us
[41:50] and refers to us as being the the seed
[41:54] of God the that we have that seed of God
[41:59] in our heart that the sower went forth
[42:02] and he planted a seed a much through the
[42:06] scripture is uh spoken about the the the
[42:12] harvest and the sowing and the reaping
[42:17] and uh and it it brings to us the
[42:23] realization that if we could place
[42:26] ourself in the picture
[42:29] and understand
[42:31] uh the what's transpiring even in our
[42:35] lives that in our lives we have a secret
[42:40] gardener
[42:41] and so when God planted a seed and you
[42:45] know you are the seed that was planted
[42:48] and the seed that was planted he planted
[42:52] it with an intention so the seed that's
[42:55] planted is planted with the intention of
[43:00] the planter
[43:01] so if if you're going to sow a seed or
[43:06] have a garden or plant a seed
[43:11] it wouldn't be just random uh you might
[43:16] plant a seed not knowing what it is
[43:19] but that really wouldn't make you a
[43:22] gardener or a husbandry you know what I
[43:26] made I like riding around with Matthew
[43:29] and saying what kind of tree is that
[43:31] what kind of trees that and you know
[43:34] he'll say that's a sick Sycamore and I
[43:38] said is that the name of the tree no
[43:40] it's a sycamore that's sick or you know
[43:43] it's this kind of tree it's a plum tree
[43:46] he he knows the trees because uh so a
[43:52] husbandry somebody that's a planner
[43:55] that's a gardener when he plants a seed
[43:59] he he doesn't plant it to see what it is
[44:03] what kind of seed is this so I'm just
[44:06] going to plant the seed and see what
[44:09] comes up if that would be the case then
[44:13] he wouldn't know what he planted next to
[44:16] what
[44:17] but we know that the scripture tells us
[44:20] in the parable that the master planted
[44:24] good seed
[44:27] and the enemy came in
[44:30] and he sowed
[44:32] other seed
[44:33] and then they came back to him and said
[44:36] master I thought you sowed good seed so
[44:40] the master knows what seed that he sows
[44:44] and he knows the intention for what that
[44:48] he sowed it
[44:50] now
[44:53] sometimes we don't know that
[44:57] okay so this is what I I want I
[45:01] sometimes I see people get so anxious or
[45:04] or so full of anxiety that they they
[45:08] don't feel they're doing anything for
[45:11] God or they they don't uh
[45:14] they they don't quite know where they
[45:16] are or or they're they're they they
[45:20] don't know how to judge themselves you
[45:23] know to determine whether or not I'm in
[45:27] heaven or not and I always think of that
[45:30] little lady that that the program tells
[45:34] the story about that work on the ranch
[45:36] she said he said the closer that he got
[45:39] to her the more unworthy
[45:43] she felt
[45:44] but the closer he got to her the more
[45:47] that was what he desired and she didn't
[45:51] see no Beauty in herself she didn't see
[45:54] no character
[45:55] in herself but but there was a humility
[45:59] about her and a graciousness about her
[46:03] and and diligence about her and a
[46:07] persuasion about her that this Rancher's
[46:11] son thought that's that's what I'm
[46:14] looking for
[46:15] and so we we will have that tendency and
[46:19] we'll feel that way many times about
[46:22] ourselves but yet God planted the seed
[46:27] and he planted it with an intention
[46:30] and the the fact that the enemy has come
[46:33] in and and we know it's so bad seed and
[46:38] it so tears and many times we see those
[46:42] tares growing up all around us uh our
[46:46] Prophet even preached a message about
[46:49] how these tares reach out and they try
[46:52] to deform us and they try to pull us and
[46:56] pull us aside and uh and even in that
[47:00] sermon I think many times people missed
[47:04] so much of what the messenger was trying
[47:06] to tell him he was trying to tell them
[47:09] you know all these tares and all these
[47:11] doctrines is deforming the church it's
[47:14] making the church into something that
[47:17] it's really not it's pulled him from
[47:19] this side to that side but yet there he
[47:22] was standing the secret gardener
[47:26] and that's what the gardener does the
[47:29] gardener Roots up the tares it it it it
[47:32] it
[47:33] takes care of the seed if it if it's it
[47:38] looks out after it and and nourishes it
[47:42] and takes care of it so let's just look
[47:45] at a script a few scriptures tonight and
[47:48] let's look in first Corinthians
[47:50] 3 7-9
[47:58] I'll be hearing First Corinthians 3.
[48:02] [Music]
[48:03] um
[48:07] see if I have it here
[48:11] do I get it yeah three seven and nine
[48:13] see if I over here
[48:18] no that's not what it is
[48:20] oh well
[48:22] let me know
[48:23] all right oh no it is seven and nine
[48:26] okay I was looking in two okay here it
[48:30] says three it says
[48:32] he says I have planted an Apollos
[48:37] watereth but God giveth the increase
[48:42] so then neither is he that planteth
[48:45] anything
[48:46] neither he that watereth but God gives
[48:52] the increase
[48:54] now he that planet and he that watereth
[48:57] are one
[48:59] every man shall receive his own reward
[49:02] according to his own labor
[49:05] for we are laborers together
[49:08] with God and ye are God's husbandry ye
[49:14] are God's Building
[49:16] and and I think this gives us a great
[49:20] comfort because he says you are God's
[49:23] husbandry in other words you're the god
[49:26] you're the seed that God's planted okay
[49:29] one might water it one might do it but
[49:32] it's God's job he's the husband Tree
[49:36] he's the secret Gardener that is going
[49:39] to do and take care of your life and
[49:43] mold your life in and take care of the
[49:46] circumstances and deal with the
[49:49] situations in your life actually he can
[49:52] provide circumstances he can withdraw
[49:55] circumstances he can have challenges he
[50:00] can he can do all the things that he
[50:02] does secretly that we don't even know
[50:06] what's transpiring because he's a secret
[50:09] Gardener his ways are Beyond finding out
[50:13] he works in mysterious ways but our
[50:16] comfort is that he planning it
[50:20] and if he planted it he planted it for a
[50:24] purpose and he's the one that that when
[50:28] he says you're his husband Tree you're
[50:30] his garden you're his seed your your
[50:33] he's going to take care of you he's
[50:37] going to get you to the place that and
[50:41] to the condition and to the fruits that
[50:45] he planted you for
[50:47] because he keeps secret and so many
[50:51] times we don't understand a lot of
[50:53] things that that goes on in our lives
[50:56] why did this happen why did that happen
[50:58] why did I you know meet this people why
[51:02] did I get in this business why did I
[51:04] waste that why I mean the questions are
[51:07] never ending
[51:09] you know what I mean and and you can't
[51:12] you can't figure all those things out
[51:16] I mean after the all the years that I've
[51:18] lived you know I'm not ancient but I've
[51:21] got a few years behind me I don't think
[51:24] I'm old yet I might be in middle age but
[51:28] uh
[51:30] how many things has he got me out of
[51:34] how many situations the things that I've
[51:37] gotten involved in and and he shut the
[51:40] door on it or he opened the door all
[51:44] things happening in my life that that I
[51:47] can't explain
[51:49] you know but yet they're driving me
[51:51] they're they're they're directing my
[51:55] path because the footsteps of the
[51:57] righteous are ordered by the Lord we
[52:00] don't feel we're righteous our
[52:01] righteousness into this filthy rags but
[52:05] he's deemed you
[52:07] you are saying he planted you
[52:10] that that's the beauty of part of it he
[52:13] knew the soil that he planted you in he
[52:17] knew everything about you and now he
[52:19] sits back as the secret gardener
[52:23] and he begins to weed your life he
[52:26] begins to fertilize your life he begins
[52:29] to do all kinds of mysterious things in
[52:32] your life things are happening to you
[52:34] that you don't know and if you find
[52:37] yourself from one place to the other and
[52:39] you don't know how you got there that's
[52:41] because there's been somebody working
[52:43] behind the scenes all the time
[52:48] and the Beautiful Thing
[52:50] about it is that
[52:53] he's not going to let it be barren
[52:57] or unfruitful
[52:59] now there are seeds that are planted
[53:01] that that aren't Barren and fruitful but
[53:05] not his garden
[53:08] because he can't fail
[53:11] he can do anything but fail
[53:14] took if he planted you and then you
[53:17] might look at your home situation you
[53:19] might look at this and that and all
[53:22] these things around you and it might try
[53:24] to raise a question in your heart and in
[53:28] your mind because you don't understand
[53:30] the circums the circumstances around you
[53:34] but if you know that there's a secret
[53:36] gardener
[53:38] there's somebody that's looking out
[53:40] after it he's taking care of it you
[53:43] might not know he's there but he's
[53:45] letting the he's opening the irrigation
[53:48] line and and he's throwing the he's
[53:51] fertilizing it in and he's killing the
[53:54] bugs and and the pesticides and putting
[53:57] the the different things out and he he
[54:00] sits over it and he's the one that gives
[54:03] it the increase
[54:04] because he's a secret gardener
[54:08] you may not you know I like the the what
[54:10] the brother brought out this morning
[54:11] many times we don't think about the fact
[54:13] that we've got a guardian angel
[54:17] you know and and he's The Gardener's
[54:20] helper
[54:22] you know so the when when we can sit
[54:25] back and and rest and know wait a minute
[54:30] I'm not the one that is bringing these
[54:35] fruits to pass
[54:37] they're not my fruit they're his fruit
[54:40] they're not the fruit of my labor
[54:42] they're the fruit of his labor
[54:44] to that that he's mindful of me he's
[54:48] mindful what he planted he's mindful of
[54:51] his intention even the scripture tells
[54:54] us that we're foreordained unto good
[54:56] works that we should walk in them well
[54:59] that's the work that he's taking care of
[55:01] that's the work that he's the husbandry
[55:03] of The Gardener of he's going to nourish
[55:07] it he's going to keep it he's going to
[55:09] prune it oh we don't like pruning
[55:14] but he'll he'll prune you to make you
[55:17] more fruitful
[55:18] he's not going to let you be barren
[55:21] you know don't don't don't don't let
[55:26] uh
[55:27] I I just can't say don't don't don't let
[55:30] fear choke you out that that's what he
[55:33] said when those guys that he gave him a
[55:36] talent and they wouldn't do nothing with
[55:38] it and he said man if he'd even have
[55:40] given it to
[55:41] exchanger you know what I mean but so if
[55:44] you could get to the place where you
[55:46] understand wait a minute this pressure
[55:49] isn't on me
[55:51] he's the husband Tree he's the one that
[55:55] gives the increase
[55:56] one might have told me I might have
[55:59] heard the gospel but when it comes to
[56:01] the husbandry of it when it comes to the
[56:04] increase of it my secret Gardener is
[56:08] what gives the increase how did you get
[56:10] here today tonight Brother David to
[56:13] stand right in this pulpit and just read
[56:15] these scriptures and have this few
[56:17] minutes of Fellowship he did
[56:21] he's the one that's guarding me he's the
[56:24] one that caught me out of California
[56:25] he's the one that put me through Montana
[56:28] he's the one that brought me through
[56:30] Arizona he's the one that brought me
[56:33] here
[56:34] and I don't know if this is my final
[56:36] stop
[56:39] you know what I mean but he does
[56:41] he knows where he wants to take me he
[56:43] knows what he wants to do with me and
[56:46] and he works in ways that I don't know
[56:51] because he Gardens in secret
[56:54] he's a secret Gardener He's doing things
[56:57] he's dealing with my heart he's dealing
[56:59] with my mind you know a lot of times you
[57:02] got to go through things to get stuff
[57:04] out of your head
[57:07] you know you get you got Junk up there
[57:11] and and you know he might have to drag
[57:14] you to the left or drag you to the right
[57:16] just to bring an understanding but
[57:19] nothing can pluck you out of the palm of
[57:21] his hand
[57:22] because you're his you're his garden
[57:26] you're his word
[57:29] you're what he spoke way in the
[57:32] beginning he spoke you're the name
[57:35] that's on the Lamb's Book of Life you're
[57:37] identified with that name that new name
[57:40] that he has for you you're you're
[57:42] identified with that name
[57:45] your fruits pure your your outcome is
[57:49] identified with the words that he spoke
[57:51] because heaven and earth will pass away
[57:53] but my words won't pass away and how
[57:56] many times we heard our messenger say
[57:58] you are the word of God you're what's
[58:01] been spoken all the scriptures are about
[58:04] you
[58:07] but you're the actual reality
[58:11] the word doesn't just set out here the
[58:13] words got to be made flesh all God's
[58:17] word is made flesh
[58:19] it's all real
[58:22] and and if he's he's trying to do
[58:25] anything for us he's trying to get us to
[58:28] the place that we understand wait a
[58:31] minute I I'm not running this boat
[58:37] it there I have a secret gardener
[58:41] I have one that comes in and plucks
[58:43] things in my life and puts things in my
[58:47] life he adds things to my soil you know
[58:51] he might he might put something next to
[58:54] me that well well cause me to struggle
[58:57] more for my survival
[59:01] you know he he he's he's marvelous at
[59:05] what he does but he's got a plan
[59:08] just think of him looking down on all of
[59:12] us tonight
[59:13] and knowing what we have need of
[59:16] before we ask
[59:18] knows all our troubles
[59:20] knows all our weaknesses those all our
[59:23] doubts knows all our secrets
[59:26] there's nothing hid from him
[59:28] he knows what you have need of even
[59:31] before you ask it
[59:32] I mean eventually you come around to
[59:35] asking it and but he's already got it on
[59:38] the way
[59:39] because because he's actually looks at
[59:43] us and I wanted we could use the
[59:46] terminology as a Shepherd but I I just
[59:49] thought of this secret gardener
[59:51] this one that's supplying every need
[59:55] that we have even when we don't know it
[59:59] he works in secret he's bringing us to
[1:00:03] something he's bringing us to a
[1:00:06] character he's bringing us to a place
[1:00:08] he's got to bring us to that thing what
[1:00:11] he planted for because he's the lord of
[1:00:14] the Harvest
[1:00:15] yes he's the lord of the Harvest he
[1:00:19] sends workers into the Harvest we know
[1:00:21] many parables about that but eventually
[1:00:23] the lord of the Harvest comes himself
[1:00:27] to take the to take the fruit of it
[1:00:31] and and we even know the parable he says
[1:00:34] that that they killed the servants and
[1:00:37] then they then he even sent his son but
[1:00:40] one time the lord of the Harvest the
[1:00:43] whose Harvest it is
[1:00:45] he comes to get the fruit of it
[1:00:49] amen and that that's what's so beautiful
[1:00:52] him being the lord of the Harvest it's
[1:00:55] like him being the judge jury and the
[1:00:59] attorney all at one
[1:01:02] he pleads this case he judges his case
[1:01:05] and he gives the judgment on it
[1:01:07] and that's what the secret Gardener is
[1:01:10] he he he's he's not going to lose
[1:01:14] he's not going to fail you
[1:01:17] you you're totally you you can become
[1:01:21] totally confused you can be full of
[1:01:24] doubt you can be full of discouragement
[1:01:26] you can have that's just spiritual aphis
[1:01:33] it's all it is you know what aphis is
[1:01:35] right I think I said it right anyway
[1:01:38] it's a little
[1:01:40] thing that eats on you
[1:01:42] we all got a lot of things that eat on
[1:01:45] us but don't forget the gardener
[1:01:49] he's been given charge of your soul
[1:01:53] Jesus was the kinsman redeemer
[1:01:57] he came he was so loved God so loved his
[1:02:00] children he so loved his garden he so
[1:02:04] loved the seed that he planted that he
[1:02:06] sent his only begotten son and he gave
[1:02:09] him charge over it and he's not going to
[1:02:12] fail
[1:02:14] because he's your Redeemer so he's going
[1:02:17] to secretly guard in your life he's
[1:02:20] going to secretly I I don't my
[1:02:23] vocabulary only has the this one word
[1:02:25] but manipulate your life
[1:02:30] I don't mind being manipulated by him I
[1:02:33] don't like being manipulated by others
[1:02:36] but if if he needs to do things to get
[1:02:38] me to where I need to be praise God
[1:02:42] you know what I mean he'll do it
[1:02:45] and he'll do it without me knowing it
[1:02:48] he'll do it in secret I'll make a
[1:02:51] transition all I used to feel this way
[1:02:53] and now I don't feel that way anymore I
[1:02:55] used to just like this person now I like
[1:02:58] him who's doing all that it's the secret
[1:03:01] gardener
[1:03:03] he's got control
[1:03:06] he's not going to lose a one
[1:03:09] that's what's so beautiful he is going
[1:03:11] to tend to his seed day and night
[1:03:16] we can read this the great scripture
[1:03:18] found in Luke the 13th chapter
[1:03:24] The Book of Luke
[1:03:29] and we see this same parable
[1:03:33] here unfolding him and Luke it says
[1:03:40] the few scriptures for that are
[1:03:43] tremendous scriptures I
[1:03:45] I've purpose in my heart someday to
[1:03:47] study 13 1-5 out in deeper text but he's
[1:03:52] as he spake
[1:03:55] also this Parable a certain man had a
[1:03:58] fig tree
[1:04:00] planted in his Vineyard
[1:04:03] and he came and sought fruit thereof
[1:04:07] and found none
[1:04:09] then said he unto the dresser of the
[1:04:12] vineyard behold these three years I'd
[1:04:16] come seek fruit on this fig tree and
[1:04:20] find none cut it down why cumberth it in
[1:04:25] the ground and he answered and said unto
[1:04:28] him Lord let it alone for a year also
[1:04:32] and I shall dig about it and dung it and
[1:04:36] if it bear fruit well if not then after
[1:04:40] that thou shalt cut it down and and we
[1:04:44] see that that that's what he does
[1:04:48] because that's what he is
[1:04:51] he said oh this this thing's is not
[1:04:54] fruitful you know I mean it's not
[1:04:56] bearing fruit it's not getting where he
[1:04:59] says we I he just doesn't chop it down
[1:05:02] no but he's gonna go it's his you know I
[1:05:05] mean it's his three this guy didn't want
[1:05:07] that tree to be Barren and unfruitful he
[1:05:10] didn't want that tree not to produce
[1:05:12] nothing he didn't want it just to have
[1:05:14] encumbered the land so he he if he
[1:05:18] didn't have faith
[1:05:21] that what that he was going to do to
[1:05:23] that tree would work he wouldn't have
[1:05:26] wasted his time
[1:05:29] he says let me have it then if it don't
[1:05:32] happen really what he's saying let me
[1:05:34] take care of it I'm the husbandry of it
[1:05:37] when you come back in a year you'll find
[1:05:40] fruit on it
[1:05:42] because he doesn't want you to be Barren
[1:05:45] and unfruitful
[1:05:47] and and our brother challenged us this
[1:05:50] morning about doing something for God
[1:05:52] about being being unfruitful well I want
[1:05:56] you to know if that's your heart's
[1:05:57] desire then there's a secret gardener
[1:06:02] that's going to go to work to bring that
[1:06:06] to pass and do whatever he has to do to
[1:06:10] make you fruitful
[1:06:13] we even know in the church age book he
[1:06:15] says sometimes God takes a vessel and
[1:06:18] he's got to completely break it down and
[1:06:21] remold it again and make it just the way
[1:06:24] that he wants it with nail scarred hands
[1:06:27] the chastisement is impeasable
[1:06:32] correction's not fun
[1:06:37] but the secret Gardener's there because
[1:06:39] he's going to get the result
[1:06:41] now I rest in that
[1:06:45] when I rest and I look in the mirror and
[1:06:47] I go oh no this guy there and that
[1:06:50] mirror is not going to make it I know
[1:06:53] there's somebody else
[1:06:55] I know there's a secret garden or
[1:06:57] somebody that's working behind the
[1:06:59] scenes that's working in ways that are
[1:07:02] unfindable that could do in mysterious
[1:07:05] ways with tender hands everything just
[1:07:09] come into path there's nothing happening
[1:07:11] in my life that doesn't have a purpose
[1:07:13] or an outcome
[1:07:16] sometimes it's a test
[1:07:19] if I fail
[1:07:21] he'll teach me what I need to know to
[1:07:24] pass it next time
[1:07:26] amen he's the husbandry
[1:07:29] he's the husbandry man he's going to
[1:07:32] give the increase
[1:07:34] well he might have someone preach a
[1:07:36] sermon he I might have someone sing a
[1:07:38] song he might have all these different
[1:07:40] things that that go on somebody at work
[1:07:43] speak yeah many many different ways that
[1:07:46] God talks but yet he's going to give the
[1:07:49] increase it's his crop it's his flock
[1:07:54] another great scripture I think is in
[1:07:57] Isaiah 27.
[1:08:01] I like this scripture
[1:08:16] he's and he speaks here he says just a
[1:08:19] short scripture but I love it it says
[1:08:21] the Lord do keep it
[1:08:23] I will water it every moment lest and he
[1:08:27] heard it I will keep it day it night and
[1:08:32] day that's what he promised he said I
[1:08:34] the Lord will watereth day and night
[1:08:37] I'll keep it
[1:08:39] he's he's he has purposed in himself
[1:08:44] not to fail
[1:08:46] amen he has purposed in himself when he
[1:08:49] planted Paul here on Earth there's Saul
[1:08:52] what did he plant him to be he planted
[1:08:55] him to be the prophet Messenger to the
[1:08:57] Gentile age
[1:08:59] and all of a sudden Paul's coming along
[1:09:01] doing everything totally contrary and
[1:09:04] all of a sudden the secret Gardener
[1:09:06] comes in and says hey it's hard to kick
[1:09:09] against the prick isn't it little rough
[1:09:12] this program you've gotten On's a little
[1:09:14] rough
[1:09:16] now I'm going to take you
[1:09:18] I'm going to take over I'm going to take
[1:09:21] over your life I'm going to start

[1:09:29] from on high I'm going to give you
[1:09:31] wisdom I'm going to give you determine
[1:09:33] I'm going to do it it's my work
[1:09:37] it's not your work it's The Gardener's
[1:09:40] work it's the secret Gardener's worth
[1:09:43] and you've got to know he's working in
[1:09:46] your life whether you know it or not
[1:09:49] because he said he would
[1:09:54] he's doing things

[1:10:01] we just get so
[1:10:04] you know where we've got to see
[1:10:06] everything we've got to touch everything
[1:10:08] we gotta smell everything we got to hear
[1:10:11] everything we got to feel everything
[1:10:15] but if you could know that the secret
[1:10:17] gardener
[1:10:19] wakes up with you
[1:10:22] goes to bed with you and watches over
[1:10:25] you at night
[1:10:28] he will turn your soil
[1:10:31] if he has to
[1:10:33] he will spray you with insecticide if he
[1:10:37] has to
[1:10:38] he will fertilize you like you've never
[1:10:41] been fertilized before if he have to but
[1:10:44] he will make you
[1:10:46] fruitful
[1:10:49] and he'll do it and you don't even know
[1:10:51] it
[1:10:52] and all of a sudden someday you got a
[1:10:55] whole complete different attitude and
[1:10:57] you don't even know how you got from A
[1:10:59] to B
[1:11:01] it was that Gardner
[1:11:03] working in your life weeding weeds out
[1:11:08] planting seeds you know somebody comes
[1:11:11] in your mind somewhere down your life's
[1:11:13] Road and they plant a big old seed there
[1:11:15] that secret Gardener goes to working
[1:11:18] sometimes it takes years
[1:11:21] but he'll get it out
[1:11:25] because he can't fail
[1:11:27] and he's a wonderful
[1:11:29] Gardener I like this because it closed
[1:11:33] this evening in
[1:11:36] and so I know that he'll water me day
[1:11:40] and night
[1:11:41] I know it's his good pleasure
[1:11:44] fear not little thought
[1:11:46] flock it's the father's good pleasure to
[1:11:50] give you the kingdom
[1:11:55] oh really
[1:11:57] I don't even know when it comes
[1:12:00] but there's somebody that does
[1:12:03] you know just if you could just settle
[1:12:06] that in your heart and understand that
[1:12:09] you have
[1:12:10] a secret gardener
[1:12:14] now why is he secret because he comes in
[1:12:16] when you don't know
[1:12:18] he said the spirits like the wind
[1:12:20] listeth you don't know where it comes or
[1:12:23] where it goes
[1:12:24] he's he if forgive my vocabulary but he
[1:12:29] does his own thing right
[1:12:31] that's what makes him Secret
[1:12:34] amen he he works in a realm that we
[1:12:37] can't see
[1:12:39] we can't touch we can't feel we talked
[1:12:42] about it the Supernatural and he's
[1:12:45] working but he's working to bring us
[1:12:48] you know our brother talked today I
[1:12:50] thought it was uh good he said well if I
[1:12:53] go out on the front porch and go to
[1:12:57] Cameroon
[1:12:58] you know I say well I'd like to see that
[1:13:00] you know like if I could put that
[1:13:03] offering in the building fun
[1:13:06] you know so
[1:13:08] but it
[1:13:10] it's the thought
[1:13:12] you understand when we understand that
[1:13:15] we have somebody that's trying to
[1:13:18] cultivate
[1:13:19] that faith in us
[1:13:24] you have somebody that's working on your
[1:13:28] behalf to cultivate that faith in you
[1:13:31] you want to see signs and wonders well
[1:13:35] you can't just go out and act and you
[1:13:38] know it's just like me saying oh I want
[1:13:39] to have faith to change this uh water
[1:13:43] into wine
[1:13:47] well can it be done
[1:13:50] yes
[1:13:52] do we have the power to do it
[1:13:55] we we do we have the power to go uh
[1:14:00] speak a world into existence and go live
[1:14:02] on it but there's a law that governs it
[1:14:06] you are said so so in in order for me
[1:14:10] ever to see that happen there's so many
[1:14:13] things The Gardener would have to do you
[1:14:15] have to put me in a situation where
[1:14:17] that's needful you know what I mean it
[1:14:19] wouldn't be for my own Glory it wouldn't
[1:14:22] be a show you know what I mean in fact
[1:14:24] it would be done in such a way that
[1:14:27] probably nobody had ever known and or
[1:14:29] seen it
[1:14:32] but he he would be the one
[1:14:35] that's gardening it that's orchestrating
[1:14:38] it that's bringing it the past that's
[1:14:40] cultivating it that because that's doing
[1:14:43] it so God's got this church
[1:14:46] that he planted
[1:14:48] that he has an intention for and he has
[1:14:51] a place that it wants to be he's got a
[1:14:54] power that he wants them to possess he's
[1:14:56] got a wisdom that Parts but Power apart
[1:14:59] from characters satanic so one of the
[1:15:02] first things he's got to do is he's got
[1:15:04] to cultivate the character
[1:15:09] he's got to Garden that he's got a
[1:15:13] husband tree that he's got to bring it
[1:15:15] and everything's perfect in his time
[1:15:19] and in a season
[1:15:22] and he's doing it
[1:15:24] and it's it's to know that
[1:15:27] is what's your comfort
[1:15:33] just to sit back sometime and find
[1:15:35] yourself in the middle of a storm and
[1:15:38] say oh

[1:15:49] palm of his hand
[1:15:52] but in his hand he will mold me and make
[1:15:56] me and convert me
