and david oh and can't you see i'm so i've happy [Applause] the word of the lord [Music] of my amen amen wasn't that wonderful singing amen i i i really like singing i mean i like to listen to singing i i pray someday i can sing there's an old song i liked a lot and it was called please let me join the choir i don't know some of you probably know that song huh but anyway you know one day he got in the choir and that that that was the glorious part of it let's turn in our bible to uh matthew the 11th chapter and we want to read the 28th and 29th verse and and we'll read here it says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light heavenly father we ask you to bless us in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated um i i you know when you listen um a lot of times certain messages things begin to stand out to you and we listen uh to the last portion of last sunday night of the message called what heiress doubt um and we just picked up that message from the third part of it but brother graham said that that message that uh what we read out of and and he will read the scripture when we play the first part of it in 1st kings 19 and it's the story about elijah going into the cave and we listened last week how that he listened the prophet of god was talking about the thunder this loud in everything he says but where's god in it and that's what we we wanted to emphasize last week that he he's he's not in the noise he's not in the thunder he's not in the lightning but he's in the still small void so in the midst of those great times when you feel the joy of the lord the excitement's moving in the church always have that ear inclined to what's god speaking to me and brother man makes this expression when he began to talk about that story he said it has three parts has the mount carmel the juniper tree and the cave and i i thought about that a lot and and i i realized that you know we're so prone in our lives as christians to push the mount carmel experience it almost to the point that uh and you know the great mount carmel experience you know the fire comes down consumes it you know elijah says let the god of heaven answer and you know and i mean it's it's it's just a a great victory and and we preach a lot and we emphasize a lot the great mount carmel experiences and we it's almost like we encourage ourselves to have a you know to be victorious and to uh uh uh uh we want a mountaintop experience you know we want victory and and signs and wonders and uh uh you know and and you know nothing to stand in our way and if we have faith and and you know and we can do all things and all that and we put so much emphasizes sometimes on the victorious mount carmel experience that we forget there's another side of it and if we could uh and and those are the times we have to get through it and so i'd like to uh uh play this to you tonight and as you uh you listen to it i i just think it's so real do you know what i mean and and um he's dealing i think really with our the what we actually really go through in life you know and it seems sometimes that our life has ups and downs and it's got great times and it's got other times that aren't so uh great and sometimes we can feel a little down and and if we can if we can understand those both sides of it and grow a little bit we we talk a little bit about that maturity that comes and i think this is a little statement of the things that are in here that will just uh it it helps you you know what i mean there's those little stones that you can put in your foundation and you can know i've got something that's holding me that's rock solid and you know leslie and i were coming back from uh lunch today and so you know what we preached this morning you know is that that god is is moving all that he has and all that he's offered the church it's it's ripening in every believer so when the grain is ripe it's all ripe it's all grain it's all full of him it's all full of life you know that we've come to the final stage where the very life of christ is in his bride and the bridegroom and the bride have an invisible union and they become one and she becomes one with the word and so when you when that starts to become a reality then you begin to see god in everybody and so we're driving up the street and we come around the corner and just fellowship and around the things and we look up the street and and we see some people up the street and uh uh and then leslie looks at me and she says it looks like there's a revival going on on our street and and there was we have a little lady in our neighborhood and she likes to get out and and jog a little and and a nice lady and and here david junior and the lamborghini are walking up the street together that's my nickname for him you know me and leslie just love him to death you know brother lambert so and and we look up the street and here's david and and that lady and brother lambert and they're all in the middle of the street praying you know and i don't know what she wanted to be prayed about and everything but it was like i thought praise god we're in the millennium you know what i mean neighbors praying on the street right in the street you know what i mean i'm surprised somebody didn't call the police and said that offends me you know what i mean they want to get rid of the bible in school they want to they've already done it i guess no prayer no nothing they had one a county or some courthouse they made them take the 10 commandments down out of the front of the courthouse because it offends somebody well you know what the word of god says right blessed is he who's not offended in me and i thought they're just out there praying with the neighbor lady you know right in the middle of the street i thought that was good that made me excited and so i i honestly played this this evening for you because this 35 minutes or so it's not terribly long but if you listen it's it's just full of statements and wisdom and understanding and that will will really bless you and and so i i guess i don't want to explain it i just want you to listen to it and it'll be a wonderful blessing so we're just going to start uh at the eighth paragraph just about seven minutes in and if you listen to the tape from the beginning brother branham had some young girls sing a special that he heard his daughter and i may have been the beeler girl i'm not sure playing at his house and but it it this tape is a wonderful tape and i'm sorry i broke it up into two parts and and i know people would think you should play the first part you know the second part second but i played the second part second and the first first and i tried to figure out a scripture for that so you know but i couldn't i know and i i don't know if you notice i know people have but i guess i had got something in my eye or something and it turned red but uh that's okay i i see just fine so anyway lord bless you i i really feel you'll enjoy this next thing and then if afterwards can we get done playing i know we didn't get to finish everybody's testimony last week but if someone else had a testimony they'd just like to testify maybe we'll just give a few minutes for another uh testimony amen god bless you i i really believe you'll enjoy this what hear us doubt uh god bless you mark uh first in 1959. god bless you glorious some years ago in england there was a man he thought he would go out and have a little friendly drink at christmas time just for fellowship and he went out among his neighbors and he was exchanging presents and everybody would say to him now john just take a drink of this and a little sip here and a little sip there and he got really intoxicated and on his road home there'd come a snow about six inches and and his little boy was following him he couldn't pack him he was too drunk and his armies rode home and he happened to turn around and notice his little boy just almost watering in the snow and he said son why are you uh watering in the snow he said daddy i'm trying to follow your footsteps and he picked the little lad up in his arms and said god from this day on i'll never take another drink somebody's going to follow your footsteps let's walk that straight line from the cradle to calvary that's the footsteps let's have them to walk in now i know tonight is communion night and i'll just have a short time to speak to you in the word i i love to talk about him because he's so real to me i was reading a little article sometime ago thinking back to the girls again it happened out in the west there was a one howling stormy night in the winds high and there was uh some had a prayer meeting and the one that led the prayer meeting was a very attractive little lady not thinking about the dangers she would be in but she lived kindly cater cornered across the little city and usually on the streets there was lots of people at that time of night when the prayer meeting closer songs had been to the lord and their hearts were happy and i guess all together they felt about like brother beeler did a while ago and he was testifying just so happy they couldn't contain the joy and just had to leave it roll out someway after the last amen had been said they all made their way to their homes and the little young lady picked up her coat and pulled a collar up and latched over the front of it and started down the street and she come to find out that the whole night had run everybody into their own fireplace and she found herself alone on the streets and it seems to be like a danger begin to haunt her you know i'm so glad that the holy spirit can warn us of things that's coming escape those dangers and she had never thought of being afraid and she just got to singing that old song no never alone and as she went all across the city seemed like no one was going to bother her but all of a sudden there rose that great fear again and she happened to look standing close and there stood a real hideous looking man looking right at her holding his arms out like this coming towards her there's no way to get away and it's a true story so she could not run he'd catch her there was only one thing to do she couldn't scream the winds was blowing so hard almost lifting her body from the street she'll never make anyone hear the snow just a blinding and there's only one thing to do that was pray so she began under her voice whispering a prayer to god and she said she never knew where it come from but all of a sudden by the side of the door stood a great big dog and he had his bristles up and he walked out to her side and come on the side which the man would be on and begin growling viciously as he passed on by the man and as soon as the man went on down the street the dog turned and went back and laid down in the door god will care for his own [Music] god sometimes he works through even a dog or an animal or some other way to show his glory and his protection amen i'm so happy that i know him in the forgiveness of my sins and with the assurance that my sins are under the blood as i confess them daily to him this morning in the message i might have seemed a little choppy or a little rude but not a very much of a text for uh a healing service but i've lived long enough to know this brother tony if a man will just do as he fails led to do god taking care of the rest of it in a master way [Applause] first time it ever happened like that year uh we usually give out prayer cards and stand up to people but the holy spirit had me to ask how many strangers was in the building which would cover it completely and then he made knowing to them their desires and pronounce their healings and so forth amen just goes to show that obedience is better than sacrifice hardening unto the and the fats of rams so tonight i've chosen a little scripture here for just a few moments to speak and before we do that let us bow our heads just a moment in prayer lord thou art god forevermore and we thank and praise thee for the privilege that we have of coming before thee in the way of prayer knowing this first that it is promised to us that if you asked anything in my name i'll do it and we have the assurance that you'll grant our request and there's been so much already done tonight that we feel that if we should just close the service and go home we could say it has been good to be here do you hear these songs of zion saying in the audience you hear the people as they give out their voices in prayer and in meditations and in hymns as the scripture says making mary in your heart singing spiritual songs do you hear these little teenage girls in this dark hour as it's been expressed tonight through our brother dealer that we're living in and to hear them sing the songs of zion hear brother bieler's expression to you how he appreciated you and what you had done and how that you crippled him up to let him realize what would he do without that arm now it just goes to show that we are protected by your grace and power let us all take heed tonight lord for i believe that it's time for us to take inventory checking up time for we don't know what time it's going to be checking out time it may be later than we think so let us consider our ways tonight and our thoughts and we pray that you'd speak to us for a few moments in the word that bless us in the communing service afterwards as we take the broken parts of this kosher bread and wine that represents your broken body and shed blood for the remission of our sins our most beloved pastor tonight wasn't feeling too well but in our telephone conversation he has placed it up on the altar i'm sure you'll receive it lord not further offer a prayer for him for we love him and we need him we pray for he and his family and for every family that's cheering for all the spoken requests tonight and the silent also bless us further in the meetings for we asked it in jesus name thy son amen i want to read just a little potion of scriptures here found in first kings 19 and beginning at the ninth verse and he came tether unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came unto him and said unto him what does thou hear elijah and he said i have been zealous or jealous for the lord god of host and far his children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slaying thy prophets with a sword and i even i alone am left and they seek my life to take it and he said go forth and stand up on the mount before the lord and behold the lord pass by and a great storm when went and rent the mountain and breaking pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what does thou hear elijah i want to take for a text for a few moments what does thou hear elijah had a hard day he'd been on mount carmel he had seen the glory of the lord come down he had prayed fire out of the heavens and and then prayed rain down upon the earth and under all this stream his nerves were about broken oh how i can feel for him and here we find him first preaching to a backslidden nation of people and to a jezebel that wanted her way and the people had come to a place that they had forsaken god forsook all of his promises and all of his commandments and no longer kept his statues and cared nothing faring and elijah in the midst of all of it he could not compromise he had to stand true to his convictions oh how that reflects in this day and they had a queen there by the name of jezebel and she had let all the children of israel astray with her modern fantastic way of living she'd cause them to commit fornications and to do evil things if that isn't a good parallel to the dean but elijah in the midst of it all yet many other children of israel thousands of them had compromised and wanted to live the modern trend of life yet elijah would not compromise he told jezebel her place and how she must do oh she hated that prophet but just the same she wouldn't claim him but he was her pastor all there's a lot of times they don't want to claim it but a god-sent man to a community is a pastor of the entire community whether he's baptist presbyterian or who it is god anoints his man and he will not compromise and the people sometimes hates him because he stands for truth but yet he's god's pastor for the hour oh she despised him she'd do anything she could to kill him but yet he was true to god's principles god's standards her modern parties and socials and her painting of her face and the wearing of her clothes had polluted that nation old elijah wasn't easy he told her right where she was standing god sent us some more elijah's in this day he'll not compromise with sin somebody who preached the truth no matter how bad it hurts god still got servants in every community that won't compromise with the things of the world elijah didn't like the modern trend of things so he stood true to god and the showdown came and the showdown has come again and elijah up on mount carmel when they thought that all the days of miracles were passed and there could not be nothing else like miracles there was one man who believed in it and he said bring up all your prophets bring them up here on the mountain and let's prove and see who's gone i love that scripture oh if there ever was a time in a place that the true power of god ought to be made manifest is today let's prove what's gone if education is the way out to freedom why don't it act if social standings and so forth is a way out why don't it act if paying other nations to be our buddies and we find out they turn heels against us just as soon as they can and you can't buy a friendship with money friendship is a gift of god if the great churches and great teachers is the way out why don't we have more god in our communities why is it we're on the constant move backwards if the educational program and the well-trained pulpit and the well-trained choir and constantly we get further away from god all the time then it won't work what's science done science you say the time will come when science can do this and do that what have they done they've brought us to a place until they're destroying the whole world what are they doing they're wrecking the world instead of making it better not long ago when captain al farar of the fbi over the juvenile parts of the united states had me in his office after i led him to christ down in the shooting gallery he said brother branham i'm a baptist i hear you as a baptist i said yes sir he said but i haven't got that holy ghost that you're talking about he said you think it'd be for me i said yes sir he said well i'll order a nice sweet somewhere in some nice hotel room and let you and i go up there and maybe he'll come to the hotel room and fill me with this spirit i said you don't have a hoe to have to have a hotel suite say well where would he meet me and i said right here he said he wouldn't come in this gallery would he a shooting galley here i said he went in the belly of a whale for one into a fiery furnace for another he'll meet you on any grounds that you'll meet him on amen god wants to meet you he wants to talk it over with you he'll come to where you are now jezebel had polluted the land and elijah and nerves have been on a strain and he had performed great miracles and done signs upon the hill to prove that god was still god and could answer in the way by a miracle and what did it bring the results of threat for his own life what did it bring instead of a universal revival that brought a threat to his life jezebel when ahab told her these things she said may the gods do to me and more too if i don't cut his head off for this time tomorrow night and elijah who was trying with a heart in him of god trying to show the people that god was still god and it backfired on him and he ran out into the wilderness when he heard it and there he laid under the juniper tree trying to find consolation he had sent his servant away and left him now our story goes in three different places one mount carmel the next under the juniper tree and the third place god meets him is in a cave and it's very strange pastor here knows and other ministers watch after you mount carmel's you're going to have a juniper tree whenever a man has a blessing and the power of god pours down and does something for you look out satan's on the track just remember the next day that monday after a good day on sunday it's going to be a hard thing because he's going to do everything he can to knock that confidence out of you that the holy spirit is still in you the day before so elijah had a big day and he's nervous anyhow all prophets are was declared insane jesus christ was declared insane every one of the apostles was declared insane by the public because their ministry was so supernatural until the people thought they were out of their minds everyone that lives godly in christ jesus will suffer persecutions you become a different person as brother bieler said about his sign in the back you become born again you become a new creature in christ old things have passed away the carnal things of the world has the war hold on you and you have no more halt on them when you pass from death unto life amen when god gets a hold of a man the first thing he does in a church is bring it from worldliness to holiness amen and he brings it from death unto life amen it's born again it's new its ideas are new what we need is a revival like that today really is true oh we've had a dip of the spirit we've had spiritual blessings and spiritual uprises but we don't need that no more we need a revival of the spirit of the living god in the hearts of the people we don't need so much of the dips of the spirit our spiritual awakening we need a revival let's revive what we've got not a spiritual awakening sometimes that causes mixed multitudes but we need a revive let us sift down shake down and i'll cut out all the things like standing by the seashore i was talking to some brethren over in puerto rico a few weeks ago that when i seen the great sea in a great storm the waves were higher than this tabernacle and i said you know what it hasn't got one more drop of water in it than when it's perfectly calm but what does that churning and jumping in what does it mean it throws all the trash out of it upon the bank that's what the church needs is a revival to shake from it all the worldliness and the things of the world and bring back purity and holiness of god in the hearts of its believers humility one man this suit is something that don't get a revival once in a while their spirit they become so carnal and so indifferent until they get self-styled starchy self-righteous they read and study and that's good but that ain't the thing we're talking about you know more about the word it's good to know the word but it's better to know the author of the word see that little something that you leave out that's something in the heart that makes you what you are that's the thing i tell you elijah and his nerves on the age anyhow i always felt sorry for him his nerves is about ready to break anyhow and that great pound from jezebel finished the stroke then he run went into the wilderness and laid under the juniper tree oh that experience of the juniper tree there's many of us find ourselves under the juniper tree i get myself under there many times to a place that you don't know what to do you're flustered frankly i'm right under it now and wondering oh god what would you have me do you know people under the juniper tree is like elijah they like to sleep i i preach to more tired people than anybody in the world people are so tired they they they're so mentally strained until they're filling the insane institutions and hospitals everywhere they're one in such a nervous condition until they don't know what they do believe in what they want they're just laying there they don't know what to do oh it's such a sad sight listen here my brother you can't drink it off you can't shout it off neither can you play cards till it's dull and you could take a thousand siestas and try to sleep it off and you can't do it amen all of our little remedies only thing it does is help the symptoms we've got to have a cure for the disease we got to have all the psychiatrists in the world cannot cure it it only helps the symptoms the cure is in the blood of jesus christ not take a rest at the seashore not go get a anthem uh choirs to sing anthems that's what we're trying to do today sing it off oh we'll make ourselves like the joneses and we're we're trying to do something different trying to educate it out there's only one way to do that face the facts that's right oh if you're upset and frustrated don't your church come to christ hallelujah that's the only remedy don't apply and turn a new page just get a new life christ is the answer amen very late under the juniper tree he didn't know what to do his nerves was broke he was shaking he was crying no doubt and he was in a terrible condition many of us hit those places especially after a mount carmel experience that's the me the other day by someone about that and how what would we what can we be done and what can be done for us at that time there's only one thing to do commit yourself to god amen now i know that a man can overwork and himself man could underwork himself a man god knowed this man need feeding he needed something to eat and honor this place here where he was laying god had to do something for him god has to do something for every man that comes under the juniper tree or he'll go to pieces he has to do it if his servant's laying another tree yonder don't know what to do he's carried out his commission elijah said oh lord let me die i've had those feelings after come out of a meeting and look like i tried and preached and begged and persuaded seen the angel of god sweep to a meeting and do signs and wonders and sit in a car on the outside in your gosh i wasn't in the psychology there's nothing to it not under that that's all nonsense oh then i'll crawl under the juniper tree i think lord what did you what'd you let me do it for what can it be done but we all hit those experiences but the mercy of jehovah to his servant god knows your trials just know this he knows all about it so he comes down he knows his servant needs some rest so he just puts him to sleep for a little while while he's laying there waiting to recuperate her praying to die lord my father's died before me and now take my life i've done done enough i've fought a good fight i've finished the course but there was work to be done yet god wasn't through with his prophet he still had work no matter how much we cry out and think this that other nothing can take us until god is finished with us i'm so glad to know that sometimes you feel like as i did one time put a pistol against my head to commit suicide but i couldn't do it i took my glove off the lead on a high voltage line where i was working but i couldn't do it something still helped the same god that was with elijah that same god today you see me under the juniper tree my wife and baby laying here in the grave and my daddy and my brother and i oh i was just about gone myself i've later the juniper tree it's hard i got to a place i saw beside myself i'll try to make a gun shoot my brains out and it wouldn't do it see there's work yet to be done something has to be done god wasn't finished he'll always take care of you poor tired weary servant he saw him he knowed where he was he knows where you're at tonight you may be under a juniper tree everything's gone but remember he knows where you're at we don't need a whole lot of re-fix it up like the old colored woman sat down in the south she had an accident a card hit her and it was it hurt her pretty bad and the lawyer said you want to sue for damages she said lossy mercy no honey so that has enough damage i want some repair and i think she spoke well for this community in this church tonight in this hell bound america amen it ain't backslidden it's already gone it ain't it ain't on its road to hell it's already met hell it ain't lost going to be lost it's already lost it doesn't need a sue for damages it needs a repair a truth he knows where you are he knows where you're land and he sent an angel and the angel touched him and he went to sleep and when he woke up there was some corn cakes or some kind of cakes baked lamb with the side of him and he said elijah rise up and eat there's a grace of god to his servant see he's resting him you know jesus said come aside into the wilderness and let's rest a little while some of these guys that think you don't have to rest we find out they burn out pretty quick too they don't think arrests they find themselves wrecked up somewhere i think that's where our brother billy grimm is tonight kind over shoot the mark these human bodies are strong but they need rest then you can take a little rest and go somewhere they'll criticize you say i thought he's a preacher look at him out on the bank fishing or something like that but that doesn't matter jehovah will take care of his own while he was laying there under the tree weary and upset god quietened his nerves he fed him woke him up again and fed him again and put him back to sleep you know i've often wondered what was in those cakes what kind of a vitamin did he get in those cakes however whatever there was in there it lasted him 40 days and 40 nights he went in the strength of those cakes god knows tonight i need some of them and i'm sure that this church needs some of them come aside away from the world and let's rest around let's talk a while you don't have time to rest you say john wesley said that one time he said i'm afraid to rest i ain't got time to rest and you find yourself broke up if you don't take these rests that's where we started from so it gets it's good as you know from last time you know there's little words of wisdom and and when you listen to a tape you know it's it's so important sometimes just to listen to every little statement and you know that he he said that if you have a a mount carmel experience you just better be ready for the juniper trees coming you know when you feel on top of the mountain and you feel everything's going good he said watch out you're going to find yourself under a juniper tree and you know sometimes we if we take that as being something that is uh a negative or wrong that we did something wrong but there's a purpose for it there there's a reason for it because when he went when he went there under that juniper tree if you know eventually it caused them to go to the cave and hear from god you know but he also says something that i i took he said you know you've got to have rest he said you can overwork he said you can underwork too but he said you can overwork and he says and you've got to rest and you know that rest is if you when you begin to talk about it he says you've got to get alone and you've got to just quiet your spirit just rest you know someone that's always you know carrying on they've always got to say something they've always got to talk they've always got to have the amen they've always got to shout you you find out really uh it's those that maybe don't have that deep experience you know what i mean because they they just haven't got alone with the lord and found that peace they're like whistling in a graveyard you know what i mean they need and that's what he's saying you need to get to that place where you rest and and he calms your nerves and you you you spend that time alone with them and you rest your spirit and you get away from all the uh the the trials and er and all under the juniper tree said he he got in that juniper tree he got in that condition where he just had such a great experience did you hear the prophet of god he said i come out of those meetings and i do all those things and then i'd sit there in the car crying say it's a bunch of nonsense you understand so i mean if you don't understand that in your lives that it's not always a mountaintop it's not always a victory every day if you're a christian you're going to find yourself under those juniper trees you're going to have those experiences but what did he said god knows where you're at he knows what's he trying to do he's trying to get you to get you to rest get you just to be still and know that i'm god get you to a place where you can what listen brother man preaches a message called hear ye him and he says you know we do all the talking and we never listen we we do all the saying we do all the we do all the carrying on and the and and going going going you know we get excited about something and god's moving and we talk and talk and talk about it and then if we're not careful all of a sudden it seems like the wind's gone out of the sail he's still god you're still on the sea he said remember the ocean it was all in the upward he says for there's not one more ounce of water in that ocean than there was when it was going through the revival there's not one less god in you when you're under the juniper tree as there is in you when you're on the mountaintop it's not measured by that he say even in that tape he said it's measured by the heart that's inside of you and you know so that when you come to these places and and you realize that it's not it it's not always trying to climb to that mountaintop it's not always trying to climb up there to that victory it's not always trying to press that we don't have to preach to you every time to try to get on a mountaintop we don't have to preach to try to get up to to have some experience but what we want to know is we want to come to that place where we know when we're down in the valley that god's in the valley with us he knows where we're at he's got a purpose and everything he allows and everything he's done he's just not on the mountain he's in the valleys too he's under the juniper trees and and you know what he does was is he leads you to a cave that's what he said there was three parts to it the mountaintop experience that we all have and he says after that you better be ready because if you have a mountaintop experience you better be ready for a juniper tree you better be ready for to find yourself down in the dumps and to find yourself with a letdown and to find yourself back to the reality that you're just a human being especially when god moves through you and you know it's god and and you you say things and you feel that anointing and the power of god and you just feel like boy i just testified and i prayed for somebody and they got healed and and i led someone to the lord and we baptized them and all those things don't be don't get shocked when you hit a desert spot or you hit a dry spell don't let that throw you don't go running and trying to find another mountain he's there with you under the juniper tree you know you don't have to look at la we don't have to say okay we better beat it up again we better get another meeting here we better get something else going on it doesn't matter praise god for the mountaintops but you know god he's got a reason that he doesn't let a person stay up there all the time you know why because they get to thinking it's themselves they get to thinking that they're the ones that's doing it and they're the ones that's got the power and they're the ones that are chosen and elected it's all by grace but it's all by grace all by mercy and so when we find ourselves down it doesn't make us any less of a preacher doesn't make us any less a believer it doesn't mean that we love him any less he does it that way because he wants to get us to a cave he wants to feed us those cakes give us some more word give us some deeper understanding give us some things the prophet of god said sometimes we go through these schools of suffering so we know how other people feel you know you go through the ups and the downs so when you see the ups and the downs you're not you're not worried about things you're not moved about things people that have been in this message brother gary's probably been in the message longer in any of us in here but here how many things are we some coming down the river how many different movements were going to take us there how many different doctrines was going to be the answer how many great exciting revivals did we see spin through the land that this is it this is it this is what we've got to have this is the revelation we've seen so many mountaintops that that's the only place we think god is when you're when you're into that juniper tree you can have as much fellowship with god as you can anytime like he said brother beeler i from what i gather he must have had something done hurt his arm in some way and and and he was rejoicing that god uh showed him what life would be like without that arm and and things like that see there's wonderful things that come anyplace in your life because he knows where you are he knows how to talk to you he knows how to speak to you he's not forsaking you or left you because your things have not gone the way that we think they ought to but we see what he's always going to do he's always going to press us into that place to that cave where we seek his face and he's always got a still small voice for us when we don't know what to do or we seem to not know what's going on just remember he's still the god of the mountain it's still god in the valley they sing that song i i like so much you know no matter where i am he's god no matter where i am you know the song i'm trying to talk about about in the storm he's the god of the storm i mean that's the kind of god he is that that's what we've got to know and i i think that that it's that solid steady person you know i like to see a guy that's got some years behind him you know what i mean that that that year after year after year after year he's just trying to serve god through in and outs and through struggles okay i don't know if you guys ever used the phrase but we used to use it out when i was in electrical doing electrical work we call them johnny come lately you know what i mean all of a sudden there you know they they ain't they ain't pulled enough wire to know what it's like you know they ain't pulled no 500 mcm they ain't pulled no 250 mcm you know i mean they've drug a few number 10s around a few places you know what i mean and they built built bent a few offset 90s and you know poked a few knockouts out of a box and my goodness here comes john electrician you know i mean he johnny come lately you know he framed one two by four wall one time and he's a carpenter no you like someone that's been through the storm you know what i mean they're not up one year and down the next year and up another year and they're on top of the mountain this year you know i like to see a guy be steady stay with it have five six seven years under their belt that's the guy i want to see here say amen that's the god that i want to know he's been through the valleys he's been through the he's been through the trials he's been through he's been in the cave and he's heard god talk to him that's where character is that's what you're going to take with you we don't always take the mountain top experiences you know if it's sometimes it's i like it when we i've heard the testimonies last week you know i was down and i cried out and god heard me you know it's not always doesn't have to be i did this and i did that and i did this and i did that okay and everything you know a real testimony is not what you've done for god anyway it's what god's done for you that that's a real testimony that that's really so don't don't don't worry some of some of you have been under the juniper maybe you've been under there for a while maybe there's sickness you've been under a while maybe there's financial struggles you've been under a while god still knows where you are amen he's got a still small voice coming for you if you'll just stay there if you'll stay true to them if you'll just stay there and and and prove it out for a while you know prove that you're back prove that this is the time prove this is for real you know let someone see you in the storm that's what the juniper tree is for that's what the storms are for so you can prove you're really who you are not who you say you are not how you describe your own experience i'm a believer be a believer you know what i mean that's why they're there they're there to give you an opportunity to prove that you stick with it through through thick and thin kind of like a marriage valve you know for better for worse well you took that vow don't think you're only going to get the better i know exactly what that bow means for better for worse i got the better leslie got the worst work worked out perfect for me i thought that was a pretty good vow i got the best part of that deal but that's why these things are there because where does character come from the fiery furnace of affliction and what's the only thing you're going to take with you is your character that which has been proven by testing and by trial peter said it this way thinking not strange that the fiery darts the enemy that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold so there's a lot of things in this tape tonight that you need rest you know you don't you you don't think you need rest now i'm just talking about sleeping you need to stop and rest and be still in the presence of the lord sometimes we struggle struggle to gain spiritual height to become more like god we read more we prayed more you hear him say he even said it you can study study and study but that's without what you need just to be still and know he's god just to know he knows your valley he knows your trouble he knows what's on your heart he knows what you've been crying out for he knows what tree you're under we all pack up some burden there's a cross that's that's a portion of suffering that's allotted to all of us all them that are godly in christ jesus shall suffer but it's there but he's still god and he still knows where you are and he still has an answer and and i'm telling you that that mountaintop experience i love them i i love them okay you know and and i know the ministers know it too and i know that now that the church is moving to where the laity is going to be doing the same signs and wonders that the preachers are doing that the laity is going to be winning souls to the lord just like the preachers win souls to the lord that the maturity is coming for every believer that they become in union with christ where the signs and wonders aren't following the minister they're following whosoever believes when we see people praying on the street out there like we saw today and you finally you've got to know the enemy is going to come right behind you and say you hypocrite who are you to be testifying who are you to be talking he's going to try to push you down in that juniper tree he's going to try to rob you what did he say he's going to rob you of all the confidence that you had on sunday be ready for the confidence robber that's what he is he breaks into your house like a thief and tries to steal everything away from you you go through those things if you know him and you you know and that's what he said how do you overcome you know it the satan at every one of his tricks so all what you say well what's the answer to it rest what was the answer to the juniper tree rest eat some cake glory amen take out you know take out the word of god take out your message take out something sit down steal your spirit until every faith pushed out you're not thinking it's just you and him alone and and come unto me all you that are heavy laden and i'll give you rest take my yoke upon you what's a yoke a yoke something that steers you and guides you put put my leadership on that's what he's saying come unto me your heaven put my leadership on sit down for a while be still let me talk to you let me speak to you let me humble you down and settle your spirit man wash yourself so you you go back to calvary because there's only one place he meets you that's under the shed blood go back to everything you have and i'll just be honest with you when i get all down and just totally uh tore up and i feel like i'm doing such a terrible job and and you know where's the persons that's supposed to be here you know what sometimes i just go sit in my living room and i just sit there a little bit and all of a sudden i see my house and and and i i know that god gave it to me you know what i mean and i go out and i got my truck and i think god i love this truck and i just think of all the good things and i just start thinking about him and pretty soon what it don't matter if the people hate me right he loves me it don't matter if if they criticize me and it doesn't matter if i'm feeling full of failures they're not my people anyway they're his people and then i just remember i'm not serving them for honor i'm not serving them for presidents i'm not supportive i'm serving them because i love them and i want to i want to i want to tell people the truth and pretty soon all the burdens go away and just a few moments in his presence and you're full of rest again and you're full of peace again you know and i like what brother branham said he said i preached to more tired people i preached the more snickering laughing teenagers than you could ever imagine more note writers and pencil dryers and yeah and thought wanderers but guess what he knows where every one of them is at and it's his duty and it's it's it's it's good and god's good so understand that because and i i want to say it like this you're all entering into the end time ministry because the last ministry on this earth is the bride the age ends and it becomes the bright age and the last one that ministers is the bride of the lord jesus and she lives with everything that's a part of it just like you kids at school you get one of your friends in the hallway and they open that door you tell them about the lord and you testify why you have long hair why you why you wear dresses what you believe you pour your heart out out to them and you can just feel like god's just standing inside of you well you're speaking in fact you you even feel like you're preaching to yourself that you just want to sit down and listen to yourself talk about the gospel things come out of your mind things come out of your heart that that you don't even know where they're come from you didn't even know you thought so good you didn't even know you could put it together so good you're just on you're on that mountaintop listen here friend i'm gonna tell you about the god that you don't know about you know what i mean and god did this and god did this and god sent a messenger and this is why we do this and we don't cut our hair but it's a nazarite balance and all of a sudden there you are and you say what did i just do what did i just say what are the consequences of this and and if you if you don't understand it that's when you get under that juniper tree and the best way to take care of it is you get to that cave that where he took him i took him to that cave to get some rest some eat some cakes to fortify you again that you can get that rest in that piece and you can sit there and says you know lord what i told my friend was the truth and i don't care what the consequences are renew me strengthen me because i believe this with all my heart and when you know how to handle it then you're more victorious than ever to be able to stand and to preach because you know he's coming after you but you know what it don't shake you a bit why because i have a cave i have a place i can run to i have a place i can hide i have a place in the storm where i have cakes that can feed me and renew me come unto me all you that are heavy laden and i'll give you rest amen i just i i was this tape just meant a lot to me personally and i i hope that it helps you and you can share it um with your loved ones because every now and then if you're in a marriage one of your partners will fall into the dump and you just gotta help them i mean i i can't help it but there's a dump there i don't know you guys ever used that turn terminology down in the dumps you know have you ever been to a dump it's a big hole in the ground full of trash of course nowadays there's so much trash it's become a mountain but nevertheless that's what it is and and but if you just go to the cave you know what you do you go to the cave with them and you rest and you wait on the lord you quiet your spirit too you eat those cakes too you create that atmosphere too and then pretty soon you walk out you put your mantle on and you're ready to hear from god again amen the lord bless you tonight amen i didn't know i just wanted to give an opportunity if anybody felt that they really wanted to testify last week and they didn't have an opportunity i i'd like to give the opportunity there if nobody has a testimony i i certainly understand that it's kind of right on the spot but anyway i i just like to testify that that i spend a lot of time under the juniper tree but he's dug me out of there a lot of times too and there's a lot of blessings in the cave did anybody don't want to testify that mr go ahead saints um i don't even know where to start so the lord put on my heart this scripture the the weekend we we had at the camp that we were out in louisiana there and the way the lord moved and spoke to me like never before it's in ezekiel chapter 37 he says the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold the shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when i beheld lo the sinews in the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came unto them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army then he says then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts cut off for our parts so the lord was speaking to me because sometimes i find we get in a condition where the devil says we're dead there's no hope there's no life there's no way to get out of it sermon that brother andrew spencer preached ain't no grave gonna hold my body down spoke so loud to me personally because seeing the condition uh this a lot of my club close friends and family are in that you know some some are in the grave some may be in a dead condition the devil may be whispering in my ear that oh well there's no hope for them does not even hope for you and whatnot but i heard here he said prophesied to these dead bones and they'll live i don't know if y'all read that but that's what i heard so in the next when i read when i read that and the minister was preaching i felt i was filled with so much joy and to see my sister there at the altar confirmed everything and then he says in chapter chapter 12 therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold all my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel the way the way this scripture was revealed to me is the grave is the condition you're in so you can be the grave could be the sin that's bothering you whether you're in drugs whether you're in lust whether whatever the condition you're in that's the grave you're in the lord says here that he'll take you out of that grave and i i was like lord you've done it over and over and over and over and over again but yet for some reason when a new grave presents itself something says can can god still do it can he still do it but he said he'd never leave me he'd never forsake me would he be with me even in me until the end i just want to give you all words of encouragement and let you know it doesn't matter what grave you're in doesn't matter what condition you're in doesn't matter how dry your loved ones may be the lord said son of man prophesy you know when our brother shared that it brought back to my mind real quick in that tape uh you know you you you get that impending doom there's one more thing out there that's going to get me remember that girl she was walking and all of a sudden she felt the dread she felt that through me she said all of a sudden this guy appeared he said but god provided a dog right and he uses things and what did he say he says he's your protector amen i like that brother because that's what we've got to believe we got to believe all things are possible anybody else wanted to testify and they didn't have a chance or they got a chance or that they would like to testify somebody knew you kelly you got here just bring her the mic that probably work just as easy here oh you got one okay great we'll do it that way and then make it simple and you can all crane your neck a little bit so um i just want to tell y'all uh we're you know really thankful to be here we um we are allowed now to um serve the lord with freedom and peace that we just have not known in all our lives we talk about it all the time when we share that with our sons our oldest boy we're like levi we we never we never had this we appreciate our pastor and how the word is so so pure so balanced anna the lord's brought us to a real place of peace so one day i was sitting in church and uh it's been it's been a month or so and um he dropped that scripture and thou has brought me into a large place and i knew i didn't think it so i thought oh that sounds like the word i go and find it it's a scripture where brother david said thou has brought me into a large place and i that's what he's done for us here so we had you know our son been uh decided he's gonna go wild and he got in trouble with cocaine and was telling us about it and i knew that the greatest thing i had was prayer and so i kept praying and praying and the last few weeks i just started praying lord just bring him home bring him home he needs to be home and uh i turned in a anonymous request in church here i knew if i could just get the prayer before the people because every single prayer request i've turned in has been answered so that was a thursday and i thought if i can just make it till sunday that you know get that prayer before the people and that was a sunday i turned it in and that night um brother david said it was sunday night and he said why don't we just you know sing a little while why we just entertained the lord and so we were singing a little while and my phone had a text pop up and i do look at it in case it was him and i got the text before i left the sanctuary mom i need to come home i need to get well i need i need to get off of cocaine i need to get myself straightened out well at this point he is trying to do it by himself but i'm still glad he's safe he's he's with us he's being cooperative and it's still a mighty answer to prayer that he's that we've got this part of the package [Music] anyway there's been brothers here that there's brothers that have spent years literally years hanging on for levi there's they have spent hours and hours of time of their life and i can't ever thank them enough there's brothers that spent money lots of money to you know to show love to my son there's um there's a brother that's driven many many many miles to amarillo too just to see levi just prayed lord let me go i just appreciate as a mother i appreciate that so much i we couldn't have imagined that it's greater than we could have asked or think um and so i just want to say the rest of my package is coming it's an absolute it because god promised it so many which aways there's no way around it it's the most secure thing as our children and you if you want to know which ways he promised it come ask me because i know the quotes i've studied the the verses and he promised it every which away that he could possibly say it levi is coming and that's a certainty and that's my testimony and in the meanwhile i'll wait i will wait because i ain't too good to wait on the lord i will wait for his time and i will be a blessing i we we only want to be a blessing here we we do love you all if there's anything we can do for anybody let us know we will do it and uh my that's my testimony is levi's home the rest is coming and we love jesus so much amen amen isn't that a promise he who starts at work we'll finish it till the end amen amen another testimony about probably six months ago it might have been less than that i don't remember the time or the day but we went out of town and i had antibiotics that the doctor prescribed that i i didn't take with me i had forgotten them and uh i told my wife on the way there i forgot my antibiotics you know and so i started having some discomfort and some pain on the trip there and i just i just gave it to the lord i told her i said it'll be fine you know i i believe that by the time we get there it'll be gone well it wasn't gone by the time we got there but by the time we got ready to drive home it was completely gone and then um we got back here and i had uh the sitting kind of got to me in my back and the long services and stuff and then we ended up helping you and it's just the grace of god because my back has been giving me a fit all week and then we got out there moving around and it went away you know and i had been praying about it and so just i give it to the lord because he he did two things for me in a short period of time and i just thank god for also my son and i know he's coming amen thank you so i hope you caught the lesson if any of your back pain or your down come work for me you know you'll feel better no i i know let me tell you tommy didn't tell you what he was doing but he was like lifting 60 pound blocks probably about 700 of them that we set on all that wall that in the back and i know the lord was with him because the wall's straight you know so it really was god really and i really thank him for all that he did to get in there and help so it was really wonderful somebody else have a a testimony we want sure they want to get caught mean i want to share a testimony i would probably sit here for hours to testify but we don't have hours so we're going to just take a few minutes um you know just like we heard last wednesday or last wednesday at the church services that um prayer meeting on tuesday was wonderful if you've never been i recommend you come but uh brother matthew had asked me to come to the prayer meeting and just to play the piano and i said okay so i get to the prayer meeting and i'm praying a little bit before i go up and um i'm going up and i'm starting to play and you know the presence of the lord came down and i believe is maybe around the time where even the sister that was given the testimony on wednesday that brother matthew read is maybe when it were around that time where she got the victory but you know i was playing a piano and you know a lot of the people that are musically and talented they probably know but you really can't pray and try to play a piano at the same time so my hard desire was to just worship the lord and the presence because it was is very wonderful so all of a sudden i start closing my eyes and um i i get in his presence so deep where i'm praying and i'm weeping and uh i'm not even realizing that i'm not concentrating to play the piano so i wasn't thinking about the next song i wasn't thinking about messing up i wasn't thinking about i i was just praying and i probably played for about five minutes where i i was just praying and i could say this i know it wasn't me because i i wasn't concentrating on playing anything so it had to have been him whatever that was i know it was supernatural but i was just i was just i was just praising him in in that peaceful still atmosphere where you just never wanted to leave and it was it was supernatural because i've been playing a piano ever since i was eight years old and i've never had that happen to me in my life so i'm just thankful and uh i don't know if this would be an encouragement to the church but brother david mentioned uh brother andre that he uh he was baptized yesterday and and um if he doesn't mind just sharing a few words just part of his testimony but you know the the presence of the lord was was really moving at the camp yesterday while we were ministering out there and and you know as as we were trying to talk to our brother andre just craziness was going around the camp and you know people were just arguing and you know that they were just trying to do a turmoil and uh we were sitting at the table just eating lunch and even there all that turmoil was going on but the presence of the lord was there and it was peace and it was that sweet atmosphere and that's when the lord spoke to him so brother andre if do you want to say a few words or okay so yeah i'm brother andre i am not a public speaker you know i am definitely not a public speaker but uh sometimes it calls for you to get out your comfort zone in order to grow in christ so i'm gonna go with what i'm asked to do so yeah i met these guys at the uh campground yesterday it's a place that i usually don't go and i'm gonna just say i ended up there by very extenuating circumstances um i had asked the lord to take me to a place where i can see him working you know what i'm saying and i ask him for a deliverance from something or the path to a deliverance from something and he presented that through the guys that were working at that camp yesterday they brought me to bedford know what i'm saying and um i was presented with something that i've never experienced with a church before and that's just absolute loving in care know what i'm saying i mean they showed me complete love they put me in a hotel last night you know i'm homeless don't have anywhere to stay so it's been kind of hard uh they fed me they brought me to church this morning and since i've been here i've just experienced nothing but love from each and every person that i've met shook hands with introduce themselves to him and i just like to say thank you that's how they know you're his disciples by your love for another keep up brother andre in prayer i mean he's well experienced he knows what the battle is ahead of him but now he's got a helper one that can do battle on his behalf and i believe he's going to have a total victorious life and that god's going to do wonderful things for him we can be confident of that amen appreciate that brother so much and god does love you the love that you feel from these people is just the love they got from the lord jesus and all they've done is they've shared his love as he loved them so does do they love you and that's where our love comes from amen we love him because he first loved us and anybody else have a testimony brother tim praise the lord as that brother said i'm not a very good public speaker either because when your heart's in your throat makes it tough to talk i'm turning to scripture in the book of acts and i don't really have to turn to it because i've heard it all my life probably more than anyone in here i can say i've been blessed with god all of you may not know my background when i was born into a message believe me home and family and if you know me i'm hard headed enough to know that that's the only way i can make it and if you also know me you know i like cake so i could use some some cake to sustain me but in the book of acts it says for in him we live and move and have our being and paul preached the resurrection of the lord jesus that's what led him to having his head cut off because he believed in and preached with fire conviction the resurrection and if we believe that and live that and minister that we're going to undergo the same persecution and in this life even the way people live now they believe some strange things they act out very strange things they live demonic lives in front of the public without reproach but i'm telling you if you live this message there will be a reproach and if we're without reproach something's wrong i was spending time with co-worker this past week i've had to go out of town quite a bit oklahoma city we have a plant up there in north little rock and there's just a very small crew in north little rock and one of the workers there it's been there about 18 or 20 years is also a pastor so we get to talk and break time and after work quite a lot of discussions and things and when you hear someone speaking out of love and conviction but yet it doesn't ring quite true to you you often want to interject the truth and you know they say politics and religion is not a very good thing to talk about at work but [Music] but when you hear a hearts cry you want to you want to respond to that and answer that so as it turns out we were talking about over in in john how and there was a difference in opinion but i believe there is a race of people or a dispensation of time to a certain people that god would not impute sin and it's a little confusing you read that it's like well if you say you haven't sinned you're a liar but who knows the mind of god and when he puts it in the sea of god's forgetfulness it's as if you never did it anyway so in god's eyes if god says you hadn't sinned then how can man call you a sinner but i believe church that's what true conversion is and as we continue to talk they think my you know you get basically you you go all the way back to the beginning and i expressed the truth of serpency and that's been a reproach i gladly bear that reproach and the times of and that was several years ago and when the time comes now we talk about things they're just a little cold reservation oh that's brother that's tim he believes you know such and such and you're looked at strangely it's okay we know the truth well this weekend the manager who's not the pastor by the way we were working hand in hand and we were discussing quite a few things and we were back in genesis again and how god created man in his own image and male and female created he them and god took the feminist spirit out of adam i was telling him these things he said wait a minute tim this sounds so like a sci-fi movie or something this is a script out of a sci-fi i said no kevin this is the greatest love story that's ever been told and brother sister we are the principal character in that love story over in the book of revelations 22 12 it says behold i come quickly and my reward is with me think of that we are his reward we had this machine that was it's a 1973 baler that just stopped working about three weeks ago during that time i also took vacation and it seems like when i go out everything's put on hold and i'm kind of the troubleshooter for the company and we're supposed to fix this machine of course the boss's boss and everybody's on the phone wanting to know why can't we fix this machine so i got to respond to it and usually in areas of maintenance or mechanical i can fix it this had a an old plc attached to it that had been added after the factory years later and it's kind of like when the brain shuts off you don't know what the brain says what the faults are and we had no data on this to fix it with and so we just tried to change it out put a new one in and things still didn't work well we had told everyone that this thing will be up on friday of course it was late on friday and it still wasn't working and we're about to call it quits and uh and kevin said let's just go over there and try it one more time so we went back and uh i made a couple little adjustments and it just started working and uh this is the same guy i was talking to that day at lunch trying to express the truth to him and he turns and looks at me and says tim you know that wasn't anything short of a miracle that that machine worked and i said that's true kevin so i pray that somehow i can be the right kind of influence you know you live your life uh you put your best foot forward you try to walk circumspectfully but young people you'll you like just as the old ones you're setting a pattern of good works if you follow the scriptures you know the seed that you sow is going to come to harvest and i believe it's harvest time and just as brother david said today he's talking about that's some of the very things i was talking to kevin about not knowing what he was going to preach how the seed had to go into the ground and die for it to come up okay the son of man jesus expressed himself to the jews as son of man he said when he went into the ground and died the son of god spanned the church ages he comes in three sons names we've been taught son of god our son of man son of god and son of david but at the end of that son of god ministry there's another coming of the son of man we are part of that that to me son of man because we talked about melchizedek and i asked kevin who was melchizedek i said that was god in the flesh the same way you and i are okay if you're tabernacling deity you're you're if god has children they're going to be gods right i don't want to take too much time but i just want to add my little two cents worth it's even worth that to say hey i'm behind the push to get out of here and but you know the last one may already be in they may already be in we're just waiting on the the cup of the amorites the wickedness and then we know we have plenty of that too so lord bless you keep you give us strength we pray what was the son of man ministry brother tim exactly god in flesh what's this bride going to be god in flesh that's the result of the son of man ministry and there wasn't one other ministry that could produce it amen it's the only ministry that can produce god in flesh and if that same spirit that was in jesus christ dwell in you it will also equip in your mortal body i i it just i just appreciate that so much because that's what he brought that's what paul preached was resurrection that's what brother branham brought was resurrection and he said i preached the same thing paul preached amen lord richly bless you i don't know 7 20 maybe we can fit one more testimony in before 7 30 does anybody else have a testimony davey go ahead i think we've all just felt i'm sure we would express it maybe differently and that being on my heart you ask you know yourself well lord what's that mean for me and what am i to do where do you want me how do i go forward in need and i could say there's been a lot of times i haven't been faithful to the opportunities he's given me to be the son of god he wants me to be and the answer and i'm so satisfied with the testimonies i've heard i feel they say so much of the same thing but um be faithful to the opportunities that god gives you that monday the next day whatever it is is going to be an opportunity for god to make himself real and whatever the situation is if you're a son of god and he's with you in it whatever it is just be faithful in that opportunity to let him have his way his will thank you god [Applause] david can you share with us what that sister wanted prayer for um walking around the neighborhood and i just stopped and talked to her for a second things turned to the lord pretty quick and she said in her way of all the medical problems she's been having she expressed that she was god's crack baby and the doctors didn't know exactly what was wrong and she's been through some things of her kidney and different things and on uh monday i believe she's going in for some sort of diagnosis she said it was good to pray with her and so we prayed with him the whole church is praying that david can encounter her again and she can testify how that god done exceedingly and abundantly god bless you let's stand brother billy could you come and lead us in a song of worship and and and praise do you feel like just praising them just for a moment it's all it's only 7 20 and and um and so we can have a just a few minutes to just have a word of prayer and trust in the lord amen god bless you let's just say a word of prayer well billy comes father we thank you for the word we thank you for the testimonies
