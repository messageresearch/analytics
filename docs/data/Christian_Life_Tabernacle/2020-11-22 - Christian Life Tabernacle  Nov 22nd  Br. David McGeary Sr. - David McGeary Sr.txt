and offerings lord all our brothers and sisters that are here today lord we just pray you you'll be with them and watch over each and every family lord we love you so in jesus christ's name amen amen amen i'm gonna invite her to mike far so i'm reading this morning good morning i'm going to uh read out of psalm 52 this morning you know what uh i always like to look at the you know the history of when it is that david seems to be writing a specific psalm or focusing on a specific thing on his heart you know the story behind you know psalm 52 if you remember the scripture this was kind of his response to david hearing the news when saul the servant of saul slaughtered all of those priests all of those ministers of the lord those innocent people that had given him refuge and given him food and given him shelter and given him guidance and it was it's really the sad tale of innocent people being slaughtered because of a king trying to preserve his position to extend his power and his influence and try to build for himself a place of safety and david as he's reacting to the news you know starts to put together this psalm and you know crying out to the lord and maybe a little bit in frustration over you know all of the work of the enemy or the wickedness around to try to preserve carnal things and he finally comes to a conclusion in verse six that sort of stuck out to me in spite of all this nonsense the deceit the wickedness the lying you know the violence to try to for men to try to get a hold of a carnal possession he comes to this conclusion in verse six let's see if it's verse six it's verse eight i'm sorry it says but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god you know what a contrast that is right you know you look at one example of people out running about spinning narratives trying to influence one another out of their positions and build for themselves you know tabernacles of power and riches and carnality and things like that and then here's this other example of a little green olive tree sitting in the house of the lord it just seems like those two things couldn't be on the same planet and i just remembered how it said in psalm 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper you know the thing about a tree is it doesn't move it just rests it's planted firmly in place it has everything it needs to live you stick that thing next to a source of water and it will far outlast the lifetime of any man in fact olive trees are known to live for thousands of years you can go over the middle east and find some that were around as jesus was praying in the garden of gethsemane you know in the midst of all of the struggle for power and influence and the things that men will do to one another in order to try to build a position or out position each other for things and then there are those who are like a tree planted in the house of the lord it's also interesting that there's a specific kind of tree that david is referring to here it produces a very specific kind of fruit it's it's the source of oil it's uh full of oil and all you have to do is get it in touch you get it in contact with a little bit of fire and it gives light to everything that's all around you know it's really easy in this day-to-day life to get lost in all of the struggle if you will to survive and build and construct places of safety out of carnal things the things that men will do to one another in order to do that but you know there's a different there's a different option i don't know about you but i'd rather be that little green olive tree in the house of the lord planted by the rivers of water bringing forth his fruit in his season you know if you ever want to if you want to read what it's like to be that green olive tree you can read matthew 5 to 7 and that's the olive tree teaching on what being an olive tree looks like but i just hope that a little bit of encouragement to you that you know if you look in psalm 52 here as we read it this morning it's just a little psalm but for those who love evil more than good lying more than righteousness it says in verse 5 god shall likewise destroy thee forever he shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living but for that green olive tree in verse 9 it says i will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints so let's just read psalm 52 together and encourage you to that we are little green olive trees in the house of the lord and not to get lost in the shuffle of the things that are about us let's read that together why boast us thou thy self and mischief o mighty man the goodness of god endureth continually thy tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working deceitfully thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness selah thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful time god shall likewise destroy thee forever he shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living sila the righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god i trust in the mercy of god forever and ever i will praise thee forever because thou hast done it and i will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints amen hey man god bless you may have your seats amen oh magnified alone with me all for his words [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah

uh when i left the military i said i told myself i said god i want to be with my family i just want to be with them every single day and then when i left uh the first job i ever had was a kind of like a contract job but it's consulting it's just traveling and i'm like i have to provide for the family god okay i'll just do it and then i kept on traveling monday sunday through friday and i wouldn't even see my family and i said i can't do this no more uh i left and i was just staying at home and i said god i would sit down here until you provide the one that is right next beside my house for me uh that was uh in my mind i'm like is that far am i far reaching i'm like i don't know but i trust in it and all of a sudden the job that presented itself was traveling and it was too good to be true in fact i was here to give a testimony for that i took that but something was telling me oh you're not patient boy that's not the one i have for you but it was too good for me i was like no i just have to take this one oh okay i'll travel i'll travel well i lost the job as soon as fast as i took the job and you know i sat down at home and i was like okay this time god i will be in fact i will be patient i would wait for the exact one that you want for me and um oh god is good i can tell you that and he provided the one that is right next to me and he provided that exact one for me and i

this morning you would come and visit us mortal that you would just drop down and lord speak to our hearts this morning we hear that you may speak to us lord i know it's our pastor this morning that we may receive from your throne lord we're so happy to be called sons and daughters to you lord and hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] sing with me [Music] amen he's great isn't he i'm i'm sorry i don't come out on time i i don't have any audio or any visual or anything in my office and i just don't hear the way i used to hear but i did want to come i want you to know that you love them this morning amen i think that uh he loves us and i think that's what's keeping us amen amen let's just uh bow our hearts and our our spirits before the lord this morning and let's approach him let's approach him in honesty we all have needs this morning [Music] and the best part about it is he knows what you have need of he knows what's caused your trouble he knows your weakness and but he promised you that he'd never leave you nor forsake you so heavenly father we come before your throne this morning we're a needy people [Music] and you can look upon us and see each of our shortcomings and our weaknesses [Music] father you can see the mistakes that we make the vanities that we have in our minds but rather we know that you love us and that you gave your only begotten son for us and that you have provided for us everything that we have need of and father that you've given us a word to minister and to guide us and to speak to our hearts so we've come this morning father though we're an embattled people though there's lots of pressure on us and a lot of things we don't understand we rest this morning knowing that nothing can pluck us out of the palm of your hand and what a comfort that is that all the father hath given me will come that my sheep know my voice in another they will not follow father i thank you for these words and father i thank you for the promise that's so precious to me that if you've begun a good work you will finish it to the end though there's much work to be done lord i trust that you're still working on me ask you to bless us this morning as we try to serve you and put you first in this great hour we ask you to bless you we thank you for our musicians this morning our deacons our trustees father for those that sung specials in worship father we thank you for answering our prayer requests this morning just ask you to be with us now in a time of fellowship in jesus name we pray amen amen let's turn in our bibles this morning and and i i told brother billy i said brother billy you know i i don't really know exactly which way to lead the people or which way to go so i think we'll just go around in circles this morning you know we'll just review and talk about some things and and maybe lift our spirits up a little bit because i can honestly say i have never been this way before amen there's a lot of new things every day but let's read this scripture found in malachi and and the last chapter of the book of malachi and and maybe you remember this verse it's in malachi 4 and 5 and 6 amen and it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse amen our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning you may be seated you know i would probably be able to make the conclusion this morning that most of us are here because we have come to the revelation and understanding that god has sent in this last day a prophet now in our religious setting in the society that uh we live in today that's a tremendous statement to make that you believe that there has been a prophet because uh most people would uh conclude that um that you know that jesus has come and preached the gospel and died on the cross and that his blood has sanctified us and cleansed us from all unrighteousness and we wouldn't need a prophet what a prophet is is he's a messenger he's god always has used the prophets when he wanted to deliver a message to his church net a prophet never did away with the passover a prophet in the old testament never did away with the temple but he guided the people when the people were moving away from god and that's what the message is due it's something from god to us to to bring us back to what is the original word and we know in this uh scripture here that he says i will turn the hearts of the children back to the father in other words back to the faith of our fathers that's what was beginning to the church was beginning to lose was the faith that our original fathers possessed and and saying this this morning uh it's it's like uh i read this statement to you um last week and i i or last wednesday night maybe it was it says he says see that's it when we asunder part it gives us inward pain and he says this i've seen the time brother now let me not condemn us but let me just wake us up to something and i think that's what that god's trying to do to the church is wake him up to something and he said i i've seen the time in this church that when people had to wait until wednesday night to meet another one they would cry over it and that's right i've seen ministers come in here and would say how do you do it well then people just one heart see i they meet at the door them sisters meet one another back there and hug each other and say sister be sure to pray for me now honey i'll see you again wednesday night i'll pray won't you you pray for me i'll be praying for you and make like that and tears in their eyes see the brothers shake hands one another's hands and just could hardly get away from each other like that that's real christian fellowship see just waiting praying for each or yes sir that's the way it should be all right and you know i wanted to make this point that you know i'm not trying to put pressure on you to come back to church but to make you aware that there's something happening in the spiritual realm that i want you to really uh understand that where i'm coming from that there's a spiritual effect and a spiritual toll being taken and uh and i want you to do and you know to do what you know the spirit word is telling you to do and that's the most important aspect of it is that you understand and and so i i want to use this statement this morning to kind of back up to where i'm going this morning it's just going to be fellowship this morning and he says now a jehovah witness is loyal to what they believe how many knows the jehovah witnesses are loyal to what they believe how many have you ever had them knock on your door you know i i think that's great you know i mean i i don't know if you know what they believe but they believe that there's a coming kingdom that's why they call it jehovah witnesses and they call their churches kingdom halls they believe that there's coming a time that the world government and the world will be run by the church and and the people will obtain positions in that kingdom according to how hard that they worked for that kingdom and how many converts they have and and it's it's a kingdom realm that is based on certain things and and these people believe that when they get out and they pass out the watchtower and they pass out uh whatever other little books that they have they pass out they believe that they're working for the kingdom of god and that there is a reward for their works now i just told you what they believe contains a lot of truth amen they believe that and anybody that really believes something and is convinced is concerned you know and then you know how can we as christians claim to have the spirit of the lord and believe that there's judgment coming and that there's that there's a hell that people are going to go to and they're going to be separated from god and believe that the wages of sin is death so if you see somebody and you know the way they're living and you know what the reward for that life is and you have the spirit of christ in you and you're convinced that there's a way to live that's to life and there's a way to live to death then wouldn't you in your spirit want to at least reach out to that person if you had any kind of common decency or any spirit of care or love at all and say friend you you know it's even among some of you you teenagers when you start to see in high school i guess or junior high now i guess when you start to see your friend starting to smoke and and everything and you go to them and say don't go there i mean you'll get cancer you'll be easily sick you you know what i mean there's so many bad things just common love and common concern would reach out and and try to tell somebody hey you're you're on the wrong road this is what happened this is what happens and uh you know they used to have a program where they would take first-time offenders and they would bring them into hardened prisons and they'd let those inmates talk to them for a little while and say okay this is what goes on in here you know what i mean and they would have some pretty straight conversations with them which can't be repeated from the pulpit i'm sure but they would basically try to scare them and let them realize that the life that they're living and the path that they're on out there leads them in here this is where you end up when you drive down that road and you know and of course everybody thinks that can get away with it but remember you can't get away with anything with god he knows the beginning from the end he he is the one that knows all things and so we can't escape him but so but what he does has done is he's given us the gospel to let us know that this life of the world is a life that leads to destruction the wages of unbelief sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus so he said jehovah witnesses uh is loyal to what they believe the baptist is loyal to what they believe the presbyterian is loyal to what they believe and they're just as loyal to their pastor can't we be that loyal to the word what uh what a i don't want to say it's a rebuke but what a an opportunity for us to look into the mirror okay somebody's standing back okay and they're looking at this jehovah witness and and and who are good people catholics are some of the most precious people i know it's a lot easier to get a catholic to help you to do something than than another protestant and so and and he's sitting back and he sees all these people faithful and loyal getting up and driving the bus you know because they have a bus driver ministry that's the baptist church or a sunday school ministry even uh we were over here at the place we rented for the young people here a little while ago and the gentleman there keeps the groundskeeper and the janitor and my goodness he did that job like it was a divine given ministry he looked at it like it was a ministry i i'm in charge of the building and i fix things and i clean things and and he was serving god in that and then he said they sit back and he's sitting back and he's observing these different forms of loyalty and and the way that these people are loyal to their sewing guild and to their bodies and they look he looks back and he's looking at this and now he comes down and he comes down to the people that have been given the interpretation and the opening of the seven seals the mysteries of god has been opened to the truth of the word has been unfolded and he looks at them straggling in the church at 10 30 and knocked on one door in between here in church hadn't invited nobody to church hasn't picked up anybody for church hasn't testified to anybody oh they're loyal you know it's like it's like we feel like we're like god was obligated to give us this truth and and so it struck me that this week they had a minister from from fort worth and uh he's standing up against the people you know closing church and he told them he says hey people in this time they need church he said my congregation has doubled since this uh pandemic and i thought well you know why is that he says you know because people are afraid to go to hell but the only difference with us is we don't think we can go to hell you know it it it's kind of like you get an attitude and uh uh and so you know and then we we forget to understand that if god lit our candle no man lighteth a candle and put it under a bushel basket but he puts it up on the hill and then jesus says he says he says lay for yourself a pattern of good works that your good works might glorify your father in heaven and so he said that can't they be loyal he says now if those pharisees and sadducees and leaders if this is out of taking sides with jesus paragraph 2 12 you can if you want to put it up now if those pharisees and sadducees and leaders of that day would have got away from their creeds and their dogmas and listened to what the word said and what jesus was telling them just exactly what the messiah was supposed to do they would have held on to him okay if they would have got away from their creeds and got away from other influences and just listened to what that he was preaching to him what that he was telling them what he told them the messiah would do they would have held on to him they would have held on to him just think of that see but they thought so much of their leaders now what i'm pointing at and what i want to talk to you and what i'm trying to expect to you is the understanding of influence he said and and that strikes me they would have held on to him but they thought so much of their leaders they wasn't bad men they wouldn't steal lie cuss or anything like that they wouldn't do that they wouldn't commit adultery why certainly not why they they would witness the stoning of a one that had did such things and they wouldn't they wouldn't do that they were good men but the only thing is they wasn't spiritual men morally they were fine but that isn't what counts what did jesus tell them even them loyal people said if ye are of your fathers the devil see it's the word that counts okay so the the thing of it was is that they they just they just weren't spiritual men okay and so that's what we wanted to talk about this morning just a little bit is is is you know having having a uh a uh a spiritual mind can you understand so we realize there's all this carnal stuff happening out here you know things are going on rapidly okay and and in the midst of these happenings there is leadership that's what our country just went through it went through a great big fight over leadership and this last campaign was all based on this uh plague one group of leadership said he this these people aren't leading us the right way concerning this plague and the other group said we will lead you in a better way you know we we are going to use science and we're going to take this science and we're gonna overcome this uh uh plague and the other side saying no you don't have to be as afraid of it as uh you know and and so it it if this great big conflict that was transpiring was all about what leadership who was going to lead and who was going to uh give us leadership so the the question is opposed to us you understand that the question is is that something is rising up to take leadership now we know that this world wants to come to a one head leader government that's what they want they want somebody to sit on the throne right an antichrist a vicar of christ somebody that's going to rule and something is going to create a consensus that we should all come together whether it's a system or a figurehead or everything and they're setting the tone for those things right now things are starting to fall in place and beginning to work so that a a consensus form of leadership or influence of the world i i thought i've got a little text today i thought it was amusing that it sent to me and it said the the cdc now says that people without any symptoms can spread the virus and the person wrote after that now it's healthy people that we have to be afraid of so pretty soon it's all the people who don't have any symptoms who aren't sick they'll have to quarantine and i thought my goodness where where where's the where's the spiritual mind where's the people that can stand back at and see what has slowly crept in how many understand that sodom has slipped crep in on america now america is identical to sodom i believe brother jairus would testify to me the other day that that the the the governor of his state doc is a uh a out of the closet uh known uh a female governor just right out bold leading governing we i believe again we have another catholic president we have six of the nine or seven of the nine supreme court justices are catholic uh i i mean i i you it just i i guess there's no way we read those quotes the other day where he said you can't even go to school see a kid go to school now day without something stuck in their ear let's ask a question okay how many people here have earbuds on you can't raise your hand you have a you have earbuds you don't have nothing you put on your ear no microphone god bless you brother you have some did you raise your hand he raised his hand no i'm telling you things are happening but we want to be able to be spiritual right and so uh and then we we read that that the time would come that they wouldn't know whether they were male nor female not that the female was acting like a man and the man was acting like a female and or they don't know what they are no it would actually come a time that they wouldn't know because they have a whole new definition it takes three parts it takes your mind how you think do you think like a lady or do you think like a man i don't understand that how do you feel and then what your natural birth was and so all three of those have to fall into some sort of harmony before you know what you are and what's one of the things that we we've preached and preached and preached it for the last five years was recognizing what who we are why was that so important when here on the world side they were losing their identity completely they don't know what they are and so we saw that so we saw these things that little things are coming to pass and then we realized when we read this he says all these natural happenings now they forerun spiritual happenings each happening accompanies the other happening it only improves it so we we come if we're spiritually minded which is what that we have to be because carnal things the carnal mind is enmity against god but the spiritual mind is life it's life in liberty so we we know that and the carnal things of this world are discerned by a carnal mind but spiritual things can only be discerned by a spiritual mind and that's why that the battle that takes place within your mind is the battle between the spiritual mind and the carnal mind right the five senses are are are are pressing in and uh trying to uh trying to get you to look at things in in a in a carnal manner and uh and yet the things of the lord are spiritually discern so he's listening he says he says i'm i'm telling you the truth and someday you'll meet it he says you you might say oh i swear that i never trespass the vows of my husband your husband will judge you if you did but god will judge you by what kind of a spirit you got in you not judge you by your body but by your spirit the inner man that's page 12 uh paragraph 52 of god of this evil age so now we're talking about having a spiritual mind the first thing you've got to recognize with a spiritual mind is what god is judging you by how he's looking at you remember god works from the inside out the world works from the outside in so the world they they let me just say this to him he says the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses five senses rather the inside man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscience and love and so forth the outside man see taste feel smell in here so the god works from the inside stay with me this morning from the inside out satan works or the other spirit works from the outside so what he does is he tries to attack to approach the senses see here touched and smell and then he tries to go to the inside loving emotions so he comes from the outside trying to change the spirit on the inside so what he tries to do he tries to get you to like certain things feel certain things see certain things and then have the inside spirit pursue those avenues and let those ten avenues be the avenues that lead you one of those emotions that that affect the inside man is fear so he tries to control us by using the outside to come in to take control of the inside that that's what that's what's happening okay so we realize that part of us that and then we have the inside part and he says go on he says now but the inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will you can accept what the devil says or accept what god says and that'll determine what spirit is in there so that's that that is what determines what spirit is in there right by the choices that is being made and the influence so if we're going to be spiritual and we see a great natural happening taking place we see a great move of the government we see a great move in the world we see things happening like never happening they they completely uh uh change the way the the world dresses yeah everybody's puts on a mess now everybody stays so far away can i i'm not i'm not saying whether that's good or that's bad don't don't miss my point my point is what is the spirit behind it and where is it taking us because the choice is is there and so he said now this inside of that so and that'll determine what spirit's in there if it's the spirit of god it'll feed on the things of god it won't feed on the things of the world that in other words it will feed on the things of god and the things of the world so there has to be some a spiritual ability in you and i'm saying this to you that you this morning have got to understand that you have the responsibility to your own soul to discern and that's what the scripture says you said you're still children because you can't discern between good and evil between the carnal and you know when you're in a war you know when you when you first when you're at peace the army's made out of old you know people young men 22 23 on up but you get in desperate times you go into some third world countries where they're in great battles and they had great revolutions they had soldiers 13 12 14 15 16 years old they were pressed into battle and we've got to be pressed into battle now in other words we know that we have an enemy that's like a roaring lion who is the who is the prince of the air right he's the ruler of this world and now he's empowering himself to take control of this world and take control of his subjects and take control of his people and he'll do it by any means if he can go to a laboratory and come up with an invisible germ that's got everybody scared to death and you don't know where it's coming from or who's got it you got it i mean i've been tested i don't know how many times and i don't have it that's what they say and then i get a news flash hey if you don't have any symptoms you're probably the spreader oh i'm sorry you know so you come down to you come down to a time you understand where you've got to go back and anchor in something so i go back and i read mark 16. and i got a commission go into all the world preach the gospel lay your hands unto sin and they shall recover they shall take up serpents or drink deadly things you know serpents is spirits and there's a lot of deadly things besides sinai you can drink spiritually so there's a lot of ramifications in a lot of realms for that but the way the gospel is preached is by testimony faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god by life and testimony and by signs and wonders that's the way the gospels preach and so if he can shut down the gospel what he's shutting down is his opposing kingdom what he wants to shut down he doesn't know the only thing that's holding this whole thing together are these nuts it's the oddballs so we see that he says so he said they won't feed the spirit of god and they won't they'll feed on the things of god and it won't fade on the things of the world jesus said if you love the world and the things of the world it's because the love of god has not entered this inward part okay so that that's what we got to get to we've got to get to this inward part where the love of god has entered into this inward part now this inward part is going to be what governs you and leads you and that inner part will not feed on anything else but the word of god that's what it feeds on it feeds on the word of god he says god is that near and depart satan has deceived you now what if this whole thing is nothing but a deception of the devil we have people who have caught the c19 flu and they've been sick they've ate they've had headaches they felt miserable the worst part about the whole thing is they lost their appetite and and it's rough for four or five days and then after four or five days you're weak and you're stressed out and you feel bad and then all of a sudden you start going sitting in the sun and you step outside and breathe some fresh air you start to come out of your prison and and you start to feel better and you start thanking the lord and everybody who's got better that's held the testimony god's my healer you understand that no nothing's going to take me home till i'm done until god's done with me and if it's my time i'm ready and i want to go home what i'm talking about is don't take the deception of satan's spirit of fear and and and and and uh all all these things that they want to attach to it politics and all this stuff you know we want to have a spiritual mind okay so this is what he says he says he says hasn't entered that airport satan has deceived you and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and that's what we've got to that's what we spiritually now have got to understand the spiritual inner man which is determining what that were of has got to feed on something so it's got to feed on the word of god it's got to have an individual personal relationship with the word of god it can't be loyal to a human leadership let's go to 54. and the world seems to be in the most evil age that ever was never in any other age did women ever act like that never but just before the destruction of the andalusian world jesus referred to it we'll get to that after a while how many knows as it was in the days of noah has the holy ghost has god lost control that's just not a right in other words let's take a moment in our lives to put on our spiritual cap and say what's influencing me you know let's all the people you know okay so in our country we had two great people people and and they're great gospel preachers one great gospel preacher was fox well you go read your by your bible it's what he called herod and all hit that garbage you know well people like that garbage better than they did over here nsn bc whatever that stands for in all their garbage and believers glue in their ears oh and then go out and preach that gospel you've got another gospel to preach it's the gospel of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever [Music] let me tell you one side is a godless society right so the other side they throw a little god in and all the christians though that's their side but all he's preaching is lady osea more wealth more jobs more things he's preaching lady osea blind miserable poor wretched and naked and don't know it because you prosper and increase with goods and don't know that you're blind poor miserable and wretched there's another happening church come out from amongst them and be ye separate how can two walk together unless they agree that's right so a bunch go over here and they agree with this and they agree with that and another bunch runs over here and they agree and they agree with that and nobody goes back you know i thought this was what we were founded on but this is out of the picture it's out of the schools how come our country ever let that happen prayer is out of the school they want to take in god we trust off the money they won't preach anything that has anything to do they're taking nativity scenes out of public places they're removing the cross one stake the people made them remove the ten commandments is anybody getting a spiritual thinking a cap that satan is starting to take control no let me tell you this satan is starting to take control in fact i can say thus saith the lord because the prophet said they've got just what they deserve satan is their leader so just don't think that there's not spirits out there there's not things out there that are working to take care and to create a carnal situation that's going to put the believer in conflict amen we heard a message called the conflict between god and satan he says every time the spiritual and the carnal meet there is a clash and there is a conflict we are heading to a conflict and a clash with a system that is going to stand up against the word of god then what then what has god lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control okay do you is everybody spiritually understand that there's another agency out there that's now taking control i wonder the true answer to this question is in my opinion there is two opposing spirits in the world today at work now there can't be no more than two two heads one of them is the holy spirit at work the other one is the spirit of the devil and in this last days in deception the two spirits paragraph 56 the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit the other one the devil's spirit working by deception and the people of the earth are now making their choice you can't avoid the choice you understand the conflict is coming to you the choice is coming to you and there's it's coming to the hour who will you serve choose this day whom you serve as for me and my house will serve god they did that to daniel daniel you can't worship you can't bow you can't pray to no other god did daniel say okay i'll just do what the king says for a few days here no biggie well what's it hurt you know god's pretty cool he'll take second place god i need a favor here would you just please forget who you are for a moment and just go take a back seat well i show this leader remember what i just read they like their leaders that's their leadership i'm just going to go with the leadership here for a few days and keep the peace now daniel daniel did as it was his custom amen he went he opened the windows he looked towards jerusalem from whence cometh his help and he knelt down and he prayed for the day that he could go back to that land and enter into that temple and make sacrifice to his god you say what did it get daniel it got daniel a trip to the zoo and up in personal relationship with god's creation face to face with lions but he made a choice shadrach meshach and abednego they had a choice who you gonna you you've got to bow down when the trumpet sounds let me put it this way when the executive order comes forth when the county judge guidelines come down everybody obey o king live forever we thank you for the job you gave us yes we thank you for the honor you bestowed upon us yes remember these were the guys who wouldn't eat the king's food because it wasn't kosher so the cook just fed them bread and substance and they were healthier and fair and stronger eating the word of god then they were eating all the barbecued pork in the whole world and i imagine that king is pretty fancy with his barbecue they wouldn't eat it they wouldn't defile themselves oh you remember the scripture we read returning back to the faith what's supposed to be restored to us is the faith the faith of our fathers was determined as i just read that quote to you in the choices that they made do you remember me just reading that to you that and that will determine what spirit is in there you will accept what the devil says or what god says and that will determine what spirit's in there they wouldn't but file themselves because they had something in there they wouldn't bow down and they testified they say oh can't live forever but i can't obey that amen i don't know if my god will deliver me or my god won't deliver me it wasn't based on the deliverance it was based on the word of god what god said god said i am the lord thy god thou shalt have no other gods but me amen [Applause] that's what they were anchored on they weren't afraid of a respirator they weren't afraid of being sick for a few days they weren't afraid of death o king live forever whether our god will deliver us or our god won't deliver us this one thing i know we will not bow down to that idol the king was wrathed he said heat it up boys one times hotter that old barbecue that big old thing got started getting a little glow turn it up hotter pretty soon it was red you know you can get metal so red and so hot it's it becomes white looks like you can almost see through it and then guys went to open the door and they turned into crispy little critters and just fell over they got these big sticks and they pushed them in there you think they were afraid of the fire no they were afraid of what would happen to them if they bowed down to that idol that's what they were afraid of they are afraid what would happen to them if they became subject to that other spirit what would happen to them if they were deceived by those lies that's what they were concerned about don't worry about him that can deliver your body but worry about him that can deliver your soul into hell that's what they were worried about looked in there he says hey i thought i threw three in there who's this fourth fella now that king you knew had revelation if you read a story he's pretty spiritual guy he says this fourth one looks like the son of god you don't think he'll go with you through the fire he'll go through the flood amen see it it's coming down so it's we're we're here we're at that time that that and the people are making a choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ yes he is going to vindicate his word of promise to her for this age showing that it is christ amen amen what a great thing so we we see these two great spirits are are at work now and there's a choice now as i i kind of moved to a close here this morning we read the scripture that says turn the hearts of our children back to the fathers and you know uh we were fellowshipping the other day and it kind of came on my heart in regards to listening to this message taking sides with jesus we listened to wednesday night that when we look back to what was restored we always go back to pentecost and we see these disciples coming out of the upper room speaking in tongues and doing signs and wonders so when we think of restoration of faith we always go back and think of the restoration of pentecost is that right that what's going to be restored to us is the laying on of hands and the speaking in tongues and and all these signs and these wonders which is true but i just want to spend a moment on this with you just for a moment this morning the faith that our fathers had that was to be restored to us was the faith they had before pentecost the word was made flesh is that right and that's what they believed they believed what they were hearing that's why they followed it that's why they took sides with it now there was a feast at canaan and jesus attended that feast and they ran out of wine and mary being a relative i presume uh or close friends with the bride and the bridegroom when they ran out of wine they knew that would be an embarrassment and so she said this is my son or this is jesus do whatever he tells you to do i want that kind of faith he says mother it's not my time of course her having a special relationship with the father fulfilling his word receiving the reproach on his behalf willing to bear a child conceived of the holy spirit she knew where she stood he says just do what he says he says go fill these basins up with water so these ordinary men isn't it funny that god always comes to the poor of this world rich in faith and we spend all our time trying to get rich and let our faith die where if we would increase our faith we would be rich and he fills these bottles full of water these things of water and they taste it it's water they know it's water and they bring it to us as we've done as he said if you said he says okay go draw from it and bring it to the the master of the feast and they go dip in and they bring it to him and he tastes it and he says how come you save the best till the last now i would imagine as far as wine goes that's the best wine they ever had in jerusalem they've never had a batch like that since you don't think those people knew you don't think that wine guy knew where that wine come from you don't think they knew what jesus did you don't think the people at the feast knew and their family knew you think that just was a secret that's why it's a shame when you keep your testimonies secret when god does something for you and you don't tell nobody you don't testify you don't share so they go they go start telling around this jesus in nazareth he may turn this water into wine he turned this water into wine i'm sure that was a buzz it was going on and all the little all the little talk shows that that were all going on in a little synagogue buzz when they went to their local synagogues hey how's the defeats the other day and this guy from nazareth his name was jesus he made seven vats of wine and the carnal mind goes oh what does he have a new recipe and the other guys are saying no it's a miracle and so his knowledge began to spread right and when when people heard the testimony those that had something in them something was awakened so when jesus showed up on the scene and he began to preach and he began to do his signs and his wonders the people were attracted to him and they audited him and they marveled at him and and they came and some came for the loaves and fishes and some came for the miracles but when it finally came down and jesus looked them he said well thou leave also he said where can we go thou alone has the words of eternal life that was before pentecost then he looked at him and says who do men say that i am he says thou art the christ the son of the living god they followed him enough they had watched him enough they knew this was no human attribute that's right this had to be god he said flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you upon this rock i will build my church what spiritual revelation a spiritual mind that can spiritually discern between the carnal works of the devil and the word of god that was the faith that he wanted to return this to not to the works of pentecost that was the fruit that they had because they were endued with power to go into all the world and preach the gospel that's why that was given amen but the faith they had was before they endured with power that was the revelation of the word of god that they seen the word of god come to pass they seen the fulfillment they knew he was the word and that's what they took sides with and that the faith that they had so when you only look back to that and you're looking for the power you're not going back far enough to have the faith that he could give the power to because power without character is satanic so they believed they made their confession and he told them you go wait in the upper room until you're in dude with power on high because they had a commission he didn't tell him just go out and fill the commission he says go up there get this power i'm going to send you the spirit that's going to bring you into remembrance of all things that i taught it's going to lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness because i will not leave you i will not forsake you but i'll be with you even in you till the end i will come unto you again and lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness they were believers there was something in them that caused them to believe now we're now we've got a challenge before us is that right we've got it we're facing a challenge back as your pastor i'm sitting here how do i weigh this how many have ever heard the scripture forsake not the assembling of yourselves together that's right would somebody go please search that out through the great ancient aramaic and find out if there was any government regulations attached to that i don't know i i i when i looked at and they said please shut your church down for two weeks i said okay i want to be a good neighbor i want to render to caesar the things that are caesar's all right we have 10 people here and the police show up i said okay i go with that and then it comes to this and then we take our pews out and then we spread our chairs out in everything do you think they're going to stop when do we take god's word amen my brother orlando told me he said brother mcgary when you read that quote that i want to show you something he said i just back there thought there and thought i said what were you thinking orlando he says i was thinking we're all going to jail okay i have a i have a brother i i'm gonna visit with him again soon one day his name's peter and he was dragged up in front of the sanhedrin and they whipped them and beat them and told them go no more and preach in this name of jesus by decree of roman julius abbot caesar somebody finally caught that out right what did they do they had a whole bunch of people having a prayer meeting and and they go to jail they come they go over there and then they're rejoicing and i believe the scripture said they grew in boldness preaching the gospel paul said i've been in jail i've been imprisoned i've been whipped i've been scourged i've been cast out i've been thrown asunder wait a minute we didn't want that faith of the fathers we wanted this one on the other side where we had all this intellectual understanding of the seals and we didn't have to make no choices right but the hour's coming i love i i don't love the devil but i had you have to admire his tactics right come together for communion when you come together assemble you know carry one for another pray for one or don't come if you're hungry now that every man needed home so we come together for the worse you know we don't come together for the better and everything but now you just you look at him until he gets out there he says oh here's people that believe in divine healing they they believe in laying hands on the sick and they'll recover they they believe in all things they come to church to pray for one another and to get well church used to be the place you came to when you were sick now it's the place you come to to get sick and now they say oh church people are assembling together because those people ain't got no symptoms so we'll just mark them the spreaders praise god we are the spreaders we're the spreaders of truth we're the spreaders of life we're the spreaders of gospel we're the spreaders of the spirit of god amen let's make them afraid to go to church let's tell them they'll get sick there let's tell them they can't get close enough to pray one for another let's put a muzzle uh [Music] [Music] so what do they do uh hello remember if god doesn't watch the city the watchman watches in vain but they want to muzzle the ox they want to put all kinds of subtle things in that are teaching us creating us us developing a way of thinking in a society contrary to the word of god and there's going to be a conflict oh i really want to get into this well we won't i'll do it tonight there will be no streaming tonight [Applause] but it's the best part i'm going to preach on signs and wonders by attributes just how adam had the attributes of god in him because he was the son of god and why eve went out and why adam went out and what's really being restored in this day but let's just leave it this morning here and take an honest look if how many knows that we have a god of this evil age and we know that god this god of this evil age is created in eden right satan's eden of science education and we've read many times in this last few services this is a summary of what we've been preaching that this this bride has nothing to do with science education or knowledge science education and knowledge is the biggest hindrance that god's ever had is the thing that is against everything he says he says lay hands on the sick and they will recover there's no science for that there's only a god for that you shall take up deadly things and they shall not harm you there's no science for that there's a god for that is right he's the lord our god that healeth of all our diseases there's no science for that in fact it's contrary to common sense it's contrary for you to believe that god protects you like the man that was going to go to africa to minister the gospel he felt led to be preached to go there and they took him before the church board and they said you know there's malaria there malaria is very s sickening disease there's typhoid there there's leprosy there and they listed all these terrible things that could happen and the young man's answer was so pure it reminded me of the coin whose image is on the point they said sirs if god wants me in africa i'm safer in africa than i am here and if god wants you to serve him and to keep his word and to follow his commandments of baptism and foot washing and communion and he wants you to come to the house of the lord to worship you feel led how you're led of the spirit whatever spirit's in there you are safer in god's word than you are in that whatever program they have on the outside you say brother mcgarry you're going to get yourself thrown in jail praise god i know there's angels that can open cells and i won't be the first believer that's come up before a magistrate there's believers in this message that are in prison all over because they stood for the word of god it has nothing to do with coming to this building it has everything to do with what you're letting influencing you i have a cardinal brother a natural brother his whole hope and his whole trust is in the government he just turned 75 yesterday i believe four years older than i am and my heart bleeds for him and he gets angry with me because i'm not as scared to death he says 250 000 people died from this and i thought my goodness michael 431 000 people died from alcohol i can save more people by shutting down every liquor store in this country than they can putting the whole country on lockdown i i forget it's it was a phenomenal number i i i this it may be 45 000 or 145 000 people died from second hand cigarette smoke secondhand because their argument is they have the choice to drink or not well they didn't have the choice to smoke or not it was second-hand smoke all these carnal logic but the truth of the matter if god be for you who can be against you was that right and if you're in the palm of his hand nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand so this is what i'm trying to say church don't get caught up in that fear i'm not saying don't put on a mask just like i say don't go to college i've encouraged every student in here that wants to go to college to go to college and be the best christian college student you can there there's a a a sister that's very dear to me a young sister i admire i uh she's been a blessing to me personally in her testimony she's she's achieved uh great things academically and and and i'll tell you all i mean i know this will probably make a lot of people man but i encouraged her to go on and get her phd to get her doctorate to be all that she can be i'm not afraid of that hurting her and you know i said her it's it's not about getting carnal it's about being spiritual amen discerning the things that are god and rendering to god the things that are god and when the things of caesar cross the things of god who gets the preeminence and that's what it's coming to and this is what i want to choose i want to choose god's word i want to have my faith in him to heal me i want to have faith in him to keep me i want to have my faith in him to lead me and guide me into all things i want to hear him hear ye him i i don't want to be so caught up by the paper so caught up by the news so caught up by what everybody's doing that i'm in fear for my job i like what brother branham said he said they shut every door to me i have no place to preach in any denomination i've been shut out of everything i've been cast out he said but when the young man gasped out jesus came and found him and brother brandon says you know he's got somewhere for me he's got some place for me and i don't know what this thing might do to you economically i don't know what it'll do to your jobs i don't know what it'll do to anything but let me tell you something if you get cast out he'll find you and he's got somewhere for you because nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hands let's take sides with jesus let's take sides with the word of god let's have our faith in him that he'll take care of us i've never seen a righteous man make bread let's get back to a spiritual mind a mind that loves the lord a mind that serves god a mind that worships the lord the musicians become i've come to worship him this morning that's what i've come to do i've come to shout his name like i'm not ashamed i've come to sing until the walls come falling down i dream at night now of me being in the courtroom i'm sorry uh i'm i'm a dramatist i can't help it but i i dream in there sitting in in front of the judge with my bible open telling the bible stories talking about god as a healer we had a vaccine a long time ago [Applause] i preached god's got a vaccine amen lay your hands on the set if you'll come anoint them with oil call the elders of the church confess your sins anoint them with oil and they'll rise up amen is that i've come to worship that's the one i want to say hey amen aren't you maya i'm so happy every believer in every age wanted to live here all of them wanted to wish and dream and they could be in the courthouse [Music] standing with their bible saying i choose god's word [Music] your honor you told me not to go to church but god told us to assemble together i asked you today in the name of jesus christ who do you choose who do you choose your honor i choose to follow god's word if you want to stop it you go ahead but one day the only reason you can judge and sit there is because my father which is in heaven gave you the authority shall i tell you the rest of the dream you're all in the courthouse [Music] you're all kneeling down the hallways amen and we all start singing this song together let's stand together and sing it amen billy can you come amen oh there's [Music] it's [Music] eyes [Music] heaven i'm gonna shout [Music] oh i'm gonna sing [Music] [Music] worship i've come to worship oh there's a lot that lives in me [Music] [Music] a [Music] till i can reach heaven i'm gonna [Music] [Music] that can bring me peace that can wash me clean [Music] oh when you save my soul [Music] [Music] i am not [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] oh this is my plea we'll let the worshipers arrive oh and let the sun [Music] [Applause] [Music] again and let the worshipers arrived [Music] [Music] oh i surrendered [Music] [Applause] awakening [Music] this is hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen guilty amen so many times a question [Music] certain circumstances all things [Music] [Music] my frustration [Music] i never had to stand the test alone as i look at all the victory his spirit rises up in me it's through the fight my weakness is made strong oh he never promised but the cross will not get and it will not be hard to climb [Music] all he never offered a victory without fighting oh just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says [Music] that the cross will not get [Music] [Music] victories without
