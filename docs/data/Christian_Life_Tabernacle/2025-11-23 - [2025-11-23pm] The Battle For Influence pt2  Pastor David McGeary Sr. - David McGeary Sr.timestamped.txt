[16:55] you, Lord. The Muhamadans and the other
[16:58] guys, they've been waiting, but we have
[17:01] a Christ that rose from the dead. And
[17:03] because you rose from the dead, we have
[17:05] a firm assurance that whatever you we
[17:08] ask for, Lord, you would give it to us.
[17:09] If you could give your very life,
[17:11] there's nothing less than that that you
[17:13] would give us. Your children have come
[17:15] with their different requests, oh God.
[17:17] Our prayer is that you would answer
[17:19] them, oh Father, the ones that have been
[17:21] spoken and even unspoken from the
[17:23] morning, Father, may you answer them
[17:25] according to your riches in glory for
[17:27] the glory of your name and your name
[17:29] alone. Lord, our brothers who will be
[17:30] leaving next weekend, Lord, for your
[17:32] service. May you be with them to protect
[17:34] them and give [music] them a blessing,
[17:36] Lord. You've promised that the angel of
[17:37] the Lord would camp about them that fear
[17:39] you and deliver them from evil. May you
[17:41] do it for them, oh God, in Jesus mighty
[17:43] name. Bless even the offering. Bless
[17:45] your children, Lord, and [music] may
[17:47] your glory be to you and to you alone.

[17:51] praise for your mighty works in our

[28:40] Mark uh the 16th chapter of the Gospel
[28:44] of St. Mark. And uh
[28:48] and we'll read those uh scriptures
[28:51] there. I believe they're found in uh
[28:58] Mark 16, the 16th chapter of the book of
[29:03] St. Mark. And u starting with the 15th
[29:08] verse
[29:10] and
[29:13] and we like to read this scripture and
[29:17] again in Mark 16:15.
[29:20] And he said unto them, "Go ye into all
[29:23] the world
[29:25] and preach the gospel to every
[29:27] creature." Go into all the world and
[29:31] influence
[29:33] every creature.
[29:35] And he that believeth and is baptized
[29:37] shall be saved, but he that believeth
[29:40] not shall be damned. And these signs
[29:44] shall follow them that believe in thy
[29:47] name. They shall cast out devils. They
[29:49] shall speak with new tongues. They shall
[29:51] take up serpents, and if they drink any
[29:54] deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.
[29:57] and say it shall lay hands on the sick
[29:59] and they shall recover. Our gracious
[30:02] father, we ask you to bless us in your
[30:04] precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[30:08] bless you. Just a a little seated
[30:11] certainly. And uh so we understand that
[30:16] uh it's uh
[30:20] definitely
[30:21] uh
[30:24] written that
[30:26] uh
[30:28] Jesus wanted us to have influence.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; You that that's what he commissioned his
[30:34] disciples. He says now you've got it but
[30:37] I don't want it here. Go out and share
[30:39] it. you know, go out and influence
[30:42] others, tell them all the things that
[30:46] you've heard and all the things you've
[30:48] experienced. You know, that's uh you
[30:51] know, so many times we think that we've
[30:54] got to, you know, bring all of our
[30:56] doctrines or all of our teachings or or
[30:59] everything. No, you know, just tell them
[31:01] how your candle got lit. you know, share
[31:05] for them and and witness to them what's
[31:09] real uh to you. And so we've been
[31:12] talking a little bit about influence and
[31:16] and so this morning we mostly emphasize
[31:19] on the fact try to emphasize on the fact
[31:22] that we're influenced
[31:25] and uh you know so uh you know that's
[31:28] that's an important thing because we
[31:30] find out and we heard that somebody's
[31:33] watching you. Somebody watches the way
[31:35] you dress. Somebody uh watching what you
[31:39] say. They watch how you handle things.
[31:43] And and so we wanted to become conscious
[31:47] o of what influences and we uh we
[31:51] brought up a few questions that we
[31:54] should ask. Where does it come from?
[31:56] Where did this start? Uh when did this
[31:59] trend start? Uh what what was the
[32:02] purpose of it? What was the motivation
[32:04] of it? And uh you know and so to uh in
[32:08] the morning I mentioned a little bit on
[32:10] the lines of you know [clears throat]
[32:13] why high high heels where did they come
[32:15] from and the purpose of them when they
[32:19] were brought into fashion what their
[32:22] purpose was and it was to help uh
[32:25] correct give like a a a sex appeal and
[32:29] and and [clears throat] so when you see
[32:31] that you don't try to defend herself.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; You understand that that was an
[32:36] influence that was uh that was imposed
[32:41] upon you.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; You understand? And what happens is once
[32:46] it becomes the trend and it becomes
[32:49] acceptable and it becomes the norm and
[32:53] now everybody does it. [clears throat]
[32:56] That's not what determines whether
[32:58] something is right or not. whether
[33:01] everybody does it, you know what I mean?
[33:04] And [clears throat] I didn't get a
[33:06] chance this morning to get uh you know
[33:08] to bring up jewelry and makeup and and
[33:12] and
[33:14] all the other things that that that you
[33:17] can go you know and and you know and I
[33:21] always you know thought you know that
[33:23] that people
[33:26] they why would they paint their face you
[33:30] know why would they spend hours I think
[33:33] I I I don't go I don't use makeup. But I
[33:36] think that first of all they they have
[33:38] to lay a base or something and then
[33:41] after they base themselves up and then
[33:44] they got to add color and they they you
[33:48] know always scared me to death. I'd go
[33:50] down the road and there'd be some lady
[33:52] in the mirror going
[33:56] you know what I mean? Or have a pencil.
[33:59] You know what I mean? What are they what
[34:00] what is it that they're trying to alter?
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. What what look
[34:07] &gt;&gt; are they trying to achieve? You know
[34:10] what what is that influence? Because
[34:14] influence from the outside
[34:17] if it influences you and it has an
[34:21] effect on you, right? So that's what
[34:24] influence is, right? the ability to uh
[34:28] have power on somebody to affect or
[34:33] change their thinking, to change their
[34:36] actions, to change their beliefs. So
[34:40] influence affects change. So if
[34:44] something can influence you and change
[34:47] you now it's changed your influence
[34:51] because somebody's watching you
[34:55] &gt;&gt; and and that's what happens and people
[34:57] want to succumb
[34:59] to the norm.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? But what they want
[35:05] to succumb to that. So we want to uh
[35:09] [clears throat] talk about
[35:12] uh two things uh to this evening in our
[35:15] Bible study today. Uh we [clears throat]
[35:17] want to talk about what will influence
[35:21] and what will kill
[35:24] influence.
[35:26] And the prophet of God makes this
[35:28] statement here. It says we are here to
[35:33] influence.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; So you you can't you can't say, "Well,
[35:38] I'm just going to get away from
[35:39] influence. I'm I don't care what people
[35:42] think." You know, that's a big one,
[35:44] isn't it?
[35:46] &gt;&gt; I don't [clears throat] care what people
[35:47] think. That's not scriptural.
[35:51] Jesus wanted to know what they thought
[35:53] of him.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Who do men say that I am?
[35:58] And they say, "Well, some say you're
[35:59] this, some say you're that. Some say
[36:02] you're something other than that." He
[36:04] says, "But who do you say I am?
[36:06] &gt;&gt; What kind of influence have
[36:08] [clears throat] I had on you, the ones
[36:11] whom I've chosen?"
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Now that [clears throat] this evening
[36:15] when I say that you are the chosen and
[36:18] elect of God,
[36:20] &gt;&gt; so you've been chosen to hear this
[36:22] message.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; So it's a good question. What kind of
[36:26] influence is this message having on you?
[36:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, if we're all trying to defend
[36:33] our our natures and we're trying to
[36:36] defend our cultures and we're trying to
[36:39] defend our education and we're trying to
[36:42] defend our actions, then it's not
[36:45] speaking too highly of what effect the
[36:49] message has had on us. Amen.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; So we what influence Jesus wants to know
[36:56] and Peter his he was so influenced he
[37:00] said well your influence on us is that
[37:03] thou art the Christ
[37:05] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; And he said Peter flesh and blood have
[37:10] not revealed this to you
[37:12] &gt;&gt; but my father have showed you this. But
[37:16] again, Peter heard Jesus say, "I do
[37:19] nothing till the father shows me first.
[37:22] I'm about my father's business." So they
[37:27] watched him
[37:29] and he had influence on them. They
[37:32] watched when he he brought they Jesus
[37:34] was always being tempted.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; He was always being accused of the
[37:39] devil.
[37:41] You know, they always being called
[37:42] Beelzeub. And and they watched how he
[37:45] handled it. They said, "You are be
[37:47] elabub. You are the devil." He said, "Is
[37:50] a kingdom divided against itself?"
[37:55] You know, if I was a devil, then why am
[37:58] I doing good? You know, a divided
[38:00] kingdom can't stand. You know, he he
[38:04] they they they watched him when they
[38:06] brought the coin to them and said, "Oh,
[38:09] should we pay taxes?" You know who was
[38:12] it better for us to give tribute to God
[38:14] or give tribute to to to Caesar?
[38:19] &gt;&gt; You know, we have this idea that Jesus
[38:22] just walked around just, you know, doing
[38:24] miracles here and miracles there and his
[38:27] life was just rosy. The scripture said
[38:30] he didn't even have a place to lay his
[38:31] head. He was an outcast.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; He was criticized. So they they'd always
[38:39] are trying to trap him. who's and and
[38:41] they watched him sit back. He didn't sit
[38:44] there and argue and scream and he just
[38:47] simply said, "Give me a coin." Whose
[38:50] image is on the coin? Caesars. He says,
[38:52] "Okay." That's his. Give him his.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; But then he comes back. He says, "But
[39:00] give God his
[39:02] &gt;&gt; which is his commandments."
[39:04] &gt;&gt; So he was always they they were able to
[39:06] watch
[39:08] his influence. and and he had influence
[39:13] because he kept the word of God.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; He went into the temple on the Sabbath.
[39:23] You understand? So you can imagine that
[39:26] he had a life that went along with his
[39:29] gospel.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; I always say it this way to myself.
[39:33] Jesus practiced what he preached.
[39:37] So if he said to for us to forgive 70*
[39:42] 70, then I know that he forgives 70* 70.
[39:47] I know that he's just and faithful to
[39:50] forgive our sins if we would confess our
[39:53] sins. He even prayed, "Our Father, which
[39:55] are in heaven, forgive us our trespasses
[39:59] as we forgive those who trespass against
[40:02] us."
[40:03] How many times in in the [clears throat]
[40:06] disciples lives watching the life of
[40:09] Jesus did they did he forgive?
[40:15] &gt;&gt; How how many situations was he put in?
[40:18] How many places in the scripture did
[40:21] they bring him into a meeting or into a
[40:23] a a dinner just to mock him?
[40:28] &gt;&gt; And then he had said, "Simon, I have
[40:30] something against you. You invited me
[40:32] here, but you didn't even wash my feet.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; You know, I've got something against
[40:38] you. But this lady,
[40:41] &gt;&gt; they watched him stand for her
[40:46] &gt;&gt; because she stood for him.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; They they saw that and Jesus said that
[40:53] if you stand for me
[40:56] here on earth, I'll stand for you before
[40:58] my father. But they watch that.
[41:02] They they they witnessed that
[41:05] &gt;&gt; in his life. So we have a stories
[41:08] written here of Jesus. But this this was
[41:11] a life lived.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; You understand it was a life practice.
[41:17] He practiced what he preached.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; So he he was in all the circumstances.
[41:23] He he he was tempted. The the writers
[41:26] wrote it this way. He was tempted in
[41:28] every way that we were tempted. And yet
[41:31] he sinned not.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; They Can you imagine? I I just The only
[41:38] thing I ever thought was if they really
[41:42] knew who he was and what they were
[41:45] seeing.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; But he lived the life.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; You understand? He practiced
[41:54] the life. and and and so we're we're
[41:58] here to influence. So So what are what
[42:03] are the things that will influence?
[42:08] Because we want to be careful how we're
[42:11] influenced
[42:13] because if something changes us then it
[42:16] changes our influence
[42:19] and we want to be changed
[42:22] to be more like him.
[42:25] So, our influence is more like him. And
[42:30] we want to be conscious of that. That
[42:32] was just going over this morning. We
[42:34] want to be conscious of two things. That
[42:37] we're being influenced and that we're
[42:40] influencing.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; So, when our influence, what influences
[42:45] us changes us, it changes how we're
[42:48] influencing. There's no way around that
[42:52] &gt;&gt; there. There's no way around it. I
[42:54] always tell you the story about the the
[42:56] the cars salesman. I went to buy a truck
[42:59] and and and I said, "Well, I'm thinking
[43:02] of a Dodge or a Ford, you know, and the
[43:05] guy just said, "Ah, you don't want a
[43:07] Dodge, you know, and I mean, they're
[43:09] expensive and they're rough and just rip
[43:11] Dodge, you know, just so I mean, you
[43:14] know, I mean, he made Dodge sound like
[43:16] you you drive a Dodge, you know, you're
[43:18] just a
[43:21] I had to get a Ford. Well, you know, so
[43:27] looking around, I I went over to the
[43:28] Dodge dealership and there he was
[43:31] selling Dodges.
[43:36] I said, "Oh." He says, "Well, yeah,
[43:39] yeah. I found out them Fords were no
[43:42] good
[43:44] and and Dodges is the truck,
[43:49] you know, and I thought, well, why, you
[43:50] know, Ford's the most sold truck in
[43:53] America, you know, there's got to be
[43:55] some reason for the switch, right? It
[43:58] had to start someplace. And so you you
[44:01] begin to understand that his now his
[44:04] whole influence changed.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; And so it's important. So what is one of
[44:08] the very first things that will
[44:12] influence
[44:15] and that's the ability to reach across
[44:19] differences.
[44:22] Brother Benham says it he says it this
[44:25] way. He says, "We are here to influence
[44:28] and we'll never be an influence to the
[44:31] outside world as long as we're trying to
[44:34] influence them to some organization
[44:38] because they've been that before we we
[44:41] were born.
[44:44] You understand? So it it's not the
[44:47] influence of trying to get them to see
[44:49] see it your way.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; You understand that? That doesn't create
[44:54] an influence. That creates a resistance.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You're
[45:00] automatically in combat mode.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And we don't want
[45:05] to be in combat mode. That we're we're
[45:07] not here to prove anybody wrong.
[45:12] We're not here to decize anybody. So,
[45:15] we're talking about our fluence. What
[45:17] What is it that we can possess to
[45:21] influence others? And and that's the
[45:24] ability to to lay aside the difference
[45:28] and find that common ground.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Find that find that thing that you can
[45:35] talk about. Set aside the differences,
[45:39] you know, and and and that'll influence.
[45:43] But you know how some people if they
[45:45] don't believe the way you believe, you
[45:46] treat them like poison.
[45:50] I mean, you almost it's it's almost like
[45:53] they don't believe the way you do. They
[45:55] come from a different thought or maybe
[45:57] even within the framework of the
[45:58] message, a different trend in the
[46:00] message, and all of a sudden you you
[46:03] feel like you got the creepy jebies.
[46:06] Anybody know what the creepy jebies are?
[46:09] You ever got that real funny feeling
[46:11] around somebody? You know, like there's
[46:13] just, you know, you're all you're all
[46:16] weary and everything. They're not going
[46:18] to hurt you.
[46:21] You understand what are are we you you
[46:26] can't reach across the aisle if you're
[46:29] afraid of their influence.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; If you're afraid to listen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I got I've got a good
[46:38] friend who's a he he's a a Muslim and
[46:42] he's my soil engineer and they they sell
[46:46] they celebrate uh Ra Ramadama or forgive
[46:51] me if I say that wrong, but that's a
[46:54] time, you know, they fast during the day
[46:56] and then and I bring them a gift
[47:00] and I know it's part of their faith to
[47:02] share their faith and [snorts] I listen
[47:05] to them tell me about about uh his
[47:08] religion and about his faith and and if
[47:13] I show up in his office, no matter how
[47:15] busy he is, I just say, "Tell Sam it's
[47:18] it is David McGary." And you'll hear him
[47:21] say, "Send them in." [snorts] And he'll
[47:23] set all his papers down. He'll quit
[47:25] everything he's doing because he knows
[47:28] I'm going to listen to him.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; And he wants to share his faith. And you
[47:33] know, he tells me about how that they
[47:36] they how they pay their tithing and and
[47:38] and and [snorts]
[47:39] I listen
[47:41] &gt;&gt; and I I'm
[47:44] and at least I keep the door open.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Have I been successful in changing them?
[47:50] No.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Not yet.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; But I like that word.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; So you you you can't shut the door.
[48:02] You've got to reach across the aisle.
[48:04] And so this is what he says. So we're
[48:06] talking about what will influence. He
[48:09] says he says we'll never we'll never
[48:14] we'll never influence them trying to get
[48:17] them to some organization because
[48:19] they've already been that. So we're not
[48:21] going to influence them trying to change
[48:23] them. But let us stand for God
[48:27] &gt;&gt; and his word
[48:29] and fellowship and get all brethren.
[48:33] Let's not draw a line and say
[48:37] if you don't tow it to this,
[48:40] let's reach across the line and be
[48:44] brethren.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a way to have influence. You
[48:49] can't treat people like they're poison.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Poison ivy. You know what I mean? You
[48:55] you you you can't be afraid. And so
[48:58] that's one way that that uh we want to
[49:03] do it. He says, "Now, let's watch
[49:06] what our influence is." So, we want to
[49:09] know what it is that we're trying to
[49:12] influence. So, in order to be effective
[49:15] in influencing, you've got to know what
[49:18] it is you're trying to bring them to,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; what it is you're trying to influence.
[49:23] Watch your influence. Is really our
[49:26] influence should be the love of God.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; That God so loved us.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; That he took the penalty of sin. He so
[49:37] loved us. He was there when we were in
[49:39] the time of struggle. He so loved us
[49:42] that he reached out his hand of grace
[49:45] and mercy. We should know a God that
[49:48] we're representing you. It's not
[49:50] representing your or when brother Bram
[49:52] says organization. What he's saying is
[49:55] you're not representing your creeds,
[49:58] your thinking, your doctrine, your
[50:00] ideas. You're representing him.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; That what we represent. That's what it's
[50:09] the source of our influence. Watch what
[50:12] our influence is. Watch what our source
[50:14] of influence is. We're not trying to get
[50:17] people on our side
[50:19] &gt;&gt; or in our church. We're trying to get
[50:22] them to a bornag again experience of the
[50:25] Lord Jesus Christ that does something
[50:28] for somebody
[50:30] &gt;&gt; and brings the joy of the Lord singing
[50:33] in their heart
[50:34] &gt;&gt; and and then so that that's what will
[50:37] influence
[50:41] &gt;&gt; another thing that will influence
[50:45] is
[50:46] is is he says that's the main
[50:51] being influenced not by what great
[50:54] numbers are, but what a great God that
[50:58] you're representing.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. That great God that
[51:04] you're representing.
[51:05] Not by numbers, not by this. That won't
[51:08] influence anybody.
[51:11] You can say, "Well, we've got this many
[51:13] people coming or we've got this or we
[51:19] Well, the Catholics will look at you and
[51:21] say, you got how many? Two million
[51:23] believers, three million, four million
[51:26] believers. We got 600 million believers
[51:28] in the United States alone.
[51:33] That's not what influences them.
[51:36] You know what I mean? That that's not
[51:38] what it is. It it's it's what a great
[51:42] God we're representing.
[51:45] It's what we're representing is what
[51:48] influences somebody. Like if somebody
[51:51] like we talk about they're representing
[51:53] a product. I I I I'm sure brother
[51:56] Jonathan would would represent his
[51:58] product. Well, I I think it's it's
[52:01] mobile. I think he's mobile Greece or
[52:03] whatever. I'll guarantee you he let you
[52:05] know that mobile Greece
[52:08] is the Greece he represent
[52:11] and he's fortified
[52:14] with specs with tests with testimonies.
[52:21] He he's representing something that's a
[52:25] proven product.
[52:27] Not that other pro products aren't
[52:30] equal. If the products are equal, his
[52:33] service is better.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; He's better looking than that other
[52:38] salesman. Whatever. You know what I'm
[52:40] saying? But it's what you're
[52:42] representing what influences people.
[52:48] You're not going to you're not going to
[52:51] uh uh
[52:55] represent something that doesn't work
[52:59] &gt;&gt; or is no good.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; That's like that truck salesman. He had
[53:03] lost all his all of his influence
[53:08] because he didn't know what he was
[53:10] representing.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; I knew what he was representing. He was
[53:13] representing whatever paycheck he could
[53:15] get.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; But you understand, you're representing
[53:19] something
[53:22] that that's what makes your influence
[53:27] &gt;&gt; strong
[53:29] and you you're called to influence.
[53:32] So it it and he says and so that that's
[53:36] what does it is when you have that
[53:38] influence and you have that influence
[53:41] when you're representing a God that
[53:44] we're representing. You'll have
[53:46] influence when you're representing God.
[53:50] And it goes on to say, "And the kind of
[53:53] life that is in us by him that will
[53:59] influence
[54:01] others."
[54:03] &gt;&gt; The ability to reach across.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Forget the differences.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; You're representing God
[54:11] &gt;&gt; and you have a life in you that's
[54:14] bearing witness to that. that that
[54:17] creates the ability to represent and and
[54:22] that that's that will influence others
[54:25] and then we must never forget that we
[54:28] are the salt of the earth.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; So another thing that causes influence
[54:34] is to be salty
[54:36] &gt;&gt; and and that means to make contact
[54:40] you got to make contact
[54:43] &gt;&gt; with a person. I like the when brother
[54:47] Ram the the the in Mexico when the man
[54:50] came up and and he saw the man and the
[54:53] first thing in his heart he thought well
[54:55] this could be my father.
[54:59] He was making contact.
[55:01] He he he's having sympathy. He he was
[55:05] interested in making contact. He wasn't
[55:07] interested in just making a statement.
[55:13] just not tooting your horn. This is what
[55:16] I believe. Let me tell you what I
[55:18] believe.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; I believe you're wrong. I believe you're
[55:22] an error. I believe you don't interpret
[55:24] the Bible. Well, you're not trying to
[55:26] make contact with that person. In fact,
[55:29] you're pushing them away.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; You're trying to get them to a belief.
[55:35] All these little things tie together.
[55:37] It's a whole approach. It's a whole
[55:40] atmosphere. In fact, really what it is
[55:43] should be in us is the love of God shed
[55:46] abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; So, we're salty.
[55:52] And that means to make contact, make
[55:56] contact with their feelings,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; make contact with their troubles,
[56:00] &gt;&gt; make contact with what their needs are.
[56:06] The scripture says you can't bid
[56:07] somebody's God's speed and send them
[56:09] away hungry.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Well, if you're salty and you make
[56:15] contact, they've got to see you're
[56:17] interested.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I appreciate Jehovah's Witness
[56:23] in their effort that they go doortodoor,
[56:26] but they're not doing that to me.
[56:28] They're putting in their hours.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Because the more hours they put in, the
[56:33] higher their position in the kingdom.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; It's the way they're taught. But thank
[56:40] God they're doing that.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? But you're never
[56:45] going to get them anywhere with arguing
[56:48] with them.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; If you ever do, invite them and ask
[56:52] them, "Is there any sick people in your
[56:55] family?
[56:57] Do you have any trouble with your
[56:59] teenagers?
[57:01] How's your marriage?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[57:06] now
[57:09] you're caring for them.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, you haven't. Let Let me Let me pray.
[57:16] You know, our Lord Jesus can do
[57:18] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[57:20] you can ask or think. It don't hurt to
[57:22] pray for people.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Pray for them. Yes.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Get involved. Oh, that's great. I'm I'm
[57:29] not going to argue with your doctor, but
[57:31] we both are trying to serve a God.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Now, let our God manifest.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Let me pray for you. You need to go and
[57:39] you pray for one of them and they get
[57:40] well.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Remember brother Bram's next door
[57:45] neighbor? He's a Jehovah witness till
[57:48] brother Brandham prayed for his family.
[57:52] Then things changed.
[57:55] So you you see these are the things
[57:59] that make you have influence. But if
[58:02] you're in a if you're a little bulldog
[58:04] and you're fighting and you're arguing
[58:06] with doctrine and you're arguing with
[58:08] religion and you're arguing with that
[58:11] and you're arguing that you'll never
[58:14] you'll never get anywhere. And if and
[58:17] all that's going to do is is hurt you.
[58:20] So you've got to be salty. And and and
[58:24] salty means to
[58:26] is to be make contact
[58:31] to be really interested
[58:34] in their soul
[58:36] in their well-being.
[58:38] These are the things that the prophet of
[58:40] God tells us that will give us. And then
[58:46] being humble and not self-exalted.
[58:52] Those are the things that
[58:55] give us influence and that's what we
[58:58] want to have. And I'll I'll tell you,
[59:00] I've talked to a lot of the people that
[59:02] that were in Brother Bram's meetings
[59:04] that uh that uh had brother Brandham
[59:09] preach for them. And that's the one
[59:12] thing that he did. He was so humble.
[59:16] You know what I mean? And
[59:20] even even when he talked about the
[59:23] Godhead explained and how he told them
[59:25] all those rooms and where everybody
[59:27] would be and how this band would play in
[59:30] here, brother Ben Renham lays the story
[59:32] out like you know I really he laid it on
[59:36] him so sweet,
[59:38] so humble
[59:40] and I always thought of the story and
[59:43] and I I was fortunate enough to talk to
[59:45] Billy Paul about it and other people
[59:48] that were there when that man stood up.
[59:51] Brother Brandham standing right behind
[59:52] the curtain right about where that piano
[59:55] on this side piano and the man stands up
[59:57] there and says, "I'm sorry, brother Bram
[1:00:00] can't speak to us this afternoon. He got
[1:00:02] called out on a sick call and him
[1:00:05] standing right there
[1:00:09] and and I remember talking to that story
[1:00:13] and and he said the brother said to me,
[1:00:15] he said, "Well, you know who that was,
[1:00:16] don't you?" and he began to tell me the
[1:00:18] story and then he would never the other
[1:00:22] brother said brother Bam why don't you
[1:00:23] go out there the brother that said why
[1:00:25] don't you go out there and let him know
[1:00:28] the brother that told asked brother Bram
[1:00:31] that told me brother Ram turned to him
[1:00:33] and said I would never do that to hurt
[1:00:37] that brother's influence
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; that's why brother Brennham had
[1:00:42] influence because he stood for the word
[1:00:47] of God.
[1:00:49] You want to have influence.
[1:00:53] Don't shun away from your influence
[1:00:57] because if you shun away from your
[1:01:00] influence, you're shunning away from
[1:01:02] your duty to God.
[1:01:06] Remember the little logging boy? He was
[1:01:09] going up to the log camp and his mama
[1:01:12] said to him, he says, "Oh, if you go up
[1:01:14] there, it's really rough.
[1:01:17] You know what I mean? They're going to
[1:01:18] treat you bad. They're going to make fun
[1:01:21] of your religion." And then he went up
[1:01:24] there and he come back and his mama
[1:01:27] said, "Son, how did they treat you when
[1:01:30] they found out you were a Christian?" He
[1:01:32] said, "Don't worry, mama. They never
[1:01:34] found out.
[1:01:38] So
[1:01:40] don't shun your influence. Let's just
[1:01:43] take a little moment here if you don't
[1:01:44] mind.
[1:01:46] What will kill
[1:01:48] our influence?
[1:01:53] The things that kill our influence is
[1:01:56] not not standing
[1:02:03] not standing firm.
[1:02:07] He says, "And when we lose our influence
[1:02:10] as father, as mother, as Christian, as a
[1:02:13] businessman, as a minister, when we lose
[1:02:16] our influence with people, now we can be
[1:02:19] very popular in the line of the world
[1:02:22] and go along with the world." But I mean
[1:02:26] as what we represent, we represent
[1:02:30] Christ.
[1:02:32] So, it's the influence that we have for
[1:02:36] what we represent
[1:02:38] that we're talking about losing. Not
[1:02:41] your friendships,
[1:02:43] not those things, but we want to be
[1:02:46] influential
[1:02:48] in what we represent.
[1:02:51] And that's why so many times when people
[1:02:54] misinterpret the message of the hour or
[1:02:57] they put their own interpretation on it
[1:03:00] or they come up with things that they
[1:03:02] think brother Brandham's saying it it
[1:03:05] the influence
[1:03:07] leaves
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; and they wonder why they can't spread
[1:03:11] the gospel. They wonder why there's just
[1:03:14] a few of them that believe that way. And
[1:03:18] and here's some of the reasons why. This
[1:03:20] is what he said. He said,
[1:03:24] he says, "But I mean as what we
[1:03:26] represent,
[1:03:28] oh Christ, when we lose our influence as
[1:03:32] that as standing out,
[1:03:36] we can't. How can we blend in with the
[1:03:39] day when God is against the day?"
[1:03:44] And so one of the reasons that we lose
[1:03:47] our influence is because we don't want
[1:03:49] to stand out.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; But you stand out.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; You can't help but stand out. Right.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And and and that's not a bad thing to
[1:04:05] stand out
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; when you have all the other parts of
[1:04:12] being fluential down. The right spirit,
[1:04:15] the right attitude, the right nature,
[1:04:18] the right objective, the right motive,
[1:04:20] the right representation, the life of
[1:04:23] God in you, you can't shun away from
[1:04:27] standing out. People lose their
[1:04:29] influence when they don't stand out.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; And I I looked a little bit about all
[1:04:36] these influencer. Everybody's got some
[1:04:40] sort of trick.
[1:04:43] I saw a picture of a guy and he's got
[1:04:47] uh jewelry coming down his nose like
[1:04:50] this on the side of his face and he
[1:04:52] wears great big long fingernails and
[1:04:56] he's got these big he wears earrings and
[1:04:58] and he's just, you know, all marked up
[1:05:01] and everything. What What's he trying to
[1:05:03] He's trying to stand out
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; so he can influence.
[1:05:09] Right?
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And everybody's got some little show,
[1:05:13] some little gimmick, some way to stand
[1:05:15] out because you're if you don't stand
[1:05:18] out, you don't have any influence. Well,
[1:05:21] our standing out is standing out for
[1:05:23] what we believe. Standing out for
[1:05:25] Christ, standing out for keeping the
[1:05:27] principles, standing out being honest,
[1:05:30] standing out being kind, being friendly.
[1:05:35] But you stand out and you can't shun
[1:05:38] away from standing out or taking a
[1:05:42] stand.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. You got to be wise.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; There's a a season and a time for
[1:05:52] everything.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; I don't think you ought to testify on
[1:05:56] somebody else's money.
[1:06:00] I go on jobs and my workers, they'd be I
[1:06:04] said, "Well, you didn't get nothing
[1:06:05] done." "Oh, but I was testifying."
[1:06:07] "No, you weren't testifying. You were
[1:06:09] robbing me.
[1:06:13] You know, if I I wanted to pay you to
[1:06:16] testify, I'd have sent you for
[1:06:18] seminary."
[1:06:20] Don't testify on the job. Work.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Let your light shine. Stick to your
[1:06:25] duty.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; There's a time and a season for
[1:06:30] everything.
[1:06:32] You know what I mean? But when you're
[1:06:34] faithful on the job, you're faithful to
[1:06:36] that boss. You're serving that person
[1:06:38] that gives you that paycheck at lunch
[1:06:40] break. If you want to testify, fine. But
[1:06:43] don't burn up somebody else's time.
[1:06:48] It won't have any influence.
[1:06:51] The guy that's watching you, he knows
[1:06:54] what you're doing. You think, "Oh, I'm
[1:06:58] testifying." I know he's saying this
[1:07:00] guy's a feather better.
[1:07:03] He'd rather talk than work. [snorts]
[1:07:08] You know, it's hard to make a stand,
[1:07:11] but you got to stand the prophet of God.
[1:07:15] You got to stand out that you represent
[1:07:18] Christ. You don't represent him in the
[1:07:21] way the world does. We don't represent
[1:07:23] Christianity the way the world
[1:07:26] represents Christianity. [snorts]
[1:07:30] And I can name a lot of famous people
[1:07:33] uh great quarterbacks and people that
[1:07:36] they they'll come up and they're they're
[1:07:38] they'll they'll come right up and say uh
[1:07:41] they maybe they win the World Series and
[1:07:43] they'll get on the mic and say, "The
[1:07:44] first thing I want to do is give all the
[1:07:46] glory
[1:07:47] to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
[1:07:51] You know what I say to that? Amen.
[1:07:55] He deserves all the glory. I'm not
[1:07:58] opposed to that. I'm not going to get
[1:08:00] ruined my day because somebody doesn't
[1:08:04] believe the message the way I believe
[1:08:06] and I can't rejoice with them.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I just feel what God's given me is
[1:08:16] better than any World Series. Would I
[1:08:18] trade this for a World Series? Would I
[1:08:21] trade this for a Super Bowl?
[1:08:24] I wouldn't trade what God's done for me
[1:08:26] for nothing.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; But you you you lose your influence
[1:08:33] when you lose the ability to stand out.
[1:08:38] And that's what he says. when you don't
[1:08:40] represent when we lose our influence as
[1:08:44] that as standing out.
[1:08:48] So when you lose that influence of what
[1:08:51] you represent, that's another thing. The
[1:08:53] other thing that that kills your your
[1:08:58] influence is pride.
[1:09:01] That that's that's uh one of the the
[1:09:05] things that that happens is when you get
[1:09:09] lifted up. He says the way up is down.
[1:09:13] How do we know which way is up or down?
[1:09:18] [snorts] Oh, that I've I've read that
[1:09:20] for years. I just love it because he
[1:09:23] says because the world stands in space.
[1:09:26] How do you know which way is up or down?
[1:09:30] How many believe the South Pole is down?
[1:09:37] No, it's not. The South Pole is up and
[1:09:41] the North Pole is down.
[1:09:48] What side of the equator you on?
[1:09:51] You know, water in the sink goes one way
[1:09:53] on one side of the equator and the
[1:09:56] opposite way on the other side of the
[1:09:57] equator.
[1:10:02] Tell me, explain now which is right and
[1:10:04] which is left.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; I remember I had lunch with brother Tim
[1:10:08] one day and he was he was explaining to
[1:10:10] me how those nuclear submarines the
[1:10:13] earth has a magnetic field and they can
[1:10:16] get right in those magnetic field lines
[1:10:19] and absolutely been totally hidden
[1:10:23] because of the magnetism of the earth.
[1:10:26] And then he looked across the table and
[1:10:28] says, "I've given you the secrets. Now
[1:10:30] I'm now I'm going to have to kill you."
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; There's a way to know
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; the up that we want
[1:10:42] is up in him,
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; up in his nature, up in his spirit, up
[1:10:48] in his life. So I just thought that was
[1:10:51] always interesting. He says he says
[1:10:54] which way is up or down. So always
[1:11:01] don't don't miss those little things. So
[1:11:04] always
[1:11:05] what does always mean? It means always.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; He that humbleth himself, God will
[1:11:14] exalt.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; All ways.
[1:11:19] He that exalts himself, God will
[1:11:25] bring a to a God will bring to a base.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; He will bring him down.
[1:11:33] Always keep humble and be little in your
[1:11:38] own sight.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Be little in your own sight. Know that
[1:11:44] everything you have is because of him.
[1:11:47] No matter what God does for you,
[1:11:51] just see how much more humbler you can
[1:11:57] be all the time. The more God blesses
[1:12:02] you,
[1:12:04] just keep getting more humble all the
[1:12:09] time. He can continue to bless.
[1:12:13] But when you get to the place you think
[1:12:17] I've got it,
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; you haven't got it and you're on your
[1:12:26] road out.
[1:12:29] That's right. See, you lose your
[1:12:33] influence. You lose your strength
[1:12:37] of your testimony.
[1:12:41] There's nothing that turns somebody off
[1:12:44] but somebody that thinks that they've
[1:12:47] got it.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; They can be right
[1:12:52] and you ain't gonna take it.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; You are, you know, especially men that
[1:13:02] male ego just goes to battle. You know
[1:13:06] what I mean? You come on to somebody
[1:13:08] like I've got it, you ain't. They're
[1:13:11] ready to fight
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; that that minute that pride steps in.
[1:13:15] I've got this revelation. I see this
[1:13:18] message. I believe it that way. I I've
[1:13:21] got something you ain't got.
[1:13:24] You're on your way out.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; You might as well just stop and look at
[1:13:30] that guy and say,
[1:13:33] "You're out."
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Because you're on your way out.
[1:13:38] You've lost your influence.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; You're out. You're out of his life.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; You're out of his door. He's closing the
[1:13:47] door to you.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; You've ended it right there. There's
[1:13:51] nothing that that that
[1:13:54] kills influence more than than uh
[1:14:01] than lack of humility.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Just a
[1:14:08] uh any type of prideful
[1:14:12] attitude will just uh uh immediately
[1:14:17] take something.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; So, you've got to know that God has
[1:14:21] ordained certain things to be done and
[1:14:23] it must be done that way. And we're not
[1:14:26] to inject our own ideas. We're to
[1:14:29] represent his ideas and his
[1:14:32] commandments.
[1:14:33] So, the minute you get to where you
[1:14:35] think you're re
[1:14:37] you're injecting something or you've got
[1:14:40] something to do and you lose that
[1:14:41] humility. You've lost your influence.
[1:14:45] You say, "Why are you saying this?"
[1:14:47] Because the whole purpose that we
[1:14:49] started this year was to get a path
[1:14:52] forward to turn our hearts from arguing
[1:14:57] about differences in the message to
[1:14:59] whether who's got the Holy Ghost and who
[1:15:02] doesn't have the Holy Ghost. I know one
[1:15:04] thing. If you've repented of your sins
[1:15:07] and you've been baptized in the name of
[1:15:09] the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall receive
[1:15:12] the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I can't educate you in it. I can't
[1:15:17] browbeat you in it.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; You're going to get the Holy Ghost one
[1:15:20] way or the other. You can do it two
[1:15:23] ways. You can spend months and months
[1:15:25] crying at the altar, give me the Holy
[1:15:28] Ghost. Give me the Holy Ghost. You'll
[1:15:29] get it.
[1:15:31] Or you can sit in your seat and say,
[1:15:33] "God promised me the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:15:35] going to get it."
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Both ways will get you there.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; But faith is the best way.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And believe it or not, I think it's the
[1:15:46] fastest way.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "So that settled it. I meant
[1:15:50] the requirements. I'm going to get it."
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; And it's a mystery how you can have the
[1:15:55] Holy Ghost without sensation. Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I was in a swap meet one day walking
[1:16:03] down and I got in the section. I was
[1:16:05] looking at all the army badges and all
[1:16:07] the buttons and everything and
[1:16:10] I I just remembered I've been burdened
[1:16:12] and bothered by his spirit for a very
[1:16:15] long time and all of a sudden
[1:16:18] I noticed it was gone.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; In the middle of a swap mate.
[1:16:23] It one of the very few times I've ever
[1:16:26] been down to Trader Village. [snorts] I
[1:16:28] don't like the name of that place. You
[1:16:30] know, Trader Village. It's where all the
[1:16:32] traders go.
[1:16:35] Not that kind of trader, but you know
[1:16:36] what I mean. I I just remember it.
[1:16:40] It came in his season.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; You believe God.
[1:16:48] And that's why we keep saying don't put
[1:16:51] faith in the accusations. [snorts]
[1:16:53] Accusations of Satan [clears throat]
[1:16:55] about you are trying to influence you.
[1:16:59] Because if he can influence you, it
[1:17:02] changes your influence.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; If he can get you to say, "I don't have
[1:17:07] the Holy Ghost. I need the Holy Ghost."
[1:17:11] That influence has a whole different
[1:17:13] effect than saying, "I'm going to get
[1:17:15] the Holy Ghost. I'm promised the Holy
[1:17:17] Ghost.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; I believe it's real
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; and I believe it's mine to have
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; and I believe the spirit of God's going
[1:17:26] to come on me. I believe the love of God
[1:17:29] is going to be a shed abroad in my heart
[1:17:31] by the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm going to love my neighbor.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm going to be able to turn
[1:17:37] the other cheek. I believe I'm going to
[1:17:39] be able to go the extra mile. I believe
[1:17:42] I don't have to worry about whether I'm
[1:17:45] going to be fed because the righteous
[1:17:46] shall never bake bread. And it's a whole
[1:17:49] different influence when you take the
[1:17:51] influence of God's word over the
[1:17:54] accusations of Satan. But if you believe
[1:17:57] the accusations of Satan, you're giving
[1:18:00] life to that influence.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And we read it this morning. First of
[1:18:05] all, it's got to be believed in your
[1:18:07] mind. And you've got to accept it in
[1:18:10] your mind. Right?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; That's where the battle is.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; So you first of all, you've got to
[1:18:15] accept the accusation that you're a
[1:18:18] devil sinner
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; in your mind.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And then when you accept it in your
[1:18:24] mind, then you believe it with your
[1:18:26] heart
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; and it gains life.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; The same things with the promises
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; God said you never did it in the first
[1:18:36] place.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place.
[1:18:40] Sing says, "Yes, you do. I got it right
[1:18:44] here on my record."
[1:18:47] December
[1:18:50] 1971,
[1:18:53] July 23rd,
[1:18:56] that guy pulled in front of you on the
[1:18:58] road and you cussed him out.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; No, I didn't.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you didn't.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Find it, Satan.
[1:19:13] He said, "Well, it's on my record.
[1:19:16] Your record isn't zipped to me.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; It's it's in the sea of God's
[1:19:23] forgetfulness.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And God don't even remember it."
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Who you going to believe?
[1:19:30] Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; You see, so that it's so important
[1:19:36] what's influencing you
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; because what's influencing you affects
[1:19:41] your influence on others.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; And so we want to we don't want to we
[1:19:46] don't want to kill influence. And what
[1:19:48] kills influence is not standing out.
[1:19:52] If you're just like everybody else
[1:19:54] blending into the world, running with
[1:19:56] the crowd, the prophet of God says no
[1:19:58] influence for the cause of Christ.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; We don't care about worldly influence.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; We're talking about godly influence.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; He said he he says you don't stand out.
[1:20:11] If you're proud and you lack humility
[1:20:15] and you're arrogant,
[1:20:18] that just shuts it down.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; I I just can't even comprehend how
[1:20:25] humble Jesus must have been.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Why if no wonder he said power
[1:20:35] apart from character is satanic. I would
[1:20:38] hate to think think if if I was,
[1:20:44] you know, what I would have done before
[1:20:46] I was a Christian. Let's put it that
[1:20:48] way. Because I would have taken my
[1:20:49] little finger and just zapped them. Zip.
[1:20:53] Zip.
[1:20:54] Where's the Pharisee? We can't find him
[1:20:57] nowhere.
[1:21:00] Brother David turned him into a pile of
[1:21:02] ashes.
[1:21:03] Not Not Jesus. He forgave all their
[1:21:06] sins. Father, forgive them for they know
[1:21:09] not what they do. What humility, what
[1:21:12] compassion. In fact, the scripture says
[1:21:14] he humbled himself
[1:21:16] [cough]
[1:21:17] even under the death of the cross.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; So nothing kills your influence like
[1:21:23] pride and we we could read it here and
[1:21:27] and and we were we were reading it. He
[1:21:32] he says it'll bring them down. He says,
[1:21:35] he says you lose the strength of your
[1:21:38] testimony.
[1:21:40] So always be mindful of that. The other
[1:21:43] thing that that that
[1:21:46] kills our influence, he says, now
[1:21:49] referring back to our sisters, no matter
[1:21:53] what other women does, God has got your
[1:21:56] pattern in here.
[1:21:59] So you you can't you'll lose your
[1:22:02] influence if you break the pattern of
[1:22:05] the scriptures,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; which is what? When you're reviled,
[1:22:11] revile not.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; How many times do we someone accuses us
[1:22:16] and we immediately break into defense?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; And our defense becomes a trap.
[1:22:26] I'll tell you one of the greatest things
[1:22:28] that you can ever do if you're falsely
[1:22:30] accused is just said, you know
[1:22:32] something, you forgive me. I would never
[1:22:36] mean in my heart to hurt anybody. I'm
[1:22:39] sorry you misunderstand. I'll do my best
[1:22:43] to try to make sure that I'm not
[1:22:46] misunderstood again.
[1:22:49] Stay with the pattern.
[1:22:52] You got to stay with the scriptural
[1:22:54] pattern. People are reading this Bible.
[1:22:58] People know what a Christian should do.
[1:23:01] They know how they should act. You can't
[1:23:04] say one thing and live something else.
[1:23:08] It hurts your influence. It takes a long
[1:23:11] time. I've never been one that was ever
[1:23:14] able to make a good impression.
[1:23:17] So sometimes I would have to rely that I
[1:23:21] know in my heart that I I I I want to do
[1:23:26] right by somebody and if if you do it
[1:23:30] it'll it'll come out if you stay in the
[1:23:33] pattern. And I've told you the story of
[1:23:36] when I was in the supply house and it's
[1:23:38] I know this isn't about me but it means
[1:23:40] something to me is that when all of a
[1:23:43] sudden this great big guy come up. He's
[1:23:46] a big guy you know and I thought uh oh I
[1:23:50] must have parked in his spot or
[1:23:54] got his truck and he come over to me
[1:23:56] just sed up to me and looked at me and
[1:23:58] he said are you David McGary? And I said
[1:24:02] yes sir. I said, "I am." He says, "You
[1:24:05] don't remember me." He says, "But I've
[1:24:08] been looking for you for two years." I
[1:24:10] thought, "Oh,
[1:24:12] what have I done?" [clears throat]
[1:24:16] You know, I kind of moved a few steps
[1:24:18] back because I had to get about four
[1:24:20] steps back to see him eyes. You know
[1:24:22] what I mean? And he says, "You don't
[1:24:25] remember, but I was on the job with you
[1:24:28] at Texas Instruments."
[1:24:30] And he I just used the words he used, if
[1:24:34] you forgive me. He said, "We gave you
[1:24:37] literal hell out there."
[1:24:40] And I thought, "Well, it's no problem. I
[1:24:43] understand." And all of a sudden, this
[1:24:46] guy started balling,
[1:24:48] tears
[1:24:49] running down his face. And he said, "You
[1:24:53] know what?" He said, "I gave my heart to
[1:24:56] the Lord." and he's a youth minister now
[1:24:59] at a goodsized Baptist church in Berles.
[1:25:04] And he said, "I always I always wanted
[1:25:06] to find you and tell you how sorry I
[1:25:10] was." He wanted me to go down there and
[1:25:13] and and testify and and and everything.
[1:25:18] You know what I mean? And you say,
[1:25:20] "Well, what did you do?" I just tried to
[1:25:22] stay in the pattern. [snorts]
[1:25:26] I don't always in the pattern and when I
[1:25:29] get out of pattern I repent.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; I say, "Father, forgive me." But you'll
[1:25:36] you'll you'll lose your influence if you
[1:25:39] don't try to stay in the pattern.
[1:25:42] [snorts]
[1:25:43] You you understand you you can't you
[1:25:47] can't be one way one day
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; and one way the other day.
[1:25:53] You can't be back and forth, in and out.
[1:25:56] [snorts] Influence is something that
[1:25:59] it's like character. It's earned in the
[1:26:02] fiery furnace of affliction. You earn
[1:26:04] your influence.
[1:26:07] Time after time after time, people see
[1:26:10] you acting in the same way. You don't
[1:26:14] leave a pattern. So, in order to have
[1:26:17] influence, you have to have a pattern.
[1:26:20] Timothy sp it this way. Lay for yourself
[1:26:23] a pattern
[1:26:25] of good works.
[1:26:27] Too many of our lives don't have a
[1:26:29] pattern. [snorts] We don't have a
[1:26:31] pattern of good works. We don't have a
[1:26:34] pattern of giving. [snorts]
[1:26:37] We don't have a we we're not loyal to a
[1:26:40] pattern. When we get when we get our
[1:26:43] income, whatever it is of God, we don't
[1:26:45] set our part for God a aside first.
[1:26:50] It's hit and miss.
[1:26:52] Maybe we give offerings and maybe if our
[1:26:55] rent is due and we can't make this
[1:26:57] bills, then we put things off. You know
[1:27:01] what I mean? We we don't have a pattern.
[1:27:03] And if you don't have a pattern and you
[1:27:06] don't stay with God's pattern, you've
[1:27:08] got an in you lose your influence.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; But you get a guy that's on the job when
[1:27:14] he says he'll be there.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; You walk into the doctor's office and
[1:27:19] you say, "I'm sorry. I'm a minute
[1:27:21] early."
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's hard. I get
[1:27:30] mad at doctors.
[1:27:33] I sit in that little jail cell for 35
[1:27:37] minutes and I don't need a doctor. I
[1:27:40] need a psychiatrist.
[1:27:43] And he comes mosying in, you know, like
[1:27:47] who are you?
[1:27:50] You know, but you just sit back. No, how
[1:27:53] are you doing today? I guess you must
[1:27:55] really be busy to let me sit here 45
[1:27:57] minutes.
[1:27:59] No, you just smile. You know what I
[1:28:01] mean? Thank you, doctor. Appreciate what
[1:28:03] you're doing and everything. What I
[1:28:06] really want to do is, doctor, I'm going
[1:28:07] to be there when you tell me to be
[1:28:09] there. If you're not there, you're
[1:28:11] paying me.
[1:28:14] Now, how much influence would I have on
[1:28:16] that doctor?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Zero.
[1:28:20] But my doctor asked me what I preached,
[1:28:23] asked me how I going, sat down and
[1:28:25] talked to me because he lost his father
[1:28:28] just instantly out of the middle of
[1:28:29] nowhere and he was working it through
[1:28:32] because he feels the other doctors let
[1:28:34] him down. You understand? If you stay
[1:28:37] with the scriptural pattern, I'm not
[1:28:39] pointing to me. I'm just trying the I
[1:28:40] only got instances of influence that I
[1:28:44] might personally know about
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; and I you know and I I'm telling you
[1:28:48] what I what I wanted to do. But
[1:28:52] sometimes what we want to do isn't
[1:28:54] according to the pattern of scripture.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And if he can get you out of the
[1:28:59] pattern, he's done the very thing that
[1:29:01] Satan wants to do. And that's make the
[1:29:03] word of God of none effect. And you are
[1:29:07] the word of God for this age.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; It's word being revealed in word.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; It's what he says in the back of this
[1:29:20] book. And so we understand that. I'm I'm
[1:29:22] going to close and move on. In other
[1:29:24] words, you get out of the pattern. Get
[1:29:26] out of your calling
[1:29:30] [snorts]
[1:29:30] is is another thing.
[1:29:34] If you're called to do a certain thing,
[1:29:36] stay in your calling.
[1:29:40] You know, if you're called to testify,
[1:29:42] stay in it. Don't try to be something
[1:29:44] you're not. You You might not think it
[1:29:47] is, but it's the person on the outside.
[1:29:50] They can tell you right instantly
[1:29:57] how much hot air
[1:29:59] you've got coming out of you
[1:30:02] because you're out of your calling. You
[1:30:05] don't know what you're talking about.
[1:30:07] Have you ever met somebody who's an
[1:30:09] expert on everything? Let me tell you
[1:30:13] how to put that bolt on. Let me tell you
[1:30:15] how to move this machine. Let me tell
[1:30:16] you how to run this pipe. Let me tell
[1:30:19] you how to do this. They've always got a
[1:30:21] better way to do it.
[1:30:26] Influence is over.
[1:30:29] That person has zero influence. [snorts]
[1:30:34] Well, I was visiting with brother James
[1:30:36] Hayes and we were talking about a
[1:30:39] airplane.
[1:30:41] I think it was either Japanese or Korean
[1:30:43] airline. The pilot was driving the plane
[1:30:46] into the ground
[1:30:49] and nobody in the cockpit
[1:30:53] had the nerve
[1:30:55] to stand up and resist him when he was
[1:30:58] wrong.
[1:31:05] They didn't have any influence.
[1:31:07] They'd sold their influence out
[1:31:11] because
[1:31:14] It it just a tragedy. They had to re
[1:31:17] take all the pilots and everything and
[1:31:21] re educate them
[1:31:24] on the danger
[1:31:27] of unsafe
[1:31:30] and unprofessional
[1:31:32] patterns.
[1:31:34] You don't want to get in a pattern
[1:31:37] that's contrary to the word of God.
[1:31:41] You want to have influence, stay in the
[1:31:45] pattern of God's word. God will make
[1:31:48] sure you have influence. Satan's always
[1:31:52] looking for a reason to check you off.
[1:31:57] And then the other thing is don't get
[1:31:59] out of your calling.
[1:32:03] Stay where he put you. Stay in the
[1:32:06] realms he put you in.
[1:32:09] and your calling is wherever he called
[1:32:11] you. However he dealt with your heart.
[1:32:13] So that's an another great thing he says
[1:32:19] here. He says, "Now watch my brethren.
[1:32:21] Be careful there because no matter how
[1:32:24] much God has filled you with his spirit,
[1:32:27] how much that you have done and how well
[1:32:31] you've been blessed,
[1:32:33] you stay with the calling of God.
[1:32:39] That's another way you lose influence.
[1:32:42] And one of the last ways that we lose
[1:32:46] influence is not to take correction.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Is not to take correction. [snorts] I
[1:32:55] preach about high heels and you're going
[1:32:58] to come back. Oh, that's culture. That's
[1:33:00] this. And he doesn't say anything about
[1:33:02] jewelry.
[1:33:03] I have a lot to say about jewelry. I
[1:33:06] don't believe in rings on your toes and
[1:33:09] bells in your nose.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I I I just don't
[1:33:18] believe in a lot of those things. You
[1:33:21] want to wear a brace. I don't believe in
[1:33:23] bracelets all the way up to your elbow.
[1:33:27] I can tell you all kinds of things that
[1:33:29] I believe. [snorts]
[1:33:32] telling my beliefs isn't what gives
[1:33:35] influence. [snorts]
[1:33:40] It's when you look at my wife
[1:33:44] and you see what how much jewelry does
[1:33:46] she put in? Huh? What what is the
[1:33:49] reflection? What is it? Each one of you
[1:33:51] have a standard. That's your standard to
[1:33:55] make. [snorts]
[1:33:57] The scripture says don't be adorned with
[1:33:59] things,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; you know, hair braided in. And now, you
[1:34:03] know, we we not used to do it, but now
[1:34:05] we find people got all kinds of like
[1:34:08] gold and silver and all kinds of stuff
[1:34:11] in their hair. And and what's happening?
[1:34:14] We leave the pattern and we don't take
[1:34:17] the correction.
[1:34:20] Well, you don't have to take the
[1:34:22] correction,
[1:34:24] but the price of it is losing your
[1:34:27] influence.
[1:34:31] Remember the boy in trial?
[1:34:33] And he he told the judge,
[1:34:36] he said, "Your honor, I want to stand on
[1:34:38] my record." [snorts] And the judge said,
[1:34:41] "That's a problem, son. You don't have a
[1:34:43] record. [snorts]
[1:34:45] You don't have a testimony.
[1:34:47] You don't have a pattern of good works.
[1:34:50] You don't have nothing. In other words,
[1:34:53] son, you got zero influence. [snorts]
[1:34:56] But if that guy would have stood up
[1:34:58] there and said, "I served 25 years in
[1:35:00] the military.
[1:35:02] I have a Purple Heart.
[1:35:05] I have a a gold star,
[1:35:08] silver star, I have the Congressional
[1:35:11] Medal of Honor.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry that I ran that stop sign. You
[1:35:19] know what that judge is going to do?
[1:35:22] Dismiss, sir. Thank you for your
[1:35:24] service.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Well, we got a judge.
[1:35:28] [snorts]
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; And if you got a record of good works,
[1:35:31] you got a record of service, you got a
[1:35:34] record of praying for your brother, you
[1:35:36] got a record of not being selfish, and
[1:35:38] you do something wrong, you know what
[1:35:40] the judge is going to do? I forgive you.
[1:35:42] thrown in the sea of God forgiveness.
[1:35:45] Go on my brother, remember it no more.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; But if you don't take correction,
[1:35:54] listen to what he says.
[1:35:56] You say, "Well, what do you mean
[1:35:59] leprosy?" Leprosy
[1:36:01] represents
[1:36:04] is a type rather of sin. Now listen.
[1:36:09] And when a man won't stand correction by
[1:36:13] the word of God, he is full of leprosy,
[1:36:17] blows up and carries on.
[1:36:21] What
[1:36:23] does you what do you do? You ruin your
[1:36:29] influence.
[1:36:31] [snorts]
[1:36:32] If you don't take correction, you ruin
[1:36:35] your influence. People [snorts] hear the
[1:36:38] correction.
[1:36:40] They know what's right. And they see you
[1:36:42] won't take it. And there's nothing that
[1:36:45] kills a man's influence like justifying
[1:36:48] sin.
[1:36:51] Justifying unbelief. I've talked to
[1:36:53] people whose doctrines are so off the
[1:36:56] word of God and they just sit there and
[1:36:59] they justify it. They won't take
[1:37:01] correction and pretty soon they lose all
[1:37:04] their power.
[1:37:06] They've lost all their influence
[1:37:09] because they won't take correction.
[1:37:12] If someone corrects you and you're not
[1:37:14] sure, I'll pray about it. [snorts]
[1:37:20] I got it laid on me the other night. I
[1:37:23] went [snorts] out to a bonfire and I I
[1:37:26] drove down there and I I didn't want to
[1:37:27] walk down there. I can't see very good
[1:37:29] at night. So I pulled down farther on
[1:37:31] the the grass and and down there and all
[1:37:35] of a sudden someone knocked on my
[1:37:36] window. They don't want us parking on
[1:37:38] the grass.
[1:37:40] Thank goodness I didn't know who it was.
[1:37:42] [snorts]
[1:37:43] But I know the first thing in my mind
[1:37:45] said, "Do you know who I am?"
[1:37:50] Well, they probably did.
[1:37:52] I could have said, "Well, I'll park here
[1:37:55] if I want to. In fact, I'll just drive
[1:37:58] right up to the bonfire.
[1:38:02] All that stuff
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; is going in the battleground.
[1:38:08] You know who who are you to tell me
[1:38:12] where I can park?
[1:38:15] I don't know who you are, but when I
[1:38:18] find out,
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; no.
[1:38:24] I said, "Oh, I'm sorry." And I got in my
[1:38:27] truck and I drove and I parked up and
[1:38:30] walked down. [snorts]
[1:38:34] You say that's little. Yeah, but it was
[1:38:38] correction. [snorts]
[1:38:43] I could have made that guy feel bad
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; and I wanted it.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; But if you don't take correction, you
[1:38:53] lose your influence.
[1:38:56] So, can you imagine sitting in a
[1:38:58] congregation, the word of God comes
[1:39:01] forth,
[1:39:02] preaches against something that's sin,
[1:39:06] and the first thing you're out in the
[1:39:07] parking lot defending your position.
[1:39:13] You've lost it.
[1:39:16] Go on, live your life. [snorts]
[1:39:19] But you've lost your influence for the
[1:39:22] cause of Christ. All of our influence is
[1:39:25] what? For the cause of Christ, for the
[1:39:28] furtherance of the gospel.
[1:39:32] Correction alters your course.
[1:39:35] Correction influences you that your
[1:39:38] influence
[1:39:40] becomes greater.
[1:39:42] Really, correction is not about you
[1:39:44] doing the wrong. It's about the wrong.
[1:39:49] The influence the wrong in your life is
[1:39:51] having.
[1:39:53] The wrong is not even laid to your
[1:39:56] charge. Who can lay anything? I hope
[1:39:59] you're getting this. This is a deep
[1:40:01] revelation.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; So deep it seems shallow.
[1:40:08] It's the influence that he's they're
[1:40:11] trying to correct.
[1:40:13] The sin itself is in the sea of God's
[1:40:15] forgetfulness.
[1:40:17] But the action and the attitude is
[1:40:20] having influence.
[1:40:21] So the correction is everybody parks
[1:40:25] there but I park here. Bad influence.
[1:40:32] That's what the corrections for. It's to
[1:40:35] correct what you're doing and what your
[1:40:39] attitude is, what you're representing,
[1:40:42] how you're presenting yourself. Whether
[1:40:45] it's a bad spirit, whether it's anger,
[1:40:48] whatever it is, it's there to present
[1:40:51] itself
[1:40:53] to change your influence
[1:40:56] because you're going to be judged on the
[1:41:00] other side for your influence,
[1:41:07] your character,
[1:41:10] the light you shine, the path you
[1:41:13] showed.
[1:41:15] And so he goes on to say, like he said,
[1:41:17] it's leprosy. It blows up. What does it
[1:41:20] what does it do? Ruins your influence.
[1:41:24] Something happens. People knows
[1:41:28] and can tell the word that you're
[1:41:32] corrected by that you're not going to do
[1:41:35] it. Therefore, you ruin your
[1:41:40] influence.
[1:41:44] How important is the correction of the
[1:41:47] word of God? Who does he correct?
[1:41:50] Those he loves.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; See that? That's what I love about the
[1:41:56] gospel. We're all in the same boat.
[1:41:59] [snorts] It applies to me. It applies to
[1:42:02] you. It applies to all of us.
[1:42:05] There's no big eyes and there's only
[1:42:08] you. It's not what we can do. It's what
[1:42:11] God can do. It's not how great we are.
[1:42:14] It's how great he is. Everything gets
[1:42:17] back to the cause. Everything gets back
[1:42:20] to the purpose. Why do we do lay a
[1:42:23] pattern of good works? To glorify our
[1:42:25] father in heaven. Why do we forgive?
[1:42:29] Because it shows that we were forgiven.
[1:42:32] Everything is about glorifying him. And
[1:42:35] then the last thing I'll just put this
[1:42:37] maybe maybe
[1:42:40] not taking correction should be the last
[1:42:42] thing but the other thing is when you're
[1:42:46] always influenced
[1:42:48] by
[1:42:51] by
[1:42:53] the things that influence you keep
[1:42:55] changing.
[1:42:57] Brother Brandham puts it this way. He
[1:42:59] says that things he says that we got it
[1:43:04] the other fellow hasn't got nothing to
[1:43:06] do with it. That is being influenced by
[1:43:11] the higher ups.
[1:43:15] Many times we get influenced by what in
[1:43:19] our mind we think is the higherups, the
[1:43:22] people with influence, the ministers
[1:43:25] that come by and maybe a a a minister of
[1:43:29] reputation or a minister that's got a
[1:43:32] tremendous gift.
[1:43:35] He comes in and he preaches a message
[1:43:37] and and and his personality, his nature,
[1:43:41] what he is. And I'm not saying he's
[1:43:42] saying anything wrong, but you're
[1:43:44] influenced by the man.
[1:43:49] And then you run that line for a while.
[1:43:52] And then somebody else comes in and he's
[1:43:54] majoring in in another point.
[1:43:58] And then you get under that influence
[1:44:00] and you run that line for a while.
[1:44:04] And we've had it for years in the
[1:44:06] message.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; This movement comes up, everybody goes
[1:44:09] in that line. And four years later, all
[1:44:13] the people that were in two souls, they
[1:44:15] all went into thunders. And the people
[1:44:18] that were in thunders, they all went
[1:44:19] into Perusia.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; And then they go into something else.
[1:44:23] They they're always influenced
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; by by something else.
[1:44:29] So again,
[1:44:31] what influences you
[1:44:34] affects
[1:44:36] your influence.
[1:44:39] So make sure that those things are
[1:44:42] important and and that all goes along
[1:44:46] and it's just another way to today a
[1:44:50] different line of the same thought.
[1:44:55] Don't put faith
[1:44:58] in the accusations.
[1:45:01] They're trying to influence you
[1:45:04] away from every promise in the book,
[1:45:08] everything what it means to be a a real
[1:45:12] Christian. And and and you've got to be
[1:45:16] patient with me
[1:45:18] as a human being. I'm a human being. I I
[1:45:21] fight the devil. I don't I don't have
[1:45:23] every answer.
[1:45:25] I see something pop up on the scene,
[1:45:28] [snorts] I'm I'm slow to move.
[1:45:33] You know what I mean? I I I give
[1:45:34] something a lot of space and a lot of
[1:45:38] time.
[1:45:40] You know, and I I apologize to you when
[1:45:42] I when I got up and I I I spent a little
[1:45:45] too much time preaching on something
[1:45:47] that I didn't feel was right. If I have
[1:45:51] just let it go,
[1:45:53] it would have
[1:45:55] I I I just don't I What do you When it
[1:45:59] just peters out, you know what I mean?
[1:46:01] It just it fizzles away. It had its big
[1:46:05] boom. The rockets went out. The world
[1:46:07] was coming to an end. They had the
[1:46:09] revival. They're going to set the world
[1:46:11] on fire. You just sit back.
[1:46:14] Pretty soon, it's not being mentioned.
[1:46:16] It's not being followed. It's not being
[1:46:19] preached. All of us make mistakes.
[1:46:22] [snorts]
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Let's us forgive as we forgive others.
[1:46:27] Let's believe in one another's motive
[1:46:29] and objective.
[1:46:32] If you don't believe in my motive and
[1:46:34] objective, there's no way I can help
[1:46:37] you. [snorts]
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet of God said. She
[1:46:42] said, "If you can't get the people to
[1:46:44] believe you, if you get the people to
[1:46:46] believe you, nothing will stand in your
[1:46:48] way. Not even cancer. [snorts]
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Van wasn't tooting his horn.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; He was trying to get the people to
[1:46:56] believe.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; If they could look at him and believe
[1:47:01] that was God speaking through him, they
[1:47:04] could have what they asked for.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; If people can look at you and see the
[1:47:10] life of God in you, they will accept
[1:47:12] your words and their lives will change.
[1:47:16] And you'll be changing lives, having
[1:47:19] influence on people, not running from
[1:47:22] circumstances and situations,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; but you'll go grow
[1:47:28] in Christ Jesus.
[1:47:32] I like what the man said.
[1:47:36] He said,
[1:47:40] "I'm not what I want to be,
[1:47:42] and I'm not what I ought to be.
[1:47:46] But I ain't what I used to be either.
[1:47:49] And I hope as I grow in Christ Jesus
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; that you can see that brother McGary's
[1:47:56] growing,
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; that I'm ripening in the sun.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; And I want to be able to look at your
[1:48:02] lives and see your maturing and you're
[1:48:06] growing. Because the more he's with us
[1:48:10] and the more we grow in him, the more
[1:48:13] glory
[1:48:15] we can give him.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; And isn't there really that what we want
[1:48:18] to do?
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; We just really want to praise the Lord.
[1:48:22] Thank you so much. It's uh 7 o'clock.
[1:48:25] That's two hours of preaching and I
[1:48:29] haven't even got
[1:48:31] to the other half of the book. You can't
[1:48:34] you can't preach one book in a lifetime.
[1:48:39] Do you know that? Because it's eternal
[1:48:42] word. It's going to take eternity
[1:48:46] to reveal him. Aren't you glad like
[1:48:48] that? One eternal revelation of God.
[1:48:53] Hallelujah. I'm looking forward to it.
[1:48:56] He's coming soon. God bless you, brother
[1:48:58] Billy. If you come be close this, thank
[1:49:02] you so much. You're so kind.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:15] Let's all stand. Amen. How many enjoy
[1:49:18] the word of God?
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That his influence may be in us
[1:49:23] that we may be able to influence others.
[1:49:26] Key of F. Amen.

[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; When I look upon his face, he's [music]
[1:56:40] the one who saved
[1:56:43] me [singing] by his [music]
[1:56:47] taste
[1:56:49] [singing] by the name
[1:56:51] and [music] me.

[1:57:46] gloral. [music]
[1:57:54] Amen.
[1:57:56] Amen.
[1:57:58] Brother Timmy, if you could just come
[1:57:59] and dismiss us [music] tonight. Amen.
[1:58:01] Don't forget no service on Wednesday.
[1:58:04] Amen.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Are you appreciative for today?
[1:58:17] [music]
[1:58:21] You know, there's u
[1:58:25] a lot more effect of our influence when
[1:58:29] we don't realize
[1:58:32] how we're really influencing people. If
[1:58:35] that makes sense.
[1:58:37] If our normal [music]
[1:58:38] everyday life is at a level
[1:58:43] that people admire, want to be like it,
[1:58:46] like you said, be salty,
[1:58:48] and we're just doing what we're supposed
[1:58:50] to do. Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I think it has a positive benefit.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; And if I could relate to you,
[1:58:56] just if I don't want to keep you,
[1:58:58] brother David can remember [music]
[1:59:00] probably 30 years ago, you came to my
[1:59:03] house with I think young baby. I'm not
[1:59:06] sure if it was Davey or Aaron. And I had
[1:59:08] been burned at work.
[1:59:11] And it was a hot water steam burn.
[1:59:14] [snorts]
[1:59:15] And
[1:59:18] it had come up on my face, one of my
[1:59:22] arms and my leg.
[1:59:24] Intense pain. And uh
[1:59:29] wound up in Parkland Hospital. And I
[1:59:31] thought they had a man about brother
[1:59:34] Ben's size. I thought he was the biggest
[1:59:35] black man in Dallas and he had the
[1:59:37] cheapest big razor and he was just
[1:59:40] shaving hair and skin and everything off
[1:59:42] of me. And uh
[1:59:46] I remember cuz Joy, we were expecting
[1:59:48] Joy at the time and they had to call
[1:59:51] Melinda at home and say, "Hey, you need
[1:59:52] to respond. Your husband's burned." And
[1:59:54] all of that aside,
[1:59:58] I got back to work and you talk about
[2:00:00] feeling about this tall. Everybody was
[2:00:02] ooing and aawing because I'd come back
[2:00:04] to work so fast with the prayers of the
[2:00:07] saints. [music] You think I'm ugly now.
[2:00:09] I got had a lot of new skin put on. It
[2:00:12] was it was amazing what the Lord had
[2:00:14] done for me. But you get back to work
[2:00:16] and the people say,
[2:00:19] "I can't believe what you how you
[2:00:22] experienced that, what you were going
[2:00:23] through." So I wound up on the front
[2:00:25] aisle with a water hose being sprayed on
[2:00:27] me and I was in my underwear.
[2:00:28] Unfortunately, there's no women at work
[2:00:30] there, but it was it was pretty bad. And
[2:00:33] but he said, or they all said, the only
[2:00:36] thing I was crying out was mercy, mercy,
[2:00:39] mercy.
[2:00:44] I'm appreciative that I was able in a
[2:00:46] time of pain and distress
[2:00:49] still
[2:00:51] as he said that pattern of good works
[2:00:54] the way I was raised my belief whatever
[2:00:56] it [music] was it had a positive
[2:00:57] influence on someone and [snorts] I
[2:00:59] think in our everyday life and can we
[2:01:02] just maintain that it's going to benefit
[2:01:05] us in the long run.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[2:01:09] [crying]
[2:01:09] Oh gracious Lord, we thank you Lord for
[2:01:13] the power of transformation.
[2:01:16] how your word Lord
[2:01:19] as our brother repeated a prophet said
[2:01:21] first we have to accept it in our mind
[2:01:24] Lord we're intellectual beings [music]
[2:01:27] so much of the time Lord we lean on that
[2:01:31] how we've been taught what we think what
[2:01:33] we believe but Lord when it's
[2:01:35] transferred down in the deep reaches of
[2:01:39] the heart and there's a firm belief
[2:01:43] that's unwavering
[2:01:45] Lord That's the part that's going to be
[2:01:49] carried out of this world, be
[2:01:51] transformed into another body. We won't
[2:01:53] take [clears throat] these old filthy
[2:01:54] minds with us. We've cleaned them up.
[2:01:57] We've set them aside for your service.
[2:01:59] But Lord, we're still linked to this
[2:02:01] mortal body. But there's a there's
[2:02:03] [snorts] a soul within us as we're
[2:02:05] 10,000 worlds, [music] Lord. That's the
[2:02:08] conversion. That's the salvation. That's
[2:02:11] the benefit, Lord. and we're going to
[2:02:12] take the character of God that's deep
[2:02:14] within us. So, we're thankful, Lord, we
[2:02:17] can express these things. And [music]
[2:02:19] Lord, I am thankful that you brought me
[2:02:20] through so many trials, but Lord, there
[2:02:23] is nothing. Lord, we go through it again
[2:02:26] just to say if I had a soul to win or
[2:02:29] somebody to help, Lord, be it unto me
[2:02:32] according to thy word. Lord, may we all
[2:02:35] go forth this week, Lord, this week of
[2:02:38] thanksgiving. If someone's down in the
[2:02:40] mouth or or Lord, without may we be able
[2:02:43] to help or aid or benefit by prayer or
[2:02:46] with money or whatever you have for us
[2:02:48] to give them, Lord, so we might be
[2:02:50] ambassadors of the cause of Christ.
[2:02:52] [music]
[2:02:53] Lord, not to benefit us, but to benefit
[2:02:55] you and your kingdom, Lord. There's a
[2:02:58] life that's lived, Lord, that we want to
[2:03:01] express
[2:03:02] that you are alive and well. So, Lord,
[2:03:06] though we be weak in body, though we
[2:03:08] just tend to fail with with everything
[2:03:11] we say and do, Lord, we still have a
[2:03:14] benefit of a righteous God within us. So
[2:03:18] Lord, may we all have a positive
[2:03:19] influence. Lord, may we receive the
[2:03:21] right influence. [music] Lord, we just
[2:03:23] appreciate you, your word this day. You
[2:03:26] think we we thank you for this time of
[2:03:28] rest, Lord, as we start a new work week.
[2:03:30] Maybe the kids are out of school. I
[2:03:32] don't know, Lord, but you just provide
[2:03:34] for our needs. Go with us. And Lord, may
[2:03:36] we look to you,
[2:03:39] Lord, to translate us one of these
[2:03:41] [music] clear mornings, Lord,
[2:03:45] into that immortal body that we're all
[2:03:48] desiring and searching for. Grant it to
[2:03:50] us now, Lord, as we love you. ask you to
[2:03:53] just go with us. In the name of the Lord
[2:03:55] Jesus Christ, we pray and ask these
[2:03:57] things. Amen.
[2:04:01] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Happy
[2:04:05] Thanksgiving. Amen. I'll burn your
[2:04:07] turkey. Bite to you if you're [music]
[2:04:08] going to burn one. And uh we'll see you.
[2:04:11] Amen. God bless you. Peace.
