or situation no matter how dark it would seem Lord even when our mind would fail us Lord you have never failed us Lord when we would suffer great hurt and great wounds and our mind would seem to wander and we would forget the faith that you've deposited in US Lord you never forget we're thankful Lord that we can stand here this morning recognizing that you reached down your hand for us when we were in sin and you pulled us out of the muck and Meer that we could be free and able to serve you Lord in newness of life and have joy unspeakable and full of glory Lord and so we just want to thank you for that Lord and the atmosphere that's been created Lord knowing that you're pleased to walk amongst us and now as we come to this portion of the word Lord just pray that you'd have the preeminence now knowing that the enemy will fight against the mind to have those drift and to wander and to be distracted Lord we're just wanting you to have the preeminence Lord so we just surrender all of our thoughts all of our thinking Lord any preconceived ideas and maybe even the way we might have seen things Lord Lord we just want you to come and just have your perfect will in the way and just walk us through your word Lord that we might know you in a greater way that you could minister to our hearts Lord we love you we ask these blessings in your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles would be reading out of Isaiah uh 53 and verse three amen it's good to be in the house of God this morning amen another day to serve him his mercies are new Every Morning amen Isaiah 53 we'll just read the verse three and four for now says he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted amen we ask a blessing on the word you may be seated just for a a title this morning I want to speak on a a Man of Sorrows you know and last time uh we ministered we we were speaking on you know come to the word first and then watch the miracle and you know a lot of times when we Minister and certainly times as I've ministered from a an Evangelistic standpoint uh you know we we we we preach Revival and we we we we're we're preaching deliverance and and uh for for those to to come out of the valley and to come out of maybe that dark place uh where you you enter in and and you have newness of life and uh from being born again or from being in bondage but you know I uh it it's we understand uh that those things are needful we have to have those and we preach the mountain top but I I just want to say we we also have to preach the valley uh because we go through valleys and we live in valleys a and God has a purpose for that I appreciated the word by Brother David uh Wednesday you know uh uh God has deposited a seed and so there's going to be seasons and things that we go through uh that can break up the ground and and can cause that seed to to come forth and to express the attributes that God has placed in there but it it comes under severe pressure it comes under some heartaches and some trials you know when you would even think about brother Brandon would speak of the gold and the dross you know that it has to be beat out of there until until the one that's beating the gold can see his own reflection in there so uh we never we don't want to be ignorant to the fact that we go through valleys because a lot of times if we're not careful Satan can take a season or something you're going through and he'll just get you all tore up in such a way that you're the problem it's all your fault this is why you're going through this your job situation your family and and this illness and he'll be able to take all of these things and just put it in such a way and if you're not careful we we lose sight of how God has actually ordered our steps to go through hard times we we go through valleys and Seasons where we're we're at our lowest point and it's in those places that God is doing something he's dealing with your heart and you know even as we would we would read this scripture um in Isaiah you you know but you you go back and if you you look into Isaiah 9 and six it says unto us a child is born uh his name is wonderful counselor uh the Mighty God oh he's the Everlasting father and and and my oh and that's what all of Israel was looking for my this this this one to come amongst us but yet then later he says but he's a man of sorrow he's rejected he's despised and you're like I wait a second how does this how does this go together he he's all these great things but yet why is he suffering why are there these sorrows why why is rejected and you know we too being the word being Christ manifested in this day in this hour we too no no doubt we we have all these great attributes and things that we point to and and all the mighty things that God's done for us but yet there's times of Affliction he was a man acquainted with grief and we too on this side we too have to go through times of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and agony and I like this uh how brother brandom and getting in the spirit would say this he says you know everybody wants a Hilltop experience and they never want to take the valley everybody the Pentecostal Church too every night if you're not shouting dancing jumping up and down speaking in tongues and running around over the floor or something another you didn't have any kind of meeting well you know it's all right to be on the Mountaintop that's good but let me tell you your fruits will freeze up there at night and when the cold spell comes you'll lose all your fruit that's what's happened now we put too much on mountaintop experiences of dancing and shaking and jumping around instead of all night prayer meetings down in the valley of decision where you come down there and meet God and really pour out your life until something takes place look at the emphasis now we're not doing away we got to have Mountaintop experiences it's part of it we we believe in all these things but the prophet's showing us there's another there's another way as well there's the way of the valley there's the way of all night prayer meetings he says we've we've growed fruits up there but the freeze kills it that's right every time it comes a little cool spell you've got nothing to rest upon when the emotion dies down then the shout is all gone the noises EAS then where are you at you see it's the valley that proves the fruit it's the valley that proofs the seed when you're on the mountain top everybody can jump run Scream and Shout but down in the valley is there an anchor there and I'll say this for the seed there's an anchor many times you don't even know's there but when the storms come the Trials come and you you want to give up you want to throw in the towel there's something there keeping you holding you when you've let go and All Is Lost there's something there that's holding you The Temptations come along then you can't take it what we need need is get down to that grinding place down there in that Valley dig out as David would say in Psalms 34:17 he'd say the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and deliver them out of all their troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save as such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord the scripture speaks of he that cometh to God must be tested he's made you an overcomer in order to be an overcomer you have to have something to overcome and overcome means to stand the test brother Brandon would say this in how can I overcome and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the the greatest thing that ever happened to you I believe it's written in the scriptures Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time it's one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God are tested and tried James 13 and 4 would say knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing it's character development when you're tested and when you claim God's word when you're baptized and you claim to be identified with Jesus Christ the devil's going to be right there to test you on what you believe when you claim you have a revelation when you look into the word and you identify yourself with the word Satan is going to test you he's going to try you God is going to allow things to come into your life that'll have an effect on you in such a way because if you're a son you're going to be tried you're going to be tested things are going to come upon you to see if you know what you're talking about and what I love about it is when you fall when you don't passed the test it does not mean that you're not a son no because because you are a son you are being tried you're being tested and as you heard the prophet say the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you what it's showing that you got to you got to get down into that Valley of decision Lord if I'm not overcoming the test I know that you have deposited something in me that can overcome the test because your word will defeat Satan every time anywhere any place on any ground Lord then then there's somewhere my connection has been disrupted there's something in my life that gots to move out of the way there's a seed or an attribute that's inside of me that I know if it comes in contact with that word and the Holy Spirit comes upon that word it will defeat the enemy it will bring this body into subjection so Lord let me I I need to pour out I need to get into prayer I need to be in that Valley of decision oh God cuz I realize my life isn't adding up I believe your word I I know you've made me an overcomer I know greater you are that's in me than any trial than anything that I can face Lord but I see I'm shrinking back lord so I want to get to a place where I'm pouring out I'm digging out Lord because I want to see those attributes that you say are in me in reality we go through those valleys and hard times and I like this how David would say though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me I I like how the prophet of God would pick that up and he'd say notice it's it's the shadow of death he says see it's not completely dark because if it's completely dark you can't have a shadow he said so there has to be light there in order for there to be a shadow so David saying though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death oh there is light and if you walk in the light as he is in the light oh we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all our sins are you walking in the light are you walking in faith or are you walking in unbelief he's with you I want to say there's light in the valley there's light in the valley for he is with you even until the end you know just on that thought I was looking at that just how even though David is writing there and saying though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me it's certainly not a place that I I would really want to be and maybe if you look at the scripture and in a way of maybe coming to the end of your road and and maybe you're coming to that place of crossing over then we would welcome that for God's time we know death is just just a a tool in God's hand as the scripture would say uh precious is the death of of of of his Saints in the eyes of the Lord so we do not fear that but sometimes the trial and the and and the sickness and the things that we're going through it's it's like the shadow of death and everything's just hanging around your life and and and it's a hard place to be if you've ever been there and as you live this life I'll say this you know life is is is not easy you know when you're when you're young and and and unfortunately uh uh uh some uh Young have had really hard lies um but I would hope most you know as you're young and you don't have a care in the world and and the worst thing ever for you is having to do your homework oh my goodness gracious life life is just so terrible I got to do homework you know and you don't realize the own Comforts that have been afforded to you a roof over your head and and and the bills being paid and a loving mother and father maybe you have a broken home you have a a loving parent that looks out over your life and and what blessings but you know as you grow older and as time goes on you you find heartache comes and a and you lose loved ones and and and those things that are dear to you seem to be stripped away and and that's how life is and just thinking about this as David would say thou art with me you know that's what happened with the disciples one day they were out on the ship and out on the sea and and the storm came in and oh my the the waves were just so powerful you know that that the it tore up their Sals and and and they just got into such a place where where you know brother Brandon would dramatize that and talk about how they were out there you know talking about the things they had seen and and the goodness of God and the Miracles and everything and he says you know that's what Satan does you have a good meeting or you have a Revival you make a move for the Lord and and it seems like things are good you're fellowshipping around the things of God he said that Satan wants to come in and interrupt that so so don't be don't be amazed at what you're going through don't be amazed all of a sudden you're having trouble well if you're identifying yourself with the word if you're wanting to live for God Satan's going to try to disrupt that come on am I speaking to some Christians here that are wanting to live the message of the hour I say if Satan's not attacking you maybe there's a problem maybe he already got you maybe you're so comforted and Lady you'll see you that you know I go to church and I do I do what I need to do and I really don't have that many many hard times Well tired living for Jesus you'll find out hard times will come start start sacrificing your own will for his will you'll find out things will start to happen and things will take place and so the they were out there just having a good time and and Jesus was down sleeping on the boat and and all a sudden trouble arose and brother Brandon would say this in calling Jesus on the scene he'd say Satan he won't let you rest upon it very long when you go to talk about the Lord Jesus and about his Works he's going to be right there to interrupt that then troubles arose all of a sudden the ship began to rock and the sails blow off the ores broke water filled up the boat trouble at hand see it happened suddenly all hopes of survival was gone they though they had seen him do so many great things when trouble strikes they forget all about it is't that true how we testify of his goodness and his mercies and and we thank him for salvation and oh what what great Miracle is it a man who was in sin uh with with no hope but God with such great love would come to you he would call your name look there's a whole bunch of people out there groping in darkness but God called you God wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he predestinated you you that's right is that that never should never become common if you ever let the grace of God become common something's wrong cuz God's grace come with sacrifice a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and Agony he didn't have to do it but he did it for you that you might be free yes we might have hardship on this side but oh it's just a vapor right and because of his great love wherein he loved you one of these days oh one of these days it's all going to be over but how easily when it strikes us we get so so we're so enveloped in the trial we're we're we're so concerned with everything man the the the sales are gone the ores are broke the water's coming and what are we going to do now I want to ask you something as a brother isn't that about the attitude of the people today will'll come to church here and shout and praise God when our brothers and so forth speak the word we can hear the promises we just praise God for what he's done listen at the testimony of that one saying I once was blind my eyes were blind now I see once say the doctor had given me up with cancer in two weeks or two days or some there was there was was it one Speck of cancer that's been a long time ago they can't find it no more yet I laid Bound in a wheelchair paralyzed I walk as good as anybody else we hear those testimonies but just like it Let It Strike our little house one time then we forget all about that Glory that we've been enjoying all those great things oh it's on us now now watch what he said see those things happen for a purpose they happen to try you now trouble that we can't remedy seems like the doctors can't remedy and there's nothing that can remedy so we're not talking about something you know that you can put a Band-Aid on we're not talking about something you run to the medicine cabinet we're not talking about something that you can remedy on your own but something that if there's not a miracle or divine intervention you lay helpless just as in this story of these disciples they were soon to perish they were helpless and God will let you come into places in your life where you're helpless you you you you you can't run you've gone to the doctor he he says there's nothing that can be done you've ran all the test they've tried to find out what it is they they've done this test and that test you've run to this this doctor that doctor this specialist they sit you here they sit you here and they're just guessing and they're probing and after it's all said and done and after all the money and everything you sit they're like what am I going to do I've tried everything I've spent my whole living and you lay there feeling helpless but what you can take some comfort in knowing is he says see those things happen for a purpose they happen to try you you mean that's to try me well that's what the prophet is saying when it can't be remedied the doctors can't remedy and there's nothing can remedy in that moment just like the disciples the sails all torn up their ores had broke Waters coming into the boat Satan's determined to sink oh don't you don't you know Satan's determined to take you out he wants to seek you he sink you he wants to try to disrupt your faith in God and in the word he wants to take you out he wants to get life scenarios so so bound up this way and that way you just you like you know what I just I I better just compromise on the word or I won't be able to pay my bills watch out that's the testing you stand there and say I'll take God at his word I'll believe his word he's never seen the righteous forsaken or ever begging bread but I got to work on Sunday to pay the bills that doesn't dovetail it doesn't I'm sorry I can only say the word and I don't mean to preach my convictions but it's a day of rest unto the Lord and many times we want it both ways but I not to say names but I can tell time and time again where I've seen the test come down to a Believer they make a move for God and they make a stand for God and God blesses them and and it seems like everything's going fine and they testify God gave me a job I was able to move to the Aira everything's good and and oh now they can actually afford to pay for this home and and and my everything's just God's just blessing their life and all of a sudden well you know um there's been a shift change and uh we need you to work while you're having Church what is that oh but if all of a sudden oh my goodness I'm I'm not going to be able to I just God just gave me well God gave me a new house and certainly he wants me to pay for it he gave me the job and so I mean certainly I don't I have to give all that up so all all's all they're asking me to do is to miss church here or there well wait a second hold on I I thought the whole testimony was is that that God had blessed you that you could be in fellowship and that you could be in church and now that you got a few things now what's what's happening the test comes and how many times do you see compromise how many times oh God wants to bless me and somebody gets a job and it's taking them to no Fellowship I'm saying there's a test there oh and and and Satan can present it in such a way we have a testimony right here in our church where where you know God gives us jobs he gives us favor with people He blesses us in in organizations and then sometimes you allow a test to come in such a way where the organization wants to take you a certain direction and if you're not careful it looks like it's the hand of God but sometimes we got to get down in the valley decision say Lord I don't know what to do I need your help and God will come and speak to you and you start to really get down in there and find out what your desire of your heart is and if your desire is just to make more money if your desire is just to have a nicer house and if you're not careful you'll follow your desires right out of the will of the Lord but if your desires are according to the word then you can say Lord you give me the job you give me my house and then I'm just going to stand upon your word Lord then whatever else comes oh God I'm coming to the word and then I'll watch you take care of everything else and many times your stand for the word can take you into a dark Valley inte great testing doctors say there's nothing that can be done tried everything mental troubles nervous breakdowns we forget all the Miracles and the call of God upon our life and the doubt starts to swirl and and fear starts to press in prophet of God says notice trouble that they could not remedy then fear sets in just like it is now even we got fears and National troubles we got fears in church troubles we got fears all around everywhere now we say well now now what can we do about it if we could only remember that he is in the ship see you say but but but yes he is in the ship though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil because thou art with me he's in the boat this morning oh if God by his grace will help me deliver my heart some of us are going through really hard trials dark times and dark testings and you you feel there's no hope and it seems like you're very the core of your your heart is being broken and Stripped Away from you and you you hardly know where you stand your mind is felling you oh but you have a promise that Jesus is on the boat here this is him in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word is the same yesterday today and forever it's still just take this it's the remedy it's the medicine it's the cure for every breakdown now follow now it's a cure for every breakdown look if we're not careful we preach such a Mountaintop religion that we're not afforded to go through hard times and to go through mental breakdowns and to battle against depression and if you're not careful you can get a religious spirit on you and be incapable of helping your brother and sister that's in a valley because you're not spiritual oh but if you're spiritual and know that our Lord was a man of sorrow he was acquainted with grief and Agony that when you would be in that place oh he's he's a Kinsman he's a high priest that's touched by the fing of your infirmity he knows how to get down to where you're living he can bear you up he can hold you he can keep you he can take you through the valley because he's on the boat he's with you Satan wants you to forget the word in that trial in that struggle in that breakdown in that depression brother Matthew you mean a born again believer can battle depression oh well read your Bible look at the message of the hour many men of God and spiritual people battle depression and breakdowns why because they're spiritual they're they're they're oh they're on the firing line they're doing battle oh you know the natural types the spiritual you think our men and women that have served our country our men that have been in war and been War torn and bombs and and and and and and and the things that they've seen and come back and just because they hear a loud bang they run off and they're rolling on the floor and they're crying and everything and you just look over and say that ain't no Soldier how could that be a soldier laying out of the house of God shame on you do you not know what that man's been through maybe protected and saved more lives and brought more people to the gospel then you ever will we sit on a pedestal that ain't no Soldier I can't believe he's gobling and rolling around and crying like that you don't know the battles you don't know the hardship you don't know the heartache you don't know the valley that they're they're they're they're living and going through but I say one thing if anything can resonate with your heart if you've ever been there if you've ever been in a place where it's so dark God's nowhere to be found and you feel all alone you feel forsaken you're losing your mind you're having a nervous breakdown you seem like everything's wrong but you come back to yourself you say what nothing's wrong uh my family's right my church is right everything's right but somehow someway you're in the darkest despair you're in the darkest Valley something that you never knew you could get that love oh oh but thank God there's an anchor I was thinking you know the enemy comes in like a flood it's it's almost like if if the the roof opened up and and sand was was pouring down and you were trying to keep the sand off of you there'd be no way to do it you try to Shield every fiery Dart of the en but you couldn't do it oh but one thing we have is the word the devil can can be so on you no rest in your mind just seem like if you rest for one second you'll have a nervous breakdown he's constantly bombarding your mind over and over and over and if you let up for one minute oh the thoughts comes the emotions come the depression comes those Spirit comes all those things they they start to war against you and all of a sudden you feel like you're going to lose it you're going to lose your mind and you got to keep saying the word saying the word speaking the word speaking the word oh has somebody ever been there I say if you've been there then if your brother's hurting or going through a valley it will create a compassion and an ability to reach down and bind together with them just keep trying to move in this quote this is the remedy it's the medicine it's the cure for every breakdown it's the cure for every Cancer it's the cure for every ailment it's God manifested word the word is God Jesus said it's a seed the seed being planted in the right ground it'll grow exactly what it is and every promise will be produced now sometimes that takes a valley we forget all about it know that he is in the ship they should have known that he knew that thing was going to happen do you believe that certainly he knew it he knew all the time it was going to happen I pray that would just start to bring somebody some comfort and peace and deliverance right now your sickness your job situation your marriage your family member that did not surprise our Lord he knew all the time it was going to happen why why did he do it why did God all let this come upon your family why did God allow this sickness to come upon your life say what it is why are you going through this why are you living in this Valley why he only did it to prove to test their faith and sometimes he does the same thing for you and me he lets things happen just to see what we'll do about it do you believe that the scripture said every son that cometh to God must be tried Chason proved Satan will make you prove every inch of ground that you claim he certainly will so sometimes God lets those things happen so now think about that you're going to be challenged on every inch of ground you claim we live in an age where we can claim all ground yes every promise is yours you are the bride you can do the Greater Works you can speak to the mountain we claim that we believe that maybe I can say it again I know this ain't a shouting service but do you believe it do you believe that you can do the Greater Works do you believe you are that Invincible Army that Malachi 45 spoke of I believe it with all my heart do you believe oh if the Lord did not carry in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you'll be changed Satan will make you prove every inch of ground that you claim he certainly will so sometimes God lets those things happen all right so now okay we're in the valley oh we're coming off the Mountaintop and some valleys can be long narrow dark hard not just a month or two they can be Seasons sometimes you'll go through a valley and God will take you home so we know and we believe the word and everything that has been spoken but don't be surprised when you go into the valley and you feel like you don't feel his presence you haven't heard from God in a long time you've prayed to be delivered you've come up for prayer you Proclaim I believe and now the time just keeps rolling on what are you going to do about it hey let's get down to where we're living what about the Sanctified life what about oh I got the victory over this and that and that Spirit of lust and and these problems and over the internet and and over social media and all of a sudden the test comes back what do you do now brother brandom says in the invasion of the United States he says I'm afraid we've made it too easy I think love I think Joy certainly I I believe that all Joys lays in Jesus Christ that's right I believe it's joyful and happy but remember brother it's the way of Agony and suffering and the cross you must realize that too that's right I wonder if we haven't painted it a little too [Music] smooth oh it's just a bunch of Joy running around like Superman Mountain be moved and we're all just one of these days I'm going to be Superman no no when I look at the life of my Lord no oh was he was his is his name wonderful is he the counselor is he the Prince of Peace is he the Mighty God is he the Everlasting father and in all that he was a man of sorrow a Man of Sorrows you know sorrow means pain mentally or physically many times we dismiss the mental pain and I say out of any age that we've ever lived in no coincidence the prophet preaches the greatest battle ever fought and it's up here in your mind and if we ever live in an age where your mind is constantly bombarded I mean when's the last time you got out in nature and just let the trees and the birds and the skies and the and and the clouds talk to you because I one thing I love about it you won't find it negativity they can minister to you that Cool Breeze or you see the birds or the the animals and the Rolling Hills you get away and then you can find some peace but oh there's spirits on the cities and the towns and your jobs and wherever you are and it could just wear on you I wonder if we haven't painted a little too smooth where we forget you know what I got to fight this is a battle it's not smooth it's not easy and remember it's the way of suffering it's a way of Agony it's the way of the cross just as our text would say he was despised and rejected a man of sorrow acquainted with grief I want to bring your attention out of the saman church age he says he may commit you to death as he did Paul everybody feeling okay let God speak to your heart because it's in the valley if we're not careful we lose sight of what God's doing it's in the valley where we we we start to long for the Mountaintop and we miss what God's doing in the valley see God will bring you into a trial he'll bring you to a valley and and because of you claim and because of the seed and because of the word it's in that Valley that your fruit that seed word is going to be proved that you can stand a test he says he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it's all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace oh if we've if we've ever lived in a time you know in this age there's such senseless acts of violence and and and just it's just uh hard to understand all of the the things that we go through and you see how there's school shootings and a and hardship at Young ages and people go through great tragedies and great losses there's people who have broken marriages and broken homes and they're estrange from their children or their spouse and and it leaves people with broken hearts and crushed and feeling empty and they they feel like they're Shipwrecked yes that's that's the people we that's all of us we go through the times and these hardships as job would say in in in 141 he says the man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble Paul would say if if we only had hope of Christ in this life then we're a people most miserable because there's there's a Greater Hope Beyond this life because it's full of trouble it's full of Heartache it's full of Sorrows I I was listening to rejected King there a mother comes up and she's just so overwhelmed and and to me I thought it was so amazing because Here Comes This Woman She's overwhelmed and now here stands the gift of God Discerning the heart he's standing there and she comes up and he says I see a beautiful woman standing over there speaking of beyond the curtain of time and she goes oh no I'm not praying I'm not I'm I'm I'm up here I'm I'm for my Bo I'm I'm here for my boy now now I think what's profound she was missing it she's like I I'm I'm up here for my boy go he go and he goes oh oh he he's he he's he's gone out he's like no no he's he's in the hands of God he goes oh Oh you mean he's gone on he goes yes and I I don't want to be here anymore I just want to go to him and she was in such grief and despair and she said oh I just want to go if God would just take my life I want to go be with my boy and I thought amazing here as she would stand up there that God would give her the very end say look you're going to be there I see you standing over there as a young woman the prophet would come back and he say look you're going to meet your son it's just a short span on this side I say what a great comfort and a great peace that that a mother was going through the greatest grief of losing a child and she was seeking something from God and God was telling her don't worry I've already made a way for you I'm going to bring you into a union you're going to see your boy again I say oh that would be bring some comfort in the midst of the trial but we go through these things church that doesn't make you less of a Christian it's God allowing the trial to test your faith and prove that you really are his Purp purpose is that after we have suffered a while thank you we would be made perfect be established and strengthened and settled now I want to just say that being settled is not a mindset as here not too long ago God was dealing with me I'm being settled just you know you be settled you're aable you're settled that's not something that's a can be a mindset it has to be a character I don't know it just makes me think of Stonewall Jackson you can't talk yourself into being a Stonewall Jackson I'm just gonna be just like Stonewall Jackson I'm gonna stand there let the bullets fly let the Cannons go I guarantee you you can get up there and talk yourself into it let them bullets start flying let that Cannon go off and I'll see whether you're a stone wall or not and I dare to say you'd be off of your high horse real quick but there was something in that man there was a character there I believe there was a faith believing in God see to be settled it has to go beyond the five senses it has to be a character within you that you're resting on something beyond what your mind can figure out as job said he puts strength in us there it is you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered Hebrews 58-9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation and all them that obey him in plain language I like plain language in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection now Satan's going to try you on that you're going to go through some hard times we say I believe it I'm the bride without spot without wrinkle amen well the trials and the text are going to come to mold that character into you because what character is a a victory character is not a gift so then all of the attributes that are laying inside of you the trials and tests are going to come so that you get the Victory and have the character that's laying within the seed that's already in you hey this is this is this is good food for your soul we get so wrapped up in lady OA we think putting on a tape once a week and coming to church that's going to create the body change oh I'm just going through another hard time and I'll just bite my time let's find out what God is trying to do in your life let's find out maybe if you're not failing a few tests and God's allowing you to go through these things because he's calling for a deeper consecration in your life and and just think about this now as we we just try to turn a corner towards a close just as he mentioned job let's look at job for a few minutes we'll just try to be maybe about 10 15 more minutes we'll have to just quit but I I don't want to lose you by being too long and pray something that would be said that can help you in the season that you're going through but if you look into Job chapter one maybe you just turn in your Bibles I think this is an amazing portion in scripture in Job 1 verse seven it says and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in all the Earth from walking up and down it and you know Lord Al obviously knew what he was walking up and down at four because he he's going about like roing line seeking whom he may devour right so God knew his intent so he just comes right out and says it and says okay the Lord said unto Satan hath you considered my servant job now here's what I want you to see he said that there is none like him in all the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and a showeth evil then Satan answered the Lord and said do does job not fear for not go to the next verse heast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance and his increase in the land now now now look at God's thoughts towards him of he's he's a perfect and upright man in his generation there's none like him now don't you know that God's speaking the same thing about you that you're perfect and upright I just pull up Ephesians 1 look look at look at how God speaks concerning you if you pull up Ephesians 1:1 I don't know we don't have to turn there but I thought we could there we are thank you Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the sanctuary at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love I mean my Mountaintop Hallelujah I mean you you go through there and you come into Ephesians 4 and and all this my we're joint HS with Jesus Christ we're heir to all that the father has us we're predestinated we can't miss it we're going in a body change we're going in a Rapture praise the Lord and then he comes to chapter six and says Now put on the whole armor of God wait a second hold on I thought I made it right I I thought I was predestinated under good works and I thought I was join HS and a man I'm on the mountain top I'm screaming I'm shouting I got all the promises of God praise God we made it my name was written on the Lamb's uh a book of life and and you cannot miss it now it's time to fight wait what I would wait a second here yes you're perfect have you considered job There's No One Like Him notice God's thoughts for job and then the trial came he's perfect There's No One Like Him have you considered and so all of this evil starts to befall job job don't know what's going on but God does oh we've received a message Malachi 45 has come the Lord himself shall descend with a shout we've come into into an invisible Union with Christ soon is the body changed but just like Ephesians right Joshua parallels Ephesians we've entered into our Promised Land we've come into our land Every Blessing oh you're seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus now what do you got to do you got to fight well that's what the prophet taught you come in you come into the new land it wasn't the Millennium I think that's the problem are are some of y'all thinking this is the Millennium I'm disappointed now I know spiritually I'm raptured I know I'm in Union with him I know I can't miss it I I know my just how God deals W with the individual he deals with the church and he deals with the world this world's going to have to be burned over in fire my soul's already been burned over with fire I'm already raptured I'm already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but that seed word that's been deposited oh it's time to fight yes and if he ordains me to go through hard trials look at job all of the son know he's perfect he's upright oh but you've built a about him all right I'll let you come in I'll let you affect his job I'll let you affect his welfare if you're not careful you forget who you are you forget Ephesians 1 2 3 4 5 you forget what has been spoken of you and you're distracted just like the disciples in the ship I mean you know I I love the word because we like to think what we would have done we'd have just been on our recliner hey boys put up a hammock man these are some pretty big waves let's try to Surf this thing man not a care in the world because you would think what do I have to worry if Jesus is on the boat that should be the attitude but you see it's the storms it's the waves it's the afflictions it's the distractions we forget that Jesus is on the boat our sufferings and our hard trials we forget that God's allowed you to enter into that season I know it's hard but just as he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief we too have to suffer oh but thank God our suffering has a reward not not not that our suffering purchases anything no he already purchased our reward but that we too might have a Christlike character our suffering has a benefit you look out on the world there's people suffering losing children to senseless acts broken homes and wicked situations and they go through all that heartache with no hope and if you've ever gone through any heartache like that you would want to have compassion on them and bring them some hope in their trial I say there ought to be a love in your heart to look out on those in great Affliction you know you know we were having a little bible study and brother Andrew we always pray at the end of it he's out on a job in in Arlington you know and he's you know they're going through a water problem out there let's pray for them you know you you you you you think why because there's a heart that say you know what these people have a need and how would you feel if you were going through that he was entering in we'll just continue for a few moments we'll get to something concerning that but notice God's thoughts concerning job and then the battle come seems like the battle's over man but then all of a sudden ay it's time to fight and we'll just speed up for the sake of time a as as this evil starts to befall job he gets you know his three friends come to him his three comforters come and and and they just sit there for seven days and don't say a word and then job finally after this many times he opens up his mouth and he starts to speak out he says curse the day that I was born here this perfect and upright man perfect and in his generation is going through the deepest darkest trial man could know he lost everything then Not only was all the substance taken from him what was taken from him his health and then his own comforter which they didn't sound like comforters to me you secret sinner like that's not helping I thought you were supposed to be my comforter and sometimes the devil will take your mind and you'll come to church where the word's here to comfort you and he'll make you think about the man he'll make you think about the veil he'll make you think about situations and all you will hear is you're just a secret sinner and all you see is judgment and you miss the grace that God is wanting to pour out in your life even his own wife turned him down his church turned him down and the prophet of God would say in that dark hour where he didn't know where he was going from there Jesus came along said I know my redeemer liveth and in the last days he'll stand upon the Earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I'll see God see all that trial all that testing was proving that there was a revelation inside of job God was proving job God was proving to the devil what he said about job thank you Lord did not God come and say you are his victory come on did he not say that you are the Invincible Army did he not say that you will do the Greater Works then all the testing and all the trial is just proving to that old devil what he said is true and God wants to use you to go through the hard times and go through those trials and those times of Agony and sorrow and mental pain and suffering because there's a revelation inside of you that's going to prove to the devil prove to you that you are what he said you are wow we just don't have the time to do it but you go in and you listen to on the wings of a snow white dove the prophet of God would start talking about how he suffered he would say you don't know what I've suffered just mental oppression every seven years that comes all my life that's where I'm at now 7 eight he says I I was so distressed I cried I begged I pleaded and I remember when my finally thought I I had enough money to go to Mayo for examination to find out what the trouble was they said they'll find out what the trouble is wife and I Becky Sarah was a little bitty fell I just entered into my Healing Ministry and we took off for males well huh you just entering into your Healing Ministry and you're going to the medical clinic it doesn't sound like it's adding up and sometimes you feel like things aren't adding up in your life but God knows all about it God knows your heartache he knows the trial he knows the situation he understood right where his Prophet was though he was battling mental oppression and being all nervous and tore up and he was wanting to go to a clinic and yet and all that God was using him to bring a healing Revival to the world but you see when you've been in Dark Places we'll come to a close quickly when you've been in Dark Places when you know what it's like to be alone when you when you when you feel like no one knows your pain I believe somebody here this morning is going through a really dark trial and you're going through a really hard time oh if I had time to express my heart I I I I've I I've been in a valley I've been in a hard time where you feel so helpless and you feel your mind's done forsaking you you feel like God's nowhere to be found and you're in agony and you're rolling around on the ground and you can't make sense of anything and you're at your lowest e in your darkest power I say what it'll do it'll create something in you where you can say oh God if my brother or sister's feeling anything like that is there something I can do to help them Lord Lord I want to look out there and have compassion I want to look on the heart I don't want to judge a man for his deeds and his faults and his failures but I want to have compassion on him with where he's at we we uh you know it's like we allow all the cares of life and all the mistakes and failures and and past circumstances and things that have done and conduct from from one another and I it just builds up a big thick crust on top of the water and and it just we just allow it to become stagnant but and we never get down beyond all of it down to where somebody's living down to the heart of the matter and find out you know what are you going through maybe some things were done maybe some things were said may you know may maybe I know that's not really who you are or what are you going through I want to be able to help you when you've gotten down in those places then it really creates a compassion where you can help somebody else as Paul would say in Ephesians 4:32 be kind-hearted one to another forgiving one another even as Christ's sake has forgiven you now think of this as we're just moving quickly the prophet of God said I want to tell you a secret of praying for the sick I'm not a Healer God knows that but God answers prayer for me many times and the only way it can be done I'm just by God's help taking a fruit of your hard time your trial that you go through the character that it's molding in you the only way it can be done you've got to enter into the fellowship of their suffering you've got to really feel it we know the story about the young mother who saw that I mean I believe she she was she had been a mother or was uh her kids were grown but she looked down at a young mother and and she her baby was just fussing and something inside of her she's like I got to pray for that baby she had compassion she know what it was like she said oh her baby's suffering that poor mom she's nervous going back and forth something compelled her she could enter into that suffering brother brandom said you have to feel the person's condition or you'll never help him you got to enter into their suffering if you don't just cold-heartedly it'll never work so you got to be able to place yourself into their suffering Look what Jesus was a man of sorrow he was acquainted with grief and Agony he knows how to place himself right into where you're living He says in the queen of the South you can never help anybody unless you get right into it with them you got to enter into their suffering if you don't do it you just you're just out you got to have a love in something that makes you just right with them that's why the prophet could stand there because I I I tying this together because the prophet knew what hardship was the prophet knew what Agony was the prophet knew what it meant to be poor the prophet had suffered he had gone through things right when his own Healing Ministry starting out he's trying to go to a doctor for something he's begging and pleading God to be delivered from but you know I believe one thing that the prophet was able to do we was able to look at somebody else that was suffering and going through a trial and he could relate to to them he could enter in to their suffering that's why he could stand there as he he saw that he was down in Mexico and there's an older man he said he maybe a brick l or something like that he looked at him and he said you know he'd be about my Daddy's age what was he doing he was starting to enter in to a place of identification he he got to putting his foot next to his I wonder if my clothes would F him what was he doing he was entering into the fellowship of his suffering and I say one ability I would say the prophet had to be able to do that was because he too suffered he too was poor he too knew what sorrow was he too was AC acquainted with grief he knew what a dark hour was to stand there pleading for his six-month old baby already his wife gone now he's pleading for his little Sharon Rose Lord don't take her please don't take her and then that black curtain come down and he knew God would not hear his prayer and then the devil really started to pour it on him to tell him see he don't love you now we're talking about a dark Valley and maybe that's where you're at right now you're going through a dark Valley but it's just a testing time it's a proving time that God has deposited a faith seat on inside of you that will pass the test and if you feel like you're falling don't worry Jesus is in the boat we'll just invite the musicians to come but I say we we all were suffering under the penalty of sin and death and Christ entered into our suffering that we could be free free from the law of sin and death as Philippians 2:8 would say and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient un death even the death of the cross say he's our kinsman redeemer he's our high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities you might feel like you're in hell and there's no way out you might feel like you're in the deepest trial and there's no way you're going to get out but I know somebody who's went there for you that he could bring you out for David would say in Psalms 8613 he said for great is the mercy toward me and thou Hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell as the poet would write the love of God is greater far that Tong or pin could ever tell it goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest hell maybe we could sing that oh he it would say someone in their Darkest Hour pinned these words on the walls of an insane asylum could we with ink the ocean F and were the skies a parchment made where every stock on earth a quill and every man a scribe by trade to write the love of God above would drain the oceans dry nor could the scroll contain the hole though stretched from Sky to Sky oh they found that written on the walls of an insane asylum I like to think of it this way somebody was there in their darkest hour and their hardest trial and Jesus came along they found out that no it seemed like they had no hope here they're trapped between these walls in an insane asylum and yet they found out after all that Jesus was on the boat oh it was Jesus keeping them all the time and they would pin those words on the wall he was wounded for our transgressions surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows oh you might feel oh this might be like a paradox but you're feeling the weight of the trial the hardship you're at Your Darkest Hour but surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows for he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all what a redeemer What A Savior oh that he would take our place I say then if we got to go through a little suffering on this side church we go through some heartache we lose some some loved ones we go through some great trials it's just working for your good it's just perfecting the character it's just bringing the seed to maturity that you too can have a Christlike character oh just say Amen to the word I know we don't want it I know we want a Mountaintop experience I know we want to just scream and shout the victory but you got to come down into the valley and I say if if that's the way God has to bring us to bring forth the character I say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word I know you're crying out for a healing and you're already healed because God said he's a Healer and God said by his stripes you're already healed you just stay with the word if he said it I believe it so then your season of your Valley might seem like it's long but God's working a Perfection within [Music] you Paul said in Philippians 3:10 that I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death there's Fellowship in that suffering let's all stand Prophet would say in the sermon job he says you say I'm not worthy to walk out of this wheelchair tonight that's right you're not but God don't examine you he examined Christ and if he's worthy then you can walk see that's right now for a moment I just want you to take your eyes off the trial because many times we feel like we're the reason or we're the ones responsible no it's because you're a Believer and your faith is being [Music] tested it's not your righteousness it's his righteousness that's right you're not but God don't examine you he examines Christ and if he's worthy then you can walk that's right depends on what you think about you say brother random I'm an awful woman I've lived illegally I've even broke my marriage vows I've done this and Mr brandom I tell you I've been a drunker I've done this no matter what you've done God never looks at you he looks at the lamb and he's already accepted the lamb so you're free God can't see you he sees the lamb dies in your stad that's enough to make a fellow fellow shout isn't it sure is when you think of that it's those basis upon the word I want to say he's worthy then you can walk that's right he's worthy then you can be free he's worthy then you can have joy he's worthy he'll bring you through your trial he's worthy that no matter how hard it gets you can say praise the Lord yes he's worthy so you can walk he's worthy yes and I say if I got to go through a hard trial I say he's worthy if I got to suffer that I might have character that would please him I say he's worthy and my my hard time and my trial and my pain isn't because of my unrighteousness God's not looking at that he's looking at the lamb so that I say be free from condemnation be free from guilt don't let sat Satan pile up on those things in your life as you've been going through the season in your life Satan's just been dropping in all these lies you should have done this and you should have done that well if if that's the truth then you know what you do Lord forgive me I'm sorry I Repent I turn away from those things that's how easy that is to make that right you don't have to live in that condemnation then you can just say Lord I've pleaded the blood the sacrifice you're worthy Lord I'm going to walk on free and I know just as David said though I walk to the Valley of the shadow of death thou art with me the love of God is greater far than tongue or P the love and reaches to oh Bow Down [Music] with

this here as they softly [Music] play why does he stand [Music] by oh maybe the agony the grief the the pain the oppression so great nervous breakdowns you don't know where to turn what to do why does he stand by the reason is this Romans 8:17 if children then heirs and Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain the reason for that is the character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift when you go through the storm knowing these things doesn't take away the pain you still going to feel some Agony and Sorrows but the prophet of God said he lets trouble come and just harnesses the troubles puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him that the trouble would bring you into a closer

remember Brother David and sister lesie out in San Diego and just working through those affairs with the passing of his mother and also I just I like to welcome back my sister Sharon who was there for the family during that time it's good to have her back and the Lord used her in a special way just the testimonies and things coming forth and the answered prayers of God caring for our grandma just a wonderful blessing to know that on this side we'll have trials we'll have some heartaches we'll suffer but it's just for a moment and one of these days all those that we love and hold dear and the things that we've feel that have been stripped away from us there's going to be a reunion one of these days you know I just didn't have time to get to that but the scripture says you know that all of our sorrow will be turned into Joy you know in a moment one of these times we're going to be change whether we go by the way of the Grave or whether not but Revelations 21:4 is and God shall wipe away all our tears from our eyes there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the forer things will be passed away oh friends it can be hard but I say because of what Christ has done for us it's worth it God bless you God bless you brother Tim I pray we enjoyed the benefits of coming to the house of the Lord this morning there's there's blessing in it if see just reading in the next chapter in Revelation John records Jesus's words said behold I come quickly and my reward is with me we are his reward it's by our heads Lord we thank you for this
