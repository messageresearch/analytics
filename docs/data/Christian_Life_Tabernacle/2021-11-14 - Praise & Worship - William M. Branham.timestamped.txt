[54:35] and and we had a star that came in our
[54:37] day
[54:39] but he wasn't the only star
[54:42] you know we lift up people because
[54:44] they're good at sports or because they
[54:46] can pretend in front of a camera or
[54:48] something like that but you know what
[54:50] god has some real celebrities
[54:54] you know but we don't take
[54:56] our fame on ourself we we give our glory
[54:59] to god
[55:00] but it's okay for us to glorify god in
[55:03] one another
[55:05] it's okay for us to do that

[55:15] we can only use human language to try
[55:18] our best

[55:22] like when we pray
[55:24] you know how the spirit says that that
[55:26] the the bible says that the spirit makes
[55:28] intercession for us
[55:30] you know with the
[55:31] interceding force with things that can't
[55:33] be uttered i believe he does that to us
[55:35] when we try to praise him too
[55:37] you know
[55:38] but i wanted to sing something and
[55:41] just a little
[55:42] a song of appreciation in english and in

[1:02:09] devil covered and uh
[1:02:12] we all know he's nothing but a liar
[1:02:14] but anyway i was there at home streaming
[1:02:16] the service and brother david he
[1:02:18] preached and he played a portion of a
[1:02:20] message there and
[1:02:23] i can't remember what message he was but
[1:02:25] there at the end when he was closing
[1:02:27] it came on his heart to play another
[1:02:29] portion of us another message where
[1:02:31] brother branham was discerning the
[1:02:33] thoughts
[1:02:34] and calling out spirits
[1:02:36] and he told this man up front who was
[1:02:37] laying there on a cot he told him to get
[1:02:39] up and receive your healing in the name
[1:02:41] of jesus christ
[1:02:42] right when he said that i stood up out
[1:02:44] of my chair
[1:02:46] and i said satan in the name of jesus
[1:02:48] christ
[1:02:49] i command you to get out of my home
[1:02:52] to leave me to leave my wife
[1:02:54] you're no longer welcome here in the
[1:02:56] name of jesus christ
[1:02:57] and about that time my phone buzzed
[1:03:00] but i'm in church so i ain't gonna pick
[1:03:02] it up you know what i mean i might be
[1:03:03] streaming but i'm still in church
[1:03:05] and uh
[1:03:07] so it went on went on and um
[1:03:09] buzzed again i just left it alone
[1:03:12] and then brother billy came up and he
[1:03:13] was closing out in some songs and uh i
[1:03:16] said even let me just check it real
[1:03:17] quick and i checked it and it says
[1:03:19] daniel this is the doctor's office
[1:03:22] and i never got another kova test either

[1:26:04] i'm my son
[1:26:06] i would always do that
[1:26:08] uh
[1:26:09] i think it was tuesday i came back from
[1:26:11] work uh
[1:26:13] and then um before david talked about
[1:26:15] the teams for this meeting and my wife
[1:26:17] also came back from the clinic and said
[1:26:19] oh they were talking about the tragedy
[1:26:21] that happened you know
[1:26:24] in houston
[1:26:25] and they were just talking and so in my
[1:26:27] mind i told my wife i was like huh well
[1:26:29] i see that uh and i was imagining myself
[1:26:32] being there but i couldn't see
[1:26:34] how i could be there
[1:26:36] and so i told my wife you know when they
[1:26:38] talked about it you know everybody had
[1:26:39] their opinion about it
[1:26:41] and i told my wife i said wow look at
[1:26:43] the war the world we're living in is
[1:26:44] crazy
[1:26:46] and the only thing i could just think of
[1:26:48] was oh my goodness oh lord
[1:26:51] i'm just waiting for you we're just
[1:26:53] waiting for you because i can't find
[1:26:55] myself i can't see myself there for any
[1:26:57] reason
[1:26:58] and so i told my wife i said you know
[1:27:01] what about horse what are we doing to
[1:27:03] get ready because we know the day of our
[1:27:05] own redemption droidner and so that's
[1:27:08] the thing i was thinking and then um you
[1:27:11] know i i was telling her as well i said
[1:27:13] while you know the world is crazy you
[1:27:15] and i can both agree on that
[1:27:17] um in egypt you know that that was crazy
[1:27:20] as well but there was goshen there was
[1:27:22] peace and you know the people that
[1:27:24] probably you know left goshen to go to
[1:27:26] egypt for walk every day and then come
[1:27:29] back to goshen why goshen was all chaos
[1:27:33] while egypt was chaos goshen was at
[1:27:35] peace
[1:27:36] and so i thought about that song i said
[1:27:38] oh the day of our redemption
[1:27:41] and then so my son is two i'm going to
[1:27:43] the two i think they tied together and
[1:27:45] then my other song is i'm bound for the
[1:27:46] promised land so when i know okay my

[2:04:28] i could have served you so much better
[2:04:31] you know
[2:04:32] and i
[2:04:34] i can't do nothing about
[2:04:36] yesterday
[2:04:38] but i can do something about
[2:04:40] now
[2:04:42] and i i just want to live a better now
[2:04:45] hey man i i've just uh
[2:04:48] you know i'm so humbled i just can't
[2:04:51] express to you
[2:04:52] how humbled i am to see
[2:04:56] i don't know one of the gifts that
[2:04:59] are
[2:05:00] coming and
[2:05:02] you know i've i've listened to
[2:05:04] brother jeff for hours and hours and
[2:05:06] hours on end
[2:05:08] and i never knew he had a voice that
[2:05:10] good
[2:05:11] so i'm telling you don't ever think
[2:05:14] you've got it figured out
[2:05:18] i've been pastoring sister jeannie for
[2:05:20] over 30 years and i never heard her sing
[2:05:23] a special
[2:05:24] so the days of miracles have not
[2:05:28] [Applause]
[2:05:33] are still uh
[2:05:35] but i think what
[2:05:36] moves me
[2:05:38] the most and this weekend
[2:05:42] was the spirit of unity
[2:05:44] that i felt
[2:05:47] and you know i felt as
[2:05:50] brother tom ministered and brother burly
[2:05:54] i felt that i was a part of a bigger
[2:05:56] picture
[2:05:58] than
[2:05:58] just here
[2:06:00] this is my part to play
[2:06:03] but i i really feel that god is
[2:06:08] gathering
[2:06:09] that bride to bed together
[2:06:12] you know we're promised a time
[2:06:15] of uniting
[2:06:17] were promised an invisible union
[2:06:20] and
[2:06:22] it's marvelous when you sense
[2:06:26] that that head
[2:06:27] is coming down and that capstone
[2:06:30] is uniting and and uh
[2:06:34] you know i mean uh
[2:06:37] you know just
[2:06:38] and
[2:06:39] it's not always the great big adults i
[2:06:41] mean
[2:06:42] a lamborghini had me dancing in my seat
[2:06:45] back there you know what i mean so uh
[2:06:50] i i mean when you can start to see the
[2:06:52] spirit of god move in our our children
[2:06:55] and
[2:06:56] and and you know that's if the lord
[2:06:58] tarries that's the generation i i i'm
[2:07:01] not worried if the lord takes me
[2:07:04] you know what i mean because this this
[2:07:06] word is going to go on and on and on
[2:07:10] and
[2:07:11] you know i thought about it many times
[2:07:14] uh
[2:07:15] as you know i i came into the message
[2:07:17] early 70s and
[2:07:19] and it's it's been a long time and you
[2:07:22] would think well you know
[2:07:25] you know brother branham would become
[2:07:26] history and the message will
[2:07:29] be passed and then i just got
[2:07:31] realizing it's
[2:07:33] it it's so him
[2:07:36] you know what i mean that we are
[2:07:39] breaking into eternity
[2:07:42] you know what i mean the thoughts of god
[2:07:44] the very thing that god had in mind
[2:07:48] is actually materializing
[2:07:51] you know and
[2:07:52] in the message he said in sirs we would
[2:07:55] see jesus he said
[2:07:57] he said
[2:07:58] it's all because god is becoming
[2:08:00] tangible
[2:08:02] and uh you know i'm so thrilled about
[2:08:06] that you know that
[2:08:08] that how we support one another and love
[2:08:10] one another and i thought i don't know
[2:08:12] how many different languages
[2:08:14] we sang in
[2:08:16] uh
[2:08:17] tonight
[2:08:18] you know what i mean but he understood
[2:08:20] every one of them amen and i felt the
[2:08:23] spirit of god in every one of them and i
[2:08:27] i think that's a beautiful thing because
[2:08:29] the lord said they will know that you
[2:08:31] are my disciples by your love one for
[2:08:34] another he never said by your doctrine
[2:08:36] never said by your teaching
[2:08:39] never said by anything but he said by
[2:08:41] your love one for another and that's
[2:08:44] where the victories won
[2:08:46] is one in love divine
[2:08:48] and in the word to the church he said
[2:08:50] you know just remember the enemy will
[2:08:52] try to break you up
[2:08:54] he said but you pull your belts tighter
[2:08:57] you put your arms around one another and
[2:08:59] you pray for one another and you
[2:09:01] remember everybody is in this together
[2:09:05] and you can't make it
[2:09:07] without one another so it's a beautiful
[2:09:10] body it's a beautiful time and
[2:09:14] and i'm so grateful i just can't express
[2:09:18] my appreciation for the ministry my
[2:09:20] friend brother tom and the gospel he
[2:09:22] preached i really feel that we've been
[2:09:25] empowered
[2:09:26] this week
[2:09:28] and that we can take the courage i i
[2:09:32] believe that we've got to have courage
[2:09:35] and that we can stand on what we believe
[2:09:39] and god will stand with us
[2:09:41] we can testify
[2:09:43] to what's in our hearts and god will
[2:09:46] vindicate it
[2:09:47] we're not in this alone
[2:09:50] amen he's here with us and the spirit's
[2:09:53] with us and the spirit will move
[2:09:55] so we can leave those things which are
[2:09:57] behind and press for a higher calling so
[2:10:01] i just if i could just make each one of
[2:10:04] you feel
[2:10:05] as important as you are to him
[2:10:10] you say how important are you to him
[2:10:13] he left
[2:10:14] the glory and came down
[2:10:17] amen and when
[2:10:19] he was hanging there on the cross as the
[2:10:22] song says you were on his mind
[2:10:25] my name was on his lips
[2:10:29] amen and that's him
[2:10:32] and i i just can't say enough about him
[2:10:35] and
[2:10:35] and where he found me and where he
[2:10:37] brought me from and
[2:10:39] and i'm glad i'm not alone i want you
[2:10:42] all to know that i'm glad i'm not alone
[2:10:45] i'm on a journey and
[2:10:47] and i know we have a great hearts desire
[2:10:50] to have a facility that
[2:10:52] that accommodates our needs and i
[2:10:56] believe that's just right around the
[2:10:57] corner but i feel
[2:11:00] more satisfied now
[2:11:03] that the spirit that's moving amongst us
[2:11:06] that we're ready to inhabit
[2:11:08] the tabernacle with the right attitude
[2:11:11] the right spirit the right goals
[2:11:14] the right faith and the right belief to
[2:11:16] make it worthwhile
[2:11:19] and so that that thrills me
[2:11:23] you know i just have to ask for your
[2:11:26] prayers
[2:11:27] and and your
[2:11:29] kindness and your mercy towards me as we
[2:11:33] you know we seek the lord for the gospel
[2:11:35] to bring i don't have another gospel
[2:11:37] than that which has been brought to us
[2:11:40] amen and i just trust that we can
[2:11:43] continue
[2:11:44] to go into the storehouse
[2:11:47] and bring out the things that are there
[2:11:51] that our messenger has for us
[2:11:53] amen
[2:11:54] does anybody know it all yet because i
[2:11:58] would certainly want to
[2:12:02] offer it to you but
[2:12:04] i think he can certainly still feed us
[2:12:08] amen so i i know we're growing and
[2:12:12] you know i i
[2:12:14] i always
[2:12:17] listen to that
[2:12:18] message perfect strength and perfect
[2:12:21] weakness and it doesn't give me much of
[2:12:23] a way out
[2:12:25] you know i mean i i
[2:12:28] i've got what is it called add
[2:12:32] you know and
[2:12:33] you've probably experienced that with me
[2:12:35] i'll be talking to you and right in the
[2:12:38] middle of a conversation walk off
[2:12:41] you know but
[2:12:43] my mind
[2:12:44] and all of a sudden i'm gone
[2:12:47] i have facial recognition disorder
[2:12:53] and that's not good
[2:12:55] because i can't remember a face
[2:12:58] and so if two people look the same i
[2:13:02] can't tell them apart and then that
[2:13:04] creates a complex
[2:13:06] and i get a shame because i don't know
[2:13:08] which name to call them
[2:13:10] and you know so i got a lot of reasons
[2:13:12] and excuses
[2:13:14] not to be here
[2:13:16] and i don't know how i ever got here
[2:13:19] and then the prophet says you can't use
[2:13:22] your excuses
[2:13:26] so then i think well maybe i can go over
[2:13:28] to some of my abilities you know
[2:13:31] i i can be pretty persuasive so i just
[2:13:35] and
[2:13:36] and and then i can't use that either
[2:13:40] but there is one thing i can use
[2:13:43] and that's the vindicated word of god
[2:13:46] and that's what we all want anyway isn't
[2:13:48] it
[2:13:49] so we're a body
[2:13:52] we're a very unique body
[2:13:55] we're made out of i think over 13 or 14
[2:13:58] different african countries uh different
[2:14:02] countries from central america
[2:14:04] philippines for all over the place
[2:14:07] but there's one thing that's brought us
[2:14:09] together
[2:14:10] and that's the holy spirit
[2:14:12] and and let's just
[2:14:14] let nothing come
[2:14:16] in between so
[2:14:18] as for our song the thing i'd like to
[2:14:21] sing that blessed be the tie
[2:14:23] that binds and let's just stand together
[2:14:26] and
[2:14:31] [Music]
[2:14:36] we're going to say a prayer
[2:14:39] and just in your heart just pray for
[2:14:42] everybody around you
[2:14:46] and in your heart
[2:14:48] say in your heart if i could say this
[2:14:50] father i'm a part of this body
[2:14:53] and this body is a part of me
[2:14:57] you place me here
[2:14:59] with this group of people
[2:15:01] and i'm going to serve this group of
[2:15:03] people with all my heart
[2:15:06] and if you call me from this place to
[2:15:08] serve you somewhere else
[2:15:11] i'll never forget them
[2:15:13] i'll take them with me in the depth of
[2:15:15] my soul
[2:15:18] and i thank you father for the love that
[2:15:22] you've placed on my heart
[2:15:24] lord i ask you to bless this people
[2:15:26] tonight
[2:15:28] give them the desire of
[2:15:32] their heart
[2:15:35] father with their struggles that
[2:15:39] they face because the flesh wars against
[2:15:42] the spirit
[2:15:45] the doubts that
[2:15:47] arise because the enemy is the accuser
[2:15:50] of the brethren
[2:15:53] all the battles that they have may they
[2:15:55] know that there's one that
[2:15:57] [Music]
[2:15:59] never leaves them
[2:16:01] or never forsakes them
[2:16:05] and will take them all the way through
[2:16:09] may they leave this
[2:16:10] place closer to you lord jesus
[2:16:14] feeling your love
[2:16:16] purposed and dedicated
[2:16:18] to your cause
[2:16:20] we ask it lord jesus
[2:16:23] because you're so gracious
[2:16:25] and so wonderful
[2:16:27] and so personal
[2:16:29] amen will you sing it with me bless
[2:16:33] [Music]
