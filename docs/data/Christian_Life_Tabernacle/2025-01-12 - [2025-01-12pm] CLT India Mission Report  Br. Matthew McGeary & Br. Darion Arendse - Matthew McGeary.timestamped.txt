[52:55] beyond praise
[52:58] father it's the recognition of your
[53:00] supreme
[53:02] authority it's the ackowledgement that
[53:05] you are the maker and creator of Heaven
[53:07] and
[53:09] Earth that you're all knowing and all
[53:15] seeing and father that
[53:18] we acknowledge that by the footsteps we
[53:23] take and the words that come out of our
[53:26] mouth
[53:29] what it is that we
[53:32] portray and that we
[53:35] illuminate the atmosphere that we
[53:40] create father it's a total consciousness
[53:43] of your
[53:45] presence that's the worship that we want
[53:48] to
[53:48] [Music]
[53:51] have a life that says I belong
[53:56] we ask you to bless the people tonight
[53:59] in our evening
[54:01] Fellowship Lord bless their hearts for
[54:06] sacrificing and making this great effort
[54:09] this evening we ask you to be with us in
[54:13] Jesus precious name we pray amen amen
[54:18] God bless you you may be seated
[54:26] I don't know if this is a message here
[54:29] to me it says trust in the Lord with all
[54:33] thy heart and lean not unto thy own
[54:39] understanding in all the ways
[54:41] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[54:45] path amen I don't know if they're
[54:48] sending me messages up here but I
[54:50] believe every bit of it amen tonight you
[54:53] know where Matthew and is going to share
[54:55] with us brother Daren about their trip
[54:58] and whatever other words that they have
[55:01] on their heart to Fellowship but I think
[55:04] the thing that stir us up is that we
[55:07] never forget the far-reaching
[55:09] power of the gospel and and what it can
[55:14] do and and when it's preached what
[55:18] effect it can have you know you never
[55:21] can pre-qualify somebody as a believer
[55:26] I I I remember how so many of the when
[55:30] we started out in the message we would
[55:32] try to go find the lady with the long
[55:35] hair and the long skirts and and see if
[55:39] they would believe the message you know
[55:41] or or we'd always try to you know find
[55:44] somebody that was as closest to us
[55:48] well they they came right up to it they
[55:51] rejected it and so we try to say this is
[55:55] the type of person that'll hear the
[55:57] gospel and this is the type of person
[56:01] that will uh hear the
[56:04] gospel and maybe the person that would
[56:07] hear the gospel you'll just walk past
[56:09] because you say oh they just can't be a
[56:12] believer you know I wonder how many
[56:14] people would have witnessed to me if if
[56:17] I would have showed up the way that I
[56:19] looked when I was 18 and 19 years old
[56:23] you know you'd say this guy's scary you
[56:26] know we're not going to witness to him
[56:29] but just remember it's not the ground
[56:33] it's the
[56:34] seed amen that seed has been in all
[56:37] kinds of different ground if we went
[56:39] through here with everybody's
[56:41] testimony that was the ground that the
[56:44] seed was in this was the ground the seed
[56:46] was in but the seed is what comes to
[56:49] life and the seed comes to life by
[56:51] hearing the word of God and that's how
[56:54] the gospel spread by hearing blessed are
[56:57] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[57:00] and share the gospel so uh you will here
[57:04] tonight as Matthew shares with you their
[57:08] trip and scriptures and things that are
[57:11] on their hearts of the
[57:13] effect that the gospel has on people the
[57:19] true gospel will have an effect it'll
[57:21] have effect on
[57:23] unbelievers I I've been in hospitals
[57:25] with people people that don't believe in
[57:27] God or anything and they'll ask you to
[57:30] pray they'll bend down their hearts
[57:32] they'll pray with you they'll thank you
[57:34] their whole continence and everything
[57:37] changes because there's just something
[57:39] about the word of God what what is it
[57:42] about the word of God it is God and it's
[57:45] more powerful and sharper and a
[57:48] two-edged sword and there's nothing like
[57:51] it so sit back tonight and enjoy as as
[57:54] the brothers share share with you uh uh
[57:58] the journey you're part of that Journey
[58:00] you helped finance their trip your
[58:03] prayers went with them they went in your
[58:07] name they knew where you who they were a
[58:09] part of and uh some of the people have
[58:14] even tuned in and listened to some of
[58:16] the services so uh uh it's a great thing
[58:20] so you might say I just have this little
[58:23] teeny part that I play but it takes
[58:26] every part playing their part to make it
[58:29] all work we're a body and and this it's
[58:33] a body work a body of Believers and we
[58:36] all share in all of this together so
[58:39] tonight this is not only Matthew and
[58:42] daren's testimony it's your testimony of
[58:45] what God's done through your prayers and
[58:47] your offering and your support so God
[58:49] bless you brother Matthew if you'd come
[58:52] and and uh we just trust the Lord bless
[58:54] you tonight God
[58:58] bless okay praise the Lord here we
[59:03] are
[59:06] happy noty a place to get
[59:10] happy
[59:12] amen well let's just let's just read uh
[59:15] scripture Why Don't We Stand just to um
[59:17] always take the word and um we'll just
[59:22] see how the Lord would lead in this
[59:23] service we just want to share um
[59:26] our trip with
[59:28] you in um India and we'll just
[59:35] uh yes that that message uh Proverbs
[59:40] 3:5 that was for all of
[59:43] us so if we can read
[59:48] that and as I was just
[59:51] um meditating about the trip to India it
[59:54] was kind of um
[59:56] there's just so many Supernatural
[59:58] components to it and uh there was so
[1:00:00] much going on here um and many uh things
[1:00:05] were facing here on this side that um
[1:00:09] the door was open but I I just um
[1:00:12] trusted the Lord uh because I showed up
[1:00:15] in India I didn't know where I was
[1:00:18] going I didn't know anything really I
[1:00:21] just showed up and uh
[1:00:26] that's what we have to do is verse five
[1:00:28] says trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:00:29] heart and lead not to thine own
[1:00:32] understanding you know there's a way
[1:00:34] that a man would do something and many
[1:00:36] times um we like to plan out a vacation
[1:00:40] or we like to plan things out and it's
[1:00:42] good to be a planner um but many times
[1:00:46] uh we find out that our plans are
[1:00:47] different than God's plans and so we
[1:00:50] don't want to lean to our own
[1:00:51] understanding he says' in all thy ways
[1:00:52] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[1:00:55] paths amen we just ask a blessing upon
[1:00:58] the reading of the word why why we just
[1:00:59] go before him quickly Lord we just thank
[1:01:01] you for the reading of your word we know
[1:01:04] this is a missions report Lord
[1:01:07] and we know the people will be blessed
[1:01:09] Lord to see what you have done and in
[1:01:12] that Lord we're still in your presence
[1:01:15] there's still needs represented amongst
[1:01:17] us Lord and you know how to minister
[1:01:19] Lord so if you would have the right of
[1:01:22] way this evening and you come Lord you
[1:01:25] can take the things the testimonies the
[1:01:28] words that are said and breathe life
[1:01:30] into the people and you can meet each
[1:01:33] need still Discerning the thoughts and
[1:01:34] intents of the heart because you are God
[1:01:36] we commit this to you in Jesus Christ's
[1:01:38] name amen you may be
[1:01:41] seated amen we're just
[1:01:44] um
[1:01:46] um just by God's grace can uh well look
[1:01:50] at that thing go that's
[1:01:53] terrible yeah thank you for doing that
[1:01:57] that all right well we're working
[1:01:59] through some technical difficulties here
[1:02:01] let's see if we can do this
[1:02:04] again that worked Christian Life
[1:02:07] Tabernacle missions report that was the
[1:02:10] fastest missions report you ever
[1:02:12] seen God bless you it was good to be
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:16] here that's how fast things move in
[1:02:20] eternity all right so uh just want to
[1:02:23] give a mission report on India uh as you
[1:02:26] know um there's a Brother Sam who uh he
[1:02:29] he was coming out of Pentecost he's down
[1:02:33] in the Houston area and he started to
[1:02:36] research the message he heard about our
[1:02:37] church and he came all the way up here
[1:02:39] to be baptized properly in the name of
[1:02:41] the Lord Jesus Christ and he's still
[1:02:43] down in the Houston area and he believes
[1:02:45] this message with all his heart and he's
[1:02:47] doing what he can to spread the gospel
[1:02:50] and to witness to those and go to
[1:02:51] churches and I had kept up uh in
[1:02:54] fellowship and in touch with brother
[1:02:55] Brother Sam and he um let me know about
[1:02:58] some things he was doing he was doing
[1:03:00] some Zoom calls and had some contacts
[1:03:03] that he he had in India and wanted me to
[1:03:06] come on and so we came on and uh was
[1:03:09] encouraged by the word that he was
[1:03:11] presenting because he was um you know
[1:03:14] you can be you can be uh sometimes
[1:03:16] you're leery or you want to have
[1:03:18] discernment or wonder what's this all
[1:03:20] about and um you know I was encouraged
[1:03:22] that he was he was playing the message
[1:03:25] of the hour and a gap tape from Hindi uh
[1:03:27] from English into Hindi and I thought
[1:03:29] well that's okay now we're we're doing
[1:03:31] something and some people would say
[1:03:33] you're cooking with grease or you're
[1:03:34] cooking with I'm like all right this is
[1:03:37] this is what where it's all about so we
[1:03:38] spent some time on a couple of the zoom
[1:03:41] calls and then I I just you know
[1:03:43] something you got to be a fruit
[1:03:45] inspector and um I just thought if the
[1:03:47] doors open and they're if they're
[1:03:49] sticking around to hear the word of God
[1:03:50] we need to get those people in India
[1:03:52] connected with the bride body in India
[1:03:55] because there's nothing like the body of
[1:03:56] Christ the body will will minister to
[1:03:59] the needs it'll uplift it'll it'll guide
[1:04:02] it'll encourage and so that's why it's
[1:04:04] so important to be a part of a body God
[1:04:06] gives you a pastor and a five-fold
[1:04:08] Ministry and then each one of you that
[1:04:10] are living out the word of God you're a
[1:04:12] testimony and a strength and a burden
[1:04:14] Bearer and when you come into the body
[1:04:17] that it'll fit every need supplieth and
[1:04:20] and and every one of you are unique and
[1:04:22] fitly joined together and so I just
[1:04:24] thought in my heart I know in India that
[1:04:26] that um there's many um Believers in
[1:04:29] India who have uh embraced the message
[1:04:32] of the hour and there's established
[1:04:33] churches so in my heart my goal really
[1:04:36] in going to India is I wanted to connect
[1:04:38] to these contacts with the body in India
[1:04:42] because I know uh I can't go evangelize
[1:04:44] India I can't go there and it's a big
[1:04:47] place and a lot of people over 1.3
[1:04:49] billion people in India and so I just um
[1:04:53] I told the brothers in our context I
[1:04:55] said I'm willing to go and they said
[1:04:58] we'll have you and um it it turned out
[1:05:01] that they we'll come you come and we'll
[1:05:03] set up meetings and it turned into where
[1:05:06] um you know they would have maybe made
[1:05:08] the meetings as big as uh you would
[1:05:10] allowed them um but uh they started
[1:05:13] talking about well we can to have one to
[1:05:14] 200 ministers come and and uh we'll have
[1:05:17] um um and at first they wanted us to
[1:05:20] maybe go into the villages and certain
[1:05:22] places but I I was like well no we that
[1:05:24] might not be the way to go and I need to
[1:05:26] get in touch with somebody and I got in
[1:05:28] touch with uh brother Craig Boer I was
[1:05:31] in fellowship with him and he um got me
[1:05:33] in touch with a brother Roshan over in
[1:05:36] uh Punjab and he was our contact to have
[1:05:39] boots on the ground in India he is a he
[1:05:42] is an established uh believer he's a
[1:05:44] pastor there and um I Heard great
[1:05:47] testimony about those things so I got in
[1:05:49] touch with uh brother Roshan and said
[1:05:51] hey this is what we're looking to do I
[1:05:53] need your help uh to organize and to um
[1:05:57] meet with these men and to see if you
[1:06:00] can arrange these meetings and um My
[1:06:03] Brother David you know he he um came to
[1:06:06] me and was you know hey you know you're
[1:06:08] going to India you know and there could
[1:06:11] be a lot of downfalls and pitfalls there
[1:06:13] and and I just you know I remember
[1:06:15] telling him I say I I got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:17] over in India and he's like okay if you
[1:06:19] got the Holy Ghost in India we
[1:06:21] good because hey that's what it's all
[1:06:23] about right and brother Roshan just
[1:06:25] filled with the Holy Ghost and so I knew
[1:06:27] if if he was
[1:06:29] helping I would be okay and so really I
[1:06:32] just left it in his hands and um we were
[1:06:37] busy here and all of a sudden it was
[1:06:39] time to go to India and I was going to
[1:06:42] India and I needed somebody to go with
[1:06:48] me
[1:06:51] Hallelujah brother Daren had it on his
[1:06:54] heart to go and so he was able to go and
[1:06:57] I I want to say it was a very um uh
[1:07:01] packed trip um this is how our trip
[1:07:05] started um we left at 9:30 in the
[1:07:08] morning I believe on on
[1:07:10] Thursday and
[1:07:13] um we we we here we go we we flew into
[1:07:18] Newark New Jersey for some reason and
[1:07:20] had to drive an hour to JFK where we
[1:07:23] caught a plane for
[1:07:26] about 15 hours over to Delhi and we
[1:07:29] landed in Delhi to find out we had a 78
[1:07:33] hour bus
[1:07:34] ride to go to uh jalandar where brother
[1:07:38] Roshan picked us up and then we drove
[1:07:40] about another hour to his place arriving
[1:07:42] Saturday morning at 8:00
[1:07:44] a. and then we would uh Minister the
[1:07:46] following Sunday and we're going to keep
[1:07:48] traveling so I'll give give you a quick
[1:07:50] overview but you can just see how um
[1:07:53] this trip kind of unfolded we took about
[1:07:55] 10
[1:07:56] flights um and uh to cover the ground
[1:08:00] and go to these meetings where we could
[1:08:02] um this is over in our first set of
[1:08:04] meetings in Patna and uh bear which I
[1:08:07] believe I spelled bear wrong that should
[1:08:10] be an H there um and then we would we
[1:08:14] had to connect through Delhi for
[1:08:15] everything and the security over there
[1:08:17] is not security here it's ran by the
[1:08:19] military and they they are military and
[1:08:23] one terminal is out of the airport back
[1:08:24] into another terminal and we had to go
[1:08:26] through that every time so then we're
[1:08:28] taking another we're flying down into
[1:08:29] udar for our meetings in bonsoir this
[1:08:31] was the second set of meetings with
[1:08:33] ministers each meeting had about 100 to
[1:08:35] 200 ministers uh mostly Pentecostal
[1:08:38] ministers in the meeting and then uh it
[1:08:40] was quite a long drive down from the
[1:08:42] airport about four hours and as I'll
[1:08:44] show later that just because something's
[1:08:46] 20 minutes or 20 miles away in India
[1:08:48] doesn't mean you can get there in 20
[1:08:50] minutes um and we'll uh we'll take some
[1:08:53] time maybe to show some things just want
[1:08:55] want you to be a part of it so brother
[1:08:56] Stanley is a pastor in Mumbai uh he came
[1:08:59] with us to our meeting there on the
[1:09:01] North side at a Pentecostal uh Church
[1:09:04] there in North Mumbai and he was a great
[1:09:06] host enjoyed uh meeting him and so as
[1:09:10] you could see there was a lot of travel
[1:09:11] here that took place in about 12 days
[1:09:14] and I just wanted to do this to give you
[1:09:16] a little uh Insight on the travel and
[1:09:19] the ground that we
[1:09:21] covered um we spent a lot of time in
[1:09:23] cars and on an airplane and
[1:09:26] and uh in order to cover the ground we
[1:09:28] did and I tell you what there was
[1:09:30] nothing like getting back in the United
[1:09:31] States I was happy to be there you know
[1:09:34] uh you were close to home I when I got
[1:09:36] back in the States I was like you know
[1:09:38] brother brother Darion knows New York if
[1:09:39] we I started using you I have t uh TSA
[1:09:42] you know uh uh pre-check so I was with
[1:09:45] him through every line I got back on the
[1:09:46] back side of the trip I'm like you're on
[1:09:48] your own I'm we're in America now and I
[1:09:51] mean when we were out in the middle of
[1:09:52] nowhere in India you know we stuck close
[1:09:54] together we got back in America I felt
[1:09:55] like we were in our backyard like hey
[1:09:57] buddy you're on your own so I'm going to
[1:10:00] have uh brother Daren come and uh just
[1:10:04] uh maybe give a little a testimony of
[1:10:08] maybe what he uh experienced or what
[1:10:10] stood out to him and um I'll have him
[1:10:13] come at this
[1:10:17] time amen greet everyone in the
[1:10:20] wonderful and precious name of our Lord
[1:10:21] Jesus Christ s your privilege to stand
[1:10:24] before God's people people his bride
[1:10:26] elected not just here but also around
[1:10:29] the world um part of that elected called
[1:10:31] out people in this end time and the hour
[1:10:34] that we're living in that is so so
[1:10:36] crucial you know
[1:10:38] um um a few weeks before um uh the Bible
[1:10:44] study brother Matthew's Friday mornings
[1:10:45] we have the Bible study the Lord was
[1:10:47] dealing with me on some Q&A questions
[1:10:49] and answers preaching
[1:10:51] 122359 and I was like Lord I'm going
[1:10:53] through stuff at work why are you giving
[1:10:55] this but anyway long story short after
[1:10:59] Bible study Friday that Friday morning
[1:11:01] brother Matthew I go to his office
[1:11:03] because I wanted to talk to Brother Gary
[1:11:05] about something brother Matthew goes hey
[1:11:07] just the man the Lord LED in my heart to
[1:11:08] come and talk to I'm thinking to myself
[1:11:10] I'm not going to
[1:11:12] India but when the Lord takes things and
[1:11:15] turns your world upside down to perform
[1:11:18] his will you better make sure it's him
[1:11:21] so what I did was I obviously said as
[1:11:24] you did for Gideon Lord do for me first
[1:11:26] let the carton be dry and the ground
[1:11:28] around it be wet the next day let the
[1:11:31] carton be wet and the ground around to
[1:11:32] be wet uh dry so I put all these things
[1:11:36] in front of the Lord looking in the
[1:11:37] Bible in the scripture to make sure that
[1:11:40] I didn't want to go with brother Matthew
[1:11:42] as an
[1:11:43] obstacle but as an encouragement and as
[1:11:46] a witness because there were prayers for
[1:11:48] a companion for brother Matthew to go so
[1:11:51] God had to answer that
[1:11:53] request how I came into the play I don't
[1:11:56] know but that's God's business I'll ask
[1:11:58] you when I get there one day and you
[1:12:01] know it's it's amazing how God worked
[1:12:04] everything out to see God's hand just
[1:12:08] move obstacles move things in such a way
[1:12:11] that you cannot help but say this has
[1:12:14] got to be the Lord so you all have a
[1:12:17] Bible right if you want to raise it up
[1:12:18] come on hold it up so here's one of the
[1:12:22] first eye openening things that we
[1:12:24] experienc there we walking out of our
[1:12:26] church right with our Bibles in we walk
[1:12:28] around everywhere with our Bibles in our
[1:12:30] hand in India here's what we had to
[1:12:37] do hide your Bible you speak a word
[1:12:40] about God and Christianity you're
[1:12:42] getting to jail no questions asked like
[1:12:45] brother Matthew said the military was at
[1:12:46] the airport those guys had live ammo
[1:12:51] AK-47s they were not asking questions it
[1:12:54] was real so that is where God sent us
[1:12:58] for a purpose you know and as Brother
[1:13:00] David
[1:13:01] mentioned you all part of that if your
[1:13:04] prayers didn't go before us and go with
[1:13:06] us we would not be able to be as
[1:13:09] successful as we've been by God's grace
[1:13:12] he led us to brother Roshan Brother
[1:13:16] P wonderful Believers because just as
[1:13:19] our prayers on this side was Lord send
[1:13:21] us to the right people their prayers on
[1:13:24] that side was Lord send us the right
[1:13:26] people so the God was working on both
[1:13:28] ends and we were watching the hand of
[1:13:31] the Lord each step of the way you know
[1:13:33] brother Matthew was
[1:13:35] uh to say the least I I I told him and
[1:13:38] no disrespect to him or our pastor I
[1:13:41] love them I respect them I appreciate
[1:13:42] them I said I thought I left your dad
[1:13:45] here all the way there and back man I'm
[1:13:50] telling you what you'll see what I mean
[1:13:52] once he goes through the slides but um
[1:13:55] you know I want to apologize again to my
[1:13:57] wife this is what she put together for
[1:13:59] me on our trip of course I didn't do
[1:14:02] that I did my own little stupid thing
[1:14:04] but God received the glory to get back
[1:14:07] to the reality of this mission trip
[1:14:09] brothers and sisters to the way it went
[1:14:12] was we would start the services at 9:00
[1:14:14] in the
[1:14:16] morning and then there'd be a what we
[1:14:19] would call uh chai time where they'll
[1:14:21] have their chai tea and then brother
[1:14:23] Roshan would take the second part then
[1:14:25] they have lunch come back with some more
[1:14:27] preaching and then there's Q&A from 9:
[1:14:29] until 6:00 at night two Services
[1:14:31] wherever we went now you think it's easy
[1:14:34] to preach that long and then add to that
[1:14:38] the enemy attacking your body I don't
[1:14:40] know how brother Matthew did it I know
[1:14:42] he doesn't know this but I don't know
[1:14:43] how God kept him throughout all that it
[1:14:46] was what third or fourth day when we got
[1:14:49] the food poisoning brother Matthew went
[1:14:51] through rigors I mean I saw it like the
[1:14:55] S the F the second service we had we had
[1:14:58] lunch came back and he started shaking
[1:15:00] that evening like
[1:15:02] uncontrollably I know what rigers is
[1:15:04] because I had suffered of that too the
[1:15:06] Lord is sending a guy with an immune
[1:15:09] compromise system to a country where
[1:15:11] there's so many things going on what are
[1:15:13] you doing that is God working and the
[1:15:17] whole time I was watching the hand of
[1:15:19] God what brother Matthew was starting
[1:15:21] out with brother Roshan would continue
[1:15:24] the next day would be well the first day
[1:15:26] would always be the same
[1:15:28] thing the
[1:15:31] baptism and then the tri Doctrine head
[1:15:34] on Boom knocked the devil right off his
[1:15:36] socks and the next day was let me
[1:15:38] introduce you to a messenger as there
[1:15:40] was no as was Moses this is a new
[1:15:42] messenger and the message was introduced
[1:15:45] brothers and sisters you I mean I told
[1:15:47] Brother Matthew if we should go again
[1:15:49] sign me up Lord worthy because it was
[1:15:54] immense intense yes 14 flights 12 days
[1:15:59] backtack Services hardly enough time to
[1:16:02] rest and sleep or even eat some days we
[1:16:04] didn't even eat I know there were a
[1:16:05] couple of days where I didn't eat
[1:16:07] anything but a couple of pieces of Fruit
[1:16:09] l 14 pounds and I'm trying to keep it
[1:16:13] off but we do thank you for all your
[1:16:16] prence your support it was really a
[1:16:18] blessed trip and um the people we met
[1:16:22] there brothers and sisters they are just
[1:16:25] on fire for the Lord you see in the
[1:16:27] slides that brother Matthew will present
[1:16:28] there'll be some scenaries where um you
[1:16:31] see the intensity of the the Believers
[1:16:34] taking notes now these are preachers
[1:16:36] pastors of churches they are taking
[1:16:38] notes from the morning to the evening
[1:16:41] asking when we had the when there was a
[1:16:43] Q&A they would just ask the questions
[1:16:46] and boom answer answer right to this
[1:16:49] scripture because you couldn't share the
[1:16:51] message of the hour yet was scripture
[1:16:54] first
[1:16:55] that's where we went all the way to
[1:16:56] scripture brother Matthew and and the
[1:16:58] other preacher we went to the scripture
[1:17:00] every single time and you could see the
[1:17:02] Enemy being defeated every single time
[1:17:05] like that just like that boom boom boom
[1:17:07] and the next day was introduction to
[1:17:09] here's a message that God sent a prophet
[1:17:13] it was just unbelievable so I thank the
[1:17:15] Lord for making me a part of this even
[1:17:18] though I went Kicking and Screaming I do
[1:17:20] thank him for his grace and his Mercy
[1:17:22] brother Matthew
[1:17:29] if anybody wants a gift idea for brother
[1:17:32] Daren he brought this to
[1:17:36] India he needed a carryon bag just for
[1:17:39] his
[1:17:42] Bible I mean that's hey at least he
[1:17:45] brought the the right thing he brought
[1:17:47] the word of God Amen if if uh if I
[1:17:51] forget to share this part he talked
[1:17:52] about questions and answers and there
[1:17:55] was some uh you know there was
[1:17:57] definitely people opposing and some
[1:17:59] Elders that were asking questions um
[1:18:02] that were trying to cause problems and
[1:18:04] uh one of the organizers was getting
[1:18:06] really worried and I told him I said
[1:18:08] brother Chandon don't worry I said we're
[1:18:10] teaching the people how to fight I said
[1:18:12] because they're going to go back to
[1:18:13] their Villages they're going to go back
[1:18:15] to their churches go back to their
[1:18:16] elders and they're all going to
[1:18:18] challenge them and they're going to have
[1:18:19] to answer the questions themselves I
[1:18:21] said so let them ask the question we're
[1:18:23] teaching them how to fight
[1:18:28] and if you know I almost wanted to maybe
[1:18:30] you know you want to know what we
[1:18:31] believe look into the
[1:18:33] Bible and um we'll just try to continue
[1:18:36] before we get all fired up so as uh
[1:18:39] brother Daren alluded to it was a long
[1:18:42] journey so there were times we felt
[1:18:46] funny and there was times we looked
[1:18:50] funny and I have to say this is probably
[1:18:52] my most favorite picture of the tree
[1:18:56] I mean look at brother
[1:18:57] Daren I mean that's
[1:19:00] awesome I believe he he he he called
[1:19:03] back to his wife or something like that
[1:19:05] and when he got off the phone he had
[1:19:06] taken off the tie because uh I know she
[1:19:09] didn't have that in
[1:19:12] mind when she packed for him but I mean
[1:19:14] that is some color and if you'll notice
[1:19:16] on the bottom there it says I do not
[1:19:18] speak Hindi because everybody talked to
[1:19:21] brother Darion in Hindi and I would just
[1:19:24] laugh
[1:19:25] matter of fact they tried to split us up
[1:19:27] at the airport one time and we're like
[1:19:29] he's with him he's like but that's okay
[1:19:30] go go he doesn't speak Hindi the
[1:19:32] military guy goes he don't speak Hindi
[1:19:35] like no so he he he finally got tired of
[1:19:39] explaining himself so if he had a sign
[1:19:42] to hold up in Hindi that would have been
[1:19:43] it I do not speak
[1:19:45] Hindi and as you can see I didn't want
[1:19:47] to uh leave my brother out uh to drive
[1:19:51] by himself so I threw up a funny picture
[1:19:52] of myself that happened so um long trip
[1:19:57] we got into as you as we said I don't
[1:19:59] know we'd probably been traveling about
[1:20:01] 24 25 hours and we got to Deli and this
[1:20:05] uh brother here brother pip as we would
[1:20:07] have thought was brother pip um was
[1:20:10] there to receive us brother Roshan um um
[1:20:14] like I said I showed up at the airport
[1:20:16] and I called brother Roshan and said I'm
[1:20:18] here and he's like okay I wasn't able to
[1:20:21] make it here's a picture of the guy
[1:20:23] that's going to pick you up
[1:20:25] send me your picture so I sent a picture
[1:20:28] and I walked out of the airport and U
[1:20:30] you know especially in areas like that
[1:20:32] you know you have a little Street Smart
[1:20:33] you you don't make eye contact with
[1:20:35] people because everybody wants to sell
[1:20:37] you carry your bags they want to they
[1:20:39] want to give you a tour of India and and
[1:20:41] so I just I just avoided the crowd right
[1:20:44] away and little did I know there was a
[1:20:46] guy holding up a sign with my name on it
[1:20:48] I'm never the guy with a with with
[1:20:50] that's looking for somebody holding up
[1:20:52] my name with a sign so I got around to
[1:20:54] the the side I called brother ocean and
[1:20:56] he got a hold of um brother pip and he
[1:20:59] found us and we connected and so then as
[1:21:02] little did I know we we thought we were
[1:21:04] going to be getting on a plane to to go
[1:21:07] to um Punjab but we found out that that
[1:21:09] plane was cancelled and so we had about
[1:21:11] a seven eight hour bus ride so we we
[1:21:13] flew all I don't know we'd been
[1:21:15] traveling 24 26 hours and showed up you
[1:21:18] know ready for a hotel and it's like NOP
[1:21:21] we got an 8 hour bus ride I'm like well
[1:21:23] praise the lord well when I sh showed up
[1:21:25] the reason I shared that scripture is
[1:21:27] because when I tell you you you when I
[1:21:30] showed up there and didn't really um
[1:21:32] know all what was going on I I said
[1:21:34] brother Darion one word you're we're
[1:21:35] gonna have to get really familiar with
[1:21:36] is TR r s t trust and so we got on this
[1:21:41] uh bus ride and it's about um like I
[1:21:46] said with the stops about eight hours
[1:21:47] heading from Deli up towards Punjab and
[1:21:50] I'm talking
[1:21:52] to what I believe is brother deep and
[1:21:55] I'm like well so how long have you known
[1:21:56] brother ran and he looks at me goes well
[1:21:59] I don't know
[1:22:01] him I'm like you you don't know brother
[1:22:03] rashan he's like no I don't know him I'm
[1:22:05] like
[1:22:06] huh and I looked over at brother Darren
[1:22:08] he's like
[1:22:12] trust here I am in the middle of India
[1:22:14] on a
[1:22:15] bus the guy I'm with doesn't know where
[1:22:18] I'm so so and what was he was supposed
[1:22:20] to be my interpreter and the guy sitting
[1:22:22] next to him started interpreting for for
[1:22:24] for us back to
[1:22:26] him so um and and then after talk well
[1:22:29] how long have you lived in Punjab and
[1:22:31] everything got got around to it and it
[1:22:33] was all about accent he doesn't know
[1:22:35] brother rashan but he knows brother
[1:22:42] Roshan so I was in the right place I was
[1:22:45] on the right bus with the right guy he
[1:22:48] knows brother Roshan so I I learned to
[1:22:50] pronounce his name properly it's brother
[1:22:51] Roshan you'll find a lot of Americans
[1:22:53] pron pronounce his name amongst the
[1:22:55] brothers here we'll say brother Roshan
[1:22:56] we carry that out but it's brother
[1:22:57] Roshan so we ironed that out real quick
[1:22:59] and I was like okay we're in the right
[1:23:00] place so we we drove all the way up like
[1:23:03] I said about 8 hours we left uh 9:30
[1:23:06] a.m. Thursday morning traveled for about
[1:23:09] 35 hours to get to uh to gandar where
[1:23:14] brother Roshan picked us up and brought
[1:23:16] us to his house about a 45 minute
[1:23:18] another hour drive to his house and um
[1:23:21] we showed up there about 8 in the
[1:23:22] morning on Saturday
[1:23:25] and so um we there uh Saturday was uh
[1:23:29] you know after a long travel like that
[1:23:30] we're going to rest a little bit but
[1:23:31] there was some things we had to to do
[1:23:34] and this is where we met uh brother
[1:23:36] peush which was very
[1:23:38] instrumental uh I mean I can't even
[1:23:41] begin to tell you how instrumental
[1:23:43] brother PE was he was he was everything
[1:23:46] on the journey he we he he took care of
[1:23:48] all the finances all the uh all the
[1:23:52] taxes I mean he just he he did
[1:23:55] everything uh and these brothers carried
[1:23:57] our bags they were just so uh wonderful
[1:23:59] I can't say enough about brother peush
[1:24:02] and brother rosan um and these are
[1:24:05] real missionaries themselves uh brother
[1:24:09] Roshan has been I think to over 25 maybe
[1:24:12] 30 countries and he had done so much
[1:24:16] travel that God dealt with his heart and
[1:24:17] he just said you know I need to do this
[1:24:20] in my own
[1:24:21] country and so I don't know how many
[1:24:24] years that's been over that's transpired
[1:24:26] but for years now he's been laboring
[1:24:28] right there in India to get the gospel
[1:24:31] in the native language to his people and
[1:24:34] so if there was a person or a brother in
[1:24:37] India God got us to the right man for
[1:24:40] the job and so we were um uh that's
[1:24:43] brother peush and brother Roshan and um
[1:24:47] I don't know why this keeps doing
[1:24:50] that I'm trying to tap lightly here I
[1:24:52] don't know where we're at we just fired
[1:24:55] right ahead all right we'll try to be
[1:24:56] diligent here and just touch it it
[1:24:59] worked all right this is a picture of
[1:25:01] brother Roshan and sister proma um in
[1:25:04] front of their Church uh we were only at
[1:25:06] his place for one night uh but they took
[1:25:09] really good care of us so we got in um
[1:25:12] that Saturday rested met with Brother PE
[1:25:14] and them and then we had service um
[1:25:17] Sunday morning and this is a picture of
[1:25:21] their uh congregation brother Roshan was
[1:25:23] born in into a Pentecostal family and
[1:25:26] heard about the message and he is the
[1:25:29] only if I could say it this way
[1:25:30] Christian convert in his whole assembly
[1:25:32] probably has some
[1:25:34] 250 um Believers or more but all of them
[1:25:37] have been converted out of Hinduism or
[1:25:39] sism so that uh no Christian converts
[1:25:43] all of these were converted right out of
[1:25:46] um the main belief there in his
[1:25:49] country and uh here's a little uh
[1:25:52] picture just of us uh We've we've
[1:25:55] completed so like I said we got in on
[1:25:56] Saturday we ministered Sunday morning
[1:25:59] and they prepared a wonderful lunch by
[1:26:02] behind they have a fellowship hall in
[1:26:04] the back there but now our journey is is
[1:26:06] is going we're going to now get uh
[1:26:09] travel about two or three hours up to
[1:26:12] the airport where we'll stay that night
[1:26:16] and then um we'll get up at 3:45 in the
[1:26:19] morning to start our journey over to um
[1:26:23] Patton which is in bear um so back to
[1:26:27] Delhi and now we're going to come over
[1:26:29] for our first set of meetings um on
[1:26:32] Monday which start um in Patna um and by
[1:26:39] the time all the traveling was done we
[1:26:41] got to the hotel and maybe had an hour
[1:26:45] before we had to go to the meetings the
[1:26:47] meetings started at 4M and so um
[1:26:50] everything and by this time um
[1:26:55] it's showing on brother
[1:26:58] Darion and uh you know I've been through
[1:27:00] the ringer a few times on on overseas
[1:27:02] work and it it'll you know you just uh
[1:27:06] you got to roll with the punches that's
[1:27:07] for sure um so just to show where we're
[1:27:11] at in India so those four stars
[1:27:13] represents the very top one in Punjab
[1:27:15] there and uh um is where brother Roshan
[1:27:19] is and then this will be our first set
[1:27:20] of meetings here in bear in the town
[1:27:23] called patma atna and um I just wanted
[1:27:27] to um show you that the hotel the from
[1:27:31] the hotel to the meetings I think was
[1:27:35] only three
[1:27:37] miles um but getting
[1:27:41] there was was a little bit of a
[1:27:45] challenge um because there are no rules
[1:27:48] really other than don't get
[1:27:50] hit and if you have a horn you use it
[1:27:54] everybody I mean if you hear this it's
[1:27:56] just everybody's beeping everybody's
[1:27:58] beeping and so um it took us a little
[1:28:00] longer to get certain places you'd look
[1:28:02] it up oh that's five miles away but um
[1:28:04] five miles could uh that that could be
[1:28:08] an adventure needless to say so and I
[1:28:11] and I had another one I I just to show
[1:28:13] you because this was on the way to the
[1:28:15] meetings and it took us a little bit
[1:28:17] longer to get there and you'll just
[1:28:19] notice people walking beeping honking
[1:28:23] driving
[1:28:26] or you know and and you look over here
[1:28:28] on the left and all the motorcycles will
[1:28:30] will just go through every little Gap
[1:28:32] and then you'll find out people will be
[1:28:33] walking through the Gap at the same time
[1:28:35] of
[1:28:36] motorcycles and um you uh um you have to
[1:28:40] be really uh diligent and and uh uh
[1:28:44] watching your surroundings as as you
[1:28:46] would I mean you just weave in and out
[1:28:48] of motorcycles and I mean it's amazing
[1:28:52] it's Controlled Chaos at its finest
[1:28:55] so that was um that was about how it
[1:28:57] would happen and so now we've gotten
[1:28:59] through the traffic we're pulling up to
[1:29:01] our first set of meetings and this was
[1:29:03] in a nice uh a a Christian School
[1:29:06] complex or a a Bible College maybe not a
[1:29:08] Bible College some type of a religious
[1:29:11] college that um Chandon was able to
[1:29:14] secure for us to have the meeting so I
[1:29:16] wanted to show you this walk into was a
[1:29:19] nice uh facility here at this place uh
[1:29:22] we're going to be housing
[1:29:24] about 150 ministers um uh food and and
[1:29:29] housing and before I continue uh much
[1:29:32] further uh brother mangit was a a a very
[1:29:35] uh enormous um blessing in uh feeling
[1:29:40] the need to help um provide for the
[1:29:43] financial responsibilities over there
[1:29:45] and so I just want to let him know it
[1:29:47] was a it was a great need we committed
[1:29:49] to this trip and it came at a time where
[1:29:52] um all the help we we received was just
[1:29:54] a tremendous blessing so this is the
[1:29:57] first facility that we're we're at and
[1:29:59] also brother Tommy and just certain ones
[1:30:01] and our pastor and each one of you that
[1:30:03] all gave uh uh was just uh all every bit
[1:30:07] of it that you contributed if it wasn't
[1:30:09] financially with your prayers was a big
[1:30:11] help and so um here is uh this is as we
[1:30:15] just got there brother Chandon was there
[1:30:18] uh to meet us he was the contact that
[1:30:21] Brother Sam had so um the Brother Sam
[1:30:25] was visiting a Pentecostal Church in
[1:30:27] Houston and he um he was trying to
[1:30:31] witness and he went to the church and he
[1:30:33] made a contact UM with somebody that was
[1:30:36] visiting from India in the Houston area
[1:30:39] and that's how all of this started to
[1:30:41] transpire you never know how God will
[1:30:43] will will use something as long you
[1:30:45] always want to be so in one planet one
[1:30:48] water but God gives the increase you
[1:30:49] always want to be sewing seed and and
[1:30:51] looking for lost souls brother chanon
[1:30:53] was there uh to meet us and
[1:30:57] um um this would start our meetings um
[1:31:02] man this thing is
[1:31:04] interesting doesn't work too good every
[1:31:06] time does it but that's okay the devil's
[1:31:09] fighting the devil's
[1:31:11] fighting he's a defeated
[1:31:14] foe technical difficulties can be good
[1:31:16] sometimes you know all right let's see
[1:31:19] if we can get back this thing's a little
[1:31:21] finicky I guess well that's just amazing
[1:31:23] amazing maybe we'll just have the
[1:31:25] brothers uh do it we'll have to say next
[1:31:29] can y'all help me out Brothers all right
[1:31:32] here we go we'll we'll abandon the uh it
[1:31:34] worked good for a little bit all right
[1:31:36] we we pass this now all right that's
[1:31:39] okay everybody feeling all right praise
[1:31:41] the Lord all right we're moving
[1:31:44] along all right so this was customary
[1:31:48] for them uh they like to uh give you
[1:31:51] some flowers a lay um and welcome you in
[1:31:55] it's part of the custom next
[1:31:58] slide um and this just is a little
[1:32:00] picture of the
[1:32:04] Gathering
[1:32:07] continue and this is just a a short
[1:32:10] audio clip
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:25] okay next clip so this is the Gathering
[1:32:28] we had about um you know at least a
[1:32:30] hundred ministers and pastors here um in
[1:32:35] in these meetings and um we we just uh
[1:32:39] we didn't really um like I said we just
[1:32:42] showed up there and um before you know
[1:32:45] it I mean with all the travel and
[1:32:46] everything you're at the meetings and
[1:32:48] they're saying hey come come come up and
[1:32:52] um I had I had thought about you know
[1:32:56] um it's it's very different you know
[1:32:58] you're going to speak to 100 200
[1:33:01] ministers and pastors um they're uh
[1:33:04] mostly in Pentecostalism and uh going to
[1:33:06] have false doctrines and things and so I
[1:33:09] it's not like you prepare a sermon um or
[1:33:12] or anything like that so we just went
[1:33:14] with our Bible and one thing that had
[1:33:18] resonated uh with me was was something
[1:33:21] that uh brother brandom said he said in
[1:33:22] the last age we've come back you know to
[1:33:25] the Capstone Revelation that Jesus
[1:33:27] Christ is Lord and and I just was
[1:33:30] meditating on the Capstone Revelation
[1:33:33] and some of those uh the principal
[1:33:35] things that we believe and just in my
[1:33:37] heart um uh would want to just see how
[1:33:41] the Lord would lead if you can go to the
[1:33:43] next
[1:33:44] slide and so this is Brother Roshan
[1:33:47] preaching um just wanted you to maybe
[1:33:50] hear the delivery and how um the
[1:33:52] services would go
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:14] and so um what was really neat is I the
[1:34:17] way it happened is I took I would take
[1:34:19] the first um
[1:34:22] service and just to to start um speaking
[1:34:25] and you know really uh uh I I just
[1:34:29] started to maybe just tell about my how
[1:34:32] my candle got
[1:34:34] lit you know it just because you're at
[1:34:37] the witnessing at somebody's table or to
[1:34:40] a coworker at work the word of God works
[1:34:43] what did the prophet say just tell them
[1:34:46] how your candle got
[1:34:47] lit so just because you're in front of
[1:34:50] 200 ministers doesn't change the formula
[1:34:55] sir the word of God
[1:34:57] works it works every
[1:35:00] time so if you want a witness to
[1:35:02] somebody or you want somebody to believe
[1:35:04] the message of the hour tell them how
[1:35:05] your candle got lit don't become a
[1:35:09] theologian I got this all figured out I
[1:35:11] got this quote I'm gonna tie it all
[1:35:13] together you're just gonna you're just
[1:35:15] gonna sound like all the white noise of
[1:35:17] everybody telling them you are you
[1:35:18] should believe what I believe you can't
[1:35:21] get warm by a painted fire
[1:35:24] so you can explain the message all you
[1:35:26] want but if you start to tell them how
[1:35:28] something's changed your life they'll
[1:35:31] listen and they'll see you know what
[1:35:33] they have something I don't have and we
[1:35:35] just started there and and by God's
[1:35:37] grace the Holy Ghost came and um we
[1:35:41] found oursel hitting the trinitarian
[1:35:43] doctrine and water baptism
[1:35:45] headon and start to lay in the
[1:35:48] principles of what we believe and and
[1:35:51] what we have to do I is is show me in
[1:35:55] the
[1:35:56] Bible um you know I can't say brother
[1:35:58] brandham
[1:36:01] said
[1:36:04] right and and I and maybe we could have
[1:36:07] more to say about that later but what we
[1:36:09] have to do is show in the Bible and the
[1:36:13] only reason I can show in the Bible is
[1:36:16] because we received a Vindicated Prophet
[1:36:18] to show us in the
[1:36:21] Bible and so what was amazing is as we
[1:36:25] would
[1:36:27] um lay in there and and um where I would
[1:36:31] stop whatever scripture orever place I
[1:36:34] was at brother Roshan would just get up
[1:36:35] there and continue right right with it
[1:36:39] and so it it was it was very neat just
[1:36:41] to see it didn't matter really uh uh uh
[1:36:44] the glove if I could say it like that
[1:36:46] God was just uh walking the people
[1:36:48] through the scriptures and and uh I
[1:36:51] wouldn't have had this on there but the
[1:36:52] the brothers uh pushed me to have a a
[1:36:55] clip of of me saying something
[1:37:00] um come with words of there's
[1:37:04] wisdom my preaching wasn't what I could
[1:37:07] figure out with my
[1:37:09] life but my
[1:37:12] preaching was
[1:37:14] ow
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:17] Administration you can be
[1:37:19] changed and you can be filled with the
[1:37:22] Holy Ghost
[1:37:24] you can receive a new
[1:37:26] nature yeah they all liked that until I
[1:37:29] started hitting their pet
[1:37:33] doctorine yeah yeah we all do it we're
[1:37:36] all guilty of it all agree and say we
[1:37:39] all believe we all believe but let
[1:37:40] somebody get to where you're
[1:37:42] living and then it's like wait a second
[1:37:44] I thought we were friends no I am your
[1:37:46] friend that's why I'm getting where
[1:37:47] you're
[1:37:48] liveing that's what the word of God
[1:37:50] should do and um brother random had made
[1:37:55] this
[1:37:56] statement um he
[1:37:58] said uh preach the gospel Mark 16 preach
[1:38:01] the gospel to Every Creature what is
[1:38:03] that in other
[1:38:04] words demonstrate the power of the Holy
[1:38:07] Ghost had to be now watch to every not
[1:38:08] just teach the word he never said go
[1:38:11] teach the word he said go preach the
[1:38:13] gospel not teach the word preach the
[1:38:15] gospel and these signs shall follow them
[1:38:17] that
[1:38:19] believe this gospel in my name they
[1:38:21] shall cast out Devils they shall speak
[1:38:22] with new tongues if they would not take
[1:38:24] up uh they they would take up serpents
[1:38:26] or drink deadly things and it wouldn't
[1:38:28] harm them if they lay hands on the sick
[1:38:29] they shall recover and they went forth
[1:38:31] said the scripture preaching everywhere
[1:38:33] the Lord working with them confirming
[1:38:35] the word with signs following that's the
[1:38:38] gospel the gospel on
[1:38:41] display and you know it was uh uh quite
[1:38:44] as I you know thought about the trip I
[1:38:46] was thinking about well you know I I'm
[1:38:49] I'm not qualified you know or you I'm
[1:38:52] going to be standing in front of 100 200
[1:38:55] ministers and um you know when you when
[1:38:58] you have an absolute you always go to it
[1:39:01] you know you always go to the word of
[1:39:02] God and and um I took a lot of of of
[1:39:07] encouragement in that quote just preach
[1:39:11] the gospel okay Lord I'm not may maybe I
[1:39:16] I'll just go let you have your way Lord
[1:39:19] you know I'll just go preach the gospel
[1:39:21] you don't have to start doing something
[1:39:23] differently oh be what God made you go
[1:39:26] uh the Holy Girl still bring it to you
[1:39:27] as you have need of it and so that's
[1:39:29] kind of that's just how the the the trip
[1:39:32] went and um here um uh before we move
[1:39:37] into this slide um so we the first day
[1:39:40] there in patana um uh we I we the first
[1:39:44] day we got there at 4 we had three
[1:39:45] services I took two of them we had
[1:39:47] questions and answers and then the next
[1:39:50] day um uh I took the first first service
[1:39:54] brother uh Roshan took the second one
[1:39:57] and then the third service um we blew
[1:40:00] the place up
[1:40:02] um we uh did another questions and
[1:40:04] answers we had a time where some of the
[1:40:06] elders and them were were were standing
[1:40:08] up and they were saying well we've we've
[1:40:11] received the Holy Ghost and we've
[1:40:12] already been baptized in the titles and
[1:40:16] um so we had already plainly walked
[1:40:19] through scriptures showing all the
[1:40:20] scenarios and circumstances of of of
[1:40:23] water baptism and I just took the Bible
[1:40:26] and I said you know what I I I I said I
[1:40:28] can't tell you to what to do with the
[1:40:30] word alls I can do is give you the word
[1:40:32] and I said and if you're telling me
[1:40:34] you've been baptized in the titles
[1:40:35] father son Holy
[1:40:38] Ghost and and you have the Holy Spirit I
[1:40:41] said your testimony doesn't match the
[1:40:47] Bible we're not we're not we're not here
[1:40:50] to you know we're here to tell the truth
[1:40:53] right because it's the truth that'll
[1:40:55] make you
[1:40:55] free and um we we we we then challenge
[1:41:02] them on water baptism and challenge them
[1:41:04] I said show me in the
[1:41:06] Bible challenge them with and I and I
[1:41:09] lifted up by you show me any different
[1:41:11] way I said everyone and we dealt with
[1:41:13] Revelation and Peter having the
[1:41:15] Revelation and with that Revelation what
[1:41:17] he did we could all these things as our
[1:41:19] pastor was saying this we know all these
[1:41:20] things but now we're showing it in the
[1:41:22] Bible
[1:41:23] you have to be able to show it in the
[1:41:25] Bible and as we challenged all them then
[1:41:28] to be baptized properly three people
[1:41:31] stood up and um I thought well you know
[1:41:35] pray praise God one soul is worth 10,000
[1:41:37] worlds well there was some of the elders
[1:41:39] in the congregation and so I told the
[1:41:41] three to come forward and we went out
[1:41:43] and um and then I had to go back in and
[1:41:45] get something when I came back out
[1:41:47] brother R's like well all they they they
[1:41:49] want to get baptized also and by that
[1:41:50] time the whole hallway had full filled
[1:41:52] up and I was like which ones want to get
[1:41:54] baptized he said all of them and so we
[1:41:57] had about 60 to 70 ministers standing in
[1:42:00] the hallway that all wanted to be
[1:42:01] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:09] Christ so now we we have to find a place
[1:42:13] to baptize him and if there was any
[1:42:15] place I didn't want to be in India was
[1:42:17] in a river
[1:42:25] yeah yeah Lord knows so um where there
[1:42:30] was some concern some of the brothers
[1:42:31] had already been arrested and um
[1:42:35] arrested for baptism and things like
[1:42:36] that so uh they said look brother
[1:42:39] Matthew you being out there um you know
[1:42:42] um being from America and being the
[1:42:45] white man it's going to cause so much
[1:42:46] attention and stir he's like it it
[1:42:49] probably not not good that um you do it
[1:42:51] so um there's a there's a place that you
[1:42:54] can stand and look out and you can watch
[1:42:56] from afar and I thought
[1:42:58] hey
[1:43:00] Hallelujah wait I didn't say that who
[1:43:03] was that guy just
[1:43:05] talking so I'm up there on this this uh
[1:43:08] Lookout and I'm filming this and so I
[1:43:10] wanted y'all to just to get a a little
[1:43:12] view of this River this is the gangus
[1:43:14] river uh this is a holy River to them
[1:43:17] this is uh something that is very sacred
[1:43:20] to them I think they they will put the
[1:43:23] loved ones in this River to carry them
[1:43:25] away um and as you look off the back we
[1:43:28] we got all these uh little buggies
[1:43:30] you'll see a picture of one of those um
[1:43:32] later but all the brothers we we hired
[1:43:34] out all these taxis if you don't say
[1:43:36] Uber premium you're going to get one of
[1:43:39] those little buggy show up take you
[1:43:42] somewhere so that's all the brothers
[1:43:43] coming off the buggies they're going to
[1:43:44] start uh their little Trek across the
[1:43:46] sand and uh start going down towards the
[1:43:49] water um but there's anti-conversion
[1:43:51] laws there so um you got to be careful
[1:43:54] we weren't wanting to bring a bunch of
[1:43:55] attention being that this was a holy
[1:43:57] River and a popular place for people to
[1:43:59] come um it it was there was some
[1:44:02] obstacles and challenges there
[1:44:05] um and so um this is just another clip
[1:44:09] showing us getting onto the boats um
[1:44:13] because by God's grace this there were
[1:44:16] some boats over there that were for
[1:44:18] higher and uh one of the brothers had
[1:44:20] the idea you know if we can get on these
[1:44:22] boats
[1:44:23] and um go to the other
[1:44:26] side and uh I remember after it was all
[1:44:28] said and done you know we got about
[1:44:30] 45 um people over there and after it was
[1:44:34] all sudden done they they told me how
[1:44:36] much it was I'm like it cost how much
[1:44:38] and then I found out it was only $40 us
[1:44:40] I'm like that's pretty
[1:44:42] good so um that's everybody getting on
[1:44:45] the boat there and so what we did is we
[1:44:48] um we we got in these little boats here
[1:44:51] on the Gish River and if you could see
[1:44:53] how it looks white practically behind
[1:44:54] the boats it it's hard to breathe in
[1:44:57] some of the places um I I don't know if
[1:45:00] it was just the time of year maybe
[1:45:01] somebody had mentioned that um maybe
[1:45:03] weather was building but the smog and
[1:45:05] the pollution was just down in the town
[1:45:07] it looked like the whole place was on
[1:45:08] fire everywhere he went you could smell
[1:45:10] it I mean you could you could you
[1:45:12] couldn't see anything we were looking at
[1:45:14] the maps and uh brother Gary's like did
[1:45:17] you see the mountains I like you
[1:45:20] couldn't see a skyscraper across the
[1:45:21] street you know you you couldn't really
[1:45:24] see that far off and you can tell that
[1:45:25] Haze back there um that the the they
[1:45:29] burn a lot of things and there's so U
[1:45:31] much population there that U the air
[1:45:33] quality there's a real problem um yall
[1:45:37] should be thankful for the air that we
[1:45:39] have in Dallas Fort Worth and I don't
[1:45:41] even mean that sarcastically one bit um
[1:45:45] so this is um we had to move quickly um
[1:45:48] so we about 30 of the brothers that
[1:45:51] wanted to get baptized had to catch AE
[1:45:52] TR to get back to their part of the
[1:45:54] country so about 30 of them made it out
[1:45:57] and uh we finally got set up and um I
[1:46:00] wanted you just to see some of the
[1:46:02] baptisms because you're a part of this
[1:46:04] and so it was just one after another um
[1:46:08] coming into the water and baptizing them
[1:46:11] and um as you can see we had to move
[1:46:13] very
[1:46:14] quickly I mean just one after another
[1:46:18] yes I sped it up a little bit because I
[1:46:20] I for the sake of time I wanted you to
[1:46:22] be able to see but these brothers are
[1:46:23] just coming out one after another
[1:46:26] baptize them in the name of the Lord
[1:46:27] Jesus Christ uh was just a tremendous uh
[1:46:30] Victory and the love divine uh to have
[1:46:33] the opportunity was was an amazing
[1:46:36] blessing um one thing that was about
[1:46:39] this trip that that encouraged me really
[1:46:41] was the one thing that settled my heart
[1:46:43] from the very beginning is all the men
[1:46:45] that I was involved with weren't trying
[1:46:46] to build their own kingdom Brother Sam
[1:46:49] was like brother if the Holy Ghost leads
[1:46:51] you go you go eat every brother nobody
[1:46:53] was pressing to to get a notch in their
[1:46:55] belt or to to to be the guy or anything
[1:46:58] like that everything was just let the
[1:46:59] Lord have his way and and that really
[1:47:01] gave a great peace on this trip and um
[1:47:05] so this was brother brother Darion was
[1:47:08] our um our videographer
[1:47:12] here um and so just wanted you to
[1:47:15] actually see some of the baptisms taking
[1:47:20] place sure so when you see these
[1:47:23] brothers coming in groups they had to do
[1:47:25] it for a purpose couldn't have too many
[1:47:27] people crowded and then also some of
[1:47:29] them changed clothes and handed their
[1:47:31] pants and their shirt to the others to
[1:47:33] go and get
[1:47:36] baptized well now you
[1:47:38] know I didn't even know that yeah so
[1:47:41] they were trying to just not cause too
[1:47:43] much attention um as we would travel
[1:47:45] over there because everybody I was
[1:47:47] wanting to be um um aware of the
[1:47:52] political climate and the
[1:47:54] anti-conversion laws um so we we uh
[1:47:59] completed the baptisms and this might
[1:48:02] not be too pleasing to the ear to to
[1:48:05] hear this but I just wanted to share
[1:48:07] this with you because it it was a
[1:48:09] special moment coming back on the boat
[1:48:12] and brother Roshan let me said these
[1:48:13] brothers just want to praise the Lord in
[1:48:15] their native
[1:48:17] tongue and uh I don't they didn't even
[1:48:20] really know the language from what I
[1:48:21] understand but these these SE ones were
[1:48:23] from the same Village and they just uh
[1:48:24] they wanted to start praising the Lord
[1:48:26] and I wanted to share that with
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:44] you y'all were on us on this boat
[1:48:48] so each one of you was with us
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:08] so I thought that was just really uh a
[1:49:10] neat experience uh coming back on that
[1:49:13] boat and them just praising the Lord in
[1:49:15] their native tongue we we we baptized 29
[1:49:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ 29
[1:49:20] ministers and pastors so that was a
[1:49:22] tremendous Victory and this was our ride
[1:49:25] back to the uh the meeting place and I
[1:49:28] actually drove that
[1:49:30] thing um you know when you ride in the
[1:49:32] front the steering wheel or the you know
[1:49:35] the whatever you call those things are
[1:49:37] right there and you're kind of both
[1:49:40] sitting up there and he's like leaning
[1:49:41] over like this I'm like let me give that
[1:49:43] a try and so uh that's a scary place to
[1:49:46] drive I just let you know that much so
[1:49:49] we just arrived back in that buggy that
[1:49:51] is a very very Cal mode of
[1:49:54] transportation there so brother Matthew
[1:49:57] driving 35 miles hour three of us
[1:49:59] sitting in the back no seat belts and
[1:50:01] brother Matthew's driving there's a
[1:50:03] pothole we're dead that's how it went no
[1:50:06] you can't go before God's
[1:50:10] time I mean that is that is the word of
[1:50:13] God there was no pothole going to take
[1:50:15] us
[1:50:16] out however we want to be uh we want to
[1:50:19] be good stewards of what God has given
[1:50:21] us so so uh and it he's he's making that
[1:50:24] out to be something else uh than it was
[1:50:27] it was just a brief moment but we did it
[1:50:29] so we're back here um at uh the
[1:50:32] meeting's now coming to a close we got
[1:50:34] there on Monday this was on Tuesday and
[1:50:36] now um we're all about to say our
[1:50:39] goodbyes this is a a last final picture
[1:50:43] of the brothers that got baptized in the
[1:50:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we're
[1:50:47] just so thankful for that
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:50:56] so now we're going to head back to uh
[1:50:58] the hotel I I thought to leave this out
[1:51:00] but then I I I wanted to include it
[1:51:01] because this was one this is one of our
[1:51:03] contacts that Brother Sam has made um in
[1:51:07] uh bear uh this was brother Alex and his
[1:51:11] son to his right and his wife they drove
[1:51:13] two hours just to have dinner with us
[1:51:17] and um he he's an overseer of 400
[1:51:21] churches and several
[1:51:23] orphanages and um he uh wanted to meet
[1:51:28] us and so he was going to be in the
[1:51:31] meetings but through the I guess through
[1:51:33] customary he was supposed to be invited
[1:51:36] by the the local organizer and and we
[1:51:39] had invited him but that never happened
[1:51:41] so he he was a little reluctant to come
[1:51:43] but we at least ranged this meeting and
[1:51:46] um you know a long story short he
[1:51:48] basically asked me why I was in India
[1:51:51] you know you know just wondering you
[1:51:52] know um and he found out you know as I
[1:51:55] started to share with him um you know as
[1:51:57] I I started to um start to lay in there
[1:52:01] there's just uh there's no beating
[1:52:03] around the
[1:52:04] bush you know I came to India because I
[1:52:07] have a message and the message wasn't
[1:52:09] given to me it was given to a Vindicated
[1:52:10] Prophet who fulfilled Malachi 45 Luke
[1:52:13] 1730 Revelations 10 1-7 that's why I'm
[1:52:15] in India because I want you to
[1:52:18] know that God sent a prophet and we
[1:52:22] started started to walk down through the
[1:52:23] scriptures through Noah and Moses and
[1:52:27] John the Baptist and we uh went through
[1:52:31] serpent seed and it was about that time
[1:52:32] his son got up and came around and
[1:52:34] pulled his chair up right in between us
[1:52:36] and was feeding on on the truth and and
[1:52:40] as the Bible um was just uh opening to
[1:52:43] them as we shared these things um I
[1:52:46] thought it was you know as we started to
[1:52:48] talk to him even just to go further into
[1:52:50] no eternal hell and and pred destination
[1:52:53] and we had to spend some time on there
[1:52:55] because you find out um people get um a
[1:52:59] religious uh understanding of the
[1:53:02] scriptures and so um my we're so blessed
[1:53:06] if if the Lord would allow maybe later
[1:53:09] for for us to just know how blessed we
[1:53:11] are to have received the message of the
[1:53:13] hour which took a book that was closed
[1:53:15] and opened
[1:53:17] it and and many people think they know
[1:53:20] what they're looking at but really it's
[1:53:22] through a warped understanding of what
[1:53:24] men have probed at over the years and
[1:53:27] Satan through religion and an antichrist
[1:53:29] Spirit has presented a seed of
[1:53:31] discrepancy and the people have took it
[1:53:32] for truth and they're damned believing a
[1:53:37] lie that might be cutting but that's why
[1:53:40] there was a
[1:53:42] need for a
[1:53:47] prophet that's why we're in India that's
[1:53:50] why we should be at the gas station
[1:53:52] that's why we should be letting
[1:53:53] everybody know cuz people are believing
[1:53:56] in
[1:53:57] something that's been
[1:53:59] hybrid and it brings forth
[1:54:03] death and we have the
[1:54:06] answer we have the solution to all their
[1:54:12] problems it's the message of the hour
[1:54:15] and unfortunately now when we say a
[1:54:18] phrase like that I'm shocked that people
[1:54:22] somehow have missed what the message is
[1:54:26] the message is the Lord Jesus
[1:54:31] Christ and God sent a prophet to
[1:54:34] introduce us to the Lord Jesus
[1:54:43] Christ so when we say the
[1:54:48] message I'm not talking
[1:54:50] about anything other than the Lord Jesus
[1:54:56] Christ so um we we had this great
[1:55:00] opportunity to to to go through those
[1:55:01] things and to and and and he was as we
[1:55:04] shared that I I feel the Liberty just to
[1:55:07] say it even if it was to come into his
[1:55:08] ears I'm okay with it because as I would
[1:55:10] read out of Ephesians i' say as he hath
[1:55:13] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:55:16] of the world I said when did he choose
[1:55:19] us he says well
[1:55:22] because he was fighting against
[1:55:24] something I said I I understand brother
[1:55:26] I said but let me just read it again
[1:55:28] according as he is when did he choose us
[1:55:31] and he said well I said brother Alex I
[1:55:33] know you believe the Bible I said I'm
[1:55:36] just reading the Bible I I'm not
[1:55:39] spinning it I'm not trying to trying to
[1:55:41] work it any other way I'm just going to
[1:55:42] read what Paul said you believe the
[1:55:44] Bible he goes yeah I
[1:55:46] said according as his chosen us
[1:55:49] when for the foundation of the world and
[1:55:52] it got down to the heart of the matter
[1:55:54] he said but then what's the meaning of
[1:55:59] life but what's the meaning of life I
[1:56:02] said
[1:56:03] oh Lord help me I said brother I said
[1:56:07] there came a time in your union with
[1:56:09] your wife that you wanted to have a son
[1:56:11] is that the truth he said yes it's the
[1:56:13] truth I said and was he in you he saides
[1:56:16] he was in me I said but there had to
[1:56:17] come a time where that which was in you
[1:56:20] came into manifestation so you can have
[1:56:22] fellowship with the very thought you
[1:56:24] wanted to have fellowship with and he
[1:56:26] said yes I said that's the purpose of
[1:56:28] meaning in life I said I said if your
[1:56:30] son had need of anything I said would
[1:56:32] you not take care of it he said yes I
[1:56:34] said if you if I said would you leave
[1:56:36] your son to to burn or go into he and I
[1:56:39] started walking through I said why
[1:56:40] because you love him and I said now what
[1:56:42] about a gape
[1:56:47] love I said he would predestinate you he
[1:56:50] would make there sure there was no way
[1:56:51] what's the the meaning of life is God
[1:56:53] had attributes in him that he wanted to
[1:56:57] have fellowship with and you're the very
[1:57:00] manifestation of that attribute and now
[1:57:03] he can have fellowship with his sons and
[1:57:05] his
[1:57:06] daughters what's the meaning of life
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:10] Hallelujah but Satan has has Twisted
[1:57:14] truths like this in the peoples of mine
[1:57:17] I'll never forget one time I don't know
[1:57:18] how we got to preaching I'll never
[1:57:20] forget the time that I shared this with
[1:57:22] with a oh she was a a Godly Pentecostal
[1:57:25] sister and and and um I come to find out
[1:57:29] she on her way to church she she was
[1:57:31] holding her uh six-month old baby and
[1:57:33] they got in a car wreck and she lost her
[1:57:34] husband and her six-month old baby and
[1:57:36] and I was just thinking about that that
[1:57:38] that six-month old baby and I said you
[1:57:39] know praise God for
[1:57:41] predestination cuz I was thinking you're
[1:57:43] going to meet him again I was want to
[1:57:46] encourage her in the word and I said the
[1:57:48] wrong
[1:57:49] thing because there's a false doctrine
[1:57:52] that predestination is everything you do
[1:57:55] is already I was predestinated to pick
[1:57:58] that up I was pre and so what I was
[1:58:00] telling her is that God ordained
[1:58:02] that and and and and Satan knows how to
[1:58:06] to to twist the word of God where people
[1:58:09] don't want it when it's the very thing
[1:58:11] that'll save you and give you peace and
[1:58:13] will minister to your needs and help you
[1:58:15] through the hard times and through the
[1:58:16] trial so we had a wonderful opportunity
[1:58:19] just to to share what we believe and
[1:58:21] show home in the Bible we we walked
[1:58:24] through Genesis we we we walked through
[1:58:26] water B we walked through these things
[1:58:29] and where was it all Lan in the
[1:58:32] Bible you want to know what we believe
[1:58:34] look into the
[1:58:35] Bible so that was um that evening I
[1:58:39] believe which was Tuesday uh and then we
[1:58:42] would start our journey um from Patna to
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:47] bonara um so already a power packed uh
[1:58:51] trip
[1:58:52] and now we are going to um fly back to
[1:58:55] Delhi and then we're going to fly into
[1:58:57] udar um and then uh it took about three
[1:59:01] or four hours to get from there down to
[1:59:03] bons suara um oddly
[1:59:07] enough
[1:59:09] um and this is um by the time we got
[1:59:13] down um there now it's uh Wednesday but
[1:59:17] we traveled all day um from those
[1:59:20] flights and getting um
[1:59:22] there uh down we got there late evening
[1:59:26] uh just in time to to get by God's grace
[1:59:29] when we had arranged these meetings you
[1:59:30] know I I let brother Roshan know I said
[1:59:32] hey we we want to try to have good
[1:59:34] accommodations um uh Western
[1:59:37] accommodations would be
[1:59:38] appreciated and so um they they did just
[1:59:41] a fantastic job of of making
[1:59:43] arrangements but um but you know that um
[1:59:46] Western culture we we have toilets and
[1:59:49] uh two-thirds of the world don't they
[1:59:51] don't have those and and so um you know
[1:59:53] we get spoiled in certain ways and so I
[1:59:56] I wanted to be spoiled while I was
[1:59:58] there
[2:00:01] hey so I wanted some uh hopefully to get
[2:00:04] it well we finally showed up to a place
[2:00:06] where my room was supposed to be
[2:00:08] non-smoking but it wasn't and uh after a
[2:00:10] long day of travel I got to my room and
[2:00:12] they said we'll bring you hot water in a
[2:00:14] bucket and I'm like oh great I guess
[2:00:16] it's good to have hot some hot water
[2:00:18] than no hot water at all and so I didn't
[2:00:21] have any hot water the room but
[2:00:22] thankfully I had some brothers that had
[2:00:24] a room just down the hallway that had
[2:00:25] hot water ain't that right brother
[2:00:28] Darion and so um the next day uh would
[2:00:32] start our meetings here and now we're in
[2:00:34] um uh really south of bonaro for these
[2:00:37] meetings and uh it's in uh Rajon I
[2:00:40] believe is the way you pronounce the
[2:00:42] state so over in India uh there it's
[2:00:44] split up into States so when we say uh
[2:00:47] Punjab that is the state to the north
[2:00:49] then we were in bear that was the state
[2:00:51] over to uh the East and now we're in
[2:00:54] rajastan which banswara is in rajesthan
[2:00:58] and U now we're uh onto uh a two-day set
[2:01:01] of meetings with about 120
[2:01:04] 130 um ministers
[2:01:08] here and so this is uh just a little I
[2:01:12] wanted to show you a little footage of
[2:01:14] uh the grounds this is just out in a
[2:01:15] little village and there was a church
[2:01:17] that was built there um that we were
[2:01:20] able to um
[2:01:22] make the accommodations and as we start
[2:01:24] walking towards the church you'll notice
[2:01:26] a building to the right that's where all
[2:01:28] the ministers that stayed there they all
[2:01:29] just slept in sleeping bags u in that
[2:01:32] space for the ones that stayed
[2:01:41] [Music]
[2:01:58] so this was customary this
[2:02:00] is uh brother Darion getting his
[2:02:05] turban and
[2:02:07] uh this is all of us
[2:02:10] um in our um turban and our lays and if
[2:02:15] you'll notice to my uh to darion's right
[2:02:18] um as you're looking at the screen
[2:02:20] you'll be SEC second to the right right
[2:02:23] um uh that's brother giio who was our
[2:02:25] contact for this set of meetings and for
[2:02:29] our meeting in Mumbai and all the way um
[2:02:34] to the
[2:02:35] left um would be the local Pastor um who
[2:02:40] helped arrange uh the meeting in that
[2:02:43] area and so this is now going to set up
[2:02:46] the meetings we're going to come in uh
[2:02:49] and now we have um two services in the
[2:02:52] morning two so we call them services but
[2:02:56] really I would go maybe an hour and a
[2:02:58] half or so then we take a what they
[2:03:00] would call a tea break and then brother
[2:03:03] Roshan would go so we would we'd
[2:03:04] probably go about four hours um and then
[2:03:08] we'd have a lunch and then we'd go for
[2:03:10] another four hours and have questions
[2:03:11] and answers um and just uh so that's the
[2:03:16] uh setting the stage for these meetings
[2:03:18] here um that's the interior of the
[2:03:22] the
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:27] church they're singing songs as all the
[2:03:29] minist are coming in for the service
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:57] H
[2:03:59] [Music]
[2:04:01] H and so I this is going to be a little
[2:04:04] clip of brother Roshan preaching uh but
[2:04:06] uh as brother Darian alluded to these
[2:04:08] brothers really had a real hunger for
[2:04:10] the word of God and would lay in there
[2:04:13] uh writing down
[2:04:14] notes and underlining scriptures and
[2:04:16] really paying attention uh to the word
[2:04:19] of God and so you'll just you'll see um
[2:04:22] their attentiveness and also one time
[2:04:25] the power went out and uh the service
[2:04:28] just kept going right on in the dark um
[2:04:30] it was I have a clip of that but uh I
[2:04:33] think we maybe can show you that another
[2:04:36] time
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:43] [Music]
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:05:04] it was a it was it was a joy to work
[2:05:07] with um um brother brother oan um he was
[2:05:13] there was talking about um the
[2:05:15] attributes Jehovah Gyra Jehovah tku and
[2:05:18] then talking about Jehovah yashu
[2:05:20] manifested in the flesh
[2:05:22] and um I this was the trip where we we
[2:05:26] we got sick I wasn't able to make the
[2:05:28] next day um we came down really bad the
[2:05:31] night before um and it was really
[2:05:34] interesting God works everything out uh
[2:05:36] for the good um because I'm working
[2:05:39] through an interpreter so it takes twice
[2:05:42] as long uh to say it and the second day
[2:05:45] oddly enough the local pastor and um um
[2:05:50] the organizer
[2:05:52] um they they weren't able to make it uh
[2:05:55] to the service and so um so brother
[2:05:58] Roshan just took his his time and the
[2:06:01] day and it was the last day we we had we
[2:06:04] had um everything you know you could
[2:06:06] feel everything was building to just you
[2:06:08] know really drop the bomb you know uh we
[2:06:11] lay everything out there you know the
[2:06:12] need for a prophet and come down to the
[2:06:14] present day truth and what we had
[2:06:16] ministered on I just went there with the
[2:06:18] the thought in my mind of of the
[2:06:21] revelation of Jesus Christ and how the
[2:06:24] the that comes from the word apocalypse
[2:06:26] which is an unveiling and how something
[2:06:28] is covered and has to be um unveiled and
[2:06:31] so we are just laying that through
[2:06:32] scriptures and and how what it took for
[2:06:34] an unveiling and the next day brother
[2:06:36] Roshan came in and took the day
[2:06:38] introduced uh them to the message of the
[2:06:41] hour and now um they all were in
[2:06:43] agreements of the need of a prophet now
[2:06:45] we're getting all of them the uh the the
[2:06:47] church age book so that was another uh
[2:06:50] all 130
[2:06:52] uh ministers and pastors all want the
[2:06:53] church age book and we're receptive to
[2:06:55] the teachings of the message of the hour
[2:06:58] so I tell you what an
[2:07:00] opportunity isn't that
[2:07:05] [Applause]
[2:07:07] wonderful so now we're finishing up
[2:07:10] in um Rajon here we're going to start
[2:07:13] our journey back towards um the
[2:07:17] airport um we so we drive it we finished
[2:07:20] uh the the meeting
[2:07:22] there um I believe this would have now
[2:07:25] been Friday um so we're going to drive
[2:07:28] about 4 or five hours and feeling like I
[2:07:30] did oh we needed the help of God and
[2:07:33] then we'd stay that night and then um
[2:07:35] Saturday morning we flew to
[2:07:37] Mumbai um and so now we're there uh this
[2:07:41] is
[2:07:42] Saturday um that's uh the next day then
[2:07:46] we drove up for the meetings on Sunday
[2:07:48] in Mumbai uh brother Stanley was there
[2:07:51] there to uh pick us up and uh when we
[2:07:54] got in um on Saturday that really was
[2:07:58] the first day where we had an evening uh
[2:08:01] of of rest there was nothing scheduled
[2:08:03] so um and by that time brother Daren was
[2:08:06] filling uh fing filling it as well and
[2:08:09] so it was very much needed I tell you
[2:08:12] one thing you don't want to be doing
[2:08:14] when and this isn't like you know um you
[2:08:17] get a little bad food at a at a
[2:08:19] restaurant here you know sometimes
[2:08:20] overseas you can take up something
[2:08:22] that'll mess you up for quite a while
[2:08:24] and um so we were just I appreciate
[2:08:27] y'all's prayers and and the concern and
[2:08:30] uh the Lord certainly was was gracious
[2:08:32] to us last thing you want to do is hop
[2:08:34] in a car for four or five hours to get
[2:08:36] on an airplane you know but uh you're
[2:08:38] just trusting in God the whole way and
[2:08:40] he certainly was gracious so now we're
[2:08:42] at our last um set of meetings um it's
[2:08:45] going to be at just a local church uh
[2:08:47] Gio uh would be the organizer of this
[2:08:51] meeting um it was just at a school so
[2:08:55] now we're here in Mumbai it's going to
[2:08:57] be in the in the north um brother
[2:09:00] Stanley was our transportation he's a
[2:09:03] pastor um in Mumbai in the city there uh
[2:09:07] which I come to find out it's a real
[2:09:09] expensive city to to live in uh could be
[2:09:11] a challenge there um he's uh just a was
[2:09:16] became the pastor of the church uh been
[2:09:18] working with it for a few years though
[2:09:19] and whe the Tim DOD was just with him
[2:09:22] the week before I got there so um
[2:09:25] brother Stanley's doing a work there in
[2:09:27] Mumbai and he arranged for someone to
[2:09:30] speak at his church and came with us to
[2:09:32] support uh going to this um this this
[2:09:36] church here with brother
[2:09:38] Gio and um this is a picture of the
[2:09:42] Gathering uh the little kids would be on
[2:09:44] the very front they were attentive
[2:09:46] serving the lord and this was a little
[2:09:49] song that they were singing when we come
[2:09:50] in
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:10:15] so that was really the conclusion of the
[2:10:18] meetings there we um um if I could just
[2:10:23] I I was in in no um condition to
[2:10:27] minister but um if I didn't Minister um
[2:10:32] they weren't going to have us so um I
[2:10:37] just uh thought well we we don't want to
[2:10:39] lose the opportunity and I figured if
[2:10:42] there if I if I have to go under these
[2:10:45] terms so we we just come in and and uh
[2:10:51] we let them know what we believe and we
[2:10:52] did questions and answers and and we
[2:10:55] dropped another bomb off in that
[2:10:57] place um but we let them know and I'll
[2:11:00] say if you're going to do Mission
[2:11:03] work I think it's very
[2:11:06] important to tell them that God sent a
[2:11:09] prophet I mean you can tell them
[2:11:12] about the doctrines that we believe but
[2:11:14] you got to tell them the
[2:11:17] [Music]
[2:11:18] source I'm I I don't know how I'll to
[2:11:21] say it but you can go try to line line
[2:11:24] somebody out and get them all
[2:11:26] doctrinally right but if they're not
[2:11:28] connected to the Life Source that God
[2:11:30] provided for the
[2:11:32] age I I just only know I only know one
[2:11:36] way it works I'm
[2:11:37] sorry I I know there's a voice that God
[2:11:40] has given to me and it brings life it it
[2:11:43] gives me everything that I have need of
[2:11:45] and that's what you want to get people
[2:11:47] in contact with so I I don't want to
[2:11:49] iron out everybody's doctor if they get
[2:11:51] in contact with him he'll iron it out
[2:11:54] and it's God's provided way in the end
[2:11:56] time to get in contact with him not not
[2:11:59] an outpouring of gifts and and uh uh
[2:12:02] blessings and and and tongues and all
[2:12:05] that yeah that that that falls on All
[2:12:09] Flesh God blesses many people right or
[2:12:13] wrong but to get in contact with God
[2:12:16] there's a provided way in the end times
[2:12:18] so um this kind of concludes our uh trip
[2:12:23] um now we will uh start our journey home
[2:12:27] um we finished the meeting
[2:12:29] Sunday and then we flew out uh on Monday
[2:12:32] which turned into be we flew all the way
[2:12:35] back to
[2:12:35] Delhi and then uh our flight was at
[2:12:39] 11:55
[2:12:40] p.m. Saturday night or what what day was
[2:12:44] it Tuesday night that's what happened on
[2:12:47] the whole trip we didn't know what day
[2:12:48] was what uh Christmas Eve is when we
[2:12:50] find finally uh got back home and um but
[2:12:55] I just wanted y'all to kind of see the
[2:12:56] magnitude of the trip I wasn't going to
[2:12:58] share anything and then uh uh on this
[2:13:01] scale but y'all were a part of it and so
[2:13:03] we wanted you to feel a part of it and
[2:13:05] so um you know that that's a little bit
[2:13:08] of the mission report while we were
[2:13:10] there in India and if if I could just
[2:13:11] maybe share um you know just uh briefly
[2:13:16] just what what would be on my heart or
[2:13:18] what we were wanting to accomplish there
[2:13:20] that's weird we can be done with the
[2:13:22] slides but as our our pastor you know
[2:13:25] was ministering and as I was thinking
[2:13:28] about our trip there and I just thought
[2:13:30] about looking to the Bible we got to be
[2:13:32] able to show people what we believe in
[2:13:34] the Bible and as our pastor was speaking
[2:13:37] about you know in nature there and and
[2:13:40] and feeding out of the the message
[2:13:42] thirst there's things that we do
[2:13:45] naturally if I could say it like this
[2:13:47] there's there's an instinct you get
[2:13:49] thirsty you don't have to you want water
[2:13:52] it it's a natural desire for you to go
[2:13:54] after water if you get thirsty and I
[2:13:57] just thought as he was ministering that
[2:13:59] there ought to be an instinct of the
[2:14:00] Holy Ghost in our lives there ought to
[2:14:03] be another something beyond the five
[2:14:05] senses but there gots to be an an
[2:14:08] instinct of the Holy Ghost and you know
[2:14:10] an instinct is an ability or a desire to
[2:14:13] perform a specific activity and I to
[2:14:16] tell you without the Holy Ghost you're
[2:14:17] only going to hold up so long and just
[2:14:20] as we read the quote uh uh Brother David
[2:14:22] read the quote uh this this morning if
[2:14:25] you don't feed the Holy Ghost it will
[2:14:27] die and I don't care what stage in the
[2:14:31] journey you are if you're Justified and
[2:14:33] you haven't received the Holy Ghost well
[2:14:35] what do you think it is that's
[2:14:36] justifying you it's the work of the Holy
[2:14:39] Ghost in your life if if you're living
[2:14:42] in a place of sanctification it's Theo
[2:14:44] it's the work of the Holy Ghost in your
[2:14:46] life so I don't care what phase you're
[2:14:48] in there's one thing and one thing alone
[2:14:50] and that's the the word
[2:14:52] only that's going to do it because you
[2:14:55] can't re rely on anything else but the
[2:14:57] word and so I was just thinking you got
[2:14:59] to have and we won't be long I'll try to
[2:15:01] uh uh I don't want to keep you I wanted
[2:15:03] to let off but uh my my pastor told me
[2:15:06] to preach too so we're just trying to be
[2:15:09] obedient so
[2:15:12] um there there ought to be a desire in
[2:15:16] your heart beyond the natural senses to
[2:15:19] fulfill the word of God
[2:15:21] because you're born again it's a new
[2:15:23] nature so there's an ability or a desire
[2:15:26] or a pull or a thirst there ought to be
[2:15:29] a thirst to read your Bible there ought
[2:15:30] to be a natural reaction as I was
[2:15:33] talking to Brother David you know
[2:15:34] there's a story about uh um you know the
[2:15:36] little uh snake that got cold it was on
[2:15:39] the road and it was picked up like well
[2:15:41] I I feel bad for this little thing I put
[2:15:43] it in Pocket got it War what happened
[2:15:45] after that snake got
[2:15:48] warm it was a snake to be
[2:15:51] with so you can't get hey why'd you bite
[2:15:54] me I took you up out of the cold I you
[2:15:56] were you were about to die and and and I
[2:15:59] saw you and I had compassion on you I
[2:16:01] picked you up and I put you in my pocket
[2:16:03] and I got you all warm and fuzzy and
[2:16:05] then you bit me and what would the snake
[2:16:07] say you knew I was a snake when you
[2:16:10] picked me up it's its nature or its
[2:16:14] Instinct and I I want to say that there
[2:16:16] ought to be something in the believer a
[2:16:19] holy ghost instinct that's that's that's
[2:16:22] instinctively carrying out the word of
[2:16:24] God and I was just thinking on this
[2:16:26] about you know uh uh the Instinct and
[2:16:28] what we believe you know and all the
[2:16:30] things that we'd say I would say you
[2:16:31] want to know what I believe look into
[2:16:33] the
[2:16:35] Bible now with that said and this is
[2:16:38] kind of by God's grace somehow tying in
[2:16:40] this mission report because you know you
[2:16:43] you can be looking in the Bible and not
[2:16:45] know what you're looking
[2:16:48] at especially I could you could fle over
[2:16:51] there I could say I'm looking in the
[2:16:53] Bible but I I can't I can't understand a
[2:16:57] thing in there because I'm not in
[2:17:00] position to know I would have to change
[2:17:03] my vantage point or something would have
[2:17:05] to happen to put me into a position
[2:17:07] where I could start to understand what
[2:17:08] was on the pages and and as I thought
[2:17:10] about this I was thinking there was once
[2:17:13] a a good man who was engaged to be
[2:17:15] married and and and and and he found a
[2:17:18] virtuous wife and he was was going to
[2:17:21] marry this this this young lady and and
[2:17:25] all of a sudden to his surprise he finds
[2:17:27] out she's with
[2:17:30] child now he was a just man and so he
[2:17:34] thought you know what I'm not going to
[2:17:35] put her away publicly but I will put her
[2:17:39] away privately but you see Joseph did
[2:17:41] not know what he was looking
[2:17:45] at right so here was a situation that
[2:17:49] happened and now he's looking at you can
[2:17:51] imagine how heartbroken he
[2:17:54] was and now the woman that he loved he's
[2:17:57] like what what do you mean but you see
[2:17:59] Joseph didn't realize he was actually
[2:18:02] looking at Isaiah
[2:18:05] 7:14 think about it now she's with child
[2:18:08] she's
[2:18:10] showing and Joseph's looking you've been
[2:18:15] untrue but what happened because I want
[2:18:19] to say this with without the prophecy
[2:18:22] Mary didn't make any sense and without
[2:18:25] Mary the prophecy didn't make any
[2:18:30] sense the the
[2:18:32] two had to become
[2:18:37] one but what happened to Joseph Joseph
[2:18:41] was confused he was
[2:18:43] heartbroken he was he didn't know what
[2:18:46] to do he's thinking on this thing and
[2:18:48] the Bible says in Matthew 1:20 said but
[2:18:51] while he thought on these things behold
[2:18:54] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[2:18:57] in a dream saying Joseph thou son of
[2:19:00] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[2:19:03] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[2:19:05] her is of the Holy Ghost you notice he
[2:19:10] was the angel of the Lord that
[2:19:12] eliminated the
[2:19:16] confusion where once Joseph didn't know
[2:19:19] what he was looking at but when the
[2:19:20] angel the Lord came it made sense of
[2:19:24] what the problem
[2:19:26] was so I can say you could be looking
[2:19:29] into the
[2:19:31] Bible and not know what you're looking
[2:19:33] at but if the angel of the Lord
[2:19:38] comes and I want to say this we'll try
[2:19:40] to end somewhere along these lines it
[2:19:43] took a visitation by the angel of the
[2:19:48] Lord Mary had plans
[2:19:52] M Mary uhh was a part of a community she
[2:19:54] was part of a family she was a Believer
[2:19:57] she was actually meditating on the very
[2:20:01] prophecy see Believers have special
[2:20:03] Insight how do you know that well it
[2:20:06] helps when the word makes itself flesh
[2:20:07] and tells
[2:20:11] you yeah when the word comes and tell
[2:20:14] you the waves were 12 foot high they
[2:20:16] were 12 foot high you wonder why he
[2:20:18] could tell stories like he was there
[2:20:19] well
[2:20:21] probably
[2:20:22] was might just be going back right into
[2:20:25] the scenario while he's talking about
[2:20:27] it
[2:20:29] yeah but see Joseph had all the
[2:20:32] confusion all the heartache he was
[2:20:34] meditating upon these things but when
[2:20:36] the angel the Lord
[2:20:39] came what seems so problematic what see
[2:20:42] which seems so
[2:20:44] chaotic when the angel of the Lord
[2:20:49] came fear not not
[2:20:52] Joseph Mary also think about all of her
[2:20:56] plans she she was looking forward to
[2:20:59] being
[2:21:00] married she was looking forward to
[2:21:02] taking care of Joseph and his kids say
[2:21:05] what are you talking about once again
[2:21:07] sorry I believe believe you know brother
[2:21:09] Jo Joseph already had kids so you know
[2:21:12] we can talk about that
[2:21:15] later but she had dreams she had a
[2:21:19] testimony but you know what happened to
[2:21:22] Mary she had a visitation by the angel
[2:21:25] of the
[2:21:26] Lord and everything she thought maybe
[2:21:29] she was going to carry out everything
[2:21:31] she thought she was going to do what
[2:21:33] made the
[2:21:34] difference I'm going try to end along
[2:21:36] these L but what made the difference a
[2:21:39] visitation by the angel of the
[2:21:42] Lord where he comes and says and the
[2:21:44] angel Luke 1:30 and the angel said un
[2:21:47] her fear not Mary for thou Hast found
[2:21:49] favor with God and behold Thou shalt
[2:21:51] conceive and in thy womb bring forth the
[2:21:54] son and shalt call his name Jesus he
[2:21:56] shall be great and shall be called the
[2:21:58] son of the highest and the Lord God
[2:22:00] shall give unto him the Throne of David
[2:22:02] his father and he shall reign over the
[2:22:04] house of Jacob forever and of his
[2:22:06] kingdom there shall be no end now I'm
[2:22:09] telling you this is could you
[2:22:11] imagine the
[2:22:13] message that she's receiving from this
[2:22:18] Angel you've also received a message
[2:22:20] from the
[2:22:23] angel then said Mary unto the angel how
[2:22:25] shall this be seeing I know not a man
[2:22:28] and the angel answered and said to her
[2:22:30] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee you
[2:22:32] want to know how you're going to
[2:22:33] manifest the message of the hour same
[2:22:37] way the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[2:22:40] and the power of the highest shall
[2:22:42] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[2:22:45] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[2:22:47] be called The Son of God you too are
[2:22:50] called to be pregnated with the word of
[2:22:52] God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth
[2:22:54] shall has also conceived in a son in her
[2:22:57] old age and this is the sixth month with
[2:23:00] her who was called Baron well I tell you
[2:23:03] she's probably very thankful for that
[2:23:05] word because she knows she could go
[2:23:06] check it
[2:23:07] out if he said it I bet she was I bet
[2:23:11] she was I can't wait to get there but it
[2:23:14] would be exactly how the angel said it
[2:23:17] for with God nothing shall be in
[2:23:20] impossible and Mary
[2:23:23] said let me think about
[2:23:25] it Mary said let me pray about it Mary
[2:23:29] said this is really strange I don't know
[2:23:31] let me talk to
[2:23:32] Joseph
[2:23:34] no Mary said behold the handmade of the
[2:23:38] Lord be it unto me
[2:23:41] according to Thy
[2:23:45] word according to what
[2:23:48] word the word word of the Angel of the
[2:23:55] Lord it ain't my word I didn't wake up
[2:23:59] one day and decide I was going to be a
[2:24:01] message believer I didn't wake up one
[2:24:03] day and think that I would say this but
[2:24:04] one thing I can say Lord let it be
[2:24:07] according to Thy
[2:24:13] word and the and Mary said behold the
[2:24:16] handmade of the Lord be it according to
[2:24:17] Thy word and the angel departed from her
[2:24:19] look Mary's plans change but God's plans
[2:24:22] never
[2:24:24] change and if I could try to just end
[2:24:28] here the Bible is God's
[2:24:33] plan the Book of
[2:24:35] Revelation it's the revelation of Jesus
[2:24:38] Christ and his Future
[2:24:42] Works through the church
[2:24:46] ages you can meditate on it
[2:24:50] you can look at
[2:24:53] it but until you have a visitation by
[2:24:56] the angel of the Lord you don't know
[2:25:00] what you're looking
[2:25:04] at I am not talking theology yes sir I
[2:25:09] am not talking message culture yes sir
[2:25:12] I'm not talking about Camp
[2:25:16] experiences I'm talking about a
[2:25:18] visitation
[2:25:24] by the
[2:25:30] angel it took a
[2:25:34] visitation for
[2:25:36] Mary to
[2:25:40] conceive Abraham was given the promise
[2:25:43] and it took a
[2:25:45] visitation by the
[2:25:47] angel for Sarah to conceive
[2:25:51] you see God's pattern and if the bride
[2:25:55] is going to birth the full word into
[2:25:58] manifestation it took a
[2:26:01] visitation what do you think Malachi 45
[2:26:04] was it was a
[2:26:07] visitation that God in the end times
[2:26:09] said I want to have a bride without spot
[2:26:11] or wrinkle but I must come
[2:26:14] [Applause]
[2:26:15] down we're all looking in the Bible
[2:26:18] wondering what it means yeah and it took
[2:26:22] a
[2:26:23] visitation God coming down and veiling
[2:26:25] himself in a man what was he doing he
[2:26:29] was take you were way over here looking
[2:26:31] into the
[2:26:32] Bible but he took you now and he changes
[2:26:35] your Vantage Point and brings you in to
[2:26:38] where now the book that you once
[2:26:40] couldn't
[2:26:42] understand he starts to tell you you
[2:26:44] want to know what I believe look into
[2:26:46] the
[2:26:47] Bible but I say we have interesting
[2:26:50] problem amongst
[2:26:54] us culturally many people believe the
[2:26:58] message
[2:27:02] culturally believe the
[2:27:04] message but if the Bible is not alive
[2:27:08] and open to you something's
[2:27:10] wrong if I could say it this way you
[2:27:14] cannot have the message without the
[2:27:17] Bible and I say what you want to say and
[2:27:20] you can't understand the Bible without
[2:27:22] the
[2:27:25] message and so we sit over here on one
[2:27:27] side God sent a prophet God sent a
[2:27:29] prophet God sent a prophet brother
[2:27:30] brandom said brother brandom said
[2:27:32] brother BR said but we can't even take
[2:27:34] the very thing the message was founded
[2:27:36] on and pick it up and Minister life to
[2:27:40] somebody with it something's
[2:27:44] wrong culturally we say we believe the
[2:27:47] message
[2:27:50] we we got to do more than teach our kids
[2:27:54] we got to get them in an atmosphere to
[2:27:55] be born
[2:27:59] again say
[2:28:01] Hy you even know what the message
[2:28:06] is
[2:28:09] well you can
[2:28:11] start you you have to start laying it in
[2:28:13] there
[2:28:15] that we didn't even understand what the
[2:28:17] Bible meant
[2:28:20] we thought it meant this we thought it
[2:28:21] meant
[2:28:23] that it had become
[2:28:27] hybrid and if the Bible and all these
[2:28:29] things we believe are laying in there
[2:28:31] you can't you can't come on this side
[2:28:33] and say brother brandom said brother
[2:28:35] random said brother random said and this
[2:28:36] not be alive to
[2:28:40] you you should be able to go out there
[2:28:44] which you know what a lot of us need we
[2:28:46] need our crutch to be knocked out from
[2:28:47] underneath us and I need a hand I say
[2:28:50] look into the Bible come here brother
[2:28:53] show me what you believe right here
[2:28:56] amen without your cell phone without
[2:28:59] your message search engine take the
[2:29:03] Bible show me water baptism show me
[2:29:06] Serpent seed show me the godhead amen
[2:29:10] show me the church ages show me
[2:29:12] predestination show me no eternal hell
[2:29:16] show me the ABCs Hallelujah
[2:29:20] yes but we built up some religion
[2:29:23] brother brandham said brother brandom
[2:29:24] said brother brandom said well you know
[2:29:26] what brother brandom said he said read
[2:29:28] your Bible and
[2:29:34] pray I I I want to be more spiritual
[2:29:37] what should I do get out your pen here
[2:29:39] comes a big answer from the prophet what
[2:29:42] can I do to be more spiritual brother
[2:29:44] read your Bible and
[2:29:48] pray amen but we we got a big crutch
[2:29:51] called the message brother Brandon said
[2:29:53] brother brandom said and I dressed right
[2:29:54] and I dressed this but when it comes to
[2:29:56] the
[2:29:57] Bible see that's the problem somebody's
[2:30:00] sick somebody needs to be saved somebody
[2:30:03] needs to be get the Holy Ghost and what
[2:30:05] they want you to do is make this
[2:30:08] live they don't know anything about the
[2:30:13] other they don't maybe know God's
[2:30:15] provided way in the end time was to send
[2:30:16] a prophet but that that end time prophet
[2:30:20] made this alive to you so you can take
[2:30:23] the very thing that's
[2:30:26] alive can you impart eternal
[2:30:30] life Jesus said whoever send you remit
[2:30:32] or remitted and whosoever sends you
[2:30:34] retain or retain you can take the Living
[2:30:36] Word and you can start to minister life
[2:30:39] to somebody and then they start to get
[2:30:41] thirsty and they start to want what you
[2:30:43] have you say oh I got so much for you
[2:30:45] but I didn't get it on my own it's
[2:30:47] according to Divine scripture
[2:30:51] that God would send a prophet or if I
[2:30:53] could say it this way that there would
[2:30:55] be a visitation by the angel if few
[2:30:57] musicians would
[2:31:00] come the only way I can go to India and
[2:31:03] have anything to offer is because God
[2:31:06] sent a
[2:31:11] prophet I some somebody said this uh you
[2:31:17] know I don't mind saying it
[2:31:21] you know was a I don't mind saying it
[2:31:25] you
[2:31:26] know Minister had left the
[2:31:30] message and he thought he'd be
[2:31:32] somebody come to find out without the
[2:31:34] message he didn't have any
[2:31:37] following he ran into another M
[2:31:41] Minister and he said you know brother I
[2:31:44] doubt he called him brother but this is
[2:31:46] the guy who left the message he goes
[2:31:47] without the message you wouldn't have
[2:31:48] anything to preach
[2:31:50] and he looked back at him and said
[2:31:52] apparently you didn't
[2:31:58] either I'm sorry I got nothing without
[2:32:01] the
[2:32:03] message I'm not going to India to
[2:32:05] straighten people out on their water
[2:32:06] baptism I'm going to India where if I
[2:32:09] can show them in the
[2:32:12] word that the word is
[2:32:16] infallible I I'll just read this quote
[2:32:21] brother Rena said uhow in the last age
[2:32:24] we have come back to the Capstone
[2:32:25] Revelation the most important revelation
[2:32:27] of the godhead in the whole Bible that
[2:32:28] is Jesus Is God he and the father are
[2:32:32] one there is one God and his name is the
[2:32:35] Lord Jesus Christ he is the god of the
[2:32:37] amen he never changes what he does never
[2:32:40] changes he says it and it stands fast he
[2:32:43] does it and it's done forever well I
[2:32:46] could run around the church right now
[2:32:49] what it's done is is done forever none
[2:32:50] can take from that what he says or add
[2:32:54] to it so let it be amen so let it be are
[2:32:57] you glad that you serve that kind of God
[2:33:00] you can know exactly where you are with
[2:33:03] him at any time and all the time he is
[2:33:06] the amen of God and won't
[2:33:10] change we can sing I speak the name of
[2:33:13] Jesus don't aren't you glad we serve
[2:33:15] that kind of
[2:33:17] God you want to know what we believe
[2:33:21] I believe the
[2:33:26] [Music]
[2:33:31] Bible because it was open to
[2:33:35] me why what do you mean brother Matthew
[2:33:39] well just as
[2:33:42] Joseph needed a visitation by the angel
[2:33:45] of the Lord to understand his life
[2:33:48] [Music]
[2:33:49] just as Mary needed a visitation by the
[2:33:53] angel of Lord to understand her
[2:33:57] predestination the bride is no
[2:34:01] different God knew you would be here but
[2:34:05] he had a
[2:34:07] pattern he said I must visit lady
[2:34:11] OA CU I'm going to bring forth my
[2:34:15] bride so what is it
[2:34:17] Church we've had a visitation
[2:34:20] God has come
[2:34:22] down in lady
[2:34:26] OA that you can birth forth the full
[2:34:30] word and the
[2:34:31] manifestation it's God's provided way
[2:34:33] what are you talking about brother
[2:34:34] Matthew if you want to go in a Rapture
[2:34:37] if you want to go in a body change if
[2:34:39] you want to escape the oncoming judgment
[2:34:43] look at the pattern it's that simple you
[2:34:45] start to walk people through the Bible
[2:34:48] you turn to Matthew 24
[2:34:50] you start to that's what we walk these
[2:34:51] ministers through showing them surely
[2:34:53] Elias must come but he's come
[2:34:57] already he said there won't be one pass
[2:34:59] away till every stone is knocked out it
[2:35:01] was already
[2:35:02] fulfilled and you can walk him through
[2:35:04] the the story of the end time
[2:35:07] showing where we're
[2:35:10] at but what does all the buildup do what
[2:35:13] what does all the climax do what does
[2:35:15] iron all the doctrine do
[2:35:21] if you don't show them
[2:35:24] plainly God's provided way in the end
[2:35:27] [Music]
[2:35:30] time I'll say
[2:35:32] it in
[2:35:34] [Music]
[2:35:38] closing brother Josh Bennett was
[2:35:40] preaching one time and somebody come up
[2:35:41] to say brother Josh He said you y y'all
[2:35:45] are always you know you're always saying
[2:35:47] brother Brandon brother Brandon brother
[2:35:49] brand
[2:35:51] why don't you just you know all that's
[2:35:53] good but why don't you leave brother
[2:35:54] brandom out of
[2:35:57] it he he said you know I listened to the
[2:35:59] guy
[2:36:01] and was thinking about what he
[2:36:04] said he said then it struck him he said
[2:36:06] you know
[2:36:08] what tell me
[2:36:11] this if you can tell the
[2:36:15] story about the
[2:36:17] ark and leave no out of
[2:36:21] it he said if you can tell the story
[2:36:24] about the children of Israel going in
[2:36:26] Exodus and leaving Moses out of
[2:36:29] it if you can tell the story about the
[2:36:31] first coming to the Lord and leave John
[2:36:34] the Baptist out of
[2:36:35] it said but if you're going to tell the
[2:36:38] story about the change of my body if
[2:36:40] you're going to tell the story about me
[2:36:42] going in a Rapture if you're going to
[2:36:44] tell me about the story of the greatest
[2:36:46] climatic in in history for human kind if
[2:36:50] you're going to put Noah in the story if
[2:36:52] you're going to put Moses in the story
[2:36:54] if you're going to put John the Baptist
[2:36:55] in the story then go ahead and put
[2:36:57] William brandom in the story that you
[2:37:00] ain't going in a Rapture you ain't going
[2:37:02] in a body change without
[2:37:05] it that's my message to India that's my
[2:37:08] message to the whole world because it
[2:37:10] ain't my message it was given to me by

[2:41:07] every
[2:41:14] sh
[2:41:16] hallelujah amen do you enjoy that
[2:41:20] tonight amen you know the prophet of God
[2:41:22] said there'd be another book of Acts
[2:41:24] right written after this
[2:41:29] word what did he return us to he
[2:41:32] returned us back to the word of God that
[2:41:36] we could believe every line every statue
[2:41:40] every part of it we he said take it just
[2:41:44] the way it is he didn't need explaining
[2:41:47] it needed believing
[2:41:51] he wrote it and he spoke it just the way
[2:41:53] he wanted to write it and just the way
[2:41:56] he wanted to speak it and if he said it
[2:41:59] it's life it's truth and it'll carry out
[2:42:03] in
[2:42:04] do what he said it would
[2:42:07] do and it's that
[2:42:10] simple and and if if there's everything
[2:42:13] that you noticed about our messenger he
[2:42:15] took the word of God if I could use that
[2:42:18] expression at face
[2:42:21] value this is what he said and and you I
[2:42:27] can't add anything to that that's just
[2:42:29] exactly where my heart's desire is just
[2:42:32] like this morning he saw everything is
[2:42:35] laying right there in the word of
[2:42:38] God but it was sealed up and all of a
[2:42:42] sudden it's been opened up to us the
[2:42:45] River of Life the tree of life that you
[2:42:49] you can go to that and pick any promise
[2:42:52] of that book every promise and take it
[2:42:55] for yourself and say This Promise is
[2:42:57] mine I can make this promise live
[2:43:01] because God stands in his word so God
[2:43:05] bless you I I I just thought that was
[2:43:08] wonderful and and in the part of
[2:43:11] Matthew's trip I don't want you to miss
[2:43:14] is he wasn't preaching the message
[2:43:17] people you understand wasn't like people
[2:43:20] call missionary trips I'm going to go
[2:43:22] here preach at this brother's church and
[2:43:24] this brother's church and this brother's
[2:43:26] church and and go there no this was
[2:43:29] going to where no man has gone before if
[2:43:32] I could say it that
[2:43:34] way I like it and what did the gospel do
[2:43:38] it had an
[2:43:41] effect they saw
[2:43:43] it and they said
[2:43:46] amen and I like that scripture said like
[2:43:49] the Thessalonians these were more
[2:43:51] diligent than most they sought out and
[2:43:54] searched the scripture to find out if
[2:43:57] these things are true and if they search
[2:44:00] the scriptures you know what you're
[2:44:01] going to find you're going to find
[2:44:03] Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7
[2:44:08] has been manifested in the flesh in our
[2:44:12] day and it's true and Paul spoke it this
[2:44:15] way I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of
[2:44:18] Jesus Christ
[2:44:19] for it is the power of God unto
[2:44:22] salvation and God's given all of us
[2:44:25] something great to believe don't be
[2:44:27] ashamed of it we're not intellect we
[2:44:30] don't show Paul said I didn't come to
[2:44:32] you with enticing words of the wisdom of
[2:44:35] men but I came to you with the power and
[2:44:38] demonstration of the Holy Spirit let's
[2:44:40] keep the gospel the gospel let's accept
[2:44:44] who we are let's let our light shine
[2:44:46] sisters you be proud of your long hair
[2:44:49] you be proud of your addresses you be
[2:44:51] proud of your Holiness men be let your
[2:44:55] conversation be righteous let your
[2:44:57] actions be pure and so let your light
[2:45:00] shine amongst men that your good works
[2:45:04] might glorify your father which is in
[2:45:06] heaven that men might inquire of you
[2:45:09] what is the hope that you
[2:45:12] have what is the reason for your peace
[2:45:15] and you can give them an answer because
[2:45:19] you've meant something that's changed
[2:45:22] you God bless you I just just hardly
[2:45:25] anything to add I'm not much of a singer
[2:45:27] we'll say a prayer Billy can come and
[2:45:30] close with some songs of worship our
[2:45:32] gracious father we thank you for the
[2:45:34] wonderful insight into the work that you
[2:45:37] did and father the sacrifice that it
[2:45:41] took to go and and father there in that
[2:45:46] country of a billion people
[2:45:50] people probably not much bigger than
[2:45:54] the like the country it's it's just so
[2:45:58] crowded and but that means there's so
[2:46:01] many Souls there and you're not a
[2:46:02] respector of
[2:46:04] persons all men were created by your
[2:46:07] word and your
[2:46:08] will father and may these Souls that
[2:46:11] were baptized may they increase in the
[2:46:13] wisdom and knowledge father may you give
[2:46:17] them Revelation May they seek the
[2:46:19] scripture May their hearts hunger and
[2:46:21] thirst after righteousness father and
[2:46:24] may they come to the revelation of this
[2:46:27] hour that your word is
[2:46:29] true that they might see and you give
[2:46:31] them eyes have that they could see the
[2:46:34] Fulfillment of the promise of our age
[2:46:37] doing just exactly what you
[2:46:39] said you had promis to do how many times
[2:46:43] I heard the messenger of this age stand
[2:46:46] in the pulpit and said God is doing
[2:46:48] doing exactly what he promised to do in
[2:46:52] this age and made it visible before us
[2:46:57] father I pray that you open their eyes
[2:47:00] that it's become so visible and real to
[2:47:03] them that they can share it with
[2:47:06] conviction they can share it with no
[2:47:08] alternative motive and objective father
[2:47:11] it was freely given to them Father may
[2:47:14] they freely give in the mighty name of
[2:47:17] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen God
