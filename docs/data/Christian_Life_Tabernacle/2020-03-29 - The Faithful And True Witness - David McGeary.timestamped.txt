[15:44] had to get it for our gracious Heavenly
[15:47] Father Lord were assembled not only here
[15:53] but in our homes maybe other places
[15:59] streaming by phone the Lord we're so
[16:04] happy you're the creator of heaven and
[16:06] earth and that you dwell all in all
[16:08] you're with your people we just asked
[16:12] father that you would bless us this
[16:14] morning and our endeavor to serve you
[16:18] and to fellowship with the people this
[16:23] morning we ask you to bless us today in
[16:26] this wonderful day that you have given
[16:29] us we ask for your help in your presence
[16:32] this morning in the name of the Lord
[16:35] Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen
[16:39] god bless you this morning I'd like to
[16:43] read a little statement found in the
[16:49] message called the way of a true prophet
[16:51] before we read our our scriptures and so
[16:56] thank you musicians this morning and and
[17:01] you may be seated if you liked it for a
[17:03] little bit this morning and we can stand
[17:06] you know it's I guess we as we speak
[17:12] last week you know it's it certainly a
[17:15] challenging time and obviously a time
[17:19] that things are different than they were
[17:21] just a few weeks ago or even a month or
[17:25] so ago
[17:26] and there's been a great change on us
[17:29] and I thought of this little statement
[17:31] that I was as I was reading in this
[17:35] message called the way of a true prophet
[17:38] and he says this great man Jeroboam
[17:43] which was a great mental power and he
[17:48] had the nation in prosperity yet in the
[17:52] sin
[17:53] I wonder if we could take couldn't just
[17:58] kind of type that a little bit tonight
[18:02] to our own country and our own nation in
[18:06] sin the way it is yet prosperity we're
[18:13] going to get a tax cut right away I
[18:15] heard of course anybody can read between
[18:20] the lines there election coming up but
[18:24] so forth and all these things that's
[18:27] going on Israel preachers priests and
[18:33] government had left the Word of God
[18:37] behind and a compromise and that's the
[18:42] way the country was in that condition
[18:45] that it was though they had just as many
[18:50] priests let's read that that's why that
[18:54] country was in the condition that they
[18:57] were in because they had left the Word
[18:59] of God they had left the word of promise
[19:03] in and he said he said though they had
[19:09] just as many priests and just as many
[19:13] preachers as they ever had but they had
[19:17] left off the Word of God got away from
[19:21] it and it's always at that time that God
[19:25] sends somebody from somewhere to blast
[19:29] it back into the path again some
[19:33] fearless person that will rise up with
[19:35] the word of the Lord and shake the
[19:37] people back to the Word of God again and
[19:43] we know that's what God's always trying
[19:45] to do but I thought that was amazing
[19:47] that it's always they had as many
[19:49] preachers as they did they had as many
[19:51] things they had a great intellectual
[19:54] power for a leader all those things were
[19:57] in place but yet the country was in the
[19:59] condition they were in because of sin
[20:03] and it just goes to show that no matter
[20:06] what effort man
[20:07] puts forth no matter all the things that
[20:10] he thinks that can make it there's only
[20:12] one thing that keeps God and God's
[20:15] people and that's his word and so we
[20:20] just want to talk about the ways that
[20:22] God tries to blast us back to the Word
[20:27] of God I really don't you think that
[20:29] this should have been a blast to people
[20:32] to get them back to the Word of God just
[20:34] think of it here's the very thing that
[20:36] strikes everybody that ought to make
[20:38] them come back to God how to fill up the
[20:42] church houses how to put people into the
[20:44] house and prayer and they close them if
[20:49] you know what I mean so Dennis it's
[20:52] going to show one thing for sure that a
[20:55] person is going to have to go beyond the
[20:57] group they're going to have to go beyond
[21:00] the church they're going to be have to
[21:01] be anchored in their heart and in the
[21:04] individual with God's Word it's got to
[21:07] just be that way and so we're going to
[21:11] read a couple of scriptures this morning
[21:13] I want to read the main scripture we're
[21:16] going to read and then we'll read
[21:18] several other scriptures once again like
[21:22] to greet everybody that's streaming we
[21:25] we're trying to interpret this morning
[21:28] into Spanish I hope that that's going
[21:31] well so much technology that is
[21:36] available to us if we can just get it
[21:39] all in place to do the right thing so
[21:41] we're really so let's stand this morning
[21:43] and I want to read a scripture and then
[21:46] just fellowship with you a little bit
[21:49] we're going to have some baptisms right
[21:52] after service and so you can stay
[21:57] streaming for the baptisms if you like
[21:59] and but let's turn in our our scripture
[22:06] reading to the revelations the third
[22:09] chapter
[22:11] and the 14th verse and all of us I know
[22:17] for sure I know what revelations 3 and
[22:21] 14 is but I'd like to start with the
[22:24] 13th verse and tie this together
[22:26] normally we stop and restart but I'd
[22:29] like to read these two together it says
[22:32] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[22:36] the spirit saith unto the churches and
[22:40] to the Angel of the Church of Lady osya
[22:45] write these things saith the Amen the
[22:51] faithful and true witness the beginning
[22:55] of the creation of God father we ask you
[23:00] to ask your blessings on the word in
[23:03] your precious name we pray amen may be
[23:06] seated
[23:06] we certainly understand this morning
[23:12] that we are definitely in the age of
[23:15] Lady ousia all the conditions around us
[23:19] have always pointed towards that we
[23:22] understood it very plainly that this has
[23:27] become an age that is blind miserable
[23:29] poor wretched and hated and doesn't know
[23:33] it you know you this look how that we
[23:37] thought that we were so prepared for
[23:39] everything and and we didn't have need
[23:42] of nothing then this little teeny
[23:44] microbe comes floating in the sky
[23:47] something that nobody can see nobody
[23:50] knows how to handle that everybody
[23:53] becomes totally locked down in fear and
[23:57] then we find out that we didn't think we
[24:01] had need of anything and now we find
[24:04] that we're in need of toilet paper we're
[24:07] in need of paper towels we're in need of
[24:10] masks we're in need of wipes to wipe our
[24:16] hands and hand sanitizer I mean you talk
[24:20] about a rebuke you talk about a just
[24:25] something that
[24:25] since they're in testifies right into
[24:29] the the face of of man in fact it
[24:32] becomes a witness that that's what it
[24:35] does it could just it's a God's always
[24:38] witnessing his word that's what he does
[24:41] and and so he witnessed that that we
[24:44] were in this age because of where where
[24:48] the situation is and then we get another
[24:51] witness that says what we weren't
[24:53] prepared here comes something we're not
[24:55] prepared worldwide pandemic you know it
[24:59] shows that no matter what missiles you
[25:01] have you know why didn't they just take
[25:04] one of those missiles and blast it up in
[25:07] the air and kill this number 19 you know
[25:11] what I mean because we don't fight
[25:14] principalities and powers we don't find
[25:16] things that we can touch his hands
[25:18] there's more behind it you know there
[25:21] ought to be more in our discernment
[25:23] there ought to be more in our
[25:25] understanding there ought to be more
[25:27] that what we're looking at you know so a
[25:30] kind of one of the questions that I have
[25:33] is what are we witnessing what are we
[25:37] witnessing what it is that we're
[25:39] standing back and witnessing really what
[25:42] is the thing we talked last week that we
[25:45] we saw there was a contrast and God uses
[25:48] contrast he uses contrast to show the
[25:52] good he uses the contrast to really show
[25:55] us here's empower nations a billion
[25:58] dollars in the defense that can here
[26:01] we're fighting something that's
[26:03] defenseless look at what our final
[26:07] defense is don't get around nobody sit
[26:11] car we six feet brothers you know don't
[26:14] shake nobody's hand don't go out to eat
[26:17] in restaurants don't you know no social
[26:20] gather social distancing and everything
[26:23] this is what the greatest country in the
[26:26] world this is what this great world
[26:29] civilization that we have is down to
[26:33] defenseless
[26:37] you don't even know what they're
[26:43] fighting and now they're looking for
[26:47] such small things to help them in their
[26:52] survival we got some guy up there in the
[26:57] spaceship I'm sure somewhere floating
[27:00] around the earth you know he probably
[27:04] don't want to come home you know so you
[27:08] just clean when you start to look at the
[27:11] picture can see I believe every believer
[27:15] is called in this lady OC Dan age I
[27:19] counsel thee to buy of me eyesalve that
[27:22] thou may a city amen so I believe their
[27:26] God there's something that God wants us
[27:28] to see he wants us something that he
[27:31] wants us to be witnessing he wants us to
[27:34] spread for us to find something that
[27:36] were aware of that there's got to be
[27:40] some significant to all these he danced
[27:44] it surely points out the weakness of man
[27:47] and so that's what brought me through
[27:50] this great scripture here that says into
[27:56] the angel of the church of Lady ousia
[27:59] write these things saith the a man
[28:03] another word of a man means so be it
[28:07] the one that says the Amen you ever hear
[28:10] the expression that's the a man of the
[28:12] matter that's the one who puts the
[28:14] period on it
[28:16] that's the one who says this is the way
[28:18] it is that's the one when he says Amen
[28:21] there's nothing to be added you can't
[28:24] take it away this is how it is it's the
[28:27] amen amen who's saying this today if
[28:31] they say that the amen so that's it and
[28:36] what is he he's the faithful
[28:41] and true witness the faithful and the
[28:47] true witness now how could he be a
[28:49] faithful and true witness because this
[28:53] is his identification if I could see his
[28:58] expertise you know when you have a
[29:00] witness you call me an expert witness so
[29:03] what is this witnesses this faithful and
[29:06] true witness what is his expertise what
[29:10] gives him the right to be the witness
[29:14] that saith the witness what gives him
[29:18] the right to say that you're blind
[29:20] miserable poor wretched and naked and
[29:23] say you have needed nothing what gives
[29:25] him the right to say I counsel thee to
[29:28] buy of me gold and try to have what
[29:31] right what gives him the right what
[29:33] makes him the witness that can testify
[29:37] to this age and and it says you know
[29:42] what get what is this great thing
[29:44] because he's the beginning of the
[29:46] creation of God before Abraham was I am
[29:55] on the beginning of the creation of God
[30:00] I'm the one who started it I'm the one
[30:02] who spoke it I'm the one that's speaking
[30:07] the faithful and the true witness is the
[30:14] one that speaking so we just want to
[30:16] talk about that faithful and true
[30:19] witness because that's what he is he's a
[30:23] faithful and true witness so let's take
[30:26] our Bibles can read of the promise of
[30:31] this faithful and true witness because
[30:34] if there's ever an age that needs this
[30:39] faithful and true witness it's this time
[30:42] I mean this it just shows us how how
[30:47] feeble
[30:49] man really is and if and I know there's
[30:53] a lot of different people have got
[30:58] different theories on where this came
[31:01] from I had someone that was a doctor
[31:05] that was very connected told me that it
[31:08] was a man-made chemical virus many
[31:12] people believe that but it doesn't
[31:14] matter there's even statements that our
[31:16] prophet has made that would cause us to
[31:19] believe that could be very much true but
[31:23] it still shows us the weakness that man
[31:27] has and it also shows a God that a perv
[31:32] I'd said he's still Jehovah Jireh he's
[31:36] still one that provides so and as we
[31:39] look I just wanted to see that that this
[31:42] faithful and true witness he was
[31:45] promised us it was promised to us and
[31:50] I'm not just speaking today I'm going
[31:53] I'm speaking beyond the promise of
[31:55] Malachi 4:5 beyond the promise of Luke
[31:59] 17 30 beyond the promise of of the
[32:04] scriptures but I want to see that that
[32:06] are we know our messenger was promised
[32:10] we know that the angel was promised but
[32:13] if I did say this this morning that
[32:15] there was something that came along with
[32:18] that promise for every believer and so
[32:22] let us just turn in our Bibles to st.
[32:25] John the fourteenth chapter in the
[32:28] Gospel of st. John and the 14th chapter
[32:36] and I think this is something that we
[32:40] should realize the very importance of
[32:47] this witness this faithful and true
[32:54] witness something that that God has
[32:58] offered us something that God has per by
[33:02] for us he said I'm going to provide for
[33:05] you a faithful and true witness and as
[33:10] we read what this faithful and true
[33:13] witness will do what does faithful and
[33:16] true witness is for how that in the
[33:19] condition that we're in right now how
[33:23] how that we need this faithful and true
[33:27] witness so we read here he says let's
[33:30] start in st. John the 14th 14th chapter
[33:36] in the 12th verse or 11th verse
[33:39] believe me that I am in the father and
[33:43] the father in me or else believe me for
[33:49] the very works sake so he said you know
[33:54] believe me by revelation but if you
[33:57] can't believe me by revelation you
[33:59] should believe me by your very eyes and
[34:02] then he says verily verily I sand you he
[34:07] that believeth on me the works that I do
[34:12] shall he do also and greater works than
[34:17] these shall he do because I go unto my
[34:23] father and what soever ye shall ask in
[34:29] my name that will I do that the father
[34:34] may be glorified in the son now these
[34:39] are beautiful words to us we're talking
[34:43] about these are words of promise these
[34:46] are words of life these are words that
[34:49] he's given to us in times like these I
[34:53] believe there's that song it was done in
[34:56] times like these we need a Savior in
[35:00] times like these we need our Lord amen
[35:05] it says it if you shall ask anything in
[35:09] my name I will do it if you love me keep
[35:12] my Commandments and I will pray the
[35:15] Father
[35:16] and he shall give you another comforter
[35:20] that he may abide with you for ever I
[35:28] like this this is not a temporary
[35:30] promise this isn't a one thing this is
[35:34] until you run out
[35:36] go keep promising the church something
[35:40] that will be with him forever amen and
[35:44] that is such a beautiful thing so we can
[35:48] take this promise and we can realize
[35:52] that this promise is good for this time
[35:56] this promise is good for this time and
[36:00] we don't have to go find a new promise
[36:03] because the world found a new book
[36:06] they've been finding bugs all down
[36:09] through the time as brother Micah
[36:12] Park shared with us that fabulous a
[36:15] statement from Martin Luther King in the
[36:18] time of a plague that nearly wiped out
[36:20] the world but let me tell you some this
[36:22] world is not going to be wiped out till
[36:25] this bride is taken out so we can sure
[36:33] and so as we read this he says if you
[36:39] love me keep my Commandments
[36:40] I pray the father and he shall give you
[36:43] another comforter that he may abide with
[36:46] you forever even the Spirit of Truth so
[36:53] what is he he's a faithful and true
[36:58] witness even the Spirit of Truth whom
[37:04] the world cannot receive can you imagine
[37:09] the world has what they need but they
[37:15] can't receive it they can't receive it
[37:20] but they can't receive it because it
[37:24] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[37:30] you know him for he dwelleth with you
[37:33] and shall be in you oh I want just that
[37:38] let that stay with you as we read this
[37:40] and we talked about this this morning
[37:42] you have it he dwelleth in you if you're
[37:46] a believer if you don't have it the very
[37:49] promise to you is that it is that and he
[37:54] shall be in you so he's with you and he
[37:58] shall be in you he said I will not leave
[38:01] you nor forsake you I'll be with you
[38:03] even in you tell the end so we have what
[38:09] we need and if he says and I will not
[38:16] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[38:20] [Music]
[38:23] that's that's eternal word see he's not
[38:27] gonna leave us comfortless in this I
[38:30] know some of you are facing jobs i
[38:32] fellowship with brother last night
[38:34] wonderful time of dinner together and
[38:37] and he said I haven't worked in two
[38:39] weeks I said why didn't you call me
[38:45] knowing anybody said it all aren't
[38:48] plenty of work to do we can mow the yard
[38:51] around here we can stack lumber we can
[38:54] build little things we can do someone
[38:56] don't don't do nothing and he said but
[39:00] you know I was just in the store and I
[39:03] saw a lady in the store and I felt the
[39:06] Holy Spirit move on me and I said ok and
[39:11] he said so I went over and I began to
[39:12] talk with her and we got to talking and
[39:16] she asked me do you need a job he said
[39:18] yeah and he says well he said I'll call
[39:22] my boss and she called the boss and
[39:24] immediately while he was still in the
[39:26] store the boss called him back and got
[39:29] on the phone and they got the interview
[39:31] got everything and he starts this little
[39:34] job Monday I will not leave you
[39:36] comfortless I I will not lead you
[39:39] comfortless comfortless he said I will
[39:43] come to you now that's a promise every
[39:47] time that you're in a situation every
[39:50] time that you're in a problem he said to
[39:53] you if you believe on me and believe in
[39:57] the father and the father dwells within
[40:00] you then know this be a believer be a
[40:03] believer you've got to be a believer our
[40:07] victory is in vain faith is where our
[40:11] power is faith in the word faith in
[40:14] knowing that God keeps his word he says
[40:16] I will not leave you comfortless
[40:18] I will come to you it'd be good to
[40:23] recognize him how he shows up how that
[40:29] ease therapy says I will come to you yet
[40:35] a little while and the world seeth me no
[40:40] more but ye shall see me because I live
[40:46] oh you know we we have so many times we
[40:52] take the scriptures and we look at when
[40:55] they were spoken in history but do be
[40:58] under we remember what his witness is
[41:01] his witness is the beginning of the
[41:05] creation of God
[41:06] that's his witness so these words were
[41:10] not words that were spoken in in 33 AD
[41:15] these were words that were spoken before
[41:19] the foundation of the world they were in
[41:22] the creation of what God created when he
[41:27] had you in his mind these promises were
[41:31] in you to be manifested by you for God
[41:37] was going to use you to manifest these
[41:40] promises and prove his word
[41:43] and so he goes to say here he says
[41:47] because I live I can make this promise
[41:53] because I live I can come unto you
[41:57] because I live I can give you comfort
[42:00] because I live and you shall also live
[42:06] also because I live you shall live also
[42:12] because I'm real
[42:14] you shall have comfort because I'm I'm
[42:17] risen you shall not be comfort less even
[42:23] you can ask what you will and you can
[42:27] have it at that day ye shall know that I
[42:32] am in my father and ye and me and I in
[42:36] you so what a beautiful promise we have
[42:43] and the promise is I will send you a
[42:47] comforter even the Spirit of Truth the
[42:52] faithful and true witness let's just
[42:55] turn to another a beautiful scripture
[42:57] and this read in st. John just the next
[43:00] page over as Jesus is lame this great
[43:03] foundation down to his disciples about
[43:06] the comforter about what he is going to
[43:11] give the church he paid the price he's
[43:18] gone to prepare a place for him but he's
[43:21] going to leave something with the church
[43:24] he said I am NOT gonna leave you
[43:26] comfortless but I'll come again unto you
[43:31] so let us read again found in st. John
[43:35] 15 and 20 remember the word that I said
[43:41] unto you the servant is not greater than
[43:45] his Lord if you have if they have
[43:50] persecuted me
[43:52] they will also persecute you if you have
[43:56] kept my sayings they will keep yours
[44:01] also when that beautiful talk about the
[44:06] union of his word that if a person's
[44:10] keeping God's word then they'll keep the
[44:13] words of God also in other words the
[44:16] word that's preached the people will
[44:18] keep that also because there's unity
[44:21] because there's one baptism one spirit
[44:24] one word amen and he said but all these
[44:30] things they will do unto you for my
[44:33] namesake because they know not him that
[44:37] sent me if I had not come and spoke unto
[44:43] them they had they had not had sin but
[44:49] they have no cloak for their sin and I
[44:56] let's listen to that that's a beautiful
[44:58] thing
[44:58] if I had not come and spoke unto them
[45:03] they had not had sin but now they have
[45:08] no cloak for their sin if he wouldn't
[45:11] have preached to this country if he
[45:13] wouldn't have given this country the
[45:16] Word of God
[45:16] if he wouldn't have performed signs and
[45:19] wonders and and made the call for them
[45:22] to come back to the gospel he came to
[45:25] this generation and he tried to blast
[45:28] them back so now they have no cloak for
[45:31] their sin you know and I know what it's
[45:35] like I like to see music and it's a
[45:39] beautiful thing and I like to hear
[45:41] worship and I listen to the song and
[45:44] then when you go look at the the people
[45:47] the this the words of the song are
[45:50] wonderful but the people are not lined
[45:53] up to the Word of God yeah and remember
[45:56] we're talking about a faithful and true
[45:59] witness
[46:00] [Music]
[46:02] the words aren't hurt witness beautiful
[46:07] words great singers I remember someone
[46:10] played me a song one time I said
[46:11] whatever you do if you like that song
[46:15] do not go listen or look at the guy who
[46:20] wrote it and sings it well what do you
[46:25] think the first thing they did couldn't
[46:28] take a curiosity yes ate them up so they
[46:31] go there and they get this guy he's got
[46:33] great big old long hair and the ear ring
[46:35] you know what I mean and you know tattoo
[46:37] and everything on them that you know
[46:40] subji zhis and and he's that one of
[46:44] those modern hippy contemporary
[46:50] Christians you know who who just feel
[46:53] that that they've come along and that
[46:56] Christ has come to them in their
[46:59] condition let me tell you something the
[47:01] Lord Jesus comes to people in their
[47:03] condition but he doesn't leave them
[47:06] there amen the gospel is a gospel of
[47:12] transformation it's a gospel that
[47:15] conforms you into the image of Christ
[47:18] and and so we just read this and it
[47:21] becomes beautiful as we begin there but
[47:24] they're without excuse and that's what
[47:28] brought this world in the condition that
[47:30] it's in because of compromise that's the
[47:34] best easiest part for man always wants
[47:38] to take the good things and leave out
[47:41] the rest that's why John said you can't
[47:44] take from or add to the Word of God your
[47:48] name will be taken out of the book of
[47:51] life and the plagues of this book would
[47:54] be visited upon you and so you see that
[47:58] that
[48:00] our nature is that we want to make
[48:03] excuse or we want to provide another way
[48:09] we want to provide we want to do as the
[48:13] love in our heart we want to give every
[48:16] man the benefit of the doubt we want
[48:17] every man to make it into the kingdom we
[48:21] want to start to say well that's not
[48:23] important their hearts right with God
[48:26] they really love the Word of God but
[48:29] remember Jesus will not judge them that
[48:32] heart will not judge them he said I will
[48:35] not judge you but my word will judge you
[48:39] he died for you that's how much love he
[48:43] had that's how much forgiveness he had
[48:45] he laid down his life for that sinner
[48:48] but now that he has preached the word to
[48:51] him they have no cloak for their
[48:54] unbelief
[49:03] he that hateth me hateth my father also
[49:06] if I had not done among them the works
[49:12] which none other man did they would had
[49:18] not had sin if I had not done among them
[49:25] the works which none other man did they
[49:31] had not had sin but now have they both
[49:37] seen and hated both me and my father
[49:47] but this cometh to pass that the word
[49:51] might be fulfilled which is written in
[49:54] their law they hate me without a cause
[49:58] but when the comforter is come whom I
[50:04] will send unto you from the father even
[50:10] the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth
[50:14] from the father he shall testify of me
[50:21] and he also shall bear witness because
[50:27] ye have been with me from the beginning
[50:31] so what is this is the spirit and he is
[50:35] going to proceed from the father and he
[50:38] shall testify he's gonna be a faithful
[50:41] and true witness let's just turn to st.
[50:45] John the 16th and the 12th orders as
[50:48] Jesus pens these three and four chapters
[50:52] just speaking about what is coming to
[50:55] take the church what is coming to take
[50:59] the leadership of the church what it is
[51:02] that he's providing for the church to be
[51:05] their comfort what it is that he's
[51:07] giving to the church he's not gonna
[51:09] leave this her church comfortless
[51:12] he is going to come in he's going to
[51:15] lead them and guide them into all truth
[51:18] and righteousness so he is not going to
[51:24] leave us without a witness st. John 16
[51:29] and 12 I have many things to say unto
[51:34] you but you cannot bear them now howbeit
[51:39] when he the spirit of truth is come he
[51:44] will guide you into all truth for he
[51:52] shall not speak of himself but
[51:55] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[51:59] speak and he will show you things to
[52:04] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[52:09] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[52:14] you all things that the father hath are
[52:18] mine therefore say I that he shall take
[52:23] of mine and shall show it unto you a
[52:27] little while and ye shall not see me and
[52:31] again a little while and these shall see
[52:35] me because I go to the Father
[52:41] III think that we can certainly see the
[52:47] Wonder and the beauty of what it means
[52:52] to have the Spirit of Truth to have a
[52:56] faithful and true witness somebody
[53:01] that's not going to testify but is going
[53:04] to testify of the things that he is
[53:07] spoke of his word so just as I finish up
[53:11] here
[53:11] I want us to understand from the
[53:15] standpoint that we are in a very strange
[53:19] time things are changing let me tell you
[53:22] remember when that one guy I
[53:25] guess they tried to get a bomb or
[53:28] something in a shoe or someone hijacked
[53:32] the plane remember that just tried to
[53:37] hijack a plane you realize that that
[53:39] event changed the way that man travelled
[53:43] forever
[53:46] everybody had to take their belts off
[53:48] everybody had to take their coats off
[53:51] everybody had to take these earth
[53:53] travelers had to take their shoes off
[53:55] you had to wait and get one down and go
[53:58] through machines and and then the
[54:00] machines were invading people's privacy
[54:02] so they had to redo the machines and
[54:05] people were complaining because they had
[54:08] to get to the airport two and a half
[54:10] hours early to get on the plane
[54:12] it was absolutely a total wreck because
[54:15] of one event so remember don't forget
[54:18] this event is going to change this world
[54:25] good old Vegas everything's coming back
[54:28] to normal there has been something that
[54:31] has changed but there's one thing that
[54:34] hasn't changed any man there's one thing
[54:40] that hasn't changed is the comforter the
[54:43] faithful and true witness that God has
[54:46] given us so that that's what that what
[54:53] we can we can rest in so I just like to
[54:58] read this he says and one of the great
[55:03] problems for God down through the years
[55:06] as a history of the church goes is to
[55:11] find somebody that he can completely get
[55:16] in his control
[55:20] he only needs one man he always uses one
[55:25] man at a time we studied that a few
[55:28] nights one man not a group he just wants
[55:32] one that that's all he needs because two
[55:36] men would have two different ideas he
[55:40] just takes one man represents himself
[55:44] through that one person never did he do
[55:47] it otherwise than that see now he's got
[55:52] one person today and I know a lot of us
[55:58] automatically are thinking about brother
[56:02] branham as the man okay but it wasn't
[56:08] brother branham the man that brought
[56:11] this message it was a yielded vessel to
[56:15] the Holy Spirit that brought the message
[56:19] the message was the Word of God the
[56:23] message wasn't the messenger the
[56:26] messenger was the source and the voice
[56:30] that the message was delivered so you
[56:34] can't separate the messenger from the
[56:37] message because that's the source of the
[56:40] message it would be like taking zipping
[56:43] my mouth shut and clipping my tongue and
[56:46] then wanting me to speak I know I could
[56:50] learn maybe sign language for those that
[56:52] don't speak or or don't hear but you
[56:55] understand what the point here is the
[56:58] point is understanding who is the Spirit
[57:03] of Truth and he's got that one person
[57:09] today and that person is the one we just
[57:14] read after the Holy Spirit
[57:20] he is the person that God has sent forth
[57:26] the spirit of Jesus Christ into the
[57:30] earth the Spirit of God to manifest and
[57:34] declare Christ through his church see
[57:37] just to continue the life of Christ
[57:41] through the church even so jesus
[57:45] promised this he said I'm gonna send you
[57:49] a comforter I'm gonna send you the
[57:51] spirit of the truth I will not leave you
[57:53] I will come again I will be with you
[57:56] even in you so this person that's going
[58:01] to lead us and guide us this faithful
[58:04] and true witness has been promised to us
[58:10] and it's our comfort that way it's so
[58:14] important that we understand that we
[58:17] know of his existence
[58:21] we have an understanding of that he was
[58:25] a gift of God that God promised his
[58:28] spirit to us that in times like these we
[58:33] need this spirit we need this leadership
[58:37] we need this comforter we need this
[58:41] person in our lives connected with our
[58:45] lives and we should do all that we can
[58:49] to cultivate that relationship to make
[58:55] ways for it to move in our life to set
[58:58] aside time in our life to make contact
[59:01] with it sin alone be still and know that
[59:06] I'm God just don't always do the talking
[59:10] sit back and do some listening he's
[59:12] provided something to us that we need to
[59:16] make contact with
[59:21] without the spirit the letter killeth
[59:26] many people have quotes and they use
[59:30] quotes and they're out of context
[59:33] they're out of spirit they're out of
[59:36] place they're not even spoken in the way
[59:39] that they're spoken and then they try to
[59:41] use brother branham's ministry to
[59:45] vindicate their using of the quotes and
[59:48] the only thing that bears witness is the
[59:51] spirit so if you don't have the spirit
[59:58] then you're gonna have trouble with the
[1:00:01] record that we just read in Finnish here
[1:00:05] oh it's such a marvelous thing and yet
[1:00:11] it's so simple if we would just stop and
[1:00:15] think we press we quiver we fear we get
[1:00:22] in frustration and doubts just thinking
[1:00:26] well must I press in it isn't that it's
[1:00:32] just yielding see realizing that you're
[1:00:38] nothing and just let him completely take
[1:00:44] you over take over your thinking take
[1:00:48] over so that he's provided something
[1:00:55] he's provided the spirit of comfort he's
[1:00:59] provided the spirit of truth he's
[1:01:01] provided this faithful and true witness
[1:01:04] but what good is it to us if we don't
[1:01:07] yield to it if we don't realize it's
[1:01:11] there if we don't understand this is
[1:01:13] what I've got to make contact with
[1:01:17] I'll tell you and I hope I don't sound
[1:01:21] rude and in anything look I think it'd
[1:01:24] behoove us many times before we start
[1:01:27] reading our Bible just to spend a few
[1:01:30] moments to get into the spirit before we
[1:01:35] take up a message to spend a few moments
[1:01:37] to get into the spirit because that
[1:01:41] spirit is what's going to lead you and
[1:01:44] guide you into all truth
[1:01:46] that's the spirit that's going to show
[1:01:48] you I have many things that you cannot
[1:01:51] bear but I'm going to send you the
[1:01:53] spirit I'm going to send you the
[1:01:55] comforter and he will show you these
[1:01:57] things he will reveal these things to
[1:02:00] you it's so important as we're going
[1:02:02] forward from this hour in these times to
[1:02:06] make sure that we get our lives in the
[1:02:10] spirit it's important to be in the
[1:02:14] spirit he said now I don't mean to walk
[1:02:23] up to Christ with just a blank mind I
[1:02:26] don't mean that you come to him in your
[1:02:31] right mind in a penitent mind and humble
[1:02:39] and say Lord Jesus Here I am Lord Jesus
[1:02:50] here Emma now it's written here in your
[1:02:54] Bible that you had many things yet to
[1:02:58] say to the disciples you said they could
[1:03:02] not bear them now and he says then
[1:03:06] perhaps that's our case we cannot not
[1:03:09] understand them
[1:03:12] you'll just think for a moment God can
[1:03:20] raise up a little something different
[1:03:21] altogether we denounce it instead of
[1:03:26] searching the Scriptures to see if it's
[1:03:29] right or not we just quickly throw it
[1:03:32] away there's nothing to it now let's
[1:03:37] don't take that attitude to what's going
[1:03:39] on this is going to change I think we
[1:03:43] need to search the Scriptures and see
[1:03:45] what is in it
[1:03:47] what is it witnessing what is it
[1:03:51] testifying to and what is the Spirit of
[1:03:55] the Lord saying about it see what's
[1:03:58] gonna happen we know it's going to
[1:04:01] change things man's gonna make
[1:04:04] adjustments you know and then you're
[1:04:06] probably gonna see you know someone's
[1:04:09] standing at doors wiping knobs and and
[1:04:13] all kinds of stuff is going to change
[1:04:15] there's going to be all kinds of help
[1:04:17] things change food things and
[1:04:19] restaurants I don't know all the changes
[1:04:22] that are gonna be made but there's going
[1:04:24] to be changes well there's going to be
[1:04:27] changes in the attitudes of men to ya
[1:04:31] know I can tell you personally every
[1:04:35] time I see something like this come
[1:04:37] they've we've already got to the place
[1:04:39] we do away with babies well you know I'm
[1:04:46] 70 years old and I'm looking at a world
[1:04:49] that's pretty soon wants to get rid of
[1:04:52] the elderly and all these things are
[1:04:56] just the mind when all this has done all
[1:04:59] this problem was caused because the
[1:05:01] elderly were the people that died the
[1:05:04] people that had underlining health
[1:05:07] things they're the reason that society
[1:05:11] was such shut down they're the reason
[1:05:13] that we went into this great world thing
[1:05:16] that was who died they were the weak and
[1:05:19] they couldn't do it you say oh that's
[1:05:21] that nobody will accept that thinking
[1:05:23] you better go back and study Hitler
[1:05:26] Hitler convinced the world that the Jews
[1:05:30] were the problem of the economic failure
[1:05:33] and of sickness because they bred like
[1:05:37] rats and by taking them out of the
[1:05:41] society that they would fix the social
[1:05:45] problems I'm telling you there's there's
[1:05:52] something else that's going on here
[1:05:55] there's a change in the way that people
[1:05:58] think there's a change in the man's
[1:06:02] approach and this effect is going to
[1:06:05] have an effect on their thinking and
[1:06:07] it's going to lead to something and if
[1:06:09] you don't have this spirit of truth you
[1:06:14] can be very easily swept away now we
[1:06:20] just quickly throw it away there's
[1:06:22] nothing to it we ought to search out
[1:06:25] these things find out whether they're
[1:06:27] right or not and remember if they're not
[1:06:31] right they will finally die for jesus
[1:06:34] said every plant that my heavenly father
[1:06:38] hath not planted will be rooted up but I
[1:06:45] think it was gamellia that made that
[1:06:47] great statement that time if it be of
[1:06:51] God we don't want to be found
[1:06:54] fighting against it if it not of God
[1:06:57] it'll come to naught anyhow so study it
[1:07:04] and think of it so even the words that
[1:07:09] I'm telling you I'm talking today about
[1:07:11] something that God's provided for us
[1:07:17] and now he said in here but when the
[1:07:21] Holy Ghost is come now someone said one
[1:07:26] time it's been speaking said the Holy
[1:07:29] Ghost is actually your mental mind you
[1:07:33] think that would put the Holy Spirit a
[1:07:37] thought but the Bible said when he and
[1:07:42] he is a personal pronoun see when he the
[1:07:47] person the Holy Ghost God comes he will
[1:07:51] reveal these things to you
[1:07:54] that I've told you then you see there's
[1:07:58] no other way of knowing what is truth
[1:08:04] you cannot get it by culture by seminary
[1:08:09] experience you'll only get it by the
[1:08:13] Holy Spirit he is the one that's been
[1:08:17] sent to reveal it now then he also said
[1:08:23] he will show you things to come now
[1:08:27] Hebrews the first chapter said God in
[1:08:31] son died times in divers manners spoke
[1:08:35] to the father's through the prophets by
[1:08:39] but in the last days by his son Jesus
[1:08:43] Christ it's the Holy Spirit taking over
[1:08:47] possession and taking possession of the
[1:08:51] church to operate Christ in the church
[1:08:56] then you become as he was he became as
[1:09:02] you was so you could become as he was
[1:09:07] see he became you that you might become
[1:09:12] him that it's above understanding
[1:09:17] there's no way to explain it you don't
[1:09:20] try to you just accept it he spoke it
[1:09:24] that settles it just right it's that way
[1:09:29] so we sit back and we understand we've
[1:09:35] been promised of faithful and true
[1:09:38] witness you know we've been promised the
[1:09:41] comforter we've been promised the Spirit
[1:09:45] of God we've been promised to something
[1:09:49] to lead us and guide us into all truth
[1:09:52] and righteousness oh it means so much to
[1:09:56] us that we understand that we have this
[1:10:02] at our disposal
[1:10:07] could you imagine somebody that had a
[1:10:12] garage full of toilet paper and they're
[1:10:15] not going to use any of it in case they
[1:10:19] run out oh you want me to put it the way
[1:10:23] the prophet of God put it he said it was
[1:10:26] like a little mice in the Garner's of
[1:10:30] Egypt so you starve to death when it's
[1:10:40] all there fear not little flock
[1:10:43] it's the father's good pleasure to give
[1:10:46] you the kingdom I'm trying to say this
[1:10:49] spirit is here with us because he's a
[1:10:53] faithful and true witness he said he
[1:11:00] will come and bring you in remembrance
[1:11:02] of all things that I said all the things
[1:11:05] he said through Paul all the things he
[1:11:08] said though Luther all the things he
[1:11:10] said through Wesley all the things that
[1:11:12] he said through our messenger he's here
[1:11:15] to bring you in real and remembrance
[1:11:18] that's why you can't put a minister in
[1:11:20] between you and the Word of God you must
[1:11:23] be filled and burned again that's what
[1:11:27] he said you must be born again in order
[1:11:30] to enter the kingdom of God you cannot
[1:11:33] know truth except by this spirit you
[1:11:37] can't be taught it it's got to be
[1:11:40] revealed
[1:11:41] you if got to be made personal to you
[1:11:46] and if we ever become to a place where
[1:11:51] we have church doctrine I don't mean
[1:11:54] true word doctrine I mean this is what
[1:11:58] we believe we should never be what we
[1:12:02] believe it should be this is what the
[1:12:04] spirit expressly spoke through the
[1:12:06] Prophet and by his son the Lord Jesus
[1:12:11] this is our source of life is this
[1:12:15] baptism of the holy spirit without this
[1:12:17] spirit all we've got is human
[1:12:20] explanations that don't lead they keep
[1:12:26] you still they set up camp and you can't
[1:12:34] go beyond their borders but we have
[1:12:36] Sunday meant we doesn't matter what's
[1:12:39] facing us it doesn't matter what the
[1:12:42] changes are we have been promised the
[1:12:45] Spirit of Truth the Spirit of Truth that
[1:12:49] he will lead us and guide us into all
[1:12:52] righteousness that he'll show us the
[1:12:55] path he'll be the light unto our way so
[1:13:00] we're not left in this I don't know
[1:13:02] where it's going but I want to know
[1:13:05] who's going to take me through it got to
[1:13:10] know
[1:13:11] I've got to have confidence in this
[1:13:16] spirit I don't want to have confidence I
[1:13:21] don't want this message to become
[1:13:25] academic where it's already been printed
[1:13:30] it's already on tape just say what it
[1:13:33] said don't you don't have to have no
[1:13:34] leadership of the Holy Spirit whatsoever
[1:13:39] no because the Spirit was promised to
[1:13:45] come and bring you in remembrance of
[1:13:49] what was spoken otherwise you're just
[1:13:53] seeking it by yourself otherwise you're
[1:13:56] just putting it on play and playing it
[1:13:58] over and over and over and over again
[1:14:01] let me tell you I hate to make this I
[1:14:04] may get criticized for this but without
[1:14:06] the Holy Spirit it can become dead
[1:14:09] letter yeah it's stored up but the
[1:14:17] Spirit is what leads us and bring us
[1:14:21] into remembrance of all the things that
[1:14:25] I've spoken and now you have a living
[1:14:30] relationship with the promise it's not a
[1:14:36] promise you have a living relationship
[1:14:39] with the promise you have a reliving
[1:14:41] relationship with the person that came
[1:14:43] Jesus Christ coming back in the form of
[1:14:46] the spirit to lead us and guide us it's
[1:14:49] such an important thing because you
[1:14:51] won't know the truth without that spirit
[1:14:54] because that's the person that leads us
[1:14:59] and guides us in to all truth
[1:15:05] and that's why it said when the Holy
[1:15:07] Spirit comes to call it Beelzebub
[1:15:13] there's no forgiveness that for that sin
[1:15:16] in this world in the world to come
[1:15:18] because you've you've cut off the life
[1:15:21] source that leads you and guide you so
[1:15:26] and I say this because I read these
[1:15:28] little things I want to say it to
[1:15:36] cultivate the relationship with the
[1:15:39] spirit to get used to coming into his
[1:15:44] presence to get used to seeking his face
[1:15:49] to tune your heart to the holy unction
[1:15:53] of the Spirit to be sensitive when he
[1:15:58] moves on the scene to realize he's there
[1:16:03] and he's leading us and he's guiding us
[1:16:06] not just to say oh he's in the volume of
[1:16:09] books and the volume of recordings
[1:16:11] that's the true unadulterated Word of
[1:16:14] God to me that's just the same as this
[1:16:16] Bible explained but it still takes this
[1:16:20] promise to manifest the life it still
[1:16:27] takes this promise to quicken the seed
[1:16:30] it still takes this promise to - to give
[1:16:34] us eyesalve that we might see to address
[1:16:38] us in fine linen to give us gold try it
[1:16:42] in fire it takes the working of the
[1:16:45] working spirit in our lives and I
[1:16:49] believe that this this great thing
[1:16:53] that's happened is a knock on the door
[1:16:58] that he can come in and sup with us
[1:17:01] it's the spirit staying to the church I
[1:17:05] want to come in and and take back over
[1:17:09] the leadership of your life
[1:17:15] doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong
[1:17:20] it's just that he's the one that he
[1:17:24] wants us yield to so if you're just
[1:17:27] yielded to the pages of this book by the
[1:17:31] intellect of your mind and by a
[1:17:35] conclusion that you've came to this is
[1:17:39] truth I believe everything it says but
[1:17:43] you must have the spirit bring it to
[1:17:46] life you must have that quickening
[1:17:49] spirit leading you and guiding you
[1:17:53] through the Word of God you can't
[1:17:56] separate spirit and truth they've got to
[1:18:01] work hand-in-hand so let's just take
[1:18:06] just a few moments and look at this
[1:18:09] faithful and true witness this comforter
[1:18:15] that he had from the beginning of
[1:18:18] creation of God what is he to us he's
[1:18:23] faithful and he's true so look if we
[1:18:29] just take a moment just to look at this
[1:18:31] spirit and and think this is what he's
[1:18:36] giving me it's something that's faithful
[1:18:40] you know somebody who's faithful and a
[1:18:43] true witness is somebody that'll always
[1:18:46] show up the spirit will always show up
[1:18:52] for you I will not leave you nor forsake
[1:18:57] you but I'll be with you I will come I
[1:19:02] will come to you so he's always he
[1:19:06] always shows up that boy I can trust
[1:19:12] somebody like that huh he he tells the
[1:19:17] same testimony
[1:19:19] he don't give a different testimony one
[1:19:22] time in a different something other time
[1:19:25] if you don't know you know that he's
[1:19:28] faithful you know that he's true you
[1:19:31] know he will always show up and you know
[1:19:33] you'll always speak the truth he'll
[1:19:38] always say the same thing you're not
[1:19:42] gonna get something one day that's gonna
[1:19:43] confuse with one mother day he's
[1:19:46] faithful he's true he's going to say the
[1:19:49] same thing he's going to have the same
[1:19:51] testimony he's never going to give a
[1:19:54] false report there's one thing God can't
[1:20:00] do and that's lie he's faithful he's
[1:20:07] true he's always going to tell you the
[1:20:10] truth you wouldn't count on it we're
[1:20:16] talking about being led now we're
[1:20:19] talking about we're moving into a time
[1:20:22] of the church where we're going to have
[1:20:24] to leave intellect and we're going to
[1:20:27] have to move into the leadership of the
[1:20:30] Holy Spirit's not outside of the word
[1:20:34] through the word the leadership of the
[1:20:38] Holy Spirit through the word not by
[1:20:40] sensations not by emotion but by the
[1:20:44] holy unction of the quickening power of
[1:20:47] the word being made alive Christ being
[1:20:51] made alive in the church as we just read
[1:20:56] he's always on time
[1:21:03] it's not early he's always on time when
[1:21:09] it's useful when it's needed that's when
[1:21:15] he shows up he doesn't show you
[1:21:17] something and then you forget it no he's
[1:21:23] right on time he's made you a promise
[1:21:26] I'm not gonna leave you I'm a faithful
[1:21:30] and true witness
[1:21:31] I'm the beginning of the creation of God
[1:21:34] ask anything the father of me for the
[1:21:37] father knoweth what you have need of
[1:21:39] even before you ask he's always on time
[1:21:42] this leadership that's got to come into
[1:21:45] the church the prophet of God preached
[1:21:48] leadership one of the last messages he
[1:21:51] left the church was that to give the
[1:21:53] church the understanding that they were
[1:21:55] going to have to come into this
[1:21:57] leadership of the Holy Spirit not oh I
[1:22:01] just don't know if I can say this
[1:22:02] without getting in trouble but not just
[1:22:06] the leadership of these pages that
[1:22:12] places you but yielded to the spirit so
[1:22:17] the spirit can bring you into
[1:22:19] remembrance and quicken these pages to
[1:22:22] you and be made alive for the moment
[1:22:27] that you're in that's Christ being made
[1:22:32] alive in you so he's always on time and
[1:22:38] it's always useful what he leads you to
[1:22:43] and what it gives you is something that
[1:22:45] you can use it's not just data bank
[1:22:50] sitting back and saying oh that's true
[1:22:52] that's true that's true it's like me
[1:22:56] going in my toolbox and I open my
[1:23:01] toolbox Oh pair of channellocks it's
[1:23:03] nice
[1:23:04] but it's not what I need it's not what I
[1:23:07] need to use it's not the job that needs
[1:23:10] to be done I've got to have this for
[1:23:14] this job
[1:23:15] well the faithful and true witness is
[1:23:18] always on time with what's useful he
[1:23:22] always provides proof always vindicates
[1:23:28] his proof always gives you eyesalve that
[1:23:32] you might see always opens it up it's
[1:23:36] wonderful as we realize my life I've got
[1:23:41] to examine myself right now and realize
[1:23:45] that there has been a great contrast in
[1:23:48] our country and in the world that things
[1:23:52] are changing and I can no longer rely on
[1:23:56] the way that I presumed things to be I
[1:24:00] must make contact with the one that's
[1:24:04] going to lead me and guide me into all
[1:24:08] truth and righteousness he always
[1:24:13] provides proof he always shows that what
[1:24:19] he's led you in and what he showed you
[1:24:22] has worked out has God ever showed you
[1:24:25] to do something and you did it and it
[1:24:27] was exactly the right thing to do the
[1:24:31] right thing to say the right way to
[1:24:33] handle it
[1:24:35] that's the kind of God we serve you know
[1:24:38] he got to become living in our lives
[1:24:43] because the more you you have men and
[1:24:47] their ideas the more you're going to
[1:24:50] have differences you're gonna have a
[1:24:53] thousand carnal explanations for what's
[1:24:57] transpired I don't know if I understand
[1:25:01] what's transpired but I do understand
[1:25:04] that God has sent us the Spirit of Truth
[1:25:06] to lead us and guide us and that he
[1:25:10] always proves what he reveals to be true
[1:25:16] amen his testimony is simple clear and
[1:25:24] easily understood he's a witness he come
[1:25:31] to testify of him he says he will be my
[1:25:35] witness and so shall you be my witnesses
[1:25:38] in all the world so these things also
[1:25:41] apply to us simple clear and easily
[1:25:50] understood it's always revelant
[1:25:56] to the case at hand to the situation it
[1:26:03] is it's not just coming up with some
[1:26:08] thing over here some teaching that
[1:26:11] doesn't apply I mean but it's always
[1:26:16] revelant
[1:26:17] it's always to what we have need of the
[1:26:20] food that comes out of the storehouse by
[1:26:23] the Holy Spirit is food if something to
[1:26:27] be digested something to supply life and
[1:26:31] and can and move our spirit in the
[1:26:35] direction of the image of his son
[1:26:39] so it's revelant and relevant to the
[1:26:46] situation it's spiritual food in due
[1:26:50] season it is not carnal man bringing it
[1:26:59] in and so many times it's easy for us as
[1:27:03] carnal man because we have so many books
[1:27:06] in so many tapes and so many things for
[1:27:09] us to go grab anything off the shelf and
[1:27:13] preach a truth and a doctrine and it be
[1:27:20] true
[1:27:21] but it may not be relevant to the
[1:27:25] condition of the people and that's what
[1:27:29] the church world is doing the nominal
[1:27:32] church world who no longer knows the
[1:27:34] father because he's on the outside
[1:27:37] trying to get in but he said if you will
[1:27:40] open up I will come in and I will sup
[1:27:44] with you I will feed you the evening
[1:27:46] meal I will feed you word that you have
[1:27:50] need of not just a sermon but life and
[1:28:00] truth I said my body is meat indeed and
[1:28:07] drink indeed is food its life mmm
[1:28:14] and so a faithful and true witness
[1:28:18] always doesn't show up with a testimony
[1:28:21] that doesn't have anything to do with
[1:28:23] the case it's relevant it's important to
[1:28:30] the outcome and they I say this the
[1:28:35] witness of the holy spirit of truth and
[1:28:38] righteousness in your life is important
[1:28:42] to the outcome I know it's easy for us
[1:28:48] to say I'm predestinated I'm see I have
[1:28:53] eternal life but if you have eternal
[1:28:56] life then you have a path that God's
[1:28:59] foreordained for you to walk in because
[1:29:05] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:29:07] ordered by the Lord and if you get out
[1:29:12] of that order then he chastises you and
[1:29:15] rebukes you to correct your path to work
[1:29:19] it back around to his perfect will so
[1:29:24] it's not saying oh I got the word I
[1:29:26] don't need the Spirit
[1:29:29] the word without the Spirit is dead and
[1:29:33] that what the Jews had they ended up
[1:29:36] having the law but they didn't have the
[1:29:39] fulfillment of the law which is the
[1:29:42] Spirit of the Lord
[1:29:44] I would hope to not that we wouldn't get
[1:29:47] to the place that we say we have the
[1:29:48] message we've got it in form but until
[1:29:55] the Spirit makes connection with the
[1:29:59] life of the believer and starts
[1:30:02] quickening that word to them revealing
[1:30:04] that word to him speaking that word to
[1:30:07] them proving that word tune never giving
[1:30:11] a false interpretation of that word then
[1:30:15] it doesn't live and you know I'll tell
[1:30:19] you one thing about this true and
[1:30:21] faithful witness it's an expert in his
[1:30:25] field
[1:30:26] he knows what he's talking about
[1:30:29] I am the faithful and true witness
[1:30:33] because I am the beginning of the
[1:30:37] creation of God
[1:30:38] I am your faithful and true witness
[1:30:41] because I'm the one that drew the
[1:30:47] program remember the man with the
[1:30:50] carburetor
[1:30:51] he said do this and do this he says how
[1:30:54] do you know well I'm the designer for it
[1:30:57] I built it you understand he built you
[1:31:02] and my sheep hear my voice and another
[1:31:07] they won't follow he built you he knows
[1:31:12] you he knows what he's Alpha and Omega
[1:31:15] the beginning and the end the beginning
[1:31:18] of the creation of God the faithful and
[1:31:22] true witness he knows that he only bears
[1:31:27] record to the truth
[1:31:31] there's only one thing he witnesses and
[1:31:34] that's the revealed Word of God he's not
[1:31:38] witnessing to go build an ark he's
[1:31:42] witnessing the word that's here to feed
[1:31:46] us now we've got to be in tune with this
[1:31:52] spirit well got to come in deeper
[1:31:55] contact God's provided a way of comfort
[1:31:58] leadership in truth and it's the truth
[1:32:01] that sets you free and I say this that
[1:32:04] we must renew our contact with the holy
[1:32:09] spirit can't be afraid of it it may
[1:32:14] chastise you but no chastisement feels
[1:32:18] comfortable yes and don't substitute an
[1:32:25] intellectual conception of the
[1:32:29] historical facts and vindication of
[1:32:33] brother branham's ministry that he was a
[1:32:36] prophet that is a historical fact that's
[1:32:41] more true to me than George Washington
[1:32:43] crossed the Delaware but it doesn't
[1:32:47] eliminate the movement of the Holy
[1:32:51] Spirit in our lives ok these are the
[1:32:55] things that he testified in Joshua oh 1
[1:32:58] 5 in their Hebrews 13 85 he said I'll
[1:33:02] never leave thee nor forsake thee so
[1:33:06] he's not gonna leave us now I'll not
[1:33:08] leave you comfortless so when we faced
[1:33:11] this hour when we face the changes that
[1:33:14] are gonna come when we're going to face
[1:33:16] the changes in our jobs but some of us
[1:33:19] may face layoffs some of us may taste
[1:33:22] many different challenge just remember
[1:33:25] he's given us somebody to lead us
[1:33:30] through
[1:33:31] go there first spend time there let him
[1:33:38] speak to your heart and you will find
[1:33:41] that he's got counsel for you because
[1:33:52] he's the counselor

[1:34:15] morning if we could bow our heads and
[1:34:19] and I just ask you this morning to
[1:34:26] consider in examining yourself if we
[1:34:34] need a renewed contact with the
[1:34:39] leadership of the Holy Spirit in our
[1:34:41] lives if we need to become more
[1:34:50] sensitive to the unction of the Holy
[1:34:54] Spirit if we need to inclined our ear to
[1:35:01] his voice
[1:35:05] if we need to give him time in our life
[1:35:12] set aside time for counseling set aside
[1:35:19] time for worship that we understand we
[1:35:25] have a storehouse full of food
[1:35:28] vindicated and proven we have a message
[1:35:31] that's been spoken but now we need that
[1:35:35] Holy Spirit to make it alive we needed
[1:35:41] him to feed it to us day by day he
[1:35:50] promised that it'll be with us and even
[1:35:56] in us till the end so maybe at home if
[1:36:00] you've been listening
[1:36:06] maybe you've realized that this is a
[1:36:10] great call by the spirit to the church
[1:36:16] to let them know that things could
[1:36:18] change in a twinkling of an eye to let
[1:36:24] us know that the future has changed and
[1:36:27] man's going to change their course but
[1:36:32] God's the unchanging God he's the
[1:36:35] faithful and true witness his witness
[1:36:37] has been the same
[1:36:39] before the stars ever were hung in the
[1:36:42] sky and he said I'll take you through

[1:37:02] I'll lead you and I'll guide you and
[1:37:07] this morning if you've been away from
[1:37:12] that guide if you've been so busy in
