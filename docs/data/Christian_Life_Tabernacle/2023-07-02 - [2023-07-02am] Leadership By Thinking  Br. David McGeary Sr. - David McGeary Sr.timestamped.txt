[12:23] [Music]
[12:34] [Music]
[12:37] s commit the service to the Lord this
[12:39] morning Father we just always so
[12:41] grateful once again to come into your
[12:43] presence Lord that we have a place that
[12:45] we can come and set aside and Lord to
[12:48] lift up your name and to learn of you
[12:51] Lord I pray that we would just take care
[12:53] to use every moment to
[12:55] lay ourselves before you father and give
[12:58] you an opportunity to Lord to have your
[13:00] way we commit this whole service to you
[13:03] Lord that your will would be done
[13:05] Lord you know each one of us that have
[13:07] come into this place what we have need
[13:09] of even more than ourselves Lord the
[13:12] things that we need to hear of you
[13:14] Lord and we welcome your presence we
[13:16] pray that there were nothing though here
[13:18] that would hinder your working
[13:20] Lord that you'd have freedom to move on
[13:22] hearts and to change lives and to Lord
[13:25] to minister your word and to make
[13:27] yourself known
[13:28] Lord I pray that any spirit that would
[13:30] stand in the way of Lord your Mighty
[13:32] hand working Lord would be rebuked by
[13:35] your word
[13:36] Lord as you have promised that where two
[13:38] or three are gathered in your name
[13:40] your present there in the midst
[13:43] Lord we thank you for all things and we
[13:46] commit this service this day all things
[13:48] to you in Jesus name amen
[13:52] good morning
[13:55] I was glad when they said unto me
[13:58] let us go into the house of the Lord
[14:02] it's a familiar statement
[14:05] for any of us and certainly something we
[14:07] all say Amen to
[14:11] you know there's certainly something
[14:12] refreshing and strengthening about
[14:14] Gathering Together
[14:16] in the place that we've set aside to
[14:18] worship Him
[14:20] this is the opening verse of Psalm 122.
[14:24] and while it's something we're all
[14:27] familiar with
[14:29] can agree on it's worth taking a moment
[14:31] to look exactly at how he says it
[14:36] it doesn't say
[14:38] I was glad when we went into the house
[14:40] of the Lord
[14:43] it says I was glad when they said to me
[14:48] let us go into the house of the Lord
[14:52] see the house of the Lord is not
[14:54] something you can just go into
[14:56] [Music]
[14:58] you have to be called into it
[15:01] you have to be invited into the house
[15:06] what made him glad
[15:08] was the invitation to go in
[15:13] you see you just can't enter into
[15:15] someone else's house
[15:17] uninvited
[15:19] or else you're an intruder
[15:22] or a thief
[15:24] says in John told the people in chapter
[15:28] Jesus told the people in John 10 he said
[15:30] verily verily I say unto you
[15:33] he that entereth not by the door
[15:36] into the Sheepfold but clineth up some
[15:39] other way
[15:40] the same as a thief and a robber
[15:44] but he that entereth in by the door
[15:47] is this is The Shepherd of the Sheep
[15:52] to him the Porter openeth and the sheep
[15:55] hear his voice and he calleth his own
[15:58] Sheep by name
[16:02] and leadeth them out a little later in
[16:04] verse 7 it says verily verily I say unto
[16:07] you I am the door
[16:09] of the Sheep
[16:12] you know before we go into someone
[16:14] else's house you have to be invited by
[16:17] name
[16:20] I was glad when they said unto me
[16:23] let us go into the house of the Lord
[16:28] out of reverence we refer to
[16:30] buildings like these as the house of the
[16:33] Lord but
[16:35] you know scripturally speaking this
[16:36] isn't really his house
[16:38] no more than any of the other buildings
[16:40] you might find in Bedford
[16:45] Paul and Stephen both quoted Isaiah 66
[16:48] when the when he said thus saith the
[16:50] Lord
[16:51] the heaven is my throne
[16:53] and the Earth is my footstool
[16:56] where is the house that ye
[16:58] will build for me
[17:02] and where is the place of my rest
[17:05] for all these things hath mine hand made
[17:10] you know the house of the Lord is not
[17:12] something built by men
[17:15] whether it's made out of wood
[17:18] or it's made out of religion
[17:21] still man-made
[17:24] God God's house isn't something made by
[17:27] men
[17:31] as Solomon said in First Kings 8 27 but
[17:34] will God indeed dwell on the Earth
[17:37] behold the heaven and Heaven of heavens
[17:40] cannot contain thee
[17:43] how much less this house that I have
[17:46] built it
[17:48] you know a house is a Dwelling Place
[17:52] a place that has your name on it
[17:57] the house of the Lord is his Dwelling
[17:59] Place
[18:00] and it's the place that has his name on
[18:02] it
[18:04] you just
[18:05] just as you choose the place where you
[18:07] dwell and put your name
[18:10] so also does he choose the place where
[18:12] he dwells
[18:14] and puts his name
[18:18] he told his people in Deuteronomy 12 11
[18:20] then there shall be a place
[18:24] which the Lord your God shall choose
[18:27] to cause his name to dwell there
[18:32] the house of the Lord is
[18:35] a place of his choosing
[18:37] where he dwells
[18:40] where he puts his name
[18:42] I was glad when they said unto me let us
[18:47] go in
[18:48] to the house of the Lord
[18:51] you know the other thing about a house
[18:53] is it has a household
[18:55] you know brother Branham preached a
[18:57] message called thy house
[18:59] in 1961.
[19:02] and in it he reads that story from acts
[19:04] 16 where
[19:06] Paul and Silas are in prison
[19:08] they begin to sing
[19:11] the Lord moves on the scene and sends an
[19:13] earthquake that
[19:15] opens the gates and breaks the chains
[19:17] and sets them free
[19:19] you remember the story The Keeper of the
[19:21] prison came and he was
[19:24] believing that the prisoners had escaped
[19:26] was about to take his own life
[19:28] when Paul called out and said don't harm
[19:31] yourself we're all still here
[19:34] but you know the scripture that brother
[19:36] Branham took there as he read that story
[19:38] was
[19:39] when the Jailer fell on his knees and
[19:42] said sirs what must I do to be saved
[19:45] and he said that this is what the he
[19:47] told him
[19:48] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[19:51] thou shalt be saved and thy house
[19:57] see brother Branham preached a whole
[19:58] message about how the
[20:00] faith of one yes upon the word
[20:04] can cause the whole rest of the house to
[20:07] find their place
[20:08] and be saved
[20:11] but see this wasn't speaking of a
[20:13] building being saved
[20:16] or a physical structure
[20:19] but it was speaking of those that dwelt
[20:21] in the house
[20:22] the house hold
[20:25] those of the house
[20:27] can benefit from the faith of the one
[20:30] whose house it is
[20:35] I was glad when they said unto me
[20:38] let us go in to the house of the Lord
[20:45] you know I was made glad
[20:49] when an offer was made for me
[20:53] an invitation by name
[20:56] to become a participator
[20:59] a member
[21:00] of this household
[21:05] Paul says in Ephesians 2 now therefore
[21:08] ye are no more strangers and foreigners
[21:11] but fellow citizens with the Saints
[21:15] and of the household of God
[21:20] and are built upon the foundation of the
[21:22] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[21:24] himself being the Chief Cornerstone
[21:28] in whom all the building fitly framed
[21:31] together groweth into a holy Temple in
[21:34] the Lord in whom ye are builded together
[21:36] for inhabitation
[21:39] a Dwelling Place
[21:42] of God through the spirit
[21:44] I was glad when they said unto me
[21:48] let us go into the house of the Lord
[21:53] you know I think we can say Amen to that
[21:58] an entrance has been ministered
[22:00] an invitation has been made by name
[22:05] for us to participate in that household
[22:09] as much as we may enjoy coming together
[22:11] to Worship the Lord in this building
[22:15] and hear the word
[22:16] how much more
[22:19] should we be glad that we heard our name
[22:21] called
[22:22] and that we were given an opportunity
[22:24] to participate in the house as an
[22:28] invited member
[22:31] I was glad when they said unto me
[22:35] let us go into the house of the Lord
[22:38] how many are glad this morning that we
[22:41] can go into the house of the Lord
[22:43] let's just read that little Psalm
[22:45] together it's Psalm 122 starting in
[22:48] verse 1. I was glad when they said unto
[22:51] me let us go into the house of the Lord
[22:54] our feet shall stand within thy Gates o
[22:57] Jerusalem Jerusalem is builded as a city
[23:00] that is compact together wither the
[23:03] tribes go up the tribes of the Lord unto
[23:06] the testimony of Israel to give thanks
[23:09] unto the name of the Lord but there are
[23:11] set Thrones of judgment the Thrones of
[23:14] the House of David pray for the Peace of
[23:16] Jerusalem they shall prosper they love
[23:19] thee peace be within thy walls and
[23:22] prosperity within thy palaces for my
[23:25] brethren and companion's sake I will now
[23:27] say peace be within thee because of the
[23:30] house of the Lord Our God I will seek
[23:33] thy good
[23:38] amen God bless you we have your seats

[54:44] [Music]

[54:54] bodily
[54:56] with all power
[54:59] and might
[55:01] creator of the heavens and earth
[55:04] and yet
[55:06] he humbled himself under the death of
[55:09] the Cross Lord for us this morning
[55:12] [Music]
[55:15] that by his stripes we could be healed
[55:20] in that the chastisement
[55:23] the punishment of our sins would be on

[59:19] with them and we're sitting in the
[59:20] restaurant my mom turns over she said oh
[59:24] see this this is where we had my High
[59:26] School prom
[59:28] you know in 1938 I think or something
[59:31] but it was just kind of nice to have her
[59:34] point out things and and everything to
[59:37] be there so I'm grateful for that she's
[59:40] doing good I guess the hardest part of
[59:43] my life is that you begin to realize
[59:46] that
[59:48] you're not going to keep them forever if
[59:51] the Lord tarries
[59:52] and the only way that you can be with
[59:55] them forever is through the love and
[59:58] grace of the Lord Jesus and so I trust
[1:00:01] that he will expand that I'm not going
[1:00:04] to sing a special so God bless you all
[1:00:07] you can go I know you look for the great
[1:00:11] expectation I'll sing a special the day
[1:00:14] I retire
[1:00:16] and then everybody else will be happy
[1:00:20] but we're we're grateful for the good
[1:00:23] things of the Lord and we trust that
[1:00:26] it'll be a blessing so any other
[1:00:28] visitors that I missed this morning it's
[1:00:30] nice to be here
[1:00:33] um
[1:00:34] to uh this morning I before we stand and
[1:00:39] read our scriptures
[1:00:40] I had a thought on my heart and
[1:00:44] it just kept burning in my heart this
[1:00:46] thought and uh
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:49] um
[1:00:50] and so I you know I I'm thinking you
[1:00:54] know I know it's somewhere and I you
[1:00:57] know if you you have something that's
[1:01:00] burning in your heart you want to find
[1:01:03] it somewhere in the word of God you know
[1:01:05] what I mean
[1:01:06] and so I just kept thinking I was
[1:01:10] reading in leadership and and the
[1:01:14] message leadership was on my heart and
[1:01:16] and there was something burning out of
[1:01:19] leadership that just struck me and then
[1:01:22] the Lord brought it just kind of spoke
[1:01:24] to me and said I I preached this thought
[1:01:29] okay okay what you're thinking I've I've
[1:01:33] ministered and then he brought this
[1:01:36] message to us which we will look into a
[1:01:39] little bit this morning called thinking
[1:01:41] man's filter so let's stand this morning
[1:01:45] and turn in our Bibles to Ephesians
[1:01:49] uh
[1:01:51] uh
[1:01:52] 5 19 through 27
[1:01:56] Ephesians 5 19-27
[1:02:01] um
[1:02:02] I I
[1:02:06] want to kind of approach this this
[1:02:08] morning
[1:02:09] in a way that
[1:02:12] if the Lord will help me that it strikes
[1:02:15] home
[1:02:16] to us individually
[1:02:18] not as a subject matter
[1:02:21] or as a Bible study but somehow if the
[1:02:26] Lord would help me this morning where it
[1:02:30] could come to each of us personally and
[1:02:33] cause us to reflect
[1:02:36] on the process that we're in every day
[1:02:40] so if you would pray that the Lord would
[1:02:42] help us do that this morning then I hope
[1:02:46] it wouldn't be me but it would be him
[1:02:48] speaking to you
[1:02:52] therefore
[1:02:54] as the church is subject unto Christ so
[1:02:58] let the wives be to their own husbands
[1:03:01] in everything
[1:03:04] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:03:08] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:03:11] for it
[1:03:12] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:03:16] with the washing of the Water by the
[1:03:21] word that he might present it to himself
[1:03:25] a glorious church not having spot or
[1:03:30] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:03:34] should be holy and without
[1:03:37] blemish our heavenly father we ask you
[1:03:40] to bless your word test this morning in
[1:03:43] your precious name we pray amen may be
[1:03:46] seated
[1:03:51] I think this scripture
[1:03:54] uh
[1:03:56] presents to us
[1:03:59] the goal of Paul
[1:04:03] and the goal of
[1:04:05] the gospel itself
[1:04:07] that that the gospel had a purpose it
[1:04:12] had a goal it had something that it
[1:04:15] wanted to achieve uh it wasn't just
[1:04:19] given out there to be studied it wasn't
[1:04:22] just
[1:04:24] presented as the truth that this is true
[1:04:29] and and perceive it as truth but it was
[1:04:34] a a living working goal
[1:04:39] so in other words when you have a goal
[1:04:42] you just don't sit down and imagine your
[1:04:46] goal
[1:04:47] you know what I'm saying if you if uh
[1:04:50] possibly maybe a young fellow would in
[1:04:54] his mind he would have a goal of
[1:04:58] getting a a new pickup truck or
[1:05:02] something just get the thought that I'm
[1:05:06] trying to wrap my he couldn't just sit
[1:05:09] down and and and look at pickup trucks
[1:05:12] and go online and look at pickup trucks
[1:05:15] and just sit there and say
[1:05:17] oh
[1:05:18] someday Santa Claus is going to bring me
[1:05:21] a pickup truck you know or the Easter
[1:05:24] Bunny
[1:05:25] is going to put a pickup truck under a
[1:05:28] rock and I'm going to found it in other
[1:05:31] words that's how foolish that thinking
[1:05:34] would be
[1:05:35] but if he's got a goal in his mind then
[1:05:38] he's got to realize I've got to work
[1:05:40] towards that goal I've got to do certain
[1:05:43] things you know I got to get a driver's
[1:05:45] license you know I'm going to have to
[1:05:47] get insurance I'm going to have to do
[1:05:49] this and do that and and so he strives
[1:05:52] to accomplish his goal
[1:05:56] well God had an image of you in his mind
[1:06:01] is that right but when you were born in
[1:06:04] this world you weren't born in that
[1:06:07] image
[1:06:08] you were born in this world a liar
[1:06:13] we all came into the world speaking lies
[1:06:17] that that when we came in that's the
[1:06:20] shape that we were in we were lost
[1:06:24] we had all kinds of uh
[1:06:29] things wrong with us in fact we didn't
[1:06:31] even have a chance
[1:06:33] and but yet God in his mind had
[1:06:36] something that he wanted us to be
[1:06:40] something that he saw in us and he
[1:06:44] begins to draw us and work us towards
[1:06:49] that uh end that he had in mind so he he
[1:06:55] saw you as a sinner and so he started
[1:06:58] the process if I could say it that way
[1:07:00] to accomplish the goal that he had and
[1:07:05] we know that his goal was right was to
[1:07:08] restore his fallen family all of us in
[1:07:13] the beginning really belonged in the
[1:07:16] Garden of Eden
[1:07:18] we are living in a world that is not
[1:07:21] ours
[1:07:23] we are in this world but we are not of
[1:07:27] this world
[1:07:29] this world is not my home
[1:07:32] I feel like traveling on because so the
[1:07:37] Lord knew that about you so okay if you
[1:07:40] could just understand that in his heart
[1:07:43] your heart this morning that he he saw
[1:07:45] you were born in this world he knew that
[1:07:48] sin caused it that you you married this
[1:07:53] life that you're in this nature that
[1:07:56] you're in that came because the husband
[1:08:00] of this life was was sin it was the fall
[1:08:05] in the garden is what put you here but
[1:08:09] yet you were still in him and a part of
[1:08:13] him and he knew you for what you were in
[1:08:18] the beginning
[1:08:19] not for how that you got here
[1:08:23] so he begins to reach out to you and to
[1:08:28] deal with you and to seek you and to
[1:08:32] find you and then when he finds you he
[1:08:34] convicts you of the life you're living
[1:08:37] and you're living life I was happy I was
[1:08:40] just a hippie you know just bebopping
[1:08:43] along you know uh
[1:08:45] and uh you know just listening to my
[1:08:49] music and and and participating in my
[1:08:52] activities and all those things and all
[1:08:55] of a sudden
[1:08:57] the hand of God moves
[1:09:01] and and
[1:09:03] I wasn't expecting it
[1:09:06] and he began to deal with my heart and
[1:09:08] he begins to reach out and he begins to
[1:09:11] call and act and things that begin to
[1:09:14] fall apart I don't even know what's
[1:09:16] happening to me but he does
[1:09:20] because I saw what I wanted to be but he
[1:09:24] had something else in mind and I'll tell
[1:09:27] you something Paul had something else in
[1:09:30] mind too
[1:09:31] but one day he met him on the road to
[1:09:33] Damascus and the Lord said it's hard to
[1:09:36] kick against the prick Paul you're gonna
[1:09:38] find out the things that I have in mind
[1:09:41] for you the things that you'll suffer
[1:09:43] the things that you're going to show you
[1:09:45] and I and you're going to go preach this
[1:09:47] gospel to the Gentiles the one minute
[1:09:50] he's sitting here gonna persecute the
[1:09:52] church wipe out this heresy he's going
[1:09:55] to place himself in a great Realms of of
[1:09:58] the church and and be a hero maybe up
[1:10:02] for high priest you know you you don't
[1:10:04] know in the next minute he's blind in an
[1:10:08] alley
[1:10:10] and gonna go preach the gospel to the
[1:10:13] Gentiles Ah that's the kind of God we
[1:10:16] serve
[1:10:18] amen so God had a goal
[1:10:22] you understand he's trying to achieve
[1:10:24] that goal
[1:10:26] and I want to share with you something
[1:10:28] this morning that's necessary for us
[1:10:32] if we are going to achieve
[1:10:36] that goal
[1:10:37] and so I hope that you can take but
[1:10:40] let's listen to what he says here
[1:10:43] he said he said
[1:10:46] he says Christ also loved the church and
[1:10:49] gave himself for it
[1:10:51] so why did he do that
[1:10:54] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:10:59] with the washing
[1:11:02] by the word
[1:11:05] so he he knew it needed to be what
[1:11:08] washed so he saw it there it was lying
[1:11:12] lying born in sin come into the world
[1:11:15] speaking lies full of lust and envy and
[1:11:19] Malice and hatred and everything and he
[1:11:22] realized that he had to wash that out of
[1:11:26] them
[1:11:28] you understand that they needed to be
[1:11:31] washed they needed to be cleaned so he
[1:11:34] went to Calvary he died but not only did
[1:11:38] he die to pay the price of your sins
[1:11:41] that's only half of it
[1:11:44] so your sins are paid but you're still
[1:11:46] dirty
[1:11:49] okay so then he wanted to start
[1:11:52] cleansing him
[1:11:54] washing you right he's going to work you
[1:11:58] he's going to mold you he's going to
[1:12:00] change you he's going to there's going
[1:12:03] to be a transformation
[1:12:04] that takes place and I could go in to a
[1:12:08] great teaching on the power of
[1:12:11] transformation but you all know this
[1:12:14] morning that he put that power to
[1:12:17] transform was in you when you came into
[1:12:20] the world but something had to bring
[1:12:24] that power of transformation to life
[1:12:27] so therefore the word had to strike the
[1:12:31] sea in order to germinate it and to
[1:12:36] start that process so God washes by his
[1:12:39] word
[1:12:42] believe me I've been doing my I I
[1:12:45] shouldn't say that I wanted to say I've
[1:12:47] been doing my best to follow this
[1:12:49] message but I haven't done half of what
[1:12:52] I should have done
[1:12:54] to follow this message
[1:12:56] but
[1:12:58] but it's still he had a a way of of
[1:13:03] doing it and what I meant to say is I've
[1:13:07] I've been in this for 50
[1:13:10] some years now I that I've been
[1:13:14] following the the this word that was
[1:13:18] given to us in this day and I have to
[1:13:21] say it's still washing me
[1:13:25] you understand that it's still washing
[1:13:28] me and uh and I just trust the Lord will
[1:13:32] help us move this morning it says
[1:13:36] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:13:39] with the washing of Water by the word so
[1:13:44] we know by this very scripture that he
[1:13:47] found his bride his church unclean
[1:13:53] and and
[1:13:55] okay John says any man that's safe he's
[1:13:59] sinneth not a liar
[1:14:02] but we had a Pictionary we have some
[1:14:05] somebody that came and and paid the
[1:14:10] price for that and now wanting to
[1:14:13] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[1:14:17] then he so he goes on them I say it that
[1:14:20] he might present it to himself
[1:14:25] a glorious Church
[1:14:28] not having spot
[1:14:31] or wrinkle
[1:14:33] or any such thing
[1:14:37] so it's got to be spotless
[1:14:40] without spot
[1:14:42] and we're going to talk about
[1:14:44] spots and wrinkles I probably
[1:14:48] concentrate more on the wrinkles
[1:14:55] I guess there's only half of us that's
[1:14:57] worried about wrinkles right okay or any
[1:15:02] such thing
[1:15:03] but that it should be holy and without
[1:15:08] bleming
[1:15:09] so he just didn't want to save it
[1:15:13] and he didn't want the work
[1:15:17] just to be reflective
[1:15:21] on himself
[1:15:23] but he wanted to produce it just excuse
[1:15:26] my vocabulary but he wanted to produce a
[1:15:30] product or or something that was holy
[1:15:36] without spot or blemish
[1:15:39] and without wrinkle and and that that's
[1:15:45] that was what that he wanted that's what
[1:15:48] he was going to do and so if he said
[1:15:51] this is why he died this is why he gave
[1:15:54] himself for the church then that can't
[1:15:57] fail
[1:16:00] you understand that I mean he he didn't
[1:16:03] do that and then it and then have it
[1:16:07] fail because if it failed then he didn't
[1:16:11] do it
[1:16:12] you understand so he's going to have
[1:16:15] this church
[1:16:16] now there's a way to make it easier
[1:16:21] you know but uh you know so in
[1:16:25] experience is a a teacher but it's not
[1:16:28] the best teacher instruction is the best
[1:16:31] teacher
[1:16:33] you know if someone says hot hot
[1:16:37] you know no no hot hot well
[1:16:40] if you want to accept that instructions
[1:16:43] fine but if you want to reach up there
[1:16:46] and touch it and find out well you found
[1:16:49] out the same thing that you were
[1:16:51] instructed it's hot
[1:16:55] well I just bring us in this morning and
[1:16:59] and see so the Lord had this great
[1:17:03] purpose in his mind of having this
[1:17:07] restored body Adam and Eve without sin
[1:17:10] Christ in his bride back in eternity
[1:17:14] God's restored family with him having
[1:17:17] the pre Eminence over and so they they
[1:17:21] started this uh great
[1:17:24] he started this great work of restoring
[1:17:28] man and we know he's going to finish
[1:17:30] restoring Israel now he's restoring his
[1:17:34] Gentile bride and we're living in the
[1:17:37] last days of that restoration
[1:17:41] he's kept now giving to his church
[1:17:47] the last
[1:17:49] of
[1:17:51] truths that they need to reach this
[1:17:55] Perfection and that Perfection that they
[1:17:58] needed to reach
[1:18:00] it was hid behind Seven Seals
[1:18:05] the the mystery of Christ and the
[1:18:08] Mystery of godliness the the mystery of
[1:18:11] his church was was hid
[1:18:15] by these Seven Seals and we know that in
[1:18:19] our generation those seals were open to
[1:18:23] us
[1:18:24] and
[1:18:25] and in the opening of this seals
[1:18:27] Enlightenment came to the church and
[1:18:31] that through this Enlightenment that
[1:18:34] they might know what the fellowship is
[1:18:37] between the father and the son and the
[1:18:40] church
[1:18:42] that they might come into this
[1:18:44] Fellowship
[1:18:46] and my might come into uh this great
[1:18:50] understanding this morning
[1:18:53] so this morning you've got to realize
[1:18:58] that that you are important
[1:19:02] to him
[1:19:04] and if you were part of of him in the
[1:19:08] beginning
[1:19:09] he's not going to fail you
[1:19:13] no matter what that he has to do to you
[1:19:17] to get you there
[1:19:19] we know sometimes he's got to put you
[1:19:22] flat on your back sometimes you've got
[1:19:24] to become a total failure sometimes you
[1:19:28] got you've just got to you you're just
[1:19:31] going the wrong way and he's just got to
[1:19:34] step in and and take drastic measures
[1:19:37] what we trust and hope that that's not
[1:19:40] the case but praise God if it is
[1:19:45] because I I want to know that God's
[1:19:49] going to do whatever it takes to get me
[1:19:52] there
[1:19:54] and he has that ability
[1:19:56] but he's not going to do it without
[1:20:00] having fellowship with me in it because
[1:20:05] that was the other one of the other
[1:20:07] purposes of God is that he wanted to
[1:20:10] have fellowship with you so this morning
[1:20:12] he's wanting to have fellowship with you
[1:20:15] he's wanting to reach out to you he's
[1:20:18] wanting to touch you he's wanting to
[1:20:20] stimulate you you he he's wanting to
[1:20:24] bring you around if I could say this to
[1:20:27] his way of thinking
[1:20:30] and so if I if I had a title this
[1:20:34] morning for my message I I would call it
[1:20:38] leadership by thinking or look at your
[1:20:42] thinking
[1:20:45] look at your thinking
[1:20:48] and I I
[1:20:50] didn't realize how important that was as
[1:20:55] I was I just was talking and thinking
[1:20:58] about leadership and having the mind of
[1:21:00] Christ and all these things and and the
[1:21:04] the word just kept speaking back to me
[1:21:07] the Lord did he just kept saying
[1:21:10] thinking man's filter thinking man's
[1:21:13] filter
[1:21:14] and you know I heard that about 15 times
[1:21:17] you know I'm a little thick-headed and a
[1:21:19] little that's just the way I am I'm
[1:21:22] Irish you know what I mean then and uh
[1:21:26] we like to travel so if uh you know God
[1:21:30] wants to get you on something normally
[1:21:32] you take a trip I think Jonah was Irish
[1:21:38] if you get my point
[1:21:41] so
[1:21:43] it it struck me so okay this great
[1:21:47] thought I have is an original
[1:21:52] oh
[1:21:54] that's humble down Dave
[1:21:56] you know what I mean
[1:22:01] I laid this in the word the only reason
[1:22:03] that you're starting to think this way
[1:22:06] is because it's something you need
[1:22:11] you know it was like oh it was great
[1:22:14] I've got this thought and I'm going to
[1:22:16] bring this sermon and and you know I
[1:22:19] need to bring a good sermon now and
[1:22:21] every now and then you know and I mean
[1:22:23] I've got one in ten I'd be happy with
[1:22:26] that
[1:22:27] and
[1:22:28] all of a sudden it's just struck me this
[1:22:31] isn't something
[1:22:33] that I'm just looking to preach
[1:22:36] this is something that's been stored up
[1:22:40] connect he's bringing to me now to show
[1:22:44] me this is something that if you're
[1:22:48] going to reach that goal of having uh
[1:22:54] being without spot without wrinkle
[1:22:57] without blemish that there's something
[1:23:00] that you've got to achieve there's
[1:23:04] something that you've got to take charge
[1:23:07] of there's something that's got to
[1:23:09] happen within you in order for you to be
[1:23:13] christ-like
[1:23:21] it struck me in a different light
[1:23:26] in a different realization oh okay
[1:23:30] you're wanting to take me up higher
[1:23:36] in in and I'm not going to go further
[1:23:40] and tell
[1:23:42] I overcome
[1:23:45] this part of my nature
[1:23:53] you understand so and I'm putting myself
[1:23:56] in the boat with you
[1:23:59] I'm not here lecturing you this morning
[1:24:01] I'm not here saying this is what you
[1:24:04] need this is what you've got to do I'm
[1:24:08] trying to say this with all of my heart
[1:24:10] this morning it's something that I
[1:24:13] realize in my heart and in my spirit
[1:24:16] that this body of Believers this bride
[1:24:21] This Woman This elected lady that keeps
[1:24:26] fitted and joined together by people
[1:24:29] from all different walks of life all
[1:24:31] different backgrounds everything that
[1:24:34] this is an accomplishment that the whole
[1:24:37] church has to make
[1:24:42] and
[1:24:44] uh
[1:24:45] just as the office of a pastor this
[1:24:49] morning I feel I can be that spokesman
[1:24:54] okay so it's this is not nickelodeonism
[1:24:57] this morning
[1:24:58] this is hey all of us need to understand
[1:25:02] that God sent a messenger
[1:25:06] we understand that we also know that
[1:25:10] that
[1:25:12] the Bible
[1:25:15] and the message aren't two different
[1:25:18] things
[1:25:20] you understand if the message came from
[1:25:23] the Bible
[1:25:24] then it'll have the same characteristics
[1:25:28] of the Bible
[1:25:30] you understand if something came from a
[1:25:33] of a bumblebee had a bumble bee the
[1:25:36] Bumblebee's going to sting
[1:25:40] you understand so yeah we don't have to
[1:25:43] go through all of the things about you
[1:25:46] being in your grandfather and all the
[1:25:48] attributes of God we've almost wore
[1:25:50] those things out in fact we've warned
[1:25:53] the Theology of this message out but we
[1:25:56] haven't got the life of it working in US
[1:25:59] heck and I feel this morning that the
[1:26:03] reason the life is not working in us
[1:26:06] even the way that we want it to is we
[1:26:09] haven't overcome this one process
[1:26:14] so we know that that there that they
[1:26:17] come from the same source
[1:26:19] and so uh
[1:26:22] and that the word
[1:26:25] when we talk about the word we we say
[1:26:30] that the word is a thought expressed
[1:26:33] right so the word is the thinking of God
[1:26:38] that's what the word is the word is how
[1:26:42] God thinks
[1:26:45] may I say it like this the word is the
[1:26:49] way that God would approach every
[1:26:53] circumstance and everything that ever
[1:26:56] came up yeah
[1:27:00] how he would approach every person every
[1:27:04] trial
[1:27:05] every uh dismay that's what he told
[1:27:09] Joshua he said Be not Afraid neither be
[1:27:12] thou dismayed for I am the Lord thy God
[1:27:16] I am with you
[1:27:17] I'll go with you wherever you go
[1:27:21] so we we understand that
[1:27:25] that
[1:27:27] the word is the thinking of God
[1:27:31] the thinking of God so and we see that
[1:27:37] the
[1:27:39] they
[1:27:40] were led by something
[1:27:44] and Leadership the prophet of God makes
[1:27:46] this statement he said the question is
[1:27:49] what are you led by now
[1:27:55] okay so we're led by our thinking
[1:28:01] that's why when we spoke a while back
[1:28:05] and and sometimes I look back on my
[1:28:08] sermons and I thought I began to
[1:28:10] understand while you were putting that
[1:28:12] together you were talking to me you know
[1:28:15] and and perception is not reality
[1:28:19] the word is reality
[1:28:21] perception is your thinking
[1:28:27] this is what you're thinking
[1:28:30] you're thinking it's this way you're
[1:28:33] thinking it's that way you're thinking
[1:28:36] this and you're thinking that and you've
[1:28:38] got all these thoughts boiling up
[1:28:43] and so that becomes how that you're LED
[1:28:50] and that was the question
[1:28:54] the question is what's leading you
[1:28:57] so something there's something out there
[1:29:00] that's being influenced
[1:29:04] and we know this story of of the Prophet
[1:29:09] going into the temple
[1:29:11] and and he runs into the temple and he
[1:29:14] was the friend of Uriah I believe it was
[1:29:16] right what was that prophet's name
[1:29:20] good enough for me
[1:29:23] so Isaiah goes in there right and he he
[1:29:25] goes in there and he was influenced by
[1:29:27] Uriah his Bible quiz my pop quiz out
[1:29:31] here
[1:29:32] it's okay and what did he prophesied he
[1:29:34] was influenced
[1:29:36] and then we heard the message the
[1:29:38] influence the message influence so he's
[1:29:42] trying to tell us his influence you know
[1:29:44] so we we
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:47] uh understand that there's a lot of
[1:29:51] things that influence our thinking
[1:29:54] and are our thinking is believe it or
[1:29:58] not what's leading you
[1:30:03] 've done what's going on in your mind is
[1:30:06] leading you now to tie that back in the
[1:30:09] greatest battle ever fought is the
[1:30:12] battle in your mind for your thinking
[1:30:19] it's not a battle outside of you between
[1:30:22] two great things we know that that
[1:30:25] there's a spiritual warfare right and
[1:30:28] he's the prince of the Aaron and so he's
[1:30:31] got control of the world and of the air
[1:30:36] and he controls that influence
[1:30:41] but God only controls one thing
[1:30:45] that's truth
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] do you understand he only controls one
[1:30:53] thing that's his thinking
[1:30:56] that's what he controls he controls the
[1:30:59] way that he thinks because he can't
[1:31:02] think outside of what that he is
[1:31:06] Hallelujah
[1:31:10] so he is his thinking
[1:31:13] he is his word
[1:31:16] you are caught in the middle right
[1:31:22] you came in the world speaking lies and
[1:31:25] God's been trying to get us to think the
[1:31:29] way he thinks
[1:31:34] that's his goal
[1:31:37] that's his purpose
[1:31:39] because once we do that
[1:31:43] things change
[1:31:45] though as I was looking at this because
[1:31:47] I want if you could
[1:31:49] uh
[1:31:52] uh
[1:31:57] I'd like to read this little statement
[1:32:00] first
[1:32:01] if I could out of thinking man's filter
[1:32:04] and
[1:32:05] if the brothers could uh
[1:32:08] maybe see if I can find that here I
[1:32:12] think it's paragraph
[1:32:14] uh
[1:32:17] 53.
[1:32:25] you know and I know there's in this
[1:32:28] message thinking men's filter there's a
[1:32:30] lot of things
[1:32:32] you understand I am not capable it would
[1:32:35] take me a lifetime to preach
[1:32:39] what brother Brown put in one message
[1:32:42] because it's spiritual food in due
[1:32:45] season
[1:32:46] I believe that this message can these
[1:32:49] this is one of the last messages that
[1:32:51] brother Branham preached in 1960 uh
[1:32:55] August of 1965. I think it's the 22nd so
[1:33:00] I believe that he knows it's coming to
[1:33:02] the end I I loved how brother bisco
[1:33:04] brought that out and he focused on the
[1:33:07] last five messages but I I just stepped
[1:33:10] back a little bit and I said this is
[1:33:12] something he's trying to get to us this
[1:33:14] is something he's trying to get to us he
[1:33:17] knows that we've got to grab grasp this
[1:33:22] in order to move into that perfection
[1:33:26] and so listen to this story
[1:33:30] um
[1:33:31] and I'll try to read it and we'll just
[1:33:33] go through this study are you okay this
[1:33:35] morning hey amen so uh you know I I wish
[1:33:40] we were a mega church and when you got
[1:33:41] tired you could go to the coffee bar and
[1:33:44] get a cup of coffee and maybe get a
[1:33:46] sandwich and come back in and sit in
[1:33:49] church and everything you know but I I'd
[1:33:54] rather be a place where the word is
[1:33:57] he said
[1:33:59] a young fellow was telling me the other
[1:34:02] day
[1:34:03] that he was down to an army camp
[1:34:07] a young Soldier got run over by a tank
[1:34:12] his lungs his stomach
[1:34:16] or whatever it was punctured
[1:34:19] and they went up to the hospital
[1:34:22] they had three or four doctors standing
[1:34:25] there in line and everybody's standing
[1:34:29] in line and two or three soldiers
[1:34:32] holding their buddy up and him just
[1:34:36] barely could breathe every time he every
[1:34:40] time he'd breathe that rib would stick
[1:34:44] right into his lung
[1:34:46] and that would make him bleed inwardly
[1:34:49] and they let that young man stand there
[1:34:54] in that line way back in the back of the
[1:34:59] line and and let them some of them guys
[1:35:02] with nothing but a earache or something
[1:35:06] go ahead
[1:35:09] no I got a point here if the Lord will
[1:35:11] help me
[1:35:14] but about that time he got up there some
[1:35:18] Colonel come in with a little child that
[1:35:22] had a rash
[1:35:24] his little boy or girl had a rash on his
[1:35:27] hand and they stopped that line and put
[1:35:30] that Colonel's child in and that boy
[1:35:33] punctured dying there you are
[1:35:37] oh if that Colonel would have been a
[1:35:41] genuine feeling for his brother out
[1:35:45] there in the line he would have said
[1:35:48] that kid can't wait give that man up
[1:35:52] here quickly do something for him but
[1:35:56] every man wants to show his authority
[1:36:01] now they're not all like that no they're
[1:36:05] not all like that but there's too many
[1:36:08] like that
[1:36:10] there's too many of them that's like
[1:36:12] that but the man only one thing he was
[1:36:17] thinking of was his own little
[1:36:20] boy that had a rash on his hand
[1:36:24] and not thinking about the poor boy
[1:36:28] standing there mashed under a tank
[1:36:32] the very tank that might be
[1:36:35] be the very boy that would save his life
[1:36:39] someday on the battlefield see they
[1:36:43] don't stop to think only for themselves
[1:36:49] and when I read that it struck me and he
[1:36:53] says they don't
[1:36:55] stop to think
[1:36:58] that man's thinking was wrong
[1:37:03] I'm a colonel
[1:37:07] my cut you know I got things to do I'm
[1:37:09] busy I can't be wasting time you know
[1:37:12] what I mean he we I don't know all the
[1:37:15] background to the story why he rushed up
[1:37:18] there and everything but he said he
[1:37:20] wasn't thinking his thinking wasn't
[1:37:22] right
[1:37:24] and
[1:37:27] when that struck me in my heart I began
[1:37:32] to to understand a little bit more uh
[1:37:38] why that message leadership
[1:37:42] was so impressed upon my heart
[1:37:46] so he points out he's going to preach to
[1:37:49] this whole
[1:37:50] sermon now about thinking man's filter
[1:37:53] and we'll touch on it but what drove him
[1:37:57] to that wasn't only the cigarette pack
[1:38:02] but it caused him to realize
[1:38:07] in this message that what he was
[1:38:10] addressing was people with wrong
[1:38:14] thinking
[1:38:18] they don't discern the situation
[1:38:23] they
[1:38:25] don't stop
[1:38:27] and think
[1:38:29] and ask themselves what's really going
[1:38:32] on here
[1:38:35] people are way too quick to get in a
[1:38:39] huff
[1:38:40] and a puff
[1:38:44] and we understand that he also addressed
[1:38:48] this to us in the message letting off
[1:38:51] the pressure
[1:38:53] causes people to do things that they
[1:38:56] normally wouldn't do but we don't stop
[1:39:00] and get our composure
[1:39:06] and ask ourselves what's leading me
[1:39:13] what kind of thinking
[1:39:16] is going on in my mind
[1:39:19] that's causing me to make this decision
[1:39:25] I remember one time a man came to me and
[1:39:27] he said to me he said Brother David I've
[1:39:29] been blessed here I've got Revelation
[1:39:32] here I found my wife here my kids got
[1:39:36] baptized here he says but I've never
[1:39:38] made
[1:39:40] a lot of money here
[1:39:46] okay
[1:39:47] he said I got an opportunity for a good
[1:39:50] job I'm going to go out and take it
[1:39:52] because I want to be financially blessed
[1:39:59] none of his family serving the lord
[1:40:05] but you understand
[1:40:08] that was caused
[1:40:13] by the thinking
[1:40:16] that entered into his mind
[1:40:21] just like sickness
[1:40:24] sickness comes sickness isn't the
[1:40:27] problem
[1:40:28] it's the thinking that comes with
[1:40:31] sickness
[1:40:32] oh this is going to kill me oh I'm going
[1:40:35] to be sick oh I've got to be in fear oh
[1:40:38] I sinned
[1:40:40] or if we could get his thinking we would
[1:40:43] say Satan
[1:40:47] all sickness is of the devil
[1:40:51] it isn't the sickness that's the problem
[1:40:54] it's the thinking that comes with it
[1:41:00] that's right that's what's got to be
[1:41:03] washed
[1:41:09] he says the thinking was wrong
[1:41:13] and Coke in this
[1:41:16] sermon if they could say I begin to see
[1:41:20] that that this great thought that our
[1:41:24] messenger have is carrying over into all
[1:41:28] these sermons
[1:41:29] the rapture remarkable about the Rapture
[1:41:32] the thing that we when we preach that it
[1:41:35] was understanding we've got to have what
[1:41:37] on our mind
[1:41:40] the rapture it's all about the rapture
[1:41:45] well what's keeping us
[1:41:49] from obtaining
[1:41:51] the character
[1:41:55] that we need to
[1:41:58] go into that other dimension
[1:42:01] because you're going to leave everything
[1:42:03] else here but your character
[1:42:09] your character is determined
[1:42:13] by your thinking
[1:42:15] humility is not the way you act
[1:42:19] it's the way you think
[1:42:23] you can fake humility you can be all
[1:42:26] Meek and humble but you just think you
[1:42:29] know I'm so meek
[1:42:30] I'm so humble
[1:42:32] I've got the sweetest spirit
[1:42:35] you know I'm just you know
[1:42:39] if they had Saints in the message
[1:42:42] I'd be I'd be seated
[1:42:46] you know everybody they ought to look to
[1:42:49] me for an example oh how are you brother
[1:42:54] oh Lord bless you
[1:42:57] and in my heart I'm going this poor
[1:42:59] sorry guy he thinks he's a preacher
[1:43:04] oh you don't think Jesus addressed that
[1:43:07] right with their lips they worship me
[1:43:11] but their hearts
[1:43:13] what is your heart
[1:43:15] your their thinking is far from me
[1:43:20] so he he's addressing this so so let's
[1:43:24] just read these few quotes if you would
[1:43:26] paragraph 129 of
[1:43:29] leadership
[1:43:33] I'm trying to I'm trying to this morning
[1:43:35] take the time to bring this down to you
[1:43:40] where you will start looking at
[1:43:46] and understand that you've got to
[1:43:51] look at your thinking
[1:43:54] the Bible is not a set of binoculars
[1:43:59] it's a mirror
[1:44:04] it's a mirror
[1:44:06] it's not a binocular the Bible and the
[1:44:09] message to us has become a set of
[1:44:12] binoculars
[1:44:15] for for some people they use it to hunt
[1:44:18] fault
[1:44:21] or doctrine
[1:44:25] what do you believe
[1:44:27] I mean you know what I mean
[1:44:30] forget it
[1:44:32] what is it to you if they tarry till I
[1:44:35] come
[1:44:36] what was Jesus trying to do
[1:44:39] hey guys
[1:44:41] you're thinking wrong
[1:44:45] you're thinking your thinking's not
[1:44:47] right what is it to you what if he does
[1:44:50] this but he says wait a minute everybody
[1:44:52] stop thinking this way that's the wrong
[1:44:55] thinking what is it to you if he tarries
[1:44:59] till I come you follow me
[1:45:05] and now in leadership
[1:45:09] what's he talking about leadership
[1:45:12] so can you imagine as holy As You Are
[1:45:15] as believing as you are as spiritual as
[1:45:20] you are you can have something that's
[1:45:23] leading you
[1:45:26] you could dress it up with religion
[1:45:29] you can put a message code on it
[1:45:33] you could have you can compare yourself
[1:45:35] with everybody and everything's fine and
[1:45:40] still
[1:45:42] be led by the angel of Light
[1:45:49] oh
[1:45:50] you heard me right the angel of Light
[1:45:54] Satan appears as an angel
[1:45:57] of light
[1:46:00] not the boogeyman Darkness guy
[1:46:03] with the Pitchfork
[1:46:06] he's subtle
[1:46:08] surely
[1:46:11] you won't die
[1:46:15] what did he do
[1:46:19] the Lord said the day I eat thereof
[1:46:22] the Dale idea surely you won't die what
[1:46:26] did he Institute
[1:46:28] reasoning reasoning is a form of what
[1:46:32] thinking
[1:46:36] so every time that you come in contact
[1:46:40] with the word
[1:46:43] there is a process that
[1:46:47] automatically starts whether you like it
[1:46:51] or not
[1:46:58] you know
[1:47:00] can just
[1:47:02] the way it is
[1:47:05] he uses the same tactic that he uses
[1:47:10] if it worked on a daughter of God
[1:47:13] don't you think he thinks it'll work on
[1:47:15] you
[1:47:19] the Willing ignorance
[1:47:24] to
[1:47:26] for whatever reason
[1:47:29] to set aside the word of God
[1:47:34] and take our own thinking
[1:47:39] so we have this great story here
[1:47:46] and we know that the boy came up to him
[1:47:48] and said good master
[1:47:51] notice he believed there was something
[1:47:53] different than what he had
[1:47:56] or he would have never said
[1:47:59] good Master what must I do now
[1:48:04] that's paragraph 129 in the message uh
[1:48:10] uh leadership and I believe that was
[1:48:14] preached in
[1:48:16] see if we can find it here
[1:48:18] I I I'd like to see if they could put
[1:48:21] this up there for you
[1:48:23] um
[1:48:26] okay it's on I think it's on the cover
[1:48:28] isn't it so I'm sure it's in
[1:48:32] okay so it's uh
[1:48:37] 1207. so paragraph 129 if they get up
[1:48:41] there oh he had never said good Master
[1:48:44] what must I do now see he wanted to do
[1:48:47] something himself
[1:48:50] that's the way we do we want to do
[1:48:54] something ourselves now so
[1:48:59] that's a thinking
[1:49:02] he was thinking what must I do
[1:49:07] to inherit eternal life
[1:49:10] do you understand the thinking
[1:49:14] see he didn't look at the way he was
[1:49:16] thinking
[1:49:17] sometimes we don't look at the way we're
[1:49:20] thinking we're thinking it and just
[1:49:23] because it's our thoughts we think that
[1:49:26] it's got some truth to it
[1:49:31] you understand when I say Amen who is
[1:49:33] the biggest I'm the biggest deceiver of
[1:49:36] myself I'm My Own Worst Enemy
[1:49:42] right just because I'm thinking it don't
[1:49:45] make it right
[1:49:50] and even if something's right it doesn't
[1:49:53] mean my thinking about it's correct
[1:50:02] what must I do you see how beautifully
[1:50:05] the messenger lays that in there what
[1:50:08] must I do
[1:50:10] what must I do
[1:50:12] oh what a question
[1:50:14] see he wanted to do something to self
[1:50:16] that's the way we do we want to do
[1:50:19] something ourselves the gifts of God is
[1:50:23] a free gift
[1:50:24] God give it to you you don't do one
[1:50:28] thing for it he ordained it to you and
[1:50:34] you're going to have it see Hallelujah
[1:50:40] notice
[1:50:43] he knew it was there
[1:50:45] he believed in it
[1:50:48] and wanted it
[1:50:50] but when he confronted confronted with
[1:50:54] how he had to do it
[1:50:58] it was different from his ritual
[1:51:02] now he's confronted with something
[1:51:04] what's he being confronted with a
[1:51:07] different way
[1:51:10] of thinking
[1:51:13] it was different
[1:51:19] you think that if God's Gonna deal with
[1:51:22] you
[1:51:23] he's going to give you the same old
[1:51:25] thing
[1:51:30] after you've heard the message over and
[1:51:32] over again as the eagle stirth his nest
[1:51:36] how he makes the nest uncomfortable how
[1:51:39] he blows all the feathers to get you out
[1:51:42] of it after you've heard the teaching
[1:51:44] over and over again about the Potter and
[1:51:47] the clay and how he breaks it down
[1:51:53] how we've got real comfortable
[1:51:56] in our religion
[1:51:58] comparing ourselves one for another just
[1:52:01] dressing ourselves up into the message
[1:52:03] he says when God deals with you it's
[1:52:07] going to be something
[1:52:10] different
[1:52:14] different than where you are
[1:52:18] right he's not interested in putting
[1:52:21] makeup on your condition
[1:52:27] he's interested in what
[1:52:30] washing you
[1:52:33] taking the wrinkle out
[1:52:36] the car runs fine but it's got a wrinkle
[1:52:40] in it
[1:52:42] it's got a blemish on it
[1:52:46] he's not condemning you he's perfecting
[1:52:50] you
[1:52:56] and he's trying to tell us stop
[1:53:01] stop and think
[1:53:03] everybody stop a moment
[1:53:06] look at yourself look at your mind look
[1:53:09] at your life
[1:53:11] just don't take everything that comes in
[1:53:21] he can hold his money and belong to the
[1:53:25] church that he belonged to and so forth
[1:53:29] but Jesus knew that
[1:53:32] he knew that he had hoarded his money
[1:53:35] and he said go sell all you got and give
[1:53:40] it to the poor and come take up your
[1:53:43] cross and follow me and you'll have
[1:53:46] Treasures in Heaven
[1:53:50] what
[1:53:53] he approached
[1:53:56] he knew how he thought
[1:53:59] he knew how he was thinking
[1:54:02] do you understand so what did he
[1:54:05] approach he approached the thinking he
[1:54:08] didn't approach the riches
[1:54:10] I don't know how the story would go if
[1:54:14] he would have said master
[1:54:16] I'll put it all up for sale tomorrow
[1:54:20] Jesus might have said you don't have to
[1:54:22] do that
[1:54:23] you go be a Shining Light you give your
[1:54:27] ties to the temple you support the work
[1:54:29] you don't know what the outcome of that
[1:54:31] would be
[1:54:33] that's our problem
[1:54:42] we pre-plan the outcome of things in our
[1:54:45] mind
[1:54:48] we prejudge people
[1:54:53] we prejudge circumstances
[1:54:55] we we got somehow there's a part of us
[1:54:59] that we feel we've got to figure it out
[1:55:07] I've been led to do something that I
[1:55:09] just don't make no sense to me
[1:55:13] in the light of everything that's going
[1:55:15] on but I knew God told me to do it he's
[1:55:18] got a reason
[1:55:22] so you're better off
[1:55:24] ditching you're thinking
[1:55:27] let's just read this real quick
[1:55:31] he said he said but he couldn't do it
[1:55:36] the other leaders that he had in his
[1:55:40] youthful days had such an influence on
[1:55:44] him till he refused to accept God's
[1:55:48] provided way which was Jesus Christ
[1:55:52] the only one who holds eternal life the
[1:55:56] only one that can give you it not the
[1:56:00] church can give you eternal life not
[1:56:04] your neighbor not your pastor not your
[1:56:06] priest not your Creed only Jesus himself
[1:56:10] can give you eternal life
[1:56:13] no matter how good you are
[1:56:17] what you quit doing
[1:56:20] what you start doing you've got to
[1:56:23] accept the person
[1:56:26] of Jesus Christ
[1:56:28] and then when you do that his word and
[1:56:33] then your life fits right in the word
[1:56:37] and it manifests itself
[1:56:40] to this age that you're living in
[1:56:44] this theme is really not a new theme but
[1:56:48] it's something that's become so common
[1:56:51] that we don't recognize that it's
[1:56:55] happening in US
[1:56:58] we've got binoculars instead of mirrors
[1:57:02] let this mind be in you that was in
[1:57:06] Christ
[1:57:12] right
[1:57:16] right but is it
[1:57:18] no because you've got to go through the
[1:57:22] battle
[1:57:25] to get the thinking
[1:57:29] you've got to go through the reasoning
[1:57:31] you've got to look at the situation
[1:57:33] you've got to get what oh I'm just
[1:57:37] preaching you Leaf if you want
[1:57:40] you got the five senses you've got the
[1:57:43] five inward census right you those are
[1:57:46] all speaking to you they're all
[1:57:48] influencing you you've got the past
[1:57:50] you've got all these different things
[1:57:52] now you're confronted with something you
[1:57:55] just don't say oh let this mind be in me
[1:57:57] that was in Christ Hallelujah I'm going
[1:57:59] to go do a good work
[1:58:02] ah
[1:58:06] you've got to take the
[1:58:08] kingdom of God by force
[1:58:13] you've got to fight the reasoning you've
[1:58:15] got to fight the emotions you've got to
[1:58:17] fight the feelings
[1:58:19] oh I'm just gonna go here
[1:58:23] prophet of God said I'm just gonna go
[1:58:25] live in the mountains
[1:58:26] I'm going to get a message from God I'm
[1:58:28] going to come out of the woods and yeah
[1:58:33] great thinking
[1:58:35] you don't think he battled through that
[1:58:38] sure he did he battled through it oh Dad
[1:58:41] look that looks like you and and Banks
[1:58:44] or whoever it was he said you know oh
[1:58:46] yeah that looks great to me
[1:58:50] in the Lord he got the
[1:58:52] DNA yeah go ahead lose your family lose
[1:58:55] your church lose all this he had to go
[1:58:58] through the battle
[1:59:01] the battles for the thinking
[1:59:05] it's not the discernment of this is
[1:59:08] right and this is wrong it's not what
[1:59:11] you do or you don't do or what you start
[1:59:15] doing
[1:59:18] there's a process that's working in
[1:59:22] every single one of us
[1:59:25] and it goes on daily
[1:59:27] it's worse than this age than it's ever
[1:59:30] been because there's so many outlets so
[1:59:33] many inlets so much poisoning so much
[1:59:36] things so much stuff you're getting
[1:59:38] in fact they're trying to get it to
[1:59:40] where you can't even use your mind
[1:59:45] pretty soon when you're gonna talk
[1:59:47] you're gonna sound like Google
[1:59:54] you're just going to spout out some
[1:59:56] Wikipedia definition
[1:59:59] [Music]
[2:00:01] you know
[2:00:02] hey
[2:00:04] you might you ever hear the expression
[2:00:07] you're fighting for your lives
[2:00:09] you're thinking
[2:00:11] for your lives today
[2:00:16] you're thinking for
[2:00:19] your lives
[2:00:26] so much of the scripture
[2:00:29] was was given
[2:00:32] so we looked at what did he think he
[2:00:34] says oh look at his thought process I
[2:00:37] have a lot
[2:00:38] what will I do
[2:00:40] he says come follow me where are we
[2:00:43] going what would I do where is he
[2:00:46] leading me
[2:00:48] I remember well fellow came to me one
[2:00:50] time he says I feel led to go to these
[2:00:52] meetings in such and such place
[2:00:54] said praise God
[2:00:57] then he said but if I don't get a ride I
[2:00:59] feel led to go here
[2:01:01] yeah
[2:01:02] so wait a minute
[2:01:05] if God led me to go to these meetings
[2:01:08] I'd walk
[2:01:12] I'd start out walking
[2:01:15] I'd gone to that meeting and I get
[2:01:17] thinking on God's word I hope I would do
[2:01:19] this
[2:01:21] okay you know what I'm saying I'm just
[2:01:22] being honest with you because I want you
[2:01:25] to catch this this morning but wouldn't
[2:01:28] it let's put it this way wouldn't it be
[2:01:29] Babel God told me to go to this meetings
[2:01:31] I'm just going to start walking I feel
[2:01:34] led of the Lord and it just get
[2:01:36] meditating on Philip
[2:01:38] get in that realm of God's word God you
[2:01:41] can transport me to this meeting if it's
[2:01:43] your will your word doesn't fail you
[2:01:46] will perform your word get a different
[2:01:49] thinking going
[2:01:51] and different things will happen the
[2:01:54] reason we got the same problems over and
[2:01:56] over again is because we're set right
[2:02:00] in a Channel of religious thinking
[2:02:05] and we're using the message to sugarcoat
[2:02:08] our thoughts
[2:02:11] I hope that wasn't too strong
[2:02:15] but you know what will people think
[2:02:18] you know
[2:02:19] look you know
[2:02:22] what if it's wrong
[2:02:27] that's what's happened to a lot of
[2:02:28] people
[2:02:30] what if the message is wrong
[2:02:32] oh let that little bug get started in
[2:02:35] your ear
[2:02:37] let that thinking go
[2:02:40] well you know it was a rocket ship and
[2:02:44] you know
[2:02:45] every kind of unbelieving excuse
[2:02:50] that comes on
[2:02:52] let some other thinking go on
[2:02:54] but there's a lot of thinking in our
[2:02:58] lives
[2:03:00] about a lot of things
[2:03:03] that he's trying to change
[2:03:06] and I'll try to close quickly now
[2:03:09] I think
[2:03:11] but
[2:03:12] you look at
[2:03:14] the in
[2:03:16] Luke
[2:03:17] the 10th chapter
[2:03:20] of Luke
[2:03:23] I'm sure many of you
[2:03:25] know this great story
[2:03:34] the disciples had just come back
[2:03:37] Jesus had sent them out in twos
[2:03:40] and they
[2:03:42] they
[2:03:43] went out
[2:03:45] and they
[2:03:47] had
[2:03:48] done what Jesus said
[2:03:52] they prayed for the sick and people got
[2:03:54] well they told the news about the
[2:03:57] Messiah being there they preached the
[2:03:59] gospel that they had learned the
[2:04:01] Revelation they had of who they were
[2:04:03] following and and they had great signs
[2:04:06] and wonders a great meeting
[2:04:08] m
[2:04:10] M and and they came back and he said
[2:04:14] I beheld Satan has lightning falling
[2:04:17] from heaven
[2:04:19] behold I gave unto you power to tread on
[2:04:22] serpents and scorpions and overall power
[2:04:25] of the enemy and None Shall be
[2:04:31] any means hurt you notwithstanding
[2:04:36] in this Rejoice not
[2:04:41] now
[2:04:43] what is he addressing
[2:04:46] he's addressing the state of mind and
[2:04:51] the thinking that they're in
[2:04:54] now let me move this to another level
[2:04:59] State of Mind
[2:05:05] when your mind gets in a certain state
[2:05:10] then you look
[2:05:12] and your thinking comes from the state
[2:05:15] of mind you're in
[2:05:19] another terminology a lot of times for
[2:05:23] state of mind is complex
[2:05:29] if you don't careful you view your whole
[2:05:31] life through a complex
[2:05:36] everything you think is based on your
[2:05:38] complex your inability how you what you
[2:05:41] feel about yourself you feel you're a
[2:05:43] failure every bit of that's a lie right
[2:05:47] right
[2:05:49] because it's not what he said
[2:05:58] so he said don't rejoice in that he says
[2:06:01] because but rather Rejoice because your
[2:06:06] names are written in heaven
[2:06:11] now
[2:06:13] that is
[2:06:17] the key if I could say that to
[2:06:22] to uh
[2:06:25] the key to
[2:06:28] a believer
[2:06:30] is is
[2:06:33] when that they can look look at he says
[2:06:38] he says and this is in page 171 of think
[2:06:42] you meant filthy he says Israel was all
[2:06:44] outwardly spiritual all filled with
[2:06:47] God's goodness
[2:06:48] and how they reverence God and so forth
[2:06:51] but that didn't work the inside of them
[2:06:55] couldn't recognize the word itself
[2:06:57] but when you're born of the spirit of
[2:06:59] God then you've got
[2:07:02] you've got you are a son of God
[2:07:07] you always was a Son of God and you'll
[2:07:11] always be a Son of God no way to
[2:07:15] separate it because you have eternal
[2:07:17] life and eternal life never did begin
[2:07:21] neither will it end you understand what
[2:07:24] Jesus is giving him to is the key
[2:07:28] of thinking
[2:07:32] he said don't Rejoice because of these
[2:07:34] signs and wonders and I'm telling you
[2:07:37] the church has got to the place where
[2:07:39] they're rejoicing in signs and wonders
[2:07:42] instead of rejoicing that their name is
[2:07:46] written in heaven
[2:07:49] so he's giving them the key to thinking
[2:07:54] once you can get this key thought
[2:07:58] in your mind
[2:08:00] you will approach every other thing
[2:08:04] through that state of mind
[2:08:07] yeah
[2:08:09] but if he can keep you from embracing
[2:08:12] that
[2:08:13] accepting your election
[2:08:16] keep you from absolutely understanding
[2:08:19] by a shadow of a doubt I am
[2:08:24] a child of God regardless
[2:08:29] I was birthed by him in the beginning I
[2:08:33] have eternal life it's eternal life it
[2:08:36] always was it always will be it was his
[2:08:39] thinking
[2:08:45] now you're anchored amen
[2:08:49] now your State of Mind changes
[2:08:53] if you're still a sinner's trying to
[2:08:56] struggle to get to heaven
[2:08:58] I hope you make it
[2:09:03] it's not a very happy life
[2:09:09] and you'll be judged for your works
[2:09:13] and if your works are consumed by fire
[2:09:17] you will be saved by fire
[2:09:21] but oh
[2:09:23] if I could get this mind in me
[2:09:30] if I could get this fine to me this is
[2:09:32] what Jesus says listen listen to this
[2:09:35] this morning
[2:09:37] in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit
[2:09:40] and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[2:09:43] Heaven and Earth
[2:09:46] that thou has hid these things from the
[2:09:49] wise and prudent and hath
[2:09:53] revealed them unto babes even so father
[2:09:59] for it seemed good
[2:10:03] in thy sight
[2:10:05] and all things are delivered to me of my
[2:10:09] father and no man knoweth who the son is
[2:10:13] but the father
[2:10:16] whom
[2:10:17] and who the father is but the son for he
[2:10:23] to whom the son will reveal him
[2:10:34] if I could
[2:10:36] if I know that he the Pete revealed them
[2:10:39] to me
[2:10:41] I'm now starting
[2:10:45] at the first step of the Statue of a
[2:10:48] perfect man
[2:10:50] we've been trying to build the Statue of
[2:10:52] a perfect man having got our thinking
[2:10:54] down right
[2:10:58] we're just adding all kinds of stuff
[2:11:01] now we finally come to the end
[2:11:03] of our roads
[2:11:08] and we're not who we say we are
[2:11:14] no we could fake everybody out
[2:11:17] but it's not our actions
[2:11:20] it's not the way we dress
[2:11:25] it's not what we believe
[2:11:27] it's the way we think
[2:11:30] stop a moment
[2:11:33] ask yourself what state of mind am I in
[2:11:36] how am I thinking
[2:11:40] am I looking at this like a Christian am
[2:11:42] I feeling what are these feelings I'm
[2:11:44] having stop a moment those feelings
[2:11:46] don't rule you there's one thing that
[2:11:49] rules you and that's God's word you're
[2:11:52] elected you're chosen your name's
[2:11:54] written in heaven stop you've got access
[2:11:57] to the word of God it's been given to
[2:12:01] you to so you can think by it
[2:12:06] heaven even the world said as a as a man
[2:12:10] thinketh so he is
[2:12:14] that a scripture yes
[2:12:16] yes good
[2:12:17] the world needs it
[2:12:22] think of that
[2:12:24] as a man thinketh
[2:12:28] what do you think he's after
[2:12:32] he's after your minds
[2:12:36] the right mental attitude towards any
[2:12:40] promise of God will bring it to Bath
[2:12:42] don't condemn yourselves
[2:12:46] stop a moment
[2:12:48] how am I thinking
[2:12:51] how am I thinking am I thinking through
[2:12:55] the word
[2:12:58] I can't finish there's so much unfolding
[2:13:01] that I'll just
[2:13:03] I'll just close
[2:13:06] maybe I can
[2:13:08] maybe the Rapture will come I don't have
[2:13:10] to pick this up ever again
[2:13:17] where was I Luke 10 I believe right
[2:13:20] okay he says in Jesus rejoiced and let
[2:13:25] me reveal them and he turned unto his
[2:13:29] disciples and said privately blessed are
[2:13:33] the eyes which see the things that ye
[2:13:37] see
[2:13:41] what's he trying to get to him
[2:13:44] he's trying to get to their thinking
[2:13:46] blessed are you for the things you've
[2:13:49] seen may I say this to you this morning
[2:13:51] blessed are ye for the things you've
[2:13:55] seen
[2:13:59] at least you've seen it
[2:14:11] for I tell you that many prophets and
[2:14:14] Kings have desired to see those things
[2:14:16] which he see and have not seen them and
[2:14:20] to hear those things which ye hear and
[2:14:23] have not heard them
[2:14:25] have you ever thought of that
[2:14:31] this message isn't a burden
[2:14:33] it's the truth
[2:14:37] and you've got you've got to you've got
[2:14:39] to sit down
[2:14:41] and have a good look at your thinking
[2:14:43] and who's influencing you
[2:14:46] and what you're following
[2:14:51] and what your participation in
[2:14:57] you need to look at this church this
[2:14:59] body this ministry you got to look at it
[2:15:03] through God's word that's right
[2:15:15] now watch this and we're close and
[2:15:17] behold a certain lawyer stood up and
[2:15:20] tempted him saying Master what shall I
[2:15:23] do to inherit eternal life
[2:15:26] and he said in them what is written in
[2:15:29] the law
[2:15:30] how read us doubt
[2:15:34] and he answered and said Thou shalt love
[2:15:37] the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[2:15:40] and with all thy soul
[2:15:42] and with all thy strength and with all
[2:15:45] thy mind
[2:15:47] and thy neighbor as thyself
[2:15:50] and he said unto him thou hath answered
[2:15:54] right this do
[2:15:56] and thou shalt live
[2:16:01] wow
[2:16:07] but he willingly
[2:16:09] but he willing to justify himself
[2:16:13] said to Jesus and who is my neighbor
[2:16:19] Jesus answered and said a certain man
[2:16:22] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and
[2:16:26] fell among Thieves which stripped him of
[2:16:29] his reign of it and wounded him and
[2:16:33] departed leaving him half dead
[2:16:36] and by chance there came down a certain
[2:16:40] priest that way and when he saw him he
[2:16:44] passed by on the other side
[2:16:47] what was he thinking
[2:16:50] and likewise a levite
[2:16:52] when he was at the place came and looked
[2:16:57] on him and passed by on the other side
[2:17:01] but a certain Samaritan as he Journey
[2:17:05] came where he was
[2:17:07] and when he saw him he had compassion on
[2:17:12] him
[2:17:13] and he went
[2:17:14] to him and bound up his wounds
[2:17:18] poured the oil and wine and set him
[2:17:23] on his own beast and brought him to an
[2:17:27] inn and took care of him
[2:17:33] and on the morrow when he departed he
[2:17:37] took out two pins
[2:17:39] and gave them to the host and said unto
[2:17:42] him take care of him and whatever thou
[2:17:45] spendeth more when I come again I will
[2:17:49] repay thee which of these three
[2:17:54] think is thou
[2:17:56] was neighbor unto him that fell
[2:18:02] Amongst Thieves
[2:18:05] what is he addressing here
[2:18:10] he's addressing their thinking
[2:18:15] now
[2:18:17] just to make this clear when I read my
[2:18:19] last quote
[2:18:23] is
[2:18:24] this is what God's asking you
[2:18:27] this morning
[2:18:30] or if I could say this
[2:18:32] instructing us
[2:18:35] or telling us it's time
[2:18:39] Church
[2:18:40] it's time
[2:18:44] to ask yourself what are you thinking
[2:18:50] how are you thinking
[2:18:54] where's your thinking coming from
[2:18:58] it's almost like we're standing right on
[2:19:01] the verge of going into the Capstone
[2:19:05] which I'm longing for
[2:19:08] the love of God being shed abroad in our
[2:19:11] hearts by the Holy Spirit and it's like
[2:19:14] the spirit saying Church
[2:19:17] you've got a wrinkle
[2:19:22] your wrinkle is the way you think about
[2:19:25] stuff
[2:19:27] it's how you gossip
[2:19:34] how we tell everybody else's business
[2:19:41] oh you know such and such as they got in
[2:19:44] trouble and did you know got a ticket
[2:19:46] and
[2:19:48] you know
[2:19:50] every time I come to church I dread me
[2:19:53] being pulled over on the side of the
[2:19:55] road and everybody come by
[2:20:02] I got a ticket
[2:20:04] so what
[2:20:08] I'll get an attorney
[2:20:12] I'll go to defensive driving
[2:20:15] I'll pay more for my insurance
[2:20:18] it's not the end of my life
[2:20:26] which one of you
[2:20:29] can cast the first stone
[2:20:34] we don't think
[2:20:37] we don't we we we we we just don't go
[2:20:43] through the thinking process
[2:20:46] and like that's the you know then Jesus
[2:20:49] said you know in Matthew 22 21 they said
[2:20:54] who's what about paying taxes
[2:20:57] look at how he changed their thinking
[2:21:00] Render unto Caesar the things that are
[2:21:02] Caesar's to God the things that are God
[2:21:05] you know in John
[2:21:08] us 8-7 he they were all getting a stoner
[2:21:12] he sat down he says which of you that
[2:21:15] have sinned not let the one who's never
[2:21:17] sinned cast the first stone
[2:21:20] what's he doing
[2:21:23] hit everything that Jesus did he did
[2:21:26] nothing
[2:21:28] until he had the mind of the Lord
[2:21:32] we can't go on
[2:21:35] this morning
[2:21:37] we can't go on having these mind battles
[2:21:40] and not ending up
[2:21:44] with a word result
[2:21:48] we can't let frustrations
[2:21:51] we can't let perceptions
[2:21:53] we can't let things Jesus told if
[2:21:56] someone Smite you on the cheek turn the
[2:21:57] other
[2:22:01] to everything about what he preached
[2:22:05] was about trying to get a different
[2:22:08] mindset
[2:22:11] how can two walk together if they don't
[2:22:14] agree
[2:22:17] no can in the thinking men's filter
[2:22:19] brother Benson's a great amount of time
[2:22:21] about loving the world
[2:22:24] and the things of the world and I wanted
[2:22:27] to get into all that about the what
[2:22:29] draws you and how these emotions but
[2:22:32] it's all within that message but I'd
[2:22:35] like to just say this
[2:22:37] and as I read this closing remark
[2:22:41] and see if I can find it here
[2:22:45] and this is in paragraph
[2:22:48] 21.
[2:22:51] and he mentions Esau and Esau didn't
[2:22:55] think
[2:22:58] but
[2:23:00] this message is called thinking men's
[2:23:03] filter
[2:23:04] and if I could sum up the theme of this
[2:23:07] message what brother branham's trying to
[2:23:10] to grasp us to grasp is you've got to
[2:23:14] filter your thinking
[2:23:20] and he talks all about denominations how
[2:23:23] they filter to get a taste
[2:23:26] and he's telling the church he said you
[2:23:28] can't filter it you've got to use God's
[2:23:32] filter and it's God's filter is his word
[2:23:36] so we've come up through life we're
[2:23:39] facing so many circumstances the
[2:23:42] messenger leads us this message right at
[2:23:45] the end he's saying now you've got to
[2:23:48] learn
[2:23:51] or if I could say this not just learn it
[2:23:54] but you've got to come to the place
[2:23:58] where you're filtering every thought
[2:24:02] through the word
[2:24:06] if you don't you're gonna get a taste
[2:24:10] that's different
[2:24:16] so it's imperative
[2:24:19] that you understand there's a battle in
[2:24:23] your mind
[2:24:24] that you're going to draw thinking and
[2:24:28] conclusions and thoughts
[2:24:32] from your senses and from your emotions
[2:24:35] and from everything that's around you
[2:24:37] but you've got to stop
[2:24:41] and say I need to filter
[2:24:44] what is going on
[2:24:47] through the word of God
[2:24:50] I've got to filter my thinking through
[2:24:53] the word of God I've got to filter My
[2:24:55] Worship I've got to filter my Doctrine
[2:24:58] I've got to filter where I go to church
[2:25:00] I've got to filter my job I've got to
[2:25:04] filter everything
[2:25:08] through the word
[2:25:13] because I'll never reach perfection
[2:25:16] if I have imperfect thoughts
[2:25:24] and I'm never gonna become what I want
[2:25:27] to become when I act on my own thinking
[2:25:37] I so want my heart
[2:25:40] to be different
[2:25:44] I want I just want to think different
[2:25:50] I I don't want to be influenced I don't
[2:25:52] want to be pushed I don't want to I
[2:25:54] don't want to rest in a bank account I
[2:25:57] don't want to rest in a job I want to
[2:25:59] rest in the bosom of Abraham
[2:26:06] this is a condemnation
[2:26:09] this is trying to tell us this morning
[2:26:13] that we've come to the time
[2:26:17] we've come to the hour
[2:26:21] it's never been required of us
[2:26:24] until now
[2:26:29] but we're ready to make that next step
[2:26:34] and it's not going to happen by a
[2:26:36] worship service
[2:26:38] is not going to happen by tremendous
[2:26:40] preaching
[2:26:42] it's not going to happen by signs and
[2:26:45] wonders
[2:26:47] it's going to happen by the renewing of
[2:26:49] your mind
[2:26:52] by the washing of the water of the word
[2:26:57] that's how it's going to change when
[2:27:00] this mind that was in him becomes your
[2:27:04] mind when you start thinking the way he
[2:27:07] thinks you start looking the way he
[2:27:09] looks
[2:27:13] this is where we're at church
[2:27:17] and I'll stand here because I've got
[2:27:23] thus
[2:27:25] saith the Lord
[2:27:28] I'm going to read it
[2:27:30] go listen to it
[2:27:35] what are we thinking
[2:27:39] what do you think about your career I
[2:27:42] could I could just run hours and hours
[2:27:44] of how that brother Branham approached
[2:27:46] the ways he thinks but I'd like to close
[2:27:49] with this statement this morning
[2:27:52] the musicians can come
[2:28:02] the other Ram says I'm going to say
[2:28:04] something this is paragraph the
[2:28:06] statement right before it
[2:28:08] I'm going to say something as brother
[2:28:12] McCullough used to say
[2:28:15] listen to me
[2:28:19] when you come into this world
[2:28:22] you were born in sin
[2:28:24] you didn't even come with a Fighting
[2:28:28] Chance
[2:28:31] you were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[2:28:35] came to the world speaking lies
[2:28:38] within your own spirit
[2:28:42] the desire of sin
[2:28:44] a lover of sin because you were born in
[2:28:48] sin you didn't have a chance
[2:28:52] that was your mind
[2:28:55] but down inside of you
[2:28:58] somewhere
[2:29:01] here you come
[2:29:04] there was something in there that began
[2:29:07] to draw
[2:29:09] if you know
[2:29:11] it was something that told you there was
[2:29:15] a god somewhere
[2:29:17] and you read his word
[2:29:19] then you took the church
[2:29:23] you took their ideas
[2:29:25] when you were told better
[2:29:28] then you never used a thinking man's
[2:29:31] filter
[2:29:33] but when you use God's filter
[2:29:36] which is a thinking man's filter
[2:29:40] because all other filters will pass away
[2:29:44] but mine shall not
[2:29:47] and when you take God's filter and draw
[2:29:51] your life your desires if you draw your
[2:29:57] desires through God's filter a thinking
[2:30:01] man's filter there is nothing left but
[2:30:07] the Holy Ghost
[2:30:12] how many wants the Holy Ghost
[2:30:15] what good does it do to be anointed
[2:30:18] top of my
[2:30:20] mind if you still got a mind
[2:30:25] but if you'll draw your desires
[2:30:28] you're thinking
[2:30:29] everything through the filter of God's
[2:30:32] word
[2:30:34] there'll be nothing left
[2:30:38] but the Holy Ghost
[2:30:42] oh
[2:30:43] God
[2:30:45] [Music]
[2:30:48] let me start today
[2:30:54] when when someone
[2:30:57] says something to you
[2:31:01] just stop a moment
[2:31:05] what should I do here
[2:31:07] what's the word say
[2:31:10] how many of what the word says blessed
[2:31:12] are ye when you're reviled
[2:31:15] and reviled back
[2:31:18] how can I get that to be the Forefront
[2:31:22] in my thinking
[2:31:28] if you're compelled to give your coat
[2:31:31] give your cloak also
[2:31:36] Prophet God said always give someone the
[2:31:39] benefit of the doubt oh they didn't mean
[2:31:41] that
[2:31:44] [Music]
[2:31:45] we're trying to fix things
[2:31:49] trying to do things ourselves
[2:31:53] when it's so simple
[2:31:55] [Music]
[2:31:58] just
[2:32:00] let the word become your thinking
[2:32:04] he is the word
[2:32:06] if you think the way he thinks you are
[2:32:10] him
[2:32:14] [Music]
[2:32:15] isn't that what it's all about I want to
[2:32:18] be like Jesus
[2:32:23] I want to have the right heart
[2:32:25] I want to have the right spirit
[2:32:28] I want peace that's your path's
[2:32:30] understanding
