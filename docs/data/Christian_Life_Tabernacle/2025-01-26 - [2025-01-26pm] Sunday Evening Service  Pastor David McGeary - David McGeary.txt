it and share it and father spread it abroad the scripture says the love of God spread abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit father we ask that you'd bless us and lift us up in jesus' name we pray amen amen let's just read one scripture that's real uh we all know it by heart uh found in Hebrews and and because we're talking of faith we want to say but Faith but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and then he goes and explains by by this Faith all the things the men did father bless your word to us you may be seated this evening and so we just want just continue on just a a a little bit more about faith and we'll be probably uh uh speaking about it quite a bit and we're going to play a little portion of tape tonight this is almost small enough crowd to go get ice cream at uh at Andes I I was going to do that the other night when it was 10 degrees you all get a rain check for a warm night amen that it' be a blessed time for those of you that have come out and for all the you those that are listening at home uh you probably make sure you don't have one eye on the football game and one eye on the uh service you know be sold out one way or the other you can't serve two masters you know what I mean but uh uh we just trust that there's something real important uh tonight and I know some people have things that they need to be done but we want to talk a a little bit uh we're talking about faith and and the the perfect faith and and what it does for the believer and and so the first thing that we realize is that and just just think about this for a moment he says the truth of all life the truth of all life is God redeeming his children Back to Eden through Jesus Christ his son our kinsman redeemer that's the truth of all life all every every thing that's going on the truth of all life is is the father restoring us back to to the kingdom and it and there's no other truth outside of that and so no and that's what he said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away and so if if you understand that's the truth that's what set you free and that's what Jesus said I am the way the truth the life no man comes to the father but by me and and in another place he speaks what would a man give in exchange for his soul and what is it profiteth a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul so the the reality of what what our faith does and and and I I like that statement that uh we read that the the uh faith is I got to I was going to try to read it with one eye but I got to have four eyes it says it he says and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you without faith it it's impossible to please God and what and and and that God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so if I could say it like that a Believer is the faith the reward of God moving through you the reward of eternal life the reward W of Deliverance the Lord of blessings all those things in your life moving through your life Faith isn't a a a a list of dogmas and doctrines and and beliefs that's not faith faith is actually such a fundamental source of your life it moves and so there's a perfect faith and and I I I want to just and we want the faith because we're we're holding on uh we're holding on for uh a a Rapture that's what we're living for that's what we're believing for so we I want to talk about uh let me see if uh my perfect Faith here where are you all right so we I want to talk to this little thought and then we're going to play a little portion of tape uh to back it up so this morning we talked about the power is in you and we read scriptures so in other words when God created us he created us with the ability and the uh the capability and and and the uh ability to change the effect of things around us to change the course of events to to make changes in people's lives to influence the outcome and have a change the the the power to do that by faith and and that's what the Lord Jesus did when he came when he came up upon that the man that was uh bound with chains and and and full of demons he came up and he had the power to make a change in that man's life to have an effect on that man's life by by the word of God and and he he took those demons and he cast those demons out of that man's life and the power to was the ability and the capability of of having that done uh and I know we get in such a battle sometimes about well is it us doing it or is it God doing it and and we we do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens us the worlds were created by Him but in his creation and in his mind he saw you with this power that he put in you working you you understand so it's not an idea of who's getting credit for it that's what's messed everything up every anyway is man always trying to get credit for him it was my preaching and and I done this and and this is the great works of my hand and and look at all that I've done for the kingdom and and and it just is is just all so wrong because God had it all pre-planned from the beginning he knew the beginning from the end he knew he was going to give you the faith he knew that he was going to place the power in you and he knew that as you begin to hear the word of God that word of God would bring that Faith to life in you without the word faith comes from the word and the word alone if I could say it this way faith is the word faith is is what the word generates what's another word for Faith Revelation so when you see a promise and the promise is revealed to you the outcome of that promise is revealed to you then then and you you act on that promise then it the faith came from the word it was revealed to you now you act upon it you have the power in you to see that Revelation through all the way to its End Amen now let's we want to talk about Peter and we're just going to read this little bit and then listen to our tape and then we're going to have a baptism amen so I I just think that's that's wonderful uh uh uh sister a and uh Zan is going to get uh baptized so I think that's wonderful anyen we're looking at sis if I messed your name up you know I told you I could do stuff like that so but anyway it's just wonderful now we want to talk about Peter Peter heard the word of the Lord come walk on the water right who is it it's it's it's the Lord come and he says Lord if it be you bid me come right if it be you bid me come well it was him so he could only do one thing right is B him come isn't that what we did Lord if this is you bid us come if this is the truth bring me to you Lord so we've all asked the Lord and He bids us come so Peter he he started out he got out of the boat he said the L Lord told me to come he said but uh he said if but the Lord told me to do it he bid me come so he started walking and this I want to pick it up from here because we're trying to go a little place he said and he stepped down and said it's the Lord I'll just walk and when he got his eyes on the wave he got scared what come in his mind where's the battle in the mind so every time the word shows up the enemy shows up there's that's where the battle is the flesh Wars against the spirit a spirit against the Flesh and so he said what come in his mind first thing I'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk that was the first thing he says and the next thing he looked at his well he looked at his symptoms he looked out there and seen how big them waves was and he got got scared he looked at what is he doing I'm walking on water I'm not supposed to walk on water I'm not worthy to walk on water I'm not supposed to be able to walk on water nobody walks on water right you know what I mean the minut he started reasing it reason he tried to put some reality to it as as soon as he tried to put some common sense to it well what's the big thing now what what's the whole thing we're now are going to be a country of what common sense no we're not I ain't going to have no common sense common sense is for thing that people that expect common things I'm going to have Supernatural sense yes sir I'm going a believe for things that go Beyond Reason yes sir things that can't be figured out things that make no sense right so let just so see he said he began to look at all his circumstances all his situation all really what he was doing and you know but the Lord told them come that was what what his first thought he says and what and what he he said the waves and he got scared and when he did down he went see what he feared happened what he believed happened so if fear can produce a result Faith Can Pro produce a result just because fear challenges you and the circumstance challenges you and the situation challenges you and the doctors and the society and the government and everything challenges you that doesn't matter it's not the it's not the challenge you don't even you can't give any weight to the challenge you're get you've got to believe one thing or the other and Faith believes what God Said Peter's faith believ beli D that God told him to walk and so what he believed happened and then what he feared happened listen so he what he believed happened and and and what he feared happened what he believed happened he went when he believed he could walk he walked and when he believe and when and he believed he got scared in his belief now think of that just a moment he got scared about what he was believing and I I that just struck me so much because you know you believe for something Supernatural maybe a de healing or maybe somehow miraculously having a bless blessing come in your life and all of a sudden you get scared oh I'm believing for too much I'm believing for too big what what if it do doesn't happen uh maybe I shouldn't believe so big prophet of God said believe big ask big you know mean is anything too hard for God we have not because we asked not and we asked not but you understand he actually got scared in what he believed I wonder if that hadn't that hadn't happened to a lot of people in the message oh I'm believing God sent a prophet and there's supposed to be false prophets and I believe that's a pillar of fire and what happens if it's not the uh the pillar of fire and they actually get afraid of what they believe he got scared in what he believed oh I wish that I had words to express how that struck me maybe I shouldn't be believing for this maybe I shouldn't be believing that I get well maybe I shouldn't be believing that I I would like to have a family maybe I shouldn't be believing in this maybe I should all the odds all all the maybe I and they actually think get Fray afraid of what they're believing so we'll find something simpler to believe no believe big all things are possible he got scared in his belief then his substance left him see he still Pro professed his faith but he didn't have the substance the substance would have went right on over the top of that white cap and went right to him see if he had that perfect Faith see but but he didn't have it he thought he did he did it first and he was willing to venture right out why the Lord told me to do it it's got to happen so he just so he just stepped right out of the boat and to to and takes off he never thought of about the waves how contrary they was he never got that in his mind see his first reaction his first God said so he did it but then reasoning comes in then he thinks what did I ask that for oh I didn't consider about the waves wait a minute no man walks on water well no virgin can see D either but one did he never got that in his mind now when he you get to thinking well now wait and you know I've been sick a long time stop you just might as well go back to the boat see but when you quit thinking about that Abraham considered not his own body now now dead neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he didn't think about that didn't even consider it it wasn't even brought into the understand his understanding he didn't even consider that at all he just considered what God Said and he went on and as long as Peter did that he walked you understand where Faith's coming from now solely he said but Jesus lived in a world that no one know about he was a odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was and if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world people would wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you'd do what he forbid you you would not do then the people begin to say you'd be a Mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they're a Mystic they people don't understand because they live in a world to thems eles Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them they said they'd say this and then they'd say why why you talk in riddles we don't understand this how can how can this be see they they wasn't in the world that he was living in see they couldn't understand it nobody could understand him now this is what the Holy Spirit does it brings us into the world that he was living in that's right I will I will not I will not leave you comfortless but I personal pronoun will come again and I will be with you and I will be in you and now once you make that contact and that's what the prophet of God said you can believe something but every believer must have that personal contact and then once you have that personal contact and then you're in the world that he walked in otherwise you're on the outside believing it but you can never make it come to pass but when you have the Co contact of it that world becomes a reality to you now you can say I can walk in the world of divine action I can walk in the world where Supernatural things take place this can happen for me wait that's mystic the thinking that doesn't fit any of the latest scientific magazines it doesn't fit social culture it doesn't fit mathematics and education I don't care that's the world you live in I live in a world that God said so that settles it now to wrap this part of it up and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean the substance of Faith he is isolated from the entire world and from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ he's thinking different let this mind be in you that was in Christ he's joying errors every promise in the book is his it's not a mixture you understand it's not okay we know there's a God James said Satan believes in God and fears and trembles it's not believing that God is it's believing that everything that God is you are every promise is in the book of you everything that God has done or will do he can do for you everything you can look in the scripture every Bible story can become your story every character can live out that story in your life he said that that when when you get to that place he said there then there now you're getting you're getting into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor now de trustee that means for every ly every individual walks in a world with God Alone you're baptized into his kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God see he gives you orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere in you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right ahead on just the same and you you you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails he was a Mystic to he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so it is now now with those who have perfect Faith they Mystics to others amen no and and don't take this out that you say well I I I'm a Mystic to the world you know I walk in a world of our our own that's true but then you begin to understand that God Made You members in particular and then took all that he was and put it into action through other peoples through you what did when the disciples were endued with power from on high every one of them became Mystics right Peter has a vision he sees things comes down the spirit of God tells them to run over to cornelius's house or Simon the Tanner he's down there and he he comes out and he gets there and they said eat and he said oh don't touch that was clean and he he says then the holy spirit says that you can be baptized too it's all still for other people because the whole commission was to go into the world and preach the gospel the whole commission was go out and find my sheep what did he tell Peter feed my sheep feed my Lambs so it was all about putting and uniting this bride together so we see that this great faith and so Faith sees what God wants you to see Faith sees what God sees and and so you know we talk about speak the word now we're going to play this little portion of tape and and and I want to say this because this is from Ry cry speak you hear a lot of people and and it's been going on in this message for a long time speak the word speak the word and and remember speak the word is not some madeup word or some uh desire or wish it speak the word means speak the word not a word not a new word that's right you know it it it doesn't mean that oh I need a ride over to some place speak the word word speak a car into existence or or do this no you speak the word you stand back and say God I need this to done would you you can provide me away and now I'm going to wait for the manifestation of what that you promis the word you speak is the promised word you speak what God had said you speak the promise you speak what God sees you speak his word coming to pass faith is the word so this morning we talked about power and we talked about where it comes from and your position so I want to play out of this message why Christ speak and because I want you to know that God is wanting you to take the word and put it in action you're called for it and so out of why Christ speak he speaks this little lesson here and he starts this out if you have uh I I guess it might be a a a phone that you follow on or tablet or or what whatever it is the prophet of God makes this thing here he says and here they come to the place a little trial come up and Moses begins to cry what shall I do what did they do they ran into the Red Sea there's the Egyptians and Moses all of a sudden is lost for words he don't know what to do but he already knew what to do he was already told what to do and now the prophet of God wants to catch this lesson and the and and this is what the disciples lacked we heard this morning imp perfect Faith they they fail to know their position and their calling so just listen to this little portion if you would it's it's it's just 50 paragraphs maybe 15 minutes or or so and uh it it I hope it I trust that it will be a uh a a blessing to you and God bless you I want you to notice this is a great lesson here now I love this see see Moses if we read here right that Mo when the children begin to get scared to seeing Pharaoh coming after in the line of duty God had performed everything perfectly now he started on the journey he's got the church together they've been called out they come from every denomination they all got together Moses went back there and said Lord what must I do he say well go do this all right go ahead now Moses you know I've called you to do this yes Lord all right you go speak this it'll be here come the Flies speak for this here it come do this here it come everything was thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord now it gets into trouble and God said now I've got them started on their Journey they're all done called out the church is together so I've got them on the journey now Moses take him on over I told you dude I'm going to sit down and rest a while Moses said oh Lord look coming here Here Comes Pharaoh the people are all what must have do what must have do see there isn't that just human being yes sir begin to cry what must I do here we see Moses expressing the fully human nature always wants God to get behind you and push you into something now that's us today you want God after seen all we've seen yet you want God to push you to do something see Moses had just laxed around said God will go ask you see what you say yeah yeah you say all right I said it too see but here God ordained him for the job proved that he was with him and here he is the circumstance comes up and then he begins to cry What Can I Do Lord what can I do now you remember he had already prophesied here before he said these Egyptians at you see today you'll see no more and then immediately begin to cry out God what can we do he' done done a pretty good job in prophesying there see done told him what would happen if the word of God was in him it was in him and when he was telling that it actually come to pass what he said was already going to come to pass and here was crying out what am I going to do amen oh if that isn't human beings if that isn't me if that isn't me and already prove what you say it happen I'm with you and you circumstance rolls in in a moment what must I do what must I do Lord hey Lord where are you at hey do you hear me what must I do and it already ordained him and Vindicated him and proved and worked everything through him he God oh my fully expresses man wants to rest and let God do the pushing and yet he knew that God had anointed him for this job to do this and God had clearly Vindicated his claims it was time for the people to be delivered God do his miracles and wonders that draw them all together in one group amen you follow me amen brought them all together in one group amen vindicate his claims scripture said so here was a sign here was the evidence here everything that he said then he come among as a prophet whatever he said God honored it even to create and bring up flies and put things in existence and everything he had promised him here he done it amen but he wanted to wait wait on thus sayeth the Lord see he should have known that the very Vindication of his call was thus sayith the Lord his job that he was ordained to was thus sayith the Lord can you get it why did he wait on thus say the Lord he want Lord what can I do here I brought these children out this far here's the circumstance Pharaoh's coming they're all going to die what must I do what must I do he had already predicted what this was going to do he' already told just exactly what do he predicted the end of the very Nation he was brought up in yeah amen I hope you understand Moses already said you'll not see him anymore God's going to destroy them they made fun of you long enough God will destroy had already predicted what would happen to him then Lord what must have do see the human nature there what must it do I'm going to wait for thus sayith the Lord yes sir I'll see what the Lord says now I'll do it remember there was a pharaoh had raised up and didn't know Joseph you know in that time right at that time and Moses stood right up and predicted the end of that nation and here he was right to the place where it was to be happening then he cries out what must I do Lord what must I do see isn't that human beings isn't that his human Nation what shall I do he was already prophesied God had honored everything he said and he was called for the job so why did he have to say what must have do there was a need it just up to him to speak part God wanted Moses to put that gift of faith that he had given him to work amen God had Vindicated it it was a truth and God wanted Moses want the people to see that he was with Moses and he back there he waited saying now Lord him miss the baby don't you tell me now yeah I'll go do this I got thus sayith the Lord Brother is that thus sayi the Lord yes yes brother mes that's th sayth the Lord yeah okay we got it now thus sayith the Lord and it happened never fail one time never did fail and here it is in the circumstances comes up again now he's got him on the journey the church is already called out got them on the journey and they're moving up and Moses started crying out Lord is it thus say the Lord what must I do all right God wanted Moses that faith that he had put in in that gift that he had clearly v v Vindicated God had clearly proved to Moses and the people that it was him by the word and by the things that was said come to pass it was clearly identified there was no need of him worrying anymore about it see there's no more of him thinking anything about because it's already cleared up he already done these things he had already proved by uh flies and fleas that he spoke things into creation that the word of God was in him so here he is going to ask now what to do when the circumstances lays right before him oh my I hope this goes way down to us and we can see where we're at see don't make you feel about that being thinking about Moses telling his faults look at ours here he was standing there see know that the scripture said that was the hour and day for that to happen and know that God had met him in a pillar of fire and it went right down before the people and performed these Miracles and everything he said had come to pass even bringing things into creation doing the things that only God could do showing that his voice was God's voice and here was a circumstance with that people that he was raising up bringing on to the promised land and then was standing crying what must have do that's a human being W this as brother Roy Slaughter I believe he sitting outside the door there told me one time about something doing something to me and I said well I did this now that he said brother Brandon let them lean on your shoulder today and tomorrow you pack them and that's just the way human beings is lean on your shoulder today and tomorrow you pack him that's that's what Moses is doing God had to pack him along after you ordained him and proved it to do it and the People Order said Moses say the word I've seen you do it there God honored you there are you the same one today amen do it amen to have not it but he didn't all right just as it was then so is it now we find out that so he said Mo God must just got enough of it yes amen God must got fed up on it he said why you crying to me about haven't I already proved my identification haven't I told you that I sent you for the job didn't I tell you to go do this didn't I promise that I'd do this I'd be with your your mouth and I'd speak through you and I'd do this and you'd show signs and wonders didn't I promise to do it have not I did just exactly destroy every enemy from around you and here you are stand not here now at the Red Sea right in the line of duty what I told you do and then still holling and crying to me don't you believe me can't you see that I sent you to do this oh that isn't human being my so it just must got pretty well fed up on it and he said um you know you have of it you know if you go to take these children over to that Promised Land that's exactly you're pinned up here in the corner there ain't nothing else you can do so there's a need what are you crying to me about amise Lord what you looking at me for what you calling on me about haven't I proved it to the people haven't I proved it to you haven't I called it isn't the scripture didn't I promise to take this people to that land didn't I call you and tell you I would do it didn't I call and say I'd sent you to do it and it wasn't you it was me and I go down and I be with your lips and whatever you said I I'd vindicate and prove it have I done then when any little thing comes up play act like a baby or be a man speak to the people hallelujah then move forward amen there you are don't cry speak amen oh I like that why are you crying to me about just speak to the people and go far forward to your objective whatever it if it's sickness or whatever is to raise the dead or whatever it is speak I prove to speak to the people what a lesson what a lesson oh my at this stage of the journey where we're standing look where we're at now yes sir at the third pull Hallelujah notice we're right here at the door of the coming of the Lord he was anointed for the job and still waiting for thus sayith the Lord God must just got enough of it he said Don't Cry Anymore speak I sent you oh God what this church ought to be this morning God's perfect a Vindication but the pillar of fire and the signs and the Wonders everything just like it was in the days of Sodom he said it would return Bank here's a world in its condition there's a nation in its condition there's a women in the condition there's a man in the condition there's the church in the condition there's everything the elements signs flying saucers and everything in the skies and all kind of mysterious things and the Sea a Roar and tidle ways man's heart failing fear perplex of time distress between nations the church falling away and a man of sin rising up who oppos himself above all is called God he that sth in the temple of God show himself a home my and it's come to this nation and the church is organized in all all of them gathered together is Harless to the and everything exactly in the way hoard them hoard what is it telling women they can cut their hair tell them women they can wear a shorts tell man if they can do this and they can do that and preachers they do this in the social gospel and things don't you see it's committing adultery with the true word of God and God has sent us his true word undenominational no strings tied to it and give us a pillar of fire of the Holy Ghost has been with us now for 30 years and everything that he's predicted and said come to pass exactly Hall that's right speak to the people let's go forward that's right Lord amen we got an objective that's Glory let's move to it we're head to the promised land all things are possible to them that believe that's right speak to the people haven't I proved it haven't I even had my picture made among you and everything else and done everything that could be done to prove that I'm with you doesn't the magazine just a few weeks ago packed the article one you said here at the pull pit what would take place out here 3 months beforehand and there it went taking place in vindicate even the science knows about it and everything that I've done and you're still waiting that's right speak to the people and go forward to your objective amen help us didn't Nathan tell David Nathan Brothers him amen amen amen you see the same condition really God told Peter to walk on the water he got out there and you know God told gave him his motive and objective he told them what to do he Vindicated who he was do we have have haven't you been Vindicated didn't you hear the word of the Lord didn't God touch you didn't he call you didn't he separate you from sin didn't he give you the baptism of the Holy Spirit didn't he say every promise in the book is mine didn't he say the works that I do you shall do also didn't he say lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover didn't he say you know speak the word share the word share the gospel and part eternal life I mean he he's we and we sit back and I like the way that he put it you you and I I I this is kind of what I just thought he brought out so so beautifully he he says like this he says man wants to rest and let God do the pushing we're always waiting for God to push us into it why we want to make sure it's his will he came up of a circumstance now Moses is saying is it your will I go over to this water is it your will I go over to the promised land every everything that God had done all of a sudden brings him in to questioning everything God saved me off that rooftop he saved me from drugs he saved me from this he brought me through that he brought me through this he he's taken me here he's got me out of this trouble he got me out of that mess he's done all these things all that got done all of a sudden I come up to one little trouble and it's all over everything he's you done to bring me to here and this is my end this is this is the finish of me wait a minute Paul said death where is your stting grave where's your Victory I still got a crown to go to you know what I mean he wasn't it wasn't his end it's not your end that's what's so beautiful you understand is that you you didn't come to this message on your own God didn't open up this third poll to you on your own you know always hear what's the third poll speak the word speak the word he spoke squirrels he did these he done what God told him to do we have a word too to speak not it's not creating a new word to speak the word already controls every circumstances your faith comes from the word you read the word the word is becomes your reality and if this circumstance is contrary to this word this word is what you believe and you call that which is not as though it is this is what he said this is what I believe this is what I speak this is the way it's going to be I don't have to wait for that circumstance to change before I believe I changed the circumstance because perfect faith is the master of every circumstance but we sit back and we look for all kinds of little signs and things to happen I'll never forget at one time a a a a sister she went to our church my church and and she had a plan in her mind that her grandchildren would get saved if I let them put their baby in our little nativity scene at church they wanted to put their live little baby in our little nativity play at church and I just felt checked you know what happens if the somebody tips the baby over the baby starts crying or the you know another there you know there's just a hundred reasons why it wasn't a good idea but to her I interrupted God's salvation plan and I thought wait a minute if the word said God give you your children then that's why you're going to get your children not cuz they're in nativity scene or not because they do this or not because they do that faith comes from the word what the word says is what is is now remember we said in perfect faith we listened to it he believes what the word said he was can't you believe what the word says you are so you you understand Peter was fine until he looked at the circumstance it's easy to be until the circumstance Rises up Peter didn't have the perfect Faith but when he was at the gate called Beautiful he had the perfect Faith now he knew he possessed it and once he possessed it he used it the word said you have the power but he says we lack the faith to use it because we're afraid of what we're believing maybe you've got a Lost Child maybe they're deep in drugs maybe they're deep in mental condition may may maybe they're they they it appears on the outside that they've totally rejected and cursed God that don't matter what's the word say what's your promise what did God promise you cuz your faith isn't going to come from rearranging the circumstances or getting a different circumstance like I said people are always trying to save Pentecostal people because they've got long hair and dresses they're the most hardened people of all they're not they already think they got it what makes you think they want what you got you're going to tell them about healing they believe about healing the Pharisees lived outlived them all Prophet said that's not what people want to see people want to see a people living by the word of God living by the word of God all things are possible ible why because I'm believing what he said and that's why faith has to have a resting place it's got to have something that it anchors to and what does faith anchor to it anchors to the word if so when we talk about the third pole speaking the word is isn't us running around speaking change to circumstance it's not walking up to a flat Tower and say be full of air you know no it's what the word of God says if the word of God says I'll make a way then you walk up to that flat turn you say the Lord will make a way that I'm I'm totally resting and trusting that God will take this circumstance by his promised word and fix it now if he airs up the tire fine or if he sends An Angel by to pump your tire up for you or whatever happens or you just might get the Jack out and put the tire on and put your religious experience back in the trunk where it belongs that that's not what it's about we promised that this church would come to this perfect Faith he promised the church was on its way he promised in why Christ speak that the church would come to the place that they'd believe every word of God that was bride material now we're into bride material he said he said that we don't get scared we don't look around we stay with God's word a Mystic to the world not unexplainable to the unbeliever but nevertheless God's word is true so remember that that go God finally got to Moses and and if he did it to Moses certainly we should take heed why are we why does God have to push us into things he already told us to do go into all the world and preach the gospel it shouldn't be so much a cry of what must I do but Lord give me wisdom on how to approach it give me the right Spirit Lord I I know I feel led to speak to this person I know I'm going overseas to do this great work give me the wisdom father to do these things give me the right approach I know I'm called to do this I know you'll be there but you got to step out and you can't be afraid that it's not you you can't keep putting yourself in the unbelieving category you can't keep making yourself unworthy did he die for your sins did he forgive your sins did he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he's our righteousness he made us worthy he made us Worthy worthy by his election he made us Able by his promise and his power I'm not able in myself but I'm able because he enabled me by my calling and by the word and by the Forgiveness of my sins and by the baptism of the Holy Spirit he did it that's right now can I act upon that Jesus believed he said can't we believe we're Believers can't we believe our position can't we believe that God put us here in this day to be the bride material of perfect Faith we've seen men try it all kinds of different ways why don't we just try it the word way that's right why don't we just try it the word way believe everything he said is true study to show yourself approved read your Bible take the promises take the message live by it know that it's true and watch it come to pass just the same yesterday today and forever our our sister where are you the one we're going to baptize I I can't see you yet there you are want you go ahead and come around and and and we'll baptize you uh this evening and and uh praise the Lord and uh so uh we'll have Billy lead us in a few songs if you have to go feel free but I think this is wonderful our sister's faith has has reached out and she said I I I said I know you I don't recall your name she said yes I've been going here since I'm 10 and uh you know the Lord's moved on her she saysi want to give my life to the Lord I want to do what's right you know I want the spirit of God and and watch the miracle I it's a miracle these are the kind of Miracles I believe in I don't care how sick you are if you get well guess what if the Lord carries you going to die it's almost like praying for the sick and saying be well for a season but you know why you're supposed to want to be healed prophet of God said you got to have a reason that you want to be healed you want to be healed because your sickness is keeping you from performing what God would have you to do it's not a a key to make you UND desperate and make your life easier you know what I mean so you don't have to suffer and have any pain that's right you know it's not let's have a little easy uh Lord I need an easier life you know you had you didn't have a place to lay your head but Lord I really need a feather bed and a a goose down pillow and a real comforter if we're going to reign with them we're going to suffer with them you're healed because you want to be about God's business you got to have a reason and the reason's got to be right and Paul he sought the Lord three times and the Lord finally spoke to him and said Paul I've made you this way because my strength is made perfect and weakness and Paul said I'd rather glory in my infirmities that the power of God might be manifested so Lord bless you um I I don't believe we'll be with you this coming weekend uh we're going to go out for sister Lesley's sister's funeral Linda uh passed away and and they're going to have the family memorial service and we'll be gone for that and

remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to all them that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and
