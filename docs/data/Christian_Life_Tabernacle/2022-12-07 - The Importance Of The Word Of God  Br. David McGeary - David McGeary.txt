Description:
The Importance Of The Word Of God
Br. David McGeary
December 7, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

in your your sovereignty in your all supreme power and your Eternal plan we just ask that you would be with us in our fellowship tonight that we could enjoy your word in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen God bless you if you have your Bibles let's turn to the gospel of Saint John and read that first verse and very familiar verse and and uh we just want to have some fellowship most of my thoughts tonight are coming from the sermon uh the spoken word is the original seed and the first few uh pages of that message which is uh a pretty encompassing message it covers a lot of ground and and I was only able to get one or two pages so we might play parts of it as we go around but it just something that's on my heart that I trust will bless you this evening in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word and your precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated this weekend as many of you know we were had flown to Maryland to Rockville Maryland area to perform the funeral and the graveside services for Brother David Salinas and you know I had a tremendous experience there um you know the service came and you know the Lord will reach out to you and he'll put the scripture on your heart and um and you just you know it's the word so but when I when uh we showed up at the funeral I believe it was in some form of maybe a presbyterian or some form of denominational Church but the exciting part of it is the crowd was absolutely made up probably of 90 percent unbelievers and I have to just be honest with you the stimulation of preaching this gospel to people who have never heard it before it was absolutely magnificent and when when you begin to see the word of God just unfold and you see people that have never heard it the majority of them are Catholics and and we talked about the scripture and and God's word not changing and we used our texts from the 24th chapter of Luke and that's the chapter when the ladies approached the tomb and they enter in the Tomb and there's two men they're two angels and they say he is not here why do you seek the living amongst the dead and we took the text that he's not here so where is he and the the hope that we have for eternal life and how that it was never God's intention that man die the first man would have never died of it by sin that death came and but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus and you know when you go back to the Simplicity of the Gospel what it was that really saved you what it was that really made a difference in you and there's there's no way that uh they would ever receive life without the word of God or faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and as we looked on to this uh you know is almost like uh having the opportunity to introduce the Bible to people who have always mostly been to masked who the only thing they know about can forgiveness of sins is a confessional and a Hail Mary and and to tell them that there's a sacrifice paid for their sins and that there's a book and this book is the word of God and the prophet of God goes through this in the in the message uh spoken word uh is the Original Seed and we know that uh the the great thing about God's word is God's words Eternal right in other words it it doesn't it didn't have a beginning it didn't have an end it's it's Eternal and and that's why even today so many thousands of years after that Jesus had come so many thousands of years after man had put this in print people can still read this scripture today and have it come to life you can exhaust God's word amen youth you can't study it tell you know it you can't uh uh because it's like a Looking Glass it's it's like a uh if I I just don't have a vocabulary but the word of God's like a portal that allows you to look into things that were you've never seen before open up New Dimensions to you open up new thinking to you open up new possibilities to to you it it's something that's that's beyond and and when you begin to put periods on it and you begin to look at it like it's Academia like it's a com it's a complete work well if it's Eternal it's not a complete work in fact it'll take Eternity for God to reveal himself he's it'll be a continual revelation of of of being there with him so the first thing we know that God's word is eternal so it so when you read the scriptures you never want to read it like a history book you never want to read it like like it's it's Doctrine or like it's teaching but you you need to read the scripture like it's the revelation of his personality it fits him wanting to introduce himself to you to have a greater relationship to have a a to show you things that you've never seen before you know it's not the same old bacon and eggs every morning you know what I mean act and if the same thing you know I had a little bit of a Costco chicken tonight and I ate that Costco chicken and I said you know something I've eaten so much Costco chicken I know what it tastes like it's got a certain taste about it it's got a certain thing I'm so glad that the word of God you never can get tired of God's word amen if you approach it right it'll feed you it'll it'll it'll I don't know how to say it forgive my word but it'll create a flavor for just what you have need of amen it's it's like honey if it's sweet it's it's beautiful even the correction of God's word is sweet because you realize that it saves you from trouble it saves you from disaster it's the tender handed Jehovah leading you and and and and being there for you amen God speaks to you through his word and the reason that he can speak to you through his word today because the word that he spoke is eternal so in other words it covers all time and space I know many of you have started maybe have a Bible that uh you've I hope you've wore out more than one Bible you know but I know when you have a Bible I had my first uh my first Bible that I got that was the Scofield bible they told me that this was the type of brother Brandon the Bible the first one he had well pretty soon it wasn't the complete word anymore because I'd lost pages and I still holding it together and it didn't have a cover and I send it out to be bound again and if and you just don't want to give up on it but pretty after a while it looked like you know I marked in yellow and then I try to Mark him blue and Mark in this and Mark in that and pretty soon you know what it just you looked at it and he was just a mass of color because you thought you read it you know what I mean and you mark it in yellow and then the next time it's new to you and you underline it and then you read it another time in this new to you and you Circle it and pretty soon you ask yourself did I ever read this book in the first place but we know that this is a new book to us it's a brand new book to us and we don't have to Journey outside of God's word we've just got to learn how to read it and you don't read it you read it by listening to it when you read it let the word of God speak to you let the scripture speak to you go to listen hear ye him uh a sermon was preached he said we do all the Talking you know we just got to stop and here he am God speaks back to you in his word you know you a lot of times you'll have a prayer you'll pray and ask God for something and if you're just patient and you read your Bible every day and you pray every day most of the time your answers come back to you through the scriptures because he can't they can't change so that's another great thing we know about God's word is it can't change it can't be improved upon he can't go back and rethink it because he's God and and so if he thought it in the first place it's right all the way through he can't improve on it he can't come up with a new idea because every idea that was the word of God was eternal I mean there's nothing to compare it to there's nobody it's even the scripture says whom among you have counseled God or can say to God why have you done thus or or have done this that's what makes him God he's Sovereign he's in control he can do what he wants to do when he wants to do it and the greatest thing why it's Eternal because when he spoke his word he he he had a purpose in mind so we know that he can't change it it can improve upon it he'll never go back and and go back on it he'll never ever say I didn't mean that right that's right he means what he says and he'll stand behind it if you believe it he'll be there to prove it to you God because the prophet of God said in his spoken words original see he says God's honor his honor he's the Fountain of all honor he said his honor obligates him to stand behind his word and if he could take it back then he wouldn't be God it's okay so we know that that God's uh once it's spoken it can never die it can never die it it it continually it continually goes on it's okay it's Eternal and and so we we realize that it's it's just a lot of people they get to the place they don't understand the word of God they they they don't look at it for for being God you know they've got God up here but this is God in word form if you if you uh if if by the spirit of God and and and that's why a lot of times it's really important that you spend a little bit of prayer before you go into the scriptures and get into the spirit that's where John was he was in the spirit on the Lord's day you know okay and what does it mean to get in the spirit it means to separate yourselves from the burdens of the world separate know that in this scripture God's going to talk to you you're going to find your answers you're going to find instruction all the word of God is given for instruction for reproof and Sunday dies and diverse manners God spoke this through His prophets the spirit of God moved upon him so we really have something in in God's word and and it's beautiful and so you when when you begin to look at what it means that this word is eternal you know uh like the a lot of times the people get hung up by evolution you know they'll they'll say well we went and found a rock that's 20 million years old and you know I I it looks like a rock to me you know I don't know which rocks are 20 million years in which rocks aren't 20 million years I don't think they do either but you know man's always trying to impress one another so there they say well we carbon dated it and we have all this so that proves that the the Bible is not true did you ever need this because three Genesis 1 1. it's marvelous how the scripture unfolds when you have a message that interprets the word of God to you amen that's what men do men interpret the word of God to themselves God's meaning of God's words never changed amen it's just that man's takes their own thinking but we know that God interprets his word by bringing it a path and and so a lot of a lot of our students a lot of times in school and high school and college they'll get approached and they'll talk about Evolution and they'll talk about uh you know something being solo the Bible says that the world was created in seven days no that's not what the Bible says they just don't read the Bible in fact they jump over the first verse the first verse of the Bible simply says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth okay it was all created he created the heavens and the Earth period in the beginning God created the beginning of everything was when God created it not when some some molecule out here bumped into another molecule and they had some Big Bang Theory well where did the you know I mean it's just well they they choose to be ignorant they do they choose to be ignorant but the scripture simply says in the begin God created heavens and earth period everything was created then okay where was it it was in his mind it was in his thinking right and then the very next verse it says and the Earth was without form and void so it was still in thought form it was still in if I could say this in mind form like someone who's got who's like uh do we we've heard like in the message called the Masterpiece where the artist had something in his mind and and now he he he he was going to take this block of stone and and work on it and bring what that he had in mind to life well God didn't need a block of stone he created what he had in his mind and so the scripture just simply says in the beginning God created it he had a plan he had if I could say this a thought and that's what it was the thought was there and when the thought was there that was the creation of God and then the next scripture says and the Earth was without form and void in other words that that proves that it was still in thought form it hadn't taken on form yet we we've let man and Theology and religion and denominations put all the interpretation to the word of God now hold that there we've allowed them to to tell us what it means in the scriptures here and the next verse says and and there was Darkness upon the face of the Earth in other words it hadn't been revealed yet it was without former void there wasn't Darkness like you saw it but it hadn't been made known until some of these revealed to you you're in the dark Until It's Made known you're in the dark so there was Darkness on the earth it wasn't made known yet what the plan of God was what the word of God was was it made known the words always existed it's eternal but there came a time that he decided he would share it with man oh Hallelujah I like that we could go right into the uh three uh uh objectives of God right to reveal himself to have preeminence to bring us back to where we were in the beginning and so it was in darkness it was it was without form it without voice in other words none of it had been revealed yet none of it had been made known yet and that's what even today it's based on Revelation God had to reveal it by bringing it to pass right and then the next scripture says and it's beautiful says and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters then he started making it known and however long it took him to do it that was him but nothing's ever contrary to the word of God the word of God is always right in fact the word of God is the original it's it's the original and so we know that it it it's it it's the original and so because it it's the original thing the only thing that's original and genuine is the word of God that's what the original is everything else is a a hybrid from that in other words it's been changed but the word of God is exactly the same so another queen God God's word had an eternal purpose that purpose has never changed it had an original purpose now man tries to change the purpose man tries to change the direction man is so bold that they'll tell you what God meant this is what God meant you know how God shows you what he meant by doing what he says could you imagine us sitting around trying to describe light well that's the trouble when when the scripture says light everybody thinks of the Sun you would think that Edison was already there that God had been Franklin and Edison there that's not the light he was the light of the world he said let there be light that just wasn't son that wasn't the moon of stars that was let there be something that was going to reveal the Eternal purpose of God let there be something that could get Revelation let there be something that could open something up that would show light he was the light of men he was the light of the world let there be light in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh Glory what a wonderful word it had an eternal purpose it had an eternal plan he's Alpha and Omega he's the beginning and the end the only way you can have a beginning in the end I only know building is you have to have a blueprint and as the world was progressing God through Prophets would provide a page to the blueprint he would provide the next step where do I go from here that's for all of us who never read the instructions you know when they say do this before you do that they're usually right now I think they make those instructions just to get you but I don't know their motives and objective but I know one thing that God has no evil his thoughts from good and what he does is simple it's simple just stay with the word so it has a plan you are saying so if we could understand if we could get in the plan then the plan will unfold itself and produce the product but you've got to follow it step by step like you've got to repent right that that's the first step uh the as we heard last week that the First Gospel of the first doctrine that Jesus preached was you must be born again so look there's a there was a step there was a plan we know there was a plan sanctification I mean justification sanctification filling of the spirit everything God's word had a plan but it was an eternal plan it wasn't a temporary plant it wasn't just a plan to get you out of the world it was a plan to bring you all the way back to where you were in the beginning they just follow me through for a few minutes this morning and and and the word had Eternal timing every age every hour every time a Believer came in sometimes we wonder well why do they come in so late why did God everything's got Eternal timing everything's purpose the prophet of God explained it like a watch where every little part has to move to make it he he's got all of that planned you know we just keep trying to rebuild the watch or we don't like the part we're playing we don't think our part's important our part's important it's important you might be going through a trial you might be going through a hard time God knows that he timed that it's got an outcome it's got a purpose because if you're part of the word then you've got an eternal purpose if you're a part of the word you're part of the Eternal plan if you're part of the word then you're part of the timing all the players and and all the and all the the players and the people they all had their place in other words nothing's out of kilter as evil as this world is and as maddening as it is and as morally corrupt as it is it's all according to the word of God that's right and the Lord will have Vengeance on whom he'll have Vengeance and he'll have mercy on whom he's mercy so we we understand that the word then is the only thing that's an original and it's the only thing that will last nothing hybrid can last I'd like just to read the book I have doesn't have paragraphs so uh it's it's in the old book A Spoken Word is the Original Seed uh it was preached in a 318. he says he says now that's why we believe it and it is the word of God therefore God's spoken word is original it's the only thing that's original original means the first the start there's a lot of witness we World call it knockoffs you know what I mean like uh you've got there's a lot of Rolex watches out there they look like Rolexes you know they you know but they're not Rolexes because they're not the original they're a knockoff everybody wears a knockoff nowadays they'll have a knock knock off Louis Vuitton or a knock off this that could you know I I thought the best knockoff was guests guess whether it's a knockoff or not they're not original why is society so based on a fake even their life is fake I like the idea of aging cream that's what I'm gonna go buy me four or five buckets of aging cream and I'm not going to get old no more who believes that stuff that's fake you're gonna age I'm sorry you're corrupting while you sit there it's the truth I'm not saying it to be funny I'm just saying that that you it lets you understand that everything that's not the original doesn't last because it's only the original is the word and that's the only thing that's eternal so just follow me through for just the next few moments I'd like to read this he said now why we believe that it's the word of God therefore God's spoken word is original and everything that God created spoke into existence is original oh you found it wonderful okay that's the original what God spoke into existence maybe it hadn't arrived yet you understand what I'm saying we don't live we don't look in a rear-view mirror we don't follow history we have a living savior the prophet of God preached leadership because he didn't want man to be looking back in history and teaching you history when he's here to lead you well I was fellowship with the brothers that command used to say I like the way he put it as we are felonyship he said we only have what's right before us we don't even have yesterday leave those things which are behind behind and press for the higher calling so we can't we we can't look back so we're just greeting here is the original you can't hybrid something of his creation he said you can't hybrid something of his creation secondarily that's the reason Eve could do what she did with her own seed because she wasn't in the original creation now he prefaced that because he didn't want the sisters to to miss it all of us are hybrid we're born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies just follow this down it's beautiful she said she was a byproduct of man not in the creation of God God created the whole thing and then he took a part of his creation and made a helpmate that's the reason you can hybrid a donkey and a horse but it won't last so what do we have now we have the hype bird of Education we have the hybrid of science what are they doing they're mixing stuff of the world they're taking chemicals and and they're mixing this and they're mixing ideas and they're coming up with what uh what we call inventions or or all this other stuff but what's the one thing we know about it none of it is original it wasn't in the original plan therefore it'll pass Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away just follow this down because it's beautiful is that she said that's the reason you can hybrid a donkey and a horse but it won't last it's death but the original has got life it comes back again okay the other has no way back you understand they don't have a way back so you breed something you hybrid something you mix it but it can't come back in other words a mule which is the mixture between a horse and a donkey has no way back to becoming a horse or a donkey again no way back anything that's hybrid dies it's got no life in it it can't last eventually it'll uh fizzle out because they just can't keep going that's why you notice something will start and it just Fizzles out I mean I look at things when I when I when the prophet God said that I thought about a man is always trying to substitute something for the original I thought a Cabbage Patch dolls well people were killing one another in a department stores for a doll every little girl had to have that kind of baby doll why because they hybrid to where they don't even want to have children no more they're trying to substitute children with fake it's fake that's all Satan's offering you cool the life Satan has to offer is not real it's not original it'll die but just follow this thought through he says it can't come back again I hope you can see it now the original has the life so that's the reason I think that Cults and denominations and organizations die history proves they are everyone dead they never do rise no more they come to a place and they fizzle out the Revival goes away they just become a system they're stuck in it there's no place for them to go they're dead the Catholic church is doing the same old thing the same old thing every service saying the same prayers same the same thing you talk about dead whoever believes that you reach God by running beads through your hands that's how blind that's what happens when something's not original that game what does a hybrid mean it means mixing and so he goes on here he says this he says the original has life so that's the reason I think Cults and denominations and organizations die history proves that everyone dead they never did rise no more they never will they can't breed themselves back so the fire and the Zeal they started with like Luther they can't breed themselves back to that because it's mixed they mixed it and now it can they can't breed themselves back they can't get back they can't get back what do you think when they're all gonna go try to buy oil for because they ran out of light they can't get back they have no place to go they know they're dead and they know they're dying and their gospel cannot meet the challenge of the hour they can't keep their marriages together they can't keep their children together they can't keep drug addiction out that can't keep alcoholism out they even can't even keep the thieves out they have no safety they have no protection they call on a God that can't hear them because you can only meet God in one place it's under the shed blood and they've got a hybrid substitute for the shed blood and it'll never work do you understand they want to get back but they can't get back through a hybrid system because the system because the hybrid can't reproduce itself it's the end of the strain oh I can't wait I'm going to read this and then I'm going to read a few other quotes that's going to make me get excited I'm trying to be calm they never did rise no more they never will they can't breed themselves back got nothing to breed with they are sterile that's why Eve's children die we've got nothing to get eternal life with the end of the road man has reached the end of the road they know it there's a gem on every corner there's stores full of vitamins there's advertisements there's creams there's shots there's there's this there's that what is it they're exploring space the Earth is dying man's dying everything that's hybrid's dying it's dying you see it dying our country's dying our artists are our politics are dying our Educational Systems dying everything's thing you don't think education's thing they don't have to go to school no more they got a machine that thinks for them oh don't be at a table with anybody and give out a fact that you think you might have heard they're going to Google you well ain't no Google gonna hold me down I didn't get what I got from Google that's right you know what I mean Google's gonna end well I tell you I think if the whole uh I don't know what you call internet or Cloud if it crashed I think there'd be Mass suicides people wouldn't even know how to get home people drive home every day of their life they'll get in their car and they'll say navigate home because if that crazy woman ain't talking to them they don't know how to drive that's true it's dying it's dying do you hear me it's dying that's why Eve's children die education's dying they can't do it they're trying to bail out every loan and everything because it's all gone it's over because hybrid can't bring it back a mule can't get back to a donkey I can't get back to a horse it it just can't get you know a hybrid religion can't get back right now I want you to listen to this beautiful thing this is what excited me in closing tonight and and I just think that maybe we'll we'll just go uh will go on he says and this is out of the tape that we just listened to the the meanest man I know that that was a 127-62 and uh and he's talking about uh Jesus here perhaps preaching a sermon and uh and and trying to get the people to understand that he was the way the truth and the life and that no man cometh unto the father but by him men are putting their faith in religion in popes and priests in movements and anointings but there there's no substitute because in the beginning was the word he was the original he was the what second Adam he was what was in Adam the life that was in Adam the word life of God Adam was the first Son of God the Son of God the life that Adam had came from God it didn't come from nobody else it was the father expressed in flesh now the second Adam the first Adam was a living Soul the second Adam was a what a quickening spirit which means he could bring you to life oh yeah that's right hey that's what he is he's not an object of of worship for religion he's a life-giver I am the resurrection and the life I am the way the truth no man comes unto the father but me in other words I have what was the original I am the original in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the original was made flesh and dwelt Among Us to do what because we're hybrid we can't get back we can't breed ourselves back we can't religion ourselves back we can't get back we're lost the only thing we produce is more crime more mental illness more diseases tell me it ain't true we've got more medicines now than we ever had why I think it is like the who what comes first the chicken or the egg I think they make the disease and then they get a medicine to rip you off I think a lot of people if they sit down and read the Bible a half hour a day there'll be a lot less mental depression in this world but what is he he's the original and this was his message right so he's talking about Jesus preaching he says he might as paragraph 34. he might have went back to Genesis and began and said in the beginning God said let there be and there was and he said let everything that I have spoken bring forth of its kind and it did then he might have brought something like this saying well now to bring forth but yet you can't take these seeds and you can't mix them together you can't get what's called a hybrid product beautiful very nice but it isn't original you you let it go it'll go back to its kind again in other words it has no life it has no future it has no hope education is fine don't don't put your trust in education most education gets you to the Grave quicker killing this world a hybrid product can never stand the roughness and the treatment that the original can stand why an old Longhorn would starve one of your herffords to death out on the Prairie in the wintertime she could make her own way like a deer but your hybrid Hereford your hybrid Brahma Angus it'd die out there you have to Baby them right and he he was standing today I believe he'd say something like this to us not only have we hybrid fruit animals that we've hybrid religion it has to be babied and petted or it it's not original we try to take the word of God and breed it into something else and breed it over here and it becomes a bunch of uh delicate babies that we have to baby and they can't take the real word he might have been saying something like that now I want you to I want oh he's sitting there saying he might be saying something like that but it's him saying something like that it's him the original the original word the original gospel he's preaching the original he says he might have said this see really your lives are hard bread all of us are hybrid you understand that so there's got to have to be something take place in order to get us out of this condition we can't religion ourselves out of it we can't join together and call ourselves the message the elect the bride we're the ones that's going you can't do it you can't you can't imagine it just follow with me for a second as we continue reading he says like you can't he says a donkey and breed a horse he said the same thing with corn it's beautiful but Readers Digest and these hybrid things are doing the people cancer and everything else hybrid chickens they say that 20 years it isn't stopped it'll happen women can't have babies no more they're becoming stronger closing up smaller in the hips and then they were and can't have the babies leaving leave things the way they are let God alone that's the way with his word leave it like it is don't try to add something to it to fit a Creed just keep it the way God said it believe it that makes a husky strong Christian not a baby that has to be denominational baby petted around a letter from church one denomination the other when he puts his name on the book in heaven it's settled forever it's already been settled let's just read this next paragraph he says so we know it can't go back that's what he does when he gives you a new birth why do you have to be born again because you're hybrid you can't add him to this life you've got to be born again now that's not a scary thing because if you see it you asked for it you admit I can't do this I can't make it I need something I need you Lord I need your life I need your spirit I'm at a dead end I can't bring myself back it's right and that's what religion is religion is man trying to bring himself back and they can't do it the only thing that can bring man back is the original it's got to be the original let's just read it's beautiful he says he said uh he says if that settles its Ferry Jesus might have said now in order to get back to the original God has to speak again in order to get back to the original the original word has to be spoken again not a different word the original word so the hybrid has no life in it so the only way to get his elected back to get his seed back to get those that are part of him eternally back is he has to speak the original again come on listen it's beautiful that's what he does when he gives you New Birth what's the new birth when he speaks the original to you again it's not an emotion it's not an anointing that falls on the just and the unjust but it's when he speaks again the original word to you again follow it through now that's what he does when he gives you the new birth your old life is gone and you're back to the original word of the Lord what are you back to when you're born to get you're back to the original word you can have an anointing to not have the original word you can be blessed and not have the original word that's why the rain falls on the just and the unjust but that's not the rain is and what does it it's the son that does it it's the word the original word and the only way this world would get the original word is for God to speak again let's just read what he said he said the original word of the Lord if you're not you're hybrid into churches denominations but when God speaks his peace and the Holy Spirit then you're back in the original family of God again you don't have to be baby then you're a rugged Christian who can stand it what's the only thing that can bring you back the original word because that the word is the only thing that's what original go to the cross to the fiery furnace to the Lion's Den or whatever it may be because the word of God the word of God the word of the Living God is burning in your heart and soul you know yeah it amazes me how when Christians have problems in trouble they just it's everybody else's fault is it okay it's all this stuff they they go into pieces you know there's got to be a reason for it must Jesus bear the cross alone God loves to prove his children look at job I mean if anybody had the the right to turn it in job did no but what did he do he had the original word the original word though the skin worms eat my flesh yet I shall see God that ought to be the voice on every Christian's list though I die with this though I suffer this though all the devils in hell are turned loose on me I don't care what happens I will see God I will rise again the the storm clouds is no sign that God's against you the sun is no shine that God's for you the only thing you know is what if you're born again you've returned back to the original word there is no birth without the original word there's a sensation there's an emotion there's a an anointing all that but on the birth the real birth only can come from the original word this is beautiful I'm enjoying myself is that okay for Jane amen he said rugged he said you won't stop one thing that rugged word of God stays right there when he spoke the original voice into your heart this Lord you are mine what happened he had to speak again so he speaks the original voice into your heart your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life if you ever had eternal life you always had eternal life he put the wedding band of predestination over on you there what was it he was back again speaking his original word back to his children because it's the only thing and what does he say he says you are mine what is the holy spirit the holy spirit is God taking possession of what's his what does he come back he sends the original word the original word stood in flesh and spoke to the Gentile to the Jews now the original word was veiled in flesh again why was it redeemed flesh it proved that Calvary the work of Calvary was finished and now there was a people that he could lay claim to you're my lady you're my elected your mind the word of God speaks to your heart and says your mind that's what God's got to do that's what you've got to hear that's what he does you're mine the original he says a rugged the rugged word of God stays right there when he spoke that original voice in to your heart you are mine sorry Satan I don't belong to you I belong to God now he might show me all the things I might have to suffer first namesake but I don't care though the skin worms eat my flesh yet I'll see God you're rugged your name is on The Book of Life what did he tell us what did the original word come in this day and tell us he told us we were kids were his elected the rugged word of God why are we you can't take this message and make it say anything else other than it says you don't have to change it just stay with it pray for Revelation pray that it opens it up don't you see that in our generation we have the original word oh I just think of sermon titles the way of a true prophet a true Prophet doesn't speak his own thoughts he only speaks God's thoughts the true Prophet stays with the original word so what were we getting in this day we're getting the original word because the original word is the only thing that can take us out of a hybrid condition our hybrid condition you we're all hybrid what's he doing he's unmixing us he's separating all the the stuff out of us that's not original there's no need to put on a religious covering there's no need to act like some religious thing I got a lot of stuff I got being taken out of me praise God but he spoke in my heart that I'm here and if he's going to do a start of work he's going to finish it to the end and nothing can pluck me out of my hand he told me my name was on the Lamb's Book of Life it settled I gotta quit worrying about impressing the world and I've got to get with the Eternal Word plan and the Eternal Word plan is that God's word seed in me has the power to transform me into what I was originally in his thoughts in the beginning and that's what we have today we have God speaking again the original word to produce the original Church and the original bride what is the prophet of God call it the restoration of Eve back to the garden back to where she was before she hybrid it and I could go on into marriage and divorce how he types it there how he talks about that old husband being die and not having rule anymore all those things don't war against the flesh to try to get yourself out of a hybrid condition let the word of God transform you leave those things which are behind behind he threw him in the sea of his forgetfulness lets us throw him in the sea as God forgive them and let us press to the mark of the higher calling amen God bless you let's stand this evening [Applause] amen oh it's God's word I the I really it's I appreciate the clap and all that but it's totally unnecessary I robbed every bit of it there wasn't one thought in there that was original not one you want to read it just go read the first uh well I I quit reading right there on page 17. so uh you just go read it and you'll just say you know what Brother David is a plagiarist say only what he says stay with the tapes right why you say what because it's the only thing that's original everything else is a lie every other explanation every other scientific thing everything else other than that is a lie there's only one thing that's true my word is truth and the truth shall set you free from your hybrid self thank God I'm ready to be free aren't you God bless you brother
