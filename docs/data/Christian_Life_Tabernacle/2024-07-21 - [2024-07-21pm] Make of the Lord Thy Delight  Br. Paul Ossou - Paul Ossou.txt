Description:
Make of the Lord Thy Delight
Br. Paul Ossou
July 21, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

your servant Brother David remember him remember every one of your children name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I believe we are happy to be gathering in the house of God tonight we were blessed this morning my prayer is that God may give us another blessing tonight as we are still standing we'll open our Bibles in second Timothy chapter 3 we'll read the first five verses um Second Timothy chapter 3 I'll try to read directly in English I ask you forgive my uh my accent this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be L of their own s c house booster proud Blasphemous disobedient to parent andth thankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers Force accuser ENC countenance Fe despisers of those that are good treat us e ianded lovers of pleasure more lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof amen from such turn away we'll go in the book of Psalm 37 Psalm chapter 37 read from verse uh 3-6 Psalm 26 Psalm 37 trust in the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell in the land and verily thou shall be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of th heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and it shall bring forth thy righteousness as delight and thy judgments as the noon day father we read your word it's for you to open it up to translate it to pronounce it for the good of your people we commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen have your I believe we happy tonight and we thank the Lord for the word this morning you know like brother says that when you read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation if you don't see the name of Jesus that means you didn't read it right sometimes when we read the word we have difficulties understanding that that declaration from the prophet because with the natural thinking with the intellectual understanding there's verses we're going to read but it doesn't talk about Jesus but we heard we learned this morning that everything is around the word that this Bible how do we call it is the word and John tells us in the beginning was the word and the Word was was with God and the Word was God and the word had was made flesh and when the word was made flesh it was Jesus so when we read the word we're reading Jesus Christ so when we don't see Jesus then we didn't read right that's why as Servants of God all that we're trying to do is to bring everything back to the word because Jesus Christ himself said that heaven and earth will pass away everything that we see will pass away one one thing that will not pass away that's the word of God one thing that will not fail is the word of God that's why all our thinking everything that we are has to be directed towards that word nothing but the word of God amen uh you know yesterday or the day before yesterday what happened there's a an application being developed somewhere in the world uh certainly by one individual or a group of people and this application has issue but it's the whole entire world that's affected something made by men's hand capable of impacting the whole world how much more the word of God the God who created that man who created application the world was not waiting for this to happen it's like says that it will be about the same for the atomic bomb and it's not necessarily the person we waiting on to do maybe someone drunk somewhere and and unknowingly will press the button and it will be too late the world will be impacted but the word of God is the only thing that would not pass away tonight the Lord has placed on my heart a little subject that I'm taking from uh verse 4 of Psalm 34 36 s make of the Lord that Delight make of the Lord thy Delight we know we saw how in Timothy it was descriptive of the time in which we are living in talking about man who loves pleasure more and they love God and a delight is a is an intense uh pleasure it's a it's a great pleasure and in this verse the Bible is telling us Delight Delight thyself also in the Lord and He will give you what your heart desire desires it means when someone has a desire tonight and he want that the Lord will give him his desire the infallible word word is telling us it says Delight thyself in the Lord theight make the Lord your greatest pleasure make the word of the lord your greatest pleasure we living in a time where there's a lot of Pleasures where there's a lot of things attracting people to different Pleasures the Bible spoke about this uh since the beginning as a prophecy but we are living these things the devil is opening up many doors to attract us to different Pleasures to to occupy our time to different Pleasures that we may never never get access to what our hearts desires because he knows that if we Delight in the Lord that if we meditate the word day and night as the book of Psalm said that if we if we meditate the word of the Lord day and night that we will be like a tree that's planted by the sea water that would produce its fruit in its season and everything that that man does will will will will be a success God told Joshua meditate on this word day and night don't ever go away from this word find your pleasure in the word of God because in that you'll find success in everything that you're going to do God has given us the key so we can have access to everything that our hearts desires so we can have success in everything that we do and because the devil knows that because he knows the word and he knows what each one of our weaknesses are and he's going to come to that weakness so you can concentrate on the weakness give you pleasure in your weakness you will not have time to meditate upon the word of the Lord and he knows because you don't have time to meditate on the word of you will only have time to do superficial prayers then you won't succeed the voice of pleasure God is describing to us the time in which we are living in and this morning they read to us the description of the age of La in Revelation chapter 3 we realize it's a people they say they are rich when he's sick he can go to the hospital with no problem he doesn't need to pray God if he wants to go somewhere he has his money to buy a airplane ticket and they are those that have enough money to go and visit Mars but God says that they are miserable poor blind and naked and is's inviting them to come to buy from him gold the word of God that the clothes that they may cover the nakedness and I Ser that they may have their eyes open and the same God who's inviting them is constantly standing at the door and knock how is he Knocking by the word of God people are concentrated in different Pleasures talks a lot about uh uh movies and theaters it was because in that time it occupied a lot of time for people people were uh uh refusing or staying away from churches in order for them to go watch series of of movies he would say that Pentecost they've run away from movie theaters the devil has taken the movie theater and brought it right into their homes and the Christians of today they've run away from television the devil is taken the movie theater and he's put it in the cell phone he said he put it in the cell phone maybe it's a little bit expensive for you to go get access over there wi-fi oh we'll give you Wi-Fi internet we'll give you internet that way the time to read the Bible WhatsApp you are there in WhatsApp Tik Tok Tik Tok Instagram Instagram Facebook Facebook and when you go out of there YouTube YouTube and sometimes the whole night or the whole day somebody has not even read one verse of the Bible he's left he's there for five hours and be sure anything that you read on the social media it will influence inuence your life somewhere it will influence your thinking somewhere it's going to bring you pleasure that's why you stay there [Music] longer but this pleasure is only taking you away from God enter in your heart for God to hear your prayers for God to give you the desire of your heart someone can say well I'm doing it just for distraction says that the field of Destruction the devil is the champion on that field just put your foot on there he's really going to receive you well and you going to forget that you are a Christian Delight thyself in the Lord sometimes people find Pleasures in certain things in alcohol in the drugs and sometimes they get in because they say they have all kinds of troubl they have problems when they take a little bit of alcohol and the drug they have pleasure they forget all of those problems but when the effect of alcohol is over when the effect of the alcohol drug is over the same problems are waiting but when you make of the Lord that Delight you find pleasure in the word of God you may have trouble oh you pray you open the word of God and you fall right on the answer and when you get out of there you had pleasure solu and the problem has gotten solved because he said that if you Delight in the Lord he will give you your heart's desire God has never lied and the devil knows that that's why all that he does is to try to take us away from the word of God to bring us to doubt a portion of the word of God God wants to bring us to believe the whole word of God but the devil will try to take us to only believe 90% and say oh that not 1% has God really said did God really say that you cannot go on social media than where is it written Delight thyself in the Lord and we know that in the time in which we are living in the Bible is compared that with Luke 17 in the time of lot there were those that were finding pleasure in those things of the world like lot in Sodom but there was also another group gr an elected group the group of Abraham they don't look at what the world is reflecting they don't look at what the world has to offer but they look into the promise of God Abraham was a man like you and I and probably an idolator it came from a country of dur in in in in in and one day God spoke to him like God speaks to each and every one of us tonight like God speaks to each one when the word is spoken God told Abraham get out of your country get out of your nation get out of your family go to a place that I shall show you it was even difficult for Abraham because he didn't know where God was taking him but us we have the whole word of God we know where God is taking us we know what God has promised for us and he said like he said telling us like he told Abraham come out of all the pleases of the world come to this message because there's a promise for you that this world will be destroyed but because of you I will send Elijah the prophet to open a way for you to open a bridge for you so you can be like the group of Abraham those that had received the visitation of Elohim himself says in question and answer of uh 54103 uh that evening paragraph 100 we are living in the day that God spoke would would come we are living in the last days we are living in a time when men regardless of what we tried to think about it God's word saysed that we are predestinated that's right we were predestinated and the devil knows that you are predestinated that the day that you will make your decision to go away from all the pleasures that the devil is offering you you will have full Ben uh blessings of the predestination that you've been G to we we are predestinated that's right what God has called will come to God and what God doesn't call will not come to God God calls and they refuse and he calls they refuse now I don't say God condemned any anybody he's just not willing that that all should should that any should perish but all might come to repentance but in order to be God he knew in the beginning that there wasn't going to come he knew that there were those that wouldn't come that there were those regardless of the demonstration of the power of God would not come that they would not believe this message and and and yet being God he knew from the beginning that they wasn't going to come yet he gave them a chance but they wouldn't come God knew who was in Sodom which is why even when Abraham was interceding with Elohim oh if you find 50 will you really destroy them oh no I won't destroy them what if you find 10 they said no I won't because he knew so before the foundation of the world the sodomite would not believe it he says yet he gave them a chance but they wouldn't come he he sent two angels in in Sodom they refused he gave them a chance how if he doesn't know that how did he know that we would have a Horseless carriages how would he know that these times will come like we have now why did he say that men would be heav highminded lovers of Pleasures why all the prophet predicted that all the things uh other things would would come plummet from be from the beginning God know everything he knows what will be and there is men in there that God looked down through time and said they won't come and they just they are just condemned and of that condemnation because they chose it themselves amen voila am amen there you are this is God who knows but you and I we don't know you and I cannot say that this one is a sodomite he won't believe all that God is asking us is to find them to give them a chance to give them the occasion for them to come into the message but God himself knows who's not going to answer to the call when he knocks at the door who's going to answer continues and said and I believe my brother my sister I say this with Godly respect and with fear of God in my heart I believe America sunk she's demoralized she's gone low to stooping it's a Pity and it's just not America it's the world the the the world is just sunk which is why all the pleasures that the world is going to try to offer us that everything that the sons of Cain will will manufacture to put at our disposal it's never going to be to try to bring us closer to God but you always try to take us away from the blessing that we have that we have the whole world is sunken there's no moral you just go out and see what's going on but God wants that Sons and Daughters of God that they may find their pleasure in the word of God in everything that God said not a part but not a part of what God Said but everything that God said and when we speak about these things it's not to condemn those people know God said we we will live in this time as such and the scripture has to be fulfilled we are not condemning them but we are condemning the sin in which those people find themselves in to try to bring those people back to the word of God but if those people are attracting us to their side with the pleasure that they are offering we we won't be able to attract them to what which that which is perfect which is the word of God butam says in uh enticing Spirits uh July it preached July 24th 1955 paragraph 111 he says don't condemn The Sinner have mercy on him let him go ahead and smoke his pipe let him drink his liquor let him have his card party that's his pleasure don't blame him coming home coming home and everything tired and worn out he wants some pleasure the thing you should do is live such a Godly life that you can prove to him that the gospel hold 10,000 times more than that that a great pleasure in the gospel than in those things it says and if he dies in that state he'll go to hell on his liquor that's the devil intoxication If he if he dies dragging on his on his old pipe God is God is their judge if he dies going out going out there dancing and running out with his Immortal clothes on God is the judge but one thing but he says but there's one thing if you die under the anointing power of the Holy Ghost like like stepen when he had looked up in the face of God said I see Heaven open and Jesus standing at the right hand you are Heavenly bound like her Martin in its box amen amen enticing Spirits versing the word of God all those things that are producing pleasure outside of the word of goded they are enticing spirits one day I was going to Arlington there's a stadium by Arlington the at& stadium I saw a lot of people passing by in a lot of car parked I I I I don't know if there was maybe a game going on in the stadium and people were there four five hours before the game and they were happy they had pleasures and they were going to be there until the end and even when the game is over they would have time to even talk about what happened in the game but when it's time to come to the to the church when the church goes on for 3 hours oh that's too much the pleasure that the devil is offering enticing Spirits he says enticing Spirit versing the word of God let loose let go how would you do it brother Bram just let go that's all you have to do all that's all you have to do take God's word don't try to make up nothing don't don't make up nothing it's not by your strength it's like when God treated with Abraham uncal it was an a a a uh unconditional Covenant it was God who was doing everything all that you have to do is to let go is to believe the word it's to not try to fabricate anything it's not try to move anything accept except the word alone in its simplicity it says don't get down on your on don't get down at the altar and beat on it and holler God give me the Holy Ghost Lord give me the Holy Ghost he ain't coming you beat on the altar that don't do no good we see it a lot of times your spirit come down says it's not coming it won't come it says it won't do no good no that a't the way it comes it's taking him at word Lord you said Lord you said Lord if I do I Delight in thy word you will give me all that my heart desires Lord I make a decision tonight to put away all the things that gives me pleasure and to Delight myself in thy word it's it's taking him at his word at his word he said look at Peter Peter was in trouble and the the boat was sinking was just moving and there was a great uh uh storm he he was in trouble he was going to die [Music] he seen the Lord come walking on the on water in other word he saw the word bringing out all the promises he said Lord if it's you B me to come Lord if it's you that says this give me the strength to believe it with all my heart the Lord said come on now Peter said now wait a minute let me go fast 40 days fast to see if I can walk on water oh Lord Oh Lord let me get enough Spirit on me that I can dance in the spirit and speak in tongue in this boat then I can step out no sir he took God and His word God told him to come he said I come God told me to believe I believe God told me to meditate on the word I meditate on the word God doesn't ask complicated things sometimes we complicated christianism but Christianity is to believe the word nothing but the word and all the word and that's it and the rest is God who does it it's not me that does it it's not my effort it's not my cry out it's God who does it he says he let loose he let loose and let go God took him through you don't in all that God is asking us is to take him by his word but the effort that the devil is going to do is to help us not to take God at his word to give us a word a job oh we work we work really hard when we come home very tired we have no time to read our Bibles oh we we do we we pray for five minutes oh five minutes is a lot one minute Lord thank you to have kept me at work and to bring me home in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen we don't have access to all the blessings that God has promised I was talking Billy talked about that uh uh quote this morning I don't remember what uh message that was I'm sorry when you see your friend do something that is not wrong that that is wrong it says you worship God in showing him this is not it and the same brother talk says everywhere you go find time to worship at work find time to worship at school find time to worship everywhere you go find a time to worship you can worship and sing you can you can worship in in in going somewhere quiet and praying you can you can worship in giving a testimony to a coworker find a time to worship the devil is going to try to take us away from that atmosphere but the word tells us the light th self in the Lord and He will give you your heart's desire it's not our efforts it's not what we are doing it's what he has already done he already done it he knew us since before the foundation of the world Glory to God that there was a man who suffered like job and from job he told us something that we forgot in this life he told job that when I was laying out the foundation of the world that the sons of God were shouting for joy God s saw us screaming over there for Joy when he was placing the foundation of the world he he knew us since before the foundation of the world he knew what we would be he knew by which that which we would go through he knew that he we would come Sinners and was slain since before the foundation of the world and he came and he fulfilled that portion of the scripture with Jesus who was slain so he can materialize to to show us what we were what we were we didn't have the knowledge that we were lacking that for your sins in reality I had already paid the price for your sickness I had already paid the price for it everything that you did was to accept him says uh in believing God preach uh February 24 1952 paragraph 200 he says and God can't save you because he has already done it so if you come crying today God saved meam say somewhere else that even if Jesus was standing here tonight and you come and you said Lord save me you will say I can't do it because I have already done it the only thing you have to do is accepted it's already done I wasn't saved 20 years ago [Music] I was saved not 19 years ago 19 years ago so in other word today is over 2,000 years ago but 20 years ago I received it and accepted it if you believe that you are not saved tonight the Bible is telling you tonight that you were already saved and he's only inviting you tonight so you could receive it he says if he if he hadn't it the first sin I done God would have wipe me off the face of the Earth because he said he would he would and he has to keep his promise I was healed 19 years 1900 years ago but I've got to accept it and the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old because a spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer and the same demon is telling others tonight wait a little while longer it's true that this message is true but don't take your baptism yet just wait a little while longer it this message is true but just wait a little while longer it's a demon he's saying wait a little while longer that's the reason you wasn't saved when you became at the age of accountability a spirit you got you got in the crowd young people you are in the group of people with evil people with evil spirits they will influence you and you will receive a

every servant of God it's what God gave it's it's what he gave it every gospel preacher the power and the authority to break that Spirit tonight we want to break that spirit so we can make the Lord our Delight so we can get access to all the promises God gave us the power and authority to break that Spirit he says I believe with all my heart and I also believe 100% with all my heart that every demon power that's in here at this minute is already broken I believe it oh I think one day in Congo I had a burden in my heart to go preach to to a small to a little village a Sunday I was I talked to the pastor brother rapael that you know very well he told me yeah because you're going to go to that Village over there in on the way there's another small church I want you to stop by that church Sunday night Saturday night you pre day Saturday and Sunday you go where you want to go in the morning and then in the afternoon I want you to come back to that little small Church before you can come back so I came to that small village as I when I was preaching as I was preaching [Music] I felt like there was something that was resisting fighting me uh from a an elderly sister that was sitting in the congregation as I was preaching I was pricing and I I just fell a resistance it's like I couldn't I couldn't just find a way to go forward and something just came over me and I asked her if that that that that elderly sister understood what I was preaching they told me that she needed an interpreter for the the language she was speaking so I had an interpreter who was translating in a language that's spoken by most people so I asked another interpreter his son came but he had a difficulties uh trans interpreting and the one who was translating me in this other language who has never translated in the local language that that that woman was speaking in he came back he he he translated for me in that language and I was I started preaching really hard on seducing Spirits against all those little demon spirits to show that there's not any power can stand before the power of God can stand before the word of God we finished we we went our way and I was telling those that were with me on the way that I said I felt like there was something about that sister so the next day when I was coming back when I was preaching I noticed that the attitude of that sister changed that she was more a little more receptive that that she looked happy so I continue to preach and when I finished as we were getting ready to go his son came to see me he said um Mommy can't in reality she's a witch and she has a bunch of Witchcraft that her heart is beating and she can't she can no longer keep it and she want to take it so it can be burned I said there's no problem so they brought a really big uh uh bag filled with all kinds of Witchcraft it said oh this stick oh I use it to to hurt such and such this cloth over here I do this we burned she said she gave her heart to the Lord but we didn't have time to bring her to bapt to water baptism so I asked his son who was also a preacher there to organize the baptism for her so we went back to brazaville so the next day his son called me he said my mom didn't sleep I said what happened she said she told me that she dreamed about you like that night that you came to tell her that you didn't get out all your witchcraft stuff you have to take out everything in order for you to be here so now she came up with another B with with other witchcraft inside to say that the word of God there is no power that can resist before the word of God it's not our strength it's the word of God just the word of God he said in my name you shall cast out the devil then tonight all I need to say in the name of Jesus Christ has to be cast out demons have to obey to that voice because it's the word of God that it's not me saying that it's the word that says it says that that's what it that's what he gave that's what he gave every preacher every preacher who will believe him who will believe the power and the authority to break that spirit I believe with all my heart that every demon power that's here in this minute is already broken I do I believe that I believe there's a that I believe there's every sick person in here right now feels a lot different it says if if if that's right raise your up of your hand it says oh I
