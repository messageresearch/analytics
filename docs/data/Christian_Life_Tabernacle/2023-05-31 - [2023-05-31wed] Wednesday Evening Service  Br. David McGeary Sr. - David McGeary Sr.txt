Description:
Wednesday Evening Service (LIVE)
Br. David McGeary Sr.
May 31, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

see for we ask it this evening in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen Lord bless you this evening but he just want to Fellowship a little bit this evening uh uh I want to uh just read a little something I thought it was a marvelous thing we're going to listen a little bit of a sermon this evening called the Messiah about 34 minutes of the Messiah I was fellowshipping with brother Wade which is nice to have him and Heidi with us and I said you know by the way this is uh just one of those tapes where brother Brown makes just some tremendous observations and statements and I said I don't know what to call it brother white said well sometimes I call them what we call zingers you know he'll just say something it'll just come right at you well this has got some wonderful things in it that you should really be able to grab hold of and be blessed but in the beginning of this message brother Branham talks about uh a circumstance and I thought the conclusion of this circumstance was marvelous because I think it brings balance sometimes to what that we consider as faith we always think that faith is supposed to produce the result that we want you know America's if you would have believed it you know what I mean and you would say uh you know I'm really believed for this and if it didn't come to pass then your your answer to that would be well I must have not had enough faith and Satan uh sometimes beats us down this little story the way that brother Branham ends it uh I think is marvelous I think you can find it Brothers if they can read along but it starts about paragraph five um uh and this is in the Messiah preached in Shreveport uh January 17 1961. and then he says he says now we're happy to be here tonight and see so many out shining faces Harps open just a wonderful time isn't it amen and we are under expectation tonight I am that the Lord will make known to us tonight his power and glory and will show himself to us oh I I want to see him don't you and whether he does or does not then we will believe him just the same I now listen to this story I just left a little woman coming from Germany a few weeks ago she lost a baby and she was standing near in California once were they brought in a a little baby that had been dead died one morning about three or four o'clock the parents had drove all day and it was about three or four or five o'clock yes about six o'clock in the afternoon and the mother sitting back of the car holding this little cold form in her arms and when they came to the place where I was at San Bernardino they took the little baby and brought it to where I was standing and said oh how and I said well how long has the baby been dead and she said since this morning early and I picked up the little cold form it was already stiff and these people standing around I held them in my arms and prayed for to our precious Lord and I felt the baby was getting warm just holding it just a few minutes and it started to kick and cry and I handed it over to the mother now's when you ought to be shouting before he's gone hallelujah amen raised from the dead in our day glory to God hallelujah and I handed it over to the mother so then now see we don't make those things known see the things of it is there's too much glamor today and we're trying to have a big something to advertise something no it's not that at all the world will never receive it anyhow oh my that's hard to believe how you could raise the Dead and they wouldn't receive it that pretty but we know the Story of Lazarus and and he comes he says he comes to the church it's for the church the people of God these great glamorous things don't work in the kingdom of God people going to be surprised when they find out who is the believer and who is not you just can't put definitions on things sure you just got to be so true to your own heart be like it was when John came the first coming of Jesus there was an at the temple and John the Baptist and just a few that really was Believers really received it now we're looking for his coming the little mother standing there her baby died over in Germany her husband's a chaplain and they called up long distance about five times through the day and night to ask me to come so they know that God would raise that little baby up and I said let me go pray and when I prayed I prayed that afternoon then that night and I and I'll show you whether the doctors believe or not when the when she was already given the doctors my book to read I believe called a prophet visit South Africa something like that and she said God will raise the baby up the mother said God will raise the baby up and the baby had been dead for about they know about four or five hours so they got the father's word down to the base where he was and the baby had been dead died in the night and so the doctor said all right I'll tell you what I'll slip over and turn the oxygen back on and he let that baby lay there for two days without with the oxygen turned on waiting and I was over here praying and they was going to fly me across with a jet I could leave here with an army jet and be back the same day to Germany and one morning about daylight I got up and I laid there a little bit directed indirectly I heard something come into the room and I looked and there was something moving in the room and I jumped up and I said Lord what would you have your servant know and said do not rebuke that it's the hand of the Lord see so I got her on the phone and I said no God has called your baby so when so when she came over here to see us the night left her at the house when I left yesterday she said what was it brother Branham my weakness of faith and I said you have great faith you prayed for your baby and you and your husband held on to it held on to it God to raise the baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and you still love him that's real faith see Faith isn't based result and you you still he said and he said and you you still love him that's real faith anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you've got faith or not every son that cometh to God must be chastened and tried of God so remember our trials Works patience and patience Works hope and so forth so we just hold on to God whether He blesses us or not we are right there believing him anyhow because he promised it amen a Believer has no choice but to believe and they still love God the weather the because God knows best and they're never shaken by that one bit I thought what a what a real definition of Faith because Satan just Badgers us sometimes because oh I really believe this and it didn't happen and I really believe this and adapt he answered your prayer because he knew where you would be down the road do you believe he knows where you're going to be I believe he predestinated where you're going to believe I believe you're going to love this portion of tape if if it's not maybe necessarily uh the highest technical uh quality of of tape there is uh but it's uh it's um it just got some wonderful statements in it just like that statement that's real faith that that's real faith and it wasn't the faith to produce it was the faith to love God and accept God's Will and still love them that's real Faith so we're gonna we're gonna listen from paragraph 13. and and uh and the tape's called the Messiah and the prophet of God explains what a messiah is what the anointing is at and how it comes and we preached some of this Sunday night when I preached last Sunday night my brother Dennis will be with us this weekend and so but I wanted to go back and and hear have you listen to it so there's a lot in it so if you can just give 34 minutes of uh concentration and I think that you will uh hear some things that are they're just wonderful things that's all I can say the word of God excites me amen the word of God empowers you but everyone's going to talk a little bit about the conductor in this and not the railroad conductor but what conducts the power of God and the anointing of God and I think you'll really love it I think if you take this it'll fortify it'll strong you and you're going to see why this church will rise up with risk with uh life in its wings and the power of the Resurrection to do exceedingly and abundantly what we could ask or think and to have the greater work and that's because of the Messiah or the anointing so we're going to start in our Bibles we go ahead and stand uh John the first chapter the 40th to the 43rd verse and then John the fourth chapter the 24th 25th and 26th verse if you can get it on uh your phone or your tablet and then highlight it as you go I think you'll hear some wonderful things so the prophet of God said I just wanted to teach the church a little bit tonight so let's sit under the teaching of a real real prophet and the voice of God to our generation God bless you I really believe you'll enjoy and then we'll comment a little bit after and Worship the Lord amen God bless you in the reading if you'd like to Market and I've been used the last few weeks to speaking and marking down potions of scriptures now I got about four pages of them here I don't know how to ever get to them but if you'd like to do it while you're more than welcome I think sometimes now that the end is so now I thought maybe I'd just teach a little on the subject you might turn to Saint John the first chapter and we would read the first scripture out of the first chapter and the second scripture reading out of the fourth chapter of Saint John Saint John the first chapter and the 40th verse of the first chapter we read down to the 43rd and the fourth chapter we begin at the 24th 25th and 26th verse first chapter 41st one all the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first finds his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonas thou shall be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone and in the 24th verse of the fourth chapter we read this God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman said unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ and when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her eye that speak unto thee am he I want to take five lettered word from there for a text m-e-s-s-i-s Messiahs I want the subject tonight to be around the word the Messiah the word itself means the anointed one or it could be used the anointed king and and so means Christ but we're going to use it first in this thought of the anointed king it appears first in Genesis 3 15 if you want to put some scriptures down the promised seat of the woman which was to be the anointed one all through the scriptures all the prophets speak of that coming one the United king I like that word Anointed God anointing one and he was to be a king who was the lead Israel to freedom from all the nations and make them rulers over the Nations the anointed king wants to do that I believe that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled every description that all the prophets spoke of to be the Messiah amen I believe that the Isaiah 9 6 when the that Israel had asked for a sign God said I'll give them an everlasting sign a sign an eternal sign one that would be forever said a virgin shall conceive that'll be a sign and that one that will be born of her his name Shall be Called counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God and the Everlasting father and I believe that Jesus met every description of every promise that Jehovah made as the coming King and Messiah [Music] no matter how greatly many believe that he was defeated in his work he still is King he is a king now he's king of saints Revelation says so Thou King of saints he has a kingdom aren't you glad you belong in that Dominion tonight in the Dominion of the anointed one not only that but he's made us Kings and Priests unto God anointed ones unto God now although Jesus meeting all these qualifications and the Jews had read these promises for years how did it ever slip up on them and slip by without them seeing it those theologians so well read in the scriptures so particular about their scriptures and yet they failed to see him to be the anointed one it sounds though it could not have happened looks like they would anoint him so well versed but God blinded their eyes it shows that it was the hand of God he was too plainly known his signs of Messiah proved in to be Messiah proven to be the anointed one and for them to miss it it sure had to be the hand of God to Blind and that they did not miss it are they or where they would not have missed it rather and it's the same thing today if the gospel's hid it's here to them that are blind and the only way that they can receive sight is through God now Isaiah 9 6 we just won't read it but he was to be the Everlasting father the Mighty God [Music] when God made man in Genesis 1 26. it shows that you put that scripture down Genesis 1 26 it shows that God made man to be a God to begin with man was made to be a god a Lesser God he was made in the image and likeness of God he had hands like God he had feet like God eyes ears and intelligence like God this whole fiber because he was a son of Gods [Music] and the Jesus referred to him as God Jesus said how can you condemn me saying I'm the Son of God isn't it written your law that you're God's and if they call those Gods who the word of God came to you how can you condemn me when I say I'm the son of God he was referring to the prophets the anointed ones lest you're anointed Jesus was so anointed that he was more than a prophet Jesus is so anointed that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was God the prophets had the same kind of anointing only in a lesser condition I am in Genesis 1 26 when God made man he made him a God because he gave him a Dominion and he had rulership he had power over the birds of the air the cattle over the winds the waves the the fishes of the sea the everything he had dominion over everything he was a ruler anointed a ruler because he was in the likeness and in the image of God with an Earthly domain that's why the Bible says the Earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God the world is waiting for the man to come back into his right estate now he is the made in the image and likeness of God that makes his when God made him God give him some of his Spirit part of his life and he's in the likeness and the image of God therefore like here in um uh man in his natural condition way we are now you can see that he's much more than an animal as they try to say we are because man in his Fallen estate yet being a fallen Son of God he still can better himself he has an intelligence he builds himself a better house living conditions He makes himself better travel conditions he can speed himself through the air not 1900 miles an hour in a Jet Plane a rocket and he's he's made himself so he can almost travel around the world just in a 24 hours just set a light satellite in the air above the space of where the air is returning the orbit of the world and stands still and watch the world pass under him and go completely around in 24 hours you're standing still at one place won't the Aaron stand there come right back down and be home again you're standing above the revolving Earth where the Earth is pulling its current around making the winds and so forth the current world turning about round about close to 2500 miles an hour no I say about 1100 miles an hour 2500 miles around it is going around every 24 hours via bringing 1100 miles an hour and he goes up in the air and defies that stands above gravitation and stands there and watch the world pass around Henry smart intelligent and he's he's made up in the image and the likeness of God and in him is light now for instance when a man gets saved he's just about like the light that comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt that's when God comes into the inner part of a man in the inner part of a manner a man is made up in the system of a tabernacle in the outer courts then holy place and the holiest of holies the Shekinah Glory on the inside the Veil now on the outside Gates of a man is his five senses that enters to his body on the inside which is his soul are the the the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside of his heart produces his soul which makes the atmosphere around him he has also five entrances then on the inside he has only one gate one entrance to go into the Shekinah Glory where God can enter into him and take over in the control tower and that way is through self-will whether you will to or not that's up to you but that's the only Avenue that's open to the man that God can come into his heart is by self-will puts him right back like Adam and Eve on three moral agency again you can choose right or wrong either one you want to now self-will then God comes into the man into the heart which is a spirit then the spirit makes the soul and then the soul dwells in the body now when a man is converted say just like that little white button starts in his heart now that part is God God when he's born again with a spirit of God God's spirit dwells in him now as he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden Jesus said now in Mark 11 24 verely verily I send you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said that puts him right back Supreme again puts him right back in the condition now we're made up of light meters inside of us is Cosmic light now that Cosmic light is the light that they can take an x-ray with the X-ray doesn't come from the X-ray light it comes from your own life and then if that Cosmic light say it could be pushed to a place that we're not Cosmic light but Eternal Light come could dwell supremely to do our thinking do our walking do our talking that is no longer the man it's God in the man [Music] suppose I'm Death In You by this thing because I hear it rebound he's got an awful voice it isn't me it's this I see it lay it on to that now he's got life life eternal life is the light of God that dwells in the man yield to the spirit more he becomes unmanned sinner-like and becomes more Godlike you're not long ago they took an x-ray of a man praying for a sick man Reader's Digest wrote it up and found out a ray of light coming from one of the man not all of them but one of the man's hands reflected a ray of light when they put a piece of lead for her beneath the man's hand I guess you read yourself in England they turned the healers they called them loose to all the hospitals it was 80 percent more healing done by Divine Healing and medical cures that performed Reader's Digest picked it up over here that was a Newsweek and Reader's Digest picked it up and tried it and they find that there is a ray of light when this man sincerely not knowing they were doing him put his hands upon a man and pray to earn his prayer this is putting the X-ray down and found out a light coming from his hand God knew what he talked about when he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he knows what he was speaking of oh I want to see the church press into that place where he can come like God wants it to be then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was we become Messiahs little lights that's what the church is supposed to be light little anointed ones that's God's Church his standing light is the light our Messiah risen Christ in his people the anointed ones carrying forth his life into all the church ages sometimes it almost goes completely out then it comes back again God's anointed one God's Messiah Church if Messiah means the anointed one and means king then if the church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his Dominion so it is Messiah oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain the troubles today we've organized the church to death and we got organizations instead of Messiah we got russellite proselyte and all other kinds of light but we need Messiah what the church needs today the light of the Messiah or loving for his goodness now that is true God called [Music] Messiahs God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God like Jesus was God's high priest we become a lesser priest Jesus was God in fullness dwelt in him the shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconcile the world to himself and his God was in Christ reconcile the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some Messiahs the same things he did is in his church the same power he had in his church and his church becomes of his the Dominion and he's King over this dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name amen oh my there you are Messiahs Messiah X little Messiahs little anointed ones not an awful lot the main one anointed all for the great one oh when Jesus is on Earth they could not deny him being Messiah because he did the signs of the Messiah the Jews was blinded and that's the reason they didn't see him and see his signs as Messiah that's what's the matter with the church tonight it's blinded the outside world they can't see it because the God of this Earth is blinded their eyes to the things that are spiritual oh if we could only understand Jesus went about and did the signs of the Messiah and the people blasphemed him and if they blaspheme the great anointed king Messiah how much more will they call them of his household of his kingdom beelzebubs and whatever more they called him they call you worse than Holy Roller holy jumper something another they always got a scandal name for it because it comes from the Devil [Music] and they called them out of his household he said more than they if they called him that what would they call them of his household but still it makes just the same now you say you know brother Branham Jesus had the son and Messiah how do we know what was the sign well when he come the Bible said that when the Messiah come he would be a a prophet and would show signs of the Prophet any Scripture teacher knows that Moses said the Lord oh God shall raise up for profit like unto me and those when he performed those signs of showing himself like in the chapter four here when he told the woman she had five husbands she said sir I foresee that thou art a prophet we know the when a messiah comes he'll tell us all things he said I'm he that speaks to him she ran into the City and told all the men of the city come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this a very Messiah Jesus said himself if I do not the works on my father then believe me not if I claim to have the anointing and do not the works of God cause I am anointed by him with him it's not me that doeth the works that's the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works and if I do not them works then don't believe me but if I do and believe him now that was Pharma Messiah for a messiah it's the church here it comes are you ready Saint John 14 12 Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Messiah that's right Messiah f the representation our Messiah on Earth yet Mark 16 he said go in all the way preach the gospel the sign shall fall the Messiah he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe how far to all the world who too every creature oh I'm so glad how are you gonna rub the house said it just only to the disciples to the disciples he said to all the world and to every creature these signs shall follow them that believe I wonder where people don't believe in signs and wonders found the Believers how would you ever read the history of the church and think it ceased with the apostles the church ages I read the Nicene fathers and I see counsel all the ancient writers I could think of reading hosta's two Badlands and many of the other ancient books and all the ways down to the early Catholic Church down for the first 600 years after Christ that was ireneous Saint Martin Columbus and all of those every one of those saintly man they preached the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they preached the remission of sins they preached speaking in tongues they raised the dead they heal the sick signs and wonders followed them fall out to the Dark Ages Into the Dark Ages there's been a little minority all the way down keeping that gospel light shining what was it Messiahs once holy forth the representation of the Messiah Kingdom Jesus never failed he did just exactly what he's commissioned to do and he come to establish a kingdom and he did it for the power of the Holy Ghost brings God's spirit upon anointed Church to perform signs and wonders as he did to prove that Messiah is king of his kingdom amen I feel like shout a little bit myself now oh when there are so many people and come join this and we got the biggest we got this we got the most expensive what difference does that make all of that is folly and we'll perish but the kingdom of God is established in the heart by revelation of Jesus Christ and he set up on this rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it up on this revelation and to have the Revelation you become a Believer and believing these signs shall follow them that believe you see what Messiah is Messiah is the kingdom of God anointed ones their minority with the same Spirit he was anointed with he once said to him one day will my son set the right left hand he said can you drink the cup that I drink can you be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized with she said yay and he said you will but the kingdom to sit right left hand is not mine to give so it showed that we could drink the same cup of persecution because whatever it might be and still be baptized with the same Spirit he's baptized with so if he was called Messiah which he was because he was anointed with that Holy Spirit and any church that's a nausea with the same holy spirit is a messiah a littler smaller God and Sunday when this body is resurrected I hope beforehand that God can get a hold of a bunch of people that a manifest his power and ever the mission that is supposed to be him Messiah anointed one a King to deliver a Kings your Kings and Priests came to bring in Priest the minister tomb a messiah his signs was the father at all ages reflected his life his presence with his kingdom people now don't you don't have to die to get this you have to spiritually die but you don't have to physically die the inside is where God gets in to control you And he as he presses itself forward in you don't let any root of bitterness hatred malice strive that'll that'll run him right back again just get all the meanness and the superstitions and all the the unbelief out of you and every time you move out a little unbelief God steps out and takes over move after I believe he told Joshua everywhere the soldier your foot is set that I give to you and tonight as we enter into the kingdom God's kingdom taken out all the Philistine unbelievers and all the Amber rights and the malachites and whatever more throw it out of us like that we take possession I like that say days of Miracles has passed you aim right get out of me uh cut her footprint now took over there's no such a thing as as seeing visions get out of here you amalekite I'm coming over there you are you're pressing out from that little button is taking over the fibers of you spreading up God working through you in you around you no wonder Elijah lady's body up on that dead baby they come to life it was God in that man [Music] God it took over he was anointed Jesus said he was every prophet of God in the Old Testament was anointed with the Holy Ghost they were then they were lesser lights he was the fullness of God being Messiah there it was Messiah at sin smaller Messiahs for they were a naughty with the same spirit that he was anointed with only he had it in the fullness and every man today that's received the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is Anointed with the same spirit that Jesus of Nazareth was it went about doing good and Healing The Sick foreign [Music] that makes me feel good to know that he lives today there's something about a man he is a God he was made to be a god his purpose you're on Earth was to be a God to have a dominion over everything in the Earth oh my God don't let that stagger you because I got some more scriptures go down here here the other night I saw on a telecast of the name of psychic mental faith said a glass of water and stood back and kept concentrating on that glass of water until they bursted it just the concentration what's in that glass of water and the glass cracked in the water run out this pure mental consecration why that's his fibers that's his makeup if he can do that got a power in him by mental thinking that can break a glass of water in him being a sinner that shows that there was something made in that man he's in a fallen Fallen perverted condition but if that man can only get back to God and let God get into him why would that power turn loose of the kingdom of God he didn't have no conductor he was like a shotgun he just splattered everlane but if that Spirit that's in a man could be converted and put Christ in there okay where he's got a conductor a conductory is a wire that conducts it amen and let a man in with that same faith in the conductor of the word of God he can raise a dead pencil after his cast out Devils amen he's fashioned like a god he looks like God sure was that's reason God was man man was God and this is his offspring's man he's only trying to get a hold of man trying to get man into his hand now not conductors not at all theology is the right kind of conductor you know there's a lot of theologies as an insulator in front of it got loud churches says the days of Miracles is passing no such thing as Divine Healing on the devil speak in tongues now that's an insulator you don't want nothing like that get away from that [Music] the word is God's conductor a man that believes in God's word has God's word stands as high as these buildings around here when he walks out on it it's a boss it conducts the man it conducts the spirit when in Thailand's made up to have a great faith what makes a priests here at this Tabernacle some time ago on thirsting for life what makes a woman want to get out here and rock and roll what makes a boy a young teenage kid want to do that and not only that but Grandpa and Grandma what are they doing for her what makes him go out here why does people want to act the way they do it's because they were made the first for something and they was made to thirst but the thirst after God and they're trying to hush that Holy Thirst by letting the devil power what he calls Pleasures on it you'll never never satisfy until God comes in and takes control [Music] You Can Dance you can drink you can commit adultery you can do whatever you want to and you'll wake up headache and someday in hell but the reason you do that is because you were made in the image of God the thirst after God couples to get in there almost let his word come into you and use it as a conductor God said so like Abraham God said you're going to have a baby I know you're going to have it God said so you're 100 years old how can you have it God said so he was anointed hey man he was anointed and he had the word and the Word was the Lord and it was a conductor to leading to the baby amen or woman tonight or take that same word of God by stripes we were healed let the anointing the Messiah come upon you that conductor leads you right straight to your healing salvation oh [Music] they The Thirst made for God and the devil tries to pervert you make you I think you're having a good time out here keep you blinded like he does did the Jews until the time that you cross a separating line and then you're finished it's by word this nation is today and not only this and but others the world won't believe it the Bible said in second Timothy 3. that in the last station that they would be heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are Messiahs treaty heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than Lover's God having a farm of godliness don't you never look for this big high type evangelism a thing to do anything that's not God's way of doing it he came to his own his own received enough he was small he didn't why he lived out there in Palestine all of his life you're in I'll say 80 percent of people never know he was there but he sent to the church he was sent to the people that he was going to receive he wrote his own his own knows him my sheep know my voice don't let that go over Shreveport please hold that my sheep know my voice by my word my word if it's taught and don't declare the same thing that I did that's the wrong conductor besideship so where's the eagle is we know that and um how we say in the man's the man for I'll leave that subject the man what is he he's got a hand like God eyes like God got ears like God got a body like God what'd you think Hallelujah amen little Messiah Hallelujah why because you're annoying it why the conductor leads you right to the Fountain the word inside of you what a wonderful wonderful glorious thing that we have that God has for us something that that is in you it's like I love it it's just like that button it just grows up and the more that you clean out and the more you get rid of unbelief and the more the more that he comes in the more that he anoints you with the same anointing he has the works that I do you shall do also it's your fiber but wasn't that something about that man being able to break the glass he said if he could do that with mental power what what do you think you could do with the right mental attitude towards every word of God that you clay claim on that that's me I'm a Believer I I am oh why we're almost afraid to say I'm a little God but you were made in His image you were made to be Gods you were you you're made to do this you're made that's why you created you amen now we're in battle with the perverter we're in battle with the liar we're in battle with the the one who takes this word of God and and uses it as an insulator do you know what I mean or or a substitute to give you something other than the the same exact anointing that was in him in you and you to do the exact same word and he said if it don't line up with that conductor then it's the wrong anointed just think we've been given the word of God we've been given the spirit of God when these two when the word and the Spirit come together it produces eternity in each and every one of us okay do you realize how much power you're packing I mean you look at yourself just the way the word looked at you tonight what what is a messiah it's one that has Dominion yeah right power dominion over you see something in your family that's not right you don't like you've got dominion and power over that spirit amen you got you've got you've got a promise like Abraham Abraham said God said so right that was the word that word was the conductor that brought the anointing to him to believe it and he stayed with it and believed it and it led him right to the baby oh I'd like to just stay on that for just an hour right there because that word conductor the word is the conductor if you believe the word that conductor that word that you believe brings that anointing on you to bring that word to pass it led to the baby he believed God he was going around testifying he's going to have a baby as long as the word was there and the conductor was there the anointing was there to anoint him to believe every promise of God and every son and daughter of God is Anointed to believe every promise of God you are anointed for this message you were anointed to believe this message you heard that word that word came to you you believed it and that conductor of the word brought the anointing of this message right into your life to do the same signs and wonders that you did it don't have to be a big show but you know you've got Dominion a Son of God he said is like a Mystic he walks in a world all of his own and he has power and dominion over every circumstance in every situation all right because he's got something that's uh you know what a conductor is it's like a a wire so it's like having electricity everywhere you can have all kinds of electricity but it never gets to do anything intelligence channels write down a conductor and then it produces what that electricity was sent for to produce and you've got that power be living right in you the anointed Church the anointed Messiahs I like that I mean it makes me feel good too you know I'm not I'm not always just a sinner just the sinner you're just a sinner yes yeah I I I I was just a sinner that's exactly what I was I was away from God I could break glasses you know what I mean I could I could study and go into all the Realms of of the knowledge and everything against here but that's not what I was made for I was made to have the same anointing he had that's why he came and paid the price he paid the price of all you can put all the stuff all the amorites out and everything else you have the title deed and you can go back and have what you were in the beginning this is where we're at church they've got the conductor you understand until the seals were open right man didn't just excuse my crudeness right but it's like you have a conductor an extension cord you might consider it as a conductor you know what I mean if it's something that the power comes down well you've got this extension cord and you're trying to plug it into everything in the world but one day you plug it into the word and that that power comes down that extension toward the extension cords the word so you plug into that word then all the power that's in the word of God comes into you it is a conductor that comes and anoints you the electricity is the anointing that comes in you can anoint you can now you have it to perform that which the word said you would do every promise in this book's mine every chapter every verse is every line then you don't have to be afraid Africa says go man you'll come to me on my day and said look I did this and I did that he said I never knew you they never were plugged in to the word you know he talked about tongues okay anybody in here have to give the tongues well I'll tell you what we're gonna do we're gonna start opening our church on Saturday morning so those of you that have the gift of tongues and the gift of interpretations in tongues you've got a hold of the conductor and the spirit of God's come in your life and you could come together and we'll prophesy and we'll speak in tongues we'll write the messages down and then and then we'll bring it to the church and it'll it'll come to pass you don't have to be afraid of that you know the prophet of God put people he said is it okay he said okay he said a woman's forbidden to speak in tongues in the church because that's what he's how many knows he said that you know he said it he said that he's got a woman's foreign what about him he says well that's okay but do it in order you know I come together if you could wait on the Lord the Lord gives you a message in tongues or interpretation or a prophecy you do it there's a time and there's a season for everything but let me tell you something you are anointed Messiah 24 hours a day that's what the baptism of the holy spirit is it's the anointing of the word on you to manifest the word and flesh in you is wonderful church it's glorious okay there's no fear in the Lord Jesus he's with you he'll use you he doesn't and we're not going to put a a a five-fold Ministry we're not going to put a Nickelodeon ISM in it we're not going to say these men are anointed to do these and the rest of the people aren't he said every single one of us was Messiah Lil gods book for whatever world you're in whatever you come against whatever situations you rise up for you're not only there for your life but you're there for the lives of everybody that you come in contact with you have that voltage power of the word of God in you that you can shock somebody I like that shock them with the blessings of God shock them with the power of God look you're elected you're chosen for it oh I just think it's wonderful it just makes me happy okay I know you'll probably go back and finish listening to the tape it's got some wonderful discernment at the end it's just a beautiful understanding but I just thought there was a lot of little wonderful things in there about faith and about who we are and and and what God's doing with us and I hope that you can re rejoice in that then the word make you rejoice just what he says that's the Fountain of Life just what he says the word don't need no help amen but don't you love to worship Him the prophet of God said after the word comes he says that's the time to worship and and so I don't know if you have to go but if you don't have to go I'm just going to ask brother Billy to come and I'll say a prayer and then we can just Worship the Lord and and let him move in your heart and and let them flow through you and if if a well he's flowing through if an Amorite shows up throw them out if a Philistine shows up throw them out you know take possession of your Dominion take possession of your kingdom you know you know I've had this tooth problem and and so they did surgery so the doctor he gave me these pills to uh you know kill the pain and so you take this pill and every uh um what do you say every uh six hours or something you take this bill for this pain and I was popping these pills and I thought you know something I I I I'm I'm in a uh excuse the expression but if they say prayer I'm going to get somebody to pray for me every six hours foreign getting the brothers to pray

tooth brothers would you pray for my tooth brother would you pray for my tooth do you want me to pray for yes pray for my tooth so I took prayer pills Hallelujah they work they work try prayer pills they're really good okay try to if you're down go find another Messiah amen give them the presents talk about the word let it bubble up if you're if you're away if you're away from God okay draw an eye on to God the scripture says you draw nine to him he'll draw nigh unto you I yeah I don't care if people I like Paul said you say what I want you can call me whatever you want but I've seen yeah the power of the Resurrection hey man I've seen Devils cast out yes I never cast it out a devil yet I've seen him cast out Deli I've never healed anybody yet but I've seen him heal people I've seen people because the people grabbed the conductor and the conductor LED them right to their healing and I've watched the anointing of God's word when they grabbed that conductor I walk the anointing of God's word come down and deliver people from cancers from sicknesses from all manner of problems all manner of conditions he said it'll save you it'll deliver you it'll do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think because there's power in God's word and that's what I told you last Sunday if you don't come back and Link it to the conductor it'll it'll go and then you're always running after it you're always running after it but once you got it and you take possession of it and you know that you're ordained for these works Hallelujah Hallelujah it's wonderful I'll
