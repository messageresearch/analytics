[55:01] you.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you. I mean, it's
[55:05] nice to be home.
[55:20] You didn't want to do those steps, huh?
[55:24] Oh my.
[55:27] Yeah.
[55:28] You know, none of us just came into this
[55:32] world growed up, you know. So every time
[55:35] I see a little kid, I just it just my
[55:38] mind tries to go back. It was, you know,
[55:40] certainly I wasn't like that, you know.
[55:43] But uh uh yeah, but anyway, I it's happy
[55:48] to be home and um uh I I think this
[55:53] morning if
[55:56] you have any
[55:59] spirituality at all, you'll kind of
[56:01] catch the
[56:03] how my trip went according to what that
[56:07] we
[56:08] uh share with you this morning. But um
[56:13] um we want to uh fellowship this
[56:18] morning, listen to a little less than
[56:22] uh 20 minutes of a message called the
[56:25] way of a true prophet.
[56:28] And uh after that uh we play this, we'll
[56:32] make a few comments to you. But uh and
[56:38] uh so we've been preaching uh quite a
[56:42] bit on what is our path forward.
[56:47] In other words, we've come this far.
[56:51] What do we need to do to go forward with
[56:55] the Lord?
[56:57] We just don't want to set up a camp and
[57:02] become content
[57:04] in um
[57:08] uh and complacent
[57:11] and where things just become common to
[57:14] us and our life becomes routine.
[57:18] And uh one of the things that we're
[57:21] counseledled
[57:23] to have in this generation is ISAV
[57:28] that we might see.
[57:30] And uh the age is a age where the
[57:35] eyesight becomes dim
[57:38] and the people become dull of hearing
[57:43] and uh and and so we're always fighting
[57:48] the spirit of our age.
[57:52] And there's only one way to fight
[57:55] anything
[57:57] and that's with the weapons that God
[58:00] gave you to fight with.
[58:03] Um your own devices will not work. Uh
[58:09] even though your motive is correct, your
[58:12] objective is good, what that you want to
[58:16] accomplish is the right thing. But if
[58:20] you don't use what God gave you to
[58:23] achieve that accomplishment,
[58:26] you'll find yourself failing.
[58:29] And then your failure
[58:32] comes back on you. And then you begin to
[58:36] feel less worthy. You begin to feel like
[58:40] you're a failure. Um and you begin to
[58:43] lose your confidence.
[58:45] But if we could place our confidence in
[58:49] the word,
[58:51] regardless of how it seems not to fit
[58:57] the circumstance, the way we perceive
[59:00] it, but yet the word of God never fails.
[59:04] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
[59:07] word will not pass away.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you have your Bibles, let's
[59:12] stand and open to the book of Amos.
[59:19] And we want to turn to in the book of
[59:22] Amos to the uh second chapter of the
[59:28] book of Amos.
[59:30] And we want to read the fourth verse.
[59:41] And I I I I truly recommend uh if you're
[59:46] a
[59:49] a type of person that likes to follow
[59:51] the ministry and and and follow the
[59:54] subject matter and and the direction
[59:58] that we're going here, um uh I I I
[1:00:03] strongly recommend that you take the
[1:00:06] time this week and listen to the sermon.
[1:00:10] Uh it's uh called the way of a true
[1:00:14] prophet. It was preached in 62 and 63.
[1:00:20] We're going to be listening to the
[1:00:22] portion out of 63
[1:00:27] this morning, but we'll make some quotes
[1:00:29] out of 62.
[1:00:31] But anyway, I think that it's a very
[1:00:35] timely sermon. So, let us read in Amos.
[1:00:39] And it says in Amos,
[1:00:42] it says, "Thus saith the Lord,
[1:00:47] for three transgressions of Judah,
[1:00:51] and for four, I will not turn away the
[1:00:56] punishment thereof,
[1:00:59] because thou hast despised the law of
[1:01:03] the Lord, and have not kept his
[1:01:07] commandments."
[1:01:09] and their lies cause them to heir
[1:01:13] after the which their fathers have
[1:01:17] walked. Heavenly Father, bless your word
[1:01:20] to us. In your precious name we pray.
[1:01:23] Amen. Amen. You may be seated. We know
[1:01:26] the story of Amos. We know that he was a
[1:01:30] prophet. Some refer to him as a minor
[1:01:34] prophet, but yet he had a major message.
[1:01:38] and he's in the days of Jeroboam and uh
[1:01:43] and he comes forth out of the wilderness
[1:01:48] uh because the Lord spoke to him and he
[1:01:51] comes and prophesies
[1:01:53] to Israel and Judah. And so we're going
[1:01:59] to pick it up with the our messenger
[1:02:02] picking up the story and bringing it to
[1:02:06] our day.
[1:02:08] So, as we listen, we're just going to
[1:02:10] listen to a short portion,
[1:02:12] but as he begins to preach, he makes
[1:02:15] this comment. Let's take Amos and bring
[1:02:19] him into our day.
[1:02:22] How many believes the word's unchanging?
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Satan is the same devil
[1:02:29] he was, but he just has tactics. And he
[1:02:33] knew he was going to get to mankind by
[1:02:37] using three major things: civilization,
[1:02:42] education, and science.
[1:02:45] He was going to use those three things
[1:02:48] to try to defeat the church of the
[1:02:52] living God. And every time that the
[1:02:56] church begins to get away from God, God
[1:03:00] raises up a voice. And we know that
[1:03:03] we've heard a voice in this last day.
[1:03:06] And that's the reason all of us are here
[1:03:10] today is not over the personality of a
[1:03:13] preacher, not over a
[1:03:16] um a style of preaching, but we're we're
[1:03:20] here because we've heard a voice. We've
[1:03:24] we've heard of something that struck our
[1:03:28] heart. And it didn't even matter if you
[1:03:31] were raised in the message and your
[1:03:34] parents were believers. Eventually, you
[1:03:37] hear that voice for yourself and you
[1:03:41] know it's true. You're thankful for your
[1:03:43] parents that they heard the voice. uh
[1:03:47] many of us I refer to as 11th hour
[1:03:50] workers that you're hearing the same
[1:03:52] message, the same reward uh that I heard
[1:03:56] 50ome years ago. Uh and I I understand
[1:04:01] and see more in the message today than I
[1:04:04] did when I started. But so it's such a
[1:04:07] blessing that the word of God is so
[1:04:09] rich. So if you just join with me for a
[1:04:12] few moments this morning and let us
[1:04:15] listen to uh just a few moments of this
[1:04:20] wonderful message uh
[1:04:24] um the way of a true
[1:04:28] prophet and think of that today because
[1:04:30] that's what we want to talk about is the
[1:04:33] way. So, it's the way forward and now
[1:04:37] we're talking about the way of a
[1:04:40] prophet. So, this morning we're talking
[1:04:42] about a way. So, God bless you as we
[1:04:46] listen for these next few minutes. Amen.
[1:04:50] Starting on paragraph 91,
[1:04:53] uh, and I believe the it's 119
[1:04:57] 63, the way of a true prophet. Pick up
[1:05:00] the story here. God bless you.
[1:05:04] I wonder today now that if Amos would
[1:05:07] come to us,
[1:05:10] would we receive him today? Would
[1:05:13] Phoenix receive Amos
[1:05:17] if somewhere up across the mountain here
[1:05:20] somewhere or down from some part of the
[1:05:22] country came a little rugged dressed
[1:05:25] fella like that could walk in here and
[1:05:29] call the ministers to order and say I
[1:05:33] have the word of the Lord.
[1:05:36] Do you think we would receive it?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Certainly not. The first thing we ask
[1:05:41] him, "What group are you with?"
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; And what if he'd turn around and say,
[1:05:48] "The heavenly group."
[1:05:51] That would kind of be foreign to us,
[1:05:52] some praise.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; But that's the way it was then. And it
[1:05:59] perhaps be the same way today if Amos
[1:06:02] come on the scene.
[1:06:04] Let's just for the sake of what I've
[1:06:07] said transport him here just a few
[1:06:09] moments and see what we think he would
[1:06:11] do. You know what he'd do? I believe he
[1:06:15] would disagree with our whole setup.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He would disagree with our
[1:06:23] denominational doctrines.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; He would condemn Methodist, Baptist,
[1:06:28] Presbyterian, Lutheran, Catholic, and
[1:06:30] Pentecostals. You take the whole thing.
[1:06:34] certainly would.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; He would disagree with their
[1:06:39] denominational doctrines.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; He would go straight to the fundamental
[1:06:44] foundation of the word and start right
[1:06:47] on the word.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; He would begin his campaign upon thus
[1:06:53] sayaeth the Lord.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? You think Phoenix would
[1:07:00] receive it?
[1:07:02] You think Louisville would receive him?
[1:07:05] New York, Boston, Massachusetts, or
[1:07:07] wherever it might be, California?
[1:07:10] No, sir. That had the little fell in
[1:07:13] jail as quick as they could get him
[1:07:14] there.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Certainly would.
[1:07:18] They would certainly do that. If he went
[1:07:20] back to the word, I'm sure they would
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; because every group would disagree with
[1:07:25] him. Yeah,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; it wouldn't be a one agree with him
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; because they have to hold to their
[1:07:30] traditions in order to disagree with the
[1:07:32] word.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; We'd have to remember that he is a true
[1:07:38] prophet. If he been if he was a prophet
[1:07:41] sent from God, he would be one mark to
[1:07:44] him, one definite mark that we know he
[1:07:47] is a prophet, he would stay with the
[1:07:50] word
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; because that's where the word of God
[1:07:53] came was to the prophets.
[1:07:55] You know what he would do? He would
[1:07:58] blast and condemn
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; this generation.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; He would condemn every Bob Dared woman
[1:08:06] in the country.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; He would condemn every denominational
[1:08:11] preacher.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; He certainly would.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; He would condemn every cigarette smoker.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Every woman that wore shorts or slacks,
[1:08:21] he'd tear them apart.
[1:08:24] Why? It's against the word.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; You think we would receive him? By no
[1:08:31] means.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't receive it. He'd condemn
[1:08:34] the immorals of the church.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; He'd shake that little old wrinkled
[1:08:39] finger in that preacher's face and say,
[1:08:40] "You mean to tell me that you call
[1:08:43] yourself anointed servant of God and
[1:08:45] will stand in the pullpit and let your
[1:08:48] women dre sexy sexy among your men and
[1:08:50] things like that. Let your young women
[1:08:52] rise up like that. You'll permit your
[1:08:54] man to marry two or three times to be
[1:08:56] deacons in the churches. You mean to
[1:08:58] tell me that you'll hold on to that
[1:09:00] credential that you got in your hand and
[1:09:02] turn aside the word of God? Oh my
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:08] blast.
[1:09:10] Yes, sir.
[1:09:12] The immorality of the church and the
[1:09:15] immorality of the members. It blasted
[1:09:18] mine. every member he'd tear down. Every
[1:09:22] man-made seminary doctrine, he'd tear
[1:09:25] the thing to pieces.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Now, could you receive a man like that?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; No, they wouldn't do it. They certainly
[1:09:32] wouldn't do it. They'd get that fell out
[1:09:35] of town as quick as they could.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; While the association be meeting
[1:09:39] together and say, "Say, we got to do
[1:09:40] something about this. Tell your
[1:09:41] congregation not to go there."
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; They hear that, you know.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, we would not receive him. By no
[1:09:48] means they wouldn't receive him.
[1:09:50] Certainly they couldn't do it. Listen to
[1:09:53] him blast. Oh, I like it. You hear it.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; I'm looking right down on what he said.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "The very God that you claim to
[1:10:04] serve will destroy you."
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; You'd say that same thing today.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; We Americans has wrapped oursself in so
[1:10:14] much of fantastic things.
[1:10:17] so much big buildings and big uh numbers
[1:10:21] in our organizations.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; And all this fine popularity and
[1:10:26] seminary ministers who's trained up to
[1:10:29] hold their peace and say nothing about
[1:10:31] because afraid they'd be exccommunicated
[1:10:33] from the church.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Certainly you'd blast that thing to
[1:10:40] pieces because it's against the word.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Certainly would.
[1:10:44] And the very God that we claim to serve
[1:10:47] will will burn this thing off one of
[1:10:50] these days. He'll blast it to pieces.
[1:10:54] Amos wouldn't change his words if he's
[1:10:56] here today.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Stay right back to the word.
[1:11:01] Oh, what you listening at him telling
[1:11:03] there, God loved you. He brought you. He
[1:11:06] made you a chosen people.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear him in a Pentecostal
[1:11:10] church one time.
[1:11:13] You believe his aim was made get off my
[1:11:15] back then for a while.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, he would tell them.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; He'd pull punches.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; He'd blast it just as hard as he could.
[1:11:25] And tell them where they'd fallen short
[1:11:26] of the word, the God that brought you
[1:11:29] out of these
[1:11:31] homemade man-made margs
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; years ago, 50 years ago. your fathers
[1:11:37] and mothers came out of these systems
[1:11:40] that bound up and got the world into
[1:11:43] them and your God sent his mercy down
[1:11:47] and called you out
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; away from the sin and stuff that's that
[1:11:52] was in the church
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; and now you've turned right back around
[1:11:57] like Samaria did that God brought them
[1:11:59] out from them countries and they turned
[1:12:01] right back around and he made an
[1:12:02] alliance with that country
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; how we are today trying to compete with
[1:12:08] those big denominational churches. We're
[1:12:11] building bigger schools.
[1:12:14] Well, we don't need big schools.
[1:12:17] It's all right. I ain't got nothing to
[1:12:18] say against it. But every time that you
[1:12:20] take a founder or leader that goes forth
[1:12:24] in his day, well, he'll do good in his
[1:12:27] day, but as soon as he's gone, then
[1:12:29] they'll build an organization over the
[1:12:31] top of his work. Then they'll get a
[1:12:33] bunch of little Rickys in there and
[1:12:34] Elvis's and the first thing you know
[1:12:36] they twist the thing to make it suit
[1:12:38] themselves. And then this other comes
[1:12:39] up. He injects something else because
[1:12:41] he's a great intellectual student out of
[1:12:44] Harvard somewhere or something. And the
[1:12:46] first thing they begin to eject this and
[1:12:48] take this out and say this didn't mean
[1:12:49] that and that. You're right back in the
[1:12:51] same old rut again. Yes. If Amos is your
[1:12:54] he blast the thing right straight to the
[1:12:56] ground.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] He never built his campaign upon how
[1:13:01] many churches he could get to cooperate
[1:13:03] with him. He never built his church upon
[1:13:06] some certain organization or some
[1:13:07] sectarian parts of the church. The thing
[1:13:11] he do build his campaign up on thus
[1:13:14] sayeth the Lord.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; God would back him up as he always did.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Prove that is right.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; He said there's trouble turmoils in your
[1:13:24] church. What would he say today? What
[1:13:27] would he say with that word of God
[1:13:28] hanging out here before us? Second
[1:13:31] Timothy 3 said they be heady,
[1:13:34] high-minded,
[1:13:35] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:13:37] God,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; truce breakers, false accusers,
[1:13:40] incontinent, and despisers of those that
[1:13:43] are trying to live right.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness, but would
[1:13:47] deny the power thereof. You think a
[1:13:50] prophet could rise on the scene and
[1:13:51] bypass that prophecy?
[1:13:54] You say it's fulfilled in your eyes this
[1:13:56] day.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; How that the church would get formal and
[1:14:01] how the things they would do, he'd he'd
[1:14:03] bring to your memory those words of God.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; He'd bring to your memory what God said
[1:14:09] he'd do in this day
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; when Amos rolls on the scene. Not only
[1:14:13] that, but God would prove by Amos
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; what he promised to do
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; in this day.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Certainly he would. He did it in that
[1:14:21] day. He's always done it.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Certainly, we would not receive Amos if
[1:14:26] he rose on the scene. Now, how that form
[1:14:30] of God
[1:14:34] in the choirs and and around great long
[1:14:37] robed choirs and and sang like angels
[1:14:41] and danced the next night like devils.
[1:14:44] That's
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:14:46] It's exactly the truth.
[1:14:50] Some come out with great long robes on
[1:14:53] flowerly looking like that and look like
[1:14:56] some kind of an angelic being and stand
[1:14:59] up there and deny the word like any evil
[1:15:02] spirit would.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness but would
[1:15:06] deny the power thereof.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Go talk about the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:11] Ghost said why he running out of the
[1:15:14] church.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Why? He has to. But they'll stand in
[1:15:19] these churches and let their members in
[1:15:22] the basement do the twist and rock and
[1:15:24] roll.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Now, our so-called YMCA, I wonder what
[1:15:30] that C stands for. Walk into them, you
[1:15:33] can't even hardly hear nothing but the
[1:15:34] Lord's name. You is that the young man's
[1:15:36] cursing society?
[1:15:40] I stayed not long ago in a hotel was
[1:15:42] across from the YW.CA CA. And it was a
[1:15:45] disgrace to see them little girls out
[1:15:47] there on the floor till about 9:00
[1:15:49] trying to break their legs and doing the
[1:15:51] twist.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. And
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; all of members of a church sang in
[1:15:59] choirs and taught Sunday school.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Nothing but the devil takes them little
[1:16:05] children out there on the floor. A
[1:16:07] system that's been made up called
[1:16:08] religion.
[1:16:10] Certainly a true prophet would blast
[1:16:12] that thing right back into the smoke of
[1:16:14] hell where it originated at.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Certainly is true.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; You think Amos could stand on the
[1:16:24] platform and preach the gospel and look
[1:16:25] out over a bunch of bobbed women and not
[1:16:28] condemn it?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; You think he wouldn't quote Isaiah 5 and
[1:16:34] 1 Corinthians 14 and all, wouldn't he?
[1:16:36] Wouldn't he pour that on? Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Certainly you would
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; walk down the streets and see women with
[1:16:43] these little clothes on. Look like man's
[1:16:45] so tight that the skins on the outside
[1:16:48] almost going down twisting, mincing,
[1:16:50] walking like that, drinking theirelves
[1:16:52] along. And you think a man of God
[1:16:54] wouldn't stand a pull pit and blast that
[1:16:57] thing
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; when it's very sel ever spoke from from
[1:17:01] the pull pit. And that's in Pentecostal
[1:17:04] churches, too.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. would make no
[1:17:08] difference to Amos
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; some he'd be one that would say he
[1:17:12] wouldn't be afraid because he was
[1:17:14] anointed of the Lord and if he had thus
[1:17:17] sayeth the Lord it would have to be the
[1:17:19] word of the Lord
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; he'd come to Samaria not to look at
[1:17:23] their glamour to count how many
[1:17:25] organizations and how many numbers they
[1:17:27] had as I said the other night it seems
[1:17:30] to be today that the whole church is
[1:17:32] built upon the main thing amongst the
[1:17:35] brethren today uh the churches is
[1:17:37] numbers. Numbers. One trying to outdo
[1:17:40] the other one.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Numbers. God don't count numbers. He
[1:17:44] counts character.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Character is what God looking to find
[1:17:48] somebody he could get his hands.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody will stand still long
[1:17:54] enough.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; We said decisions all year. We had so
[1:17:59] many decisions. That's stones,
[1:18:01] confessions. And what good is a stone
[1:18:03] without a stonemason with a sharp word
[1:18:06] of God to cut him into a son of God or a
[1:18:08] daughter of God and placed him in the
[1:18:10] church where he belongs.
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Rolling up stones won't make the
[1:18:16] building. You got to cut them and shape
[1:18:17] them.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; We need man today, anointed man like
[1:18:23] Amos was that would cut the world away
[1:18:26] from that woman and make her a daughter
[1:18:27] of God. Cut that world away from the man
[1:18:30] regardless of how many trustees do not
[1:18:33] or any other stand on dust sayaeth the
[1:18:35] Lord.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't receive Amos. I don't think
[1:18:44] like this.
[1:18:46] What do you think Amos to do when he
[1:18:48] walked into a Pentecostal church today?
[1:18:53] claims to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; and then see that same thing in the
[1:18:58] Pentecostal church
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; that claims to be led by the Holy
[1:19:02] Spirit.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; I wonder
[1:19:06] we can talk about the Baptist and
[1:19:07] Methodist and the Lutheran, but when it
[1:19:09] comes to our own dirty door, then what
[1:19:12] about that?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Gotten away from the word of God.
[1:19:18] Something went wrong somewhere.
[1:19:22] It's exactly right.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They come and do all these
[1:19:27] different things and claim to be led in
[1:19:29] the spirit, dance in the spirit,
[1:19:33] sometimes even speak with tongues. I
[1:19:35] believe in speaking with tongues. I
[1:19:37] believe in dancing in the spirit. I
[1:19:39] believe in shouting.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; But there's a lot more goes with that.
[1:19:44] That's
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; right. If you do all those things and
[1:19:46] deny the word, then there's something
[1:19:49] wrong somewhere. got the wrong spirit.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; God doesn't lead his people to such
[1:19:56] things anyhow.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; No, he doesn't.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I think it's a time. It's just about
[1:20:01] another coming out party.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Another Boston Tea Party has to say the
[1:20:06] church needs one.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; It needs a real good cleaning up.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; When Jonah Bart the days gone by, the
[1:20:14] Catholic Church missed knowing that she
[1:20:16] was a saint. when she's living because
[1:20:18] she saw visions, could interpret dreams.
[1:20:21] A spiritfilled woman and God used the
[1:20:24] little lady and they thought she was a
[1:20:27] witch and they burn her to a stake as a
[1:20:29] witch. You know that the Catholic
[1:20:30] priests did that themselves. Hundreds of
[1:20:33] years passed and they found out she was
[1:20:34] a saint. Then when they go to canonize
[1:20:37] her, they had to do penance. So they dug
[1:20:39] up those priests body and filled them in
[1:20:40] the river to do penance. You see it
[1:20:43] passed right by and they failed to see
[1:20:45] it. They done it pretty. The same thing
[1:20:46] with St. Patrick and all the rest of
[1:20:48] them. No wonder Jesus said, "You garnish
[1:20:50] and make white the tombs of the prophets
[1:20:52] and you're the one that put them in
[1:20:54] there."
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; What we need today is Amos
[1:21:00] to bring back the word of the Lord to
[1:21:01] us. Certainly does. Now, our claims and
[1:21:06] things doesn't mean nothing unless the
[1:21:08] spirit of God is there to back up our
[1:21:10] claims.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; If our lives don't compare with our
[1:21:14] claims, then there's something wrong.
[1:21:16] Jon of Arc led France to a
[1:21:18] revolutionary. They needed a
[1:21:20] revolutionary. It's exactly what they
[1:21:22] did. They needed a revolutionary. She
[1:21:24] led it. But after the revolutionary
[1:21:26] where the mistake was made, they needed
[1:21:28] a counterrevolutionary to straight to
[1:21:30] straighten up what they was revoling
[1:21:31] about. I say the Pentecostal church is
[1:21:34] the closest thing I know to the Bible
[1:21:36] today.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't, I'd be in some other.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be standing here wasting my
[1:21:44] time speaking to the Pentecostal people
[1:21:46] if I didn't think there was a hoax.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Pentecost is right. But when we need
[1:21:52] Pentecost to get together and our
[1:21:54] traditions broke down, then we need a
[1:21:56] counter revolution. We need a counter
[1:21:59] coming. They got not a Pentecostal claim
[1:22:01] but a Pentecostal clean coming.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; God's holy.
[1:22:09] They that live by him must live holy.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; He is a holy God.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Without holiness, no
[1:22:18] man shall see the Lord."
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; His life is holy. And if his life is in
[1:22:25] you, it makes you holy.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Without it, you don't see the Lord. And
[1:22:29] look where she's drifting to.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; We are something like Israel was in
[1:22:34] those days old. Israel thought because
[1:22:36] that they were prospering, everything
[1:22:38] was going good.
[1:22:41] They had an alliance in their days with
[1:22:43] the other cities and they had an
[1:22:45] alliance. The government had an alliance
[1:22:47] with the ministers, with the priests,
[1:22:50] with the prophets. They thought this was
[1:22:52] all right. They thought that was just
[1:22:53] pleasing to the Lord. But they had a
[1:22:55] little fellow that raised up and brought
[1:22:57] him back again.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Right? Just because it prospered. That's
[1:23:02] where we make a mistake. Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Prosperity is no sign of spiritual
[1:23:08] blessing.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Not a bit, is it? Prosperity sometimes
[1:23:15] is a hindrance.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; You remember what the Lord said about
[1:23:18] Israel? When you were little,
[1:23:21] when you had nothing,
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; when you laid in your own blood in a
[1:23:25] field, no one to clean you, I took you
[1:23:29] in.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Then you served me.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when you got old enough
[1:23:33] that you thought you was all right and
[1:23:35] self-secured, then you left me.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; They've always did that.
[1:23:41] Hezekiah, as I spoke of at the
[1:23:43] businessman's breakfast the other
[1:23:45] morning,
[1:23:46] he was a great man. He held on to the
[1:23:48] Lord.
[1:23:50] But one day after God strengthened him
[1:23:52] and he was a great example to Isaiah the
[1:23:55] prophet.
[1:23:56] But after he got strong and built up,
[1:23:58] the nations begin to fear him. He built
[1:24:01] his walls and began to get glamorous
[1:24:03] things. He got self-conceited. He got to
[1:24:06] look at how great he was. And then he
[1:24:08] tried to take the place of the preacher.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; God smoked him with leprosy and he died
[1:24:13] a leper.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; We don't never want to get lifted up in
[1:24:17] our hearts.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And sometimes when we see our
[1:24:20] organizations prosper, we begin to say,
[1:24:22] "We're the big group. We're the biggest
[1:24:25] Pentecostal group there is. We have more
[1:24:28] than the rest of them." or you can't get
[1:24:30] to heaven unless you belong to our group
[1:24:32] or something. When you get that way,
[1:24:34] you've separated yourself from the word
[1:24:36] of the law.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:40] Remember the blankets wide enough to
[1:24:42] stretch for your brethren.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. Take him in.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we need today a call back to the
[1:24:51] word of the Lord.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Look, today in our nation needs a call
[1:24:56] back.
[1:25:14] I'd like to read another statement if
[1:25:16] you don't mind. Uh
[1:25:21] talking about Amos. He said, "But those
[1:25:23] God's anointed eyes of that prophet
[1:25:27] didn't narrow because of the glamour
[1:25:30] like some tourist,
[1:25:32] but on the moral corruption
[1:25:35] to a people who was called to be blessed
[1:25:40] of God."
[1:25:42] I like to drop down and read a little
[1:25:44] further down. He says he's seen the
[1:25:46] corruption, the decay,
[1:25:49] and that's what he was looking at, and
[1:25:54] then he's seen all of that. It didn't
[1:25:57] attract him. It sickened him to his
[1:26:01] soul. Why? He was a prophet.
[1:26:05] He knew what God had promised to bless
[1:26:10] and what a blessing was
[1:26:13] and how the people act with the
[1:26:17] blessing.
[1:26:22] When you read these
[1:26:24] sermons and you read
[1:26:28] quite a bit of what brother Brandon
[1:26:30] preached in ' 62 and 63,
[1:26:35] the indictment
[1:26:36] is your life worthy of the gospel.
[1:26:40] Spiritual amnesia.
[1:26:44] He addressed the
[1:26:47] failing condition
[1:26:50] of the church
[1:26:54] and he began to point out how
[1:26:59] things have started to be added to the
[1:27:03] church and the people started. He uses
[1:27:06] the word quite often drifting.
[1:27:10] drifting into modernism, drifting into
[1:27:14] things that weren't there. Even within
[1:27:18] the framework of our message today,
[1:27:22] people put a lot of emphasis that we
[1:27:25] have the spirit moving. We have the
[1:27:28] spirit moving. And yet the same ones
[1:27:31] that claim the great movement of the
[1:27:33] Holy Spirit have 52in TVs in their
[1:27:38] living room. And he's saying that we've
[1:27:41] lost the Isav to see.
[1:27:45] We become conceited in ourselves. You
[1:27:48] heard the word for yourself. I I I I
[1:27:51] didn't even see this. I didn't even come
[1:27:53] up with this. But it takes a prophet to
[1:27:57] give you eyes that you could see.
[1:28:01] He he the holiness began to slip away.
[1:28:06] We substituted church for uh our
[1:28:11] Wednesday evenings and our prayer
[1:28:13] meetings and our Sunday evening services
[1:28:16] are now substitutes with you know
[1:28:20] volleyball and picnics and gettogethers
[1:28:24] and watching sports events and
[1:28:27] everything. But we claim a a a
[1:28:31] righteousness.
[1:28:32] We we claim a con a a conceit, brother
[1:28:37] Brandan called it, that we're right, you
[1:28:41] know, we have the truth. Uh we're the
[1:28:44] ones uh we're the forerunner.
[1:28:47] Uh we're we're the reestablishment
[1:28:52] of the glory of God.
[1:28:56] And Amos said, "By their lies, they lead
[1:29:00] the people astray.
[1:29:02] And I I've been in my heart, you know
[1:29:07] that. And and I I have a lot of things
[1:29:10] that I need to overcome personally and
[1:29:13] and and I work on them daily. But you
[1:29:17] know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, I
[1:29:19] don't think there's any way into the
[1:29:23] kingdom than God's provided word.
[1:29:27] And I don't believe there's another
[1:29:29] interpretation
[1:29:31] of the word other than the
[1:29:33] interpretation that the message or of
[1:29:36] the hour gave us.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; I believe that I I believe that whatever
[1:29:43] he speaks applies to all of us equally.
[1:29:48] There's no ministry, there's no man,
[1:29:51] there's nobody that has a right to stand
[1:29:54] in between the ears of the hearer and
[1:29:58] the voice of God.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It is up to each of us
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; individually
[1:30:06] never to assign yourself to a group but
[1:30:10] to assign a self to the word personally.
[1:30:16] I have chosen in my life and in my heart
[1:30:20] not to be a member
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; but to be a follower of the word of God.
[1:30:27] And so I I I I've just came back from a
[1:30:33] trip and
[1:30:36] and was astounded
[1:30:40] not at the
[1:30:42] love of the people, not at the people of
[1:30:45] individuals,
[1:30:47] but of the overall condition
[1:30:51] and the drift
[1:30:55] in the message today.
[1:30:59] And so I've been talking about the way
[1:31:02] forward and I realized as I listen to
[1:31:06] this that sometimes the way forward is
[1:31:09] back,
[1:31:13] back to the original path,
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; back back to the fundamentals.
[1:31:22] He said that prophet would stand up and
[1:31:25] he would preach the fundamentals of the
[1:31:28] word of God.
[1:31:32] And I thought of a way of a prophet
[1:31:38] because Paul said these words and I
[1:31:41] believe they could be spoken in our day.
[1:31:45] Be followers of me as I am of Christ.
[1:31:51] And so when you talk about the way of a
[1:31:55] true prophet, he said he's beginning to
[1:31:57] talk about what a true prophet would do.
[1:32:03] Because a prophet is the interpretation
[1:32:07] of the word.
[1:32:09] You can't separate the messenger from
[1:32:13] his message.
[1:32:15] In other words, if a way of a prophet
[1:32:18] was the word of God, then you should be
[1:32:22] able to make this conclusion. If I could
[1:32:26] say it this way, there was no part of
[1:32:28] his life that was not the word.
[1:32:37] It was it was his life was associated
[1:32:42] with the word.
[1:32:45] just looking back. So he he a messenger
[1:32:49] is the light to the age.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; There's a man here who can turn on the
[1:32:57] light.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; And I I want you to understand what I'm
[1:33:00] saying. The church is beginning to look
[1:33:02] at the church.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; The church is beginning to look at the
[1:33:06] ministry. The church is beginning to
[1:33:08] look at their worship. The church is
[1:33:11] beginning to look at their buildings.
[1:33:12] They're beginning to look at their
[1:33:14] membership. They're beginning to look at
[1:33:17] their fellowship. And and it's nice to
[1:33:20] have fellowship. It's nice to honor
[1:33:23] certain things. We do that. We have, you
[1:33:27] know,
[1:33:29] sister uh Fatu and Sister Aldi. They
[1:33:33] they they've lost their mothers
[1:33:36] and our heart goes out for them. We we
[1:33:40] grieve with them. We we we mourn with
[1:33:43] them. We we feel for them. You know,
[1:33:46] that that that's part of the what we do
[1:33:49] as a church.
[1:33:52] But we don't we don't, you know, start
[1:33:55] to say that our spirituality is built on
[1:34:00] our fellowship,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; how we get along, how we treat one
[1:34:06] another. and and you can actually create
[1:34:10] a a whole complete
[1:34:13] uh
[1:34:15] uh
[1:34:16] atmosphere
[1:34:18] that is not reflective,
[1:34:22] but you want to see a reflection of the
[1:34:25] word of God.
[1:34:28] So when God called a man, he made him a
[1:34:31] certain way. He made even the way his
[1:34:33] lips were formed to speak his words
[1:34:36] was orchestrated by God.
[1:34:39] So much so that the messenger used these
[1:34:43] words to instill in us
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; the absoluteness
[1:34:51] of the ministry in our age
[1:34:56] that there was no difference between
[1:34:59] this ministry and the ministry of Jesus
[1:35:02] Christ except for the corporal body. And
[1:35:05] I'm I'm saying this with all my heart
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; is that that position of that messenger
[1:35:13] has been declining
[1:35:16] in the church.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And you know this is my pet be but they
[1:35:23] won't play his message.
[1:35:27] years and years and years and years
[1:35:31] churches go on and the people sit in the
[1:35:34] congregation with secondhand revelation.
[1:35:38] And when we know beyond a shadow of a
[1:35:41] doubt, he said that was the sickness in
[1:35:44] the church and that caused lives to be
[1:35:47] in the condition that they're in is
[1:35:49] secondhand revelation.
[1:35:55] If the you say, "Well, you can listen to
[1:35:57] tapes at home. If they're good enough
[1:35:59] for you at home, they're good enough for
[1:36:01] us as a body."
[1:36:05] and and and I'll go on record.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; The minister who will not play
[1:36:13] the word of God to his people as spoken
[1:36:17] of in this generation is denying his
[1:36:20] people a true blessing.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; But you can't separate.
[1:36:32] You can't create an atmosphere or a way
[1:36:35] of worship or say because the gifts are
[1:36:39] operating. He said there's a lot more
[1:36:41] goes with it than that. And then he
[1:36:44] actually said and God doesn't lead that
[1:36:46] way anyway.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; But we forgot what he said.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; We forgot that he was the source.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; We forgot that he was a light. that
[1:37:00] there was a man there that could turn on
[1:37:03] the light.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; We've slowly separated the messenger
[1:37:09] from the message. We've taken his
[1:37:11] message, as you just heard him say, and
[1:37:14] we put it the way that we want it. We we
[1:37:17] put it out the way that it suits us. The
[1:37:20] parts of it that we like. The parts of
[1:37:23] it that tickle our ear. The parts of it
[1:37:26] that make us feel that we're good.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Holiness has gone out the window.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; You can hardly preach about it.
[1:37:43] I'm preaching overseas and I I I I make
[1:37:47] a comment and you heard the prophet of
[1:37:49] God say about twisting and rock and roll
[1:37:53] and dancing. He says one place he says
[1:37:56] that twisting and rock and roll and
[1:37:58] dancing came straight out of the jungles
[1:38:00] of Africa.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Now since when do I have to shy away
[1:38:08] from anything that the prophet of God
[1:38:10] said? Amen.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Whether it condemns me or not,
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; I would rather be found guilty by
[1:38:21] listening to it than be found guilty by
[1:38:24] ignorance.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; But we're we're we're drifting from what
[1:38:34] it was that called us.
[1:38:41] It
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; it isn't about our past,
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; our sins. Every bit of your sins is
[1:38:46] under the blood. If you fail, you cry,
[1:38:49] "Aba, Father. He's faithful and just to
[1:38:52] forgive you."
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying that we want to go
[1:38:56] forward.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; We want more of God. I'm telling you,
[1:38:59] the way for us to go forward is to go
[1:39:02] back to the ABCs
[1:39:05] of this message and the word of God.
[1:39:12] back to our example.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Back to the truth. What was his ways?
[1:39:22] Think of our messenger living his daily
[1:39:25] life.
[1:39:27] How he got up in the morning, how he
[1:39:29] started his day, how he treated people,
[1:39:33] how he went down. Leslie and I were
[1:39:36] sitting in the
[1:39:39] uh living room of her sister
[1:39:43] and and
[1:39:47] a man was sitting there in his 90s
[1:39:49] reading his Bible and we talked to him a
[1:39:53] moment. It was it was uh the grandfather
[1:39:58] of
[1:39:59] Leslie's
[1:40:02] uh sister's husband
[1:40:05] and he was the dry cleaner
[1:40:09] in Jeffersonville, Indiana that did all
[1:40:12] of Brother Brandham's suits.
[1:40:15] He said, "Yes." He said, "I did Brother
[1:40:17] Brandham's dry cleaning for years. I
[1:40:21] thought he'd come in and grab those
[1:40:23] anointed suits."
[1:40:25] No wonder he was sitting there at 90ome
[1:40:27] years old reading his Bible.
[1:40:30] That's right.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; I imagine that anointing was on him
[1:40:34] whether he knew it or not. I still
[1:40:36] believe in that kind of thing.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; And he began to tell us of what a
[1:40:43] gentleman he was,
[1:40:46] how kind he was, you know,
[1:40:50] simple things. He always paid. He always
[1:40:53] so grateful. He always complimented me
[1:40:56] on what a wonderful job we did. He he
[1:41:00] was appreciative. He was thankful. It
[1:41:02] was almost like, you know, like
[1:41:06] he he was so grateful.
[1:41:09] You know, here I'm charging him, but he
[1:41:13] makes me feel like I just did the
[1:41:15] greatest work known to civilization.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; That was his way.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; That was his manners.
[1:41:31] I remember talking to Billy Paul about
[1:41:34] the time that
[1:41:38] Brother Brandham was standing behind a
[1:41:40] curtain
[1:41:42] waiting for his time to preach
[1:41:45] and the brother stepped up to the
[1:41:47] microphone and said, "Oh, we're so
[1:41:48] sorry. Brother Brandham got called out
[1:41:51] on a sick call and he won't be able to
[1:41:54] be with us."
[1:41:56] And brother Bram was standing right
[1:41:58] right there behind the piano.
[1:42:02] And a brother turned to him and said,
[1:42:04] "Brother Bram, why don't you go out
[1:42:06] there?" You know what he said? "Brother,
[1:42:10] I would never do anything to hurt that
[1:42:13] brother."
[1:42:16] Now me, I'd expose that line devil,
[1:42:23] you know, but he was so tender. He knew
[1:42:25] that if you plucked up the wheat
[1:42:29] that you might hurt the wheat.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; He knew God sold the harvest.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; He knew that seed was going to come up.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; And he bore all the reproach and stood
[1:42:40] on the word of God. That was his his
[1:42:43] manners,
[1:42:45] his atmosphere
[1:42:48] that he created.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; His speech,
[1:42:52] the way he talked. He could talk as
[1:42:55] cutting as he did right there because it
[1:42:59] was the word of God, but but fill you
[1:43:02] with such love and feeling that you you
[1:43:05] felt like you were sinless when you were
[1:43:09] guilty.
[1:43:11] You know, his associations,
[1:43:17] everything about him
[1:43:21] was his way.
[1:43:26] It was his way.
[1:43:29] It was the way of a true prophet.
[1:43:33] It was it was the absolute in his life
[1:43:40] and his way
[1:43:42] was supposed to transfer to us.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, prove that by the word."
[1:43:51] There was a harvest. How many believe
[1:43:55] we're in harvest time?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; How many believe we're in the time of
[1:43:59] the rapture?
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; How many believe we're at the end time?
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Or do we just think it's going to go on
[1:44:08] forever?
[1:44:10] Jesus said it this way. Thou fool, thy
[1:44:14] soul may be required of you this night,
[1:44:18] this day. Today could be your day.
[1:44:29] You you be you begin to see that that
[1:44:37] light and that life
[1:44:41] that was shining was the interpretation
[1:44:45] of the word of God.
[1:44:47] And you say, well, what why was that?
[1:44:52] He was a candlestick.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; He was a light in the hand. He was the
[1:44:58] seventh age messenger. The mysteries of
[1:45:01] God were be revealed. But when you take
[1:45:04] all of that and you bring it back,
[1:45:06] really, what did he say? He said it when
[1:45:09] the before the harvest
[1:45:12] comes to maturity,
[1:45:17] the first one,
[1:45:19] the first fruit
[1:45:22] that reached
[1:45:24] the maturity
[1:45:26] by setting in the sun.
[1:45:31] It became a sign
[1:45:34] to what all the rest of the fruit would
[1:45:39] come to.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; If you walked up, my mother had a
[1:45:47] orange tree
[1:45:49] in her backyard.
[1:45:52] That tree produced
[1:45:56] thousands
[1:45:58] of bushels of oranges. It was absolutely
[1:46:02] the most amazing tree. And you could
[1:46:06] wait to that tree and the little green
[1:46:08] things would come up and finally you'd
[1:46:10] go out there and you'd grab one and it
[1:46:13] was soft and and and you'd cut it up and
[1:46:16] it was juicy and it was sweet and it was
[1:46:20] just absolutely wonderful. You knew that
[1:46:23] that tree had the potential to produce
[1:46:27] every orange exactly like that.
[1:46:32] Yes, sir.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; And if you would let it mature,
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; each of those oranges would come.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; But if you got impatient and you picked
[1:46:41] one too soon,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; bitter.
[1:46:49] But if you'd let the sun
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; do its work
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; that the every tree
[1:47:01] so that fruit,
[1:47:04] that light, that messenger,
[1:47:07] the one that we used to model our lives
[1:47:11] after,
[1:47:15] maybe to the point of air, I'll admit.
[1:47:18] did.
[1:47:19] But we we wouldn't climb over a bobwire
[1:47:22] fence unless we did it the way the
[1:47:24] prophet of God did it.
[1:47:29] When we first came into the message, it
[1:47:32] it was such a shining light.
[1:47:35] We realized we were so far from God that
[1:47:38] we thought maybe it'd be better if we
[1:47:40] drove a Ford.
[1:47:46] Whatever he said, whatever he did,
[1:47:50] we were sure of it.
[1:47:53] If there was nothing else we weren't
[1:47:55] sure of, we were sure that the way he
[1:47:57] did things was the way of the word
[1:48:00] because that's the way of a true
[1:48:02] prophet.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; But now we have our own way.
[1:48:13] Our
[1:48:15] song services are like concerts.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Drums are blaring, saxophones are
[1:48:23] ripping, choreograph moves on the
[1:48:27] platform. All the singers going one way
[1:48:29] and
[1:48:31] going back the other way and every guy
[1:48:34] that's singing has an album to sell.
[1:48:40] I'm for worship.
[1:48:42] We don't come here for worship.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; We do come here for worship, but it's
[1:48:48] also the house of correction.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; We worship the Lord. And we worship him
[1:48:54] by acknowledging the fact that we're
[1:48:57] going to follow his word, not to be
[1:48:59] entertained, not that the music
[1:49:03] generates the spirit. I'm all for
[1:49:05] dancing. I'm all for speaking in
[1:49:07] tongues, but how come it turn the music
[1:49:09] off?
[1:49:13] I'd love to see you get up right now
[1:49:16] under the anointing of the word of God,
[1:49:18] which is here,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; and run around this church praising God.
[1:49:25] But if you need a banjo to do it,
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; you speak in tonesues is what he said
[1:49:37] when he said what was rejected was
[1:49:40] somebody speaking in tonesues and it
[1:49:42] being interpretating and say this and
[1:49:46] this is going to take place
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; otherwise is
[1:49:54] they will think you're mad.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; We've drifted.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; We want to go forward.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to go forward?
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to go forward into the
[1:50:11] rapture?
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you this morning, the way
[1:50:14] forward is to go back to the principles
[1:50:17] and to the way of a true prophet.
[1:50:23] individually.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; You've got to decide.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; We have to enforce certain rules because
[1:50:34] we have to have some sort of order, some
[1:50:37] sort of decency, some sort of
[1:50:39] accommodation.
[1:50:41] So we talk to you about seating. We talk
[1:50:43] to you about parking. We talk to you
[1:50:45] about these things so we don't have
[1:50:47] chaos because the scripture tells us to
[1:50:50] let all things be done decently and in
[1:50:53] order.
[1:50:55] But it's up for you as an individual
[1:51:00] to take this word,
[1:51:04] this voice
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; and listen to it. You decide whether you
[1:51:11] should be here 30 minutes or not.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; You decide whether you should take
[1:51:19] communion or not.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; You decide whether you should work on
[1:51:24] Sunday or not. You make those decisions.
[1:51:32] We've exited the law.
[1:51:38] You have to decide whether that way,
[1:51:43] the way that he preached is the way to
[1:51:46] maturity.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; If it's the way to the rapture,
[1:51:55] that's a decision you've got to make in
[1:51:57] your own heart.
[1:52:02] As the prophet said, "As for me, in my
[1:52:04] house, we'll serve the Lord." Judas
[1:52:07] says, "Thou hast not kept the
[1:52:09] commandments of our fathers. Thou hast
[1:52:11] despised the law. Thou has listened to a
[1:52:14] lie that has taken you an air."
[1:52:19] I'll tell you who the voice of God was
[1:52:21] to you in this day. And it wasn't any
[1:52:24] preacher, in any pulpit, in any place in
[1:52:27] this message.
[1:52:32] It was the voice of Malachi 4:5, Luke
[1:52:36] 17:30, Revelations 10:7.
[1:52:43] God gave him the name William Mary
[1:52:46] Brandham.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Someone said to me, "Well, you just
[1:52:50] believe it because he's an American."
[1:52:52] No, I don't believe this message
[1:52:55] by culture.
[1:52:58] I don't believe this message by
[1:53:00] location.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; I believe this message by seed.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; I don't care if his name was Chopstick
[1:53:09] Charlie from China.
[1:53:13] If he would have preached
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; what he preached
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; and if he was vindicated the way that he
[1:53:22] was vindicated, the seed in me would
[1:53:25] have said amen to every word of God.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; The only reason he came from here was
[1:53:36] because of civilization
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; and the last voice was to come at the
[1:53:40] end of civilization.
[1:53:45] And the last prophecy,
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; oh Capernium, Capernium, city of angels,
[1:53:53] oh United States of America, because
[1:53:56] thou has exalted thyelves into the
[1:53:58] heavens, thou shalt be brought to the
[1:54:00] lowest hell.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; You want to go forward, go back.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Go back to your messenger. Yes, sir.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Go back to what you know is true.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Go back to the life.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Don't let people talk you out of it.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Message churches today don't even have
[1:54:25] communion and footwashing.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Without it, you're not
[1:54:32] going to be there. How long are you
[1:54:34] going to sit
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; because of your fellowship, because of
[1:54:39] your friendship?
[1:54:42] and rot
[1:54:44] and die.
[1:54:50] Who who who going to
[1:54:53] who you going to blame?
[1:54:57] The scripture said there'll be wailing
[1:54:59] and nashing of teeth.
[1:55:03] Don't squander
[1:55:10] what you've been blessed with.
[1:55:14] Especially America,
[1:55:16] you have the tapes. You have the books.
[1:55:19] I I thank God for Voice of God for
[1:55:23] printing the books.
[1:55:26] I thank God they trying to get tablets,
[1:55:29] whatever they can do.
[1:55:32] it I I agree with more probably than
[1:55:34] what I disagree with.
[1:55:41] You want to go forward.
[1:55:44] You really want to go forward.
[1:55:47] Maybe you don't.
[1:55:51] But the way forward is back
[1:55:55] back to the word,
[1:55:59] back to our example, back to the way of
[1:56:04] a true prophet.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; And and you'll find that your whole life
[1:56:14] will start to come in order.
[1:56:20] The it Satan has made it to where it
[1:56:24] just doesn't seem like the word of God
[1:56:26] will work,
[1:56:29] but it'll never fail.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; He's placed within your hand a pearl of
[1:56:38] great price,
[1:56:40] the lost coin,
[1:56:43] the treasure in the field.
[1:56:46] It's all yours.
[1:56:49] It's yours. It's It's sitting right on
[1:56:53] your phone. It's sitting right on your
[1:56:56] device. It's sitting right in your
[1:56:58] closets and on your bookshelves and on
[1:57:01] the shelves back there.
[1:57:05] It's yours.
[1:57:08] It's a feast of mana
[1:57:12] that you can eat.
[1:57:17] You can go a whole day without food a
[1:57:21] lot easier than you can go a whole day
[1:57:23] without the word of God.
[1:57:28] So let's
[1:57:34] as I I I try to do the job if I could
[1:57:39] use that terminology
[1:57:42] and the place or the office that I have.
[1:57:48] I want to do it
[1:57:51] according to
[1:57:54] the messenger of RH the best I can.
[1:58:00] Don't we all agree
[1:58:02] on that one point?
[1:58:07] Isn't that what we've all purposed in
[1:58:09] our heart?
[1:58:12] So let's put on
[1:58:15] the Isav that he counseledled us to buy.
[1:58:20] I counsel thee to buy of me. Isav that
[1:58:25] thou mayest see
[1:58:29] white reignment
[1:58:32] that your nakedness
[1:58:35] doesn't appear.
[1:58:37] blind, poor, miserable, wretched, and
[1:58:40] naked, and don't even know it.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you be happy if somebody came
[1:58:47] to you and told you you weren't dressed
[1:58:50] or you were going the wrong way?
[1:58:55] We don't need more spirit. We need more
[1:58:58] ABCs, which produces the spirit.
[1:59:02] It produces the real spirit, the real
[1:59:05] power,
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; the real life. Not something
[1:59:08] short-lived,
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; but something that you walk out of here
[1:59:12] with because it's life in your soul.
[1:59:14] It's life in your being. It's the way
[1:59:17] you live. It's the way you go. It's your
[1:59:21] way. Your way is the way of the word.
[1:59:24] Your way is the way of a true prophet.
[1:59:27] Your way is the way of the spirit of
[1:59:29] God. The spirit of God didn't even come
[1:59:32] to speak of itself. It came to bring us
[1:59:35] into remembrance of all things which I
[1:59:37] have taught you.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:48] When I saw the condition
[1:59:50] of the church,
[1:59:55] I saw how far
[1:59:58] it moved away from our messenger.
[2:00:03] Thousands of people sitting there
[2:00:04] because nobody's telling them the truth.
[2:00:09] I said, "It's not my place to condemn,
[2:00:13] but it's my place to look in the mirror
[2:00:18] and ask myself."
[2:00:24] And I honestly have to say I came with
[2:00:28] the conclusion that
[2:00:30] I need to go back
[2:00:35] to the absolute
[2:00:38] Whether the church likes it or not,
[2:00:44] whether the songs we love are not
[2:00:47] appropriate,
[2:00:51] whatever it takes, Lord,
[2:00:54] help me
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; stay with
[2:00:59] this message.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; There's no big eyes. There's no they'll
[2:01:07] use. There's no some guilty and not
[2:01:11] guilty.
[2:01:13] If you're guilty of the least, you're
[2:01:15] guilty of the whole.
[2:01:18] But let's let our attitude be
[2:01:23] in Christian life
[2:01:27] that we're going to do our very best
[2:01:33] to walk in the way
[2:01:36] of the prophet.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Would we each do that in our own heart?
[2:01:46] God bless you this morning. really lead
[2:01:48] us in singing.
[2:01:54] [Applause]
[2:01:59] Now, don't applaud
[2:02:01] and then go live like a devil.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; All you are is a choir member.
[2:02:11] I told you a hundred times the prophet
[2:02:13] of God don't like it.
[2:02:18] Oh, I like it.
[2:02:21] But you know what it is? Applause is the
[2:02:24] show is over.
[2:02:27] I enjoyed it.
[2:02:29] Now I'm waiting for the next one.
[2:02:36] The last thing
[2:02:41] that the spirit of God does,
[2:02:44] the last and final thing
[2:02:48] that the spirit of God does
[2:02:52] before the church is caught up into the
[2:02:54] presence of the living God
[2:02:58] is a final
[2:03:00] separation.
[2:03:05] He'll finally separate the real from the
[2:03:09] false,
[2:03:11] the sincere from the uncincere.
[2:03:17] The lovers of God
[2:03:19] from the lovers of pleasure.
[2:03:24] He'll separate the religious
[2:03:29] from heartfelt.
[2:03:32] You know what our messenger said? I
[2:03:33] said, "I'd rather hear a guy squeak out
[2:03:35] a tune from his heart than have some
[2:03:38] trained opera voice."
[2:03:40] I like good singing. I like it when it
[2:03:43] comes from the heart.
[2:03:46] I like it when it comes from the soul.
[2:03:48] But don't you ever be afraid to sing
[2:03:50] because you don't got no talent.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; If you got the heart, it's music to my
[2:03:57] ears.
[2:04:00] Don't you ever be afraid to lift your
[2:04:03] hands and praise God.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; If you want to praise God,
[2:04:12] don't be afraid to shout.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; If you've got a shout in you,
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; but what's motivating it? Don't ever be
[2:04:22] afraid to speak in tonesues if it's the
[2:04:25] God speaking in tonesues.
[2:04:30] Speaking in tongues is not a proof
[2:04:33] the spirit of God is with you. Neither
[2:04:36] is prosperity.
[2:04:39] Satan can imitate every single one of
[2:04:42] these.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; But go back into your heart
[2:04:46] and ask yourself this morning, have I
[2:04:49] heard the cry?
[2:04:54] Have I heard the voice?
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:04:58] Have I seen the revelation
[2:05:02] of the mighty angel
[2:05:05] opening the mysteries to me?
[2:05:09] Do I know whom I'm following today?
[2:05:13] Christian Life Tabernacle will not get
[2:05:16] you there. David McGuri will not get you
[2:05:20] there.
[2:05:21] There's only one thing that transform
[2:05:24] you and that's the word of God. Thus
[2:05:27] sayaeth the Lord spoken from the word of
[2:05:31] God.
[2:05:33] You marry that.
[2:05:37] Let that become your husband.
[2:05:40] [Music]
[2:05:41] A man came to me and it broke my heart.
[2:05:44] He said I I perceive. He told me
[2:05:51] from hearing you minister, he said, "I
[2:05:53] perceive that if I came to you with a
[2:05:56] book or something," Brother Brandham
[2:05:58] said that I could come to you and show
[2:06:03] you what he said.
[2:06:05] [Music]
[2:06:08] And if it was true, you would agree with
[2:06:10] me." I said, "Most certainly, brother."
[2:06:13] He said, "It's not so." in our country.
[2:06:21] I want each and every single one of you
[2:06:24] to know you have divine authority in
[2:06:28] this word.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; If I'm an heir, you're obligated to take
[2:06:34] this message and come to me.
[2:06:40] In fact, I would beg you to do it.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:46] We need a voice in this day.
[2:06:51] And I heard one say, "I am the voice of
[2:06:53] God to you. I know you resented that."
[2:06:58] He said, "But I am
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; the voice of God to you."
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "I'll give you the
[2:07:05] sign of that voice."
[2:07:10] And he turned his back to the audience.
[2:07:14] He said, "You there,
[2:07:16] your name's Mr. Mitchell. You got lung
[2:07:20] cancer from a coal mine. You bought a
[2:07:22] pair of shoes with you many number of
[2:07:26] times."
[2:07:28] Oh, it was a lie.
[2:07:32] You're not a witch. They told a lie on
[2:07:35] you.
[2:07:37] Who was that?
[2:07:40] Who do you say this is? Who was that?
[2:07:42] Mechisedc,
[2:07:45] you understand? You're not following
[2:07:47] quote unquote a message.
[2:07:51] You're following Jesus Christ veiled in
[2:07:53] flesh in this last day with the true
[2:07:57] unadulterated word of God to take you to
[2:08:00] the kingdom of God.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Let our applause be our lives.
[2:08:07] Yes, sir.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Let our applause be the applying of the
[2:08:10] token to our homes.
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Let our applause be the love of God shed
[2:08:19] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.
[2:08:22] Let our applause be sharing this word
[2:08:26] with this lost and dying generation. If
[2:08:30] we do that,
[2:08:33] you will see the miracles. Yes. Amen.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz these signs shall follow them that
[2:08:39] believe.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us thou my unbelief. God
[2:08:45] bless you.
[2:08:49] [Applause]
[2:08:56] [Music]
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. I know you do it out of the
[2:09:01] goodness of your heart.
[2:09:05] This is so much more serious than we
[2:09:08] realize.
[2:09:11] We don't need an applause. We need the
[2:09:13] altar filled.
[2:09:17] I can't say it any more planer.
[2:09:21] I've hinted at it. I've hinted at it. It
[2:09:24] breaks my heart.
[2:09:27] If you love me,
[2:09:30] please do not applaud.
[2:09:33] [Music]
[2:09:36] I'm sorry. I have to get this frank.
[2:09:44] When you do that, you cut the spirit off
[2:09:46] from dealing with your heart.
[2:09:49] It just shows that I don't want to come
[2:09:52] under conviction. Good word. Thank you.
[2:09:55] That was awesome.
[2:09:59] You'll be judged this morning
[2:10:03] by every word that was spoken. And if
[2:10:06] you believe me to be a servant of the
[2:10:09] Lord and the pastor of this church,
[2:10:12] I implore you to go listen to the way of
[2:10:16] a true prophet
[2:10:19] because judgments
[2:10:21] soon at hand.
[2:10:24] I'm sorry.
[2:10:26] I've appreciated it, but I don't think
[2:10:29] it's pleasing to the Lord because the
[2:10:31] prophet of God said so. Look it up for
[2:10:34] yourselves. God bless you. Sorry,
[2:10:38] man. Let's all stand and sing.
[2:10:44] Oh, and at night
[2:10:47] I lay
[2:10:49] back
[2:10:50] and I began to cry.
[2:10:57] [Music]
[2:11:00] Oh, and my mind just fails to know
[2:11:07] exactly
[2:11:09] why.
[2:11:13] Wait and I can't explain
[2:11:18] with tongle.
[2:11:21] Oh, and the spirit growing
[2:11:25] deep within.
[2:11:28] Oh, it must be God.
[2:11:32] Yeah. In my soul, cuz I feel the poor.
[2:11:42] Oh, I feel the call.
[2:11:50] I hear the call.
[2:11:57] And I know his spirit's
[2:12:01] moving me
[2:12:04] to give my all.
[2:12:11] Oh, at his feet
[2:12:13] to me
[2:12:18] and I
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:26] Oh Lord, please come and take
[2:12:31] control.
[2:12:33] I feel the B.
[2:12:39] Oh, and I went through here.
[2:12:45] Oh, and when
[2:12:47] it's light and
[2:12:52] I will.
[2:12:55] Oh, he was calling
[2:12:58] me to give
[2:13:04] praise.
[2:13:07] Oh, you
[2:13:12] Oh, come to the deep. Oh, and like a
[2:13:17] great man.
[2:13:22] Oh, and I don't for sure.
[2:13:27] But I reached the goal
[2:13:30] cuz I feel the cold.
[2:13:37] I feel the voice.
[2:13:44] I hear the call.
[2:13:52] And I know his spirit's
[2:13:56] moving me to give my all.
[2:14:05] Oh, let it speak to me
[2:14:13] and I
[2:14:20] also
[2:14:22] [Music]
[2:14:27] I feel
[2:14:30] just sing it one more time this morning.
[2:14:33] Oh, I feel the call.
[2:14:41] I hear the call.
[2:14:46] [Music]
[2:14:49] And I know his spirit's
[2:14:52] moving
[2:14:54] me
[2:14:56] to give my all.
[2:15:01] [Music]
[2:15:02] Oh, and he speaks to me
[2:15:09] and I
[2:15:19] come and take control.
[2:15:24] I feel the
[2:15:32] Father
[2:15:34] of love,
[2:15:36] sitting on your throne of mercy, Lord,
[2:15:41] it's only by your mercy we all save.
[2:15:48] [Music]
[2:15:49] Oh, Lord.
[2:15:52] Hallelujah.
[2:15:54] If we call upon your name,
[2:15:58] oh and we and our families
[2:16:02] will be saved.
[2:16:06] Oh, so we cry
[2:16:11] to
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:18] Oh god.
[2:16:21] [Music]
[2:16:31] Jesus Christ
[2:16:44] on your grace.
[2:16:48] tonight
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:16:53] praise
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:16:57] God
[2:17:00] most high
[2:17:04] Jesus Christ.
[2:17:12] Oh, and your father
[2:17:15] of love
[2:17:17] ever fading to fully. Oh, at each moment
[2:17:22] is a gift from you to me.
[2:17:28] Oh, and we only here to tell the world
[2:17:34] about your praise. Oh, until the day you
[2:17:39] take us all away.
[2:17:44] Oh, you are
[2:17:52] as I
[2:17:56] go
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:04] most high
[2:18:07] for you Jesus.
[2:18:15] Oh, what do we
[2:18:20] on your gra
[2:18:23] [Music]
[2:18:40] Jesus
[2:18:44] Hallelujah.
[2:18:46] Amen. Brother Tommy, if you could just
[2:18:47] come in this with us this morning.
[2:18:57] [Music]
[2:19:09] Let's just pray.
[2:19:10] [Music]
[2:19:16] Dear heavenly father, Lord,
[2:19:20] Lord, what a wonderful word we've
[2:19:23] received today, Lord. And
[2:19:26] Lord, we're just so grateful for our
[2:19:30] shepherd, Lord. He's stuck to the word,
[2:19:33] Lord. And he's been such a blessing to
[2:19:36] me, Lord. And I know it's you. It's not
[2:19:39] him, Lord. And Lord, we're so grateful
[2:19:43] for this message, Lord. It's It's become
[2:19:46] life to me, Lord. And
[2:19:49] Lord, I don't know where I'd be without
[2:19:51] it,
[2:19:55] Lord. We thank you for the prophet
[2:19:58] you've sent in this hour, Lord. And
[2:20:02] Lord, it's just the word of God, Lord.
[2:20:04] We know it's your word. We know it's
[2:20:05] you,
[2:20:07] Lord. We're seeking more of you, Lord.
[2:20:10] May you just give us a refilling, Lord.
[2:20:12] May we come back just on fire, Lord. And
[2:20:16] Lord, may we leave here and just
[2:20:19] may each person that we interact with,
[2:20:22] Lord, just see you in us, Lord.
