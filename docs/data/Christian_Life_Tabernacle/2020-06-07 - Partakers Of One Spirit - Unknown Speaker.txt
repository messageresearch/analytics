I'll just figure it out but I certainly enjoyed that statement that brother branham made so much that I wanted to read it again but it was what he said about Stonewall Jackson and he he said he said it was the greatest general Stonewall Jackson who has been my favorite general since Joshua Stonewall Jackson was asked one time how can you stand with just a handful of men when the opposition is so great that's how he got his name Stonewall he would not budge he knowed no retreat what could we accredit a man like that to a man when the Yankees come down by the thousands and stood there he stood there in the minority but they were never moved him he stood like a stone wall and all the rest of the rebel army had retreated back lines come on said what's the matter with Jackson why isn't he going I've heard that statement a lot what's the matter with Jackson so that really meant a lot to me what's the matter with Jackson why isn't he going and he said he stands like a stone wall that's where he got his title and the other generals asked him said mr. Jackson a little bitty fella black-headed blue-eyed only about 5 feet 2 inches tall very modest speaking little fella who said mr. Jackson how can you stand in such opposition and he said bash like you know so you can just picture him he's you know bashful like he said he kicks his foot against the wall ground his heads down he says kibosh Vil like he kicked his boot on the ground and he said I never take a drink of water unless I thank God for it first that's where it is there's no retreat in God speak and go forward that's right that's God's commission to his church we we have no time to slack they say the revival is over it isn't over go forward it it's time that Kent Pentecost played out it isn't it's time for Pentecost to rise in the name of Jesus Christ and go forward there's no retreat there's no stain on the same ground let's move with the spirit or the spirit we'll move on to someone else and leave you standing you follow it don't don't all that's in do all that's in your heart for God is with you and and and that meant a lot to me and man as you know it's just been in my heart to provide a better sanctuary for us I know this evening we're not crowded we're never very crowded on communion night but my heart's desires one day that everybody will come out to communion that they'll get the revelation of how important it is and but that we'd have more space and more room and that we could have better bathrooms just many things that would make our church life easier for the people and and that any Shepherd that had a stall and and that was so packed and the sheep are so crowded in that his heart would hope that God would build a bigger stall that his sheep would have more room to sleep more room to eat it I think that's just a natural thing but we did hit a milestone here this week in our hearts desire and we finally hit the 300 thousand dollar mark in our building fund and so our goal is to reach four hundred thousand but just think that we've made 75 percent of our goal so I really think that's a wonderful thing so I'm grateful for that and and we hope that in the next few months that we'll be able to secure our building permit and and get with all their brethren and plan exactly how that we want to go forward so we're certainly a grateful for that and also we want to really encourage all the men that can come out I wanted to say this this morning that I slipped my mind but look for the men's breakfast next Saturday morning at 9 o'clock here at the church we have a men's breakfast and and we going to provide a nice breakfast we're going to have now sisters don't get mad at me now but this is for the brothers because we want to get them to go to work ok and do things so we're going to have some nice Denver scramble yeah it's ham and onions and cheese all scrambled up but a nice we're gonna have bacon and sausage and hash browns and biscuits and gravy and coffee and orange juice he said you know that some people only come out for the loaves and fishes you know what I mean so we have to make that available to you know whatever whatever it takes that get them all out together right and you know that's just what it takes and so we're looking forward to that but I wanted to thank you all for your support and and that your continuing effort to keep the house of the Lord open and so I just really was pleased to see that that we've reached that so we're gonna try to get a a new I guess we call a thermometer or our goal chart and put the top and start at the bottom and see if we can fill the rest of it in so lord richly bless you let's stand again and sing another song and I'll get this weird Billy go if this does somebody I got a comment somebody said that we I should wipe this down before I hand it to you but I've been tested negative there's no one belief in me I hope [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a man isn't it wonderful that His grace was amazing to us amen what a personal event when the grace of God comes into our hearts we just so appreciate it it's from that time there were a different person Amen let's let's bow our heads together precious heavenly father Lord what a wonderful thing it is Oh God to be able to know that you've invited us to come and feast at your table precious heavenly father Lord we're here tonight for one one cause one reason and Lord that's to know you more Lord Jesus we pray Lord as we stand here Lord we of ourselves can or do nothing that would benefit the people Lord but if you'll come on and fulfill your word and visit with us Lord we would be edified Lord our hearts would be encouraged Lord this little thought that you've placed upon my heart I pray to God that you'd help me to get out of the way Lord that Lord be a blessing to your people Lord we're just during this little time of communion Lord we just pray that those who have questions those who have need Lord I pray you'd come by our way Lord and and do is you can only do Lord and break the bread of life to our hearts I just commit commit everything to you now in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen certainly appreciate the songs specials what a wonderful day I was meditating on some things brother David said this morning and I just it's just inspiring to know that God can take you know something like Rahab you know that story just it really affected me you know her and her in that condition and I identify with Rahab the harlot because I - one day you know I was I was groping in darkness and and all of a sudden you know that that voice just something spoke to my heart and that what was said I just was compelled to be obedient to it and God came by and confirmed what he spoke and I just believe that's the communion that we have today just like we have of God that will speak that we can speak to and he'll speak back amen that's that's a just a wonderful delight as children of God that we have I'm just really thankful for that and and I trust that tonight that as we go through the the communion service and through the word that God will do that very same thing in first Corinthians we're gonna take a little thought out of chapter 12 first Corinthians chapter 12 and while you're turning there as another thing I said one of my little children's books that was laying on the ground during the morning service it had little people you know with little flashlights and the night it was nighttime and they were walking around with flashlights and you know it just it just struck me how that ye are the light of the world and the the the our that we're living in it's in the evening time it is the night time and so that's what we're gonna kind of try to focus in on a little bit tonight now concerning spiritual Griffes brethren I would have you not I would have you not ignorant you know that you were Gentiles carried away and to these dumb idols even as you were led wherefore I have given unto you understanding that no man speaketh by the Spirit of God call it Jesus occurs and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost a man we trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats yeah it's it's we're familiar with the the scripture when brother bran says all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church and you know we're living in a time where there's darkness and gross darkness on the people and God had an intention and a purpose a hidden motive a mystery that was going to be open to us and now here we are in the evening time and goddess he has brought this evening time light and now we can understand that that were a part of him and whatever he is that's what we are and you know I just got to thinking about how you know even even in the midst of situations that I had experienced even not even being consecrated to the work of the Lord and God he he just would would ask me you know there there's somebody that I cared for that was in a condition and because I heard that you know God he was he was a God that still had the power to resurrect the dead and so when I heard that something in me started kind of churning and bubbling and I mean I had heard it on tape but then when I actually met somebody who actually began to point to a person that a girl when she was 10 years old she was dead and some brothers went over there and prayed for her that God raised her up and that just really did something for me I it's hard to explain some things but you know when God touches you by testimony how it affects you and so it wasn't very much longer after that that now I was put into a position where you know I got a knock at the door and my wife my wife answered it and she you know said that the neighbor person was wanting some help and it's kind of a long testimony but because of what I had previously heard it put what was in my heart to action not I it was actually an opportunity where I stopped looking at my own self it was like I wasn't thinking about Who I am in my mind or what I was thinking in the moment there was something in me that acted and I just believe that God gives us experiences and situations where when we've received the word and we've there's something that's been quickened now we're gonna be thrusted into a little situation where now God can use you and he wants to do something he wants to declare that he's the same yesterday today and forever and that isn't that the way it works you you read you know your different life experiences and you heard how God did it for somebody else and that sets a little something in your heart now then you come to a place where you're like I'm in the same position I'm in the same situation and and then it's almost like the situation forces the what's in you to come out and you know it's just it's just a glorious thing how that were made to partake in the Word of God we are the word and we're made to protect in the the very resurrection power and if we could just read a little bit further in our scripture in verse 11 it says but all these work worketh that one and self same spirit dividing to the very man every man severally as he will for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of the that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free we have we and have been all made to drink into one spirit and that's really that that last little phrase is if if I was going to drive and focus down on something is is you've been made to drink into one spirit and and see we know that by the teaching of the Prophet that only the predestinated can be born again and so you know what it's like to come into this world with the fallen nature and the spirit that you were born with and so you know it doesn't say that all we're made to drink of those two spirits well there is one spirit of the Living God that can come and give the predestinated seed the new birth and and you've been made to partake in that and and it's great it's a wonderful thing to be able to experience God in salvation or or in wisdom or in healing and now I just you know as as you're made for it now let's let the channel flow let's let the waters of life flow and so you know I just I tell you it's it's such a blessing whenever you can experience the grace of God and and then you can partake in this one spirit it's it's so wonderful and so you know I just talking with the brother yesterday and he had kind of a distressful situation and he had to take his wife to the emergency room and he got to testifying to me and he said you know he was like you know I feel like and and this is kind of like Moses you know Moses came to a place where he said you know he knew he had been commissioned he knew he had been called he knew he had the seed and he was born a proper child and he knew was going to be the deliverer but then when he tried to go out on what his ability and education all that he took a headlong topple and he failed and that's the way it is I believe with us as believers where we can conceptualize what God has called us to and so well you know he's like yeah I've went through this situation with my vehicle and he had to do the same replacement of a part like three or four times well he's just like he's not a handyman or a mechanic or anything like that but he's YouTube in videos and doing things so he's getting to where he's like I can actually do this now that you know I'm going back for the same part I can do this and he goes I'll do this in 30 minutes and and you know it took him like 11 hours or eight hours or something like that and and we just got the fellowship and he just started telling me he goes you know the Lord really spoke to me and taught me that you know what you know I was I was I was saying I was gonna do this and I was gonna do that you know and sometimes that's what we get with with our experience and things like that it's almost like I've had enough where I got this you know but really the relationship is a love affair and we want to commune with Christ and we want to know that we're drinking of this fountain and it's us together and we don't want to ever get to where we're self-sufficient like I've experienced the word I know you know no it's not about that and so what are we coming to and so as you know I can identify and I chuckled with and because I've experienced that I failed so many times thinking I was gonna get out starting doing something and Wow you know it finally kind of where it well maybe I should have prayed first you know amen so you know can we be honest you know that's that's that's what I'm doing is just I want to be honest you know there's times where we go out and we do things and we kind of leave the Lord out of it but tonight I want to commune with God and just say you know let's let the mercies of God flow you know what has overflowed to me I wanted to overflow to others and and I got to thinking about how you know brother branham made statement about one of the greatest successes that he had with when in terms of his is brain for the sick and you know we're commissioned and called to pray for the sick to preach the gospel and and people can actually see the power of the Resurrection when you testify and then they see the results of the testimony that God is not dead in a matter of fact he's here doing the same that he's always done and so he said red-brown made the statement he says you know he if he can get to like the man in Mexico when he he lifted his shoulders to see if he can give him his coat you know and then he put his foot up to his his shoe up to the the blind man's a foot to see if maybe he can give him his shoes and I just think that that's the Spirit of Christ is to look unto the needs of others and to to you know and and sometimes we endure things like the scripture says in Philippians and thinks the third chapter he says that we might be that we might know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his suffering to be made conformable unto his death and so you know there are certain things that we don't necessarily we didn't we wouldn't want to sign up for it like who wants to sign up for heart murmur who wants to sign up for some kind of disability or something but you know when you become a partaker of the the grace of God and the witness of God now now you can have fellowship with someone else's suffering and then your your offer of mercy can be extended and it be effectual you know we want that whatever you're going through it's not in vain God is allowing it for a purpose that because what you are now he wants to express it to those who are groping in darkness amen what a special calling not everybody they can take it in their mind but they can't perform it because they don't have that same spirit amen amen I just just I'm just so thankful that you know God hasn't left us without a witness you know and God he he's he's he's placed his word and and the way that you know God has dealt with me and he just does it as a son of God just the same with you son or daughter of God he'll give a promise and then you accept it you received the promise and then God has a way of confirming the promise and see we have it potentially until until God backs it up and and you know when you four take to that mercy like say then it's real easy because you know the fruit of it you've realized the the full the full aspect of it and so you know why I wouldn't want to be we don't want to be the ones that wear the blessings of God stops at you know we want to be that conduit that channel that it can flow amen well I I won't be long I just kind of just wanted to share a little thought that was on my heart and you know as I was reading this morning in church something that kind of stood out to me is in Isaiah 30 but it seemed fitting for where we're at in time and where I'm at individually I just trusted to be a blessing so in Isaiah Terry says woe unto their rebellious children saith the Lord that taketh counsel but not of me you see you know our our nation we've we've walked away from all that's called God and and now they have all of these things you know that that claimed this and claimed that but the scripture saying and that cover with covering but not of my spirit you see it's plainly stating that God has a cover God has what he wants for his children in the form of his spirit and and that they may add sin to sin they they walked to go down to Egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of Egypt therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion yeah just think about that those who don't counsel the Word of God you see how Egypt is a type of sin in the world and you know they're looking for the government to be a fortification and a strength but that's not our strength that's not our hope and we're communing with the word knowing that there's no trial there's no struggle that we're going through that our God by his Spirit is not going to bring about the deliverance bring about the restoration and the healing and just maybe we'll skip over to verse 17 he says 1000 shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on a heel you know and that's what that's what we are like believing brother David preached about those and those vessels of Mercy you know when you've received this message you've received mercy you know it tells you about who you are in him and oh my I mean to think that you're a part of him and you're to do to declare his very righteousness to declare his very work at the end time this is like the climax of all what he had in his heart my and therefore with the Lord therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted you know I just think about how it took me so long to finally come to the place of surrender you know and and I you know it's it's just amazing like the scripture says it's the it's the goodness or the mercies of God that bringeth the man to repentance and he waits there so long and waits but now that's his gonna be as exaltation you know because you know once he come to the final realization and his full surrender then like the songs that were sung you can really bust it out from the depths of your heart oh my therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the Lord is the god of judgment blessed are they that wait for him for the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem thou shalt weep no more thou shall be very gracious at the at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it he will answer thee yeah I just think that the scripture was just right in line with what I was on our pastor's heart you know God wants us to to speak and then go forward if it's been promised you you know that he'll never forsake the righteous or seen his seed begging bread you know if it's if it's biased stripes we are healed if it's I'll never forsake you whatever it is speak it and go forward he will answer thee and though the Lord give the bread of adversity in the water of affliction yet shall not die teachers be removed into the corners anymore but dyin eyes shall see thy teachers in thine ears shall hear the word behind these saying this is the way walkie in it when ye turned to the right hand and you turn to the left hey man so I just I just want to encourage you as as we're going through the different trials that were going through God he you've been you've been made to be partakers of one spirit and when you receive that spirit now let's let the blessings flow god bless you I get me a mic I I just sat here this morning banging my arm against the side of the ball pit they're like really suffering but if you can't hear me I just just what to me what Andrew said is really what would solve all the problems in our nature it's just the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit like he said let just be in a conduit to let the goodness of God go out everywhere you are and you can share that goodness everywhere respect every human being you come with wish good thoughts towards everybody you come to say a nice thing and everybody that you meet create an atmosphere around you that they know there's no bitterness or no eight redeem your heart Joe respect to all men and even the lost and and it's just something about someone that's got the love of God in their heart it breaks down barriers like nothing you know it just have that that hand of the Lord on you remember I went to preach one time and I didn't have no money so I took the bus and I went through Memphis in the that was in the Memphis bus station and and that's you know the bus stations are there were little rougher places in the part of town so I remember I I went to get a buy something and I pulled the money out of my pocket and went through it and paid that the guy and put it back in my pocket and all of a sudden I felt this hand on my shoulder and I looked up and this fella had his hand on me he look at me he says son don't you ever pull out your poke in the middle of the a crowd and you know I just thought that guy cared about me that's right you know what I mean he knew if you go flashing your money you're not gonna have him very long you know what I mean I was young young guy and and and he come out looking after me you know he just gave me it I actually felt his care in his love and I'll guarantee you the guy was a street person that you'd ever meet in your life but he knows and he cared and I appreciated that and that went a long way with me I felt the hand of the Lord and I felt the Lord use that fella and I asked God to bless him and we can do so much to create the right atmosphere and I think especially in this hour we're living in everybody's looking for a reason to do whatever they want to do you know isn't it funny we had everybody was locked up for months and months and everybody's avoiding everybody and you look on the news and thousands and thousands of people are all all together and walking around and I think that's great I'm all for it and then this one guy that was the guy that tried to tell everybody they should be social distancing he's sending out messages over again the start to virus all over again we're gonna start the virus all over again you want to know something we need the love of God that's the thing that will kill that virus every time I don't care the love of God will do exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask for thing a good spiritual atmosphere I think if you get so filled with the Holy Ghost that that little mamita wherever it is you won't even want to be a part of me that's right so let's just really let the atmosphere of sharing what we have on the inside be placed out there for everybody let's stand and read our scriptures as in this turn in our Bibles to Luke and let me see here it's found in I just had it here lost my place in my Bible found in Luke the 22nd chapter then the fifteenth verse now then these are this is going to be our our communion of reading and and that the brothers would go get ready at this time it said and he said in the fourteenth verse and when the hour was come he sat down and the Twelve Apostles with him and he said unto them with desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God and when he took the cup he gave thanks and said take this and divided amongst yourselves for I say and you I will not drink of the fruit of this vine tell the kingdom of God shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave it unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me and likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me the table and truly the Son of Man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed and they begin to enquire among themselves which of them was it that should do this thing and there also was a strife amongst them which of them should be accounted the greatest amen god bless you may be seated you know the reason I read these scriptures care for communion is because after they were wandering and inquiring which amongst them to be the greatest Jesus took off his garment and washed their feet and said I have given you example he was the greatest among you shall be a servant of all and so that's why we put communion in foot washing together because after that he gave an example of how that we should be but we take communion of with the Lord so he can be our guide in being little messiahs he can be our guide in meeting that's in guiding us in all righteousness we wash feet so we can always have the remembrance in our lives that there's no big guys and there's no little use we're all the purchased possession of the Lord Jesus Christ rather our gracious Heavenly Father the force here lies bread Lord but this bread represents your body word the sacrifice of you giving yourself to the church nor did we take this in remembrance of you of the example that you gave us the life you live afford us the truth that you revealed unto us for when we saw you we saw the father for all that the father was he poured into you and now we're obedient Lord to your command that when we eat this bread and we drink this cup we do it in remembrance of you and father we ask you to bless this bread as we partake and when we partake in your life we're partaking in your life your way of doing things your way of seeing things we answer the situations to the best of our ability of the way that you would answer them that's what convenient with you means that's what it means to partake of your body means to partake of your life Heavenly Father also this wine represents the stimulation of Revelation it represents your blood that was shaved for us the life that was passed from you to us father represents that by eating your word and having your spirit we can serve you in spirit and in truth Lourdes Communion is shows in our heart our desire to fulfill your will to be led by you to do what you would have us to do Lord our souls are thrilled father as we just feel that we're moving into a time when the love of your church will be needed on your earth more than ever father wins the possession of the power of the Resurrection will need to be prevalent that we can find the very last one that we can bring every child of yours in do that safety of that art and we consume to go home father empower us with the power of your communion fill us with the revelation of your spirit that we could ever serve you better forgive us of our sins of our shortcoming of our pride of life and the distractions that so easily beset us and cause us to lose vision we have a cause and that causes the rapture and we're here to serve you father we ask you to strengthen us through communion this evening in Jesus name we pray
