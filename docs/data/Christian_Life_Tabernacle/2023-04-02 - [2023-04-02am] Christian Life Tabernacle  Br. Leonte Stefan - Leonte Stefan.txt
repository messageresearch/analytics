Br. Leonte Stefan
April 2, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] you pray [Music] Lord be praises [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus Christ [Music] Hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] forget about all that's happening out there just concentrate on him this morning amen he's always been the answer to old men's question amen Amen brother Andrew Sanders if you're just come and open our service in prayer this morning thank you [Music] let's bow our heads Lord we just love you so much Lord we counted a privilege to be gathered together again this morning Lord and truly we can do nothing of ourselves Lord so we invite you we light your presence Lord and we know Lord as the word Goes Forth Lord we can you can touch each need Lord you can save lives Lord you can change circumstances Lord we know there's needs in this congregation Lord the ones that aren't here Lord we know you can move forward we love you Lord be with the remainder of this service in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you hey man God bless you this morning I want to welcome everyone in the house of guide all our visitors man you can turn around and welcome someone who's invited by the microphone so I'm reading this morning you know it was uh reading the message why Christ speak this week and I always pay special attention to brother branham's prayers I love to go through the services and just listen to how he prayed and he made a statement as he was opening the service there and he was praying before he took the text he said Lord Thy word lays open on the pulpit and realizing that someday it'll be closed for the last time then the word will be flesh and then we're grateful for this time this morning open to us by the Holy Spirit the contents of this word that we shall read May the Holy Spirit teach us today the things that we ought to know and may we then in return listen closely to every word weigh it deeply and may we be able to catch what the holy spirit's trying to reveal to us for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts and understanding be open Lord you know I was thinking about that just continuing to think about leadership we're going to go to Psalm 32 this morning this is a Psalm that brother Branham preached out of in the message God's eye you know specifically he was reading from verse 8. which says this I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine I you know from this verse brother Branham preaches just a whole message on you know seeing things through God's eye you know certainly we're familiar with scriptures like Hebrews 11 1 and Isaiah 55 8. you know we're familiar with second Corinthians 5 7 it says we walk by faith and not by sight you know we certainly know intellectually that we don't rely on what we see or feel or hear around us for leadership but when we read that verse that says I will guide thee with mine I you know walking by faith is not walking blindly it's not blind faith or blind Trust you know there is still sight it's just not ours you know sometimes if we're not careful we can consider Faith almost to be fatalistic well he knows what's best or I'm just trusting him but you know wandering about without Direction is not faith there is still direction there's guidance there's purpose so that but it's not based on what we see or what we feel or how we feel but it's based on what he sees you know the real question is is do we know what he sees do we know what he says you know it's uh as a preacher once said you know we know that God's will is his word but I heard someone once say his will is exactly what you would do if you saw what he saw brother Brandon says this in God's eye he says in that guiding eye wasn't to be gone at the going of the Lord Jesus he was to continue forever in his church and when he rose on the third day and ascended up on high and sent the Holy Spirit back that the church tonight looks through that same guiding eye that guides his people in all truth and he is truth or said another way as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God 's eye you know it's something we have it's something we know it's not something that is hidden the question is do we have it do we look through that same guiding eye that Jesus himself looked through the scripture says I will guide them with mine I you know earlier in chapter 32 and verse 5 David says this I exalt I acknowledge my sin unto thee my unbelief and my iniquity which we know is pursuing your own will you know it's following some other leadership have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin Selah you know this is David in prayer asking the Lord to forgive him for pursuing some other leadership other than God's eye iniquity this is a constant struggle for all of us I think you know not to be led by something other than God's eye but you know then David makes this statement in verse 6. for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found there's so much to unpack in that statement you want to know what Godly looks like it's someone who's constantly pursuing the leadership of God's eye not Blind Faith or blind trust but the guidance that his spirit gives as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God you know the last statement that David makes in that verse in a Time when thou mayest be found you know there's certainly all kinds of scripture that deals with the time that he may be found but you know Jesus once told the religious people of his day John 7 34 ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am thither ye cannot come and of course this stirred them all up and they began to wonder what is this what this was that he was talking about but he goes on to verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water and then John goes on to explain in verse 39 but this he spake this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive he later said in John 14 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things God's eye God's leadership for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found not blind faith not wandering around without guidance but having his View his eye on on any matter I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine I that's our promise you know I'm grateful that we can have God's eye this morning we can have his View on any matter but it's all about do we pray for it do we seek that in the time when he may be found for this shall all that are Godly pray I want to go ahead and read Psalm 32 this morning it's just a fantastic chapter but I would also encourage you to listen to that tape God's eye I think it's a wonderful sermon let's read this together chapter 32 blessed is he whose transgression is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no guile when I kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long for day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of Summer silo I acknowledged my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin Selah for this shall every one that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance see them I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine I be not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee many Sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord Mercy shall Compass him about be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous and Shout for Joy all ye that are upright in heart amen God bless you may have your seats amen [Music] oh there's Not Afraid cases

to read in Romanian and I'm just gonna translate in English I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man and every branch that buried fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit s now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abiding me and I and you know as the branch cannot bear fruit from it for it of itself no more can e except e abide in me he that abideth and

and let your joy might be fulfilled amen [Music] let's also turn to First Kings chapter 18. all right we're just going to read verse 30. and Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him [Music] and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord okay and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening of the evening sacrifice the Elijah of the Prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day our God in Israel and that I am that servantages you may have receipts foreign [Music] I'm preaching the gospel into a message Church the last time I preached might have been maybe nine ten years ago but we know that it's not us she is but it's the it's the Holy Ghost the holy word that leads and that brings the anointing over the word it's not after what we know in our knowledge but it's based upon the revelation of the word that he brought down through the prophet of this last age before I uh bring you the word this morning I would want to bring before you this morning the testimony of my life and how God based on Allah through the harmony of the law of God okay um we I grew up in a family of a Pentecostal family daughter all my life and uh around 19 and 70 but Intimates my parents came to the Pentecostal denomination at that time yeah so there was a time or season into the into the culture where there was there was communism and and religion was really was cut down it was strict and anybody that would want to give their hearts to the Lord or get baptized they would have to go in the evening time where people wouldn't see them they would have to hide from the authorities of the government and I remember that my parents they went into the wintertime when there was when there was ice and all the rivers were frozen and the brothers that were taking them to get baptized our spot gatza they actually broke the ice from the water and that's where they were baptized this was a system when I was six years old and I came and I grew through system of the Pentecostals and the first Contact that I've Came Upon this message was somewhere in a bus uh there was there wasn't uh at that time in the country there wasn't an ability to own a car because it was expensive yeah and all the transit thing that I was doing was through the Public Service public service yes and and going to my job and as I was traveling through the bus uh there's a man that came to me and he just asked me a simple question he said is there three gods or is there one God there was the first Contact Prima impact primer impact it was the first impact to be convinced of either one of those things three gods or one God from that moment on there was something that moved inside of unfortunately the Deep call in the Deep from that moment the feeling of the Liberty a Christian and how it should have been lived uh situations you know the situation yeah the the stability I would say of the of the message uh in Europe there was a second hand Revelation and it had a lot of everything honest it was a negative influence and really what the message was searching foreign it was because he carried me through all my life and uh in about 1984. I got married I'm trying to shorten it up a little bit the Lord took me through through fourth spiritual team Shinto experience into a very special uh way of taking me intro experience it was a unique relationship between God and man um in 1984 I I got married with my wife sister Deborah yeah and I was from another city and my wife was from another city she around this is a Universal Credit there was a level of Christianity uh sotia and where the wife there was there was there was a connection between the wife and the husband and how you can feel from the Lord the unity exactly like it to be your wife there was that that connection you can feel it you can just see it you can see personal attitude you can see it in their attitude you can see in the way that they were comporting my important yeah between between husband and wife exactly it's it's really what unites a husband and a wife and then in 1985. my firstborn came into the world and uh in 1987 my second child came my second child that was born to the family at about five years old the Lord he he wanted to take us through a test I want to tell you something and Christianity is a process at the school and vets you learn through three weeks and then you come you have a test in the process of maturity he teaches us but then there was also a test he will always be next to you and at five years old I under I I we found out John had leukemia she is he was a very subtle child he was an aggravator energetic he wasn't really energized or she at five years old we went to him to the doctor and I will um she was a uh it was a female doctor yeah from Russia from from Russia she was from Russia and she was 70 years old at that moment he always aligns them from the wave he knew in the beginning to line them out she Dr Rochester and this doctor told us after all the results and the tests that they've done on the child uh Mr Stefan foreign to be able to prolong the life of the child I need these medications right here 80 of his cells were already cancerous at that moment and he only had 20 left of of life at that time you couldn't find such medications so we reached out beyond our borders and uh outside is this is all we can do as a human ability but in the light of the lord we understood the test but it's because it's a test of our life I went home with my wife chances and I said you know what we have a God that's not changed he is the same yes yesterday today and forever you know what um we Bow Down On Our Knees we went back all the way down the line of our life and we wanted to see where in what moment maybe we faded away from the Lord we fell in a way and we went and repented my whole family and my whole church at that moment in three months the child ended up having zero children cancerous cells three years this is God today he's 37 years old he's never received a sickness he heals forever This Is Our God in 2001 the Lord um before this actually and I was I was a servant into the Pentecostal churches at that momentia through a missionary that came from Norway translator and I was a translator for the ministry for about eight years um and totaches steam within all this time yeah uh which organization within all this time the organization she uh and in the things that I was involved they tried to promote me to send me to a theological School a university a University Vancouver in Vancouver for your life they were wanting to promote me to send me to a Biblical School there was only one thing that I had to do is just take a test I'm not this tool I took the test it was one point foreign that kept me away from passing who was there it was God it's a legit you understand there's a lot of things that we don't understand all we have to do is we believe that he is in control of all things for you and your life for your family nothing is done unless it is from his plan from the beginning the Lord was able to bring us here to the states uh it probably fought to look at supposed to spoon taught the detail darling it may be a lot for me to go through the details but for also the spoon but I want to tell you in all these little things the hand of the Lord it was with us it protected us I just want to say one more thing that the Lord's done for me and my family in Los Angeles after living in the Los Angeles area for about six years in Springfield Missouri the Lord moved us into Springfield Missouri uh there the Lord had another plan he takes us through his plan at that moment I had three weddings in one year the museum the Lord wanted us to grab all that needed to be grabbed to come into our family before he can bring us into Texas to the message to the message we came here complete after the plan of the Lord the Lord and your life takes you he he leads you mean and the ways that your human understanding cannot understand we have to be stabilized in the word of God and in his truth because Isaiah says my thoughts before that I know of you I'm going to departure I have thoughts of Peace of joy all these thoughts God has for us uh the Lord has blessed me with three boys and two uh two girls and the father and my oldest daughter she was playing with Lydia with with Lydia my shout out to my other daughter my smallest daughter while they were playing together somehow the arm got twisted she oven and there was a vein that that erupt it burst they burst yes Venice part the the vein bursted and we went to the doctor she doctors and the doctor said her arms it's um it's dislocated we have to put it at a cast six weeks it was wrapped in the cast and my daughter she was crying day and night after six weeks we we went back to the doctor they took down her cast and her hand was not her arm was not uh all her arm was red around flutter it was swollen and it was just it was just uh it was uh blue dark it was dark blue and then the doctor saying that something something's not right we have you have to go to another doctor another hospital we went to a major Hospital there called Cox in Springfield and after they did the x-rays avazut they seen the hand here has got two two bones because because at that moment she sat with her arm in six weeks in the cast since the blood that bursted and leaked through the hand yeah he created a pass she uh and that in that past also it ate the bone it was dissolved she's witnessed right here the hospital is right there awareness and Dr rasfos and the doctor said we don't think that we can save her arm see 15 years teaching you in one day come the test 10 days 10 years 10 years he's teaching you and there's one day that comes with the test how do we pass are we are we going to be stabilized in the words are we entrusting with all that we have within us there is a elderly doctor and uh and that's what they told us that we can't we don't think that we can save them um so that way we can get a special pediatrician from Kansas City from Kansas City she yelled and him well explain to you the process and what they would have to do to uh so that could say if it's going to be capable enough to save the arm or not we have to go back to God we have to go back see all the things go to the Lord you can go in the world you can run forward you can you can do all you want with all your intelligence with all your knowledge with all your money in one day and one day you have to go back to the Lord the last word the Lord has sovereign we came home we got on our knees again we were fasting we were praying we called the name of the Lord upon my daughter yes and all that they did if you've met Legion you may be seeing her arm a little bit you can see she's got a scar okay all that they did as doctors they just they just opened the uh the incisioned inside she said to be able to let everything that was infected there just kind of run out and drain to drain so drain all the you know the uh yeah all the fluids and stuff that were underneath the drain out this was all that they were able to do at that moment and every week they have to go in and change um you know the uh there was a process of cleaning it and changing the actual uh wrapping of it after one month we went back to the x-rays and we were just waiting on a highway while the resorts were coming and this time we actually we were there longer than normal and I went back to them I'm like what's going on what's Happening something's not right they're like we're gonna have to make another x-ray x-ray and they called me inside your own dispositive there was a a screen uh with uh yeah that had the light reflecting and all the x-rays were just put on that board next to each other one tells me here that it's missing that's just a complex but here's complete it's healed this is God works when he wants how he wants to do and through whom whoever he wants to church is the judge if legend for us one of those things that we have to understand Brothers we don't have to base our our our understanding upon what we know that we have to do is to believe he is right here listening to your prayers agreeing with what they're asking God will give it to him it's true if God is here everything is possible that's right did you believe that praise God Amen let him move move in our midst open your hearts let any any fault anything just be here we don't join the church We Belong amen we are sitting together like a family we have to support each other we have to care for each other that's the line of God Dr raspuss and a doctor said we don't understand Mr doctor uh maybe the science we'll never understand these things but we intelligence we understand because we have a dog that created the bone and through him all things are possible this is what the Lord has placed upon my heart church one thing one thing that I want to maybe bring to the surface yes that is that always God from the beginning he placed his word Kashi oleje as a law and all his creation yeah and into the habitat of him where he created for him to live in it was a law and the water didn't pass the borders from where he put them is it true when he separated the drive from the waters the waters couldn't pass through because we all understand the word the word says on top of the waters and God was the Supra was hovering upon the waters when he told that every seed s to be able to bring after its own kind is behind the words that was made that everything that was dead to come to life That's the Law of God of its kind when he said his word is it's a law Natura the nature that was created of God a spotless behind the the law of God yes the obligator it's obligated to be able to come to life the the fish of the sea they have the law of God that was created in the way and in the creation of how God created them to be habitat their habitat was to live in water if you take them out you understand yes I'm gonna go up and get a little air and then I could go all the way down to the bottom no the nature was created to live in that habitat the uh the birds and all the the fowls of the air was created after the law created them for them to live in response never do you ever can hear them say I will try to fly no no their nature they just spread their wings free free because the law was put there in them what was what was for what word they created for eign [Music] were created he made it that all the creation of the nature and the world to depend on the sun that's true when the sun aligns with the world shines upon the face of the Earth [Applause] no matter of what the condition is that's true shines upon the Earth time it comes out to life amen Luna yeah is the reflection of the sun and it transmits it transmits the nature of the Sun when the sun shines Luna the moon represents the the reflection of the sun the sun reflects and the moon shines the church yes it's the reflection of Christ which is which is the which is the Sun amen which shows the lights and the nature of Christ y behind the church says the authority of the word of God through the Holy Spirit which was given to the church they are Pune to put an application an application the law of God what I want to bring to the surface is that always nature lines up with the law of God of God that's true God drew a line God saved the natural seed because we know that Sarah represented represents the church that all of them had to come out of of Christ how much more the god that saved the natural seed s the Royal seed s through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ he brought the restoration of the church to the stature to the original stature and he changed the nature the sinful nature and without life to a new life the law and grace of God let's turn to Galatians chapter 2 verses amen Galatians to 20. I was crew I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live through in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and he gave himself for me in Christ Jesus Ephesians chapter 2 . from from verses 1 through 10. and and you had he quickened who were dead and trespasses and sins where in time passed he walked according to the course of the world of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh ended mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he had loved us even when we were dead in sins and quickened and had quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and had risen us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exiting Riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by Grace we are saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God not of The Works lest any Mass shall boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them that's true amen yes it's a no creature in Christ Jesus a new creation we don't think the same noise we don't we can't talk the way we want to we don't live the way we want to we don't dress the way we want to um we have to align of God the word of God is the law um which brings the enforcement and the authorities that stays behind the church and all that you ask in my name I will give it today are to agree if the church is together comes together the church is united in one mind and one of course one desires with the same love not made of man he's here he will grant it he will grant it I rather the play I'm a portion I have a portion of a tape if it's okay okay for 10 minutes for 10 minutes this message this message puts you in function just open your mind open your heart let him talk to you yes directly okay so it's uh the plate from 88 to 110. foreign for God has a law and his worries alone and God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims Hallelujah upon Satan say give it back Eva and he has to do it amen because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the law he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit said to make him do it heaven the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land for the land but the law of the spirit of God as the force Satan to give up that which he is unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Amen Souls of man he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God made him in his image Amen to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights Emma by the Bible to take the holy spirit amen and enforce this upon him I believe I just quoted the last meeting here I'm not sure but a brother came to Louisville from down in Georgia and left his car sitting over there and someone stole it and he had his clothes his wife's clothes his shoulders closed his brother Evan sure uh they're usually here they drive 1500 miles every day he wouldn't have service here coming in here to have service and the poor fellow is here without anything again 700 and something miles from home I didn't know what to do he turned it into the police but they had a big racket Louisville they were stealing cars and painting them and you don't have to have a title there to sell it and they'd make you a title in a few minutes say any number you want to put on it and so they were having a terrible time so we got down on our knees Cena Jesus wouldn't have had to do that for he was the word now we are not the word the word of the Lord came to the prophets they wasn't the word but the word come to them but Jesus was a word he didn't have to pray he was God himself but we are are His prophets his shirts who the word of the Lord comes to him then the prophet is Vindicated by whether it's the word of the Lord or not but what he says comes to pass so then we had a scripture here that Jesus said wherever two or more are gathered in my name and if they will agree I'll be in their midst and if they will agree on touching any one certain thing and asked it don't doubt it they shall have what they've asked it'll be given to them now there's there's the law yeah now the one it's here to enforce that law is the holy spirit amen how about people who don't believe in the Holy Spirit would reject people see you're rejecting your own peace and mercy now we got on our knees about five name a brother Fred zoffman and many of the others is there four or five man and we knelt down and I pleaded this case before God and then I took the word of the promise and sent it forth the great Holy Spirit as he took the word discern the summons oh and broke and I saw a man going towards Bowling Green Kentucky with a yellow shirt on driving this truck the Holy Spirit come upon him condemning and he turned around about halfway I saw him come back and park that car on a certain street over across the river here I raised up and told the brother thus saith the Lord and when they started out they went on the road and there was a car sitting there half empty with gasoline where the tank had 50 word had been filled up just enough taking halfway to Bowling Green and bring him back now those men are sitting right here this morning is a witness what is it enforcing and if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or a daughter of God we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God [Music] [Music] that's the enforcement restore it back to its natural condition again a man's sick babysitting woman's sick see they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce are clean not our clean it's our plane because God give it to us amen by stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the the law of Giver the Holy Spirit himself is sure the agent of God to see that it's done that way amen now the only way he can work is when you're letting him work see you've got to believe it there's a law oh if I ever get to my text there's a law there's a law given amongst everything you know a fish has a law and that fish can stand up here in water and he has a law within him if he'll just let go of that law that's in him he can sink Plum to the Bottom of the Sea [Music] won't break one sale you try to do it yeah that law is not in you you can't do it but the fish came he deflates himself with that air such a way that he there's nothing in him to burn something and he's made that way he knows it and he can enforce that law the taking Plum to the Bottom of the Sea and then racing back up again hold uh it was a law in Christ amen that law isn't Madden you're gonna bury him to the deepest Crayola deepest seed of the the lowest Hound Eva there's a law of the spirit of God that'll raise him up again amen a bird has a law not its body's material its Earth Balance sets on the earth here but it has a law within it the weight spreads its wings it can fly upon out of sun that's against science they claim it's it's Earthbound gravitation has told me your vacant defied gravitation lift itself right off of it go right on out because it has to put that law that's in it to work and it's built to possess that law now I'm beginning to feel religious now we have a law the law of the life in US amen we don't only thing you have to do you're made and born and placed you're in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to knock down to the devil we've got a law that's a law of the Holy Spirit the only thing you don't have to do is know how to let go and let God you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work when you let go and let God that's all if the feast said wait I'll catch my breath real good uh breathe up a little oxygen and I'll see if I can go down no he does that he'll burst open me amen the bird says I see how fast I can run down here maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down see he's got to know how to control how that law can control him and the same way it is with us it isn't what we fighting pulling and hurrying and oh if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it is to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised and he claimed that he's given is yours and by letting go and letting God now if you if the officer was going to um uh going to take uh the fellow this Soldier property was going to take him to court and you keep pulling him back well I don't notice whether he should do this or not he'll never get him there just letting go that's the way you do and that's Satan just get away all the doubts and everything flee from your mind then God will raise you up amen That's the Law of God amen amen don't try just let it go and let God Amen do everything for us the the church has to line with the law of God the nature his nature and I want to take the scripture here in the second Peter chapter one it's the characteristics of the life of God I don't know second Peter chapter two chapter one verses three to nine okay according at his divine power had given unto all the things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue hereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence added to your virtue add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if all for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see a far off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins let's also turn to um First Peter chapter five what I want to bring into the surface is that God exactly the nature here in in the world that he's created has a lawyer the the church has a law with what we have to align ourselves into the Harmony and confirm the authority of the church if the law that he's created can't work for the nature it doesn't work in its Harmony straight to unite and work together it'd be it'd be a mess IAH that's why even in the church we have to align with the word of God that creates the law and it's the law that brings the authority that the Holy Ghost applies of God upon your life you understand um what I want to show you is in which we have to align ourselves to putense so we can apply the love of God so when we when we cry out Lord here I am what would you like me to do for you education the Elder which are among you I exhort who I am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy looker but of but of a ready mind neither as being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock and when the chief Shepherd shall appear he shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not the way likewise ye younger submit yourself unto the Elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisted the proud and give it grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you amen there's the line there's a line [Music] from an old nature a sinful nature into a Heavenly Godly nature let's also turn back to Ephesians chapter four I I'm hoping that I'm not being too long are you okay from 11 to 13 through 13. Ephesians chapter 4. and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the prefer for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in a in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ the Lord placed a a linear or linear a line and biserica in a in a church and kind of thoughts within everyone we have to align conforming to the word if the law can be applied it doesn't have authority he says Lord I've done all these things according to Thy Word so the Holy Ghost can assist the application of the Lord within the alignment of the church and his word that's true amen I also believe that the The Fellowship of brothers and sisters and the uh uh uh as a church former we are forming the body of Jesus Christ correct okay all the understanding that is that the church it's not something that we consume we only come two hours in the morning two hours two hours in the evening maybe on Wednesday another two hours and then the rest oh that's that George does that church David says like this look how good and and how how pleasure it is that the that the brothers fellowship or live together if a portion or a body part is is hurting the whole body suffers that's truth if your brother is suffering and for us we don't care are we part of the body I want you to think upon these things I want you to just open your hearts and the desire to search for God Luther join the truth it's not to join them to be able to partake and be part of a church to be able to to feel with the one that's crying or maybe to be able to to to to be sorry to to be able to feel for the one that doesn't even have salvation yeah it's a legit you understand this is this is the mind or or the thoughts in the in the Church of God uh a lot of the times you know this this world the more we get involved into what this world is offering us with so much more we actually get away from the word a lot of times there's uh there's there's coming in our life uh um selfishness selfishness you know uh you know I have my own problems uh um let everybody else think upon their own things no no we us we are family we have to be able to carry the burdens for one another when the church aligns to be able to function and even here in the church I believe that the deacons have their place to be able to watch over the church to be able to discern the church to the church um the um the causes of all the the the the requests or maybe burdens inside of the church being able to to carry each other's burdenska um brotherly kindness and fellowship to be able to pray for one another and created to be able to trust one another important and to be able to [Music] hold each other's burdens foreign deviated a little bit from the word and the the altar that the offerings were coming on foreign two opinions how how long do you want to do that how much how many how much more do you want to hold between two opinions and serve other gods asked us he says today which God is real and what I want to bring to the surface a lot of times our personal family Alters a lot of the times they're torn down to be able to bring a evening sacrifice in the presence of God is it true it's the fourth important it's very important brothers and sisters uniting or maybe the restoration of the husband and the wife it's repairing the relationship between fathers and children you see reparations and builds the the restoration between a pastor and a church based upon the Altar and the lean the the line of the word of God if the musicians can come another relationship this this altar that needs to be um rebuilt it's between the church and Christ how we arrive down in that relationship re-established reconstructed to be able to get into the line of the world because we want the church here to grow we wanted to be alive to be able to be present here truly amen I'm trying to find the proper way to express something meaning God put something inside of me three names uh is he he put um Brother David he put him on his heart like um like uh like a like a burden yes it was a burden upon his heart David Brother David and brother Samuel Maurice's yes brother Randy brother Randy she's Vernon sister Heidi yeah yeah sister Heidi is these four these four situations your souls the Lord put on my heart I may not understand but he put him as a burden upon my heart and he can't change Jesus Christ and not for this world because the the one one of the the man of the Lord said it like this what would it benefit a man to gain the whole world if he loses his soul foreign if we can maybe play change my heart of God please if you're okay we can stand together she is from our own Ministry to the ministry to hear to be able to serve and to be able to serve God under the law of his words and Sister Sister Heidi Haley yes to be expressed to today we're applying the law of God do you trust God Amen is he here amen if he's here all things are possible Brother David are willing to come and all the church pray for you right here [Music] amen we put up right now we put a border on there like to pray for you all right good the whole church please please just pray to myself [Music] the ministers it's not the church if you can come and pray for Brother David we he needs this prayer he needs the support father Matthew brother Andrew if you are willing to come and pray for Brother David and other ministers [Music] [Music] just pray before him Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Christ we pray with everybody with everybody Lord knowing that [Music] before it is is [Music] amen I I'm asking from the bottom of my heart at home you know maybe pray before the Lord God is is moving his church it's not it's not any more longer to play church it's not any more longer just to to wait and wait no we have to go and work from the for the king amen he's our King he's our our Lord our savior he give us everything what we need nothing everything what we need nothing he give us everything we just have to apply the law of God in us in our life God bless you God be with you thank you God bless you foreign he said it was 10 years since he had preached I'm surely grateful that he accepted the opportunity took me two years but we finally got him here you know I I really enjoyed what our brother said you know it's like being a part of an army if you're all in an army and you all have a gun what good does it do if you don't pull the trigger or shoot the bullet you know what I mean and I I just uh put it very simply life's in a Warfare we're in a battle and we've got to fight and if you're not taking the supernatural the promises of God the supernatural the the spirit of God and taking that spirit of God and those Supernatural promises and applying them to your circumstances and believe that God is going to do it amen yes I know two brothers that are going to be restored because somebody's applying God not through psychology not do nothing praying amen believing claiming a promise and putting it in the hands of the enforcer to go out and do exactly what he would say that's what we've been invited to today by the spirit of God to do to take the word that you know the promises that you know the things that you believe sit back and look at your circumstances take the enforcer which is the spirit of God and say Lord I'm taking this word I'm taking this promise I'm placing it into your hands now I'm believing with all of my heart because you spoke it right in your word I'm now enforcing and I'm challenging Satan and I'm taking this word and I'm enforcing it upon yes do it for yourself too

don't pray for all those things you and I pray for I pray for wisdom I pray that we can take the path that God wants us to do and that we can be people that live by the word of God and not only move Satan out of our lives but move Satan out of the lives of other people because we know who we are I believe that with all my heart I really appreciate it this this morning with our heads bowed our hearts turns towards him this morning is there something in your life that you would like God to do even if it's for yourself this morning or a Deliverance that you'd longed to have we know we've

Forefront you'd like once again this morning and say Lord I haven't placed these things on the altar in a long time Lord I've heard about building my altar up and so father what good does it do if I
