this service unto you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen amen happy to be gathering his presence this morning i want to help welcome everyone in the house of god those that are home streaming we welcome them also as you invite with mike so i'm reading amen god bless you good morning you know there's it's funny how there are certain words in the scriptures or whenever we talk about the lord that you know our mind automatically goes in a certain direction based on 2 000 years of religious teaching you know one of those words is judgment you know whenever we hear the word judgment you know in our minds we think of you know the wicked our reserves to the day of judgment and judgment looks something like fire and brimstone raining down on the on the nations right but you know if you look at webster's dictionary it says this the judgment is an opinion or a decision that is based on careful thought it's the act or process of forming a decision after careful thought the act of judging something or someone the ability to make good decisions about what should be done you know certainly if you are standing before a judge and you're guilty of crimes a verdict of punishment can be an intimidating and a fearful thing but if you stand before a judge and his judgment is is that he declares you innocent of all charges that's the sweetest judgment in the world judgment can be a wonderful thing you know what matters really is the person rendering the judgment it's the character of the judge determines how he renders his opinion when looking at something you know certainly if you know of a judge that is you know evil or corrupt or you know otherwise not fair it's going to be a fearful thing to commit yourself to his judgment but if you know a judge that is that is fair and just and moral and merciful you're you're willing to commit everything to that judgment and you love it right you know proverbs 29 2 says that when the righteous are an authority the people rejoice but when the wicked beareth rule the people mourn and there was a time when david had committed a sin of numbering the people when the prophet kind of came to him with the word of the lord that the lord was not happy with him for that his response in first chronicles 21 13 was let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of man so all these examples of judgment being potentially a wonderful thing you know there is no other judge i know that be more willing to commit myself to than the chief judge what other judge is there that can look at a situation and say neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more or thy sins are forgiven thee right you know but what's interesting is if we look at psalm 106 in verse 3 and we're going to be reading out of 106 today says david makes an interesting statement he says blessed are they that keep judgment you know so not only is judgment something that you can render or something that you can receive but the scriptures talk about a people who keep judgment you know seven times in the in the children's of israel in their journey across the wilderness the lord instructs them to keep my statutes and my judgments not just the things i say but keep my judgments right you know what's interesting now is we've just talked about how the lord is a righteous judge and that a judgment can be something that's rendered but now the lord talks about committing his judgment to a people now you keep his judgment not just have him be the judge but you keep his judgment think about that the very judge who would look at a people or look at a situation and declare one thing clean or one thing unrighteous now commits judgment to a people for you to keep his judgment for that people to keep his judgment how many times did the first church age messenger say let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus right beginning to talk about the fact that you judge as he judges right first corinthians 2 16 says for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ you know and he says later on in first corinthians know ye not that ye shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life think how precious it is you know for us who have believed that who whoever received the judgment you never did it in the first place to take it one step further and now he commits judgments to you who are his to judge as he would judge to keep his judgments as it says in psalm 106 3 blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times so as we look at that today you know maybe we could look at judgments just a little bit different than think about the solemn duty that we have to commit ourselves to him for his judgment that he might commit his judgment to us for us to judge as he would judge so what we're going to do is we'll just read the first 12 verses of psalm 106. it's a big one so we'll just read the verse 12 this morning together it says praise ye the lord o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever who can utter the mighty acts of the lord who can show forth all his praise blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times remember me o lord with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people o visit me with thy salvation that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that i make glory with thine inheritance we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the red sea nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness and he saved them with the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them left then believed they his words they sang his praise amen amen god bless you and have your seats this morning amen let's just worship the lord this morning let's sing hosanna [Music] with me [Music] with me [Music] send me oh [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]

wonders and your grace and your mercy towards us [Music] your tenderness and your kindness and the blessings you've bestowed upon us [Music] we marvel that through your goodness you have chosen us and spoke into our hearts and we feel so unworthy coming before you but yet you so graciously invite us into your presence lord how could we ever measure your might in your power but we asked this morning that you would visit the hungry heart today that you would be our portion we ask you to be with us this morning as we come to praise you to exalt your name to speak of your greatness in your goodness to do fellowship in the revelation you have shared with us we ask you to please come [Music] we invite you lord with humble hearts and unworthiness into our presence this morning in your precious name lord jesus we beseech the father amen god bless you may be seated this morning you guys can wait a moment and we're going to have a baby dedication but first of all i'd just like to say that we've instituted a few little procedures i could say are safety procedures because so many of us are wanting to come back together and everything so what we've done is we've just asked us like as far as wearing masks and and i know that all these different things are becoming very controversial and and there's people out there saying now mass doesn't do anything and there's other doctors that say this some say that we bought something thermometers for the church in case anybody wanted to have their temperature checked so we'll have those but then they came out the other day and said that taking temperature is no sign of anything i just think the whole thing's confused and yeah i just really do i don't think that man even knows what they're doing because there's only one truth and that's god's word but so what we but you know to be good neighbors and to put forth an effort uh to keep us as safe as we can we've made a decision that kind of like you do in a restaurant you know you put your mask on you walk five feet to the table you sit down and you take it off and then you have it off while you're eating and then you put it back on and walk out so that's kind of what we're gonna do when we travel in and out of church we'll just put our mask on when you have your seat you can take your mask off we'd like to sit the best we can as family units [Music] and and so am i not on now i'm on so if you didn't hear any of that it's okay anyway wear masks going in and out just like a restaurant sit with your family as much as possible you might be a teenager and can't stand to sit with your family then i could understand that like my kids they used to sit away and and uh but everybody would walk up to him and say you're a mcgarry aren't you and they're like how do they know that you know and so you know we know who your family is so you sit with them if you can sanitize your hands as often as you can if you come in and out of the bathroom sanitize your hands if you don't want to touch anything just feel free to wear gloves feel free to wear a mask in the congregation and outside you know you don't have to wear a mask outside if you feel like you want to wear a mask outside try to say for you know four to six feet apart try not to shake hands or hug one another if you can help it if you can't help it i understand it's instinctively to me when i see a brother i just give him a hug you know i don't ask if he's infected first or if he has any symptoms and i don't walk up and take his temperature but also we don't want to be irresponsible like there's not a problem and a lot of people are having problems and i don't know why some are and some aren't but we want to show respect so um that's what um we'll kind of sort of cover that but now it's the good part we have a baby dedication and and uh and you know i i guess it's pretty obvious my love for brother billy but we're gonna we're gonna dedicate billy jamallah and bowie this morning and i told billy i said billy you had to name him billy jr he said no he says it's uh judita's gonna name this baby and she named him billy jr so i like it and we all like it you know we could use another billy amen and so uh let's just sing it as brother billy brings his beautiful family and and we'll dedicate his son to the lord and in god good amen so let's just sing that as we come oh bring oh let's sing it [Music] this all right god bless you now when i show you this little boy you're going to know why he's named billy jr hey man may i you think he'll let me in this awesome oh so wonderful boys and god bless you all we're going to have billy pray for his son and then i'll pray for him and i'll give him back to you and i'll hold the mic and you can take him and pray for him all right god bless you and we dedicate in the lord what a gift of the lord what a what a beautiful family we just praise the lord for him so much in our heart amen our gracious father we come to you this morning you're the gift of all good gifts lord father god before the foundation of the world father you just knew everything and and we come to you this morning father dedicating junior into your hands and father we pray that you just guide him in the path that you've said before for him lord bless him and give us what we have need of in order to raise him right strengthen us father we need your assistance lord and we know that everything you give us will come and give it back to you because you're the best protector we can build walls we can do what we need to do but lord at the end of the day if you don't watch then all of that is in vain so we ask that you bless him lord you be with him all his life father you increase the love of between brothers and sisters and you help them and guide us and give us the wisdom and the knowledge to raise them we'll commit them to you in the name of jesus christ amen amen let's all pray together and let's all ask a blessing on this wonderful gift of god our heavenly father we as a congregation each officer in the church each worshiper we all come to you this morning as a family and as a body and this family comes lord has there brought a new soul into the world a possessor of the seed of life and and of eternal destiny and we committed back into your hands lord that you would encamp your angels about that you would guide their footsteps and lord that you would bring him to that place that time in life where he meets you face to face lord where he has a personal revelation of your existence lord and he thirsts and hungers after your spirit lord to the day that he knows that he's sealed lord we just ask that you keep him until that appointed time yes and father that the life love that you've given him father that it would be blessed that it would prosper and be in good health and it would be a great radiance of the goodness of god and the blessings of god and lord how that one can do well when they serve you and put you first this whole family father we dedicate the whole family to you they're servants father of the kingdom they labor for your people still upon them abundance and goodness father that they might share abundant health may they prosper so others can be blessed by them keep them father we pray we commit them into your hands today as we dedicate little billy back to you today in jesus wonderful and precious name we pray amen amen god bless you thank you brother god bless you thank you everybody this morning uh we love the lord this morning don't we all love the lord amen we want to have a little bible study and and you know sometimes you have things on your heart and you don't you sense they're there but you have no idea what it is it's sort of maybe sometimes it's an emptiness or it's a longing of some sort or you just feel that there's uh something missing and so you begin to listen and uh you you you start to watch and you start to listen and you start to to feel you're you're you're trying to make contact with something that uh looks uh to give you a uh some sort of leadership or a message and i kind of had that emptiness in my heart and the other day at the men's meeting some comments were made and it stirred me up i i was brought to this message that um is really i think a timely message if if the lord will open it up to us and we could just take a few moments on on on uh studying it if we could uh i certainly have not the ability to preach what's in this message it it it would take me years and years to do it but just if we could take it from the general concept of it because so i want to listen this morning to the first uh 20 minutes of the message called thirst and again i i believe something in my heart about the message and the messenger that not only did he make specific statements but he also revealed if i could say that principles of how that god works and and it was spoken to open our understanding and in to enlighten us concerning the things of the lord and as you listen to brother branham break this he begins to talk about thirst and what thirst is it's an aching desire but i i hope that in our listening to this that we can understand what the prophet of god the concept that he's trying to bring to us is that god made us to thirst he made us to hunger he placed something in us and he calls it a warning system and we just listened last week to the warning and then the judgment god does does not judge a man without warning him first and we talked about being aware of that of that warning to understand that that everything that's going on has a purpose behind it and it it should be a warning to us it should be a warning to us that man doesn't have control over things the way he thinks things are moving rapidly in a lot of different directions things are transpiring that we didn't feel would ever transpire and so so we don't want to be negligent in our responsibility and so we talked about that last week that we have a responsibility to seek and pursue that we're here for and so we want to continue sort of on those same thoughts i i notice uh that judith i believe her uncle and some of her nephews are here we welcome them brother sanders i see you god bless you this morning and anyone here that we don't miss so we're going to listen for 20 minutes to a thirst and this was preached in in 1960 919 so it's not it's not too uh uh long before the prophet of god left the scene and i believe that it's before he left the scene he i i just he said that no a man knows that he's fixing to go and i honestly believe that brother branham knew that his time had come he may not have known how that he's going to go even though i've heard people tell me that brother brennan made comments concerning the fact that it might possibly be an auto accident that would take his life but i i with that knowing that he must have known that he made a great effort to make sure that his message was put out there he put two messages in the last six months if i could say of his time on earth that are very hand in hand and it was leadership and thirst and so as we listen to this we we've got to come back to the point that we are not taking this message as academia it is not a finished message now let me say this all the way through it's not a finished message that's done with and is left there to study it is a living message that is still leading us and guiding us if we will listen to it if we will approach it uh that's why that i like to play a portion of the of of the message because we want to go to the source that's leading us and i i just don't want to be one that would always give you my revelation and i can only preach to you my revelation i can't preach to you brother random's left revelation i can only tell you what he said but it's still an individual affair and so as we listen to this he's talking about this thirst and another place he talked about leadership so i think it's something that we should deeply consider and ask ourselves is this working in my life and so from that standpoint that we want to go forward from here so if the brothers would prepare we're going to start at where brother branham reads his scripture i guess i left my glasses somewhere um anyway could you see if i have a pair of glasses back there uh but it's uh in in paragraph i i think it's paragraph 17 if i'm not mistaken thank you paragraph 17 in the message and he's going to read the scripture uh found in um uh psalms i believe it's 42. so what we'll do is yeah paragraph 17. so what we'll do is we'll stand and then when he's done reading the scripture then we will be seated when he says i think david in the writing of this psalm must have been in distress so when he makes that statement so let us go ahead and stand and have a word of prayer and let's listen closely for the next uh um 20 minutes to our messenger as he begins to bring us the the concept and the understanding of the thirst that god put in a man's heart and so we'll ask the lord to bless us father bless blesses this morning with the hearing of this portion of your word father we could certainly sit and listen to the whole message and we still would never comprehend all that is there because it is you and your eternal but we asked this morning that you would speak to us and that you would enlighten our understanding that you would increase your word to us and father that by listening it might resonate something within us and as we hear what it is that he's trying to tell us what it is that we should be conscious of and aware of what it is he's trying to enlighten us and show us and and bring us to see because it is beneficial for us and we're needy of it so we ask you to bless this word to us this morning you've anointed it you've sent it to be spoken just the way it was spoken now we ask that you would anoint our ears that we would hear it just the way that you intended for us to hear it we ask this in jesus name we pray amen god bless you i'm sure you'll enjoy the next few moments now many of you like to kind of look into the bible where a minister is reading and i want to read tonight a couple three verses out of the psalms psalms 42 just for a way of having a text and i've got some scriptures written out here and i want to refer to them if i can as we go along in a next few minutes to speak on this subject the psalm of david david wrote the psalms now while you're turning i might say this many people say well is the psalms inspired certainly they are they're anything it's it's uh this bible is inspired whether it's history whether it's songs whatever it is it's inspired jesus said have not you read what david said in the psalms and then i think psalms of course is songs and if songs are inspired of god which i believe they are and prophetic also i hope i'm standing that day when this song comes to pass there's going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet by and by going to meet you and greet you over there in that home beyond the sky such singing ever heard ever heard by mortal ears it'll be glorious i do declare and god's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air oh i i want to be there at that time now psalms uh 42 as the heart painteth after the water brooks soul painteth my soul after thee o god my soul thirst for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god my tears have been my meat day and night why am i what are they continually saying to me where is thy god i think david in the writing of this psalm must have been in distress and it usually takes distress to bring the best out of a man and really uh that's when god gets down to when we fast many times to get herself in position and get herself out of the way and i think when david got in these places then he began to meditate on the lord begin to think about the things many times god gets us in tight corners where we have to look up sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital or a bed somewhere so we can look up to see where the great blessings of god comes from now the word i want to speak from tonight one word out of the bible and that is found in the second verse uh thirst the word of thirst i was looking in the dictionary when i was looking up this word i was thinking about a sermon one time i preached on uh thirsting after life and uh talking all the psalms too when david said thy statues i believe are more precious to me than life now i was looking and thinking about that word thirst so i looked up in the dictionary to see what it means and here's what webster says it's a painful desire a painful when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you uh now uh that's uh it's not an unnatural thing to thirst thirst is a a natural thing it's just simply something that god has given us that we could to give us a desire for something sometimes god has also has given you a a control tower something that sets inside of you that that controls these different desires and this uh thirst this control tower that sits in a man's heart is something that god give him to to warn him of the desires that's needful for him now there is two different kinds of thirst there is a thirst physically and there is a thirst also spiritually i would like to read this what david said again my soul thirst for god for the living god not some historical or some something that happened some years ago or or some tale that someone told but for the living god a god that's ever present and his soul thirsted for that god not for some historical something now we find god gives the control tower to you to give to you the things that you need now the control tower in you is what directs you and this thirst runs in on this cold uh control tower and tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking the control tower in the body and in the soul also there's a control power in the body that tells you the need that's needed in your body and it's brought to you by thirst also there's a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirit and and you by this can tell what kind of a life is controlling you when you uh when you can see what your desires are then you can tell but that what kind of something is in you that's creating this desire that you have see there's a certain thing that you thirst for and it and it can tell you in your soul what this desire is by the nature of the thirst that you have i hope that's you can understand that there is a control tower of the soul and one for the body and each tower is a warning collar for the needs of the other each one calls to the need for what the caller is calling for it sends out a wave of warning for instance the flesh thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit uh desires for the things that's in the soul desire is and many times these war one against the other we find there what's the a great trouble to date that too many people try to live between those two desires for one of them desires the things of the earth the other desires the things of heaven like paul said describes it in romans 7 21 when i would do good then evil is not when you try did you ever have that inexperienced christians that when you're trying to do something that's worthwhile going to make an effort to do something that's good then you find out that there is the devil on every hand just to upset you everything that you'd and that's one good thing that i'd like to uh say this at the christians might know that when you're when you're starting to do something and there's something always trying to upset you and doing it do it anyhow that's the devil they're trying to keep you from doing what's right now many times i meet people it's prone to be a little nervous when they find out that they're trying to do something and and everything's just blocking it off on both sides and say it might not been the will of the lord see uh don't let the devil lie to you like that the first thing is find out whether it's the will of god or not and then if you want to know what's the will of god look into the bible there is a thing that's that sets you straight is the word of god and then if you see it's in the word of god for you to do it like phrases seeking for the baptism of the holy ghost many times i've run into people say well i sought for the holy ghost and i just couldn't receive it i don't believe it's for me every time i get down i get sick and i go to praying if i fast i get sick and if i try to uh stay all nighter against the sleepy i i can't get off my feet remember that is the devil because god intends for you to have the holy spirit is for whosoever will many times you find when you're prayed for in a meeting for divine healing then the next day you find out no doubt that the devil will make that twice as bad as it was the day before see remember that's just satan trying to get you away from the blessing that god's got for you don't you listen to that fella so you always press right on i had an experience of that just recently on the road to africa if i ever had any time that the devil ever did press at me was to go to africa this last time it become one of the finest meetings and times that i ever went overseas i got i believe more things accomplished in that little time that i was there besides my hunting trip than i ever did at any time i always thought that those churches didn't want me there and come to find out i had a letter from someone that it was uh oh they didn't want me there all the association had found out it was one man with a letter head from an organization that said we don't want you he meant him and his family see so then when i got over there i think he just we that was he and his family and it wasn't the people at all so now it's a great field open up for us to see what paul said when i would do good than evil is not you let a young convert come tonight to the altar of somewhere here and this tabernacle are are out across the nation and just remember tomorrow mother will be more angry she ever was dad will be all upset and all the school kids and everything just goes wrong because it's satan trying to get you to turn around he's trying to run you off the path when i would do good then evil is always not now let us look at the thirst and let's see whether actually a thirst is a natural thing i've had people tell me oh i never did i believe it's just for some people to want to be christians oh no that's wrong it's actually a something that's associated with every human being it certainly is true when we come to this country in the early days we found the indian chair and the indians don't they were heathen at that time they worshiped the sun or something as long as they are human there's something in them a natural thirst calling out for god somewhere back in the jungles just recently back there uh 480 miles from the closest civilization a little small town of about three thousand people at vira and mozambique we found natives that didn't even never seen a white person uh found a native girl she had no clothes on any of them harley have clothes on she was sitting up in a tree and i was tracking a line and there was i heard something like a human being screaming this native girl sitting up there walleyed holding a baby and what she was scared about that's your only protections get up a tree from a lion leopard or something or some animal and she'd see me and heard it was a human being but when she looked and seen a white person she had never seen one in her life see and she was scared to death see but when we find those people even in that primitive condition back there they were still worshiping before we called the lion in they poured out some mealy meal that's what they eat on a little leaf and clapped their hands and called on the spirit of some great something they didn't know where like a patron saint or something to a catholic to protect them that they wouldn't be uh killed during the time of the charge of this line see it's something natural it's not an unnatural thing to thirst for god it's a natural thing it's just something that you should do god has made you up like that and it's no superhuman it's just actually a common human being it ain't just special for some people they say well i've seen some people live such a victorious life if they're constantly on the housetop they're praising god wish i could feel that way well the reason you're feeling that way it's a thirst in you and uh that's just a natural thing it's for every person to thirst for god now we'll take some of the natural thirsties first let's take for instance thirsting for water as david said you're thirsting for the water thirsting for water the body is in need of water and if you don't supply that thirst you'll perish you'll dehydrate and you'll the you won't live if you can't get water to that thirst to quench that thirst of the natural body you'll soon perish you won't live long you can live longer without food than you can without water because you can fast for 40 days jesus did i suppose without without food but you couldn't do that long without water you would just simply dry up and die you must have a water and if in the thirst that comes on you well it's to show that the body is in need of something to keep it alive the body's got to have the water in order to stay alive you're 80 something percent uh water and petroleum anyhow and you've got to take these sources in to keep you alive as i've said if you neglect it you'll perish the thirst also is an alarm it's an alarm clock that thirsting the soul sets off alarm clock a little buzzer inside of you that tells you that death has lurking now that if you don't get water pretty soon you've got to die and it gets louder and louder until finally you keep putting it off and you'll die because it's alarm clock like david described it here in the psalms as a heart painteth after the water brooks soul painteth my soul after thee oh god as the heart painteth after the water book i've often thought as reading of this of david david was a woodsman a hunter and he hunted deer of course and many uh we in this day hunt them the heart is a deer and we find if you ever seen the dogs the wild dogs or grab a deer and uh usually they got like the coyote fang and he can grab the deer right above the bur the ear here and swing his weight he cuts the throat of the deer and the deer doesn't have a chance then but sometimes the the dog like in africa there the wild dog will grab the deer right in the flanks if he misses the throat he'll grab the second time at the flank and if the deer is strong enough and quick enough he can shake the dog off the deer is much faster the dog stalks him when he's not looking and when he's upwind from him and and he uh you don't know the the dog is near and then when the wild dog grabs him if he's real quick he can throw it all and but when the dog comes out of the flank he's got a whole mouthful of the deer's flesh or when he grabs at his neck sometimes he'll cut close to the jugger vein and miss it and the deer shaking him will pull a whole chunk of meat out of the deer's throat then the blood begins to run and then the dog will come right on the trail of that blood after the deer and as the life of the deer begins to dwindle as the blood which is a life stream to the body as that begins to dwindle down the deer gets weaker and the dog dan or the wolf is right behind the deer now if that deer can't find water now water has something in it that when the deer drinks the water it stops the bleeding but if he don't get water to cool him off then the blood keeps flowing out faster because he's running keeping his heart pumping but if he can ever get to water the deer will live now there's a great lesson there see david's saying here as the heart painteth fall of water broke my soul painteth for thee oh god now that deer knows unless he finds water he's gone he just can't live i've tracked him many times after being wounded when he hits a stream of water he'll cross in and get a drink go up over the hill come back down cross get a break of water and go up you'll never catch up with him as long as he'll follow that stream but once when he leaves the stream if he can't find another water brook somewhere you'll catch him right away and now the deer knows that so he'll stay right with the water where he can get to it right quick how could you imagine a deer with his nose up he's been caught out somewhere where there's no water and he says as the heart thirsts or painteth is the thirst after the water brooks my soul thirsts after thee o god unless i can find you lord i'll perish i i can't go unless i find you and when a man or woman boy or girl gets that kind of a thirst for god he's going to find something i think but when we come at it just kind of halfway well i'll kneel down and see what lord does see you're not really thirsting yet it's got to be a thirst between death and life and then something takes place the deer also here he's uh we find uh and he is also has another sense of smell that sets off an alarm in him when his enemy is near he's possessed this uh little creature with a sense to protect himself and he's uh he's got a little alarm in him a little something that he tickles his nose one of the enemies near you can get in the wind of the enemy and he knows that you're there and he's gone sometimes a half a mile away he can smell you and get away or the wolf or any danger he's able to sense it because that he's made up that way he's a deer by nature and that sense in him is just one of the god giving senses to him to live by and i know i thought comparing the deer with a man that's thirsting for god before the enemy gets there there's something about a child of god that when you once are born into the spirit of god receive the baptism of the holy spirit there's something about the person that can sense the enemy you can take a man when he's taken the scripture and reading the scripture and trying to inject something to that scripture that's contrary to the scripture a man that's filled with the holy ghost can sense that right quick there's something out of the way when he gets into a place and and uh that little certain sense in there that uh it's done to protect your life you you mustn't you must never go for anything unless it's exactly the word of god you must stay right exactly with that word and now and we are uh secured with that sense as long as we're in the holy spirit you can go to reading like for instance somebody say now go to read mark 16 and say and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues or take up serpents or drink deadly things it will not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover now then you find a person get up there and say now that was far the apostolic age that now right quick if you have received the holy spirit you've been endowed with that sense it sets it off there's something wrong there see you try to explain it away that's for another day that really you don't need those things today but jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe there's a little something sets off in your little buzzer and knowing that that's wrong and that's the way of death because jesus said if we add one word to this or take one word from it our parts taken out of the book of life not one scripture we must take it just the way it's written and god watches over his word to perform it and we know that's got to be just right so therefore no matter what a church would say what anyone else would say if you're born of the spirit of god you become part of the bible god told ezekiel he the prophet he said take the scroll and eat it then the prophet and the scroll became part of each other and that's the believer when he receives the holy spirit the holy spirit wrote the bible and the spirit of god is the word of god my words are spirit in the beginning was the word the word is with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us hebrews 13 80 is the same yesterday today and forever and when you are a part of that word oh then let something come up contrary to that work because the little buzzer sets off right quick see it's to warn ya that death is in the road we should never do that there is a also these thirsts are just natural they are natural for the christian they are natural for the human being now you'll have to go home and finish amen let's just take a moment and just meditate a little bit on some of the things that were spoken there's many more things that were spoken but he talked about when uh there's something about a child of god once he's born of the spirit of god receives the hat baptism the holy spirit there's something about that person and he talks about that could sense the enemy he talked about there's something about that person that they know what's right and they they know what's wrong um and he begins to talk about that thirst and he says then that thirst comes down it says he says he says we find a person get up and say now that was the apostolic age that's not right quick if you have received the holy spirit you've been endowed with that sense it sets it off and there's something wrong there they're trying to explain it away that's for another day that really you don't need those things today but jesus says these signs shall follow them that believe see there's a little something set off in you a little buzzard you knowing that's wrong and that's the way of death now that that's what we want to just fellowship a little bit about this morning is if i could say it is that buzzard it's that alarm in our hearts it's that thirst that we have now you just heard how he talked about every man has got something in him that he he's that he's thirsting after something okay it's a natural thirst in him or a hunger or a painful desire and we as children of god and david being a child of god he hungered after the reality of god and i believe that our thirst in this day comes from what's promised to us in this day a man hungers and thirst after that which god provided we know that principle in the message deep calleth to the a deep in other words that deer could have never went after water if there wasn't water for him to go after it isn't that correct so excuse me i got to get this open i can't let my wife see me open it the way i have to normally they twist these tops off for me that my my thumb is getting stronger so so what's promised to this to us in this day and i i hope i can share this with you this morning the way that it's in my heart but you you can only thirst after something that's been provided like the little boy you know the eraser he hungered or he thirsted after sulfur because he needed sulfur but he couldn't thirst for the sulfur or desire the sulfur if there wasn't a sulfur there to supply what he was hungry for and we know that what it is that we are thirsting for is faith i believe that the real believer today the real child of god today is hungering after a faith that produces the promises of god he wants to he wants to have faith because the promise to us is i will restore saith the lord i'll restore what was eaten but the clunk palmer worm the cankerworm the caterpillar the locust all that was chewed up i'm gonna restore uh bef before the great and dreadful day of the lord i will send you elijah the prophet and he shall restore back the faith of the father now we can study the prophet elijah and we can compare him and we can come and go over the vindicated truths that brother william mary and branham was the vessel was the man that god chose to dwell in to bring past the prophecy of malachi 4 5. every part of his nature every part of his design god made him that way he even shaped his mouth in a certain way that he could speak words just the certain way that he could speak them and and so without a shadow of a doubt this morning and we're not preaching to the world we're preaching to our local congregation with not a shadow of a doubt in the world we know that that picture of that pillar of fire is the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel i don't know how big it was but this is a capturing of that pillar of fire coming into form that it could be seen by man and so we know that and there's not a shadow in our hearts this morning that brother branham was a genuine prophet sent from god i don't think there's a question with anybody sitting in our midst this morning or listening to us if they didn't believe it i'm sure that it didn't take them long to press the button he said i'm going to something else but to you and to ourselves what we listened to the last 20 minutes was music to our ears how many learned a few things how many heard some things that inspired them america it increases your understanding it's a blessing so i don't think that's a question we've settled that but when he says i'll restore back to you the faith that our fathers once had i think that creates in us a hunger for that faith a hunger for that faith we are looking for that faith if not we're looking for a maybe we're been distracted to go after something else but we know that there is a rapturing faith and we want that faith because without faith it's impossible to please god man always has set up his own religious form his own religious services his own religious program i was raised a catholic i i swung incense and i lit candles and i sang hymns and i rang bells and and and i did all those things but none of them was what god provided to feed my soul none of them fed me and we just heard that there's an alarm that goes off a warning that goes off that command knows if i don't get this if i don't receive this if i don't have this i'll perish and that's what religion is it's a covering it's a it's a false satisfying of a natural desire in a man for god i don't want a religious ceremony i want the faith that the apostles had because that's promised to me to be restored in this day that i can believe like they believe and have what they had and produce the works that they produce for these works shall follow them that believe so they're hungry they're they're thirsting and i believe that's what we're thirsting for we don't want a substitute which is covered in the pages following we don't want a substitute we want what god's promised us because he promised us what we need and he put a hunger in us for what we need it gets something that's in you and and it it's something that's there because we know that if we get what it's provided it will keep us alive and as a pastor or as a person that has maybe the lord's allowed to be in a place that you can see from you talk a hunter 100 finds a high spot and he gets out with his glasses and he looks and he glasses and he looks afar off until he finds the area that that animal's in and then he looks at the terrain and he figures how that he's going to approach it you just can't start off in the middle of a thicket because you just heard that he just the prophet told us that animal's got all those instincts he can hear you he can smell you but if you know where he is then you can approach him amen and so uh we find out that outstanding from a place that you can see you begin to realize that a lot of people's faith is dying and and look he told us why faith dies faith dies because the the the enemy fights it did you hear him say that the minute you want to grow the minute you want to do something more with god everything evil comes up everything about here comes the church when the church is supposed to be moving into the power of the living god and here comes a virus that's trying to shut the whole thing down and everybody just rolls back everybody's depressed that's what he said david must have been in a depressed state he says sometimes god's got to make it that way i i i just love what was said we don't have service tonight so i'm going to use brother tim's pruitt's uh strategy preached two and one don't tell kim i said that he said i think david writing must have been distressed and usually takes distress to bring the best out of a man that's when god gets down to when we fast many times to our selves to to get ourselves in position to get ourselves out of the way and i think that david he got to these place and he began to meditate on the lord and begin to think about the things and so we're we're telling him here that that when when and he goes on to explain what happens when we get to that place that that we want to hunger for faith that evil is always present with us it's always there to fight us but the hunger for it is something that god put in us and i believe that that's what if this church that each one of us should be painfully desiring is the faith that was once delivered to the saints and i believe that you do desire that because it's placed in you to desire at he said there's a control tower in you one that desires the things of the flesh and one that desires the things of god and man gets in trouble when he tries to live between those two towers i didn't say that he pointed that out to us when we get caught in the middle how many knows what that being caught in the middle what the bible describes that as luke warm it's half hot and it's half cold he's that's what he warned us he said i would that you either follow the control tower of the world or follow the control tower of the spirit but if you try to follow them both i will speed thee out of my mouth because no man can serve two masters and the lord does not want to share his leadership with anybody not me not this church not any mother minister god leads his people by himself by his spirit by his word how he does it so you have that control tower in you he said don't let satan tell you you don't he even said last week a man got that sense that he's going to pass that god's going to take him that he better get it right and he dismisses it oh that's just some funny feeling don't dismiss the conviction of the holy spirit don't dismiss god being in you talking to you so we realize that our thirst is for faith how many would like their faith increase today man i mean we'd all go amen amen now i want to make this remark there's a difference between unbelief and disbelief unbelief is not disbelief you understand that why don't we just read a bible story let's turn in our bibles to mark this 9th chapter and the 17th verse i had a young lady let me know that uh i have to give more time for them to find their scriptures so they said just listen to when the pages start wrestling and then we'll hear it so i hope you've all found mark uh the ninth chapter and the seventeenth verse okay and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto the unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he he taketh him he teareth him and he fomet and he gnashes with his teeth and pineth away and i speak to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not and jesus answered and said o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him he straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he's he said of a child and oftentimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us and jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth now this is the part we need to play and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help doubt my unbelief you see he didn't disbelieve but he realized that his unbelief needed help you understand what i'm trying to i'm trying to draw a distinction between disbelieving and unbelieving because we are believers we were are made believers but we what we need help with is our unbelief what is between us and the next level what is between us and higher ground what is between us of knowing and possessing what is it that's keeping us right that's what we want that's what we're hungering for we want more in that i believe we want more of that i want more of it you want more of it we want the faith that's promised to us by god's word amen let's just follow the story and when jesus saw that the people come running together he rebuked the foul spirit and said of him thou dumb and death spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more unto him and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead insomuch as many said he is dead but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose and when he was come unto the house the disciples asked him privately why could not we cast him out why didn't we have the faith that's a good question you know i believe they ask because they want it they were desiring to have that ability i don't know if i would call it an ability but to be able they let me say it this way for our behalf the desire to be in the position and place the life the mental attitude the spiritual growth to be able to minister that deliverance to people no christian ever does anything as a show of power you're not going to prove to god that you're uh some sort of of spiritual being by performing a miracle he already covered that a long time ago depart from me you doers of iniquity i never knew you god never knows you by the works that you do he only knows you by the motivation that's producing those works you can do those things for vain power for vainglory for filthy lucr which paul says they do these things for that he says but nevertheless the gospel is going to be preached in others he knew some soul some seed out there would be touched even if it came from an unbeliever but god judges a man by why does he desire that power i'm sure many of you quickly you bible scholars had went to this the story i believe it was simeon was it simeon or simon that came to the disciples and wanted to purchase the power because he wanted the power for glory he wanted the power for prestige but jesus never ministered the power for glory he even said i do nothing of myself but it's only the father which is in heaven they came to me said master you're a good master he says no there's none but good but my father which is in heaven and when he tried to purchase these they they say why do you tempt the holy spirit so i believe that part of helping our unbelief is the re-establishment and understanding of our heart of the right motive and objection that ought to be in a christian's heart amen to go into all the world and preach the gospel what has freely been given to you freely give amen and as we continue and the disciples come in his house and ask him privately why could we not pass them out and jesus said to him this can't this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting now so we know that we see there that there's a difference between unbelief and faith and if i could say this and start putting words which i'm not adding to or taken away but the private god said that faith and revelation are the same so when we read this scripture he said lord help my revelation he said oh you faithless generation oh you generation that lacks revelation if you would have known the scriptures you would have known that they spoke of me if you would have had revelation you would have known that i was supposed to come and that these were the works that i would do it was prophesied of me that i'd heal the blind that i would raise the dead that the sick would be made well if they had revelation and that's what he told them search the scriptures search the scriptures they are which that testify of me and so we find that that what that they were lacking what their unbelief was was not disbelief i hope i can draw that real clear you are believers you're made believers what we've got to battle is the unbelief and you know it it's hard to you can't believe in something that you don't know exists but you've got to and i don't mean see as with your eyes but you can't believe something you don't understand or you can't you don't know exist that isn't revealed to you now you may not doubt that i tell you that under here i have a pot of gold because i'm irish and i'm of leprechaun descendancy and anybody knows that a leprechaun goes around with a pot of gold now most of you disbelieve it some of you simply possess unbelief there's actually some of you who would really like to come around here and look but you will never believe that until i show it to you i'm trying to get somewhere i don't want to just be preaching at you i want you to understand that i'm part of this struggle amen that's right you understand i i am wanting to overcome my unbelief i'm here saying lord help me with my unbelief i believe lord help me with my unbelief and so we we see that you can't believe something that you doesn't know exists or you don't understand or you don't see now when he talked about this deer and he talked about this unbelief that comes roaring in he said don't let satan don't let that shake you he said that deer he hungers and he thirsts after that brook because he knows in that brook there is life if he can get to that brook drinking from that water is going to help that unbelief that's what's going to keep him from the wiles of the enemy and so i believe that there's a thirst in the believer for reality the real not a man-made system he said that we just heard him he said david thirsted for a the real living god not all the stories about god not all the churches about god not all the conversations about god but he thirsted after meeting that god he wanted to drink from the fountain of life we could read in the scriptures let's just turn because this we want to see that that this thirst this hunger in a man to overcome his unbelief is something that god put in him as a warning sign as an alarm that goes off something that says what did he say it said i'm lacking this it's a warning that you're in need of something i'm lacking this i'm without this i need more of this doesn't mean you disbelieve it means you're suffering from something you're in need of something and if you don't get it you're going to perish in others if you don't get this that wolf that lion that dog is gonna catch up with you but if you can get to that water and drink and get to that watering tree and get to that water and drink you'll live you'll get away amen so we can turn to the scriptures in matthew matthew 5 and the 6th verse we know this is the sermon on the mount leslie and i have been to the place they say is the mount i don't disbelieve but i have maybe some unbelief i have been to the place they said that jesus was buried and there's another place over here they say he was buried you know i don't know i know one thing though he's got to be buried in here many of you know this scripture matthew 5 and 6. blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled we could turn over a page or two to matthew 7 7. and we we find out that that jesus was preaching this thirst in lady osea he preached this thirst behold i stand at the door and knock any man that will open up and let me come in i will sup with him i will feed him i will give to him what he's thirsting for what he's hungering for what he has need of i'm jehovah jirei i supply what that you have need of and though he begins to say here he says ask and you shall it shall be given to you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open or what man is there of you whom if his son asked bread will give him a stone no don't don't overlook these things there's more meat here and what that he's talking about than than justice in the story he said if you seek the right thing he'll give you the right thing if a child seeks bread he's not gonna get anything other than bread he's not gonna get a snake that's right he's not gonna get a stone but if he seeks if he hungers if he thirsts he shall receive ask and you shall be given seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened fear not little children it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom what man is there of you whom if his son has bread will give him a stone or if he asks a fish well give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to do good give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him so we understand that this thirst that he's talking about this this uh thirst for righteousness this seeking and fine it is the is the pursuit you understand that dear panetta another he not only did he thirst but he pursued the water he put into motion the actions to receive what that he needed [Music] and i i don't know how to express this the way that i want but the scripture says if you draw nigh unto god he'll draw nigh unto you and look if you take the step in that direction he's taking a step to meet you you've got to understand that taking the step is the process of relieving the unbelief you got to know i lack this that's right i lack an understanding i lack a revelation the prophet of god said it can never be stressed to the church the importance of revelation if you pray for anything pray for revelation revelation is the cure of unbelief [Applause] it's the pursuit we're not disbelievers amen but i think what this world has done to us is first of all to substitute fear and put us into protection mode and defense mode you never gain ground on defense in any battle you establish your position you try to take the higher ground where you can see you disable a position where you can launch an offensive because you'll never defeat this enemy in your life in the world or anything on defense revelation is sought after revelation is sought after because there's a thirst in you that you need revelation there's a thirst in you that you need understanding father i'm thankful that you've hid it from the wise and prudent and revealed it unto babes such as would learn are we done learning am i going to say that all the tapes are there all the books are there all i've got to do is say what's on those tapes and book i'm telling you i need to learn of me this is the word of god come me all the other have you been learned i'll give you rest come learn of me amen let me let me open this up to you and reveal it to you lord i have unbelief i need revelation i hunger and thirst after it there there's this there's a uh we he said he put that control tower in you the human body has one the spiritual body has one your control tower is the seed that god put in you but what happens if the one control tower is the only one that's we're getting the message from rent bills car payments food clothes housing land and jesus is trying to tell us something he's been trying to tell us something he knew that that gospel wasn't going to go to that age he knew that it soon was going to be taken from him from them he knew those horse riders were coming he knew it was going to fall into the ground he knew it was going to be resurrected again in justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit but he knew that he was going to come again veil himself in the human flesh of the prophet and preach to the gentiles the same gospel hallelujah he put that tower in there and that tower's job is to thirst it's to warn it's to create the hunger is to create the desire a desire to know more a desire to see more it's a it's a pursuit so you have to understand that a hungering is not a physical hunger what happens when you're hungry nobody knows what they do when they're hungry i i saw jack in the box pop up and then i saw danny's pop-up and mexican food pop up and all kinds of things you know you know some of you go to the refrigerator some of you do something but when the minute that thing in you starts to ring that warning alarm you begin to pursue it and if you don't it grows and pretty soon you say i'm so hungry i could eat a cow or if i don't get something to eat i'm gonna die i mean you make all kinds of wonderful statements oh i wish i what i could eat right now i'd like to have one of those man i wish i had one of those torpedoes from mona lisa that's my sandwich shop you just get you you actually begin to put in your mind foods you put in your mind things that you want to eat you start looking for what what's going to satisfy this what can i come up with that i'm going to go eat and be satisfied with you ought to hear what brother brown says about cokes and flavored water in this book he said it will never satisfy never does nothing sugary ever satisfied but there's a pursuit when this alarm goes off when that comes to your life you know i'm really not living the way that i should i'm really not as close to god as i ought to be i'm really not uh uh you know i really don't understand that it doesn't mean you're disbelief it doesn't mean that you're you're not doing everything that you know to do you can be absolutely living everything and god can turn that alarm into your life because he wants to give you more of him [Music] we want higher ground we want a clearer vision we want to be empowered that's what he said you go to that room and wait there until you're in dude with power from on high and so there's a crave so don't that that alarm tower going off is a blessing just like being convicted of sin is a blessing it's not a condemnation it's a warning sign from god to say correct your path it's not punishment it's correction so he says that so there's a process that's got to take place in the believer when the alarm goes off they have got to know what is it that i priest pursue what is it that i seek after what is it that i ask for what is it that i knock for to be opened unto me to help me with what i have need of what is it lord what is it that i'm lacking if and i think that it's too simple for us to fall into condemnation you're not condemned because you're thirsty naturally it just means that you need to drink water and he said you can't keep putting it off you know what happens when you freeze to death you get to the point you don't think you're cold can you imagine getting to the point you just haven't drank water so long you don't even think of water and then pretty soon you just fall over with some sort of hypothermia and things start shutting down pretty soon your nerves start shutting down and you don't start thinking straight and you can't even think about water you can't even think where there's to get water and slowly but surely you begin to shut down and that's what the enemy wants he wants to shut this church i don't mean this local assembly the church of the living god he wants to shut it down because he knows if it ever gets the true revelation of the two spirits working within the framework of the church and gets the true and right revelation it will become an invincible army that's the last thing satan wants to see is an army of faith the last thing he wants to see is men and women that believe every word of god not just sitting saying i believe the word of god i'm going to protect my belief that's not what brother brother brahm said he said who will draw their sword and come stand with me shoulder to shoulder and meet the enemy and so we realized is that there are there's got to be a pursuit in us now we always look at the pursuit as being overcoming and there's i got a weakness i watch things i shouldn't watch i've got a weakness i listen to things that i shouldn't listen to i got a weakness i love to hear gossip i just got to know what's going on i got to know what you think i got to know what you would do gossip never helps you it's like spiritual ear wax it just stops you from hearing the spirit it can our our answer is i'm going to stop doing this i'm going to fight it you know what you need you don't need the fight you need the revelation you need a revelation what is it in me what is it about me why do i possess this weakness what is it that i'm lacking and there's i need the weapon to stand i need i need to possess something from you lord to make me an overcomer because it's given to the overcomer to inherit the kingdom of heaven he promised if you open he will come and sup with you he will feed you the word of god he'll feed you what you have need of so there's got to be a pursuit and a panning and a thirst and a hunger so when the alarm bell goes off that we realize i need to seek him for divine answers i need to seek him for overcoming revelation i need to receive of him what that i have need of for the father knows what i have need of even before i ask but we have not because we ask not and we've got to start asking for the right thing and that right thing is faith and faith is a revelation you'll never muster up faith within your intellect faith is a gift of god that god gives you he shows you he opens your eyes he lets you see he make it known he makes it where you no longer have unbelief revelation is what takes unbelief away and so there's a desire within us and he said everyone that has this so this we know that that control tower that's in us is that seed but we need a revelation of what that seed possesses and what that seed is to produce amen and i believe that so many times we preach the seed as being one seed that's the same for everybody but the natural typing the spiritual when the seed donor puts forth his seed it produces a different life in every single child different characteristic different attribute different there's a difference in each of us that's why nobody can take our place there's not one clone that we're all trying to come to amen the pursuit is the revelation of the word of god that's been placed within us in other words the revelations that god has for you personally that are going to make you what that he wants you to be amen and he only has one way of communicating with you he only has one thing that he builds the church on and that's divine revelation so when you have that seal yes and you have that seed that means god's looked at the boxcar we talked about this at the men's breakfast it inspired me he looks at the boxcar and he says this buck car has been packed with everything that is supposed to be in it it is fitted and put together and designed and loaded just the way that i wanted it loaded and then he seals it and it sealed unto the day of its destination amen that means that car is sealed in you were sealed in when your name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world he saw you he knew you the color of your hair the statue of eye everything that you were and he said in that seed is every fruit that that tree will possess that seed has within it everything it needs to be what it was made and to produce what it's produced it's been sealed in there doesn't matter what the boxcar looks like have you ever had to watch a train go by man every now and then we'll come buy a a a car that's all brand new you know got northern pacific or bmmw or whatever the different santa fe on it and then everyone else comes by and you think it would come out of a subway somewhere got graffiti painted all over it and all kinds of spray can stuff all over and it looks terrible didn't matter what the outside looked like is what's packed in there what's packed in there that that's what that what it's look the car's been sealed you've all been sealed you're not disbelievers but what we need is a revelation of what's on the inside what's in me the word of god is in you but when we say the word of god i hope i'm not getting too long i'm going to close now but it's it's not what everybody else interprets the word of god it's not the general doctrinal interpretation of the message that revelation is personal to you i'm going to close with reading you say if i would have lived in the days of jesus i would have done so and so why you are living in his day you are living in his day you're living in the day when he returned back to the gentile church veiled in the human flesh of a prophet preaching the same gospel doing the same signs and wonders and trying to reveal to us the same god in glory we are living in his day what are we doing about it what are we doing you say well what what you done perhaps what the pharisees done they belong to church and deny jesus christ we always say today people are trying to say we compare we've got to compare the bible leaves with bible leave scripture with scripture that isn't the truth no it isn't the truth this greek word means this and this greek word means that the greeks themselves way back in the nicaea council and them writers back in there they had different forms one believed it this way this greek scholar meant this and the other one said this one meant it this that way what a fuss over it we don't need interpretation of greek scholars or greek words to know him is life the person jesus the person christ himself not comparing now don't shovel that off because we we compare quote with quote we compare preacher with preacher we compare church with church we compare excitement with this and with that and we we lose the individual pursuit of the divine revelation that god has of us do you believe god had a revelation of you to know him is life christ himself not comparing it's a revelation that god built his church upon and if we don't build upon the same church the bible said abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation all right the whole thing is built upon the revelation then and unless this is revealed to you jesus said i thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the wise of the world and have revealed them to babes such as would learn see the whole thing is built there you've got to know the person but you can't know the person without revelation the answer to the unbelief is revelation so don't ask god for the answer don't give god the answer don't provide god a program by which he can operate so you can get what you think you have need of god knows what you have need of before you even ask what we need to do is say father i need a divine revelation to overcome [Applause] i need a divine revelation to have faith i want to be better i want to be higher you can't work your way there but faith revelation the revelation of who you are the revelation of what you are the revelation of what's in you you're not going to receive something outside of what's in you he even said pray to him who's in you what's in the boxcar yes sir hey have we even looked have we really even asked him what have you endued me with what have you placed in my life what talents have you given me what what what what overcoming victory you ever meet someone that doesn't take criticism very well you might be giving them a compliment and they've already prepared a defense well you know that was a pretty good well i could have been better like davey was telling me he met a man the other day and the man he said to the david he said well to tell you the truth and the man said why were you lying before now you're telling me the truth look you you i hope i can just say this to you we're looking for the cow in the treetop we need a revelation of the word that was put in us from the foundation of the world not the universal worldwide yeah message peoples altogether belief in certain fundamental principles of the message we've got to go beyond that and individually enter into that secret chamber of revelation where god reveals to us our strengths our weaknesses our thinking our heart our emotions where we lay bear before him and he can operate on us he can remove the things out of our life that don't need to be there and he only removes everything god only does everything by his word he will give you the revelation to overcome with amen he doesn't just go take it out he gives you the tool the revelation so you can operate by divine revelation and faith and you can go to that devil and say get out of here i'm here to possess the gates of the enemy because this is my land it's how he works god does nothing outside of divine revelation he wants to reveal to you he wants you to know what he made you he wants you to know what you are he wants you to know not just who you are but what you are what virtues what powers what gifts what compassions what feelings that he's placed in you have we ever asked him have we really ever got there and say what am i made out of show me myself satan's got us a pr on a pursuit of theology and it's never been in theology it's to know the person i'd like to read this statement in closing before i close he says this he says the man is wearing the wife's underneath clothes she is wearing his overalls see just a perversion that's right you know when he talks about women's under garment clothes he's talking about bermuda shorts wow that's right that's what he's talking about he's talking about men wearing shorts and she's wearing overalls in other words she's wearing pants men are wearing their underwear that's what he's talking about and he said and that's the same thing it is with this nation with people with churches with everything oh god where is the end of the thing the coming of the lord jesus is the ending of it all so if you neglect to feed the holy spirit the word of god jesus said every word shall be by the holy spirit now listen now if you try to feed it the wrong thing if it isn't if it's the genuine holy spirit in you it'll know the difference now remember the word of god is what the holy spirit feeds on it don't feed on enthusiasm it don't feed on education it doesn't feed on church going it doesn't feed on theology there is a lot of difference between an inspired something and a theological standpoint of it all those theologians in the day of jesus my they had word by word page by page all laid out the messiah had to come this way that's exactly what it was and everyone missed it you know what jesus said when he come he said you are of your fathers the devil and his works you will do it wasn't revealed to them what the real word was see they missed those little corners like they missing missing it today if you will belong to this or belong to this you'll be all right don't you believe that you've got to belong to christ see it's there is the something in you hungering for christ there's something in you hungering for christ don't get off don't pursue this or think it's there where it is i'm closing now where it is is that little something in you that's thirsting if it's not there and you've got away from it or you've lost it or it started to die that's what the word of god's for the word of god say wake up i'm warning you you're getting hungry you're starving you're dying you're not being fed if you've gone a long time without a real divine opening of god's word to you and and you've just studied it and studied it and studied it and it's saying the same thing and intellectually you've got it down and it's not opening doors for you it's not empowering you it's not giving you overcoming power it's not raising victory in your heart the joy bells aren't ringing the you're not you're not full of glory you know you have joy unspeakable you have peace that surpasses understanding what you need is to pray for revelation [Applause] you've got to go back and get a revelation you're running on you're running on something that'll run out and one day your tank runs out what do you think's happened to so many people that have followed this word of god their tank finally ran out they ran on the old stories they ran on the old testimonies they ran on the sermons that everybody's preached they ran on the newest crave in the message whether it's who we are were predestinated our names written on the lamb's book of life they've ran on those things and they've ran on those things and it's the same thing now they go to revival after revival enthusiasm enthusiasm you can run around the church you can shout you can sing but without divine revelation you will perish the prophet god said second hand revelation is one of the worst things that ever happened to the church you don't want my revelation because you don't want my mind you don't want my life you don't want the things i have to deal with god gives me revelation according to my personal needs my personal makeup my personal approach and you've got to have it for you personally it's the personal revelation of yourself that we need we need the personal revelation of ourselves because what you are is christ in you christ in you is the hope of glory [Applause] the word in you is the hope of glory the hope of your glory lies in the word that he put in you the hope of the rapture is what he put in you that's the word that we need revelation of we need the hope and the revelation lord yes help my unbelief what is it that you disbelieve with or unbelieve with yourself you're your own worst enemy so god gave you something it's in there we need to pursue it we need to pray for it we need to ask for it god give me divine revelation anyway god bless you let's stand brother billy if you come [Applause] musicians would come and i really believe that brother brandon preached this message at the time that he did because he knew the time would come when man would no longer wish to retain god in their knowledge but they just didn't want him no more but let's brought our heads and let's ask the lord this morning you say brother david do you need revelation i need a lot of revelation do you have any unbelief yes i have a lot of unbelief i'm a believer i don't disbelieve [Music] but lord this morning helped my unbelief father revealed to me things about myself that only you know lord i always marvel that every time someone approached you you dealt with the secrets of their heart the things that nobody else knew [Music] you spoke to that inner man that inner place in the heart he never entered into a theological discussion [Music] even the woman at the well when she wanted to had a theological question you never answered it with theology you said if you knew the living waters that i had you'd ask me for a drink [Music] she said old master how how you've got nothing to draw with how how can i get this water he answered her go get your husband she said i don't have a husband you spoke true not only do you don't have a husband the one you're with not your husband but you've had five oh now it was personal now he was going with revelation to what she had needed now she was drinking from the fountain [Music] and what she ran into the city and said come see a man that's told me all about my life all about who i am and where i come from and what i've been through and what effect it's had on me lord and this morning we need that meeting at the well we need to cry out in our hearts this morning lord help my unbelief lord deal with me give me revelation lord i've studied for a long time lord i need something opened up to me i need you to show yourself to me [Music] and i need you to show me to myself i need a reality in order at the closing of this tape [Music] i was going to read it but your prophet told the story of the woman that she taught sunday school [Music] she went to church [Music] and for some reason she connected a disease and she was dying and he said the sunday school choir showed up to sing while she was passing away and the pastor was there to hold her hand and then faced with reality she screamed out i'm lost i'm lost and the pastor put out a cigarette and he went running in there and she said you lying deceiver i'm lost [Music] and they said oh oh go get the hype hypodermic needle don't go shoot her up with drugs and she was crying out for something real [Music] lord of the alarms going off in our lives and you said you promised us that you would set the alarm off that you put the control tower and i'm asking every heart in here this morning if that alarm's been going off in your life that you need more of god that alarm's been going off in your life but your nature and your personality isn't what it should be if that alarm's been going off in your life that you lack understanding [Music] don't turn it off don't call it's a little feeling [Music] it's a thirst in you calling because god's got something for you [Music] maybe you just don't understand why is my life the way it is why am i the way how did i get into this situation i never wanted to be here everybody else has got this and everybody else has got that and here i'm stuck [Music] i lived from paycheck to paycheck i never had anything nice lord or just my heart just cries out [Music] the whole he'll come by and talk to you don't let satan knock you out of the pursuit don't let him take the panning away from you don't let him take the thirst away from you seek ye first the kingdom of god if you'd like to raise your hand to him this morning [Music] say lord i hunger for more of you [Music] i've learned intellectually a lot of things but i desire a real divine revelation this morning something that i've never seen before that's made real to me lord i pray [Music] for myself i need a revelation that will allow me to overcome my weaknesses i've battled them for years lord but that's not the answer the answer is a revelation from you of the overcoming power that's in me lord help my unbelief i've exhausted the words that i have i've exhausted my mind to explain what's within me so lord once again i've got to rely that you would give each heart here a revelation of what's hid in your word this morning for i ask it in jesus precious name i pray amen god bless you [Music] to [Music] to you [Music] thank you [Music] i want you more [Music] oh [Music] here oh what [Music] [Music] you can satisfy [Music] [Music] just
