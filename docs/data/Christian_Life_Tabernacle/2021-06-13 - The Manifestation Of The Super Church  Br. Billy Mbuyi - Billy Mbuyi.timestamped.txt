[17:58] commit the service to the lord invite
[18:00] his presence
[18:03] heavenly father we are so grateful to
[18:06] you for your mercy and goodness to us
[18:08] lord for
[18:09] providing so abundantly for every need
[18:11] for the keeping hand that you
[18:13] have bestowed upon us lord we
[18:16] we couldn't even begin to lords to
[18:19] account for
[18:20] all the ways that you have blessed our
[18:23] lives
[18:24] lord all the benefits that you've given
[18:27] us
[18:28] lord we just thank you for your kindness
[18:30] your faithfulness
[18:32] lord for your guiding hand we thank you
[18:33] for your word
[18:35] lord we just want to be careful to
[18:36] welcome you in this place
[18:38] lord for without you this is just
[18:41] another gathering of man
[18:43] and lord we ask that you would have
[18:46] control of this service
[18:48] do as you would father we pray that your
[18:50] word would have
[18:52] dominion over everything in this place
[18:55] lord we
[18:56] take control of every spirit in this
[18:57] room that it would be
[19:00] under the submission of the word and
[19:02] lord we pray that you would meet each
[19:04] need
[19:05] lord that you'd speak to each one of us
[19:08] lord that you would just
[19:09] walk freely in this place that your will
[19:12] would be done in all things and we
[19:13] committed to you in jesus name
[19:16] amen amen
[19:21] we are uh going to read in psalm
[19:25] 103 this morning
[19:30] it's a very familiar
[19:33] chapter i think to most of us
[19:38] says in verse 2 it says bless the lord o
[19:41] my soul
[19:42] and forget not all his benefits
[19:46] you know and then of course the next
[19:48] several verses
[19:49] begins to lay out all of his benefits
[19:54] it's a five-part benefit plan
[19:58] that is better than any benefit plan you
[20:00] can get from any employer on earth
[20:03] you know for many of us when you go and
[20:05] you work for an employer that
[20:07] employer will provide you with a set of
[20:09] benefits in exchange for your time
[20:12] in exchange for your work in exchange
[20:15] for your commitment
[20:18] well likewise when you commit yourself
[20:20] to the lord he has a benefits plan
[20:24] you know that benefits plan includes in
[20:26] verse 3
[20:27] a total forgiveness policy
[20:31] a complete healing policy in verse four
[20:35] it includes a full redemption policy
[20:38] with an all-inclusive life insurance
[20:41] policy
[20:43] a hundred percent satisfaction guarantee
[20:47] and an everlasting term renewal in verse
[20:50] 5.
[20:51] i challenge you to find an employer who
[20:53] can give you a benefits plan like that
[20:56] and even when they give you one they
[20:58] will try to consume
[21:00] so much of your time that you'll have no
[21:02] time
[21:03] for the father's business and it turns
[21:06] out that the workload required for this
[21:08] benefit plan
[21:09] is very simple my yoke is easy
[21:12] and my burden is light you know i want
[21:16] to look at just one of those benefits
[21:17] this morning it says in
[21:19] verse 5 who satisfieth thy mouth
[21:24] with good things so that thy youth
[21:27] is renewed like the eagle
[21:30] i am reminded of the children of israel
[21:32] when they were delivered out of egypt
[21:34] you know while they were in egypt they
[21:36] were completely burdened down
[21:38] with the responsibilities that egypt
[21:41] laid on top of them you know they were
[21:44] led to believe that their very survival
[21:47] and their very comfort were based on the
[21:49] work that they were doing for pharaoh
[21:53] they developed a taste for the diet
[21:57] of egypt but it required
[22:01] their total commitment and there was no
[22:02] rest even though they
[22:05] had good things maybe to eat there was
[22:08] no rest there was no strength they were
[22:12] totally burdened down you know but when
[22:16] god began to perform his deliverance
[22:18] work he took them out from under that
[22:19] employer he began to put them under the
[22:21] coverage of his benefits plan
[22:24] it says in exodus 12 39 you can look it
[22:26] up but basically millions of people
[22:29] very very quickly leaving egypt with
[22:32] nothing more
[22:33] than the leftover bread they had from
[22:35] their night with the lamb
[22:37] they had no time to go and collect any
[22:39] of the food of egypt
[22:41] and they were unable to carry any of
[22:43] that diet with them
[22:45] when they were redeemed all they had was
[22:48] that little unleavened bread
[22:50] from that night with the lamb
[22:53] you know and as we read in exodus 16 he
[22:56] began to change their diet
[22:58] he began to feed them something that
[23:00] came from heaven
[23:01] amen you know he satisfied their mouth
[23:05] with a
[23:06] heavenly food source that sustained them
[23:10] every day of their journey
[23:15] you know and it renewed them to such a
[23:17] point that they never
[23:18] hungered again until they got to the
[23:21] promised land
[23:23] you know jesus was quoting from
[23:24] deuteronomy 8 3 when he was
[23:28] when he was fighting the temptation of
[23:29] the enemy
[23:31] and it says this and he humbled thee
[23:34] and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
[23:37] with manna
[23:38] which thou knewest not neither did thy
[23:42] fathers know that he might make thee
[23:45] know that man doth not live by bread
[23:48] alone
[23:49] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[23:52] the mouth of the lord doth man live
[23:56] he satisfieth thy mouth with good things
[23:58] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[24:00] eagle
[24:02] here's another well-known scripture
[24:03] isaiah 40 29 he giveth power to the
[24:06] faith
[24:08] and to them that have no might he
[24:10] increaseth strength
[24:12] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[24:14] and the young men shall utterly fail but
[24:16] they that wait upon
[24:18] the lord shall renew their strength
[24:21] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[24:23] they shall run and not be weary
[24:25] they shall walk and not faint you know
[24:28] we live in such an hour of pressure
[24:31] society you know our employer
[24:35] our school civilization all
[24:38] demands so much of us and it's
[24:41] you know they would have us pour a
[24:43] hundred percent of ourselves into these
[24:44] things
[24:46] you know it's getting so intense that
[24:48] even
[24:49] those among us that are young people are
[24:52] getting exhausted and burned out
[24:55] you know and it's gonna get to such a
[24:57] point that only those that have access
[24:59] to a heavenly food source
[25:01] will have a path to renewing their
[25:03] strength
[25:07] says in second corinthians 4 16 for
[25:09] which cause we faint not
[25:11] but though our outward man perish
[25:14] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[25:19] how many can say that they are
[25:20] participants in this benefits package
[25:23] you know aren't you glad that you have
[25:26] access to
[25:27] a heavenly food source that can renew
[25:30] you
[25:31] every day for the journey in an age that
[25:34] would seek to consume you utterly
[25:36] you know and i'm grateful for this
[25:39] benefits
[25:40] package he satisfieth thy mouth with
[25:43] good things
[25:45] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[25:47] eagle
[25:48] would encourage you to eat of this diet
[25:52] let's read psalm 103 together
[25:56] starting in verse 1 bless the lord o my
[25:59] soul
[26:00] and all that is within me bless his holy
[26:03] name
[26:04] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[26:07] all his benefits
[26:08] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[26:11] healeth all thy diseases
[26:13] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[26:16] who crowneth thee
[26:17] with loving kindness and tender mercies
[26:20] who satisfy it thy mouth with good
[26:22] things
[26:23] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[26:25] eagles
[26:26] the lord executed justice and judgment
[26:29] for all that are oppressed
[26:30] he made known his ways unto moses his
[26:33] acts unto the children of israel
[26:36] the lord is merciful and gracious slow
[26:38] to anger and plenteous in mercy
[26:41] he will not always chide neither will he
[26:44] keep his anger forever
[26:46] he hath not dealt with us after our sins
[26:48] nor rewarded us
[26:49] according to our iniquities for as the
[26:52] heaven is high above the earth
[26:54] so great is his mercy toward them that
[26:56] fear him
[26:57] as far as the east is from the west so
[27:00] far hath he removed our transgressions
[27:02] from us
[27:03] like as a father pity with his children
[27:06] so the lord pitteth them that fear him
[27:09] for he knoweth our frame he remembereth
[27:11] that we are dust
[27:13] as for man his days are as grass as a
[27:16] flower of the field
[27:17] so he flourisheth for the wind passeth
[27:20] over it
[27:20] and it is gone and the place thereof
[27:23] shall know it no more
[27:25] but the mercy of the lord is from
[27:26] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[27:29] that fear him
[27:30] and his righteousness unto children's
[27:32] children
[27:33] to such as keep his covenant and to
[27:35] those that remember his commandments to
[27:38] do them
[27:39] the lord hath prepared his throne in the
[27:41] heavens and his kingdom
[27:42] ruleth over all bless the lord ye his
[27:45] angels that excel in strength
[27:48] that do his commandments hearkening unto
[27:50] the voice of his word
[27:52] bless ye the lord all ye his hosts ye
[27:55] ministers of his
[27:56] that do his pleasure bless the lord all
[27:59] his works
[28:00] in all his places of his dominion bless
[28:03] the lord o my soul

[53:38] lord jesus christ we pray
[53:40] amen amen happy to be gathered in the
[53:44] house of god
[53:45] amen let's just open our bibles i want
[53:48] to
[53:50] read the scripture in the book of isaiah
[53:59] a very familiar scripture reading
[54:03] isaiah chapter 7 we're going to read
[54:06] uh start from verse 10
[54:14] it says moreover isaiah chapter 7
[54:18] verse 10.
[54:22] it says moreover the lord speak again
[54:27] unto hazards and saying
[54:31] ask thee a sign of the lord thy god
[54:36] ask it either in the depths or in the
[54:39] heights of it
[54:41] as i said i will not ask neither will i
[54:44] tempt the lord
[54:45] and i love the answer from isaiah says
[54:48] and he says
[54:48] hear ye now o house of david
[54:52] is it a small is it a small things for
[54:55] you
[54:55] it is a small things for you to weary
[54:58] man to weary man
[55:00] but will ye weary my god also
[55:03] and in other words letting you know
[55:06] don't be afraid to ask
[55:08] don't don't think you're tempting the
[55:10] lord it's
[55:12] for you weary men yes but for god it's
[55:14] not
[55:15] nothing is impossible to him ask and
[55:18] don't be afraid
[55:19] and it says but will he also reary my
[55:22] god also
[55:23] it says therefore the lord himself shall
[55:26] give you a sign
[55:27] behold the virgin shall conceive and
[55:29] bear his son
[55:30] and he shall be and he shall and
[55:34] and shall call his name emmanuel amen
[55:37] may the lord have the blessing to the
[55:39] reading of his word you may be seated
[55:41] amen i i just
[55:46] for a moment we just uh we'll
[55:49] like to speak this morning on
[55:52] uh
[55:57] we may not be able to get to the
[56:01] full thought of what we're trying to say
[56:03] this morning but i hope the foundation
[56:04] will be laid
[56:06] i want to speak on the manifestation of
[56:09] the super church
[56:10] the manifestation of the super church
[56:14] it says remember we read it said is it
[56:18] it says and he said unto him oh he house
[56:20] of israel
[56:21] it is a small things for you to re to
[56:24] weary man
[56:26] to you weary man but we were also
[56:29] rearing my god therefore the lord
[56:32] himself will give you a sign now
[56:35] where brennan preached a message a
[56:37] wonderful message called the
[56:39] i was listening to i believe it's called
[56:41] the super sign
[56:44] and this is where my inspiration uh just
[56:47] came from
[56:48] and he he begins to describe
[56:51] the time in which we're living in and
[56:54] and he speaks it gives a very
[56:56] description
[56:57] of the time and the circumstances and
[56:59] the things that are surrounding us today
[57:02] and andy and and i he he says something
[57:06] that just
[57:07] strikes my heart and and he mentioned he
[57:10] talks about the pharisees
[57:12] and he says they are able to discern the
[57:14] the signs of the time they're able to
[57:16] look around and
[57:17] in fact in matthew 16 verse 1 through 15
[57:21] 1-5 it says the pharisees also
[57:25] with the sadducee came and tem and
[57:28] tempting desiring him
[57:30] that he would show them a sign from
[57:33] heaven
[57:34] and he answered and said unto them it
[57:36] says when it's evening ye said
[57:38] it shall be fair weather for the sky is
[57:42] red
[57:42] and in the morning it will be foul
[57:44] weather for the
[57:45] today for the sky is red and lowering
[57:49] oh ye hypocrites ye can discern the face
[57:52] of the skies but but cannot discern
[57:56] the signs of the time in other words but
[57:59] running is pushing putting such an
[58:01] emphasis such an uh importance
[58:04] on the need to discerning the signs of
[58:06] the time
[58:08] and that's why i love the one of the
[58:10] things that's so wonderful about
[58:12] you know even the message that we
[58:14] believe in it's not so much
[58:15] some things that if somebody can come
[58:17] and tell you
[58:18] oh you know the the and predict and tell
[58:21] you about things and
[58:22] and things that you you have to figure
[58:24] out how they're gonna
[58:26] happen or you know as you you hear the
[58:29] word but then the interpretation
[58:31] somebody has to come and give you
[58:32] interpretation of what just happened
[58:34] but sometimes the prophet puts it in
[58:36] such a plain language
[58:38] that we can look around and see it says
[58:41] this what i just read is what
[58:43] just happened what i just saw here is
[58:45] exactly what the messenger told us about
[58:48] this
[58:48] what i just read here is exactly what
[58:50] was promised was going to come to have
[58:52] so the time determines what god is about
[58:55] to do
[58:56] the times determine how we should
[58:58] prepare ourselves
[59:00] the time determined what kind of what
[59:03] word has been promised or what the
[59:04] promise for that time is
[59:06] what we're supposed to be doing what
[59:08] work are we supposed to be doing
[59:10] where are we supposed to put our
[59:11] emphasis on because the preparation that
[59:14] we put in
[59:15] depends on the time that we're living in
[59:18] but when i'm often time will say that in
[59:20] this age we couldn't be building boats
[59:22] because that's not the promise of the
[59:24] time it will say that promise of this
[59:27] time we couldn't be
[59:30] go out in the wilderness so try to go
[59:32] across the red sea because that's no
[59:33] promise
[59:34] that's not the promise of the time we
[59:36] couldn't be doing anything else outside
[59:38] because it's not the promise of the time
[59:40] the promise of the time is there is a
[59:42] word that a messenger that god sent in
[59:45] this generation
[59:46] and is bringing people out of the
[59:48] denomination
[59:50] and getting us ready for the rapture
[59:52] it's not complicated it's very simple
[59:55] it's when man injects their own thinking
[59:57] trying to interpret it this way or that
[59:59] way
[1:00:00] that's when everything falls apart but
[1:00:02] god's way
[1:00:03] god's word is very true god's word is
[1:00:06] very clear
[1:00:07] god word is very deterministic of what
[1:00:09] he wants to achieve
[1:00:11] so the prophet says here and he speaks
[1:00:14] following the scripture we just read it
[1:00:15] says
[1:00:16] now he says god god knowed the
[1:00:19] end from the beginning therefore he
[1:00:22] could plan
[1:00:22] everything that he would that he would
[1:00:25] that it would work out exactly
[1:00:27] to his glory and to give ss and that
[1:00:30] gives us
[1:00:31] courage to know that no matter what
[1:00:34] comes and what goes
[1:00:36] god is making everything the clock is
[1:00:39] ticking just exactly on time
[1:00:44] it's giving us an assurance to know it
[1:00:47] says
[1:00:48] and i like this even as the scripture we
[1:00:50] read and isaiah says you we remain
[1:00:52] he's talking to riri men just to let you
[1:00:54] know god
[1:00:55] has this under control god knows the
[1:00:58] time
[1:00:58] god knows the season god knows exactly
[1:01:02] what's happening
[1:01:03] god has this under control in other and
[1:01:06] our peace will come
[1:01:07] only when we take our trust and put it
[1:01:09] in him
[1:01:10] and know that he has everything under
[1:01:12] control that's when we'll have peace
[1:01:15] if we're still trying to figure it out
[1:01:16] ourselves we won't have peace
[1:01:18] if we chill fly to find our answers
[1:01:20] ourselves we won't have peace
[1:01:22] but if we bring it to him and know that
[1:01:25] he knows the season
[1:01:26] he knows the time he knows the word when
[1:01:29] we know that he knows all those things
[1:01:31] it brings peace within ourselves
[1:01:35] so he continues on and he says it says
[1:01:38] sometimes
[1:01:39] we get weary we say upset
[1:01:43] we get hasty we think oh
[1:01:46] we we must do this and we must do that
[1:01:49] but remember
[1:01:50] god's clock will just be well god clock
[1:01:54] will
[1:01:54] will be just exactly on time all
[1:01:57] things all these things has to be
[1:02:01] this way has has to be done according to
[1:02:04] his great knowledge
[1:02:06] his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge
[1:02:09] he could predestinate
[1:02:10] not by desire but by foreknowledge
[1:02:13] and i thought that was such a a a right
[1:02:17] way to put it
[1:02:18] god's the scripture says god's desire is
[1:02:21] for all to be saved
[1:02:24] it's for the whole world to be saved but
[1:02:27] by his foreknowledge he knows
[1:02:29] who will be saved and who won't be saved
[1:02:32] so he doesn't predestinate by desire he
[1:02:34] predestinate by four knowledge
[1:02:36] and with knowledge he can make the
[1:02:38] proper determination
[1:02:40] he can come back and say because what he
[1:02:43] says we know that god doesn't learn
[1:02:44] anything
[1:02:45] he can't say one thing and then come and
[1:02:47] change it he can come in
[1:02:49] and and say something and say well i've
[1:02:51] learned better now i'm changing it
[1:02:53] what he says is what's going to come to
[1:02:55] pass why because he's an
[1:02:57] all-knowing god he's the creator of
[1:03:00] heaven and earth
[1:03:01] he knows something before it can happen
[1:03:03] he knows what's going to happen the next
[1:03:05] second he knows what's going to happen
[1:03:07] the next minute
[1:03:08] he knows where you're going to be the
[1:03:09] next minute he knows where you're going
[1:03:11] to be tomorrow he knows
[1:03:12] all things about you therefore with that
[1:03:14] knowledge it affords him the ability
[1:03:17] for him to come and plan and
[1:03:20] predestinate according to his knowledge
[1:03:23] it says god doesn't predestinate by
[1:03:25] desire he is not he says he's not
[1:03:27] willing that any should perish but
[1:03:31] by foreknowledge he knoweth who could
[1:03:34] accept it
[1:03:35] and who could not who would not
[1:03:37] therefore he cannot make
[1:03:39] anything work according to how big
[1:03:42] the time clock is sticking away he could
[1:03:45] he could he says for he could foretell
[1:03:48] the end from the beginning and therefore
[1:03:51] he know
[1:03:52] he knew that he would that he would live
[1:03:55] in this that you would live in this day
[1:03:57] he knew
[1:03:58] that this will be our day and he planned
[1:04:02] for this day he has had the plan for
[1:04:06] every day and and for every day
[1:04:09] and never has one of his plan ever
[1:04:13] failed
[1:04:13] he's always on time
[1:04:17] now that that why is that important
[1:04:20] because
[1:04:21] unless we know what time we are living
[1:04:23] in unless we know
[1:04:25] what is expected of us unless we know
[1:04:28] what is it that god is trying to achieve
[1:04:31] without the understanding of
[1:04:32] all of this we're going by our own
[1:04:34] interpretation
[1:04:35] by our own mind we're doing things based
[1:04:38] on our own understanding
[1:04:39] but we understand that god has never
[1:04:42] made a man to walk for himself
[1:04:44] or to try to figure out his own way it's
[1:04:46] always been
[1:04:47] in the program of god for god to provide
[1:04:50] for man
[1:04:51] every step of the way in fact god made
[1:04:54] man so man can depend on him god make
[1:04:57] man so we can come and depend on our
[1:04:59] heavenly father
[1:05:01] and use of his attributes and use of
[1:05:04] himself use of the things that he has
[1:05:07] his healing and
[1:05:08] his power his deliverance and all the
[1:05:10] attribute that he has
[1:05:12] that we may partake of it but guess what
[1:05:15] men did
[1:05:16] invented hospitals men invented a
[1:05:19] better health care or a better way for
[1:05:22] him to do this
[1:05:23] all of that trying to separate
[1:05:25] themselves from what god's economy was
[1:05:29] and therefore by knowing the time and
[1:05:31] the season that we are living in
[1:05:33] it becomes very important because what
[1:05:36] we do
[1:05:36] whatever random says this it says the
[1:05:38] the preparation the things the action
[1:05:41] and the choices we're making today
[1:05:43] is determining where our eternal
[1:05:45] destination is going to be
[1:05:47] so therefore by knowing what is expected
[1:05:50] of you
[1:05:51] by knowing what the word is for today
[1:05:53] therefore we are walking
[1:05:55] into the exp the expectation of god for
[1:05:58] our final destination
[1:06:00] if we know we're going in the rapture we
[1:06:02] prepare today
[1:06:03] we don't prepare tomorrow if we know the
[1:06:06] rapture is coming the preparation
[1:06:08] is done today for us to be there that's
[1:06:11] why when you know the season
[1:06:13] it helps you to prepare better when you
[1:06:16] know the time
[1:06:17] it helps you to have understanding of of
[1:06:20] how to
[1:06:21] to uh to taking uh uh to understand
[1:06:24] the situation that's happening outside
[1:06:26] that's why i would say that
[1:06:28] this morning that the bride of christ or
[1:06:30] the believers in this end time
[1:06:32] is not rattled by what's happening
[1:06:34] outside
[1:06:36] it's not moved by what governments are
[1:06:38] doing
[1:06:40] the church can gather up all they want
[1:06:42] the world can come together and sing
[1:06:44] songs all they want that doesn't move
[1:06:46] the bride at all
[1:06:48] why because she's not part of the
[1:06:49] economy of the world
[1:06:51] she's part of the economy of god
[1:06:54] and as far as she's concerned she is set
[1:06:57] and she knows what a final destination
[1:06:59] is
[1:07:00] it's those that are caught in the fence
[1:07:02] that have a problem
[1:07:04] oh you know i'm not really sure if this
[1:07:06] message is true
[1:07:08] therefore you know i'm gonna be one foot
[1:07:09] in and one foot out
[1:07:11] just in case those are the ones that are
[1:07:13] going to perish
[1:07:14] those are the ones that are not going to
[1:07:16] make it why because you undecided you
[1:07:18] can't be caught between two opinions
[1:07:21] you can't go to the left and try to go
[1:07:23] to the right you have to make up your
[1:07:25] mind
[1:07:25] and sold out and desire to go in a
[1:07:28] direction
[1:07:31] you can never be successful in trying to
[1:07:33] go in two direction at the same time
[1:07:36] the bride is such a place where
[1:07:39] in fact the more the scripture is
[1:07:42] fulfilled
[1:07:43] the more she can see the condition the
[1:07:45] more she can see those things
[1:07:47] happening her heart is rejoicing why
[1:07:50] because
[1:07:50] all of those things are only a time
[1:07:53] piece
[1:07:54] all of those things are only determining
[1:07:56] how close she is to living this place
[1:08:03] now that that's why it becomes why is
[1:08:06] that important again
[1:08:07] because if we find ourselves being
[1:08:09] rattled
[1:08:10] being moved or being shaken by what's
[1:08:13] happening out there
[1:08:14] something is wrong with the state that
[1:08:16] we are in
[1:08:18] something is wrong with the relationship
[1:08:20] that we are in
[1:08:21] something is wrong with what we are
[1:08:23] doing because
[1:08:24] god has given us this perfect word god
[1:08:28] is giving us the revelation in the end
[1:08:30] time
[1:08:30] and those things are here for god to
[1:08:33] build this perfect church
[1:08:35] and i want to say this you know the the
[1:08:38] brother john who was here he he preached
[1:08:40] about the perfection
[1:08:42] i'll say this perfection comes by the
[1:08:45] receiving of a perfect word
[1:08:48] perfection but random says god will only
[1:08:51] take what's perfect and the only way we
[1:08:54] can be perfect
[1:08:55] is by god himself making you perfect
[1:08:58] and he's provided his word to make you
[1:09:01] perfect how
[1:09:02] he in the end time we've received a
[1:09:05] revelation even of
[1:09:06] of justification like we never heard it
[1:09:09] before
[1:09:10] the prophet comes and he says when god
[1:09:12] takes you in by his word
[1:09:14] when he's cleaned you by the blood of
[1:09:16] the lamb when he's done all those things
[1:09:18] you are more perfect even at a baby
[1:09:22] you are more perfect and it's even as
[1:09:24] you've never done it before
[1:09:26] as far as god is concerned it's not in
[1:09:28] the book
[1:09:32] who makes that who can make that claim
[1:09:35] who can take the very sin
[1:09:37] and dissolves it and bring it back to
[1:09:39] the very component
[1:09:40] like a bleach to exactly what it was and
[1:09:43] when you look at it it doesn't look
[1:09:45] like it has any trace of sin within it
[1:09:48] only god can do that
[1:09:52] what a privileged people we are and he
[1:09:55] says
[1:09:56] and why is that because we in the age
[1:09:59] that we are living
[1:09:59] in that could never been done in the age
[1:10:02] before but random says i'm so glad to
[1:10:04] live in this same time
[1:10:06] why because the fullness of god
[1:10:08] everything that we know about god to be
[1:10:11] everything that we've read about
[1:10:14] everything that we
[1:10:15] heard that he done in the past god has
[1:10:17] condensed himself
[1:10:18] he's taking all that he's done in the
[1:10:20] past all that he promised he will do
[1:10:23] he's combining it and giving it to this
[1:10:28] generation
[1:10:35] so so
[1:10:42] so yeah we are he he speaks of the time
[1:10:46] and so in this message the super sign
[1:10:49] but when i'm
[1:10:49] hits on the element some elements i
[1:10:51] would like just to bring across
[1:10:54] uh really quickly just so we can move
[1:10:56] forward
[1:10:57] he he speaks he says you know we live in
[1:11:00] a
[1:11:01] in the super age he calls it and
[1:11:04] and i was thinking this message was
[1:11:06] preaching 63
[1:11:07] and i want you to just understand what
[1:11:09] that means today
[1:11:11] you know you you we live in the super
[1:11:13] age it says you know
[1:11:14] the supermarket and supercars
[1:11:17] you know super everything you know we we
[1:11:20] climb
[1:11:21] we say in texas everything is big in
[1:11:23] texas oh my
[1:11:24] i mean it's just there's nothing if you
[1:11:27] do
[1:11:28] something that's just average is no
[1:11:30] longer attractive
[1:11:31] to just have an average it's no longer
[1:11:33] attractive it's got to be the super
[1:11:35] it's got to be the best of the best and
[1:11:37] you know
[1:11:38] i remember growing up as a store
[1:11:42] or a food store it just used to be a
[1:11:44] closet
[1:11:45] you know just a closet where you will go
[1:11:47] and get a couple of things and
[1:11:48] everything
[1:11:49] now my goodness you need a you you need
[1:11:52] a little uh
[1:11:53] like a moplete or something for you to
[1:11:55] sit and go to walmart i mean
[1:11:57] you you can't just to cross from one
[1:11:59] side to the other
[1:12:00] you'll be tired by the time you get to
[1:12:02] the other side there's everything you're
[1:12:04] looking for
[1:12:05] why it's the super age a car cannot be
[1:12:08] just an average car you can't just make
[1:12:11] a car that goes 60 miles an hour no
[1:12:13] it's got to be 120 miles in two seconds
[1:12:17] otherwise nobody won't buy it
[1:12:22] i i mean that's the time we're living in
[1:12:24] that's a reality we're living in
[1:12:26] you know nobody wants just something
[1:12:28] average everybody just wants super
[1:12:30] you know they used to be stars now
[1:12:32] people want superstars
[1:12:34] you know all you know they stars but
[1:12:36] then they're superstars
[1:12:37] so these are about the stars even
[1:12:39] themselves they're super
[1:12:41] and everything and that's the world
[1:12:43] we're living in and now remember what
[1:12:45] venom says that the natural is only a
[1:12:47] type of the spiritual
[1:12:49] what we see in the natural it helps a
[1:12:52] believer
[1:12:53] to process what is it that's happening
[1:12:55] in god's economy
[1:12:57] what we see happening with the people in
[1:13:00] the natural
[1:13:01] a spiritual man looks in the spiritual
[1:13:03] world and wonder
[1:13:05] what is it that god hasn't for me
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:09] because if we get caught up in the
[1:13:11] natural and then we stay natural
[1:13:13] then we fail to reap the benefits of the
[1:13:15] spiritual
[1:13:16] but if we see the natural as only a type
[1:13:19] of the spiritual
[1:13:20] we can understand where we are at
[1:13:24] you know the world is uniting so is god
[1:13:28] you know the church is coming together
[1:13:30] so is the bride
[1:13:32] all of those things are only showing how
[1:13:34] close we are getting
[1:13:36] and i want to say this we shouldn't be
[1:13:38] caught up in the natural
[1:13:39] so much that will miss the picture for
[1:13:41] the spiritual
[1:13:42] but let's educate ourselves from the
[1:13:45] natural let's glean
[1:13:46] what needs to be learned from the
[1:13:48] natural and focus ourselves back into
[1:13:51] the spiritual
[1:13:52] and find what is god trying to tell me
[1:13:54] what is god trying to show me
[1:13:56] where is he trying to take me what is it
[1:13:59] that he wants to achieve in my life
[1:14:01] i'll say this god is no longer uh just
[1:14:04] happy with average also
[1:14:07] no god is not i'm happy with an average
[1:14:09] question
[1:14:10] it says oh yeah you know just go to
[1:14:12] church and go home
[1:14:14] just go to church and go home i'll do
[1:14:16] the best i can
[1:14:17] no this is not the time for that
[1:14:20] this is the time where the fullness of
[1:14:22] god
[1:14:23] is being dropped into a people where we
[1:14:26] expect to see a
[1:14:28] person and when we see the person we see
[1:14:31] jesus
[1:14:32] manifested in a human
[1:14:35] and that takes above average to get to
[1:14:37] that
[1:14:38] that takes super to get to that
[1:14:43] but one of them says you know this
[1:14:46] is the super day everything is super
[1:14:50] it says uh the frock lightning in the
[1:14:53] skies and the cloud nights
[1:14:55] it says the the certainly declares to us
[1:14:58] that there will be lightning and uh in
[1:15:00] the darkness
[1:15:01] we are aware of it it says and
[1:15:04] and and and this is what uh what was
[1:15:08] called
[1:15:08] super age everything you see now
[1:15:11] now the days must be super it won't go
[1:15:14] oh
[1:15:14] it won't go over if you if you haven't
[1:15:17] got some
[1:15:18] if you have if you haven't got something
[1:15:20] super because
[1:15:21] it's a super age you have the you they
[1:15:23] have their age
[1:15:24] a hat if they have to now
[1:15:27] they've got to super age everything you
[1:15:29] see you can't go down the corner store
[1:15:32] or anymore and find a block of cheese
[1:15:34] laying
[1:15:35] like there it says and like it used to
[1:15:38] be
[1:15:38] the old corner story says if you go if
[1:15:41] you ever go to the food
[1:15:43] if you ever go to the food ever go do
[1:15:46] everything wants to be
[1:15:47] classic air conditioned market
[1:15:50] come to the supermarket you must go and
[1:15:53] have time to
[1:15:55] and and even they they they pay more
[1:15:58] for their food they've got to go to a
[1:16:01] supermarket that's right because it's
[1:16:02] super
[1:16:04] i mean he makes some interesting comment
[1:16:07] and i probably won't have time to go
[1:16:08] through it
[1:16:10] and i thought he says
[1:16:14] it used to be that the kids walked to
[1:16:16] school
[1:16:18] and now they all nobody walks to school
[1:16:22] everybody takes a bus or gets driven by
[1:16:24] a car
[1:16:26] and now in order to add to what's
[1:16:29] missing because you realize that if you
[1:16:30] don't walk you're gonna die
[1:16:32] they spend millions of dollars to build
[1:16:35] a playground
[1:16:36] for them to play in so they because if
[1:16:39] you lack exercise
[1:16:41] you're going to die so in order to
[1:16:43] provide for exercise
[1:16:45] you know it's like you know we i talk
[1:16:47] with my mic we joke all the time
[1:16:49] you go to walmart you find the closest
[1:16:51] parking to the door
[1:16:53] i mean you if they were permitting
[1:16:54] people to park at the door you will be
[1:16:56] there
[1:16:57] because you don't want to walk to your
[1:16:59] car you want the closest place possible
[1:17:02] but yet your body needs exercise and
[1:17:04] then you go you buy a treadmill
[1:17:06] and then you oh the same
[1:17:10] exercise you could have gotten to walk
[1:17:12] into your car
[1:17:14] you see how men's thinking is we think
[1:17:17] otherwise we think differently we we we
[1:17:20] get caught up into the world and
[1:17:22] we get caught up into all these things
[1:17:24] and he speaks about so many things
[1:17:26] if we're not paying careful attention
[1:17:29] will be drawn to everything that people
[1:17:31] are doing
[1:17:31] oh this is the new thing oh yeah there
[1:17:33] we go we're gonna go do it oh
[1:17:35] that's what we do now okay we're gonna
[1:17:36] go do this you know we want
[1:17:38] we want we want our houses i tell you
[1:17:41] when when we lost
[1:17:42] power it only took a couple of degrees
[1:17:45] down
[1:17:46] for everybody to start sweating for
[1:17:49] everything to start dropping
[1:17:50] i don't think i could take this i we
[1:17:54] do we need to go to the hotel or who do
[1:17:56] we who got power that we need to go to
[1:17:58] the place and
[1:18:00] we our natural body itself is telling us
[1:18:04] that we are hybrid we cannot take more
[1:18:07] heat
[1:18:08] we cannot take when it's too cold we we
[1:18:10] need a lukewarmness we gotta stay look
[1:18:12] one
[1:18:13] if you press it to one side it goes bad
[1:18:16] if you do to the other side
[1:18:17] that's what the natural tells us oh but
[1:18:19] i tell you in the spiritual the same
[1:18:21] thing
[1:18:22] god is looking to make you a hot
[1:18:24] believer
[1:18:28] god is one to put some fire out of you
[1:18:31] to cause you to do something
[1:18:32] to cause you to become something not to
[1:18:35] stay lukewarm
[1:18:36] not to just come to a place where you
[1:18:38] know it's it's
[1:18:39] usually it's when things are taken to an
[1:18:41] extreme that's when you know what it's
[1:18:43] made out of
[1:18:45] but guess what we don't we don't want to
[1:18:46] be tempted
[1:18:48] you know when god brings it you know god
[1:18:50] i can only take it up to here
[1:18:52] you know we set our own limits and when
[1:18:54] he wants to go get our break i'll break
[1:18:55] our break
[1:18:56] you know we want to set the limits on
[1:18:58] what god can do for us
[1:19:00] and you know no he's the master
[1:19:03] he's the creator of you he knows how
[1:19:06] much you can take
[1:19:07] why don't you just take your life put it
[1:19:10] in his hands
[1:19:12] whatever happens master i trust you
[1:19:15] i know you know me better than i know
[1:19:17] myself i know you have a better plan
[1:19:19] than i do
[1:19:20] i know you know the destination that
[1:19:22] you're taking i know exactly
[1:19:24] i know you know what you want out of
[1:19:26] this flesh what do you want out of this
[1:19:29] body
[1:19:29] i don't understand but i trust you
[1:19:33] why is that important that's the seed of
[1:19:36] abraham
[1:19:38] that's the royal seed of abraham
[1:19:40] anything
[1:19:41] outside of perfect surrender is not the
[1:19:44] seed of abraham
[1:19:46] the fleet of abraham is if death is what
[1:19:49] it takes
[1:19:50] i'll take death if you need me to kill
[1:19:52] my son i'll kill him
[1:19:54] why because he trusted god so much the
[1:19:57] scripture says that he knew
[1:19:58] that he had received the son from the
[1:20:00] dead that if god was to take that son
[1:20:03] and kill him
[1:20:04] the same god who provided that same
[1:20:06] sound was able to raise him up again
[1:20:08] from the dead
[1:20:10] that's the gospel of jesus christ
[1:20:20] so he says he says
[1:20:24] i think of every woman is getting super
[1:20:26] dressed model
[1:20:28] and the age and he says the
[1:20:29] old-fashioned shoes
[1:20:31] they had to add some letter in it you
[1:20:34] buy them
[1:20:35] three dollars a pair it says
[1:20:39] the very kind the very best kind had the
[1:20:42] letter
[1:20:42] it had the letter letter in them
[1:20:47] than dozen of the pairs you get today
[1:20:50] so it takes about 10 shoes to get the
[1:20:52] same size
[1:20:54] and quality letter that you used to get
[1:20:55] before
[1:20:57] and i was just thinking you know
[1:21:00] and especially the young people you may
[1:21:02] have known this
[1:21:03] you know the couple of weeks a couple of
[1:21:06] months ago
[1:21:07] they came up with this shoe they call it
[1:21:09] the devil's shoe or
[1:21:11] satan's shoe and and it was only
[1:21:15] it was a nike it was only they claimed
[1:21:17] it had the real blood in it like a
[1:21:19] real human blood or something like that
[1:21:22] and they only make
[1:21:23] a couple of thousand pairs and it was
[1:21:26] sold out
[1:21:28] sold out you couldn't find it i mean a
[1:21:30] pair went by a thousand dollars
[1:21:34] super age i mean you you wonder
[1:21:39] i did the knowledge of what they're
[1:21:41] getting into
[1:21:42] because they call it the satan's shoe
[1:21:44] everybody wanted it
[1:21:47] they have what they call the yeezy shoes
[1:21:50] they're over a thousand bucks
[1:21:52] it comes out it's always out of stock
[1:21:54] you wonder
[1:21:55] who is buying them and if you look at
[1:21:58] them
[1:21:59] they're not attractive
[1:22:03] i'm ju i'm speaking here because it's
[1:22:06] very important we realize
[1:22:07] what's happening around us because it's
[1:22:10] the it's the age we have to know
[1:22:12] because we have to know because this is
[1:22:14] very determining
[1:22:16] of what's happening spiritually it's
[1:22:18] gone
[1:22:19] people are just anything that comes out
[1:22:21] it's gone
[1:22:22] and people are just whatever this one
[1:22:25] does the other one wants to do
[1:22:27] and everything and i want to say this to
[1:22:28] even our young people sitting here
[1:22:31] people want to come to the place today
[1:22:34] men's desire is always to mix the word
[1:22:36] of god
[1:22:38] man's desire is how can i go to church
[1:22:41] on sunday
[1:22:42] and still go to club on saturday they
[1:22:45] want a religion
[1:22:46] that would afford them the ability to be
[1:22:49] both in heaven
[1:22:50] and on in hell or on earth the same time
[1:22:54] they never want anything that will
[1:22:55] commit them to anything
[1:22:58] that's the nature of man people want to
[1:23:00] be i want to be a youtube star
[1:23:02] i want to follow them but yet i want to
[1:23:04] be a christian
[1:23:06] that's not the ground to play with i
[1:23:08] want to be an instagram star but i want
[1:23:10] to be a christian
[1:23:12] i want to be this but i want to be this
[1:23:15] you cannot mix the two
[1:23:17] we are not called to play within those
[1:23:20] groud
[1:23:21] that's not the ground that we play in
[1:23:23] our ground is the spiritual reveal word
[1:23:26] of the
[1:23:26] hour and we only have one motive and one
[1:23:30] destination
[1:23:31] and that's out of this world
[1:23:35] i like what brother mike said you know
[1:23:37] it wasn't even
[1:23:38] thinking about it but as he began to say
[1:23:41] just get caught up in the corporate
[1:23:43] world and see how much of your time
[1:23:46] i i have people i work for they
[1:23:49] they take the clothes to the dry cleaner
[1:23:51] they bring them food to eat
[1:23:53] they go do the old change for the car
[1:23:55] you think that's that's awesome
[1:23:57] well i wish they could do that for me
[1:23:59] that person is on the phone 24
[1:24:01] 7. they can't do anything
[1:24:05] they are stuck there phone call meeting
[1:24:08] after meeting after meeting why
[1:24:10] the commitment of what they signed up
[1:24:12] for and that's what the devil wants to
[1:24:14] do
[1:24:14] just suck you back in suck you back in
[1:24:17] and i want to say
[1:24:18] that kind of lifestyle will not take you
[1:24:20] to this destination that we're talking
[1:24:21] about
[1:24:23] that kind of lifestyle will not get you
[1:24:25] in heaven the lifestyle that will get
[1:24:27] you in heaven is one who's committed to
[1:24:29] the word of god
[1:24:30] you do what you need to do for work but
[1:24:33] your focus is in the things of god
[1:24:35] i'm eating of the word i'm eating of the
[1:24:38] word
[1:24:38] because remember what i'm adam says that
[1:24:40] you become the word as you eat the word
[1:24:44] remember we bypass the theophany and the
[1:24:47] way we're going back to the word
[1:24:49] is by eating the word
[1:24:58] and he says and all these signs
[1:25:03] and all this marks the spiritual
[1:25:05] darkness
[1:25:06] all these things we see happen in
[1:25:10] these super super super he says if we
[1:25:13] only know
[1:25:15] it says we are in a hurry we've got to
[1:25:17] get
[1:25:18] to get there he says when we get
[1:25:23] and and what we do when we get there
[1:25:27] he used to take and walk home
[1:25:30] from work he used to it which i just
[1:25:34] talked about it about the kids taking
[1:25:35] the bus
[1:25:37] he continues on and he says
[1:25:40] he says
[1:25:46] and you know his people and you know
[1:25:50] his people god's people of the bride
[1:25:54] has always been warned of god
[1:25:57] to watch for the signs of the time
[1:26:02] he says jesus when he was on earth he
[1:26:04] said
[1:26:05] to the pharisees he says in his day he
[1:26:07] says you blind pharisees and says
[1:26:11] you go out in the evening and you go and
[1:26:13] you look in the skies and the clears
[1:26:15] clear and the red and you says tomorrow
[1:26:19] you said it will be clear day and it
[1:26:20] says then you go out
[1:26:23] they are lowering and hang and angry
[1:26:25] looking and then tomorrow
[1:26:27] will be foul weather he says he says
[1:26:30] you can discern the face of the skies
[1:26:34] but the signs of the time you can
[1:26:36] discern
[1:26:38] if you would only know me he says
[1:26:42] you would have known my day and if you
[1:26:45] knowed moses
[1:26:46] he says you would have known me because
[1:26:49] moses
[1:26:50] wrote of me
[1:26:56] and this this is where
[1:26:59] the word becomes a personal
[1:27:04] a personal calling we
[1:27:07] we it seems like we see the same things
[1:27:12] but people process it differently
[1:27:16] it seems like we we see this trigger
[1:27:18] event
[1:27:19] but the question we have to ask
[1:27:21] ourselves what is it triggered
[1:27:23] in my heart when i see it when i see it
[1:27:26] what is it in my heart
[1:27:27] you know a pastor made a comment the
[1:27:29] other day
[1:27:30] it's so amazing when you see all of this
[1:27:33] fulfillment you would think the church
[1:27:35] will be filled up
[1:27:37] with people just coming and on their
[1:27:40] knees and say oh god your word is coming
[1:27:42] to pass
[1:27:43] oh god your word is coming to pass but
[1:27:45] yet the opposite is happening
[1:27:47] yet people are still in the same
[1:27:49] conditions that we're in
[1:27:51] now i'll say this you don't blame the
[1:27:54] people
[1:27:55] and i want to even go as far as saying
[1:27:58] to
[1:27:58] to to us that god has given us the
[1:28:01] ability to see
[1:28:03] it becomes very important that we live
[1:28:05] the kind of lifestyle
[1:28:07] that proves what we have received
[1:28:10] because oftentimes
[1:28:11] you know you you hear a lot of people
[1:28:14] because we
[1:28:14] receive a revelation because god has
[1:28:16] opened your eyes to see
[1:28:18] it it doesn't you don't get an exemption
[1:28:21] to the fruits of the spirit
[1:28:26] because the scripture tells us that to
[1:28:28] him much is given much is required
[1:28:31] so to us that have received this word
[1:28:33] the more
[1:28:34] we have to live a life that's showing
[1:28:36] the things that we have received
[1:28:38] to to when when people have because
[1:28:40] people have to have
[1:28:41] questions how come you see this and this
[1:28:43] is the kind of life you live in
[1:28:44] you have to come to the place where your
[1:28:46] life is your testimony
[1:28:48] your life speaks louder than your words
[1:28:51] your life speaks louder than anything
[1:28:53] you can say
[1:28:55] when we get to that place that's when we
[1:28:57] have the real message to the people
[1:29:00] that's when we are really speaking a
[1:29:02] gospel to the world that's why we really
[1:29:04] become
[1:29:05] salty that's when we really become
[1:29:07] effective because
[1:29:08] what i it's not what i say it's where i
[1:29:10] live
[1:29:13] we can't blame them because none of us
[1:29:15] can open somebody's eyes
[1:29:16] no one came to you and beat the head at
[1:29:19] your head and say look look look look
[1:29:21] until you saw it no
[1:29:22] if you saw it it's because the heavenly
[1:29:25] father
[1:29:26] the your father the creator of heaven
[1:29:28] and earth gave you the ability for you
[1:29:31] to see
[1:29:32] and i want to say this if he gave you
[1:29:34] the ability to see
[1:29:35] walk in the revelation that he has given
[1:29:37] you
[1:29:38] don't walk in somebody else's revelation
[1:29:41] don't do it until you see it too
[1:29:44] because if you open your eyes to this he
[1:29:46] will be able to open your eyes to the
[1:29:47] other thing
[1:29:49] oftentimes we get in conflict with one
[1:29:51] another you don't see this
[1:29:52] how come you really don't see this well
[1:29:54] the only reason why you see it
[1:29:56] is because god allowed you to see it
[1:30:01] why don't you pray for me for the same
[1:30:03] god who showed you
[1:30:04] to help me see it also
[1:30:08] i think that's when will become more
[1:30:09] effective now remember i'm speaking
[1:30:11] about the super church
[1:30:13] what is the super church but one of them
[1:30:15] says when god
[1:30:16] comes down and descends into a man and
[1:30:20] become a man
[1:30:21] that becomes a superman
[1:30:23] [Applause]
[1:30:25] not one man has educated himself not
[1:30:28] when you've come up and said you've
[1:30:29] heard of
[1:30:30] no when god the creator of heaven and
[1:30:32] earth
[1:30:33] when his holy spirit descends upon you
[1:30:36] and take hold of you
[1:30:37] you become a superman
[1:30:48] it says and now
[1:30:52] we just find out about
[1:30:56] and now we find out just about the same
[1:30:59] thing exists today
[1:31:01] it says when we know we are living in
[1:31:05] the
[1:31:05] hour of gross darkness it's covering the
[1:31:08] earth
[1:31:09] and the people and we find out that all
[1:31:11] these things the modern achievement
[1:31:14] the super rage and so forth we are
[1:31:16] living in is
[1:31:17] only a sign of gross darkness in
[1:31:20] spiritual
[1:31:21] realms we are in laodicean church age
[1:31:25] where we are just lukewarm they could go
[1:31:28] to church the people could go
[1:31:30] people does and seem to have a zeal to
[1:31:33] go to church
[1:31:34] but but but to know anything about the
[1:31:38] spiritual
[1:31:39] the time that they are living in some of
[1:31:42] them
[1:31:42] are as blind as could be
[1:31:46] about those things no matter what god
[1:31:49] would do
[1:31:50] and how well it will do to prove by his
[1:31:53] word
[1:31:54] still they just can't see it says
[1:31:58] and i wonder if it is just about like
[1:32:01] what it is what he said they have eyes
[1:32:04] but they can't see
[1:32:06] and he says we are to look around and
[1:32:09] see
[1:32:09] all these things what's happening are
[1:32:12] signs
[1:32:13] at the end in the end because these
[1:32:16] are the things that was predicted to be
[1:32:20] at that time and then he says
[1:32:24] and then he says he sign
[1:32:27] he signs always for run his event
[1:32:31] his sons he the signs that he sends
[1:32:34] will always run before the event just
[1:32:38] as that just as it does it says
[1:32:41] what you see when you see the geese go
[1:32:44] and
[1:32:45] the the the the bugs come out and you
[1:32:47] see
[1:32:48] leaves falling and and and count and and
[1:32:51] continued nature
[1:32:53] uh branding god's law
[1:32:56] of nature blames in and then he says
[1:32:59] he for runs his event he's always been
[1:33:02] it's never failed and he will never fail
[1:33:06] and listen to this it says and if we
[1:33:08] just follow to continue
[1:33:11] if we just follow the contin continuity
[1:33:14] of god's word
[1:33:15] we will never fail
[1:33:19] you so our success is in following in
[1:33:22] the continuity of god's word
[1:33:25] he talks about the season he says when
[1:33:27] we see the tree
[1:33:28] buds and everything we know that's that
[1:33:31] it's springtime
[1:33:32] and we know summer is next when you see
[1:33:34] the leaves falling and all those things
[1:33:36] you know winter is next
[1:33:38] so every season that comes you can look
[1:33:40] at the time and be able to predict
[1:33:42] what's coming on next
[1:33:44] so there has to be a time we can look
[1:33:46] around and see what's happening
[1:33:48] and know what's happening next this
[1:33:50] world is up to no good
[1:33:52] this world is coming to an end you you
[1:33:54] you can look at everything that's
[1:33:56] running around
[1:33:56] and see that this cannot continue on the
[1:33:59] way it's going
[1:34:03] it cannot sustain itself it's going to
[1:34:06] come down to a collapse
[1:34:07] but it's in that time that we have to
[1:34:10] come to a place and realize that
[1:34:11] what is god doing for me what is it
[1:34:14] that's happening within me
[1:34:15] what is god wanting to achieve i want to
[1:34:17] say this god
[1:34:19] is not looking for slaves
[1:34:22] that's not what the scripture says in
[1:34:25] fact the scripture says
[1:34:26] that in the end time that nature itself
[1:34:29] is groaning for the manifestations of
[1:34:31] sons and
[1:34:32] daughters now remember the same
[1:34:33] scripture also says
[1:34:35] a son when he's young is not different
[1:34:38] from a slave
[1:34:39] and what's the difference between a
[1:34:41] slave and a son a slave
[1:34:43] only following a slave only follow
[1:34:45] instructions
[1:34:46] oh that's what we're going to do the
[1:34:47] master wants us to do this this is what
[1:34:50] but we find out that god has taken us
[1:34:53] and as sons as we grow
[1:34:55] is brought us into a new relationship
[1:34:58] where we can come to the father and in
[1:35:00] this end time the father has revealed to
[1:35:03] us
[1:35:03] the motive and objective of everything
[1:35:06] that he's been doing
[1:35:07] christ the mystery of god revealed what
[1:35:10] did i have in my mind in the beginning
[1:35:12] what is it that i'm trying to achieve
[1:35:14] today what is it that i'm trying to do
[1:35:16] today
[1:35:16] and in bringing you in that relationship
[1:35:19] is bringing you to a place where you
[1:35:20] become coequal with him
[1:35:23] where you become a son where you know
[1:35:25] why you're doing what you're doing
[1:35:27] where you know what you're supposed to
[1:35:29] do where you know that you're supposed
[1:35:30] to be led by
[1:35:31] spirit to do the works that he wants you
[1:35:34] to do
[1:35:36] that's why he says in the church book it
[1:35:38] says the harmony that exists between the
[1:35:41] father and the son
[1:35:42] it says that same harmony has to exist
[1:35:46] between
[1:35:47] christ and this bride or god in this
[1:35:50] church
[1:35:51] why because she says nothing except what
[1:35:55] he tells it to say
[1:35:57] she knows the mind of she has the mind
[1:35:59] of god
[1:36:00] those are the description of the age
[1:36:03] that we are living in
[1:36:04] in the spiritual we know the things that
[1:36:08] god wants to do
[1:36:11] let me just say this the things that god
[1:36:15] is trying to achieve
[1:36:17] are not completed yet
[1:36:23] are we together here the things that god
[1:36:26] is trying to achieve
[1:36:27] are not completed yet it takes you
[1:36:31] and i to get into the program to bring
[1:36:34] them to a finish line
[1:36:36] god is looking for people that he's
[1:36:38] created for this age
[1:36:40] so when we say the super church is the
[1:36:43] church
[1:36:43] that god himself is dwelling that he
[1:36:46] himself can work up his plan
[1:36:48] inside of them
[1:36:52] now how can he work up his plan inside
[1:36:55] of us when
[1:36:56] all we caught up is god i didn't have
[1:36:58] money for bills today
[1:37:00] god i don't have this today i'm sick
[1:37:03] today
[1:37:04] and everything about what you're talking
[1:37:06] about god
[1:37:08] has to do with the natural and the
[1:37:10] things that you desire
[1:37:14] so is it that god's plan was
[1:37:18] that it would only supply in the
[1:37:19] spiritual so that
[1:37:21] you work for him in the spiritual but in
[1:37:23] the natural you go back to the other
[1:37:25] side and you try to do it for yourself
[1:37:27] so god's plan was not completed when he
[1:37:30] calls he calls barbara
[1:37:32] says when god makes you a christian he
[1:37:34] makes you a full
[1:37:35] christian when god calls you to be a
[1:37:37] preacher he makes you a fool
[1:37:39] in other words he supplies both natural
[1:37:41] and spiritual
[1:37:43] whatever need you have you go to him but
[1:37:45] your desire has to be that father
[1:37:48] i want to find myself doing your work
[1:37:51] and
[1:37:51] how do you use me to do your work and
[1:37:54] wherever i find myself i'll do your work
[1:37:59] if our focus is divided then we can't
[1:38:02] have the perfect result
[1:38:03] if our focus is broken up then we have
[1:38:06] to find
[1:38:07] for this and find for that but when our
[1:38:10] focus is single to him
[1:38:12] he knows how to take care of the rest
[1:38:22] it says oh god
[1:38:26] if only the world
[1:38:29] if only the world could only see that
[1:38:32] see what that god and men
[1:38:36] are one that
[1:38:39] now remember the super church is exactly
[1:38:42] this
[1:38:43] god and man are one the super sign
[1:38:48] was the first man that god could come
[1:38:52] into and all that god was he poured into
[1:38:55] christ
[1:38:56] that was the first superman and let me
[1:38:59] just
[1:38:59] stop this before i go on i don't want to
[1:39:02] forget this
[1:39:03] i was thinking about in the old
[1:39:05] testament it's so amazing you know
[1:39:07] and we said it you probably we've heard
[1:39:10] it preached over and over
[1:39:12] but but but the branham description when
[1:39:14] he gives the description of david and
[1:39:17] and samson and and and people he never
[1:39:20] actually talked about anything good
[1:39:22] about their physical
[1:39:24] nothing i never heard him say well he
[1:39:26] was
[1:39:27] big and he had you know the cc boys and
[1:39:30] i mean oh my goodness i mean you would i
[1:39:33] mean you would think about a skinny guy
[1:39:35] i mean it's like what
[1:39:36] like 50 60 pounder you take the
[1:39:39] description
[1:39:41] and and the thing that blew the people
[1:39:43] minds away
[1:39:45] was because they will look at the person
[1:39:47] and look at what they did
[1:39:48] they couldn't put it together
[1:39:52] i'm talking about god superman they
[1:39:54] would look at the person
[1:39:56] and look at him and say this person can
[1:39:59] never do this i don't believe it until i
[1:40:01] see it myself
[1:40:03] it will come and they will come and
[1:40:05] they'll try everything and find out
[1:40:07] can you find out where is his strength
[1:40:10] this
[1:40:10] this is not this defies the natural law
[1:40:13] of strength
[1:40:14] this person cannot do the works that
[1:40:16] they are doing
[1:40:17] they looked at jesus and the same thing
[1:40:19] they said it says this person does not
[1:40:22] have no beauty to be desired
[1:40:25] but the same scripture says when he
[1:40:26] spoke they said
[1:40:28] what kind of manisters that even the
[1:40:30] wings and the waves will obey him
[1:40:33] my brother my sister the superman at the
[1:40:35] end time
[1:40:36] you that are sitting here you're not
[1:40:37] going to be any different
[1:40:40] in fact but says remember the man that
[1:40:42] came to abraham
[1:40:43] had dust on his feet he looked like he
[1:40:46] just walked a long distance
[1:40:47] he looked tired possibly prospered
[1:40:49] perspiring and
[1:40:51] when he got to abraham he needed water
[1:40:53] and he sat there and he ate off the food
[1:40:56] human food but who was that that was god
[1:41:02] oh great it's a mystery of godliness
[1:41:05] the mystery of godliness is the end time
[1:41:07] is a people just like you
[1:41:10] with the weaknesses with everything with
[1:41:12] all the natural things that bothers you
[1:41:15] but yet god can come within the vessel
[1:41:18] and do
[1:41:19] something according to his words
[1:41:23] it's not people that walk around that
[1:41:25] they look like they're holy all the time
[1:41:27] no it's it's people that work it's
[1:41:30] people that
[1:41:31] you know they try to do certain things
[1:41:32] and the barbara says jesus
[1:41:34] prayed for the sick he was tired and he
[1:41:37] went and sit on the rock
[1:41:38] he had a headache
[1:41:42] it's tired he says i i need some water
[1:41:45] right now
[1:41:47] god in the human flesh and that's the
[1:41:50] superman
[1:41:51] when he got into that flesh that flesh
[1:41:54] didn't do what the flesh pleased
[1:41:56] the flesh did only to produce the works
[1:41:59] of god
[1:42:00] that flesh was only focused to produce
[1:42:02] the things that god desire
[1:42:04] and i want to say us lastly this morning
[1:42:06] if we can only come together
[1:42:09] and be focused on one objective
[1:42:12] don't worry about the world you will
[1:42:14] save it
[1:42:17] if there are elects in the world it's
[1:42:20] the life that we're living that would
[1:42:21] call them out
[1:42:24] if there are those that needs to be
[1:42:26] called out it's all works that will
[1:42:28] bring them out
[1:42:30] god working through us bringing them out
[1:42:35] but our sole focus is
[1:42:38] what is he that you want me to do but
[1:42:42] says let me continue
[1:42:45] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:42:49] and all that christ was he poured into
[1:42:51] the church
[1:42:53] and that is what calls through the
[1:42:55] superchurch
[1:42:56] he says he called he says in the church
[1:42:59] super sign
[1:43:00] god and men together that was to be the
[1:43:04] super sign
[1:43:05] the super sign was to be god and men
[1:43:08] together
[1:43:12] god back into the church manifesting as
[1:43:15] human flesh
[1:43:16] god uniting with men his sure
[1:43:20] super sign it says notice the eternal
[1:43:22] sign
[1:43:23] now he's giving you what the eternal
[1:43:24] sign is the infallible sign
[1:43:27] it will never fail it says man and it
[1:43:30] says the word
[1:43:31] and man become one
[1:43:34] and the word was with god and the word
[1:43:37] was god
[1:43:38] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:43:41] among us
[1:43:42] that's the super sign
[1:43:46] now and oh if that
[1:43:50] was the super sign of that day when that
[1:43:53] same spirit
[1:43:54] that was in jesus christ comes into
[1:43:58] his church to manifest the written word
[1:44:02] for today that is still the super sign
[1:44:11] we need that word to be manifested
[1:44:14] remember banham says
[1:44:16] when god spoke it if it didn't come to
[1:44:18] pass
[1:44:20] it says it was not light the only time
[1:44:23] the word became light
[1:44:25] is when it was in the human flesh it's
[1:44:28] only when he took flesh and was
[1:44:29] manifested
[1:44:30] and the promise for now the super church
[1:44:34] is that god will come and dwell in the
[1:44:36] flesh
[1:44:37] let me just read this in skipping so
[1:44:41] so i can get to the end here but random
[1:44:44] says in the church edge it says
[1:44:46] here is what i'm trying to say to you
[1:44:50] the law of reproduction in each species
[1:44:54] brings it forth of its own kind
[1:44:56] according to genesis 1 11.
[1:44:59] and it says and god god said let me
[1:45:02] let the earth bring forth grass and the
[1:45:05] herb healing seed
[1:45:06] and the fruits yielding fruits and the
[1:45:10] fruits healing
[1:45:11] you fruit tree yielding fruits of his
[1:45:13] own kind
[1:45:14] whose fruits is in itself upon the earth
[1:45:20] and it was so
[1:45:24] it says and whatever whatever life that
[1:45:27] was in the seed
[1:45:28] came forth into the plant and ants into
[1:45:31] the fruit
[1:45:33] and then it says the very same law
[1:45:35] applies to the church today
[1:45:38] whatever the seed started the church
[1:45:40] will will come forth
[1:45:43] will come will come forth and be like
[1:45:46] the original seed
[1:45:47] that beca the original seed because it's
[1:45:50] the same seed
[1:45:51] in other words the seed that was planted
[1:45:54] becomes the very seed at the end same
[1:45:57] thing
[1:45:58] and then he says in these last days the
[1:46:01] true church bride
[1:46:03] the christ seed will become the
[1:46:06] headstone
[1:46:06] and she will be the super church
[1:46:10] and that's where i got my title from she
[1:46:12] will be
[1:46:13] the super church and i when you go if
[1:46:16] you listen to this message but when i'm
[1:46:18] is adamantly letting you know this is
[1:46:21] not something in the future
[1:46:22] this is today this is now this is what's
[1:46:26] happening with us
[1:46:27] it will be the super church a super race
[1:46:30] she it says as she nears
[1:46:34] him
[1:46:37] as she nears him they
[1:46:40] in the bride will be so much like
[1:46:44] him
[1:46:50] is that the direction we're moving in
[1:46:52] there will be so much
[1:46:54] like him that there will be
[1:46:57] even there will even be
[1:47:00] in his image
[1:47:07] let me just say this that as we
[1:47:11] near him as we come closer to him
[1:47:15] we will be in his image we will be so
[1:47:18] much like him that will be
[1:47:20] in his image the image is what bears the
[1:47:23] resemblance of somebody
[1:47:25] like if i was not here and they project
[1:47:28] a picture of me it's an image of me
[1:47:30] it's something that shows how i look
[1:47:32] like how i
[1:47:33] act or how i move and all those things
[1:47:36] so the
[1:47:36] image is is the resemblance it's what
[1:47:40] put the characteristics of something
[1:47:42] that could be identified
[1:47:43] when you look at the image of something
[1:47:45] it tells you for you to recognize
[1:47:48] what that thing is
[1:47:52] so is the scripture says now
[1:47:55] one of the things that challenge that we
[1:47:57] run into in this end time
[1:47:58] is we know buddha says
[1:48:02] speaks about john the baptist it says
[1:48:04] when he came
[1:48:06] he came in fact he talks about he says
[1:48:08] the kind of job that he was supposed to
[1:48:10] do
[1:48:11] you don't learn by education you don't
[1:48:13] learn by theology
[1:48:15] he had to be taught by god himself so he
[1:48:17] went in the wilderness
[1:48:18] so when he came and he was presenting
[1:48:21] this was a word of god that was spoken
[1:48:23] by isaiah he said
[1:48:24] behold the virgin shall conceive and
[1:48:27] isaiah spoke it and we see
[1:48:29] that word comes forth
[1:48:32] we see the word of god come to pass in
[1:48:35] other words god speaks it
[1:48:37] and then we see it come to pass we see
[1:48:40] mary
[1:48:40] comes to display when the word comes the
[1:48:43] word itself produces
[1:48:45] the elements of who's supposed to
[1:48:46] produce the word and we see
[1:48:48] also when god came and he spoke when
[1:48:51] when john the baptist came he was able
[1:48:53] to point them back and say
[1:48:55] look this is what was prophesy this is
[1:48:58] what the interpretation
[1:49:00] of what isaiah said was this is
[1:49:02] everything that was spoken we are seeing
[1:49:04] it today
[1:49:06] on the day of pentecost but random says
[1:49:09] when peter stood up he was able to take
[1:49:11] the scripture in troll and
[1:49:13] says that this is what joel spoke that
[1:49:16] you are seeing today
[1:49:18] what you're saying today in other words
[1:49:20] calls the messenger
[1:49:21] the prophet he says is a it's the chief
[1:49:24] sign
[1:49:26] that has to be on the scene before
[1:49:28] anything can happen
[1:49:30] remember before the promised son can
[1:49:32] come to abraham
[1:49:33] god came in the human flesh amen before
[1:49:36] the royal seat could come
[1:49:38] before the world city came and then the
[1:49:41] world seed came
[1:49:42] so the manifestation of the chief's side
[1:49:45] when you see the chief sign you know
[1:49:47] that the promise of god for that
[1:49:49] is true when you hear from the chief's
[1:49:52] time
[1:49:53] you know the word of god is not going to
[1:49:55] fail when you heard from the chief sign
[1:49:58] you might as well consider it done as
[1:50:01] far as god is concerned that word is
[1:50:03] fulfilled
[1:50:05] and i want to say this it's not
[1:50:06] different from this generation
[1:50:08] when we come here and we see a messenger
[1:50:11] stand before
[1:50:12] what troubles people is the fact that
[1:50:14] when it comes and it says
[1:50:16] that christ is coming people are looking
[1:50:18] for another vessel
[1:50:19] to say oh where is he where is he where
[1:50:22] is he
[1:50:22] oh but it's the same chief's time
[1:50:25] when he stand there and says whatever he
[1:50:28] tells you
[1:50:29] follow it that's no longer a man
[1:50:31] speaking
[1:50:32] when he says i don't know what he told
[1:50:34] you when he says he turns his back
[1:50:36] that's not a man turning his back that's
[1:50:39] melchizedek
[1:50:40] standing there and turning his back
[1:50:43] [Applause]
[1:50:45] both the fulfillment and the
[1:50:47] announcement is in the same flesh
[1:50:50] what is a god manifesting himself and my
[1:50:53] brother my sister that is to show you
[1:50:55] that it's sitting here
[1:50:56] that's the same manifestation cannot
[1:50:59] stop in the prophet
[1:51:00] that same manifestation has to be in the
[1:51:02] bride's member
[1:51:08] did we see it or did we not see it
[1:51:11] if we didn't see it we're going to be
[1:51:13] waiting for a long time
[1:51:21] you have to have an image or
[1:51:22] representation of what you're trying to
[1:51:24] be like
[1:51:26] you have to understand that's why the
[1:51:28] trinity doctrines it becomes just an
[1:51:31] idolatry
[1:51:32] there's no connections at all how can
[1:51:34] this god who's three
[1:51:36] which one is going to come and dwell in
[1:51:38] me is it the father is it the son
[1:51:41] is it the holy ghost but oh if you can
[1:51:44] come to an understanding that it's only
[1:51:46] one god
[1:51:47] and he promised in the last day it will
[1:51:49] take off his spirit
[1:51:50] not another spirit his spirit then
[1:51:53] poured it down from the people
[1:51:55] that they will all have a measure of his
[1:51:56] spirit why
[1:51:58] to manifest him him was one into a body
[1:52:01] of people
[1:52:02] [Applause]
[1:52:04] his image that's the super church
[1:52:14] he continues on and says
[1:52:18] this is the order to be united with them
[1:52:24] there will be one there will be
[1:52:27] the very manifestation
[1:52:30] of the word of the living god
[1:52:35] denomination cannot produce this it says
[1:52:38] wrong seed
[1:52:41] they will produce the creeds and the
[1:52:44] dogma
[1:52:45] the mixed up words
[1:52:48] this mongolization
[1:52:51] brings forth hybrid product
[1:52:55] it says the first son adam
[1:52:59] was the spoken word seed of god he was
[1:53:02] given the right to reproduce himself
[1:53:05] that is why the bride was given to him
[1:53:08] he would produce to reproduce himself to
[1:53:11] reproduce another son of god
[1:53:14] but she failed she failed by hibernation
[1:53:18] she caused him to die the second son
[1:53:22] jesus also a spoken seed word of god
[1:53:26] was given a bride like as was adam
[1:53:29] but before he before he could get to
[1:53:31] mary
[1:53:32] before he could get to marry her she had
[1:53:35] fallen
[1:53:36] she like adam's wife was put
[1:53:40] to the test whether she would believe
[1:53:42] the word of god or live
[1:53:44] or doubt the word of god and die she
[1:53:47] doubted
[1:53:48] she left the word she died from a little
[1:53:52] group
[1:53:53] of a true seed of of of the word
[1:53:56] god will present christ with a beloved
[1:53:59] bride
[1:54:00] she is a virgin of his word she is a
[1:54:03] virgin because
[1:54:04] she knows no man no creed no dogma
[1:54:08] by and through the member of the bride
[1:54:11] will be fulfilled
[1:54:12] all that was promised of god
[1:54:15] to be made manifest in the virgin the
[1:54:18] word of
[1:54:19] the word of promise comes to the virgin
[1:54:22] mary
[1:54:23] but that word the word of promise
[1:54:27] was he himself
[1:54:30] to be man manifested god was manifest
[1:54:35] he himself acted in
[1:54:38] acted at that time and fulfilled his own
[1:54:41] word
[1:54:42] of promise in the virgin mary he was
[1:54:45] an angel that had brought to her the
[1:54:48] message
[1:54:49] but the angel the angel's message
[1:54:53] was the word of god isaiah 9 and 6.
[1:54:56] he fulfilled at that time all that was
[1:54:59] written of him because
[1:55:01] she accepted his word to her the members
[1:55:04] of the bride
[1:55:05] will love him and they will have
[1:55:09] his potentials for he is their head
[1:55:14] and all the power belongs to him they
[1:55:17] are subject to him
[1:55:19] as a member of of of of the bodies
[1:55:22] are subject to the head
[1:55:26] and i want to say this we are coming
[1:55:29] into the union
[1:55:32] we are coming into the manifestation
[1:55:35] where christ the head is manifesting
[1:55:39] himself in the bride
[1:55:41] and i trust that we're doing every thing
[1:55:43] we can
[1:55:45] we're eating off the word we're
[1:55:47] continuing in the
[1:55:48] revelation of what is showing us so we
[1:55:51] can fulfill
[1:55:52] our part of the prophecy a believer in
[1:55:56] this end time
[1:55:57] can never be satisfied with just an
[1:55:59] average
[1:56:00] i want to be that super church and
[1:56:03] whatever it takes i say god
[1:56:05] bring it on me
[1:56:08] i heard of that super church and i'm a
[1:56:10] member of it
[1:56:12] and there's something within me that's
[1:56:13] calling for me to be part of it
[1:56:16] because remember he says that the bride
[1:56:18] in the same time will not fail
[1:56:20] it says e fall but this bride will not
[1:56:23] fail
[1:56:24] for one reason why she's the word
[1:56:29] she's the word and if we are the word
[1:56:32] let's manifest the word let the word
[1:56:36] it's not as manufacturing and now it's a
[1:56:39] hymn
[1:56:39] working through us if the desire within
[1:56:42] your heart
[1:56:43] he looks at it and because the scripture
[1:56:45] says you draw near to me i'll journey on
[1:56:47] to you
[1:56:48] the more we want him the more we desire
[1:56:50] it the more he say
[1:56:52] do you think we have more desire than
[1:56:54] god does
[1:56:56] you think we want god more than he wants
[1:56:59] us
[1:57:00] oh i tell you that that your desire
[1:57:03] is only a little peace it's only a
[1:57:05] sliver
[1:57:06] of what he wants to push out for you we
[1:57:09] couldn't even contain all that here
[1:57:13] let's stand
[1:57:23] if the musician could come
[1:57:50] uh
[1:57:58] he says now there's a super sign
[1:58:04] of the holy spirit we know
[1:58:08] we absolutely know that christ still
[1:58:10] lives and reigns
[1:58:12] he is the super one he says you talk
[1:58:15] about the superman
[1:58:17] the devil has something to counterfeit
[1:58:20] the very
[1:58:21] things that god has made everything that
[1:58:24] the devil has got
[1:58:26] he says he makes it off of something
[1:58:29] that's original
[1:58:32] the devil cannot create now
[1:58:35] you know that and if the devil is a
[1:58:38] creator
[1:58:38] then we've got two creators the devil
[1:58:41] cannot create
[1:58:42] he perverts what what what has been
[1:58:45] created
[1:58:46] it says it says now look what is
[1:58:49] adultery
[1:58:49] adultery is a right act perverted what
[1:58:52] is lie lie is the truth perverted what
[1:58:54] is sin
[1:58:55] unrighteousness is righteousness
[1:58:57] perverted
[1:58:58] anything that the devil is devil has got
[1:59:00] is something perverted
[1:59:02] from god that god what god originally
[1:59:05] made
[1:59:05] that's the reason that they would say
[1:59:08] they will call jesus beelzebub the old
[1:59:12] foretailors devil out of out there
[1:59:16] that was perverted the spirit of the
[1:59:18] prophet it says and that's the same
[1:59:20] thing today
[1:59:21] they don't understand it but if they
[1:59:24] would only read the bible
[1:59:26] the bible said it's a super sign
[1:59:34] i think we've been given all that we
[1:59:36] need in order for us to advance into the
[1:59:39] super church
[1:59:41] the word has been revealed god is
[1:59:43] walking with us
[1:59:46] i believe we need to eat of the word i
[1:59:49] need to indeed to become
[1:59:50] one with the word i think we need to get
[1:59:53] to a place where we desire more of him
[1:59:55] than more of the things of the world
[1:59:58] we need to die to ourselves this nature
[2:00:01] was not made to inherit the kingdom but
[2:00:03] we know there's a nature within us i
[2:00:04] want to inherit of the kingdom of god
[2:00:07] and when we build the inner man by the
[2:00:09] desires and the things that we have
[2:00:12] i believe god is going to come and step
[2:00:14] into it god is going to lead us and he's
[2:00:16] going to
[2:00:17] guide us it's going to bring us into the
[2:00:19] fullness that we need to be where we can
[2:00:21] say
[2:00:22] lord i'm here i'm at your service
[2:00:25] whatever you desire i'm here wherever
[2:00:27] you want me to go
