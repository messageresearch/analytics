[12:14] give us the thing that you've promised
[12:16] us Lord we receive it all with joy today
[12:19] Lord God in your name we pray
[12:22] [Music]
[12:27] you may be seated as we invipara team
[12:29] sailor to read up songs
[12:44] and welcome to the house of the Lord he
[12:46] could have remained standing I pray it
[12:48] won't be long here but
[12:51] collect our thoughts and be concise uh
[12:53] what a beautiful day the Lord has made
[12:55] amen
[12:56] amen
[12:58] we need to be determined to rejoice and
[13:00] be glad in it
[13:02] you know this is a house of correction
[13:04] This House of Prayer house of worship
[13:10] but it's also a house that's been set
[13:13] aside and Sanctified where we've come
[13:16] before and receive what we have need of
[13:20] and brother Brown said more than one
[13:22] place
[13:24] that we get what we expect
[13:27] and you don't come expecting
[13:30] to get something from the Lord you're
[13:32] not going to get it if you come
[13:33] expecting to find something to criticize
[13:36] there will be plenty for you to
[13:37] criticize
[13:39] man
[13:41] we're going to read from Psalm 62 this
[13:43] morning
[13:45] and uh sort of the theme of what I have
[13:47] in my heart is expectation
[13:51] um
[13:53] an expectation
[13:56] is
[13:58] similar to Hope
[14:02] and proverbs 10 28 says the hope of the
[14:05] righteous shall be gladness but the
[14:07] expectation of the wicked Shall Perish
[14:10] so
[14:13] um
[14:16] We Believe very strongly in faith
[14:20] and even you know Paul said the just
[14:23] shall live by faith he was quoting the
[14:25] Old Testament when he said that you can
[14:27] find that in habeka
[14:29] the just live by faith and we do live by
[14:31] faith
[14:32] but the Bible also says we're saved by
[14:34] hope
[14:36] you read Romans 8 24 25 for we are saved
[14:40] by hope
[14:42] but hope that a scene is not hope for
[14:44] what a man seeth why doth he yet hope
[14:47] for but if we hope for that we see not
[14:49] then do we with patience wait for
[14:53] amen so I think to a certain degree that
[14:59] um even in the natural
[15:01] you expect something
[15:03] it's going to come to pass but
[15:05] spiritually we we find ourselves
[15:08] anchoring Our Hope and our faith in the
[15:10] word of God and that's a righteous hope
[15:12] and God will fulfill that hope
[15:16] amen so let's uh
[15:19] let's go ahead and stand and we'll read
[15:22] the
[15:23] the psalm together this morning
[15:30] you know when you get on a subject and
[15:31] you uh
[15:33] you start going through the scriptures
[15:35] and you realize that
[15:37] how much the the scripture dovetails one
[15:40] thought leads to another to another and
[15:43] they just lay exactly in line so
[15:45] whatever you have Nita
[15:47] if you just search the scriptures for in
[15:50] them we think we have eternal life and
[15:52] they are they that testify me the Bible
[15:54] says but they're going to give you
[15:55] something that you have need of and
[15:57] they're going to fulfill your heart's
[15:58] desire for your letter of the Lord so
[16:00] let's read Psalm 62 together and we'll
[16:03] focus there
[16:05] on the fifth verse says my soul wait
[16:08] thou only upon God for my expectation is
[16:12] from him amen blessed be the name of the
[16:15] Lord
[16:17] truly my soul wadeth upon God from him
[16:21] cometh my salvation he only is my rock
[16:24] and my salvation he is my defense I
[16:28] shall not be greatly moved how long will
[16:30] you imagine Mischief against the man ye
[16:33] shall be slain all of you as a Boeing
[16:35] wall shall ye be and as a tottering
[16:38] fence they only consult to cast him down
[16:41] from his Excellency they Delight in lies
[16:44] they bless with their mouth but they
[16:46] curse inwardly see lie my soul wait thou
[16:49] only upon God for my expectation is from
[16:53] him he only is my rock and my salvation
[16:56] he is my defense I shall not be moved in
[17:00] God is my salvation and my glory the
[17:03] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[17:06] God trust in him at all times you people
[17:09] pour out your heart before him God is a
[17:12] refuge for us Selah sincerely men of low
[17:15] degree are vanity and and Men of high
[17:18] degree are a lie to be laid in the
[17:20] balance they are all together lighter
[17:22] than vanity trust not in oppression and
[17:25] become not Vain and robbery if riches
[17:28] increase set not your heart upon them
[17:30] God has spoken once twice have I heard
[17:33] this that power belongeth unto God also
[17:37] unto thee O Lord belongeth Mercy for
[17:40] thou renderest to every man according to
[17:42] his word blessed be the name of the Lord

[51:42] understand the question why father we
[51:44] come shortened but one thing we know
[51:47] that if you give your word and you
[51:48] invited us Lord you provided a way that
[51:51] we could be the Lord and we pray this
[51:53] morning Father that you just come by our
[51:56] way and speak to us the words of Life
[51:58] Lord father the words that comes out of
[52:01] your mouth is with the very life that we
[52:03] need this morning Lord we don't need the
[52:06] thinking of man but we need your life to
[52:08] be extended to us be with us this
[52:11] morning Lord and father we remember our
[52:13] pastor this morning we pray for him our
[52:16] sister Leslie Lord and sister Leslie's
[52:18] sister father those that are afflicted
[52:20] out Alberto John and the passing of
[52:23] sister Gladys Lord we committed all into
[52:25] your hands and father we know that you
[52:28] have everything under your control
[52:29] father we commit all we are into your
[52:32] hands and invite you that you may come
[52:34] and take control that I got may not be
[52:37] the Gathering of men's but they will be
[52:39] the Gathering of the Living God with his
[52:41] people bless your people this morning
[52:44] we're so thankful to be here and we ask
[52:46] this things in the name of the Lord
[52:48] Jesus Christ amen
[52:50] amen
[52:52] amen before we be seated to just bring
[52:55] you greetings for my pastor Brother
[52:56] David and I spoke with him this morning
[52:59] and he's doing well and
[53:02] the
[53:04] sister Gladys
[53:06] funeral will be here
[53:09] I'm sure many of you saw the emails the
[53:12] email that was sent certainly a
[53:15] difficult time I want to remember the
[53:17] family who want to pray for them and you
[53:20] know when things like this happen it
[53:23] just you know bring us into examination
[53:26] to really wonder what is it that we live
[53:29] for
[53:30] you realize as the scripture says here
[53:33] there's no continuing City we know that
[53:36] this life this Mortal life that we have
[53:38] one day will laid down whether it be by
[53:41] way of the translation of a body or by
[53:44] death either way this life will be laid
[53:47] down you know so if all this is all that
[53:50] we have then Paul said we are the most
[53:52] miserable of all but we know that that's
[53:55] not it we know that we have a body
[53:58] waiting for us that's the hope of a
[54:00] Christian to know that there's a body as
[54:04] the scripture says that Abraham was
[54:06] looking for a city whose building
[54:07] America was God so if you can reach out
[54:10] to the brothers when you can and just
[54:12] Comfort the family and we'll pray that
[54:15] God will just be with all of the
[54:18] situation and everything let's open our
[54:21] Bibles this morning let's open in uh
[54:25] failure for being a scripture this
[54:27] morning I trust you're happy to be
[54:29] gathered in the house of God Amen let's
[54:31] open uh first in Philippians chapter 2
[54:36] verse 5 to 11.
[54:46] scripture says let this mind be in you
[54:48] which was also in Christ Jesus whom
[54:52] being in the form of God thought it not
[54:54] robbery to be equal with God but he but
[54:59] he made himself of no reputation and
[55:01] took upon him the form of a servant and
[55:05] was made in the likeness of man and
[55:08] being found in fashion as a man he
[55:10] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[55:13] death even the death of the cross it
[55:16] says wherefore God also had highly
[55:19] exalted him and given him a name which
[55:23] is above every name that at the name of
[55:26] Jesus every knee should bow
[55:29] of things in heaven of things in Earth
[55:32] and things under the Earth and that
[55:34] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[55:37] Christ is Lord to the glory of God the
[55:41] father let us open our Bibles in First
[55:44] Corinthians chapter 2 we'll start from
[55:48] verse let's just start from verse 1 it
[55:52] says and I brought around
[55:54] when I came to you came not with
[55:57] Excellency of speech or of wisdom
[56:01] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[56:05] for I determined not to know anything
[56:07] among you save Christ Jesus and save
[56:12] Jesus Christ in him crucified and I was
[56:15] with you in weakness and in fear and in
[56:18] much trembling he said in my speech and
[56:21] my preaching was not with enticing words
[56:23] of man man's Wisdom but in demonstration
[56:27] of the spirit and power it says for your
[56:31] faith for that your faith should not
[56:34] stand in the wisdom of man but in the
[56:36] power of God I'll be with we speak
[56:39] wisdom among them that are perfect it
[56:42] says yet the yet not the wisdom of this
[56:45] world no of the princes of the world
[56:48] that cometh to not but we speak the
[56:52] wisdom of God in mystery it says every
[56:56] even the thing the hidden things which
[56:59] God ordained before the foundation the
[57:02] the before the world unto our Glory
[57:06] which none of the princes of the world
[57:08] knew
[57:10] for had they known it they would not
[57:13] have crucified the Lord of Glory but as
[57:16] it is written eyes and eyes have not
[57:18] seen no ear heard neither have they
[57:21] entered into the heart of man the things
[57:23] which God had prepared for them which
[57:26] love him now I want you now to focus on
[57:29] the verses that are following it says
[57:31] but God had revealed them unto us by his
[57:34] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[57:37] things yea the Deep things of God
[57:40] he says for what a man knoweth the
[57:44] things of of men save the spirit of men
[57:47] which is in him even so the things of
[57:51] God knoweth no man but the spirit of God
[57:54] it says now we have received not the
[57:58] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[58:01] is of god that we might well we might
[58:04] know the things which are freely given
[58:07] to us
[58:08] of God which things are also we also we
[58:13] speak not in The Words which men's
[58:16] wisdom teach but which the Holy Ghost
[58:21] teachers comparing spiritual things with
[58:24] spiritual
[58:26] it says but the natural man receiveth
[58:29] not the things of the spirit of God for
[58:32] they are foolished unto them neither can
[58:35] he know them because they are
[58:38] spiritually discerned
[58:40] he says but he that is spiritual judges
[58:45] all things yet he himself
[58:49] himself is judged of no man
[58:53] for who have for who has the mind of the
[58:57] Lord that he may instruct him listen to
[59:01] this but we have the mind of Christ
[59:07] our gracious father we ask once again
[59:09] that you bless your word to us in the
[59:11] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you
[59:14] may have your seats this morning
[59:21] this morning for a few moments I would
[59:24] like to speak on
[59:27] our our identification at the end time
[59:31] and to kind of add a little more
[59:34] specific to it as we move along is I
[59:39] want to say that our identification
[59:42] needs to be a word based identification
[59:46] a word based identification
[59:49] but Barnum speaks about the time that we
[59:52] live in he makes a comment and he says
[59:55] that the evening time is the time of
[59:58] identification that he
[1:00:02] the scripture speaks in Matthew Chapter
[1:00:04] 13 you don't have to turn there or just
[1:00:07] summarize it it speaks about the parable
[1:00:10] of the sower how that master came and he
[1:00:14] sow seed and he sowed the seed on the
[1:00:16] field and they said that and then
[1:00:19] afterward afterwards the enemy came and
[1:00:21] he also saw seed in the same field and
[1:00:24] so the servants came into the master and
[1:00:27] they said it says Master you sow The
[1:00:30] Good Seed and yet behold while we were
[1:00:33] asleep he said the enemy came in he saw
[1:00:36] the tears on the field and then he asked
[1:00:39] that he asked them and they said should
[1:00:40] we go in and and start plugging out all
[1:00:43] their tears and everything the master
[1:00:45] looked at him he says no let it grow
[1:00:48] together let it to stay together let it
[1:00:51] be that way and he said but in the
[1:00:54] evening time it will come the time of
[1:00:56] identification when the seed will grow
[1:00:59] and it will produce the fruit will have
[1:01:01] the ability to come and look and know
[1:01:03] which one is the seed and which one is
[1:01:05] it there and the tail will be binded
[1:01:07] together to be burned and the seed will
[1:01:10] be put in the Garner so he speaks here
[1:01:13] to show us that the time for
[1:01:15] identification is not the morning time
[1:01:18] it's not the first age it's not the
[1:01:20] second age the time of identification
[1:01:23] the identification comes into plain view
[1:01:25] in the evening time at the time where
[1:01:29] what was sown in the beginning will have
[1:01:31] to manifest at the end time the time
[1:01:33] where the seed that was planted into the
[1:01:36] ground will come into manifestation with
[1:01:39] his works the time where the fruits will
[1:01:42] come forth and it will be seen and
[1:01:44] examined for what they are what random
[1:01:46] says again that it's important we
[1:01:49] realize that in it he says that the time
[1:01:51] that we are living in he says he says
[1:01:54] it's important
[1:01:55] that that we realize that we cannot do
[1:01:59] anything without identification
[1:02:01] especially with uh heightened security
[1:02:04] and the world that we live in today you
[1:02:07] know I remember back in the days you
[1:02:10] know when you had a computer or whatever
[1:02:12] anytime you put a a a password it was
[1:02:15] perhaps just the two or four letters and
[1:02:18] that was it you know you were put and
[1:02:20] then that was it you get access to
[1:02:22] whatever you need but because of the
[1:02:24] season and the time that we live in now
[1:02:27] your password is gonna be so long it
[1:02:29] can't be 40 anymore it has to be 16 or
[1:02:32] 24. now in fact people have moved away
[1:02:35] from password is what they call the
[1:02:37] passphrase
[1:02:40] a passphrase it means you put something
[1:02:42] that can remind you of something or you
[1:02:44] you change letters and all the and even
[1:02:47] after you have that you have to put what
[1:02:49] they call a second level Authentication
[1:02:54] like I thought I just put the password
[1:02:56] well you know they want to know who you
[1:02:58] are they want to know this they want to
[1:03:00] know and all of that is to make sure
[1:03:02] that you have been properly identified
[1:03:05] before you can gain access to what you
[1:03:07] need to be accessed to all of that is to
[1:03:11] preserve uh the things that have uh the
[1:03:14] the the information that is being put
[1:03:16] they want to make sure that if they let
[1:03:18] you through it's truly you it really
[1:03:21] belongs to you it's yours and I want to
[1:03:24] say this spiritually speaking is the
[1:03:26] same thing we live in the time where
[1:03:29] there is a group and the qualification
[1:03:31] of a bride and you cannot just gain
[1:03:34] access to it anytime you want it's just
[1:03:37] not given to anybody it's a group of
[1:03:40] people that have to pass the perfect
[1:03:42] identification in order for them to know
[1:03:44] who they really are in order for them to
[1:03:47] get access to the benefits that are
[1:03:49] behind that it's not just something the
[1:03:52] whole world can claim but when I'm says
[1:03:54] Jesus came and he gave his life for the
[1:03:57] world and and he came and he says he
[1:03:59] died for the sin of the whole world but
[1:04:01] they rejected him
[1:04:03] in fact it says when he comes back to
[1:04:06] the Church of the end time Jesus finds
[1:04:08] himself outside of the church and he
[1:04:11] says now he's no longer dealing with you
[1:04:14] as a church is no longer dealing with
[1:04:17] people as a church he's now going to the
[1:04:20] individuals why because the church had
[1:04:22] rejected him the church had built his
[1:04:25] own Dogma in understanding a
[1:04:27] denomination and they rejected the word
[1:04:30] of God and for that God is now dealing
[1:04:33] with you with as an individual
[1:04:36] what about him speaks and and I was
[1:04:39] thinking even uh uh this morning I began
[1:04:42] to think uh uh we we live in a time
[1:04:45] where everything has to be identified
[1:04:48] you you can't hide behind anything
[1:04:50] anymore if you try to hide behind you
[1:04:54] will be found out it's not time to be
[1:04:57] lukewarm I would say this morning it's
[1:05:00] not time to mix a little bit of a church
[1:05:02] and a little bit of of Christianity the
[1:05:04] scripture says it will vomit you out of
[1:05:07] his mouth if that's the way you are God
[1:05:10] is looking for people that are perfectly
[1:05:12] identified to the end time message that
[1:05:15] is given us it's not a time where we
[1:05:18] could say well I'll use the word when he
[1:05:20] suits me and I'll lose the world when I
[1:05:22] see that it works for me if you are that
[1:05:25] way this morning God will reject you God
[1:05:28] once is looking for a people that have
[1:05:31] given all that they are they want the
[1:05:34] word or nothing they want on Christ or
[1:05:37] nothing they're not interested in the
[1:05:40] mixing they're not interesting in being
[1:05:42] accepted by the world and and and good
[1:05:46] with the word world and everything and
[1:05:48] then come to church they're not
[1:05:49] interested in coming to church and going
[1:05:51] back it's a time where the true sons are
[1:05:54] Desiring the true manifestation of sons
[1:05:57] in the end time
[1:06:00] we are speaking of identification we
[1:06:02] could say we we we we live in a time
[1:06:06] when we look at the world around us
[1:06:07] people aspire to be uh like the great
[1:06:11] inventors it will want to be it used to
[1:06:14] be that we could save in the time of
[1:06:16] ramanam people looked at Hollywood star
[1:06:18] and they emulated them they wanted to
[1:06:21] identify with those people they wanted
[1:06:23] to be like them but yet today we have
[1:06:26] social media we have a great inventors
[1:06:29] like Elon Musk and Jeff bezo people look
[1:06:32] at those things and they want to live
[1:06:34] their lives and matching those people
[1:06:37] they want to do they want to be rich
[1:06:39] like those people they want to live and
[1:06:41] spend money like those people do even
[1:06:43] though they don't have anything they
[1:06:45] want people live and they work up in the
[1:06:48] mind they always emulate and try to be
[1:06:51] like something that's the mind of the
[1:06:53] world but we have read this morning that
[1:06:55] we the Church of God we have received
[1:06:58] the mind of Christ and the right of the
[1:07:02] end time his emulation is Christ
[1:07:05] identifying with him his emulation is he
[1:07:09] has received the word of God and nothing
[1:07:11] interests him what he wants is to see
[1:07:14] the identification of what the word said
[1:07:16] being manifested himself
[1:07:20] it's too late to be lukewarm this
[1:07:22] morning it's too late to try to figure
[1:07:25] out is it God or it's not God it's too
[1:07:28] late to try to find you will be left out
[1:07:30] this is the time where you have to sell
[1:07:33] out of everything you give out all that
[1:07:36] you have you'll die for the word you die
[1:07:39] and you are fully committed in order for
[1:07:42] you to see a result
[1:07:45] hi everyone
[1:07:46] there's no time to be a lukewarm or a
[1:07:50] Halfway Christian God doesn't take that
[1:07:53] he didn't provide his word his word has
[1:07:56] the power to make you what he desires
[1:07:59] for you to be this morning
[1:08:01] he's not giving us a half word as we
[1:08:04] heard it even has been preached just a
[1:08:06] couple of weeks ago throughout the
[1:08:08] services is that in this generation we
[1:08:11] have received the fullness of the word
[1:08:13] we have the mind of Christ with us to
[1:08:17] know what he wants done with the word we
[1:08:19] have received what was in the beginning
[1:08:22] that God was intending to do
[1:08:24] awesome
[1:08:27] now the scripture and I'll say this that
[1:08:31] the scripture tells us in Revelation
[1:08:33] chapter 22 and it says and and listen to
[1:08:37] this it says and he said unto me still
[1:08:40] not the saying of the prophecy of this
[1:08:43] book
[1:08:45] it says for the time is at hand
[1:08:50] this is the time for it it's not about
[1:08:53] back in the time past it's not the time
[1:08:56] oh just when the prophet was here no we
[1:08:59] leave it's a season it's not a day it's
[1:09:01] a season that we are living in this is
[1:09:04] the time and it says it says that he
[1:09:07] that is unjust let him be unjust till so
[1:09:12] this is not the time where there's a
[1:09:15] transformation to say well you know the
[1:09:17] world we can look at the world and say
[1:09:19] well the world will get better no that's
[1:09:21] not the promise of these this time it
[1:09:24] says he that is unjust will be unjust
[1:09:27] till it says and he which is filthy let
[1:09:31] him be filthy still and he that is
[1:09:33] righteous let him be righteous still and
[1:09:36] he that is Holy let him be holy still
[1:09:39] and he says and behold I come quickly
[1:09:42] and my reward is with me to give every
[1:09:46] man according to his work shall be now I
[1:09:51] want to say this it's important you
[1:09:53] realize that the world is never going to
[1:09:55] get better all right
[1:09:59] there's not gonna be another gospel
[1:10:01] preached to the world so the world can
[1:10:04] be transformed and saved the scripture
[1:10:06] says the time is at hand where the world
[1:10:09] will continue to be in the situation
[1:10:11] that is in it will get worse and worse
[1:10:13] and worse but there's a people that have
[1:10:16] received the word of God where the
[1:10:18] scripture is telling us that he that is
[1:10:20] Holy let him be holy still in other
[1:10:22] words the message that will be preached
[1:10:25] to her will continue to keep her holy
[1:10:27] until the end time that message will
[1:10:30] continue to keep him holy every day
[1:10:34] so we can say this morning we are living
[1:10:38] in the time of identification where what
[1:10:41] God intended to do in the beginning what
[1:10:43] the whole program of God was about in
[1:10:46] the eve in the morning is now being
[1:10:48] manifested in the evening time this is
[1:10:51] the age of manifestation but when it
[1:10:54] says it's sea time it's the age of
[1:10:56] manifestation this is not the time to be
[1:10:59] here this is the time to be manifested
[1:11:01] and I want to say this we are not called
[1:11:03] to be Christians so we can hide in the
[1:11:06] closet while everybody is getting out of
[1:11:08] the closet we are living in a time where
[1:11:10] it's time for us to manifest what we
[1:11:13] were called to be foreign
[1:11:17] boldly and proclaim the word of God for
[1:11:20] what we have been called to be why
[1:11:22] because that's what God is expecting in
[1:11:24] the end time he didn't give you the word
[1:11:27] so you can be a somewhat of a or sacred
[1:11:30] question he gave you the word so you can
[1:11:33] be manifested in the world around you
[1:11:41] and the prophet tells us
[1:11:43] now let me read this we we listened to
[1:11:46] this when we were listening to God of
[1:11:48] this evil Age and and I hope I could
[1:11:50] bring this to your memory because they
[1:11:53] in fact this was part of my inspiration
[1:11:56] when I was looking at this he says now
[1:11:59] in uh the God of this evil age paragraph
[1:12:02] 56 it says the two Spirits it says one
[1:12:06] of them is God's holy spirit the other
[1:12:09] is the devil Spirit it says working in
[1:12:12] deception he says it says the people the
[1:12:17] people of the Earth are now making their
[1:12:20] choice
[1:12:23] now listen to this let me skip let me
[1:12:26] continue it says I'm making the choice
[1:12:28] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[1:12:32] bride for Christ he is doing it by
[1:12:35] vindicating his Word of Promise to her
[1:12:37] for this age showing that it is Christ
[1:12:41] and then he says if the finger's
[1:12:43] supposed to move and they say it's your
[1:12:45] finger will move if the food is supposed
[1:12:47] to move in his age the foot will move if
[1:12:49] the eyes is to see in this age the eyes
[1:12:52] will see it says the spirit of God has
[1:12:55] it grows into the full stature of God in
[1:13:00] the age that we are living in the Holy
[1:13:02] Spirit is here vindicating the message
[1:13:05] of the hour
[1:13:07] now let me say this the devil is calling
[1:13:11] out his bride too God is here to call
[1:13:14] out this bride people that were
[1:13:16] predestinated to be part of his kingdom
[1:13:19] people that were predestinated to be his
[1:13:21] representation in the end time and
[1:13:24] that's the time that God is is now
[1:13:27] sending his word to identify them and at
[1:13:29] the same time the devil is also calling
[1:13:32] out a people he's calling out by
[1:13:34] deception as the prophet tells us so he
[1:13:36] can call a bride for himself by error so
[1:13:39] she can manifest the things that he
[1:13:41] hears he says and and the spirit and the
[1:13:45] Holy Spirit is here doing that
[1:13:47] he doing this so that the people that
[1:13:51] believe that God that believe God will
[1:13:54] be called out in this chaos of the out
[1:13:58] of this chaos the devil and holy spirit
[1:14:01] is calling his church by error as usual
[1:14:05] it says by
[1:14:08] perversion of the word like he did in
[1:14:11] the beginning seed coming right back to
[1:14:14] the seed time again from Eden here it is
[1:14:18] again and I want to say this this
[1:14:20] morning let me say this this morning
[1:14:22] whether you you believe it or not or
[1:14:25] whether you you think it or not you are
[1:14:28] here making your decision on the same
[1:14:31] subject this morning you are here making
[1:14:34] your decision to your final destination
[1:14:37] whatever tells us he says it's the
[1:14:40] decision or the choices that we make
[1:14:42] every day that determines our Eternal
[1:14:45] destination
[1:14:48] yeah you you didn't just stumble in
[1:14:51] church this morning you decided to come
[1:14:53] to church this morning you decided to
[1:14:56] come here this morning and hear the word
[1:14:58] of God you made that decision you decide
[1:15:01] what you want to eat you decide what you
[1:15:04] want to drink you decide where you want
[1:15:06] to work you decide all of those things
[1:15:07] and I want to remind you this morning
[1:15:09] that those the combination of those
[1:15:12] decisions is that all together trying to
[1:15:16] show you where you are headed to
[1:15:22] that's why it's important we realize we
[1:15:25] there's no such thing as oh I'm just
[1:15:27] doing it and there's no consequences
[1:15:32] there's no such thing well I'm just
[1:15:34] gonna do this and and then forget about
[1:15:36] it and then I'll go the other way
[1:15:40] it's in that you make it's part of this
[1:15:43] something structure and it's leading you
[1:15:45] somewhere
[1:15:47] I believe this morning that God wants
[1:15:49] you to make the right decision he wants
[1:15:52] you let me say this you the the
[1:15:53] challenge that we run into is we have
[1:15:56] this double identification where we were
[1:15:59] born in sin and In the Flesh and all of
[1:16:01] those things and we know of those things
[1:16:03] but yet within us God has placed a seed
[1:16:06] which is a different identification from
[1:16:08] what the flesh is but yet we try to work
[1:16:11] by the natural thinking that that's the
[1:16:14] way God wants us to work and he's here
[1:16:16] by his word telling you that I want you
[1:16:18] to identify with a seed that I placed
[1:16:20] inside of you and make your decision
[1:16:23] based on the spiritual
[1:16:26] we just read it it says the natural man
[1:16:29] is not made to understand the spiritual
[1:16:31] things it's foolish says to him either
[1:16:34] the spiritual is foolishness to the
[1:16:36] Flesh and the flesh is uh foolishness
[1:16:38] through the spiritual but I said he said
[1:16:40] to you but you have the mind of Christ
[1:16:43] to understand what he wants to do
[1:16:51] when
[1:16:53] it's important
[1:16:55] that we really grasp this identification
[1:17:01] that the prophet is talking about
[1:17:06] and like I said
[1:17:08] it's important that our identification
[1:17:10] this this morning
[1:17:12] be a word based identification and not
[1:17:16] some man's made understanding about
[1:17:18] ourselves and what we think
[1:17:21] we
[1:17:22] we have to know within ourselves and if
[1:17:26] you don't it's important you pray for
[1:17:29] God to reveal this to you
[1:17:31] it's important that we understand that I
[1:17:35] believe this message because God chose
[1:17:37] me to believe it
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:43] it's important you understand that I'm
[1:17:46] here this morning I'm sitting with this
[1:17:48] group of people from all over the world
[1:17:50] from all the countries from all over
[1:17:52] that I can never have been with under no
[1:17:55] other circumstance and the only reason
[1:17:58] I'm here with him is because God chose
[1:18:00] me to be here
[1:18:03] it's important when you wake up to put
[1:18:05] your shoes and to put your clothes to
[1:18:07] come to church and know that I believe
[1:18:09] this message because God let me know
[1:18:12] this message
[1:18:14] and because I've studied it it's not
[1:18:16] because my mother believe it my father
[1:18:18] believes it or somebody told me about it
[1:18:21] that's why I believe it now somebody may
[1:18:23] have told you about it but the true
[1:18:26] Revelation comes directly from God
[1:18:28] that's the kind of identification you
[1:18:30] need this morning
[1:18:33] otherwise it's all natural It's All
[1:18:36] Flesh and let me just say this before I
[1:18:38] can even move on anything that's flesh
[1:18:41] oriented will produce death anything
[1:18:44] that's flesh related will not take you
[1:18:46] anywhere anything that's flesh will only
[1:18:49] bring death but the identification the
[1:18:52] spiritual identification will bring God
[1:18:54] on the sea
[1:18:59] we we get caught up in a a flesh man and
[1:19:04] and a way of doing things in the flesh
[1:19:06] and you get sick or let me go get a
[1:19:09] Tylenol there this happen and you go but
[1:19:11] you forget that within that man there is
[1:19:14] a spiritual person that's waiting to be
[1:19:16] identified
[1:19:19] God is calling out every day and putting
[1:19:22] you in circumstances where he's wanting
[1:19:25] you to forget about the spirit the
[1:19:27] natural man and to focus on the
[1:19:29] spiritual men and say I may not
[1:19:31] understand it with my mind I may not be
[1:19:34] able to explain it with my mind but I
[1:19:36] know that there's a God in heaven who
[1:19:38] made his word available for him and
[1:19:41] that's what I believe this morning
[1:19:47] says
[1:19:48] he preached a message called
[1:19:51] Jesus keeps all his appointment
[1:19:54] Jesus keeps all his appointment and if
[1:19:57] he kept his an appointment in the first
[1:19:59] age it's the same God he's here to keep
[1:20:03] the evening time appointment of a group
[1:20:06] of people that he himself is calling out
[1:20:08] that he wants to manifest himself
[1:20:11] through them
[1:20:15] when you when you hear this message this
[1:20:17] morning it's not good enough for us to
[1:20:20] just gather and rejoice and say oh thank
[1:20:24] God for sending a messenger thank God
[1:20:26] what God is looking for is one person to
[1:20:29] stand up and say that's for me if you
[1:20:32] may not understand the unders you may
[1:20:34] not understand what the identification
[1:20:36] is but I want the identification to be a
[1:20:40] personal identification
[1:20:44] why do you believe it
[1:20:46] God placed Something in My Heart To
[1:20:48] Believe
[1:20:50] I I have seen it's gotten me out of
[1:20:53] trouble it's healed me from my
[1:20:55] sicknesses it saved me from Death it's
[1:20:59] gotten me out of my own trouble I've
[1:21:01] messed up so many times he kept doing it
[1:21:04] to me there's no way you can tell me
[1:21:06] something outside of that that's my
[1:21:08] identification I don't only know him by
[1:21:11] the word but I know him by the reality
[1:21:14] of him making himself known unto me
[1:21:18] oh I so enjoy the service on Wednesday
[1:21:21] because it's so important you realize
[1:21:24] God is moving you into another category
[1:21:26] Abraham was given the option
[1:21:30] oh his flesh gave him an option he says
[1:21:33] you can use that car look at you you are
[1:21:36] old you can't have a children all the
[1:21:38] symptoms were put together you passed
[1:21:41] the age and this is what happened
[1:21:42] there's never been under no he didn't
[1:21:45] have anybody to relate to
[1:21:47] to say well God give that one a child
[1:21:50] and on the old age I'm going to also
[1:21:52] have no all he had is a bucket full of
[1:21:55] symptoms of why he couldn't have a child
[1:21:57] and another side all he had is to
[1:22:00] believe the word of the Living God and
[1:22:02] Abraham had a choice to make all but he
[1:22:05] chose to believe the word of a living
[1:22:07] God and the word produced the son
[1:22:11] the word produced the son the word will
[1:22:14] produce a body change for you you don't
[1:22:17] have to look for it you just have to
[1:22:19] believe the word and let the word
[1:22:21] produce the body change
[1:22:25] foreign
[1:22:30] man has an identification
[1:22:33] we are our human identification is we
[1:22:37] give you a program
[1:22:39] you know in order for you to belong to a
[1:22:41] church we want you to write your name on
[1:22:43] the book we want you to pay your tithes
[1:22:46] and your offerings and and come and and
[1:22:49] tell us and you read the message you
[1:22:51] read the book and you read the Bible you
[1:22:53] are part of the Kingdom
[1:22:56] and and when we feel like that's not
[1:22:58] enough we begin to give you steps of
[1:23:00] what you should do oh these are the five
[1:23:03] steps in order to be pleasing to God
[1:23:04] this is what you need to do in order for
[1:23:07] you to be acceptable to God so what what
[1:23:09] that what happens is in the church
[1:23:11] denomination people move from one step
[1:23:14] to another they continue continually as
[1:23:18] the scripture says continually learning
[1:23:20] and never coming to any realization
[1:23:24] oh you know I did those I read those
[1:23:27] five steps in a practice I did all of
[1:23:29] them and nothing came well you know what
[1:23:31] I have the six step books over here
[1:23:34] yeah and and God and everything about
[1:23:37] God is always seemed to be a step uh
[1:23:41] more that you got to take and and you're
[1:23:43] going to just jump a little more and you
[1:23:45] didn't jump high enough you didn't do
[1:23:46] that's not the identification of the
[1:23:49] children of God let me just read here
[1:23:51] for a second before I move on all right
[1:23:54] now I'm talking about the true and the
[1:23:56] real true process of identification for
[1:24:00] the children of God in the end time now
[1:24:02] listen to what it says in in John
[1:24:04] chapter 15 and 16 it says ye have not
[1:24:08] chosen me
[1:24:10] I have chosen you so if you really want
[1:24:13] to get down to what identification is
[1:24:16] all about the first thing you got to
[1:24:18] realize is I didn't choose God
[1:24:24] the first thing you got to know is I
[1:24:27] didn't choose this I didn't make myself
[1:24:30] believe this message I had nothing to do
[1:24:33] with God I didn't choose religion God
[1:24:36] came and chose me God can have brought
[1:24:39] me out of my sin God came and saved me
[1:24:42] out of my worldliness God came and saved
[1:24:45] me because if it's your own
[1:24:47] identification it will fail you
[1:24:51] what about him says man likes to think
[1:24:53] that he saw he sought God you don't know
[1:24:56] how many churches I had to go before I
[1:24:58] found the message Church
[1:25:02] you don't know how much I have to give
[1:25:05] up before I could believe this message
[1:25:07] you don't know what I had to go through
[1:25:10] in order for Who and the honest is
[1:25:12] always on them they always says always
[1:25:14] that person like that will never get any
[1:25:16] further
[1:25:18] but it's a birth who understand I didn't
[1:25:21] want this I didn't choose this I didn't
[1:25:25] choose the family that I was going to be
[1:25:26] born in I didn't I didn't choose my
[1:25:28] parents I didn't choose my country I
[1:25:31] didn't choose where I came from and the
[1:25:33] same way that God did that he came back
[1:25:36] in the spiritual he chose you to be part
[1:25:38] of the Church of the end time without
[1:25:40] you doing anything to get it
[1:25:44] and you know what that does to you when
[1:25:47] you come to the end of your wits when
[1:25:49] you know you can't do it anymore the
[1:25:51] same God comes and he picks you up so he
[1:25:54] can bring you above oh I don't want
[1:25:57] something man-made I don't want my hands
[1:25:59] to be in there because every time I
[1:26:01] touch I mess up every time I touch it
[1:26:04] turn into some trouble but oh every time
[1:26:06] that God has come by he's always brought
[1:26:09] the answer
[1:26:15] so where
[1:26:16] the identification of men is always what
[1:26:20] is it that you can do to achieve what
[1:26:22] God desired
[1:26:24] I'll make an exception today
[1:26:28] where the identification of man is
[1:26:30] always what else can you do what else
[1:26:32] can you do the identification of God is
[1:26:38] I'm here because it wants me to be here
[1:26:40] and in fact I can even say that this
[1:26:43] morning
[1:26:43] we are no different from the people
[1:26:45] walking down the street right now
[1:26:47] no different
[1:26:49] no different at all Abraham was no
[1:26:52] different from any mortal on you know
[1:26:54] the only thing that made a difference
[1:26:56] was God calling out of his life
[1:26:59] foreign
[1:27:01] T we are nothing
[1:27:03] we will never amount anything more than
[1:27:06] his calling because that will always be
[1:27:09] the foundation under which we are built
[1:27:11] I'm here I'm fellowshipping with you
[1:27:14] because God has allowed me to be here in
[1:27:16] this Fellowship
[1:27:21] and any identification out of that
[1:27:26] will only bring a failure
[1:27:28] will only bring destruction
[1:27:30] will only bring a man's thinking but one
[1:27:34] of them says this in the message in the
[1:27:36] message Jehovah Jireh says he says no
[1:27:41] man can come to me except my father
[1:27:43] draws him
[1:27:45] it says and after the father has given
[1:27:47] and and and the father has given it to
[1:27:50] me
[1:27:51] and all that the father has given to me
[1:27:53] will come
[1:27:55] it says what are you scared about
[1:27:58] what are you afraid of
[1:28:01] what are we scared of
[1:28:03] what are we afraid of listen it
[1:28:05] continues on it says you say well
[1:28:08] maybe I'm just not the right kind of
[1:28:10] Christian
[1:28:12] it says how can you come to God without
[1:28:15] God calling you first and all that he
[1:28:18] foreknew he hath also called is that
[1:28:21] right all that he called he had also
[1:28:23] Justified is that right and all that he
[1:28:27] justified he had also past tense the
[1:28:30] prophet said glorified amen it says it's
[1:28:34] a finished work from the foundation of
[1:28:37] the world
[1:28:40] the identification of the end time it's
[1:28:43] a presentation of a finished work it's a
[1:28:46] presentation of the work that God has
[1:28:49] been Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:28:51] God is coming down and say I'm going to
[1:28:54] tell you now what I've been working on
[1:28:56] throughout all the church ages from the
[1:28:58] foundation of the world what I've been
[1:29:00] working towards all this time and I hit
[1:29:03] it through the devil and it took it I
[1:29:06] was in the body of Christ he came and he
[1:29:08] killed it and he thought I was the end
[1:29:10] of it not understanding that he was just
[1:29:12] bringing my fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:29:14] and the things that I wanted to do in
[1:29:16] the end time now it's coming in saying
[1:29:18] that all that I've been working on the
[1:29:21] Christ of the mystery of God revealed he
[1:29:24] is that I will have a bride in the end
[1:29:25] time of my own choosing
[1:29:32] he says don't you see you are living
[1:29:36] under your privilege
[1:29:41] and I just want to bring that out this
[1:29:44] morning
[1:29:45] we are living under our privilege
[1:29:48] by only identifying with the flesh that
[1:29:51] we carry every day
[1:29:53] we are living under a privilege when our
[1:29:55] first instant is always to come and and
[1:29:58] act out according to the flesh think
[1:30:00] according to the flesh examine the
[1:30:02] situation according to your mind and
[1:30:05] doing all of those things and and always
[1:30:07] always the flesh always I'll tell you
[1:30:10] this morning the world will accept you
[1:30:13] well brother Branham says and we rented
[1:30:15] this morning and I'll perhaps mention it
[1:30:17] he said let this mind that was in Christ
[1:30:20] be also in you it says that he taught it
[1:30:23] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:30:26] when I'm says what it says he heads
[1:30:29] right after reading that statement he
[1:30:31] says he always believed the word
[1:30:34] he always believed the word so when we
[1:30:37] talk about the mind of Christ it's not
[1:30:39] some complicated things that we need to
[1:30:41] try to figure out or what is it that he
[1:30:43] wants to do what is he talking about the
[1:30:46] mind that was in Christ is that he
[1:30:48] always believed the word in fact in
[1:30:51] perfect Faith he says he believed what
[1:30:53] the word said about him
[1:30:58] he taught it beat in the flesh he taught
[1:31:02] it not robbery to be equal with God let
[1:31:05] me say this this morning
[1:31:07] Jesus was not hated because of his flesh
[1:31:14] in fact they were fine with the fact
[1:31:16] that he was the son of Mary
[1:31:18] oh they didn't have a problem with that
[1:31:21] when they got hungry and tired and all
[1:31:24] those things they didn't have a problem
[1:31:26] with that if he said it was the son of
[1:31:28] Joseph and Joseph uh taught him
[1:31:31] carpentry and how to make chairs and all
[1:31:34] those things that was never a stumbling
[1:31:36] block but the thing the scripture says
[1:31:38] that what they hated him for is that you
[1:31:41] that is a man you try to make yourself
[1:31:44] God you try to make yourself equal with
[1:31:48] God the world is not going to hate you
[1:31:50] if you dress like the world if you talk
[1:31:53] like the world if you eat the world food
[1:31:55] if you do what they do if you complain
[1:31:58] like they complain if you talk like they
[1:32:00] talk oh but the moment you put on your
[1:32:03] spiritual person your christ-like person
[1:32:06] that's when you'll have the problem
[1:32:09] awesome
[1:32:10] it's not the flesh that they hate it's
[1:32:13] that
[1:32:14] identification that dwells inside of you
[1:32:17] the seeds that has to identify with the
[1:32:20] word that God is sending this time
[1:32:23] that's what they hate
[1:32:26] whatever says
[1:32:28] in the message
[1:32:31] who it says to whom would we go he says
[1:32:36] he says
[1:32:38] something knocked at your heart
[1:32:43] you Rose up and you stood up to your
[1:32:45] feet
[1:32:46] and walked down here in the yard
[1:32:49] something draws you
[1:32:52] it says let me give you let me give you
[1:32:55] what the scripture says
[1:32:57] all that the father all that he foreknew
[1:33:01] he's called
[1:33:03] it says that was God calling you
[1:33:10] that was God calling you
[1:33:13] those who we call they also justify and
[1:33:16] those who justify yet so glorify
[1:33:19] them is giving you the the very
[1:33:22] identification
[1:33:25] of who you are in the word of God a word
[1:33:30] based identification a pastor talked
[1:33:33] about the five identification of the
[1:33:36] true church at the end time I'll say
[1:33:38] this this is the reason why often time
[1:33:42] you you see someone who who has listened
[1:33:46] to the message for for who's been in the
[1:33:48] message for 30 years 40 years and they
[1:33:51] come and they walk away and and someone
[1:33:53] who's been day in and day out and has
[1:33:56] claimed to have met the Living God they
[1:33:58] walk away the problem comes is people
[1:34:00] try to identify with a letter instead of
[1:34:04] letting the spiritual identification
[1:34:06] work within their lives people try to
[1:34:08] have big explanation for everything and
[1:34:11] they know everything that the messenger
[1:34:13] said and they know what it means and
[1:34:15] they know all of those things and and
[1:34:17] yet the life is less and less reflection
[1:34:20] of everything that they know oh I rather
[1:34:22] have a life full of redundification that
[1:34:25] my
[1:34:26] of identification and and full of the
[1:34:29] word that I cannot explain
[1:34:31] they come to the place where instead of
[1:34:34] letting the same spirit that wrote the
[1:34:36] word dwelling them and bring the same
[1:34:39] life my brother my sister what we need
[1:34:41] this morning it's not a lot of knowledge
[1:34:43] what we need this morning is the holy
[1:34:46] spirit making the little bit of word
[1:34:48] that we have heard the little bit of
[1:34:50] work that we have come in contact with
[1:34:52] let him bring that to life
[1:34:55] if all you know this morning is that
[1:34:57] Christ died for you ask him to make it
[1:35:00] alive to you
[1:35:01] if all you know this morning is Christ
[1:35:04] Is A Healer ask him to make it real to
[1:35:06] you
[1:35:08] we don't need the whole container so
[1:35:12] if I arrive
[1:35:13] D it is everywhere to be quickened
[1:35:16] everywhere to be made alive everywhere
[1:35:18] to bring the perfect identification so
[1:35:21] we can come into the image of the person
[1:35:25] we can say like brother Burnham
[1:35:27] they're telling you don't know your
[1:35:29] Bible
[1:35:32] but I know the author wear well because
[1:35:35] I have met him and I have talked to him
[1:35:38] in fact there's been things which I say
[1:35:41] unto you he's the one who told me about
[1:35:43] him someone can come and say you know
[1:35:46] when the problem talks about the woman
[1:35:48] at the well do you know it's the angel
[1:35:50] that told him about it
[1:35:53] it's the angel
[1:35:55] someone he says a lot of things
[1:35:58] oftentimes we think oh he just read the
[1:36:00] Bible he says this and says that some of
[1:36:04] the things I'm telling you they don't
[1:36:06] come by just some uh men studying the
[1:36:09] book and comparing scripture with
[1:36:11] scripture or just coming reading here
[1:36:13] and reading there and reading this
[1:36:16] the study Bible and this so it says what
[1:36:20] I'm telling you it comes by divine
[1:36:22] inspiration by divine revelation God is
[1:36:26] here manifesting his word to his people
[1:36:29] and that's what we heard in this
[1:36:32] generation
[1:36:36] it says
[1:36:38] so it is your spiritual birth I'll move
[1:36:40] on quickly after this
[1:36:42] it says
[1:36:44] you do things you don't understand
[1:36:47] when you are a little baby you come to
[1:36:49] the altar
[1:36:51] you give your heart your life to Christ
[1:36:54] he says you do such thing it's a strange
[1:36:57] thing you wonder why you eat you did it
[1:37:01] but after a while when you mature as a
[1:37:04] mature Christian you understand it
[1:37:07] it says there's something picked up
[1:37:10] you see why you had to do it
[1:37:13] it says your spiritual birth your
[1:37:16] natural birth types your spiritual birth
[1:37:19] it says how how it fitted it fitted you
[1:37:24] in this life as you grow everything
[1:37:28] fitted right in
[1:37:31] because you were made for that
[1:37:35] I don't know about you but this message
[1:37:38] just seemed to fit right in
[1:37:40] right in
[1:37:42] he says it wasn't it strange things that
[1:37:45] the night that you staggered into the
[1:37:47] mission tendon the meeting and all the
[1:37:50] little church somewhere on the corner
[1:37:52] and it says something the preacher the
[1:37:54] preacher preached on in certain subject
[1:37:57] and you felt right at the altar see God
[1:38:00] knew that
[1:38:01] and then he says before the foundation
[1:38:03] of the world it seemed strange to you it
[1:38:07] says why you did that then but now you
[1:38:10] understand
[1:38:12] it says you knew what happened it's so
[1:38:15] feeding to you in this life
[1:38:18] and it says and it will also be in the
[1:38:22] life that is to come
[1:38:24] let me say this when we talk about the
[1:38:26] Rapture or the change of body but one of
[1:38:29] them is telling us it's only a changing
[1:38:32] of Dwelling Places
[1:38:36] it's not the change of nature
[1:38:39] the nature the new nature we receive it
[1:38:42] while we're still here it's not oh you
[1:38:45] got all your worldliness and everything
[1:38:47] all of the sudden you get a body change
[1:38:49] and you are changed in your soul now
[1:38:52] your soul is changed while you are here
[1:38:54] the preaching of the word is here to
[1:38:56] clean your soul to perfect the character
[1:38:59] to bring you into the image of
[1:39:01] manifestation to bring you into that
[1:39:03] place when that change your body takes
[1:39:05] place it's only a change of Dwelling
[1:39:08] Places
[1:39:10] amen
[1:39:14] that's why it's important that we hear
[1:39:16] the word of God because it's the molding
[1:39:19] character the prophet tells us we won't
[1:39:22] take anything outside of our character
[1:39:24] we won't take anything the only thing
[1:39:26] we'll take over there will be our
[1:39:27] character
[1:39:33] now he says
[1:39:36] I want to just say this this morning
[1:39:40] it's the word of God
[1:39:43] that performs the identification
[1:39:51] the word of God identify
[1:39:54] the season under which we are living in
[1:39:56] to tell you that in the last days
[1:40:00] men will be it tells you about all that
[1:40:04] the situation or the man's condition
[1:40:06] will be lovers of pleasure more than
[1:40:09] lovers of God hiding a high-minded they
[1:40:12] will hate each other there will be
[1:40:13] rumors of wars and Wars over here it
[1:40:16] gives you the perfect description of
[1:40:19] what type of identification they will
[1:40:20] have
[1:40:22] and the same word of God it comes to a
[1:40:25] group of people and it says that in the
[1:40:27] end time I will have a bride of my own
[1:40:30] choosing the scripture speaks about
[1:40:32] Philip and Nathaniel in John 1 and 14 it
[1:40:35] says that if Philip came and he came to
[1:40:38] Jesus and and he went and and after he
[1:40:41] had met with Jesus and he went and
[1:40:42] called Nathaniel he says oh he came and
[1:40:45] says I want you to come and and meet
[1:40:47] Jesus and he says oh could anything good
[1:40:49] come out of Nazareth he knew uh the
[1:40:52] reputation of Nazareth and all those
[1:40:54] things but Philip told him he says why
[1:40:56] don't you just come and see and the
[1:40:58] prophet tells us perfect answer it says
[1:41:01] just come and see for yourself and so
[1:41:03] Nathanael comes and as he comes before
[1:41:06] Jesus Jesus being the word looks at
[1:41:10] Nathaniel and says Behold a Jew in whom
[1:41:14] there's no guile
[1:41:17] the word identified exactly who he was
[1:41:21] and Philip looked at him that Daniel
[1:41:24] looked at him and says Master he says
[1:41:26] when have you known me it says before
[1:41:28] Philip called you when you were under
[1:41:31] the tree
[1:41:32] I I saw you
[1:41:35] before Philip called you when you were
[1:41:38] under the tree I saw you oh my brother
[1:41:41] my sister our calling is not just
[1:41:44] because when we were born I'm calling
[1:41:46] but when I'm texting right back in fact
[1:41:49] I'll read it here says the the
[1:41:51] identification at the end time is the
[1:41:54] returning to what was in the beginning
[1:41:56] is the returning or what God purpose for
[1:42:00] you to be when you come on Earth let me
[1:42:04] say that sin stepped in because of the
[1:42:06] way we were born we came and we forgot
[1:42:09] our true identification we were given
[1:42:11] the identification of the world your
[1:42:13] name is John and and this is the parents
[1:42:16] that you come in and this is the country
[1:42:18] that you come and all those things but
[1:42:20] in the end time when the world comes the
[1:42:23] identification is not returning you to
[1:42:25] your parents the identification is to
[1:42:27] return you right back to the purpose
[1:42:30] that God placed you on this planet for
[1:42:44] and I want to ask this morning
[1:42:52] what what is your heart desire
[1:42:57] for identification
[1:42:59] when you wake up in the morning
[1:43:02] when you consider your days
[1:43:05] when you consider your time
[1:43:08] when you consider the things that you
[1:43:10] are involved in
[1:43:11] what identification arises from your
[1:43:14] heart
[1:43:16] let me say this this the morning
[1:43:19] we we we get born in the world and
[1:43:23] I know we have to work
[1:43:25] in fact
[1:43:27] the world is set up in such a way you
[1:43:29] were born and you have to be educated
[1:43:31] for
[1:43:32] some 18 years and get a piece of paper
[1:43:35] and and call yourself an engineer oh I'm
[1:43:39] a doctor and I'm a lawyer I'm such and
[1:43:43] such and and it seems like we put more
[1:43:46] value in that identification
[1:43:49] more than what God has called us to be
[1:43:52] we contend to with our whatever job we
[1:43:56] have and the the the the the reaches we
[1:43:59] have in this world we we go around we
[1:44:02] have no problem say I'm a builder I'm
[1:44:05] such and such I'm a mechanic I'm this
[1:44:07] and I'm all of this and we have no
[1:44:10] problem but we have a problem saying I'm
[1:44:11] a son of God
[1:44:18] don't be conformed to this world be it
[1:44:22] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:44:24] let's let don't let your your the things
[1:44:27] and I'm not saying go quit your job and
[1:44:29] go do this go do that I'm just saying
[1:44:31] whatever you do let the identification
[1:44:34] that God has given you take priority
[1:44:37] over everything about you I thought
[1:44:40] about myself I said what if God was to
[1:44:42] ask me to quit my job
[1:44:45] I thought well it'll be interesting
[1:44:49] I'd wonder how he would talk to me
[1:44:51] my goodness he would have to shut
[1:44:54] everything up I mean it's like the light
[1:44:56] will have to shine and the doors will
[1:44:59] have to shut down I mean it would have
[1:45:00] to be a terrible thing
[1:45:06] it's kind of a mind we're like an
[1:45:09] ostrich our head is just this is what I
[1:45:11] got to do this is what I gotta do I got
[1:45:12] to make money I gotta do this I gotta do
[1:45:14] this I gotta pay the bills and then the
[1:45:16] more work you do the less money you make
[1:45:18] and the more money you make the more
[1:45:20] bills it comes it never works out
[1:45:24] I added hours to my job in fact you know
[1:45:27] I joke that I would make the same if I
[1:45:30] was working at McDonald's
[1:45:35] but that's our daily identification we
[1:45:38] constantly I mean we we there's always
[1:45:40] much to do than this time
[1:45:43] you know this oh I don't have time for
[1:45:45] that I don't have time for that because
[1:45:47] why we continually
[1:45:49] continually just being involved and the
[1:45:52] devil is pulling here pulling here you
[1:45:55] got two jobs no that's not enough you
[1:45:57] need a third one so you can pay that out
[1:45:59] of Bill and and then you got the third
[1:46:01] one no that's not enough because you
[1:46:03] can't say for vacation you get another
[1:46:05] one all of a sudden you drive yourself
[1:46:07] crazy
[1:46:10] neurotic age people don't have enough to
[1:46:13] be satisfied the only thing that will
[1:46:16] satisfy the soul is the revealed word of
[1:46:19] the hour let me tell you this morning
[1:46:21] identify with God and you will be happy
[1:46:24] with your life whether you make five
[1:46:26] dollars an hour or you make a million
[1:46:29] dollars an hour it's not about money
[1:46:31] it's about the proper identification
[1:46:35] your soul is not at peace it's not
[1:46:37] because of your job it's because of the
[1:46:40] wrong identification it's because you're
[1:46:42] constantly looking for happiness in the
[1:46:45] things that don't produce any happiness
[1:46:47] you get in god it don't matter what you
[1:46:50] have or what you don't have you know God
[1:46:52] will provide for you
[1:46:55] he says I never seen a righteous bad
[1:46:57] Bread have you ever tried that before
[1:47:00] have you ever had an experience of that
[1:47:02] before you try him and he will make his
[1:47:04] word a reality to you
[1:47:10] we run ourselves down
[1:47:13] you know talking with my father-in-law
[1:47:16] we're talking and I made a comment I
[1:47:18] said
[1:47:19] it's just the the world is getting in
[1:47:22] such a pressure
[1:47:24] that the body cannot handle
[1:47:28] this body is not made to do the amount
[1:47:31] of things that we make it do a day
[1:47:36] you know in the back in the days you
[1:47:39] know if I was going to come to visit you
[1:47:40] it was probably a whole day event you
[1:47:44] know if I would have to get on my horse
[1:47:46] or if I would have to walk or whatever I
[1:47:49] know there's no other place I'm gonna be
[1:47:51] I'm just going to go and we're going to
[1:47:53] spend time and I'll come back no now I
[1:47:56] can visit five people in the same day
[1:47:58] I'll go here I'll go here and then after
[1:48:01] that I'll go do my groceries I'll go do
[1:48:03] this I'll fill up my day to the Brinks
[1:48:08] foreign
[1:48:09] you do that you still got more to do
[1:48:12] how come I'm not satisfied I did so much
[1:48:15] can I not take the next day off no
[1:48:21] that's the world identification
[1:48:23] that's the world that we're living in
[1:48:25] never satisfy always seeking always
[1:48:28] wanting always looking but God has an
[1:48:32] identification for his people and we say
[1:48:34] this this morning uh the time is running
[1:48:37] out before before I could run out of
[1:48:39] time you know but if one of them says
[1:48:41] this they all that what God always had
[1:48:44] against Israel was the fact that they
[1:48:48] never wanted to identify only with God
[1:48:50] God called them to be
[1:48:55] God made him so he can be king over them
[1:48:57] guess what they wanted a worldly King we
[1:49:01] want to dress like the world we want to
[1:49:04] talk like them we want to be like hola
[1:49:06] either God provided for them they never
[1:49:09] in fact God fought their battle God
[1:49:12] placed them in the position where all
[1:49:14] the nations will know that the god of
[1:49:16] Israel is the real God God did all of
[1:49:19] that for them he was there providing to
[1:49:22] every one of us he gave them a land they
[1:49:24] never deserved he he drove after the
[1:49:27] inhabitants of those lands but guess
[1:49:29] what
[1:49:30] they still want it to be like other
[1:49:31] nations we want to sing like they sing
[1:49:35] we want to dress like they dress we want
[1:49:37] to worship we will bring other gods you
[1:49:40] know they have we only have one God they
[1:49:42] have multiple gods why don't we bring
[1:49:44] the other gods
[1:49:48] let's not be like that church
[1:49:51] let's be a single-minded person
[1:49:53] let's be his person a people whose heart
[1:49:56] is set on one thing
[1:49:58] I know I have to work I know I have to
[1:50:01] do this I know I have to take care of my
[1:50:03] family but all of this God I want
[1:50:07] everything I do to be in the
[1:50:10] identification that you called me to be
[1:50:14] if the church door opens God I want to
[1:50:18] have the ability to come to your house
[1:50:20] and worship you
[1:50:22] if I have a job that I have to work on
[1:50:24] Sunday I pray God that you give me the
[1:50:27] opportunity because I don't want to be a
[1:50:30] representation of the world I want to be
[1:50:32] your representation you give me that
[1:50:34] opportunity to do it you give me away
[1:50:37] you help me Lord God you provide for me
[1:50:40] a job that will let me come to serve you
[1:50:42] and let me say this this morning those
[1:50:44] that come here it's not because they are
[1:50:46] stronger than you are he says because
[1:50:48] they believe the word they have laid
[1:50:51] they know that if I go with doubt God
[1:50:53] will provide for me so I call upon you
[1:50:55] this morning to say God I want the same
[1:50:58] thing
[1:50:59] I I don't want to be Reliant in fact I
[1:51:01] don't want to just go and say well I
[1:51:02] quit my job because no I want to be
[1:51:05] inspired to do what you want me to do
[1:51:09] we want to be a people inspired we want
[1:51:13] to be a people revelated people that
[1:51:16] know God oh that's what the scripture
[1:51:19] the prophet said the people that know
[1:51:21] their God the people that understanding
[1:51:23] God those people will do exploit that's
[1:51:27] the message of the hour
[1:51:28] yeah
[1:51:29] and I asked you this morning do you know
[1:51:32] your God
[1:51:34] up in the Red Sea he's the God who
[1:51:36] stopped the sun it's it's it's
[1:51:39] scientifically impossible to stop the
[1:51:42] sun it doesn't make any sense but your
[1:51:44] god did it
[1:51:45] it makes sense to open the right sea but
[1:51:48] your god did it it doesn't make sea to
[1:51:50] try Jordan but your god did it it
[1:51:53] doesn't make sense that a person who's a
[1:51:55] drug addict who loves the word and
[1:51:58] tomorrow can wake up change your god did
[1:52:00] it foreign
[1:52:04] we are
[1:52:07] called to be progressing you cannot be
[1:52:10] born again and be here and then from
[1:52:13] then I'll begin to regress that's not
[1:52:15] the kind of God we serve
[1:52:17] it's a God who builds experience upon
[1:52:19] experience and who builds Revelation
[1:52:22] upon Revelation who builds liveliness
[1:52:25] upon liveliness
[1:52:28] no
[1:52:34] the scripture says in the Book of
[1:52:37] Judges chapter 6 I won't read it I was
[1:52:41] going to read it but the 100 we run out
[1:52:43] of time
[1:52:43] he speaks about
[1:52:45] Gideon
[1:52:47] now I want you to realize here
[1:52:50] before your identification comes
[1:52:54] it's the word that's actually giving you
[1:52:57] your identification
[1:52:59] without this message we don't know who
[1:53:02] we are
[1:53:03] we are lost just like the world is lost
[1:53:06] we don't have anything to present we
[1:53:10] have anything to preach without this
[1:53:12] message
[1:53:13] so watch this Gideon he's a coward
[1:53:18] Gideon he's here working in darkness or
[1:53:22] walking under a tree trying to hide the
[1:53:25] seed because the Mennonite came and they
[1:53:27] kept taking the seeds away
[1:53:30] is here scared
[1:53:33] but the angel showed up and says thou
[1:53:37] Mighty Man of Valor
[1:53:41] I'm sure Gideon turned around and said
[1:53:44] I don't think you're addressing to me
[1:53:47] if you knew what I was doing here you
[1:53:49] wouldn't call me a money man or Valor
[1:53:54] thinking right now you wouldn't call me
[1:53:56] a Manny Man or father now we know the
[1:53:58] nation of Israel they had seen against
[1:54:00] God and so God allowed for there for for
[1:54:03] them to be dispossessed of the Grain and
[1:54:05] they came in the trash all the fields
[1:54:07] and all those things it was God allowing
[1:54:09] them but yet he comes in that time where
[1:54:12] they were completely dispossessed and he
[1:54:15] raises a man called Giddy and he calls
[1:54:17] him Mighty Men of Valor
[1:54:21] all right brother
[1:54:23] and if I could
[1:54:25] it speaks again
[1:54:27] of Mary in Luke 1 and 28 it says and the
[1:54:31] angel came to her and say
[1:54:33] hail thou our highly favored
[1:54:38] the Lord is with thee blessed are thou
[1:54:42] among women
[1:54:44] the scripture says and she said unto him
[1:54:49] she said she was troubled and said
[1:54:53] and cast in our mind what manner of
[1:54:57] salutation it should be
[1:55:00] highly favored what have I done
[1:55:03] highly yeah it says Mighty Man of Valor
[1:55:06] now I want you to realize by believing
[1:55:08] what the angel told him by believing
[1:55:11] what the angel told Gideon it brought
[1:55:14] him to be to come the Mighty Men of
[1:55:16] Valor
[1:55:18] by Mary believing what the angel told
[1:55:21] her she became a highly favored and
[1:55:25] produced the son that was supposed to
[1:55:27] come she bear the son now it's supposed
[1:55:30] to come
[1:55:33] now before I say it let me just read it
[1:55:40] but one of them says
[1:55:53] it says
[1:55:57] if the Life of Christ lives in the
[1:56:00] person
[1:56:02] excuse me for a second
[1:56:30] The Life of Christ lives in a person
[1:56:34] they become identified with him
[1:56:38] it's Christ in you
[1:56:41] not a church member
[1:56:43] not a system
[1:56:45] but a resurrected power it's the Holy
[1:56:49] Ghost it's a token upon you
[1:56:53] that your life says Amen to every
[1:56:57] scripture
[1:56:58] the promise is written in there
[1:57:03] think of this
[1:57:05] it says and you are not yourself no more
[1:57:09] you are Christ
[1:57:12] you don't think your own thought you
[1:57:15] don't think you're taught you don't
[1:57:16] think your thoughts
[1:57:18] you say I think I have no thoughts
[1:57:21] coming
[1:57:22] the life that was in Christ is in you
[1:57:26] the mind that was in Christ is in you
[1:57:30] the work that Christ that that was the
[1:57:34] works that was in Christ is in you and
[1:57:38] Christ himself
[1:57:40] is in you
[1:57:42] you are dead your life is hid in God
[1:57:46] through Christ
[1:57:47] sealed in there by the Holy Ghost
[1:57:51] you are not your own
[1:57:56] that's what we are called to identify
[1:57:58] with
[1:58:02] and you probably have heard me read this
[1:58:04] but I will read it anyhow
[1:58:08] it says God is promising his word how
[1:58:11] that he will choose his bride in the
[1:58:14] last day
[1:58:15] did you know that he promised that he
[1:58:18] will do it
[1:58:19] by his original plan of choosing Christ
[1:58:24] of choosing the time choosing the season
[1:58:28] and it can't miss it on his bride
[1:58:32] because she is part of that word
[1:58:37] it says
[1:58:39] he can't choose it by a denomination
[1:58:43] when he didn't choose Christ by
[1:58:45] denomination
[1:58:46] he says did Christ come to a
[1:58:49] denomination did he come by a
[1:58:52] denomination no
[1:58:54] they rejected him
[1:58:56] well that's what the denomination done
[1:58:59] then
[1:59:00] when he chooses a bride can he come any
[1:59:06] other way
[1:59:08] how did how did he bring Christ here
[1:59:12] by the word of the prophets
[1:59:15] I tell you this statement is written in
[1:59:18] my heart they supposed to be things in
[1:59:21] the message when you hear it just brings
[1:59:23] the whole life of you it brings you
[1:59:25] alive it says by the words or for
[1:59:28] prophet he said is that right how will
[1:59:31] he bring his bride here by the word of a
[1:59:34] prophet how did he identify him when he
[1:59:38] came by a man with the spirit of Elijah
[1:59:41] upon him it came out of wilderness how
[1:59:44] will he identify his bride he says he
[1:59:47] promised in malachite for
[1:59:50] the same thing before he destroys the
[1:59:53] Earth like he was in the days of Sodom
[1:59:57] now let me skip some here I'll continue
[2:00:00] here he says
[2:00:02] he says he says it says the word the
[2:00:06] evening message must carry out the
[2:00:08] Evening result the evening message might
[2:00:11] show the evening seed not the morning
[2:00:12] seed evening seed is that right the
[2:00:16] Midway sea the Midway scene it's seed
[2:00:19] back there was the nomination it died
[2:00:22] perished but the evening message will
[2:00:25] show evening time light will show
[2:00:28] evening time results the evening time
[2:00:31] message Jesus time Midway message show
[2:00:34] the Midway result the beginning message
[2:00:37] show the beginning results make creation
[2:00:40] he made his own he he made his son in
[2:00:44] his own image in the Midway in the
[2:00:48] evening time he makes he makes a bride
[2:00:51] for it he says see what by his word
[2:00:56] he says how did he form the Earth how
[2:01:00] did he speak it into existence by his
[2:01:03] word he says how did these how how was
[2:01:07] his son the word in the beginning was
[2:01:10] the word and the Word was with God and
[2:01:12] the Word was made flesh and dwell Among
[2:01:14] Us how will he take his bride by the
[2:01:18] word not by a new card not by some
[2:01:22] Theologian ideas but according to his
[2:01:25] word he will identify her don't put one
[2:01:29] thing or take it away one thing from it
[2:01:32] now live it the way it is he says so now
[2:01:35] here he is he's now showing us what a
[2:01:38] perfect identification is the
[2:01:40] identification is the prophet Messenger
[2:01:43] will come and will speak the word a
[2:01:45] virgin shall conceive and not what will
[2:01:48] travel out through wages and angels and
[2:01:51] it will come and dwell in the womb of
[2:01:53] Mary because she was a Believer and she
[2:01:56] will produce the Son and the word will
[2:01:58] come into manifestation said he said he
[2:02:01] did it the same when he made creation he
[2:02:03] did it when he did Christ and in the end
[2:02:06] time how will the Bride come he will use
[2:02:08] the prophet Messenger to come and speak
[2:02:11] the word not just to identify the wound
[2:02:14] the bride but to bring her into
[2:02:17] existence
[2:02:23] what a privileged people well
[2:02:27] that the Living God
[2:02:29] will come down and it will make himself
[2:02:32] known unto us
[2:02:34] that we could sit at the table and join
[2:02:37] and eat of the seven course meal that we
[2:02:40] will come this morning and say that I am
[2:02:42] a member in fact it says one place that
[2:02:45] I call you no longer church I'll call
[2:02:48] you bride it's specific designation why
[2:02:52] is he identifying you that way
[2:02:54] so you can take your position
[2:03:01] a church is just a church
[2:03:05] but a bride is a different
[2:03:06] identification
[2:03:10] thank you
[2:03:11] you know when you are single and when we
[2:03:13] get married responsibility changes you a
[2:03:18] single man cannot behave like a married
[2:03:19] man or a married man cannot be like a
[2:03:21] single person when you change because of
[2:03:24] the new designation
[2:03:26] your responsibility change the things
[2:03:29] that you do change the way you think
[2:03:31] change the way you walk change why
[2:03:34] because it's of the designation that you
[2:03:36] have received and the word is telling us
[2:03:38] today
[2:03:39] don't walk according to this flesh
[2:03:44] fight it with the spiritual
[2:03:46] representation you've been given stand
[2:03:49] upon the word and let your
[2:03:52] re-identification be a word pace
[2:03:55] don't let it be your own mind your own
[2:03:57] interpretation if God said it
[2:04:00] let him bring it to pass
[2:04:03] let him bring into pass
[2:04:06] if the musician could come this morning
[2:04:10] speaks about the
[2:04:12] young men with amnesia
[2:04:15] who had been the war and with all the
[2:04:18] traumas and everything that he
[2:04:19] experienced
[2:04:21] he became he had an Amnesia and and what
[2:04:24] they would do is they were called family
[2:04:26] members those that can identify and if
[2:04:28] the person can identify something
[2:04:30] they'll take him out and all the others
[2:04:32] they'll put them in an institution
[2:04:34] and they said that they put them on the
[2:04:36] train they were taking them on the way
[2:04:38] to the institution
[2:04:39] and then but then they made a stop
[2:04:41] somewhere so they can take a break and
[2:04:43] and then to let all this young men with
[2:04:46] amnesia out and those young soldiers
[2:04:49] and he said this young man got out of
[2:04:51] the train and
[2:04:53] and all of a sudden he just began to
[2:04:56] wander taking steps away from the others
[2:04:59] and and he began to walk a little Trail
[2:05:01] and they said one man came he was trying
[2:05:04] to bring him in the conductor the the
[2:05:05] men in charge said no don't don't touch
[2:05:07] him just let him go this let's watch him
[2:05:10] he began to take steps and take steps
[2:05:13] and take steps and and all of a sudden
[2:05:15] he met her right and he made a left and
[2:05:17] and it just seemed like he looked
[2:05:20] offense to kind of looked familiar he
[2:05:23] didn't have a way to grasp it but he
[2:05:25] just sounded good to him he just made
[2:05:27] sense to him he couldn't tell you well
[2:05:30] he until that time he didn't even know
[2:05:32] what his name was
[2:05:34] but he continued to follow
[2:05:36] and all of a sudden they saw a water
[2:05:38] tower
[2:05:40] he says wait a minute that that water
[2:05:42] tower means something to me he began to
[2:05:45] walk and he made and he made another
[2:05:47] left and another right and and suddenly
[2:05:50] He Came Upon across this yard and and
[2:05:54] they said the prophet said it says the
[2:05:56] father was there just waiting for him
[2:05:58] and he knew that he had a son and the
[2:06:01] son came and when he looked at him and
[2:06:03] all of a sudden he just clicked he
[2:06:06] recognized oh that's my son and that's
[2:06:08] my father and he came and he hugged them
[2:06:10] and everything taking him in a familiar
[2:06:13] pathway allowed him to come back to who
[2:06:16] is realization of who he really was
[2:06:19] my brother my sister that's what the
[2:06:21] word of God in the end time is doing
[2:06:23] it's just trying to take you right back
[2:06:25] from where you were in the beginning he
[2:06:28] talked to you about justification you
[2:06:30] heard something like you heard before
[2:06:31] you looked at yourself like the boy in
[2:06:33] the mirror you said oh I like some
[2:06:35] justification and he talked about
[2:06:37] scientification you say I want some of
[2:06:39] that and and he talked about the baptism
[2:06:41] of the Holy Ghost and said God I want to
[2:06:43] be baptized and I want to receive what
[2:06:46] I'm saying in the Bible I want to see I
[2:06:49] want to receive what I'm hearing from
[2:06:51] your scripture and all of a sudden you
[2:06:53] get the Holy Ghost it's not about what
[2:06:55] you wanted you come into the realization
[2:06:57] that this is what you always been and
[2:07:00] you are returning back to it
[2:07:04] don't let your identification be how
[2:07:08] much work you have to do to please God
[2:07:10] let your identification be this morning
[2:07:13] that something is calling me in my heart
[2:07:16] I don't understand it I'm just following
[2:07:18] the steps that God is putting in place
[2:07:20] in front of me
[2:07:25] says people read the Bible it says and
[2:07:29] the description of what a Christian
[2:07:31] being he said a Christian should not lie
[2:07:34] a Christian should not do this and
[2:07:36] lesson and they take the Bible and said
[2:07:38] I'm not gonna lie and I'm gonna do this
[2:07:41] today
[2:07:42] you'll end up a failure
[2:07:46] you will end up exactly where you
[2:07:48] started
[2:07:50] but oh let his Spirit come inside of you
[2:07:54] it will first show you the things that
[2:07:57] are in you that you don't want
[2:08:00] and it will start to work on it one by
[2:08:02] one
