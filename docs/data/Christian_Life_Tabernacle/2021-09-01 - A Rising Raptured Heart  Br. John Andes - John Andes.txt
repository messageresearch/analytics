the room as our great physician as the heart surgeon as the doctor that knows all the past history of our lives all the present things that we are going through the future your will for our lives and when you're going to come back for us when the resurrection is going to take place lord tonight we're in your presence and we just want to let off the pressure of our humanness and our lives as people you've made us human but lord tonight we want to press into that unseen realm and may the holy ghost just fall upon each life tonight we welcome you and we give you this service in jesus christ's name amen and the church said god bless you i'm going to let you have your seats just for a moment so nice to see you everyone and and see your faces on a wednesday night hallelujah glory to god usually we're here for special meetings or for sundays and so we're just very happy to be able to come and visit you on a wednesday night service amen sister amber here tonight we're sister amber god bless you sister amber visiting us from tennessee let's give her a welcome tonight sister ambra i want to welcome you [Applause] when i was a young boy and just coming into teenage years i had a little a plaque a little brown plaque that hung on the brown paneling sister leslie of my room i remember it till this day and um just coming into my teenage years and this little plaque said only one life till soon be passed only what's done for christ will last and tonight i just want to say being a christian is the greatest privilege serving the lord jesus is an honor walking in the light of this message and being filled with the holy ghost is the greatest privilege a mortal can have and i'm so thankful here tonight in dallas texas here you are here we are gathered in his precious name that we can know that the lord knows all of us and um you know when i left the state of washington this morning it was 55 degrees and brother brother matthew picked me up it was a hundred degrees here i thought is that incredible in just a few hours it's like i flew to another world but i'm thankful that in the spiritual realm god's just the shank and uh a few weeks ago we were making plans and for our airline ticket to go to north carolina for this weekend ministering saturday and sunday for brother berry coffee and i thought well i was going to leave on thursday i said can we just leave on wednesday and visit the dallas texas church so here we are tonight the lord must pre-plan that and had in his great mind that we would all be together tonight so are we family can i feel at home so i just want to say that i'm here for your your week six week checkup all right the traveling heart doctor is in the heart surgeon i'm not speaking of myself i'm speaking of the lord jesus the heart surgeon that does house calls is doing a heart checkup tonight and this isn't a routine checkup it's very very important we've got a pass and so we were here sunday july the 25th and we spoke a couple services for you i know all the minister brothers weren't here so we just took our liberty and we used the spare tire that weekend do you all remember that and we spoke on the heart of the matters in the morning and then healing for spiritual heart trouble and i'm not going to call this part three but i the lord laid a message on my heart for tonight so that's why we're here we're we're here to do a heart checkup for you that was five and a half weeks ago so if some of you might remember i'm just coming into the subject for tonight we we spoke about spiritual heart trouble and moving from brokenhearted to healing and a new heart and a new spirit god's been promised to give us out of ezekiel 36 that we would receive his spirit and his heart and how many believe the great physician still heals i'm just getting started all right i'm the heart specialist and we put on our glasses and our little gown and i'm just checking to make sure y'all are still alive hey man the great physician heals and um i've even got the binoculars back again do you all remember this you got to look through the binoculars look through god's word we want to see things the way god sees them and this would be like kind of seeing something far away and sometimes we need to do that but tonight i've got another tool we're going to use this is a magnifying glass do you all know what this is well it's it's unusual object but when you're dealing with heart issues and things get kind of delicate you got to get a magnifying glass you got to bring it up a little closer you got to go a little bit down inside of the inside and so i'm not going to use the binoculars tonight is that okay they're going to sit right here but by the grace of god we've got to look a little deeper this is part three of heart surgery and this is the six week checkup so um we're going to take our liberty tonight brother david is is here and he's welcomed us to be able to speak to you i didn't come here to speak i just was wanting to be with you just fellowship a little bit but um if you might remember and you can turn in your bibles to malachi 4 in just a moment we'll stand and read that and then first thessalonians chapter 4 the rapture chapter just a moment we'll we'll have you stand nice to see you sister parks hey man your husband did really good sunday morning with that psalm reading i was tuning in and heard brother parks reading the psalm and speaking about the presence of god and i just thought it was so fantastic do you all think it's fantastic so now sunday night almost six weeks ago we ended the service speaking about a deacon in a church brother johnson's church and a sunday school teacher that he was married to in the church she was the sunday school teacher and the deacon and both of them were living with unconfessed sin and it started to cause heart trouble actually for her it was a mental uh problem panic attacks and things and it affected their relationship it affected their marriage but it affected the church and brother branham said that's why brother johnson couldn't have a revival in his church is because well you have a deacon that's living in sin not just years ago in the war but just three days ago with a woman at his work and so then you have his wife which was the sunday school teacher that had also lived untrue do you all remember this story and so tonight we're going to go a little bit deeper in that because since that service i found something else brother branham said about that case and i actually someone was in a service i was preaching and actually was family to those to that deacon and and uh and that sister and i have their names tonight i'm going to give them to you in just a few minutes but going to the heart of the matter is not always easy and it's a delicate thing when you start talking even on a wednesday night it's going to be more of a sunday morning service i hope you all ready for tonight sometimes it's a little delicate and it's important to be under experienced hands and to have the mind of the great physician to know what he once done in the matter to have his heart and to follow his mind and his will about it so tonight i'd like to speak on a rising raptured heart and we're going to go from brokenness we're going to come from a diseased heart and a troubled heart to now a rising raptured heart and you've got to go through this for the rapture you've got to go through the heart transplant the heart surgery and tonight's a checkup but we've got to pass the examination and so as we stand to our feet and we have prayed to the lord jesus and welcomed him to the service so let's just let him now take take us you know brother brother was speaking to us before the service about how he went in for surgery and it wasn't a nice comfortable bed it actually was a very hard surface and actually chilly cold on his back so sometimes hearing the word isn't always cozy and comfortable but it's exactly what we need i mean when we walk out of here we've got to know that there's been a change a new heart a new spirit a new attitude wouldn't that be great if god would just fill us all tonight just lord bless your word now as we turn to malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6. behold this is god speaking i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children i have a quote right in front of me from the church age book laodicean church age well brother branham said that was fulfilled in the ministry of john john the baptist the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children the spirit of elijah but the last part of this verse here verse 6 he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with the curse that's you and me and brother branham said in in the church age book he said that is yet to take place the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the pentecostal fathers john got the fathers ready for jesus to welcome the children into the fold now this prophet upon whom the spirit of elijah falls will prepare the children to welcome back jesus do you want to be ready for that where our hearts have been turned not our minds but our hearts tonight i'm speaking about a raptured heart we're speaking about this this is the subject for tonight a rising raptured heart so let's turn to first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. real familiar verses i know uh this is the rapture scriptures verses first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 paul not wanting the church to be ignorant i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep they've passed away that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope we do have hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we let's all say we we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent or hinder them which are asleep for the lord verse 16 himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out now this is jesus coming back for his bride verse 16 is a very important scripture for us us tonight speaking about a raptured heart you've got to be able to recognize that we have received a shout of a message the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord there's going to be people that are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord whose hearts have been turned back so they're not backslidden they're not in the world but they're ready to go they they're arise they've arisen they've been quickened because they've received a message i believe i'm looking into some of their faces tonight hallelujah look into the faces of believers and say these are some of the ones that's alive and remain to the coming of the lord their hearts have been turned they've received a new heart the old stony heart was taken away and god put in a new heart that's risen now tonight when you hear these things about the coming of the lord and the rapture and if tonight was our last service or the resurrected saints could be here at any moment does that bring fear to your heart does that bring dread does is there a question mark about where you stand with the lord that's why we have wednesday night services it's just to bring another chat to our lives that we're ready to go and we're willing to be honest we're willing to come into the operating room and just let the great physician do his work and be humble about it be honest and say lord i want to go in the rapture i'm willing to look forward i'm willing to lay aside every weight every sin i want to arise i want to receive this rapturing heart verse 318 wherefore comfort one another with these words it should bring comfort to the church speaking about the rapture god bless you you can have your seats as we speak about a rising raptured heart let me just continue on from the sunday night as we were closing five and a half weeks ago about this man that was in his vehicle he's a deacon of a church the pastor's name was brother johnson his wife is a sunday school teacher of the church and he's driving down his road he's it was before the days of cell phone so he's just about to his house but as he's driving down the road there's a lot of guilt in his conscience there's a lot of guilt in his heart because he's just going back in his mind to what happened years ago in the time of the war when he was just newly married and he had went over to europe and he had committed an act with someone and broke his marriage vow and now he's just carrying that for years even though he's a deacon in the church his wife is a sunday school teacher but you know she's been going through a lot of things lately too in fact financially it's almost ruined their family he she's going to a psychiatrist and it's almost broke their family things aren't right with his wife things aren't right with him he can shake hands with people he consider him he can be kind to the pastor he can be in service his wife can be in service with the little sunday school children but as he's now just pulling into the driveway of his house and puts it in park he's about ready to go inside but then all of a sudden he's overcome again with this guilt of uh what he's gone through and what he's carrying he's a tall man he's got black hair kind of combed over to one side kind of wavy kind of a middle-aged man and he actually works for the chevrolet company and then as he gets out of his vehicle and goes into the house he's just sitting there just kind of pondering these things and all of a sudden you know he just begins to remember not what happened in the war but just about three days ago again the same spirit that it took over him years ago there was a woman that worked in the office and wearing a pink dress and they get into a green chevrolet car this is just three days ago and and he's again caught up in the same act again and he thinks that nobody knows about that and nobody would even know that he has been caught up with it years ago and now three days ago and so he gets into the house and he's just pondering these things and thinking about that and the phone rings at the house and it's his wife and she says i gotta meet you i gotta meet you and he's like what what is there something wrong and i've got to meet you and they make a certain place and and they meet and he gets in his vehicle and drives and meets her in the car and they pull in together and as they're just sitting there in the vehicle she begins to confess of her sin she begins to confess of what happened years ago when she was younger just newly married and lonesome and she when her husband was away and how she had been with a man and uh and the train almost hit them and my and she's just now sitting in the passenger side talking to her husband and confessing that she had been wrong and honey would you forgive me of my sin it caused serious mental and heart trouble in her own life honey would you forgive me would you forgive me of my sin and here's the man sitting on this side hearing all this from his wife knowing what's already on his mind but he's very quick to say i forgive you yes honey i forgive you she's weeping she's repenting and then she continues on and says but honey aren't you also guilty of the same thing years ago when you went over to france and wasn't you with a a woman there and then not just years ago but just three days ago wasn't you with that lady from your work in that green car and she had on a pink dress and and didn't this just happen a few days ago honey and the man is just hearing all this and he's saying like where have you been or how did you know these things he's not denying he's not giving an excuse he's not quick his blood pressure is not just boiling but he just realizes where have you been how do you know these things and he said yes honey all of that is true all of what you said is true years ago when i went to europe i was involved in an act i want you to know i'm sorry about that and it's true honey even though i'm a deacon in the church and we've been serving for years this spirit's been plaguing and tormenting my mind just a three days ago i was involved with the lady at my work the chevrolet company and i'm sorry i'm totally wrong i've been a wrong husband to you and i'm not even worthy to be a husband remember they had three children and he just was thinking about these things and they began to weep and begin to cry together and they both were confessing with tears running down their cheeks and they put their arms around one another after they had confessed the wrong and they cut well what do we do now i mean do we leave one another do we separate is life over no i think we need to go on and serve god together will you forgive me honey yes will you forgive me honey yes let's make this right and put it behind us and go on and serve the lord oh god would you forgive us as they pray together honey what do we do now well i think it'd be good to go back and visit brother branham and visit his house so they go driving back but as this man is now driving back he's already thinking about brother johnson the the pastor of the church and he says my my my he said i'm the deacon of the church now this is something brother john has now heard since i was with you last since our last heart surgery and ending that sunday night this is a quote out of florida that i heard brother brown i'm now actually speaking about this again about this brother because if you remember we closed that service wondering what that man was gonna do what that sister was gonna do should they you know should he step down from his position should she step down you know and put some time into their marriage and maybe sit together on the pew and all this is going through this this man's mind he's he's thinking it's i'm absolutely guilty i'm no good to be called a husband a father of my children or a deacon in that church and as soon as i can get brother johnson i'm going to resign from my job he said how many think that's amazing i'm going to step down as soon as i can get a hold of brother johnson i'm going to resign from my job as soon as brother branham heard that he said don't you do that just get right with god and continue with your job see i said no need of doing that he said oh if god would forgive me i said sure he'd forgive you you confess to your wife and ask her to forgive you you're all forgiven with one another yes i said now sit down now is the time and that's when brother branham when they came back to his house they were weeping and crying and making these things right now brother branham is counseling this brother don't resign from your position he said no need of doing that if god will forgive you sure he forgive you you confess to your wife and ask her to forgive you you all forgive one another now brother branham is praying for the wife that was very very tormented heavenly father this demon that has tormented this girl for all these years and has no legal right to hold her now because it's done been found and made right now come out of her in the name of jesus christ and brother branham says she's perfectly normal and well from that time on can we say praise the lord and i what what a miracle what a testimony of something that happened maybe years ago but i felt to bring it into even this congregation uh almost six weeks ago and then tonight to come back with a follow-up to let you know that most of us probably would have felt that brother needs to resign and maybe the sister needs to resign and but that's not brother branham's counsel to them he said if you've made this right with god and made it right with the other person you need to go on and serve god now how many like to know the rest of the story i was speaking about this just a few days ago in tucson arizona and after the morning service i got a phone call from a brother that was in the morning service he said i'm actually family with that with that man and that woman and uh they've been they've spoken together and been together it was actually a cousin and uh of a grandpa of this very couple the man's name the deacon's name was brother wilbert shane s-h-a-n-e and the sister's name was mary shane that was the sunday school teacher she had a name her name was mary and i wanted to bring this tonight because the brother that was giving me this testimony that been on conversations and actually family of wilbur shane and mary shane not only did this man this deacon stay with his wife and continue to serve in that church but he later pastored that same church and as they gave their hearts back to the lord and repented and went on he pastored that church and he retired when he was 85 years old and he's only died just five years ago one day before he was 100 years old 99 years old here's a man brother wilbur is his name he was the deacon and his wife sister mary that god did a glorious work of restoring their heart and restoring their mental state and bringing their marriage and bringing relationship and bringing the whole church now back where now we can have a revival praise god it's not just brother johnson plowing and wondering what's going on in my church but it's now a deacon is made right the sunday school teacher is made right we can talk about noah and the ark and jesus dying on the cross and daniel and the lion's den but now we got some spirit in it our heart has been restored now we can have someone shaking your hand or or greeting you or maybe praying not with just a mechanical voice but with something inside of him my god is good his goodness has followed me and i have personally experienced god forgiven my life you talk about a changed family those two or three children that they had seeing their mother and father now with one another in tears and being honest and now coming back from brother branham's home that demon spirit that had tormented her it was gone now that guilt over that deacon that had just been wondering how i should handle this it was totally gone they they could be free now and i pray now as we bring this back to this church service tonight that if there's anyone that has had something happen in your past or something happened in your life that god would be speaking to you tonight in this heart examination time it's time for a rapture if there ever was a time we needed to be honest and open with the lord and with one another it's now and let the lord do a rising a raptured heart is a heart that's been turned back to god that's why we read malachi chapter 4 and maybe you can put that oh brother parks you're back there in the booth tonight god bless you nice to see you tonight malachi chapter 4 verse 5 again maybe you'd like to turn there into the bible as we move now into another gear continuing on in the service do you appreciate the message of the hour we could just stop right there and say thank the lord for a message that restores people back to their ut to be conditioned doesn't just condemn them neither does it just compromise but it actually puts it under the blood and god can't even find that there was a senior pastor of this message if you if we just put that on the screen a few weeks ago we were fellowshipping about this and there was people in his church that was actually bringing accusations about one of their deacons and some of his past life and they were trying to bring up with this deacon's done this thing and that thing and surely they must be disqualified from being a deacon and this pastor was very troubled because it was his deacon i trust this is okay tonight i'm a visiting traveling heart surgeon but by the grace of god this very quote that i read to you out of florida about brother johnson's church and this deacon this pastor happened to come upon it and it totally changed the whole situation when he saw brother branham's attitude and how he applied the word of god to a deacon that had been in sin not just years ago but a few days ago and how he had actually brother branham counseled the brother to continue on you've made this right with god you've made this right with your wife continue to serve and continue to go on with god and also the sunday school teacher he brother branham did not counsel her to sit down for six months and you know we need to just kind of watch her behavior and see if she's gonna have church order and if she's gonna follow her husband we kind of need to watch that couple that's not how brother branham dealt with the situation but immediately he cast off that evil spirit and i believe it was under the blood and this pastor when he brought that quote to the people it dissolved the whole situation because he could see how a prophet had actually applied the word of god that if god can't see that sin if it's under the blood if you've made that right with the other person then it's no longer even in god's mind then who are you or who am i to be bringing up those sins there could be a lot of questions and i leave this to the sovereignty of a local church and a pastor how they handle their church but i'm i'm speaking from the message of the hour how did brother branham handle these things what did he say about certain things and i think it's good to know tonight we have an absolute we have an anchor and it's it's malachi 4 5. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord verse 6 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart let's all say heart it's the heart of the matter the heart of the children to their fathers can i ask you tonight are you fulfilling this part of malachi 4 verse 6 where you would say i am a child of this end time whose heart has been turned back because every single believer that goes in the rapture will have that for a testimony my heart has been turned back i've received a new heart i've received a new spirit i received his heart i received his spirit there's got to come a generation that even on a wednesday night no matter how you feel you are the word made manifest hallelujah there's got to be enough power and blood to wipe away our complexes and wipe away our past life and if the blood of jesus you just sang about it if the blood of jesus is not rich enough and powerful enough to take away our sins there's no power that's greater than god's power but you've got to believe it you've got to finally anchor your faith and stop putting it back on yourself or putting it back on your spouse or putting it back on your father or your mother or something in your past or another minister you've got to say i'm fulfilling malachi 4 6 whose hearts are going to be turned back hello believers are you rugged believers tonight this isn't for the childish and just for the immature these are for believers that put their eagle talons down in the word and say that is my absolute now first thessalonians chapter 4. we've got to go back there as we go now deeper into this message this is the rapture where brother john is speaking about tonight a rising raptured heart i'm going to bring you out of dallas texas and out of this local politics and culture and the weather 100 degrees today i'm trying to bring your mind up to a spiritual realm that we've got to live in a in a rising raptured heart that there is a global revival going on right now i think this church has been partakers of that even as of just even uh some months ago in the sweep of god through your assembly and it's happening in other states and in other countries where there are moves of god it's a sovereign move of god it's god answering his word that there has to be a generation whether you're young or whether you're old that you are going to manifest the rapture and the rapture is arising it's coming higher it's moving further than you have ever been before can i challenge you with that tonight lord take me further than i've ever been before this happened to me last week i began to just meditate on this lord take me to places that i've never even been before and i've been born and raised in this message but friends it's more than just regurgitating the same quote the same scriptures brother adam said the bible said quoting and putting it on the screen it's got to be where the holy ghost begins to strike a person and they know him do you know him tonight i'm i'm now taking the stethoscope and i'm looking deeper into your heart do you know him this church has been taught very good by your pastor and your ministry there are going to be people that come to him at that day and say lord lord haven't we done these things and oh the foolish virgin they they thought they had oil before we had or our lamps have gone out and we want the oil we want the holy ghost and they went to go and and they never got it the scripture never says that they got it they come back later knocking on the door and they say oh i don't even know you that's the foolish virgin that didn't have oil on their lamps that's not your type when i speak about arising and coming higher if you read matthew 25 the bible says they all slumbered and slept is that right i preached a whole message on this sunday but i'm not going to do that tonight to you but they all slumbered and slept means the wise virgins there was a season when they slumbered and they slept but then there came a word and a message saying that behold the bridegroom cometh behold your bridegroom is here and you were awakened you arose you you left your lane down and your dormant and your backslidden and your the way you thought in the world or the way you thought in denominations friend don't bring denominations into this message and expect us to bow down to your past belief system friends there's got to be a whole new heart given to you a whole new spirit a whole new appetite a whole new love i say god give us to that tonight friends this message has got to go beyond your intellect you'll never figure it out you'll never be smart enough you'll you'll never know where everything fits by that age you'll probably start losing your mind and you'll forget about where it went and what box it was in and you'll start mispronouncing and saying that it just happens we're all getting older brother john's getting older you're getting older and you don't like to hear that oh i'm not getting older oh i'm i'm strong we can do this no it's not by might nor by power it's by the holy spirit even tonight you know friends we're here on a wednesday but if we all were given a new heart and a new spirit and something stony something worldly taken away a a spirit that's laying there dormant maybe for years now i'm bringing it up to september the 1st 2021 we need the same spirit of god that was in that private counseling session with william branham to be in this service tonight i'm going to say it again the the bride is hungry and thirsty that's why i said that it's delicate when we start taking these issues and really going down to the heart of the matter there's a lot of people that go like this and they start you know quivering it's just that same we're all in the flesh whether you're spiritual carnal we're all in the flesh we we got flesh but there's a spiritual part of us that we need to tap into and when you hear the word something begins to quiver something begins to move haven't you recognized that's the holy spirit so i'm going down to this part of the matter tonight and when i look at y'all like this you're all blurry because i'm not using these now i'm not focusing in on how you're dressed and and your hair i'm now coming down to the heart of the matter we remember last time we spoke about how long it takes for a heart surgery does anybody remember come on six weeks ago excellent brother jackson it can take between three and six hours for heart surgery so sunday morning sunday night wednesday night we're about close to six hours but by the time we finally get it by the time we finally get to the place that god uncovers all our our skin our sinew and pulls back and starts dealing with the heart of the matter it's not just well just take a little pill god bless you brother oh you played good tonight oh you're a nice deacon in our church you're a nice sunday school teacher they had tried that for years heavenly father we need our church services to be with the same intensity as when brother branham sat in front of a sister that was tormented and had trouble there has to be a burden in the church for those days to end that we just continue having services and it's never deals with the heart of the issue now when you look at first thessalonians 4 16 the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then these things should already be happening as he descends in the rapture message december the 4th 1965 i was just in arizona this is yuma arizona brother branham said the word rapture and the bible is not even used at all we put that word in there but the bible says caught up being caught up and he and he's quoting out of first thessalonians here the order of the great rapture and he reads that down that we read in verse 13 14 15 verse 16 verse 17 can you put verse 17 up then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together he's talking about the rapture [Music] before that great catching away there has to be a catching up and a rising up now or you'll never have that rapture if you don't receive this appearing brother branham's just described giving this the word of god don't you just love a prophet you're not going to hear this in the denomination you're going to hear this out of the dallas globe or off your little cell phone device or wherever you get your media feed or whatever off of instagram we have heard thus sayeth the lord that the lord himself is going to descend he said there's three things that is to happen before the lord himself appears a shout a voice and a trumpet has to happen before jesus appears jesus does all three of them when he's descending are we together tonight this isn't too deep but we are going deep enough to let you know that the shout has already happened he's already done these as he's descending i'm quoting out of the rapture message shout voice trumpet has to happen before jesus appears he does all three of them while he's descending a shout it's the message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride come out of her my people come out of the world come out of your nonsense come out of your busyness we need to preach this and message churches on september 1st come out of your busyness you that are hanging down to the things of this world sports fashion finances politics afghanistan whatever that's holding you down we need to feed off of a message that is to call us together and bring forth the bride arise bride where are you sons of the gospel sons of the message where are you daughters of the cross where are you tonight where are you young men middle age older brothers where your heart has been turned back and your vigorous strong like caleb that can say i'm stronger now than i was years ago but god is working with some of our younger ones in middle age the same experience you had he's trying to awaken them to a rise up i tell you friends it's not an easy age to be living in uh i'm preaching a sunday morning message on a wednesday night it's very difficult to cut through all the unbelief of laodicea and all the things of this world we're so tapped into school and university and jobs but in the midst of all of that the bride is rising i see you rising i see you sister coming out of that depression coming out of that trouble coming out of that heart trouble that you're in i see you brother arising and the questions and the inability to be honest with your wife or be honest with your children you've got to arise god's given you strength and courage that your life isn't over your ministry isn't over your service to the lord isn't over i'm breathing you hope tonight come on friends we ought to be mature enough that if this is for one person in your church you ought to be said oh god give a resurrection and a rising it took a deacon to be dealt with and a sunday school teacher to bring revival back to brother johnson's church does this church want a real revival to continue then there's got to be a laying aside of all our unbelief all the sin all the remember the number one heart disease in america what is it it's sin disease what's the number one killer remember you can google it and the world will tell you it's heart disease but brother branham said it's not true the number one killer is sin disease it's very simple sin unbelief not believing just not taking the word and and believing it oh god how many believe the perfect word has come no i'm in my examination part of tonight amen how are you all doing tonight how are y'all doing tonight has the perfect word come then there ought to be a perfect faith if malachi 4 5 has come and a spirit of elijah's come with a rapturing message then where is the generation that's going to feed off of that message and have their heart literally turned back i'm asking you tonight where are you tonight you say well here i am i've been here well maybe god's calling one of your children one of your teenagers maybe your wife or husband the lights are just coming on tonight maybe tonight the key is in the lock of something you say oh we've heard that before well somebody else is maybe hearing it for the first time and the key is turning in the lock and the tumblers are working and something's moving inside of them that's the holy ghost it's like a magnet moving across but if a deacon and a sunday school teacher supposed to be mature in the word and down the road could be actually dealing with those type of issues cannot our children or our young people or a new convert be struggling i'm asking a question examination time someone has trouble someone has a heart issue someone has a and they're an older person they're somebody that should know better then is it even more where satan is trying to run rampant and cause spiritual cancer and choking out the hearts of god's people but god right at the end time is doing a great awakening and arising and coming out of her my people now it's time to go into because you can come out of but you've got to go in too god can take a stoney heart out of you but you've got to receive a new heart friends we need to re be feeding off the word more than ever are we doing okay tonight a shout is the message going forth a messenger getting the people ready the second is the voice of the resurrection the same voice a loud voice that in john saint john 11 that called lazarus from the grave my my the voice of the resurrection speak in your name not john mary sue and brother branham said not ormond neville you can hear him right on the tape it's not your name like that it's it's preaching the word and that's your representation and you grab ahold of that and say that is mine that is mine i am that generation i am those ones whose hearts are going to be turned back let me tell you what tonight how many believe in miracles how many would like to see a miracle just look around the room a little bit don't look at me i'm a miracle too but look around the room some of you can look around the room amen we are miracles to even have a desire for god in this wicked age you are a walking living breathing and you ought to thank god for that desire who gave you that heart who gives you that desire who gives you that kind of spirit who gives you that kind of of love for the things of god why are you here tonight why is he appearing to us in these meetings for it's to awaken our desires it's that when he speaks to us and awakens these desires that the atmosphere could just be right and something dropped down there into that predestinated seed maybe we ought to just bow our heads and say lord forgive us of our sin forgive us of our unbelief if there's any sin in our church take it away lord maybe you were too busy maybe you came in late or maybe you came in driving on the stress of these dallas roads and maybe from and tonight and but tonight you could just say lord forgive me of any sin in my life can we all do that right now i'm continuing on with the examination lord if there's anything in my heart that's evil take it away if there's anything that's not right take it away reveal it to me lord give me a sensitive heart lord let the voice of the resurrection speak among us and let there be the trump of god the sound of a trumpet which brother bradham said as a calling together come to the feasts it's the lamb's supper in the sky and assembling together the bride the feast of the trumpets the wedding supper we've all heard it over the years but i believe it's time to arise i i was just in another state and it was so wonderful to have a song leader actually song leading and leading the congregation in worship his own father and mother left the message actually went on you know these websites and facebook and actually our anti-message and anti-brother branham i think it's just a a wonderful testimony that god would raise up a young man that's married and has children to be a testimony to the world that i'm not going to be like my daddy i'm not going to be like my mommy god's given me a personal testimony that this message is thus saith the lord i say god give us more young people like that you're not going to get into heaven off your mom and dad's coat tales and oh my daddy's a preacher my mom is this and or are they a good person maybe they're not a good person maybe your friend is not serving the lord maybe you are being influenced in a you're going down you don't have to go down this is an ascending message this is a rising friends i would let that thing go and i would grab ahold of the spirit of god that's saying let's arise it's time to go i have his name in front of me but i'm not going to give it publicly but i thought my it's so wonderful to have a brother that can be stronger and bigger than family ties blood ties and be able to rise up and say no daddy mommy i love you but i love the lord jesus and i'm raising my family and the fear and admonition of the lord sounds like the sons of korah sounds like the children of korah which i also preached on that sunday night i'm not going to get into it but there were 11 psalms that were written in the psalms that you can read that were written for the psalm for the sons of korah wonderful wonderful david caught that inspiration how many has ever heard of the korites amen they were acting second chronicles can you just put that up second chronicles chapter 20 verse 19. this is years later years later after the bible says in numbers that not withstanding the children of korah died not this is second chronicles 20 verse 19 and the levites of the children of the koa heights and of the children of the korites stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high they could have lived their whole lives saying who's your daddy who is the father of your tribe korah oh that's horrible dathan and the byram and all these horrible things but no years later after they were swallowed up in the book of numbers you find a whole a group of a tribe of the koaheitz and the korites stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice their testimony went on for years in the message that we didn't stand with our father when he got swallowed up okay maybe you all need to have that in front of you numbers chapter 26 verse 10. well let's start at verse 9 numbers 26 verse 9. can we speak about this i see some of you haven't heard this before numbers 26 verse 9 and the sons of eliab nemiel and dathan and abyram this is that dayton and abyram which were famous in the congregation who strove against moses and against aaron and the company of korah when they strove against the lord verse 10 and the earth opened up her mouth and swallowed them up together with korah when that that company died what time the fire devoured 250 men and they became a sign verse 11 our next verse notwithstanding the children of korah died not hallelujah there were sons there were young people there were people that were looking at their dad being swallowed being being other young people and grandmas and uncles and being swallowed up we've seen them being swallowed up over the years song leaders deacons preachers people and maybe your church but there were a group as a generation standing right there saying i'm not going to go down with those i'm believing i'm going to stand with moses was a type of the prophet i'm going to stand with aaron which is a type of the ministry i'm going all the way with christ i'm looking at you in dallas tonight saying where are you sons and daughters that those things around you might be getting swallowed up by the world your eyes are looking up to him and years later in second chronicle chronicles you could find of the levites and of the children of the core heights children of the korites they stood up to praise the lord of god of israel with a loud voice they were not ashamed they said let my voice ring with those that are praising shouting rejoicing on a wednesday night i'm gonna put my voices with the believers friends we might be ridiculed out there we might be talked about out there website social media your friends your boss whatever might look down on you but amongst the believers there ought to be arising there ought to be a rapture there ought to be when i'm with you there ought to be enough energy coming back and forth see your minds might not understand everything but god has given you a heart he knows everything friends how's your heart tonight because out of your heart is coming all the issues of life he's beautiful for situation now i'm going back to our opening scripture six weeks ago he's beautiful for situation but now after bringing that quote to you about our brother oh just get his name right brother shane and sister shane and the goodness of god to their family i can say tonight the goodness of god is so great the riches of the goodness of god oh tonight i would encourage you to take the hand of someone and let him lead you to the place you need to go and that's not brother john that's not any minister that is the lord jesus christ take the hand of god and let him lead you to the place where you ought to go that's the great physician that is the healer is in the house that is the doctor that does personal house calls brother branham talked about those doctors and they'd go through rivers and go through streams it'd be rain and snowing and they'd go to to the houses of people that were needy is that true though it's a real doctor not just fellowshipping with the homes of everybody's healthy everybody's good everybody's patting me on the back sometimes we need to break out of our comfort zone i don't know who the lord's talking to you need to break out of your comfort zone and visit someone in the church that's needy you need to break out of your realm of just being with your friends and realized friends friends if we can't win our friends and those that we know for the lord then there's no way we're going to win someone in the world lord let our hearts be turned back to you we are in the last laps of the race my my precious friends are you discouraged tonight are you weary may god comfort you you might have come in with huge issues and huge troubles say my problem is very very special no there's been literally millions and billions of people throughout the years there's nothing new under the sun it's satan just cycling people through his death death concentration camps and you need to rise up and say i'm not going to be a statistic i'm not going to be another number and i really feel tonight to say this very strongly i'll be leaving in a few hours tomorrow what more could god do for you what more could god do for dallas now i'm speaking very clearly as a heart surgeon you've received a prophet you have a pastor you have evangelists you have teachers you have apostles i'm really being serious tonight what more is it going to take to get your attention [Music] what more can god do for you you've been to conventions you've been to camps you've had special services i'm being honest some of us are so spoiled we're spoiled so rotten we take everything for granted especially in america it's burnt over so many times and we need to say god give me a new heart give me a give me a fresh heart lord renew my love renew my passion give me feeling back again sometimes we lose our natural feeling our affection even for one another people that we ought to love the most now i'm just about starting to preach and it's time to end the things we ought to love the most we start to disdain we take it for granted we don't appreciate it we don't we're not thankful we're not grateful it's a sign of this age and it's going down this world is falling apart but in the midst of that chaos is a rising is a is an ascending is a is a rapture and that's what i came here for on this wednesday night is to remind you on the six-week look check-up for your heart make sure your heart is right i don't care if you drove here in a lamborghini alexis porsche rode a bicycle rode a horse or walked here or came on crutches you got here we are hearing the last messages before the resurrection of the saints we have heard a shout out we're we've been under the influence of the voice of the resurrection for years and some of you still think the trumpet of god is [Music] it's all part of a calling it's all part of god getting your attention that all happens before we see him in the sky there's got to be a people that are awake they're aroused watchy therefore have your lamps trimmed make sure there's oil in the lamp i'm just going to say it again brother jackson what more do we need to have as a church to get our attention it was last time we were here in the afternoon there was a man met me at the restaurant going out the door and he's talked about a a certain lady who had a certain heart born with a hole in her heart age four they found it and they stitched it up but she had gotten older through her teenage years and then into her 50s it almost killed her with scars there were scars on her heart and they did another heart surgery and they put in a pacemaker a heart defibrillator and her heartbeat is connected to her cell phone and even the doctors at the hospital and at the doctor's office every so often they have to do check-ups and updates and maintenance and a tune-up and the very words of this man to me was she can feel that i got the notes right here i'm not going off a memory because i can't remember hardly six weeks ago but if that happens in the natural that a person can receive another heart and receive a defibrillator and something happened when i was four years older i had a murmuring heart or i had an issue in my life and there's been scars brother john but years down the road you can be connected to another that has knowledge and has understanding that's why brother branham would preach lean not to your own understanding and they said every so often they have to do check-ups and updates and maintenance and they do a tune-up on her heart and she can feel that friends if we lose the feeling of what we believe we have lost christ in our midst in the old testament they called it ichabod it means christ walked out of the room you can name it claim it and whatever you want but if christ leaves the room chaos follows god put some feeling back in my heart again you're doing a checkup you're doing a tune-up then we got to feel it later on that same week we went on down and saw brother tim pruitt and sister karen pruitt with brother donny reagan and brother ron spencer and the brothers and then we came back and on friday morning was with some of your brothers in the church having a bible study and we talked to one another about the brokenhearted out of isaiah and luke when jesus took the scroll and and he began to read there that i've come to bind up those with the brokenhearted that only confirms that it's possible to have a broken heart and bro and brother branham said jesus died of a broken heart so if that was true in the male part is it possible that the bride have a broken heart but god's not going to leave you there receive a new heart receive the heart of god they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength just lift up your hands and thank the lord right now just just praise the lord for giving you a heart giving you a desire giving you something that would yearn so we have accepted the diagnosis of the doctor stop being in denial stop constantly pushing it back and not being truthful if you go that way friends you're going to continue to die and things will unravel spiritually you've got to take the prescription of the word when god reveals the condition you've got to walk in your healing and sometimes it gets very sensitive and very delicate but somebody's got to say it god anoint someone to say it there was a lady i just heard yesterday holy spirit was dealing with her heart to go to the doctor and get a checkup she's young she's vibrant i'm saying this in closing she's very healthy person just heard this yesterday something just witnessed in her heart you need to go to the doctor and get a checkup oh no i don't need a checkup i'm nothing's wrong i'm healthy and young she she followed that voice that still small voice she got the checkup and they went in there and they found a malignant tumor a cyst in her body and the doctor was able to go in and cut that out and in the doctor's words they said you better be thankful you came in because if that would have lingered in your body for another season of time and they mentioned it how long it could have been fatal to your life and she's rejoicing she's thanking the lord she's she's so mindful it's not medicine it's not doctors it's not the hospital he's my healer but the holy spirit has a vision for your life and it's not for death it's for life i'm preaching hope tonight to you i minister in faith to you receive the word of god what satan means for evil to destroy you the great physician is saying i'm here to give you more life it's time to arise time to ascend it's time to heed the voice of god like you like you've never had before he the still small voice of god it's time to go home it's it's time to welcome the resurrected saints and comfort one another with these words be united with christ receive the heart of god let god fill you tonight to overflowing in jesus name let's stand to our feet [Applause] heavenly father as our musicians come and our pastor comes we pray for every single individual every sheep of your pasture every predestinated seed that they would come to their place that you would encourage them that you would move them quickly in a short quick work lord we don't believe you're going to lose one and we believe you're in the wrap-up time you're in the final climax we are in the final stages of the last lap we are running down as it was our last time in the end of the marathon and the ages are calling to us from the grandstands stay steady stay faithful heavenly father i pray as the musicians play and the atmosphere of the holy spirit is bringing a conclusion to this checkup [Music] i pray for every single person would you translate this into the african language into the spanish language into the english into the language of the heart don't let one [Music] person that calls this their church home fail miss the mark fall short but may we rise from our summer rise from our sleep have the oil so grateful for the oil so grateful for the holy spirit i believe you'll lead and guide your people right up to the end how many would say lord you know the things in my heart right now i just pray you take those things if you have need of a miracle you have need of a healing you have need of a great physician you have need of a supernatural [Music] when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of christ [Music] brother branham said that in the seventh seal he said when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of christ father take our lives tonight [Music] you that spoke the world and the galaxies and the creator you're doing the same thing again in this generation restoring to us all the years that the cankerworm palmer worm locust those things tried to eat away but you are restoring all things restore us back lord jesus bring us back to our eden beauty again to our faith where our love our patience our virtue cap off our lives with yourself coming down i wonder if you could say that yourself tonight lord cap off my life cap off my experience bring in the last one bring in the last sheep lord get your waiting right away we bow our hearts we power our hearts [Music] lord [Music] give us [Music] give us [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] let's sing that first verse again and you know our nature it just seems like john was in our service with us sunday night our first nature is i'm going to go make all this right [Music] you'll find yourself in the same place 40 years later [Music] as i testify to you sunday things that i tried to fix with the mechanics for 50 years one day i realized i can't fix it [Music] but there's a spirit there's a quickening power that goes beyond anything that we can do and it it's so easy you just ask [Music] he says come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i'll give you rest in no wise will i turn you away amen so if he spoke to your heart tonight and as he did mine i thought those words were so beautiful that brother branham said just make it right and go on you can't drive looking in the rear view mirror amen there comes a time you have to leave those things which are behind behind and press for the higher calling but i think what our brother's saying so much is that when you examine yourself you find out that the only thing that's missing is him and we let him into lots of places i'm sure those brother and sister they serve god many a good day they did a lot of great things for the kingdom of god but there comes that time that it becomes personal where i want that real personal touch from the lord and you can't do anything to get it but just surrender and invite them in and i don't care if you're in the back tonight or in the four year [Music] in here on this platform wherever it is our answer is to get face to face [Music] and that's all that we can do so for a moment as we sing this course again don't go back and meditate on all the things and how that you're sorry and how that you want to make it right just take a moment and look in his face and say lord you know all these things already i want to invite you in to every aspect of my life i'm asking your spirit to come into my body and bring this whole body into subjection to your word if the spirit that raised you from the dead would come dwell in me it would quicken this mortal body the one that i live in the one that i sin in it would transform not only my heart but this very life body that i'm in lord and that's what i need it's what i need lord it's what i want lord i can't make a step without you but with you lord i can overcome anything and make it personal tonight don't go and say i'm going to go home and give this up i'm not going to play this game again i'm never going to watch that program again i'm going to go throw the cd out of the car you let him apply the token amen let him come in here first and all those things will become easy to do they'll become so easy to do [Music] so bow your heart [Music] bend your knees ask the spirit to come turn your eyes from evil and turn them to the lord [Music] and watch what god will do for you there'll be a transformation in you that you on the can't hardly comprehend it was possible let's sing once more let the spirit just slowly move through our hearts tonight after this wonderful word amen help me sing it [Music] from [Music] give us [Music] give us [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh god let us see [Music] oh [Music] [Music] that [Music] depend on [Music] oh beholder [Music] oh [Music] [Music] tears [Music] [Music] is [Music] is amen [Music] brother craig desires to be baptized you know the great scripture that was spoken that the lord said go on to all the world baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost but the one things that the disciples had is they knew who he was they knew the father because the scripture said have no other gods before me they knew the father and by divine revelation they knew that jesus was his son and he the scripture said that he came in the father's name so they knew who he was so when they said go baptize in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost knowing who he was they knew what the name was that's why peter on the day said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ having the keys and we'll read our baptismal scripture if the brothers we go get ready brother jackson taber craig get ready and we'll have a baptism those of you that have to go maybe you have to be there early for work or or something like that feel free to go those that would like to remain and fellowship and the baptism of our our our brother we certainly do this let us read our scriptures as we prepare it says in the acts the second chapter and the 36th verse it says therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and for this promise is unto you and to your children and to all them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did they testify and exhort saying save yourself from this up towards generation amen wasn't that the word to us tonight save yourself from this mess that's out here there's no hope left our only hope is in jesus christ and his righteousness he's here for you you're not hiding anything he already knows the
