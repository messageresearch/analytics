[39:16] made known unto us the mystery get the
[39:19] Holy Spirit on you sometime and start
[39:21] running that and just watch how it goes
[39:25] well I want that
[39:28] you know we we don't want to just let
[39:30] that slip right over the prophet of God
[39:32] is saying get the Holy Spirit on you
[39:34] sometime and start running that and just
[39:36] watch how it goes this afternoon oh I
[39:38] had oh about 30 minutes to study just to
[39:41] look the lesson over maybe not that I'll
[39:43] say uh half of that 15 minutes between
[39:46] uh the times and I got to running and I
[39:48] thought the mystery how mysterious and
[39:52] the scripture packed me back into the
[39:55] Old Testament and then back over into
[39:58] the New Testament I want to say he
[39:59] wasn't in time no
[40:01] more isn't that wonderful he said oh I I
[40:04] only had about 15 minutes but when you
[40:05] get in the presence of God I want to say
[40:07] uh time is no more everything stands
[40:10] still and he says the in the scripture
[40:12] packed me back into the Old Testament
[40:14] then back over in the New Testament tied
[40:16] something together see the mystery of
[40:19] his coming the mystery of his will the
[40:22] mystery of us sitting together I I like
[40:26] this now now we're just we'll just go as
[40:28] long as you pull uh remember it cannot
[40:31] be taught in any Seminary it's a mystery
[40:33] you cannot uh uh you cannot know it by
[40:36] education by theology it's a mystery
[40:40] that's been hid before the foundation of
[40:42] the world waiting for the manifestation
[40:45] of the sons of God I mean I tell you
[40:47] that's just a powerful quote there the
[40:50] mystery of his
[40:52] will the mystery of his coming and the
[40:56] mystery of us sitting together I believe
[40:59] that's all tied together we're living in
[41:01] the hour of the mystery of his will the
[41:03] mystery of his coming and that mystery
[41:06] is us sitting together there there's
[41:09] something that God wants us to know
[41:11] about that and and my I I just just
[41:14] wanting to surrender to the Holy Spirit
[41:16] as uh we were closing out this morning's
[41:18] service and and we were praying that
[41:20] just uh as we were saying the closing
[41:23] prayer I just felt these words uh just
[41:25] came on to my heart I I didn't know why
[41:28] but it said uh just look on
[41:31] this look on this and and that was just
[41:34] the most recent thing I I remember um
[41:37] the the the still small voice saying to
[41:39] me and then uh when we were asked to
[41:41] minister tonight the the only platform
[41:43] or the only thing I could think of was
[41:45] what the Lord just spoke in my heart
[41:46] look on this so we're we're going to
[41:49] find out what we're looking at or what
[41:50] we're going to look on or look at this
[41:52] or what the Holy Spirit uh would have us
[41:54] look at but you know there's we could go
[41:56] into many messages and and the prophet
[41:58] would talk about Look Away to Jesus or
[42:01] he would speak other services and
[42:03] expectation and things and it say it
[42:04] depends on what you're looking at you
[42:07] know and I and I would say the same
[42:09] thing this evening when he says look on
[42:11] this you know there's a lot of things to
[42:12] look at today and I would tell you we're
[42:15] living in Satan's Eden where the devil's
[42:17] doing his best to get you to look at the
[42:19] things that he has to offer to get you
[42:21] to look at Satan's Eden to get you to
[42:22] look at all of his devices and all the
[42:24] things that he has to offer and my I
[42:26] tell you it's there there's I I guess
[42:29] you couldn't exhaust it all whatever you
[42:31] want to get involved in whatever
[42:32] information and whatever entertainment
[42:34] and whatever games and everything my and
[42:37] all the advertisements and everything
[42:39] Satan's Eden has to throw at you I tell
[42:41] you there's a lot out there and I and I
[42:43] wouldn't doubt that that you you you uh
[42:45] you couldn't even digest or consume at
[42:47] all you hear people talking about if
[42:49] you're not careful you get online and
[42:51] all a sudden you get trapped in a rabbit
[42:53] hole and you're you're way down in this
[42:54] hole you're like how did I get down down
[42:56] here on the back side of the internet
[42:57] why am I even watching this you thought
[42:59] you were going to watch something funny
[43:01] and now you're watching something that's
[43:02] not funny and you you feel defiled and
[43:04] you're back looking on things you
[43:06] shouldn't be looking at like we
[43:08] shouldn't be living like that we want to
[43:09] be living in his presence we want to be
[43:11] living in the shakina of Glory we want
[43:13] to go in behind the veil we want to be
[43:16] able to enter into his presence where
[43:18] we're eating uh uh the the hidden Mana
[43:21] right uh we want to be feeding on that
[43:23] and if you're feeding on that in his
[43:25] presence we could just break out onto
[43:27] that and brother brandom talk about how
[43:29] there's people that are that are outside
[43:31] of the holiest of holies and they're
[43:34] eating the Mana but since they're not in
[43:36] the Holy Place eating the Mana that
[43:39] Feast is running out it says there's two
[43:41] types of people they're both eating the
[43:43] same thing they're both digesting the
[43:45] same Mana but but one's Feast is running
[43:47] out one it's not producing a life they
[43:49] just have an education they just have a
[43:51] knowledge they just have an
[43:53] understanding of the message but there
[43:54] is a people that is has gone in behind
[43:57] the veil into the presence of almighty
[43:59] God and that Mana will never run out
[44:02] that Mana will never rot because you're
[44:04] you're feeding on the hidden things of
[44:06] God and we're living in the hour where
[44:08] now our fellowship is on the mystery of
[44:11] God oh how mysterious is this
[44:16] mystery but talk about a
[44:19] fellowship talk about a fellowship we're
[44:22] fellowshipping on the hidden things that
[44:24] were hidden in the back of God's mind
[44:27] before the foundation of the world but
[44:29] God has now made them known to you and I
[44:32] oh what a fellowship we have that's why
[44:34] this is such a Brotherhood that that's
[44:35] why we have brothers and sisters around
[44:37] the world with with such a love and a
[44:39] Zeal because your eyes have been opened
[44:43] you've heard the shout you've heard the
[44:44] message of the hour oh it goes beyond
[44:47] the theology oh if we can just get the
[44:49] life of the message within us if we
[44:53] could just be feeding on the secret
[44:54] things of God I want to be be different
[44:56] I want to be changed I I want to know
[44:59] what he's talking about I want him to
[45:00] tie these these things together in my
[45:02] life what is the mystery of his coming
[45:05] what is the mystery of his what is the
[45:07] mystery of us sitting together and I'm
[45:10] just by God's grace maybe we'll say
[45:12] something that can stir up your minds to
[45:14] remembrance something that'll get you
[45:16] hungry for the word of God oh there's so
[45:19] much more to this message we haven't
[45:20] even scratched the surface don't you
[45:23] realize it's an inexhaustible
[45:27] Fountain where we get ourselves in
[45:29] trouble is when we make it Creeds and
[45:31] dogmas and intellectual and religion and
[45:34] we we we all just we got a little group
[45:36] over here and this is what we believe
[45:38] it's so much beyond that and there's so
[45:40] much more don't you realize it's going
[45:42] to take Eternity for God to unfold
[45:44] himself to us eternity we can't even com
[45:47] what do you mean it'll take eternity to
[45:48] unfold himself we can't even be we can't
[45:51] even comprehend it scripture says it has
[45:53] not even entered in the hearts and minds
[45:55] of comms the things that he has prepared
[45:57] for us but God hath revealed them to us
[46:00] by his Spirit I'm so glad that God by
[46:04] Divine promise has come in this day to
[46:06] reveal those things to
[46:08] us the fellowship the hidden Mystery so
[46:12] just trying to be faithful to the little
[46:14] word that uh uh God put on my heart just
[46:17] uh look on this we would have to maybe
[46:20] uh jump into uh into uh S as this the
[46:23] end time and and and uh
[46:27] that that's actually comes from a dream
[46:29] that Junior Jackson had so we'll just
[46:31] try to walk here a little bit and like I
[46:33] said if we if we get a little bit down
[46:34] the road praise God if not we'll go
[46:36] right into communion but we'll just see
[46:38] what the Lord would have to say here he
[46:40] says uh in um uh let me get my my books
[46:44] right here because that one's not going
[46:45] to work might work a little
[46:49] later but in uh is this the end time
[46:52] s uh the prophet of God is he's
[46:55] referring to to um uh uh some dreams and
[46:59] uh some happenings and if you're very
[47:01] familiar with that message I tell you
[47:03] you ought to go study it because there's
[47:05] there's uh uh I mean by the things that
[47:08] happened leading up to the preaching of
[47:10] the seals oh just so Divine and so
[47:12] Supernatural but the prophet of God
[47:14] would say now listen this Angel come
[47:16] down from heaven see the other seven
[47:19] angels of the seven churches was Earthly
[47:21] Messengers but this Angel all the
[47:24] message is finished the seventh angel
[47:26] winds up the whole thing and this Angel
[47:29] comes not to the Earth he isn't a man
[47:32] from the earth as The Messengers to the
[47:34] church ages that's finished but this
[47:36] Angel brings the next announcement and
[47:39] an angel means a messenger and he comes
[47:42] down from heaven clothed in a pillar of
[47:44] light a cloud with a rainbow over his
[47:46] head and a rainbow is a covenant it was
[47:49] Christ with one foot on the land and one
[47:51] foot on the sea and he swore that time
[47:53] will be no more where are we ask what's
[47:57] this all about I'm asking you so notice
[47:59] this is uh December uh 12th uh I believe
[48:03] uh uh uh 29th uh December 12th uh let's
[48:07] get that right the month is December and
[48:09] it's the 29th of December 1962 I believe
[48:12] it is it should probably say that but
[48:14] brother brandom is preaching this
[48:15] message is this the end time s because
[48:18] of all these happening and he says what
[48:21] if it's something to let us know how to
[48:23] enter into rapturing faith is it we we
[48:27] will We Run leap over walls is there
[48:29] something fixing to happen and these Old
[48:31] marred Vile bodies are going to be Chang
[48:34] can I live to see it oh Lord is it so
[48:36] close that I'll see it is is this the
[48:38] generation sir my brethren what time is
[48:41] it where are we
[48:43] at he's sincerely asking the question
[48:46] because of the events and the things
[48:48] that have taken place and the prophecies
[48:51] and the dreams and the way God has been
[48:52] dealing with his heart so now paragraph
[48:54] 371 he goes it might be closer than you
[48:57] think it is it's got me scared oh I
[49:00] haven't done enough where are we
[49:03] at now take notice of this now and let's
[49:07] not you lose the sobriety of how the
[49:10] prophet is earnestly speaking to his
[49:12] congregation and he's saying it it might
[49:15] be closer to you think it's got me
[49:16] scared oh I haven't done enough where
[49:19] are we I say if the prophet could come
[49:21] to a place oh my where he would sit
[49:24] there after laying his life down for
[49:27] this gospel and preaching and and being
[49:29] an obedient servant and surrendering his
[49:32] life and all the signs and the Miracles
[49:35] and the travel the books couldn't even
[49:37] contain uhh the things that were
[49:39] performed through the ministry of the
[49:41] son of man in our generation and here he
[49:43] would stand and say
[49:47] that come
[49:49] on he would say oh I I I I I I haven't
[49:53] done enough I say if there be anything
[49:56] that you would take away from this this
[49:58] service if you could ask in your heart
[49:59] oh Lord have I done enough I haven't
[50:02] done enough Lord will you come will you
[50:05] come pick up the clay will you come pick
[50:06] up the vessel Lord if that was 60 plus
[50:09] years ago and the prophet was saying oh
[50:12] it might be closer than you think it
[50:14] gots me scared oh I haven't done enough
[50:16] where I say oh God I haven't done enough
[50:18] Lord forgive me for my sins Lord forgive
[50:21] me for for not taking this serious
[50:23] forgive me for being dilator and and and
[50:26] and having a a revelation of the message
[50:28] of the hour but then leaving it on a
[50:30] bookshelf somewhere Lord may I take the
[50:32] book May I eat it up Lord may my life be
[50:35] a prophecy again to fulfill the very
[50:37] words that you have spoken oh I want to
[50:40] be that surrendered vessel that God can
[50:42] speak
[50:45] through he said time shall be no more he
[50:48] announces that time is over what happens
[50:51] what happens could that be so now
[50:53] Brethren seriously think of it if if it
[50:55] is then the pyramid is capped by those
[50:58] seven Thunders you remember the pyramid
[51:01] message it's the Capstone what did it do
[51:04] the Holy Spirit capped off the
[51:07] individual and sealed it and went and
[51:09] added to our faith righteousness and
[51:11] godliness and faith and so forth and
[51:14] kept adding till we got seven things and
[51:17] the seventh one was love which is God
[51:20] that's how he makes the individual and
[51:23] caps him and seals him with the Holy
[51:26] Spirit I want that in my life Lord I
[51:28] Want You To Build Me Up Lord and cap my
[51:31] life with your Holy Spirit Lord I want
[51:34] all of those things in this message Lord
[51:36] that you have preached to be fulfilled
[51:38] in my life as according to your desire
[51:40] according to you word not according to
[51:42] how I think it should be see we always
[51:44] uh uh got something made up in our mind
[51:46] of how the word should manifest in our
[51:48] life our responsibility is to believe
[51:51] the word and say Amen to the word and
[51:54] then as you receive the word you become
[51:56] the word when you reject the word then
[51:59] there's no hope for you if re if you
[52:00] reject Grace there's nothing left but
[52:02] law but if you can accept this message
[52:05] of Grace and say Lord be it unto me
[52:07] according to your word just as Mary when
[52:10] that angel came and said Thou Art highly
[52:12] favored among women don't you realize
[52:14] that Malachi 4:5 is saying unto you Thou
[52:17] Art highly favored amongst all the
[52:20] churches amongst all those people out
[52:22] there that are claiming to know me and
[52:24] are claiming to be Believers but you oh
[52:27] you are highly favored among women that
[52:30] you would be the predestinated seat of
[52:33] God that could receive my word and
[52:35] become the word and I would Veil myself
[52:38] in you oh what an hour that we're living
[52:41] in living in the hour of the
[52:44] manifestations of the Sons and Daughters
[52:46] of
[52:47] God what a fellowship it
[52:51] is Lord may you cap our life off with
[52:54] that then if that be so he's got seven
[52:56] Church ages that he's had seven
[52:59] mysterious that's been sounded away and
[53:01] they've fought for to bring back and now
[53:04] the headstone comes to cap off the
[53:06] church does the Thunders mean that my
[53:08] brethren s is that where we're
[53:14] at juny I want to take your
[53:19] dream look Junior before the pyramid was
[53:23] ever preached months before it seen this
[53:26] dream now he's referring to brother
[53:28] Junior Jackson which I he had a dream I
[53:30] believe it was in 1961 in February he
[53:33] says you say what about a dream now I
[53:35] like this really close you want to
[53:38] follow this he says what about a dream
[53:40] you say well brother Matthew what about
[53:42] Junior's
[53:44] dream what about it well let's just see
[53:48] what the prophet thought about it
[53:49] because I wonder have you ever studied
[53:50] out the dreams have you ever studied out
[53:53] the things that the prophet lays out on
[53:55] tape are you aware of sister stephie's
[53:56] dream are you aware o of of the seven
[53:59] dreams before the vision and the vision
[54:01] in 1958 have you followed these things
[54:04] down through the scriptures or or down
[54:06] through the message because it plays a
[54:08] very integral part just like the road to
[54:11] emus why did the Lord start at gen
[54:13] Genesis and expound all those things
[54:16] because he was coming to a place in an
[54:18] hour that the veil was going to be taken
[54:20] away and that they would see him
[54:22] standing right there in their midst and
[54:24] their eyes would be
[54:27] open he didn't just start at Genesis
[54:30] because he felt he just thought well I
[54:31] guess I have nowhere else to start no
[54:33] there was a purpose look there's an
[54:35] eternal purpose what it said God had an
[54:37] eternal purpose everything the way that
[54:39] he was doing it was for a
[54:42] purpose you being here in this building
[54:45] in this moment is for an eternal
[54:48] purpose but we got to believe it we got
[54:51] to live like it we got to act like it
[54:56] what are you looking
[54:57] at maybe that would be a good title what
[55:00] are you looking
[55:01] at that's how a lot of beef starts out
[55:04] in the world forgive that terminology
[55:05] but some of you know what I'm talking
[55:07] about you're walking through the mall
[55:10] you're walking through the hallway or
[55:11] something like that what are you looking
[55:13] at what are you going to do about it I
[55:16] want to ask you what are you looking at
[55:19] and then what are you going to do about
[55:23] it he is telling you to look on
[55:27] this Nebuchadnezzar Dreamed a Dream he
[55:30] says what about a dream well
[55:32] Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a dream that
[55:34] Daniel interpreted told the beginning of
[55:36] the Gentile age and when it would leave
[55:39] and it's done just exactly that way not
[55:42] one bit of it has failed oh you're
[55:45] telling me there's an importance of a
[55:46] dream absolutely there's an importance
[55:49] of a dream I will say so much but more
[55:51] the interpretation of that dream and
[55:54] that's what the the prophet is standing
[55:56] here doing he's interpreting he's
[55:58] showing all of these events that have
[56:00] been stacking up to the hour that we're
[56:03] now H H uh uh uh jumping into he says
[56:06] you notice the writing was on the Rocks
[56:10] I was interpreted it for them they were
[56:11] related that's the mystery of God that's
[56:16] been not understood for years could that
[56:18] be and then a voice and then notice in
[56:22] some mysterious way we we picked up up
[56:25] out of the air a sharp tool that opened
[56:29] up the
[56:30] top and in there was white granite but
[56:33] it wasn't interpreted there was no
[56:36] letters I I didn't interpret that that
[56:38] Junior I I just looked at it and I said
[56:42] to my brethren look on
[56:45] this now notice his statement here he
[56:47] says and that's fulfilled
[56:50] tonight and while they were studying
[56:53] that I slipped towards the West what for
[56:56] maybe oh my maybe to understand the
[57:00] interpretation of what's written in the
[57:03] top of this could it be and those
[57:05] blastings the other morning That Shook
[57:08] Me Plum till I raised up in the air as
[57:10] high as this building that constellation
[57:12] of angels seven angels in the form of a
[57:14] pyramid is that them Thunders that's
[57:17] coming forth could it
[57:21] be do do we do we are we're message
[57:24] believers
[57:25] we study the message do we even know
[57:26] what he's talking
[57:28] about and that's okay if you
[57:31] don't he's talking about the mystery of
[57:34] his will he's talking about the mystery
[57:36] of his coming he's talking about the
[57:38] Fellowship of the
[57:40] mystery but now what is he doing he's
[57:42] referring to a vision that he had on on
[57:45] on December 22nd and my if if you would
[57:48] just go into this and study it out it's
[57:50] such a beautiful thing because it starts
[57:52] with brother brandom having a vision in
[57:54] 19 1958 about going west you you
[57:58] understand that that brother brandom's
[57:59] whole purpose in life if I could say he
[58:03] he was born for a
[58:05] purpose and there was something always
[58:07] in his life to go west something always
[58:10] pulling him to go
[58:12] west what for because there was
[58:15] scriptural prophecies that had been
[58:17] written down that his life that he was
[58:20] born to
[58:21] fulfill you say what do you mean he was
[58:24] Bor born to fulfill yes uh William
[58:26] Brandon was born to fulfill Malachi 4:5
[58:30] just the same as Moses was born to
[58:33] fulfill I shall send a
[58:36] deliverer that's right right he was born
[58:40] to be that deliverer to Israel that was
[58:43] the the predestinated one that was born
[58:46] that God would use to bring the children
[58:48] out by a mighty hand and bring them into
[58:50] the promised land and for this purpose
[58:53] uh Malachi 4 five our precious brother
[58:56] uh Brandon was born for this purpose
[58:59] that these things would happen and now
[59:01] he's coming to this place and he says is
[59:03] this where we're
[59:05] at because what did that Vision say in
[59:07] 1958 he said go out west when you see
[59:10] that steak being put down in your yard
[59:13] right he you know it kind of in that
[59:16] Vision it's really uh you know none of
[59:18] this we'll just we're just having a
[59:19] little fellowship tonight he you go you
[59:22] know he brother brandom had that Vision
[59:24] in 19 58 and and some guy come through
[59:26] with a bulldozer and just bulldoze the
[59:28] street and knock down his corner and his
[59:29] mailbox and everything just tore it all
[59:31] out and brother bam you know being a
[59:32] little Irish he got out there and
[59:34] started to talk with him a little bit
[59:35] and and you know he got in the flesh a
[59:37] little bit in that vision and he started
[59:39] to pound him a good one he went down the
[59:40] hill you know and the angel lord said
[59:42] now bypass
[59:45] that bypass that and go out west now the
[59:49] now what the prophet is saying he's now
[59:51] taking you I know we're just jumping in
[59:53] the middle of something we don't have
[59:54] time time maybe to lay all this out but
[59:56] he's jumping in and he's saying right
[59:58] now now brothers that's been fulfilled
[59:59] tonight why is he saying that because
[1:00:01] this is the last sermon he's preaching
[1:00:03] at the Tabernacle he gots everything
[1:00:05] packed up and he's going out west why is
[1:00:09] he going out
[1:00:11] west to bring the interpretation what's
[1:00:14] in the
[1:00:15] Capstone now let's just jump back and
[1:00:18] try to in that same message here and and
[1:00:20] try to catch a little bit I don't know
[1:00:22] what happened to the book there it is
[1:00:23] try to catch a little bit more on this
[1:00:25] uh if that's all right if if if like I
[1:00:28] said if we say anything just to stir you
[1:00:30] up and to go back and and read some of
[1:00:32] these things um so the the prophet God
[1:00:35] now if I can maybe just give a little
[1:00:38] background here so um Junior Jackson had
[1:00:42] a dream in 1961 so this is going to be
[1:00:45] in line with the vision so brother
[1:00:47] brandom has this Vision about going West
[1:00:49] in
[1:00:50] 1958 and and now the first Dream that's
[1:00:53] going to be in line with that vision is
[1:00:55] from Junior Jackson in 1961 in February
[1:00:58] and now from that there's going to be
[1:01:00] another uh uh uh six dreams there's
[1:01:02] going to be seven dreams in total sister
[1:01:04] stephie's going to have a dream so and
[1:01:06] it's all going to be in line with this
[1:01:08] Vision in 1958 because the the prophet
[1:01:11] of God cannot miss this this is why he
[1:01:13] was born this is so that so God is
[1:01:16] putting down landmarks and he's laying
[1:01:18] it out there confirming to the prophet
[1:01:20] where he's supposed to go where he's
[1:01:21] going to be and so now you lead on up um
[1:01:24] in this and on December 22nd this is
[1:01:27] when brother brandom is caught up in the
[1:01:29] vision of the Seven
[1:01:31] Angels but if you if you studyed out
[1:01:33] even that same night is when brother
[1:01:35] brandom had the the the dream about the
[1:01:38] the man with three clubs and how that
[1:01:40] was uh uh uh the the uh um help me
[1:01:45] out thank you how that was the Trinity
[1:01:48] the father son Holy Ghost and how that
[1:01:50] they Satan was beating down the church
[1:01:52] with that he had that so if you want to
[1:01:54] count that one that would be the seventh
[1:01:55] dream and then that morning he woke up I
[1:01:58] believe it was about 10:00 in the
[1:01:59] morning and there is the the prophet of
[1:02:02] God is caught up into a constellation of
[1:02:04] Angels in a
[1:02:05] vision a little bit up to
[1:02:07] speed so so that's where we're jumping
[1:02:10] in now brother brandom is actually
[1:02:12] referring and maybe just why why all of
[1:02:15] this is coming forth because this all
[1:02:17] pertains to The Fellowship of the
[1:02:19] mystery this all pertains to the
[1:02:22] Capstone this all pertains to the coming
[1:02:24] of the Lord
[1:02:25] this all pertains to the mystery of his
[1:02:27] will the mystery of his coming and the
[1:02:28] Mystery of us said I tell you this is a
[1:02:30] pretty big
[1:02:31] mystery you want to try to figure out
[1:02:33] while we're all sitting together it's a
[1:02:35] mystery to the world it's a mystery oh
[1:02:38] but praise the allmighty god the mystery
[1:02:41] of us sitting together is cuz we have
[1:02:43] heard the shout hallelujah our eyes have
[1:02:46] been open that's the mystery of us
[1:02:48] sitting together tonight is that we've
[1:02:50] been joined together right now by the
[1:02:52] quickening power of God that we might be
[1:02:54] changed in a moment and a twinkling of
[1:02:57] an eye that we would receive that
[1:02:58] rapturing faith that we would be gone
[1:03:02] right so just trying to jump in here
[1:03:04] somewhere where the prophet of God is is
[1:03:07] is is talking about this he goes and
[1:03:10] then it come to me this is uh paragraph
[1:03:13] 211 and is this the in sign of the ERS
[1:03:16] he says and then it come to me not a
[1:03:18] voice just come to me
[1:03:20] oh that is the angels of the Lord coming
[1:03:23] to give me my new Mission and when I
[1:03:25] thought that I raised up my hands I said
[1:03:27] oh Lord Jesus what will you have me to
[1:03:30] do and the vision left me for almost an
[1:03:33] hour I couldn't couldn't feel now you
[1:03:36] people know what the blessings of the
[1:03:38] Lord is but the power of the Lord is
[1:03:40] altogether different the power of the
[1:03:43] Lord in to in in them kind of places I
[1:03:46] felt it many many times before in Vision
[1:03:48] but never like that it feels like a
[1:03:51] reverent fear I was so scared till I was
[1:03:53] paralyzed in the presence of these
[1:03:55] beings I tell the truth as Paul said I
[1:03:57] lie not you never caught me saying
[1:03:59] anything wrong about something like that
[1:04:01] something is fixing to happen he said
[1:04:04] then after a while I said Lord Jesus if
[1:04:06] I'm going to be killed let me know so I
[1:04:08] won't tell uh my people about this but
[1:04:10] if it's something else let me know uh
[1:04:12] but nothing answered he said and the
[1:04:15] spirit left me for about half an hour I
[1:04:16] guess or more and I said Lord if it is
[1:04:19] then then I'm going to be killed you're
[1:04:20] you're finished with me on this Earth
[1:04:22] I'm going to be taken home now which
[1:04:24] which if that's it that's fine that's
[1:04:26] all right so if that is let me know send
[1:04:29] your power back upon me again then I'll
[1:04:30] then I'll know not to tell my people or
[1:04:32] anything about it because you're fixing
[1:04:33] to come and catch me away nothing
[1:04:36] happened I waited a while then I said
[1:04:38] Lord
[1:04:39] Jesus if it didn't mean that it it if it
[1:04:43] didn't mean that and it means that
[1:04:44] you've got something for me to do and
[1:04:47] it'll be revealed to me later then send
[1:04:50] your power and it almost took me from
[1:04:53] the room I found myself somewhere over
[1:04:56] in a corner I could hear my wife
[1:04:57] somewhere trying to shake the door the
[1:04:59] door in the bedroom was locked and I and
[1:05:01] I had my Bible open and was reading uh
[1:05:04] uh where it says I believe Romans 9th
[1:05:05] chapter the last verse it's Romans uh
[1:05:08] chapter 9: 33 behold I lay in Zion a
[1:05:11] Corner Stone a stumbling Stone a
[1:05:13] precious Cornerstone and whosoever
[1:05:15] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:05:19] whosoever shall believeth on him shall
[1:05:21] not be ashamed look we've received a
[1:05:23] message with is Christ and if you
[1:05:25] believe on this word that you have
[1:05:27] received you shall not be ashamed and I
[1:05:29] thought it'd be strange that I'd be
[1:05:31] reading that Spirit still packing me in
[1:05:32] the room and I closed up the Bible and
[1:05:35] stood there behold I lay in Zion behold
[1:05:38] I lay in the
[1:05:40] bride what what are what are these
[1:05:43] things all about what is he saying look
[1:05:45] on
[1:05:46] this because what is coming forth It's
[1:05:49] that third pull it's the opening of the
[1:05:52] word it's the Capstone coming crying
[1:05:54] Grace Grace look on this I tell you
[1:05:57] there's a lot of things to look on and
[1:05:59] Satan is doing his best to distract you
[1:06:01] from the message of the
[1:06:04] hour this is that which is going to give
[1:06:07] you rapturing faith and he's doing
[1:06:10] everything in his power to distract you
[1:06:12] from looking on this message and
[1:06:14] earnestly praying
[1:06:17] right earnestly praying God reveal this
[1:06:20] to me see we have to understand you are
[1:06:24] Your Own Worst Enemy and Your Own Worst
[1:06:27] Enemy that first nature that must die is
[1:06:29] a very religious nature and it can grab
[1:06:32] a hold of a quote or an idea and make
[1:06:35] you feel all nice and fuzzy and warm
[1:06:37] like you've arrived to something but we
[1:06:39] haven't arrived to anything oh I say
[1:06:42] where is that evidence in our lives that
[1:06:44] we've been changed that we've been born
[1:06:46] again that we're in there behind the
[1:06:48] veil living in the shakina glory where
[1:06:51] where the pillar of fire is and we're
[1:06:53] feeding on the Mana and Revelation is
[1:06:55] breaking unto us I want to live in that
[1:06:58] place I want to die to this flesh I want
[1:07:00] to crucify this flesh I say Lord reveal
[1:07:03] yourself to me I want to live in there
[1:07:08] prophet of God would say this in the
[1:07:10] indictment he
[1:07:11] said he said I challenge any man to show
[1:07:15] me anybody and and know this tape goes
[1:07:18] around the world any Bishop will come uh
[1:07:21] uh uh uh to my study or before this
[1:07:23] congregation and point their finger to
[1:07:24] one place anybody was ever baptized in
[1:07:27] the name of the father Son and Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost in the New Testament I'll show you
[1:07:31] where every person that ever was
[1:07:32] baptized and those who were baptized
[1:07:35] different had to come and be Reed
[1:07:37] baptized to get the Holy Ghost what are
[1:07:40] you going to do about it stay out there
[1:07:43] in your Creed stay out there in your
[1:07:45] dogmas and die now I say there's a great
[1:07:47] danger that comes upon us because we
[1:07:50] have been called out we feel like maybe
[1:07:53] as we we are uh in the association of
[1:07:55] the so-called message there's nothing
[1:07:57] for you to come out of but we got to
[1:07:59] come out of our thinking we got to come
[1:08:01] out of our ideas we got to come out of
[1:08:03] our preconceived ideas of what we think
[1:08:05] the message is when the last time you
[1:08:07] really got on your knees and prayed for
[1:08:09] God to reveal and give you the
[1:08:10] Revelation who is this mzc who is the
[1:08:13] son of man what day are we really living
[1:08:15] in Lord I want a greater revelation of
[1:08:17] Malachi 45 all of these things look it's
[1:08:20] constantly unfolding and we want to be
[1:08:22] living in the presence of God behind the
[1:08:24] veil where the word is constantly
[1:08:26] unfolding in our life other than that we
[1:08:28] become stagnant we become just
[1:08:30] borderline Believers we become just a
[1:08:32] good religion with our Creeds and our
[1:08:33] dogmas but God is calling say look on
[1:08:37] this look away from those things let's
[1:08:39] look at the revealed word of the hour
[1:08:41] what are you going to do about it stay
[1:08:43] uh stay out there in your Creed stay out
[1:08:45] there in your dogmas and die you're
[1:08:46] you're guilty with Wicked hands you've
[1:08:48] took the Prince of Life The Word of Life
[1:08:51] and crucified it to the people now what
[1:08:54] did they do they didn't know it today
[1:08:56] men walk ignorantly they don't know that
[1:08:59] it's the truth they think it's some kind
[1:09:01] of ism they don't dig down now this is
[1:09:03] where I wanted to get to they don't dig
[1:09:05] down deep enough to get into the spirit
[1:09:08] of
[1:09:11] Revelation Lord help
[1:09:15] us now we know he's preaching the
[1:09:17] indictment he's inditing this generation
[1:09:18] with the second crucifixion of Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ I'd say he had to be here to be
[1:09:22] crucified that's right A lot of people
[1:09:25] get things out of
[1:09:29] balance they don't dig down deep enough
[1:09:32] to get into the spirit of Revelation
[1:09:34] they don't pray enough they don't call
[1:09:37] upon God
[1:09:39] enough oh my is he talking to
[1:09:44] somebody or do we we got that down we we
[1:09:47] we cry out we pray for Revelation enough
[1:09:49] we get the spirit of Revelation upon us
[1:09:50] enough I mean we're just good right
[1:09:55] no they just take it they just lightly
[1:09:57] take it oh well I believe there's a God
[1:10:01] sure the devil believes the same thing
[1:10:04] oh I believe the message sure the devil
[1:10:07] believes the same thing the de the devil
[1:10:10] believes it more than some people claim
[1:10:12] to believe
[1:10:13] it the devil believes it and trembles
[1:10:17] now follow
[1:10:19] this hey this is convicting to
[1:10:22] me
[1:10:25] the de devil believes and tremble people
[1:10:27] just believe it and go on but the
[1:10:29] devil's trembles knowing his judgment is
[1:10:32] coming and people believe it and don't
[1:10:34] pay no attention the judgment is
[1:10:38] coming is that how we've received the
[1:10:40] message is that how we're believing the
[1:10:42] message we just believe it and go
[1:10:44] on whatever career path whatever uh uh
[1:10:48] thing that we want we just we just go on
[1:10:50] any kind of
[1:10:51] way never really earnestly contending
[1:10:54] for the faith never crying out to God
[1:10:56] for Revelation never getting down and
[1:10:58] getting into your Bible and getting into
[1:11:00] a place oh where you just feel like the
[1:11:03] presence of God is packing you up in the
[1:11:05] room and and you're in your Bible and
[1:11:06] it's I want to tell you that's not just
[1:11:08] some fantasy that was reserved for the
[1:11:10] prophet that's for every son and
[1:11:12] daughter of God if you would just get
[1:11:14] away somewhere from the busyness of life
[1:11:17] and quiet yourself before God and say
[1:11:19] God I need an answer God I need a
[1:11:22] revelation God I hear the pastor
[1:11:24] speaking I hear the the the the the
[1:11:26] Evangelist speaking Lord I need
[1:11:28] something more Lord I need a revelation
[1:11:31] I want to be in that place I want to be
[1:11:33] in your presence I want to be eating
[1:11:35] that Mana I want to be receiving the
[1:11:38] spirit of Revelation oh God reveal
[1:11:40] yourself to me and when he does that
[1:11:42] then there's a
[1:11:45] change because if you don't have that
[1:11:47] your Feast runs
[1:11:52] out oh you go you go to the camp
[1:11:54] meetings and and and you you you go to
[1:11:57] the church service and everything and
[1:11:59] you get all revived and you feel all
[1:12:01] good but what do you do you go right
[1:12:02] back down into that
[1:12:04] cycle the prophet of God would say why
[1:12:07] and why are people so tossed about he
[1:12:09] said but you ever meet somebody they're
[1:12:10] the same on Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:12:13] Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday said he
[1:12:15] don't need to go to church to get pumped
[1:12:17] up he's just always the same why because
[1:12:19] he's living behind the veil I say oh God
[1:12:21] if that's what you're Prophet said or me
[1:12:23] into that place I want to be the same s
[1:12:26] days a week 24/7 living in your presence
[1:12:29] I don't want to be tossed to and fro
[1:12:30] back and forth don't you realize that's
[1:12:32] what the devil's trying to do is get you
[1:12:34] out of his presence get you out of the
[1:12:36] message look at this look don't you

[1:15:07] I want to ask you all these things just
[1:15:08] be how how much of is it going to help
[1:15:10] you take a body
[1:15:15] change I tell you some of us get real
[1:15:17] real serious about careers and
[1:15:18] educations I don't know why we're
[1:15:20] here we put a lot of time and money
[1:15:23] invest into that I want to ask you how
[1:15:26] much closer has it brought you to the
[1:15:31] Lord we should pray about these
[1:15:33] things look everybody doesn't have to go
[1:15:36] to
[1:15:37] college there's a pressure though the
[1:15:41] pressure of this age for you to go to
[1:15:43] college and get an education and all of
[1:15:46] these things the pressure just weighing
[1:15:48] upon look at this look at this this
[1:15:50] career and that that that that you say
[1:15:52] you know you got to be like that brother
[1:15:53] say I you've been trained to look at all
[1:15:56] these things but I'm not looking at what
[1:15:58] the world has to offer I'm looking on
[1:16:01] this I'm looking on the revealed word of
[1:16:03] the hour I'm looking on a Divine promise
[1:16:07] that has given me rapturing faith that I
[1:16:09] can be changed in a moment and a
[1:16:12] twinkling of an eye that the quickening
[1:16:14] power oh if that same spirit that raised
[1:16:16] Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:16:19] it will also Quicken your mortal
[1:16:21] body oh praise His Wonderful
[1:16:24] Name
[1:16:27] hallelujah praise His Wonderful Name the
[1:16:29] prophet of God would say
[1:16:32] this we got a little time Pentecostals
[1:16:35] you say well we believe in speaking in
[1:16:37] tongues for the evidence sure speaking
[1:16:39] in tongues is all right now we're we're
[1:16:42] in uh now we're just jumping around here
[1:16:44] in an absolute because brother brandom
[1:16:46] preaches the absolute that morning to
[1:16:49] Serv as this the time and he references
[1:16:51] that same scripture uh Romans 9:33 so we
[1:16:55] just read a little of this uh he says
[1:16:59] speaking in tongues right but that is
[1:17:01] still not the evidence many people speak
[1:17:03] in tongues that's true and that's as far
[1:17:05] as they ever go the devil can
[1:17:07] impersonate any
[1:17:10] gift the devil can impersonate any gift
[1:17:13] that's got any gift that's in the Bible
[1:17:15] Paul said though I speak with tongue of
[1:17:17] men and angels though I give my body to
[1:17:20] be burned a sacrifice though I sell all
[1:17:22] my goods to feed the poor and though I
[1:17:24] have faith to move mountains though I
[1:17:26] went to the Seminary and learned all the
[1:17:28] knowledge there is to be learned I'm
[1:17:30] still nothing it's the person of Christ
[1:17:34] Christ receive him and you can't receive
[1:17:36] him without receiving the
[1:17:39] word hear that now yes sir you can't
[1:17:43] receive him without receiving the word
[1:17:45] the word has to come
[1:17:48] first then I want to say if you say you
[1:17:50] re I'm sorry I'm just going to say but
[1:17:52] if you say you re receive the baptism of
[1:17:53] the Holy Ghost outside of this message
[1:17:56] that is fine I want to say there is more
[1:17:58] of the baptism for for you of the Holy
[1:18:00] Ghost in this message because he's
[1:18:03] saying you can't receive what he's
[1:18:04] speaking of without receiving the word
[1:18:06] first so you might be able to receive it
[1:18:09] under a dispensation of Pentecostalism
[1:18:11] or under the blessings of the
[1:18:13] Pentecostals but when you come to the
[1:18:14] truth of the age or to the revelation of
[1:18:17] the hour there's the person of Jesus
[1:18:19] Christ that makes his embode inside of
[1:18:21] your heart
[1:18:23] and the heart is the
[1:18:25] ark and what's in the ark
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:29] Hallelujah that's where the Mana is
[1:18:33] that's where the presence of God is is
[1:18:34] back in there that's where Aaron Rod
[1:18:36] would brought forth life and it bloomed
[1:18:39] and it never withered oh if you can live
[1:18:41] in there that's what this message has
[1:18:44] come to do that's what the Capstone
[1:18:46] could it be yes this is the revelation
[1:18:49] of those seven Thunders to bring you
[1:18:51] into the presence of God
[1:19:00] Glory he says it's the person of Christ
[1:19:03] Christ received him and you can't
[1:19:05] receive him without receiving his word
[1:19:07] the word has come has to come first then
[1:19:09] the life comes into that word and is man
[1:19:13] and manifests that word that's
[1:19:16] powerful pray that the the Lord would
[1:19:18] bring more Revelation to
[1:19:21] that didn't Jesus say if I do not the
[1:19:23] works of my father then don't believe me
[1:19:25] it was the word of God being manifested
[1:19:27] God was in Christ Rec reconciling
[1:19:30] expressing himself to the world that he
[1:19:32] was that was the absolute that was the
[1:19:36] Eternal absolute there now you say is
[1:19:39] that Eternal brother brandom that was
[1:19:41] then what about
[1:19:43] today Jesus said he that believeth on me
[1:19:46] the works that I do shall he do also
[1:19:48] it's the same absolute all right each
[1:19:51] one has their own absolute oh my it's
[1:19:54] just like it was in the days of Judges
[1:19:56] every man done what was right in his own
[1:19:59] sight I know it's a little bit of
[1:20:00] reading but bear with me in the days of
[1:20:03] Judges every man had his own absolute he
[1:20:06] did just what he wanted to sounds like
[1:20:10] today we just do what we want to we just
[1:20:13] do what we plan and what we want to do
[1:20:15] and that's the way it is now every man
[1:20:17] done right in his own sight now you know
[1:20:20] the reason they did that in judges this
[1:20:23] might shock you a little bit but the
[1:20:24] reason they did it in judge is because
[1:20:26] they had no profit in them days for the
[1:20:29] word of the Lord to come to so every man
[1:20:31] can do what he wanted to is that in his
[1:20:34] own sight and that's exactly what's
[1:20:36] happened today we don't have the prophet
[1:20:40] in these day in these days of
[1:20:42] denominations but God promised us one
[1:20:45] see and he did in the last days he would
[1:20:48] rise up and send Elijah back on the
[1:20:51] scene again and he would turn the hearts
[1:20:54] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:20:56] fathers back to the original Pentecost
[1:20:59] you know what he you know he said that
[1:21:01] just a few more paragraphs now I know
[1:21:04] you'll re now I know you'll refer as he
[1:21:06] did there at John over in Matthew 11
[1:21:09] chapter and the sixth verse I believe it
[1:21:10] is when they said who do you think this
[1:21:13] man was this
[1:21:17] John he said if you can receive it this
[1:21:20] is he that was spoken of
[1:21:25] behold I send my messenger before my
[1:21:28] face that's Malachi 3 not Malachi 4 but
[1:21:32] remember if that was the Malachi 4 then
[1:21:35] the word failed because he said but just
[1:21:37] at this time the whole world would be
[1:21:39] burnt and the righteous would walk upon
[1:21:42] the ashes of the wicked don't mix it up
[1:21:44] brother make it say just exactly what it
[1:21:47] says that's right he promised in the
[1:21:49] last days and it'll be right there in
[1:21:52] the midst
[1:21:54] remember when judges every man done the
[1:21:56] way he wanted I know we're laboring you
[1:21:58] a little bit but we'll get we'll get
[1:21:59] through quickly there was no man no man
[1:22:02] that could make the word live there was
[1:22:04] no Prophet the word of the lord always
[1:22:07] comes to the prophet right and he was
[1:22:09] always hated only the little group that
[1:22:12] loved him see but I mean there was
[1:22:15] always that God doesn't change his
[1:22:18] policy he cannot and be God if God ever
[1:22:22] says any or does anything he must do it
[1:22:24] the next time when that crisis arrives
[1:22:27] if he don't act the second time the way
[1:22:29] he did the first time he acted wrong the
[1:22:31] first time right now I know I'm killing
[1:22:34] you with a bunch of reading but but at
[1:22:35] least it's the word of God so I can I
[1:22:37] can rest assur that and who and and who
[1:22:41] will accuse God of acting wrong who are
[1:22:44] you can you lay sin to God that's what
[1:22:46] Jesus said which one of you can accuse
[1:22:48] me of sin what is sin unbelief he that
[1:22:51] believeth not and is condemned already
[1:22:54] which one of you can show me that I
[1:22:55] haven't fulfilled everything the Messiah
[1:22:57] should
[1:22:59] do and catch what he's saying here
[1:23:02] you're not speaking about 2,000 years
[1:23:06] ago see nobody spoke a word the Messiah
[1:23:10] was a prophet and he had proved that he
[1:23:11] was that they hadn't had a prophet for
[1:23:14] hundreds of years since Malachi and here
[1:23:16] he rose on the scene he was a Mystic to
[1:23:20] the people and a stumbling block to
[1:23:22] their church cuz he said behold I lay in
[1:23:25] Zion a Cornerstone a precious one tried
[1:23:28] oh a stumbling Stone yeah but whosoever
[1:23:31] believeth on
[1:23:33] him shall not be ashamed that's right
[1:23:36] there he
[1:23:37] was Oh Praise His Wonderful Name there
[1:23:41] he was and that's just exactly fulfilled
[1:23:44] scripture but those who believed him had
[1:23:47] an
[1:23:48] absolute that's why you're not to tossed
[1:23:50] to and fro because you have an
[1:23:55] absolute because you believed on him
[1:23:59] Christ the word he said look at little
[1:24:01] Martha when she seen Lazarus come up
[1:24:04] from the
[1:24:05] grave she knew who that was even before
[1:24:09] it was done she had the absolute of
[1:24:12] knowing I believe that thou art the Son
[1:24:14] of God that was to come into the word
[1:24:16] even now though my brother be dead just
[1:24:19] say the word God will do it again amen
[1:24:22] was absolutely positive that's right he
[1:24:24] said and she meant it from her heart and
[1:24:27] he said where have you buried
[1:24:29] him where have you buried
[1:24:31] him why because that was the word made
[1:24:34] flesh that was the Messiah where have
[1:24:37] you buried him you know that struck my
[1:24:39] heart I just think of it I I don't know
[1:24:41] about you but I was buried I was buried
[1:24:44] out there in lady
[1:24:45] oia I I was buried under sin and buried
[1:24:48] under complexes and I was buried and
[1:24:51] felt like I had no no hope and no peace
[1:24:53] I tell you if anybody seemed hopeless it
[1:24:56] was Lazarus Lazarus seemed pretty is
[1:24:58] anybody here that's more hopeless than
[1:24:59] Lazarus somebody here more hopeless than
[1:25:01] Lazarus well Lazarus would done already
[1:25:03] dead he was already
[1:25:07] rotten and maybe your situation
[1:25:11] stinks maybe it's rotten to the core and
[1:25:13] it feels hopeless you feel like your
[1:25:15] marriage is hopeless you feel like your
[1:25:17] family's hopeless you feel like your
[1:25:19] job's hopeless you feel hopeless you
[1:25:21] feel like everything is hopeless but I
[1:25:23] want to tell you I don't care how
[1:25:25] hopeless it is when the voice of the
[1:25:28] Resurrection
[1:25:31] comes when the absolute stands there and
[1:25:34] says Where have you laid them where have
[1:25:37] you buried them all that voice said
[1:25:41] Lazarus don't you realize that we have
[1:25:43] heard the voice of the resurrection and
[1:25:46] this day calling you out of dark
[1:25:48] denominations and traditions no matter
[1:25:50] how rotten your situation is there is an
[1:25:53] absolute here tonight to call you out of
[1:25:57] that if thou cast believe all things are
[1:26:02] possible oh that's what we're say look
[1:26:04] on
[1:26:06] this look on
[1:26:09] this look on this word look on this
[1:26:12] Revelation we'll just find a a way to
[1:26:18] close look on
[1:26:21] this
[1:26:23] what have you been looking
[1:26:25] at what have you been called up caught
[1:26:28] up into
[1:26:29] lately
[1:26:34] huh what's been consuming your
[1:26:37] life what is this all about what was
[1:26:41] it the prophet was born for this
[1:26:44] purpose he was born for the purpose to
[1:26:46] go out
[1:26:47] west to be caught up there with them
[1:26:50] seven angels and to come back
[1:26:52] and give the interpretation of what was
[1:26:54] inside the
[1:26:56] Capstone just as John was was there to
[1:26:59] introduce what what was he born for John
[1:27:03] was born to introduce the
[1:27:06] Messiah that's exactly what Malachi 45
[1:27:09] has done has introduced the
[1:27:13] Messiah if you're looking for something
[1:27:15] far off in the
[1:27:16] future if I could say look on this he's
[1:27:21] here
[1:27:22] that's what this message has declared is
[1:27:24] he's
[1:27:26] here he said over and over man's always
[1:27:29] looked into what he's done and what he's
[1:27:31] going to do but he's failing to see what
[1:27:33] he's doing right now he's here he's
[1:27:37] veiling himself in a bride according to
[1:27:40] as he has said prophet of God says this
[1:27:42] in the indictment he says but the hour
[1:27:44] has arrived the last days are here when
[1:27:47] God promised according to Malachi 4 that
[1:27:49] he would raise up in the last days and
[1:27:52] would turn the hearts of the people back
[1:27:54] to the original blessing and the
[1:27:56] Pentecostal Faith of Our Fathers and you
[1:27:58] can't deny it you can't withstand
[1:28:02] it now he's he's preaching the
[1:28:05] indictment and he's telling the clergy
[1:28:08] and he's telling the denominations he's
[1:28:10] telling the whole world that God has
[1:28:12] proved he's the same yesterday today and
[1:28:14] forever everything that he has promised
[1:28:17] has been fulfilled here he is right you
[1:28:20] right here in the midst he say if if
[1:28:22] don't believe my words believe the works
[1:28:24] that I do for they testify of who I am
[1:28:27] over around the world seven times
[1:28:28] declaring he's here he's the same
[1:28:30] yesterday today and
[1:28:33] forever now I want to say I like this
[1:28:36] now look what he said it's almost like
[1:28:37] he's saying it in the in the negative he
[1:28:39] says and you can't deny it and you can't
[1:28:41] withstand
[1:28:43] it oh they tried to deny it they tried
[1:28:46] to extend but I want to look on this as
[1:28:49] a
[1:28:50] positive because for the predestinated
[1:28:53] seed you can't deny it either and you
[1:28:56] can't withstand
[1:28:58] it you can run but you can't hide go on
[1:29:02] prodical you can run but you can't hide
[1:29:05] I don't know what you're going through
[1:29:07] but I want to tell you there's a
[1:29:09] predestinated seed inside of you that
[1:29:11] cannot deny it and you can't withstand
[1:29:15] it
[1:29:16] Hallelujah I say oh God I can't deny
[1:29:19] this message and I can't withstand
[1:29:22] I've been consumed by your love I've
[1:29:24] been consumed by the message Lord let me
[1:29:27] look on
[1:29:30] this let me look on the revelation of
[1:29:32] the
[1:29:34] hour just in closing the prophet of God
[1:29:36] would say
[1:29:37] this he would
[1:29:40] say in Christ the mystery he'd say and
[1:29:43] here he is today in the same manner by
[1:29:47] the same Pillar of Fire expressing
[1:29:50] himself and vindicating him self the
[1:29:52] same revealing the mystery of God that's
[1:29:56] been hid before the foundation of the
[1:29:59] world I want to say that you're part of
[1:30:01] that
[1:30:03] mystery come

[1:30:29] look on the word let's start looking on
[1:30:32] this let's get sincere let's start
[1:30:34] realizing that you've been born for a
[1:30:37] purpose just as just as John was born
[1:30:40] for that purpose to introduce the
[1:30:42] Messiah what's your purpose John why are

[1:30:59] Lamb of God that takes away the sins of
[1:31:01] the world what is the purpose of this
[1:31:03] message is to introduce the Messiah to
[1:31:06] you to introduce to you the one that can

[1:31:48] the spirit of Revelation you've been
[1:31:50] born for a purpose
[1:31:52] prophet of God said you were made for an
[1:31:54] eternal purpose because you was the
[1:31:56] manifestation of an attribute that was
[1:31:58] in God I say look on
[1:32:01] this let's look on the things that God
[1:32:04] has for us the brothers that are going
[1:32:06] to
[1:32:07] prepare uh we just want
[1:32:09] to read in our scripture in uh
[1:32:13] Corinthians 1 Corinthians
[1:32:20] 11
[1:32:29] verse
[1:32:39] 23 is everybody feeling
[1:32:42] okay man it's good to come to the
[1:32:44] communion
[1:32:46] table um that it shouldn't be approached
[1:32:50] lightly it shouldn't be
[1:32:53] approached out of
[1:32:55] routine it should be approached
[1:32:58] sincerely and
[1:33:03] reverently 1 Corinthians chapter 11 it
[1:33:07] says for I have received of the Lord
[1:33:10] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:33:12] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:33:14] which he was betrayed took bread when he
[1:33:17] had given thanks he break it and said
[1:33:19] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:33:21] for you this do in remembrance of
[1:33:24] me after the same manner also he took
[1:33:27] the
[1:33:28] cup when he had s saying this is the cup
[1:33:31] of the New Testament of my blood this do
[1:33:34] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:33:36] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:33:39] and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[1:33:42] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:33:45] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:33:47] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:33:49] of the body and the blood of the Lord
[1:33:52] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:33:55] him eat of that bread and drink of that
