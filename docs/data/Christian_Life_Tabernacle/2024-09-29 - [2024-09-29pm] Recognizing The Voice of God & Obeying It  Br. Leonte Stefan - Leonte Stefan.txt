this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen just open our Bibles [Music] [Music] John chapter 10 verses 1 through five John chapter 10 and the word of the Lord says this verily verily I say unto you that he that entereth not by the door into the sheep fold but climb it some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that entered in by the door is The Shepherd of the Sheep to him the porter open openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he called his own Sheep by name and he leadth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him because for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers amen amen Lord I pray that you'd be able to bless your word Lord may we just be a vessel may we just be a channel that you would be able to come and P your anointing your oil for your people Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can have your seats um you had the best choice tonight you chose to be in the house of God where here you can find peace you can find Healing you can receive your answer to every question that you have because here is God and God presents himself through his word which was given just how we read and if I was to give a title or maybe a thought to this message that the Lord had put on my heart is recognizing the voice of God and obeying it it's very important this this thing we can hear the word we can hear a lot of voices that are around us because there's a lot of voices there's a lot of a lot of voices out there that talk and it was always like this from the beginning because the devil all he was able to do is to pervert and he was only there to pervert what God had [Music] created but right in the middle of this Darkness God always had his voice that was able to lead his own children amen he says because it's very hard to be able to read all the quotes that that I was able to to read within a few thoughts that I may have I'd like to play a portion of a tape that it's a voice that would be able to speak in these last days and the thoughts that I would I would want to bring to surface I would like to pay attention to how the voice of God was from the beginning that God had before the foundation of the world and it was a voice that was able to be transmitted until this day it was a line it was it was it was a line that that was able to go from the beginning to the end if we pay attention to the marvelous plan of God and vision and all that he created he had a blueprint he had a plan and within this plan there was able to be known all the conditions in which they were to function by the word of God all that God had as a plan he had his thoughts he had him in his plan that was before from the beginning which that plan needed to be put in function in a function and spoken in Genesis it says this the Genesis says that in the beginning the word the Earth was void and without form and over the face of the earth and the waters there was darkness and the spirit of the Lord was walking upon the surfaces of the water on top of the water and from that condition God starts beginning that the vision from the plan so so that way the the vision that he had that it would be able to be spoken it would be able to be given and that his word would be able to come into an existence and and the Lord said and let there be light he he divides the the light from the Darkness I would I would like to for you to pay attention to something even the nature recognize the voice of God obeyed the word and he was able that all that was moving at the at the word or at the thoughts of God the nature was able to recognize the voice of the Creator and it it was obeying it it submitted itself under that word because his voice was and will always remain forever the word of the Lord says that today if you hear his word don't Harden your heart and receive him in your life the waters he gathers them together the Earth is being able to be shown on the on the exterior the Earth to bring greenness or life uh grass every tree to bring a be able to bring fruit after its own kind and at after every after everything this is how it was right after the word that he was able to speak and then and then he creates the Angels the so then he creates the light he creates the sun the sun the moon the stars all of those start appearing at his word at his at his promise and then he starts creating all of the animals all of the living creatures all of the living creatures when all of those were created and the right conditions for them to live in how wonderful God do we have he created man you got you you understood the point God creates all the conditions all that he offers man to be able to survive and then he creates man to Rejoice or to be happy in the presence of God we have a wonderful God a great God the Lord created them and he gave them all the conditions all the power that was in Christ in the church just for us to be able to oby to be able to do the will of the Lord recognize the voice of God because World a lot of voices a lot of a lot of thoughts a lot of voices I was really surprised when brother Matthew had brought that that uh that message that was from uh the AI the voice that that that that speaks to the the voice of politics and when the question was asked what should I do to be able to serve you as the devil he responded very easily he said that I'll never convince you that there's not a God I will make you be the most occupied man in the world I will tell you that when you go through trials and tribulations Where's God there there's a lot of voices the most important is to listen to the voice of God because he said without a doubt I will not leave you even if a mother would be able to leave her child child I will never leave you I will never leave you I will be with you even in you until the end of the world this is God this is our God all we have to do is recognize his voice when everything was created even the conditions that were necessary and then he created nothing else that was able to complete or add to the world the world that God created the Lord said this is it he says grow multiply and have dominion over the world that have given you amen what a great God we have he created all things and then he brought man and gave all the creation to him he gave him the title he gave him the title deed amen she okay and for man to be able to accept to live in the presence of God God was meeting with God or Walking with God Adam and he was rejoicing of his voice and the presence of God think about it to be able to bring in the presence of God to be able to see the glory and his wonderfulness and every morning the cool of the evening to be able to have him speak to you it's wonderful and and he was meeting with Adam every day and was he was he was giving him his presence and and he was created the atmosphere to hear or to understand God and to be able to hear the voice of God but in in a certain day something happened he heard another voice I won't I won't get in there but I I'd like to have the prophet just say it and then is when man had fallen into sin and there is where now separation came away from God because sin a wall of division between God and man the sin even here the Lord even here the Lord had the vision and the condition of restoration in God there was a lot of attributes a lot of qualities that he wanted to reveal to his children to his to his people he was uh the uh Everlasting father almighty Everlasting father he was Jehovah Jehovah Gyra Jehovah shom all of these attributes that was inside of him was was needed to be revealed or shown unto man and he had the time the condition and the way that he needed to to be we brought and that's how God was able to be revealed and to be able to speak to man and to be able to reveal his plan and all that the attributes that was inside of him and and and in this Mo in this way God God is speaking to Noah I would like for you to pay attention and see how God speaks even within man where the seed of God was before the foundation of the world is able to obey or submit themselves to the word and the Lord speaks to Noah and he says this in uh Genesis uh Genesis chapter 5 six Genesis chapter 6 5-9 verses 5 through n and God saw that the wickedness of man was gray in the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord Noah Noah was a righteous man and without spot from the ones from from the from his time or his generation Noah walked with God in that time in that age the the evil was so dark was so heavy all the thoughts or imaginations of man were always evil but within in the middle of this condition uh God had a man and he was he was holy he was righteous and he was walking with the Lord seat of God and when the word when when the word came to Noah he was able to recognize the voice of God amen amen uh in the age and and the condition or maybe the standard in in those days a man that would be walking with the Lord that God had this in mind or his vision from from from the beginning or from the from the beginning of the world God talks with Noah and Noah recognizes the voice of God and he gives them all the instructions that he has need of he created all of the conditions that were needed or that was necessary the Lord tells them to build an ark because he wants to destroy the world and all that's inside of it and who will hear the voice and would be able to enter in would be able to be saved the the the the choosing election amen amen election the election amen who would enter inside the ark would be saved the the election that's that's it amen who will receive the word of God and enters inside the ark they're saved this is the same thing that is happening today hears the message of the Lord enters inside which is the message which is the word of God is saved Al is is elected uh think about it for a second in a world where there was never known of what rain was brother brother bam says that that that you have to be an odd man sometimes you have to be so odd where the people sometimes you have to be so OD that that they would think they they wouldn't know what you mean but when you try to explain to them what you're trying to talk about for them there's not able to understand they're not able to to understand but Noah recognizing the word of God he knew that God would be able to hold to his promise regardless if there was never heard of such a thing as rain or maybe even the science about even the people of science it was it was contradicting them he knew that God will always stand behind his word amen God speaks to Mo Moses and he recognizes the voice of God he recognizes the voice of God Moses does and God confirms him would like to see how God works in strange ways or odd ways Moses was a really wise man he was he grew up as a child in Pharaoh's home but God didn't call him then he tried he tried to do something with his own abilities or his own ways but he fell and and then God took him from that place and took him into the Wilderness 40 years and at the age of 80 years old God calls him and he calls him to the pillar of Fire the burning bush and it says take your shoes off because the the the place you are standing on is [Music] Holy recognize in other words it be you uh Own It Be Yourself be you when Moses at that time recognized the voice of God God always will confirm the calling or his calling and the Lord told them what do you have in your hand and he says a stick he says throw it down and it transformed into a serpent as his spr of the Quad he says pick it up by the tail he he picked it up and took it up and it transformed right back into the stick the confirmation because the Lord called him and was able to stand behind the word also confirmed or demonstrated that God will always stand behind his word when God speaks he will always confirm and he will always to be able to stand before his word so it gets fulfilled and God is asking Jeremiah he says what do you see Jeremiah he says I see a a watch a Watchman amen he says what do you see Jeremiah he says I see a Watchman he says you surely see good because I watch over the word to be able to be fulfilled the Lord speaks to Samuel the the word says that in those days the word was really was very rare the Lord speaks to Samuel it tells him and the word of the Lord says that always the word of God comes to the prophet and Samuel was a prophet and I won't I won't get in that either but I'll just let the prophet said the Lord speaks to Saul recognizes the voice and from a religious man he transform his life completely into a new man and a new nature he was a man full of zeal he was a man that was ready to fight for whatever he was believing but one day Jesus stood before him the pillar of fire and he said he said sa sa why are you persecuting me and he recognized the voice and he says who are you Lord I am Jesus the one that you crucify and when the man recognizes the voice able to to submit himself or obey it you can know all the law you can see all the quotes you can see all the message from the beginning to the end when God speaks and when the Pillar of Fire comes upon your experience or your life your life is changed you become a new man become a new nature of God you become a man after the image of of God you die to sin you are man that's born after the the image of God every one of us needs to be able to stand before God be able to have that that personal meeting or relationship with God and God himself speaks through his son Jesus Christ which came to be able to restore all that was lost and it was perverted all that was to that moment was perverted and was not able to give life coming and and the motive for his coming was to be able to choose a a a clean bride and to be able to be washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and to be able to pay the debt of sin that was able that was oppressing upon the the the world or upon the people as a matter of fact God in flesh reconciling the world to himself for through the cross because because the the the payment for of sin is death we we want to come closer to our days chaos and within the within the chaos prop says that with in the days that we are living in is the darkest or is the darkest or more most chaotic uh age or or time that we're living in there's a lot of voices op there is a lot of op opinions and the prophet says he says that the voice of politics actually has more power uh is heard more than the voice of God the the the voice of science it has a certain interpretation or or an influence upon the world and says that here in United States of America Hollywood has another voice and in the middle of this house in in the middle of all of this Darkness God speaks to a prophet and the Lord speaks to the prophet of this generation is able to reveal all the Mysteries that was hidden before the foundation of the world because the Lord told John in in the uh Patmos or island of patmas it says there's no until the end time he says don't write until the end time today there's a lot of voices and people are confused or don't know what to listen to anymore uh confusion appears they start becoming more lovers of themselves instead of lovers of God they they search more for the satisfaction of of of this world in the middle of confusion or the darkness the voice of God screams and says whosoever heared my voice follow me and don't Harden your heart recogn in all your ways this voice that is continuing to scream is is is is the voice of the end time when all the elected ones needs to come to the Statue of a perfect man the uh a a mature Man in Christ is the only voice that prepares a bride for a Rapture if if they can maybe get ready I would like for you to cat to understand for me this message within the last three four months he he really dealt with me my heart and within the Deep portions of my heart gold to be able to recognize the voice of God in this generation if they can play if they can play that portion of tipe now and then we'll we'll finish up the church world don't know what to do the political world is in chaos everything seems to be in chaos fellas run from here something else rise up some jacket some coat when I was in Rome they got 19 different Vindicated nails that was drove in Jesus hand and there's only three but yet they've got the record at 19 different Nails Now what difference does it make who has a nail Christ never left US Nails To Worship he left us the Holy Spirit am by his word these signs shall follow them it believe they'll have the original nail they'll have these signs shall follow them at believe they'll belong to the denomination I started he started n see how the voice is contrary but these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils there's the word they shall speak with new tongues take up serpents that would not harm them they drink deadly things that would not bother them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and you watch these things plus all the rest of the scripture put together now that alone will not confirm it not at all there where we Pentecostals get on the wrong road did not Jesus Jesus say many will come to me in that day and say Lord have not I done Mighty things in your name have not I prophesied in your name have not I done all this in your name and Jesus said depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you do you see my sisters and my brothers why I'm so condemning and indicting this generation you might speak with tongue like man and Angels you might dance in the spirit all around the church that has nothing to do with it I've seen mohammad's dance around like that I've heard in the doctor witch doctor's Camp seen the witches stand up and speak in tongues and interpret it and tell exactly what was going to happen and it happened that way I seen even a pencil raise up and write in unknown tongues only one there could read it and was it the devil right you can't base your Eternal destination up on some sensation Satan can't impersonate any of those Sensations not it's to know Christ something changes in your life watch your life and pattern with the word and see where you're at taking inventory certainly in spite of all this impersonations false voices false prophets all these other things that's rising up Jesus still said in spite of all of this if any man would hear my voice and follow after me he is the word listen to his commission to us today and all these voices which I said it would take hours to bring out all these voices and it's confusing to the people it's a pathetic thing and after all you don't get the second chance you got to take it now you might not get a chance tonight you might not get a chance tomorrow it's now when you hear my voice Harden not your heart as in the days of provocation now is the time this is acceptable time that if any man will hear my voice that goes to show that his voice would still be there in the midst of all the chaos he still got a voice why his voice will ever remain here it is heavens and earth will pass away but my voice shall not pass away his word let's just take say another five minutes quickly can you will you stay that long a few minutes I I'll hurry let's just take some who heard this voice and obeyed it how it made them act what it made them to do I'm going to bypass a lot of of scripture here just in order to get the right straight to you how it changed their lives and all them that was about them how they become the Oddball we call an oddball every man that ever did believe God was considered an oddball because if you're in the trend of the world there's something wrong with you to be a Christian you have to be an oddball for all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions of the world he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not quickly now listen close to as we close Adam heard his voice in the cool of the evening and had fellowship with him there was no condemnation to Adam he heard the voice of God he said father now I lay me down to sleep and he laid down and Eve on his arm the line the tiger and the wild beast laid right around him there's no harm no way of getting sick no way of wondering if they wake up in the morning they're going to wake up Adam heard his voice in the way that he ought to have heard it but one day he heard his wife's voice I better leave that alone for a while but he listened to the wrong voice yet it was his wife life the closest tie had on Earth why didn't he like job thou speakest like a foolish woman if it would the whole human race would be living instead of dying it changed the course of human beings in time but he heard a voice of God he had fellowship with it but when he turned how did he know that his wife was wrong remember it was pleasant we think today that our organization church we think that our prosperity today is God smiling upon us it looks good it looked good when Micah stood there before the 400 prophets and the whole land belonged to him and the Philistines was on it or the syrians it looked good these prophets is telling go out there that belongs to us take it but it wasn't the voice of God Micah turned around and cursed the voice and how did he know to do that because his vision was exactly with the word that's the only way to trust it and see it today it's got to be on the word then did you notice after Adam listened to another Voice besides God's voice his own wife and the church is listening to the voice of her organization injecting into them Creeds instead of the word letting him live any way they want to as long as they go to church and a member of a certain church that's all matters closest connection that the believer has on Earth to them is the church CH but the believer the real believer the closest connection is the Holy Spirit and God's word so you find out that Adam realized his condition and he heard the voice of God calling again and he was in bigle but it was a voice of condemnation why have you done this I wonder if America today or the world in its religious uh uproar as it is in America swallow being swallowed up it'll be a national religion pretty soon who's setting before me I know it's tapes and it'll go all over the world we have Tape programs that every message takes the whole world in all other countries but if you'll look and see they're standing in fig leaves when the true voice of God comes out they don't know what to do about it it's confusing they don't know what to do quickly Noah heard the voice of God he was preparing to save his life and he followed the instructions and he stood if a man hears the voice now listen gets this real good don't fail if a man hears the voice of something and if it's proven to be the voice of God and on time and then that proceeds forth from the man heavens and earth will pass away but that word can't pass away Noah heard the voice and condemned the world and they laughed in his face because his his message didn't cope with their scientific achievements but it rained and destroyed the whole world his voice that went forth the seed was laying there every age it's been the same way Samuel alarmed when he heard the voice of God that he was go Hadad to condemn Eli the man that had nurtured him the man that had been a daddy to him and had raised him up and fatty Minister Brothers sha ministers many times upon their denominational grounds and Creeds their credentials in their pocket of the very happy the very organization that's nourished them and fed them and brought them up and position put them in church and put them in a congregation you have to knck down to what they teach see what a horrible thing it would be for a true servant of God to hear the voice of God and have to come back to that same mother organization say you're condemned because you don't receive this word what a thing it was hard for Samuel but he was a prophet he had to do it regardless of where heard or not he had to do it anyhow Moses heard the voice of God he was full of theology he know all the ins and outs but it failed he heard the voice of God Moses was never the same and no man is never the same you might hear in your ears the the voice speaking but when you hear in your heart that's it the voice speaking then you're hearing you do not see with your eyes you look with your eye you see with your heart you see something say I just don't see it you mean you don't understand it you do not hear with your ears you you hear with your heart many times your ears hears the true voice of God and it falls off you like water off of a duck's bag but when you really hear you hear with your heart and all the theology that Moses had he hadn't heard the voice of God but one day God called this 80y old sheep herder over to one side and spoke to him and he caught it he proved it he was God first thing he done to Moses is vindicate his word I'm going down I remember what I promised and this is what he promised for the last days amen it raise up a people from the Gentiles all the promises this I promised said Moses take off your shoes in other words honor it now throw down your staff and a a dry stick off the desert became a serpent and Moses caught it and went back to its condition again see he knew that was God because God said the word of God the word that he was speaking said so down the stick in your hand that's God's word don't try to do the same thing that ain't God's word to you that's God's word to Moses here's God's word to you throw down the stick it turned to a serpent then now you're afraid of it pick it up by the tail back at went again God's word to him what did he do God Vindicated his word I had a call here a few months ago about or it's been about a year over a year ago a little lady on the end of a telephone connection with a Baptist preacher and a Pentecostal preacher she said brother random the Lord has made me a prophet said fine said you know I'm told that you said that you you bore record that my Ministry was of God now I couldn't do that's contrary to the word so I said lady that's an error I don't even know you and the Baptist preacher I heard him I heard the Pentecostal preacher she said well I'm having a meeting here and said the Lord is doing great things I said I'm grateful for that she said uh I said has he ever told you anything yet said yes I've got a great program in hand I said wonderful I said now watch your program I said what did the Lord tell you he said go to Phoenix Arizona on a certain certain date and that I'm going to give you the lost Dutchman go mine and you're going to take this gold is found in there and you're going to sponsor missionaries around the world when we all know that the lost Dutchman mind is a legend so he said I said well I'll tell you how to find out whether it's God or not I said you be there on that day and if it's you find the lost judment mind then it's God if you don't find the lost that's your mind then repent and get that line Spirit off of you that's TR to find out Where's God or not God said Moses throw down a stick it'll turn to a serpent he did it he said pick it up it'll be a stick again he did it when God makes a promise of a Ministry in this last days he'll confirm it just exactly the way he said he would do it and you know you got the right voice you're listening to the right thing because it's the word being confirmed oh how I'm sorry I all right Moses acted different look what a a funny thing Moses done now always when you're following the voice of God you're crazy to the world the next day found Moses with his wife sitting on a mu and a young man on her hip or that's Souther child on her hip and there there was this old man with beard hanging down like this this bald head shining a stick in his hand leaving a little donkey going right down toward Jesus if as hard as he could go somebody said Moses where are you going going down to Egypt to take the thing over where with he had failed as a young man he failed as a military man but here he was going down to take over and he did it why he had heard the voice of God and seen it Vindicated for his day for the things that was to be in his day he saw it Paul a self- style Pharisee just as full of theology as he could be but one day he heard the voice of God he saw a pillar of fire and he know there was something different it changed his life no matter how many Pharisees how many G failures or anything else could cry out to Paul you're wrong you're wrong Paul had heard the voice of God he know it was a truth Peter religious as he could be keeping the traditions of the elders he would not eat any meat no sir he would have nothing to do about it at all he was really keeping the traditions of the elders right to the word what happened one day he heard the voice of God don't call that common unlean what I make clean he was a changed man he is ready to go anywhere the Lord sent him closing him I say this there was a man one time who was a Believer he'd been dead four days he was in the grave stinking rotten but he heard the voice of God speak Lazarus come forth and if it brought a man forth after being dead and rotten what ought to do to a church that still has life in it amen it ought to resurrect them in the mess of all these voices that we've talked about religious politics Hollywood all the false prophecies and things that's gone out in the midst of all of it the true voice of God will call a man that's dead in sin and trespasses to life again it ought to make a backslid church and call it to life again sure remember in closing I say this now I'll close Jesus said the time would come when all that was in the grave would hear the voice of God you're going to hear it no matter what condition you're in you're going to hear it anyhow and some of them that come out of the Grave will come to condemnation they hear the voice but it's condemning and if you hear today today after so long a time when you hear my voice Harden not your hearts as you did in the days of provocation if you Pentecostal people grouping yourself out in Creeds again in whirlin having a farm of Godless and denying the power thereof before you have to rise and the resurrection to be condemned because the voice of God that speaks to you now through the word will condemn you in that day if you're just a lukewarm believer the voice of God cries in your heart this morning you are a lukewarm believer you'd better repent you man women boys or girl that's not living for Christ and the voice of God speaks to you through his word and says stop doing that you better do it because you're going to hear it again one day and it'll condemn you you can't deny it it's speaking to you now and remember it's recorded and those who does right and hears his voice will rise the righteousness the glory the heaven hallu it's gold all of this message has to be flowing through our veins we have to become the word I'd like to share something that the Lord had placed on my heart uh and and all of this condition that we're living in all this house or chaos that we're living in a lot of times that our our spiritual condition is look warm and and the prophet says this in paragraph 107 it says that if you are just if you are just lukewarm believer the voice of God cries in your heart this morning you are a lukewarm believer you better repent you better repent the condition that the Lord gives us through his word and his message it tells us to be able to repent you must be born again and i' would like to read a quote from you must be born again paragraph 60 okay okay so you must be born again 1961 12:31 the morning service paragraph 50 if they can 60 paragraph 60 it says Jesus when he was here on Earth he said talking to Nicodemus here he said as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up so must why in the same manner for the same thing the same purpose to do the same work many times disposal people when they see the serpent representing Jesus the serpent represented Jesus in this much did you notice the serpent was dead there was no life in it Jesus died like came when he slew Abel Abel died on the altar with his sacrifice amen after Abel offered his sacrifice and killed his sacrifice for his sin then he died on the same altar with his sacrifice in order to be born again you have to sacrifice for his sin then he died on the same altar with his sacrifice in order to be born again you have to die on The Altar with your sacrifice just as dead as he was and you're born again the serpent had no life in it amen so the prophet says that we would have to bring the sacrifice to the altar to be able to be born again be to be a dead man and I'd like to read out of Romans chapter 12 verses 1 and two how listen it's the word of God if if we want to stop being lukewarm just like we said from the beginning there's a lot of voices there's a lot of influences the word god brings us back to the original condition we have have to obey or or or submit oursel to the word of God and and the word of the Lord says this I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable acceptable unto the Lord which is your reasonable service performed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is that that's good and acable and perfect will of God we we have to die so that Christ can be able to live inside of us that would be able to take flesh to be one and our B would be able to be a Living Sacrifice on the altar of God I'd like to just bring one more quote just because the word is so wonderful you must be born again another another another paragraph from you must be born again the same service 35 and now I'm saying this and I know it's going on tape and I want to say this to the pastors that will perhaps receive this tape I suppose may be just a little different from what the regular Church teaches it I teach and believe and belief can sufficiently prove by the scripture that you're born of the spirit and then baptized into the body by the holy spirit amen we are born in the spirit and and I'd like to read and with this we will uh close Ephesians chapter three I'm sorry okay chapter 4 from verse three and it says this and and endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of Peace there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism and God and the father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto everyone of us in given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he leted captiv captivity captive and gave gifts unto man now that he ascended what is but that but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended in the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might feel the thing all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and to some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ yeah that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slay of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive but speak it but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in All Things which is the head even Christ amen musici if the musicians can come like like like how we said earlier how we are born in the spirit and we are baptized into the body of christly through the Holy Spirit God God said this he he gave some Apostles some prophets for some evangelist some pastors some teachers now is the key please can you can you put it up please uh number 12 verse number 12 it's 40 40 important it's very very important for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ as as Prince were you able to catch that there we are vessels in the body of Christ and every one of us we have need of one another there's a lot of parts in the body but there's just one body the head is Christ and the head is Christ and the head is God and all the comes com from above from God all even the members and what he left in his word or in his mind I would read one once again for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ if the sister can play something Softly how wonderful is God what a great chance he gave us we didn't have no merit we didn't have nothing good inside of us that we were dead and our sins and trespasses we were you were without God but he had chosen us not for something that we are for but for what he is for this for this purpose for this thing God created all the conditions uh he gave us all that he was able to offer us all that we would have to do is just obey or or surrender to this world and to be able to live the word the way it is not perverted and original may the Lord bless you God bless you God bless [Applause] you let's stand

the fact that we're a body and we should care one for another and love one for another and be fitted together and you know what fits us together so beautifully is we all have the same attribute we all
