Jesus Christ we pray tonight amen amen [Music] we're gonna read two very familiar scripture reading let's read turn first in Psalm 27 and then we're gonna turn to another one a very very familiar scripture reading like I said I says the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life on whom shall I be afraid when the wicked have in mine enemy and my falls came upon me to eat up to eat up my flesh they stumble and fail though though in host should encamp against me my heart should not fear the war should arise against me in this will I be confident one thing if I desire of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the day in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple so David is basically saying the reason why he's confident is because of his heart desire the his confidence comes from the fact that he knows that anything that all that he desires is that he wants to dwell in the presence of God he is in one gold it doesn't want silver all that his heart is after is the presence of the Lord he says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret place of his tabernacle chellie hide me he shall set me upon a rock and and now shall mine had been lifted up above mine enemy around about me therefore I would offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing yay I will sing praise praises unto the Lord also let's turn to Genesis chapter 22 before we be seated Genesis chapter 22 I'm just gonna read it correctly from the printout that I had and verse 1 it says and it came to pass that after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Him Abram Abraham and he said Behold the year I am Here I am and he said take now D thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee unto the land of moja and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which I shall tell thee off and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and and clave the word for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place which the Lord had told him then one one of the third it says then one then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abraham sent unto his young man abide here with a ass and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come unto you and Abraham took the words and the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand in the knife and it went both both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said My father he said Here I am Here I am I he says my son he said behold the fire and the word but there but where is the lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both went both of them weren't together that's just my heads once again Lord we're so thankful to be gathered Lord to worship you we're so thankful Lord to hear the word even the word of prophecy father we could say tonight that we sit at the Brinks of things that we spoken many many years ago and now those things are becoming material before our eyes though it is such a comfort because when we see the things that we have heard in the natural becomes materialized Lord we know that there are other promises that are promised of the body change Lord one of these days those are also are going to become materialized and therefore we come before you and we call upon your name Lord that you come and you help us in this time because we have need of you we love you and commit everything we are to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you may have your seats before we get just deep into this I was thinking about just some of the things or pastors been talking about you know hopefully I could just echo some of them perhaps in a different direction but certainly want to echo some of the things we heard it's speaking about the great contrast that's being this ting in this just last couple of weeks and and life changed forever perhaps this will go away you know and and we'll get back to normal but but nevertheless than normal will not be normal anymore they're not sure if all people will be comfortable shaking hands or doing all kinds of things and you never know what's gonna happen after this because the events like this they stay they stay within people and their mind so I was just looking I went and I was looking just the different pandemics and things that has happened in history it's amazing just a number of things that has happened and taking places and how many people were affected I'll just go quickly through a couple of them so we don't waste a lot of time in 1915 and 20 there was what what is known as the smallpox and he killed about 56 million people in the 17th century there was what was known as the Great Plague it was about 3 million in the 1600 and then in the 18th century in the 1700s there was about 600,000 died in the Great Plague and then there was the cholera outbreak that killed about 1 million in 1817 until 1923 it was another one called the third plague that killed about 12 million in 18 and 55 the yellow fever in the late 1800s was between a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand the HIV from 19 and 81 until presently it's killed between 25 to 35 million now I want you to just realize these numbers just the massive numbers and you can even you know I was thinking how can you say between 25 and 35 million what happened to the ten million like somebody didn't count correctly oh you know how can you just give a number and you come to realize it was a great something that affected people greatly and and because of those things people live differently today people's behavior has been modified and and people's way of acting has been modified there was what was known as the Asian flu about 1.1 million this is in nineteen and fifty seven nineteen and fifty-eight the Hong Kong flu was in 1968 between 1968 and 1917 1970 it was about took about 1 million and then it was one that is named known as the Black Death it was about 200 million this is between the years of 13 47 and 13 and 51 so we could certainly realize that these these things they certainly have a pattern they come and they go and and and plugs they come and they go and they happen and the wonder we currently have it's they saying that there's about 700 and 8,000 people infected the death the total death is about thirty three hundred five hundred and twenty-nine and is about 150 thousand seven hundred and thirty-four people that have recovered so far so and we stole and the numbers are still counting you realize they saying that the unemployment rate in one month jumped between three point five percent to five point five percent in one month just in one month and it continues its continuing depending on what trajectory this takes you you think about the shortage of nurses and doctors they speaking about mobilizing and getting all the retired nurses and doctors back into work and because they need as much help as they could get and and and you think about even those though I was even trying to get the numbers about the nurses and the doctors that have been affected by this coronavirus and died there's a lot of people that have laid their life on the line and you think about the FEMA and the state mobilization the United States Corps of Engineers being mobilized do you think about just everybody invoking privileges even the president in voting privileges I've never been invoked since the Cold War and all kinds of things so you could certainly say that this is a time of crisis and we sit here and and and we certainly are affected by it we are affected by it not something that is just pretending to unbeliever or to believe it this is the whole wall that's being affected by it and and so you become to realize this is something that affects us all it affects people are being laid off of jobs and ICUs are filled with people you couldn't go to an emergency room they tell you not to go call your local doctor if you if you need a test you call your local doctor they tell you there's nothing for you to test right now and all so it's a time of great chaos and so I begin to think within my heart you know even as Christians what should be our role and what should be doing and and things like that and I began to think about the Bible and the scripture and about the great time of crisis that the Scriptures speak about and what God did in the great time of crisis when his children couple call upon him and so because it become something that I just was reasoning with in my own heart no doubt we you know we try to set this within the timeframe of the church and where we are and what time we live in in we understand that this is perhaps not clearly defined even that's why we say it is such a strange thing because we couldn't say it's necessarily the squeeze because you realize that this is affecting everybody they're not just searching down the churches you could see that and then you can see it's the perhaps the beginning of tribulation or things like that but you realize that the bride will not be here for the tribulation so it's something that it's very strange and and and and and we trying to figure out what's going on and what's happening but I want to say this as Christians our heart I always turned towards the Word of God and our hearts are always turned towards God and we need to make sure that everything that we are doing we are doing and we are being drawn back to the Word of God our pastor talked about it's time that we move forward in faith because we realize as we look at the statistics and this numbers the first thing that come upon people is fear or what's gonna happen we don't know what's happening tomorrow we don't know what's happening the next week and no one can tell you what's gonna happen two weeks from now and and so people are crippled and they don't know whether they should work or not working we know but we realize as Christians we don't walk by fear but we love my faith and then at the same time as the contrast is being drawn they said people as even as we heard this morning that have received a witness and they are walking with the witness that I've received you know I just don't want to get ahead of myself right now but we have to come to a place where we realize either God is God or it's not God if their God is what gonna do what they promised so it's not gonna do any promise and what makes them God is the fact that what he promised you will do that's what you'll do now so we as we looked at the statistics then we realize as our pastor spoke this morning we can say certainly without a doubt that even men the greatest invention of men is vanity you can look at the skyscrapers we fly into the air we have a man hanging into the sky we do all kinds of things were built highways and we have regretted some medicine areas and all kinds of things and we pride ourselves in the men's invention we learned from their technology and everything and yet something this small takes the whole thing apart fix the whole system of the economy or everything shuts down in a matter of weeks and it's just come to show you that everything that man does is temporal nothing man builds is permanent whatever that's why you cannot put your trust in man that scripture tells us to put trust in man is death but to put trust in God is life we cannot walk by them thinking of men and however easy it makes your lives that have been building up the cars and the houses the comfort that we get off of it and everything but we realize that everything that man does has an ending why because he has a beginning but we stand before one that we heard this morning is the very beginning of the creation of God in Frankfurt Burnham uses that scripture and he says it's not so much it's the beginning as in the beginning but it's a very beginner where it started it started in him he's the very originator it came out of him all of this in other word God didn't come and dwell into the world the world came out of God it wasn't that God came and he looked the world and he began to fix it no he created a pice word he spoke it into existence and and it's nothing that goes past him so I realized it's very important we're going to realize that nothing of men is permanent only the Word of God will stain the scripture tells us that heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away and we can certainly stand here the to life and say that this scripture is fulfilled because now here's everything that man has ever worked on passing away it's also amazing how you realize this economy the great economy that men build it almost runs in cycle every 10 years or so it comes to a cross and and people have to be rebuilt intent and change parts and do all kinds of things so they can run it again and and the next 10 years the crashes again and it seems everything that mint does seems to just never amount to anything because it comes to a very old so realize the Scriptures fixing in Ecclesiastes I'll just jump so we can get to where we're trying to go quickly it's fixing I'll just jump and read 1 and 9 it says the thing that had been it is that which shall be which which shall be and that's which is done is which shall be done there is no new things Under the Sun there's nothing new the epitomy epidemics and all of those things they sub salutely nothing new this has been and it's been before and infinitely the Lord tarries we go again for many more years there's gonna be another one show up why because it's the ways of man under the Sun under the Sun there's nothing permanent Under the Sun nothing is meant to be lasting Under the Sun everything is built to be temporary and infertility says I have seen all the works that I've had done under the Sun and behold all is vanity vexing of the Spirit that's all it is all it is is just a tormenting and and you you you you work happing all right you know just sitting at home and thinking how that often time yet we are people are disturbed and we are tempted by the fashion and the music and all kinds of things of the world and in times like this you realize how quickly all of those things perished you realize how none of those things matter at home you realize how the whole world is cramming down and and the things that become very important it's the very life of a person you come to a place where you begin to realize all that we built and all that we do it's absolutely nothing so as we spoke and I said you know God's provision in the time of crisis when we define crisis I began to think in this couple of definition I just stumble across and he just really spoke to my heart it's a time of an intense difficulty trouble or danger it says it's a turning point of a disease of a disease when an important important change takes place indicating either recovery or death it says what so basically it's a time when what the systems of man everything that man possesses after everything that they have doesn't work then you get into the time of crisis you know I was thinking even you know as perhaps at your trouble whatever you do you know there's protocols and there's things when the system is not functioning the way it's supposed to you know that this is the protocol that we follow and we'll go in and we'll do this and we'll type this and we'll type this and this by the time we get to this the system will have recovered now I'm speaking about at times now that men have tried all of the things that they have in the system and it's not working now that calls for crisis that goes for crisis when what you know well if we do this your work what you're doing doesn't work it's a crisis it shows that what I have it doesn't answer to the needs that I have in front of me what Lynne has doesn't answer to the needs that they have in front of them what men has they have applied and it looks like it's not working and I tell you that's why we're so happy to be as the children of God tonight and I can say it's time for us to call upon what we know will work why because God has given us the answer to all the devil's question in fact the Bible says the problem tells us in this endtime that the Word of God the revealed Word of God it says he will answer to the needs of the aged whatever they need is that what of God will answer to those things and I just want to say this this is a call for us to just be on alert because we don't understand what's happening and it's not a time for just to sit around and and try to just uh you know tally the numbers or try to figure out what they're gonna do next another time I believe that God has another lien of people that was that he wants to see come on the scene and begin to work this thing when malice fell they did because what the scripture tells us that the end of the the wisdom of man is the very beginning of the wisdom of God where man has come to an end it's time for God to come on the scene so I began to think about the crisis in the Garden of Eden God created his kingdom and he created his son to have dominion he began to create hear me even in the very own image that is and could do the very thing that God was doing and he came his son was coming and moving trees and moving mountain in and calling giving things name everything was perfect and then one day sin came in something that was not supposed to be there Krypton and then that same son who was able to move the mountain and move the trees he came he spoke the word and nothing changed in fact in other words what he had didn't work anymore in other words what he tried he could try to apply it didn't work anymore it was a time for crisis and it's good to tells us that God came down in time of crisis he didn't just let his son are all in the garden and just try to figure out its own way no he came on the scene for him the scripture tells us that God came on the Sun on the scene in other words Adam was here now he realized that he in fact the scripture tells us it was roots running away yeah yes leading a crisis manager and God shows on the scene and where there was sin God took the scene and he gave righteousness where there was death he took the death and he gave life and he came why because he's the Christ crisis manager that we know her and that's who we need to call on the sin and crisis manager one who just know how to work everything as I pastor said this morning one who can look at a carburetor and tell you I want you to push this button I want you to move this over here I want to remove why because he's the very designer of that so he says but about him speaks if you could just hear this in the message we would see Jesus he says so then if her crisis would arise at any time and God call and God was called upon the scene to act in other word now it's telling us that when crisis comes it's time to call God on the scene it's not time to just sit back and relax and wonder what's going to happen and I'll read a statement here perhaps after this show we could get there it says then said then God was calling the sin to act it says then the way that he would act the way that he acted that time he will have to act each time that way in order to be God because if God doesn't act a second time the way he did the first he says he knows more about the time he knows more about this then he does then he did wrong when he acted the first time he has he says he would have to act the same each time he says if the world is in need of a savior and I say this the world is in need of a savior the world that we living in is in need of a savior now when I just professed this with this we understand the messenger told us that United States and all the countries that they rejected this message and then judgment was pronounced upon them and we can even look at the type in Israel when Christ was there they came and they rejected him in fact they even looked at him and they say let us dead let your blood be upon us and our children and we realize that when Titus came she was fulfilled about everything that they called upon themselves so we can certainly look and see the type and everything but we realize that even the Prophet tells us that what God hates is the systems it's what man has put together but we realize in that system there are children of God that are stuck in there and events like this is for God to bring awareness because this is a wake-up call this is a time where God is calling upon his children is doing something that man doesn't understand what's happening he's sending something that they have completely clueless on what to deal with and in that time his children they have no way to go but to go back to him why because God uses events in order to attract these children like we heard in my Sunday what is the attraction and some hearing and there all kinds of crying and calling rosado signer so look at it and he says let these people shut up what are they but others recognized that he was fulfillment of prophecy well I trust that we can tonight realize that this is the fulfillment of prophecy God is coming and calling upon these children in order to attract their attention he says if sickness arose in the camp he says and God made an atonement for healing I'm sorry I skipped something I was reading it says the world is in need of Savior then if he presents us if we presented a savior before if he presented a savior sorry a way of a way of salvation in the Garden of Eden - a way of escape he has to continue to do that in order to be God in other words we couldn't call upon God today and he says I'm not gonna answer in other words we couldn't come to a need that we call upon God and he says he says I will do differently why because if it's God he's going to do exactly as he did all the other times that's a comfort to us so we can know that his word is true his word his promise is true its word I ain't - we heard this morning what he said he will do is what he's gonna do it doesn't matter what time and it doesn't matter if it was done in the beginning he didn't matter if he done in the middle if anybody shows up and call upon the same God God will answer according to his word Oh hallelujah so we realized that we are in the time of crisis he continues on it says this in the message looking unto Jesus he says you look the best armor that America has in the present crisis is god-fearing praying people it's not the atomic bomb it's not all that's happening out there it's not even what man is trying to build up is saying that you know the best armor that America has in this present crisis is god-fearing praying people that's the best it's worth more than all the bombs and the tanks that you could produce God will always fight for his people and when his people call upon his name God will come upon the same God is not abandoned that's how we can sit here and wonder is he gonna do or he said I'm gonna do it what's gonna happen oh yes that doctor really worked hard for him to find the cure or what is the nurse do what are the scientists doing in fact there's a lot of quartz step I've seen in brothers have sent around where he said that those medical and all those scientists that will know nothing about it he said that he talked about people disinfecting and doing all kinds of things and he says that the doctors will know nothing about it but here he is saying that but God's fearing people are the best armor that United States or that America can ever have if the whole nation with all one Accord would throw themselves to God in sackcloth and ashes and repent and come back to the old fashioned pathway that our forefather trod that it says they couldn't be a bit of phenom and her arm that could come to us in other words will harm us and I'll say this this prophecy this word of God is true tonight and because remember but on excessive rejected the fact is God didn't reject his word God God send this world and those that have rejected are the one that are ripping judgment but if there's anybody in the system right now that will take that at his word and what he has spoken here and will believe that word God will come upon me same for him yeah it's a system that has been designed to reject the Word of God but it's not the people but you look at the casualty that's why I said as believers we want to make sure that we are not shining like that witness that we heard about this morning that we are calling upon our Father it's the time of crisis because he has designed the crisis so the crisis can bring us close to him he says he says he says and I believe and I believe it will be worth more than all the ammunition plants and things that we could make that's right it says in all the pumps that we would have there's nothing as great as prayer God holds all future in his hands Oh future when we can understand it or not understand whether we know how to place it or don't know how to place it why don't we can explain it or don't explain it our future is in his hand that's all comes for tonight we are not left to just like that by Allah's help we have been given the greatest weapon that there is on the face of the earth God taking it and giving it in the believers hand so that when they call upon God by prayer on their knees that God will hear he says he says that someone asks me not long ago says but a Brenham do you think do you think about the future I said I do not know what the future holds but I know who holds the future that's the thing if you can if you can if I can keep acquaintance with him that's the thing that's what we want that's why we want to keep the connection we want to make connection back to home we want to make that connection and call upon God to come and assist us er I was reading how you know that you know there was I don't know how many hundreds of police officers they've been contaminated and just trying to do their job to separate people and to keep them in their homes and all of that and they got infected by the by the virus just by trying to do their job you think about all the nurses that have caught up in the firefight and doing all that they can and I believe it's time that we do all that we can as children of God so we can assess so that God can come on the scene so I realized it and I begin to think about this this is the time where the scripture says it's adoption time an adoption consists of one that has to be placed into a place and it's a timer that is God is calling upon the sons and daughters to come to a place where they can assume authority and that's why I said when we don't know we go to God when we know we go to God it's in every time they didn't say that just come to me when you understand what's going on he didn't say just come to me when you actually know what you asking for whether we know what we asking for we don't know we still go to him so he continues on he says wait he speaks on he says and why that's God led trouble come he says that God harnesses trouble and put bits in his mouth and makes it obey hell and those troubles they bring us close to a closer fellowship with him that's the purpose for all of this God is needing fellowship he's wanting to shake this world once again and if there be any child any son or any daughter somewhere perhaps a backslide perhaps the eyes that are here tonight and perhaps you that are listening and we could be caught in some things where there's no fool connections back home and you know we have this electronic device in this machines and everything especially all of the lessons the latest one that they're designing they have what they call a call home button in other words that button is yours when that system somehow gets in trouble when that system wherever it is it has to be able to call home if the system somehow cannot call home something is happening somebody's going to call you and tell you there's something wrong with the system it's designed that way with your call home and I believe accretion is designed the same way we have a called home button in order to be connected with God and when things are not working with press the call home button when something is wrong we place to call home button so now I want you now to realize here what brother Branham is saying now I want you to think about the crisis in Eden and all those things no this was a crisis to Adam this was in other word yes what he knew the things that it would say and this and she things happen now he's saying them and nothing is happening but under no means that was a crisis to God in other words what was the crisis to Adam was an opportunity for God to step in what was something that seemed complicated for Adam to not know which way should go or why he should do in fact he ran away and head on his fig leaf could not produce or help him to wipe away they say no was committed but all of that was it was an opportunity for God to step in for fellowship all of this is is an opportunity for us to get in greater fellowship with God all of this is is another place is another design from God so he can come down because he's the master system he created the whole system and nothing escapes him so the Prophet says it says then he says they had no Rimbaud until the flood came speaking about the contrast their appearances spoken but after Noah was pressed into that condition he was in to flood 40 days and 40 nights into the stone and then little Ark pitched up down in the water it was there it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow you know we would learn we wouldn't appreciate the rainbow if we saw the rainbow every day we were in appreciate the health as our passive smoke unless we got sick and then we learn to appreciate help we will live appreciative in the gathering of ourselves until something like this happened our selling my wife at home I said oh I'll tell you the Sunday that we all meet together the building is going to come down why because they will learn to appreciate well then to say Oh God God is a great God and perhaps it'll give us a sense of what is happening and what God is trying to do when he gets us together it will it will it would take something different such a contrast something to break it apart so that when you put it back together you realize what beauty lies into it often time we can't he just becomes like you know I gotta go to church again and you go and say you come back Sunday and people are coming you know they want a certain place to see it and they won't dare send this happening and the temperatures not just right and all those things I'll tell you this brings a brand new appreciation for all those things why because God is bringing the contrast I tell you people say that man created this earth this happening this happen this cannot happen unless God allows it as a children of God we don't attribute any success or any power to the devil well we know these everything that happens God's allowed and I believe we're gonna gather again I believe it will happen I believe this is not the end because according to the promise we see that it's there we live in the time of the perfection of perfecting of ourselves we have received the word and the word is here to pick out all the greens to remove all the worldliness had of us and to bring us in the rupture condition so we can go out of here and I believe just just reinforce those things so when we come back we are come with the zeal to know that I'm coming to the Word of God I'm coming to the house of God worship Him Peter speaks and he says wherein ye greatly rejoice through it it says though now for a season if you if need be you are help you have you are in heaviness through manifold temptation so now even our rejoicing the scripture doesn't say we're just forever on earth it says our rejoicing is only for a season we are just going to be happy-go-lucky every day just think seems to just go on and everything in fact is promising that they will come time when things going away that we don't worry to come it says too heavy he says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though through a trial adobe try be tried by fire must be found unto the praises and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ in other words where the trial comes whether temptation comes whatever comes my way I want to be found in a place where I'm worshipping Jesus Christ it says whom having not sinned ye love ye love in whom though ye now de now he seen him not yet believed and he rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul of which salvation the prophet have inquired and searched diligently will prophesy of the grace that should come unto you searching searching what or what or what manner of time the Spirit of God which was in them did signify when he testified beforehand the suffering of Christ and the glory that should follow so in other word it's it's all of these things the suffering and the things that are happening they are spoken to comment it says that before that's why we we love we look not on things that are down but we look on things that are above that's why we focus on the temporal thing we focus on the permanent things so having spoken on those things so now we find out that Abraham Gary was oh what a time of crisis here is that being asked to offer His only Son they're very testimony that God had given him something that is stood and above even up after 25 years he's stood there in the time of crisis but I want you to just realize for a moment what came out of every ham as a result of this crisis ever ahem testify that it was going to have a son that God was gonna give him a son and yeah yes after after 25 years he came and he receive a son from God but here he is God comes back and he says that I want you to offer me this son your only Son he calls him it says your only one son that I want that's the one I want her him loved him by obedience of the word of God ever ahem took the son and he began to go he took two servants with him he began to walk and I began to think perhaps if you asked Abraham do you know actually what's gonna happen when you get there he probably would've answered you I don't know I don't know oftentimes we we think if something is wrong when we don't know no God sometimes lives us instead like that where we don't understand and we don't know if we don't know it's okay just give it into his hand that's why I said when you know you give when you don't know you can so here he is walking and he gets to a place and he perhaps he realized what's about to happen and he didn't want any hindrance he didn't want anybody holding him perhaps had he taken this to service that we're gonna hold him from not doing it so he takes them and he says that I want you to wait here that I'm going further in other word when time came to a place where was became hard ever ham took another step by himself continue God ever ahem took a step in there in the way to obedience to what God told him to do so he came in and after they left just the two of them Isaac asked him he says father he says I see the fire I see the word but where's the offer he I don't believe that word was conquered or put together by Abraham himself this is God speaking out of Abraham because it's going to do the same thing he says that God will provide for himself a sacrifice I tell you my brother my sister we don't need to offer god sacrifices that he doesn't need what we need is to did God sacrifice that he has already offered for us in other words he's giving us away God is the one who gives a way of escape God is the one who provides away the lamb that was found in the thicket was there made by God it was not a man that put him there let's not put our man man's interpretation or I'll come up with their own plan on how we're gonna protect ourselves so how we need to barricade ourselves and blue toilet paper in this room and put food on another room and do all of that no let God be a provider people are acting despite of other people that today acting in a manner that that that they don't care about anybody anymore they're doing things for their protective skin they're doing things so they can preserve themselves you know I went to you know I send mass in a picture you know I went to I thought I thought I thought this was gonna pass and squig I thought you know I'll come back tomorrow I'll be able to get some toilet paper I went to Target we went to Walmart there was Allison I mean there was nothing and then I thought well we'll show up the next day next day the same thing I stood in line same thing I came to the realization man is trying to make provision for himself and I realized I told my wife I said if we go back to that store and bought every food that there is in there we're gonna run out still we're still gonna run out if it's absolutely impossible to buy in a manner that you will never need to go back and buy again so what behavior what is causing people to act this way fear self-preservation things that they they try to protect themselves in the children and they trying to look put themselves first and all those things but we realized that as children of God God has given us a provision in him and I'll tell you this we speak about the rumen of Celexa reptile how that she was about to make the last case and the Prophet told him to give it to him and he says that if you give it to him God will multiply it I'll say that in this time if God is to do that it will happen it will happen why because as we read in the time of crisis if God does differently from the way he's done a thousand thousands of years before then is not God a confidence into the fact that the way he did with the remai woman of Sara Tom the way he did in the years past he's gonna do the same with us tonight if he does any differently then it's not the same God I would just want to say this in closing we're just gonna get to this and then we'll close I was reading I thought this was a a very interesting story and you know it very well I'm not going to go through all of this one I'll just give the highlights so we could get to the end in second Kings chapter 3 we're just going to read 16 to 18 it says this is the scripture about that's the the story about the valley of ditches it says that in the sense that cells alone make a valley full of ditches for thus saith the Lord ye shall not see wind no shall I see rain yet the Valley shall be filled with water now I want you to understand what the Prophet is saying here something impossible he's specifically telling them you shall not see wind you shall not see rain but yet the the wells will be filled with water and says it shall be shall he shall see the Valley shall be filled with water but ye that ye may drink both he and your cattle and your your beasts your beasts and all this is on all this is but the light the light thing in the sight of the Lord you will you will he will deliver the Moabites also into your hands so if we can back up just a little bit it's a very interesting story because you come to realize yeah there are there was three kings Israel was broken up into pieces there was the king of Israel the king of Judah and the king of Edom they had came up the king of of we realized that ability I believe his name is Jehovah he was being the son of Ahab and Jezebel he was king and now he did things that are not good in the sight of the Lord and everything and we realized that after after a half pass away that the king of more abide the things that had place to do he didn't do anymore also they were getting ready to go to war so now the king I came and he gather up with he got together with your hos effect and they went and they got the king of Edom together so they can go to fight with the king of Moab so they came together and they took their army no doubt the army was strong and and and and and well-trained and the horses and whatever they were using at the time and everything so they can go to war so now they begin to walk and they find themselves in the valley one of the thing that Dunn's on them real quickly is that they don't have any water now I want you to think and I want you to equate it with what's happening today then here's the great army this is now they knew with no doubt that if you were to take those armies and match them against the army of the more pipe that they would win the war they had no doubt about it but one thing that they didn't think about it was water somehow in the system something seemed to be missing some somehow in the economy this great economy that they have built something seems to be missing and then they came to a place now they need something now I want you to realize how that domains begin to work now of course to hold them being an unbeliever began to think Oh perhaps this was all the plan all along he said well perhaps God want us to come here so the Moabites can come and kill us all so now we don't have water we don't have protection so now now that's the thinking of the unbelievers they begin to think well perhaps this is how the world is going to end perhaps this is the end of it all you know we thought the end was going to come this way or that way perhaps this is how we die now this is a great army that was built for war and this is the testimony then the scripture tells us now Jehoshaphat now I'll say this in their condition no doubt we know as we read the history that that bale that they had profits of bales we understand those things and and even some had sue sales people I could see and things like that and you realize that in the condition that their way in their soothsayers could not help them their scientists could not help them all the people could not help them no soothsayer could make water come from someplace no god of Bell was able to come and help them in this situation now I want you now to turn aside and think about their thinking of a believer Jehoshaphat stood and and here he is finding himself in the same predicament he looks and what comes to his mind is is there no profit that we can consult oh I'll tell you a sense of God daughters of God I tell you when we find ourselves in the fix there's only one place we can go and that's to consult the messenger what is God says about this what is the word said about this now this could be God doing what he wants to do but I just want to talk to him so you can let me tell whatever God's will is for whatever is happening my confidence is I want to talk to God and have him speak to me and put the peace within my heart the FPV is worried about where am I going to get the next roll of toilet paper is this how we're gonna die what's gonna be next how are we gonna shoot ourselves and do all kinds of things but yet the believer is wanting to know what is the word says what time I was specifically living in well how can I just go on knees on my knees in prayer because these are serious times this is not a job this is a serious time so listen to what brother Branham says he speaks about this he says he says he says in the message the prophet Elijah he says then we see that when the crisis is showed up just he says the crisis just came and he showed up who was who who was down in the heart in other words crisis revealed their character was it he says was yet a believer he says that was Jehoshaphat he said well here we have here we are with no water and the other king says I guess the more Biden sought us out here and now they're going to slay us all out here but you're hos affector believer now out kind of company I says he'd kind of come to himself and he says isn't there a prophet somewhere that we could consult that could consult the Lord it says that's pretty good idea don't don't you think so he says that could consult the Lord about this matter it says if you are injured in jeopardy here it says we're going to die or be defeated shouldn't we consult the Lord he says well if a nation or an army should consult the Lord at the time of trouble what about a cancer what about a cancer has gone into a corner it's got you in the corner TB has got you on the corner what when infection when when affliction got you in the corner don't give up let's consult the Lord about it and see what it has to say that's what it believeth us we consult the Lord what is it have the same he continues on it says maybe he says I'm a drunkard I'm a harlot I'm a I'm cursed from all my life he says don't give up let's go set the load about it and see what he says about it don't give up hope I don't care what your condition is that's why I said it don't matter if it's the wall the most ranked sinner if he can consult the love tonight if he can come and ask the Lord what is it that's happening God will speak to him that is no respecter of person he's not your justice gonna speak to this enough if you come to his word he's gonna speak to you now I want to say this now I want you to realize now Jehoshaphat in the time of crisis you see that the crisis were made always to bring the children of God closer in fellowship with him you can look at it in Jehoshaphat it drew him close to him now when they came to Elijah he looks at him and I want you to kind of just picture this for a moment they all came three and they stood before him and he looked at him he looked at your elbow he says that if he had not been shallow Jehoshaphat he said I wouldn't even stand here and talk to you in other word if he had not been for the children of God on this earth God will not even care what's happening out there if it had not been for a believer somewhere God will turn its back because remember once we are lifted up from this earth there's nothing left because we are here God is giving us the power to change the circumstances that's what I'm thinking about tonight we can even look at ourselves as Hester and say each such a time like this I tell you there's nothing that rings true in the heart of the believer than to see God come on the scene he says if he was not what you're hos effect I would even look at you because it was Roth and we realized they called so they can play music to just come a little bit and I want to remind you now as our pastor said this morning and that's the music began to pray he began to enter into another spirit he began to enter into the vision and the vision began to manifest something and out of the vision out of the spirit they were able to draw the Word of God and he came and he gave them the word for that time and I believe with all my heart if we can enter into prayer enter into that spirit and let the spirit lead us God is going to speak to us about what he's gonna do in this hour God is going to show us it's going to comfort his children God is going to come on the scene and show us and speak to us the answer that we are looking for God has not left us alone so he says well brother Branham I'll try I tried for six years to be born again of the Spirit of God to receive the Holy Spirit I've never yet come to it never yet come to me he says well let's try again tonight I tell you no one should be in despair no one should feel left out God has not left to anybody I don't care if it's the ring that's why we are the light of the word I believe this is a perfect opportunity if somebody walked up to you and begin to talk about all of the confusion that's coming out and all this one says let's do this no one says that to this this is the time that you can bring them to the scripture says my friend they said there's a source here this sauce never changes when all the effects outside change this has never changed it says let's try again tonight see what the Lord says oh I want to hear what the Lord says I really want to hear what he says I really want to hear from the throne of God he says for is always willing if we just get everything out to his way I'll skip just so I could get to the end but when I'm says he speaks about Lazarus he says Martha and Mary after leaving the church and Lazarus they had believed on Jesus and Jesus walked away from them now order to think they left the church because of Jesus so they can support his ministry and Lazarus was known as Jesus body they went in fact I think I heard somewhere that even as you as it was walking when he went to be baptized by John Lazarus was there it says and they had believed on Jesus and Jesus walked away from them in the crisis he says when the body was sick then the body got sick and Jesus left that way that way her that was horrible and I'll I'll send I'll send for him he wouldn't come he went father and they sent for him again he still didn't come and I was still worse and then after all hope was gone then Lazarus died and they buried in the grave for four days and after decayed think about crisis think about crisis the person are you you prayed you did this you went here do what look for him send people go anyone far away you went and now the person is gone you probably was wishing before we could bury him just if I could see him it will do something and now you have him in the tomb earth 1st 2nd 3rd 4th after decaying it says and the darkest hour all hope all hopes gone and everything else then Jesus came along at that time he says heart trouble nothing hard for God he just healed all kinds of diseases he says God bless you you go on your Road rejoicing and be happy and you had some and if you had something just keep on moving God's made all well all of you well and you will make every person well in the building right now and I want to say even online if you will believe him if you believe him and stand on your feet for a minute God is our refuge in our strength the very present help in terms of need the crisis is on the battle is on raise up your hand and touch the lifeline now and move with him and Jesus in Jesus name and receive it he says here I hope I hope you see it it says the character of Pentecost and Baptists and Presbyterians Church our character should have should have us put into a place where we can when we can be found in the office to meet the crisis of this hour we are called the bread of Christ we have been put to meet the crisis of this hour the scripture tells us that we are the final voice to the final age we have nothing to fear we have been put here for such a time as there it says that we are in what a shame we are but he says but God but but but will God answer in any time of crisis he asked a question he will not it will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of crisis if the people assemble themselves together no matter what no ma no matter if two or three whatever it is and pray there he said he will hear from heaven I want to say this just in closing let's use our weapons but what brother David said this morning that we cannot just look at the promises laying there and say that we have them what I'm saying is let's by way of prayer pull down upon those promises and have them become a reality for us Jehoshaphat because of Jehoshaphat Jeroboam and the king of Edom were saved yes because he said if it was not for Jehoshaphat he wouldn't have been talked to the others and I believe because of you and I because of the right God can come and talk and move again why because you are still here because this is not what was promised this came and he can give us an answer to it let's all stand Sbarro's our gracious father Lord what an hour but I heard that there was believers in Europe I heard that there was one in ICU and another was infected [Music] let all the churches closed and everything and look we move by faith as our pastor told us we move in the time of great contrast we have a promise and we have a witness Lord we just want to lift up our voices in each one hiding in their closet and just calling upon the name of the Lord Georgia prophet tells us that it's prayer that takes those promises and makes them a reality when we call upon the name of the Lord he says we don't pray until those promises comes to be Lord we lift our hands tonight and say father that we are concerned about our fellow man we are concerned about those nurses and doctors and all those people that are deployed and blood if you if they would ask us to do something Lord not no doubt will jump to it to help our fellow man but we know that the true answer comes from you O God therefore we lift up on our hands and we say Lord this is our time of crisis why don't you just come on God as you came all the other times and help your people Lord we're so thankful to be called sons and daughters to you and Lord now we bring our sonship and I and all that you've called us Lord we laid upon the table look like Esther going in and said that I will go in for the sake of the people though that we may go into and for the sake of the people help us Lord and where we have fair load we want to be right this is a perfect thing time if we don't have the Holy Spirit Lord give it to us tonight whatever we have we lacking we've come tonight to receive from you Lord that we may be found in the fall we're so thankful Lord we commit everything we are to you and ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] amen help me sing this I'm not a very good singer but that'll be singing we are the generation [Music] amen like Billy told us tonight that were the ones that were placed here at this time amen and the Lord Jesus said no man lighted the candle and put it under a bushel basket but he sets it up on the hill that it could give light who does it give light to those that need the light amen no I mean our spirits be of such faith that people inquire and when they have no faith may our testimony be to share with them there is a fountain I just thought that was wonderful tonight I think it surely points to us the reason that we need to seek out the Spirit of God in our life each one of us is believers at home those that are here to sit back and and find out what our part is to play what our attitude what our nature what words that we should have on our tongue and I thought it was such a beautiful thought that this would be fruitful amen that it would drive people to inquire is there hope in the land yes there's faith in the land Amen there's a people in the land that will pray for you there's a people in the land that'll help you there's a people in the land that'll get you to the fountain amen let us really trust the Lord that that we can really have a testimony in this hour that reflects it brother Billy that was just absolutely beautiful I really enjoyed it and praise God I can go home and watch it again hey man I'm gonna see it from the front this time hey man let's help this thing this little course that cosmos playing a man hey man you are [Music] [Applause] I worship you I worship [Music] our [Music] I worship [Music] I was [Music] my god [Music] I I [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are the light of the

this building down I'm gonna jumped out of my seat a man I'm longing for the body to come back together and seek that 34th song together hey come magnify the Lord with me I'm looking for that day hey man they're not gonna hold us down forever amen if you have prayer requests it's home you can either call my house or email me or sister Leslie or call the Deacons and we'll mention your prayer request amen let's pray one for another pray for me for we just need the Holy Spirit to lead us through this time minister our heads our gracious Father we've heard a wonderful word mother telling us that we're not alone telling us that we have a God of promise and said he wouldn't leave us but that he would keep us that nothing could pluck us out of the palm of your hand and if you started a work in us that you had finish it till the end and Lord we rest now and we believe it with all of our hearts father that we have a part to play in this the bride worldwide has a part to play in it and father it's just there to be there to spread this gospel that the last ones may start coming in then it would cause transition in people's lives those that have back slid over the years father that know this message and they've got away from it father may something burn back in their heart like the prodigal son and they may say I may I return home because back in my father's house there is life
