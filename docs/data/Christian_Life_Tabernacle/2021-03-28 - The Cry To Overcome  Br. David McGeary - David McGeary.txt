have you with us amanda's invited by the mic for so i'm reading this morning god bless you you know i think we've talked before about how the book of psalms is so much like kind of getting a little bit of a glimpse into the prayer diary of a great warrior of the faith david you know when i was reading the other day and it occurred to me that we we have a a tendency to read the stories of these old bible heroes you know david moses abraham some of these others and you know they they tend to become larger than life we tend to kind of lionize them or raise put them up on a pedestal as almost like they're supermen like they have a walk or they have a you know they had a an existence that is so much higher so much greater so much unattainable to us you know i think that's how the human mind works and that's you know the devil is a master at manipulating the human mind but you know one of the traps is we tend to look at individuals who god has been able to perform a work in or perform a work through and somehow put that out of reach well i can't happen to me because that was abraham because that was david you know we we'll sit here and we look at all these great experiences that they have and how could that ever be how could i ever have have a walk like that but what we don't see we forget is is that between each of these testimonies each of these events there's a time between those testimonies that we don't necessarily see you know if you look in the scriptures for example at the mighty hero of faith noah the entire the entire events that we read about in the bible about him occurred in the space of about one year out of 950 years that he lived you look at somebody like abraham who's a great father of the faith and if you look at each one of the events taken together it might be 30 some odd days of incidents recorded over his span of 175 years you know even jesus who is tempted in all points such as we are the scriptures only capture just really a handful of days and weeks out of his lifetime but you know the rest of that time is that time between the testimonies the time that they just had to walk the regular life which is not so different than ours you know what i like about psalm 28 we're going to look at that this morning is it gives us a glimpse into that time between the testimonies for david you know we don't know what it was he was struggling with as he's crying out before the lord doesn't really go into specifics about what his need was at that hour but what you can tell is he had a need and it says in verse 1 it says unto thee will i cry o lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou be silent to me i become like them that go down into the pit you know regardless of what his need was david was crying out to the lord for one thing that he might hear from him that he might hear a word from the lord and that really is the one thing here that makes him different from everyone else is is that he had a desire to hear that word and he cried out for it in verse 2 he says hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle you know that word oracle there in the hebrew refers to the place where god dwells and speaks and even webster's dictionary says it's a it's a place a shrine if you will in which deity reveals hidden knowledge or divine purpose i thought that was pretty good that it used the word reveals you know there was that place that david sought that he could lay hold of him and hear the word that he needed in his hour for his knee and that was the cry of his heart that's what he was asking for and that's a glimpse at the time between the testimonies that every single one of these individuals in the scriptures had they had a need and they laid it before him with the expectation that they might hear from him because they knew when they heard from him that word that thus saith the lord it was as good as done you know it's if we finish out psalm 28 there's a turning point somewhere between verse 5 and verse 6 where he received what he was looking for his crying out to the lord turned into verse 6 blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications my heart trusted in him verse 7 and i am helped you know he got to that need in that day-to-day walk that time between the testimonies that time between the great events where all he did was go before the lord that he might hear thus saith the lord for his knee and he cried out to the lord and when he got it it was as good as done that's the that's the time between the testimonies did it was it true that these men of the scriptures these great heroes might have had something that others didn't have yeah they did they had thus saith the lord and that's no different than anyone here in this room you know we're no different than them and that time between the testimonies where we lay it before the lord that we might hear thus saith the lord for our need for our time for our hour and when we hear it it's as good as done it's just a matter of time at that point let's go ahead and read psalm 28 together you know as an example of the time between the testimonies which hopefully will sound familiar to all of us let's read that together unto thee will i cry o lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou be silent to me i become like them that go down into the pit hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbors but mischief is in their hearts give them according to their deeds and according to the wickedness of their endeavors give them after the work of their hands render to them their desert because they regard not the works of the lord nor the operation of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoices and with my song will i praise him the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed save thy people and bless thine inheritance feed them also and lift them up forever amen god bless you i have your seats man that's it that's why we praise him that's what we're seeing

situations that father they need direction in their life we ask that you provide a way father we pray that you'd minister to us this morning and our needs for were needy people we ask these things today in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning if you have your bibles let's turn into the book of revelations and the um uh third chapter of the book of revelations and to the 20th verse and so and if we would have a title today um for what's on our heart to share with you it would be called the cry to overcome the cry to overcome and and we're going to go about it kind of in a long way so if you stay with me we'll we'll get there we may not be long we may be long i don't know i do have a few brothers that i know are always longer in me so i take great comfort in them so but anyway i just about my trip my mother's just doing wonderful she'll be 99 in july and you know i walked around the block with her and she walks up i don't know almost a quarter half a mile every day and she still cooks for herself and for me so it's really uh marvelous that god's been good i i can look down the road and you know i don't know how many years she has but i know she doesn't have many years ahead of her as she does behind her and i hope the same is for us when it comes to the rapture amen let's read these scriptures this morning behold i stand at the door and knock do you believe god's doing that i do if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame ammon set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches and so this is the question to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne therefore i feel in our hearts we have a cry to overcome father bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated uh the cry to overcome and you know i believe in when i talk with people and even within my own self uh i i there's just something within our hearts i hear it from everybody that we want to do better we want to be closer to god we uh we want to have victories that in in our lives and and we want to overcome or we want to conquer or climb above the places that we are and we know the scripture tells us that sin so easily besets us in other words a lot of times we end up returning back to the things that we've come out of and we have a term for that and that's called to back slide and what backslide means is to return to old ways and to return back to things that we've previously done sort of like these many lazarus resurrections that we have in our lives you know where all of a sudden we decide that we're gonna do a start all over again and we find out that turning a new leaf never works so we want to talk this morning about what does work i want to overcome and i realized that the prophet of god addressed this in several different services one of the messages he preaches is how can i overcome and he said in that message he said it's not what you overcome it's how that you overcome and so we're going to approach it this morning through the sermon called a man running from the presence of the lord and we'll listen to 17 minutes of that but i want us to understand that the cry to overcome is not something that we create within ourselves and so i i don't know if you can find this on the uh on the computer and post it on the board i don't have the paragraph number for it but it's in the message uh the easter seal and uh brother branham makes this a statement and i want to read it slowly to you so that you can think of it in the increments that it's placed out there i really believe that brother brandon ministers in building blocks that he lays something down and if he can establish that in your heart in your mind he will build upon that and and you say well does he do that well the scripture says word upon word lying upon line so that you've got to have a firm foundation to build your life in and that's what the mental battle is and the battle we fight the battle is for the foundation that you build on the scripture says every man buildeth but let every man watch what foundation he builds on because without a firm foundation the building won't stand the scripture refers to it as untempered mortar and so even with our young people and people as they develop and they're developing their thinking their likes and their taste there's a battle for that foundation what you're going to build on the principles that you're going to set in your heart and of course our hearts desire as ministers and as brothers and sisters and as a body we want our foundation to be the word of god because the word of god is what keeps us all equal there's no big eyes no little use no bond nor free june or greek male nor female in christ jesus for we are all his and he is gods and and so if we can have the understand that this is the battle in the mind is the fight for what you're going to build on so if satan can put a complex in your life then you start building your whole life upon that complex you know i mean everything about you someone could make you self-conscious in your whole life you live to be self-conscious you know what i'm saying and and uh so it it it this this battle is always going on but i i really honestly feel that there's there's a cry in the church to overcome and i believe this cry is caused by something so this is what the prophet of god said he said the holy spirit today is hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message so in other words we we have to understand that the holy spirit is hunting okay so you know you understand what you do when you hunt you look for something you track it down you find it okay so if i could say it this way this morning the holy spirit is after you amen he is going to hunt you down we go hunting and we set up camp and and and then we get out on our binoculars and we look over the hills and see if we can find the game and then we walk through the woods you know like this just hunting down you know and and to sneak up well he don't need to sneak up on you okay so he's coming after us okay so what we don't want to do is we don't want to what run and this is this message is running from the presence of the lord a man running from the presence of the lord and so the holy spirit is hunting honest hearts that will believe that message everything in the bible that was promised is to that believer and so part of our cry to overcome is a cry of possession you are saying i want everything that god's got for me i want to overcome and do away with everything in my life that's keeping me from having everything that god promised us so they emphasize this again that is the spirit that the holy spirit is dealing with us that's how his holy spirit is working on us now to make us hunger and thirst after righteousness to make us want to possess the promises of god want us to have everything that god wants for us we want to have so if it's something that's burning within our hearts and our minds to uh to have this and we don't even realize it's like something that's down inside of us all of a sudden we become dissatisfied with things that are not of god and and and that battle is is is raging now uh for control satan doesn't want to give you up and uh and uh and yeah and so there there's a a a path that's provided in god's word for us to obtain the things that god has for us to obtain so if you're going to reach this pinnacle of this faith there's certain things that that are required of us to do certain attitudes certain actions and so as he goes on here he says to the believer and when you accept it in its fullness then god knows that you will do it he knows you're going to do it okay now it like he told paul it's hard to kick against the prick isn't it paul but i'm going to show you all the things you're going to suffer for my namesake so keep running paul keep doing what you're doing but i know what you're going to do you are going to bring my message to the gentiles and if i have to blind you and i have to put you on the backside of the desert i will blind you and put you on the backside of the desert but i have a predestinated will that i want to perform in you now we've taught that so we understand that so and he goes on to read he says then god knows that you'll do it he gives you the abstract to that then every promise that is made is in your possession and the holy spirit has to quicken that to you now that's kind of a funny statement he says not will or can he has to quicken that to you if he hunts you down and he seeks you out and because he wants he knows that you're his just like the eagle looking for the thing then he has to quicken that to you you understand he has to give you the revelation of it he has to give you the power to transform into uh what that he has in his heart and mind for you so the point that i'm trying to make here is that the cry within us to overcome is something that is being caused by the move of the holy spirit in the day that we're living in so okay we've got to come in contact with the hour recognize the hour and recognize what it is that god is trying to fulfill in our lives as individuals as a church as a representation of his gospel that that there's there's he's got like as our brothers have preached well we were on this great pattern of god that he's trying to fulfill and he said he has to quicken that to you oh my what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see god's great holy spirit here to do that uh power think of it to see that the holy spirit is here to do that power what power is he talking about that power to quicken that power to hunt that power to find you that power to bring it to pass in you just think he says how wonderful it is that the holy spirit here is here to perform that power amen the holy spirit is here to do that power i always believed that brother ben had ways of saying things that could not be misconstrued to the ear that has been here to hear he said the holy spirit is here to do that power think of it the holy spirit itself is here to bear record of this hour jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out of there you can't take the fact out the holy spirit's here working calling hunting quickening revealing and doing what he's doing amen these signs shall follow them that believe that is the assurance and now listen when we see a group of people sitting together and those signs manifesting themselves that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that's the property of god amen so we are easter also amen we are easter also so what was easter was the resurrection we are in a resurrection also we are in a transformation we are in a changing we are in an exodus so we don't want to ever take this message and believe it's like something historical that god has done so what he's saying we are part of the hunt we are part of the manifestation we are part of what god's doing uh what what god's doing part of the quickening who that he's quickening so these great things are working within us you may be suffering you may have an illness you may have something in your body but yet that resurrecting life is still working towards that healing amen the the very quickening power of it and the bringing to pass of the power of it it has its day of manifestation so that's what we look to we look to the day of manifestation just like looking at a man that's ill if your body is ill he says put a vision of a healthy you and then walk towards that walk towards that that that's what that's what you believe you take the faith you have what you believe you place that vision towards you and that's what you confess you don't confess what you are you confess what you will be we don't confess what we are we confess what he's going to make us because our faith testifies of what that he said that we would be abraham testified of a baby he testified to that baby coming by sarah that's what he testified to although he couldn't see it yet he believed god for it and so then he knew that god had to quicken that and so the hunger that's in your heart the desire that you have to overcome the the cry that's in us i don't want to be backslid i don't want to have this habit i don't want to keep doing this i don't keep wanting to watch that stuff on the computer i don't want to feel this way toward my neighbor i i'm tired of the way i am i uh you know i i don't want to be embarrassed all these great things is the cry within you to overcome now it may not be a a a cry from your mouth that you're speaking it but you know when you find yourself in the hour of failure that there's something that's still in you christ i want to overcome this [Music] i want to be free from this i want to do better and and you know and the flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these two are contrary to another what i think that we've got to come to our realization and understanding that that very cry within you to overcome is the spirit of god working on you because he's going to perform that but he he in any time of fellowship he wants you to participate in what the transformation is he wants to quicken it to you or enlighten it to you paul prayed that that our understanding might be an increase that we might have an understanding of the hand of god and the way that god works you know most of the unbelievers that read this message that's what they're trying to find they're trying to find how did brother branham do this you know and they try to take his faith and the things that he used to faith to see if they can reproduce that faith but brother branham wasn't producing miracles he was producing a bride he says now we are easter also amen we are now in our easter so we are in the hour of our overcoming this is where we are i i don't i feel that he's standing at the door knocking and see him that overcometh look if to him that overcometh is going to sit on the throne then any true believers crying out i want to overcome because overcoming's the way to the throne so there's a great cried overcome he's already raised hallelujah from the things of the world to the things of god's promise right so let's go back and read that again we are now in our easter we have already raised hallelujah from the things of the world to the things of god's promise not we will we are it's the potential the potential it's god's promise he will pour out his spirit in the last day and that's what they would do you see it he said so we're crying because we have the promise that he'll pour out his spirit in this last day and that's what we will do we will overcome we will overcome the cry to overcome is is working within us now so we have that promise of what that we will do so this morning that's what that we're wanting to look at because we if we're not going forward we're backsliding and that that's what we want to come to a greater realization of to this morning is how do we go forward okay because to go forward is to overcome to go forward is to overcome you don't finish the job if you don't keep working at it and if you get distracted from a job you've got to return back to it and so we understand that being backslid means to to go back to to our old ways to go back to habits to go back to things that we felt that we overcame but there there's uh i think an understanding and and that's what i want to listen to these next 17 minutes for is so we can build a little bit and receive from uh the word of god something that's very very important to the age and the hour we're in so this cry to overcome is going to cause us to come in contact and uh that's sort of what we'd like to lay out there today i i believe that this message is one that people from any faith or any belief can read it and understand it and glean things from it but i also believe that there are special things that's hid within it that are only for his children you know they're they're they're things that are for you and and uh so we're addressing this morning this desire in our heart this cry to overcome i don't think i'm the only person that has maybe i'm the only person in here that needs to overcome you know what i mean but i think it's i think it's almost on every heart of any brother that i come in contact with we look at ourselves and we say yuck that's right you know and that's what we'll see so let's listen and work and uh if you have your bibles uh uh and you'll turn over into the uh i'll give you the scripture here and i i believe it's in [Music] the book of jonah and uh i don't i don't have the verse wrote down here but if you go to the book of jonah um then um we'll find the scripture reading that we have and it says now the word of the lord came to jonah and i got my i'm trying my new bible out here uh preaching from it and all right well it's in your bible somewhere anyway i can't find where's my book at joan at where's joan adams jerk i love answer like that just like obadiah where's obadiah all right i know it's in there all right let's stand if you found the book of jonah that and uh so we'll we'll start listening to the tape and when and uh when uh brother brahms done reading the the scripture and he says isn't that a sad ending we'll go ahead and take our seat so brother says for 17 minutes let's listen to what our messenger said and then let's take a little lesson from it this morning amen remember the holy spirit is the one that's dealing with your heart and calling you and and hunting you down because it's given to the overcomer amen the cry to overcome god bless you uh many of you in your bibles i want you to turn to the book of jonah it's uh we always talk so much about jonah being a backslidden and everything i've always talked up for john i do not believe that jonah was backslidden uh do not believe that i believe it's just we just sometimes use it say he's a jonah but if we i've already spoke on it in another way and telling how that i thought jonah what talked place now the word of the lord came to jonah the son of amira saying arise and go to nineveh that great city cry out against it for their wickedness has come up before me but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord isn't that a sad ending a man running from the presence of the lord and that's my subject now first we want to think of this jonah was the reason the principal reason that i believe that he did this great thing here was because jonah was a jew and he was asked to go to a gentile city to cry out against it thinking that he would not be received because the gentiles would think what's this jew got to do with us but you see another thing it gives us a great thing here to see that god not only is god of the jew but he's god also of the he's god of all people he just chose the jews the jews was called god's chosen people they were chosen for a pacific cause and that cause was to give to them the law and they could not keep it and he just showed by that people that the law could not be kept and if he was a uh a god of righteousness and the law demanded righteousness but there was no grace in law to bring a man out no penalty was paid by the law but it taken grace to pay that penalty or the war the law put us under and jonah here was called on as this one of the minor prophets of the bible to go down to this city and here we find an example of all of us every one of us we always are running from something we run from trouble we run from responsibilities we we're all prone to do that we we we're more prone to run and we are to stand and face it out see we just we we find ourselves running sometimes we find ourselves prone to run from work we don't want to we don't want to work some people just think they can make their living without working but i think solomon it was and said we could find uh here the answer i'm watching an ant you know a little ant they tell me if that every ant doesn't work and lay in that aunt doesn't eat that winter either so everybody has to to work we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody's got to face a certain responsibility when you when you come to choose your wife to get married or choose your husband you you've got to take a responsibility and then you must remember maybe you build a home it's a nice pretty home and then remember as a married woman you've got to think of the responsibility of raising children you got to think of that pretty slick walls are going to have little dirty handprints all over them then you got the responsibility of educating your children you got the responsibility of clothing and feeding everything is a responsibility and so easy when responsibilities faces to shirk from them and we find out that marriage is a responsibility in all matters even many times we find this is hard to say but it's true that ministers many times shirt a responsibility or standing for the true word of god when they're confronted with it they'll shirk that responsibility when truth of the word of god is brought face to face with we human beings we have we're prone to shirt back until the last resource i just got through talking to my little nephew up there he's a catholic and he uh now baptized that boy in the name of jesus christ here a few years ago and he got with some little girl and turned catholic and i held his mother's hand while she was dying over there she said to me the last words take care of melvin and he's just been dreaming dreams he just can't every every day the last week he's been dreaming dreams said i walk into your church uncle bill you're standing there preaching out run up to start to make your confession i'd wake up he said i i've been wrong i said melvin you don't need no interpretation for that your place is down there where you belong that's right i think but the face up to responsibilities sometimes it takes to very hide off of us to do that as a father to face up the responsibility to give you a child a weapon them little fellas you don't want to do that but as a father a mother you've got to face a responsibility of raising that child because the bible said spare the rod you spoil your son and that still stands good in the sight of every psychologist there is in a world that still remains god's truth if there'd been more of that practice and we wouldn't have had so much juvenile delinquency and stuff in the rot we got in the world today but the old golden rule of the homes been broken a long time ago and let the kids do whatever they want to but even as i said ministers they'll come face to face with truth and then walk away from it see they're they're just ha this seems like there's something that they they don't want to face up to it many times i've had people come say i know that's right brother branham but if i did that they kicked me out of the church whatever if you don't you're going to kick you out up there so you got to be kicked out somewhere see so you might as well face up to it instead of running from it say well i'll go over here i won't go back go back sure listen to some more of it search the scriptures jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me but we find that people won't face up with that being brought to uh into the presence of god and see when god made a promise and god has obligated that promise and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up to the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour we find that everywhere how about you lutherans how many lutherans was afraid uh people was afraid to face up to luther's truth when he come forth with justification look what it cost you maybe your own life to come out and confess jesus christ and and become a a lutheran look at you methodist how it used to be you all were called holy rollers i guess you know that and they get another spirit and jerk back and forth and they said they had the jerks the myth that no that ain't pentecostal that was methodist long years ago and they jerked and shook and fell under the power of god and it throwed water in their faces and fanned him with fans thought they passed out and now you were considered a bunch of holy rollers but you had your mothers and fathers had to either accept it face up to the truth and facts or turn her down what about you pentecostals that receive the restoration of the gifts when the baptism the holy ghost come out with speaking in tongues and the gifts of the spirit coming back in the church well the methodists wanted to kick you out and they did do it but you had to face up to it it's something you had to do what about the issue when it come out about the baptism in the name of jesus christ and you saw it was the truth you have to face up to it or do something about it you've got a responsibility everybody has and you must face up to these things all right and when you see that in this day now when the word of god has made these promises of things that we see happening now then we've got the responsibility to either face up to it or get away from it you have you just can't stay neutral you've got to do something about it since some moves got to be made you can't come in that church door and go out the same person you come in you're either further away or closer to god every time you come in or go out there oh how easy it is for people to shirt these things now i want us to think of these when we start into the official uh services tomorrow night that i want you to notice when something is confronted if you if there's a question about it if there's a question about it there's got to be an answer say for instance i said i was going west and you pointed me this way well the first thing you know i run plumber past my target and i'm too i'm northwest well while somebody points me down this way to go that way i'll pass my target again i went southwest well as long as there's a question which way is west there's got to be a direct answer somewhere and when these questions confront us about the bible truths there's got to be the right answer somewhere right there's got to be there and when we see something presented i think instead of just run away it's all nonsense i couldn't believe a thing like that i couldn't believe that why don't you take the bible and sit down and face up to it study it you're here in the meeting now just look it over check it out yourself with the word check the word by the word that's the only way to make it tell the truth and it must tell the truth from genesis or revelation christ is a revelation of the whole bible in him christ all the full and fulfilling of all the prophecies of the bible is met unconditionally in christ jesus because he was god manifested in the flesh now when we find these things old when we're confronted and come into a meeting and see the power of god moving and doing things and doing supernatural works and sit uh perform and look in the bible and see that it's promised for this hour then when we see those things then we are confronted with the responsibility to either accept it i mean as for ourselves now many people sympathize many people say it's right but that don't that don't make it what that ain't the thing that you're responsible for is i've said what if i was a young man and looking for a wife to be married and you're stood a girl that met every qualification that i thought it took to make a woman why morally she was a queen and lovely and a fine personality a real christian everything that i could think of to make me a good wife no matter how much i say she's perfect she's exactly right she isn't mine until i accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife that's the same thing the message is you might say it's right or this that word say i sympathize with it i believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it and it's got to become a part of you and you're a part of it you've got then it's yours when you marry this certain woman that you have chosen you are you are one man and that's where you are with christ when you see him manifested and made real then you are part of him and he's part of you and together you're part of the message oh how many denominational ships have we got going down to tarshish for the jonahs of these days 900 of them something a ships that takes the easy route don't want to face up to jonah didn't want to face up the thing of going to the gentiles he didn't want to take that cruel message over there within 40 days you'll perish if you don't repent he hated to do that he thought that gentiles was hard to tell what they'll do to me but he had to face up to it he but he took a easy ship and went down the tarshit went down in the hole the ship and went to sleep took the easy route the easy way it's a popular way with the people it's easy to take the way where everybody can patch you on the back and say you're a good fella and this is so and so uncertain in the world look upon you it's easy to go the proper way but when when you have to do something different when you have to stand to your conviction and what you know to be the truth there's where the hard part that's the rub comes right there oh as we've often sang that old song how easy while sailing the sea and it's calm to trust in the strength of jehovah's great arm but oh let the waves begin to blow let the wind blow and whip up the waves then what do you do something like i was told one time the lady said back in the horse and buggy days that said the horse ran away with her going from church said what'd you do said i trusted the lord until the lines broke well that's the time to trust the lord after ever after the lines is broke you're trusting in the lines until they're broke yes and um so we find out that we have many easy ways to go ships going down the tarsher parts easy the unresponsibilities it just flows in you have everything coming everybody's likes you and everybody your nobody disagree with you you disagree with nobody now if that ain't a dishrag that's right yes push over flop over why anybody i don't care who you are and what you're standing for actually decent thinking people think more of you if you'll stand for your conviction of what's right right don't care you take a woman she might be ever not very attractive in whatever she is but you let that woman stand for principles of womanhood let her stand like a lady and if a man's got an ounce a man about him he'll take up for absolutely we appreciate something that that somebody's got that they believe that is the truth and will stand for what they think is right how wishy washy that's what too many christians that they are so soft-soaked and everything until they think all they do is join a church go in somewhere put their name on a book or do a little something jump up and down shouter or something like that and call it christianity christianity is a everyday rugged life living for god in this presence world it's a constant burning of the fire and love of god in the heart that sets you apart and puts you out younger with the people and making converts to christ responsibilities but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream go out there and sit down in the river with your boat you get your oars and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just once let loose the oars and watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going when things are floating easy remember you're going towards a a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls it won't be long you'll be going over that falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir but you must accept your responsibility now you believe it and you you think it's the truth and the responsibility that god has given us in this day to bring this message and as i get older and i know my days are sharpening up i feel a responsibility greater than i ever felt press it on we must do it we must get down to it you know everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that jesus christ is coming that he's god and he's coming soon there's not a not a hope left in the world but the coming of the lord amen now if you've got one ounce of spirituality you know where i'm going amen you know when he the point he's making here and i think that this is uh this is in the same line of the services that we've been preaching we've we've we talked about uh in the line of the service's birth pains and this day this scripture is fulfilled then the sermon that brother brandon preached after that was a door in a door and he talked in the door and the door about he stands at the door and knocked and so that we took what was said in that message door and a door and begin to add it to this running from the presence of the lord and you know we look at so many times the presence of the lord we just look at it as being the feeling or an anointing that we come into but we know one thing about that anointing is when you come under that anointing it'll convict you of unbelief it's in the light of god's word that everything comes to your mind of all that you've done and and your weaknesses and your failures and and we're not emphasizing this morning those weaknesses and their failures because we all have them we we all have our list of the things that uh and of the things that we so easily uh fall to but our our our desire today is to come to if i could say this a greater understanding of of of this cry that's in us to overcome and what what that cry is going to lead us to because brother brown is laying this point here and his point is is that jonah was backslid or in other words he was running from the responsibility that was placed for him to do that that's what that's what uh he did the reasons that he did it were explained he was a jew and so he looked at himself well i'm a jew and therefore i can't go to these gentiles and that became his excuse and and that's what we're full of we're full of excuses i can't do it well the prophet of god preached a message called perfect strength in perfect weakness and the point of that message is is you can't come up with excuses that cause you to reshirt from your responsibility and face up amen and that's what that in our lives i think that's what we've come down to is we've come down to the time that we've got to face up to it no matter what it is in your life i'm not going to hunt for things that you have to face up it's the understanding that you've got to come face to face with every issue every decision every responsibility in your life you've got to come down to the time in your life that you stop and you come face to face with it and you look at it for what it really is you look at what you're dealing with you're honest about it your description of it is honest you're not making any excuses this is how i am this is where i'm at this is what i do this is my weakness now i've come face to face with it always uh you know because of my position as being a pastor and people come sit down and and and talk and the minute that they start making excuses and saying why they did this and why they did that and somebody else there's no way to help them [Applause] yeah after talking to you it sounds like i need to be talking to the other person what it's the failure and now remember he didn't just throw this he said jonah is an example of us all right we all do this he said it's in us to do it so now we've got this cry in our hearts to overcome because the holy spirit is calling us he's dealing with us he's hunting us down he's sowing his word uh upon us and him starting to deal with us it it creates the cry in us so we have this cryingness i want to overcome i want to do better i want to overcome this i want to get this out of my life you know there should be a cry in us that i want to do something for god that's right i just don't want to live every day i don't want to have an easy path i want something more in my life i want to be on fire for god it it's a hunger and a thirst in us but you can't jump any of the steps he said at birth he said has a process the birth pains is the process that you've got to go through so there's a process to overcome there's a process to get the victory and that's what the majority that we find and i find i'm preaching this to myself that i find in myself i always create a way around it you water it down you whitewash it those are terms that brother random use that's what they used to do to fences it was like you didn't really paint it exactly you just took kind of a diluted paint and you just kind of put it on there and covered up the little uh the marks and the little prints and stuff so it didn't look as bad you just cover it up now you have to understand we're not talking about my relationship with billy we're not talking about my relationship with any of the other brothers or people we're not talking about relationships we're talking about what's transpiring within ourselves and within our mind so within our very selves the things that we want to overcome the things that we want to make better the things that we all we want out of our life those are the very things that we're running away from those are the very things that we're whitewashing those are the very things we don't deal with but in order to overcome it you've got to come face to face with it you've got to give a true pure analysis of yourself so what is well i'm just weak i've got lust i've got pride i've got envy i've got jealousy i've got hatred [Music] you kind of call it what it is [Applause] you're not hiding anything from him like adam and eve sold fig leagues so they could hide their sin that's why he died did you hear what the prophet of god said in the beginning of this he said he separated the jews for a cause the cause was to give them a law they couldn't live by so everybody could see you can't live by the law takes the blood of the lamb there's only one provided place of worship so you've got to you've got to come you've got to face up you've got to come face to face with it so you've got the holy spirit putting a cry in your heart to overcome and to it so it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it and the first thing you've got to do is he's saying you've got to come face to face with it now the reason jonah was backslid because he was running from his responsibility and we just heard as plain as day there's responsibilities with everything everything has responsibilities everything that you do in your life there are things that you are responsible for there's responsibilities that go along with christianity there are certain things as being a christian you are responsible for but what do we do what did he say we're backslid or we're not where we want to be because we're not facing the responsibilities we've whitewashed them we've we've come up with excuses we've come up with reasons i don't want to offend anybody now i i just went through an experience and i i'm so thankful that i went through that experience i go to my barber shop i started going there and because my good barber friend moved to phoenix and uh he probably watches he watches some of our services and he knows he probably looks at my barber and thinks boy that guy's not doing a very good job that's all right but i'm in the barber shop and they're a pretty old rough bunch of guys you know and and uh so they're all there talking about a lady that came into the shop and and and i don't know the mental condition of the lady you know i i don't know what she was doing but she went in there to testify to him and ask him if they were saved and they were all just mocking her and she went to the next door and they the barber said i went outside and the guy said that crazy lady coming here too yeah and they were all telling how they said well we kicked her out of the store and told her to do this and everything and i sat there and i thought i'll just sit here and all of a sudden something welded me i just looked out there and i said well at least she was telling the truth she told them they're all going to meet jesus someday and he's coming and if they don't get right with him they're going to hell well they threw the lady out of the shop but i'll guarantee there was one person in there that wanted to tangle with me and i said at least she's telling you the truth man i thought the clippers went off in that place it got it got so quiet you never looked so fast that people want to change the subject i'm you know i didn't get up and leave i didn't keep going i said she may not have been right in the house she said said it but what she said is true and i'll believe it but i i i in my heart it it wasn't a moment of of like glory and revelation it all of a sudden it came onto me like a ton of bricks i'm responsible for this i have a responsibility that goes along with what that i'm claiming and i thought well why can't i've got this great call to overcome i've got this great desire to grow higher and to get victories and to have power and to have all these things but power without character is satanic and real character is based on a person that lives up and takes responsibility for their actions takes responsibility of their calling takes responsibility of the job that they're due and they're willing to stand up there and be responsible for their testimonies and and i feel that that there all these things these shortcomings in our life you can't overcome them until you face up to them if you've got to look at the real reality that you're in religions of covering that's right we take grace and we cover up our shortcomings we take calvary and we cover up our shortcomings we used all these excuses we shrink from the responsibility we we we push them into corners and that's what brother branham was preaching in door to a door he says he stands at the door and knocks and we open the door and we let them in but there's all these other doors there are doors within door the doors within the door we open the door so if i could say this there's responsibilities within christianity it can answer that this cry to overcome is really a cry to responsibility that's what jonah was running from he was running from his responsibility to bring the message that god had given him to bring the responsibility of it and that you know i just thought even in my own life i need to sit down and just ask myself what are my responsibilities what are the things i'm supposed to be doing what are the things that that god is expecting me to do and and and and i'm not going to go through a list of responsibilities because it's those i'm not trying to pin it down to specifics i want you to understand in my heart i want to understand a part of us going forward as a church apart for us going forward as an individual apart for us to overcome and climb that rung into the next ladder is we've got to understand we've got to find and be responsible for the things that are that come with what we are as long as we're lucy goosey and are taking the easy stream and shirking our responsibilities we'll never see that supernatural come to pass in our desire because it doesn't have any place to rest that faith has got to have something that's built on something solid so it's just that we've got to meet the responsibilities of what you uh what you're called to be what are what's the responsibilities of the bride of christ i'm called to be the bride i'm called to be a an ambassador what's the um what's the what's the duties and the responsibilities of an ambassador we send an ambassador to a certain country what's what's his responsibilities what's that ambassador's responsibilities to sit in a nice house to go have tea no he's there to represent the business interest he's there to tell the government we have a company that supplies that we have businesses we have investors that would like to invest make an investment deal there's all these things responsibilities that go with the position we've taken a position haven't we we've taken the position of i'm elected we've taken the position i'm called out we've taken the position of i i i'm the bride of christ well he said any marriage it's got responsibility you've got responsibilities to wipe the fingerprints off the wall when somebody does something in this message it's our responsibility to wipe those fingerprints off of it love hides a multitude of sin there's all kinds of responsibilities that go with our testimony and we're not going to go forward that's right until we come face to face with it we're not going to go forward individually until we come face to face with the situations and the complexity of our lives and we come face to face and say i've come face to face with this that i can overcome this this is what i need to overcome and it becomes a simplicity of it you've got to face the responsibility of what you've been called to do but if if you just thought you're going to join this thing and there's no responsibility i'm not responsibility of the local body fine he who says he's not a part of the body is not a part of the body that's right you want to say i'm just going to go my own way i'm going to believe my own thing i'm going to do my own thing because there was one other guy in the bible i knew was like that right it was a guy called cain i'm not my brother's keeper i've got no responsibility it doesn't it doesn't come with it the only turf i'm responsible is for my turf welcome you know there's a cry don't you see in our hearts all of us are crying to overcome we want to do better we want to have victory we want to put lust behind us we want to put worry behind us we want to put things behind us we want to put the dread of the future behind us all these things that we're desiring and we're crying out to overcome the spirit of the lord speaking back to us you want to overcome start taking responsibility don't short your responsibility don't walk away from your responsibility to your family don't walk away from your responsibility to your neighbor don't walk away from responsibility don't shirk the responsibility face up to it because it's in the facing up to it that you can deal with it how many times have you heard people say the first step to getting rid of the problem is to admit that you have one you know and and what is our definition of a sanity to keep doing the same thing over and over again thinking you're going to come up with a different result you keep shirking responsibility you could you don't come face to face with the problems you see what he said you just let it flow down the river you take the easy way you step around it you don't you you don't come and meet it face to face you don't deal with it whether it's a complex whether it's a bad feeling you see we've got we as human beings we just blow it off we blow this off we blow that off and pretty soon we got a great big pile of things that we've blowed off and guess what they do they find you i tried to go make something right with the brother i don't know if i i did the right thing i prayed and prayed and i came up with all kinds of plans but how i was gonna make it right and how i was gonna fix it and this thing bothered me for years i'm not talking one year two year i'm talking years and i i come to find out one day that this thing is still in my life and it's something i got to make right now the brother he didn't even probably even know it was bothering me but what i found out is i couldn't put it away and no matter how far down the road i went this bag was still in my trunk and every time i'd open my trunk there it is there it is and finally said one day why don't you just make this right well i don't want to face up to the fact that what i did was wrong now i thought it was good what i did sure i thought i did a great thing but i didn't have permission i ventured without authority but it stuck with me you know ten years later i finally say you know something i need to make this right so i had a plan how i was going to make it right but the plan didn't include confession it just included penance i'll just give a gift i'll make it right no confession no admitting fault no admitting i was wrong i didn't want to face it because it embarrassed me it embarrassed me supposedly being the preacher and me supposedly doing this and that it embarrassed me but finally i sat down i wrote a letter i said i was wrong i shouldn't have done it this is the way it is and i made it right i thought how many other things that i failed to face up to and then a prophet of god said that's the way we are but we're not going to overcome the way to overcome is to face up jonah didn't want to face it noah he had to face the fact that he was preaching an unscientific message in a scientific age that's what he had to come he had to come to reality with that's what he had to to face up he had to face the fact he had to come down and take a look at it face to face can you put up a paragraph 100 in in a man running from the presence of the lord and uh and you know if we went to paragraph 99 you you can just uh uh you know you can just see here that of what that the prophet of god's laying down so i'll start to read and then he'll find this he said he says he says every man had to face up to that that's got a responsibility before god we just take for instance noah he had noah moses elijah and all the rest of them of every age had to face up to the responsibility and they had to do it but that's the reason they were sent in the hour in paragraph 100 look at noah in his scientific age how he had to face up to a thing that was so unscientific why there wasn't a reason why it couldn't could be unscientific it was unscientific rather they said it's going to rain out of the sky they never had rain drop out of heavens now he had to face up to it god said it was going to rain you do you understand he had to face up to it well we've got to face up to the fact that god sent a messenger it's not popular it's not religious but you you've got to face up to it you've got to face up to the fact that you've been called out to be separate and to be different now you're not like the world you can't keep trying to take this message and fit it into the world you can't you can't say you can't make it be anything other than it is right you've got to face up to the responsibility of your calling and of your segregation from the world and of your being called out you've got to upset the responsibility of the fact that you are different the prophet god said we're not like the rest of the world we're different you have to understand we don't have the same gospel of every age we're not preaching jesus christ of nazareth we're preaching jesus christ of today [Applause] we've got to we've got to accept the responsibility of the capstone the love of god being the shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit what's that mean the responsibility of of taking on people's feelings taking on people's burdens being a part of a body ministering one to another every joint fitted and joined together serving one another we're more responsible to the world than we are to god sometimes we've got to let him in every door every door in our life we've got to open up we've got them and that's our responsibility mikasa sukasa my house is your house yes behold i stand at the door knock if you let me in well there's a responsibility that goes with letting them in that's right confessing he's been there let's just continue reading this hundredth paragraph and this is and we'll close here it says he says now he had to face up god said it was going to reign then faith without works is dead i believe it and don't make no act just like the message if you say i believe it and don't make an act what good does it do noah went to work with this hammer and built an ark to confirm what he was talking about that's what we have to do we have to go to work and prove our faith by our works our works prove our faith i mean you take you know moses he had to he had to face the fact that god called him to go down to the biggest civilization the greatest military might in the world with a stick all's god's asking you to do is go face lady oseah the darkest most corrupt perverted age of time stand right up in the face of it all and say he's the same yesterday today and forever he still heals he still delivers he's still cast out devils i may not be the one to cast out devil's friend i might not have that gift but if you'll come down to church next week we'll have the elders of the church lay hands on you and and again if you believe in your heart and they believe in their heart that thing will leave you you can't do anything if you don't believe in it another look if you're going to have a testimony you take on the responsibility of that you can't have a lukewarm wait and see well let's pray for you and see what god does no you've got to take the responsibility i'm going to pray for you because i believe you're going to get well because god said so i'm willing to take the responsibility of the testimony of laying my hands on you i'm willing to take the testimony and the responsibility that god will stand behind the fact when i said he sent a messenger i can prove it by this word [Applause] but we're not overcoming because the responsibility side of it is what we're shrinking from that's what we kind of do we take the easy way i know the best way not to get into a confrontation is not to say anything i just won't deal with it well how are you going to handle this just walk away it'll go away guess what it don't go away how to trade places brother you ought to come up here and take over the the that's that that's the victory so we're starting to see that these men they had to face things noah had moses had to a face i'm going to go down there with a stick so i'm going to do where are you going moses take over egypt see we hear that story and i thought brother mike's uh exhortation this morning was so perfect we make everything so supernatural and all the bible stories so pontific that that we don't understand that these are real men moses agonized 40 years in the desert until it ate him alive and he said i'm taking the stick and i'm going down there why because there was a cry in his heart to overcome and he overcome when he faced the responsibility that's when he overcame when he went down there and he faced it face to face he got to work after he faced the responsibility he got to work that's what he did he put his wife on the donkey went down there he had to face his failures before he had to fake everything all the mess he made all the times that he testified that that he was number one and he fell flat in his face all this history he had to face it all and he had to deal with his present tense condition and face up to it and get to work you look at jesus jesus could have saved himself he could have taken some other path some other way he done all the good works in all those miracles he could have said well i did all these things isn't that good enough to redeem him he didn't he didn't provide remember a one-man denomination the evidence of a one-man denomination he pews his own sister and out he builds his own plan he's got his own way of going about it he's got his own belief systems he's got all his own little way he catches the spirit but what happens with all those ways they get wiggle tales they get corrupted look at all the times that you haven't faced up to the very thing you're dealing with and come face to face with it and you build some other system that thing's in it plus seven other devils and it's better just to get down to business jesus could have saved himself but then he couldn't have saved us he could have come up with some other way but then we would have never known what we've got standing with us he had to face the responsibility that he was called for this purpose for this cause i have come into the world this is what my responsibility is my responsibility is to take these stripes so they can be healed to take these nails for the chastisement of their sins i've got to go through the death before i can resurrect i've got to face the responsibility before i can resurrect and in closing i will add this you can't overcome just by stopping and quitting you can't noah couldn't have overcome just by saying it's going to rain you can't overcome just by saying i'm not going to do this anymore i'm not going to do it i'm not going to say another bad thing about somebody i am not going to eat mashed potatoes anymore i am not going to do this i am not going to do that you'll never get the victory that way and i know this isn't a great message this morning about the seven horse riders and the seven church ages and and the son of man ministry which i would say those things we know but let us move on to perfection let's really ask ourselves is there a call in me is the holy spirit really put a call is there really a call in me to overcome i really desire to overcome and the spirit comes back and whispers you want to overcome first of all take on the responsibilities that you've been shirking for so long reading your bible praying visiting the fatherless and the widows in their affliction going the extra mile lay for yourselves a pattern of good works sometimes we shrink shirk from the responsibilities of baker seek christianity and we cover it up with the fact that we've got a revelation of a pillar of fire when the man with the message was always doing good for people the lord went about doing good works the scripture says that we are his workmanship in christ jesus foreordained under good works that we should walk in them but you can't you you can't give up the responsibility and substitute it with the works you can't do good to make up for the little black spot in your life or that little evil part of your nature you can't out-good the evil i have a really nice white shirt on and if i sit there and i look down there and there's a little blue pin spot where i stuck my pin in my pocket so what will i do i'll just keep my coat button and then guess what i forget and there it is sure enough it gets exposed what i got to do one day one day i've got to say i've got an ink spot on this shirt i've either got to replace it or i've got to go bleach it out or find a new pocket and have it sewed on but i can't this shirt will never be what it's supposed to be until i deal with that spot and come face to face with it and if we get a life pattern of we just skip this one and skip that one and so we start to look and see how people feel about us you know what how do you feel about yourself yes sir so i want to say this you can't overcome by just quitting or stopping i'm never gonna do this again i'm never gonna do that again that'll never work you've got to replace it with something you've got to replace what you're quitting or what you're doing away with with something else if you've got a real bad problem gossiping you just don't say i'm going to quit gossiping i'm going to quit gossiping and sit around on the couch one you're just dying to say something you ain't overcome you're bearing it all within your spirit there's no freedom you know you're packing it you know you're there it's there maybe you got it not to rear up its ugly head but you haven't done away with it but you've condemned it to the closet you stay in there you don't come out anymore you quit you quit you quit and you know what it's doing it's just waiting for the day that it can open that handle and show up 10 years later yeah it'll show up but you can't you've got to face it and then when you come face to face with it and you realize i've got this problem i'm just using gossip because i know nobody in here has that problem you got to replace it with something you've got to replace it with saying nice things finding good things to say about somebody talking about people what qualities they have you know creating a nice atmosphere if if the scripture says if thou steal steal no more is that the end of that scripture if you stole steal no more quit stealing it's not what it says it says but work with your hands labor that thou mayest give you see look you can't overcome so what i'm saying this morning i hope that i can reach out in my uneducated vocabulary but the spirit is calling us and creating in us a desire to overcome so with this great desire to overcome we need to walk up and say how do i obtain what the holy spirit is calling me to do and the spirit comes back and says take responsibility [Music] and replace those things that you want out of your life with something else in your life even in the carnal diets if you're going to give up something they tell you replace it with this you're going to give up potatoes replace it with broccoli if you're going to give up hamburgers replace it with a fish or whatever this isn't a life of not doing it's a life of doing and the only reason we're backslid in the first place is because we shirk the responsibilities that we've had and we've got a whole life pattern of walking away from things leaving things undone and the spirit of god has called out this people and it's telling us it's time that we get down to business it's time that we re face the responsibilities our testimonies what we've been called to be and what we've been called to do come face to face with our iniquities and start replacing the bad with good and we'll start living and having an overcoming life when you want to be healed all you want to do is replace the sickness with what health you just don't want the sickness to go away you want to be healthy so you want to overcome but you want to you know you got to know what you want to be and you've got to know what you've got to change and you've got to replace what you want to change with what you want to be and you've got to start bringing that into reality works and real living and when we all take that responsibility that we have one to another we will start moving forward like we've never moved forward before and they'll know that you are my disciples by your love one for another god bless you this morning beautiful message i'd running from the presence of the lord is running from your responsibility and good works is taking up your responsibility it all works hand-in-hand god bless you the musicians would come let us stand this morning maybe with our heads bowed or our heart spout before the lord and and you would just take a moment to ask yourself if you've had certain feelings or certain thoughts in your heart and your life certain things in your life that you've left undone and certain maybe even certain failures that you've never really went to the lord with and had a real one-on-one conversation and you realize that the greatest step to fulfill the call in your heart is to come face to face face to face with your own reality face to face with your own weakness just say lord i'm here just the way that i am and lord i i'm going to face this responsibility i'm going to confess it to you and lord if i've been listening to things that's not right i'm going to replace it with your message if i've been saying things that aren't right i'm going to replace it with things that aren't right lord i'm here to deal with myself today i'm here to take a good straight look in the mirror and knowing that your holy spirit has hunted me down that it's your spirit that brought me to this place and i have a promise father that you'll quicken and make alive that overcoming within me lord i believe that you've called me to come face to face with the reality of what i am that that was your spirit lord i know that when i overcome there's going to be something that you're going to give me to take its place and that's what i'm hungering and thirsting for today lord lord i don't want to run no more i don't want to run from your presence i don't want to run from sitting down and coming face to face with you i don't want to run from my weaknesses my shortcomings my sins i'm here to come face to face this morning if you feel that way in your heart this morning you'd like to lift your hands to the lord say lord i want a real personal relationship i'm not talking about believing this message lord i believe it i believe every word i believe you veiled yourself and flesh i believe you opened the seals i believe the church ages i believe in the horse riders i believe in the evidence of the holy ghost i believe in baptism in jesus name i believe all those things lord but in my spirit lord i'm just not what i want to be and that's what i want to come face to face with today lord and i want to tell you lord i want to going to deal with myself i'm going to bring myself into subjection this message is going to be a part of me and i'm going to be a part of it and i'm going to be yours this morning that's your heart desire we just give you the opportunity to look in your own heart and say lord i want to come face to face i don't want a shirt no more father i honestly know by your spirit every hand in this building should be up but lord i ask that this seed that went out this morning will grow into the heart of each person now i might not have the vocabulary or the words to lay it out in an elegant way that the mind could accept it and understand it father i'm not preaching to the mind today trying to speak to the real heart of the real hungry believer or that they can find a path to their victory so they can make it a reality in their life not just a mental but a real working hammer and nail art building and i know father that for your elect that's what they want that's their desire the hope of glory is christ in me father we pray today that it'll be our portion we ask it in your precious and holy name we pray amen amen let's sing this song [Music] is [Music] what do you bless his name oh lord we worship you oh do you do it from your heart [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh face to face [Music] [Applause] [Music] in [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] your name lord and i

i [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Applause] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] i am [Music] [Applause] i will [Music] i bring jackson if we could just come in [Music] you appreciate the message this morning struck me as brother david said he could have set up here and preached on things that maybe we thought were mysteries things that sometimes we put far out there but sometimes when the rubber meets the road and it's those things that hit the heart that mean the most and i can appreciate that brother david let's pray heavenly father lord we come to you this morning lord believing that you spoke to us or believing that you were searching the doors within our hearts lord we know that we've been taught that if we want to expose the devil or we must confess it lord we know it within ourselves we know that you know it but when we confess it lord it gives him no ground that he can operate on lord i ask that you would search the hearts this morning lord if there's things in our life that we need to make right lord may we not be embarrassed may we not worry about what someone else would think lord but it's only going to draw this body closer to one another lord and closer to you lord we know it's a sacrifice sometimes we know that there's things that can be contentious there's things that we don't want to speak of and we want to skirt the issue lord we ask that as a body and we're trying to come up higher lord even as brother david just said there's there's a cry to overcome lord may you just go and walk the pews and let your holy spirit but we heard that it hunts out the people this morning and it hunts us out lord for the things that we need to make right or deal with our hearts or meet us in that secret place or do we know that you can find and search us and or we can come out and do the things that we know that are right or this is a church that's on fire it's a church that wants to come higher lord we're asking that you would deal with each individual lord may they play their part we commit all things into your hands lord we love you we ask these things in jesus name amen amen amen don't forget about the meeting in the back god bless you are dismissed after amen oh to jesus i surrendered [Music] [Music] oh answering [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] surrender all [Music] oh i surrendered [Applause] [Music] is take me jesus [Music] my blessed savior to
