each individual person that's made an effort to be here Lord we want you to be lifted up in our lives and we want your power to overcome the challenges of every and every each and every one of our

around and welcome someone this morning as you invite our pastor this morning amen God bless you this morning you may be seated it's uh certainly wonderful to be in the house of the Lord this morning and and to uh come together and uh fellowship and it's probably never that you have a dedication that you don't go back in your mind to when the Great temple was dedicated and when the ark was traveling from tent to tent in place to place and David put it on his heart to build a building and U but he was a a a man of war and so God promised that he would have his son build it and in the building of that Temple it was very unique because they had a pattern to build it after they had a blueprint that was given uh to them to build but when they looked around their country and they looked around at uh uh the the the area that they were at there in Jerusalem where they were going to build this Great temple they found out that all the products and all the things necessary to build that Temple they didn't have and they had to go outside of their land to find the trees and the stones and the and and the uh skins and everything that they needed they had to go out and look for them and they came from many different places in many different lands there were many different products and many different uh items that came and I thought that reminds me so much of the temple that God's Building now we come from the East and West we come from the lands ofar we come from different countries and different languages we come from different skin colors different skin tones we have some with hair some with no hair and and he's reached out and he's taken all the parts from everything that he had that he might build a a temple and no part in that Temple could work without the part next to it no part stood alone uh by itself it became a part of the whole and the glory was shared from the hidden nail to to the ark that sat in the place that was prepared for it every item every portion of it added and gave to the glory of it and if you removed any part of it you would remove that portion of glory and then the glory of the whole wouldn't be there it would still be beautiful it would still be glorious but it wouldn't be as glorious if it had that peace added to it and you're the pieces that God has chose to build the ark that God is building in this day and my prayer is that each of you this morning would come to the realization of your importance to the body and that God is placed with within you something that all of us need and no we don't have any big guys or little you and it took all of you to make this meeting we thank all of our deacons that have labored our trustee board all of you that gave and gave gifts to the church and out out of your want and need you still gave offerings that we might have a place to come out of the rain and lift our hands and Worship the Lord it it takes uh a lot of work you know I I I thank all the people that put the lunch on for you and and you know they cleaned up and mopped the floors and swept and set up tables and all those things but you share in that Glory you share in that labor when you turn your heart to the Lord and you worship him and it becomes all of us together and we've all been called by a special voice we heard a scream we heard a cry and something in US was stirred and we knew that this was the voice of God this is a fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 we saw that there was a calling out and a sweeping and a separation and a building of a temple and the building of a a body and it was calling from every land every country every church every denomination every idea and forming an invisible Union between our Heavenly bridegroom and our Earthly bride this morning before we start our service I would like to play for you 15 minutes of our messenger speaking about what a dedication really is and where the dedication takes place if I was still in the Catholic church this morning I would be dressed in some sort of gown and I would have some incense and some water and I'd be walking around throwing the water on the walls and waving the incense as we dedicated the brick and mortar but that's not what we're dedicating this morning I want as we listen to our messenger speak to us and it's our messenger it's your message it was God's voice to you and it's the you that takes the voice to heart and then makes the US so I'd like to play this and this is if I could say that I if I missed anybody and thanking you all I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for being here and for blessing us with your pray prayers and with your presence it's my desire to go forward in a greater will and heart and mind to serve him more than I've ever served him before amen and musicians as we play this just remain comfortable so we're going to start if you some people I know have devices nowadays that they can read along but we're going to start in paragraph 74 of the message that brother brandham preached called dedication I would encourage each of you especially our members of our local assembly here our portion of the body that you go back and and listen to this and find your part but as we play this it's just 15 minutes long just listen listen as he unfolds to us really what needs to be dedicated in order to have a dedication so with always it's with great humility and appreciation that I play for you this morning The Voice of God to this generation you may remain seated as we listen to this portion of the tape and after this Burns within your heart we'll Worship the Lord in song and in word and in Thanksgiving God bless you our messenger William Brandon that is the real church not a Marty and brick and stone and so forth which is perishable but the real church is built upon the revelation of the word and will of God Amen and they've been placed in the body since the Ephesian Church age all the way to the lady OA now but what in the day that when Solomon had completed the temple and the Chief Cornerstone as soon as the builders accepted the rejected amen then the building started going up may I say this with all reverence and with all respects to every man in every church and every man's idea when our Builders today except the rejected and instead of push him off and call him a bunch of Holy Rollers the odd ones that's making confession that much sooner the building will be completed amen but did you notice after the building was completed it was still an empty building amen that was nothing in it but Furniture so Solomon had done all he could do now the great day of dedication come when they were going to dedicate this building for worshippers to worship something now without Something There To Worship the building would have been in vain amen but the building was now ready for dedication and when of the Levites and the priests with thousands of trumpets blasting the sky with lamb after lamb dying for sacrifice for sin and the Levites positionally tuck their place went into the corner and got their poles run them through the rings on the ark where the tables of stone was on the inside two t tables of stone same Stone amen these two are one thank you Lord same Commandments same Covenant when these two tables of stone with the cherabin in their wings pitched across one to another when these Levites only that consecrated group could bear the ark amen no man could touch it outside of them if he did he died and they took these poles KN that they were consecrated to the service for this particular thing and they run the poles to the Rings as been instructed Moses had been by God to build the construction of the Ark and they picked it up from its tents they started marching glory and the trumpet sounding the poies playing the going up from the dead animals that was being sacrificed before Jehovah down through the building of dedication they came thank you Lord till they brought it to its resting place or it fit down into the sockets of the great huge place that have been set part and when it fit down and finally come to its resting place the ark the Bible said that the Lord a des sented down upon the place till it fill the entire Temple amen the pillar of fire came in there with such great glory of God tell the ministers could not Minister anymore because of the glory of God that's when it found its final resting place the shakina of Glory that followed those capping Stone not the corner the capping Stone yes Lord the main thing all other Stones was of not effect until then but this mainstone came in The Headstone and took its place positioning for its resting place for that generation amen the glory of God fill the place where they were sitting and there was shakina Glory upon the whole building and the glory was so great till the priests couldn't even ministers because of the glory now we read now and take from the dedication of the temple let us go now to acts the 7th chapter again and the 44th verse and we start in quotation Stevens in his notable sermon as he preached he said Solomon built him a temple because it was promised through David that he would God promised David that he'd build the temple and God in a type which was to be taken away by an antiy just like the sacrifice of the Lambs at the dedication was a type of the real lamb coming for sacrifice all the natural type and the spiritual and we find out that when this taken place Stevens is speaking of it he said our fathers found a favor before God and Solomon built him a temple but how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples neighbor with hands as a prophet said Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol and where is the house that you can build me Heaven's my Throne Earth is my foot stool and how could you build me a house amen dwell in then how beautiful Hebrews 10:5 but a body has th prepared me amen showing that God was going to dwell in a body prepared me oh and when this body had been made a sacrifice the correct lamb had been sacrificed there was coming forth then God came to his own body which was his bride and there had been 120 temples that God had created was ready for dedication that I got all their unbelief beat out of them and they gathered in the upper room and waited for 10 days for dedicational service then when completely surrendered God came down again in the Shina glory and build out a house where they were setting what did God do like the ark dropping into its proper sockets for the message of that day God Dro back into his proper Channel not into a denomination or into a building made with hands but into the heart of man he dropped in his face for the last day which said the prophet Joel it shall come to pass in the last days I'll pour out my shakina upon All Flesh amen your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young man shall dream dreams the old man shall see Visions God came to his resting place where he finds rest not in a building but in the heart of his people amen he finds rest what a shame what a disgrace what a dispos that nimrod's manmade achievement was brought to then yes when Nimrod tried to build a a building or an organization that would reach up to the heavens God upset it amen it became a shame instead of helping man he confused the language of man the one couldn't speak to another it broke up Brotherhood amen but when God came to his own Temple the church the the people when he came to them he filled it the temples that were dedicated just like he did at Solomon's Temple he filled it not with Creeds not with denominations but with himself he filled the temple praise the Lord amen with his shakina glory so did he do on the day of Pentecost he filled them 120 temples that was up there with his with the Holy Ghost itself the shakina of Glory broke through upon him and then what Nimrod failed to do build a temple where every man spoke contrary to what he could understand God came down and with one Galilean language made everything understand what he was saying there's God to his Temple God to his dedicated Temple not to a man-made achievement not to what man done but what God did himself oh it's silly to the people they don't get it they were born not to get it so they won't get it the Bible says so all right God always fills his Temple at the day of dedication he fills his Temple he fills it with his the same thing today God will fill every Temple that will thoroughly dedicate itself to him amen any persons that will the temple is not this little building here the temple is not the one in Salt Lake City the temple is not the one in Rome amen the temple is you you are the temple the god wants to dwell in and express himself through it that all nations might know him you are living images of God that God wants to work through praise the Lord and any time that any man or any woman will forget all the falsehood that they've heard in the world and come back to the line of the scripture amen and will keep in line just like Solomon did to what Moses did Moses did the what God did God always respected it and if we'll come back to the original dedication and will'll open our hearts and empty ourselves God in dedication as we give it to him will fill our temple with his shakana glory praise the Lord then the Living God will be moving in a Living Church among a living people and will spread forth his glory amen then to together someday one being this way and one this way and one one part of the country she'll come together to make the bride we'll be caught up in the air to meet him amen now this lovely church this building that the people with their tokens of their livelihood with their love for Christ the worshippers has dedicating today this place of worship that people could could come and worship now my sincere prayer is that every worship will worshipper will dedicate his own Temple to Worship in the temple that's being dedicated for worship amen praise the Lord that's the real dedication so as our time is gone but God has no time let us remember how late is it I'm looking at old people it may be later than you think I'm looking at young people young girls look these little kids was found cut up the other day I'm little girls ravished how many of them die every year thousands of heart attacks cancer polio anything that can kill them accidents on the road we don't know how young or how old when is a Time to come when your card will be called from the rack no one knows that but God that's right so while you are here today in the dedication of this material here that worshippers are coming to worship the Living God why not dedicate ourselves to the worship of the Living God and let him fill us with himself and then we shall see the shakana glory return again Lord to the house of the Living God which is the human body the Church of the Living God together and a great Revival that would sweep through this country around these towns and all out through here there would be such a noise why they they couldn't stop it there's no way of doing it you think you could stop Stevens while he was like a a house on fire and a high wind well you couldn't stop him even the sanin couldn't stop him and you know even death itself didn't stop him he lived on and he lives today and he always will live because he had eternal life and a house dedicated to the service of God I think the thing for this church to do this morning in respect of all that's been done as we offer God the building for service let's offer ourselves also let us stand just a minute Hallelujah [Applause] it's pretty clear what our part is empty ourselves out dedicate ourselves you are the Temple of the Living God God bless you this morning let's stand as we start our service and in a word of prayer and we'll sing and we'll worship and we'll praise God and we'll dedicate ourselves you know we always say even so come quickly Lord Jesus and we we look like that's a far off event but he said even so come this morning and fill me with your shakina Glory Hallelujah is that your heart's desire well let me tell you something it's God's heart's desire to give it to you more than you can even imagine he wants you well he wants you blessed he wants you happy and he wants a place to rest and you're his resting place let us enter in to his rest

have this too I'm trying to I I'm trying to go here but I'm still here I'm halfway there am so we'll get there and I do have paper so we we uh stuck in a you know I I'm from British Columbia right Canada we do the metric system everybody here know what a metric is a centimeter huh I yeah you have inch half inch foot yard we have centimet millimeters and whatever meters okay well I was the class that got changed so my brain works in two ways when you say inch I have to get to centimeter meter if you say centimeter meter I go to inch so I'll go from paper to pad I'm just warning you we're here for a long time that's what I got told so you know if you got any complaints about the time limit talk to the pastor I've enjoyed we had a wonderful time last night wonderful time in the word um as Michael was doing up my buttons today trying to put this microphone on I said do I have any more buttons left I am so thrilled in the word and I'm so thrilled to have Michael and Abigail my wife the mother my children Sam my eldest his wife Rebecca Ken and Linda Marilyn and David have come to be with us it means so much thank you thank you all for for attending to make these meetings so special I'm overwhelmed as I said on Friday night overwhelmed by the love in your hearts and what you've done to make these meetings possible in this building complete and as brother Bram said so often it's not the building that we're enamored by we're enamored by the people that are in the building and I am a I'm enamored I am I'm enamored when I saw those sisters inside there and given what they were and sister Grace comes some came by my the hallway as I was reading my Bible last night after the service and still had her cleaning gloves on and that impresses me amen that really impresses me so I I thank God for each and every one of you for Brother David that has been a dear friend of mine and as I said the other night you'll never know you'll never know what he's done for us there's this special lady in this room of course my darling wife is here and but Mary when you were here you came at a tough time there was a man of God that reached out I'll never forget that David never and now Marilyn a part of VI's here your murals on the wall how special is that to have David with you it's so special God bless you God bless you well one of those people you know me I just uh I love the Lord a lot and I love this message with all my heart so I'd like to continue with a little bit of a thought change it up a little bit from Friday night a very present God that's amongst us tonight today and I have we have to uh change our mindset a little bit because we always think oh looking for a future or we're looking for the past and we think God's going to do such great things and he's had done great things but I want to say to you T today he is doing great things not he will do or has done he is doing and when we say I'm looking for a Rapture you might as well turn around and look at one another and say I am the part of that rapture people are looking for something the Plaines to fall out of the sky and cars to crash that's nonsense and crazy our God is a God that just can take us in a moment in the twinkling of an eye he'll come as a thief in the night we are in the Dark Hour we're living in right now and he's catching us away there will be a final complete moment when it all takes place but we're living in it right now and we're looking for his his glory is catching away the power of God has returned back back into the Bride of Jesus Christ we sing and I know you sing it I maybe you don't maybe I need to teach you and then that would be a disaster we have the power of God not you know I know I know we get it we get excited because somebody says it in the Pulpit or you know somebody jumps up say we got the power of God you walk out these doors and you can barely you know get to the car without even admitting you know we've got another thing to do today where's your power gone where's your confession it has to be a living life if it doesn't get down to that it's worthless you know people have rise up and thought they were somebody they're nothing you know how important you are brother Braham said you just put your finger in a little bucket of water pull it out and see how important you are we're nobody's outside of Christ Jesus himself who has called us his elected lady which makes us now somebody but as a pastor said already today there's no big eyes and there's no little use we're just one body we're one body and we need one another amen amen and I believe that the bride is coming to a position where she knows exactly brother brm said who she is and who she is called for and he said when that takes place the Rapture happens so I believe I'm living in that time in manifestation I am not looking for a super Church somebody scream I'm the super church hallu say what what are you looking for down the road brother Ram said there will be a a virtuous spotless sinless bride of Jesus Christ amen who is she come on I'm one of them one of them you know and and people get it all theological and they want to break it all down and then show them there's somebody you're nobody he made us somebody and I happen to be one of them amen amen the power of God's return turned back into the church it always has been in the church but now in this last days the full unveiling has now been revealed to a people and I I I'm going to preach a little subject on the Deep calls to the deep and you could not have been born in any other hour but this [Music] hour I I want you to really get that your deep that God put in you could not have lived in Pentecost could not have lived at Luther's age because that deep would have exploded as brother Michael was talking about the temple and going into the shikina glory we couldn't have been birthed then because only one could go in once a year I would have to jump on his shoulders because I've been born to dwell in the shakina glory of almighty God I'm not looking saints of God for your amens and Hallelujah I'm in the amen and I've got the Hallelujah you know if you get quiet on me I'll get louder I get louder you might get louder I don't know what but it's not how loud that's right it's how you live and if this word isn't alive to you just pack up your bags go is that okay i' said at home I've got witnesses and don't let the door hit you on your way out but if we have been called to this Hallelujah this should be the greatest time and moment of your life right now my goodness we're the bride we're the elect we're the chosen I could be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye right now who's coming with me who's coming that's something we're shouting about you know I shout when that you know the fast music goes yeah glory to God when it's real soft where's the glory that changed Rock of Ages where's it Hallelujah no no no no see you weren't quiet you were quiet already Hallelujah so you're dictated by how how fast the beat is I'm not looking at anybody I don't hardly know any all of you but I know one thing Saints nothing as we said the other night nothing not tribulation nothing will separate us from the love of God all right deep oh you say brother Tom I've heard that deep calling to the deep is deeper than you think deep calling to the deep is not lucky the pastor took my watch and now we're in trouble he's even got me bound up and I haven't even started deep calling to the Deep let's turn to Psalms 42 please S I did all that to get as I said the other night to get my butterflies all flying in order one of the most incredible incredible scripture in Bible you know brother Bron Easter seal true Easter seal he says you couldn't even put that desire there you couldn't even have it unless God put that desire in you for him praise the Lord put a desire to seek out the king of kings and Lord Supreme that is a great great deep Psalms 42 verse 1 I'm sorry as the heart panteth after the water Brooks so panth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirst for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears I've been my meat day and night while they continually saying to me where is thy God verse seven deep calling unto the Deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy ways and all thy bills are gone over me let's pray father maybe a little message this morning morning make it a realization to the hearts from the youngest to the oldest that this great deep was given by almighty God by the predestinated plan of your grace so this morning we have been assembled by the forn knowledge of God knowing where each one would be sitting what every heart is thinking and so father I'm praying now collectively Lord as they were in the upper room when the Holy Ghost did fall on those temples they were in one mind one heart and one Accord so would we be in that place this morning Lord maybe for just a little while as we Fellowship around your glorious word we ask in Jesus name amen amen you may have your seats you know life is a is a paradox here I am crying but those aren't tears of hurt or pain they're actually tears of joy but I'm going to read a quote where brother Bram said in why Christ speak why cry to me that cry was not the Cry of joy that was a different type of cry they were perplexed and they were pondering and they were wondering how can they get out of this situation God told them to go to a mountain and that mountain would be a token to them but there was obstacles in the way but those that are the seed of God have now looked back and seen the shadow type and we know the end of the story the Red Sea didn't stop them they still got to the mountain stay with me doesn't matter what you're going through nothing's going to stop you from obtaining what God promised you and he's promised you a Rapture change and there's no devil no Spirit no nothing is going to stop you from attaining what God's promised you this morning if you have to wash your face and stay awake don't do it I'll give you five minutes if you're tired wake up this is something that's better Pastor said better than a hockey game it's better than a Texas baseball game Dallas Stars hockey game don't get don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about uhhuh and I don't even know what your basketball somebody here know oh gotcha it's the Mavericks my goodness it's better than that you heard it already everything said songs were sung I just go the song sung the message was in dedication was done Pastor speaks why don't we just sing amen and go home it's all done but we find out saints of God that what the Lord has given us so surpasses your brand new Cadillac and a smelling leather car don't you just love that smell oh you know you love the smell of new leather do you know they sell more products by smell by the senses they did a study one time and they thought you know this card dealership needed to sell more cars so they put an ad in there where you scratched and it scratched and it smelled of new leather do you know they sold out all their cars because the sense of smell LED them to their C well I got a higher sense called six sense and it should raise us up a little bit higher and we should P be pulling a Little Bit Stronger and we're looking for a Rapture and it might be this message that you're going to hear this morning and we're going to be translated deep calling for the Deep brother Bram said what why you cry to me why cry speak don't cry speak quit whining okay here here's here's my church here huh I won't look at anybody here's your Prophet why could I speak quit your whining and your whimpering now oh brother Tom I just I just can't get it what are you talking about we are the mature bride we have moved now to that the time where the young girl started out at Pentecost she grew to a teenager and now moved into the time of the revealing of the son of man she's now mature not another age not an eighth age a bride time in this last age and she's mature and she knows the word and she's drawn to him which is the word why cry says why are you whimpering oughtn't we be old enough to start speaking Yeah now they're all looking at the quote here look here I'm quoting the quote are you checking me out the kids at school at our little little school at church what do they call that Mike when they check your out fact checking I'll say something like you know you know there's more s there's more stars in the sky than every bit of sand on the face of the Earth and they fact check me and guess what I'm right hey what were we supposed to lie to you so now we have a prophet that's come the word is now open and now we can look back what the prophet did and we look back to what the prophet done and he was looking for what God was doing and telling and prophesy sing of you that's right so that she under her messenger come on I'm bringing you up now we're talking about her present God she under her messenger is the final voice to the final age that's where we're at if you're looking for the future something's wrong just say Lord Make It Real to me now I don't want to look to tomorrow I want God in my life now I want the reality of the scripture now my deepest calling for it now oh but I know everything I've been in the message 50 years so what you got a stripe do you hand no Stripes here straight 1 2 3 4 5 I mean 50 years you know I've been around the message I even know everybody in the message that means zero I know him and to know him is life eternal I've had a lot of friends come and a lot of friends go but Jesus will never forsake you amen I believe that with all my heart am so under her messenger you might as well say I am I am didn't we preach on the I am I am that I am I am the bread that came down from heaven I am that water that was in The Rock when you seen me you've seen the father and before Abraham was am come on I am so now if we've come from the I am who are we who are we am we're a part of the I am and so as he spoke the word now there was a maturing of the word comes but we like our hey Lonnie Lonnie Michael Ro about aore lot of you people don't even know that do they H Hallelujah Noah built an arch Archy you guys I know they know these songs we are so past that that was Kindergarten now we're in the maturity we're at Harvest Time where the seed that went into the ground is now being manifested come on and all the green has been baked out of you and we're living in a golden age hallelujah praise the Lord so mothers let me give you courage stand up and say I claim my lost children hallu you say well brother Tom that's a very bold statement to make well we have Believers here from our church and I said on Mother's Day why don't you claim your children and stand to your feet and one sister stood to her feet who had no children had no children for years I think it's 16 years but she says I'm standing for my child and God gave her her [Applause] child says this is what we believe you say I got a Lost Child believe for your child your son believe for your son your wife your husband believe for them yes say well last night I heard if I don't have the Holy Ghost just ask for the Holy Ghost go home and pray for the Holy Ghost why not receive it right now receive ye the Holy Ghost we get mental thoughts and this is what's going to happen I you know we almost get Catholic in our thinking that's right I got to kneel to there and I got to go here you know there's been many miraculous people in our church that were saved not at church bedrooms at work behind the steering wheel of their car and a a lot at church it just doesn't matter if you're his you're going to get saved but the problem of it is we get an idea of what that is that's right because brother Ram said you're always worth saved that's right the only reason you gave your heart to the Lord was to prove that you always saved you were saved before the foundation of the world you never were lost well let's put it this way yeah I guess you were but you actually awoken come on you awoke to the realization that you were lost and you needed Jesus Christ and look what it's done for you look what it's done to you and look how much more it's going to do for you look how much more it's going to all of a sudden I'm blond and you say well that that's a cute little analogy no it's fact half of us are going to lose half our weight man I thought I'd get a little bit more than that a little and it'll take a revelation to know who I am as it will for me to know you and God will give us that Revelation but there's a deep calling to the Deep one thing about a deep the Deep never stops because once you get to where your deep is you want more of the deep brother Mike is that you back there with that all that white and gray hair man shocked me the other night I wonder who that old fellow was back there I knew him before he was married my goodness and here we are going on in time breaking into eternity living and loving this word and wanting more why are you still here I'm a prisoner I can't go people say I'm throwing the tow I said go ahead throw it in if you can you weren't his if you can walk away from this you never were Gods you can't walk away from this I'm a prisoner to Christ my Deep's been calling to the Deep for a long time and all I want is more you sing that little chorus all it was one of my favorite ones 50 years ago I want more of Jesus more and more and more I I want more of Jesus than I ever had before I want more of his great love so rich so full and free I want more of Jesus so I'll give him of who me I I don't know why I sing like that but there's a Time saints of God we come to maturity and we see our children we never thought that our children would get to school and now they go to high school and they're graduated now they're married and have children and now their children having children it does not stop the deep it has never stopped the Deep you say well that's not deep well for me it's pretty special it's pretty special money doesn't do mean nothing to me I'll tell you what it means everything to me my family my walk with Christ that means everything to me as I said to my church I've said to around the world if I don't have my children what would Heaven be like if I don't have my children deep calling to the Deep God give us our [Music] children Satan on Pharaoh let my people go who said that Moses or God come on who said it Moses or God who said I give you your children William brandom or God I say God gave us our children so we fight for our children we pray for our children we realize by the word that has been unveiled to us you have power to bind and power to loose that has to become such a re a revelation or reality let's put it that way it's both you've been given the power to bind and the power to loose well you say no brother brandham was given that power well then you haven't read the church age book in the church age book he said under their messenger they get the same Privileges and benefits it's very important to stay in the word very important important God gave us a message to put us in our place in the body my thumb is not worried about my little toe but it's a complete body as I've said before did you wake up this morning and say praise the Lord for your spleen come on without your spleen what's going to happen Lord I Thank you for my brain this morning it's a part of the body it's functioning but when something gets hurt you know it's hurt and so that's why he's given us promises I'm the Lord God that Health all thy diseases cuz you're deep was going to call for a healing so then saints of God really if the word of God says it why would we cry why don't we just speak it and say Satan you can't have my body really do I is it is it the pitch or the deciple is it because I go Satan or devil Satan it's your faith in what you're saying and you watch Satan flee I've got a wife who ironed shirts said Satan you can't have my third son you can't have him I prayed for him he's a gift of God ironing and by the grace of God God gave us our third son salvation I I don't think she was yelling it I think she was ironing it devil I'm scorching you I think we need to put a little bit of heat on the devil stop letting him push you you push back and say Satan as a matter of fact you're an offense to me get behind me come on that's where we're at not your theology but in reality Satan is under your [Music] feet oh we want the proper preacher now oh you say and it's a dead church or you get the OV excited horns blowing I just want Christ Give Me Jesus he'll do the work we'll get off the first line I have don't watch you know the brother should oh there's a clock is that a clock oh I got to find some way out you need me to get out it's impossible you might as well realize this you could never been born in any other age than this age because your deep would have been greater than any anything that they had back there but in this they God open the word of God to fill you up and fulfill the hunger and deep of your soul he loosed the seals he opened himself up to you to let you know you came out of [Music] him oh God he says in Psalm 631 that's why I life about the scripture because it's personal oh God Thou Art brother David's God who's God who's God God my God Amen oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where there is no water to see what just [Music] church huh that would be ridiculous to have a church where God is not moving and the moving isn't what you think the moving is cuz some people think it's the shout some people think it's the dance some people think it's just the world but the moving of God is his word in his people and you really know when he's moving when the people get transformed by the power of the word amen all of a sudden you're sitting there and go that's right that's me that's not David that's that's me God wrote that in the Bible for me David thirst I thirst has to be a reality but we still want an hierarchy of course God's got in his church Apostles prophets evangelists pastors preachers and teachers but you show me where the Prophet made himself somebody that's right amen show me one place where he said I'm the major prophet you listen to me God's with me if any man could have done it he could have done it raising the dead healing thousands upon hundreds of thousands did he have a stuffed shirt did he you I know I read an article I was doing some research on on South Africa when brother Brandon was was there in so Derman South Africa and they couldn't even get into the city to get to the meeting 20 miles outside of the city it was Chalker blocked the streets were loaded you couldn't ride they said hardly a bicycle because everybody was trying to maneuver and people were getting healed 20 miles away from where the Prophet was so let me ask you something was it the prophet or was it the angel that was with the the prophet I say it was God in the prophet hallu and if we could get the reality and you need a healing when you walk through those doors you can lift up your hand and say praise be to God because God is not a god of yesterday he's a god of the [Music] present he's the god of the present amen thank you Lord oh anybody that wants to fact check you can put this up on the screen so that they can fact check me as I go it's door to the heart 1959 God wants to come in did you get that up there man you have it always up there when I want it it's not up there how does that work there you go God wants to come in and he doesn't want to come in and we can leave that up there a little while huh right I think we can leave that up there a little while let that one really soak in God wants to come into you to control you not come into you that you would control him Lord you do this you you do this you do this I'm commanding you to do this I tell you this who are you Lord would you if it's in your will and mind Lord I want to make myself available as Michael said there's approaches there's approaches you got to approach right all these guys are I think it was Brother David and I were talking I command God who are you how does that happen it impossible but let the god in you control you we just had a brother get saved a brother and a sister I'm what's their name the Rebecca David walner sammon Stephany just saved he's at work he says God tells me to leave work well all all of a sudden half of you already go yeah he's very spiritual God told him to leave work ah but the thing of it is if there's an eternal result it's God he left work and and the Lord told him turn left he turns left turn right turns right he why am I even doing this go to this store he says I was just at that store so he goes to the store he walks in the store and he was hearing this gentleman tell the person at the store his problems and David was saying I've had those same problems those are exactly the same problems high blood pressure this pressure whatever all the problems were and David thought hey I'm just going to wait outside and you know when he comes out I'm going to tell them whatever problems you got you don't have to have them cuz I used to have them Jesus took care of them they came to church he's got no problems that's made up story that's just happened in the last couple of months a wonderful couple baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior because one man was led by the spirit that's right come on it wasn't him controlling God it was God controlling him God let that deep start controlling us God wants to come in to control come in and control you he doesn't want to come in and be controlled by you he wants to come in for his own purpose of controlling you leading you to eternal life something good for you for when you accept Jesus you must say thou art my God Thou Art my God you want God to control you I'll give you a secret just from a prophet Thou Art my God you might as well say it Thou Art my god control me Lord control me thou art my God take me all that I am soul body and spirit I dedicate myself to you no intellectuals of my own at all just leaning on your Everlasting arm does that not sound beautiful listen Homer Shakespeare Mark Twain you know who those people are they're writers they write poetry or books their poetry doesn't even come close to that doesn't come close so if I could have the Liberty here throw away your Mark Twain it's a part of American History really are you American or Christian oh I'm in the South I'm in trouble huh no I'm oh Texas it's the Lone Star I'll tell you that star that's the great Lone Star that's the Lord Jesus Christ himself and as long as I'm in control by him to God be the Glory great things he's doing not has done he's doing he's changing us from scripture to scripture line upon line and precept upon precept here a little there a little David said expectation when the Deep call to the Deep the Deep calls to the Deep In other words there's a desire in there there's something out there that's causing in here before there is a desire in here there has to be something that created that desire we could just stop right now have a prayer meeting Lord thank you for giving me this great desire thank you Lord I could be out at some silly baseball game I could be at some bar I can be out somewhere but I'm in church in fact I am the church we could have been lost anywhere in anything some

mystery God revealed why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal R his hidden secrets to you I'm not looking into a message to get a nice little thought to preach a 15minute message I'm in the message so that that message could become me why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's your father it's my Heavenly Father revealing or trying to reveal is hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting hungering it's God trying to reveal himself to you to see the revelation of this last day so how deep is it very deep he's trying to reveal to you this great revelation of this last day so I got right under there bu land sweet bu land I'm so homesick for a country why why do we have this deep it's not for this it's for that country I feel the pole I hear the call oh my dear Brethren trying to do God a service with his will oh my dear Brethren I have this message this morning there is a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever there they will be glorifying him throughout the ages and all ages and Eternity why do we feel that because there's the Deep calling to the Deep I'd like you to put that one up please why do you feel it amen why would you even want to come to church we have the greatest preachers we could have is it entertainment some of us get excited and exuberant some don't which is fine because you can't measure it by that you can't one minute as I told you before you roar like a lion the next minute You Weep like a a lamb it has nothing to do with anything of that what it really gets down to and I'm sorry for this little broken up messages I know you deserve better but if you're deep would just get a little bit opened up this morning it'll move you into a relationship you've never had [Music] before the excitement can Wayan and go but if your deep starts to open up you will never ever be the same again is David is it all right you want me to quit am I ready this is not preaching this is my heart this is for for a little group of people I need you want to go this way this morning I'm up very early I had a glory to God message it's all glory to God it's all glory to God God called ministers are not to be stuffed with theology but visit that land where they going and bring back the evidences as we heard last night bring back the evidence that you've been there your life matches what see I got The Grapes of Canaan I want to see your life that's right get into the Holy Spirit get into that Heavenly place we get too militant and have been militant over the years which is a shame oh man I was a legalist boy oh 70s was bad you're I'm so happy you hadn't had to live through the 70s but we made it didn't we Ken we did just a few of us few of us made it few of us man check your skirt length when you come through those doors you let me look at some of your men's hair make sure it's short enough I'm spying you out right now Dylan I'm glad you got a haircut there white walls but don't don't don't look at me like I'm weird because I know you guys were preaching that stuff we were all preaching it thank you but you know Saints we had to grow up too we had to get humbled too we had to have a walk with God too and it's changed us I can say the bless of the Holy Spirit has mellowed us and that we could say that we've been to that land this morning and we're able to bring you some grapes hold out the cup of your heart so that I could squeeze some drops of Revelation into your heart to say here some deep here some of God oh but I got to do this you don't have to do nothing you know what you need to do Lord we don't want to be that one oh I'm all righteous I've done this I've done that you done nothing but then one go before the throne of grace and say oh Lord so low Fill Me Lord use me make me more like you Lord see thing the thing of it is David he did something very special this morning he took my watch you know what it's worth huh you know what it's worth I don't even know what it's worth it's an Apple Watch everybody's got an Apple Watch but I had a brother come from India and I my wife had given me a for an anniversary very nice watch and I went moose hunting and when I got this mousse I gutted it out and I it was the most expensive mousse I ever had cuz my watch stayed in the guts if that's too gross for you forgive me that's hunting talk so we car got the carcass back home and I went to my watch is gone so Marilyn had moved to Florida and uh we went to New Orleans for a day and we're going through the old junk stores and I found a watch five bucks I said that's a nice Five Buck watch I love that watch I bought that watch five bucks so I put that watch watch on I'm proud of that little five buck watch and a brother comes from overseas and he he says you preachers here your big cars and fancy houses and Rich watches and things like that and he comes over to me and he grabs my arm he says how much was that worth I said five bucks his service went flat his point was lost but you know what saints of God if he would have asked me for my coat I wouldn't give it to him I thought can I go through that test this a nice suit but I do it but you only ask for my watch but you know what I'm happy about I was willing to do it wasn't begrudging wasn't taking a second thought I just say I I could do that I could do that I want to live in that land ask for your coat give him your cloak more than just scripture it's life it's just life are you looking for a city is your deep looking for a city can you imagine Abraham at 75 set in his lifestyle maybe had a nice house and acreage but a voice spoke said separate yourself Abraham from everything if I brought Abraham up on the platform this morning and I said Abraham was it worth giving everything up I don't believe that there would be a second thought no he said you know at first I thought M okay Lord is that you when you find out that it's him it's easy amen Lord is that you okay but then what did he give him brother Bram said in one place Abraham gave him an acre and God gave him the world so you think you're giving up something you're giving up nothing say I gave up a career you gave up nothing I got I got a I I'm going to a city that's paid with gold transparent gold I'm going to an Eden that is actually right here this church actually is going to be ashes you work so hard but he's giving he'll give you something better because when God takes something he always gives you something better if you get just get that principle if he takes anything he's going to he's he's a debor to no man so if something it seems to be taken he's going to give you something better we've all had things taken from us but then as we look back we say but Lord you gave me this this don't you love him this morning so Abraham seeking a city who Builder and maker was God it's just Abraham I mean brother Abraham says he was just a simple farmer man and he was just had all these 318 trained Shepherds that trained with a hoe but they could fight kingdoms so it's not our fight it's not our battle can you imagine Mike you and me with a sickle fighting all ceder's army they got Spears brass plate swords and you and I got a sickle oh we'd get him would we we'd get him and there'd be a pile of them there and say this is amazing just like Samson that was amazing and how many spirits have you walked over in your 20 30 years you just haven't seen what you've walked over brother Bram said in one place you walk a Victorious son and daughter of God walking down the street he said the dev devils are fainting and Howling but you don't know that but someone went to another land and told us those devils are trembling because you Brother Jay are going to go to work tomorrow deep calling to the Deep how much more is your deep calling for at this dedication service are we willing to really dedicate our lives and say Lord I want more of you I wish I could sing like Michael and then I'd break out in song more of you I get wrong key and everything else that's a Joyful Noise but I hope this is making a little sense to some of you that when you walk through the doors you go home and you open your Bible and you read the message you listen to it that it will become more than just a quote it will become life amen why cry speak speak in your situation speak are deep are I'm I'm going to wind down I don't know what what it is anyway I don't care but our deep has conquered Satan's Eden you say well that's not strong meat it's pretty strong pretty strong because your deep is going to change you yes the deep is going to give you a new body a deep is going to give you a Rapture a deep is going to get you on the throne glory to God for the deep that calls to the Deep our deep has conquered my cell phone that was most of the parents that said that Tick Tock I somebody said it the other day Tick Tock I thought that was like Captain blly or something tick tock Tick Tock but it's tick tock whatever Tick Tock is I don't like I don't I don't like anything that Satan does you know brother BR said about tape recorder that the tape recorder was invented for this message I'll take that technology yeah and now you can use it wrong you can put a lot of wrong things on you can put a a lot of wrong things on your phone you can put a lot wrong things on your iPads and computers but you also can put a lot of good things on so take off the Bad and put on the good let your deep start calling to the Deep because your deep conquers Satan's Eden amen amen it destroys the enemy in your lifeall you say well that's such a that's a pivotal pivotal message and if if if I'm wrong God forgive me and if I'm wrong May the pastor forgive me but God so had it that the only film ever made about William brandham outside of the Full Gospel businessman but I'm talking about a meeting what was the recording deep one message how important what do you think Satan's even trying to do take what your deep throw this at you catch you up hurts pains so that you dwell on it so you're not dwelling on him let's get rid of him and dwell on him yes you right I was expecting something different and so was I but so you weigh in the back I do see you I do see you and you've been very attentive and God bless you but I hope this is real back there say it's here it's not that there's any space or distance with God I like you a Ponder this in the days ahead a very simple phrase deep calls to the deep and that deep will destroy Satan in my life because that deep is God and God is coming and God is dealing and God is Conquering I see a picture here there's a picture on a wall many of you have them in your home but do you know my deep called for Malachi for I'm sorry friends I don't know about you that's right I'm sorry yes but God knew would be born in this generation hallu and God sent me Elijah behold I sent Tom you me my deep needed this message come on you're deep called for Malachi [Applause] 4 but it didn't stop there because on top of him is revelation 101 you're deep called to a greater deep God coming down so that was a picture of Pillar of Fire that's a picture of Revelation 101 so next time you go home and look in that wall you say I've got the whole message there I got Revelation 101 over re over Revelation 10 seven that's right there's the messenger and there's the angel of the Lord the greatest picture Hallelujah ever taken is that picture because you're deep come on your deep what's calling for that deep it's more than a picture way more than a picture God sent Elijah send you Elijah sent you a message because your deep was calling to defeat Satan and Satan's Eden the picture of it hangs over you can look at it George J Lacy head of the FBI in fingerprinting had taken he said that same angel that led the children of Israel come on the god of the present not the god of the past the god that led the children of Israel amen amen the god that knocked Paul off his horse that's right amen is the same God that hung over our Prophet to let you know he's the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever the fight is on oh Christian Soldier didn't he say he was going to send an angel before Moses has he not sent an angel before you he said I'll send an angel before you and keep you in the way you don't have to get get be worried about getting out of the way if you're his child you'll never get out of the way for he is the way the truth and the life and I am actually in him I am in the way Hallelujah but if you'll obey his voice then I will be an enemy hallu to thine enemy think about it how many obey the voice of Malachi 4 how many how many come on come on here I is here I is come on he said if you obey my voice the voice of God in this last day if you obey my voice I will be an enemy to your enemy amen your son might be hooked on drugs I'm sending the angel after him cuz that's an enemy to me I've obeyed his voice and I'm sending the angel after so whatever your situation in need is this morning if you've obeyed the voice of God in this last age then he will be an enemy to your enemy now you can tell Dev hey devil you're in trouble Hall yes sir you're really in big trouble because I'm catching a revelation this morning I've obeyed God's voice my deep called for that voice and because I obeyed that voice my God is going to be an enemy to you I want to get to a certain point so that we could close when all Heaven opens up all hell opens up or can I say when all hell opens up all Heaven has come down notice again not only that when all hell turns loose all hell turns loose also that's a quotable quote Satan's Army brings diseases Hallelujah I want your deep to start responding Satan's Army brings diseases but God's Army's commission to cast them [Music] [Applause] out deep calling to the Deep we are not a defeated people we are a Victorious people because God is living in us and that is the Deep for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are SA saved it's the power of God does everybody hear that did you hear that wait in the corner way in the back just wave your hand you heard that right okay scripture say First Corinthians 1:18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God glory if you can't get excited over that I don't know what you're going to do to the world it's crazy you're having a great time at church but to us it's glorious that's why he writes in Philippians 4 and6 be careful I'm popping be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known of God okay you want another interpretation of that don't be anxious or worried on anything yes sir anybody worried here this morning no sir oh yeah yeah yeah no sir yeah yeah I got that oh not me no um you've got more payment coming up is there enough money at the end of the month Paul's writing to us don't be anxious over anything my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills and if my deep is calling for a need there is one that can supply that Deep's need the problem with us we limit God by our gray matter true and our feelings how am I feeling today how are you feeling dear maybe you should change that how's your faith dear pretty good listen to a message prayed I'm ready to fight the devil oh man oh man when's the last time you actually prayed when's the last time you actually read your Bible when's the last time you actually listened to a full message and the meter goes way down it should be it should be bearing itself as I've said at home I said said the other night you can't survive on Wednesday night Sunday morning and Sunday night people do that and you'll find out that their tree gets dry brittle lay in the presence of the Lord am and let the do of Heaven do its Eternal work for you brother brah said in waters of Separation I used to often times wonder what's the matter with the Christian Church they're so scared of things he says why you got nothing to be scared about the first word nearly Jesus said after the resurrection fear not don't fear don't get scared there's nothing going to happen to you [Music] hallelu okay quotable quote just Mark that down and pass it out on Wednesday or tonight if you like at the sing singing he said what separation 1955 I often thought and wondered what's the matter with the church Christian Church they're so scared of things why you've got nothing to be scared about the first word nearly Jesus said after the resurrection fear not don't fear don't get scared there ain't nothing nothing going to happen because anything that happens to you is for you come on now come on God is a great God he's an omnipotent God he's omniscient God he's an omnipresent God so he knows exactly what you're going to go through no surprises so anything that happens for you is to build your character brother brah said in one place if job didn't have all those experience happen to him he would be a he would be a wishbone we go through these trials to build our character and a prophet said the only thing you take with you is your character so when you're having a trial you know what the Bible says you know what Peter said count it all joyu count it all joy Hallelujah okay I'll go this side this side STS responding count it all joy when you go through a trial okay I'll try this church side over here count it all joy when you go through a [Applause] trial why why not cuz nothing can happen to you that's like I said the other day if I died at the pulpit I'll be present with the Lord there's no fear perfect love cast out all fear Hallelujah nothing can happen nothing can bother a Christian whoa whoa we forgot to read these quotes years ago nothing can happen nothing can bother a Christian amen not even death itself can touch a Christian he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but has passed from Death To Life deep calling to the Deep my deep wasn't calling for hell it was calling for heaven so Heaven Came Down Heaven came down to you to defeat Satan in Satan's Eden [Applause] deep conquering Satan's Eden oh I want to do I man if I could do a victory dance i' dance over in fact I would jump over that Pulpit wouldn't that be something brother Bram actually said that poor what are they all dancing boat and all that sort of stuff and he says you know Lord what is that all that and all of a sudden he finds himself sitting on top of the pulpit swinging his legs how do you figure God out you cannot all I want is to do whatever he wants me to [Applause] do Hallelujah death itself has no Reign Over a Christian Christ died in our stad what marvelous what a faith that ought to build up into the people that that will tow the mark you you'll never get nothing by being a jellyfish I'm not looking at jellyfishes huh they're sting you know you go have you EMB stung by jellyfish you somebody that a jellyfish they're going to sting you uhhuh but I'm not looking at any jellyfishes so you don't have to worry about somebody stinging you huh yeah well if you ever get stung you'll really know what I'm talking about I was with a

fish we want a backbone that'll stand stand for the god-given right that Christ died for you am I there yet I'll I'll I'll move a few pages so we can get there yet then we'll finish we'll finish all right deep calling to the Deep call Colossians 13:14 for he rescued us from the Dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of his son in whom we have redemption and forgiveness rescued I know you're all why do you do that to me you're look I'm looking at you and then all a sudden you're looking up there and then I look up there and there's nothing there are you expecting it to go there just look this way okay I'm I'm winding down don't worry Colossians 2:15 tells us that Christ has disarmed the powers of all authorities and made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross Hallelujah so if they're all defeated what's your problem you're wrestling with a defeated devil that's right come on you're wrestling with something that's already been conquered amen God knew your deep was calling for victory yes sir let's end this service on this note we are his victory amen H amen because the deep in this heart in your heart has defeated Satan's Eden here we go here you go Mark 1412 verily verily I say unto you is what it did say verily verily I say unto to you he that believeth on me he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and a Greater Works than these shall you do because I go to my father so now he say well brother Brown did the great works well he did great works well now you're to do the Greater Works come on stay with me what's your deep calling for the Greater [Music] Works can you imagine to you you've read right you've read the Feast of the trumpets right we'll just say yes for all intenses purposes so we've all read it and we understand that 200,000,000 Supernatural demons have been loosed right right those are extra demons those were extras I don't know how many million billions were before them but those were extra ones right and guess what brother brah said they're after you Supernatural demons are after you uh-huh so am I worried about that huh my God defeated him and them at Calvary hallelujah

of that devil if they can do it in the Old Testament come on you're deep calling to the Deep says Satan I putting you under my feet [Music] Hallelujah deep Christ Hallelujah my lover Hallelujah my God lord I want to live your victory that your Prophet prophesied somebody is going to fulfill that prophecy right thank you Jay hello somebody's feeling it she will be a Victorious Church she will be a super church not will be not was she is cuz what your deepest calling for yeah you know what it offenses to me is people that try and theologically figure out this message well he didn't quite say that quote there you know I got a problem with that is Satan did that to Jesus right and he takes a scripture misplaces it gives it to the word himself and the word says it's also written Hall so a lot of people get this quote in their mind and then finally they come to you say you know what the prophet said on this but it's also written uhhuh that's what you got to get in the message that's why you got to get into Christ cuz if you don't know it how will he bring it back to you the Holy Ghost will bring it back to you yes Hallelujah still not there there we go we just skipped an hour at all yeah you have to come over and see me you are co-equal when does that happening presentent God is that what we preached untapped resources was preached so now your Prophet come turns around and says you who's the you behold I send you because your deep was calling to the Deep you amen are co-equal with God you know what I'm happy about it wasn't Matthew that said that or Michael exactly you are you you me and me me not one of us said that but Malachi 4 said that God came in flesh come on and he said to you you are co-equal with [Applause] God that's why you couldn't be born in any other age because your deep was calling to be co-equal with [Music] God I even thought get a few sisters standing up on that one finally I'm coequal with my husband I getting a few nods and smiles so I'll look at the ceiling it is tremendous Saints what this message is I can't love it enough I can't yell it enough I can't break down now I just don't know what to do sometime I Marvel at it say how did I find myself in thisy Zing great think about it how sweet this sound not just for for John whoever wrote it seem a rich like me I once was lost but now I'm found oh I I trust your coldness hasn't got taken away your tenderness I I really do you've lived some hard things I have too I've gone through some pretty tough trials don't you worry but it hasn't hardened me it hasn't hardened me it softens me I can give you quote after quote where the Prophet said at least three times you are co- equal with God you're co- equal with God you are co-equal with God I believe he's trying to get a point across to us the last service let's dedicate our hearts and say Lord my deepest really calling for you if you just want to Bow your head musician so and you come deep calling to the Deep I don't know I'm not close right now deep calling to the Deep maybe you could just lightly play to be like Jesus do you know that one very softly very softly very lightly Lord this is a dedication service we dedicated a Billy now we're going to dedicate our hearts I want my deep Lord to be ignited again maybe I've let things get too hard in my life too many complications heartaches and pains so Lord would you soften me as I dedicate myself at this little dedication service I just want to be like you Lord you say oh look at brother bradam they even called him Jesus Christ I would love somebody to call me that even though that was wrong and I and I'm saying that factiously but I would love to live a life that somebody would think I live so close to him so if you in your heart just want to lift up your hand to him in this little prayer say father father awaken my deep Lord and I would have thought every hand G him I really would God bless you and you and you knew and you knew all over the building of [Music] course to want more of Jesus is not something factious is that you just haven't had a a deeper deep call and if that is what your heart Desiring why don't you lift your heart to him heavenly father as The Pianist and organist will will play to be like Jesus hearts and lifted hands all over we not here to count Lord you just know every heart would you tenderize your people as we rededicate our lives to you Lord we don't want the hardness of Lea to start creating walls and causing hurts to harden our spirit Lord but we just want to be like you and in every area of Our Lives Lord yes where we've fallen and fell short there's the blood to wash us and cleanse us and that indeed I embrace this morning Lord for I fall many times but I know one thing I have a deep that has never been quenched and I just want more so for these blessed people that have come today given their lives and substance Lord to see this building built so they could worship you the true and living God I pray for this assembly I pray for these lives I pray for their hearts I pray for their families I pray for each one of us Lord to be like [Music] Jesus to [Music] be honor I to be [Music] like to Glory [Music] let's just sing it one more time to be like Jesus to be like [Music] Jesus to be [Music] to let's pray one more time father from the pastor who I dearly love Lord to sister lesie to all the ministry their wives children deacons trustees they've been mentioned this morning Lord they bear a burden a great burden and as these ones have lifted their hands and their hearts I I thank you for their kind response and I trust it's to you and not to me I pray that your glory will ever fill this Temple Lord and those that are unsaved become saved those that are sick may they be healed as they enter the doors of this little Tabernacle Lord if I should never see this group of people again I want them to know I left a part of my heart in Texas I love them with a great love you've allowed me for these many years to be here but father one of these days very near at us we'll be on our road home we no sorrow there we'll just be rejoicing so would you bless these dear friends of mine in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to be like Jesus [Music] all through last journey father to Lord I only I [Music] to be like amen amen you know this great Revelation and wisdom spoken you know God leads you from your heart he works from the inside out and I wonder this morning if maybe we've lost contact with our [Music] deep we've lost contact with that Holy unction inside of us when it tries to speak to us and tries to deal with us and and and and we know maybe we're not in the right attitude we know we're not going down the right Road and God's trying to speak to you he doesn't use your intellect he uses your heart and that's what he said God wants to be in the Throne of your heart yes that's what he wants to make contact with maybe you can play that little song called stay you know that song Stay that I I love we're not going to be long but I think that's what we really need is to come back in contact with our deep we can all stand together you know what makes this an individual Affair is each one of us has a deep each one of us has a place that he talks to us and that's what Satan's trying to cover up each and everyone that's in here has a soft spot in their heart that he's been reaching out to to touch that he can lead you he leads you by the Deep you say I want to be led of the Lord he's not going to lead you to your mind you'll mess it up but he touches that spot that he put in your heart and he begins to tug on it and if you'll listen to it and you'll let it pull you it'll lead you into Glory Grace forgiveness the an hope and eventually one day it'll lead you home yes and this whole world is Satan trying to keep you from making contact with that no matter how proud you are what you think you are thought and one day I didn't want to live anymore drugs had tore my mind up but praise God there was a predestinated deep oh yes and he reached down and he grabbed a hold of it and I know by the word of God that every person in here has that little deep spot that God touches and maybe fear has caused you to cover it up or maybe sin has got it covered up but that's what he wants this morning he's looking at us and said would you open back up the Deep so I can touch you that's right will you open back your heart so I can lead you and if you ever know what it's like to have them touch that spot and know it doesn't belong to anybody else it belongs to you and you know that it's it's it's it's for you and it's you him doesn't it doesn't matter it's mine I don't know why he chose me but he did and alls I want this morning is I want him to touch that deep again yes I want to be led from the inside again I want him to come close to me again you say well what about yesterday yesterday don't matter it's this morning maybe as we sing this song you and your own life with all your failures and all your mistakes would just turn your heart to him and say Lord awaken my deep Lord one more time just call my heart and and speak to me and call me and draw me hallu that's what it's all about it's me and you and your Prophet told me there was a deep in there and that that word would guide me and Lead Me into all truth and all righteousness so I ask you this morning do you know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord and not to know what time it is because time Stood Still that's the Deep would you renew your deep this morning you say oh wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a great healing service you'll get sick again wouldn't it be wonderful if the spirit rolled down and we shouted glory and praises to God that feeling will end but if you ever make contact with that deep that never goes away that's right it'll never leave you it'll never forsake you and no matter how far away you get from them like that little prodal son sitting in the pig Ted one day that deep renewed in him and he said in my father's house are many mansions let's that be our dedication the renewing of our deep that he can call us and touch us would you just become tender in front of them if you haven't had that deep say Lord renew a deep in me if you've never felt the Deep say Lord I want to I want to feel in my heart what that man preached about we're all the same in here we're all Sinners we all been called by this message it don't matter where we go to church it's the God we love and serve would you help me [Music] S to be in the presence of the Lord don't know one time it is [Music] still oh bodies were he [Music] family because we stand [Music] he in a presence of the [Music] Lord no one to say a word couldn't even [Music] aound I'll give up everything for this treasure I I never wanted to ra so I say I don't want you to go my heart is [Music] bur in your presence oh Lord please St I don't want you to go cuz my heart is burning in your presence oh [Music] Lord I want more I want more I Want [Music] More Jesus I want more oh and I want more I want more I Want More Jesus I want more so I'll stay oh where else could I go my heart is

burning your presence [Music] I don't want you to [Music] go my heart is burning in your [Music] presence we can live like that church we can live in presence we can live in his power we can live in his might and be a shining light to a Dying World don't let Satan steal this from you you're as children he's going to call to your hearts and I say here I am he'll convict us of sin and we'll say I'm sorry Lord and we'll be led because he sent a deep to call to a de God bless you thank you for dedicating our hearts and our lives and our fellowship with us and to our local members may you hear his voice and his call on your heart every day our gracious father we've come to an end of a time and yet we don't want to [Music] go but then you spoke those beautiful words on the leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end father that's what I want I want you to be with me every day I want to humble myself and say I'm sorry when I'm wrong when I fail I want to make it right I want to love my brother as you have loved me I want to forgive as you've forgiven me and I want you to speak to me Lord and call me call to my deep Lord I'm dedicating and renewing my heart to Incline itself to your [Music] voice I'm dedicating myself this morning to hear when you speak and when you speak to obey for that is greater than sacrifice Lord to hear your call and Lord I trust that you'd hear my prayer this morning that I desire a greater unity and a greater humility and a greater love amongst the bride one for another and may we remember it's not what we know but it's what
