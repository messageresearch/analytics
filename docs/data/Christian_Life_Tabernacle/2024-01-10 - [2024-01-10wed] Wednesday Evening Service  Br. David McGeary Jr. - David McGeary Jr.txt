Description:
Wednesday Evening Service
Br. David McGeary Jr.
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 10, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

early and worship a little with you our hearts are just burning for the things of God and we're thankful to be in the house of God gathered with the Saints if you take your Bibles and turn with me going to take a short reading and then have you be seated and then we'll proceed through the scriptures um just be in prayer for me we thankful that the Lord allowed us to come into his house tonight the Lord had seen us just in the past two weeks it seems maybe two and a half things evolved pretty quickly and we'll testify maybe a little of those things just to get started and and jump in But First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 a reading that we're familiar with uh as you find your place there but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither has it entered in the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him God bless you you may be seated and I wouldn't want to leave you there because that's not the end of the story um Paul as he's reading there he's referencing Isaiah it's it's Isaiah 644 and it would read a little different it says for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen oh God beside thee for what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him now the good news is what Paul would say next in the 10th verse but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God so you're going to see how here's a scripture it's laid up it's the word of God you all scriptures given by God and yet here's a anointed man of the hour that's going to come and then further the reading of this word and and and give you the secret of how this word is going to be imparted is by Revelation by the spirit of God and God hasn't changed his way he's the same yesterday today and forever if he did it that way if a man of God could come and take the the book of Isaiah one of the most notable Oracles of God one of the most profound prophets of the Old Testament and come to him and say hey it's by the spirit these things are revealed the the spirit of God searches the Deep things and they're revealed unto you and to the who loves him then that's a a pattern that God's still following today praise the Lord and we're the beneficiaries of that look God will set forth a prophecy that impacts the entire world to bless one person to to cause his word to come to pass for one person it it doesn't matter if the makeb believer gets blessed it doesn't matter if the unbeliever gets blessed he will bless them so the Cup's flowing he he's not going to if your Cup's going to overflow and bless the unbeliever he I'm sorry he doesn't say well my son I'm not going to have your cup overflow because the hypocrite next to you just might get a little blessed that that's not our god he's a God that looked at ishmail while he's crying underneath the tree and heard the cries of the lad that's my God he he's a he's a good God don't despise the riches and the blessings of God on anybody ever amen um the things that had moved upon our heart and that we wanted to to jump into were was actually from what our pastor had said and um the Lord had just kind of been dealing with my hard on something it seemed it it took a turn and we're going to read in Matthew chapter 7 and we're going to talk about what what has been revealed and our pastor would re reference this scripture it says the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light and you know our pastor as you continue to remember in prayer he he suffered about of blindness in his eye and I do believe while we're here the Lord allows things to transpire Because by the things which we suffer and the things we experience God is taking those things which are invisible the things that are unseen and declaring them here in the natural and we are as his children going to have a portion of things that in this flesh we endure so that we can understand the nature of God in a more perfect way but as you know Brother David lost Vision in his eye many of us were up here working when it happened and and he began to see out of his one eye as he mentioned in the Serv Serv and this scripture he was mentioning it with a passion and it struck me in my heart the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light if you back up it Jesus Christ is is teaching on where your Treasures are laid up he says in in verse 19 lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon the Earth where moth and rust do corrupt and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor dust or rust do corrupt where thieves do break through where thieves do not not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also and the the heart is really I think the conduit that the Lord's dealing with me on if we're going to see the Deep things if you're going to see the Revelation if you're going to see something there's a place that God is knocking to come in and S with you and eat the evening meal and to break the bread of life and that's the heart if those things are not being opened up to you then the heart has not opened all the doors all the rooms and your treasures and the things that you fixed your eyes upon believe it or not you're there's there's been a deception there's been something that's keeping you from being able to Feast at the table there's something that's caught your eye because your eye has to be single now the single a lot of you instantly thought of your social media status the single's not a social media status I may have lost a lot of you right there and it was like what what did I leave my status at was my status single um you know I think somebody was laughing somebody had set their status to married and they're like there's no way that person's married I think it was a you know but we but our status is married right we're married to Christ Our our heart is single you know you just thinking of it the scripture admonishes us those those who are married you know cares for the th you know cares for the things of the world but there's a spiritual aspect there when it's talking about how a man may please his wife how a wife may please her husband well as we're married to Christ what is what is our what are we focused on right how we may please Christ um there's only one thing that should be consuming our eyes so in in verse 23 it says If thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light if the light of thee be Darkness how great is that darkness no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and despise the other you cannot serve God in Mammon amen that's the Paradox I find you know brother brandom would never stop you know admonishing the believer to examine themselves to check up to make sure they knew the things that were in their lives and where their hearts were at um we're going to just try to dive into that because you know the the things I'm ministering to you are where I'm at I I want there's things that you know I want to see if you even go through in that in that chapter a precious verse me and my wife hold this over us it's verse 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you and if we're not seeing the pro the the being added then it then there's nothing wrong with God's promises amen we just have to step back and know that everything that we have need of has been provided within this message it is a word that's to dress a bride and it's going to produce what God sent it to do because every seed has to produce of its kind I thank God for that that we can't get away from the law of God that each seed has to produce of its kind um in things that are to be in in uh chapter 138 paragraph 138 um just uh give me a moment I did actually want to read a scripture before I jump to there it's uh 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18 so there's something we do want our eyes to be focused on uh we do know it's the word of God it's the anointed word for our day 2 Corinthians 3: 18 but we all with open face beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as the spirit of the Lord and I do believe we have on there the Amplified Bible I'm going to read from it because it kind of expounds I like to sometimes go over to this Onin Amplified and and read sometimes scripture so that's uh same same verse thank you and in all of us as with unveiled face because we continue to behold in the word of God as a mirror the glory of the Lord are constantly being transfigured into his own image in every increased Splendor and from one degree of Glory to another for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit amen don't you enjoy that as you behold the word of God as you're reading it it is transforming you into what it's declaring you know Matthew as he said what are you looking at right if you're emulating the reason why we're showing forth influences and showing forth and declaring things is because what we're looking at you know you cannot there's you cannot deny the law of influence upon you birds of a feather flock together you know that the shepherd around the Sheep starts to laugh like a sheep you know there's a there is going to be an effect by the things you look at that it's going to have upon you you you may think you're insulated from it but you do it enough you associate with something enough you start to parot it whether you like it or not hang you know you young men you hang around the wrong crowd you do the wrong vocabulary and all of a sudden you know you pick up these little ticks that other you know the group you're in has you know and you just you're behaving like the crowd you're in that's okay but the good news is is that you can be so impressed by the word of God because you're beholding it that you start to look and be at and reflect what's in there because there's something in you I guarantee you as a Son of God uh there's something in you crying for manifestation it reads the word of God and it says that's me that's me and it's crying for manifestation and there's a formula and we just want to be faithful to follow that um paragraph 138 look in your Looking Glass tonight and see which way am I headed is Jesus preparing a place for me a body that body is perfect that body walks orderly it's a son a daughter before God and I'm in birth pains in here I'll pick the mic up so you I uh notice a little feedback I'll do a little I I using the hand mic because I'm not sure where my voice is going to be and if it's going to go out but uh you just pray for us the body is perfect the body walks orderly it's a son a daughter before God and I'm birth pains here to be born into that body there if I still love the world it shows me that I'm not I have no body there I'm a church member I wasn't a germ of God I'm not he is not my father he said if you cannot stand chastisement that's what you're getting now then you're a bastard children and not children of God you're getting that now amen okay I if you're here in this flesh you're getting chastisement don't despise the chastisement be thankful that you're on the Potter's will Lord you care you know when we were in athletics if the coach didn't say anything to you he did he didn't care you're off the team but if he's telling you if he's giving you a hard time if he's knocking you upside the helmet if he's telling you do better it's because the potentials are there he's not wasting his time the P potential is there to do better as a Son of God if there's a if there's something in you that's thirsting there's a there's an answer to it I just don't want to be guilty of quenching The Thirst and that's that's my conviction I'm I'm standing before you saying Lord where are those other thirsts taking me where do they end up what's the wisdom of God because those I'll tell you the end of them it's death there is no other end of any other thirst outside of the thirst of God that's anywhere else but death we were over at the Bohanan in in little Abigail he was there to write something she said she had to write an essay on Eternal separation I'm like you what you know that's quite you must have some Christian curriculum well we' we've got we've got an Insight that no one else has into what it means to be predestinated what eternal life is what the life of God is and that you to have eternal life had to always have eternal life and the things that don't have representation are in essence eternally separated from God oh even a woman that liveth in sin is dead while she liveth if you don't have eternal representation your time is time your time is time and when it's time it's time you know brother brandham talks about that that sensation of falling he visited hell and he talks about nothing was there he said a consuming fire would have been better than that you know because we know that burning fire is the Holy Fire of God it's an unquenchable fire and it'll have its work but we don't believe in eternal hell you know okay this we we we're walking in a beautiful light Saints it's a it's a beautiful light um where was I bible say that amen amen if you cannot stand the chastisement of God when you see the scripture lining up and you say oh I don't want to hear that stuff I'm a Christian I do all right go ahead see it's one sure evidence you're not a child of God but a real child of God is hungering and thirsting why is there something in your heart telling you you want it and needs it yes Lord amen it shows there's something pul Satan trying to pull you there there's a body there let's pray the Lord keeps on motion there's a body there and this one a type of here what are you using this one for Saints this is you know I'm I I'm this is inditing me okay I didn't come up here with quotes to throw at anybody to glorify the devil and the world and the Fashions and things are you looking towards heaven and there's something up there you're glorifying god with your life you know there there's a suffering sometimes that we go through and I believe we're going through that as children of God you know no chastisement is Pleasant I'd like to rejoice in the things of God what I wanted to do is get up here and read this and talk about how Heaven's waiting you know the Lord showed brother Brandon beyond the curtain of time what it was like to see that crowd and that group of people run to him and there's something in me that says I don't want to miss that for anything and that's our reward I believe that's absolutely part of the treasure that our hearts should be set upon it should be saying I don't want to miss that the a prophet's message has come it's come to reveal the secret things the Deep things and it's it's ministered in entrance and if you despise those things it just it you know the the approach people have towards this message is a little scary sometimes it's not just an inspirational it's not another uh what do they call those things you know I I you read it I I recommend this doswald Chambers you know it's it's not just another in inspir uh inspired reading that you do you know if devotional this is not another devotional this isn't just a collection of men who you know been able to go through the Bible and combine things but this is a thus sayith the Lord message that is to prepare a bride and dresser and you have to have the wedding garment on there's not another one dressing the bride out this message is dressing the bride this is the dress way and so if he says to dress a certain way and to have your character shape a certain way and you're not then you're not dressed in the dress wear and part of the there's several things that are going to stunt the growth right the conditions the heart so brother brandom in one place he he was talking about how when he's he's seen a a stock of corn he said there was creepers that come in and they cuz Satan can't uh do anything but pervert okay if he and he can't keep the seed from producing after its kind it's a law of God so the only thing you could do is prevent it from being quickened and then start to stunt its growth and then try to pervert it when it starts to grow to prevent it from manifesting what the intended life that it's to do so what does he do is he sews creepers and that creeper comes in and it could be the cares of life it could be other things it could be and that's where we're at now right so we're we're every single one of us has a care of life if you didn't make it here then you probably didn't do you know what you have to tend to the things of this world I mean we're not so spiritual that I mean did anybody here not drive and just teleported here it's scriptural I mean you can come here but most of us had to tend to Something in the natural to get here right so while we're having to tend to Natural Things that is all the potential Satan needs to start to choke out the potential the manifested the manifesting of the Son of God because you have a carnal mind and the carnal mind's at iny to with God and I'm sorry but going and getting gas isn't necessarily a spiritual Endeavor but we do all you know I didn't mean to go there but I I want to mention this I was at the gas station yesterday and a and a Gentleman uh there andy you know a gas pump isn't a place that normally you expect this I don't even know how the conversation started I don't believe I see him here but he uh in just short order we start we started talking about the Lord and he'd been he'd done five tours he'd been in Afghanistan and he'd been in Iraq he was a Gunner he said he'd seen everything he'd seen a lot of things and he had just buried a friend and I and I reminded I said we're on the short side here you know this isn't this isn't what we're living for and uh we started Fellowship about the Lord and my heart goes to men that have done this country service you know I feel as Christians we're not living the way we are there's a lot of people paying higher prices for a lot more temporal things when we've have the Kingdom of Heaven set before us and we're not even putting the skin in the game you know men like that and we won't hit our knees Lord help me you don't understand the price that guy paid we're fools to think of ourselves more than we are we need God pardon me I don't know where I was at I'm going to just read this there's something in US calls us to live and there's something in US calls to do right then God will call somebody to the platform or to the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth we're thankful for that it shows you then that if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going there he's gone to prepare you you you got a real word bride of Christ amen but uh I I feel that just I to read this this was really upon my heart to do I'm going to do it there's other things but I think this is part of the the tempering right I said as the as the the cares in the life would choke you out that was the creeper right and I just and I think what I meant to say is you know there's many just cares right as a soldier uh and the things he did I would you know those are things that in some ways were a lot of necessary you know something has to pay a price in order for us to have freedom and other for families to be preserved and the ultimate price of that is the lives that are laid down for others that others might live and enjoy the benefits we live but those cares of Life are not uh meant to have those influences on a Believer but we give all things to Christ and I you know in my backyard we had a a creeper on a plant and I seen how it deforms I could that that plan of mine could never produce the what it was intended to I believe it's a Indian ha uh um it's a some sort of blooming plant and it we've had it for over 10 years and it's finally coming into maturity but as it was starting to get finally hit a stride we had uh I believe it was a either a morning glory or 5:00 it's a Vine that has some BL moms and it started to to creep around this thing and completely canopied it and had suffocated it and now it would be pretty it's pretty going along the fence post and I I think what they say is a a weed is a uh is someone's flower Mis misplaced and and cares need to be in their proper place if they're in the if they get if they're given the preeminence over something that something's not going to flourish the way it should you have to pull it back you have to trim it back you have to keep it off and you know some flowers are good in some places and not others so you know if if that little creeper or that little boy or the girl that let if that's someone else's flower let it go ahead and go somewhere else you know there you go someone can use that you know a flower misplaced as someone else's creeper don't put fertilizer on it choke it out Amen brother Brandon preceding this paragraph It's paragraph 115 he's laying it in pretty heavy he's talking about depart from me ye that do iniquity I never knew you but 115 he says see what I mean oh little children do you feel the need of that vitamin tonight that something there's a body waiting Yonder there's a body waiting to be received people don't be deceived don't be deceived the Devil is a deceiver even the wedding garment you must wear it it must be now we at the evening time the Earthly body is now ready to be dissolved and we're prepared to enter the Heavenly and we now feel the strange call of God to go to the Eternal great e to that to this great Eden and before we were born here our little bodies cried for something and that had to be provided or we'd be afflicted children so think of that if if the mom didn't provide the right nurture to the child then it would be an Afflicted child and if we're not in the Right image that we need to be in it's because we're not getting the vitamin brother brandom's giving us a key here the pull for that vitamin is from the Heavenly it's from that Eternal being your ey should be single upon it because that's going to draw you to the necessary vitamin amen God has no afflictions up there there everyone perfectly lined up the bride just exactly like the groom thank you Lord the word manifested in its season God grant tonight children each and every one of you now season so critical and don't despise the season you're in the there's a there's a maturing there's a growth there's something to be done in the season you're in me and sister Julia were in uh Switzerland we had taken a a a train and on our way up I mean we had the opper you know it's kind of like while we're here let's go to the top and uh you know it's like man the price is tripled it's like but I'm not going to have this chance again and we're on the train and this this local lady she's there she's like what are you guys doing where you from where you going she's real friendly until we told her we were going to the top and then she looked at us like we were idiots what are you doing and uh okay you know she gets off and she has her walking sticks it's green she's got her walking shorts on and off she goes beautiful day 70° weather there she goes well we started to go up and up and up and all of a sudden we were in the clouds and all of a sudden it was really really cold and all of a sudden we were just in a bunch of snow and we got off at the station at the top and we read the sign and it was like pictures of how they could have a basketball court up there and how they had the highest altitude basketball game in the world and you're looking around like oh they did all this up here they had an ice tunnel to go from one place to the other there was nothing up there it was the wrong season okay you get your head in the clouds in the wrong season they ain't nothing for you there you need to come back down a little bit get out of the clouds let our heart start to be molded and shaped so we can receive the things of the Lord that he has for because what he wants is your heart at the end of the day it's your character and what's knowledge do it puffs up so do you think as the wide Ste as wise as he is is he just going to go pour it all on you when you don't have the character if you want knowledge get ready for the character and get ready for it on the front end okay everybody praying for Revelation now I mean I am I I don't mean that wrong but you know it it's it's not we're not here to to beat people up with what we know right we want to have the life that's salty and that can convert and change things and most of all we want a presence he's willing to be around right we want the Lord to to drop in and and talk to us and uh if if our hearts are not in the place to do that then you you're not taking a body change cuz that was what Enoch did as he walked with God but I want to remind us of what brother Brandon would see in paragraph 118 it's a short reading I'm but I'm going to it's not not maybe the shortest reading was what I mean to say but in really context it's short for what we can see he says but that morning when I felt something come over me and I thought usually like a vision comes and I looked and I looked I thought my what is this and I looked a great Green Hill and young woman was coming from Everywhere by the tens of the thousands hundreds of thousands and they were all coming long hair hanging down their back white robes on barefooted screaming hollering our brother I thought now that's strange turned back around and looked and there I laid there and there was my wife laying there in the bed and I said now you know what I died he's describing how this wasn't a typical Vision I said that that's what happened I've died and I said I might have had a heart attack or something I've died the lay there lays my body and I was just laying there with the hands back like that and just stiff and I thought that's not 20 ft from me and there I was looking I thought that there's my wife there and there's everything and there's my shirt hanging there on the bed post there and I thought here I am and I looked around again and these women were all coming and they were looking coming this way and they were coming my brothers oh they're genuine all of them looked to be young men they were screaming our precious brother oh I don't know what to think I thought this is strange I looked back and I wasn't an old man I was young I thought this is strange thing I thought is this a vision I'd bite my finger I thought no this ain't a kind of vision I've had then there something began to talk to me up here and said you've entered with your people and I thought with my people are they bandoms he said they're your converts to Christ and these women Saints that's our prize that's what should be the singleness of our heart and the singleness of our mind um and there's a necessity that our heart be in the condition to receive the message because we don't want to miss it and we are on this side where there is chastisement and a bastard child doesn't withstand the correction and there's besides the now that's when the seed's growing okay there's a there's a calling to repentance uh and that's a conviction that leads to a conversion to a new heart but don't think that you know the once you're converted once you're serving God that the need for the corrective pruning of God goes away you know that's that's the danger of religion and that's and that that's message religion too you know that's the danger of we get results don't we the presence of God is with us if you're not being corrected you're a bastard child thank God for the correction I if really you've arrived at a place where there's no correction I mean Lord forgive me there may be somebody there I you know please tell me how you got [Laughter] there you know but I I see it as my life personally has to be shaped by this word yes and um I see that there I need there's a greater calling for me in to have the uh The Inheritance that's ours I hope by putting the prize of crossing over puts that out there for everybody cuz I feel that if you're still here then that should be at least the if you've climbed the pentacle of the stature of the perfect man and you're sitting at love and you can the guy cut you off at traffic and you uh you bless them and you know there's and if you've arrived then all then you still have a something to have a singleness of heart upon you can set that the vitamins of that body should still be such a pull on you that it's causing a desperation that says Lord oh I want to run up to my bre brandom and say my precious brother I want to be with that with all those Saints I want to be in that redeemed body Hallelujah I mean I'm looking for it and the more you the more you pile on this body the more I'm looking for it see Satan's C tooken his own snare the very things he thinks is going to accomplish something he's going to discourage you just pushes you closer to God the very things that he thinks he's going to well I'm going to get him with this one what what he's thanking God in the storm I know the master of the wind what what's going on here that must be a oops he done stuck the Stinger in the wrong one again you know Hallelujah you know it the uh don't let the Scarecrow take your blessing I don't care what the tactic is of the enemy let's expose it yes sir and and for me I want to get I think part of the the tactic of the enemy is he's he's you know a single eye you know let's think about just even the definition of single it's the whole right so if may may not make any half of you are not going to get this joke there's and this wasn't the joke there's and there's no place for jokes all right we'll just move on but it it it helps prove the point point but it's not necessary the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of life right that's what we're taking of a a text from so Psalms in Psalms 9:1 it says I'll praise thee Oh Lord with my whole heart I will show forth all of thy marvelous works the whole that we're speaking of here is is is is at not in part or the single is is a whole or not in part so if your I be single means that it's not divided you know in things and Jesus makes it very clear it says you can't serve two masters or you're going to despise one or the other and brother brandom I have the quote in here somewhere it's so beautiful he says that's the problem with us we've got one eye on the world and one eye on Calvary and we're not you know you got just enough religion to make your s miserable and you're not going to produce the fruits that are necessary your heart has to be wholly given to him and in order for him to have the work that he that he wants to to have um I do have I did think I was going to go in a totally different direction but the Lord just W really impressed upon my heart that heaven's waiting on us and but in order to do that we have to keep our hearts with all diligence you know the the message and the and part of the the Turning of the heart it is the Mysteries that turns the heart but really the condition that the heart had to be in to even receive the truths you have to recognize the the authority of the prophet's message because otherwise you think that you you're going to presumptuously think that some of it is uh I it's incredible but this is not a new tactic of the enemy he uses the same tactic against the Bible but he'll say it was out of it it's out of its season you know that was brother brandom just being influenced by by the the political climate of the age well they say the same thing about the scripture when it says I suffer a woman not to teach or Ser authority over man that she should be silent in the congregation well that that's not an inspired word that that was just a word that was you know that should be seen in the light of its age and you your eyes is not single you've set your eye on you're hearing some other voice you don't realize it but you're already starting to garnish your garment with something else and it isn't the the dress wear that Christ is taking a bride in so it would behoove you to understand that there's only one way that God wants his dried bread his bride dressed amen um and you have to be wholly given to that and the and wisdom is ultimately to be able to consider the end of the matter okay and if you understand that all those efforts are vain all those efforts are going to perish they're not the Garment that God's been given Then I then I hope that would give you the wisdom to say then Lord take it from me whether it's the cares of the world or false religion or anything like that what we want is to have the will of God in our lives um and be moved and used by him ask the musicians if they would come for for Saints I hope that the word has dealt with your hearts I pray for me I I desire the Lord would have a a greater portion for me as we read this quote it's not believe the Lord can take us higher I believe he has a greater portion for us you're willing to say I accept Jesus as my personal savior I'll quit my bad habits but come down to the Jordan where you have to die out where all the things of this world all your friends and everything has forsaken you keep your eye on him alone then what he said I'm going to go with you right through Jordan amen I like that why I'm going to be a witness of this and he passed through Jordan notice here it is I want you to get it after he crossed Jordan he said what will you that I do for you that's what Christ wants to know of the church tonight after you're separated from the things of the world after you become a new creature in Christ Jesus after you're born again filled with the Holy Ghost crossed over Jordan all the things of the world is dead behind you now ask what can I do for you I like this he said that a double portion of your spirit come upon me that preacher knowed what he was talking about a double portion because I want to witness that much more he said you've asked a hard thing but if you see me when I go away it shall be what you ask you shall have my brother you talk about a preacher watching another one he was really watching them that's what the church ought to be doing tonight for a double portion of the spirit is watching Christ watching the Holy Ghost the way it moves notice he said you've asked a hard thing but he couldn't keep one eye on the the world and one eye on Elisha he had to put both eyes straight on Elisha and follow him amen the trouble of it is tonight we got too many Christian people profession Christians got one eye on the world and the other one on the cross you'll fall as sure as the world let your eye be single let your heart be single let your thoughts be single amen God bless you go play something Joseph if we even played watch the eagle in the sky again that would be fine let's sing [Music] that oh there are two roads you may take one by side we can stand together one byth take the word of God what you see what you is what [Music] me to the W [Music] you can in a higher do not strugle it's by gra [Music] s to the wind [Music] of what you need Oh My Cry you Mountain to take word the word of [Music] God hallelujah oh you willly set [Music] your to the Ws of you in a higher strong is my PR [Music] there was a quote I I didn't find it I had a lot in it a lot that spoke to me brother brandom said a young girl come up to him she had warts on her legs and I could imagine if she was even in that audience when he was saying that there was an embarrassment there was an approach to that said he picked her up and he' prayed with her he said the Lord was wanting to get her before the cares of the world that hardened her heart and choked it out I thought oh lord it's such a tender age you wanted there was a necessity to get there and make sure that your spirit was able to touch the child and have her get to know you before the cares of the life what effect has this world had on me that I'm not aware of what has the cares done what are the things that I've seen caused that I I don't even know of David even prayed for the iniquity he knew not but Lord I'm convinced that there's a greater reality that body's calling there's a reflection of you I've got to manifest and if it's because there's been the devil sprayed a little pesticide on me he stunted the growth Lord you're the one who can cure it I want my heart to be single Lord I want to be purified by you I want to be found in your image I just fellowshipped with you those things you know the Lord dealt with my heart I thought I was going through a sickness that could have even been terminal um just even a week ago I was losing my strength and would uh almost faint didn't have the the strength that it would just they put me on antibiotics and things are better they're still wanting to do imaging and things like that you know they found in the process of trying to find why David was acting so weak and they H did Imaging and found a a something in my lung they want to look at further we know that we're not worried about that I you know they want to find out if it's cancerous and I'm like I know the diagnosis already by a Stripes I'm Healed you know i' I've got a I've got a body that's mine but you know we're in this battle with you guys and and uh we covet your prayers and we ask you to forgive us I feel that we have hav't been diligent the way we should but God's calling us higher I want that double portion I want that my eye to be single pray for our pastor and uh God bless you [Music] all amen amen isn't that wonderful that's our heart's desire you know the word of God is given us to us for us to overcome with it it it's not something that's given to scare us or it's something that we we can enjoy and partake of it and know that we're going to have Victory you know I was thinking even as our brother was speaking I the the scripture speaks in Psalm 17 and verse1 15 it says as for me I will Behold thy face in righteousness I shall be satisfied when I awake in thy likeness you you you keep looking at it you keep partaking of it you keep standing there every moment every hour your eyes Focus to it it will bring about the change that's no question that's not something you can Wonder you stay with it with the word and it will you know I was thinking in in the technology world we have this word we say this word is called a sprit a split brain condition and that happens when one part is doing one thing and another part is doing another as Christians we can't we can't be like that we can't we can't try to please the world and I mean it's amazing the scripture is so plain but every day that's the fight we fight to try to mix them both and try to make the world work and try to make Christianity work and I mean we feel like there's somehow a way we can combine the two and get it working while the scripture says you cannot do it it's not going to produce Oh I thought just just to just come with the singleness of heart if the word of God is true and the only way we prove it to be true is when you put everything in it yes it's not when you come testing it and trying to find well well if if it's true then I'll go no it's when you have cut out everything you have no other option it's either the word or I die that's when it works it's not when you know you're probing and trying to figure out God he wants all of you he wants all of us he wants everything he wants every part of us he wants us to believe they until every unbelief in US is taken away and it's not to us for us to go take it away his word takes it away out of us but the way is to stay there to continually partake of the word of God and let it cleanse us let it wash us let it bring us into the image of the perfect son but if we are here today we go partake here tomorrow we do if there's no singleness of hearts and singleness of eye to be able to make sure thy eye is single th heart is single to the word is not going to produce what it promised it will be like what our brother talked about something is choking it causing it not to produce 100% my heart desire is if I'm producing 10% Lord let me produce 20 let me move up to 30 let me move out until I get to 100% because your word can do more than I can even think or imagine and if we can partake of it it's here to produce what it promise there's going to be a bride in the last day there's nothing that's going to stop that if God said there will be a bride there's going to be a bride whether we want it we don't want it whether we believe it we don't believe it somebody is going to produce that why because it's the word of God it's the reality of God our gracious father we're so thankful for your word oh God and Father you truly spoke to us Lord Jesus every once in a while it's we like to just do our own inventory and just weigh ourselves oh God and to see if we getting lacks or if we we are being drained or being taken away or a detour by the things of the world or our Focus gets taken away a little bit Lord father we want to focus on you Lord and and as our brother said Lord your word is here to give us everything we have need of Lord we don't have to look at in somebody else's field or to look away somewhere far father father we Look to You Lord the author and the finisher of our faith and the one who said that he that started the work he will finish it and the one who said that I'll be with you even in You Until the End Lord there's no condition to difficult there's no situation to complicated the enemy is try is the one who tries to throw all those complications into to the mix but father we know that you have a word that can come and make a way clean and and and take unrighteousness that we were in and take us out of it and make it righteous oh God and and make a way so we could come and worship you so we can come and and and be partakers of your divine nature and be changed in the image of your perfect son Lord we desire that more than anything Lord and that your word may do the work in US Lord your your scripture says that your word has the power of transformation that it will come and and and and it will bring out of us the things which you have promised it will come to manifest at the end time bless all right Lord and just father Philip is Cup tonight even up till he overflows Lord and father he came and he spoke his heart and Lord we heard the word of God and I believe what we heard is what you had in store for us to hear tonight that we may be be more sincere more committed more uh with the singleness of our hearts and Lord that we may uh pay more attention to the decisions and the things that we're making to know that father that we are placing our eyes on you and not on anything else help us I pray Lord where we've come short and fill us with your spirit every day Lord we desire your spirit more than anything Lord and father a spirit that can come and take the word like what we're heard tonight and Quicken it into the hearts of a Believer and make it live Lord that's what we desire Lord help us Lord and that we may walk according to your will and way father remember our pastor and those that are out we continue to pray for him Lord that you will bring healing to his eyes and that you continue to strengthen him father as we depart from this place we pray that you be with each one and protect us through the week and if you will we'll meet again on Sunday Lord we are a people for you Lord we we we we we we our heart's desire is to stay in your presence every moment every hour Lord and to just to Worship You To Praise You Lord and and I pray that if we fell short any moment any time Lord that you look at our hearts and you help us Lord and bring us back into the fold and lead us to the way of everlasting we love you Lord and commit everything to you and ask those things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Amen key of f amen Lord I need you oh I need you every hour I need you my one
