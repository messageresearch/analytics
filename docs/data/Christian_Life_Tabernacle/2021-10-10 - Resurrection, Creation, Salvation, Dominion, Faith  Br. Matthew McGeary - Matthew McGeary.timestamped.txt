[45:34] we stand before you lord with no sin and
[45:38] no fault no failure not because of what
[45:40] we've done lord but because of what
[45:42] you've done and you've called us in such
[45:44] a day and age lord at the very climactic
[45:47] time to the catching away of your bride

[46:08] break the bread of life lord as only you
[46:10] can we surrender ourselves now to you

[46:45] uh just
[46:46] by god's grace gonna fill in and
[46:49] um
[46:51] worship the lord and just look for what
[46:52] the lord would have and just pray that
[46:55] maybe in a a reading of a few scriptures
[46:57] and quotes that we'd be blessed
[46:59] amen so we're just trusting in the lord
[47:02] amen while you're just turning there if
[47:03] you also want to mark another portion of
[47:05] scripture we'll be reading out of john
[47:06] chapter 14.
[47:09] but we just want to bring you greetings
[47:10] from um
[47:11] brother gabriel um
[47:14] in
[47:15] romania and arad romania um he is a
[47:18] brother that we've we've come to know
[47:21] and appreciate greatly
[47:22] me and brother cosman had the the
[47:24] opportunity to go minister at uh several
[47:27] churches in romania and so we bring um
[47:30] greetings from brother gabriel and
[47:32] brother florine and just other pastors
[47:34] uh throughout the romania area i believe
[47:36] we're at seven different
[47:38] churches and just it was such a
[47:40] privilege and an honor to meet the bride
[47:42] of jesus christ
[47:44] uh over there in romania just to think
[47:47] of what this word has produced it's
[47:49] produced the cream of the crowd
[47:51] and you know you go into some of these
[47:52] other countries and you go down into
[47:54] certain areas where it's poverty and you
[47:57] know that that country was stricken by
[47:59] uh communism and it's just uh
[48:02] you go in there and then you see the
[48:04] saints of god all gathered together and
[48:06] and just in into the yard of someone's
[48:08] house there wasn't enough room in the
[48:09] house so they just all gathered out in
[48:11] the yard and and come together praising
[48:13] god and it's the same spirit the same
[48:16] word the same god and it's just humbling
[48:18] to be a part of that and so uh we just
[48:21] bring you greetings from all of them and
[48:23] and uh
[48:25] we're just thankful we had an
[48:26] opportunity to be sent by the local
[48:28] assembly here so uh me and brother

[48:35] so we'll be working on that that
[48:37] we can bring you up to date amen
[48:39] praise the lord
[48:40] so just reading out of genesis chapter 1
[48:44] in the beginning god created the heaven
[48:45] and the earth and the earth was without
[48:47] form and void
[48:48] and darkness was upon the face of the
[48:50] deep and the spirit of god moved upon
[48:52] the face of the waters and god said let
[48:55] there be light
[48:56] and there was light
[48:58] and also let's read out of john chapter
[49:00] 14.
[49:05] verse 12.
[49:09] it says verily verily i say unto you he
[49:11] that believeth
[49:14] on me the works that i do
[49:18] shall he do also
[49:19] and greater works than these shall he do
[49:22] because i go unto my father
[49:25] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[49:27] that will i do
[49:29] that the father may be glorified in the
[49:31] son
[49:32] if you ask anything in my name i
[49:35] will do it
[49:36] amen lord jesus we just ask a blessing
[49:39] upon the reading of your word in jesus
[49:41] christ's name we pray amen you may have
[49:43] be seated
[49:45] man we'll just
[49:47] um
[49:48] just look how the lord might lead in
[49:50] this service just to maybe start out
[49:53] i love the message brother branham
[49:55] preaches
[49:57] look away to jesus in december
[50:00] 29 1963 and brother branham would start
[50:03] out in that service and he would start
[50:05] to talk about his ministry and about how
[50:07] the pillar of fire appeared down there
[50:09] on the ohio river
[50:11] in 1933 about two o'clock in the
[50:13] afternoon
[50:14] and you'll you'll notice that even when
[50:17] brother branham is preaching christ the
[50:18] mystery of god revealed about almost uh
[50:21] to the day 30 years later brother
[50:23] branham would say after preaching christ
[50:25] the mystery of god revealed i believe
[50:26] was july 28 1963 he would say if if
[50:30] you'll turn around me not knowing it but
[50:32] if you turn around and look at the clock
[50:34] it's two o'clock on the dot it's the end
[50:35] of the second pull the third pull is at
[50:38] hand and brother brandon would start to
[50:40] go through this this uh look away to
[50:42] jesus and he'd start to talk about the
[50:44] beginning of his ministry and he would
[50:45] start to talk about the first pool and
[50:47] the second pool and he would make this
[50:49] statement and he would say on in the the
[50:52] 60-second paragraph here and look away
[50:54] to jesus he'd say and now the third
[50:56] thing has taken place see constantly
[51:00] moving on and so now he's identifying
[51:02] that the third pull
[51:04] has now been come into manifestation and
[51:06] i just liked how he said this he said
[51:08] constantly moving on because jesus
[51:11] christ is the same yesterday today and
[51:12] forever he is the i am he is the god of
[51:15] history but he is the god of right now
[51:18] so god is actually doing something right
[51:20] now we know the third pool was revealing
[51:23] christ and so christ has been revealed
[51:25] and christ is among us but christ the
[51:28] word is actually doing something in a
[51:30] people he's accomplishing something
[51:32] right now and i like how the prophet
[51:34] identifies it he says just constantly
[51:37] moving on so we want to be moving with
[51:39] the word we we we recognize what god has
[51:42] done and we know what god is going to do
[51:45] but then we want to recognize it's very
[51:47] important as believers we don't get
[51:48] trapped into the ways of man where we're
[51:51] always looking into the past we're
[51:53] always looking toward into the future
[51:55] and yet god has given us such a great
[51:57] word and a great manifestation of the
[51:59] scriptures in the end time and we
[52:01] rejoice in those things but in our
[52:02] rejoicing we don't want to lose sight of
[52:05] what that word and that life of jesus
[52:07] christ is actually doing in the bride
[52:09] right now and so just if i could say
[52:12] just as uh as marvelous as those things
[52:15] were that we can identify and rejoice
[52:17] that the pillar of fire appeared down on
[52:19] the ohio river in 1933 and that we could
[52:22] look at how the prophet would identify
[52:25] that the third pool has now been
[52:26] manifest manifest and we look back and
[52:28] we rejoice in those things that have
[52:30] been manifested if you would say in a
[52:33] way of history but jesus christ he is
[52:35] the i am it's a present word so that was
[52:38] just the word being manifested that was
[52:41] just the word taken on flesh and so
[52:43] jesus christ is still living he's still
[52:45] alive he's still amongst us that the
[52:47] word is still moving and now it's moving
[52:49] in a people it's constantly moving on
[52:52] his word is is constantly unfolding and
[52:54] so we want to be careful and have that
[52:56] revelation that we're continuing to move
[52:58] with the word not just looking back not
[53:01] just looking forward but to understand
[53:03] that god has actually gathered a people
[53:05] together that's what the third poll was
[53:07] it was a shout it was the bread of life
[53:09] going forth gathering the bride of jesus
[53:11] christ together where the carcass is the
[53:14] eagles will be gathered oh we've we've
[53:16] recognized the word in the last day that
[53:18] has been revealed and it's caught our
[53:20] attention and it's gathered us together
[53:22] to christ the word but now christ the
[53:24] word is wanting to take on flesh he's
[53:26] wanting to take on your skin as we look
[53:28] into the scriptures and we see the word
[53:30] manifested in moses we see the word
[53:32] manifested in david we see that the
[53:34] prophet isaiah would prophesy and say a
[53:36] virgin shall conceive and we'd see mary
[53:38] would play out her part and certain uh
[53:40] the patriarchs would play out their part
[53:42] until the fullness of the word would
[53:44] come and be made flesh and then he would
[53:46] be waved over their people
[53:48] on calvary the sheaf wave and then he'd
[53:50] be waved back to them on the day of
[53:51] pentecost and they would fulfill the
[53:53] prophecy of joel 2 28 that i'll pour out
[53:56] my spirit upon all flesh and there they
[53:58] come out of the upper room and they're
[53:59] saying this is that what was it it was
[54:01] the word that had been prophesied that
[54:04] same pillar of fire the same word now
[54:06] was moving on in a people that same word
[54:09] that jesus christ was the manifestation
[54:11] of now he had ascended to heaven but he
[54:13] said i will not leave you comfortless
[54:15] but i will send the comfort unto you so
[54:17] now that logos that same pillar of fire
[54:19] that was resident there and our savior
[54:21] jesus christ had now changed god and
[54:23] morphe into another dispensation and now
[54:26] god and murphy had changed into a
[54:27] dispensation of the son of god through
[54:30] the church ages and now he's living out
[54:32] in his people the bride and so we always
[54:34] want to recognize as the word continues
[54:36] to unfold and we want to see that word
[54:38] unfolding in our life that's what i want
[54:41] i want to see this message i want to see
[54:43] this word i want to see it unfolding in
[54:44] me i want this word to become a reality
[54:47] i don't want to just be believing
[54:49] something historically and believing for
[54:52] something in the future but the word
[54:54] actually has fruits and it actually has
[54:56] a manifestation and it actually has a
[54:58] life and that's what the word was given
[55:00] for because god had placed a seed inside
[55:03] of you a word seed and so he sent his
[55:05] word light that would strike the word
[55:07] seed that would bring forth all of the
[55:09] potentials that god had placed in that
[55:11] seed that was the purpose of this
[55:13] message in malachi 4 5 that god in his
[55:16] mind would predestinate a people and
[55:18] he'd place you here in ladies here
[55:20] knowing that we'd be living in satan's
[55:22] eden it would be the wickedest of all
[55:23] ages and god would know that in this
[55:26] great wickedness the darkness of all
[55:28] ages i am going to reserve a people for
[55:31] me just like the prophet would come to
[55:33] jesus and said oh only i have escaped
[55:35] and god said what are you talking about
[55:37] i have seven thousand that i've reserved
[55:39] that not have been the need to bill i
[55:41] want to say god has reserved a bride in
[55:44] the end time that one that bowed to the
[55:46] god of this hero age that will not bow
[55:48] to the things of satan's eden but we
[55:51] have we have been reserved we have been
[55:52] preserved we have been predestinated to
[55:55] stand in the evil day oh hallelujah
[55:58] thank god that his mind was towards you
[56:00] because if it wasn't for god's word if
[56:02] it wasn't for his thoughts toward you oh
[56:04] these are my thoughts that i think
[56:06] towards you not thoughts of evil but
[56:08] thoughts of peace to bring you into an
[56:10] expected end oh saints don't you know
[56:12] that god has something expected of you
[56:14] he expects for you to make it he expects
[56:17] for you to overcome he expects for death
[56:19] to be swallowed up in victory he expects
[56:21] for you to put your head on the enemy
[56:24] why because you are the very word that
[56:26] he's been predestinated to be here it's
[56:28] him in you greater is he that is in you
[56:31] than he that is in the world that's a
[56:33] revelation that we want to come into
[56:35] understanding in a greater way to know
[56:37] that god is in you
[56:40] you're not the one that's willing it's
[56:42] god in you that is willing to fulfill
[56:44] the word oh praise god that we are in
[56:47] his mind from the very beginning that
[56:49] god had these thoughts for you
[56:53] so we want to play out our part
[56:56] we we see all the saints of all they
[56:58] they played out their part and mary and
[57:01] and the patriarchs and and paul and all
[57:04] them but then it comes down to our day
[57:06] what does the prophet say we're writing
[57:08] another book of acts
[57:10] we can look in the bible the infallible
[57:12] word and we could read names in there
[57:15] we could read about the apostles we
[57:17] could read about paul we could read
[57:19] about david and abraham and we
[57:22] reverenced that because it's written in
[57:23] the scripture oh but i want to say unto
[57:25] you your name was written in the lamb's
[57:28] book of life before the world was ever
[57:30] formed you also have a part in the word
[57:33] of god your name was written oh
[57:36] hallelujah it's in this day that the
[57:38] very names that were written in the
[57:40] lamb's book of life you got to recognize
[57:42] your part in the word
[57:44] that's what the opening of the seals was
[57:46] doing it was revealing to you who you
[57:48] are it was revealing christ but it was
[57:50] revealing the bride it was calling your
[57:52] name that's why the prophet of god could
[57:54] say you've heard from your theophany
[57:57] you've heard from your theophany why
[57:59] because we're part of that word our
[58:01] names are written in the word
[58:03] so maybe as we just try to move a little
[58:05] further just the prophet is identifying
[58:08] now that the third thing
[58:10] has has been properly identified it's
[58:12] been manifested but it's constantly
[58:14] moving
[58:15] i want to move with it
[58:17] it's constantly moving i want to move
[58:19] with the pillar of fire i want to move
[58:21] with the message i want to move with the
[58:23] leading of the lord
[58:24] whether the bride of jesus christ isn't
[58:26] just sitting back and waiting and saying
[58:28] we've done our part we've heard the word
[58:30] now we're just going to sit here and
[58:31] wait but no the word is living in an
[58:33] action in a people
[58:36] the word is living in an action in a
[58:38] people
[58:39] well come on let's aim in the word
[58:41] tonight
[58:42] i i might be boring you but the things
[58:44] that i'm saying is the word of god we
[58:46] either believe it or we don't why don't
[58:47] we just do a little second boy say amen
[58:49] i know i know we're familiar with these
[58:51] things but that's all right i want to
[58:53] say jesus christ save you i can't help
[58:55] it i got saved by jesus christ so every
[58:58] time i hear something in me rejoices i
[59:00] just can't help it that story never gets
[59:02] told you want to say god's a healer i
[59:04] say amen you want to say he's a
[59:05] deliverer i say amen there's something
[59:07] inside of me that can't help to respond
[59:10] to the word because if you've ever been
[59:11] there hallelujah have you ever been
[59:13] there where you were down and out and
[59:15] you had no hope and you tried within
[59:17] yourself to be delivered and you're
[59:19] bound by all these things but then jesus
[59:21] christ came and he set you free oh i
[59:23] love to hear other people's testimony i
[59:25] love to hear the word of god because it
[59:27] identifies with me something inside of
[59:29] me just says yea and amen so look if
[59:32] you've heard it before just get behind
[59:33] it just a minute because somebody else
[59:35] here might not have heard it before
[59:37] somebody else might just be hearing
[59:38] their name for the first time
[59:41] we ought to rejoice in these things it's
[59:43] only two or three times out of the week
[59:45] amen
[59:47] this is what i live for i live for the
[59:48] word of god
[59:50] oh there's nothing else i lift for the
[59:52] things of the world
[59:53] i was out there in the things of the
[59:55] world i was out there in sin i was out
[59:57] there in unbelief and i come to find out
[59:59] there was nothing out there in the world
[1:00:00] that could ever feel that deep inside of
[1:00:02] me there was a deep calling to a deep
[1:00:05] and there was nothing in the world that
[1:00:07] could respond to that deep i could do as
[1:00:09] much drugs as i wanted to drink enough
[1:00:11] alcohol i could sell it i could do it i
[1:00:14] could run this way and that way i could
[1:00:15] make money but nothing would even touch
[1:00:18] that void for the scripture says sin is
[1:00:19] pleasurable for a season oh my but you
[1:00:22] find yourself just used and abused down
[1:00:25] and out with no life in you but there's
[1:00:27] something inside of you that's calling
[1:00:28] out for a god something inside you
[1:00:30] that's calling out for a savior and if
[1:00:32] you'll just humble yourself and call on
[1:00:35] god oh the scripture says if you call on
[1:00:37] the name of the lord you shall be saved
[1:00:39] and i tell you when you experience the
[1:00:41] tender loving hand of almighty god to
[1:00:43] reach down into your situation and to
[1:00:46] lift you up out of the muck and the
[1:00:47] mirror you said you want to know why
[1:00:49] we're rejoicing you want to know why
[1:00:51] we're shouting why because we've
[1:00:53] experienced the saving grace of almighty
[1:00:55] god that's transformed alive that's
[1:00:58] quickened you from dead unbelief to a
[1:01:00] living resurrected savior with a life on
[1:01:03] the inside of you that's being
[1:01:04] victorious
[1:01:05] oh hallelujah you're more than a match
[1:01:08] for the world
[1:01:10] this ain't a dead letter church this is
[1:01:13] a living resurrected savior that's
[1:01:15] living in a bride with the same power
[1:01:17] that he had when he walked the the
[1:01:19] shores of galilee
[1:01:22] the same word the same life living in
[1:01:24] the people
[1:01:25] we have something to rejoice about we
[1:01:27] have something to shout about
[1:01:29] and i'm thankful for it
[1:01:31] but as maybe what's on my heart i'm
[1:01:33] trying to move
[1:01:34] maybe in a direction for seeing the
[1:01:37] unfolding of the word into our lives and
[1:01:39] into our day and the prophet of god
[1:01:41] would say this in paragraph 84.
[1:01:45] he would say how many remembers about
[1:01:46] the squirrels
[1:01:48] all right
[1:01:50] listen to the words of the prophet here
[1:01:53] he said that was a puzzling scripture
[1:01:56] in my life
[1:01:58] i never could understand that
[1:02:00] it would just go on we'll see what he's
[1:02:01] referring to
[1:02:03] he says and there was another one that
[1:02:04] puzzled me that was when moses could
[1:02:07] tell god a better way than god knowed
[1:02:09] how to do anything when moses said the
[1:02:12] people will say your god was able to
[1:02:13] bring you out but not able to keep you
[1:02:16] and moses threw himself into the breach
[1:02:19] then later
[1:02:20] i found out that moses that was christ
[1:02:23] in moses standing for the people you
[1:02:26] know i marvel that i i love the prophet
[1:02:29] how humble he was
[1:02:30] later i found out i feel like many times
[1:02:33] bribe members can't find out anything
[1:02:36] oh we do we just know it all somebody
[1:02:38] comes and shares a quote that became
[1:02:39] real to me oh yeah yeah uh-huh yeah that
[1:02:41] one where he said this you know he also
[1:02:43] says it over there yeah uh-huh yeah i
[1:02:45] got that i'm like a google search query
[1:02:47] anything you can say i can do better
[1:02:50] you know it's like we can't humble
[1:02:51] ourselves you know i love that quote
[1:02:53] that's so awesome
[1:02:55] that's wonderful tell me more
[1:02:57] but here the prophet is saying he's like
[1:02:59] look later i found out see why because
[1:03:01] the word it's not that he didn't know
[1:03:03] the word not that he had not seen the
[1:03:04] manifestation of the word but there's a
[1:03:06] greater unfolding now something that's
[1:03:09] coming into manifestation or a
[1:03:10] revelation that's breaking to the
[1:03:12] prophet and he says later i found out
[1:03:15] that was moses that was christ and moses
[1:03:17] standing for the people see so then on
[1:03:19] this scripture now watch this watch what
[1:03:22] the prophet says he says that i i never
[1:03:25] would preach on it if you say to this
[1:03:27] mountain be moved
[1:03:29] and you know the story so i'll bypass
[1:03:31] that now little did i know
[1:03:34] what that was leading to
[1:03:36] so now the prophet is identifying
[1:03:38] scriptures just like even one we said
[1:03:41] right
[1:03:42] we read in john 14 says verily 14 verse
[1:03:45] 12 says verily i say in you he that
[1:03:47] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:03:49] shall he do also
[1:03:52] greater works than these shall he do
[1:03:53] because i go unto the father now the
[1:03:55] prophet is going to pick up this
[1:03:56] scripture and he will preach on the
[1:03:58] scripture and give an understanding of
[1:04:01] it but then later in the message this
[1:04:03] this this letter this word that's lame
[1:04:07] in the scripture is actually gonna come
[1:04:09] into greater revelation and greater
[1:04:12] unfolding because now it's time it's the
[1:04:15] time and season that the revelation or
[1:04:17] the the further unfolding of this
[1:04:20] scripture is made or revealed to the
[1:04:22] bride
[1:04:25] because it would always be like well
[1:04:26] it's more it's you know it's a greater
[1:04:28] you know greater how could you do
[1:04:30] greater and he would explain show that
[1:04:32] well that's more because now it's in the
[1:04:34] bride it's more but he actually would
[1:04:36] come later now and actually provide a
[1:04:38] further revelation
[1:04:40] of what this word manifested in a people
[1:04:43] after the opening of the word now you
[1:04:45] say brother brother matthew what do you
[1:04:47] mean after the opening of the word
[1:04:49] well hold on here yes i know the third
[1:04:51] pull was in manifestation before the
[1:04:53] breaking and opening of the seals but
[1:04:56] the third pull before 1963 was a mystery
[1:05:00] you see so now god being a prepared god
[1:05:03] prepared a vessel
[1:05:05] named william branham and now god would
[1:05:07] come and veil himself in that form god
[1:05:10] and morphing now taking on flesh in a
[1:05:13] man but yet he was veiled oh hallelujah
[1:05:16] he was veiled there in that first pool
[1:05:18] he was veiled there in that second pool
[1:05:21] but then he's gonna come on down as this
[1:05:23] third pull starts breaking and he'll
[1:05:25] preach the unveiling of god in 1964 and
[1:05:27] he says i intend to unveil that god to
[1:05:31] you
[1:05:31] why because the god that was there all
[1:05:33] the time
[1:05:34] come on somebody the god that was there
[1:05:37] all the time but he was veiled is now
[1:05:40] going to unveil himself to a people but
[1:05:43] the unveiling is for a purpose that he
[1:05:45] might unveil himself to the bride of
[1:05:47] jesus christ and there would be a union
[1:05:50] there would be a united that now that
[1:05:52] word that was being unveiled would come
[1:05:55] into a unity into a people and now that
[1:05:58] third pool revelation would take on
[1:06:00] flesh in the bride
[1:06:02] oh glory to god i'm so glad that i'm a
[1:06:05] part of that
[1:06:07] oh my just look at this and how it
[1:06:09] continues he continues to to speak here
[1:06:13] i just need god's help we had no
[1:06:15] preparation here so we'll just see how
[1:06:16] god
[1:06:17] would speak to us tonight
[1:06:20] but we know that the son of man ministry
[1:06:22] is the word taking on flesh amen it's
[1:06:24] the word becoming flesh that's what the
[1:06:26] son of man ministry is
[1:06:28] and so the prophet of god he starts to
[1:06:30] go through and speak about
[1:06:33] uh the third pull manifestation
[1:06:36] you know he'd speak about the first time
[1:06:37] i believe it was little fishy i give you
[1:06:39] your life back
[1:06:41] right so you see now that the first time
[1:06:44] that we see the the third pull
[1:06:49] it actually brings forth resurrection
[1:06:53] and the second time he starts to talk
[1:06:54] about the squirrels and the second time
[1:06:57] the third pool was in manifestation what
[1:06:59] was it it was creation
[1:07:01] so then now we see what we see what
[1:07:03] actually the third pool is doing and i
[1:07:06] want to move towards a portion here and
[1:07:08] look away to jesus where the prophet of
[1:07:10] god is actually going to say i think
[1:07:12] it's paragraph 181 along them lines he
[1:07:15] would say now there's no more doubt in
[1:07:17] my mind
[1:07:18] i now know what the third pull is and
[1:07:21] what it does and something in my heart i
[1:07:24] pray is if god would bring the prophet
[1:07:27] the uh if i could say it this way a
[1:07:29] shape wave one that was a first one to
[1:07:32] maturity that he could come to the
[1:07:34] revelation where he could stand there
[1:07:36] before the people and say now there's no
[1:07:39] more doubt in my mind why would the
[1:07:41] prophet say that because there was
[1:07:43] something in him there was a pondering
[1:07:45] there was a wandering not an unbelief
[1:07:48] but there was this something inside of
[1:07:50] him a wanting to understand or grasp and
[1:07:53] that while he'd even be preaching the
[1:07:55] sixth seal i believe it was and souls
[1:07:57] that are in prison he would be saying is
[1:07:59] it too late i mean the third pool of
[1:08:00] jesus's ministry was preaching uh to
[1:08:03] souls that are in prison and we're now
[1:08:05] we're now entering into the third pool
[1:08:07] and he had this question he say is it
[1:08:09] too late it might be he's like i hope
[1:08:11] not because i have family out there so
[1:08:13] there was this unfolding as the word was
[1:08:15] breaking forth and he would come into
[1:08:17] preaching uh uh souls that are in prison
[1:08:20] and he would move on down and then now
[1:08:22] as he's preaching this look away to
[1:08:24] jesus and oh my in that morning service
[1:08:26] he had preached there is a man here that
[1:08:28] could turn on the light oh you couple
[1:08:30] those two uh services together my oh
[1:08:33] what a rejoicing what a rejoicing that
[1:08:36] there was a man that come in our day
[1:08:38] that could turn on the light oh without
[1:08:40] that light without the manifestation of
[1:08:43] that why we're all lost we're all doomed
[1:08:46] there's no way to believe because
[1:08:47] there's no light to shine upon the seed
[1:08:50] and quicken you
[1:08:52] oh my just like it was in the very
[1:08:54] beginning when god created the heavens
[1:08:56] and the earth what did he do he said let
[1:08:58] there be let there be and he put seed
[1:09:01] there in the earth but they're in that
[1:09:03] darkness they're in that void they're in
[1:09:05] that confusion that seed lay dormant
[1:09:08] it laid there dead
[1:09:11] until god said let there be light
[1:09:14] and that's exactly what happened in our
[1:09:17] day god said let there be light
[1:09:22] and in the midst of all the darkness and
[1:09:24] lady will seal god brought his word that
[1:09:28] was laying dormant in scripture and he
[1:09:30] called a man on the seed and he came and
[1:09:33] veiled himself in that man and he broke
[1:09:35] the seventh seal mystery which was the
[1:09:38] light which was jesus christ shining
[1:09:41] upon that predestinated seed and
[1:09:43] quickening you to life oh without that
[1:09:46] word thank god for the revelation of the
[1:09:49] son of man because that was the light
[1:09:52] that had to shine in the end time let
[1:09:55] there be light
[1:09:57] oh thank god for his word thank god for
[1:10:00] his revelation thank god for the message
[1:10:02] because without this message i am dead
[1:10:06] oh my but thank god
[1:10:10] oh thank god he didn't leave me down
[1:10:12] there in the age of horse and buggy
[1:10:15] thank god he didn't leave me down there
[1:10:16] in the age of man
[1:10:18] thank god he didn't leave me there
[1:10:20] in a little airplane
[1:10:22] bumping around with little nip downs and
[1:10:24] touchdowns but he said oh now we have
[1:10:27] actually come into the age of astronauts
[1:10:29] we have risen down from the earthly we
[1:10:31] have planned going into the heavenly and
[1:10:33] we're actually soaring right by mars
[1:10:35] going goodbye mars i'm going to be with
[1:10:38] my lord i'm going to be with my savior
[1:10:40] for eternity oh what a resurrection that
[1:10:43] was but what a resurrection this is to
[1:10:46] be quick and from undead belief in his
[1:10:48] word and to be made alive in jesus
[1:10:49] christ i'm thankful for the message
[1:10:52] hallelujah
[1:10:54] praise god praise his wonderful name
[1:10:58] oh my
[1:11:00] so just
[1:11:02] the prophet would go on and say the
[1:11:04] third time it happened was hattie wright
[1:11:06] so the first time
[1:11:07] brought resurrection
[1:11:09] second time brought creation third time
[1:11:12] he says the third time the third pool
[1:11:14] ever came in a manifestation on mortal
[1:11:17] man
[1:11:19] and what did it produce
[1:11:21] it produced salvation
[1:11:24] so now we're starting to catch
[1:11:25] hallelujah we're actually starting to
[1:11:28] catch the manifestations of the third
[1:11:30] pull because the prophet later on is
[1:11:33] going to say i now know what the third
[1:11:35] pull is
[1:11:37] and i know what it does and now we can
[1:11:40] look into the message of the prophet now
[1:11:42] is taking the time to walk us through
[1:11:44] the manifestations of the third pool in
[1:11:47] his life and we're actually seeing
[1:11:50] resurrection
[1:11:51] we're seeing creation we're actually
[1:11:54] seeing salvation
[1:11:58] now i want you to think about this for a
[1:12:00] second
[1:12:02] the prophet of god is now sharing
[1:12:05] a manifestation
[1:12:07] of the third pool
[1:12:10] and hattie wright
[1:12:12] says the right thing
[1:12:15] she says that's nothing but the truth
[1:12:20] she said the right thing to the word
[1:12:23] now i want to bring out something about
[1:12:25] the power
[1:12:27] of the third pool
[1:12:29] and now for you to start actually taking
[1:12:32] advantage of the benefits
[1:12:34] and the effect that in the age that
[1:12:38] we're living with in where the book has
[1:12:40] become a new book because actually watch
[1:12:43] the work
[1:12:45] oh hallelujah this is powerful now watch
[1:12:47] the work or the manifestation that the
[1:12:50] third paul had when she said the right
[1:12:52] thing of the word the lord spoke to
[1:12:55] brother brandon the prophet and said
[1:12:57] give her what she asked for
[1:13:02] now she under the third pool revelation
[1:13:06] was actually able to speak salvation for
[1:13:09] her family
[1:13:11] oh if that don't make a mommy or a daddy
[1:13:13] start to shout if that don't make you
[1:13:15] want to start rejoicing to know that
[1:13:18] what god has done in loosing the seven
[1:13:20] seals and actually sent you his very own
[1:13:23] zoning life doing tabernacle himself in
[1:13:25] a believer and under the revelation of
[1:13:27] that third pull and the effects it can
[1:13:29] have on your life that you can actually
[1:13:31] stand there and speak salvation for your
[1:13:34] family no i have not lost my mind i
[1:13:37] believe the message and i can see the
[1:13:40] revelation of those seven seals and the
[1:13:42] opening of the word of the effect that
[1:13:44] it had on an individual and believed
[1:13:46] that if it had that same effect oh come
[1:13:49] on now he's the same yesterday today and
[1:13:51] forever and if he did it that way one
[1:13:53] time he'll do it that way again that if
[1:13:55] you say the right thing to this word and
[1:13:57] say that's nothing but the truth there
[1:13:59] is a power there is a manifestation that
[1:14:02] has been bestowed upon the pride of
[1:14:04] jesus christ that you are the final
[1:14:06] voice
[1:14:07] you are the final voice
[1:14:10] to the final age it's going to be
[1:14:12] through your lips that you speak the
[1:14:14] word
[1:14:15] now we're moving into a maturity we're
[1:14:17] moving towards a step in the scripture
[1:14:19] of further unfolding
[1:14:22] the prophet is showing the further
[1:14:24] unfolding or manifestation of these
[1:14:26] scriptures in our day
[1:14:29] taking it off the pages now
[1:14:33] the third time it happened was hattie
[1:14:34] wright
[1:14:36] is had he right here tonight how many
[1:14:38] knows had it right
[1:14:40] brother woods and i were sitting there
[1:14:42] when it happened
[1:14:43] and when the holy spirit said
[1:14:45] give her what she wants
[1:14:48] now friends if you miss it
[1:14:51] if you miss what's actually happening
[1:14:53] right now
[1:14:54] is written word
[1:14:58] written word lame in the scripture
[1:15:01] actually becoming flesh
[1:15:04] we're actually seeing the word made
[1:15:07] flesh
[1:15:08] yeah it's written a different way
[1:15:11] it has a different accent
[1:15:14] trust me the way you were this in
[1:15:15] english wasn't the way it was written
[1:15:17] and i had a different accent but praise
[1:15:19] god it had the same life and the same
[1:15:23] yes manifestations so now watch this
[1:15:24] unfolding
[1:15:27] give her what she wants
[1:15:30] now what does my bible say
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:36] all right so now we're actually seeing
[1:15:38] the word
[1:15:40] being made flesh not something we look
[1:15:42] back in the past and just say i believe
[1:15:44] it but now i want this word
[1:15:48] to be made flesh in my life
[1:15:51] whatsoever things that you ask we're
[1:15:54] actually seeing now the word made flesh
[1:15:57] in a prophet bring the written word into
[1:16:00] a reality for a believer who said amen
[1:16:03] to the word
[1:16:05] oh hallelujah what did we hear our
[1:16:07] pastor preached this morning it's all
[1:16:09] about faith and faith is a gift look you
[1:16:11] couldn't even believe if god didn't give
[1:16:13] you the gift of faith and god doesn't
[1:16:15] give bad gifts
[1:16:17] oh hallelujah he gave you the gift of
[1:16:19] faith that can believe every single word
[1:16:21] of god
[1:16:23] oh my if you can believe it you can have
[1:16:25] it
[1:16:28] oh what shall we say to these if you can
[1:16:30] believe it
[1:16:31] why start thinking big
[1:16:34] i'm reminded of the scripture in the
[1:16:36] bible when the prophet told him strike
[1:16:38] the ground with the arrows
[1:16:40] and he said all right well praise god i
[1:16:41] strike the ground i think you struck the
[1:16:43] ground three times the prophet said what
[1:16:44] are you doing
[1:16:45] why did you only strike the ground three
[1:16:47] times he said because you only struck
[1:16:49] the ground three times then you're gonna
[1:16:51] have to keep putting up with your enemy
[1:16:53] oh bride don't just strike the ground
[1:16:55] three times just start striking the
[1:16:57] ground just start speaking the word
[1:16:59] start claiming your family claim your
[1:17:01] neighbors claim your co-workers i don't
[1:17:04] care start striking the ground start
[1:17:06] speaking start believing start doing
[1:17:08] something because that's why god placed
[1:17:11] you here
[1:17:12] he placed you here to take the word and
[1:17:14] make it live
[1:17:25] watch this unfolding here
[1:17:27] give her what she wants well just go
[1:17:30] ahead and put yourself there
[1:17:33] quit selling yourself short
[1:17:37] the whole bible was written for you
[1:17:42] jesus christ went to calvary for you
[1:17:45] god sent a prophet for you
[1:17:49] god built a church in bedford texas for
[1:17:51] you
[1:17:54] god had a sunday night service on
[1:17:55] october 10th
[1:17:58] for you
[1:18:00] now when we start putting ourself in the
[1:18:02] word
[1:18:03] you talk about demons not knowing what
[1:18:05] to do with you
[1:18:07] when you actually what did what did
[1:18:09] that's exactly what jesus christ did the
[1:18:11] prophet of god said that jesus actually
[1:18:13] hung everything on the words of a
[1:18:15] backslidden prophet
[1:18:18] that david said i will not suffer my
[1:18:20] holy one to see corruption
[1:18:23] the prophet of god said he hung all of
[1:18:25] that on that one prophecy that he knew
[1:18:28] that if he went down in the grave
[1:18:30] because god had spoke that through a
[1:18:32] prophet that he would not leave as well
[1:18:35] leave his word void
[1:18:37] but that he would actually manifest that
[1:18:39] so now what are we doing we place
[1:18:40] ourself in the word we're living by the
[1:18:43] word we're walking in the word because
[1:18:44] what the word is constantly moving
[1:18:47] the opening of the word the third pull
[1:18:49] manifestation revelation is continually
[1:18:52] unfolding in your life
[1:18:54] don't sell god short don't sell yourself
[1:18:56] short don't sell the word short god got
[1:18:59] big plans for your life
[1:19:02] i mean you're the very a culmination
[1:19:05] hallelujah you're the bride that god
[1:19:08] foresaw in the end time that he would
[1:19:10] want to use your vessel
[1:19:13] to bring forth the same death is
[1:19:15] swallowed up in victory
[1:19:18] that in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:19:20] eye i shall be changed or to think that
[1:19:23] god placed me here in the end time that
[1:19:26] i could be living in the age of the
[1:19:28] rapture
[1:19:29] god has called you out of a lady you see
[1:19:31] a condition he's called you into a pride
[1:19:34] age he's called you into a rapture age
[1:19:36] now the prophet said we can't beat our
[1:19:38] type and who is our type our type is
[1:19:41] enoch well get to walking bride just get
[1:19:44] to walking just get to walking in the
[1:19:46] way one day one day one by one just keep
[1:19:50] on walking and one of these days
[1:19:53] oh my you're gonna be changed in a
[1:19:55] moment in a twinkling of an eye you're
[1:19:57] going to be gone
[1:19:59] why because that's the word
[1:20:02] that was spoken concerning the pride in
[1:20:04] the end time
[1:20:05] so much so you can't miss it he said you
[1:20:08] are predestinated not to miss it
[1:20:12] you can't fail
[1:20:14] you are predestinated not to fail so
[1:20:18] let's get our eyes off of the worry
[1:20:20] let's get our eyes off the unbelief and
[1:20:23] start walking in the revealed word of
[1:20:25] the hour with an expectation of the
[1:20:28] third pull manifestation in our life
[1:20:31] that's what you're putting here for
[1:20:34] you want to know what hattie wright was
[1:20:36] put on the earth
[1:20:38] to manifest the word
[1:20:40] right
[1:20:41] now watch this
[1:20:46] he says and brother woods and i was
[1:20:48] sitting there
[1:20:50] when it happened
[1:20:51] and the wooden hole the holy spirit said
[1:20:54] give her
[1:20:55] what she wants
[1:20:57] oh hallelujah like i said put yourself
[1:20:58] there now god's talking to somebody
[1:21:02] give her what she wants you've been
[1:21:04] praying for something
[1:21:06] the word is still sharper than any touch
[1:21:08] of sword it's still a discerner of the
[1:21:10] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:21:12] god is still speaking he's speaking to
[1:21:14] the bride give her what she wants
[1:21:19] oh no no no more unbelief
[1:21:22] those things are dead to the believer
[1:21:25] there's only one thing and that's his
[1:21:27] word and his word alone and here the
[1:21:29] bible is saying i'm just i'm just
[1:21:31] reading the bible another way
[1:21:34] give her what you okay if that's too
[1:21:36] hard for let's let i'm sorry
[1:21:39] you can't receive it from a vindicated
[1:21:41] prophet
[1:21:43] i'm sorry let's go back to the letter
[1:21:49] because the manifestation of the word in
[1:21:51] our day
[1:21:53] people are blind to it
[1:21:56] just like when the word was made flesh
[1:21:59] in front of the sadducees and pharisees
[1:22:01] they couldn't see the words standing in
[1:22:04] front of them
[1:22:05] so what does god do in the seventh
[1:22:07] church age by divine promise he says
[1:22:09] behold i send you elijah he says as it
[1:22:12] was in the days of noah so shall it be
[1:22:15] in the days of the revealing of the son
[1:22:17] of man and what do we have revelations
[1:22:20] 10 1-7 manifested in this day and age
[1:22:23] standing in front of the people
[1:22:24] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:22:26] the heart showing the messiah sign but
[1:22:28] yet they couldn't recognize the word
[1:22:30] that was being made flesh standing
[1:22:32] before him because they were not elected
[1:22:34] to see that word but when the elected
[1:22:37] soul that word made flesh something
[1:22:39] inside of them said the right thing just
[1:22:42] like hattie wright they said that's
[1:22:44] nothing but the truth i can't understand
[1:22:47] it so because god has placed that
[1:22:50] predestinated sight on the inside of you
[1:22:53] and you have responded to the word and
[1:22:55] said i believe it that's nothing but the
[1:22:58] truth the word is saying back to you
[1:23:00] give her what she wants
[1:23:04] oh
[1:23:05] hallelujah i'm reminded of the scripture
[1:23:07] when esther mordecai came to esther and
[1:23:09] said esther maybe it was for such a time
[1:23:12] as this that you have come to the
[1:23:13] kingdom
[1:23:15] maybe it was such a time as this that
[1:23:16] you have been predestinated and elected
[1:23:19] to live in the darkest age that has ever
[1:23:20] struck the face of earth maybe it's at
[1:23:23] such a time as this that you are here
[1:23:26] and now what did esther do she actually
[1:23:28] barged into the king's court
[1:23:31] and came up to the king it was death to
[1:23:33] go in there
[1:23:35] but she was elected
[1:23:37] she was chosen
[1:23:38] just like the priest that would go
[1:23:40] behind the veil
[1:23:42] they were elected they were chosen they
[1:23:44] were dressed right they were anointed to
[1:23:47] go into the presence of god oh
[1:23:49] hallelujah
[1:23:50] you have been anointed to be in the

[1:25:18] scripture
[1:25:20] and let it become a reality in your life
[1:25:22] oh heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:25:24] god's word will never pass away

[1:25:31] how them squirrels come into existence
[1:25:36] and i said
[1:25:39] is the only thing it is
[1:25:41] he is jehovah jireh
[1:25:44] just now watch this this is beautiful
[1:25:47] just when abraham needed a ram
[1:25:50] god provided that ram
[1:25:53] he provided the squirrels
[1:25:55] he can speak a squirrel just into
[1:25:57] existence
[1:25:58] because he
[1:26:00] is creator
[1:26:02] just the same as he could speak the ram
[1:26:05] watch this now
[1:26:07] abraham
[1:26:09] never asked for it
[1:26:14] he was just simply going on to do it
[1:26:20] now catch that
[1:26:22] if we're obedient to god's word
[1:26:26] if you're just being obedient to god's
[1:26:28] word and you're walking in the
[1:26:30] revelation that he's given to you
[1:26:33] when you come to a place where you have
[1:26:35] a need
[1:26:38] he said he was just simply going on to
[1:26:40] do it but it showed
[1:26:43] that jehovah jireh was there now what
[1:26:46] that speaks to me
[1:26:48] is if you will just walk in the word
[1:26:51] and be obedient to that word that means
[1:26:53] you're walking with jehovah jireh
[1:26:57] abraham was walking with jehovah jireh
[1:27:01] the god that gave him the promise look
[1:27:04] he had received a son from the dead
[1:27:07] so he knew the same god that gave him
[1:27:09] that son was able to raise that son up
[1:27:12] again look the same god that quickened
[1:27:14] you from undead belief the same god that
[1:27:16] called you elected you predestinated you
[1:27:18] that filled you with the holy ghost if
[1:27:20] he could rescue you from the pits of
[1:27:22] hell if he could rescue you from sin if
[1:27:25] he could deliver you from bondage then
[1:27:27] what need do you have tonight what is it
[1:27:29] that you have need of you are walking
[1:27:32] with jehovah jireh
[1:27:34] you are walking with jehovah jireh if
[1:27:38] you'll just be obedient if you'll just
[1:27:40] be faithful keep walking with the word
[1:27:43] and if you have need of something
[1:27:46] jehovah jireh is there to speak that
[1:27:50] need into existence
[1:27:53] give her what she wants
[1:27:57] oh
[1:27:58] hallelujah
[1:28:00] well i said that
[1:28:02] a humble little woman
[1:28:05] for the first time this ever happened
[1:28:07] the third pull upon a human being
[1:28:10] was a little humble woman
[1:28:14] now maybe we should just stop a moment
[1:28:15] here
[1:28:20] the third time
[1:28:23] the third pull
[1:28:24] ever came into manifestation on a mortal
[1:28:26] being it came into manifestation
[1:28:31] on a little puffed up prideful
[1:28:34] church that thinks they're the bomb and
[1:28:36] they can't fail or make it and they are
[1:28:39] just it and nobody else can measure up
[1:28:41] to them and we are just it we're going
[1:28:43] in a body change look at me i recognize
[1:28:46] malachi 4 5. do you see my nice suit do
[1:28:49] you see my nice house look at all the
[1:28:52] good that god has done for me oh we get
[1:28:54] results we scream and shout we got them
[1:28:57] out pentecostals
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:02] bigger churches
[1:29:05] more well let's just preach the word i
[1:29:07] ain't saying nothing the prophet didn't
[1:29:09] say
[1:29:11] and god god has blessed us god has
[1:29:12] blessed us with nice homes and nice cars
[1:29:15] god has blessed us with a nice church
[1:29:17] but we're not we're not talking about
[1:29:19] the blessings we're talking about the
[1:29:20] attitude behind the blessings
[1:29:22] we're talking about the
[1:29:24] self-vindication that comes over people
[1:29:27] and they think oh look at all the things
[1:29:28] i got we get results don't we no that's
[1:29:32] not our vindication our vindication is
[1:29:34] the word and that god put a faith seed
[1:29:37] on inside of us that when we heard the
[1:29:39] word we believe the word and the
[1:29:41] evidence of the holy ghost in your life
[1:29:43] is that you say amen to the word
[1:29:48] now we can preach on that for a little
[1:29:49] while
[1:29:50] we could preach about that in the works
[1:29:52] in your life and how you dress and how
[1:29:54] you act and all those things anyway we
[1:29:56] could really start getting cutting a
[1:29:57] little bit but we'll just keep moving on
[1:30:01] upon a human being was a little
[1:30:04] humble woman
[1:30:08] a little humble woman
[1:30:11] i say there needs to be some humility in
[1:30:13] the church
[1:30:16] so now the prophet of god is walking
[1:30:19] well praise god
[1:30:22] i don't know if i should quit preaching
[1:30:24] or quit keep going i don't even know if
[1:30:26] i've said anything yet
[1:30:33] the third the third the third pull up on
[1:30:35] a human being was a little humble woman
[1:30:37] just making about 200 a year for her
[1:30:39] living all she got out of that little
[1:30:41] farm her husband dead two children had
[1:30:43] turned kind of wild and come and donate
[1:30:45] 20 of that to the building of this
[1:30:47] tabernacle
[1:30:48] amita had given me some money that
[1:30:50] morning for groceries 20
[1:30:52] and i was going to give it back to her
[1:30:53] that day
[1:30:54] and when i was down there so that she
[1:30:56] wouldn't have to pay it but she wouldn't
[1:30:58] take it
[1:31:02] go get god his first church
[1:31:06] maybe you wonder why things are hard and
[1:31:07] you're you're not making ends meet
[1:31:11] try god it's one of the things in the
[1:31:12] scripture he says try me
[1:31:14] give god his first
[1:31:16] there's a story about a widow woman in
[1:31:18] the bible
[1:31:19] she was going to make a cake and die
[1:31:22] but the prophet came and said as the
[1:31:24] lord live it give me a cake first and
[1:31:26] then the curse of oil will never run dry
[1:31:29] and you know what she did she said okay
[1:31:32] i'm going to give to you first
[1:31:34] and god blessed her for that
[1:31:36] there's blessings in honoring the word
[1:31:38] of god
[1:31:41] yes sir
[1:31:43] she was just sitting back in the corner
[1:31:45] when i said only thing i know
[1:31:47] is he is still jehovah gyra and little
[1:31:49] hattie wright said the right word she
[1:31:51] said that's nothing but the truth and
[1:31:53] when she said that brother banks woods
[1:31:55] here was the one that was present the
[1:31:57] room felt like it was coming apart and
[1:31:59] the holy spirit said the same voice that
[1:32:02] spoke about them squirrel said give her
[1:32:04] what she asked for
[1:32:06] now is that not the same identification
[1:32:09] in the word that said verily i say unto
[1:32:11] you he that believeth on me
[1:32:13] hallelujah he that believeth on me the
[1:32:16] works that i shall do he shall do also
[1:32:18] and greater works than me shall you do
[1:32:20] because i go unto the father and
[1:32:22] whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that
[1:32:24] will i do that the father may be
[1:32:26] glorified in the son if you ask anything
[1:32:29] in my name i will do it i love how the
[1:32:31] prophet goes on to tell the story he
[1:32:33] goes on to say well she's like what
[1:32:35] should i ask for
[1:32:37] see she didn't even know
[1:32:38] what she was going to ask for
[1:32:40] just like that widow woman who thought
[1:32:43] she was going to bake two cakes and die
[1:32:45] didn't know that god had already spoke
[1:32:47] to a prophet and said i have commanded a
[1:32:50] widow woman to sustain thee god had
[1:32:53] committed or commanded a widow woman
[1:32:56] just to sustain the prophet
[1:32:59] and she didn't even know it just how god
[1:33:02] sent elijah to preach to preach the
[1:33:04] message and little did you know that god
[1:33:07] had predestinated a bride to sustain the
[1:33:10] message and actually make it live when
[1:33:12] the prophet had gone off the scene
[1:33:14] you were predestinated to receive the
[1:33:16] message
[1:33:19] you were predestinated to receive it and
[1:33:21] make this word live
[1:33:22] hallelujah
[1:33:24] heidi wright didn't even know what she
[1:33:26] was going to ask for but guess who did
[1:33:30] god knew her heart
[1:33:33] god knew what she would ask for why
[1:33:36] who was it in hattie wright
[1:33:41] it was that
[1:33:42] predestinated seed
[1:33:44] it was god in hattie right that said
[1:33:47] amen to the word and it's god in you
[1:33:51] that is saying amen to the word and when
[1:33:54] you wonder in your heart what you should
[1:33:56] ask for when you really get alone and
[1:33:58] get into his presence and he comes down
[1:34:01] and you really start to have fellowship
[1:34:02] oh you start to speak things like our
[1:34:04] lord and say not my will lord but vine
[1:34:08] will be done and you find yourself in a
[1:34:10] presence in an estate that where all
[1:34:12] things are possible and as the holy
[1:34:14] ghost would move upon your heart you can
[1:34:16] ask for the things that are according to
[1:34:18] his word and you shall have what you ask
[1:34:21] for because it's god in you asking for
[1:34:24] his very word
[1:34:26] oh hallelujah
[1:34:29] praise god
[1:34:32] now we're seeing
[1:34:34] the scriptures that are written now
[1:34:35] coming to life
[1:34:37] and the prophet of god would go on to
[1:34:38] tell how she spoke the word and there
[1:34:41] those two kids that were snickering and
[1:34:43] acting up pitched themselves over and
[1:34:45] they gave gave their heart to the lord
[1:34:47] what was it it was the third
[1:34:49] manifestation of the third pull
[1:34:51] bringing forth resurrection
[1:34:53] bringing forth creation now bringing
[1:34:56] forth salvation and as we continue to
[1:34:58] move forward i don't know exactly maybe
[1:35:01] where our target is but we just maybe
[1:35:03] keep moving here so now we keep going on
[1:35:06] and we know that fourth manifestation i
[1:35:07] believe was when he spoke to the storm
[1:35:11] so now the fourth manifestation of the
[1:35:13] third pool what is it we're seeing
[1:35:14] dominion
[1:35:17] now we're saying all these things to
[1:35:20] show what the opening of the word is to
[1:35:22] produce in the believer's life
[1:35:27] i want to move a little further because
[1:35:29] the scripture says
[1:35:31] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:35:33] word
[1:35:34] but then the prophet then would pick up
[1:35:36] john 5 24 and say he that heareth my
[1:35:39] words and he would actually identify
[1:35:41] that word and say it's not necessarily
[1:35:43] hearing but he who understands my word
[1:35:47] so then there has to be a revelation
[1:35:50] that comes with the word that you're
[1:35:51] hearing it's not enough just to say amen
[1:35:54] to the word and not have no fruits in
[1:35:56] your life but if it's a true seed that's
[1:35:59] saying amen to the word it is quickened
[1:36:01] and it now starts to bear the fruits of
[1:36:03] the word so he that heareth my word he
[1:36:06] that understandeth my word he who
[1:36:10] catches the revelation that is being
[1:36:12] revealed to the elected seed of this day
[1:36:15] and age is he who hears my word my sheep
[1:36:19] hear my voice and another one they will
[1:36:22] not follow so now as the word is
[1:36:25] breaking forth to the believer and the
[1:36:28] word is constantly moving in your life
[1:36:31] it's now starting to bring forth the
[1:36:33] manifestation and the fruits of the word
[1:36:36] and we see what that third pool is
[1:36:38] actually producing in the believer's
[1:36:40] life it's producing resurrection
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:45] it gives power of creation
[1:36:48] it brings salvation
[1:36:51] restoring dominion back into the hands
[1:36:54] of man again
[1:36:57] all that adam had lost
[1:37:00] oh hallelujah the lamb has now descended
[1:37:02] with the open book for redemption claims
[1:37:05] not to keep the book to himself
[1:37:08] but to give the book back
[1:37:11] what did he do he gave it to the seventh
[1:37:13] angel
[1:37:16] but that wasn't the last place it was
[1:37:18] supposed to stay
[1:37:22] but he told john go take the book
[1:37:26] now you can't beat your type bride
[1:37:28] john's apart john the type of the bride
[1:37:32] so we've recognized the open book in the
[1:37:35] hand of the seventh angel
[1:37:37] but have you gone and taken the book
[1:37:42] you believe that's a step in the right
[1:37:45] direction you have recognized the
[1:37:47] revelation and the opening of the word
[1:37:49] but now what he's wanting to do he's
[1:37:51] telling you take the book
[1:37:53] eat it up
[1:37:54] thou must prophesy again now we're
[1:37:58] seeing the third pull in manifestation
[1:38:02] in the bride
[1:38:05] oh hallelujah let it be
[1:38:08] and there was
[1:38:10] speaking squirrels into existence
[1:38:14] a first one coming to maturity showing
[1:38:17] what all of the wheat seed in the field
[1:38:20] that were going to come into that same
[1:38:22] maturity
[1:38:24] now i'm just foolish enough to believe
[1:38:26] it
[1:38:28] i believe god has called me
[1:38:30] ordained me
[1:38:32] to receive that open book to eat it up
[1:38:36] to prophesy again and to see the third
[1:38:39] pull with the same manifestations in my
[1:38:41] life
[1:38:43] but like our prophet said i don't have
[1:38:45] to work it up i don't have to try to
[1:38:47] manifest it i don't have to try to look
[1:38:50] at that little chandelier you know you
[1:38:51] read the you you read the story about
[1:38:53] the prophet he tells what was her name
[1:38:55] uh she says you believe he goes all
[1:38:57] right move that little chandelier little
[1:38:59] uh cord hanging back and forth
[1:39:02] jordy carter yeah georgie carter he says
[1:39:04] oh you say you believe george all right
[1:39:06] we'll make that little
[1:39:08] little string there hanging down from
[1:39:09] the fan make it move back and forth well
[1:39:11] brother branham that's spiritualism no
[1:39:13] it's not i thought you said you believe
[1:39:16] well i don't know about you but i've
[1:39:17] been sitting in my room on my bed
[1:39:19] looking at that little thing
[1:39:26] oh my
[1:39:28] i couldn't do it after one year serving
[1:39:30] god i couldn't do it after five years of
[1:39:33] serving god and i probably couldn't do
[1:39:34] it today you want to know why
[1:39:36] i don't need to make that thing move
[1:39:40] that's right all i need is the
[1:39:42] revelation
[1:39:45] all i need to know is that the mighty
[1:39:47] god
[1:39:48] has been unveiled to me
[1:39:52] the mighty god has been unveiled to me
[1:39:55] the seventh seal book has been opened to
[1:39:58] me
[1:39:59] the seven seals have been revealed seven
[1:40:02] thunders have uttered their voices and
[1:40:04] you have heard
[1:40:06] them and it's those seven thunders that
[1:40:10] have awakened the bride that's why
[1:40:12] you're living in revival that's why
[1:40:14] you're living the way that you're living
[1:40:17] oh praise god for his word well i don't
[1:40:20] know where to stop
[1:40:22] oh hallelujah
[1:40:26] fourth fourth time the third pool came
[1:40:27] in the manifestation
[1:40:30] it spoke to the storm
[1:40:34] now we're going to see that now now i
[1:40:36] believe
[1:40:37] the prophet well we we know this was all
[1:40:41] a predestinated word
[1:40:43] and he's breaking down these
[1:40:45] manifestations to show you what the word
[1:40:47] will produce in your life
[1:40:52] don't leave it in history
[1:40:54] these are just manifestations we saw in
[1:40:57] the prophet's life a bride member who
[1:41:00] came to maturity first
[1:41:03] but we saw that manifestation in our
[1:41:06] lord and savior jesus christ
[1:41:08] who was the first one who had rose from
[1:41:11] the dead he was the first fruit of the
[1:41:14] resurrection and the scripture says if
[1:41:16] that same spirit
[1:41:18] that was in jesus christ dwell in you it
[1:41:21] shall quicken your mortal body that's
[1:41:24] exactly what this word is doing it's
[1:41:27] quickening your mortal body to bring you
[1:41:30] into a place where all of the word that
[1:41:32] was spoken of the bride will be
[1:41:34] manifested in your life
[1:41:37] oh praise god
[1:41:39] don't let don't let it fall to the
[1:41:41] wayside
[1:41:42] what a glorious hour that we are living
[1:41:45] in
[1:41:46] now ye are
[1:41:48] the sons of god
[1:41:50] the whole world is groaning and
[1:41:53] travailing for the manifestations of the
[1:41:56] sons of god and they are gathered
[1:41:59] together right here in christian life
[1:42:02] tabernacle on a sunday evening oh glory
[1:42:05] to god hallelujah there is a word that
[1:42:08] is bringing a bride into the fullness of
[1:42:11] the manifestation that the word has
[1:42:12] spoken oh you might as well just get
[1:42:15] excited
[1:42:18] nothing can hold you down nothing can
[1:42:20] keep you
[1:42:22] you might go into the grave but nothing
[1:42:24] can keep you in the ground
[1:42:25] just as sure as jesus christ came out of
[1:42:27] the ground there is a bride coming out
[1:42:30] of that ground through seven church ages
[1:42:33] and there will be a people
[1:42:35] who will not hinder them that are asleep
[1:42:38] but you'll be changed
[1:42:40] hallelujah
[1:42:42] you might as well just start expecting
[1:42:45] just looking around the corner
[1:42:47] say charity is that you
[1:42:50] jonathan is that you
[1:42:51] i got loved ones i want to see
[1:42:54] i got loved ones i miss i got loved ones
[1:42:57] who are behind the curtain of time and i
[1:42:59] have an expectation in my heart
[1:43:03] where are they at
[1:43:05] any day now
[1:43:07] any day now
[1:43:09] which one's gonna appear to me first
[1:43:11] there ought to be such an expectation
[1:43:14] oh my if we only knew who where we were
[1:43:16] standing
[1:43:17] if we could get a revelation of the two
[1:43:18] spirits within the framework of the
[1:43:20] church
[1:43:21] we actually catch the revelation that's
[1:43:23] been unveiled in this day you are an
[1:43:25] invincible army church
[1:43:27] those aren't flattery words that's a
[1:43:29] revelation
[1:43:31] hallelujah
[1:43:32] just moving on a little further
[1:43:34] if that's all right
[1:43:37] so we see the manifestations of the
[1:43:38] third pool the fourth time speaking of
[1:43:41] the storm and the fifth time
[1:43:43] watch what the prophet would say here
[1:43:47] he would say about that fifth time the
[1:43:50] the lord come come to the prophet and he
[1:43:53] said
[1:43:54] the the the way that you say it just the
[1:43:57] way that you say it
[1:44:00] will be the way it happens
[1:44:03] so we see the fourth time
[1:44:05] then we see the fifth time
[1:44:07] and i marveled
[1:44:08] i marveled at that
[1:44:10] he says
[1:44:18] he says what was it
[1:44:20] just exactly according to the word of
[1:44:23] the lord now now catch something that's
[1:44:25] taken place every time the prophet
[1:44:28] speaks about the third pool he never is
[1:44:31] taking credit for his earthly vessel
[1:44:34] he never even says i spoke it
[1:44:37] he says he spoke it because why it was
[1:44:40] god in the man
[1:44:43] that's what the son of man ministry is
[1:44:46] it's the word becoming flesh
[1:44:49] god in morphe
[1:44:51] the word becoming tangible
[1:44:54] now it's it's moving in a direction for
[1:44:57] you to understand that he's pointing out
[1:44:59] that it was god in him that spoke it now
[1:45:02] when we hear the scriptures we've heard
[1:45:03] it so many times we've actually applied
[1:45:06] it like it's an intellectual knowledge
[1:45:08] when the scripture says that greater is
[1:45:11] he that is in you
[1:45:13] then he that is in the world then there
[1:45:16] is a manifestation or a reality that
[1:45:20] jesus christ is living in you and the
[1:45:23] prophet would take up that scripture and
[1:45:25] say at that day ye shall know that i am
[1:45:28] in the father the father and me and i in
[1:45:30] you and he would take that and say when
[1:45:33] the revelation comes forth when the
[1:45:35] revelation is revealed then it's me and
[1:45:38] you and i and you it's him in the bride
[1:45:42] it's god in morphing now living in a
[1:45:45] mini-membered bride body
[1:45:48] we're not looking for a corporal potty
[1:45:52] god is living in the bride body
[1:45:56] the prophet of god said in the trial he
[1:45:58] said i challenge you to believe that the
[1:46:01] manifestation of the son of man ministry
[1:46:04] is now in the bride's body
[1:46:06] he was challenged you to believe that
[1:46:09] now god was becoming flesh in his
[1:46:12] mini-member body
[1:46:14] but we want to keep putting god back in
[1:46:17] history we want to keep putting god back
[1:46:19] in the prophet but god is wanting to
[1:46:22] unveil himself to the bride that to know
[1:46:25] that this third pool revelation is
[1:46:27] actually his own life living in you
[1:46:31] it's not you speaking
[1:46:34] it's him in you speaking the word
[1:46:38] glory to god let's stand
[1:46:45] i didn't say we were done but
[1:46:48] just to change your position
[1:46:51] so we move a little further right so
[1:46:53] watch this
[1:46:55] he says
[1:46:56] what is it
[1:46:58] just exactly according to the word of
[1:47:00] the lord
[1:47:02] amen
[1:47:03] now he he's saying exactly according to
[1:47:06] the word that he spoke
[1:47:09] brother branham said
[1:47:12] before the doctor's hand
[1:47:14] touches her the tumor would be gone
[1:47:17] now watch the prophet under the
[1:47:19] anointing now
[1:47:22] just exactly according to the word of
[1:47:25] the lord
[1:47:26] now if we could catch the revelation
[1:47:29] that is being produced here
[1:47:31] it's not you that liveth
[1:47:34] it's christ that liveth in you
[1:47:37] greater is he that is in you
[1:47:40] than he that is in the world it wasn't
[1:47:42] brother branham speaking it it was the
[1:47:45] god in brother branham speaking the word
[1:47:50] amen just exactly according to the word
[1:47:52] of the lord amen that's the fifth time
[1:47:55] five is the number of grace
[1:47:58] and the number of faith two
[1:48:01] there is no more doubt in my mind thank
[1:48:05] you
[1:48:06] i now i know what the third pull is
[1:48:11] and i know
[1:48:12] what it does
[1:48:17] i now know what the third pull is
[1:48:20] and what it does
[1:48:21] and i believe that's where we are
[1:48:24] what what maybe
[1:48:26] if we're moving towards a point
[1:48:29] we want to see the word
[1:48:32] coming into a revelation or an unfolding
[1:48:35] in our life where we can say like the
[1:48:37] prophet
[1:48:39] where we can say i now know what the
[1:48:41] third pull is
[1:48:42] and what it and what it does
[1:48:46] now
[1:48:46] this is a deep thing
[1:48:49] god hides himself in simplicity
[1:48:52] praise god
[1:48:54] praise god
[1:48:56] god hides himself in simplicity and
[1:48:58] reveals himself in the same
[1:49:01] so it's not some big way off wonder
[1:49:04] be faithful to the calling in your life
[1:49:08] keep walking like abraham was walking
[1:49:12] in obedience to the word and if you're
[1:49:14] walking in obedience to the word jehovah
[1:49:17] jireh is with you
[1:49:19] and when you come up to a need or you
[1:49:21] come up to a trial
[1:49:23] jesus is with you to meet you in that
[1:49:26] trial and in that time of need
[1:49:28] we don't have to manufacture something
[1:49:30] we don't have to work up something we
[1:49:32] don't have to run out on the internet to
[1:49:34] this preacher run out on the internet to
[1:49:36] that preacher explain to me the seventh
[1:49:38] seal explain to me the mysteries oh my i
[1:49:41] gotta get this thing and put this
[1:49:42] together and i gotta call this brother i
[1:49:44] gotta figure out what is the third pool
[1:49:46] all about what is the son of man what
[1:49:47] was the land what was the sea what was
[1:49:50] that me what where is it if i can just
[1:49:52] figure this all out i'll finally get the
[1:49:55] rev no
[1:49:58] no
[1:50:00] no god elected you
[1:50:03] just say the right thing to the word
[1:50:08] howdy wright didn't have any
[1:50:09] preconceived notion
[1:50:12] she wasn't sitting around like
[1:50:13] well when i finally get the chance
[1:50:17] i'm going to try to give lip service to
[1:50:19] the prophet
[1:50:21] and then and then
[1:50:23] i'm going to ask for my boys no
[1:50:25] she she didn't even know
[1:50:27] the opportunity that was and i say
[1:50:29] church we don't even know
[1:50:31] we can't even comprehend the opportunity
[1:50:34] that god has given us
[1:50:36] but one thing i know i believe it
[1:50:38] i believe this message with all my heart
[1:50:41] i've heard the elies are called
[1:50:43] and i want to go wherever this word
[1:50:44] takes me
[1:50:46] and i can look into the word and now i
[1:50:47] can see
[1:50:49] well i
[1:50:50] wish well praise god we're just where
[1:50:53] we're at
[1:50:54] there's a manifestation
[1:50:57] of this word
[1:50:59] that is coming into bright form
[1:51:01] amen and so we know what the third poll
[1:51:04] is we know the opening of the word was
[1:51:05] revealing christ if you can play
[1:51:06] something that'll help me stop
[1:51:12] we we know that the prophet explains
[1:51:14] these things we
[1:51:15] you know that what were the seals what
[1:51:18] were they they were revealing christ
[1:51:21] christ is those seals that was the ones
[1:51:24] he was revealing
[1:51:25] but see it's one thing to recognize the
[1:51:27] opening of the word it's one thing to
[1:51:28] recognize the mighty angel but what we
[1:51:30] want to do is we want to lay in the
[1:51:32] presence of the sun
[1:51:33] we want to be that seed that's laying in
[1:51:36] the presence of the sun and start to see
[1:51:38] the fruits
[1:51:39] of the opening of the word in our life
[1:51:42] and so when we can look into the
[1:51:44] scriptures and see this mystery of the
[1:51:46] third pool that was actually happening
[1:51:48] where the prophet would come to a place
[1:51:50] and say i now know what the third pool
[1:51:52] is and what it does
[1:51:54] it shows me that okay lord
[1:51:56] i'm i'm moving i'm
[1:51:58] if the word is constantly moving then
[1:52:00] this message that i have received is
[1:52:03] constantly moving me towards a greater
[1:52:06] manifestation of the opening of the word
[1:52:08] in my life
[1:52:10] and i saw the manifestation of it in a
[1:52:12] first one to maturity so that i know
[1:52:15] that that same word
[1:52:17] is now having the same effects and the
[1:52:19] same fruits in my life
[1:52:21] amen let's just pray heavenly father
[1:52:27] lord we love you
[1:52:30] we love your word
[1:52:34] lord i pray something that was was said
[1:52:36] that could just
[1:52:40] move your bride a step higher lord just
[1:52:43] to
[1:52:44] awaken the faith that's in them
[1:52:47] to know that you're living you're alive
[1:52:50] you're living in a people
[1:52:53] lord that
[1:52:54] we recognize the mighty work that you've
[1:52:56] done in the seventh
[1:52:59] angel that
[1:53:00] visited us
[1:53:02] we're thankful so much that we've
[1:53:04] recognized the word that has unfolded
[1:53:06] but lord as we look back and see the
[1:53:08] manifestations of scriptures
[1:53:11] in
[1:53:13] days gone by
[1:53:14] we know that the purpose was is for that
[1:53:16] word to be in manifestation in our life
[1:53:21] so lord we know that we have a great
[1:53:23] responsibility
[1:53:26] to this word and to this message
[1:53:29] but lord we're thankful to know it's not
[1:53:30] something we gotta muster up
[1:53:33] it's not something we gotta manufacture
[1:53:35] but if we'll just lay in the presence of
[1:53:37] the sun
[1:53:38] we'll just walk in obedience to the word
[1:53:41] just like abraham was walking
[1:53:43] he was walking with you
[1:53:46] just like when the prophet stood there
[1:53:48] in the face of the storm
[1:53:52] and it was just the way he said it
[1:53:54] storm you go this way and
[1:53:56] sunshine for four days
[1:54:00] when he was obedient to your word and
[1:54:03] we see the manifestation of what he
[1:54:04] spoke come to pass
[1:54:07] that's when you said to your servant
[1:54:10] will you walk with me
[1:54:12] lord i believe that's all our hearts
[1:54:14] desire
[1:54:16] we just want to walk with you lord
[1:54:20] and i can echo what the prophet said
[1:54:22] he'd be the greatest privilege i've ever
[1:54:23] had
[1:54:26] lord i believe every one of us could say
[1:54:28] this has been the greatest privilege
[1:54:30] we've ever had
[1:54:32] to receive this message
[1:54:35] receive this word lord
[1:54:39] we know the demands of this life
[1:54:42] are heavy and
[1:54:43] it's a dark and wicked age
[1:54:46] lord our heart echoes with the prophet's
[1:54:48] words
[1:54:50] to walk with you lord it's the greatest
[1:54:52] privilege that we've ever had
[1:54:55] lord we just want to be faithful to our
[1:54:56] part
[1:54:59] we love you lord we thank you for your
[1:55:01] word
