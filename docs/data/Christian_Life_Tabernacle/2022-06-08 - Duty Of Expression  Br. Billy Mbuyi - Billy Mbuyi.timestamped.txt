[37:47] certainly
[37:48] happy to be gathered here
[37:50] amen uh
[37:52] let's open our bibles we're going to
[37:54] read a couple of scriptures uh
[37:57] i think two of them we read them last
[37:58] time when we're here
[38:00] um
[38:01] first if a very familiar scripture
[38:04] reading hebrews 13
[38:06] 8
[38:07] jesus christ the same yesterday
[38:10] today and forever
[38:12] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[38:15] and forever
[38:16] and in
[38:17] first john
[38:19] chapter 1 verse 1
[38:21] it says
[38:22] that which was from the beginning
[38:25] which we have heard which we have seen
[38:28] with our eyes
[38:29] that which we have looked upon
[38:31] and our hands have handled it of the
[38:34] word of life
[38:35] for life was manifested and we have seen
[38:38] it and bear witness
[38:40] and show unto you the eternal life which
[38:43] was with the father and was manifested
[38:46] unto us
[38:47] that which we have seen and have heard
[38:50] declare we unto you
[38:52] that ye also may have fellowship with us
[38:55] and truly our fellowship is with the
[38:57] father and with his son jesus christ and
[39:01] these things right we unto you that your
[39:04] joy may be full
[39:06] so our joy comes from the fellowship
[39:08] when we realize we're coming to that
[39:10] same fellowship that we are being
[39:12] invited into it says this is this then
[39:15] is the message which we have heard of
[39:17] him and declared unto you that god is
[39:21] light and in him there's no darkness at
[39:23] all
[39:24] if we say we have fellowship with him
[39:27] and walk in darkness will lie and do not
[39:30] do not the truth
[39:32] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[39:34] the light we have fellowship with one
[39:36] another and the blood of jesus christ
[39:40] the blood of jesus christ his son
[39:42] cleanses us from all sins
[39:45] amen also for uh in john chapter 1
[39:48] verse 1 it says in the beginning was the
[39:51] word and the word was with god and the
[39:53] word was god the same with in the
[39:56] beginning with god all things were made
[39:58] by him and without him was not anything
[40:02] made that was made
[40:04] in him was life and life was the light
[40:07] of man and the light shineth in darkness
[40:10] and darkness comprehended not there was
[40:12] a man sent from god whose name was john
[40:15] the same
[40:16] this he says the the the same came for
[40:20] witness to bear witness of the light
[40:22] that all men through him might believe
[40:25] he was not that light but he was sent to
[40:28] bear witness of the light amen god bless
[40:31] you may have your seats
[40:47] man we'll try not to be too long tonight
[40:57] i read in the bible where it says
[40:59] speaking too much is a sin so i try to
[41:12] it's just one phrase that
[41:15] um
[41:17] really spoke to my heart and i've been
[41:19] meditating on this
[41:21] for for a couple of days and
[41:25] and
[41:26] and i hope it will be a blessing to you
[41:28] and this came from the message that we
[41:31] were listening to things that are to be
[41:34] and
[41:35] runner makes this a statement it's
[41:37] paragraph 32
[41:40] things started to be and he says
[41:43] now the only way that you could be a son
[41:46] and the daughter of god it says because
[41:48] you have you have be you it says you
[41:51] have to be
[41:52] you have to have eternal life there's
[41:54] only one form of eternal life and that's
[41:56] god's life
[41:58] it says only one form of eternal life
[42:00] that was god it says to be a son you
[42:04] have to be with him you have to have
[42:06] been with him always
[42:09] so there's never a time where you left
[42:11] him you always had to be with him
[42:14] and then it says the gene of of your
[42:17] life now he speaks is now saying the
[42:20] spiritual life tonight was in god the
[42:23] father before there was
[42:26] even a molecule if it says and you are
[42:29] nothing but the manifestation of the
[42:32] gene of life that was in god as a son of
[42:35] god amen
[42:37] and i want that to just sink in
[42:39] sometimes we hear those things and we
[42:41] just skip over it i want that to sink in
[42:44] so we were always with him and the gene
[42:47] of life all we are is the manifestation
[42:50] of the gene that was in god it says now
[42:53] you are expressed
[42:55] after the after his word has come to you
[42:58] in you
[42:59] to light up this age
[43:01] you are ex you are expressing god
[43:05] in you are expressing god's life in you
[43:08] because you are a son or a daughter of
[43:10] god therefore
[43:12] it says therefore you get what i mean
[43:15] you can't guess it said man it says you
[43:17] are now made you are now made you are
[43:21] getting in it says you are sitting in
[43:23] the church tonight because
[43:26] your duty
[43:27] is to express god to this nation to this
[43:32] people to this neighbor where you
[43:35] associate
[43:40] and my title tonight is
[43:42] duty of expression amen duty of
[43:46] expression
[43:47] now as we read this and i want this
[43:49] because
[43:50] we the things of god are marvelous and
[43:53] oftentimes when we go it's easy to get
[43:56] lost in the greatness and the goodness
[43:58] and the things that god is speaking to
[44:00] us even the revelation of the word that
[44:03] we have heard in this end time but i i
[44:06] want us even tonight for just few
[44:08] moments like i said i won't be i won't
[44:09] be long but just for a few moments to
[44:12] just come to the realization of this
[44:13] last statement that he made it says you
[44:15] are sitting in this church tonight and
[44:18] we can literally say we are sitting in
[44:20] this church tonight because your duty is
[44:23] to express god to this nation to these
[44:27] people to this neighborhood where you
[44:30] associate so yeah you you you have to
[44:33] constantly be reminded that our
[44:36] existence is not this mortal life that
[44:38] we know our existence as we have it
[44:41] within the natural is not this earthly
[44:44] bound person who has to get a job who
[44:47] has to do this who has to do that but it
[44:49] says that our duty is to express god
[44:53] it says so so we we we have to
[44:55] understand that we are here to express
[44:57] something
[44:59] our lives is an
[45:00] expression of something
[45:02] regardless of whether we understand it
[45:04] whether we know or we don't know every
[45:07] day when we woke up in the morning from
[45:09] the time we woke up till we go to bed we
[45:11] are expressing different things when we
[45:14] go to work the way we interact with
[45:16] people the way we talk the way we
[45:17] conduct our business it's an expression
[45:20] that's going forth everything about us
[45:22] it's an expression the way we we conduct
[45:25] ourselves on the daily basis is an
[45:26] expression and our duty on earth is now
[45:29] being brought here in the he says is to
[45:32] manifest god firstly and that's our
[45:35] problem if we ever had a goal in life if
[45:37] we ever had a motive if we ever have
[45:40] something that would that's supposed to
[45:42] drive us that's supposed to excite us
[45:44] that we can walk up in the morning and
[45:46] find out that i have a family yes i have
[45:49] children i i have a job i have
[45:50] responsibility but what's my primary
[45:53] goal as i'm sitting as i just walking up
[45:55] and taking the breath of life within my
[45:58] lungs what is it that i'm supposed to do
[46:00] is saying is to express god
[46:05] to express god to our family to our
[46:07] neighbors to our coworkers to people
[46:10] around us to to have that's our primary
[46:13] duties as christians now we
[46:16] why is that important because you
[46:17] realize i was thinking about you you
[46:19] look at the elements of the world around
[46:21] us
[46:22] everything that we see happening the
[46:24] seasons and the times that we are living
[46:26] in it's only built for you to express
[46:29] frustration
[46:30] it's built for you to express
[46:35] some type of
[46:36] people giving up and it's constantly
[46:39] frustrations you don't know what's going
[46:41] to happen tomorrow we look at its
[46:43] disappointment it's lost of hope and
[46:46] people losing the children all kinds of
[46:49] chaos it's not an environment that's set
[46:52] for someone to walk up in the morning
[46:53] and be happy and go out and and just be
[46:56] happy and come back everyone everyone
[46:59] has a concern
[47:01] people are looking and what's going to
[47:02] happen tomorrow whether it be christian
[47:05] or non-christian it didn't matter they
[47:07] go out there and and it's it's constant
[47:09] frustrations and and the way the system
[47:12] is built my goodness it's made uh every
[47:16] dollar you make it's try to be taken out
[47:18] in every manner you know you pay the
[47:20] bills the bills never comes the same
[47:22] today it's more tomorrow it's more and
[47:25] it keeps going up and and there's no
[47:28] loyalty a person who's been
[47:30] subscribed to to some companies for
[47:33] years and years and every year they'll
[47:34] go up and you have to change and go
[47:36] somewhere so it's never built for you to
[47:39] have a peace of mind and say oh it's so
[47:41] wonderful it's built to have this
[47:44] frustration a constant frustration a
[47:47] constant disappointment and people don't
[47:49] know they can't trust politician they
[47:51] can't trust the economy they can't trust
[47:53] all of that but it's in that condition
[47:56] that god is putting you here as we read
[47:59] for you to manifest the expression of
[48:02] god
[48:03] and that expression is if i can sum it
[48:06] up even perhaps this being the summary
[48:08] of the whole thing i want to talk about
[48:10] is for so that the world out there
[48:12] they'll know that they they're not stuck
[48:15] in the condition that they're in that
[48:17] there is another option that exists and
[48:19] god is here to do that amen
[48:22] yes sir
[48:25] a person can have could have gone to a
[48:27] doctor and gotten the worst report that
[48:29] the reason a person didn't win and they
[48:32] lost their job and and then constant
[48:34] disappointment and and meeting the needs
[48:37] and and don't know where they're gonna
[48:38] get the next meal and but when they come
[48:41] in contact with you you have to remember
[48:44] your job is not to share the frustration
[48:47] your journey your job is not to to
[48:49] include or to sympathize within the
[48:52] frustration but after all is said and
[48:54] done your job is to let that person know
[48:57] that this is not the end of you that
[48:59] there is a living god and is here i am
[49:02] his ex his expression i'm here to
[49:05] express to you that this is not the end
[49:07] of you
[49:10] amen and if we can have that every day
[49:13] that we work up in the morning every
[49:15] time certain tries to rattles us if we
[49:18] can come back to the place and come back
[49:20] and realize listen i'm not here to
[49:23] multiply the frustration
[49:25] i'm not here to perpetrate the
[49:27] frustration i'm not here to take my
[49:29] frustration and give it to another my
[49:31] job is when the frustration comes that i
[49:34] can reach back and know that i am the
[49:36] expression of god to this generation
[49:41] yes sir amen but speaks about uh the age
[49:44] being such a neurotic age it says it
[49:48] talks about how a doctor needs another
[49:50] doctor
[49:54] and and and this one needs to go and see
[49:57] the psychiatrist needs another
[49:58] psychiatrist that he could talk to you
[50:01] you know i was thinking about it you
[50:02] know you i i grew up in the time that i
[50:05] grew up uh you know in the 70s
[50:09] towards the end
[50:10] you you know you you come you grow up
[50:12] and they tell you education is very
[50:14] important you need to be educated you
[50:17] need to go to school you need to do this
[50:19] and you need to do that now we live in a
[50:21] time where people that are in
[50:23] entertainment people that are playing
[50:26] sports and all those things people that
[50:28] are not in the education they make more
[50:31] money than a than a doctor who can
[50:33] perform a a brain surgery
[50:38] everything is upside down it don't make
[50:40] no sense anymore but it's in that time
[50:43] that we have to be very aware of what is
[50:46] it that i'm called to express what as
[50:49] i'm here during this condition what is
[50:52] it what is my purpose of being here is
[50:54] that i'm here to express god in this
[50:57] multitude of things that are going on
[51:00] yes sir what madam says in the message
[51:04] it says here in the message
[51:09] identification the uh identification he
[51:12] speaks it says
[51:14] then see
[51:16] god came down
[51:18] and the character of god was in christ
[51:21] it says and he he was he was the
[51:24] reflection
[51:26] he was god
[51:28] made
[51:29] visible
[51:33] notice god made visible
[51:37] it says in the beginning was god it
[51:39] wasn't even god then but god in he says
[51:43] in an object of worship the only thing
[51:46] that was it was eternal in him was
[51:49] attribute and the attributes were the
[51:51] thoughts and the thoughts were were
[51:53] expressed in the word the word was made
[51:56] flesh it says what is it it says
[52:00] it's all
[52:01] god
[52:02] becoming tangible
[52:06] and you are part of god
[52:10] and jesus came to redeem
[52:12] those that was put that was that was put
[52:16] on the lamb's book of life before the
[52:18] foundation of the world he was in god's
[52:21] thought and that's what he came to
[52:23] redeem
[52:25] and then as soon as he strikes them
[52:28] it strikes it strikes to them they see
[52:30] it because the life is in there
[52:33] it says but if the life is in it isn't
[52:36] there then what can they do he says see
[52:40] they don't see it they will never see it
[52:42] and the whole thing as jesus says
[52:45] all day it says you'll know that i mean
[52:48] god that i mean the father and the
[52:50] father in me and i in you and the whole
[52:53] thing is god becoming material like a
[52:57] husband and a wife becoming one together
[52:59] and god and his church is becoming one
[53:02] now it's very important because i was
[53:04] thinking about this i said yeah we are
[53:06] we sit here and you know we we hear
[53:09] those things it's god becoming material
[53:11] it's god becoming material and
[53:13] oftentimes i expression when we say
[53:16] we're here as the bride of christ to
[53:18] express god all we think about is oh to
[53:21] come to a place where i need to create
[53:23] the squirrel or i need to do something
[53:25] marvelous i need to touch somebody and
[53:27] they get healed instantly then i'll know
[53:29] that i'm the expression of god no that
[53:32] could be the ultimate expression that
[53:34] could be where we are going into but as
[53:37] for as far as it begins there has to be
[53:40] someone playing that role from the
[53:42] beginning he was faithful in little
[53:44] could be faithful in much there has to
[53:46] be the expression that starts to show
[53:49] out of you in order for you to grow to
[53:51] that level
[53:53] that's right amen
[53:56] now we we as we read yeah you see the
[54:00] the scripture says in the beginning was
[54:02] the word and the word was with god how
[54:04] is it going to happen the same word that
[54:07] created the heavens and the earth the
[54:09] same word that came and and the
[54:12] scripture says he was there the same
[54:14] word that abides in the prophet and he
[54:16] expressed himself through the prophet
[54:18] why because it was the promised word and
[54:21] that same word that came to mary and
[54:23] when that word came to mary that same
[54:26] word brought the expression of jesus
[54:27] christ when that same word comes in you
[54:30] it's supposed to bring the same
[54:32] expression of the same god
[54:35] not a different god of the same god and
[54:38] how is he going to do it he's going to
[54:40] do it the same way he did it in mary
[54:42] because he says the word is in the bride
[54:45] as it was in mary
[54:47] yes sir
[54:48] amen so therefore uh we we it says we
[54:53] are now made we are sitting in church
[54:56] tonight because our duty is to express
[55:00] god to this nation is to express god to
[55:03] this people to the to to our
[55:05] neighborhood and to our associate so the
[55:08] purpose of life the duty that we have is
[55:11] the duty of expression and the
[55:14] expression of who not the expression of
[55:16] ourselves but the expression of the
[55:18] living god
[55:24] but one of them says in the message sir
[55:28] we would see jesus
[55:30] he says
[55:34] all these attributes
[55:36] all things
[55:38] all these things are attributes of god
[55:43] it says
[55:44] the bible says
[55:47] it says you will know that as i am in my
[55:49] father
[55:51] and my father in me and i in you and you
[55:53] in me
[55:55] it's god
[55:56] becoming tangible he says again
[56:00] it says
[56:01] your own life
[56:03] you and your husband
[56:06] your your so your own your
[56:08] i says you you own your own wife you and
[56:11] your husband
[56:13] it says is a shadow or a negative of god
[56:16] and his wife
[56:17] the church
[56:19] it's just the app it's just god's
[56:21] attributes being displayed in shadows
[56:23] and type like the old testament and the
[56:26] new
[56:27] then
[56:28] in the end it will all wind up
[56:32] god tangible
[56:34] god in christ tangible made flesh
[56:37] dwelling among us
[56:39] in the great millennium to come
[56:42] god in the form of christ
[56:44] sits up upon the throne of david
[56:47] and the church
[56:48] his bride
[56:50] husband and wife together
[56:52] why
[56:53] it says
[56:54] it says it's it's enough to set our
[56:57] heart
[56:58] the heart of a believer on fire
[57:01] if the it says in this great hour that
[57:04] we are living in
[57:06] when we hope when the hope of all the
[57:08] nations and everything else is crumbling
[57:11] on us under us
[57:13] we've got a kingdom
[57:15] we are baptized in this kingdom
[57:18] so now a year he is he's he's bringing
[57:22] it back to us to to come to the place
[57:25] where we realize
[57:26] it says as god was as my as my father
[57:30] was in me and i in my father says so
[57:33] will i be in you was in me and i in my
[57:37] father says so will i be in you and you
[57:40] and me
[57:41] is bringing to show you that it's the
[57:43] same manifestation that's going to
[57:45] continue
[57:46] so god's intention was not for him to be
[57:49] manifested in christ but yet when it
[57:52] comes to the manifestation of the end
[57:54] time it becomes differently but here is
[57:56] saying he's saying it's the same
[57:58] expression it's going to come to pass
[58:01] the same way that he did when he was
[58:03] manifested in christ in other words it
[58:06] was a word of promise
[58:08] the scripture says that isaiah stood up
[58:10] and says a virgin shall conceive and
[58:14] that word travels for thousands of years
[58:16] and and yet he came and he anchored into
[58:19] the womb of mary and mary the angel came
[58:23] and visited her and spoke to her the
[58:25] word and he says you shall conceive that
[58:28] which was promised was going to come to
[58:29] pass she wondered perhaps as we're
[58:32] wondering tonight how will that come to
[58:34] pass it says don't worry the angels will
[58:38] the holy spirit will overshadow you and
[58:41] that which will come from you will be
[58:43] from on eye but you shall bear a son and
[58:46] her response to the word was let it be
[58:49] unto me according to thy word and
[58:51] through that word or through her belief
[58:55] in the word of god the expression came
[58:57] forth
[59:00] she all she did was to believe and
[59:02] receive the word which came to her where
[59:06] that was spoken to ever an angel and she
[59:09] took the word within her she believed
[59:11] the world she professed the word she
[59:13] confessed that she had heard from an
[59:15] angel she confessed that she was going
[59:17] to receive a child without knowing a man
[59:20] she confessed and she went and in fact
[59:23] she spoke and the child john who was an
[59:25] elizabeth womb who was never who
[59:29] was not breathing who was not alive when
[59:31] the first name of jesus was pronounced
[59:34] he came back to life
[59:38] it wasn't mary's doing mary believed and
[59:41] the promise came to pass and the same
[59:44] god is here saying he's telling us he's
[59:46] saying that the same way that i was in
[59:48] god and i was manifested the same way
[59:51] that i was in god and guarding me it
[59:54] says the same word i will be in you i
[59:57] will come for that same manifestation at
[59:59] the end time and you shall be an
[1:00:02] expression of even me
[1:00:07] how am i going to express it it's by the
[1:00:09] promised word of the end time that it
[1:00:11] said that he will come the manifestation
[1:00:14] of the end time he will be him in the
[1:00:17] bright form and by believing that
[1:00:19] manifestation we are allowing him to
[1:00:22] come and be manifested through us
[1:00:25] yes amen
[1:00:28] but if we continue to look at ourselves
[1:00:30] and say how am i going to bring this you
[1:00:32] know how am i going to bring this to
[1:00:34] pass and what do i need to do to bring
[1:00:36] in the breath believe the word
[1:00:39] believe the word walk in the word do
[1:00:42] what the word says continue to believe
[1:00:44] the word and let him perform what he
[1:00:46] promised he will do
[1:00:49] god didn't intend for us to just come
[1:00:51] here and say oh the lord is good and and
[1:00:54] he died for us and he did all that he
[1:00:57] can and go home and say i'm gonna do my
[1:00:59] best to just please him that was never
[1:01:01] god's intention every promise that god
[1:01:04] has ever bring it's always him coming on
[1:01:07] the scene it's always him becoming
[1:01:09] material he says the whole thing is god
[1:01:14] oh if we can understand the expression
[1:01:17] of god didn't stop when he made the
[1:01:19] creation
[1:01:21] that was just the first expression that
[1:01:23] he wanted and when he came in he was
[1:01:25] manifested in the prophet that was not
[1:01:28] the end of the expression when he was
[1:01:30] manifested in christ that was not the
[1:01:32] end of the expression because when he
[1:01:34] was in christ in fact he did it but i i
[1:01:38] have a quote somehow but
[1:01:40] he says that he did it knowing that
[1:01:42] there will be others that are going to
[1:01:44] come behind him
[1:01:46] to fulfill and to perform and to do the
[1:01:48] same thing that he was doing yes sir
[1:01:51] amen why because they were part of the
[1:01:54] word just as he was the word yes sir
[1:01:57] amen
[1:02:02] and i'll say this
[1:02:05] the word
[1:02:07] doesn't need us to vindicate it
[1:02:13] if we are the word
[1:02:15] we don't need somebody to vandicate us
[1:02:17] and tell us you are the word oh yeah you
[1:02:19] know this is why what the word no
[1:02:21] when god is god
[1:02:24] and because he's god he does godly
[1:02:27] things
[1:02:32] because of who he is
[1:02:34] he does what he does
[1:02:36] it's part of his responsibility it's
[1:02:39] part of who he is it's part of his
[1:02:41] makeup and as the children of god we
[1:02:44] don't need somebody we don't need to be
[1:02:47] vindicated we know when we hear the word
[1:02:50] we believe the word and the word out of
[1:02:53] us will be vindicated
[1:02:56] authentication is not something that
[1:02:58] comes from outside to show us all yeah
[1:03:01] this is it this is you no our
[1:03:04] vindication is we have heard the word
[1:03:06] something within our heart believe the
[1:03:09] word and because we believe the word we
[1:03:12] become performers of the word
[1:03:19] now he says here
[1:03:24] he says here he says
[1:03:30] in the message
[1:03:32] what was the holy spirit given for
[1:03:37] he says
[1:03:39] we are
[1:03:40] we are in the day now
[1:03:43] back there
[1:03:44] there was half as smart as today
[1:03:47] they could make atomic bombs and
[1:03:51] and
[1:03:52] uh automobiles and he says they didn't
[1:03:55] they didn't have science or things as we
[1:03:58] are as we have now
[1:04:01] but
[1:04:02] but things of mysterious things
[1:04:04] to try
[1:04:06] to say
[1:04:07] man blowed up blood together by some
[1:04:10] dust and so forth and take the analysis
[1:04:13] and try to prove
[1:04:14] uh to try to prove it to make infidel
[1:04:17] out of people but now we need it it says
[1:04:21] the spirit of god the spirit of god
[1:04:24] raises the standard what is it
[1:04:26] his pouring is pouring his spirit
[1:04:31] then those who are
[1:04:34] resting out yonder in the grave
[1:04:37] out on the altar of on the altar of god
[1:04:41] as the scripture says are crying how
[1:04:44] long o lord how long how much longer
[1:04:47] god is waiting on me and you
[1:04:54] so as we see here we have to be reminded
[1:04:58] that we are the expression
[1:05:00] we are put here to be the expression and
[1:05:03] it's not what god needs to do it's what
[1:05:07] we need to believe in order for us to be
[1:05:09] to to fulfill or to perform or to walk
[1:05:12] in the expression that's been given to
[1:05:14] us
[1:05:15] so it's saying that god is waiting on me
[1:05:18] and you the church is waiting on me and
[1:05:21] you
[1:05:22] adoption time when god can pour into us
[1:05:26] his fullness
[1:05:29] oh i thought we're supposed to only have
[1:05:30] a measure
[1:05:32] so god can pull into us is fullness
[1:05:36] his power
[1:05:37] his resurrection
[1:05:40] then when the church and christ become
[1:05:42] so close together till christ becomes
[1:05:46] visible among us and raise the dead
[1:05:50] and we go into the rapture
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:55] oh my let it pour himself into me let
[1:05:58] him pour himself into us what we need to
[1:06:01] do is to empty of our own thoughts and
[1:06:03] empty of our own ideas let our empty of
[1:06:06] our own thinking often time we we go and
[1:06:09] we we have some millions on how god is
[1:06:12] supposed to perform it well if i do this
[1:06:14] god will perform it if i do that god
[1:06:16] will perform it if i go here god will
[1:06:18] perform it no no let god be his own
[1:06:21] interpreter
[1:06:22] let him take our lives let him walk you
[1:06:25] up in the morning let him tell you where
[1:06:27] to go let him tell you what to touch let
[1:06:30] him tell you who to talk to let him
[1:06:32] bring somebody let you just be ready
[1:06:35] that when he comes that i am the
[1:06:37] expression and i'm supposed to speak out
[1:06:39] amen
[1:06:41] we try to interpret our own lives and we
[1:06:44] try to give meaning to our own lives
[1:06:46] where god is saying you believe the word
[1:06:48] and let me do the interpretation
[1:06:50] amen
[1:06:52] the scripture the prophet tells us that
[1:06:55] god's interpretation god interprets his
[1:06:58] word by bringing it to pass
[1:07:01] in other words when we read this word of
[1:07:03] god god's intention was not just for us
[1:07:05] to read it and say god said so god said
[1:07:08] so no god's intention was for the word
[1:07:11] to be a living word
[1:07:13] a word that can touch somebody a word
[1:07:16] that can talk to a sinner a word that
[1:07:18] can touch a sick body and the body gets
[1:07:20] healed a word that can move a word that
[1:07:23] can talk a word that can act a word that
[1:07:26] can go and perform what the word said it
[1:07:29] would do yes sir
[1:07:32] amen and that word
[1:07:35] this is the written word
[1:07:38] that gives us the framework of what the
[1:07:40] living word is going to do
[1:07:43] this is what's written
[1:07:45] that becomes alive and walk in the midst
[1:07:48] of the people
[1:07:51] yes sir amen
[1:08:02] now i want to say this
[1:08:04] i said i was speaking on
[1:08:06] duty of expression
[1:08:09] now when you
[1:08:11] when you when you
[1:08:13] when you say duty
[1:08:15] the word duty means moral or legal
[1:08:18] obligation
[1:08:19] or responsibility
[1:08:24] to repeat that the word duty
[1:08:26] means moral or legal obligation
[1:08:30] or responsibility
[1:08:32] and to express is the process of making
[1:08:35] something known
[1:08:37] once thoughts of feeling
[1:08:39] it's also
[1:08:40] to convey
[1:08:41] express is to convey a thought or a
[1:08:44] feeling and it's done either in words or
[1:08:47] gesture or conduct
[1:08:52] now i want to now tie the two
[1:08:55] so our duty of expression
[1:08:58] when you when you say the word duty
[1:09:00] moral obligation or responsibility
[1:09:03] you you
[1:09:04] it's directly connected to a position
[1:09:10] i don't miss that
[1:09:12] when you it's it's somebody's duty
[1:09:15] it means there are some responsibility
[1:09:18] some position something that ties them
[1:09:21] to it
[1:09:23] like i'll give an example like for
[1:09:25] instance
[1:09:26] a person who's in the military uh they
[1:09:29] will go and
[1:09:30] they'll go and they'll get trained
[1:09:32] they'll get given uniform
[1:09:34] they get given everything and then they
[1:09:37] go so if they need them for duty they
[1:09:40] were trained they were given what it
[1:09:43] takes for them to perform the job
[1:09:46] therefore when they are called to be to
[1:09:48] express they are only going to express
[1:09:50] the training that they've been given
[1:09:52] they're only going to express everything
[1:09:55] they can only operate within the duty of
[1:09:57] what they're given
[1:10:00] we we can say as parents we have duty to
[1:10:03] our children we have a duty to feed them
[1:10:06] we have a duty to to dress them to take
[1:10:08] care of them why because we have been
[1:10:11] given the power to have children and
[1:10:14] therefore we are giving even also the
[1:10:16] duty to take care of them
[1:10:18] it's like an employer and an employee
[1:10:21] when you when you get hired and you get
[1:10:23] a job
[1:10:24] uh your duties are based on what
[1:10:27] position you were hired for
[1:10:30] in other words they cannot ask you
[1:10:33] something that you were never hired for
[1:10:35] that's not within your equipment they
[1:10:37] cannot ask you to do the job without the
[1:10:40] proper training for that job because if
[1:10:43] you messed up it's not your
[1:10:44] responsibility it's the responsibility
[1:10:47] of the one who hired you
[1:10:49] my brother my sister we've been made
[1:10:51] christians we've been called to be sons
[1:10:54] and daughters of god
[1:10:55] god could not call you a son or a
[1:10:57] daughter without equipping you with what
[1:11:00] you need in order for you to perform
[1:11:02] that job
[1:11:06] so when he says it's your duty to
[1:11:08] express god that means there is a part
[1:11:11] of you that comes from god that means
[1:11:13] there's some ability that god possessed
[1:11:16] that is deposited in you that means
[1:11:18] there's a part that is placing you that
[1:11:21] gives you the ability to carry out what
[1:11:24] responsibility he wants you to carry
[1:11:26] amen hallelujah otherwise he's asking us
[1:11:29] to do the wrong thing
[1:11:31] otherwise we are operating in venture
[1:11:34] otherwise we are doing we are
[1:11:36] impersonating something but oh if he
[1:11:39] called us to be the bride of jesus
[1:11:41] christ that means he has equipped us for
[1:11:44] us to be able to perform the job at hand
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:56] he says
[1:11:57] in christ identify
[1:11:59] christ identified the same in all ages
[1:12:03] it says god like in the beginning
[1:12:07] he was
[1:12:08] he wasn't really god it was just eternal
[1:12:10] god
[1:12:11] our english word means object of worship
[1:12:15] and he's nothing there it was nothing to
[1:12:17] worship him it was self-existing hello
[1:12:19] him he said so there was nothing to
[1:12:22] worship him so he was just an eternal
[1:12:24] god but in him was attributes and
[1:12:28] attributes is a taught
[1:12:30] that just like you are just like you
[1:12:33] have
[1:12:34] uh you have to think of anything before
[1:12:36] you speak it
[1:12:37] then when you speak it it becomes a word
[1:12:42] and then
[1:12:44] he is eternal
[1:12:45] and in in in him
[1:12:48] was it was attribute and he spoke it and
[1:12:51] it was the word and the word is manifest
[1:12:55] and he was the word manifest god
[1:12:59] becoming material
[1:13:03] in in in god's provided way he says look
[1:13:07] i will prove i will prove it to you
[1:13:11] that it's satan when satan met jesus and
[1:13:14] says if thou be the son of god you you
[1:13:16] can do uh you can do this miracle now
[1:13:19] you are a divine healer it says make
[1:13:22] those stones uh bread and i will believe
[1:13:25] you is that right see the fatherhood of
[1:13:28] the spirit is it says took him up to the
[1:13:31] temple
[1:13:32] and now look it's written in the
[1:13:34] scripture here like like the point in
[1:13:37] mark 16 to us today says it's written in
[1:13:40] the scripture here he gave he gives
[1:13:42] angel charges over thee lest at any time
[1:13:46] thou dash thy foot uh their beardy their
[1:13:49] bear up it says jump down off this and
[1:13:52] then when you get to the ground they'll
[1:13:54] bury yourself they'll they will they'll
[1:13:56] bear yourself up
[1:13:59] see he gave him a scripture
[1:14:01] jesus turn around and say
[1:14:03] thou shall not tempt the lord thy god
[1:14:07] that's right is that is that written
[1:14:09] that's right he put the scripture right
[1:14:12] back to him
[1:14:14] god has a provided way if a doctor sure
[1:14:18] if it's it's the doctor do it's your
[1:14:21] duty to go to the doctor it's your duty
[1:14:24] to do whatever he says to you but look
[1:14:27] brother when you when you go to the
[1:14:29] place where the doctor can't help you
[1:14:32] you've got the right to call on god
[1:14:37] oh i tell you when i read that it just
[1:14:39] sparked something on my heart he begins
[1:14:42] to detail what duty of expressions that
[1:14:45] we have as a believer as we go around
[1:14:48] and as we live in this world what what's
[1:14:50] the duty of a believer he says if you
[1:14:53] are sick you have a duty to go to a
[1:14:54] doctor you have to go and see him and
[1:14:57] everything but if that doctor comes back
[1:14:59] and he he's done all that he can for you
[1:15:02] and he can't help you you have a duty to
[1:15:04] go to god
[1:15:06] because remember at the end it's god who
[1:15:09] works through the doctor but if the
[1:15:11] doctor can do it god is obligated he
[1:15:14] says when you when you are dude when you
[1:15:17] stand and you do your duty for god it
[1:15:19] says god has a duty to back you up
[1:15:24] yes sir
[1:15:26] when you stand and believe god and stand
[1:15:29] at your poster duty and say i'm standing
[1:15:32] on the word of god i'm standing here
[1:15:34] because the word taught me to do this it
[1:15:36] says when you stand and you do that if
[1:15:39] it doesn't work it says god is obligated
[1:15:42] to come and back you up
[1:15:47] if the doctor can't help you
[1:15:50] god
[1:15:51] will come and back you up
[1:15:54] he says
[1:16:06] we have a duty
[1:16:10] to win lost souls
[1:16:16] think of it
[1:16:17] i want you to think about this i'm
[1:16:19] talking about god becoming material
[1:16:24] again it's easy for us to see here and
[1:16:27] talk about god's manifestation in christ
[1:16:30] we love to talk about it how that he
[1:16:32] went through the cross and the things
[1:16:34] that he had to do
[1:16:35] but we forget the prophet tells us
[1:16:38] great is the mystery of godliness it was
[1:16:41] god manifested in the flesh like the
[1:16:43] flesh you're sitting in with that
[1:16:44] tonight
[1:16:46] it wasn't a heavenly flesh that never
[1:16:49] felt any pains or anything it's a flesh
[1:16:52] that got hungry
[1:16:54] it's a flesh that felt pain
[1:16:57] it's a flesh that cried
[1:16:59] it's a flesh that got tired it was a
[1:17:02] flesh just like the flesh you have but
[1:17:05] it within it there was god expressing
[1:17:07] himself through that flesh
[1:17:11] and though he was tired all those things
[1:17:14] will happen that flesh will stand up and
[1:17:16] say i have need to go to samaria
[1:17:21] why because it was time for a different
[1:17:23] expression why it was time for god to
[1:17:25] move and go do something that flesh will
[1:17:28] go to the pool of bethesda and see one
[1:17:30] who couldn't throw himself in the water
[1:17:32] and look at him and says take up that
[1:17:34] bed and walk why it was the same flesh
[1:17:37] it was the same flesh that was hungry
[1:17:39] couple hours ago
[1:17:43] therefore we cannot use our humanity as
[1:17:45] an excuse god wants to take your
[1:17:48] humanity he wants to take it and out of
[1:17:51] that humanity manifests the expression
[1:17:54] of
[1:17:55] himself amen
[1:18:00] he is not interested in doing it in a
[1:18:02] heavenly body he wants to do it within
[1:18:05] this body of flesh with his failure with
[1:18:08] all that he contains with his mistakes
[1:18:10] and with all of those things he wants to
[1:18:13] take the flesh and make you realize that
[1:18:15] it's a duty for god to reflect himself
[1:18:17] in this flesh
[1:18:23] he i remember he was talking about a
[1:18:25] story where
[1:18:26] i believe he was in the museum and he
[1:18:28] saw this group of children
[1:18:30] they were going and they had this tour
[1:18:32] guide and and they stopped by
[1:18:35] as i believe it was this skeleton a
[1:18:38] whale and something like that he began
[1:18:39] to show them it says oh look at this
[1:18:41] well it says the bible
[1:18:43] tells some story about
[1:18:45] a person being swallowed up in here and
[1:18:48] look at this it says and then he began
[1:18:50] to measure says how possibly can a human
[1:18:53] be swallowed up by this look at how big
[1:18:56] it is the prophet said i heard it i
[1:18:58] heard it and i couldn't take it
[1:19:00] oh he had he felt he had a duty to let
[1:19:03] that person know you are mistaken you
[1:19:05] don't know what you're talking about he
[1:19:07] came back and he says so i want to let
[1:19:09] you know it wasn't just a fish it was a
[1:19:12] special prepared fish
[1:19:14] a feast that was made to do the job and
[1:19:17] i want to say this we are a fish that's
[1:19:19] meant to do the job
[1:19:22] you said i'm just a human yes you are
[1:19:24] but you are not just a human you are a
[1:19:26] person your upbringing brother what a
[1:19:28] david just said it a moment ago how you
[1:19:31] were born how you were constructed from
[1:19:33] the family that you were born in the
[1:19:35] complexes that you have the fears that
[1:19:38] you have everything about you just like
[1:19:40] it was in christ just like it was in the
[1:19:42] prophet the same god is here manifesting
[1:19:45] himself in you
[1:19:47] yes sir amen you think he wasn't aware
[1:19:50] of the prophet complexes absolutely
[1:19:57] and new jersey said to you
[1:19:59] moses said
[1:20:01] i can speak in the first place
[1:20:04] he said yeah i know
[1:20:07] i'm giving you aaron to go with you
[1:20:14] god wants to use our weaknesses
[1:20:17] for his strengths
[1:20:20] god
[1:20:21] but if you can understand
[1:20:23] there's more god to be revealed than we
[1:20:26] can ever understand within our human
[1:20:28] mind
[1:20:29] it says the whole thing it's god the
[1:20:31] planning is god the execution is god the
[1:20:34] timing is god the words that you speak
[1:20:37] is god everything is god he's just
[1:20:40] looking for willing vessels that are
[1:20:41] gonna stand and say god use me i yes i
[1:20:44] have weaknesses yes i can't speak yes i
[1:20:47] don't even know how to start i don't
[1:20:49] even know what to say he says you not
[1:20:51] worry about it you stand as a vessel and
[1:20:54] i will fill you up
[1:20:57] it's not your own expression it's my
[1:20:59] expression that i'm trying to bring out
[1:21:02] it's my expression at the end time the
[1:21:04] same way i was manifested in christ the
[1:21:07] same way
[1:21:08] we've seen him take the vessel in the
[1:21:10] end time
[1:21:11] and we've seen him fill that vessel so
[1:21:13] much
[1:21:14] that we called him god
[1:21:16] we looked at him and people mistaken and
[1:21:18] says this cannot be a human this is god
[1:21:25] now remember in perfect faith but when
[1:21:28] he speaks about the scroll he's saying
[1:21:30] that god did that to challenge his own
[1:21:32] faith he did it so that he will know
[1:21:35] that there was more that he was able to
[1:21:37] do that is more that god was trying to
[1:21:40] bring out of him it's the same way when
[1:21:42] we see that when we see a man that's so
[1:21:45] give himself in the hand of god until he
[1:21:48] can act and
[1:21:49] and and speak and and see things that
[1:21:52] are far off an act of same manner that
[1:21:54] god will like it's for us to know that
[1:21:57] that's what we are coming into
[1:21:59] yes sir
[1:22:00] it's the chief way of offering
[1:22:03] but the expression cannot come
[1:22:06] unless there's a complete surrender
[1:22:08] unless is a complete
[1:22:10] giving up
[1:22:11] unless there's an awareness
[1:22:14] listen i don't have to partake of the
[1:22:16] things of laodicea
[1:22:18] i'm not here to partake of the pleasures
[1:22:20] of the world i'll say this but when i'm
[1:22:22] says jesus had the right to marry
[1:22:26] he had a right to have children
[1:22:29] he had a right to have a good time
[1:22:32] he had a right to do everything that
[1:22:33] you're doing
[1:22:34] he had a right as a human to all those
[1:22:37] things but oh my he understood that he
[1:22:40] had an expression to bring forth
[1:22:42] therefore he surrendered himself into
[1:22:44] the hands of god he said father let it
[1:22:46] not be my will but let it be your will
[1:22:49] so the father came and filled up that
[1:22:51] vessel
[1:22:52] so he can come and bring forth and why
[1:22:54] did he do it why is it so important we
[1:22:57] can see the humanity of jesus christ
[1:22:59] it's because god wanted to see for us to
[1:23:02] see that he's operating the same way
[1:23:04] with you and i
[1:23:07] am yes sir
[1:23:11] he says
[1:23:13] and i tell you brothers
[1:23:16] when i feel
[1:23:18] when i feel that resurrecting
[1:23:20] transformation power of the lord jesus
[1:23:22] christ
[1:23:23] circling through a human body
[1:23:26] it says that gives that perfect
[1:23:28] assurance
[1:23:29] it says there's more joy in that in five
[1:23:32] minutes than there is in the whole world
[1:23:35] pressure
[1:23:36] it says that could have that the whole
[1:23:38] wide world pressure that could ever be
[1:23:40] given
[1:23:41] that resurrection power
[1:23:43] it says well the night a sinner comes to
[1:23:45] the altar
[1:23:47] she was sitting back there and crying
[1:23:49] too and i said look
[1:23:51] i said now look says
[1:23:53] you see you see you see where's where my
[1:23:57] joy is i said i'm happier right now than
[1:24:00] all the things that could that that you
[1:24:02] could give me in the world
[1:24:04] the world and all its power would never
[1:24:07] take the place of this
[1:24:10] see you say see souls coming
[1:24:13] there's something in there say what is
[1:24:16] it there's there is there's none of you
[1:24:19] it says that's that's none of your
[1:24:21] business oh yes yes it is too it says
[1:24:25] it's the business of every man and woman
[1:24:28] that's born of the spirit of god to see
[1:24:31] christians coming into the kingdom amen
[1:24:37] it's your duty
[1:24:39] it's your business
[1:24:43] what a joy it is when that happens over
[1:24:49] everything that god uses he brings into
[1:24:52] the mid into the kingdom he brings it as
[1:24:55] part of the restoration plan as part of
[1:24:58] the redemption plan
[1:24:59] it says it's it's it's her duty he
[1:25:02] speaks as a believer it's our duty to
[1:25:05] pray
[1:25:09] when we hear that somebody's psycho when
[1:25:11] we hear something is happening we hear
[1:25:14] this is needed this is needed we can't
[1:25:16] just come in here and say oh you know
[1:25:19] what we already prayed about it over the
[1:25:21] altar somebody went and prayed and i'll
[1:25:23] go home it's none of my business no it's
[1:25:25] your duty to pray
[1:25:28] it's your duty to pray i i was reading a
[1:25:31] story where random speaks about it says
[1:25:33] a woman she was praying she was fasting
[1:25:36] and praying
[1:25:38] in order to cast out some devils and
[1:25:40] everything and she said i prayed and i
[1:25:42] prayed and i fasted and i came and i
[1:25:44] prayed and to try to cast the devils he
[1:25:47] said they wouldn't go away
[1:25:49] but one of them said it says
[1:25:51] it's your duty to fast
[1:25:53] but it says and pray but it's it says
[1:25:56] but as you do that the holy ghost will
[1:25:59] move upon somebody else to go and cast
[1:26:01] those demons
[1:26:05] i said oh my
[1:26:07] we here we are we want god to move
[1:26:10] we want god to move among us we want to
[1:26:12] see the expression it's our duty to
[1:26:15] express god to one another
[1:26:19] but one of them says it's the duty of a
[1:26:21] believer every time the church door
[1:26:23] opens for him to be there
[1:26:28] but how are we going to get to the
[1:26:29] greater expression when we keep missing
[1:26:32] this step-by-step expression that's
[1:26:35] actually building up to something
[1:26:37] what if you were needed for something to
[1:26:39] happen what if your presence was what
[1:26:42] was needed in order for something to
[1:26:44] move forward what was your contribution
[1:26:47] what if it was your contribution that
[1:26:49] was needed in order to bring it right
[1:26:51] where it was needed right good brother
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:56] we we have a duty i'm a christian i'm
[1:26:59] i'm i'm called to live right i'm i'm
[1:27:02] called to do right i'm i'm i'm constant
[1:27:05] i'm called to think right i'm caused to
[1:27:07] do i'm called to do those things why
[1:27:09] because it's part of the expression
[1:27:13] it's part of the expression it's those
[1:27:16] expressions that leads to the fullness
[1:27:18] being put into the body yes sir
[1:27:24] therefore when we come we have to be
[1:27:26] under the expression but it says the
[1:27:28] church will come to where where sin is
[1:27:30] called in where a sinner comes in
[1:27:32] sin is called right in at the door is it
[1:27:35] our expression is it our expectation to
[1:27:38] come to the fullness where those things
[1:27:40] are being manifested
[1:27:43] they said god i want to play my part
[1:27:46] what is my duty as a christian what is
[1:27:49] my duty to my brother what is my duty to
[1:27:51] my sister what is my duty to the body
[1:27:54] what am i what is my contribution what
[1:27:56] is my responsibility what is my part to
[1:27:59] play because only when those things are
[1:28:01] happening that's when the body is fitted
[1:28:04] and joined
[1:28:05] each one supplying the need of the other
[1:28:08] yes sir who's that that's christ in his
[1:28:11] fullness in his body
[1:28:15] i tell you
[1:28:17] i remember a time where
[1:28:19] you know not even long ago you know you
[1:28:22] sit there and your body is sicken
[1:28:25] and you hardly can say a prayer you
[1:28:28] hardly can say much you hardly have the
[1:28:30] strength to even pray or say much
[1:28:33] oh i tell you it's such a comforting to
[1:28:36] just know or to just have hands laid on
[1:28:39] you
[1:28:42] it's not the people's hands it's
[1:28:43] christ's hands
[1:28:46] when a person goes with doubt and and
[1:28:49] then you just hear a knock at the door
[1:28:50] somebody brings food or somebody brings
[1:28:52] you some food or something to eat it's
[1:28:54] christ's expression
[1:28:59] when when when the need is somewhere and
[1:29:01] and you put it within your heart i'm
[1:29:03] going to do what i can in order for me
[1:29:06] for me to fulfill that need if there's a
[1:29:08] need somewhere god i want you to place a
[1:29:10] burden on my heart so i can go and take
[1:29:12] care of it what is it it's the
[1:29:14] manifestation of the same god
[1:29:19] oh my part of my sister we are called to
[1:29:22] be an invincible army the scripture says
[1:29:24] what random tells us that it says when
[1:29:27] she realizes who she is what is the
[1:29:29] realization who she is in knowing what
[1:29:33] duty she has what responsibility she has
[1:29:36] what's been given to her for her to
[1:29:38] fulfill all of those things when she
[1:29:40] realizes those things and she begins to
[1:29:42] take care of all of those things that's
[1:29:45] when she becomes an invincible army when
[1:29:47] one of them is sick they know you devil
[1:29:49] you have no business being there devil
[1:29:52] you have no business taking uh holding
[1:29:54] hostage one of the sons and one of the
[1:29:56] daughters they go and they pray and they
[1:29:58] shake the devil out of it
[1:30:01] why because they realize it's their job
[1:30:04] it's their responsibility to do it
[1:30:09] christ being manifested in his body
[1:30:12] it says
[1:30:13] it's your duty to manifest to express
[1:30:16] god
[1:30:18] to your to the people
[1:30:20] through your neighbors
[1:30:22] through the church
[1:30:24] to everybody you come in contact with
[1:30:26] and i say god
[1:30:28] fill me with that expression
[1:30:30] let me be aware of it as i walk this
[1:30:33] world i want to be aware of my
[1:30:35] expression i don't want to let anything
[1:30:38] slip i want to be aware when i see time
[1:30:40] for the expression i said this is my
[1:30:42] time to worst price itself you hear
[1:30:44] somebody sick you said can i pray for
[1:30:46] you i hear you're saying i don't you
[1:30:48] don't have to know the person oh i'm
[1:30:50] sick and this is you know god can heal
[1:30:52] you
[1:30:55] well i'm just showing you another avenue
[1:30:58] well the doctors have told you that but
[1:31:00] that's not the end of it i know there's
[1:31:01] a god that could heal
[1:31:03] you know i know you're going through
[1:31:04] hard times but i know there's a god who
[1:31:06] could deliver i know you're struggling
[1:31:08] but i know a god who can restore but
[1:31:10] this what is it it's his expression
[1:31:12] being manifested everywhere oh parvanam
[1:31:15] says he was walking and there he was
[1:31:17] just walking and this woman with his
[1:31:19] holy child dead and they were taking him
[1:31:22] in to go bury him and then he came in
[1:31:25] contact with life
[1:31:27] what do you think happened
[1:31:29] amen
[1:31:31] in the same way that that dead child
[1:31:34] came in contact with life and he was
[1:31:36] raised from the dead the same way people
[1:31:39] that are meeting you they are coming in
[1:31:41] contact with life don't let them dead
[1:31:44] don't leave them that i say just talk to
[1:31:46] them and see if life could be restored
[1:31:48] in there
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:52] it's not your job to know whether it's
[1:31:54] going to happen or not but it's your
[1:31:55] duty
[1:31:57] to do that yes sir to express him
[1:32:01] and he
[1:32:02] is duty bound to come
[1:32:04] and manifest himself if you can stand
[1:32:06] tonight
[1:32:10] [Applause]
[1:32:20] one place and
[1:32:22] i believe it's on the prayer line it
[1:32:23] says
[1:32:26] speaks about christ it says
[1:32:28] you're the word
[1:32:30] and there were all of this and they were
[1:32:32] crying
[1:32:35] and he came and says
[1:32:37] he stood right there he says
[1:32:39] who was he he says see
[1:32:42] he was the word in action
[1:32:45] the word in action
[1:32:49] and as he said that that word just stuck
[1:32:51] to me
[1:32:52] i said we're called to be the word in
[1:32:55] action
[1:32:57] the word that actually goes and touches
[1:32:59] somebody you know but when it says they
[1:33:01] stop reading the bible
[1:33:03] they stop going to church
[1:33:05] they stop listening to
[1:33:07] anything that has to do with god and the
[1:33:09] only contact of god they has is you
[1:33:17] and there's never been anyone who's come
[1:33:19] in contact with god and remained the
[1:33:21] same
[1:33:24] now i know we can easily attribute that
[1:33:26] to jesus
[1:33:28] but we can also easily attribute it to
[1:33:31] ourselves
[1:33:32] we're not called to just believe the
[1:33:34] simple things and the easy things we are
[1:33:37] called to believe the body changed
[1:33:40] we are called to believe things that the
[1:33:42] mind cannot understand how is it that i
[1:33:45] touch somebody with my hand and somehow
[1:33:47] there's a power that comes on the person
[1:33:49] and heals them i don't know but i
[1:33:51] believe it
[1:33:52] i've seen it come to pass
[1:33:54] i don't understand how can it be that
[1:33:56] they lay hands on you and supernaturally
[1:33:59] you are well i don't know but i felt it
[1:34:03] i can't explain it i felt it how is it
[1:34:06] that you can speak to somebody and they
[1:34:08] had thoughts to suicide and all kinds of
[1:34:10] things and all of a sudden the mind is
[1:34:12] changing they go on and they go on to do
[1:34:15] right what is it i don't know it's the
[1:34:17] word of god it says to do it and i did
[1:34:20] it and it happened
[1:34:23] oh my brother my sister let god be the
[1:34:25] interpreter of his own word let's do the
[1:34:28] duo let's be the doer and let him come
[1:34:30] and interpret what he wants to do with
[1:34:32] us
[1:34:33] let's just bow our heads our gracious
[1:34:34] father so thankful to be your children

[1:34:56] to walk in the way that you have played
[1:34:59] before us lord the things which you have
[1:35:01] promised lord that's our desire that we

[1:35:44] you know what
[1:35:46] billy shared with us tonight
[1:35:49] was the first thing that satan took away
[1:35:51] from the church
[1:35:54] it was called nicoladianism
[1:36:00] and so we say
[1:36:01] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:36:04] they shall recover
[1:36:06] they created a day
[1:36:10] it was they the preachers
[1:36:13] they the people they
[1:36:15] they
[1:36:16] they
[1:36:17] they gave up me
[1:36:19] for they
[1:36:22] they gave their position away in christ
[1:36:26] to a clergy
[1:36:28] to a doctrine to somebody else
[1:36:32] to man
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:35] and you know we're here to do this
[1:36:37] message was to do it was to restore us
[1:36:40] back to our rightful position
[1:36:42] i'm the one that lays hands on the sin
[1:36:45] i'm the one that passed out devils i'm
[1:36:48] the one that goes into all the world and
[1:36:50] is a witness
[1:36:51] that's me
[1:36:53] that ain't brother mcgary it ain't the
[1:36:55] church it ain't the ministry
[1:36:58] i wish there wasn't even such a thing as
[1:37:00] the word minister
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:04] it should be servant
[1:37:09] when did it become reverent and exalted
[1:37:12] above the people
[1:37:16] anything that's exalted above something
[1:37:18] robs that person
[1:37:20] of the dignity and respect that god's
[1:37:23] given them
[1:37:26] paul said you're not the lord over god's
[1:37:28] heritage
[1:37:32] but you've got to rise up
[1:37:34] we've got to break the curse
[1:37:38] of nickelodeon-ism
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:42] you've got to break the curse
[1:37:45] of looking at people and think an
[1:37:47] ability
[1:37:48] and and the ability to speak or the
[1:37:52] ability to stand in public or the
[1:37:54] ability or or the position you've got to
[1:37:57] break the curse of that
[1:37:59] holding you down
[1:38:01] you've got to rise above it
[1:38:04] you've got to take your place and say
[1:38:06] this is me this book is me
[1:38:09] everything this book says i can do
[1:38:12] i in this word m1 this is me i can
[1:38:17] testify i can witness i can pray for my
[1:38:19] mom i don't care if she's been a
[1:38:22] baptist for 500 years i can take her by
[1:38:25] the hand and tell her that what i've got
[1:38:27] is real and it can transform us
[1:38:31] you
[1:38:32] you yes not me

[1:39:40] different

[1:39:43] hands
