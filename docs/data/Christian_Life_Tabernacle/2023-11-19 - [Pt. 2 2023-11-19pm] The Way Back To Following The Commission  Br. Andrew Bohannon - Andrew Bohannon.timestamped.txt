[0:00] until I come to be a Christian myself
[0:03] you know so growing up I was just like
[0:05] when she said that she trusted the Lord
[0:07] I just left it there and you know the
[0:09] good thing is is um the Lord used that
[0:12] to to teach me something about what he
[0:16] planted that's what we all want we want
[0:19] God to teach us about something that he
[0:21] planted on us inside I love how brother
[0:24] brother Tom when he preached he said
[0:27] he's you know he's here
[0:31] the Miracles and the different things in
[0:32] your life it wasn't because you mentally
[0:35] powered yourself into it there was a
[0:38] force on the inside by the way of a
[0:42] predestinated seed where the spirit of
[0:44] God overshadowed that seed and brought
[0:47] it to
[0:48] life I love that because if any
[0:51] predestinated seed serves its purpose
[0:54] it's promised the resurrection that's
[0:56] what we're looking for the great Rapture
[0:58] the resurrection I want to serve it with
[1:01] all I
[1:02] got every ambition every hurt every
[1:06] trial every
[1:08] Victory
[1:13] amen so I just uh I thank the Lord that
[1:16] he brought me through that because it
[1:17] taught me a little bit about yielding
[1:19] and and um going past the conception of
[1:23] where we limit God sometimes we handcuff
[1:26] God and I thought about Moses you know
[1:29] and and maybe I'll share some of
[1:32] the you know a quote out of that uh
[1:36] perfect strength by Perfect weakness but
[1:38] you know that's how we all come to that
[1:40] place where if in our fulfilling the
[1:43] commission and going into all the world
[1:47] we have to take our eyes off
[1:49] ourselves and we have to look to the one
[1:51] who spoke to us and made the promise you
[1:54] know we can't go and fulfill it if we've
[1:56] never had that personal contact and so I
[1:59] say that that we all have to have that
[2:01] backside of the desert experience amen
[2:04] because if we don't if we don't have
[2:06] anything to share you know like as far
[2:08] as an experience it's just Doctrine
[2:10] which is fine but we're believing for a
[2:12] real genuine experience with
[2:15] God and so as you know just to see how
[2:20] God would speak a little something and
[2:23] then just to do what he said and then
[2:25] see
[2:26] how One Soul after the other after the
[2:29] other after the other because God had
[2:32] given me insight to his Divine
[2:36] will that she was not going to come out
[2:40] of that hospital alive I began to speak
[2:44] to each one of my cousins and different
[2:46] ones and before there was any signs of
[2:48] really death upon her she was just
[2:51] having shortness of breath they gave her
[2:53] some oxygen and she was fine so I I
[2:57] really looked out of sorts when I'm
[2:58] coming at her with that that angle and
[3:01] so um you know as time passed like a day
[3:05] or two things started to change but
[3:08] thankfully I I was able to talk to I
[3:11] have five older cousins on my mom's
[3:14] sister my Aunt Sandy and so I was able
[3:16] to talk with them and I said you know
[3:18] pre-venture you know you don't have
[3:20] another opportunity to share your heart
[3:23] with Grandmother if something was to
[3:25] turn and drastically change is there
[3:27] something you need to make right you you
[3:29] know is there something that if if this
[3:33] was your last moment to say thank you or
[3:36] or to settle something or or whatever
[3:40] like if you knew tomorrow that one of
[3:42] your dear loved ones would cross over
[3:45] the Border cross over the chasm and God
[3:48] spoke to you and said it's in your hands
[3:51] you can speak life into that situation
[3:55] it's in your
[3:56] hands we have that we have that now
[4:00] God is he's saying like we we're not
[4:03] guaranteed
[4:04] tomorrow and so we got to have the love
[4:07] of God for somebody else despite what it
[4:09] feels like looks like what they might
[4:12] think but you have the words of
[4:15] life you you know we're the last voice
[4:18] to the last age under our messenger this
[4:22] voice that we've heard when we come
[4:24] subject and it's our life now it's our
[4:27] very essence of life so when they
[4:30] inquire of us why do you not go to the
[4:33] ball games and drink like you used to
[4:36] why don't you you know associate at the
[4:39] drunken revelries why don't you still
[4:42] you were a fighter why don't you still
[4:43] when they talk bad about you why don't
[4:45] you just knock them out you know why
[4:47] don't you do this and why don't you do
[4:49] that well I've had a change I've invited
[4:54] the Creator God he saved me from
[4:56] myself
[4:58] amen
[5:01] my the way back to following the
[5:05] commission you I think that we have to
[5:07] keep our eyes focused on that
[5:10] purpose
[5:17] amen praise the Lord you know I just
[5:19] think about the scripture I'll read it
[5:23] in First Kings you can turn with me
[5:25] there you know we're like Brother David
[5:28] quoted the scripture don't you know that
[5:31] you're the Temple of the Living God you
[5:34] know it was it was God's desire to have
[5:37] himself a a body without made without
[5:42] hands and you know we have to go like
[5:44] brother Dave was saying we're going
[5:46] backwards in the church ages you know
[5:49] we're coming through the justification
[5:51] the sanctification and now
[5:54] we're possessing all the the enemy stole
[5:58] amen but in in First Kings chapter 2 I
[6:04] love the words of how
[6:10] David was speaking you know because we
[6:13] know that you know David desired to
[6:17] build a house for the Ark of God and he
[6:20] was told right he was told David do all
[6:24] that's in your heart for God is with you
[6:27] you know it's a comfort to know that God
[6:29] is with us amen but there's a will of
[6:31] God to be performed and
[6:33] obeyed and so in First Kings chapter 2
[6:37] and we'll start with verse
[6:40] one he said now the days of David Drew
[6:43] nigh and that he should die and he
[6:45] charged Solomon his son saying I go the
[6:49] way of all the Earth be thou strong
[6:52] therefore and show thyself a man and
[6:56] keep the charge of the Lord thy God to
[6:59] walk in in his ways and to keep his
[7:01] statutes and his Commandments and his
[7:04] judgments and his testimonies and is
[7:06] written as it is written in the laws of
[7:08] Mo in the law of Moses that thou mayest
[7:11] prosper in all thou doest and whatever
[7:15] whether soever thou turnest thyself and
[7:18] the Lord may continue his word which he
[7:21] spake concerning me saying If thy
[7:24] children take heed to their we to their
[7:27] way to walk before for me in truth with
[7:30] all their heart and with all their soul
[7:34] there shall not fail thee he said a man
[7:38] on the throne of Israel amen and we know
[7:41] there's a man here that can turn on the
[7:43] light you know if you're struggling if
[7:45] you're Desiring God wants to take the
[7:48] Throne of our heart he wants to bring
[7:51] the light of Shalom to us amen God is
[7:55] here to bring peace in the midst of our
[7:57] trials in our storms STS in our
[8:00] difficults in the good times in the in
[8:03] between he wants to say I got a word for
[8:07] you to follow after me if we could do
[8:09] like David told Solomon and just keep
[8:13] the charge of the
[8:15] Lord thy God see it wasn't just David's
[8:18] God David was saying keep the charge of
[8:22] the Lord thy God there's no
[8:25] grandchildren in the economy of God God
[8:28] has sons and daughters so if your mother
[8:31] and your father have a testimony what
[8:33] about
[8:35] you if your grandparents have it but you
[8:39] need it it's for
[8:42] you let's take our eyes off ourselves
[8:45] and let's take it and put it back on the
[8:47] one who made the promise amen that's
[8:50] where we're going to get the victory we
[8:52] want to look to what he what he did when
[8:55] he died on the cross why did he die what
[8:58] was the purpose you know to God if we
[9:02] had two of the literal drops of his
[9:05] blood what good would it do
[9:08] us right I mean it it might do somebody
[9:11] some good but to God the purchase was
[9:15] even more
[9:16] valuable oh think about it your
[9:20] salvation your
[9:23] Redemption is more valuable to him
[9:26] because what it did is it set us on a
[9:30] path back to God back to Oneness with
[9:34] God Amen is't that
[9:37] wonderful you know I think that's part
[9:40] of the struggle so much for me and I
[9:43] believe for believers is like Moses you
[9:46] know when you're in the journey you know
[9:48] he
[9:50] said you
[9:52] know who am I you ever feel yourself
[9:55] saying something like that you know who
[9:58] am I
[10:00] you know and it's not who am I it's what
[10:04] God has given us when he may contact
[10:07] with us that's the testimony is what God
[10:11] has done for us he showed us that he
[10:14] died he laid his life down no man taketh
[10:17] my life I give it as a
[10:21] ransom and he's worthy to give
[10:25] all you know this is out of um
[10:30] perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[10:32] I'll just jump in right here and
[10:35] just this will probably be the
[10:37] close but he says this in 160 he says
[10:41] but there's one thing Moses had that I
[10:43] admire he had the sense enough to know
[10:45] that he was
[10:46] licked we haven't that's all we make a
[10:50] new denomination we get somebody else
[10:54] with a healing gift or something the
[10:56] Pentecost you see we just don't know
[11:00] enough to realize that we're licked the
[11:02] Pentecostal Church the Assemblies of God
[11:04] the United the rest of them seems like
[11:07] they haven't got the ability to know
[11:09] that they're licked hallelujah oh I wish
[11:12] I could get I wish I could make that
[11:15] stick they are licked the church
[11:17] organization is
[11:19] licked just the same as the United
[11:21] States is licked trembling fearing the
[11:24] bombs hanging Yonder for them they know
[11:27] that they're dancing away and dating
[11:29] their life to
[11:31] Hell dated their life to hell and they
[11:34] were trees of young men to the army they
[11:38] seen what happened on the other one
[11:41] they're licked the church is licked they
[11:43] know it Moses realized it then he knew
[11:47] enough then and God took him back in the
[11:50] back in the wilderness to learn some
[11:53] human
[11:54] weaknesses he took him back to learn
[11:57] what it was all about so well did he
[12:00] learn oh my did you ever get a lesson
[12:05] God must have had a time with him back
[12:07] there you know Moses had a temper God
[12:11] gave him a wife by the name of Zapora
[12:14] she had one too could you imagine
[12:16] everything wasn't so pleasing back there
[12:20] on the back side of the desert for a
[12:22] while they both were their tempers got
[12:25] out of control at the same
[12:27] time I I suppose his intellectual
[12:30] conceptions of how psychology ought to
[12:32] control a person didn't do good because
[12:35] when they were on the road down to Egypt
[12:38] he sees Zapora still had a temper she
[12:40] cut the foreskin of her son and threw it
[12:42] before Moses and said you're a bloody
[12:44] husband to me
[12:47] mine and God was so angry with him he
[12:50] looked at him he he he looked for him in
[12:53] the end and he could have found him and
[12:56] slay him I guess there's a little thing
[12:59] God had to teach him back there see that
[13:03] he was human all of his wisdom of Egypt
[13:06] and all the powers of intellect
[13:09] intellectual God could not use one of
[13:12] them you come and say now Lord I've been
[13:14] schooled 40 years now I'm an elect
[13:17] intellectual student I can quote the
[13:20] Bible with my eyes closed God can't use
[13:23] a bit of that see no oh I belong to the
[13:26] biggest church in the country I'm the
[13:29] this Lord oh I'm Pentecostal glory to
[13:33] God I've got I've received the Holy
[13:35] Ghost the other night
[13:37] Hallelujah you're going to make me do so
[13:40] and
[13:41] so oh my God can't use a bit of
[13:46] that whenever you get licked and realize
[13:49] you're lick and then you come
[13:52] back come on back and humble yourself
[13:56] get weak find out
[13:59] you're human and then nobody's and none
[14:02] of your
[14:03] intellectuals can do it human weaknesses
[14:06] will never be used of God God by human
[14:09] weaknesses pours himself into you then
[14:13] he uses himself oh I love that
[14:20] amen you just become an instrument
[14:24] certainly you've got to get yourself out
[14:26] of the way amen man what's the purpose
[14:30] Lord I got to get to that place where
[14:33] all my weaknesses I'm just committing
[14:36] them to God I know you can't use
[14:40] those get yourself out of the way Moses
[14:42] he learned he learned human weaknesses
[14:45] real good he learned it was so well till
[14:49] when God called him he had seven
[14:51] weaknesses he can argue against the call
[14:54] God's call did you ever study it in the
[14:57] first part of Exodus the seven
[15:00] weaknesses I got them written down here
[15:02] I want you to listen to them the first
[15:05] weakness he had was a lack of message
[15:07] now after we share these with you none
[15:09] of us have this
[15:11] excuse because there's a Moses in each
[15:14] side one of us we have human we're human
[15:19] I can't fulfill what God commissioned me
[15:21] to do but we can't make
[15:25] excuses you know I know that we've been
[15:27] invited to this feast and it's n it's
[15:30] natural for us to make excuses not to
[15:32] come and let him lead us to the Fountain
[15:35] let us lead us to be
[15:37] transformed the second weakness he has
[15:39] was the lack of authority the third
[15:41] weakness was the lack of eloquence I
[15:44] can't
[15:46] talk there's a Moses in each side of one
[15:48] of
[15:51] us the fourth one is adaption the fifth
[15:54] one was success the sixth one was
[15:57] Acceptance Now now you compare yours to
[16:00] his and see if you come out up with that
[16:04] see if you can get a weak as he was Lord
[16:08] I I ain't no good I can't speak I slew
[16:11] an Egyptian I can't go back and
[16:15] everything they won't receive me I've
[16:17] got no message I've got I can't speak
[16:20] I'm slow to
[16:21] speech see how he was he was nothing
[16:26] brother he was cured am yeah God could
[16:31] use him then after he was cured yeah yes
[16:35] and he had used him after he got him
[16:38] cured and we find that the my PhD lldd
[16:43] and dou LD or whatever you might it
[16:46] might be all my degrees is nothing God
[16:48] can't use them
[16:50] amen you know I just think that that's
[16:52] so special because you know when you
[16:55] think about in each one of us you know
[16:58] the devil always with reasonings tries
[16:59] to get us to accept some kind of reason
[17:03] not to fulfill the purpose that God has
[17:06] for each one of us and it's just our
[17:09] time to take inventory and to say have I
[17:12] invited any excuse not to do what he
[17:15] said you know we have by the promise to
[17:19] overcome that amen because he placed the
[17:21] Overcomer in you he says I've already
[17:23] overcome all the world and I'm in you if
[17:25] you'll just look it's the kingdom of God
[17:28] is within us so when we pray we pray to
[17:31] the god the Overcomer that is in us
[17:34] we're not going to make excuses of this
[17:36] old pest house you know My Five Senses
[17:40] my inward senses but if we'll believe
[17:43] for the
[17:44] impossibility because with man it's
[17:48] impossible but there's a man on the
[17:51] inside that can turn on the light could
[17:53] shine the light in this Dark Age if
[17:56] we're willing we can enter in
[17:58] pass the excuses
[18:00] tonight and let God live amen you
[18:03] believe that you believe it with all
[18:05] your heart amen why don't we
[18:18] stand you know as we go forward in this
[18:21] Great
[18:22] Commission let's keep our eyes on the
[18:25] one who gave the promise he said I'll be
[18:27] with you even in you till the end of the
[18:31] world Amen and God he's placed something
[18:34] in that
[18:35] seed he placed that craving that thirst
[18:40] and if we'll just let him lead their
[18:42] spiritual food in the storehouse not
[18:45] only for us as a body but as as
[18:47] individuals I believe that God wants to
[18:49] take that thirst that desire that
[18:52] appetite that is inside the seed and if
[18:56] we'll let him lead he'll fulfill it and
[18:58] it'll be the satisfying portion amen why
[19:02] don't we bow our hearts
[19:05] together if you feel
[19:07] that you just want to release something
[19:10] to the Lord tonight and you want to
[19:13] raise your hand and say this has been an
[19:15] excuse and I just want to lift my hand
[19:18] and give it to you today Lord and say um
[19:21] brother Andrew what good is lifting my
[19:24] hands about this thing that is in my way
[19:28] well why don't you try it and see taste
[19:30] to see if the Lord will respond to your
[19:36] sincerity Heavenly Father Lord here
[19:40] where we are as a body as a church Lord
[19:44] we've been called out of the world Lord
[19:46] to display the true and living God lord
[19:50] lord there's been traps set up for us
[19:53] and try
[19:55] to give us reasons and excuses to not
[19:59] carry out and keep the charge that
[20:02] you've commissioned us as individuals
[20:04] but we're laying them down we're lifting
[20:05] them up to you Lord saying take them
[20:08] Lord take our excuses take our
[20:11] weaknesses father we want to bring glory
[20:13] and honor to Your Great Name so as we
[20:16] commit the people to you and these needs

[20:22] Divine exchange Lord we can take and lay
[20:25] our ashes our filthy rags upon your
[20:28] altar surely you're the only one that
[20:30] can cleanse it and make it new so we

[25:00] your heart's desire you wanted to make
[25:02] an opportunity for anybody who wanted to
[25:04] give their heart to the Lord or if you
[25:06] want prayer we're going to take this
[25:08] opportunity before we close this service
[25:11] and we invite brother Billy to come
[25:14] maybe sing another song
[25:16] and I just wanted to give that
[25:18] opportunity it's such a late hour and
[25:21] such a desperate time and God is making
[25:24] his
[25:26] children so one with his word I I wanted
[25:29] to read this and this is out of the
[25:31] Samaritan Church age but Samaritan means
[25:34] bitter and they derive the word mura
[25:37] mura was used to embalm the dead thus
[25:40] the two-fold significance found in the
[25:43] name of this age it was bitter and
[25:46] filled with death the two Vines within
[25:48] the framework of the church was drifted
[25:51] far apart with an increased bitterness
[25:54] towards the True Vine and the part of
[25:56] the false death was not only the seed of
[25:59] the false Vine but even in the True Vine
[26:03] there was creeping a paralysis and an
[26:06] imp impotence because they had already
[26:09] drifted from the unadulterated truth of
[26:13] the first few years after Pentecost and
[26:17] no True Believer is any stronger or
[26:20] spiritually healthy and Alive than his
[26:23] knowledge of and adherence to the Pew
[26:26] word of God amen
[26:29] that's praise the Lord Brother Billy if
[26:31] you
[26:34] [Music]
[26:45] coming aren't you thankful for his word
[26:49] amen is it's not looking for what is
[26:53] human what we can produce what we can
[26:56] come up with and how well we can conduct
[26:59] ourselves by ourselves he's only looking
[27:02] to what his word can produce in us it's
[27:06] not looking for human strength or human
[27:09] weakness in fact it's by the weakness he
[27:11] takes and he makes his strength
[27:13] perfect he wants us to take his word to
[27:17] take his way his provided way and use it
[27:22] and let that provided way take hold of
[27:25] our human mind our human uh uh abilities
[27:29] and all the human weakness and take that
[27:31] and produce something that only God can
[27:35] do our Pastor said if it's intellect
[27:39] you'll find somebody with more intellect
[27:41] than what you
[27:43] have if it's by explanation you'll find
[27:46] someone who can explain better than you
[27:49] can but if it's by something that God
[27:52] did in your heart no one can ever take
[27:56] that away from you you can stand there
[27:58] and say I I was sick and God healed me I
[28:01] used to desire the things of the world
[28:03] but he took that away from me he caused
[28:06] me to be a son and that's how God
[28:11] works but often time we are drawn to
[28:14] intellect and learning things we don't
[28:17] know and all and that's wonderful as
[28:20] long as we let the spirit of God come
[28:22] upon us and change us so the word of God
[28:25] could be manifested through us us that
[28:28] he himself can come because the promise
[28:31] of the father is I will come in you and

[33:06] this Lord we're just thankful for the
[33:08] word tonight
[33:11] Lord I'm
[33:13] just reminded
[33:17] of what the pastor was saying this
[33:20] morning
[33:22] Lord how we're not just supposed to be
[33:24] hearers of the word but doers of the
[33:26] word
[33:29] we supposed to have that Faith like they
[33:32] had back in the beginning Lord in the
[33:34] beginning of your church whenever they
[33:35] didn't have a Bible or books or tapes
[33:39] although we have it now and we have we
[33:41] have a word that's coming our day that
[33:43] we're supposed to speak but it's the
[33:45] faith it's the experience that they had
[33:48] that they that they could go up
[33:50] to somebody like the man that was laying
[33:53] at the gate
[33:54] beautiful and give what they had to to
[33:57] him
[33:58] Lord without giving him some sort of a a
[34:03] book maybe like your like the pastor was
[34:05] saying maybe as an excuse just just
[34:08] giving him something to appease a
[34:12] religious
[34:13] Duty instead they gave him
[34:16] power to get up and
[34:19] walk
[34:21] yes so that he could go and receive the
[34:24] same experience that they got that's
[34:26] right
[34:29] and Lord we
