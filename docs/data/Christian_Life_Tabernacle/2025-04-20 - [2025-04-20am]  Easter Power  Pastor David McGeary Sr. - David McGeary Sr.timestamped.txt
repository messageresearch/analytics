[16:29] [Music]

[16:41] Oh, he came with praise
[16:45] [Music]
[16:47] and
[16:59] [Music]
[17:01] oh God.
[17:06] Oh, I
[17:08] see his
[17:13] face.
[17:16] [Music]
[17:24] Oh. Heat.
[17:35] Heat. Heat.
[17:40] [Music]
[17:48] Heat.
[17:49] Yeah. Heat.
[17:52] [Music]
[18:07] [Music]
[18:13] God, our
[18:17] God.
[18:18] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad he's alive
[18:21] this morning? Amen. Where would we be if
[18:23] he didn't raise from the dead? What
[18:26] would we be if he didn't come? But we
[18:28] thankful this morning because he's alive
[18:30] and well. And because he live, we shall
[18:33] live also. Amen. That's the promise to
[18:35] the believer. Certainly glad to be in
[18:37] the house of God. Want to welcome
[18:39] everyone in the house of God. But Tim
[18:41] Sal, if you could just come and open our
[18:42] service in prayer this morning.
[18:46] [Music]
[18:51] Amen. Good morning. Welcome to
[18:54] Resurrection Sunday.
[18:56] [Music]
[18:59] He had a lot to die for and we've got a
[19:00] lot to live for. Amen. Let's just bow
[19:03] our
[19:03] heads. Gracious and kind heavenly
[19:06] father, we thank you, Lord, for just the
[19:08] ability to
[19:10] recognize the
[19:12] resurrection and the beauty of life that
[19:15] you've given us,
[19:16] Lord. Realizing as brother Billy said,
[19:19] where would we be without a risen
[19:22] savior? And Lord truly as that grave is
[19:27] empty, that tomb has been vacated, Lord,
[19:30] may you
[19:31] just search our hearts, Lord. If there
[19:34] be any stone of
[19:35] unbelief, Lord, it keeps you in tuned,
[19:38] keeps you from living in our own lives,
[19:41] Lord, may you move it away. May you rise
[19:44] this morning, Lord, outside the realms
[19:48] of this flesh, Lord. Though we claim to
[19:51] have an indwelling of your spirit, Lord,
[19:53] may we realize that these earthly
[19:55] bodies, the things we move about
[19:58] in, Lord, they are part of this world,
[20:02] Lord. You've sanctified us. You've set
[20:04] us aside. May we recognize that, Lord,
[20:07] and and don't hold us bound by these
[20:10] things, Lord.
[20:12] May we enter into a
[20:15] special communion this morning, Lord,
[20:18] with you. We realize that the pain, the
[20:21] aches, the the stress and troubles of
[20:25] this life, Lord. May we just lay them
[20:26] aside for this
[20:27] time. Truly
[20:30] recognize a resurrection in our midst,
[20:34] not just of old, but here this morning.
[20:37] Lord, may you live and move and have
[20:40] your being as your scripture says. Lord,
[20:43] draw us closer to you for having come to
[20:45] this service, Lord. Lord, if there's any
[20:48] sick or needy where you are, Lord, they
[20:51] get dissolved. They get moved away.
[20:53] Things are made
[20:54] well, you change every situation, Lord.
[20:57] We pray that that would be the case this
[20:59] morning. That no one would leave wanting
[21:02] or desiring anything. Lord, we can move
[21:04] up a little higher. Lord, as we look for
[21:07] you to break the eastern
[21:10] skies, Lord, may we look for you today,
[21:12] Lord, to to come in the presence of your
[21:15] word. Quicken it to us, Lord. We pray.
[21:19] Grant it,
[21:20] Lord. Be with those that are having
[21:22] services elsewhere, Lord. We think of
[21:24] our brother Matthew and and the group
[21:26] that may be over there with them. Lord,
[21:28] may your divine presence, Lord, just
[21:30] draw us as a body, as a true family of
[21:33] God, closer to you universally, Lord,
[21:36] around this world as we prepare for your
[21:39] soon appearing. Grant it to us now as we
[21:41] pray and ask these things in the lovely
[21:42] name of the resurrected Lord Jesus.
[21:47] Amen.
[21:49] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let me turn
[21:52] around and welcome someone this morning.
[21:54] Amen. And I know that we have many out
[21:56] at Louisiana camp this morning as
[21:58] brother Tim mentioned and want to
[22:01] continue to pray for them.
[22:10] Amen. Amen. God bless you. May have your
[22:14] seats. Oh, would you be free from your
[22:18] burden of sin? Oh, there's power in the
[22:22] blood. Oh, and power in the blood. Oh,
[22:27] and
[22:28] [Music]

[29:42] I
[29:43] praise him to the Lord
[29:49] today.

[29:54] Amen. Amen. He certainly deserves our
[29:56] praises.
[29:58] Amen. Amen. Sister Chipo has a special
[30:01] Amen. And after that, Sister Sarah will
[30:03] bring hers. Amen.
[30:32] [Music]
[30:50] I'm not
[30:53] on an ego trip. I'm nothing.
[30:58] on my
[31:01] own. I've made
[31:05] mistakes and often
[31:08] slip. I'm just coming flesh and bone.
[31:14] But I'll prove
[31:17] someday just why I
[31:21] say I'm of a
[31:24] special
[31:26] kind. For when he was on the
[31:33] cross, I was on his mind.
[31:40] [Music]
[31:42] Oh, he
[31:44] knew me
[31:48] yet he
[31:50] loved
[31:55] me. He who was
[31:58] glory makes the
[32:02] heaven shine.
[32:07] I'm so unworthy.
[32:12] [Music]
[32:14] Oh, such mercy.
[32:20] For when he was on the cross,
[32:26] [Music]
[32:29] I was on his mind.
[32:38] The look of love was on his
[32:43] face and thorns were on his
[32:49] head. The blood was on that scarlet
[32:55] robe. It was saint and crimson
[33:02] red. Even though his eyes were on that
[33:07] crown the
[33:09] day he looked
[33:11] ahead in
[33:14] time for when he was on the
[33:21] cross. I was on his mind.
[33:31] Oh, he
[33:32] knew
[33:36] me yet he
[33:39] love me.
[33:43] [Music]
[33:45] Oh my
[33:53] [Applause]
[33:55] [Music]
[34:09] go for when he was on the
[34:17] I was on his
[34:21] mind for he knew me. Let's sing
[34:25] together. For he
[34:27] knew
[34:30] me yet he
[34:33] loved me.
[34:39] Oh, he was
[34:42] glory makes the
[34:49] heaven. We were so
[34:54] [Music]
[34:56] unworthy of such mercy.
[35:00] [Music]
[35:04] Oh, when he was on the
[35:11] cross, I was on his mind.
[35:16] [Music]
[35:20] Oh, when he was on the
[35:27] cross,
[35:29] I was
[35:32] on
[35:33] his way.
[35:38] [Music]
[35:53] mind when he was on the cross. Amen. He
[35:56] went to die so he can restore that
[36:00] fellowship that he had with you. Amen.
[36:02] Amen. We have a testimony from brother
[36:04] Enoch.
[36:05] writes, "Um, may the saints of the
[36:09] living God uh join me in thanking God
[36:12] for his successful dissertation defense
[36:15] uh that occurred on Friday. Uh may his
[36:18] wonderful name be praised." Amen. We
[36:20] certainly thank the Lord for that.
[36:22] Brother Jay writes, "Uh, today is my
[36:24] wife's birthday. May the Lord bless her
[36:26] and strengthen her, man. I certainly
[36:29] want to wish her happy birthday." Happy
[36:31] birthday. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[36:36] [Applause]
[36:40] uh request for prayer from brother
[36:41] William. He writes, "Please pray for me
[36:44] as I'm feeling significant pain uh on my
[36:47] right leg and certainly pray that the
[36:49] Lord will touch him." Amen. We know as
[36:52] we stated this morning, we have uh many
[36:55] of our uh youth and even uh counselors
[36:59] and chaperon up in Louisiana, but
[37:01] Matthew's preaching this morning. We
[37:03] just want to pray that the Lord will
[37:04] give them a wonderful service. I don't
[37:07] know if you had an opportunity to watch
[37:08] some of the services. It was wonderful.
[37:10] And and we have some that are um uh were
[37:14] baptized. We certainly thank the Lord
[37:16] for that. Amen. So if you have a need
[37:18] upon your heart to slip your hand after
[37:20] him, amen this morning. Amen. Is the
[37:23] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[37:25] he hasn't changed. It's the same God
[37:27] always. We can come with confidence
[37:30] knowing that uh whatever we have need
[37:32] of, Amen, he's able to give it to us.
[37:35] Amen. Brothers that are taking the
[37:36] offerings if you could come.
[37:38] [Music]
[37:45] Amen. Let's just bow heads. Our gracious
[37:48] [Music]
[37:49] father, what can we say,
[37:52] Lord? Father, we so thankful of this
[37:57] morning, Lord. the Easter weekend.
[38:00] Father, we are bought in remembrance of
[38:03] the life that you gave, Lord. And
[38:06] Father, you came and you gave your life
[38:08] so we could live, Lord. And we gather
[38:11] here, Father, as the expression of that
[38:13] love that you poured down. And you came
[38:16] and you became us so we can become you,
[38:19] Lord. And Father, you took away our sins
[38:22] and our shame.
[38:24] Father, the chastisement of our peace
[38:26] was laid upon you and you say it's by
[38:28] your stripes that we are healed. You
[38:30] took our place that we may become you.
[38:33] Lord, we pray this morning for every
[38:35] need that's represented this morning.
[38:37] And our brother William with the pain in
[38:40] the leg and Father, whatever the need is
[38:43] behind the uplifted hand, Father, we
[38:46] know that we have a sacrifice this
[38:48] morning that was given. And that
[38:50] sacrifice was good enough to take away
[38:53] everything that we go through. And we
[38:55] pray Lord by that that sacrifice. May
[38:58] you come this morning and impart to each
[39:00] believer what they have need of because
[39:03] we know Lord that in you we live. In you
[39:06] we have our being. In you everything
[39:08] that we have need of we find it. Lord
[39:11] bless this this service this morning.
[39:13] Bless our pastor. Lord and father as the
[39:16] word will be brought forth. May you just
[39:18] come by our way and strengthen us, oh
[39:20] God, and by the way of your word that we
[39:22] may receive life, Lord, life eternal. We
[39:25] commit the tithes and the offerings into
[39:28] your hands, Father. Those that will
[39:29] give, bless their hands, oh God, and
[39:31] those that don't, Father. You're the God
[39:34] who can multiply. You're the God that
[39:36] can give. May you give us an
[39:37] opportunity, Lord, that we may give to
[39:39] your kingdom. Bless the service. We
[39:41] commit it to you and we thank you. In
[39:43] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[39:45] pray. Amen.

[39:51] bring me special.
[39:54] [Music]
[40:05] Amen. Love was more than
[40:09] just a pretty word to
[40:13] say. When the father gave his son upon
[40:19] the cross one
[40:23] day and all the fighter
[40:27] souls never take the
[40:31] place of a cup of water
[40:36] gi

[40:44] empty. When they see our hearts are
[40:48] full, they will know that he is

[40:59] you, the world will know who holds

[41:34] We can show the world that he's alive
[41:42] again. There's no better way for them to
[41:47] see his
[41:50] plan than to see our lives completely in
[41:55] his hands.
[41:58] The world will know the tomb is
[42:03] empty when they see our hearts are full.
[42:08] They will know that he is the living
[42:12] when he lives in me and you. The world
[42:17] will know who holds
[42:20] tomorrow. When we hold to him today, the
[42:25] world will

[43:21] They will know that
[43:23] he's living when he lives in me and
[43:30] you. The world will know who holds
[43:35] tomorrow. When they see us cling to him,
[43:39] the world will
[43:44] know. The world will know.
[43:52] Oh, the world will
[43:59] know. Lord, let them see you live in us.
[44:04] I
[44:11] pray for the world will

[44:20] [Applause]
[44:24] know.
[44:26] Amen. I want the world to know that he
[44:29] lives by my life. Amen. That's my heart
[44:32] desire.
[44:34] Amen. Let's sing that song. Where would
[44:37] I be if not for grace?
[44:40] [Music]
[44:42] Amen. Where where would I
[44:48] be? You only
[44:52] know. I'm glad you
[44:57] see through eyes of love.
[45:01] Oh, and a hopeless king. Oh, and an
[45:06] empty
[45:08] place. Oh, if not, oh, where would I be?
[45:14] Where would I
[45:17] be? You only
[45:21] know. Oh, and I'm glad you
[45:26] see through eyes of Lord.
[45:30] Oh, a hopeless king. Oh, what an empty
[45:37] grave. Oh, and
[45:40] if Oh, amazing grace. Amazing
[45:46] grace, a sweet sound.

[45:59] now a hopeless
[46:03] king and
[46:06] empty. Oh
[46:08] love. Oh amazing grace. Amazing
[46:15] grace. It's a sweet
[46:19] sound. I once was
[46:23] lost, but now I'm

[47:39] Oh, sister.
[48:15] to see when he rose
[48:18] again to touch his wounded hands and
[48:22] feet. And know he died for you and
[48:27] me. I didn't feel the scars he
[48:31] bore. And yet I know his love is
[48:36] sure. And though I've never seen his
[48:40] face, I know he's with us every
[48:45] day. Have fell. The piercing nails of
[48:50] the very hands that heal us. With his
[48:54] feet that climb the lonely hills, the
[48:59] feet that cross beside us. His eyes that
[49:04] hold the deepest pain and see the best
[49:10] within us. He knows my heart. He knows
[49:15] my name.
[49:17] [Music]
[49:18] This is
[49:28] Jesus. Someday we'll see him come
[49:32] again. With power and glory he'll
[49:37] descend. And every tongue will speak his
[49:40] name. And every knee will bow in praise.
[49:46] And we'll be there to see his
[49:50] face to touch the scars that still
[49:54] remain to feel his love for every soul.
[49:59] And all the world will finally know the
[50:05] spell. The piercing nails are the very
[50:09] head that heal us. These feet that climb
[50:15] on the holy hills are the feet that wash
[50:20] beside us.
[50:23] Jesus, the deepest dream. I'll see the
[50:27] best within us. He knows my heart. He
[50:33] knows my
[50:36] name. This is Jesus.
[50:42] The truth, the life, the only
[50:48] way. This is Jesus.
[50:52] [Music]
[50:56] [Applause]
[51:27] [Music]
[51:43] Some are known by gra
[51:49] 14 for
[51:51] kingdoms as far as eyes can
[51:57] see. And fire rose they rule from
[52:01] thrones. Waging wars. They overthrow the

[1:00:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sister Rebecca
[1:00:28] is a special if she could bring it at
[1:00:30] this time.
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:18] They all walked
[1:01:20] away with nothing. came to
[1:01:24] say they had just lost their dearest
[1:01:31] friend. All that he
[1:01:35] said now he was
[1:01:38] dead. So this is the way it would
[1:01:45] end. The dreams they had
[1:01:48] dreamed were not what it
[1:01:52] seemed now that he was dead and
[1:01:59] gone. The garden, the
[1:02:03] jail, the hammer, the nail.
[1:02:09] How could a
[1:02:12] night be so
[1:02:18] long? Then came the
[1:02:26] morning. Night turned into
[1:02:32] day. The
[1:02:34] stone was rolled away.
[1:02:41] Hope rose with the
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:46] dawn. Then came the
[1:02:53] morning. Shadows
[1:02:56] vanished before the
[1:03:00] sun. Death had lost and life had won.
[1:03:09] For
[1:03:10] morning had
[1:03:17] come. The angel, the
[1:03:20] star, the kings from
[1:03:24] afar, the wedding, the
[1:03:27] water, the
[1:03:31] wine. Now it was done. They had taken
[1:03:37] her
[1:03:38] son, wasted
[1:03:41] before his
[1:03:45] time. She knew it was
[1:03:48] true. She'd watched him die, too. She'd
[1:03:53] heard them call him just a man.
[1:04:00] But deep in her
[1:04:02] heart, she knew from the
[1:04:07] start
[1:04:08] somehow her son would
[1:04:13] live
[1:04:17] again. Then came the morning.
[1:04:26] I turned in
[1:04:31] today. The stone was rolled
[1:04:38] away. Hope rose with the
[1:04:44] dawn. Then came the morning.
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:52] Shadows vanish before the
[1:04:58] sun. Death had lost and life had
[1:05:05] won. For morning had
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:12] come. Then came the morning.
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:20] Shadows vanished
[1:05:22] before the
[1:05:26] sun. Death had lost and life had
[1:05:33] won. For morning had come.
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:44] [Applause]
[1:05:51] Hallelujah. Let's all stand this
[1:05:54] morning. Let's sing. I know my redeemer
[1:05:57] liveth.
[1:05:59] Amen. And because he live, we shall live
[1:06:02] also. Amen. As we get ready for the
[1:06:04] word. Amen.
[1:06:06] Who thought the
[1:06:09] sun wait to stand in
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:15] morning? Who told the
[1:06:18] ocean you can only come this far?
[1:06:26] And
[1:06:27] who
[1:06:30] should he hide in the
[1:06:33] name whose words alone can catch a
[1:06:38] falling
[1:06:41] star. I
[1:06:44] know my redeemer.
[1:06:50] Oh, and I
[1:06:52] know my
[1:06:55] redeemer
[1:06:57] live. Oh, and let our
[1:07:00] creation
[1:07:03] testify his life within me. Christ, I
[1:07:09] know my
[1:07:11] redeemer. Sing it as we go to pastor
[1:07:14] this morning. A very
[1:07:20] simple
[1:07:21] thing. Oh, it runs to the
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:33] we gentle
[1:07:36] hands that holds me when I'm broken.
[1:07:40] All the dark contest to bring me
[1:07:47] victory. I
[1:07:50] know the
[1:07:55] redeemer. Oh, I
[1:07:58] know my
[1:08:01] redeemer live.
[1:08:04] Oh, and let our
[1:08:06] creation
[1:08:09] testify within
[1:08:15] Christ. I
[1:08:19] believe our gracious
[1:08:22] father
[1:08:26] certainly this morning we
[1:08:29] celebrating that like great life.
[1:08:33] Father, that we know that you're alive
[1:08:36] and present with us. Lord, we ask you to
[1:08:39] bless our service this morning, our
[1:08:42] Easter service. Father, those that are
[1:08:44] away in camp and returning home, we ask
[1:08:48] your mighty hand to be on them. Father,
[1:08:51] may each of us this morning rejoice in
[1:08:54] what that we have. And Lord, what that
[1:08:57] we've been given. May our revelation
[1:09:00] increase. We ask for your grace and
[1:09:03] mercy in Jesus precious and wonderful
[1:09:07] name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless
[1:09:11] you this morning. If you have
[1:09:21] your headset got crunched
[1:09:26] anyway. They got it backwards.
[1:09:30] That don't work either. I got it. All
[1:09:32] right, here we are. We're back. Ah,
[1:09:38] they figured it out. Let's turn in our
[1:09:40] Bibles this morning. Uh
[1:09:45] uh we'd like to read uh two scriptures
[1:09:47] this morning. Uh one found in Romans the
[1:09:52] 8th chapter and the 11th verse. This one
[1:09:55] I know that uh we all know by heart.
[1:10:00] It's probably quoted uh very very very
[1:10:05] uh often amongst us. And that is Romans
[1:10:10] 8:11 says, "But if the spirit of him
[1:10:15] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:10:19] in you, he that raised up Christ from
[1:10:23] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:10:27] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:10:32] you." Amen. And let's turn over to the
[1:10:36] uh St. John the gospel of St. John the
[1:10:40] 10th chapter and starting with the 15th
[1:10:43] verse and we'll read from there if we
[1:10:48] can and um um it's and it says in 10 and
[1:10:57] 15 it says as the father knoweth me even
[1:11:03] so know I the
[1:11:05] father and I lay down my life for the
[1:11:11] sheep and other sheep I have which are
[1:11:16] not of this
[1:11:19] fold. Them also I must bring and they
[1:11:23] shall hear my voice and there shall be
[1:11:28] onefold and one shepherd. Therefore doth
[1:11:32] my father love me because I lay down my
[1:11:37] life that I might
[1:11:39] take it again. No man taketh it from me
[1:11:45] but I lay it down of myself and I have
[1:11:50] power to lay it down and I have power to
[1:11:55] take it again. This commandment have I
[1:11:58] received of my father. Heavenly Father,
[1:12:02] we ask you to bless your word to us this
[1:12:05] morning. In the precious name of our
[1:12:07] Lord and Savior, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:10] God bless you this
[1:12:16] morning. I'd like to just uh uh if I
[1:12:21] would give it a title, I'd like to call
[1:12:24] it Easter power. Easter power and uh we
[1:12:30] know that the resurrection is
[1:12:34] the you know the most uh it is it just
[1:12:39] to a Christian it's it's just the most
[1:12:43] wonderful event
[1:12:45] uh that transpired within
[1:12:49] Christianity and I I just like just to
[1:12:52] think for a moment uh just look at the
[1:12:56] ministry of of our Lord and Saviors. He
[1:13:00] came on the earth and and
[1:13:03] uh you know his mother knew something
[1:13:06] was special and and and and Joseph knew
[1:13:10] he had the dream and and they they
[1:13:13] didn't know maybe Elizabeth and and
[1:13:17] doctors knew because of the life that
[1:13:20] that leapt in in John and and yet John
[1:13:24] was out preaching that there was one
[1:13:26] coming. But relatively Jesus was totally
[1:13:31] unknown. He was just a carpenter's son
[1:13:34] uh living in uh Nazareth up there which
[1:13:38] really was not it was kind of up in the
[1:13:41] mountains. It wasn't a real prosperous
[1:13:44] place. It it it wasn't known for
[1:13:49] anything spectacular. In fact, they
[1:13:51] would say, "Could any good thing even
[1:13:54] come out of this place?"
[1:13:56] um you know so uh that that was just a
[1:14:01] trend. He was totally unknown. But then
[1:14:03] there was a wedding feast and and he
[1:14:06] changed water into wine. And yet not
[1:14:09] many knew that. But slowly as he began
[1:14:13] to go out and he began to preach the
[1:14:16] gospel and he be to do signs and wonders
[1:14:20] and and things begin to
[1:14:23] transpire and and and so many things uh
[1:14:27] came to pass. I like how the prophet
[1:14:29] explained he says, "But all those days
[1:14:31] and all the things that Jesus did and
[1:14:35] certainly appreciate all the vindication
[1:14:38] of God's word and what he what did to
[1:14:43] fulfill it, the healing of the sick, the
[1:14:45] raising of the dead, casting out of
[1:14:48] devils, preaching the gospel the to the
[1:14:51] poor, fulfilling every word of God that
[1:14:55] would that would do when he came and
[1:14:59] suffered for our sins. Now, I want you
[1:15:02] to picture here's this great
[1:15:05] ministry and everybody began to have
[1:15:08] hope. Everybody was interpreting it a
[1:15:11] different way. Oh, we thought that he
[1:15:14] would deliver us from the Romans
[1:15:17] and we thought he would do this. There
[1:15:19] was there was a a a power. There was a
[1:15:22] stir. And yet the religious leaders of
[1:15:25] that time, they were totally opposed to
[1:15:28] his ministry. They fought him in every
[1:15:31] way. They were trying to hold them in
[1:15:34] the
[1:15:36] traditions of the way that they were
[1:15:38] taught and the way they were raised. And
[1:15:41] they wanted to keep them under the
[1:15:43] bondage of the law. And and they had
[1:15:46] political motives. They didn't want to
[1:15:48] stir up the Romans. They didn't want to
[1:15:51] cause anything. But Jesus brought a
[1:15:53] great hope. He brought a great light.
[1:15:56] There was a light shining in their
[1:15:58] lives, shining in their midst. Something
[1:16:01] that they've never seen before. The the
[1:16:04] words that he spoke were things that
[1:16:07] they had lost hope in. They they he was
[1:16:11] stirring up something within them uh
[1:16:14] that that gave them uh great
[1:16:18] anticipation.
[1:16:20] In
[1:16:21] fact, they marvel that one that was born
[1:16:24] blind received their sight.
[1:16:27] Just think of the possibilities that
[1:16:30] begin to race in the people's
[1:16:33] mind, not only for themselves but for
[1:16:37] Israel that one with such power was in
[1:16:41] their
[1:16:42] midst. Uh what could he do? Oh, this
[1:16:46] they thought this must be the king that
[1:16:48] is going to rise up and and deliver
[1:16:51] Israel uh restore the kingdom of Solomon
[1:16:55] to its glory. And and they were they
[1:16:58] were so
[1:17:01] uh filled with
[1:17:04] uh I don't I don't know the word I want
[1:17:07] to use. I don't want to use imagination,
[1:17:09] but a lot of it was imagination.
[1:17:13] just imagining the
[1:17:15] possibilities what he could
[1:17:18] do. And I want you to picture this. The
[1:17:22] revival was on. Crowds were
[1:17:26] gathering. Massive crowds were
[1:17:29] gathering. In fact, he finally came into
[1:17:33] uh Jerusalem and the people were taking
[1:17:37] palm leaves and and screaming, "Hosana,
[1:17:40] King of the Jews." you know, glory to
[1:17:43] God. The revival was on, the victory was
[1:17:47] going, and I I just thinking about and
[1:17:53] all of a sudden there he
[1:17:55] was and all their
[1:17:58] anticipation, all their dreams, all
[1:18:01] their hopes, all that they thought. And
[1:18:04] in an
[1:18:06] instant, the mighty political power
[1:18:12] of
[1:18:13] Rome stepped
[1:18:16] in a and what they were all under
[1:18:20] bondage to what they all were subject to
[1:18:25] the taxes the laws soldiers walking up
[1:18:29] and down their streets uh the burdens
[1:18:33] they were all under. All of a sudden,
[1:18:36] that great power uh rose up, the great
[1:18:40] Roman power rose up and seemingly took
[1:18:45] what what they saw as a great hope and
[1:18:48] just crushed
[1:18:51] it and crucified it and punished it by
[1:18:56] capital punishment like they did anybody
[1:18:59] else. just put him on the
[1:19:03] cross and there he
[1:19:06] died. And they sat back and thought,
[1:19:08] "Well, all these
[1:19:10] miracles, it didn't amount to
[1:19:14] anything. All the people that got
[1:19:17] well, they're just going to get sick
[1:19:19] again and die."
[1:19:21] So every anticipation, every hope, every
[1:19:26] desire that they were looking for all of
[1:19:29] a sudden seemed to be
[1:19:32] crushed. Could you
[1:19:35] imagine what that Friday night was like
[1:19:38] for his followers?
[1:19:42] How about the
[1:19:46] Saturday when they
[1:19:48] thought, "What's going to happen to
[1:19:51] us?" You know, are they going to hunt us
[1:19:54] down? Are are they going to are are they
[1:19:59] are they going to wipe us all
[1:20:01] out? Uh can you imagine the fear? Can
[1:20:07] you imagine the
[1:20:08] disappointment? We we see that in the
[1:20:11] story on the road to Emmas when when
[1:20:15] they were walking along and the stranger
[1:20:18] approached him and he says what what are
[1:20:21] you guys talking about? What are what's
[1:20:23] why are you so broken?
[1:20:25] Oh, haven't you heard? We thought this
[1:20:28] was he that would deliver
[1:20:31] Israel. Their disappointment was was so
[1:20:36] heavy upon them and
[1:20:40] and it it it was he he was a
[1:20:45] failed thing to them. The ministry of
[1:20:50] the Lord Jesus was a failed man. It just
[1:20:54] failed. It it it was subject to death.
[1:20:58] It was subject to the the same powers
[1:21:01] that everybody else was subject to. It
[1:21:04] was subject to the political powers. It
[1:21:07] was subject to Rome. And and when Rome
[1:21:10] decided they had enough of it, they
[1:21:12] could just step in and just clutch it
[1:21:15] away and put it on a
[1:21:18] cross and put it in a tomb and it was
[1:21:22] over. Now think of it. If you sat under
[1:21:26] that ministry, where would you go from
[1:21:32] there? We know. Just
[1:21:37] imagine where what
[1:21:41] now? We left our
[1:21:44] families. You You know what I mean? We
[1:21:46] left our jobs. We we testified to all of
[1:21:50] our neighbors. uh we identified
[1:21:52] ourselves with this ministry. We walked
[1:21:55] with it. We followed it. We called
[1:21:58] people to it. We we we testified of it.
[1:22:02] The the the shepherds had testified
[1:22:05] years earlier. And and now the the
[1:22:08] leopards had testified. The a man that
[1:22:11] was full of demons testified. And all of
[1:22:13] a sudden, all the
[1:22:16] reproach of all the
[1:22:19] ministry was all on
[1:22:23] them. People looked at them like, you
[1:22:26] know, you
[1:22:27] fool. You got taken for a ride. You got
[1:22:32] deceived. Just one more deception. Uh
[1:22:36] one one more fallacy. You you you you
[1:22:39] got all caught up. We told you the law
[1:22:41] was right. All the priests, we told you
[1:22:44] that Moses was was the thing cuz they
[1:22:47] all went to the synagogue on
[1:22:50] Saturdays. Oh, I imagine the sermons
[1:22:53] that Saturday read like, "Oh, we finally
[1:22:56] got rid of that
[1:22:59] heretic. We told you this was not true.
[1:23:03] We told you it was contrary to the law.
[1:23:06] We we told you that that God was going
[1:23:10] to do this and God was going to do that.
[1:23:13] Could you imagine sitting
[1:23:18] there, the
[1:23:21] disappointment, the the total
[1:23:24] wonderment, the the total
[1:23:29] loss? And how how are you going
[1:23:35] to
[1:23:37] justify any of it?
[1:23:42] But that's what's so
[1:23:44] beautiful about the
[1:23:46] power of
[1:23:49] Easter
[1:23:51] because that
[1:23:54] moment Easter
[1:23:57] proved beyond a shadow of a
[1:24:00] doubt Easter the
[1:24:04] resurrection. He
[1:24:06] sealed everything that he promised. It
[1:24:10] sealed all the teaching, everything that
[1:24:14] he said, everything that he taught about
[1:24:18] turning the other cheek, about going the
[1:24:20] extra mile. You talk all the teachings
[1:24:23] that he taught, all the things that that
[1:24:26] he taught them to be, how he taught them
[1:24:29] to act, you know, compelling them. If
[1:24:31] someone gives you ask for your cloak,
[1:24:33] give them your cloak also. You know,
[1:24:36] don't lend that you might borrow again.
[1:24:38] The words that they heard, the things
[1:24:40] that stirred their hearts, all they they
[1:24:43] meant
[1:24:45] nothing. They were put to an end. They
[1:24:49] couldn't go forward on them. They
[1:24:52] couldn't trust
[1:24:53] them. H how how do you how do you know
[1:24:57] that this is the way to walk? How do you
[1:25:00] know this is the way to think? How do
[1:25:03] you know this is the way to act? What do
[1:25:06] you
[1:25:07] have as
[1:25:09] evidence? What do you have as
[1:25:12] proof? In other words, it it was just
[1:25:16] nothing but an a philosophy.
[1:25:19] But
[1:25:20] oh, when all of a
[1:25:23] sudden he which was
[1:25:26] dead liveth,
[1:25:29] and not just live for a season, live
[1:25:31] forever more.
[1:25:35] Oh, that sealed
[1:25:38] it. That that put the that sealed
[1:25:42] everything that he
[1:25:44] taught. Made it
[1:25:46] true. Not only made it true, but made it
[1:25:50] attainable.
[1:25:54] There was a power. He said, "I have
[1:25:57] power to lay my life down. no man taketh
[1:26:02] from me. I have power to lay it down and
[1:26:07] power to take it up. You know, even
[1:26:10] remember on the road to Emmas, he began
[1:26:14] to
[1:26:16] he chastised
[1:26:19] them. He spoke these
[1:26:22] words. He told them, "Nobody's going to
[1:26:25] take my life from me. I have power to
[1:26:29] lay it down.
[1:26:30] that went right over their
[1:26:33] head. Right over their
[1:26:36] head because they weren't in the
[1:26:40] spirit. They weren't even in the spirit
[1:26:42] of the age. They weren't in the spirit
[1:26:45] of what was transpiring. They weren't in
[1:26:48] the spirit of what that he came for. The
[1:26:51] scriptures told it and spoke it that
[1:26:53] that he he the chastisement of his peace
[1:26:56] would be laid upon him. All all the
[1:26:58] prophecies concerning him he was
[1:27:01] fulfilling one after another. But man
[1:27:04] had become so disconnected from the
[1:27:07] power of God. They become so
[1:27:09] disconnected from the promises in the
[1:27:12] scripture. They they became so
[1:27:14] disconnected that they couldn't even
[1:27:17] identify the Lord Jesus in the
[1:27:19] fulfillment of the word of God that he
[1:27:22] was fulfilling every day.
[1:27:28] everything that was spoken of
[1:27:30] them. He told them, "Search the
[1:27:35] scriptures in them. You think you've got
[1:27:38] life." In other words, you think you can
[1:27:40] follow it your way by your
[1:27:44] interpretation and make it, but they are
[1:27:48] which testify of me, the Lord Jesus
[1:27:51] said.
[1:27:54] So, the scriptures weren't talking about
[1:27:56] what you thought they were talking
[1:27:58] about. They were talking about me.
[1:28:02] Every promise of the redeemer, every
[1:28:05] promise of the deliverer, every promise
[1:28:08] of the kingdom, everything that was
[1:28:10] written in the Old Testament was
[1:28:13] fulfilled in him.
[1:28:17] And yet, they missed it.
[1:28:20] I'm so glad that he didn't judge me for
[1:28:24] that. But he bore that
[1:28:27] judgment upon
[1:28:29] himself. Just just think of it. It it it
[1:28:34] it
[1:28:37] absolutely
[1:28:38] proved and
[1:28:41] sealed that what he said was true.
[1:28:45] You know, like if
[1:28:48] you you know, we call it, you know,
[1:28:52] in you know, uh in business or
[1:28:55] something, you say it sealed the
[1:28:58] deal. You know, maybe you're buying a
[1:29:01] truck and and the guy says, "Well, I'll
[1:29:04] tell you what I'll do. I'll I'll throw
[1:29:06] in some oil
[1:29:09] changes and uh and you're still
[1:29:12] hesitant." And and so he finally says,
[1:29:14] "How about if I put a
[1:29:18] a couple of these really nice mirrors on
[1:29:21] the truck?" And now you look at it and
[1:29:23] you say, "Oh, okay. That seals the
[1:29:26] deal."
[1:29:28] That's the thing that that
[1:29:32] that caused me to go ahead and and and
[1:29:36] and make that next step because it it
[1:29:40] sealed the deal, you know? Or they're
[1:29:42] explaining what something will do and
[1:29:44] and that's fine. I don't need that. I
[1:29:47] don't need that. You know what I mean?
[1:29:49] And then then they just hit that one
[1:29:53] that one item that that one thing that
[1:29:56] this does. You know what I mean? And
[1:29:59] boy, and when you hear that, you think,
[1:30:02] well, that that seals the deal.
[1:30:05] That that that seals it. Well, the
[1:30:09] Easter, the power of Easter
[1:30:15] sealed the word of God.
[1:30:18] It proved it. It proved that everything
[1:30:22] that was spoken in it was true.
[1:30:28] Yes, it was
[1:30:29] fantastic that
[1:30:31] people were healed.
[1:30:36] I liken the the Ten Commandments.
[1:30:39] uh uh and I I know you've all seen it
[1:30:42] and it it's wonderfully done, but you
[1:30:46] know the ri river turns to blood and and
[1:30:50] old pharaoh he says, "Oh, that's because
[1:30:52] the
[1:30:54] the lime or something stone got in the
[1:30:58] river and it turned it red." He had an
[1:31:00] excuse for that. And then, you know, he
[1:31:03] said, "And that caused the frogs to come
[1:31:06] out of the water." He had an excuse for
[1:31:08] that. Then the frogs died and that
[1:31:10] caused the flies. And he had an excuse
[1:31:13] for everything.
[1:31:17] But what sealed the deal, hallelujah,
[1:31:20] was when that angel of death showed up
[1:31:23] and Moses said, "The
[1:31:25] firstborn of all of Egypt will die this
[1:31:29] night."
[1:31:32] No matter what they did, the first cow
[1:31:36] born cow, the firstborn calf, the
[1:31:39] firstborn dog, the firstborn cat,
[1:31:42] firstborn mouse, the firstborn
[1:31:44] cockroach, I don't care what it
[1:31:48] was. You know, God said, "Let my people
[1:31:51] go." And Moses kept trying this and he
[1:31:54] kept trying that and he kept trying
[1:31:56] this. But finally, there was something
[1:31:59] that was going to seal the deal.
[1:32:03] And when that angel of death walked
[1:32:05] through there, that sealed the deal.
[1:32:10] It
[1:32:12] proved. And I I love that part. I'm
[1:32:15] sorry. I referred to a film,
[1:32:18] but when Moses when Pharaoh's sitting up
[1:32:22] on that throne and he finally looks over
[1:32:25] and he says, "Well, Moses's God is God.
[1:32:33] Why? It settled
[1:32:36] it. It settled
[1:32:39] it. And it ought to settle it for every
[1:32:45] believer. That's our hope.
[1:32:49] That That's what we're That's what we're
[1:32:51] we're trusting in. That's what that
[1:32:55] that's everything that that we believe
[1:32:58] is is that it it sealed the word. It
[1:33:02] proved it the
[1:33:08] truth. What sealed it was is that
[1:33:12] one
[1:33:14] that can say something.
[1:33:17] All the things that Jesus
[1:33:21] taught, all the things that he did, then
[1:33:25] he proved
[1:33:26] it. A lot of people can say a lot of
[1:33:30] things. Uh I I like that quote from uh
[1:33:36] Finny that David uh read Wednesday
[1:33:40] night.
[1:33:41] They they uh so they asked Finny if he
[1:33:45] wanted to be prayed for. And he said,
[1:33:48] "I'm certainly a
[1:33:49] sinner and I need your prayer." He said,
[1:33:53] "But why would I have you pray for me?
[1:33:56] You've been praying for the same things
[1:33:58] over and over again for years and
[1:34:01] nothing ever happens.
[1:34:05] So God isn't
[1:34:07] hearing your prayers.
[1:34:10] So why should I ask you to pray when
[1:34:14] God's not hearing your
[1:34:20] prayers? So there's got to be some
[1:34:26] effect. So this
[1:34:31] resurrection that to be
[1:34:37] effectual, you understand? So he proved
[1:34:40] that what he said was
[1:34:43] true. He proved that that what he said
[1:34:47] that he could lay his life down and take
[1:34:49] it up again. That was true.
[1:34:54] He
[1:34:56] he everything he
[1:34:59] taught he proved by
[1:35:04] resurrecting that he had the power that
[1:35:08] he claimed he
[1:35:11] had. But that wouldn't have done
[1:35:13] anything for us.
[1:35:18] Is that right?
[1:35:20] We know that was for him.
[1:35:24] He he he knew that that he
[1:35:28] uh we knew that he rose from the
[1:35:32] dead. But that what made it
[1:35:37] effectual was when he told us that we
[1:35:40] have
[1:35:41] access to the same spirit that raised
[1:35:46] him from the dead.
[1:35:52] It isn't he raised from the dead. That
[1:35:56] is not the power of Easter.
[1:36:00] He had that power.
[1:36:03] That wasn't That's not why we rejoice.
[1:36:07] That's not why we're glad for the
[1:36:09] resurrection. That would be just like
[1:36:11] worshiping Buddha.
[1:36:14] That's right.
[1:36:16] But that's not what our hope was. That's
[1:36:19] not what the resurrection means to us as
[1:36:23] Christians. That's not the power of
[1:36:26] Easter.
[1:36:28] The power of Easter was that he gave us
[1:36:32] access
[1:36:36] to that same spirit
[1:36:39] that quickened him.
[1:36:43] Just think of it. He had just died on
[1:36:49] Calvary. He went and preached to the
[1:36:51] souls that was in
[1:36:54] prison. Then he goes and he goes to the
[1:36:58] father and says, "Father, I've paid the
[1:37:02] price. I've laid my life down. I've
[1:37:05] taken their sins. I've thrown them in
[1:37:08] the sea of forgetfulness. As many as
[1:37:11] believed on me, all that you have given
[1:37:13] me will
[1:37:15] come. Now, Father, I pray for one thing,
[1:37:19] that they may be one as we might be one.
[1:37:22] That the same spirit that dwells in me
[1:37:26] might dwell in them. That's why Easter
[1:37:30] is so beautiful to us. That's why this
[1:37:33] day that we represent on a calendar
[1:37:36] means so much to us because we have
[1:37:40] access
[1:37:43] through
[1:37:47] Calvary to the same
[1:37:52] spirit that quickened his mortal body.
[1:37:56] And we can have that same
[1:37:59] spirit in
[1:38:01] us. That's what the church is get
[1:38:04] getting so far away from.
[1:38:12] I'm going to try not to be long this
[1:38:14] morning, but it he
[1:38:19] he paid the
[1:38:23] price. We couldn't pay the
[1:38:26] price. There's not enough righteousness
[1:38:28] in
[1:38:30] us. It's like paying a debt with stolen
[1:38:36] money. I had a guy do that to me one
[1:38:41] time. He sold one brother a piece of
[1:38:44] property out in the middle of nowhere
[1:38:46] that wasn't no good for nothing. Took
[1:38:48] that money and came and paid me some for
[1:38:51] something that he owed me for.
[1:38:56] I probably ought to pay that brother
[1:38:57] back. I don't know how much he took him
[1:38:59] for, but I think if I can remember who
[1:39:02] it is, I think I
[1:39:05] will.
[1:39:06] It what? That doesn't get Don't you see
[1:39:10] that just
[1:39:11] perpetuates? It just perpetuates sin. It
[1:39:15] just perpetuates. In other words, if
[1:39:18] we're born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
[1:39:20] come into the world, speaking lies, what
[1:39:22] are we going to continue to do? We're
[1:39:25] going to continue to
[1:39:28] lie. We have no We have no way
[1:39:33] out. The human being has no way out.
[1:39:38] You can't just take this
[1:39:41] Bible and decide that you're going to
[1:39:44] read this
[1:39:46] Bible and through your own mind get some
[1:39:50] sort of
[1:39:52] righteousness that's going to save
[1:39:56] you or that there's some sort of
[1:40:00] secrets in
[1:40:01] there. some sort of
[1:40:05] accumulation of facts and putting them
[1:40:08] in the right order that you now can
[1:40:12] present a life that's
[1:40:16] worthy. You can't do
[1:40:18] it. A liar is going to create lies
[1:40:23] because it's his nature to do it. You
[1:40:27] will lie to yourself.
[1:40:32] I lie every morning when I look in the
[1:40:34] mirror. You're not that
[1:40:38] ugly. Your nose isn't that
[1:40:41] big. You could probably grow the hair
[1:40:44] back if you wanted
[1:40:45] to. Any kind of lie that you tell
[1:40:49] yourself, it's human
[1:40:52] nature. It's what we
[1:40:54] are. We have unbelief.
[1:40:57] We have limits that we set on what we
[1:41:01] believe can be
[1:41:03] done. There was no way out for us. But
[1:41:08] there was a
[1:41:09] power in Easter.
[1:41:12] There was an Easter power. Jesus says,
[1:41:15] "I have power to take it up again." That
[1:41:19] was the Easter power. That was the power
[1:41:22] that he could lay down his life. We
[1:41:25] could lay down our lives.
[1:41:29] We got half of the formula.
[1:41:33] But he was the only one that possessed
[1:41:36] the other half. I have the power to take
[1:41:40] it up. I have the Easter power, the
[1:41:44] resurrection power that I can lay my
[1:41:47] life down and I can take it up again.
[1:41:54] and I paid the
[1:41:56] price. Easter would not be what it is
[1:42:00] this morning if he did not share that
[1:42:05] power with
[1:42:11] us. That's why he told them when they
[1:42:15] saw him go away, can you imagine their
[1:42:18] hearts
[1:42:20] again? Here he
[1:42:22] rose. Oh, they're all
[1:42:26] vindicated. They're all happy again. And
[1:42:29] then he takes them up and he
[1:42:33] leaves. But what did he tell him? I'll
[1:42:37] not leave you nor forsake
[1:42:41] you, but I'll be with you even in you
[1:42:44] until the end. You go
[1:42:49] wait until you're endued with power from
[1:42:53] on
[1:42:55] high. You go
[1:42:57] wait. You
[1:43:01] tar
[1:43:02] until the Easter
[1:43:06] power
[1:43:07] comes and fills you.
[1:43:12] And there they were up
[1:43:14] there and the Easter
[1:43:18] power filled
[1:43:20] them. He shared with
[1:43:25] them. Look what he did. He shared the
[1:43:29] power that raised him from the dead. The
[1:43:33] spirit that raised him from the dead. He
[1:43:37] shared that. What was that spirit?
[1:43:40] There's only one form of eternal
[1:43:44] life and that's
[1:43:48] God. There's only one
[1:43:51] power that has the power over life and
[1:43:57] death. Men can
[1:44:00] die. Doctors can do all that they can
[1:44:03] do. Medicine can do great things. But
[1:44:06] death has always been the final ultimate
[1:44:10] of
[1:44:11] man. Nobody has ever been able to
[1:44:15] conquer death, hell, and the grave. But
[1:44:18] there was a
[1:44:22] power that Jesus
[1:44:27] possessed that God had given
[1:44:30] him. It was the resurrection power that
[1:44:35] he had to overcome death,
[1:44:39] hell and the grave.
[1:44:45] As far as man knew, the grave was the
[1:44:48] end of every
[1:44:52] man. He proved he was the resurrection
[1:44:55] and the life when the resurrection
[1:44:58] power, that's what he told Marth. He
[1:45:00] says, "I am the resurrection and the
[1:45:03] life. I have the power." That's why he
[1:45:08] could go there and say, "Lazareth, come
[1:45:13] forth." He showed right there. He was
[1:45:16] going to share that power with
[1:45:19] man. I believe it was Gyrus's daughter
[1:45:22] that passed away. And he went in and her
[1:45:27] Tabitha I think her name was and he
[1:45:29] called her back. Why? He was the
[1:45:32] resurrection and the life. The spirit
[1:45:36] that God put in
[1:45:39] him was the resurrection power. the
[1:45:42] Easter
[1:45:44] power to overcome
[1:45:47] sin, to overcome the
[1:45:50] grave, to overcome eternal separation
[1:45:54] from
[1:45:57] God. And when he
[1:46:01] rose, he proved
[1:46:04] it. He sealed it. He could have boasted
[1:46:08] about
[1:46:09] it and alls we would do is visit that
[1:46:13] tomb like it was a
[1:46:16] monument. But we don't visit that tomb.
[1:46:19] We can visit the man that was in that
[1:46:24] tomb. We don't have to know
[1:46:27] him in history.
[1:46:31] We can know him
[1:46:34] personally because
[1:46:37] he he
[1:46:39] rose so he could share that
[1:46:44] spirit, that
[1:46:46] power with the
[1:46:49] believer. That's why the letter
[1:46:53] kleth. But the spirit gives life.
[1:46:59] To to give life means to
[1:47:02] quicken. It means to to bring it to
[1:47:07] life. And Jesus actually could bring to
[1:47:11] us and quicken in us eternal
[1:47:18] life that we would never
[1:47:21] taste death.
[1:47:26] Not just the death of this body.
[1:47:30] total
[1:47:35] death. He had that
[1:47:38] power. And that's what the word
[1:47:42] does. You could look at the word. You
[1:47:45] could read it. But something has got to
[1:47:48] be able to come and quicken that word
[1:47:53] and make it alive in you.
[1:47:57] I I'll just read the statement because I
[1:47:59] think it's it it's so marvelous. See if
[1:48:03] I can find it here. He
[1:48:06] says,
[1:48:09] "Now, now is the spirit now is the
[1:48:14] spirit that
[1:48:16] quickens. It's not the word that
[1:48:18] quickens."
[1:48:22] So, I mean, man has got to where he
[1:48:24] thinks that within him, he's got some
[1:48:29] ability to go in here and read this and
[1:48:33] make it come
[1:48:36] alive. You know what? We got 900
[1:48:38] different
[1:48:39] denominations, 900 different ideas.
[1:48:43] Every time somebody does that and they
[1:48:45] start coming up with a little something,
[1:48:48] people start flocking to them. They they
[1:48:50] they start be getting rised up in glory.
[1:48:53] They start they get fame. They get a
[1:48:56] name. They they start doing
[1:49:00] something because it's not the word that
[1:49:03] quickens. It's the Easter power
[1:49:08] that quickens this
[1:49:10] word. You want this word to come alive
[1:49:13] in your life? Get the
[1:49:17] resurrection Easter
[1:49:19] power. Get the spirit. He told them, "Go
[1:49:24] wait until the spirit of truth
[1:49:27] comes. Go wait until you're endued with
[1:49:30] power from on high. Don't Don't just go
[1:49:35] and start reading the word.
[1:49:39] have an intellectual knowledge that
[1:49:41] there's a God and then start to try to
[1:49:44] perform and live a Christian
[1:49:49] life. You can fool yourself for
[1:49:54] years, but one day you'll meet that
[1:49:57] great Roman power.
[1:50:03] They just couldn't believe. Why didn't
[1:50:04] Jesus just slay him?
[1:50:08] You know why? Because he laid down his
[1:50:11] life for his sheep. The father loves me
[1:50:15] because I lay my life down for my sheep.
[1:50:18] Why didn't he slay that Rome?
[1:50:21] So you can have the power in your life
[1:50:25] to slay your Rome, to slay your Goliath,
[1:50:29] to bring your flesh under subjection, to
[1:50:32] to get rid of all the demons that are in
[1:50:34] your mind. He gave he he gave he sent
[1:50:38] his spirit. The spirit that raised him
[1:50:41] from the
[1:50:45] dead. The power that God put within him
[1:50:49] to lay his life down and to take it up
[1:50:52] again. That power, he was going to share
[1:50:56] it. He was going to give
[1:50:59] it to all that believed in him. He was
[1:51:03] going to give them power to be the sons
[1:51:05] of God. Don't take an intellectual
[1:51:11] or your own way of doing things when you
[1:51:15] have the Easter power that's here for
[1:51:18] you as a free gift.
[1:51:26] You would think that every one of us
[1:51:27] would be so full of the desire to have
[1:51:33] it to sacrifice everything. Jesus says,
[1:51:38] "What would a man give for his
[1:51:44] soul? Eternal
[1:51:47] life. That's
[1:51:49] what the Easter power is. It's eternal
[1:51:54] life. That's what the Holy Spirit is.
[1:51:57] The Holy Spirit is the spirit of God.
[1:52:00] It's the power of
[1:52:03] Easter coming in your life, giving you
[1:52:07] power over death, hell, and the
[1:52:11] grave. And it's free because it's been
[1:52:15] paid
[1:52:16] for. It it it so so we know that it
[1:52:20] takes this spirit
[1:52:22] to quicken the word. It took this power.
[1:52:27] So God gave Jesus that
[1:52:31] power to lay down his life and take it
[1:52:34] up
[1:52:36] again. And he didn't keep it for
[1:52:40] himself. He didn't have to go to
[1:52:45] Calvary. He didn't do nothing wrong.
[1:52:50] He said, ' Which amongst you can find
[1:52:52] any sin in
[1:52:53] me? Show me where I broke the law. Show
[1:52:56] me where I've done anything. Show me
[1:52:58] where I
[1:53:00] blasphemed. I've I've proven to you
[1:53:04] everything that I've said. They tried to
[1:53:08] trick him with coins. They tried to
[1:53:09] trick him with this, trick him with
[1:53:11] that. He just kept the line. He stayed
[1:53:14] right there. Why did he go to Calvary?
[1:53:19] He laid his life down for a sheep that
[1:53:21] he could take the life that was in him
[1:53:25] and share it with you. I I thought this
[1:53:29] statement was astounding. So, if you
[1:53:32] don't mind, I'd like to to read this.
[1:53:38] He said, "This is a bad word to use, and
[1:53:41] I
[1:53:44] hope I I and
[1:53:48] I and I hope you take it right before a
[1:53:53] crowd." But he was predestinated by the
[1:53:55] fornowledge of God. how God plan was to
[1:54:00] be that he would send a redeemer and
[1:54:04] this redeemer could only be his son. So
[1:54:08] then that was God's
[1:54:11] promise all the way from the garden of
[1:54:14] Eden that Jesus would be here. Here he
[1:54:19] was a man born of a virgin, but it taken
[1:54:26] the spirit of God to quicken that word
[1:54:31] in him.
[1:54:39] It took the spirit of
[1:54:43] God to make all that word alive in
[1:54:49] him. They asked him, "Can you be
[1:54:51] baptized with the baptism I'm baptized?"
[1:54:54] And he says, "You can and you will."
[1:54:59] The same
[1:55:01] spirit. If the same spirit that dwelt in
[1:55:05] the Christ, our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:55:07] Christ, dwell in you, it will also
[1:55:11] quicken your mortal bodies. Why will we
[1:55:14] settle for anything less than the spirit
[1:55:18] of
[1:55:19] God? We ought to hunger for it. We ought
[1:55:23] to thirst for it. We want it's ours to
[1:55:26] possess. It's a free gift. It's been
[1:55:28] freely given. We should want to share
[1:55:34] it. But we fall into the same mental
[1:55:40] trap of thinking that we can make the
[1:55:44] word come alive. We cannot make the word
[1:55:47] come alive without his
[1:55:51] spirit. We can't earn his spirit.
[1:55:56] We can't call it
[1:55:59] down. Alls we can do is humble
[1:56:04] ourselves, surrender ourselves, and
[1:56:13] ask. How often do you need to be led? I
[1:56:16] need to be led every
[1:56:19] day. Every day, we've got to humble
[1:56:22] ourselves. Every day we've got to ask
[1:56:25] for that spirit to lead us and guide us
[1:56:28] in all truth and righteousness. Every
[1:56:31] day we've got to ask that spirit, this
[1:56:34] the Easter power to come and make this
[1:56:38] word alive, not only to our minds, but
[1:56:42] alive in our lives. Every day we got to
[1:56:46] ask for this Easter power, this power
[1:56:49] that's been given to the church. The
[1:56:51] power that's to lead this church. The
[1:56:54] power that changes lives. The power that
[1:56:57] protects you and keeps you from all evil
[1:57:00] and all sin and unrighteousness. Every
[1:57:03] day you've got to get in contact with
[1:57:06] that earthly wonderful
[1:57:10] supernatural Easter power.
[1:57:15] You say, "What do you mean earthly?" I
[1:57:16] mean it's here
[1:57:19] in you.
[1:57:23] It's in you. He put it in you. He who is
[1:57:27] in you is greater than he's in the
[1:57:33] world. But you know it's it it's the
[1:57:37] pearl of great price.
[1:57:42] If
[1:57:43] and we don't want
[1:57:46] to
[1:57:47] exchange creed and dogma and intellect
[1:57:52] for the fountain of life and of his holy
[1:57:57] spirit. It's something that is
[1:58:03] there if we seek
[1:58:05] it and ask for
[1:58:08] it. But I thought that was a tremendous
[1:58:10] thing. He's but he still
[1:58:13] needed the spirit of God to quicken that
[1:58:18] word in him.
[1:58:21] Jesus
[1:58:23] was the mystery of God
[1:58:27] revealed how a man could have the spirit
[1:58:32] of God come in and quicken in him to
[1:58:37] fulfill every word of God.
[1:58:43] That that is the beauty of it that there
[1:58:48] is a Easter
[1:58:50] power that's here for every believer.
[1:58:53] Don't look backwards.
[1:58:57] You can't
[1:58:59] undo yesterday.
[1:59:01] But he can undo the effects.
[1:59:04] He can undo the results of your
[1:59:07] decisions. He can undo every trap that
[1:59:10] Satan set for you. He can undo. He's got
[1:59:13] power to overcome
[1:59:16] everything. That's what he proved.
[1:59:20] I have power.
[1:59:23] I have the Easter power. I have it. It
[1:59:28] dwells in me. I am the Easter power. I
[1:59:31] am the resurrection. I am the way, the
[1:59:34] truth, the life. No man cometh unto the
[1:59:37] father but by me.
[1:59:42] I'm it.
[1:59:45] And I am going to share the spirit that
[1:59:49] is in me. The spirit of God that's in
[1:59:53] me. I'm going to give it to you.
[1:59:58] I'm going to give you access to it
[2:00:04] and it's going to change you
[2:00:08] and transform
[2:00:10] you into new creatures in Christ Jesus.
[2:00:17] You're not going to be in the gloom of
[2:00:18] this world and the doom of this world.
[2:00:22] With this spirit that I'm going to give
[2:00:24] you, you can sit in heavenly places in
[2:00:29] Christ
[2:00:33] Jesus.
[2:00:36] Oh, you should know if you have
[2:00:40] it. And if you know you've got it, you
[2:00:43] should be happy.
[2:00:50] You say, "Well, do you fail?" Yeah, I
[2:00:51] fail. But praise God, I got the
[2:00:56] seal. The flesh wars against the spirit
[2:00:58] and the spirit against the flesh. But he
[2:01:01] said, and the spirit quickened that to
[2:01:04] me that if he started a work in me,
[2:01:06] he'll finish it. He said that nothing
[2:01:10] could pluck me out of the palm of his
[2:01:13] hand. I couldn't pluck myself out of the
[2:01:17] palm of his hand. And I am nothing. So
[2:01:20] nothing can pluck me out of the palm of
[2:01:22] his
[2:01:23] hand. The spirit Yes sir. of Easter
[2:01:28] quickened that to me that that means me.
[2:01:33] Praise God.
[2:01:37] I have the life.
[2:01:42] You say, "Well, what about what you
[2:01:44] are?" Praise God. I'm getting a new me.
[2:01:48] This body will be dissolved away. This
[2:01:51] temple of sin, this burden of the flesh
[2:01:55] and I've got a new body waiting for me
[2:01:58] that'll never taste death. That's the
[2:02:01] quickening power. That's the
[2:02:03] resurrection life. You know, it ought to
[2:02:05] put a smile on our face.
[2:02:09] But we we've got beat down
[2:02:14] thinking that we can perfect ourselves.
[2:02:19] you. We we we preach that our sisters
[2:02:23] should wear godly clothing, not wear
[2:02:26] high heels and not wear makeup and not
[2:02:29] wear jewelry and earrings and lipstick
[2:02:31] and and those long eyelashes that you
[2:02:35] know look like a fan sweeper or
[2:02:38] something like that. And and and tight
[2:02:42] dresses and all that stuff. We we preach
[2:02:46] all that.
[2:02:50] But I grew up a
[2:02:53] Catholic. I was around nuns that they
[2:02:56] dressed like they dressed like, you
[2:02:59] know, fulll long things and little
[2:03:02] bonnets on their head and, you know,
[2:03:05] walking around all the time acting like
[2:03:08] they're holy.
[2:03:11] You know, they were holy to me till they
[2:03:13] got a ruler in their hand, started
[2:03:14] beating me with it, and then then I
[2:03:17] didn't think too much of
[2:03:20] them. It it the it's not the outside.
[2:03:25] God works from the inside
[2:03:27] out. You get the
[2:03:30] power of Easter in you. It'll start
[2:03:34] conquering from the inside. It'll start
[2:03:38] pressing out the desires. It'll start
[2:03:41] changing your thinking. It'll start
[2:03:43] changing your desires. It'll start
[2:03:45] changing you. You start down a path,
[2:03:48] it'll convict you of sin.
[2:03:51] And now you can gain a confidence in it.
[2:03:54] You can let it lead you and guide you
[2:03:58] into all truth and righteousness. It
[2:04:01] ain't a magic wand.
[2:04:05] He'll change this
[2:04:07] body. But until then, he's given you
[2:04:11] power, Easter
[2:04:14] power to bring this body into
[2:04:20] subjection. Not by power, not by might,
[2:04:24] but by my spirit, saith the
[2:04:28] Lord. You say, "What is the baptism of
[2:04:31] the Holy Ghost?" It's Easter power
[2:04:33] coming into the
[2:04:36] believer. It's the power that he
[2:04:39] possessed. The spirit that was in him
[2:04:43] coming in
[2:04:45] you and it was purchased for
[2:04:50] you. Don't earn it. Ask for
[2:04:55] it. Don't earn it. Fast and pray if you
[2:04:59] need be.
[2:05:02] Read your Bible. Sit alone with God.
[2:05:05] Wait on him. Hear
[2:05:08] him. Listen to him until he speaks to
[2:05:12] your heart. Until you can walk out and
[2:05:15] say, "Thank you, Lord. I've settled
[2:05:24] it." Have you ever stumbled? Mother
[2:05:26] Mary, I've stumbled.
[2:05:30] But I know one thing, nothing can be be
[2:05:33] laid to the charge of God's elect
[2:05:35] because the seed of God remains in
[2:05:39] them. And if I fail, something in me
[2:05:43] says, "Aba,
[2:05:44] Father, forgive me, Lord. I'll make it
[2:05:47] right. Help me, lead me, and guide
[2:05:52] me." We're getting close to the end.
[2:05:56] Now is not the time to be
[2:05:59] without the Easter
[2:06:03] power. And and don't don't go to that
[2:06:06] negative thinking. Oh, I ain't got it.
[2:06:10] You ain't got it. Get
[2:06:15] it. You have not because you ask not.
[2:06:19] And you ask not because you don't
[2:06:22] believe it's real.
[2:06:24] It's
[2:06:27] real. It kept me from
[2:06:29] prison. It kept me from drug
[2:06:32] overdose. It kept me from a lot of
[2:06:35] things. The spirit of God did. It's our
[2:06:40] only
[2:06:41] hope. And it's yours.
[2:06:46] And I'd like just to close maybe with
[2:06:48] just this little
[2:06:51] thought because there's so there's so
[2:06:53] much in in the great word. But this
[2:06:57] great Easter
[2:06:59] power, what what it
[2:07:02] does is it it transforms a mortal
[2:07:07] man into being partakers of the
[2:07:10] supernatural.
[2:07:15] This Easter
[2:07:18] power allows you, a mortal man, to now
[2:07:24] partake in supernatural things. Things
[2:07:28] that happen above
[2:07:32] nature, beyond
[2:07:34] nature, beyond
[2:07:37] logic,
[2:07:39] beyond common sense.
[2:07:43] I get such a kick. Everything now is
[2:07:46] common sense. Common sense. I don't need
[2:07:48] common
[2:07:49] sense. I need Easter
[2:07:53] power. I need a power that'll take me
[2:07:55] beyond my
[2:07:57] senses, beyond my
[2:07:59] logic to believe that God can do things
[2:08:03] that's exceedingly and abundantly above
[2:08:07] what I can even ask or
[2:08:10] think. this great power that today we're
[2:08:15] celebrating the
[2:08:17] event. I don't know if this is exactly
[2:08:20] the day or or what, but it's a time that
[2:08:24] Christianity sets aside and we say that
[2:08:28] our savior rose from the dead,
[2:08:33] that he
[2:08:35] demonstrated and proved and sealed his
[2:08:39] word that it was true because he proved
[2:08:43] what he was talking about. And that's
[2:08:46] the seal to me.
[2:08:49] And now this power that raised him from
[2:08:52] the dead, he's going to place it in us
[2:08:56] so it does the same
[2:08:59] thing for
[2:09:04] us. Aren't you glad you have
[2:09:07] it? Aren't you glad you can say, "Oh,
[2:09:11] death, where's your sting? Oh grave,
[2:09:13] where's your victory?
[2:09:15] I have eternal
[2:09:18] life. You just look what it did. It took
[2:09:21] no
[2:09:22] mortal
[2:09:25] men and turned them
[2:09:28] into
[2:09:29] partakers of the
[2:09:32] supernatural. We can have the
[2:09:34] supernatural in our lives
[2:09:38] by Easter
[2:09:41] power. Easter was the invitation
[2:09:45] for every believer to
[2:09:48] receive the
[2:09:50] supernatural. The works that you I do,
[2:09:54] you shall do
[2:09:55] also because I go unto the father and
[2:09:59] I'll send you another comforter. I will
[2:10:02] be with you even in you. The power that
[2:10:06] raised me up from the dead, I am going
[2:10:09] to place that power in you and it'll do
[2:10:12] the same for you.
[2:10:16] What's what's Christianity without the
[2:10:18] spirit of God? What's Christianity
[2:10:21] without the resurrection power? What's
[2:10:23] Christianity without Easter power? The
[2:10:26] power of Easter. It's just another
[2:10:30] religion. This message without brother
[2:10:33] Bram never
[2:10:35] built his
[2:10:38] ministry on intellectual teaching.
[2:10:42] He built it on power and demonstration
[2:10:44] of the Holy Spirit
[2:10:47] by re-impersonating the ministry of
[2:10:50] Jesus Christ in our day.
[2:10:53] The same yesterday, today, and
[2:10:56] forever. And it'll do the same for
[2:10:59] you. I love the story of sheep Mach and
[2:11:05] Abednego. You know, I love what they
[2:11:07] said to the
[2:11:09] king and they said, you know, Shadrach,
[2:11:12] Mach, this is in Daniel, the third
[2:11:15] chapter, Shadrach, Meshach, Nebgo
[2:11:18] answered and said to the king, "Oh
[2:11:22] Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
[2:11:24] answer thee in this matter.
[2:11:28] If it be so, our God whom we serve is
[2:11:33] able to deliver us from the burning
[2:11:37] furnace, and he will deliver us out of
[2:11:41] thy hand, O king.
[2:11:49] But if
[2:11:50] not, be it known unto thee, O king, that
[2:11:56] we will never serve thy gods, nor
[2:12:02] worship the golden image which thou hast
[2:12:05] set
[2:12:07] up. And you know the story. Oh
[2:12:09] Nebuchadnezzar, he gets
[2:12:12] angry. I mean, these guys, they say, "Oh
[2:12:14] king, live forever." I'll tell you what,
[2:12:16] our God can deliver us from your hand.
[2:12:18] In other words, my God is greater than
[2:12:21] you.
[2:12:23] And I will not back away from that
[2:12:26] testimony. And every single one of us
[2:12:29] should be able to say, "He who is in me,
[2:12:32] the Easter power in me is greater than
[2:12:35] you, Satan.
[2:12:38] And you may be in my flesh. You may be
[2:12:41] in my mind, but I know this power will
[2:12:45] deliver me from your grasp. And if I'm
[2:12:48] going through a financial season, if I'm
[2:12:51] going through a health season, if I'm
[2:12:53] going through this, that doesn't matter
[2:12:55] because my God is going to deliver me
[2:12:58] from your hand.
[2:13:03] In fact, you can look grave in the face.
[2:13:06] You can look death in the face and say,
[2:13:09] "This Easter power in me is going to
[2:13:11] deliver me from the hell death in the
[2:13:14] grave."
[2:13:17] It's settled.
[2:13:19] Take me if you want. Throw me in the
[2:13:21] furnace. And then you drop back over
[2:13:24] here and
[2:13:29] uh and the 24th verse it says or the
[2:13:34] 23rd verse and these three men Shadrach,
[2:13:38] Meshach, Abednego fell down bound into
[2:13:42] the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
[2:13:46] Then Nebuchadnezzar the
[2:13:48] king was
[2:13:50] astoned and rose up in
[2:13:53] haste and spoke and said unto his
[2:13:57] counselors, "Did not we cast three men
[2:14:00] bound into the midst of the fire?" And
[2:14:03] they answered and said unto the thing,
[2:14:05] "True, O king?" And he answered and
[2:14:08] said, "Lo, I see a fourth man loose
[2:14:12] walking in the midst of the fire, and
[2:14:15] they have and they have no hurt. And the
[2:14:20] form of the fourth man is like the son
[2:14:22] of God." Hallelujah.
[2:14:27] What was
[2:14:29] he? He was the resurrection power
[2:14:36] and he came and
[2:14:38] delivered Shadrach,
[2:14:42] Meack and
[2:14:44] Abednego. This this
[2:14:47] power was on
[2:14:51] Stephen. They were going to stone him.
[2:14:54] And he looked up and he said, "Behold
[2:14:57] the Son of God. Father, forgive them for
[2:15:01] they know not what they do. Just think
[2:15:03] of that
[2:15:05] power. We take it. We We only want it
[2:15:09] for carnal things.
[2:15:12] I want it that can take me from the man
[2:15:15] that I am, the failure that I am, all
[2:15:20] the things that are about me that are
[2:15:22] wrong and deliver me from
[2:15:27] myself. that can put the love of God in
[2:15:30] my heart and shed it abroad by the Holy
[2:15:33] Spirit telling all of us through the
[2:15:37] resurrection, through the baptism of the
[2:15:40] Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy
[2:15:43] Spirit, the sharing of the Easter power
[2:15:47] with his sons and daughters that we can
[2:15:50] overcome all things.
[2:15:53] I can do all things through Christ Jesus
[2:15:57] who strengthens me.
[2:16:01] Why pack the
[2:16:03] load? He already carried the
[2:16:08] cross. All things are possible. We must
[2:16:11] believe that God is and a rewarder of
[2:16:15] them that diligently seek him. You seek
[2:16:18] after this life.
[2:16:21] You make full proof of your ministry.
[2:16:24] You make full proof of your of your your
[2:16:28] commitment to him. You get down and you
[2:16:32] renew your commitment to him. You make
[2:16:35] things right. You repent right. You have
[2:16:38] that spirit of God renewed in you.
[2:16:40] You'll wake up so refreshed.
[2:16:45] If you have a
[2:16:47] burden, take it to the Lord in prayer.
[2:16:53] Let the power of
[2:16:56] Easter handle it for
[2:17:00] you. Let the power of
[2:17:03] Easter do for
[2:17:05] you exceedingly and abundantly above
[2:17:09] what you can ask or think. Let the power
[2:17:12] of Easter lead
[2:17:14] you. Let the power of Easter be your
[2:17:17] hope. Let the power of Easter be your
[2:17:20] strength. Let the power of Easter be
[2:17:23] your joy. It takes away all the
[2:17:27] gloom. It takes away all the doubt. You
[2:17:31] know you have something that's so
[2:17:32] valuable that it can never be taken
[2:17:34] away. You possess it and you can say,
[2:17:38] "Oh, if I die and the skin worms eat my
[2:17:43] flesh, yet will I see God.
[2:17:48] If the doctor comes in and says, "Son,
[2:17:51] you've only got a few more hours to
[2:17:53] live." You can look up and say, "Oh,
[2:17:56] doctor, it's not death to
[2:18:00] me. It's just a
[2:18:04] ticket. I'm leaving this old body behind
[2:18:08] because I'm walking in the power of
[2:18:10] Easter. The same spirit that was in him
[2:18:14] is in me. And it's going to quicken my
[2:18:17] mortal body, too. Oh, great doctor. I
[2:18:20] appreciate all you done. But when you've
[2:18:23] done all you can do, thank God, I have
[2:18:26] one more thing. The power of
[2:18:29] Easter. When it looks like it's all over
[2:18:32] and there's nothing else, praise God,
[2:18:35] there's one more thing, and it's the
[2:18:38] power of Easter.
[2:18:42] It the
[2:18:46] ultimate. It quickened
[2:18:50] Philillip actually took Philillip.
[2:18:52] Philillip was in one place and he was
[2:18:56] transported to another place by Easter
[2:19:00] power by the quickening
[2:19:04] power. the power of
[2:19:07] Easter to
[2:19:09] quicken to make alive the word in
[2:19:16] you. He carried out that word commission
[2:19:20] in Philillip and quickened him.
[2:19:23] Philillip now a mortal man partook of
[2:19:26] the
[2:19:28] supernatural by the
[2:19:30] power of Easter. And you tell me what's
[2:19:34] more supernatural than overcoming death,
[2:19:38] hell, and the
[2:19:40] grave. You can look at
[2:19:45] Peter. Silver and gold have I none, but
[2:19:49] what I
[2:19:50] have is the power of
[2:19:54] Easter. And it quickened my
[2:19:59] spirit because it brought me in
[2:20:01] remembrance of what he said. I have
[2:20:04] freely given to you freely
[2:20:07] give. Peter's there. The spirit comes
[2:20:10] upon him. Quickens to Peter that what
[2:20:14] you have, Peter, I've given you the
[2:20:16] power to
[2:20:18] give. You have power to bind. You have
[2:20:22] power to loose. The spirit of
[2:20:26] Easter made that come alive in
[2:20:30] Peter. Don't think Peter did
[2:20:33] that. It was the spirit of Easter that
[2:20:38] did it in Peter. And Peter said, "Silver
[2:20:41] and gold have I none." But what I've
[2:20:44] got, I got in the upper room when the
[2:20:47] spirit of Easter came on me. Now I have
[2:20:50] that spirit. Rise up and walk.
[2:20:53] Hallelujah.
[2:20:57] Our messenger told us, you have that
[2:21:00] same power in you.
[2:21:05] You believe him?
[2:21:09] Look at
[2:21:11] Paul on the road to
[2:21:15] Damascus. He's going to do away with
[2:21:17] them
[2:21:18] all. the
[2:21:21] heretics, all them that believe Jesus
[2:21:24] rose from the
[2:21:26] dead and all of a sudden he meets them
[2:21:30] face to
[2:21:33] face. Can you imagine that quickening
[2:21:37] power? Easter
[2:21:40] himself,
[2:21:44] Paul, why do you persecute
[2:21:47] me, man? He's got blinding light. He's
[2:21:50] laying on the ground blind as a
[2:21:54] bat. But he knows one
[2:21:56] thing. That quickening spirit is
[2:22:00] starting to bring that life. And he
[2:22:02] says, "Who art thou,
[2:22:04] Lord?" He said, "I'm
[2:22:07] Jesus. I am the
[2:22:09] resurrection. I am the Easter
[2:22:13] power. I am he that conquered death,
[2:22:16] hell, and the grave.
[2:22:18] I am he that has life eternal. I am the
[2:22:23] way, the truth. I am the way to the
[2:22:27] father. Paul, I'm going to show you a
[2:22:29] few things. Go to this certain place and
[2:22:34] have this great prophet Ananas lay hands
[2:22:38] on you that you might
[2:22:42] receive the Easter power. and then
[2:22:45] you'll be my
[2:22:47] witness throughout all the land. This
[2:22:51] morning, I believe we have the Easter
[2:22:53] power by promise. I just think we've got
[2:22:56] away from using it. And I can just say
[2:22:59] this, don't try to live without
[2:23:05] it. It's here for us.
[2:23:09] He went to Calvary and died and was
[2:23:13] beaten and his stripes were laid upon us
[2:23:17] that the chastisement of our peace. In
[2:23:21] other words, the suffering from all our
[2:23:23] sins that we could have peace that we
[2:23:26] could freely receive and freely give. He
[2:23:30] bore that in his body and by his stripes
[2:23:34] we were healed. that the supernatural
[2:23:37] Easter power could make you
[2:23:41] well. Let us rise up in
[2:23:44] faith. Let us make
[2:23:46] contact. Let's don't remain
[2:23:50] intellects. But ask God, Lord, take this
[2:23:56] word, the word that was given to us in
[2:23:59] this day, the word that quickens the
[2:24:02] life in me for the hour I'm living in.
[2:24:07] Lord, when I read, I want your
[2:24:11] spirit. I want your
[2:24:14] Easter to come and make this alive to
[2:24:18] me.
[2:24:21] I'm going to sit down and be
[2:24:23] still and I'm going to wait and I'm
[2:24:26] going to read and I'm going to
[2:24:29] listen until your spirit comes. I feel
[2:24:33] your presence making this word alive to
[2:24:37] me. Father, I'm going to sit and listen
[2:24:39] to the voice of God for the hour that I
[2:24:42] live in.
[2:24:44] Maybe you've led me to listen to this
[2:24:46] and maybe you've led me to listen to
[2:24:48] that. But I'm going to
[2:24:49] listen. I'm going to hear you, Lord. And
[2:24:53] I'm going to let that resurrection power
[2:24:55] quicken me. And I believe that I can go
[2:24:58] from the mortal to the
[2:25:01] immortal, from human to the
[2:25:04] supernatural, and I can see you
[2:25:07] alive because that's what Easter is.
[2:25:11] It's him
[2:25:12] alive in our midst
[2:25:15] today. The same yesterday, today, and
[2:25:19] forever. Here with us, present now to
[2:25:23] prove and to seal that every promise he
[2:25:29] made is true. Easter power was the seal
[2:25:35] on God's word that every promise in the
[2:25:39] book is mine.
[2:25:41] every chapter, every verse, every line.
[2:25:45] Rejoice this morning. There's a
[2:25:49] power for the
[2:25:51] church that will keep us. Not only will
[2:25:54] it keep us, but it'll transform us. This
[2:25:58] world's getting wicked, but the power is
[2:26:01] going to keep us. Nothing can pluck us
[2:26:04] out of the palm of his hand. God bless
[2:26:07] you this morning. Happy Easter power to
[2:26:10] you. Amen.
[2:26:20] Amen. Aren't you glad for the power this
[2:26:22] morning? Amen. Whatever we have need of,
[2:26:25] there's power made available that we can
[2:26:28] access this morning. Let's all stand.
[2:26:31] Amen. Amen. I don't know about you, I
[2:26:33] need that power more than anything
[2:26:35] before. Amen. And we want that power to
[2:26:38] fall upon us even this morning. Say,
[2:26:41] "Lord, I I my my cup is running dry."
[2:26:43] And I need a little bit more of that
[2:26:46] power, Lord. I just come this morning by
[2:26:48] my way. And Lord, I don't know you this
[2:26:51] morning. And I desire for you to just
[2:26:54] let that power fall on me, Lord. That it
[2:26:56] may just come into my heart and make me
[2:26:58] what you want me to be. Amen. Oh, pour
[2:27:01] your spirit out on
[2:27:05] me. Fall just like the
[2:27:09] rain. Oh, and such
[2:27:13] to my thirsty
[2:27:17] soul. Come and fall a fresh on

[2:41:58] Amen. Whatever you have need of, he's
[2:42:00] here to give it to you. That's the
