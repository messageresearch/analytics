you have need of before you even ask he knows the turmoil that the enemy brings he knows the heartache the enemy brings and he knows the battle that goes on in your mind this morning so if you could just turn it over to him and let him reain in your heart in your life you'll find out that he knows you and he loves you amen let us pray this morning our gracious Heavenly Father we certainly have come this morning because there's a deep that calls father we did didn't choose you you chose us we didn't call for you Lord you called us and father we've heard that call and many times we don't know where it's leading us or and we find ourselves in times of quandry and wonderment wondering what your will is wondering what your way is and father we've come to sit down with you and have you speak to us to use the songs and the music and the lips of clay to rehearse the great things that were spoken in our age to guide us through these challenging times father we know our enemy appears as an angel of Light and we're living in the most deceptive age that there ever was father may we have our eyes annointed with isav this morning that we may see May our raint be white May our gold be tried in fire father that when it's the battles over and we stand that we can say I've run a good race I've fought a good fight I'm here to receive the crown that has been laid up for me we ask father you hear our prayer this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen and amen God bless you if you have your Bibles let's um turn over to First John um uh 1 John chapter 1 uh this morning um we we're going to listen to a little um portion of a message called uh the way to have fellowship and um so we'll we'll read our scripture and then uh we'll visit a little bit and start the the tape so let's read in first John chapter 1 starting with the third verse and and this this should be what every believer uh can say that which we H have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we un to you that your joy may be full this this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanse us from all sin Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in our precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated this morning you know I I guess as far as the city of bedford's concerned our construction project has come to an end as of last Friday we got our our uh we passed the our permit on the little uh storage building in the back and we got our permit on the Pavilion so now the pavilion's there to uh sit under if you'd like to fellowship and and and then we can have some uh we we we might have to have a uh a a barbecue out there a dedication barbecue and uh we'll get brother Tim to fire up the grill and cook those hamburgers and hot dogs for us and and as soon as we get a good day we'll just have a time of Fellowship out there and uh you know our goal is to try to keep uh the kids and everybody from standing in the the walkway the driveways out there with people backing up and uh I I know cuz I had an experience where I almost sent one of our children to heaven and uh you know uh it's not my job to send them it's his job to take them so we uh certainly want to keep the all that area uh clear so we we started the year uh talking about our path forward because that we've came to the place that we've uh finished uh the outside work we've finished the uh a building so to speak and uh whether we made it big enough or small enough it doesn't matter uh we know how to fit into a small space amen so we know uh we we we can move the pews up 6 in we can add another couple rows up up front we can add a row and back uh you know and then if we outgrow this uh I don't know I'm going to retire but I hope we do outgrow it to be honest with you I want like like John said he said those things which I have heard and those things which I have seen I declare unto you that you might have fellowship with us and and really that's what we're sharing we're not sharing that we're right and our Doctrine is right and and and you're wrong and we're not sharing you know God sent a prophet and if you don't believe them uh you know that's not what's in our hearts our heart is that if you could know the joy it's just like when the church went out and the restoration of gifts came in in in early Pentecost it those people had experienced an experience of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and in that in that experience they had they felt a joy and they felt a seal they they felt something that they've never felt before for cuz they prayed for it and God heard their prayer and if you pray for a blessing of the Lord God will hear your prayer and they were so thrilled in their hearts that they went to share it but they they weren't sharing your lost they were sharing oh if you could taste the glory and the goodness of God and that that's what this message is to us it's the goodness of God it's it's so wonderful to have your eyes open and and to see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he is in our presence and that he wants to have fellowship with us and so we we completed and then we said what what were our desire of the path forward is is that we want to start working on the inside we finished the building now let's let's work on us the occupants uh let's each of us have a remodel you know what I mean a a rededication a a re-inspired that we can see things in a light that we've never seen them before that we we'll have a path forward uh in our personal lives so uh uh that uh that when we go out that our candle is truly lit and it's truly sitting on the hilltop and the the words of the Lord are on our lips and his praise is in our heart and that we're there's such an atmosphere about us that people long to have what you have the scripture says that they inquire of you what's this hope you have uh you know I I I kind of Marvel you know I was telling somebody uh it seems like uh you know some people oh they're they're they're so hopeful now that uh you know uh we have a president Donald Trump's president oh we have hope you know I thought you know it's like get ready to get thrown in prison you know the first cop comes in and he's the bad cop you know he threatens you and he's real rough and the second cop comes in and he's going to be your friend hey I'm your friend here I can make it easy on you you you know what I mean and he tries to whenn you over but the outcomes jail would you rather go to jail by the good cop or the bad cop well the outcome's hell that's right you know you could push one guy as the but it scares me you understand how blind people come so so now this we have somebody that talks about prosperity and and wealth well it's harder for a rich man to get into the Kingdom of Heaven than it is a camel to get to the eye of a needle and everybody's going praise God the economy is going to be here I'm going to be rich oh yeah okay it's just going to be harder for you to get into the kingdom more to distract you you know what I mean the love of money's always been the root of all all evil you know what I'm saying and so that's why we've got to put on our isav we got to have our spiritual goggles on we need this message more than ever and and so you know it's real simple to get all to think oh this is wonderful I like this his politics better than the other politics let me tell you something it's Wolves and sheep's clothing that's all it is it don't get your hopes up because you've got a guy that's going to do this or or going to do that uh it it's not for for me to say and uh uh you know I thought there was some crazy stuff going on on one side of the fence but there's crazy stuff going on in the other side of the fence there's only one place I know that's got the truth and that's the word of God and that's what we want to keep our hearts and our minds on so we're we our goal if I could say and we begin to ask ourselves this because I begin to realize this and I begin to see it among so many people that and even within our own framework this morning is that sometimes we feel like we follow the message you know what I mean and we believe the message but we don't belong to the body you know you understand this is where we go to church but we only go to church because brother brandom said to go to church on Sunday and so when we come to church we kind of come in and we already know what we believe and and we're already set in our ways and we've come in here we're going to spend the hour or two hours or whatever the preacher goes and and then we fulfilled that check off of off of the blank and then we go out and we we live our lives and and uh even Within Myself I I had that kind of framework of an attitude and I I realize really what God's wanting to do he's wanting to change the heart of the people and uh that's what that uh the message came for because the that's what people begin to do they begin to break up in groups and and they they they got away from fellowship real Fellowship real love one for another and and and a real caring and a a real uh basis for sharing one another's burdens and uh you know we're we've got an extremely unique experience here you know I mean our our our brother came and sang for us this morning our both our brothers I didn't understand the words but their Spirit bore witness with mine now I know how that brother won his wife he serated her to death you know and uh you know so that's what I sang to Leslie one she said I'll marry if you never sing to me again and uh so you know and and that real Unity of the faith is what that we're after this morning so I want you to know this is what where my heart wants to be if somebody comes amongst us and they're outside of the will of God I don't want to condemn them I want them to know there's a way back you know what I mean if somebody's made a mistake we want to know that there's a that love covers a multitude of sins and that he that was within us is greater than he who is in the world and we've got our doctrines down you know what I mean we we understand so many doctrines we spent so much time on Doctrine and teachings and Revelations that and that's why I preach that message don't forget Titus that we forgot how to be Christians we forgot how to link up uh with the word of God and and uh read your Bible every day and have it speak to you brother R made this statement I thought it was a a a a a a good of things he said the Waters of separation is the word you know we talk about well you know the Waters of Separation he said the Waters of separation is the word it it's the word that separates no matter what it is in your life it's the word that separates the word is sharper than a two-edged sword discerning so our our love affair with the Bible has uh amongst all of us has got to increase you understand brother Ren's message came from the Bible he even came where he was in question whether those seals were going to be written on the back side of the book and then when the Lord took them and showed them he said no they're in the book but they've just been hid and then afterwards he was able to pick this up and say this has become a brand new book well just think of it now he's reading this Through The Eyes of uh understanding of the mystery of Jesus Christ and if you can start reading listening to the message and then reading this Bible and watching those two come together I I'll tell you you will you will feel a a strength and a confidence and that's what we're Desiring we're Desiring a body of Believers that have strength confidence humility and love but you know you're a Believer for you to know you have access to the throne to know that if you ask anything of the father in his name that he'll Grant it think of that think of that a being with four or 500 people that that stood there and and knew that God heard their prayer and that they're standing shoulder toosh shoulder with you like that guy on the field that guy come up and said hell Mary full of grace he was laying there dying the guy stopped and said wait a minute he said I don't want no secretary you know I want to talk to the the main one so we don't want to to share a Doctrine with people we don't want to share a program with people we don't want to uh share the building or anything we want to be able to share the love of God that was manifested in Christ Jesus and we want that love in US that's the secret he said the he said the water of separation is the word the word of God the water of Separation through the washing of the Water by the word you come and hear the word and the first thing it does it separates you to move your thoughts from Evil to good amen man so that that's what we're here this morning we're here to move our thoughts from where that we are and how that we're thinking and let the word of God let the messenger preach to us and let him move our thoughts because you only get out of a service what you put into it you know what I mean you got when you make a cake if you ever left an ingredients out oh I forgot the yeast or I forgot the flour oh I put salt instead of sugar you know I mean and it it you don't if it's not put in right it don't come out right now wouldn't it be wonderful if we could all come into the house of the Lord and some when they we started singing a song everybody just got into that song and sung it with all their heart got in the spirit of the song Amazing Grace Oh Amazing Grace how great the sound you know the day it appeared to me and and you start putting something into it you know but if you've been playing bingo all night you know what I mean then you kind of roll in here and sleep on the pews you know I mean we got to make rules that if you want to sleep go sleep in the fellowship hall we're not going to condemn you for sleeping but don't sleep in here okay I don't need to examine your Adams Apple you know what I mean I know what most of the Adams apples in here look like I I've seen your feelings I you know I've seen your tonsils you you know what I'm saying but we're we're wanting to get up higher we're wanting to rise we want to start putting into it we want to come in here think what's the spirit today where's the spirit been leading what scriptures have I been reading what's the preacher going to preach on and and and you you start set in the atmosphere you you know what I mean you start if you got little things in your life you start saying I'm sorry and and and all of a sudden you're starting to create an atmosphere and the atmosphere that we're trying to create is an atmosphere for fellowship and so uh uh and and that's why this I I just felt so led to uh uh play this this morning and I I I'm only going to play 32 minutes of it there's another 10 minutes or something that uh brother Brenham gives to uh before the prayer line and I I I thought this is a great statement he made right before the prayer line he said Jesus is real he raised from the dead and he will be right here at the platform in a few minutes oh my when I read that I thought oh my thank you Lord you know I mean what a way to put it Jesus is real and he'll be here in a few minutes how many have heard him say he's here I take every spirit in this building in my control in the name of Jesus Christ he says you feel that he's here he says you know what that is you're feeling it's him he's here a amen and I know people got all kinds of different uh uh doctrines about who he's here and where he's there and and what coming and this coming but we were promised that scriptural fulfillment that the Lord Jesus Christ would come again to the Gentiles Veil himself in a prophet messenger Veil himself and do the same works for the Gentiles that he did for the Jews and I think this is so that was just so beautiful and he'll be in a few he say Jesus is real he raised from the dead he'll be right here at this platform in a few minutes doing the same things he did back there to prove to you people that he's here and wants Fellowship amen and if he wants Fellowship he wants us to have fellowship and fellowship one with another there so that's my heart's desire so if brother rm's going to read as we uh get ready to play this the way to have fellowship and I hope you catch it we'll spend a few moments after he speaks we're going to start at paragraph uh 14 if you look it up it's 109 195 five the way to have fellowship and uh brother bram's going to read uh a few verses out of First John that we just read so you can remain seating uh seated from now on out because we already stood and read the scripture so Lord bless you listen closely you'll find out the secret to Fellowship the secret to a good body of believers and if I could just jump ahead and say this I think we'll understand what the Capstone really is all about God bless you as you listen to whom I believe to be an angel of the Lord a prophet messenger that was sent in this day to turn the hearts of the children back to their fathers and to restore the faith and Truth to the church God bless you now we love him with all of our hearts so tonight we're going to take a little scripture lesson and then I want to try to have be have the prayer line going and for tomorrow's Monday and you've got to go to work you got to catch trains out and I've kept you late every night and you forgive me for that will you and uh a lot of times I get so enthused when I start could I call it preaching anyhow when I'm having a good time well then I get so enthused I lose all thoughts of time and everything so you've been very nice to stay with me and it just makes me love you with all my heart now I want to read some words out of God's Bible in first John the first chapter and the 5th verse to the 7th and I believe we'll just read the seventh verse and that will make it shorter you read the whole chapter when you get home if you can if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sins isn't that marvelous let's ask him to bless the reading of his word now heavenly father bless Thy word tonight and may go out to every heart and find a dwelling place and never leave leave no more Grant it Lord and now circumcise the lips of the Unworthy person that's to speak and circumcise all the ears of these people who are to hear and get Glory out of the service for we ask it in Jesus name our loving son amen now I want to speak to you just a little while tonight been this has been such a wonderful week upon the way to have Fellowship now we know that I was going to continue my service tonight the children of Israel over in the Homeland Joshua take them over where we left last night when he was crossing this the Red Sea but I wouldn't have time in this prayer line so he can uh catch trains and so forth and get home and go to work in the morning now this would be short we can talk to you just short on this but how that uh every person desires Fellowship I've never seen anyone yet who did not desire Fellowship that is was was all right mentally balanc now you might want to pick your fellowship of course that's true to every one of us that's the reason tonight that all these fine people have packed out here in this building to a place where they're standing is because that they like this type of Fellowship they like Christian fellowship and that's why we come tonight to Fellowship around the word I love the word don't you and you know why you love the word you have the Holy Spirit in you for the Bible said that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so the Holy Spirit feeds on the word and then when you hear the word everyone wants to hear it no matter every little piece of literature they can pick up they they read it and they listen to the radio and they go to church and so forth because they are longing for that fellowships around the world and may God help us tonight to realize how we can have a perfect Fellowship no matter where Storms Come whether you're right or wrong you can still have fellowship and only way you can have Fellowship as your love perfects don't never forget me if I don't see some of you anymore remember this that my theme is love covers it all I believe in the redeeming love of the Lord Jesus I like this song ever since by faith I saw the streams thy flowing wounds supplied redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die I'd rather have a church listen just a moment I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church amen that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gifts they'll fail where there is gifts will bring confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts now the reason why is it that people perhaps like different things like Fellowship is because first man was made to Fellowship I just think of tonight as much as I long to go hunting and fishing and Outdoors yet my heart is more hungry to get on top of that mountain talk to God than anything I know of yeah I want to be alone I want to know there's nobody 100 miles from me I love people but the only way I can minister to people is to first get the message from God and I know this one thing that my faith tells me that every person that's borned again that I preach to I'll have an eternity to fellowship with him but we want to bring more in out of the darkness there's our poor lost brothers and sisters out here tonight and sloon I passed by Skid roll last night as my boy and I'm wanted to see and see those poor people down there drinking and think that they don't they don't know what they do want I thought if they only knew my Jesus they sure wouldn't be down there see and that's the only thing that can save them from that chaos that they're in there's no medicine nothing alcoholic is a perfect total annihilation from any help at all outside of Jesus Christ that's right there's no cure I've been on the B I've been in pig alley in France to the lowest slums that I could find and talking and praying and so forth and the only hope for them people is the blood of Jesus Christ it's the only thing the only hope now what makes man want to Fellowship is because he was made that way he was made to have Fellowship what Fellowship is I got four days driving to do starting tomorrow I got four days to drive to about 2500 miles and I have to drive it by myself in a little old truck and someone a friend of mine is coming down just left word this afternoon to ride all the way out there with me ride back byself on a Greyhound bus just to have Fellowship isn't that wonderful you know I appreciate friend friends like that God bless his little Swiss har I love him wanting to ride just to be with me four days across the mountains and prairies over under just to have Fellowship we love each other dearly as dearly beloved brothers and then have to ride all the way back up to sh Shana Westcon on a bus or somehow just to get back oh that makes my heart jump and now God Is So longing to have fellowship with his children that he come all the way from glory and died to have fellowship with us isn't that marvelous so wonderful to think now in the beginning man had Fellowship first we realize if we can have fellowship with God then don't worry God will take care of the rest of it the main thing I want to speak on I've got it in four parts here how to have fellowship with God Fellowship one another and so forth but we want to talk only on the one phase of it is the fellowship with God and now I'm going to watch that clock there to be sure that I get the prayer line started in time but fellowship with God is what the first and original Fellowship that human beings had was with God there wasn't even another another living creature on the earth that he could fellowship with Adam but God then God made him a helpmate a wife which is part of him and could you imagine in the evenings when the sun had gone down going setting way back in the west and that streaks of light coming down through those great evergreen trees God's Great Cathedral and he the Roar on a throng through the top of the trees and Adam and Eve sitting out there in the garden in God's Great Cathedral having fellowship with God everybody longs to do that every Christian longs to have Fellowship isn't that right I've read stories of man who spent a lifetime early going high into the hills going down to the Lakeside just hunting for a spot for Fellowship but after all you don't have to go anywhere but the calvary that's the only way there's a way there's only one way that you can go to fellowship and notice then not way there hasn't only been in this AG of has been in all ages just think job way the oldest book in the Bible he longed for Fellowship he know there was a Creator and he believed him with all of his heart and he said in a child way of saying it oh if I could only get to him if I only knew where he lived at I could go up knock on his door and talk to him just a little while wouldn't we all love to do that but think he's closer to you than his door his door is your heart and he's so close tonight he's closer to you than your right arm is he's part of you and if we can only realize that he's here and how he wants to have fellowship with us his heart is greater for Fellowship than ours are and the reason makes us that way because we're offsprings of his that's what makes us long for Fellowship that's what makes a mother would die for her baby why that's what makes a father would give give his life for his wife a husband a true husband would give his life for his wife why because Christ gave his life for the church his wife it's a strain in you and it make a mother Dash to a burning fire not thinking about her own self and her hair on fire and her clothes on fire to grab her baby and run out with it why it's love of a parent and God is the first and Original Parent and there's where that strain comes through because the woman gave birth to the child and that's the reason God's come down manifested in the flesh and went to the very flames of hottest of suffering that he might bring us into fellowship with him taking old thought of his own not my will thine be done how that wonderful Fellowship that we have with each other and with God now God intended this Fellowship so what separated what keeps man from having that direct talk like Adam did I've often thought that Adam out in the Garden of Eden knowing no sin AR Eve his wife beautiful standing in the garden and then Leo the Lion would come up and here come the Tiger The Great beast of the of the fields come up into this Cathedral kneeling on their knees and they even even the Beast didn't have have any killing about them they there was nothing no death nowhere the devil's what makes wild animals wants to hurt you and if you can produce in your heart the right kind of a love towards the most horrible Beast there is in the woods or the deserts that Beast won't harm you that's right I know it by experience but you can't pretend it he knows knows whether you do or not there's something about him and he knows it but if you're really not afraid I've never seen anything that would hurt you no matter a line whatever it might be you'll walk away from you but if you run or act like you're scared or something then you'll get killed so you can't just make it up you've got to really know it in your heart that you're not afraid that's a trouble with man tonight that's what's a trouble with people tonight you're scared that's the biggest curse there is on the Full Gospel people or any other people is because they are afraid God has made the provision but you're afraid to take his word for it if you was wasn't afraid tonight while you would take your healing by faith and know that God promised it and the thing would just go PL away from you afraid scared and I've noticed it and that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing I know that if you can get away from that scare and get love in its place something's going to happen there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them is is Faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of god fear is of the devil fear makes You Weary fear makes you wonder and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do me get all stewed up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would that do me to worry about it well you say what good would it do to have faith faith can sign my pardon sure there's value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first for love produces faith for perfect love get it perfect love cast out all fear wish I had time to tell you the experiences with wild life of what I've seen conquered by Faith by love I told you other night about the old P being sent up I seen a vicious bull one day was going to kill me this is on record I was a game warden at the time I was going over the hill to pray for a sick man when we're supposed to pack a gun but you wouldn't go to pray for a sick man with a gun on your hand so I tucked the gun and laid in a little old truck and crossed over through the field and I was way out in the field and I knew I had a a to thought that this killer bull was out there he just killed a colored man on a farm Mr burs just about 3 months before that and had sold him up there to the people had had these dur cattle and then when I started across the field right out in a big open field and not over about 30 yards from me this big fell raised up and threw his horns down and let out a big Beller if you know what I'm talking about and there he was horns about like this and here he comes at first it scared me I I looked for a tree and there wasn't any tree and I know he could outrun me to the fence so I thought well this is it so then something happen oh God if that would only stay there instead of going away something happened I I wish God would let it happen to everybody here tonight just long enough to get healed something happened that I wasn't scared theable I felt sorry because I Disturbed him I in his feel he was laying out there not bothering me I come along and woke him up and so I felt sorry for me now you can't Bluff it it has to be there that's the way faith is you can't Bluff you got to really have it the devil know it and this fellow started towards me with his head down just as hard as he could I wasn't more afraid of that bull than I would be if any my dear brothers and sisters stand on this platform and he run within about 5et of me and he stopped he looked at me so depleted he looked right and left I said fella I'm sorry I Disturbed you I said now you're God's creature and I'm God's servant now the Creator made you made me and I am his servant I'm on my journey across the hill to pray for one of these sick children if I know you've been laying there I wouldn't have come by and Disturbed you so now in the name of Jesus Christ the Creator go back and lay down at the Judgment bar you'll see it brought into light that bull looked at me a few minutes turned around walked over and laid down and I I stood there the tears running down my cheeks I walked within 5 foot of that bull and he ever even turned his head and looked at me why instead of hating him I loved him Love Will Conquer anything right that's what conquered my heart when I know that God so loved me that he gave his only begotten son that I wouldn't have to perish know that I was born in this world of Sinner and was perishing and God loved me that he gave his son to for my life to be redeemed and that I I couldn't hate no more I had to love that's what brings these results that you see it's love I don't know I might have told this I have told it before hundreds of little things has happened one day I was mowing my yard I had to get in a backyard the front yard is growing up before I get the back now people come being prayed for and things see as Joseph said a while ago it's just here this is just this is just Chicago at home it's all around the world see where people are coming and going from all parts of the world coming in and when I was mowing this grass and I run in forgot about it there's a harness Nest back there there and I hit that fence with this more machine and I was covered over with horn some great Big Fellas it'll knock you down when the it at first I was scared truly no shirt on and something other happened I I was sorry I hit those Fells not because I was afraid as going to get stung but really it sounds juvenile but if we could just be more juvenile if we could be more child like it's a Simplicity of God that turns college students around be simple in those things just like a baby just rely and believe don't try to push yourself just relax and believe it all don't try to work yourself up oh God how you re that's no no good no just believe it and walk on that's all so when that happened I thought and poor little fellas up there in their nest now and here I done hit the fence and knocked them out of their nest that big old Mo machine I was pushing and I said you little creatures of God I'm sorry that I hit this fence I'm sorry I Disturbed you now I'm God servant and I'm praying for your sick children got to hurry and mold this yard so now you rush right back into your nest I won't bother you no more in the name of the Lord Jesus I started my mow off again and stopped it I pulled the string and started off like that and then beat just a humming all around my naked shoulders and they took a beine and went right back into their nest not singing it all love I can't produce it I can't work it up God's Got to Give it there's where it is tonight God has to give it then love produces a fellowship now when God said back there the day that sin had separated that Divine love God told Adam and Eve not to eat these certain fruits and they did and sin brought separation and sin by separation brought hatred malice Strife Envy is that right what happened they separated from Divine love and when you separate from Divine love then you can't overlook your brother's mistakes no more you got to ball him out for that's right you can't Overlook sister's mistakes no more because you've got away from that Divine part that love part but if you really love the Lord Jesus if sister or brother does something to you oh well that's all right they didn't mean to do it that's the kind of love that Christ had father forgive them they don't know what they're doing what if he had help my sins against me what an awful person I was but he loved me so well that he forgave me far what I was undone he forgave me he loved me a pure love and when Adam separated himself from pure love of keeping God's word in his heart when he did that then he began these other faculties come in Malice Envy Strife hatred so forth now when God seen that his children had separated he come down for fellowship and there was no one there to welcome remember the other night when I preached on the woman washing Jesus's feet he was unwelcomed by the Pharisees he's unwelcome tonight in many people he's unwelcome in many churches many cities look when Israel was dividing up their lands there was I believe it was Gad was one of them and perhaps uh the half tribe they didn't go over into the promised land they stayed on this side barter line Jesus visit that same people and look at the results of staying out of the full benefits of God's love when Jesus visited them he went over in gatera that's where they were dwelt that's where they made that's where they come from right there and their attitude was still the same way because that they had to cost them a bunch of hogs to have the meeting they asked Jesus to leave their land they didn't want nothing to do with it they had their own ways they had their own churches they didn't want nothing to do with Jesus so they asked him to leave the land but he went anyhow because there was one Soul calling baring just think cross that stormy Lake over across there to find one soul in need that was his love for one needy Soul he'll come from Glory tonight to this school auditorium for one needy Soul that'll believe him and so then when sin came in it separated man from fellowship notice what God did to bring man back to fellowship he introduced to the world of blood Redemption God killed animals and put forther Skin showing of blood Redemption and there God after being separated from his from his uh creatures God laid out the welcome mat back home by the shedding of the blood and that's was then and has been and will always be God's provided preparation for our fellowship with him is through the shed blood friend listen to me just a few moments because I see I got 12 minutes yet look I want to ask you they have cried they have tried hard to substitute education for that blood it'll never work they have tried hard The Substitute denomination to bring Fellowship educate people the world today as brother Tommy Hicks that wonderful little brother was here today giving us his story back in behind the Iron Curtain there Russia and all of its culture and science trying to bring a fellowship through communism through uh science and culture and denying the blood of Jesus when the blood of Christ is the only way that you can have Fellowship amen nothing will take its place thanks be to God you don't have to be smart you don't have to be intelligent you just have to have a humble submitted heart think of it he introduced blood now I want you to watch closely now we speaking of job a while ago job used this same preparation the oldest book in the Bible even before Genesis was written job was written and job was a righteous man a man who feared God and troubles came to him but I want you to notice just before the troubles come job made preparations for this trouble listen friend sinner friend there's trouble right ahead of you tonight and that's the valleys of The Shadow Shadows of death you better make preparations for the only friend who can walk with you through that right make preparations for IT job had a bunch of daughters and sons and when he knew that they were out like birds people raise up children today I feel sorry for fathers and mothers today being a parent myself and knowing one reason I'm trying to get my children away from our city we don't have any Christian schools there and I want to get them somewhere where they'll be brought up in school in a real Fundamental School where they learn to love the Lord the teaching that I can give them around home yet they get out with that worldly crowd the Devil is a shrewd fellon and he pushes that into them amen if you can keep them under the spirit until they get old enough to receive the Holy Ghost and know what it's all about then God will take care of the rest of them but first they got them little adolescent days now every person thinks of their children while they're under your your wings you can watch them but once out from under the wings then the devil's got every little old Oscar he can out there to associate with your children that's idelic and mean and devilish and everything else God help us this juvenile delinquency here in New York Chicago and these big cities what the papers is writing up how they kill one another and everything little children little boys and girls killing and murdering and shooting and so forth like that if those poor little kitties only realize that that's the devil sure what brought on juvenile delinquency was parent delinquency the parent failing to take care of the children you remember a few years ago when my boy was born that's been about I think he's about 19 now I remember the doctor told my wife said just let that kid Squall said it ain't going to Hur him and if Grandma comes along to pick him up said take her keep her hands off of him said he ought to be crib broke at 6 months old now you know better than that sounds like a talking of a witch doctor instead of a real doctor and then you know what it hatched out it hatched out a bunch of neurotics and a bunch of to gangsters listen God gave you that baby to love I don't care how bad you Spar it love it anyhow that's right love it if you don't love it now it'll grow up in a cold home and indifference and it'll seek love somewhere or something it'll make an outl for somewhere mother take that baby and give it fellowship and love now make it a part of you which it is and act like it and hug it and kiss it and and and love it don't be too cold with the things of the world God gave you that as a treasure raise it right amen notice that's what's a matter we got away from the things of God you get away from nature and then you're out of the will of God now I want you to notice then joob thinking of his children he said now per Venture when they go out they might sin so he offered the only preparation that he knowed about was a burnt sacrifice the shedding of blood and he shed the blood of the lamb for his children making preparation if they did Sin you see it job was mindful of his children to make a preparation for their sins and mother and father if we would quit spending money on our children learning tap dancing and things like that and some kind of how to be an actor and put more time of pleading the blood of Jesus up over them and showing them love and fellowship we'd get along better the child would too teach your child I believe if every parent would take their child and the first a parent come back to God and take the beer out of the ice box and take the cards off the table oh you say it's innocent you see what it hatches out brother I wouldn't let a card light on my ground no sir it's a devil s keep away from it you say you're oldfashioned brother Brandon well it was an oldfashioned gospel save me amen it's oldfashioned salvation makes me happy it was oldfashioned holy ghost that healed me it's the same thing going to take us home to Glory sure teach your child could you use that this morning you know those are some of the things we've let Slipped Away we got so sometimes into so many Mysteries and things we've forgot the ABCs you know what I mean what it means and and what the foundation of Fellowship is is that we've all been saved by the blood of the Lamb we're Sinners and and that that's the question is is do you have that Fellowship you know and and that that fellowship's available to us so we don't want to and I I I guess I wish I had a better vocabulary but the message is not a substitute for Calvary it is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's the revelation of him that went to Calvary and the love that he had in his heart for his own God so Lov the world he gave his only begotten son you know we those foundations uh and the atmosphere what I loved about this tape so much was the spirit in which brother Brandon brought it the atmosphere he had how he approached Sinners how he approached alcoholics how that he approached things how he talked about how we approach one another how we love one another he said love is is the answer to it all it it sits way up there as the Capstone but you understand it's the completion because love and faith he said they work together you can't have faith without love love produces Faith so here we are at the end of it and what's he putting back on us he's trying to bring us back to the love because that's what the foundation started on see you can't go to Calvary and not get what produced Calvary let me say you can't go to Calvary and isn't really why that we're here today if you're just here because somebody explained the message to you that brother Bram was a prophet and you said brother bram's a prophet I forgot that and and you've never understood that what the prophet came for was to restore back the fellowship that's why one one of his very last sermons he preaches coming in 65 he says God's only provided place of worship he's bringing all the church after all the seals and everything he's trying to bring the church back to the love that God had for us and may the love of God be shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit and and when that kind of care comes in I like what he said he said if you've been to Calvary and you know that love he said the lack of that love is what makes you criticize your brother instead of saying oh it's all right they don't mean to do that and and that's what that's what it's all about and we can't forget that we can't forget that that love that he had for us has anybody ever been forgiven of your sins you know what it's like you know what it's like to walk up a him and and know everything that you've done and and he already knows it you know there's no need hiding it from them and just be honest with them and pray and and and just know when he comes and forgives your heart and lets you know I love you and I'll not leave you and I'll not forsake you but I'm going to walk you through it and then he he he he he didn't bring this message to separate us from one another he brought this message to separate us from the lies and the deceits of Satan you know the the the lies that the days of Miracles have passed all the lies of what the holy spirit is and what the evidence is all those lies were things that were just confusion that was sent by the enemy to keep us from having that real love in our heart and that real Fellowship in our heart have that real sweet nature and that real humble nature towards one another bringing in things to judge one another another by do you have the Holy Ghost you know have you spoken tongues I had people put that on me and just asked me well have you spoken Tong you I said do do you witness that I have the Holy Spirit have I prayed for the sick and and have they recovered have you know and yet have have I spoken tongues it didn't it doesn't matter because it's the blood of the lamb and this is what brother R said I'd rather have a church that loved one another really loved one another and didn't have one ounce of gifts but if you get the love he said the gifts will come and they're motivated not by P production they're motivated by love your heart's so burdened for somebody you you're in prayer all night long for somebody that's sick and the Lord speaks to your heart go take that handkerchief and your in your closet and go down to the uh hospital and lay your hand on them and and get the brothers together and pray for that together on that handkerchief bring it down there and put it on the brother and say we we're praying for you brother in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ be well that love is what produces it you heard what what he said he said he said gifts cause confusion another see without the core Calvary experience without that real knowing that you're forgiven what what broke Adam's Fellowship what broke Adam's Fellowship because that think he let something come in between him and God and then when God come looking for him God knew that God wasn't the one who changed his Fellowship he still come looking for Adam he would have talked it over with Adam but Adam hid you know and and this is what I'm those of us who are here this morning do you understand we got to deal with our hearts we've got to deal with our attitude towards the Lord the fellowship do we have fellowship with him and if we have fellowship with him we have fellowship with one another it becomes it's the foundation of everything we're going and and I I I'm I've been preaching this message a long time and so I'm as guilty as anybody but sometimes we got out and we started building our churches on on the message and not understanding what the message was the message was the love redeeming blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness the redeeming he says that's my theme is the redeeming cleansing blood of the Lord Jesus Christ it's that blood that heals us it's that love that God expressed it so he just didn't say I love you you understand he actually expressed that love by sending his only begotten son and that son dying for your sins and that's all that God required and so if you go there with your sins he's already there provided the sacrifice for you you accept that sacrifice you accept that love that love comes into your heart then the Holy Spirit spreads that love abroad with everybody you come in contact you're changed I like what he said he said it's the Simplicity of the Gospel that turns college students around I mean when I start listening to these thing I mean I I I start drawing lines and got it covered and start writing notes and thir 30 pages becomes the a volume for me why because it's Eternal God is love and you can't fake it it's a gift of God lest any man should boast and it's simple God puts you under conviction your heart gets torn your heart gets pricked you go to him you confess your sins to him and he's faithful and just to forgive you and he wipes that from you it causes you to love him and then he says I first L you you love me because I first love you if you love me love one another little children love one another care one for another be involved with one another pray one for another in other words the fact that you believe that William Brandon was a prophet of God that is an immuable fact that's as much as a fact as 2 plus two is four that is identified proved it it it it it's it's not even hard to believe the only reason not everybody beli believes it is because he hid it from them to to reveal it to you so that you could have some idea and identity of how much love he has for you that he showed you something so obvious and yet because there wasn't pure love they rejected it they rejected it out of jealousy they rejected it because they thought that they would lose their money they rejected it because they thought they'd lose their influence we don't have in any influence we have an absolute we have an absolute thus saith the Lord message we don't have to have big eyes we don't have to have little use we've all been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb so let us start applying the token let us love one another that we get unrighteousness out of our lives that we care one for another that let's be what the first church really was what was restored back to them those people had Fellowship one with another because they they all realize the price one another paid from coming out from the Jewish faith the Gentiles that came out from their families and started Fallen us they all bore the reproach we're not trying to Bear the reproach anymore we're trying to cover it up by being just like everybody else having every other program Under the Sun let's get a gymnasium pretty soon we got gyms we got this you know I I hope someday we don't get swimming pools see we're starting to get away from it really what are what it is it's all about his love for us and that love contacting us and we get involved in that Fellowship in that love and that love wherein he loved us brother Jim hay shared that scripture with me and it just he just shared it at such a perfect time lord almost speaking from his lips he said herein is the love of God made perfect as he he is so are we in this world that's what it start it's what it comes back to ask yourself this morning do you love them ask yourself am I in fellowship with him do I talk to him in the morning do I talk to him at night or do I have all kinds of things that are keeping me out of Fellowship cuz that's the only thing the enemy wants to do did you hear what he said if you're in fellowship with God then you know he'll take care of everything when you're in fellowship with him he you know he'll take care of everything you know he's got you you can you just know he's in the palm of his hand he know that he loves you he know you won't he won't forsake you and when you do wrong you're sorry and you say Aba father I I'm sorry Lord my flesh got in the way I I have this weakness I I I fall but but Lord you know I know that you chose me I know that you died for me I know that you separated me from sin I know you want me to do good I know you want me to be Christlike you want me to lay a pattern of good work works I'm not part of a group Lord this is between me and you once the prophet God said I'd love to do anything he says but what I love more than anything else is getting on top of that mountain and talking to God he says some days I'll be up there two or three days under the same tree just fellowshipping do you believe that he wants to have that with you if if Satan tells you you're if Satan tells you you're not worthy well you know that's a lie huh because he's a liar God wants to have Fellowship the prophet of God said Jesus Christ will be here on this platform in just a few minutes doing the same things he did when he was here on Earth to show you that he wants to have fellowship with you not to make you a smarty pants not to make you a know it all not to make you puffed up not so some preachers can go in there and take the teachings and the revelations that brother brandham taught make them so complicated start teaching them in so many different ways that you sit there and say well I never seen that before before I never looked at it that way before I never thought that way before you know why you've never been to Calvary but when you know he's the one that saved you when you know he's the one that forgave you of your sins when you know he loves you he won't forsake you you don't care you can say what brother brandham said when they said to him brother Bram you just don't know your Bible he said yeah but I know the author real well I know the author real well and and and why work with try to go out and work with the rest of the world when we need to work right in here till everybody's got the love of God shed abroad in their heart all our young people have the Holy Spirit all not some emotional not some gift thing that they have love in their heart the love of God shed abroad in their heart by the Holy Spirit not our love of God not our love to God but his love shed abroad in our heart to one another when they meet you they meet the love of God why do you love because brother you can look at them and says I know you're rank I know you got tattoos from your toes I know you got a bone in your nose but let me tell you Jesus Christ loves you and died for you and just the shape you're in he can put a new heart in you and then when we feel that way to those out that we come in contact to the world we feel that way when we wake up in the morning thank you Lord I'm glad to be alive what would you have me do today when you love them and the love of God's in your heart and and and you know that he first loved you and you love him because he's extended that hand of love to you oh then you don't worry about it no it ain't you're not getting in because you understand the seventh seal or you understand the third pole nobody understands the third poll I've been in this message 50 years I've talked to every doctrinal genius in this message they don't understand the third pole they don't understand the seven seal they're trying to get it intellectually and the prophet of God said you can't come to intellect to the love of God through intellect God's got to give it to you and when he gives it to you you got it and when you've got love you've got power to conquer anything you're not going to go up like the sons of sephus did and say oh Satan you move I I believe in the Seven Seals he going to look at you says that was there when the Seven Seals revealed son you don't think he's religious one Apostle put it this where Satan believes also and he fears and trembles there's only one power fear and love love produces Faith you can have faith without love Love's got to come first it's got to come first I I have have so you know I I I wrote notes as I I I was listening this tape I started writing notes and then the more notes I wrote the more I realized I was missing and and and so you know you it just church it it's it comes back to the that that place again he says you know we want faith we want power we want works that's what the church is that's what the big confusion is today we want power we want works we want a demonstration we want to fight the devil you fight the devil I'm going to run I'm going to run from the devil and if he catches me I'm going to take the word of God and I'm going to cut his head off but I'm not looking for a fight with the devil I'm not you understand I'm going to stay on my ground in my realm in my joy in my peace and if he tries to come in I'm going to possess the Gate of the enemy I I'm going to rise up against him saying you can't come here you can't take this from me and if he brings sickness or he brings trouble in my home I can go to Calvary and I can lay it out before the Lord and I can beseech the Lord on the behalf of that person person I love and love will get the victory cuz that's what he's trying to cap this sted off but he said you got to have love first because love produces Faith love is the atmosphere that God can and will work in and we heard him say it ain't a workup it ain't trying to get the anointing to fall you know what you want let the love of God could be shed and broaden your heart you let everybody love one and tell when you're sick brother and he's sick and you hear he sick that your heart bleeds for him brother mcar I know you're going into surgery Tuesday for your eye I'll be praying for you I know God's going to make it work it's going to be be happy I don't have to sit there and say oh God heal my eye oh if I was a Believer no he going to use a doctor Hallelujah I'm good with that I'm good with that I know who I am I know he loved me this I don't have to prove to him that I love him and he loves me by me producing some sort of miracle what's happened to us what just happened to Simply loving one another caring one for another feeling apart I don't want you to come to church and feel like a stranger I don't want you to feel like I'm too busy and you can't call me I don't want you to feel that I'm something that's up here and you're down there I hate that I hate it I hate it I hate it I'm in this battle with you I can't make it without you I fall just like we all fall but there's something that holds us together God's opened our eyes to see what he's doing in this day and we've declared unto you the things which we have heard and which we have seen and therefore we have Fellowship one with another and with him that cleanses us from all unrighteousness when we get back to creating that atmosphere around each of us as individuals when we get back to what's important all these other things will follow but man's always trying to get the cart before the horse you know what pulls the church love love is the power love is the source love is what gets you down the road and you can get behind the cart with all your Revelations and all your doctrines and all your great preaching Styles and all your emotions and and everything and push that cart but It Will Never Move It Like Love Can and boy if you just get that Simplicity in your heart if if all of us would just go back and renew our vow with the Lord you say Lord I'm messed up he knows you're messed up maybe things happened to you may maybe as a child somebody took advantage of you I I I I sit with a A lot of people who've been molested and and taken advantage of and relatives have done terrible things to them I I couldn't even explain to you the some of the things that I I I've heard uh young sisters tell me of how how they were treated but yet that love of God can come down and wash it all away take all the stains take all the guilt take all the burden it's a completely different realm it's a different world you walk out of this world your eyes don't see turns your thoughts from Evil to good and you're living in a world that's full of love that's full of light that's fill of Joy Satan brought malice eny hatred Satan made the animals eat one another Satan did all this and then he said if you could just get in that love he says no animal would ever hurt you he said I was scared at first then the spirit reminded him who he was and what God had done for him and he said I'm a Child of God God loves me and I love you Bull and I'm sorry I love you bees and tell I'm sorry said you can't fake it but he couldn't preach it unless it was there for us to have you understand what I'm saying he couldn't preach it and the reason we seek after doctrines the reason we seek after theology the reason that we seek after all these vanities is because we haven't come face to face with the one that gave his life for us and we haven't accepted and we haven't confessed all our sins and all our shortcomings we just haven't got alone you know the greatest surgeries that can ever be performed is performed in the smallest room called the closet what would you do with the heart doctor or the brain surgeon took you down the hall and opened the broom closet and said this is where we're going to do surgery that the kind of doctor I'd want the one to get down on my knees and say you know I can go in there but I want you to know that if Jesus Christ doesn't guide my hand you may not come out of this where he gets all the glory it's all about him and and we try to have his Spirit don't matter if someone offends you did you hear what brother R said he said if I knew somebody I offended or somebody was mad at me I'd be on his doorstep in the morning because he don't want nothing in between don't let nothing get in between keep your path clear between one another care one for another reach out don't let your language be a barrier don't let your cultures be a barrier you know me I don't believe in culture I believe there's one culture word culture and no matter where we're from all of us have to come into that Capstone all of us have to have that love and I've been all over the world and I've met people with that love and their heart and when you meet them you connect and they love you and you love them and you don't care what they believe because you know they have the source of all comfort and all joy Jesus is the comfort and the source of all joy he's the answer let's don't fake it let's don't worry about what one another thinks let's don't think about our religion let's think about our heart and ask yourself is Jesus in my heart do I know he's forgiven me do I know he loves me do I know that nothing can pluck me out of the palm of his hand do I know if he started a work in me he'll finish it to the end do I know I'm his sheep and I hear his voice do I know I don't have to worry that nothing no apparel no sword no Enemy No Spirits in high places nothing can separate me from the love of God God that's in Christ Jesus and that's this morning church that I desire that every single one of us knows assuredly you see I've been sick a long time you just say Satan I've been sick a long time I'm sick but nothing can separate me from the love of Jesus Christ and I'm believing with all my heart that that love that he has for me one day he has a reason and he has a time and when that time comes I'm going to walk free and I'm going to testify of his love of his endurance how he stuck with me how he never forsake me and I'm going to give him all the glory I don't have to work up a healing I don't have to produce nothing I've turned every stone I've confessed all my sins I've placed it in my hands the hour is his and I'll just wait I'll put my eye on the end of the road like the boy on the bicycle who pedal down that 2x4 everybody fell off cuz they were looking for this trying to make this correction trying to adjust that adjustment he just said I put it all in his hands I looked at the prize and I just kept going I like what the man said he had his Bible and he said well he said I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I supposed to be but I sure ain't what I used to be and brother R he said he made a statement in this thing he said when love is perfected and without perfect love we won't be there and that's what we we got to start perfecting our conversations our attitudes our awareness of one another and I need more help than that than anybody you know I I grew up a loner I I I got a lot of complexes but I want that love of God to let me listen I want that love of God to make me see what's going on in somebody's life I want the love of God shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit isn't that really where we want to go don't you believe really that's what brother Brandon was trying to take us he said that's the way to True Fellowship is you and God under the shed blood and you know he's got you and if he has you what do you worried about if God be for you who can be against you if if you haven't had that experience with the Lord I encourage you to ask him the answer is the closet I could pray for you but if you don't go to your closet and you don't get shut in with God and you don't take care of it with him personally the outward show is isn't going to matter but if you will get in your heart and be honest with him he'll be honest with you and if you've been cold and indifferent and formal ask him to set your heart a flame ask him to renew your love story ask him that let that love surround you the Capstone is here for every believer to enter into I hope you heard me the capping of the church the love of God is here for every believer to enter into if that's the longing and desire of your heart even so come quickly Lord Jesus let's Stand Together Julie could you guys play that song at one I guess if there is a of blood or that one Billy if you could grab a mic to help me sing you know I I thought how often do I think of Calvary how often do I go back to where I'm in [Music] him how often do I start a day remembering that the only reason I have the Breath of Life is because he's kept me all these years how much time does he occupy in my heart in my mind and I want to go back maybe you just go back with me this morning because you're only going to find them where you left them yes maybe you just go back to where you got saved and when that conviction came on your heart you cried out to him and he answered you and maybe you just enter in for a few moments this morning and you'll just go back and think [Music] about how good he's been to you like David he looked back and he sat in that great palace and he looked out over that sheep field saw a little Shepherd out there tending the Sheep just a boy about his age and he sat and thought where God brought him from how he slew Goliath and how he defeated the enemies and how he was on the run from Saul and and how God kept them placed them on the throne and his heart would begin to sing can you feel that way can you enter into that Fellowship do you still have it in your heart don't let your heart grow cold that's the curse of this age is a cold heart a heart sheared with a hot [Music] iron but if you go to him he'll give you take that Stony heart out and replace it with the heart would you just think about it this morning will you think about how much you love him how much he loved you and will you just let that love start to come in your heart will you start forgiving everybody that's ever done anything against you you say Lord I forgive them you forgave me it's all right they didn't mean to do it for father forgive them for they know not what they do can you just let that Spirit just Hallelujah come past the Battle of your mind and touch your heart this morning that's what it's all about church it's the most important thing is you having fellowship with God the way to have fellowship with God is
