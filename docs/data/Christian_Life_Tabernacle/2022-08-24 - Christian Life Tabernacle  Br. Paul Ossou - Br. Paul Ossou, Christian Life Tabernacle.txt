we i give you everyone into your hands and i give myself as a simple instrument in the name of the lord jesus amen as we're so standing uh let's uh open our bibles in the book of john chapter four uh foreign we'll start from [Music] verse 19 to 24. i'll try to he'll try to read in english john chapter 4 john chapter 4 verse 19 the woman saved unto him so i praised that thou art the prophet our father worshipped in this mountain and he said that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus says unto earth woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father you worship you you know not what but but we know what we worship for salvation is for jew but how it cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in the truth amen for the father she kept search to worship him god is spirit and in that worship he must worship him in the spirit in tough and in the truth and like take a bible in revelation revelation chapter 7 from verse 9 to 12. revelation 7. okay chapter nine after this abby here and law a great mutual which no man could number of all nations and kindred and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands and quiet with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sealeth up on the throne and unto the lamb and all the angels stood around about the throne and about the other and four beasts and feel before the throne and their faith and worship god saying hey man blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our god forever and ever amen amen still your opinion father bless once again the reading of your word we give ourselves back to you in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may have your seats if you're quiet i believe we are happy to be gathered in the house of god for about 30 years i'm on his side that i'm welcome i'm meeting him on this side very far from the church back home it's a great privilege for me man the lord bless him richly thank you for the david opportunity may the lord bless by the david who's giving me this opportunity the lord placed a small subject in my heart that i would like to call worship uh [Music] it's a great subject that we gonna spend you you may need to spend a lot of time [Music] [Music] and we know when we talk about worship worship is is a reverence uh that we give to god who are in divinity or to a deity [Music] because god is the object of worship you have a person there was no one to worship him he don't in a test to ricky existed remember then he was the one who existed by himself but because he had attributes and we know how god created man in the garden of eden in the book of genesis that god placed in every man a desire to worship don't come and but every man uses that desire as they please yonaki adult jew they are those that worship god you knock your doll every day to cinema there's those that worship movie stars there's those that worship the cars there's those that worship their homes shacky person every human being has everything has something that they worship is who gives us the breath of life it's that god who gives us everything that we have i i recall a story that i was told calvin kevin put there was a subject that was about uh 65 75 years old there was a a subject or a subject of a king i believe who went to the hospital on your middle they put him on oxygen for about 15 minutes and at the end they gave him a bill when he looked at the bill [Music] the doctor thought that he was crying because he couldn't pay the bill they told him that if you can't pay we'll find a solution he said i'm not crying because of the bill i'm pr i'm i'm crying because god he allowed me to breathe freely for 75 years [Music] but for 15 minutes you give me a bill [Music] he deserves everything that we have he deserved the best place in our lives and we know when we want to talk about worship yeah there's many things in worship because if we don't know who to worship kel can swap not his sincerity regardless of our sincerity celtics were not too born full regardless of our good desire we are idolaters we have to be sure of who we are worshiping the key will keep setting us down okay and who who takes that place in our hearts when we don't know we are on the side look at jesus when he was with his disciples he asked them a question who's who do men say that i am all those people that were saying those things they were religious people they were going to churches they were going in the synagogues but they didn't know who they were worshiping because they didn't know who christ was jesus but it's jesus he looked at his disciples it's not what the other is thinking but you me and me peter said you are the christ the son of the living god and jesus said blessed blessed are you because it's not flesh and blood that revealed that to you but it's my father who's in heaven and you are peter and upon the stone upon this stone i will build my church what was peter it was the revelation of who jesus was for us to be in the worship that jesus said even the gates of hell will not prevail against we have to have the true revelation of who of jesus was a true revelation we have to know exactly who jesus christ is for us the father individual in an individual way quelle what is your personal relation with jesus in the believer's position in christ he did it's a composed word they don't only means to be set aside he was talking about sanctification it it it doesn't mean clean but it doesn't only mean clean but it means sets aside for service service it's to be cleaned and set aside for service the altar sanctified the vase and it sets it aside for service you to the saints which are in at that are at ephesus in the faithful in jesus christ see who's addressing it let me read it quietly now listen to jesus did you paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are in ephesus and to the faithful in jesus christ of fidel and jesus christ to the faithful in christ jesus exterior these letters addressed to those not to the those outside in the world it's not a sermon paul wasn't preaching to those the unsafe he was preaching it to the saved called out they're separated they're set aside and faithful in the call now that's who's addressing it for in jesus position the believer's position is in christ and christ will only meet the believer the believer can only worship christ as he is positioned positionally placed in christ who says he says i don't believe you get it listen let me go another route go gandhi look at no man has the right to worship the lord outside of the body of the lord jesus christ did you know that personally no one has the right to worship if it's not in christ that's why we have to cry out with all our hearts so we can be first in christ to him the true worship accepted that he will accept our worship on christ in christ god only accepts the worship of those that are in christ that's why preachers if there is a burning desire that people may be in christ because outside of christ we cannot worship god wants us to worship him god created us to worship him but to worship him we have to be in christ outside of christ we are rejoicing but we are not worshiping the true worship is under the blood of jesus christ that's why when jesus was standing before the samaritan samaritan the woman of samaria you didn't love yeah it says the hour comes and the hour is here we're the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth what is the truth jesus said sanctify them by that word thy word is truth and for an acceptable worship we have to be sure that we are in the world today there are many denominations and every denomination claims to have the truth buster [Music] if we have ten different answers sword legislation or all of the tens are false strategy enough or there's nine that are not true and there's only one that's true regardless some may say well you know every night i see brother billy in bedford so that means he lives in bedford i see him in fort worth in the morning that means he lives in fort worth they can give arguments but that's not where billy lives is only the one who will say that he lives in norfolk hills that will be telling the truth it's the same thing with the word of god the true worship is under the blood like cain and abel they went to worship cain built this altar he put beautiful things he could he could have brought an argument could you ego that god is great that he deserves whatever i have the the most beautiful he he deserves the beautiful but that was not the provided way but abel who had the revelation he took and today god does not accept a worship outside of the blood of jesus christ and when we speak about the blood of jesus christ we know it's not a chemical makeup says that the blood of jesus christ today is the message of the hour you don't have very taboo in the true worship in truth it's only by the word of the hour and when you get into christ christ will give you his spirit it's a promise it says repent that every one of you be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive lord don't you sentence the gift of the holy ghost it is said it says that promise is for your [Music] in having the holy ghost in us that's what god wants before we can worship so we can be good uh acceptable worshippers the stature that was made was of daniel daniel daniel who was the prophet and they knew who daniel was he's the medal [Music] and he brings sometimes the church to worship almost like his pastor and if they give the impression that what the pastor says is more important than what the word says it's more important than what the messenger said but like the three hebrew children by revelation they knew whom the worship belonged to to god himself men who divorced on christmas we have to be in christ to have us to have this true worship he could lose when she received the revelation of who jesus was she worshipped what was her worship she went back into the city she went to testify that was worshipped [Music] now [Music] i just want to get i just want to get a little bit further if you will excuse me [Music] [Music] together mean you worship an idol you just have to be idol doing nothing go to church [Music] a real born-again man or woman [Music] they're about to do something they are bound to do something you know positive they can't hold their peace equity listen neither be idolaters as there were some of them as it's written the people sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play and worship is also to testify of the goodness of god to testify of this goodness everywhere we go wherever we may god drive that home in this tabernacle this morning i pray the holy ghost will sink this so deep into your heart we ought to give the most earnest heat to the things which we when we see the great jehovah come down and do the things that he does and see him compared scripture by scripture that they will that they are the and just so un i'm concerned we ought to be busy every minute we trying to get to people to christ we ought to be lively stoned we should never be swaffled like we are lose enough we will go up to church and we'll see the lord jesus do something or bless us in such a way and then we'll go back home and say very nice meeting now the preaching of the word we enjoy it nisba but that's not the main thing we know that's the main thing we should not worship the lord just after after we get through the preaching as we usually do just just worship him it's wonderful that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our lives [Music] [Music] if you see some of you ladies see a woman in the wrong i do really worship the lord by taking her by by by her by taking her and saying and saying sister there's a better way than this when you hear a man saying the name of the lord in vain get a chance ali to one side and slip over and take him by the hand and say [Music] he said you there is a better way than this and tell him in a meek gentle way all those things is a worship economy and when we see someone sick they call the doctor and the doctor says on the purify the place no more can be done oh no i don't really [Music] [Music] we can worship the lord in testifying and he's also able to do it even tonight there was an island and when sailors were coming across the sidelines [Music] there were a group of women that would sing songs that were very tantalizing [Music] that the sailors were attracted to go to this island and they were in this island people men that would stay waiting to ambush it so when the sailors will come they would be ambushed and killed but there was a great rover who was supposed to cross across that island and he asked the sailors that were with him that they may tie him to a pole and to put him to put something in his mouth and he plucked the ears of the sailors and as he was crossing him his ears were not plugged the song was so attracting now he was trying to to tell his sailors go on get uh uh go to this place but he couldn't speak well and the sellers couldn't hear him they went to the destination and when they got to the destination as they were uh going around town musicians [Music] it was so wonderful that he loved it and when they were on the way back the sailors asked him a question do you want us to tie you again he says no you don't need to do that so when we get into christ did not tell him all the places you showed there's so many precious things tell a petty to show the summoners but the little things of this world can never attract us anymore we don't need to plug our ears anymore someone to tie our hands [Music] worship can do a lot of things donald said this damn in the old testament the bible tells us about the story of saul don't you live it says in the book of uh once uh first samuel 16. it that when is was tormented by evil spirit they will call this a young child david give it and he will come and he will play the heart he will come and play [Music] worship will cast out the devils a true worship for the worship of of christian musicians justly instead of it uh casting out devils don't see the demon the worship is actually causing devils to dance people will organize big concerts and legends people are dancing they are happy at the end there's not one soul one to christ no devil and today [Music] and years ago we used to find people in deep sincerity and worship and today it's become a big glamour of hollywood sort of music just some kind of trained music it is and woman up on the platform with their clothes tight enough exposed the skin of the skin of the tight enough the skin of the outside it don't sound [Music] and almost making it out an outright ridiculous shame and professing christianity [Music] i wonder if our offering hasn't become kind of a stench in his nose again worship if you pass back in the concert organization i don't believe those concert worshipers that people organize that they worship god people are rejoicing they rejoice their flesh immediately even the the acclimation that they are looking for [Music] but god is looking for sincere worship you know it's a holy worship don't believe the word in the book of kings we have another story there was a king of israel the king of judah and the king of dawn and then after a while they realized they didn't have water when they were trying to find solution the king of judah asked is there no prophet here god is not very prophetic when they went to the prophet elisha elisha was mad israel against the god of israel who was the the ki uh the the son of akam he was mad but he said because of uh jehoshaphat someone who can play the arp and when they brought someone who knew how to play an arp let's pray the spirit of the lord the the the the anointing came down on him worship makes the presence of god tangible god coming down and speaking to each one personally with what concerns you when we worship sincerely when we before we come to church we pray we want god to speak to us foreign the preacher doesn't know what's going on with you he preaches to jokes or the preacher on the side is that just praying for god to give him an inspiration something that could help the people julie donald's feelings god gives him the inspiration but that inspiration could be the answer to your problems that we are doing because you worship because you have contact with him it's like we heard the last time when cornelius was praying on one side god went to peter on the other side eunuch was over here with his bible on the side god went to philip as we worship we are in contact with god god lose our problems when we have a problem god gives us the solution god tells us something god speaks to us but this worship can only be in christ as he said to the woman from samaria in spirit and in truth this the truth we have god has been gracious to us in this end time he gave us the complete revelation of the word but most times we spend a lot of time doing other things then looking into the scriptures this truth that's bringing us to the right worship it's true the bible says the scripture says that let all of them that breathe and god wants to be worshipped through you look in the musician as the musician come there's only situation in the statue of the perfect man will read but one of them says [Music] [Music] uh phillips spoke of the solomon's temple building and the most high don't dwell in the temple made with hands [Music] god dwells in the stature of a man reflecting himself into this that being perfect perfect worship god in us being established manifesto god oh how we could stay on that till you would almost suffocate in today christ has no body on earth except your body christ has no mouth on earth if it's if it's not your mouth god has no feet if it's not your feet if jesus wants to do something on earth today he's obligated to use you it's the fella and that's what worship is and then we become worshipers the the the witnesses because it says in a little while the world will not see me [Music] and otherwise you like the world for the for worship so we can be worshippers wherever we are wherever we go we have to worship god we can worship him in songs not just to listen but to worship him yourself we can worship him in prayer [Music] we can worship him in testimonies we can worship him in living a holy life we can worship him in becoming true witnesses we can become a billboard for god [Music] god wants our worship he created us so we can worship him [Music] and he wants to be to take the first place he wants to be the only one worshiping your life he needs us that we can give him our lives let's bow our heads [Music] oh jesus christ [Music] oh is [Music] i am [Music] is [Music] because [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] we were unworthy to worship we were far from you [Music] you look for us you attracted us to you know [Music] to accept your word [Music] to worship you through our lives to worship you everywhere we go [Music] oh lord as we sing it but i believe that we can say tonight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you just invite us to receive it to accept it so we can be true worshipers virgin upon senior father can you take us take our bodies our spirits lose them our soul [Music] [Music] for this [Music] [Music] that you'll be a personal revelation for each one as we give ourselves back to you in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen let's see [Music] is [Music] he watches [Music] oh [Music] again [Music] amen you know what a beautiful reminder that really our worship starts when we wake up church world kind of has brought us to the place where we think we go to church to worship we go to church to be corrected to receive the word but we worship in the morning when the sun rises that's when we worship our life is a worship what a what a true thing that we really need to remember and really let it set on our heart that that when we least think of it is when we're really worshiping when our real thoughts and our real attitudes and our real emotions are pouring out there from the daily living that's our true worship amen as our brother admonished us let's be true worshipers something that reflects the true message of the hour in our life that really stands forth as a true worship i appreciate that word and and you know many times we we hear the word of god speak of things and we just think it's he's talking about everybody else but you know really i think more often he's talking to each of us individually and receiving that word is what's truth so may god really let that set in our heart deep and i really appreciated the quotes that were read so that's what means a lot to us is you know worship starts when the music stops worship starts when the door is locked on the church house worship starts when it comes from your heart in your life and even the lord said that the father would have us love one another even above loving him that's true worship how can you say that you love god and hate your brother it's impossible so let's just continue to strive and i know when the drums are beaten and the people are shouting it kind of makes you feel little but god's not looking at that he's looking at this still small voice in your heart that wants to put him first so lord richly bless you amen amen once again we want to thank you for your patience our our parking lots tore up but if you notice it's getting a little flatter every day and one day now we need you know we we prayed for dirt and god gave us dirt and i think you know some of it's my fault that i should have recognized that if he give us something he he knew what to give us and i thought oh we better get more dirt well all that dirt out there is my dirt it's not god's dirt it's his dirt but he didn't put it there i did and so now i've asked him to help me get rid of it so you know i don't have no place to go so lord forgive me for my failures and once again you know satan got me in trouble but jesus got me out you know we have a letter on our church door about the weeds and the sidewalk so brother andrew faithfully goes out there and gets all the weeds out for us and you drive down the streets and there's weeds on every sidewalk in town but you know what it's in his hands amen amen if god be for you who can be against you let's go let our light shine amen let's bow our heads our gracious father lord many times we find ourselves in spots that when we miss you that and we don't keep you in mind and we don't place you first and we don't consider that your hand is in things we find our hands in place of yours and we find our outcome instead of your outcome but lord we thank you that you've never stopped being mindful of us you never stop doing things perfectly and lord we worship you for that and lord we find many times that we have to face our own decisions and our own mistakes but lord that doesn't take anything from you because you do all things perfect so many times we have to come to you lord and ask for your help again because we missed your tender kindness but lord i'm thankful that you're a god that doesn't hold us against it lord you just work your way through our will and you'll work through your permissive will to bring it back to your perfect will and lord i want to thank you for it and i want to thank you for all that you do and lord we know that you can do wonderful things and we continue to ask you to do wonderful things father turn our failures into great rewards father if not for us for others lord that you can do a great thing i just ask for your mercy and continue guidance father may we all be aware that our lights our candles set upon a hill and people are watching our actions far above our words and that's what our brother is telling us it's not our words that make worship it's our action that makes worship and father we ask that our actions shed glory upon your son we ask it in jesus name we pray amen god bless you keep us in prayer this week keep our students in prayer keep our brother matthew and brother cosman in prayer as they're over in romania this week trying to share the gospel with young people and look for any other doors that might open form would you do that each one lord glitchly bless you tonight and let's just sing this the song as we go i know that song that we're singing i know the master amen [Music] [Music] may drive me from [Music] amen i know [Music] i know [Music] [Music] god bless you go on peacekeep sunday morning in prayer if the lord carries [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] you
