[8:31] have an expectation in our heart and
[8:33] know of assurance that you're going to
[8:35] be here amongst us Lord. Lord, we heard
[8:38] your word this morning,
[8:41] Lord. Conviction to our hearts, Lord. A
[8:43] nudging to be right back in the center
[8:46] of the road, Lord, that's where we
[8:48] desire to be is in perfect fellowship
[8:50] with you, Lord, where you can
[8:52] communicate with us as one-on-one. And
[8:55] Lord, when we think of the prophet, many
[8:58] times, Lord, we we knew he had a sense
[9:02] of direction because it was lip to ear.
[9:04] He heard directly from the throne of
[9:06] God. And Lord, realizing in this day,
[9:09] it's going to be the same way. Lord,
[9:11] that not only the Holy Spirit you gave
[9:14] us, but Lord, by your word, you quicken
[9:16] it to our hearts by that Holy Spirit,
[9:18] Lord, when we the revealed word, it

[9:22] that's why we're here, Lord, is that we

[9:36] that's the sustaining life. Lord, that's
[9:39] what we have desire of tonight. So Lord,
[9:42] lift us up a little higher. All the
[9:44] needs, all the thoughts, the Lord, even
[9:46] our impressions of what the world's
[9:48] doing to us, Lord, may they all just be
[9:50] cast aside. May we enter into a true
[9:52] fellowship with a heavenly father, the
[9:55] one that quickens life. Lord, we have
[9:58] desires and we have needs. We just place
[10:00] them at your throne. Lord, use us as you

[37:05] God. The treasures of heaven.
[37:16] Worthy is the
[37:19] lamb. As
[37:23] Lord, worthy is the
[37:27] lamb. Our gracious father.
[37:31] [Music]
[37:33] Lord, you're so good to us.
[37:37] You're so worthy,
[37:41] Lord. And one
[37:43] day when
[37:45] we are caught off this place and
[37:49] judgment
[37:51] strikes and we realize all that you've
[37:54] done for
[37:57] us, Lord, the scripture says we'll just
[38:00] fall at your feet.
[38:03] [Music]
[38:04] You're so
[38:08] worthy, Lord. And we come so short of
[38:11] worshiping you the way you should be
[38:14] worshiped, living for you the way that
[38:17] we should.
[38:19] Lord, we just ask that you would extend
[38:22] your grace to us
[38:23] to make us profitable servants. Father,
[38:29] bless the people who have come this
[38:31] evening.
[38:32] We just trust that you'll be their
[38:36] portion tonight. We ask it in your
[38:39] precious and holy name.
[38:43] Amen. Amen. It certainly wonderful. Our
[38:49] our friends, they they they come to
[38:52] visit our brothers and sisters from
[38:54] Brazil. But I think some of them are
[38:57] from Italy and some of them are from
[39:01] Paris. They're
[39:04] France.
[39:06] France and at
[39:09] Italy. So I I thought I just sat back
[39:13] and I thought I'm so blessed. I get to
[39:16] meet believers from all over the world
[39:20] and and to hear the singing and and the
[39:23] praise. And I asked the girls, I said,
[39:25] "Can you sing in English?" They said,
[39:28] "Yes." I said, "Can you sing in French?"
[39:33] Yes. Can I sing? Can you sing in
[39:36] Italian? And there's one of them that
[39:38] could sing in Italian, but she wasn't
[39:41] going to. But anyway, that that just
[39:44] thrills my heart because there's nothing
[39:47] that pleases the Lord like unity.
[39:51] In fact, the scripture says that he
[39:53] would rather you love one another than
[39:57] love him. And when you find people from
[40:00] all over the world that love this
[40:02] message and and love this word and and
[40:06] love the Lord, you know, that's that's a
[40:09] God that's everywhere and that touches
[40:12] lives no matter where they are, you
[40:15] know, and there's people that is willing
[40:18] to serve God no matter how hard it is.
[40:22] So, I I was just thrilled. If you have
[40:25] your Bibles, I'd like to read a little
[40:28] scripture this evening. And
[40:32] uh uh it's it's one that we're uh quite
[40:37] familiar
[40:39] with. It's found in James. I I've I've
[40:43] mentioned it several times here lately.
[40:46] [Music]
[40:48] uh but uh
[40:51] uh James uh chapter 1 in the 22nd
[40:56] verse and uh we're going to play a a
[41:01] little portion of a message uh that's
[41:04] called thinking on our
[41:08] way. Thinking on our way. And uh this
[41:13] struck me because of the title itself of
[41:16] how important it is for us to think on
[41:20] our way. So that we that we're
[41:25] constantly evaluating ourselves and
[41:28] thinking about where we are thinking of
[41:31] what we're going through. I believe this
[41:33] will be a blessing to you. And and James
[41:36] says here, he says, "Be ye doers of the
[41:40] word and not hearers only, deceiving
[41:45] your own selves." And I I thought that
[41:49] was just so uh perfectly fit uh with
[41:54] some of the statements that we read this
[41:57] morning.
[41:59] Um he said, "For if a man be a hearer of
[42:05] the word and not a doer, he is like unto
[42:09] a man beholding his natural face in a
[42:14] glass. For he beholdeth himself, and
[42:19] goeth his way, and straight way forgetth
[42:24] what manner of man he was.
[42:29] For whosoever lookth into the perfect
[42:34] law of
[42:35] liberty, and contin
[42:39] therein, he being not a forgetful
[42:43] hearer, but a doer of the
[42:48] work, this man shall be blessed in his
[42:53] deeds. Amen. That's a
[42:56] basic of the scriptures. So, God bless
[43:00] you. You may be seated this evening.
[43:07] This message was preached uh I believe
[43:11] in
[43:12] um
[43:14] uh 1959
[43:18] uh and uh uh brother Brandham's
[43:23] preparing the people for a healing
[43:27] service and he preaches this message to
[43:31] the
[43:31] people and he and you you will hear him
[43:35] say these things, but he he wants the
[43:39] people and and it's a good heeding for
[43:43] us to take heed to themselves
[43:47] and uh that that is always a such an
[43:52] important part and and I know we talked
[43:55] about that this morning that you can't
[43:58] forget for where you came from and and
[44:01] and we mentioned
[44:05] and we read those quotations and and we
[44:07] spoke on it. But I I want you to hear
[44:10] where the messenger himself goes back
[44:14] and brings to us how important it is
[44:17] that we do that and when you can take
[44:23] these
[44:24] principles because the hour that we live
[44:26] in is is very dark. It's it's getting
[44:32] darker, you know, and as we know, the
[44:34] pope has passed away, and now the world
[44:36] leaders are looking for what what uh man
[44:41] will they pick and and uh and who are
[44:46] they going to to get to be quote unquote
[44:50] the
[44:51] new world spiritual leader? And I think
[44:56] it's such an insult
[44:58] to the living resurrected Jesus
[45:03] that they feel that they can take a
[45:06] carnal man, vote him into office, and
[45:11] then claim that he is here on earth
[45:15] taking the place of the risen savior.
[45:19] That shows you how far the world really
[45:22] has gotten away from what the reality of
[45:27] God is. And so I hope you enjoy it. I
[45:30] know that when we do choose to play a
[45:33] tape that uh for those of you that have
[45:38] to listen to interpreter or uh
[45:42] uh you know don't know the English may
[45:46] be as fluent as those that were raised
[45:49] in it. It's difficult but I believe the
[45:52] Lord will touch you in in a manner. And
[45:57] so if you if you have your Bibles, I I
[46:00] believe that uh Brother Brandham's going
[46:03] to read a scripture found out of the
[46:06] same psalm that we read this morning.
[46:08] Psalm
[46:09] 119 verse 59. We won't stand for that
[46:14] because we have stood for the reading of
[46:16] the word. But I want you just to listen.
[46:19] It's 40 minutes and then our service
[46:22] will come to an end. But just sit back
[46:25] and relax for 40 minutes and and try to
[46:32] grasp the whole picture of what he's
[46:35] talking about, what the importance is
[46:38] and what it's important to the believer,
[46:41] the things that the believer should
[46:43] hearts should be set on. And I just
[46:47] think that you can take this word and
[46:50] and uh set in your heart. I don't maybe
[46:53] you have never heard this tape before
[46:55] but again I think it's wonderful. It's
[46:58] called thinking on our ways and and and
[47:03] uh we you know the way that we do
[47:06] things. So as we go along our way we
[47:12] think on our ways the ways we are the
[47:17] ways we respond. And uh and I just hope
[47:22] that you will see the importance of it.
[47:24] And I know you'll enjoy the word of God
[47:27] because I believe you're hearing from
[47:29] the voice of God a a messenger and a
[47:33] prophet that the
[47:37] world never realized. And I I heard a
[47:41] man today give a
[47:42] testimony and he said
[47:47] uh and it was uh brother Bosworth
[47:49] talking and and K uh uh uh brother
[47:54] Gordon Lindsay and uh some of those uh
[47:58] men, Brother Baxter, and those men were
[48:02] all testifying how that brother Brandham
[48:05] never spoke anything and never was under
[48:09] discernment.
[48:10] and made one
[48:12] mistake. And they said it just it wasn't
[48:15] that way
[48:17] uh only when he was under that
[48:21] anointing. But they said even outside of
[48:25] it uh in his daily life that the things
[48:29] that he spoke were always true. And of
[48:32] course their conclusion was is that he
[48:36] was a genuine prophet but that he should
[48:41] have never handled
[48:43] doctrine. And I
[48:46] thought if I had my choice of listening
[48:50] to doctrine from a genuine prophet or
[48:56] just a preacher, I think I'd take the
[48:59] prophet. I I don't know about you, but I
[49:03] I just sat back and I smiled. They said,
[49:05] "Well, you know, Brother Brandham got
[49:07] off on his doctrine, you know, and uh I
[49:11] I thought, yeah, he so he did all these
[49:14] wonderful signs and wonders, never
[49:17] failed, never made a mistake, and you
[49:20] couldn't trust what he taught, and yet
[49:23] you want me to believe that your
[49:25] interpretation is right." I'll tell you,
[49:28] those men weren't thinking right along
[49:31] the way and they weren't thinking of the
[49:34] their own ways. And so, it's important
[49:37] to think about how you think. I trust
[49:40] you'll enjoy this 40 minutes. God richly
[49:43] bless you. Thank you for coming out
[49:45] tonight. Our friends visiting, thank you
[49:48] for singing for us. Uh, I hope that you
[49:51] like our town enough to come back again
[49:54] and be with us more often. Lord richly
[49:57] bless you. God bless you this evening as
[49:59] we listen to our
[50:03] messenger. Bless you each.
[50:08] Just for a short
[50:11] time, I've thought on some scripture as
[50:14] I come up this afternoon and it's found
[50:18] over in Psalms
[50:21] 119 Psalm and the the 59th
[50:26] verse I wish to read.
[50:31] thy thought on my
[50:33] ways. I turn my feet to thy
[50:39] testimonies. And tonight, if I should
[50:41] call it a
[50:43] subject, I'd like to speak on the
[50:45] subject thinking on our ways.
[50:51] You know, David, I'm told at the time of
[50:56] the writing of this
[50:58] psalm that he had been in
[51:01] trouble. And David was just a man like
[51:05] all of us that he had his ups and downs
[51:08] and his
[51:10] differences. And he'd been very much in
[51:13] trouble.
[51:15] God has not
[51:17] promised to go through life any
[51:21] believer to go through without
[51:24] troubles. But he has promised grace
[51:28] sufficient to take care of these
[51:32] troubles. That's what thrills my
[51:35] heart is to know that his grace is
[51:39] sufficient.
[51:41] all of our depths and and troubles and
[51:46] frustrations. Yet God has promised to
[51:50] see us
[51:51] through. That's just as much as we could
[51:53] asked of him, knowing that he knows the
[51:57] road. As Joshua said to Israel, "You
[52:01] have not traveled this way before. We
[52:04] haven't traveled it. So he knows the way
[52:07] and can point it out.
[52:11] I can just see David his house is being
[52:15] watched. Saul and his army was watching
[52:20] his house to kill him.
[52:23] I can see David as he
[52:26] nervously ringing his hands and walking
[52:30] back and forth to and fro through his
[52:34] room, looking out the windows and
[52:37] watching every little move in the
[52:40] bush. For he didn't know what time that
[52:43] a arrow might whistle through the air
[52:46] right to his own
[52:50] bosom. And it was then that these words
[52:54] come to
[52:56] him. As I thought on my
[52:59] ways, I turn my feet to thy
[53:05] testimonies. It's usually when a man is
[53:08] in trouble is when he goes to thinking
[53:11] about
[53:12] God. It's too bad that we have to wait
[53:16] to get in trouble before we think about
[53:19] him.
[53:20] But I've heard many peoples that several
[53:24] who has claimed that they was not
[53:27] believers that they did not believe
[53:29] there was of
[53:31] God. But I've noticed that same people
[53:36] let them get hurt or in
[53:39] trouble. As we're told, Bob Anger
[53:42] saw as he was dying in his hospital
[53:46] room, he screamed, "Oh, God, if that be
[53:50] a God, have mercy on
[53:53] me." You might say some great things
[53:56] while you're feeling good. But when
[53:59] death comes knocking at the door, you're
[54:01] going to change your opinion.
[54:06] In my length of days, I have seen many
[54:09] such men who didn't care for church and
[54:13] didn't care for God and and nothing that
[54:16] was right. But just let them get in
[54:18] trouble and the doctor says there's a
[54:20] cancer eating you to pieces. They'll go
[54:23] to hunting for somebody to pray for him
[54:26] right quick.
[54:28] God has a way of making you recognize
[54:31] him.
[54:34] A few months ago, I was talking to the
[54:37] honorable judge of our city who is a
[54:39] bosom friend of mine that comes quite
[54:42] regular to the tabernacle when I'm
[54:45] there. Judge Butoff of Jeffersonville,
[54:50] Indiana. And I was speaking to him about
[54:54] a mother's boy that was up there for
[54:58] stealing a car.
[55:00] And I talked to the boy at length and he
[55:03] put his arms around me and he said,
[55:05] "Brother
[55:07] Brandon, if you'll get the judge to
[55:10] pardon me one more
[55:13] time," he said, "I'll I'll promise you
[55:16] I'll I'll take my place in the Sunday
[55:19] school and I I'll be there every time
[55:22] the door opens."
[55:26] Well, I said, "Son, I asked the judge
[55:28] lots of favors and but you know, he's
[55:31] under oath and he's he's got to do
[55:34] justice, but I'll go talk to
[55:37] him." And I said, "Judge, your honor,
[55:41] sir, could it be possible that you could
[55:44] pardon this young man again? He told me
[55:47] he'd such and such things he'
[55:50] do." I'll never forget what the judge
[55:53] said. He's raised up from behind his
[55:55] desk and walked around over to where I
[55:58] was and tucked me by the hand. And I
[56:00] stood up, put his arms over my shoulder,
[56:02] and he said,
[56:04] "Billy." He said, "Every man that I
[56:07] sentenced to prison wants to become a
[56:11] preacher. He's in
[56:13] trouble." But said, "I've seen many of
[56:16] them be pardoned and serve their time.
[56:18] They forget all about it when they get
[56:21] free again. It's usually in the time of
[56:26] trouble that man seek for
[56:31] God. Israel, when Israel would get in
[56:35] trouble, then she would seek for
[56:38] God. when the Philistines were on them
[56:42] and when the the armies of the Syrians
[56:45] would be encamped about, then they would
[56:48] turn out and get the ark of the covenant
[56:50] and bring it out and sing songs and
[56:54] offer
[56:57] sacrifices. But then when God blessed
[57:01] them and their needs was all supplied,
[57:05] then right back like a hawk to its wala
[57:09] and a dog to its
[57:12] vomit. Just seems like that's the trend
[57:16] of human
[57:17] beings. I have to be pushed into
[57:21] something, pushed into worship the Lord.
[57:26] If we would sit down tonight and figure
[57:29] what is any greater
[57:32] thing than eternal life.
[57:36] Amen. Tell me what kind of a price that
[57:40] you could put on eternal
[57:43] life. If you were dying tonight with a
[57:46] hundred billion dollar in your pocket,
[57:49] it could not touch eternal life.
[57:53] You can't buy
[57:55] it. Money is filth in the sight of God
[58:00] if it isn't used to his kingdom or to
[58:02] some good
[58:04] cause. What do you think would happen
[58:06] tonight and Wall Street? There is places
[58:10] in the world that I've
[58:12] preached that's so primitive until they
[58:15] hunt on the seashores for little muscle
[58:18] shells, little curves in them and that's
[58:21] what they use for
[58:23] money. And then I preached in places to
[58:26] where they taken the teeth out of
[58:29] animals and would bring them and
[58:31] exchange them and they are currency.
[58:36] What do you think tonight that Wall
[58:39] Street would think if these men would
[58:41] come to their markets and place muscle
[58:45] shells and stinking teeth out of animals
[58:48] and want to exchange them for our gold
[58:52] bonds while they would say, "Get those
[58:55] stinking things and get out of
[58:58] here." That's what our money and our
[59:01] greatness is before God. We can't buy
[59:05] it.
[59:08] Amen. God so good till he gives it to us
[59:12] without money or without price and we
[59:15] turn it down.
[59:18] It doesn't even sound sane, does it?
[59:22] I was speaking to my wife a few days ago
[59:26] after I had celebrated my 50th
[59:30] birthday and I said to her, "Honey, I'm
[59:33] getting
[59:34] old." And this Bible I was placed back
[59:38] into the hands of my boy
[59:42] someday. And I was speaking to her
[59:45] about how when we were
[59:48] young and I said, "Yeah, we've been
[59:50] married all these years and it seems
[59:52] like it is just
[59:55] yesterday." And I said, "Life is pass,
[59:58] but honey, listen to this."
[1:00:02] I said, "If God would come to this
[1:00:06] room and would
[1:00:08] say, I'm going to give you a
[1:00:11] choice to live another 50 years, and
[1:00:15] you're going to go through poverty and
[1:00:19] sickness and troubles and be rejected
[1:00:23] and despised and have a terrible time.
[1:00:28] You're going to have to beg every meal
[1:00:30] that you eat in the next 50 years. But
[1:00:33] at the end of that 50 years, you'll have
[1:00:36] eternal life. But I'm going to give you
[1:00:39] the whole
[1:00:41] world and all the money and turn you
[1:00:44] back to 18 years old and make you king
[1:00:46] over all the world for a million
[1:00:50] years. But at the end of the million
[1:00:53] years, then that's all I'd say. Lord,
[1:00:56] let me beg or anything. Just give me
[1:01:00] eternal life.
[1:01:03] For there will be a time when there
[1:01:06] would be no more of me. But as long as
[1:01:09] there is a God in heaven if I got
[1:01:11] eternal life, I'll always live with him.
[1:01:15] When the ends of times pass, we live
[1:01:18] on because we are a part of God, sons
[1:01:22] and daughters of him. And it's a shame
[1:01:25] that we have to be pressed into places
[1:01:29] uh to make us accept
[1:01:31] it. What an enemy we have. Yes, an arch
[1:01:36] enemy. And it's good to turn to the Lord
[1:01:40] before these troubles
[1:01:43] strike. Now, most the time it is that is
[1:01:46] troubles that makes the people come to
[1:01:48] the Lord. But we should come before they
[1:01:51] strike.
[1:01:54] Now for instance like uh in the days of
[1:01:58] the of any Christian that we want to
[1:02:02] place before us. I was thinking of a
[1:02:05] story some time ago up into the north
[1:02:08] woods. There was a a colored boy. He was
[1:02:12] about uh 25 years old and just a kind of
[1:02:16] a floater we call him.
[1:02:20] And he was a gentleman, but not a a
[1:02:24] fugitive or renegade, but he was a he
[1:02:27] was a gentleman, but just a guy that
[1:02:29] likes to float around. No place to go
[1:02:32] and nothing to do. That's a horrible way
[1:02:36] to take
[1:02:37] life. I gave a man his dinner some time
[1:02:40] ago. Was a bum. And I said, "When did
[1:02:43] you start this?" Said about 20 years
[1:02:47] ago. I said, "Where are you going?" He
[1:02:50] said,
[1:02:51] "Nowhere." I said, "Then where did you
[1:02:54] come from?" He said, "Oh,
[1:02:55] nowhere." I said, "How long do you
[1:02:58] expect to keep this up?" Oh, he said, "I
[1:03:00] don't
[1:03:01] know." No, no
[1:03:04] ambitions. Why the Christian ought to be
[1:03:07] the most ambitious person in the world?
[1:03:11] Amen. Bring this glorious gospel of
[1:03:14] eternal life to a dying and perishing
[1:03:18] world.
[1:03:20] We should be up and at it. This young
[1:03:23] man drifted into the north woods to a
[1:03:26] country I used to hunt in many years
[1:03:28] ago. Deer
[1:03:31] hunt. And
[1:03:32] when the he wanted a job, he didn't have
[1:03:35] any money and and the woods boss Harding
[1:03:39] to help the old colored
[1:03:41] cook. And one night after the supper was
[1:03:44] over and the dishes was washed, they
[1:03:47] slept in a little back room with just a
[1:03:49] little canvas between
[1:03:52] them. And all of a sudden, the young
[1:03:54] fell said, "I was
[1:03:56] awakened and I heard two men standing by
[1:03:59] my window and there was the most
[1:04:02] mournful sound I ever heard."
[1:04:06] He said, "I threw back the blanket from
[1:04:08] off my face and jumped up quickly and
[1:04:11] said the room was just constantly in a
[1:04:14] light from the flashes of
[1:04:17] lightning." He said, "I heard those two
[1:04:20] men say, "Well, Jim, we better go back
[1:04:24] down to the camp because we may not be
[1:04:27] here in 10 more minutes. That twister's
[1:04:31] headed this way."
[1:04:33] that he jumped up and he looked out the
[1:04:36] window in time to see that great snake
[1:04:39] like of a circle of clouds carrying up
[1:04:43] the
[1:04:45] mountains, carrying the trees and
[1:04:47] twisting them into the air when he seen
[1:04:50] the bodies of full trees flying hundreds
[1:04:53] of feet into the air heading right
[1:04:56] towards the
[1:04:58] cabin. And he said he heard something
[1:05:01] knocking on the
[1:05:02] canvas. And the old cook in the other
[1:05:06] side of the canvas said,
[1:05:08] "Son, come over on this side. I've got a
[1:05:12] lantern
[1:05:13] lip." Said, he went over to the other
[1:05:16] side. And the old cook had a lantern
[1:05:19] lip and said, she said to him, "Do you
[1:05:22] know the Lord Jesus as your savior?"
[1:05:28] He said, "No, ma'am. I never prayed in
[1:05:30] my
[1:05:31] life." Well, said, "You'd better be
[1:05:35] praying
[1:05:36] for we may be swept off the earth in the
[1:05:40] next few minutes."
[1:05:43] He said that godly, saintly old woman
[1:05:46] knelt down there by that soap box and
[1:05:50] prayed just as calm as she could
[1:05:54] be and said I couldn't pray. He said
[1:05:58] every time I start to say dear God said
[1:06:01] about that time a tree would lamb
[1:06:03] against the
[1:06:04] cabin. He said to me, he said,
[1:06:07] "Reverend, I was too scared to
[1:06:12] pray." And he said, "I got this much
[1:06:16] out, sir. If you'll just spare me, I'll
[1:06:21] come to you sometime when there's no
[1:06:23] storm
[1:06:25] on." He said, "That's why I'm here
[1:06:28] tonight.
[1:06:30] There's no storm going on, but that
[1:06:33] promise in my heart, in the memories of
[1:06:36] that hour still
[1:06:39] lingers. It's right to come to God while
[1:06:42] you're saint and in your right
[1:06:44] mind. When everything is
[1:06:47] quiet, when you got time to think and
[1:06:50] come sainly and soberly, that's the time
[1:06:53] to come to God.
[1:06:56] Amen. For then he's the present help in
[1:07:00] a time of trouble. He said he'd never
[1:07:03] forget how that old saint just so
[1:07:06] reverently could pray as smoothly and
[1:07:08] calmly when that storm was going
[1:07:11] on. It means something to know God to be
[1:07:15] ready for it when it comes. Then he's a
[1:07:18] present help in time of trouble.
[1:07:20] I remember not too many years ago in the
[1:07:23] North
[1:07:25] Woods, my mother's an half Indian off
[1:07:28] the reservation down here and I thought
[1:07:31] I was too much of a woodsman to ever be
[1:07:35] lost and I just got married and this
[1:07:38] looked like taking advantage of my wife
[1:07:40] but on a honeymoon I took her on a
[1:07:41] hunting
[1:07:42] trip and I she was staying in a little
[1:07:45] lean to it. We come in that morning. I
[1:07:47] said, I believe there is some bear track
[1:07:52] I noticed coming up. I said, I'll go
[1:07:54] track that bear and we'll be back about
[1:07:56] noon. It's about 9:00 at morning. I got
[1:08:00] on the trail of that bear and I was led
[1:08:02] all over the
[1:08:04] countries. Finally, I lost him and I was
[1:08:06] coming up a little draw and I noticed a
[1:08:09] deer. I said, "That'll be a nice one to
[1:08:11] take home." So I shot the deer, started
[1:08:13] back, and I noticed the clouds had beun
[1:08:15] to get low. Fog coming in. If anyone
[1:08:19] knows what it means to be in the
[1:08:20] mountains, when fog comes, you just have
[1:08:22] to house in. You don't know where you're
[1:08:25] going. I knew I had to get back. She'd
[1:08:28] never been in the woods. And I started
[1:08:30] hurrying and I walked and walked up a
[1:08:33] little stream. And I said, I know now
[1:08:35] that this stream where it makes the
[1:08:37] bend, that's where I cross over, go down
[1:08:39] on the other side. And I knew how to
[1:08:41] come out. Well, I thought looked like I
[1:08:43] ought to be that bin and I stopped. Now
[1:08:45] I begin to persspire and I was standing
[1:08:48] right by the side of my deer again. I
[1:08:50] come right back around to it. I did that
[1:08:53] three
[1:08:54] times. Now the Indian calls that the
[1:08:56] death walk. He's walking a circle. But
[1:08:59] where do you go
[1:09:01] out? Well, I seen I was lost, but I
[1:09:04] didn't want to admit it. That's the way
[1:09:06] human beings are. They don't want to
[1:09:08] admit they're
[1:09:11] wrong. There's no doubt men and women in
[1:09:13] this building tonight are out in radio
[1:09:15] land that's not right with God, but you
[1:09:18] don't want to admit it. You're covering
[1:09:21] it up by going to church or saying some
[1:09:24] kind of a prayer or a creed that isn't
[1:09:27] getting right with God. being born
[1:09:31] again, becoming a son or a daughter of
[1:09:36] God. That's God's requirements.
[1:09:39] Be right with him. And then I walked
[1:09:44] farther and I said, "Oh, I'm too good a
[1:09:46] woodsman to be lost." I said, "Now, Bill
[1:09:48] Brandham, you just come to yourself.
[1:09:51] You're foolish. You know how to get out
[1:09:52] of here. Go on." And it's so foggy. I
[1:09:55] couldn't see nothing. And I started
[1:09:58] walking. And after a while, I kept
[1:10:00] hearing a
[1:10:01] word. I'm a very present help in the
[1:10:04] time of trouble.
[1:10:07] I walked a little further and it got so
[1:10:11] I could hear it speaking
[1:10:13] out. The Lord is a very present help in
[1:10:17] a time of
[1:10:18] trouble. Well, I thought I knelt down
[1:10:21] and I said, "Lord, I'm admitting that I
[1:10:24] am lost.
[1:10:27] I'm not worthy to
[1:10:29] live. But my wife and Billy, a little
[1:10:33] something
[1:10:35] baby, they're worthy of living,
[1:10:38] Lord. Don't let them
[1:10:41] perish. And I prayed and I got up and I
[1:10:44] said, "Well, now I'll have to choose the
[1:10:46] best that I know how." So I started
[1:10:48] walking straight ahead. Thought I'm
[1:10:50] going right exactly right. The winds in
[1:10:53] my face. And just then it seemed that a
[1:10:56] hand laid on my
[1:10:58] shoulder. And I turned to see who it was
[1:11:01] touched me. And I looked up in a little
[1:11:03] place cleared in the skies and I saw
[1:11:06] Hurricane Mountain in the Rers tower
[1:11:08] where I was going to. Oh, what a
[1:11:11] feeling. He's a very present help in the
[1:11:15] time of trouble.
[1:11:17] be right with me now that when death or
[1:11:19] sickness or whatever it is strikes you,
[1:11:22] then he's a present help. I never forget
[1:11:25] I pointed my hand straight towards the
[1:11:28] the way I was going. If I have went the
[1:11:31] way my choice was, I'd have went into
[1:11:33] Canada. But I was went this way to my
[1:11:37] right where he turned me around and I
[1:11:40] held up my hands. It started getting
[1:11:41] darker. I walked for about three
[1:11:44] hours almost dark and then it got dark.
[1:11:48] I couldn't have seen the tower line that
[1:11:49] run from the tower down to the lean tube
[1:11:51] about six miles and I knew I was on
[1:11:54] Hurricane Mountain. I couldn't change my
[1:11:57] course right up over the slabs. Oh, it's
[1:11:59] a rough road when you're trying to go
[1:12:01] right sometimes, but it's right. It's
[1:12:04] the only way out.
[1:12:07] I walked at it got dark. And I held up
[1:12:10] my hands until they felt like they were
[1:12:13] going to
[1:12:14] drop. Oh, they were cold in the snow of
[1:12:18] blowing. And I thought if I could only
[1:12:21] touch that
[1:12:22] line, so
[1:12:25] dark and I'd stop and I'll rest my hands
[1:12:28] a moment, keep my direction set right,
[1:12:30] then raise my hands and start again.
[1:12:33] You'll never know how I felt when my
[1:12:35] head touched that line.
[1:12:38] I know I could hold on to that line. I
[1:12:41] help put it up there that spring. I
[1:12:43] could hold on to that line and right at
[1:12:45] the end of the road of that line where
[1:12:46] it stopped waited my loved ones.
[1:12:50] That was a great thing.
[1:12:52] But I was lost worse than that. One
[1:12:55] day when a loving hand touched me by the
[1:12:58] heart and turned me towards Calvary, I
[1:13:02] held my hands up until something got a
[1:13:04] hold of me. Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] I've held on to it reverently, walking
[1:13:11] quietly and slowly. Someday at the end
[1:13:14] of this line will wait my loved ones and
[1:13:16] my
[1:13:18] Lord. He's a present help in time of
[1:13:21] trouble. He would Job in his troubles.
[1:13:24] Before his troubles struck him, he said,
[1:13:27] "Preventure my children might have
[1:13:29] sinned, so I'll offer a burnt offering
[1:13:32] for them." He made preparations whether
[1:13:35] if anything did
[1:13:37] happen. When he began to think of the
[1:13:40] ways of his children, they might have
[1:13:42] went perverse to his teaching. And let
[1:13:45] me say this with reverence and with
[1:13:47] respect. If these American mothers and
[1:13:50] fathers would put more time praying for
[1:13:52] their children like Job did, there'd be
[1:13:55] less juvenile delinquency.
[1:13:57] The trouble of it is our modern American
[1:14:00] mothers and fathers lead them to
[1:14:02] drinking and to card playing and to
[1:14:04] cigarette smoking and things of that
[1:14:07] sort, which makes juvenile delinquency.
[1:14:10] It really isn't juvenile delinquency.
[1:14:12] It's parent delinquency.
[1:14:15] Neglecting to come to God and find him.
[1:14:18] Then trouble
[1:14:19] strikes. When trouble struck Job, he had
[1:14:23] offered the burnt offering. come upon
[1:14:25] the only grounds that God will receive a
[1:14:27] believer. That's on the burnt sacrifice
[1:14:29] and the
[1:14:30] blood. So when trouble struck his house,
[1:14:33] God was a present help in a time of
[1:14:36] trouble. When they had accused him of
[1:14:38] being a secret sinner, he knew that he
[1:14:40] was righteous with God because he met
[1:14:43] God's requirements. Then he could say,
[1:14:45] "I know my redeemer liveth and at the
[1:14:48] last day he'll stand on the earth though
[1:14:50] the skinworms destroys this body yet my
[1:14:53] flesh I'll see God." He why? He knew
[1:14:56] that he had come God's provided way. He
[1:14:59] didn't come by the membership of his
[1:15:01] church. He come by God's
[1:15:05] sacrifice. That was what God required.
[1:15:09] Certainly, it was David when he was
[1:15:11] sitting on his
[1:15:13] throne and Nathan the prophet come in
[1:15:15] and been begin to reveal the secrets of
[1:15:18] his heart that David thought on his
[1:15:21] sinful ways. Yet, he was a good man,
[1:15:24] been a man after God's own heart, but he
[1:15:26] was living with Uriah's
[1:15:28] wife. And it was wrong.
[1:15:31] And when David, the king of Israel,
[1:15:34] thought on his ways, it drove him to
[1:15:36] sackcloth in
[1:15:38] prayer because he thought on his sinful
[1:15:42] ways, drove him to his knees to
[1:15:46] pray. It was Jacob who had deceived his
[1:15:50] brethren, lived luxuriously down with
[1:15:52] his father-in-law with camels and sheep
[1:15:54] and
[1:15:55] everything. One time there come a
[1:15:57] yearning to go back home.
[1:16:00] go back to church and go back to the
[1:16:03] right thing again. And he started with
[1:16:06] his wives and his children and his
[1:16:09] flocks. But when he heard that Esau was
[1:16:12] coming, he thought on his
[1:16:15] ways, on his ways of
[1:16:18] deceiving, he deceived Esau. And he
[1:16:21] knowed Esau was on his way to meeting
[1:16:23] him. And there's so many Christians
[1:16:26] tonight, professed Christians, that's
[1:16:28] only deceiving the thing that they're
[1:16:30] confessing to me.
[1:16:33] Death will come creeping around the door
[1:16:35] one of these days. You'll go to thinking
[1:16:37] on your ways
[1:16:39] and that Jacob thought on his ways. He
[1:16:43] stayed the other side of the brook and
[1:16:45] prayed all night
[1:16:48] long. If Christians would think on their
[1:16:50] ways and would drive them to prayer and
[1:16:53] to
[1:16:54] repentance, it would be different. The
[1:16:57] world would be different. The church
[1:16:58] would be different. The people would be
[1:17:00] different. It was Moses going down an
[1:17:04] old familiar path one morning as he
[1:17:06] began to think on his ways. God had
[1:17:09] called him to be a deliverer of Israel.
[1:17:11] What did he do? Went in his own way
[1:17:14] instead of taking God's way and murdered
[1:17:16] a man. and what he was thinking on his
[1:17:20] ways. And what a failure he had been in
[1:17:22] living in luxury had traded the ministry
[1:17:26] of the Lord for a sheep herder's
[1:17:29] job. No doubt somewhere down over the
[1:17:33] airwaves or in this building tonight.
[1:17:35] I'm preaching to a man, a man and woman
[1:17:38] who God called him to the ministry and
[1:17:41] took a easier road because it had more
[1:17:43] money in it. Amen. There wasn't you're
[1:17:46] hurting sheep when you ought to be
[1:17:48] preaching the gospel.
[1:17:51] Amen. So easy to take that way of
[1:17:55] luxury. But while Moses was tanking on
[1:17:57] his way, a burning bush appeared in the
[1:18:01] way. God sent burning bushes
[1:18:05] tonight. Every man or woman that would
[1:18:07] dare to think on their ways, take
[1:18:10] inventory of your life. How are you
[1:18:12] living? What if Jesus would come
[1:18:14] tonight? Think on the
[1:18:18] ways. It was Peter who was standing
[1:18:21] warming himself by the enemy's farm,
[1:18:24] cursing, denying Jesus when he heard
[1:18:28] that old rooster crow the third
[1:18:30] time. It made him think on his
[1:18:34] ways the way he had been treating
[1:18:37] Jesus. He'd been called to the ministry.
[1:18:40] He'd been called to serve God.
[1:18:43] And it took a rooster to make him think
[1:18:46] on his ways.
[1:18:48] Brother, sister, tonight it's about
[1:18:51] crowing time for a lot of us that would
[1:18:53] make us wake up and think on our ways.
[1:18:56] Amen.
[1:18:57] the way that we are treating the Lord
[1:19:00] Jesus in this new modern age of all
[1:19:04] selfstyled and polished religions. It's
[1:19:08] time to think on our ways and come back
[1:19:11] to the old pathway that Jesus Christ
[1:19:14] tried when he was here on earth a way of
[1:19:19] sacrifice. Think on our ways. It was
[1:19:22] Judas's carrot when the high priest
[1:19:26] began to count out 30 pieces of silver.
[1:19:29] And when he heard the tinkling of that
[1:19:31] silver, Judas thought on his
[1:19:34] ways how that he had sold out Jesus for
[1:19:38] 30 pieces of silver, took a rope, and
[1:19:40] hung himself. I wonder tonight if many
[1:19:44] people here listening tonight hasn't
[1:19:47] cheated their neighbor just a little
[1:19:48] bit, done a little crooked deal. I pray
[1:19:52] that if that be the case that you'll
[1:19:54] hear the tickling of that money till
[1:19:56] it'll send you to your knees of
[1:19:59] repentance. Many of you hold out God's
[1:20:02] part. Spend it for things I hear for
[1:20:04] whiskey,
[1:20:06] tobacco,
[1:20:07] cigarettes, gasoline to ride around on
[1:20:10] when it belongs in the house of the
[1:20:12] Lord.
[1:20:15] It's your solemn duty to give it. Think
[1:20:19] on your ways.
[1:20:22] Think about it. 30 pieces of silver. It
[1:20:26] was a Roman soldier after he had pierced
[1:20:29] his side and had seen water and
[1:20:32] blood, seen the sun go down in the
[1:20:35] middle of the day and the rocks went out
[1:20:38] from the
[1:20:41] mountains. After he saw this that he
[1:20:44] began to take on his wage and smote
[1:20:47] himself on the chest and
[1:20:50] cried. Truly that was the son of God.
[1:20:56] Waited a long
[1:20:58] time. But he was thinking on his ways. I
[1:21:01] wonder tonight in the radio land and in
[1:21:04] this visible audience if many of you
[1:21:07] aren't taking on your ways the things
[1:21:10] that you have done and the things that
[1:21:12] you've left undone. It's just as great
[1:21:15] to leave undone as it is to do something
[1:21:17] it's wrong. For he that knoweth to do
[1:21:20] good and doeth it not to him it's sin.
[1:21:22] Amen. If you're thinking on your ways,
[1:21:26] there's one thing that I'm sure I can
[1:21:28] introduce to you. As a poet said, there
[1:21:31] is a fountain filled with blood drawn
[1:21:35] from Emanuel's
[1:21:36] veins. Where sinners plunge beneath the
[1:21:40] flood lose all their guilty
[1:21:42] stain, that dying feet rejoice to see
[1:21:45] that fountain in his day. There may I,
[1:21:49] though vile as he wash all my sins away.
[1:21:53] The old Salvation Army song, they used
[1:21:56] to sing this. Oh, precious is that flow
[1:22:01] that makes me white as snow. No other
[1:22:03] fountain I know. Nothing but the blood
[1:22:06] of Jesus.
[1:22:08] I know no other cleansing. I know no
[1:22:11] other way, nothing else that I know to
[1:22:14] do, only to confess your sins, be right
[1:22:18] with God, clean up little bitty things.
[1:22:21] It's a little fox that spirals the
[1:22:23] grapes.
[1:22:25] Amen. The other day I had a confession
[1:22:27] to make
[1:22:29] myself. I was in my home and and some
[1:22:32] people had been bothering me day after
[1:22:35] day and a big office and they were just
[1:22:38] had me so weary. I I didn't know what to
[1:22:41] do. Finally, I was felt like the world
[1:22:44] was pulling the top of my head out. I
[1:22:46] was so nervous and I couldn't leave to
[1:22:48] go to meetings and meetings waiting.
[1:22:51] Hundreds of Christians waiting to be
[1:22:52] prayed for. Sick children
[1:22:56] crying. Mothers and fathers in hotels
[1:22:58] and motel with their sick and dying. And
[1:23:01] I had to stay in a office with an
[1:23:04] attorney on a case for somebody. And
[1:23:07] they were pushing me right and left and
[1:23:09] up and down. I didn't know what to do. I
[1:23:12] was answering everything. They take me
[1:23:14] right back over it again.
[1:23:16] And I went home to eat my dinner. They
[1:23:18] told me I could be off that afternoon. I
[1:23:20] was going to catch up on some of my sick
[1:23:22] calls. And there
[1:23:25] was the phone ranging. It was my private
[1:23:27] phone. I have an answering service. My
[1:23:30] wife went to the phone and she picked up
[1:23:31] the receiver and she answered and when
[1:23:35] she did, she helped her hand over the
[1:23:36] top of the phone. She said,
[1:23:39] "Billy, it's them attorneys again."
[1:23:43] Oh, I said I can't go through it another
[1:23:45] half a day. I said, I've told them that
[1:23:48] same thing over and over and over and
[1:23:50] over, day in and out, day in and out,
[1:23:52] and then they're going to call me again.
[1:23:54] I said, I can't do it. I'll I just So
[1:23:58] many people waiting to be prayed for. I
[1:24:00] said, tell them I'm not in here and run
[1:24:02] around behind the
[1:24:06] house. And when I come back in a few
[1:24:09] minutes, my precious little wife
[1:24:11] standing in the door, she looked at me
[1:24:14] and I know what she meant when her eyes
[1:24:16] caught mine. She said, "Billy, was that
[1:24:19] just exactly
[1:24:21] right? You know how you like to justify
[1:24:23] yourself?" I said, "Oh, sure. I wasn't
[1:24:26] in here." She said, "But you was when
[1:24:28] the phone
[1:24:30] rang." I said, "But I wasn't in here
[1:24:32] when you told him that." I said, "That
[1:24:34] was all right." She said, "Billy, are
[1:24:36] you sure of that?" Oh, I I I I said, "I
[1:24:41] think so." And I started out. I got my
[1:24:44] hat. I went out to make a sick call. I
[1:24:47] went into the room to pray for a little
[1:24:48] sick baby. Man, I've been waiting a long
[1:24:51] time with this baby. And I went in to
[1:24:53] pray for it. And when I started to lay
[1:24:55] my hands on
[1:24:57] it, something said to me, "Can you lay
[1:25:00] your lying hands on that child?"
[1:25:03] The Bible said in 1 John 3:21, "If our
[1:25:07] hearts condemn us not, then we have
[1:25:10] confidence in God."
[1:25:12] That's what's the matter today that the
[1:25:14] Christian church can't get anything done
[1:25:16] is because our hearts are condemning us
[1:25:20] with unconfessed sins. It's not easy for
[1:25:23] me to tell this, but it's the truth.
[1:25:26] That's the way to be truthful. And I
[1:25:28] started to pray again and I seen I
[1:25:31] wasn't fit to put my hands on that
[1:25:34] baby. I said, "Sir, I see that your
[1:25:37] appointment has helped. You just stay
[1:25:39] here." I rushed to the phone and called
[1:25:42] the attorney. I said, "Can I speak to
[1:25:43] you a minute?" He said, "Sure, but the
[1:25:46] other fellas are done gone." I said,
[1:25:48] "Just stay in your office a few
[1:25:49] minutes." I rushed down there and went
[1:25:51] into the room. I said, "Attorney, I want
[1:25:54] to tell you something. when you called a
[1:25:56] while ago. I was
[1:25:58] there. I said, "You you when you called,
[1:26:03] you had me so nervous. I hardly knew
[1:26:06] what I was doing. I was almost beside
[1:26:07] myself." I said, "I had my wife to
[1:26:10] answer like that." But it was a lie. And
[1:26:12] I lied to you and I caused my wife to
[1:26:15] lie. Said, "Well, you wasn't in there
[1:26:18] just then, Billy." She said you wasn't.
[1:26:20] I said I wasn't, but I run out of the
[1:26:21] house and run behind the house to keep
[1:26:23] from being in there. I said, "It's a
[1:26:25] lie." Anyhow,
[1:26:28] I said, "Will you forgive me for it?"
[1:26:31] Walked across the floor, looked me right
[1:26:34] straight in the eye, and I could see in
[1:26:37] his gray eyes little tears begin to
[1:26:40] form. He took me by the hand and hugged
[1:26:43] me. He said, "Brother Brandon, I've had
[1:26:46] great confidence in you, but I got more
[1:26:48] than ever now." Why? when we think on
[1:26:52] our
[1:26:54] ways. I went and prayed for the baby.
[1:26:57] Went back and the next day I went up to
[1:26:59] my cave where I go to pray way away. I
[1:27:02] stayed all day and it's getting long
[1:27:04] about evening time about 3 or 4:00. I
[1:27:07] come out of my cave and stood by the
[1:27:09] side of a big rock hid way back.
[1:27:11] People's tried to find that for about 15
[1:27:13] years. They never find it. I went in the
[1:27:17] winter time. See them hunting for it.
[1:27:18] They get almost to it and see how they
[1:27:19] turn. something mysteriously turns and
[1:27:22] God gave me that cave. That's the place
[1:27:24] I go to pray. And there's the altar and
[1:27:27] everything. I never touched one thing.
[1:27:29] It was just that way when I found it
[1:27:31] long ago. I prayed all day long. And I
[1:27:35] said, "Lord
[1:27:36] God, I did wrong." And I caused my wife
[1:27:40] to do wrong. Don't hold it against you,
[1:27:42] Lord. Please forgive us. I want to stay
[1:27:46] clean before you, Lord. that when I'm
[1:27:48] called to pray for your sick children,
[1:27:50] there will be no condemnation in my
[1:27:52] heart. I want to be right and that
[1:27:55] condemns me. I couldn't pray for that
[1:27:57] little baby. Will you forgive me? I
[1:28:00] prayed and wept in there from about 7:00
[1:28:03] one morning till about 3:00 or 4 that
[1:28:05] afternoon. There's a big rock blaze at
[1:28:07] the mouth of the cave and it faces east
[1:28:10] way back in the jungles and woods. And I
[1:28:14] come out and get on this rock and raise
[1:28:15] up my hands and and just praise the
[1:28:18] Lord. And I was standing there thanking
[1:28:20] all my ways. I thought, Lord, why did I
[1:28:24] ever do such a thing? Why could a man
[1:28:26] get so bothered? But I'm so glad that
[1:28:29] you love
[1:28:31] me, that you let me think of it, that
[1:28:34] you reveal it to me, that you told me I
[1:28:36] was wrong. That means that you want me
[1:28:39] to do right, that you love me. You ought
[1:28:42] to thank God when he condemns you for
[1:28:44] your sins and your things as you're
[1:28:47] thinking on your ways. And as I stood
[1:28:49] there praising him after I had a
[1:28:52] satisfaction that he had forgiven me, I
[1:28:55] had a scripture come to me and I said,
[1:28:57] "Lord, there was one time that you hid
[1:28:59] Moses in the cliff of the rock. And when
[1:29:02] you passed by," he said, "It looked like
[1:29:05] the back of a man." I said, "You've been
[1:29:07] so gracious to me around this place.
[1:29:11] Could it happen once more,
[1:29:13] Lord? Just to let me know that I took my
[1:29:17] gift and started to the altar and I went
[1:29:19] and was reconciled and then come back to
[1:29:22] offer my gift according to your word. If
[1:29:25] you forgive me, pass by me, Lord, and
[1:29:27] let me see you. I don't know how much
[1:29:30] you believe this in the radio land. You
[1:29:31] may call me a fanatic after this. That's
[1:29:34] between you and God.
[1:29:37] When I set that over to my left, a
[1:29:39] little space just about like that little
[1:29:41] pillar of fire you see in the picture. A
[1:29:43] little wind went to whirling in the
[1:29:45] bushes, come right down and rolled right
[1:29:47] up past me like that. Went on down
[1:29:49] through the woods. I raised up my voice.
[1:29:52] I wept and I cried. I hollered to God
[1:29:55] and said, "I love you with all my heart,
[1:29:58] Lord. I'm so glad that you are a prayer
[1:30:01] answering God. and forgive them that
[1:30:04] will turn to you with all their heart
[1:30:06] and
[1:30:07] repent. Call upon the name of the Lord.
[1:30:10] He that will cover his sin shall not
[1:30:12] prosper, but he that confesses his sin
[1:30:15] shall have mercy.
[1:30:18] Oh, while we think on our ways before
[1:30:20] healing service starts tomorrow night,
[1:30:22] let's think on our ways as we pray, as
[1:30:25] we bow our heads.
[1:30:31] quite a few lessons in there, wouldn't
[1:30:34] you say? You know, and it's it's simple
[1:30:38] for us
[1:30:40] uh, you know,
[1:30:43] to forget things and and just let things
[1:30:48] slip by. And I think that's the great
[1:30:52] lesson here. You know, I marvel, you
[1:30:55] know, that, you know, how that brother
[1:30:58] Random says things. You know, he said
[1:31:02] that that thought come upon his heart, I
[1:31:05] think, on my ways.
[1:31:08] Who would have ever known that was when
[1:31:10] he was in his house ringing his hands
[1:31:14] when Saul was after
[1:31:17] him, you know, but you see the setting
[1:31:21] and and so that struck me. I don't know
[1:31:24] about you, but how that he would talk
[1:31:27] about how that one day Jesus came down
[1:31:32] uh to see his friend Lazarus and take
[1:31:36] his friend Lazarus down to go see John
[1:31:39] and so many things that it just seems
[1:31:42] like he's there and and so as as we
[1:31:46] heard the testimony, we know that he
[1:31:48] talked about getting in trouble, but he
[1:31:52] also said You know, it's it's a good
[1:31:54] time to seek God before you get in
[1:31:57] trouble. Well, everything's kind and
[1:32:00] good. And so, let's take the lesson.
[1:32:03] James said, "Don't be a just a hearer of
[1:32:05] the word, but be a doer of the word."
[1:32:08] So, we hear that it's good to seek God
[1:32:11] and seek his face when things are going
[1:32:14] good. But he said man's nature is when
[1:32:18] things are going good to forget about
[1:32:20] God.
[1:32:22] And so we take that to a lesson because
[1:32:25] our our whole our whole desire here is
[1:32:29] we want to change so we can be a part of
[1:32:33] the
[1:32:34] change. And and so we we if we don't
[1:32:37] forget these little
[1:32:39] things and and these little uh like he
[1:32:44] said the little foxes is what spoils the
[1:32:47] vine. and and you get to a place where
[1:32:50] we let so many things uh uh just go by.
[1:32:54] And he said it seems like that's the
[1:32:58] trend of the human being to have to be
[1:33:01] pushed into something, pushed into
[1:33:04] worshiping the
[1:33:07] Lord. I I I want to get past that, you
[1:33:11] know, like I'm all afraid of sin and now
[1:33:13] I'm going to go get my life right and
[1:33:15] then I fail and I go get my life right.
[1:33:18] I I I just want to have a Christianity
[1:33:20] that's day after day after
[1:33:23] day, you know, not up and down and up
[1:33:28] and down and in and out and and so he's
[1:33:33] he's telling us in here that that's what
[1:33:37] keeps us from
[1:33:39] prospering is that in and out life. And
[1:33:42] I'm not talking about worldly
[1:33:45] prosperity. I'm talking about spiritual
[1:33:48] prosperity. Spiritual prosper prosperity
[1:33:52] is when when you know that there's grace
[1:33:56] sufficient to get you out of every
[1:33:59] situation and nothing can pluck you out
[1:34:02] of the palm of his hand and that he'll
[1:34:05] get you through any heartache or any
[1:34:08] trouble that you're in. A and you can
[1:34:11] rest in him. And uh and then in in and
[1:34:17] this is another thing that we heard that
[1:34:20] I don't think we should let it pass
[1:34:23] by.
[1:34:25] Um and and you know he was talking about
[1:34:28] the Philistines. He's talking about that
[1:34:30] he he made this statement. He said,
[1:34:34] "Tell me what kind of price that you
[1:34:37] could put on eternal life. If you were
[1:34:41] lying dying tonight with a hundred
[1:34:44] billion dollars in your pocket, it could
[1:34:47] not touch eternal life. You can't buy
[1:34:50] it. Money is filthy in the sight of God
[1:34:54] if it isn't used to his kingdom or some
[1:34:59] good cause.
[1:35:02] That's a good thing to remember about
[1:35:05] money.
[1:35:06] Money is filthy in the sight of
[1:35:10] God if it's not used for some good
[1:35:15] cause. These are those little things
[1:35:18] that Brother Brandham mentions that
[1:35:21] we've got to think about. We've got to
[1:35:25] think about these things on our way. put
[1:35:28] them in our hearts and meditate on them
[1:35:32] day and night and and and then we we'll
[1:35:35] start to find as James said he says then
[1:35:39] you'll be successful then things will
[1:35:42] work in your life when you do those
[1:35:45] things I I thought that was quite the
[1:35:47] the comment he he said what would you
[1:35:51] give in
[1:35:54] uh you know for eternal life and And uh
[1:35:59] he also made this statement here. It's a
[1:36:01] good to turn to the Lord before these
[1:36:04] troubles strike. And and just just
[1:36:07] walking through just a few things like
[1:36:10] that. He said he remember he talked
[1:36:13] about the
[1:36:14] bum. Where are you going? I don't know.
[1:36:18] Where you been? I don't know. And I
[1:36:20] thought we mentioned that this morning.
[1:36:23] If you don't remember where you've been,
[1:36:25] there's no way to know where you're
[1:36:27] going. And and what do you become? A
[1:36:31] drifter. And and and and then here,
[1:36:34] Brother Rams kind of and he brings it
[1:36:36] right back up. If you don't know where
[1:36:38] you come from, I don't
[1:36:40] know. You got to know where you come
[1:36:42] from. You got to know where you're
[1:36:44] going. If and I just thought it was
[1:36:47] amazing. And then he made this
[1:36:48] statement. He
[1:36:50] said, he
[1:36:53] said, he said, he said, I don't know, no
[1:36:58] ambition. Why the Christian ought to be
[1:37:01] the most ambitious person in the
[1:37:08] world, bringing this glorious gospel of
[1:37:13] eternal life to a dying and perishing
[1:37:16] world. We should be up and at it.
[1:37:22] I I just, you know, that thrills
[1:37:27] me, you know, because we talked this
[1:37:30] morning about misplaced
[1:37:33] uh uh anointing or mis or mis uh place
[1:37:40] supernatural.
[1:37:42] And and it's not for us to get
[1:37:44] spiritually fat. It's that our ambition
[1:37:48] might be to bring what we have to this
[1:37:51] dying world. And if you do that, you'll
[1:37:54] find out how that you'll
[1:37:56] prosper and and just be in in good
[1:38:00] health. And and and so, you know, I I
[1:38:03] just made a a couple little remarks as I
[1:38:07] went down. I'm just sharing with you the
[1:38:10] remarks that that that stood out to me.
[1:38:14] And uh and then as as he talked about
[1:38:18] going down his his road, he
[1:38:22] says he says David was sitting on his
[1:38:25] throne and Nathan the prophet came in
[1:38:28] and revealed the seeker of his heart.
[1:38:30] And David thought on his sinful ways.
[1:38:34] Yet he was a good man being a man after
[1:38:38] God's own heart. But he was living with
[1:38:41] Uriah's right wife and it was wrong. And
[1:38:45] when David, the king of Israel, thought
[1:38:47] on his ways, it drove him to sackcloth
[1:38:51] in prayer because he thought on his
[1:38:54] sinful ways and it drove him to his
[1:38:58] knees. Now, there's a difference in
[1:39:00] admitting you're wrong and that you've
[1:39:03] done something wrong. But he's that's
[1:39:05] not what he's saying. He says it ought
[1:39:08] to drive
[1:39:10] you to your knees. Lord, get this out of
[1:39:13] my life. Make me do better. Help me. You
[1:39:18] know, it ought to drive us to
[1:39:19] repentance.
[1:39:21] It and he's remember he said it's human
[1:39:24] nature to justify
[1:39:29] everything and and we got to be careful
[1:39:31] of that. And then we also got to realize
[1:39:36] how important it is to think on your
[1:39:39] ways. Brother Ram used the word to
[1:39:41] examine ourselves to go back over our
[1:39:44] lives because we're we're wanting to go
[1:39:48] forward. We're wanting to What kind of
[1:39:50] church do we want to be? What kind of
[1:39:52] believer do you want to be? Well, we're
[1:39:55] supposed to be ambassadors, you know.
[1:39:57] We're supposed to be shining our light.
[1:39:59] We're supposed to be testifying. And in
[1:40:02] order to be successful at that, we have
[1:40:05] to come back on our side of it and
[1:40:08] examine our ways. And he talks about
[1:40:12] Jacob, you know, he said David uh
[1:40:16] prayed, Jacob prayed. uh uh there
[1:40:20] there's so many Christian professing
[1:40:22] Christians tonight that only deceiving
[1:40:25] the
[1:40:27] things thing that's
[1:40:30] only deceiving the things that they're
[1:40:34] confessed to
[1:40:35] be death will come creeping around the
[1:40:38] door one of these days and you're going
[1:40:40] to think of your ways then
[1:40:43] so what's he saying he says Christians
[1:40:46] don't
[1:40:47] face their
[1:40:49] ways. We shrug this little thing off. We
[1:40:52] shrug that little thing off. And then he
[1:40:54] goes on to say, "It's the little foxes
[1:40:56] that spoil the vine." So yes,
[1:41:01] 99% of the time we're good, but we can't
[1:41:05] forget to deal with that 1%.
[1:41:09] I I'm trusting you're all 99%.
[1:41:14] You know, I'm a I I think I'm way below
[1:41:17] that, but it makes me feel good to sit
[1:41:20] in the company of the saints and then
[1:41:23] know that you can pray for
[1:41:25] me. But
[1:41:28] no, don't blow it off.
[1:41:32] You're eternally secure in him. Your
[1:41:34] name's written on the Lamb's book of
[1:41:36] life. He's preaching the word of God for
[1:41:40] you to deal with it. Let it drive you to
[1:41:42] the knees. It makes you what you are. It
[1:41:45] gives you the character that you need to
[1:41:49] to to just to to look at yourself,
[1:41:51] examine yourself, and and do better. And
[1:41:55] and that struck me. He talked about
[1:41:57] Moses. He said, "Brothers and
[1:42:00] sisters, it's a it he talked about
[1:42:03] Peter, you know, and he said and then he
[1:42:06] said, "Brothers and sisters, it's about
[1:42:08] croc crowing time for a lot of us."
[1:42:12] that would make us wake up and think on
[1:42:16] our ways, the ways that we are treating
[1:42:21] the Lord
[1:42:22] Jesus. That struck me. I don't think
[1:42:26] that I I'm living that I'm treating
[1:42:29] Jesus
[1:42:32] anyway. You know what I mean? I I don't
[1:42:34] I don't think like that. Oh, I'm
[1:42:36] treating Jesus this way. I think there's
[1:42:39] Jesus.
[1:42:41] He's
[1:42:42] okay. He's up in heaven. He's on his
[1:42:46] throne. And I'm around down here
[1:42:48] running. And the prophet puts it in a
[1:42:51] completely different perspective. He
[1:42:53] says, "We ought to examine the ways
[1:42:54] we're treating him."
[1:42:57] Well, when you ignore him and you don't
[1:43:00] thank him and you don't recognize him
[1:43:04] and you don't give him credit that he's
[1:43:06] a present help in the time of trouble
[1:43:08] and he becomes second shelf. He becomes
[1:43:12] lower tier. He he becomes the the
[1:43:16] doesn't have the preeminence or the
[1:43:18] priority. He moves low on your priority
[1:43:21] list. Then then that's the way you're
[1:43:24] treating him. But we don't look at
[1:43:27] ourselves and ask that question. How am
[1:43:29] I treating Jesus? I thought this was a
[1:43:32] tremendous reminder.
[1:43:36] It may be a simple message. It may not
[1:43:40] be about the seals and about the horse
[1:43:42] riders and and and about predestination
[1:43:45] and about the seed. But these are all
[1:43:48] the fundamental
[1:43:50] foundation principles by which our
[1:43:53] messenger lived by that placed him into
[1:43:56] the place in his life where he could
[1:43:59] have that book revealed through him.
[1:44:05] And that's what he said. I went back and
[1:44:08] I started I Lord I'm rededicating my
[1:44:11] calling. So even those little things
[1:44:16] affected well if it affected him and I
[1:44:20] thought that's all that he's got on his
[1:44:24] list. I mean I
[1:44:28] thought I just didn't want to think
[1:44:30] after that
[1:44:32] point. You know what I mean? But I alls
[1:44:36] I can do is get down and say,
[1:44:38] "Lord, I want to think on my ways, man.
[1:44:42] I want to deal with He says he
[1:44:45] says he says the way that we are
[1:44:48] treating Jesus in this new modern age of
[1:44:53] all
[1:44:54] self-styled and polished re religion.
[1:44:59] It's time to think on our ways and come
[1:45:03] back to the old pathway that Jesus trod
[1:45:10] when he was here on earth. The way of
[1:45:13] sacrifice. Think on our ways. The old
[1:45:18] trodden path that Jesus walked. The way
[1:45:23] of
[1:45:23] sacrifice. Sacrifice is hardly in the
[1:45:27] book. anymore. And you know, he he
[1:45:31] addressed in here uh about what belonged
[1:45:35] to God. And you know, I I I didn't mark
[1:45:39] that to uh uh but he he he goes, you
[1:45:45] know, talking about 30 pieces of silver
[1:45:48] and and
[1:45:50] uh and about people. He says, "There's
[1:45:53] many people listening tonight who
[1:45:56] hasn't who hasn't cheated their neighbor
[1:46:00] just a little bit, done a little crooked
[1:46:02] deal. I pray that if that be the case,
[1:46:06] that you'll hear the tinkling of that
[1:46:09] money till it sends you to your knees
[1:46:12] and repentance." Many of you hold out
[1:46:15] God's part and spend it for things out
[1:46:18] here or whiskey, tobacco, cigarettes,
[1:46:21] gasoline, and ride around
[1:46:25] on he'll find you. You know, I went I
[1:46:29] don't drink whiskey. I don't smoke
[1:46:31] cigarettes. And then he says gasoline to
[1:46:34] ride around on. I think,
[1:46:36] oh, he'll find you where you're living.
[1:46:40] But remember he said you ought to thank
[1:46:42] God that he convict you of your sins.
[1:46:49] And and uh so he says and he says many
[1:46:54] hold out God's part. He says and
[1:46:57] gasoline to ride around on. When it
[1:46:59] belongs in the house of the Lord it's
[1:47:02] your solemn duty to give it. Think on
[1:47:06] your ways. Think about it. 30 pieces of
[1:47:13] silver. And you say, "Brother McCary,
[1:47:15] why are you doing this?" Cuz I don't
[1:47:17] want us to get this message to be where
[1:47:21] when we listen to it, we're not hearing
[1:47:23] all the things that are in
[1:47:26] there. They're They'll impact your life.
[1:47:31] They'll do things for you like you can't
[1:47:33] believe. You can rise up above the enemy
[1:47:36] where he just becomes a big alleyoop to
[1:47:39] you.
[1:47:41] That's a
[1:47:43] bluff. Maybe maybe the alleyoop
[1:47:47] uh maybe many of you don't know what
[1:47:48] that is. And then he just goes down. He
[1:47:52] says and then remember and I want to
[1:47:57] close with this. He says, "I wonder
[1:48:00] tonight in radio land and in this
[1:48:03] visible
[1:48:04] audience if many of you aren't thinking
[1:48:08] on your ways, the things that you have
[1:48:11] done and the things that you've
[1:48:15] left undone.
[1:48:20] It's just as great to leave undone as it
[1:48:25] is to do that something that's wrong.
[1:48:28] For he that knoweth the good do good and
[1:48:32] doesn't do it to
[1:48:34] him, it is
[1:48:37] sins. And
[1:48:40] so and then he makes this statement. I
[1:48:43] know no other cleansing. I know no other
[1:48:46] way. nothing else that I know to do.
[1:48:51] Only confess our sins and be right with
[1:48:55] God. Clean up little bitty things. It's
[1:49:00] the little foxes that spoils the
[1:49:05] grapes and and so and I'm just going to
[1:49:09] say this. I've noticed in the message,
[1:49:13] and I I hate to say this, but I I can't
[1:49:17] be honest with you. I've noticed in the
[1:49:20] message all across the land that there's
[1:49:23] becoming such a trend to take those
[1:49:27] little things that he said and not give
[1:49:30] them any weight anymore.
[1:49:34] the little things about church, the
[1:49:36] little things about how we act, the
[1:49:39] little things about how we dress, all
[1:49:42] those little things. We've got it to be
[1:49:44] such a big picture that we've widened
[1:49:48] the dope gate.
[1:49:50] You know what I mean? And now there's
[1:49:53] almost no requirement.
[1:49:56] And let me tell you the number of people
[1:49:59] that you have coming to church is no
[1:50:03] measure of your spirituality.
[1:50:07] I mean really if you were trying to
[1:50:10] measure the spirituality of the church
[1:50:13] this Wednesday nights and Sunday nights
[1:50:16] really let you know where people are and
[1:50:21] and so it's just kind of a
[1:50:24] reminder to us and how important it is
[1:50:31] to take a look at your
[1:50:34] life not at what you believe. This has
[1:50:38] nothing to do with what you believe. It
[1:50:42] has everything to do with what you're
[1:50:46] doing. Amen.
[1:50:49] Or not doing.
[1:50:53] And I'm afraid there's probably a lot
[1:50:56] more not doing than there is doing. So,
[1:51:00] this isn't about uh trying to ball you
[1:51:03] out or or or I'm talking to myself. It's
[1:51:06] not about trying to find something that
[1:51:09] that you know, this isn't pin the sin on
[1:51:11] the on the
[1:51:13] sinner. You know that that's how a lot
[1:51:16] of we used to be a game called pin the
[1:51:18] tail on the donkey. Remember that one?
[1:51:21] And so this isn't the preacher trying to
[1:51:24] pin a sin on you, but it's it's the
[1:51:27] concept and the
[1:51:29] understanding that this is something
[1:51:31] that the prophet of God taught. It was
[1:51:35] stored up for us, right? And now it's
[1:51:38] coming out of the
[1:51:40] storehouse to remind us of of the things
[1:51:44] that we we we do and and to mind the
[1:51:49] little
[1:51:50] things and and and that's the important
[1:51:53] thing. And like I said, I've I noticed
[1:51:56] in my own life, particularly in my life
[1:51:59] and in the generally as a whole, how all
[1:52:03] those little things that we used to
[1:52:05] stand on that were so important to us in
[1:52:08] the beginning have just they just start
[1:52:12] to slip. And we know the statement. It
[1:52:16] says, "How did we know how the sheep got
[1:52:18] out, but how did the
[1:52:21] goats get in?" So, I I I I I just hope
[1:52:25] it's an encouragement to you. And and
[1:52:28] you don't need to do these things for my
[1:52:31] sake, but I want you to see that this is
[1:52:34] what your messenger taught. And that
[1:52:36] ought to be enough. And and if you're
[1:52:39] faithful in little, he'll make you
[1:52:41] faithful in much. and and we don't
[1:52:45] realize and when I read this and brother
[1:52:48] Bram just told that one little thing but
[1:52:51] it had such an
[1:52:53] effect on what he was called to
[1:52:57] do and others he couldn't with that one
[1:53:01] little thing which to me I wouldn't have
[1:53:05] thought a thing about
[1:53:08] it wouldn't even entered my mind but he
[1:53:11] was so dedicated
[1:53:13] that he went to pray for that baby and
[1:53:16] the effect of that little thing was
[1:53:20] keeping him from
[1:53:23] performing. And I thought, Lord, I
[1:53:25] wonder how many people I've prayed
[1:53:28] for that because my conscience wasn't
[1:53:32] right or I had let things undone that it
[1:53:36] wasn't
[1:53:38] successful or how much influence have I
[1:53:42] failed to have because I didn't have the
[1:53:45] little
[1:53:46] things that are right. And so,
[1:53:51] uh, I'm just talking to you tonight and,
[1:53:54] you know, many of you say, "Pastor, I
[1:53:58] just think my myself is a brother who's
[1:54:01] in the same battle that you're in." So,
[1:54:04] let's take heed of that, right? Let's
[1:54:07] consider these things. Let's be mindful
[1:54:10] of these things. And I think uh, it'll
[1:54:13] make us better Christians. And then I
[1:54:16] think if we get the little things right,
[1:54:20] I think we'll have a greater effect on
[1:54:24] the world around us. And that's really
[1:54:27] where we want to see the power of God
[1:54:30] displayed. We want to see the power of
[1:54:33] God displayed for those who have never
[1:54:36] tasted
[1:54:38] it. That's our objective. Not just for
[1:54:42] us to keep getting fat. Anyway, um, so I
[1:54:46] I think you know that quote this morning
[1:54:49] was from Convinced and Concerned. I
[1:54:52] think it's 5 uh 21 1959 if you'd like to
[1:54:58] go back and listen to that message. So,
[1:55:00] so God bless you tonight. Let's stand
[1:55:03] together and and uh we'll we'll be
[1:55:07] dismissed. the musicians can come and
[1:55:10] and uh uh
[1:55:14] uh don't don't you think it's good to be
[1:55:17] able to
[1:55:20] uh sit back and ask the Lord to search
[1:55:25] you? I know that every now and then I
[1:55:28] think I'll do that and I'll sit down and
[1:55:31] then I'll get to thinking I don't really
[1:55:33] think I want him to search me.
[1:55:39] you know, because I don't want to
[1:55:41] change. I don't want to be different.
[1:55:44] You know, I kind of like the way things
[1:55:46] are
[1:55:47] going, but he's calling to our hearts.
[1:55:51] Search out. Start searching and watch
[1:55:54] what God will do for you. Let's bow our
[1:55:57] heads. Amen. Maybe you could, if you
[1:56:01] choose to, and you want to lift your
[1:56:04] hand and say, 'Lord,
[1:56:06] I I want to have you search my heart. I
[1:56:10] want you to look on the little things
[1:56:14] and the things that I'm being undone,
[1:56:18] Father. I want to really think about how
[1:56:21] that I'm treating
[1:56:22] you, Lord. And I know that the way I
[1:56:26] treat my brother and my sister, father,
[1:56:29] reflects on how that I'm treating you,
[1:56:32] Lord. I want to become more conscious of
[1:56:34] my actions and the words that come out
[1:56:38] of my mouth and and what's important to
[1:56:42] me and my
[1:56:45] priorities, Father. There's many things
[1:56:47] I can't do that I can't do without you,
[1:56:51] Father. But this is something that I can
[1:56:54] do. I can think on my
[1:56:59] ways and I
[1:57:01] can use the
[1:57:03] filter of your word as our messenger
[1:57:06] preached in thinking men's filter. I can
[1:57:10] use the filter of your word to filter my
[1:57:13] life
[1:57:14] through. And Lord, I know beyond a
[1:57:17] shadow of a
[1:57:18] doubt if we would start doing
[1:57:21] it, things would
[1:57:25] change, Lord. And I know we've got a lot
[1:57:28] of new believers, many new members of
[1:57:32] the church. Father, Sunday mornings, we
[1:57:37] have people show from all walks of life.
[1:57:43] And father, I ask that your word would
[1:57:45] reach out and
[1:57:47] touch so each one would become
[1:57:51] mindful of the respect that we need for
[1:57:54] you and for one
[1:57:57] another. that we wouldn't leave any
[1:58:00] behind,
[1:58:04] Father. That each of us, one by
[1:58:08] one, individually in our
[1:58:11] heart, would work out our own salvation
[1:58:15] with fear and
[1:58:17] trembling. We'd be mindful.
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:25] James spoke after he
[1:58:27] said talking about being
[1:58:31] a a diligent hearer and doer of the word
[1:58:35] of
[1:58:36] God. He said, "No
[1:58:39] man serves God without bridling his
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:44] tongue." Lord, there's so much that we
[1:58:48] could improve on.
[1:58:50] And I've lifted my hand to you, Lord,
[1:58:52] and just ask me to help one little fox
[1:58:56] at a time, Lord. One
[1:58:59] little thing at a time, Father. And just
[1:59:03] try to improve my whole Christian life.
[1:59:07] I ask that you would get that grace and
[1:59:09] that mercy to each one here that they'll
[1:59:12] understand that that the importance of
[1:59:15] what we heard tonight and the reality of
[1:59:19] it. We ask that you would bless it to us
[1:59:22] in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen.
[1:59:26] Let's sing this little song in our heart
[1:59:29] just for a moment as we read these
[1:59:32] things. Search me Lord. I believe it's
[1:59:34] called Amen.
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:46] Search
[1:59:47] me, oh
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:52] God, and
[1:59:54] know my
[1:59:56] heart today.
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:06] Oh
[2:00:10] savior know my
[2:00:14] thoughts I pray.

[2:00:27] be some
[2:00:29] wicked
[2:00:31] way in
[2:00:35] [Music]
[2:00:41] me of
[2:00:43] every
[2:00:45] sin and
[2:00:48] Set
[2:00:50] me
[2:00:53] [Music]
[2:01:03] free
[2:01:05] for
[2:01:07] me from sin. Yes, Lord.
[2:01:15] Will
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:21] I make me
[2:01:25] pure
[2:01:28] within? Oh yes.
[2:01:33] Fill
[2:01:34] me with
[2:01:39] fire where
[2:01:41] once I
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:50] burn
[2:01:52] my
[2:01:56] desire to
[2:01:59] make me
[2:02:02] [Music]
[2:02:04] Yes. Our father
[2:02:06] tonight, Lord, this is our prayer that
[2:02:09] you search us. Father, we want to thank
[2:02:13] you for the wonderful singing that we've
[2:02:17] heard today. And Father, as our guests
[2:02:21] travel back to France and Italy, Father,
[2:02:25] we ask that you keep them safe.
[2:02:28] Father, that they would remember their
[2:02:31] brothers and sisters here in Dallas Fort
[2:02:34] Worth and we'll keep
[2:02:36] them in our hearts, Lord. And we'll
[2:02:41] trust that we'll be able to meet again,
[2:02:43] if not in this
[2:02:44] life, in the life after, Father. Father,
[2:02:50] bless our body of
[2:02:53] believers, Father, and grant to us a
[2:02:56] more dedicated, more
[2:02:59] spiritual
[2:03:01] life
[2:03:03] of listening to the
[2:03:06] instructions and reading our Bibles and
[2:03:10] praying and sacrifice. Father, we want
[2:03:14] to be the kind of Christians that you
[2:03:16] want us to be. Father, let us hold to
[2:03:20] that oldtime religion. We ask that you
[2:03:23] would grant it for us. In Jesus precious
[2:03:26] and wonderful name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:03:31] We'd like you to keep Matthew in prayer.
[2:03:33] He's traveling back. He was in uh
[2:03:37] uh uh uh Connecticut, I believe,
[2:03:41] preaching this weekend, and he just got
[2:03:44] done preaching camp. And then he's on
[2:03:46] his way to preach in uh
[2:03:50] um Arizona out there for the people out
[2:03:54] there. So keep him in prayer and he
[2:03:57] tries to represent the gospel and and uh
[2:04:01] I I'm not I don't think I can go that
[2:04:04] strong of a schedule, but he's young and
[2:04:07] strong and loves the Lord. So may he
[2:04:10] feel your prayers and and uh keep us in
[2:04:14] mind as we're preparing for some
[2:04:17] services in July and some other things
[2:04:20] that might be coming up. So Lord Richley
[2:04:22] bless you. Go in peace and and let's
[2:04:26] just sing that song. I love God is good.
[2:04:28] Is God
[2:04:30] good all the time? Ain't he good?
[2:04:33] Present help in the time of trouble.
[2:04:36] Amen. Amen.
[2:04:39] [Music]

[2:04:44] walking through the
[2:04:47] valley and
[2:04:49] shadows all
[2:04:53] around. Do not
[2:04:56] fear. He will guide you.
[2:05:00] He will keep you still
[2:05:04] inside cuz he
[2:05:07] promised to never
[2:05:12] leave
[2:05:13] you and his word is true. God is
[2:05:19] good all the time.
[2:05:23] He was a song of praise in this part of
[2:05:28] life. God is
[2:05:31] good all the
[2:05:33] time. Oh, through the
[2:05:37] darkness. His light will shine. God is
[2:05:43] good. God is
[2:05:46] good all the time.
[2:05:49] Oh, we
[2:05:51] worship so
[2:05:54] unworthy. Fill for
[2:05:59] us. Thank you, Lord. Fill us
[2:06:03] with his holy spirit.
[2:06:07] Now we can
