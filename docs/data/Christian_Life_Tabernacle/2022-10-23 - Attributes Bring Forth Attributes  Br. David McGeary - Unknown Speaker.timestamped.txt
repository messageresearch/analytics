[27:37] but that that that offers good and no
[27:40] latecomers
[27:42] you know you guys keep track if they
[27:45] aren't here and you see them at Brahms
[27:50] right amen let's just go into the word
[27:52] uh tonight and uh
[27:56] I'd like just to uh
[27:59] title this and talk on this this evening
[28:02] attributes manufacturing attributes or
[28:07] attributes
[28:08] manifesting attributes attributes
[28:12] manifesting attributes and for our first
[28:15] scripture I'd like to turn to
[28:18] uh
[28:20] uh John uh three the uh John uh the
[28:25] third chapter of John and the 16th verse
[28:29] of the third chapter of John and
[28:34] we'll read uh
[28:36] 14 15 and 16 together
[28:39] emphasizing the 16th verse
[28:43] they say that the John 3 16 is the most
[28:46] quoted and well-known verse in the Bible
[28:51] you look around the world and it
[28:55] certainly doesn't appear that way does
[28:56] it
[28:57] but uh it's such a great scripture it
[29:01] says as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[29:05] the wilderness even so unless the son of
[29:08] man be lifted up and we know the story
[29:11] that the children of Israel were sick
[29:13] and ill and Moses bit that brass Serpent
[29:16] and lifted it up and they that looked
[29:18] upon it were well
[29:20] that whosoever believeth in him should
[29:23] not perish but have eternal life for God
[29:27] so loved the world
[29:29] that he gave his only begotten son that
[29:33] whosoever believeth in him should not
[29:36] perish but have everlasting life for God
[29:40] sent not his son into the world to
[29:43] condemn the world but that the world
[29:46] through him might be saved amen and amen
[29:51] we could go into great depth taking
[29:54] those scriptures apart but we'll let's
[29:58] just pray and then we'll be seated our
[30:00] heavenly father bless your word to us in
[30:03] Jesus precious name we pray amen God
[30:06] bless you may be seated and then let's
[30:09] turn over to
[30:11] uh
[30:13] uh this uh seventh chapter of the Book
[30:18] of Matthew
[30:20] and
[30:21] um
[30:22] again uh talking about attributes
[30:26] manifesting attributes and let's just
[30:30] start with Matthew 7 and 7.
[30:37] and he says
[30:40] ask and it shall be given you
[30:44] seek and you shall find knock and it
[30:49] shall be opened unto you for everyone
[30:52] that asketh receiveth and he that
[30:56] seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh
[30:59] it shall be opened
[31:02] or what man is there of you
[31:05] whom if his son asks
[31:10] bread
[31:12] will he give him a stone
[31:15] or if he asked a fish will give him a
[31:20] serpent
[31:21] if he then being evil
[31:24] know how to give good gifts unto your
[31:27] children how much more shall your father
[31:31] which is in heaven
[31:33] give good things to them that ask him
[31:38] therefore all things whatsoever ye would
[31:41] that men should do to you do ye even sow
[31:46] to them for this is the law and the
[31:51] prophets
[31:52] I hope that you can see that theme kind
[31:56] of the attributes Manny uh manifesting
[32:00] attributes how you want people to do to
[32:03] you do to them
[32:06] amen it says entering in at the Straight
[32:09] Gate for white is the gate and Broad is
[32:13] the way that leadeth to destruction and
[32:17] many there be which go
[32:19] in there at because straight is the gate
[32:23] and narrowest away which leadeth unto
[32:27] life and few there be that find it
[32:32] beware of false prophets which come to
[32:36] you in sheep's clothing but inwardly
[32:39] they are ravenous wolves
[32:42] ye shall know them by their fruits
[32:48] do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs
[32:52] of thistles
[32:54] even so every good tree beareth
[32:59] fourth for every good tree bringeth
[33:03] forth good fruit
[33:05] but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
[33:09] fruit
[33:10] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[33:14] fruit
[33:15] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[33:18] good fruit
[33:20] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[33:25] fruit is hewed down and cast in the the
[33:29] fire
[33:31] the fire whosoever
[33:34] for whether for by their fruits ye shall
[33:39] know them
[33:41] amen we just ask the Lord to bless the
[33:45] reading of his word and as we just talk
[33:49] about this just for a few minutes
[33:51] because we have a little project ahead
[33:55] of us that we've got to get right into
[33:57] right
[33:59] ice cream
[34:05] that's uh that's the agenda tonight so
[34:09] uh uh you know uh we're gonna get right
[34:13] into it if you might if you could go
[34:15] back to the message that we're reading
[34:18] out of
[34:19] just uh this morning and go uh to
[34:24] paragraph 240 and and the 243 and I I
[34:30] would like to uh
[34:32] uh read that
[34:34] um and then we're going to read a few
[34:36] scriptures out of the book of Galatians
[34:39] and and not be long and and so
[34:44] we talked about
[34:46] this morning we understand that the seed
[34:48] of God is placed within us
[34:53] and it was placed there before the
[34:55] foundation of the world
[34:57] and that seed that God
[35:00] put in there was what that we were
[35:04] really
[35:05] to be
[35:07] but because we've came into the world
[35:09] the way that we came into the world that
[35:12] we inherited
[35:14] another nature and we're born with that
[35:18] nature and we know that that nature is a
[35:22] carnal nature and because of that nature
[35:26] we were subject to that nature and the
[35:30] things of that nature act and so uh that
[35:35] was what we were and then we realized
[35:37] that God had another nature for us in
[35:43] his mind
[35:44] and that nature was contained within
[35:49] that seed
[35:50] and and we know that every tree bringeth
[35:54] forth and every seed bringeth forth of
[35:57] its kind so if it wasn't planted in
[36:01] there from the beginning there's no way
[36:05] that it can produce any other thing than
[36:08] what God intended it to do and so we
[36:13] know that we are his workmanship in
[36:16] Christ Jesus
[36:17] foreordained unto good works that we
[36:20] should walk in them so there's an
[36:23] allotment to us in apportion to us and
[36:27] that's what that we're seeking we're
[36:29] seeking what is that
[36:32] uh position and what is uh the role that
[36:37] I play and these next uh this next few
[36:41] paragraphs kind of
[36:44] um
[36:45] it puts on puts it into words in a way
[36:49] that gives beautifully put and so if we
[36:54] start with the uh
[36:57] uh the story the stories about the the
[37:01] little uh
[37:04] uh Eagle that we find in the chicken
[37:07] yard and we're real familiar with that
[37:10] story how that that that a little Eagle
[37:14] got taken from its nest and found itself
[37:18] growing up in the chicken yard and
[37:22] acting like the chicken
[37:24] but because the mother Eagle knew that
[37:28] she had a a baby she knew that she had
[37:33] an eagle somewhere that she went looking
[37:37] for it and so he placed that in the type
[37:40] that God knew he had Sons and Daughters
[37:43] he knew that he had planted that seed
[37:46] somewhere now we uh we know that he knew
[37:51] where he planted that seed because he
[37:53] was the one that planted it but then
[37:56] because he had that seed he went
[37:58] searching for that seed at to bring that
[38:02] seed to life and the only thing that
[38:05] could mix with the seed that he planted
[38:08] in you was the pure word of God because
[38:12] that that's what it is even though your
[38:15] mind
[38:16] we'll we'll take in all kinds of things
[38:20] and you're intellect we'll take in all
[38:23] kinds of things because that's what
[38:25] happened to Eve that was the Gateway uh
[38:28] to the decision that she made now Adam
[38:31] could have never made that decision that
[38:34] Eve made
[38:36] so we understand that God took that part
[38:39] out of Adam
[38:40] and we we went through that this morning
[38:42] and allowed that part to fall
[38:46] that he could manifest his attributes
[38:50] he could manifest the things that he was
[38:54] his attributes so that seed was never
[38:57] lost
[39:00] because it was recorded
[39:03] in the Lamb's Book of Life and nothing
[39:07] could take it off
[39:08] because so the and in doing that then he
[39:13] became Justified
[39:15] in letting you come into this condition
[39:18] because you were already
[39:21] secure in him in other words he was
[39:25] going to get you to where that you
[39:28] needed to be one way or the other
[39:31] now and we certainly don't want to kick
[39:35] our foot against the prick you know he
[39:37] finally looked at Paul he said Paul it's
[39:39] hard to fight against me
[39:43] you know it's hard for you to do what
[39:46] you're doing because this is not what I
[39:49] called you for now figure the shock
[39:53] to Paul
[39:55] right that that piece of a Pharisee
[39:59] above Pharisees he's a a scribe of
[40:02] scribes he's he's well versed he he
[40:07] tutored under gamalia he's zealous
[40:11] consumed with Zeal he's going out to put
[40:15] all these Heretics in prison and
[40:21] all of a sudden he gets
[40:23] knocked off a horse and he says Paul
[40:26] I've called you to preach the gospel to
[40:28] the Gentiles
[40:31] now when I grew up we called that a 360.
[40:37] yeah it's really 180 but we never called
[40:39] it 180 we weren't good at math all the
[40:42] kids said I I ran around with they all
[40:45] were dropouts anyway so Bree would say
[40:48] man he hung a 360. and there's that
[40:51] means he's going the opposite direction
[40:53] he just totally opposite of what that he
[40:56] was thinking to begin with
[41:00] and all of a sudden Paul's sitting there
[41:03] he had this one great big agenda but God
[41:07] had another plan for him and he tells
[41:10] him Paul it's hard to fight
[41:13] against the plan that I have
[41:19] it it it it don't work so he's going to
[41:22] do whatever that he
[41:27] God has to do
[41:29] he will do
[41:31] to bring you to what he predestinated
[41:35] you to be
[41:37] and so we talked about this that how
[41:40] that he allowed us to fall so he could
[41:43] manifest his attributes
[41:46] and therefore we understand that
[41:48] attributes
[41:51] manifest attributes
[41:55] his attributes towards us
[41:59] is going to bring forth
[42:03] attributes
[42:04] so let's just read this for here
[42:08] he says
[42:10] and so he talked about that eagle and
[42:13] and
[42:15] he says and this is what she said and
[42:18] this is paragraph 237 she said Son you
[42:22] don't belong in that group anyhow you
[42:25] belong to me your mind
[42:30] now can you just see the Lord saying
[42:32] that to you you don't belong in that
[42:35] condition you don't belong in that group
[42:37] you don't belong in that place you're
[42:40] mine
[42:41] why why how can he say that because you
[42:45] were his in the beginning you were with
[42:48] him in the beginning
[42:50] he says you're mine he said Mama that
[42:53] sounds real good how am I going to get
[42:56] out
[42:58] said
[43:00] just make a jump
[43:03] I'll catch you
[43:05] that's all you have
[43:08] tuned
[43:09] just make that jump and I'll catch you
[43:12] the anointed word of God being
[43:15] Vindicated before any man that's born to
[43:20] be a son of God
[43:21] with the predestinated germ
[43:26] in germ into him for this hour he'll see
[43:31] God's message as sure as there's a God
[43:35] in heaven
[43:36] Martin Luther sought for his Wesley saw
[43:40] it for his the Pentecostal saw it for
[43:43] his now what about you
[43:46] could they went in the denomination
[43:49] here is the word
[43:51] uh condemning it telling you what you
[43:57] have today
[43:59] and just exactly Malachi 4 and all those
[44:03] other promises for this hour what do you
[44:07] see
[44:07] what are you looking at amen here we are
[44:11] the real genuine Eagle hears my sheep
[44:17] know my voice The Stranger they'll not
[44:20] follow
[44:22] why
[44:26] that's a that's a thing why
[44:30] why are you placed into the conflict
[44:33] with the religious world they're all
[44:36] claiming Christ and you claim the Lord
[44:38] and you love the Lord and they all look
[44:41] at you like you're a cult
[44:45] and you say no if anything were as far
[44:48] as away from a cult as you can possibly
[44:51] be we've had a true vision of God's word
[44:54] we're really worshiping for what that he
[44:57] is
[44:59] with an understanding of his attributes
[45:01] the uh an understanding of what that he
[45:04] did a real true understanding of what a
[45:08] Kinsmen Redeemer meant they never could
[45:11] understand the Kinsmen Redeemer until
[45:14] the opening of the seals
[45:17] they couldn't understand the Journey of
[45:20] the church
[45:21] they couldn't understand the four horse
[45:24] riders that came up against the church
[45:26] and the four riders that went out and
[45:29] the four beasts that went out and fought
[45:31] against those horse riders
[45:34] they're oblivious to that
[45:37] they don't see it
[45:39] therefore because they can never enter
[45:41] into the freedom that we have as
[45:44] Christians
[45:47] they still struggle and carry the book
[45:51] that we talked about closing this
[45:54] morning They Carried that book forever
[45:57] looking to the time that they come into
[46:00] judgment
[46:01] hoping that their good works
[46:04] out do their bad works
[46:07] and that they will be judged to be saved
[46:12] but the bride she doesn't enter into
[46:15] judgment
[46:18] she's judged already
[46:21] she's already proved that she's an Eagle
[46:24] and not a chicken because she saw the
[46:28] heard the voice
[46:31] and that's what identified her
[46:34] that's the identification
[46:39] that the germ seed
[46:42] that God put in you from the beginning
[46:44] is to hear the voice
[46:49] not a second-hand voice
[46:52] not a second-hand Revelation not the
[46:55] voice explained
[46:58] not me telling you like I'm doing now
[47:01] and reading it to you and putting there
[47:04] so you can read it at least I'm giving
[47:07] you the uh
[47:10] place to go hear it for yourself
[47:16] because we have that ability
[47:18] but yet these quotes are the word
[47:22] expressed
[47:24] so if you read them and hear them you
[47:27] blessed is he that heareth the words in
[47:29] this book and and that you can read the
[47:32] words of this book and God can speak to
[47:35] you through Revelation so I'm not just
[47:37] talking about audibly hearing
[47:41] right anybody can hear
[47:44] hearing doesn't mean here it means he
[47:47] that understandeth these things
[47:51] so when you see it here and you read it
[47:54] and you understand it this is the way
[47:57] that that the proof of that that that
[48:01] seeds in you
[48:06] it's the only identification it's got
[48:09] my sheep
[48:11] know my voice
[48:13] my sheep know my word my sheep hear my
[48:17] voice that in other words they
[48:19] understand what I'm saying
[48:22] isn't that beautiful
[48:24] there's something inside of you that if
[48:28] you hear the message or the hour you
[48:30] read the message or the hour someone
[48:33] shares with you something there's just
[48:35] something in your heart that plays like
[48:38] a melody
[48:39] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful
[48:45] it
[48:46] he says why
[48:49] it was put in there
[48:51] by predestination
[48:54] you were foreordained to a son of God
[48:58] you were in God before the foundation of
[49:03] the world
[49:05] your only manifested in this day for his
[49:10] honor and Glory
[49:12] how can you do it without honoring his
[49:17] word
[49:18] and stand with every word of God
[49:22] yes sir which you are a part of that
[49:28] word by predestination
[49:33] oh not by anything we did but not by
[49:36] will not by might but by my spirit saith
[49:39] the Lord
[49:40] because look
[49:42] the God is the word you believe it
[49:47] amen well then he always was the word in
[49:52] the beginning was the word and if the
[49:55] Word was God
[49:57] then you were in God the word in
[50:02] the word the part that you're to play
[50:08] was in God before the foundation of the
[50:12] world
[50:12] he seen you he knew you he predestinated
[50:19] you to it
[50:22] what did he predestinate you to he
[50:26] predestinated you to the role that
[50:30] you're to play
[50:31] now therefore we're talking about
[50:34] attributes
[50:36] manifesting attributes
[50:39] all this the prophet of God said that
[50:43] you are the attributes of God
[50:48] that's what you are you're the
[50:50] attributes of God you're part of the
[50:53] word of God and you have a part to play
[50:57] now that's the journey that quickly
[51:01] pointed out this morning was that that
[51:05] maturity
[51:08] that each of us wants to grow into is
[51:11] that maturity of being that part of
[51:15] God's word that he wants me to be
[51:18] and not comparing myself to anybody else
[51:22] that's a real freedom
[51:26] of that the Liberty that we have in
[51:29] Christ Jesus is that we don't have to
[51:31] measure up to anything but the
[51:34] Revelation that's in our heart
[51:38] oh my if I had to measure up to anything
[51:41] other than his Mercy I'd be in trouble
[51:46] wouldn't you
[51:50] like going down the manufacturing line
[51:52] and they call out the the bad product
[51:56] and the wrinkled product and the stuff
[51:59] like that well I'd never make it to the
[52:02] end of the line
[52:05] Here Comes this whole wrinkled up bin up
[52:08] old thing down the line and every time
[52:10] they're going to throw it off the belt
[52:11] Mercy
[52:13] Grace
[52:15] why why you let this thing go through
[52:17] it's predestinated
[52:21] to make the end of the journey
[52:24] oh that makes me feel good
[52:26] I don't put a shout in your heart
[52:30] he predestinated to you I tell you
[52:34] just as the eagle recognized that voice
[52:38] so does a real borned again Christian
[52:44] recognizing the voice of God speaking
[52:49] through the word
[52:51] when they see it anointed and Vindicated
[52:58] why
[53:00] how can we take
[53:02] this out of our existence
[53:05] this word it's it's it's a complete
[53:09] thing from beginning and end he's Alpha
[53:13] and Omega he's the bikini in the end he
[53:17] started it he finishes it
[53:21] he that starts the work will stay with
[53:23] it and complete it till the end that's
[53:27] the promise that we have nothing
[53:29] complexes out of the palm of his hand
[53:31] that's a promise we have so the work
[53:34] that he's doing that work is already set
[53:41] it's eternally set
[53:44] he's Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[53:47] the end the first and the last the work
[53:50] of God is already set the plan of God is
[53:53] already set the method of God is already
[53:56] set man cannot fool with it
[54:01] that's what he said you can't fool with
[54:03] nature
[54:06] says every town man does it if it
[54:09] corrupts everything
[54:11] you can't fool with the plan of God
[54:15] it's sad
[54:17] so so what's going on
[54:21] your is pride
[54:24] he's pulling you up close to you
[54:27] and Whispering Whispering the love
[54:29] secrets in his ear he's sharing with you
[54:33] his plan
[54:35] he's sharing with you where you were in
[54:37] the beginning
[54:39] just like he did job where were you when
[54:42] I set the start
[54:44] where were you when I did this where
[54:47] were you which of you counseled me
[54:49] and how to do what I'm doing
[54:54] in an old job finally gets so inspired
[54:57] he says though the skin worms eat my
[54:59] flesh yet will I see God why he knew
[55:03] where he come from he knew he was he a
[55:05] part of
[55:06] he was playing out the role
[55:11] how many people do you think Through the
[55:13] Ages has taken comfort in job
[55:16] huh
[55:19] many people
[55:22] the prophet of God said
[55:24] just like the sun rises in the sunset we
[55:27] go through seasons
[55:29] sometimes you're on the Mountaintop
[55:31] sometimes you're in the valley sometimes
[55:33] he uses the expression when it rains it
[55:37] pours you know can you go through those
[55:40] times but no matter how many cyclists
[55:43] you go through there he's always there
[55:47] he's not going to lose
[55:50] all that the father hath given me will
[55:53] come he came for his own my sheep hear
[55:57] my voice and another they will not
[56:00] follow
[56:01] what is he doing in this age he's chosen
[56:05] you this last elect lady
[56:08] the 11th Hour worker
[56:13] to show you
[56:16] and to open up to you it revealed to you
[56:21] what that he had in his mind from the
[56:26] beginning
[56:29] he's sharing it with you
[56:32] and and so if we if we can just read a
[56:37] little bit more you were predestinated
[56:39] to it just like the eagle
[56:41] here's the voice and when you see an
[56:44] anointed and Vindicated look
[56:47] he he looked up there
[56:50] he didn't see this old hand clucking
[56:53] around here
[56:55] join us and go over here
[56:58] and go this and go to this and that
[57:03] he saw a being like he wanted to be
[57:13] oh don't you like that
[57:16] Sailing In The Air
[57:18] screaming Free up in the Heights above
[57:23] all the vultures and the things of the
[57:25] earth Hallelujah he wanted to be that
[57:29] because it was in him to be that
[57:36] well what's he telling us
[57:39] he the first fruit
[57:42] has been waved over us
[57:45] the eagle scream
[57:47] of the The Book of Revelations that the
[57:51] eagle beast in this age going out
[57:54] screaming what's he doing he's flying
[57:57] over the seed
[57:59] he's flying over us
[58:01] speaking the words that's music to our
[58:04] ears calling out to our hearts and
[58:06] whether we're doing we're seeing
[58:08] something that we want to be
[58:14] is that not true
[58:18] I mean
[58:20] I think I won't go there
[58:23] no don't what wasn't good
[58:27] you know I
[58:30] I'm trying to just not worry about the
[58:33] negative right just stay with what God's
[58:36] saying
[58:37] and a man that's born of God a Son of
[58:40] God has to have the nature of God
[58:46] he has to be like God
[58:51] he honors God he is a part of the word
[58:56] of God and in this last day of this
[59:01] bride taking form just exactly the same
[59:06] power that he was
[59:08] in at the beginning has come up through
[59:12] these organizations and so forth and
[59:16] come out for the bride he can't be
[59:20] nothing else but that
[59:24] so what what are we seeing
[59:29] we're seeing the attributes of God
[59:34] manifested
[59:35] we're seeing the mercy of God
[59:38] the love of God
[59:40] the the the
[59:42] healing uh
[59:45] power of God for Vindication many people
[59:49] were healed in the day
[59:52] many people were healed that sat there
[59:55] and screamed crucify him
[1:00:01] you'll think oh no someone just talked
[1:00:03] him out of it
[1:00:05] that's one thing about the elect you
[1:00:08] can't talk them out of it
[1:00:09] you just can't talk him out of it
[1:00:14] because you'll doubt yourself before
[1:00:16] you'll doubt the word
[1:00:19] the words everything to you as life to
[1:00:22] you it's life it's abundance to you
[1:00:25] so we see that this great plan of God
[1:00:29] was God's attributes
[1:00:32] in the beginning being manifested the
[1:00:36] whole world the whole creation the first
[1:00:40] Bible that he wrote and put in the stars
[1:00:44] and put in nature and had the rivers and
[1:00:46] everything that he had it was all the
[1:00:49] manifested glory of God laying out and
[1:00:53] expressing himself
[1:00:56] but he just didn't want to express
[1:00:58] himself to himself
[1:01:01] he wanted to share this expression
[1:01:07] so he had a what
[1:01:10] a son
[1:01:13] Adam was the son
[1:01:16] of God
[1:01:20] all these attributes that he had
[1:01:25] he took those attributes
[1:01:27] and he put him in a son
[1:01:31] because he wanted to share him
[1:01:35] you're not the
[1:01:37] the children of Cain
[1:01:41] you're the children of Adam
[1:01:44] how do you know you're the children of
[1:01:46] Adam because the first Adam was a living
[1:01:48] soul but the second Adam
[1:01:51] was a quickening spirit
[1:01:54] he came in quickened in you the life
[1:01:58] that was in you oh I mean you understand
[1:02:01] you didn't come to this in your head
[1:02:07] there had to be something in you beside
[1:02:10] your head to grasp this message for what
[1:02:14] it really is because it don't make any
[1:02:17] sense to the carnal mind
[1:02:20] it's enmity to the carnal mind it's
[1:02:23] foolishness to the carnal mind
[1:02:27] even the church world
[1:02:29] the Greater Grace they're great systems
[1:02:32] their great beautiful speakings of the
[1:02:34] scripture when you come down and say
[1:02:36] Malachi 4 5 was fulfilled in a hillbilly
[1:02:40] from Kentucky
[1:02:43] give me a break
[1:02:46] how could you believe such a thing
[1:02:49] because I'm not using my head
[1:02:55] something inside him he rose up
[1:02:59] something I didn't even know was in
[1:03:01] there
[1:03:02] something came to life
[1:03:05] oh you say I got it from my parents
[1:03:08] that's what I love about this message
[1:03:11] it won't let you stay on your parents
[1:03:15] religion
[1:03:18] it will bring it to you personally he
[1:03:22] wants you to know you didn't get this
[1:03:24] from your daddy you didn't get this from
[1:03:26] your mommy you got this from me
[1:03:31] I loved you so much I let you come
[1:03:34] through believing parents I let you've
[1:03:36] been born into it but it doesn't matter
[1:03:38] the bond child is no good air is great
[1:03:41] is no different than the bond child
[1:03:43] under tutors but when you become heir to
[1:03:47] it you become arable
[1:03:53] he's not withholding anything from you
[1:03:56] you're the only withholding that's being
[1:03:59] done is on your side
[1:04:03] you know
[1:04:04] you got this worthy thing
[1:04:07] going on
[1:04:09] you'll never be worthy your
[1:04:12] righteousness is as filthy rags it's a
[1:04:15] gift of God lest any man should boast
[1:04:21] freely given
[1:04:23] freely give
[1:04:27] so we we see that the Beautiful
[1:04:31] part of it here it can't be nothing else
[1:04:33] but that so we find out that this that
[1:04:38] this
[1:04:39] these attributes of God was manifested
[1:04:44] showing that he loved
[1:04:49] he wanted to share
[1:04:51] he was a Shepherd a Good Shepherd you
[1:04:55] say well
[1:04:56] I'm living in this terrible world and I
[1:04:58] get sick
[1:05:00] he said by my stripes you are healed
[1:05:07] he made a provision
[1:05:11] for everything we have need of you say I
[1:05:14] sin he said cry Abba Father
[1:05:17] if you confess your sins I'm faithful
[1:05:20] and just for to forgive them
[1:05:24] he doesn't want you
[1:05:27] looking
[1:05:28] outside
[1:05:31] for something outside to stimulate you
[1:05:35] what he's wanting to stimulate you is
[1:05:39] his attributes
[1:05:42] and you understand it's his Mercy it's
[1:05:47] his grace it's his love it's his wisdom
[1:05:49] it's his counsel
[1:05:53] it's his hand that's what he wants you
[1:05:56] to rest and that's what he wants you to
[1:05:58] fellowship with he was the evidence of
[1:06:01] the holy spirit is Jesus Christ revealed
[1:06:04] to you personally
[1:06:08] amen I know him
[1:06:10] I don't know about him
[1:06:12] how do you know him you only know him by
[1:06:18] his attributes
[1:06:22] I've told you the story I had never
[1:06:25] never
[1:06:26] been been healed
[1:06:31] and I look I was a young man
[1:06:35] you know I had colds and stuff and got
[1:06:37] over them but I had never experienced a
[1:06:40] miracle of healing
[1:06:42] well in my infancy
[1:06:44] and not understanding the how beautiful
[1:06:48] God's extended Mercy is
[1:06:51] I really started praying
[1:06:53] oh God I want to feel your healing touch
[1:06:57] I want to be healed
[1:07:00] and you say well were you praying to be
[1:07:01] healed no I was praying to be sick
[1:07:09] really
[1:07:11] because he couldn't heal me
[1:07:13] until I was sick
[1:07:16] so I told you I went out in the log
[1:07:18] woods and I'm working I'm working a
[1:07:20] choker chain and jerking logs out of the
[1:07:22] wood and I pulled this great big log off
[1:07:24] of a and there was a bent over sapling
[1:07:27] and when that log went off that sapling
[1:07:29] sprung up it caught me under the arm
[1:07:31] flipped me up in the air my glove went
[1:07:34] way up in the air and when it came up it
[1:07:36] caught the inside of my thumb and just
[1:07:38] broke my thumb and put my shoulder out
[1:07:41] in everything
[1:07:44] now I was hurting
[1:07:48] I was almost hurting so bad I forgot to
[1:07:51] ask God to heal me
[1:07:55] isn't that funny
[1:07:58] we get so caught up in the problem
[1:08:02] that we forget about the fountain
[1:08:06] we get so self-centered
[1:08:09] so here I am I got this broken thumb and
[1:08:11] my arms dislocated and all of a sudden
[1:08:14] I'm invited to go to Japan
[1:08:17] and Korea
[1:08:19] and distribute Church age books with my
[1:08:23] good friend Jack Vance well I couldn't
[1:08:26] go like this
[1:08:29] and I wanted to go
[1:08:32] so I'd gotten service and I I could
[1:08:34] hardly get Mom and I just started
[1:08:36] praying oh God
[1:08:38] please heal me
[1:08:40] so I can go on this trip I can't go on
[1:08:43] this trip God would you just would you
[1:08:45] just please
[1:08:47] make this get better
[1:08:50] and all of a sudden I just felt the make
[1:08:53] my thumb all of a sudden it just came
[1:08:56] loose and I began to close my hand and I
[1:09:00] began to praise him and I lifted my arm
[1:09:02] before he knew it I was waving my arm
[1:09:05] and then sneezing my head and everything
[1:09:08] and I was praising God and I was
[1:09:11] instantly made well
[1:09:15] I didn't have to go that route
[1:09:19] do you understand my if I would have had
[1:09:22] faith
[1:09:25] in the beginning
[1:09:28] and accepted that everything that he is
[1:09:32] I am
[1:09:33] but I didn't know that
[1:09:36] uh
[1:09:39] 50 years ago
[1:09:44] but I've learned it
[1:09:47] I've learned that all the attributes
[1:09:51] all that he is
[1:09:53] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:09:56] and all that Christ was he poured into
[1:10:00] his church
[1:10:01] so we understand that God wanted to
[1:10:04] express all these attributes so in
[1:10:06] closing let's turn to Galatians and
[1:10:12] and I'll tell you Galatians we'll read
[1:10:14] in the fifth chapter of Galatians but
[1:10:18] I'll tell you if you go back and read a
[1:10:20] little bit in Galatians 4 he gives a
[1:10:23] beautiful type of the bonds woman and
[1:10:25] the free woman and and how that how that
[1:10:29] the children of desolation have more
[1:10:33] children than the children that have a
[1:10:36] husband and how that one's represented
[1:10:39] in Hagar and can the others represented
[1:10:42] in Jerusalem and it's a a beautiful
[1:10:44] allegory of election
[1:10:47] and so but we're going to read here in
[1:10:49] the fifth chapter now we're talking
[1:10:52] about act by your fruits that you know
[1:10:54] them
[1:10:55] and that attributes manifest attributes
[1:10:58] so the attributes of God
[1:11:03] the love that he expressed
[1:11:07] the kindness that he expressed the
[1:11:11] long-suffering that he expressed
[1:11:14] the patience that he expressed how many
[1:11:18] believes God was patient with Israel
[1:11:21] oh my
[1:11:25] he he he knew what his thoughts were
[1:11:30] towards them
[1:11:32] and and all these
[1:11:34] things that God
[1:11:37] projected
[1:11:39] in his love towards us
[1:11:42] because we're his own
[1:11:46] so he doesn't love us with something
[1:11:49] that's
[1:11:50] uh
[1:11:52] artificial
[1:11:54] he loves us with himself
[1:11:59] you understand that God loves you with
[1:12:02] himself his love for you is the very
[1:12:05] Capstone
[1:12:08] that he's capping our lives off with
[1:12:13] in fact John says God is love
[1:12:16] so all the attributes that God is
[1:12:20] everything that God is
[1:12:23] we are going to become
[1:12:27] that's the beauty of this because the
[1:12:30] attributes that God expressed
[1:12:33] towards us
[1:12:35] will manifest
[1:12:38] in US
[1:12:40] and we will possess the same attributes
[1:12:44] that he possessed
[1:12:47] this is the crowning
[1:12:52] uh
[1:12:53] of the his Earthly bride
[1:12:57] this Union
[1:12:59] with the Heavenly bride group and the
[1:13:02] Earthly bride this crowning what is your
[1:13:07] crown
[1:13:09] your crowns that Capstone is that
[1:13:12] perfect love if the final gift of God to
[1:13:16] you is that you possess all the
[1:13:20] attributes that he expressed
[1:13:24] does that not make anybody Shout
[1:13:28] Hallelujah
[1:13:33] when I was a young man I'd jump up above
[1:13:36] this
[1:13:36] platform like Lenny's dog
[1:13:41] she got a puppy that jumped 10 feet in
[1:13:43] the air straight up
[1:13:52] everything that he is
[1:13:56] that's what he said
[1:13:58] will be like God
[1:14:02] well what was God God was love we'll
[1:14:05] have perfect love we'll have the
[1:14:07] attributes you know we always think that
[1:14:09] that the power of God is in some sort of
[1:14:13] power and the prophet God turns around
[1:14:15] says power without character satanic
[1:14:21] you want to stop somebody in their
[1:14:23] tracks you think well if I can give him
[1:14:25] a left hook or something you just turn
[1:14:27] the other cheek
[1:14:30] if someone's gossiping about you you
[1:14:33] don't render evil
[1:14:35] for evil
[1:14:36] but you render good
[1:14:39] those attributes
[1:14:42] that God expressed to you towards you
[1:14:45] that were freely given to you
[1:14:48] to make you what that you are you take
[1:14:52] possession of those attributes then
[1:14:55] those attributes Empower you to overcome
[1:14:59] Satan and every circumstance and every
[1:15:03] situation that there is because now you
[1:15:06] are a possessor of the same love that he
[1:15:10] had that overcame your sins for you
[1:15:15] oh I like it
[1:15:17] let's close
[1:15:21] was that Amen to the word or Amen to
[1:15:23] Let's close
[1:15:25] I know you want that ice cream and I'm a
[1:15:28] man of my word I pray hope
[1:15:34] and don't let anybody join the
[1:15:36] congregation at Brahms
[1:15:39] no they can if they want an ice cream
[1:15:41] I'll buy them one too
[1:15:43] is let's read
[1:15:44] in 5.
[1:15:47] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[1:15:50] wherewith Christ has made us free
[1:15:53] and be not entangled again with the Yoke
[1:15:57] of bondage
[1:15:59] let's close that book
[1:16:02] behold I Paul say unto you
[1:16:04] that if he be circumcised Christ's
[1:16:07] profit you nothing
[1:16:09] for I testify again to every man that is
[1:16:13] circumcised that he is a debtor to do
[1:16:16] the whole law Christ has become of no
[1:16:20] effect unto you
[1:16:22] wherefore if ye are justified by the law
[1:16:26] you are fallen from Grace
[1:16:30] by Grace ye are saved
[1:16:33] for we through the spirit
[1:16:36] wait for the hope of the righteousness
[1:16:40] by faith
[1:16:43] for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
[1:16:46] availeth anything
[1:16:48] nor uncircumcision
[1:16:51] but faith that worketh by
[1:16:54] love
[1:16:58] faith is God to work
[1:17:01] within the same attributes
[1:17:04] that God expressed it
[1:17:07] let me put it this way God believed so
[1:17:10] much in you brother
[1:17:13] that he was willing to lay his life down
[1:17:17] on your behalf because he had confidence
[1:17:22] in you
[1:17:28] now if you came and sat in my living
[1:17:30] room and said oh brother maker I'd like
[1:17:32] to borrow this money
[1:17:41] you'd find out that I'd be going through
[1:17:44] a real drill
[1:17:46] am I going to get this money back
[1:17:49] I got a book full
[1:17:53] of promissory notes
[1:18:00] well they had a plan to pay me back
[1:18:04] you know the plan was that everything
[1:18:06] goes good and they make all these extra
[1:18:09] hours and they get all this extra money
[1:18:11] they'll pay me back
[1:18:12] but they end up with a flat tire
[1:18:16] they talk too long on the phone the
[1:18:19] washing machine broke down they got laid
[1:18:21] off from work they got sick and now they
[1:18:24] don't have the plan
[1:18:26] that's why the scripture says don't lend
[1:18:30] expecting to get paid back
[1:18:33] but a real Christian won't take
[1:18:34] advantage of that
[1:18:40] but I'd have to have confidence in you
[1:18:44] or in the word of God
[1:18:48] that says go ahead I'll take care of you
[1:18:53] but God had enough confidence in the
[1:18:56] seed that was in you
[1:19:00] that he laid down his life on your
[1:19:03] behalf
[1:19:05] he had faith
[1:19:08] that worketh by love
[1:19:11] you want to know his faith look at what
[1:19:13] he prayed for in Saint John 17 father
[1:19:16] that they may be one as we aren't that
[1:19:18] they might know the love that I have and
[1:19:20] the love that is in me would be in them
[1:19:22] also he's praying all this praise
[1:19:24] fiction to lay down his life not just to
[1:19:28] lay it down but for you
[1:19:32] because that was the attributes that was
[1:19:34] in him
[1:19:36] and he knew that if he expressed these
[1:19:38] attributes
[1:19:40] and he extended these attributes that
[1:19:44] these attributes would come back and be
[1:19:48] manifested in the bride that as he is so
[1:19:52] are we
[1:19:55] oh what a what a love affair
[1:19:59] of attributes manifest
[1:20:02] manifesting attributes
[1:20:06] he said
[1:20:09] which worketh by love
[1:20:11] ye did run well
[1:20:14] who did hinder you that you should have
[1:20:17] not obey the truth
[1:20:20] this verse 8 persuasion cometh not of
[1:20:24] him that calleth you
[1:20:30] there's Persuasions out there
[1:20:35] that aren't of the spirit that called
[1:20:37] you
[1:20:38] that aren't of the voice that you heard
[1:20:42] that aren't of the quickening seed
[1:20:44] that protects you
[1:20:52] A little leaven
[1:20:54] leaveneth the whole lump
[1:20:58] I have confidence in you through the
[1:21:01] Lord
[1:21:03] that you will be none other minded
[1:21:06] but he that troubleth you shall bear his
[1:21:10] judgment
[1:21:12] whosoever he be
[1:21:15] and I Brethren if yet I preach
[1:21:18] circumcision
[1:21:20] why do I yet suffer persecution
[1:21:24] then is the offense
[1:21:26] of the Cross ceased
[1:21:29] I would that ye were even cut off
[1:21:33] which I would that you were
[1:21:37] that that they were even cut off which
[1:21:41] trouble you
[1:21:42] for Brethren he have been called unto
[1:21:46] Liberty
[1:21:47] only used not Liberty for occasion to
[1:21:51] the flesh
[1:21:55] but by love
[1:21:57] serve
[1:21:58] one another
[1:22:01] now he's talking about this expression
[1:22:04] and manifestation and of these
[1:22:08] attributes
[1:22:14] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[1:22:19] even in this Thou shalt love thy
[1:22:22] neighbor as thyself
[1:22:27] but if he
[1:22:29] bite and devour one another take heed
[1:22:33] that ye be not consumed one of another
[1:22:38] this I say then
[1:22:40] walk in the spirit
[1:22:43] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:22:47] flesh
[1:22:48] for the Lust For flesh lustest against
[1:22:51] the spirit and the spirit against the
[1:22:54] flesh
[1:22:56] and these two are contrary one to the
[1:22:59] other so that you cannot do the things
[1:23:02] that ye would do
[1:23:04] but if ye be led of the spirit
[1:23:08] ye are not under the law
[1:23:11] for the works of the flesh are
[1:23:14] manifested in these
[1:23:17] now watch the attributes
[1:23:22] of the first husband
[1:23:26] these are the attributes of unbelief
[1:23:28] these are the attributes of the flesh
[1:23:32] these are the attributes of the carnal
[1:23:36] man these are the fruits
[1:23:40] by which they are known
[1:23:45] he said in the works of the flesh are
[1:23:47] manifested which are these idolatry
[1:23:50] fornication and cleanliness lavishness
[1:23:55] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[1:23:59] emulations wrath Strife seditions
[1:24:03] heresies ending murders drunkenness
[1:24:08] reviling and such like
[1:24:11] of the which I have told you before as I
[1:24:15] have also told you in times past that
[1:24:18] they which do such things shall not
[1:24:21] inherit the kingdom of God
[1:24:24] right
[1:24:26] but you already have an inheritance
[1:24:29] in the kingdom of God
[1:24:33] how many knows that
[1:24:36] amen now you used to walk in those
[1:24:39] things
[1:24:42] and that's why they question you
[1:24:45] what happened
[1:24:47] you used to walk with me in these things
[1:24:49] you used to do these things but you say
[1:24:52] something happened to me
[1:24:57] an attribute came
[1:25:00] to me
[1:25:03] that's what it was
[1:25:05] unattribute of God to save you
[1:25:09] out of Destruction
[1:25:12] to lift you up out of the Mirey clay
[1:25:15] the love of God was expressed to me in
[1:25:19] his son God so loved the world he sent
[1:25:23] his attribute to me
[1:25:25] that if I would believe it and see it
[1:25:28] but not only did I I didn't see it of my
[1:25:32] own accord
[1:25:34] I didn't believe it of my own accord
[1:25:38] he gave me Revelation
[1:25:41] he quickened it to me and made it known
[1:25:45] to me in such a way that it couldn't be
[1:25:48] doubted
[1:25:51] amen
[1:25:55] do you make mistakes yes are you saved
[1:25:58] yes
[1:26:03] how can you be saved
[1:26:06] by works no
[1:26:11] well how do you know you're going to be
[1:26:13] there he said Till
[1:26:15] and that settles it
[1:26:17] he put my name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:26:19] Life how do you know it's on the land
[1:26:21] Book of Life by faith in love
[1:26:24] how do you know I heard the voice
[1:26:28] I got the Revelation I understood when
[1:26:33] it was preached that that was me
[1:26:36] that's me
[1:26:41] he said well you're not worthy he didn't
[1:26:43] say I had to be worthy
[1:26:45] all he said was he had to think it in
[1:26:48] the beginning he had to start the work
[1:26:51] he had to perform the work he made the
[1:26:54] choice he's the Potter over the clay to
[1:26:57] make one unto honor and one under
[1:26:59] dishonor
[1:27:01] you don't like the fact that I'm safe
[1:27:04] talk it over with him
[1:27:10] let him know I Lord I'm just not going
[1:27:13] to be happy in heaven if brother McGarry
[1:27:16] is there
[1:27:21] now who do you think's going to be there
[1:27:26] because he always promised me to make me
[1:27:29] happy
[1:27:31] but you can be there it ain't going to
[1:27:33] bother me
[1:27:34] I'm going to be so happy that I made it
[1:27:37] I don't care who else is there
[1:27:41] my Crown's coming off my head as little
[1:27:44] as it might be as fast as I can get it
[1:27:47] off
[1:27:48] at his feet
[1:27:52] where were we
[1:27:56] he says all these things
[1:27:58] he says won't inherit the kingdom of God
[1:28:00] but the fruits of the spirit now these
[1:28:04] fruits
[1:28:07] are the very attributes
[1:28:11] that God used
[1:28:15] towards you
[1:28:18] to save and redeem you
[1:28:23] these are the fruits
[1:28:25] of his spirit
[1:28:28] and that's why when you're born to Kent
[1:28:31] right and you can't be born again unless
[1:28:35] you close that book
[1:28:37] and accept the the life that he's given
[1:28:40] you and I know everybody goes back well
[1:28:43] I did this when I knew better
[1:28:50] oh
[1:28:52] everything you ever did you knew better
[1:28:58] when you took your first cookie you knew
[1:29:00] better
[1:29:03] the first time I stole something I
[1:29:05] didn't just go in and steal it and put
[1:29:07] in my pocket I had developed another
[1:29:09] method
[1:29:10] it was called changing the price tag
[1:29:15] it's just when I went to try to buy a 55
[1:29:18] reel for two dollars and fifty cents it
[1:29:21] didn't work
[1:29:24] I knew it was wrong
[1:29:28] it buzzed all over me it was wrong
[1:29:32] I didn't know about salvation I didn't
[1:29:34] know this but the very conscience of a
[1:29:37] man
[1:29:38] tells him when he's wrong
[1:29:41] that's why the world is without excuse
[1:29:47] um
[1:29:52] man I feel like a good Baptist preacher
[1:29:57] is it but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:29:59] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:30:04] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:30:07] against such there is no law
[1:30:10] and they that are in Christ have
[1:30:12] crucified the flesh along with the
[1:30:15] affections in lust if we live in the
[1:30:18] spirit let us also walk in the spirit
[1:30:23] let us not be uh
[1:30:26] be desirous of vainglory provoking one
[1:30:30] another envying
[1:30:33] one another and so we see now
[1:30:37] that this great plan of God has finally
[1:30:40] coming down to a head
[1:30:42] she's come up through the ages she's
[1:30:45] brought the seed of life he's waved the
[1:30:48] Sheep offering before us the Eagles
[1:30:50] flowing over us we've seen what that is
[1:30:54] that we want to be and now we're coming
[1:30:56] down to the time
[1:30:59] where every attribute that he expressed
[1:31:03] to us
[1:31:05] is now going to be manifested in us
[1:31:09] because he sets the Capstone of Love
[1:31:12] Upon Us of which that we were in him
[1:31:18] in the beginning
[1:31:19] oh it's an invisible Union
[1:31:23] of the attributes
[1:31:26] now being formed in the bride
[1:31:31] because the word was made flesh and now
[1:31:35] the flesh is be made word and now she's
[1:31:38] becoming little Messiahs that's what
[1:31:42] we're shooting for
[1:31:45] that's what our promise is
[1:31:50] do we love the rain yes we love the rain
[1:31:54] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:31:56] unjust Let It Rain
[1:32:01] Let It Rain Lord
[1:32:02] but I'm not satisfied
[1:32:05] until I'm mature
[1:32:08] and I'm ripened and I'm brought into
[1:32:11] that image of Christ
[1:32:14] until the very attributes
[1:32:18] that
[1:32:20] he expressed
[1:32:22] or manifested in me
[1:32:25] and I in him become one father that they
[1:32:30] may be one
[1:32:31] as we are one and that's the hope and
[1:32:35] the glory of the church do you believe
[1:32:37] that amen let's Stand Together
[1:32:43] we'll say a quick prayer
[1:32:48] will sing a song
[1:32:51] and all that want to go to Brahms
[1:32:54] will invade that place
[1:32:57] and we'll have a Revival
[1:32:59] over there
[1:33:02] you love them tonight
[1:33:04] Oh what a beautiful
[1:33:06] beautiful relationship we have oh that
[1:33:11] that's what makes your heart
[1:33:13] jump with joy
[1:33:15] to think
[1:33:17] that there is a Grace
[1:33:20] of power
[1:33:22] and a Love extended in this age
[1:33:26] that's going to allow me to overcome My
[1:33:29] Flesh
[1:33:32] Hallelujah
[1:33:34] you say can it be done yes
[1:33:37] will it be done yes because you're
[1:33:41] predestinated to it let's pray
[1:33:45] are gracious
[1:33:47] Heavenly Father
[1:33:54] Lord every attribute
[1:33:57] that you were
[1:34:01] you poured into Jesus Christ
[1:34:03] was the mystery of God
[1:34:06] revealed
[1:34:10] Lord and then you sent that same spirit
[1:34:15] back upon us
[1:34:18] and you said fear not little flock
[1:34:22] it's the father's good pleasure
[1:34:26] to give you the kingdom
[1:34:30] you said my sheep hear my voice
[1:34:35] and another they will not follow
[1:34:40] and if I have begun to work
[1:34:43] I will finish it to the end
[1:34:48] Lord we look at ourselves and we don't
[1:34:50] look nothing like those attributes
[1:34:52] sometimes
[1:34:54] foreign
[1:34:58] we don't
[1:35:00] seem like that can be possible
[1:35:05] but it's not possible by works
[1:35:08] it's possible by promise
[1:35:13] and Abraham was impossible for him to
[1:35:16] have a child
[1:35:20] him and Sarah
[1:35:25] but in a great allegory in type
[1:35:29] they were transformed
[1:35:32] into something that they weren't
[1:35:36] to something that
[1:35:38] could fulfill
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:41] the promise
[1:35:45] and Lord that's what I
[1:35:47] my heart's desire is is that every
[1:35:50] believer can come to the revelation of
[1:35:55] that that transforming power is now
[1:35:57] working in that bride
[1:36:00] forming that bride
[1:36:03] into the bride of Christ
[1:36:06] and that bride stands
[1:36:09] with every attribute that he has
[1:36:12] that's why he loves her
[1:36:16] because she's him
[1:36:21] these two
[1:36:23] that were Twain
[1:36:25] have become one
[1:36:28] and they're in a great love affair
[1:36:30] father
[1:36:31] [Music]
[1:36:33] and Lord how I realize
[1:36:37] that I don't have the words to speak it
[1:36:39] but
[1:36:40] if I could I would
[1:36:43] but I know and believe
[1:36:46] that this lies within the message for
[1:36:49] every believer
[1:36:51] and we'll just stay with it Lord I know
[1:36:53] it'll produce
[1:36:55] what it's prophesied
[1:36:57] to produce May every one of us take
[1:37:02] care
[1:37:05] be sincere
[1:37:08] do all that we can to separate ourselves
[1:37:11] from the things of the world
[1:37:14] and every time we see you father in one
[1:37:17] of your great manifested attributes
[1:37:20] may we look up and say that's I see
[1:37:23] something
[1:37:25] that I want to be
[1:37:30] and he says jump
[1:37:33] because you're not theirs
[1:37:36] your mind
[1:37:38] and I accept that Lord with all my heart
[1:37:42] that I am yours let's sing this
[1:37:46] you love them amen
