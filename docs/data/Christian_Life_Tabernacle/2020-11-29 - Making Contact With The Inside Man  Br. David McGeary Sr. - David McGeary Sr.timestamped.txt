[1:46] of the lord jesus christ
[1:49] amen in fact
[1:51] that's really
[1:53] what the holy spirit is
[1:55] it's the personal revelation

[2:04] the spirit of god

[3:23] [Music]
[3:26] and be with her mother
[3:29] and
[3:32] lovely christian lady and

[3:41] ask the angels of the lord to come give
[3:44] her peace in her spirit
[3:47] if i could take her sorrow away i would
[3:50] but it's only natural to sorrow
[3:53] and to grieve

[4:11] for your throne this morning
[4:15] because there was a gate great price
[4:17] that was paid that we could enter into
[4:20] your gates
[4:22] and that we could kneel at your feet and
[4:26] lay our petitions before you
[4:30] lord and we know that you're a merciful
[4:32] god

[5:55] amen
[5:56] amen god bless you let's turn over to
[5:58] the book of colossians this morning
[6:01] and
[6:23] and uh
[6:25] i'll see where we want to
[6:28] kind of read this morning um
[6:34] if i can find my
[6:36] spot this morning
[6:44] that i'd like to read from
[7:00] let's see if i think it's the ninth
[7:02] verse
[7:07] let's start in the ninth verse
[7:10] it says for this cause
[7:12] we also
[7:14] since the day we heard it
[7:17] do not cease to pray
[7:19] for you
[7:20] and to desire that ye might be filled
[7:24] with the knowledge of his will
[7:28] in all wisdom and spiritual
[7:31] understanding
[7:33] amen isn't that what we want the
[7:35] knowledge of his will
[7:37] wisdom and spiritual understanding
[7:40] that we might walk worthy
[7:43] of the lord
[7:44] unto all pleasing
[7:47] being fruitful in every good work
[7:51] and increasing in the knowledge of god
[7:55] strengthened with all might
[7:58] according to his glorious power
[8:02] unto all patience and long-suffering
[8:06] with joyfulness
[8:09] giving thanks unto the father which hath
[8:14] made us
[8:15] meant to be partakers of the inheritance
[8:18] of the saints
[8:20] in light
[8:21] who have delivered us from the power of
[8:24] darkness
[8:25] and have translated us into the kingdom
[8:30] of his dear son
[8:32] and i want to
[8:34] hold this thing
[8:35] because i want to talk just a moment on
[8:38] a part of this subject
[8:40] who has translated us
[8:44] into the kingdom of his dear son
[8:48] in whom we have redemption through his
[8:50] blood
[8:51] even the forgiveness
[8:53] of sins
[8:55] our gracious father we ask you to bless
[8:57] your word and your precious name we pray
[8:59] amen
[9:00] god bless you may be seated this morning
[9:07] we we have a lot out this morning but
[9:09] i'm certainly
[9:11] happy to be here with all of us this
[9:13] morning so
[9:16] we can certainly have
[9:18] a wonderful
[9:20] uh time in the lord
[9:24] and um
[9:25] so you know yeah
[9:27] sometimes during the week
[9:30] you know i i pray and i just you know i
[9:33] just kind of
[9:34] go through my week if i could say it
[9:37] this way
[9:38] with one ear always listening you know
[9:42] just waiting for the
[9:44] lord to give me unction
[9:47] and i think that's what a christian does
[9:49] is they wait on the lord
[9:52] many things we don't understand many
[9:54] things we don't
[9:57] we don't even know what's going to come
[9:59] our way
[10:00] but we have promises in the scripture
[10:03] and and the promises of in the scripture
[10:06] tell us that he'll lead us and guide us
[10:09] in all truth and
[10:10] and so you you christian just lives his
[10:13] life if i could express it like that
[10:16] with one ear towards the sky always
[10:20] listening for the lord always waiting
[10:22] for that impression
[10:24] on his heart and and i often do that
[10:29] when i get done ministering
[10:32] and i've poured my heart out on a
[10:34] certain thought
[10:36] it leaves me very empty it leaves me
[10:38] like what am i going to preach next
[10:41] you know and i start to feel the
[10:43] pressure
[10:44] and
[10:45] and then i start looking to find out
[10:47] who's in town to preach for me and
[10:50] and then i get and find out who can come
[10:52] and
[10:53] and i start making a big list of
[10:55] everybody that i'm going to get to take
[10:57] my job
[10:59] and then retirement starts crossing my
[11:02] mind and
[11:03] and and you go through that process but
[11:05] in that process you just start to listen
[11:08] and the lord will come and he'll just
[11:09] lay something
[11:11] on my heart
[11:12] and and usually he he will lead me
[11:17] to a um a message or a sermon or a
[11:21] scripture
[11:22] or even sometimes a song
[11:25] but what came to me was
[11:28] the message and
[11:30] knoweth it not
[11:32] and
[11:33] and there's a there were several
[11:36] uh questions that
[11:39] have kind of
[11:41] floated around and
[11:44] and
[11:46] and things that have popped up and uh so
[11:50] i just thought you know
[11:52] um
[11:53] this morning this message just seemed to
[11:55] come and answer so many of those things
[11:59] for me and
[12:02] and you know one of the things that
[12:08] we realize that
[12:11] um you know i just want to take a moment
[12:14] is this great
[12:15] political
[12:17] a turmoil
[12:19] that is in the land and
[12:22] and yeah as you noticed i i've never
[12:27] went down those roads and i've never
[12:30] endorsed uh
[12:33] anything or tried to influence
[12:36] anybody or or talk much
[12:38] of politics over here but i i want to
[12:41] talk a few second
[12:43] seconds this morning on politics
[12:47] and uh
[12:49] and
[12:50] i i want to use my
[12:54] thing i did preach
[12:56] a sermon called that we have a candidate
[13:00] amen and uh
[13:02] and i'm i'm i'm standing for that
[13:04] candidate again this morning
[13:07] hoping that's where you've cast your
[13:09] vote
[13:10] and it says
[13:12] who hath delivered us from the power of
[13:16] darkness
[13:17] and has translated us into the kingdom
[13:22] of his dear son
[13:26] and you know i i notice sometimes if
[13:29] we're not careful
[13:30] and i i say this especially
[13:33] to
[13:35] young people when
[13:38] usually college students and
[13:41] young professionals
[13:43] you are more apt to get caught up in the
[13:46] political environment
[13:48] than someone like myself
[13:51] you know
[13:52] i haven't been through too many
[13:54] presidents i believe that
[13:58] i don't know if truman was president
[14:00] when i was born or eisenhower but
[14:03] that's how many presidents i've been
[14:05] through
[14:06] and uh the world just keeps going
[14:11] you know
[14:12] just
[14:13] people that don't have nothing else to
[14:15] talk about talk about that
[14:18] and uh
[14:20] but
[14:21] uh
[14:22] and and you're more inclined to get
[14:24] involved
[14:26] you know
[14:27] and be influenced and because
[14:30] spirits are out there to influence
[14:34] to try to push you to one side to the
[14:38] other
[14:38] and
[14:40] and so that's what we battle
[14:42] we battle spiritual wickedness in high
[14:45] places
[14:46] and as it as we would call it the power
[14:49] of darkness
[14:50] and i want just to read you as couple
[14:52] statements this morning it says
[14:55] we will
[14:57] we will never
[14:58] do any good with politics
[15:04] it's rotten
[15:07] okay
[15:08] now
[15:09] you can sit down all day long and
[15:11] someone can tell me how wonderful donald
[15:13] trump is
[15:15] and another person can tell me
[15:17] no matter
[15:19] how
[15:19] wonderful mr
[15:22] biden is
[15:24] but
[15:25] they're rotten
[15:28] okay
[15:30] now pick your rotten apple
[15:34] all right they're rotten
[15:37] so alls people have done is they came up
[15:39] the two rotten apples
[15:42] and they said i like the look of this
[15:44] rotten apple better than i like the look
[15:46] of that rotten apple but they will both
[15:48] make you sick
[15:52] they will both make you spiritually sick
[15:56] that's just how it is
[15:59] and
[16:01] and he says it's rotten
[16:04] god's idea
[16:06] of having a king
[16:08] a righteous king is right
[16:12] so why do you think god translates you
[16:17] into a kingdom
[16:23] if you're in politics you've not been
[16:25] translated yet
[16:28] if you're packing a bumper sticker on
[16:30] your car
[16:32] that says trump is hating or abiding his
[16:36] greatness or
[16:39] i mean
[16:40] that must be your car speaking
[16:47] you understand because
[16:50] if a person
[16:52] that's driving that car
[16:55] has been translated
[16:59] then
[17:00] you're in another kingdom
[17:04] you know
[17:05] and that's what happens
[17:07] but let me tell you there's a lot of
[17:09] emotion
[17:10] in um
[17:12] and and in having a cause
[17:16] and get fired up
[17:19] and want to straighten out injustice and
[17:22] and
[17:23] want to go out there and oh this is so
[17:25] bad and we need to straighten this out
[17:28] and have something to fight for and
[17:32] and we need to rise up and march
[17:36] you know
[17:37] and
[17:39] it's vain
[17:42] it's vain
[17:43] you've got to remember
[17:46] these
[17:47] men do not control this world
[17:52] satan controls the world
[17:55] that's why we read and went through god
[17:57] of this evil age satan controls this
[18:00] world
[18:02] they have a leader
[18:04] and it's satan
[18:06] amen
[18:07] you know what i mean so if you want to
[18:10] march for
[18:12] satan's cause
[18:14] because it's got a different face on it
[18:18] and then you know
[18:20] or then this the other side over here
[18:22] has a face on it
[18:24] i want you to listen this because i i
[18:26] want
[18:27] if i can help some of you escape
[18:30] politics
[18:34] politics is a spirit of the devil
[18:40] it's the spirit of the devil it's not
[18:42] the holy spirit
[18:46] and and it's it's very enticing
[18:49] because they absolutely
[18:52] make you feel like you're making a
[18:54] difference
[19:01] you know what i mean if he could offer
[19:03] adam all these kingdoms to jesus yes sir
[19:08] you know what i mean
[19:10] if he could say i'll give you all the
[19:12] kingdoms of all the world
[19:15] you can have all this if you'll fall
[19:17] down
[19:18] and and worship me
[19:21] he was
[19:22] willing to trade that
[19:26] for worship
[19:28] because he already had the worship of
[19:31] the world
[19:33] there was only one person that wasn't
[19:36] worshiping it was the one that had
[19:39] another kingdom
[19:40] his own kingdom
[19:42] and his kingdom wasn't going to bow down
[19:45] for to that kingdom
[19:47] so my goal this morning is to get you to
[19:51] step back
[19:52] and take a breath
[19:56] and not get caught up
[19:58] in all this hatred
[20:01] that's out there
[20:03] all of this division trying to divide us
[20:06] from what country we come from what land
[20:09] we've come from what how that our
[20:12] the the people have been treated
[20:15] well do you want me to spend the next
[20:17] two months letting you know how bad the
[20:19] irish people
[20:21] were treated
[20:24] i could have you in tears
[20:28] how irish babies starve to death
[20:33] because the british
[20:35] wouldn't feed them
[20:37] how they were indentured enslaved
[20:41] in slavery
[20:43] and oh my goodness and
[20:46] but guess what
[20:48] it's all gone
[20:53] right and
[20:54] in those days there was an elect lady of
[20:56] the bride
[20:59] that listened to the gospel of patrick
[21:03] and patrick was no more catholic than
[21:05] [Music]
[21:07] then i don't know who
[21:10] but it's just vain so listen
[21:12] listen this morning
[21:15] never do any good by politics it's
[21:17] rotten
[21:18] god has
[21:20] god's idea of having a king a righteous
[21:23] king is right
[21:24] but politics is just simply
[21:28] spread out
[21:30] you can buy anything out
[21:33] cheat
[21:35] lie
[21:36] steal
[21:37] everything else
[21:39] as i said a few sundays ago
[21:43] and look where
[21:44] you're at see
[21:47] nothing but just a crooked mass of
[21:50] everything
[21:52] but a righteous king
[21:55] can make his own laws
[21:58] he says and you can kill a man
[22:01] you know a good
[22:03] politics
[22:05] that's all right you get out of it
[22:08] and so it is
[22:10] the democracy is a good idea
[22:14] but it won't work
[22:16] just like communism and all things in
[22:19] common sounds good
[22:22] but it won't work
[22:24] no the god oh let me did you you have
[22:28] that on the board thank you
[22:31] the
[22:32] the god way of having a king like david
[22:37] was right
[22:39] you got one
[22:41] mind
[22:42] centered over
[22:44] like one leader
[22:47] and a bunch of peace and so forth
[22:50] you
[22:51] you can't take two or three of them
[22:56] then you mess them all together
[23:00] you come up with any kind of idea
[23:05] now don't you see what's happening
[23:07] you've got conservatives
[23:10] you've got
[23:12] moderates
[23:14] you've got
[23:15] progressives
[23:18] you can't take two or three ideas
[23:22] mix them all together you'll get it all
[23:26] messed up
[23:27] god's way is having a king
[23:31] one mind
[23:33] let this mind be in you
[23:37] that was in christ
[23:41] that's what
[23:43] it's about
[23:47] it's not about anything else but the
[23:49] lord jesus amen
[23:51] you know and
[23:52] and satan appears as an angel of
[23:56] light
[23:58] always offering something if you follow
[24:01] me
[24:02] okay but the father in heaven knows what
[24:05] you have need of even before you ask
[24:11] a righteous man shall not beg bread
[24:15] if
[24:16] we are about a kingdom another kingdom
[24:21] we preach the gospel so people can be
[24:24] born into the kingdom of god
[24:29] where the king
[24:31] is ruling their life
[24:33] the king has one message
[24:37] the king
[24:38] makes the law
[24:40] amen
[24:43] not a group of men called congress
[24:46] not a group of men called senator
[24:49] not an executive order we don't live by
[24:52] the sec executive order we live by
[24:55] divine order
[24:58] amen so the season's over
[25:02] in a few months
[25:04] they'll still be fussing and arguing and
[25:06] carrying on
[25:07] let's just set our wings and soar above
[25:10] all this stuff
[25:13] amen i hate to see that creep into the
[25:16] church that's right i really do i hate
[25:19] it i hate to see i hate to think that
[25:23] young people and believers in this
[25:25] message are promoting and talking about
[25:28] such things i just feel i want to warn
[25:31] you
[25:32] so much
[25:34] he says let me read another statement
[25:37] this is paragraph 58
[25:40] in tucson arizona
[25:42] we've got a woman judged there in the
[25:45] city
[25:47] that's the reason the city is so
[25:49] polluted
[25:52] we got a woman ain't got no business in
[25:55] politics
[25:59] amen
[26:01] think of it just let that soak
[26:05] a minute
[26:11] i don't think a christian has much
[26:12] business in it either but that's
[26:15] my personal opinion
[26:17] a woman ain't got no business in
[26:18] politics
[26:20] she's got no business over any authority
[26:23] in the church
[26:25] her place is a man's queen at home
[26:27] outside of that she has nothing
[26:30] we know that to be the truth
[26:33] you'll never
[26:34] you'll never find
[26:36] no that sounds old-fashioned but i'm
[26:40] responsible
[26:42] and i know that after my going away from
[26:45] this earth
[26:46] them tapes and them books will be living
[26:49] on
[26:50] and many of you young children
[26:53] will find in the days to come that
[26:57] that's exactly the truth because i speak
[27:00] it
[27:01] in the name
[27:03] of the lord
[27:05] now
[27:07] you know you can start to judge
[27:10] yourselves
[27:11] especially in the political
[27:14] environment
[27:15] that we're in
[27:17] when you hear a statement
[27:19] like
[27:20] a woman has no place in politic
[27:24] you young sisters make sure that a
[27:26] spirit doesn't rise up in you
[27:30] you know
[27:31] this woman's rights and and
[27:35] you know we've got to say
[27:37] and we're just as equal
[27:40] i would thank god if i wasn't equal to
[27:43] the world
[27:46] i would thank god if i had a special
[27:49] crown of life
[27:51] and a special position that god
[27:54] hath gave me
[27:56] and and you know every
[27:59] woman can look around at the world
[28:03] and realize that there wouldn't be
[28:05] anybody here if it wasn't for them
[28:11] you know i have a mother
[28:14] i got here i was cast upon this world
[28:18] from my mother's womb
[28:21] it's all part of god's plan
[28:24] you know
[28:26] and
[28:26] and even the scripture says
[28:29] that a woman saved in child bearing now
[28:32] i'm not here this morning to go through
[28:35] all the situations for
[28:37] those that haven't been able to have
[28:39] children
[28:40] you know are they saved i'm not here to
[28:43] go through those of you that have to
[28:45] have jobs
[28:46] who are working we understand those
[28:49] things we have single mothers that's not
[28:51] the things i'm talking about i'm not
[28:53] talking about specific situations that
[28:57] that we have to follow the leadership
[28:59] there is leadership for every single one
[29:02] of those situations in the scripture
[29:07] but the scripture
[29:10] and this word of god is to present to
[29:13] you an understanding
[29:16] of the view
[29:18] and the thinking of god
[29:20] the word of god is the thoughts of god
[29:23] expressed
[29:25] and and so i i just want to just
[29:28] reach out to you this morning
[29:31] and
[29:32] and encourage you not to get caught up
[29:35] in that
[29:38] not to let that fire get started
[29:41] in you
[29:43] that rage
[29:45] in everything
[29:46] amen i i know
[29:49] there's there are people in the world
[29:50] that hate there's people in the world
[29:52] that call people names and and are
[29:56] prejudiced and and degrading and
[30:00] and
[30:00] and full of vile and evil
[30:04] there's evil women in the world
[30:07] there's evil men in the world
[30:10] people killing one another
[30:12] that there's there's women that aren't
[30:14] good women they'll just live in moral no
[30:16] matter what you do
[30:18] it's their spirit it's their nature
[30:21] you know
[30:23] and that's what the scripture says the
[30:26] scripture says that he has delivered us
[30:29] from the darkness which is the world
[30:33] and the world's dark and he's delivered
[30:36] us from that darkness and he's put us
[30:38] into another kingdom another life to
[30:42] live by another set of rules to live by
[30:45] another law
[30:47] to live by
[30:49] satan's eden they have a whole law
[30:53] that they live by
[30:55] the rule of thought that they live by
[30:58] the survival of the fittest
[31:00] all these laws and rules but
[31:03] in god's eden there's none of those laws
[31:07] there's none of those rules
[31:09] there's not even the natural rules that
[31:12] govern us like gravity and
[31:16] and barriers and
[31:18] and thought barriers and creative power
[31:21] and all those things in the other land
[31:24] all that's lifted
[31:26] amen he said if you had faith even in
[31:28] the kingdom you could say to this
[31:30] mountain or you could say to this tree
[31:33] what was he pointing out he's pointing
[31:35] out there's another kingdom with another
[31:37] set of laws and another set of ruling
[31:40] powers but we're ruled by the spirit of
[31:44] what darkness
[31:46] we fight the principalities of the air
[31:49] spiritual wickedness
[31:51] in in high places and politics is a
[31:55] spiritual wickedness
[31:59] and and
[32:00] we've got to stay away from that and
[32:02] we've got to stay away from uh getting
[32:05] caught up
[32:06] in in those things and
[32:08] and let me just say this let me prophesy
[32:11] something to you paragraph 82.
[32:14] to you just before it comes to pass
[32:18] the whole world is groping in insanity
[32:23] and will get worse
[32:24] and worse and worse
[32:27] until they'll be a bunch of maniacs
[32:30] and it's almost that way now
[32:34] can you imagine a man driving with his
[32:36] lights off
[32:38] on the wrong side of the road
[32:40] a ricky young kid
[32:43] supposed to be
[32:45] right out of high school and kill a
[32:47] bunch of people
[32:48] does that stop them
[32:51] isn't it amazing that that's what
[32:53] happened to brother branham
[33:01] does that stop them
[33:03] the next one comes right behind him
[33:06] doing the same
[33:08] thing
[33:10] what's the definition of insanity
[33:14] to keep doing the same thing over and
[33:17] over again and expecting a different
[33:19] result
[33:26] behind him doing the same thing can you
[33:28] imagine a young man
[33:30] that thinks any
[33:32] anything of himself
[33:35] getting
[33:36] out here and acting the way they do
[33:40] and you know it it's just
[33:44] you can finish
[33:45] reading
[33:47] the rest of that but let let's realize
[33:50] this morning and let's don't get
[33:53] politics
[33:55] in the church
[33:57] we're not talking we're not here to talk
[33:59] about
[34:00] what's going to happen to this country
[34:02] i've already got the saith the lord
[34:04] about this country
[34:06] it's gone
[34:08] it's gone
[34:10] but god did not leave us without a
[34:12] leader
[34:13] he did not leave us without a country he
[34:16] did not leave us without a land
[34:19] we have a land
[34:21] is there injustice in the world yes
[34:24] jesus even told them the poor you will
[34:27] always have with you
[34:31] and but there's something else that
[34:34] we're a part of
[34:35] and i just hope to hold that
[34:38] that you you hold that
[34:40] dear
[34:41] and true
[34:43] amen
[34:44] so i'd like to
[34:47] uh catch
[34:48] uh say one other thing
[34:50] um
[34:52] and i i told you this morning that
[34:54] this message uh and knoweth it not the
[34:57] lord put it on my heart
[34:59] i i believe i've got several
[35:02] and
[35:04] and many people
[35:07] are sending to me
[35:10] a a youtube post
[35:13] that
[35:14] rather tim hymns has placed in
[35:17] and i'd like to make this a statement
[35:20] concerning my brother
[35:23] i want you to know that i i believe that
[35:26] brother tim is a good
[35:29] godly brother
[35:31] he loves the lord
[35:33] he loves the scriptures
[35:36] he's a good pastor to the sheep that god
[35:39] has allowed him to lead
[35:42] he has a wonderful charismatic
[35:44] personality
[35:46] and i can uh i can consider him
[35:50] a brother
[35:53] amen and i can sit down and fellowship
[35:56] with tim in the lord jesus whom i know
[36:00] well
[36:02] and i can fellowship with him
[36:05] in the scriptures
[36:07] in the lord jesus i know the lord
[36:11] i know the power of his resurrection
[36:13] amen i know the power of his love
[36:17] everything i love the scripture
[36:19] there's no scripture in this bible that
[36:22] you can lay out to me
[36:25] that i can't believe
[36:27] i hope this doesn't offend anybody i
[36:29] have wonderful pentecostal brothers
[36:33] who i love the fellowship with
[36:36] we talk about miracles and the power of
[36:40] god and and the works that god is doing
[36:43] you know and and i i don't want you to
[36:46] be
[36:48] astounded
[36:50] in any way
[36:51] but there are people being healed this
[36:54] morning
[36:56] in churches all over dallas fort worth
[37:00] i mean you do not have an exclusive on
[37:03] the power of the resurrection
[37:06] in fact
[37:08] many times the people in the message
[37:11] are less likely to use the power of god
[37:18] but they're out there today and i love
[37:21] it
[37:22] god's a healer
[37:24] you know what i mean
[37:26] i i
[37:27] i pity the man
[37:29] that when somebody gets healed
[37:32] they get all upset
[37:34] because a baptist did it
[37:41] a real christian's happy that the guy's
[37:44] healed
[37:47] does any everybody know where healing
[37:49] comes from
[37:50] it comes from the lord
[37:52] praise the lord
[37:54] if he chooses to heal somebody i don't
[37:57] care if he uses a doctor i don't care if
[38:00] he uses a uh
[38:02] some sort of money scheme guy that's got
[38:06] some kind of hokey pokey oil
[38:09] and he goes out there and he anoints
[38:11] them with hokey pokey oil
[38:14] and that person has faith in that
[38:18] and they get well
[38:22] it's like the guy said
[38:24] hey i was blind but now i see
[38:28] [Music]
[38:29] now i i don't know you guys are the guys
[38:32] that are the the kings of israel you are
[38:34] the guys that know all the word of god
[38:37] just because it didn't come from the
[38:39] scribes or the sadducee or the pharisee
[38:43] or or the message pastor it's still
[38:46] healing
[38:48] i praise god for healing amen
[38:52] healing was a benefit of calvary
[38:56] he died for everyone
[38:59] [Music]
[39:01] amen if they go up and drink from the
[39:04] healing fountain
[39:06] is because the lord jesus made the
[39:08] healing fountain
[39:10] available to whosoever will
[39:16] you think all the people that were
[39:18] healed
[39:19] in
[39:20] brother branham's campaigns all came to
[39:23] the message
[39:27] no
[39:28] were they healed
[39:31] did we praise god for it
[39:33] yes
[39:36] what what a sorry place that we get in
[39:42] you know it's about him
[39:45] that's what it's always been about
[39:48] so i i want to say this i i don't need
[39:50] anybody else to send me
[39:54] brother tim's video
[40:01] brother tim knows me
[40:04] i love brother tim brother tim can call
[40:06] me
[40:07] yes
[40:08] i'll be happy to fellowship with brother
[40:10] tim
[40:12] i call him brother
[40:14] you know i i don't need a
[40:17] get my opinion and i know people sent
[40:21] send me things for my opinion
[40:23] i have no opinion
[40:26] i'm happy for the guy
[40:29] i'm happy
[40:31] he's happy
[40:33] he's free
[40:35] i rejoice for him he's doing what he
[40:39] feels he needs to do
[40:41] that's wonderful amen i pray for him i
[40:44] hope he's successful
[40:46] yes sir
[40:48] he's not hurting me
[40:52] okay
[40:54] and i noticed that one of the things
[40:57] that
[40:58] he pointed out and i i know it's an
[41:01] invite
[41:03] for
[41:04] people to go watch this and
[41:07] then seek this and seek that it's just
[41:10] what you do
[41:12] when you believe something
[41:14] didn't we read last week the quote that
[41:16] a a jehovah witness
[41:19] believes in what he believes
[41:22] and and a methodist believes what they
[41:25] believe
[41:26] and they're zealous about it
[41:28] in everything
[41:30] well you ought to have something in you
[41:32] that makes you salad
[41:35] you know
[41:36] and
[41:37] and
[41:38] and also i i notice my brother and in in
[41:41] he's right in doing it
[41:43] he pointed out all the bogus things
[41:47] that
[41:49] have come out of this message
[41:52] and i know one of the things that
[41:55] bothers my brother deeply
[41:57] it's the nature and the
[42:00] spirit of
[42:02] most people in this message
[42:06] who don't have the joy of the lord
[42:10] who
[42:11] are
[42:12] that really don't know where they're
[42:14] standing
[42:16] that they've they haven't gone far
[42:18] enough to get the baptism of the holy
[42:21] spirit
[42:25] and they fight amongst themselves
[42:28] now i don't feel we've been guilty of
[42:30] that here
[42:33] and and i don't feel that we've entered
[42:35] into that
[42:36] political
[42:38] arena out there
[42:40] i haven't brought
[42:42] uh
[42:44] uh even conversations like this
[42:48] but you know i i i'll be honest with you
[42:52] when this is several years ago i've
[42:54] changed quite a bit since then but i i
[42:58] was a great
[42:59] i liked the football coach called tom
[43:02] landry
[43:04] and everybody liked him because he
[43:05] looked like brother branham
[43:07] and he wore a hat like brother branham
[43:10] so
[43:10] my carnal mind i liked him
[43:13] and then they fired him and got this
[43:15] other guy in
[43:18] well i hated that other guy simply
[43:20] because i love the one guy
[43:24] but one day that guy made a statement i
[43:27] believe his name was it jimmy jones or
[43:29] jimmy johnson or something like that
[43:31] he made a statement he said i've sold my
[43:34] soul for football
[43:36] i thought that's my kind of man
[43:41] i like people that sell out
[43:44] you know what i mean if he loved
[43:46] football that much that he's willing to
[43:48] give his soul for it then i say
[43:50] hallelujah be the best football coach
[43:53] you can be
[43:54] win the super bowl or be all out eat
[43:58] live
[43:59] drink
[44:01] football
[44:07] i remember uh brother billy paul told me
[44:09] i believe that his father
[44:11] told him this he can correct me if he
[44:13] want but it was something on these that
[44:16] this line i'm paraphrasing something
[44:18] like billy if you're going to be a bum
[44:20] you don't work a day in your life
[44:24] you be the best bum
[44:26] you can be
[44:29] and that's even the way the lord wants
[44:31] things
[44:32] he wants you to be sold out
[44:35] you know what i mean and so we know
[44:38] there's been a ton of different
[44:40] doctrines
[44:42] a ton of different men's ideas
[44:45] trying to pull us this way
[44:47] in that way that's no excuse to not have
[44:51] a christ-like nature
[44:53] in attitude
[44:54] [Music]
[44:57] what we've been preaching is what the
[44:59] lord is trying to do to with his bride
[45:02] is get her to possess the same divine
[45:05] attributes that he possessed
[45:08] the fruits of the spirit
[45:11] the statue of a perfect man
[45:15] and yes there's been many false
[45:17] interpretations
[45:19] and doctrines that's true
[45:21] but remember
[45:23] and wherever the best tree is
[45:26] that's where the most scarecrows
[45:29] are
[45:30] egg men and and so
[45:32] uh there there are many bogus dollars
[45:37] but remember every bogus only testifies
[45:40] that there's a reel somewhere
[45:43] i started collecting silver dollars and
[45:47] and as i was collecting i began to talk
[45:49] to other collectors
[45:51] and one today a man said something to me
[45:54] that shook me in my boots
[45:57] he said boy you got to watch out there's
[45:59] a lot of bogus ones out there
[46:04] i thought what
[46:08] i mean someone would really do something
[46:10] like that
[46:13] you know oh yeah he said they take the
[46:15] certification cases and they open up and
[46:18] they put a lower grade dollar in there
[46:21] and they glue them back together and you
[46:23] can't tell the difference and they
[46:25] they sell them you know and all this
[46:27] stuff and i'm thinking my goodness
[46:29] you've got to have some
[46:31] you know
[46:32] verified
[46:34] you know and remember
[46:37] we've always been taught this
[46:40] we verify everything by the what
[46:43] the word of god
[46:46] this is how we verify things we verify
[46:49] them
[46:50] by
[46:51] the scriptures
[46:53] every person i have fellowship with we
[46:56] fellowship
[46:57] in the scriptures
[46:59] they open their bible and they read the
[47:01] scriptures and have you ever sat down
[47:04] with a really really good seventh-day
[47:06] adventist
[47:08] and had him run the sabbath
[47:12] through the scriptures
[47:16] well when you're done you're going to
[47:18] have church on saturday
[47:24] you won't be eating bacon
[47:29] that'd be hard
[47:31] but
[47:32] that is and there's there's something
[47:34] that that's
[47:36] that's transpiring and so
[47:39] you've got to respect somebody
[47:43] who stands what they believe now i'm
[47:46] going to
[47:48] share with you what the lord put on my
[47:51] heart and actually the holy spirit
[47:56] led of the lord
[48:00] and and to share with you
[48:03] and
[48:04] and and i want to share
[48:07] this
[48:08] with you
[48:10] this
[48:11] morning
[48:12] and
[48:14] he says now
[48:16] that the church
[48:18] this is paragraph 120 that his very
[48:22] whole purpose
[48:24] was the church
[48:26] and how do we get in
[48:28] to this church
[48:30] by one spirit
[48:32] we are all baptized into one body
[48:36] the church the body of christ it cannot
[48:40] fail
[48:42] now he says now here is
[48:46] what
[48:47] happens
[48:49] and i i want you to see
[48:52] what
[48:54] he's
[48:55] saying
[48:58] he says now here is what happens
[49:02] i
[49:03] now watch this
[49:05] just a little figurative picture here
[49:09] and brother bannon again shows his
[49:11] drawing of three
[49:13] rings
[49:14] so i don't know if you can draw three
[49:17] rings or i i drew three rings and
[49:21] he says now on the outside man
[49:25] is
[49:26] flesh
[49:27] i'm going to use brother billy here come
[49:29] here my brother i love you
[49:31] okay
[49:34] now
[49:35] billy's here
[49:37] and i'm here
[49:39] now
[49:40] brother branham did this with the piano
[49:42] but we just want to talk about it
[49:46] the only way
[49:47] that billy can make contact
[49:50] his flesh
[49:52] with me is through one of his senses
[49:56] is that right so he's got five senses
[50:00] so
[50:01] he might not be able to see me
[50:04] now is that right
[50:07] but he can hear me
[50:09] i hope he can't smell me
[50:15] but now
[50:17] he feels me
[50:20] right so now i make contact through the
[50:23] senses of feeling
[50:25] i'm making contact with him
[50:28] through the census of hearing
[50:31] now i'm making contact with him through
[50:33] the sight
[50:36] feeling
[50:39] sound
[50:42] and maybe he can smell my cologne
[50:45] which would be smelling and i'm not
[50:46] gonna let him taste me
[50:51] but right now maybe we have four of the
[50:53] five census going on
[50:56] okay so that's the outside mind thank
[50:59] you i love you
[51:01] that that's the
[51:03] outside man and that's how
[51:07] that that outside man is contacted he's
[51:10] not contacted
[51:12] by any
[51:14] other
[51:15] means and then inside of that
[51:18] we have the uh the spirit
[51:22] man
[51:24] right that was the inside ring
[51:28] and he said he says here he says now the
[51:31] inside of that is a spirit
[51:35] which you become when you're born in the
[51:39] earth
[51:40] and the breath of life is breathed in to
[51:44] him
[51:45] that spirit is of the worldly nature
[51:49] because it's not given
[51:52] from god
[51:54] so we know that those
[51:58] are
[51:58] like conscious love
[52:01] reasoning
[52:03] memory
[52:04] they're like spiritual
[52:07] faculties
[52:09] that you contact things by you contact
[52:12] the spirit have any of you ever
[52:15] remembered something that you've done
[52:19] that was quite embarrassing
[52:23] and then you got that whole embarrassing
[52:25] feel all over you again
[52:28] look that's that spiritual man
[52:31] that
[52:32] is on could be in in
[52:35] side of you
[52:38] and and so
[52:40] that person inside of there
[52:43] is a a sinner
[52:45] to begin with
[52:47] so
[52:48] another way that you can describe this
[52:51] inner man
[52:52] is spirit is nature
[52:55] it's his nature it's his spirit
[52:58] it's not carnal fleshes it's a life
[53:02] that's in you
[53:04] is your spirit
[53:06] that's your spirit and it's got ways
[53:09] that you contact that you were taught
[53:12] things is that right as you grew up you
[53:15] have certain likes and dislikes because
[53:17] of where you were brought up and who
[53:20] taught you and who influenced you
[53:23] you know and
[53:25] my dad shared his his political ideas
[53:29] with man his philosophy of life in those
[53:32] things and of course when i left his
[53:35] kingdom
[53:36] and entered into another kingdom i put
[53:39] on another
[53:40] mind amen
[53:42] but this spirit man is subject
[53:45] to all
[53:46] those things he says so that he says is
[53:49] a spirit man
[53:52] and that spirit is of the world
[53:54] he he says but it it was
[53:58] given or permitted by god
[54:02] now you got that for every child that's
[54:05] born in the world is born in sin
[54:08] shaped in iniquity and come into the
[54:11] world speaking lies that's right so that
[54:14] person on the inside there is a sinner
[54:17] to begin with
[54:19] and it's got five inlets
[54:23] and he says i
[54:25] i
[54:26] i can call them right off now i can't
[54:29] call them right off now first i know
[54:31] is thought conscience love choice
[54:36] no uh conscience love reason there's
[54:39] five outlets the spirit
[54:41] you can think with your you can't think
[54:44] with your body you think with your
[54:46] spirit
[54:50] that you saw you see the difference
[54:52] right there there's another part of you
[54:54] that's not just flesh
[54:58] you
[54:58] you've got a conscience
[55:01] you can't have conscience in your body
[55:04] it has no mental
[55:06] faculties at all
[55:08] your body doesn't so you have to think
[55:11] with your spirit
[55:13] you have to reason
[55:15] you can't reason with your physical
[55:17] being because reasoning doesn't see
[55:20] taste
[55:21] feel smell or hear
[55:23] reason is what you can make in your mind
[55:28] if you're asleep
[55:30] or you're out
[55:31] your body is laying their dead but your
[55:35] spirit can still reason there is five
[55:38] senses that controls the inside man
[55:42] so you have that
[55:44] and and
[55:47] you know many people they want to ask
[55:49] for a
[55:51] uh
[55:52] an answer to questions well this is a
[55:55] wonderful answer
[55:57] now in the last man paragraph 25
[56:01] now to the last man which is the soul
[56:04] there is the only one sense
[56:08] that controls that
[56:10] and that's free moral agency
[56:15] moral agency free will to choose or to
[56:18] reject
[56:20] now let me tell you what happens many
[56:23] times
[56:24] to people who grow up in the message
[56:29] they
[56:30] all their life
[56:32] they've been raised from day one
[56:34] they can give you a litany of their
[56:37] family lineage in the met message
[56:40] who who their family members were where
[56:42] they were what positions they held
[56:45] and
[56:46] they can give all those
[56:49] all those
[56:52] all those great histories
[56:55] of all those
[56:56] things and what happens is is that
[57:01] they're raised up a certain way
[57:04] and therefore
[57:05] their
[57:07] outward man
[57:09] is molded and shaped
[57:12] by
[57:14] the things they like the taste
[57:17] the things they like to smell
[57:20] the things they like to bend i
[57:23] i when i went over to korea
[57:27] and we went into some
[57:29] places there
[57:31] in the marketplaces and everything and
[57:34] the person we were with
[57:36] they walked into this place
[57:39] that smells wonderful
[57:42] and i was reeling
[57:46] are we smelling the same
[57:52] thing you know
[57:54] it's just like
[57:56] really
[57:57] because he was he associated
[58:00] that smell
[58:02] with other senses
[58:04] that he has so that person that's born
[58:07] up into something
[58:09] they have these senses and so all their
[58:12] life they're taught this is where we go
[58:14] this is this is what brother such and
[58:15] such did this was what brothers left and
[58:17] such did this is what this and then
[58:20] they're inside man
[58:24] that is contacted
[58:28] it's raised up
[58:31] you know i mean i raise my kids not to
[58:33] wear this not to do that to do this to
[58:36] do that
[58:37] all the religious
[58:39] part of it
[58:41] okay but there's that but they're still
[58:44] and that all those five senses
[58:48] and all that inner spirit
[58:50] that spirit man is influenced
[58:56] in fact it gets its whole conception of
[58:58] god
[59:00] and the scriptures
[59:02] through that influence
[59:05] they're taught
[59:09] people that are raised catholics are
[59:10] taught to be catholics
[59:14] they're taught to go to mass they're
[59:16] taught to take communion they're taught
[59:18] to go to confession they're taught their
[59:20] religion
[59:23] and they have a religious experience
[59:27] in that spirit man
[59:30] that's been taught to them
[59:33] and they're just been taught that and
[59:34] taught that and they're raised up in
[59:36] that and then you'll see that's the
[59:38] complaint
[59:41] all my life
[59:44] i was raised up this way
[59:48] all my life i never
[59:51] questioned
[59:53] i never thought it out
[59:56] well that person has something lacking
[59:59] in their life
[1:00:01] okay they find out
[1:00:05] that they've never made contact
[1:00:08] with that inside man
[1:00:12] for
[1:00:12] years their life has been ruled by the
[1:00:16] conversations they've heard
[1:00:18] by the people they've hung out with
[1:00:21] by the religious circles it was in it
[1:00:24] molded their ministries
[1:00:26] it molded their thinking
[1:00:28] it molded their defense
[1:00:32] god doesn't need
[1:00:34] an attorney
[1:00:39] he doesn't need anybody to defend him
[1:00:45] he is lord supreme
[1:00:48] jesus christ is lord supreme
[1:00:52] his word is truth and truth alone let
[1:00:56] every word of god be true and every word
[1:01:00] of man alive
[1:01:03] end of story
[1:01:05] but
[1:01:07] if you've never in your life
[1:01:12] been driven
[1:01:13] to
[1:01:14] the place of choice or rejection
[1:01:18] then in your being you don't feel
[1:01:21] complete
[1:01:22] so if you find somebody in their life
[1:01:25] they feel incomplete
[1:01:31] and they want to know what
[1:01:33] brought me
[1:01:36] here now i know that
[1:01:40] by experience
[1:01:44] amen i i i i've dealt with years
[1:01:49] the way i am
[1:01:51] and why i'm that way
[1:01:54] i finally went back and spent three
[1:01:56] years working for my father
[1:02:00] flying out to california to work with my
[1:02:03] father to watch the way he did things to
[1:02:06] to look at the way he think to look the
[1:02:09] way he reacted look at the way he
[1:02:11] responded
[1:02:13] and in doing that i began to find out
[1:02:17] why i was the way that i was
[1:02:25] i was driven
[1:02:27] to that inner man
[1:02:30] that inner being to where i had to make
[1:02:33] a choice
[1:02:35] now don't condemn a man that god
[1:02:39] is driving
[1:02:41] to get to that inner
[1:02:44] circle
[1:02:47] that center being
[1:02:51] that's the person that you've got to
[1:02:53] make contact with
[1:02:55] and way too many people live in this
[1:02:58] message
[1:02:59] in the outer man keeping all the rules
[1:03:02] in the inner man but they've never made
[1:03:06] contact
[1:03:08] with the part within them
[1:03:10] that chooses or rejects
[1:03:13] that opportunity never afforded them
[1:03:17] that they were swept into the ministry
[1:03:20] swept into the word swept into a
[1:03:23] position swept into being a spokesman
[1:03:26] swept into being an ambassador and it
[1:03:29] all came from those two outer realms but
[1:03:32] it never came from way down on the
[1:03:35] inside
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:41] and i'm not condemning i'm defending
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:55] you you've got to make
[1:03:58] the choice
[1:04:01] if you're not presented with that
[1:04:03] opportunity
[1:04:05] you are an incomplete person
[1:04:11] and too many people live
[1:04:14] in complete lives
[1:04:17] and they're never able to stabilize
[1:04:20] because they haven't been able to anchor
[1:04:22] that inside
[1:04:24] of the inside circle
[1:04:27] if i don't know if you can see that
[1:04:30] but this dot
[1:04:33] this outward man this inward man but now
[1:04:37] it comes someday that you're going to
[1:04:39] have to meet that
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:43] that's right
[1:04:45] now let's listen about that spirit
[1:04:50] now the reason that people today
[1:04:53] and don't forget this now
[1:04:57] you will see
[1:04:58] what the initial evidence of the holy
[1:05:01] ghost is
[1:05:07] now people can live in this spirit
[1:05:12] this realm
[1:05:13] the spirit you were born with
[1:05:16] you can live in that spirit
[1:05:21] they can dance in the spirit
[1:05:24] they can shout in the spirit
[1:05:27] they can go to church in the spirit
[1:05:30] they can absolutely have a real
[1:05:34] spirit of god
[1:05:36] anointing on that spirit
[1:05:40] a real
[1:05:41] genuine spirit of god anointing
[1:05:46] on that spirit
[1:05:48] they can heal with that anointing
[1:05:54] god doing the healing through them in
[1:05:57] that spirit
[1:06:00] but still be lost
[1:06:03] and just as devil possessed as they can
[1:06:06] be with that spirit
[1:06:10] and you want a scripture right many will
[1:06:12] come to him in that that day
[1:06:14] and say lord lord didn't we do that
[1:06:17] because watch
[1:06:20] that's the reason
[1:06:22] you couldn't tell
[1:06:26] that woman that she was wearing shorts
[1:06:29] was wrong
[1:06:30] you couldn't tell her bobbing her hair
[1:06:32] was wrong
[1:06:34] well what's your hair got to do with it
[1:06:38] you know he says well it did the samson
[1:06:43] whatever
[1:06:44] whoever shall add one word to this or
[1:06:46] take one word away
[1:06:48] you've got to have an ultimate
[1:06:51] somewhere
[1:06:53] okay now that ultimate isn't in your
[1:06:57] five senses
[1:07:01] right
[1:07:02] you can't rely on your five senses to
[1:07:04] know whether something's good or bad for
[1:07:07] you
[1:07:10] amen you know
[1:07:12] you know it's like like you like the
[1:07:15] feel of a
[1:07:17] uh
[1:07:18] maybe a viper
[1:07:21] most poisonous stink oh that's smooth
[1:07:24] that feels good i can trust that it
[1:07:27] feels good you better not trust your
[1:07:29] feeling
[1:07:30] he might look good oh that's a pretty
[1:07:32] snake
[1:07:33] you know what i mean but it there's
[1:07:35] death in the pod
[1:07:37] it's death you can't rely on your five
[1:07:40] senses
[1:07:41] you can't rely on how can you rely on a
[1:07:44] spirit
[1:07:47] that can get the absolute anointing of
[1:07:49] god
[1:07:50] do signs and wonders
[1:07:52] and then get to the throne and have him
[1:07:55] depart from me you're a doer of iniquity
[1:07:58] i never knew you
[1:08:04] you you you can't do it
[1:08:08] but there's something that's got to be
[1:08:10] the ultimate
[1:08:14] there's something that comes on the
[1:08:16] inside
[1:08:18] man something that
[1:08:20] there yes sir
[1:08:22] that makes the absolute choice
[1:08:27] now just stay with me
[1:08:29] a moment
[1:08:31] he says
[1:08:37] so everybody's got to have an ultimate
[1:08:40] is that right
[1:08:42] now he said let's read 133 if you're a
[1:08:45] catholic
[1:08:46] and i tell you
[1:08:48] it's not in the bible to eat meat on
[1:08:50] friday
[1:08:52] and all these things like this
[1:08:55] the holy eucharist isn't a wafer because
[1:08:57] it's a spirit
[1:08:59] and so forth
[1:09:02] did you hear that
[1:09:03] it's not a wafer
[1:09:05] it's a spirit that you commune with that
[1:09:09] you take in communion
[1:09:11] and so forth
[1:09:12] and you go to your priest and your
[1:09:14] priest says here's what wrote in our doc
[1:09:17] in our
[1:09:18] document if the church is your ultimate
[1:09:22] you don't have a hoot what anybody else
[1:09:25] says it's your ultimate
[1:09:28] now let me say this
[1:09:31] oh i hope this sinks in to me
[1:09:35] the whole thing is wrong
[1:09:38] god's word is the ultimate
[1:09:41] whatever that word says that's the
[1:09:43] ultimate now you've got to go back in
[1:09:46] the beginning was the word
[1:09:50] this bible
[1:09:54] though i've seen people extremely
[1:09:56] skilled in this bible
[1:09:59] to my amazement
[1:10:01] and to my shame
[1:10:05] how they can take the scriptures
[1:10:08] don't sit down with somebody
[1:10:11] that a good united pentecostal brethren
[1:10:15] who believe speaking in tongues is the
[1:10:17] evidence of the holy spirit
[1:10:20] and think you're just going to get past
[1:10:23] him with throwing out a few
[1:10:26] statements that brother branham made
[1:10:31] he's not moved by brother branham
[1:10:34] it might be okay for you to pat
[1:10:36] yourselves on the back
[1:10:40] and say this is believed but you've got
[1:10:43] to know why it's not the evidence of the
[1:10:45] holy spirit
[1:10:47] you can't run and put some sort of
[1:10:48] religious covering over you called the
[1:10:51] message
[1:10:52] and just because you're in the spirit
[1:10:55] world
[1:10:56] and in the flesh world with a bunch of
[1:10:59] message believers
[1:11:03] now you have to understand to me the
[1:11:05] message is jesus christ
[1:11:09] the person of jesus christ the same
[1:11:11] yesterday today and forever
[1:11:14] i just happen to believe that william
[1:11:17] branham preached
[1:11:19] jesus christ
[1:11:20] the same yesterday and day and forever
[1:11:23] he wasn't preaching his interpretation
[1:11:25] of the bible
[1:11:26] he was preaching
[1:11:29] the word of god
[1:11:32] amen
[1:11:35] but so
[1:11:36] he
[1:11:39] so we we see that
[1:11:42] we want to know that
[1:11:43] he says
[1:11:45] the whole thing is wrong god's word is
[1:11:47] the ultimate
[1:11:49] whatever that word says that's what's
[1:11:51] right
[1:11:55] now
[1:11:56] the only way
[1:11:59] up here
[1:12:00] in this sphere
[1:12:03] the only way up here in this inside
[1:12:06] person here
[1:12:09] the only way in this spear that you
[1:12:11] could ever
[1:12:13] be in
[1:12:15] this little inside man
[1:12:18] you have to be for ordained
[1:12:22] because you was with god and you're a
[1:12:26] part of god
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:31] so
[1:12:32] this inside man here
[1:12:35] that you're inside
[1:12:37] that inside part
[1:12:40] that makes the choice
[1:12:45] look there's something
[1:12:48] that
[1:12:50] is in you
[1:12:53] put in there
[1:12:55] because you were with god in the
[1:12:56] beginning
[1:12:59] right he thought you
[1:13:01] if we go back and read in colossians
[1:13:03] which i probably should have done all
[1:13:05] things that were made all things that
[1:13:07] were created by him all things that
[1:13:09] consist if it weren't so that inside man
[1:13:13] that's in there
[1:13:14] the man that is going to come to the
[1:13:18] place to make the choice
[1:13:22] now
[1:13:23] the only way
[1:13:25] that man has to be foreign
[1:13:29] because you is with god you're a part of
[1:13:31] god
[1:13:32] i was in my father
[1:13:35] i was in my grandfather my great father
[1:13:39] by seed i was in that
[1:13:42] and i was in christ
[1:13:46] you were in christ
[1:13:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:51] he came to redeem his own
[1:13:54] his own that was in him
[1:13:57] hallelujah his children that was in him
[1:14:01] now so there's got to be something in
[1:14:04] there
[1:14:06] that's going to make the choice
[1:14:12] okay
[1:14:13] now
[1:14:14] listen let us sink in
[1:14:17] let it sink in
[1:14:21] i was in christ you were in christ
[1:14:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:25] he came to redeem his own that was in
[1:14:28] him
[1:14:31] now don't forget that
[1:14:35] hallelujah his children that was in him
[1:14:38] he never came to save the devil's
[1:14:41] children
[1:14:45] they never
[1:14:47] will
[1:14:48] know it
[1:14:51] they won't know it
[1:14:53] they're blind miserable poor wretched
[1:14:55] naked
[1:14:56] right
[1:14:57] and
[1:14:58] don't know it
[1:15:00] why
[1:15:01] don't they know it that's the question
[1:15:06] and
[1:15:07] and they are so shrewd
[1:15:10] in the ways of their intellect learning
[1:15:13] that you can't compare with them at all
[1:15:16] you can't out-talk them
[1:15:19] but by faith
[1:15:21] you see it
[1:15:26] now science don't need any faith
[1:15:29] science proves what they're talking
[1:15:32] about they don't need any faith
[1:15:35] now
[1:15:37] that's why someone will say
[1:15:40] let me take my bible
[1:15:44] let me sit down and reason
[1:15:46] with you
[1:15:49] let's go back over all the history
[1:15:55] all the events
[1:15:57] all what you call vindication
[1:16:01] believe me
[1:16:04] this message
[1:16:06] didn't need one
[1:16:08] miracle
[1:16:13] to be vindicated to me
[1:16:15] [Applause]
[1:16:17] it didn't need newspaper articles
[1:16:20] it didn't it the healing the divine
[1:16:24] healing and all those things it doesn't
[1:16:25] need it
[1:16:33] now science don't need any faith
[1:16:37] science proves what they're talking
[1:16:39] about
[1:16:40] they don't need any faith
[1:16:44] they don't need it
[1:16:46] what is faith revelation
[1:16:50] so let me just read another statement
[1:16:52] and i'll
[1:16:53] close
[1:16:54] let's just go down we can read
[1:16:57] um
[1:17:02] paragraph 144 the bible said so i can't
[1:17:06] explain how it happens
[1:17:09] but it happens
[1:17:11] god said so
[1:17:13] i tell you you have
[1:17:15] you can't tell you nothing about it
[1:17:18] faith doesn't explain it
[1:17:20] did you know that faith just believes it
[1:17:25] now so you understand there now here's
[1:17:27] something
[1:17:29] that is
[1:17:31] working
[1:17:33] in some buddy
[1:17:36] that causes them to believe
[1:17:39] so they're finally brought to that
[1:17:41] choice so you can live in the fleshly
[1:17:44] realm
[1:17:45] which there's people out there that live
[1:17:47] totally in the flesh
[1:17:48] there's people that live in the spirit
[1:17:50] realm
[1:17:51] but they've never
[1:17:53] been brought
[1:17:56] to that inner man
[1:17:59] now when someone tells you
[1:18:01] that paul went to the mountain come let
[1:18:04] us reason together and he went over here
[1:18:06] and left sign there's reason and let's
[1:18:09] reason and let's reason and let's reason
[1:18:12] paul never went there to change their
[1:18:14] mind
[1:18:18] he went there
[1:18:21] to
[1:18:22] see if the seed
[1:18:24] was in there
[1:18:31] he was using that reasoning
[1:18:34] for them to go through their experiences
[1:18:37] and all of a sudden realize wait a
[1:18:40] minute there's another man in here
[1:18:43] there's another person in here
[1:18:46] that's in air
[1:18:48] scriptural air
[1:18:51] to say that paul went to have an
[1:18:53] intellectual change of mind when paul
[1:18:57] believed you must be born again and
[1:19:00] filled with the holy ghost
[1:19:07] we wouldn't go in there to try to
[1:19:10] get them to come to some mental
[1:19:12] conclusion
[1:19:16] no
[1:19:18] he was preaching to see if there was
[1:19:20] something in there
[1:19:24] a conviction in there
[1:19:29] i was hippie as can be
[1:19:32] there's no physical evidence that you
[1:19:35] can see that i used to have a lot of
[1:19:37] hair
[1:19:43] most of my early
[1:19:45] years 18
[1:19:47] or so 19
[1:19:49] almost every day i was in under the
[1:19:51] influence of some form of narcotic
[1:19:56] but when a man told me
[1:19:59] that it wasn't right for a man to have
[1:20:02] long hair
[1:20:06] i told him jesus had long hair
[1:20:10] the disciples had long hair
[1:20:12] i gave him everything he wanted
[1:20:16] every excuse and everything but
[1:20:18] something in my heart stung
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:27] i tried to explain it away re reason
[1:20:30] reason reason it away what did they want
[1:20:34] to do they want come reason with me come
[1:20:36] sit down let's talk about it let's go
[1:20:38] through the scriptures everything that's
[1:20:41] not what i'm built on
[1:20:46] you can believe every bit
[1:20:50] of every miracle
[1:20:53] that's been performed through all the
[1:20:55] church ages
[1:20:57] every vindication it won't do you a bit
[1:21:00] of good
[1:21:01] to believe that cloud
[1:21:06] if there isn't something in there
[1:21:09] ordained to choose it
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:17] so when a man comes to that point
[1:21:21] that choice on the inside
[1:21:25] and there's not something ordained
[1:21:28] in there
[1:21:31] to choose it
[1:21:33] he's going to have to go back out
[1:21:36] to the five senses and to the spirit
[1:21:39] realm
[1:21:42] i don't believe this message for any
[1:21:44] other reason
[1:21:46] except that god
[1:21:48] put something in me to receive it
[1:21:53] this message is not to the world
[1:21:56] it's not to the baptist it's not to the
[1:21:59] methodist it's not to the presbyterian
[1:22:02] it's not to anybody that whom it was for
[1:22:06] ordained and sent to
[1:22:14] and the question i can't answer
[1:22:19] is why is that seed there
[1:22:25] [Applause]
[1:22:26] you'll never be able to answer it
[1:22:29] you can take me you can't not one
[1:22:31] scripture
[1:22:32] you're gonna read to me that i don't
[1:22:34] believe
[1:22:39] i hear a man in 99 what he's talking
[1:22:42] about complaining about the attitude in
[1:22:44] the message complaining about the lack
[1:22:46] of faith in the message i agree with
[1:22:48] every single one of it i've preached the
[1:22:51] same thing
[1:22:54] i agree with the complaint
[1:23:01] i agree with the discouragement yes sir
[1:23:04] yes sir
[1:23:05] i agree with the lack
[1:23:08] of people
[1:23:10] coming to the place
[1:23:12] and finding that inward man
[1:23:15] but when you get to that inward man
[1:23:18] if that seed of god's not in there
[1:23:21] you will not have anything in you to
[1:23:24] make the choice
[1:23:31] you can spend
[1:23:32] years in those other two realms
[1:23:36] but one day
[1:23:41] you're going to come
[1:23:44] to the hour of your decision
[1:23:47] and your choice
[1:23:54] and
[1:23:56] reasoning
[1:24:01] okay
[1:24:02] i see everything you're saying
[1:24:06] there's no proof
[1:24:08] about how many people died here there's
[1:24:11] no proof whether this person was healed
[1:24:13] because this this evidence falls apart
[1:24:15] this evidence falls apart all that
[1:24:17] evidence but there's one thing
[1:24:20] i can look you straight in the eye and
[1:24:22] say friend what about this evidence
[1:24:25] that's on the inside oh yeah go ahead
[1:24:28] and sit down brother just just sit down
[1:24:30] it's okay
[1:24:32] it's just the gospel it's the same
[1:24:34] gospel that's been preached for 2 000
[1:24:37] years
[1:24:41] what are you going to do about that
[1:24:46] okay
[1:24:48] what are you going to do
[1:24:50] about this thing that's in here
[1:24:54] when i hear this
[1:24:56] it says amen
[1:24:58] that's the truth
[1:25:00] how do i get free from that
[1:25:07] how are you going to explain that away
[1:25:16] i believe that voice before i ever knew
[1:25:18] there was a miracle done
[1:25:23] if you ever before i ever knew there was
[1:25:25] such a thing of malachi 4 5. you can
[1:25:29] not
[1:25:30] reason that out of me
[1:25:40] i've got a
[1:25:42] i don't write them down
[1:25:44] i've led many a people to the lord
[1:25:49] i prayed for many sick
[1:25:51] and had them healed
[1:25:54] i've seen signs and wonders
[1:25:58] it's not what i'm made out of
[1:26:02] i came in contact one day
[1:26:05] with the inner man
[1:26:08] and when some people finally got to the
[1:26:11] inner man they found out there wasn't a
[1:26:15] seed there
[1:26:22] so when the seed's not there
[1:26:25] then you've got to go back out to the
[1:26:28] spirit man
[1:26:34] and what's the shuck pull away from
[1:26:38] it pulls away from the sea
[1:26:41] not from the message
[1:26:43] this message is just another man-made
[1:26:47] religion
[1:26:53] not the word
[1:26:56] not the ultimate word that was in my
[1:26:58] god's thought from the beginning
[1:27:01] but this organizational conventions and
[1:27:04] churches and
[1:27:06] ministerial groups and all that that's
[1:27:08] just a man's carnal put together what
[1:27:11] god's church is what that word was was
[1:27:14] the seed that he planted in that inner
[1:27:17] man
[1:27:18] [Applause]
[1:27:21] that's what he came to redeem
[1:27:25] not somebody who wants to present a
[1:27:27] better attitude
[1:27:32] we need a better attitude
[1:27:34] we need a better nature we need to more
[1:27:37] spirit we need more scriptures well let
[1:27:40] me tell you it's to our shame
[1:27:44] that we're not well versed in this book
[1:27:48] i deem that complaint
[1:27:51] accepted
[1:27:57] and well deserved
[1:28:02] i deem the complaint that people aren't
[1:28:05] led by the spirit of god
[1:28:08] and they're led by the letter
[1:28:12] as well deserved
[1:28:16] and received
[1:28:19] but i believe i have record
[1:28:23] people that know me that even go to
[1:28:25] church in certain places that i've
[1:28:27] always believed that
[1:28:29] it's a personal relationship
[1:28:33] with jesus christ
[1:28:36] but you cannot make
[1:28:39] a god
[1:28:40] choice without god
[1:28:44] being in you
[1:28:46] to make that choice
[1:28:56] paragraph 45 jesus said to nicodemus
[1:29:00] the sanhedrin economic counsel of his
[1:29:03] day
[1:29:04] came to him by night
[1:29:06] and said master we know you're a teacher
[1:29:10] come from god
[1:29:12] because no man can do the things that
[1:29:14] you do unless god be with him
[1:29:19] now that goes for anybody
[1:29:24] he said verily i say to you except the
[1:29:26] man be born again he can't even see the
[1:29:30] kingdom of god
[1:29:32] he said
[1:29:33] me and old man enter into my mother's
[1:29:35] womb
[1:29:36] and be born
[1:29:38] he said now
[1:29:39] how am i going to tell you
[1:29:42] heavenly things
[1:29:44] when you won't even believe earthly
[1:29:45] things
[1:29:47] he said one day except you eat the flesh
[1:29:51] of the son of man and drink his blood
[1:29:53] you have no life in you
[1:29:55] did he explain it
[1:29:59] he didn't have to explain it
[1:30:02] you understand because peter
[1:30:06] who didn't know what in the world
[1:30:10] he was talking about
[1:30:12] everybody else went and reasoned it out
[1:30:17] and they said wait a
[1:30:18] minute there's no vindication here
[1:30:26] there's no proof of that
[1:30:28] no science for that no newspaper
[1:30:31] articles that no vindication for that
[1:30:36] and jesus says will you also leave
[1:30:40] he says where can we go
[1:30:45] that was in peter's mind
[1:30:49] that wasn't peter's reasoning
[1:30:52] there was plenty of youtube tapes
[1:30:56] in israel
[1:30:58] pointing out lots of different ways that
[1:31:00] was something that was in peter
[1:31:04] on the inside man
[1:31:06] not the old nature
[1:31:09] that snake nature
[1:31:13] that always chooses
[1:31:15] the other two realms
[1:31:18] this was something that was in him
[1:31:21] that was predestinated there
[1:31:24] from the foundation of the world that
[1:31:27] now took over the control tower
[1:31:33] and its signal
[1:31:35] was limited to one thing only
[1:31:40] divine
[1:31:42] revelation
[1:31:46] he said where am i going to go
[1:31:50] i've listened to everybody around you
[1:31:52] alone have got the words of eternal life
[1:31:54] let me tell you people aren't preaching
[1:31:56] a new gospel
[1:31:58] they're just trying to preach a new
[1:32:00] attitude
[1:32:04] a new approach to the world
[1:32:08] a more kindly
[1:32:10] experience a more loving christ-like
[1:32:14] nature
[1:32:19] praise god
[1:32:20] i believe in that
[1:32:23] this isn't that
[1:32:30] this isn't
[1:32:32] christianity
[1:32:35] this is a direct
[1:32:39] divine
[1:32:42] signal
[1:32:44] from heaven
[1:32:47] aimed at
[1:32:50] a reception
[1:32:53] that's in the heart of us elected
[1:32:57] predestinated
[1:32:58] people
[1:33:04] we should have everything every
[1:33:06] christian has
[1:33:09] we see they have the love the nature the
[1:33:11] works
[1:33:12] the movement of the holy spirit
[1:33:15] signs and wonders following us
[1:33:19] we should have all that
[1:33:21] from the scriptures
[1:33:28] we should have all that from the
[1:33:30] anointing of the holy spirit
[1:33:34] but the connection between this
[1:33:38] does not connect with the spirit
[1:33:42] man
[1:33:43] it only connects with what's on the
[1:33:46] inside of the inside of that do not
[1:33:51] de-christianize people
[1:33:53] who don't
[1:33:54] see what you see
[1:34:03] they don't have it inside of them to
[1:34:07] believe with
[1:34:10] and when they looked it wasn't there
[1:34:14] and they were honest
[1:34:18] god
[1:34:21] i can walk with an honest man i can go
[1:34:23] preach the gospel with an honest man i
[1:34:26] can go preach with an honest man a man
[1:34:28] that will say to me brother david i love
[1:34:30] the lord i love the scriptures i'm
[1:34:32] filled with the holy ghost i don't see
[1:34:34] it
[1:34:39] okay brother
[1:34:41] don't condemn me because i see
[1:34:44] it because i can't help it
[1:34:49] i already tried to shake it
[1:34:54] i can't help it
[1:34:57] i'm not pretending with you
[1:35:00] i love you
[1:35:02] i understand
[1:35:04] when it came down to it
[1:35:06] there wasn't that thing in there
[1:35:10] that by divine revelation said amen
[1:35:15] because you couldn't explain it or you
[1:35:18] couldn't understand it or you couldn't
[1:35:20] reason it
[1:35:23] that does not make a person not a
[1:35:25] christian
[1:35:27] that does not keep a person out of the
[1:35:29] kingdom of heaven
[1:35:34] quit treating everybody that don't
[1:35:36] believe what you believe like a devil
[1:35:41] you're having a spiritual jihad
[1:35:45] you've got the gift of casting on of
[1:35:47] devils instead of casting off of devils
[1:35:54] i don't need the comfort
[1:35:56] of somebody agreeing with me
[1:36:01] i have a comfort
[1:36:03] that was put on the inside man
[1:36:05] that was put in there but found the
[1:36:07] foundation of the world something a seed
[1:36:10] of god that came from god because i was
[1:36:13] a part of him in the beginning that's
[1:36:15] what says amen
[1:36:17] not my mind not my senses not everything
[1:36:20] else
[1:36:31] what do you do
[1:36:34] everybody wants to send me videos and
[1:36:36] what's my opinion i have one opinion
[1:36:40] if you have eternal life
[1:36:42] you always had eternal life
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:48] if you were in his thinking in the
[1:36:49] beginning you'll be there if your name
[1:36:52] was written in the lamb's book of life
[1:36:54] you'll be there but don't put me outside
[1:36:58] because i don't agree with you i'm just
[1:37:00] going to draw a bigger circle around you
[1:37:02] brother and put you on the inside i
[1:37:05] totally understand you don't have
[1:37:08] anything in you to believe with
[1:37:11] that's okay with me
[1:37:14] and if you want to go gather up
[1:37:16] everybody else who doesn't have anything
[1:37:20] in them to believe with i'll help you
[1:37:31] but i can't get rid of the unbelievers i
[1:37:34] can't get rid of the make-believers
[1:37:38] and go ahead and criticize the
[1:37:40] make-believers
[1:37:42] but there's one thing you can't
[1:37:44] criticize
[1:37:45] is the divine
[1:37:47] province of god
[1:37:50] to put the seed in the heart
[1:37:53] of his choosing
[1:37:57] i do not believe this message by
[1:38:00] historical vindication
[1:38:04] i do not believe this message by quote
[1:38:07] unquote experience
[1:38:10] i don't need experience
[1:38:15] i believe this message
[1:38:17] because god put something
[1:38:20] in me
[1:38:27] i can't reason it away
[1:38:31] you show me all the proof
[1:38:34] that brother branham's a liar
[1:38:36] he's a cheater
[1:38:38] he faked everything
[1:38:40] everything he said is not true
[1:38:43] all that brother i'll accept all that
[1:38:46] but what are you going to do with what's
[1:38:48] in here
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:52] do you want to lay hands on me
[1:38:57] and cast that out of me
[1:39:00] is that a devil
[1:39:06] now call me false
[1:39:08] i'll accept that
[1:39:11] call me deceived
[1:39:13] i'll accept that yes sir
[1:39:15] call me in bondage
[1:39:17] i'll accept that
[1:39:20] call me any name
[1:39:23] criticize me
[1:39:25] according to every outside circle in
[1:39:28] realm and religious explanation
[1:39:32] but you'll never do away with the fact i
[1:39:34] know whom i believed
[1:39:36] that i've met jesus christ personally
[1:39:40] that my name's written on the lamb's
[1:39:42] book of life
[1:39:46] whether the seventh seal is opened or
[1:39:48] not open has nothing to do
[1:39:51] what's in here
[1:39:54] it's great for fellowship
[1:40:00] but what's in here
[1:40:03] is foreign
[1:40:06] you don't have to
[1:40:08] criticize this message
[1:40:10] to have a wonderful experience
[1:40:13] in the scriptures
[1:40:16] you don't have to criticize this message
[1:40:18] to live in the spiritual realm
[1:40:21] to pray for people to help people
[1:40:24] to
[1:40:25] to do good things to preach a
[1:40:28] christ-like attitude to preacher
[1:40:30] christ-like nature that's fine
[1:40:33] i'm for that i support that
[1:40:40] but if this is in here
[1:40:44] you can't help it
[1:40:48] it's like steel to a magnet
[1:40:55] you don't believe it here
[1:41:00] see if it goes down and it doesn't
[1:41:02] anchor here
[1:41:06] if it goes down and it doesn't connect
[1:41:09] with the part that was there from
[1:41:11] beginning
[1:41:12] if it doesn't connect with the other
[1:41:15] side
[1:41:16] of the paper
[1:41:21] right
[1:41:22] the part that was in heaven before
[1:41:26] and the part that's placed inside of you
[1:41:29] if it doesn't connect together
[1:41:32] and you can't make that connection
[1:41:36] then
[1:41:37] this makes no sense
[1:41:43] it makes no
[1:41:44] sense without the seed
[1:41:48] word
[1:41:49] connection
[1:41:55] and
[1:41:56] god sent this part
[1:42:03] it's called the word
[1:42:08] and he put this part
[1:42:10] in you
[1:42:12] before the foundation of the world
[1:42:15] amen
[1:42:16] so you could be raised up
[1:42:20] in this part
[1:42:22] all in your childhood
[1:42:24] all in your religious experience
[1:42:27] but one day you question
[1:42:30] what is this
[1:42:32] where did it come from
[1:42:34] why am i believing it
[1:42:39] so you run it through the flesh man
[1:42:43] and you run it through the spirit man
[1:42:46] and then it finally comes down to see if
[1:42:49] it finds a place to anchor
[1:42:54] and if it's not there
[1:42:58] and god didn't put it there
[1:43:01] it don't draw the picture
[1:43:05] amen
[1:43:07] so all of a sudden you start saying the
[1:43:09] picture don't fit
[1:43:11] it don't fit
[1:43:12] this message doesn't fit it doesn't fit
[1:43:17] no it doesn't fit
[1:43:20] for people who don't have
[1:43:22] the other part of god
[1:43:24] in their heart
[1:43:26] [Applause]
[1:43:28] you don't have it
[1:43:32] he separated eve out of adam
[1:43:39] it don't fit
[1:43:44] and we become worse
[1:43:46] than the accuser
[1:43:50] for condemning somebody
[1:43:52] who's honest enough to say
[1:43:55] i brought it to my heart
[1:43:58] and it didn't fit
[1:44:03] thank you brother
[1:44:05] for being honest enough
[1:44:07] spiritual enough
[1:44:09] to leave our ranks
[1:44:15] but there's many many many many many
[1:44:18] people sitting in mets at churches
[1:44:21] who have never taken it
[1:44:23] to find out if it fits
[1:44:26] they just live in a religious realm a
[1:44:29] church realm and that's what i'm saying
[1:44:31] to you young people you better make sure
[1:44:34] it fits
[1:44:37] because you'll fall apart somewhere down
[1:44:38] the line
[1:44:41] you have got to get to the place where
[1:44:44] you've got to ask yourself
[1:44:46] is this in me
[1:44:48] does
[1:44:50] does
[1:44:52] this come together
[1:44:55] now
[1:44:56] you can't reason that out of me
[1:45:00] do you understand i can't help it
[1:45:05] it fits for me
[1:45:07] now if it's the devil
[1:45:10] then i was preordained
[1:45:13] for ordained to be a devil
[1:45:18] but because it doesn't fit for you
[1:45:21] doesn't make it wrong
[1:45:24] it makes it wrong for
[1:45:27] you
[1:45:30] and i respect that
[1:45:33] i respect that a hundred percent you've
[1:45:35] got a lot more courage
[1:45:37] than a lot of the hypocrites
[1:45:40] that we have in this message
[1:45:44] who just thrive on intellect
[1:45:49] they thrive on
[1:45:50] and make living out of preaching the
[1:45:53] gospel to people
[1:45:54] that have grown up in it
[1:45:57] and don't know nothing else
[1:46:00] i recommend that you go to the back side
[1:46:03] of the desert
[1:46:05] do you pray fast if necessary
[1:46:08] till you know in your heart but on the
[1:46:11] shadow of a doubt this
[1:46:14] fits
[1:46:15] what's on the inside of the inside of me
[1:46:20] and i'm not anchored
[1:46:23] because of
[1:46:24] stories i'm not anchored because of
[1:46:27] history of miracles
[1:46:30] i'm not anchored by intellectual
[1:46:33] understanding i'm anchored because that
[1:46:36] voice matched something that god put in
[1:46:40] me
[1:46:40] [Applause]
[1:46:46] and nobody's clever enough
[1:46:49] or smart enough
[1:46:51] to take that part out
[1:46:54] now you may have not found it yet
[1:46:58] but it didn't come from man
[1:47:05] it came from god
[1:47:11] don't tell me it's unscriptural
[1:47:18] you give people a math book
[1:47:20] they'll come closer together
[1:47:22] you give them a bible they'll go far
[1:47:24] apart
[1:47:25] the kingdom of god flesh and blood hath
[1:47:29] not revealed this unto you
[1:47:31] but my father which is in heaven
[1:47:33] revealed it to you upon this rock i'll
[1:47:36] build my church the church is not built
[1:47:39] on reasoning
[1:47:43] it's based on the revelation
[1:47:46] that the seed of god is in you
[1:47:51] paul when he said come reason
[1:47:53] he was saying let's use that
[1:47:56] faculty
[1:47:58] of the spirit man
[1:48:00] to see if we can find an avenue to the
[1:48:04] soul that's in the inside and see if the
[1:48:08] things that i'm saying will stick amen
[1:48:12] if they don't stick the fellowship is
[1:48:15] right here
[1:48:19] and that's all the poor soul is saying i
[1:48:22] don't have it on the inside so i'm
[1:48:24] looking for fellowship here
[1:48:27] who will come fellowship with me
[1:48:30] i will
[1:48:32] i will
[1:48:34] i'll come fellowship with you there
[1:48:37] i'll fellowship with you in that realm
[1:48:40] i'll fellowship you with you in that
[1:48:41] spirit
[1:48:43] i have that
[1:48:48] i have that
[1:48:50] i have this bible i have the spirit i
[1:48:53] have laying on of hands i have good
[1:48:56] works
[1:48:58] i don't like talking like this
[1:49:01] sister jeanette chewed me out because i
[1:49:03] run myself down so i told her i'll lift
[1:49:06] myself up
[1:49:09] i've got those things that's right
[1:49:12] i know what it's like to give
[1:49:16] i love to give
[1:49:18] i love to help
[1:49:19] i love to have people conquered that's
[1:49:22] in my nature because i've been born
[1:49:24] again
[1:49:26] and the love of god is shed abroad in my
[1:49:28] heart by the holy spirit
[1:49:31] i love those things
[1:49:33] i have fellowship in all those things
[1:49:38] but i don't believe the message because
[1:49:40] of anything
[1:49:43] i don't believe the message because of
[1:49:45] anything
[1:49:46] in this realm
[1:49:50] or this realm
[1:49:52] it's something that god put in me
[1:49:57] that it connected with
[1:50:02] those apostles in them of that day
[1:50:04] paragraph 150 who was ordained to life
[1:50:09] he noted said all the father
[1:50:12] hath given me will come
[1:50:17] the only thing you have to do
[1:50:21] is just make my voice known
[1:50:25] they know it
[1:50:26] for my sheep know
[1:50:29] my
[1:50:30] voice
[1:50:34] okay
[1:50:36] so tell me it's not his voice
[1:50:39] okay
[1:50:42] it's not his voice
[1:50:44] it's not his voice to you
[1:50:52] out and take somebody's pet
[1:50:55] you know call him by a name
[1:50:58] my son's got a cat that's a dog
[1:51:03] oliver
[1:51:04] over
[1:51:07] here he comes
[1:51:09] no other cat responds
[1:51:15] it's not a generic call
[1:51:20] now
[1:51:21] if you want to preach a hear kitty kitty
[1:51:24] gospel
[1:51:26] go ahead
[1:51:28] here kitty kitty kitty
[1:51:31] i've got something for you i've got a
[1:51:34] better attitude i've got a better nature
[1:51:36] i've got a better interpretation of the
[1:51:38] scripture here kitty kitty kitty kitty
[1:51:41] but this isn't a kitty kitty gospel
[1:51:44] this is a gospel that's got a name on it
[1:51:48] it's got my name on it
[1:52:00] they know it
[1:52:02] my sheep know my voice
[1:52:04] and a voice
[1:52:06] is a word
[1:52:08] expressed
[1:52:10] they believe it anyhow
[1:52:12] they don't have to scientifically prove
[1:52:16] anything or ask any sadducee or pharisee
[1:52:20] or anything else about it
[1:52:23] i said it they believe it my sheep hear
[1:52:26] my voice
[1:52:28] can you imagine something that's
[1:52:30] supposedly preaching the unadulterated
[1:52:33] word of god
[1:52:37] directing you
[1:52:39] to places of question
[1:52:45] or say listen to this person he's got a
[1:52:47] good personality
[1:52:49] i'll tell you where god meets a man
[1:52:51] he meets the man on the word of god by
[1:52:54] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:52:57] and if you don't have this inside
[1:53:01] we can talk
[1:53:03] until we're
[1:53:04] blue in the face
[1:53:07] nobody can prove it
[1:53:13] a trial
[1:53:16] are you putting the predestinated seed
[1:53:19] of god on trial
[1:53:21] who in the world do you think you are
[1:53:26] yes sir
[1:53:29] 817-909-5154
[1:53:41] i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[1:53:44] christ
[1:53:45] for it is the power of god
[1:53:48] [Music]
[1:53:53] that's not the question you know why
[1:53:56] it's successful
[1:53:58] because so many people have never made
[1:54:00] contact
[1:54:01] with the inside man
[1:54:04] what they've got is not genuine
[1:54:10] and they just
[1:54:11] criticize it
[1:54:13] and their criticism is true
[1:54:17] and it'll swallow up people
[1:54:19] who see the same thing
[1:54:25] they believe it for my sheep know my
[1:54:27] voice
[1:54:29] and this is the voice of god
[1:54:31] in letter form
[1:54:34] because this is the entire revelation of
[1:54:37] jesus christ
[1:54:39] old and new testament put together
[1:54:42] there you are
[1:54:46] why you say
[1:54:48] these are good people what makes them
[1:54:51] because one thing
[1:54:54] their thai post
[1:54:56] is on a church
[1:55:00] and you remember last sunday a week ago
[1:55:03] how many was here and heard the sermon
[1:55:05] the anointed ones in the last days
[1:55:09] i think all of you
[1:55:11] see
[1:55:12] they are anointed
[1:55:14] their spirits are anointed in this
[1:55:17] second
[1:55:19] realm
[1:55:30] let's just eat here
[1:55:34] he says let's paragraph 160.
[1:55:38] now you tell her that it's wrong for her
[1:55:41] to cut her hair
[1:55:43] the bible said so it's wrong for her to
[1:55:45] wear them shorts the bible said so
[1:55:48] and she says it's nonsense
[1:55:51] why her ultimate is not down here
[1:55:55] in that third man
[1:56:01] the soul
[1:56:03] that's predestinated
[1:56:05] and sent from god
[1:56:08] but her ultimate is on
[1:56:11] the organization out here
[1:56:14] that some some man or some organization
[1:56:18] outside of this
[1:56:21] so what happens is it's not on the
[1:56:23] inside
[1:56:24] so what does he do
[1:56:26] he turns to somebody on the outside
[1:56:31] a good brother
[1:56:33] oh brother such and such fine brother
[1:56:35] i've known him for such a long time
[1:56:37] wonderful brother wonderful spirit
[1:56:40] go listen to what he has to say
[1:56:45] go ahead
[1:56:49] go ahead
[1:56:53] i would rather have 10 people with the
[1:56:56] seed of god that could do something
[1:57:03] go ahead
[1:57:04] i don't have to fight it
[1:57:09] you don't need to fight it
[1:57:11] you understand
[1:57:13] it's all
[1:57:14] ready there
[1:57:17] i didn't receive
[1:57:19] a new message
[1:57:21] half of the message was already in me
[1:57:29] all the message did was made me
[1:57:32] whole
[1:57:36] it didn't make the
[1:57:39] the brother whole
[1:57:46] so he's returning to what he's hold
[1:57:50] a good
[1:57:52] godly
[1:57:54] spirit-filled
[1:57:56] man
[1:57:57] fill of the holy ghost a wonderful
[1:58:00] pastor a wonderful brother
[1:58:03] amen
[1:58:05] commendable
[1:58:07] for the healings that have followed his
[1:58:09] ministry
[1:58:11] for the wonderful deliverance
[1:58:14] i believe if someone came for them about
[1:58:16] he'd give him godly counsel
[1:58:21] there's nothing wrong with the person as
[1:58:23] far as being a christian
[1:58:27] it's just this message isn't for
[1:58:29] christians
[1:58:42] but if the word of god is down in that
[1:58:45] soul
[1:58:48] okay
[1:58:49] what is the soul
[1:58:52] it's the free will that makes the choice
[1:58:56] if there's so
[1:58:57] isn't something in there
[1:59:00] driving that choice
[1:59:04] you only have one place to return to to
[1:59:07] make the decision
[1:59:09] right
[1:59:12] your flesh or your other
[1:59:14] senses but if that word of god is down
[1:59:18] in that soul it says amen
[1:59:21] i see it
[1:59:23] it lines up with it
[1:59:27] wait a minute
[1:59:30] not carnally lines up with it
[1:59:33] that's where the air is
[1:59:35] that's why we've taught the gospel wrong
[1:59:38] but
[1:59:39] if that soul's in there
[1:59:42] it
[1:59:43] lines up with it
[1:59:45] it
[1:59:47] matches
[1:59:50] it
[1:59:52] fits
[1:59:55] now can you imagine me going home saying
[1:59:57] sweetheart
[1:59:59] i really love you you're a beautiful
[2:00:00] woman to me i think you'd look prettier
[2:00:02] in a pair of pants
[2:00:06] if you think i can sell that to leslie
[2:00:10] you don't know her very well
[2:00:14] because if it comes down to the word of
[2:00:16] god she's going to say sweetheart i love
[2:00:18] you take a hike
[2:00:24] but if it's not inner
[2:00:31] can you imagine my wife coming to me and
[2:00:32] saying you know dear i don't really see
[2:00:34] everything brother venom sees
[2:00:40] what they testify to
[2:00:44] i don't really see this i don't really
[2:00:45] see that
[2:00:49] i wouldn't divorce her
[2:00:51] i'd say honey i'll pray for you
[2:00:54] i believe it's in there
[2:00:56] and i believe if you pray long enough
[2:00:58] and you pray for me long enough and
[2:01:01] you'll help me that one day those pieces
[2:01:03] will slide together and they'll match
[2:01:09] but if someone drops it on you like this
[2:01:14] and that part matches up
[2:01:17] you can go on that a long time
[2:01:20] but until it matches up on the whole
[2:01:22] picture
[2:01:25] you're not complete
[2:01:28] you've got religion
[2:01:30] instead of life
[2:01:34] it lines up with it now look here
[2:01:37] therefore the man that's born of the
[2:01:40] spirit of god see here on the outside
[2:01:43] i'm speaking in mix audience and he'll
[2:01:45] just go down to that we won't go there
[2:01:58] i had such a
[2:02:00] so many
[2:02:02] wonderful wonderful statements that
[2:02:07] can be read
[2:02:08] uh
[2:02:09] in in the great things
[2:02:11] of god this morning
[2:02:13] he says a real genuine this is paragraph
[2:02:15] 181
[2:02:17] a real genuine christian will cope
[2:02:20] with that inside man
[2:02:23] that spirit that was back yonder at the
[2:02:26] beginning which is the word
[2:02:32] is am i drawing the picture clear enough
[2:02:34] for you this morning
[2:02:36] without a shadow of a doubt
[2:02:38] so when you hear these things
[2:02:40] you can sit there and say i understand
[2:02:42] where he's coming from
[2:02:45] i totally understand it
[2:02:49] because if it's
[2:02:52] he said
[2:02:54] a real genuine christian will hope
[2:02:56] with that inside man that spirit that
[2:02:59] was back yonder at the beginning which
[2:03:02] is the word
[2:03:04] he was
[2:03:06] it was
[2:03:07] as he was the fullness
[2:03:10] of
[2:03:11] all of you
[2:03:16] look at that statement
[2:03:18] is it up there
[2:03:21] he was the fullness of all of you
[2:03:24] you were
[2:03:25] in him back yonder
[2:03:28] at calvary
[2:03:31] he foreknew
[2:03:32] you would be here
[2:03:35] he only broadcast
[2:03:37] what would take place
[2:03:40] and you were in him
[2:03:42] you died with him
[2:03:45] you died to your pride you died to your
[2:03:48] fashion you died to the world
[2:03:51] you died with him in calvary
[2:03:54] and you rose with him
[2:03:56] when he rose again on the third day
[2:04:00] and because
[2:04:03] and because you've accepted it now
[2:04:06] you're sitting in heavenly
[2:04:08] places in christ jesus
[2:04:10] there you are
[2:04:12] it's that inside man
[2:04:14] that inside
[2:04:16] that will punctuate
[2:04:18] the word
[2:04:20] hang with the word regardless you can't
[2:04:24] help it
[2:04:28] hallelujah that's right
[2:04:31] i can't help it
[2:04:35] my reasoning don't work
[2:04:42] i i i i can't help it
[2:04:46] i can't help it fits
[2:04:48] i can't help it's putting something
[2:04:50] there i don't condemn you for not having
[2:04:53] it
[2:04:55] maybe you do have it
[2:04:59] and you've got to go through this
[2:05:05] i am not going to
[2:05:07] draw a circle
[2:05:10] and put somebody out
[2:05:13] draw a bigger circle
[2:05:18] he goes and he gives the end of the book
[2:05:20] if you want to go home and read it
[2:05:23] he explains
[2:05:25] his experiences that brother branham
[2:05:27] does why he's anchored
[2:05:30] but i'm not anchored
[2:05:33] because of what
[2:05:35] brother branham was anchored to
[2:05:37] i didn't know brother branham
[2:05:40] i know when brother brahm died
[2:05:45] because i was in a car
[2:05:47] when it came over the rodeo
[2:05:50] and for some strange reason it made me
[2:05:52] cry
[2:05:56] i heard a tape
[2:05:58] listening to it
[2:06:01] drove up the street and saw exactly what
[2:06:03] was on the tape there
[2:06:06] i personally
[2:06:09] don't need any outside vindication
[2:06:19] i have my own
[2:06:22] vindication that's right
[2:06:25] now god makes some
[2:06:27] vessels to honor
[2:06:29] some to dishonor
[2:06:31] if if you choose to put me
[2:06:34] in the vessel
[2:06:36] of
[2:06:37] being
[2:06:39] dishonorable
[2:06:40] you have a right to do that
[2:06:46] but the fact that you can't reason it
[2:06:48] out
[2:06:52] and you can't find scripture for it
[2:06:55] and if you don't believe what's said
[2:07:00] that doesn't make it wrong
[2:07:11] it's been proved to me
[2:07:14] beyond
[2:07:15] a reasonable
[2:07:17] shadow
[2:07:18] of doubt
[2:07:20] so you have to know this gospel beyond
[2:07:23] reasoning
[2:07:25] so when someone invites you
[2:07:28] to reason
[2:07:30] and says
[2:07:33] let's reason
[2:07:35] remember they're inviting you out
[2:07:38] to the second circle
[2:07:44] and the only reason you'll go there
[2:07:47] is because there's not a seed
[2:07:49] on the inside of the inside
[2:07:52] to keep you there
[2:07:54] now i asked you this morning
[2:07:58] you say
[2:08:00] what should i title this sermon
[2:08:02] how about
[2:08:03] making contact
[2:08:06] with the inside
[2:08:08] man
[2:08:11] and so
[2:08:15] that's where i stand
[2:08:19] i'm open to fellowship
[2:08:21] i've given my phone number out
[2:08:26] as for me and my house
[2:08:29] we're going to serve the lord amen
[2:08:34] and
[2:08:35] i'm
[2:08:37] i'm not going to war
[2:08:41] against
[2:08:45] christians
[2:08:48] i'm not going to try to dis
[2:08:50] de-christianize anybody
[2:08:53] i'm thankful
[2:08:58] i want soldiers that stand next to me
[2:09:00] that are willing to die for the cause
[2:09:06] that believe what what i have
[2:09:08] experienced that have got on the inside
[2:09:11] of them what i've got on the inside of
[2:09:13] me
[2:09:14] i am not the one who chooses to put it
[2:09:17] there
[2:09:20] it's predestinated
[2:09:23] foreordained
[2:09:24] and that's what the prophet said i
[2:09:26] preach this message to some people and
[2:09:28] they just take it and they believe it
[2:09:31] and they go with it he says that's
[2:09:33] because it was foreordained
[2:09:36] and some people grew up in it in their
[2:09:38] life
[2:09:39] they were raised in it they were taught
[2:09:41] in every experience they had was in it
[2:09:44] could they never they never
[2:09:47] was able to really come
[2:09:49] and get to that experience
[2:09:54] and don't let that happen to you
[2:10:00] don't let that happen to you
[2:10:02] you make sure
[2:10:04] you pray
[2:10:06] and you get into the presence of god
[2:10:08] and you say like peter flesh and blood
[2:10:12] hath revealed this to me
[2:10:15] there's something in here
[2:10:17] that it matched up
[2:10:19] god bless you this morning
[2:10:22] amen
