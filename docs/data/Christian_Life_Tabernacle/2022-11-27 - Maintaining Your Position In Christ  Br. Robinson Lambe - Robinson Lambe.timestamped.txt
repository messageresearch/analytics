[7:49] I enjoyed that
[7:52] John was playing there at the beginning
[7:54] in the presence
[7:57] of Jehovah we might be few in number
[8:00] tonight with many that are out but as
[8:02] long as he's here as long as we're in
[8:06] his presence
[8:08] if I could just give a personal
[8:09] testimony before the service would start
[8:12] it's been in Services where
[8:15] there's just a few people that I can
[8:19] remember God's presence so near and dear
[8:21] to my heart so if we can just take it
[8:23] personal and know that maybe many are
[8:25] out we might not bid many in number but
[8:27] Jesus Christ has come because he has
[8:30] something specific for you let's just
[8:33] stand and sing this in and out of
[8:36] situations

[15:53] opportunity to open the service and
[15:55] prayer and just also bring a prayer
[15:58] request
[15:59] [Music]
[16:01] it's good to be in the presence of the
[16:03] Lord
[16:06] and it's good to know that if you have a
[16:08] need there's a God here
[16:10] that has the answer to your question
[16:13] to your heartache to your pain to your
[16:16] healing whatever it is prayer changes
[16:18] things
[16:20] sometimes the battle rages long
[16:23] sometimes the trial seems longer than
[16:26] you
[16:26] but bear
[16:28] I imagine
[16:29] [Music]
[16:32] job's trial seemed
[16:37] like eternity
[16:39] but there was a character and a goal and
[16:41] a revelation
[16:43] that was coming forth out of job so be
[16:46] encouraged to know that God holds it all
[16:48] in his hand
[16:49] and it'll be worth it all because soon
[16:51] and very soon
[16:52] we're going to step from one dimension

[43:05] uh Hassan
[43:08] as Pastor rightly said
[43:12] Moses happens to be my fifth child
[43:15] of eight children
[43:18] I had four boys four girls but the Lord
[43:21] called one of them the boy
[43:24] and the other three uh
[43:28] doing well even the sisters are all in
[43:31] the message
[43:33] by the grace of God
[43:35] so I thank God for that Grace
[43:42] can you stand up sister let them at
[43:44] least you let them see Moises mother
[43:47] good
[43:49] [Applause]
[43:51] thank you for the appreciation
[43:55] she did it eight times for me to bring
[43:57] me children it was not easy for her
[44:00] so she's very precious to me
[44:03] uh very very precious
[44:07] when I had the first tree
[44:10] I decided to stop
[44:12] then the Lord showed her a vision how
[44:15] she was having a boy
[44:17] it happened the same way it happened to
[44:19] Buddha banam instead of the boy coming
[44:22] directly afterwards it's a girl who came
[44:26] so we knew that the prophecy was still
[44:29] to come
[44:30] then
[44:32] not only did the Lord say a boy was
[44:34] coming he also gave his name he's the
[44:37] only the only of my the only one who
[44:40] came with his name so Moses came with
[44:42] his name
[44:44] and
[44:47] subsequently we had two more
[44:50] then
[44:53] when we got to the seventh child I
[44:55] decided to stop again
[44:57] and this time we went in for an
[44:59] oppression the the the this something we
[45:03] call ligature the the Trump the the just
[45:07] stopped everything they cut the the
[45:11] ligation thank you sir that's a very big
[45:14] big way
[45:17] and so we were sure that we know we had
[45:22] no problem again with uh having kids
[45:25] one night one day into the day not
[45:28] during a night she was sleeping resting
[45:32] at the siesta in her room and then she
[45:36] saw somebody came in and carried an
[45:39] oppression on her
[45:40] and they removed some work was done in
[45:43] her body seemingly
[45:46] they destroyed the operation
[45:48] and sister
[45:51] conceived again
[45:54] it was a very very annoying experience
[45:58] for her because she was already tired of
[46:00] the whole thing
[46:02] she carried that child and the Lord as
[46:04] if the Lord wanted to give her a
[46:06] correction she carried that child for 12
[46:09] months
[46:11] yes the last one
[46:13] 12 months the child was in the stomach
[46:16] and it was not easy at all for her
[46:20] so we got to eat
[46:24] and we said this time well God you know
[46:26] everything
[46:28] we just left it in the hands of the Lord
[46:31] but all of them are big the last one is
[46:34] 28 years old
[46:36] so you can imagine we got married with
[46:38] 20 and I think she was 17. I got married
[46:43] and we have been together for 47 years
[46:49] we have been together for 47 years
[46:53] bought for
[46:55] four years and not believe the message
[46:57] so I believe when
[47:00] in
[47:01] 1979 so I've been in the message on the
[47:05] preacher for 43 years
[47:08] so
[47:10] by the grace of God will live the
[47:12] peaceful life
[47:13] and we're still together to continue the
[47:16] fight may God bless her and bless our
[47:20] children
[47:21] I'm here to say thank you in fact this
[47:26] morning I was so tired we went to Moses
[47:29] took me to
[47:31] OK me to Mexico
[47:34] we went we came down through San Antonio
[47:41] the right to
[47:45] Del Rio
[47:47] as if that was not sufficient for him he
[47:50] carried me again to
[47:52] how many hours into Mexico
[47:56] so we're doing a lot of work there I
[47:58] spent almost a week there
[48:01] and we came in yesterday
[48:04] after a certain meeting here in Altus
[48:08] Altus you say Altus
[48:10] good so we had a wonderful time there
[48:12] with some breading and we had a patient
[48:15] we wanted to visit here
[48:17] so we came in the evening and when we
[48:20] finished with the patient I called
[48:22] Pastor McGary to announce to him that I
[48:25] was already in town
[48:28] and I felt so tired also was we had
[48:33] walked a lot we're getting over time 4
[48:35] a.m 5 a.m traveling
[48:38] took the plane from the Rio six o'clock
[48:41] it's all night cold and all of that so
[48:44] I'm not sure that I'll be able to but I
[48:47] call him just to announce that I was
[48:49] coming
[48:49] and then this morning I was already
[48:52] saying I was tired
[48:54] he told me you're going to church and we
[48:57] must be on time
[48:59] I say I don't like getting ready to
[49:00] church so
[49:02] he made it quickly and I was evicted
[49:05] so I could not see the honorable Pastor
[49:08] Before Time
[49:10] to announce that I had I was already in
[49:12] church
[49:13] then when I went to see him he decided
[49:17] to put
[49:18] this burden on me to give me this
[49:24] responsibility of talking to beloved
[49:27] people like you
[49:29] while talking to him yesterday
[49:32] I kept telling I was not sure to meet
[49:34] him so I said well I'm again I want to
[49:36] appreciate you
[49:38] because you're doing a great job
[49:42] you are
[49:43] I know what it is and what it takes
[49:47] to deal with people of various Scholars
[49:51] tribes Nations and so forth if she stand
[49:55] in the middle in such a way that you can
[49:57] bring them together and work and help
[50:00] them
[50:01] in the service of the Lord so I was when
[50:04] I was talking to him he said no brother
[50:07] it's not me Lord I said stop all that
[50:12] receive your flowers
[50:16] I I I I I I like giving people's flowers
[50:21] when they are alive
[50:22] because when they when they are in a
[50:24] coffin you put all those things on their
[50:27] boxes they don't mean anything to him
[50:29] you learn to congratulate a man
[50:33] who's doing a great job
[50:35] and
[50:37] we I must say thank you well not because
[50:41] I'm studying here
[50:42] I am not used to flattering if you come
[50:45] to a country
[50:46] yeah maybe one of the the hardest
[50:49] creatures you can imagine had very hard
[50:52] and difficult to extract
[50:56] words or flattery for my mouth it
[50:59] doesn't resemble me but
[51:01] when something is good
[51:03] call it good
[51:06] it is true that the pastor of this
[51:08] church is Jesus Christ but he has an
[51:11] angel in the church he has a
[51:13] representative in the church
[51:15] and you must say thank you to that
[51:18] person
[51:19] we see them messages everywhere he went
[51:22] he spent time to appreciate
[51:25] the pastors the men of God who are
[51:28] walking and we shall not change those
[51:30] things because we want to we don't want
[51:33] to scare but I'm again you know we keep
[51:35] saying I will repeat God bless you sir
[51:38] for the wonderful work you're doing
[51:41] that you not only
[51:43] are taking good care of this
[51:46] makes draw of tongues
[51:50] countries everything
[51:52] but you are still open
[51:55] to other preachers
[51:57] who want to bring in a contribution to
[52:00] this church
[52:01] we I saw the other day I was watching
[52:04] your program here
[52:05] we're in Tampa called me say just open
[52:08] the link so so so so you see our
[52:11] meetings there and I follow the meetings
[52:13] I was very blessed I have my new year I
[52:17] was in the course of the meetings I took
[52:20] a lot of notes to the Brotherhood
[52:21] preached I don't know his name but one
[52:24] brother preached so well and I was so
[52:26] blessed I took a lot of notes and I
[52:29] praise the Lord
[52:30] for a good spirit like this for people
[52:33] like this who are really helping to
[52:37] project
[52:38] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may
[52:41] God bless him indeed
[52:43] it's not blessing
[52:45] is blessing in deep
[52:48] but that's very important
[52:50] indeed that is in the reality of it that
[52:53] blessing should be given to him
[52:56] want to thank him for a wonderful wife
[52:59] a wonderful mother
[53:02] and wonderful children
[53:04] who are not a disgraced to their parents
[53:07] who have also stood by their father
[53:10] and embracing the message
[53:13] preaching the message leaving the
[53:15] message
[53:16] and collaborating with their father
[53:19] for the success of the Gospel
[53:22] may God bless his entire family
[53:25] in the name of Jesus
[53:28] I'm telling you I won't even think of
[53:29] coming here I'm honest I was I was I
[53:32] even negotiated with that young man
[53:34] directly lead me I want to sleep
[53:37] I was broken we had worked so hard
[53:42] so hard
[53:46] but
[53:48] he was interested in seeing me with his
[53:50] pastor
[53:52] brother McGarry
[53:54] I give all of you once more in the name
[53:56] of Jesus
[53:58] I bring your greetings from Cameroon
[54:01] uh many Braden asked me to
[54:04] greet and salute
[54:07] wherever I go let me
[54:10] share Christian love with them
[54:13] by the grace of God
[54:15] and move around in a few countries in
[54:18] Africa
[54:20] go to other places
[54:22] times to Congo we go to Ivory Coast we
[54:26] go to Nigeria
[54:27] we are running around the place
[54:29] encouraging the children of God
[54:32] and we are happy
[54:34] that the message which
[54:37] excuse me which God revealed to you
[54:41] in America
[54:42] is on fire in Africa now those Africans
[54:47] have seen
[54:49] that this message is authentic
[54:52] is from God
[54:54] and they are very concerned
[54:56] with the progress of the message is
[54:59] there no world clock here
[55:01] you don't have a clock
[55:07] okay great all right I'm not seeing you
[55:10] it's okay I have my I'll use my Watch
[55:12] because I know we I'm from a place we
[55:15] have a presently there's a war in our
[55:18] country
[55:19] the English people those who are
[55:22] English-speaking want to separate from
[55:24] the French speaking so
[55:27] in the section where I walk where I live
[55:30] it's because I work in both sections we
[55:32] preach in English and French but where I
[55:35] live in the angrophone section
[55:37] we hold meetings a bit early
[55:41] because we cannot afford to run around
[55:43] in the night
[55:45] so when I come I come to America and I
[55:48] see people coming to church maybe at
[55:50] seven and it's it's something a bit new
[55:53] for me of recent it's not it has not
[55:56] been the best for us tough but
[55:59] God has been our helper
[56:02] I was here more than five years ago and
[56:05] since then to come out of the place I
[56:07] could not because I had I was very
[56:09] concerned with my children the churches
[56:11] and so forth you have to hang around
[56:13] there because you don't know what can
[56:15] happen
[56:16] but the war is subsiding in the way
[56:21] not that maybe some Mondays we don't
[56:25] even we just call it ghost towns you
[56:27] know nobody goes out you just stay at
[56:29] home
[56:30] it's it's not easy but God is helping us
[56:34] and I thank God for all of you
[56:37] so we
[56:39] it's not because Pastor said
[56:42] time is we are we have not I will not
[56:45] exaggerate
[56:47] because I know many of you are tired you
[56:49] are just from your
[56:51] Thanksgiving holiday and many people are
[56:54] going back to work tomorrow so I think I
[56:58] just let me do something essential that
[57:01] can edify all of us so
[57:03] um I know what I know what I'm supposed
[57:05] to do when I come to a church which is
[57:08] in all of these a lot of because I
[57:11] happened I was telling the pastor
[57:13] to one of the churches which I am
[57:18] I'm
[57:19] pastoring is full of people from
[57:22] different
[57:24] churches not denomination different
[57:28] beliefs in the message
[57:31] so people who believe this or believe
[57:34] that we I have one one of those churches
[57:36] is a church which is let me call it a
[57:39] Cosmopolitan Church
[57:41] in terms of Doctrine
[57:44] so I have to at some point I felt the
[57:48] Lord warning me in my mind and telling
[57:51] me
[57:51] they are coming to your church your job
[57:55] is to most most of them come as students
[57:57] we are it's a university town so we have
[58:01] a very big English-speaking University a
[58:04] many people come in and those students
[58:06] who come in
[58:07] need a place to Fellowship so most the
[58:12] pastors direct most of them to me
[58:13] because I happen to be at least the
[58:16] Elder
[58:17] so when they come the Lord lead on my
[58:21] mind that as they are coming
[58:24] they should not go back Sinners because
[58:27] you were insisting on one Doctrine or
[58:30] teaching this one and you are confusing
[58:32] them you stay in the middle Let each and
[58:36] every one of them maintain their faith
[58:38] until they go back
[58:40] so I'm very very careful when I you know
[58:43] incorporate in a system like that one
[58:45] you must know what you say because there
[58:48] are so many things to say you don't need
[58:51] to drag this will be a fanatic
[58:54] but when I'm said
[58:56] if the devil
[58:58] cannot remove what you have from you
[59:01] what you believe you take what you have
[59:05] and make of you a fanatic
[59:07] and I think fanatism is a very dangerous
[59:10] activity
[59:12] and I like I just enjoyed I was telling
[59:15] the pastor that I was so happy the way
[59:17] this morning he just in a very pastoral
[59:21] manner handled and talked to his people
[59:24] I was I was so impressed if I even if I
[59:28] was going away with just what he was
[59:30] saying I was I thank God for a man like
[59:32] this
[59:33] there's a lot of wisdom you need a lot
[59:36] of wisdom to lead people a lot of wisdom
[59:40] to go about in situations
[59:42] and I think your pastor is very mature
[59:47] to handle situations
[59:49] and to encourage you people to stabilize
[59:54] you and to have a wonderful church so
[59:57] I'm glad to be in a media which is
[1:00:02] balanced which is
[1:00:04] but there's no fanatism there's no
[1:00:06] exaggeration where people are just wise
[1:00:10] and are careful
[1:00:12] very careful because we are walking in
[1:00:15] somebody's Vineyard
[1:00:16] and for him to create the church for
[1:00:20] Jesus okay
[1:00:23] I'm okay okay for Jesus to create the
[1:00:26] church he had to give his blood
[1:00:29] he died for this business this business
[1:00:32] called church is the business of Jesus
[1:00:35] Christ he did not invest money to do
[1:00:39] this business he didn't buy gold and
[1:00:42] King and and sold it or whatever no he
[1:00:47] gave his blood he died for this
[1:00:52] and because of the value of what he did
[1:00:57] we must be respectful we must speak with
[1:01:00] the fear of God we must live with the
[1:01:03] fear of God because it took God
[1:01:06] what you cannot imagine
[1:01:08] sacrifice
[1:01:10] to save one of us here you me and all
[1:01:14] the brothers
[1:01:15] so the Church of God is a wonderful
[1:01:17] place
[1:01:18] and we have to all of us maintain the
[1:01:22] church
[1:01:23] with the fear of God the love of God
[1:01:27] when I came to since I got here I've
[1:01:31] been talking a bit about something very
[1:01:34] simple well I don't know whether it's I
[1:01:36] don't know how I can call it I've been
[1:01:38] very interested in
[1:01:40] the world Ministry
[1:01:43] Ministry
[1:01:45] I shared it a lot in Tampa which tried
[1:01:49] to share in
[1:01:51] uh
[1:01:52] uh Acuna we went to Ministry
[1:01:56] and it all started with
[1:01:59] a verse that we can read we know very
[1:02:02] well in the book of the song of
[1:02:05] Solomon it's a love story and Solomon
[1:02:09] was talking about he said my
[1:02:13] Ministry I'm not taking good care of it
[1:02:17] it is it's a just let's see if we can't
[1:02:21] get to that it will help us a bit
[1:02:24] the rest of it is not what I've just
[1:02:27] that part that aspect that that
[1:02:29] particular
[1:02:31] part of the verse I was it I was so
[1:02:34] interested in that said what is that
[1:02:36] again just the Song of Solomon 9 4 5.
[1:02:42] okay
[1:02:44] just a minute please
[1:02:48] all right
[1:02:51] so what where are we it should be
[1:02:55] this chapter one verse 6.
[1:03:02] it's just part of just the last part of
[1:03:05] verse six not the entire
[1:03:08] verse
[1:03:09] he said but mine own Vineyard
[1:03:15] have I not kept
[1:03:18] my own Vineyard
[1:03:21] and this morning I was so impressed at
[1:03:24] the end of his preaching our brother was
[1:03:27] explaining to us that at some point
[1:03:30] God had to call up the prophet
[1:03:33] because the Holy Ghost
[1:03:35] had to continue the work to call on you
[1:03:39] to call on me ask us to come in
[1:03:44] and the
[1:03:46] meditating on this
[1:03:48] I discovered that he did not call us
[1:03:54] were not called
[1:03:57] to to build an altar around
[1:04:00] or to adore him
[1:04:03] he did not call us
[1:04:06] because we live in the D
[1:04:09] that people like to exalt other people
[1:04:14] on other people
[1:04:17] in such a way
[1:04:19] that
[1:04:20] they disappear under those people
[1:04:23] they themselves have no meaning for
[1:04:26] their life they are nothing
[1:04:30] and I became afraid of one thing
[1:04:33] we can be so eloquent
[1:04:35] about the balance works with message and
[1:04:39] so forth
[1:04:40] and we finally are nothing
[1:04:44] we are just historians
[1:04:47] we are just storytellers
[1:04:50] we Master a lot of wallabana
[1:04:53] we know little or nothing about
[1:04:56] ourselves
[1:04:59] as if
[1:05:01] it was all about Ghana alone maybe
[1:05:04] Branham and his children
[1:05:06] was all about him
[1:05:09] it was all about you
[1:05:11] that's why he sent the prophet
[1:05:14] to awaken you
[1:05:17] to remind you
[1:05:20] that you two are authorities
[1:05:23] in the service of God
[1:05:26] so I said I said my own portion
[1:05:30] so I have a portion
[1:05:33] which I can call a Ministry
[1:05:36] which is my responsibility
[1:05:40] so what then I asked what is say about
[1:05:43] this
[1:05:45] and I want you to the message
[1:05:47] his whole message about
[1:05:50] our the position of the Believers in
[1:05:53] Christ that's a whole message on its own
[1:05:57] and I said about this and I looked into
[1:06:00] a wonderful quotes of brother
[1:06:04] whatever said
[1:06:06] he said
[1:06:09] recognize
[1:06:12] your ministry
[1:06:15] just
[1:06:16] when I get away from this I was very
[1:06:19] close to the mic
[1:06:21] okay whatever said recognize have all
[1:06:25] the goods
[1:06:26] but I don't want to be long
[1:06:29] recognize
[1:06:31] your ministry
[1:06:35] just as
[1:06:38] Jesus
[1:06:39] recognize his ministry
[1:06:43] I said well this is too big
[1:06:45] see I must recognize my Ministry
[1:06:49] just as Jesus recognized his ministry
[1:06:53] I you
[1:06:55] sister brother all of us
[1:07:00] God does not call people for calling
[1:07:04] sick
[1:07:06] God calls people
[1:07:09] because he wants to attribute to them
[1:07:13] responsibilities
[1:07:17] two things first one I was saying
[1:07:20] that the tendency of human beings
[1:07:23] is the one called elevates a man
[1:07:26] you easily begin to adore him
[1:07:31] then you disappear under his ministry
[1:07:35] you become nothing
[1:07:40] and you are complexed
[1:07:44] you have a complex
[1:07:47] well I love what David said
[1:07:51] David said
[1:07:53] I Praise You Lord
[1:07:55] because I am
[1:07:57] a marvelous creature
[1:08:01] you don't see the marvels of God in your
[1:08:04] life
[1:08:05] you don't see the wonders of God in your
[1:08:07] life
[1:08:09] I was preaching one time in Ivory Coast
[1:08:12] and I got to I told the Brethren there I
[1:08:16] said there's a problem in on this Earth
[1:08:19] people
[1:08:21] don't
[1:08:23] believe
[1:08:24] their testimonies excuse me
[1:08:29] people don't believe their testimonies
[1:08:40] oh but I saw myself I was preaching I
[1:08:43] saw I was doing this I saw I saw you
[1:08:45] have been seeing all those things
[1:08:50] but do you believe what you see
[1:08:53] your brother did not believe
[1:08:56] all the strange things God was revealing
[1:09:00] to him
[1:09:01] you will not be seated while you are
[1:09:03] sitting
[1:09:06] belief is not an easy exercise
[1:09:09] it's very easy when it is already done
[1:09:13] when somebody has accomplished it
[1:09:15] then you come pressing that person
[1:09:19] and you refuse to know that
[1:09:22] Jesus gave a clean parable
[1:09:25] he said when he called the people
[1:09:29] it distributed to them talents
[1:09:32] he gave them
[1:09:34] everybody
[1:09:36] something to do
[1:09:38] that is why when you go to many churches
[1:09:41] you see that the weight
[1:09:43] is very much on the pastor
[1:09:46] maybe some Deacons
[1:09:49] maybe some other Christians were
[1:09:52] but the majority are just nice people in
[1:09:55] the church
[1:10:00] who are nice
[1:10:02] who are well seated
[1:10:04] but they do nothing
[1:10:07] about what they are supposed to do
[1:10:11] they don't even know who they are
[1:10:13] you don't even know that they matter
[1:10:19] they don't even know that they have
[1:10:21] their responsibility
[1:10:25] my own portion
[1:10:28] my responsibility
[1:10:31] I've not taken care what I'm supposed to
[1:10:34] do
[1:10:37] I'm not executing anything
[1:10:39] first of all I don't even know what I am
[1:10:43] I don't even know where I'm going
[1:10:45] just a matter of I believe the message
[1:10:49] I love the prophet
[1:10:52] I'm in The Message Church my pastor is
[1:10:54] brother magary
[1:10:56] very good address
[1:11:00] but I'm sorry you don't know why you are
[1:11:03] here
[1:11:05] you don't know why he sent you to Dallas
[1:11:08] he would have sent you to Minnesota or
[1:11:11] somewhere Dakota anyway
[1:11:13] sent you here
[1:11:15] for a purpose
[1:11:17] for a program
[1:11:20] and he's asking you to recognize
[1:11:24] it's all a matter of recognizing that
[1:11:26] sea Jesus recognized
[1:11:31] why God sent him here
[1:11:35] and for me not to forget
[1:11:38] I I'm thinking of something
[1:11:41] when somebody turned around and told
[1:11:44] complained to Jesus there is no no no no
[1:11:46] no no God forbid you are not going to
[1:11:48] die
[1:11:50] you don't you know how it is to touch
[1:11:52] current when you put your hand on
[1:11:55] current
[1:11:56] look at the reaction of Jesus
[1:11:59] get away from me Satan
[1:12:03] it was prompt
[1:12:05] it was hard it was direct
[1:12:10] you know why
[1:12:11] he touched
[1:12:13] the central team
[1:12:16] of why Jesus was on this Earth
[1:12:19] because if he did not die
[1:12:21] there will be no church like this one
[1:12:24] there'll be no denomination there'll be
[1:12:26] nothing there'll be nothing
[1:12:28] he came for that purpose
[1:12:31] he came to save me
[1:12:33] he came to save you
[1:12:35] and somebody turning to tell him that
[1:12:38] you should not die God forbid that you
[1:12:41] die his reaction was prompt
[1:12:45] I'm strong
[1:12:47] because he knew
[1:12:49] and he recognized
[1:12:51] that have been sent here
[1:12:54] this man is just touching
[1:12:56] what I would like the word in French
[1:12:58] that they say in French
[1:13:00] somewhere you are touching
[1:13:03] the what matters to me my life
[1:13:08] asking me not to go to the cross
[1:13:12] he recognized that
[1:13:14] that is being here was for a goal
[1:13:18] and they missed the prophet is asking
[1:13:21] you I have the coaches he should be here
[1:13:24] somewhere here
[1:13:28] how all those quotes about
[1:13:30] asking you to recognize you
[1:13:34] your position
[1:13:36] Who You Are
[1:13:40] if you ask many of you who are seated
[1:13:42] there who are you
[1:13:44] here you you have your very small
[1:13:47] address and they kept asking John the
[1:13:49] Baptist who are you
[1:13:52] see I am
[1:13:54] The Voice
[1:13:56] of the one who's kinded I am that's my
[1:13:58] address
[1:14:00] many of us have no address
[1:14:04] that's why we are caught
[1:14:07] in this other verse that I read in the
[1:14:09] book of Peter
[1:14:11] where he sees
[1:14:13] we find you meddling
[1:14:18] put in your hands
[1:14:19] in other people's matters
[1:14:23] you are playing a role which is not
[1:14:26] yours
[1:14:27] you occupying the post which is not your
[1:14:30] post
[1:14:32] what results can you have
[1:14:35] what good can you produce
[1:14:38] because you're not doing what you're
[1:14:40] supposed to do
[1:14:45] that when we the Bible talks of you are
[1:14:48] seated
[1:14:50] in Heavenly places
[1:14:53] he's talking about your position in
[1:14:55] Christ
[1:14:57] is the message
[1:14:59] about your position
[1:15:02] because we have a lot of inactive
[1:15:05] Christians
[1:15:08] we have a lot of visiting Christians
[1:15:15] we have a lot of people who have
[1:15:18] who are just deaf for being sick
[1:15:25] it's not a matter of being in one church
[1:15:27] or the other
[1:15:31] she
[1:15:36] here's let me read this one
[1:15:39] Believers position let me read at least
[1:15:41] this one now what a man in the Old
[1:15:43] Testament a Jewish man in Palestine
[1:15:46] where there was whatever he was
[1:15:50] the tribe of Joseph
[1:15:52] Ephraim
[1:15:54] what excuse me whatever it was
[1:15:58] he
[1:16:00] hard
[1:16:02] he's
[1:16:04] own
[1:16:05] loted grounds
[1:16:09] that
[1:16:10] belonged to him
[1:16:16] Old Testament
[1:16:18] you are Ephraim you are whatever
[1:16:20] explained
[1:16:22] it is inconformity with the Bible
[1:16:26] because those those
[1:16:28] modest
[1:16:31] every child that they put forth
[1:16:34] they gave that child a name
[1:16:38] which
[1:16:39] was correspond which corresponded to a
[1:16:43] special lot a special place in Palestine
[1:16:50] so
[1:16:52] when
[1:16:54] Moses Joshua was placing them he had no
[1:16:59] difficulties
[1:17:01] with knowing that what's your tribe
[1:17:03] what's your name oh great
[1:17:05] this is the place you are fishermen This
[1:17:09] one belongs to you you are Neftali this
[1:17:13] is your own Zone you are this
[1:17:17] confirming that
[1:17:19] those people went to their lord I was
[1:17:23] preaching in uh in in we're talking in
[1:17:27] Oklahoma altitude
[1:17:30] you don't go to some other places a lot
[1:17:34] it's all a matter all of Christianity
[1:17:37] all of belief is a matter of God removed
[1:17:41] you from there
[1:17:43] get you out and send you back
[1:17:47] Adam fell God removed him from There He
[1:17:51] sent Jesus to take us back
[1:17:53] he carried the Jews those Jews he said
[1:17:57] told Abraham I'll take them you are here
[1:17:59] now but I'll remove them from this place
[1:18:01] I'll take them there and I'll bring them
[1:18:03] back
[1:18:04] the whole exercise of Christianity all
[1:18:08] this activity that God is carrying out
[1:18:10] is a matter of removing you from where
[1:18:13] you were and bring you back to that
[1:18:15] place and there's a process that brings
[1:18:18] you back and you're going back to where
[1:18:20] you're supposed to be
[1:18:22] there is no mixture there's no disorder
[1:18:25] in the house of God
[1:18:28] I say no disorder
[1:18:30] everybody
[1:18:33] no
[1:18:34] and the prophet is even he goes further
[1:18:37] to say that you don't already know your
[1:18:40] position you fight for your position you
[1:18:44] defend your position
[1:18:46] it's not a matter of a church we are
[1:18:49] talking about the body of Christ
[1:18:51] not a matter of this local assembly you
[1:18:53] know
[1:18:55] to think that we have come here no no no
[1:18:58] no no
[1:18:59] we're talking to
[1:19:00] the children of God who are supposed
[1:19:04] to know exactly what God
[1:19:08] expects of them
[1:19:10] but God Express of you
[1:19:13] in your ministry I repeat your ministry
[1:19:18] you know at some point where I talk so
[1:19:20] much
[1:19:22] we talked about some good men of God in
[1:19:25] our country we encourage the borders
[1:19:28] and then I saw all you discovered that
[1:19:30] everybody is just there well and these
[1:19:32] are the good people we are there we just
[1:19:34] be worshiping and thanking God
[1:19:41] Elijah the prophet
[1:19:43] to bring back the hearts of the children
[1:19:47] to their fathers
[1:19:49] so when he finished his job God said you
[1:19:51] come and rest I'll continue with my
[1:19:53] children
[1:19:55] and this Holy Spirit
[1:19:57] himself
[1:19:59] has been going round
[1:20:01] and calling the children of God one
[1:20:04] after the other you see the wonderful
[1:20:06] work of the holy spirit is going around
[1:20:09] the world himself
[1:20:14] it's not a matter of somebody brought me
[1:20:16] to the message somebody no it's a seed
[1:20:21] that the spirit of God is setting
[1:20:25] hunting
[1:20:27] and when he comes to you
[1:20:29] he does not only reveal to you that
[1:20:32] you're a son of Abraham
[1:20:34] he also tells you what he expects of you
[1:20:39] because it is a chain of believers
[1:20:43] that's why the prophet preached the Seed
[1:20:45] of Abraham and the Bible says it he told
[1:20:49] Abraham that your seed will conquer
[1:20:52] it's not limited to a group of people
[1:20:56] everybody who thinks that he is a seed
[1:21:00] he is a Son of God he has that Seed of
[1:21:03] Abraham
[1:21:05] you want to go to heaven you want to go
[1:21:07] to the same heaven like Abraham
[1:21:09] or you must do the same exercise like
[1:21:12] Abraham
[1:21:13] I'm sorry to tell you
[1:21:17] you will not pretend there and go and
[1:21:20] eat from Abraham's suffering you must
[1:21:22] fight it
[1:21:24] and what does God do God gives you a
[1:21:27] promise
[1:21:28] God speaks to you
[1:21:31] God gives you a position to defend
[1:21:34] God gives you a responsibility
[1:21:36] to execute
[1:21:41] we are in the church some people think
[1:21:43] well this is what I might get his
[1:21:45] business well well well well no sir
[1:21:50] we are all implicated
[1:21:52] we are all commanded
[1:21:55] to do what we are supposed to do
[1:21:58] there's no visitor here
[1:22:01] you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:22:04] invited by God
[1:22:07] to bring your contribution
[1:22:11] that is why
[1:22:14] Pastor Paul wrote to Philemon
[1:22:19] so I know about this is
[1:22:21] so put that on my account or but
[1:22:26] we hear about your love
[1:22:29] May
[1:22:32] your contribution
[1:22:34] be effectual
[1:22:38] that is not reaching to fill your head
[1:22:41] is reaching to provoke you
[1:22:44] is to it's written to to push you to get
[1:22:47] to work
[1:22:48] that's why it is written
[1:22:52] he said it say may your contribution
[1:22:58] you see the minister is not
[1:23:02] competition
[1:23:04] this one wants to preach so that they
[1:23:05] will know that he knows more he has more
[1:23:08] quotes and so this that's not the
[1:23:09] problem
[1:23:11] the ministry is is not competition it's
[1:23:14] contribution
[1:23:17] everybody has a contribution to make
[1:23:22] pair
[1:23:24] what God has told you
[1:23:26] don't say you're a woman you cannot
[1:23:28] don't say you have this color you cannot
[1:23:30] don't say because you're in Dallas you
[1:23:32] cannot my friend don't say because I'm
[1:23:35] not in my country well I'm just here I'm
[1:23:37] like no sir
[1:23:39] stop that you don't see that
[1:23:44] it's a matter of the general Body of
[1:23:47] Christ
[1:23:49] no matter where you find yourself
[1:23:52] no matter the country in which you are
[1:23:56] you're supposed to exercise the ministry
[1:23:59] that God has given you
[1:24:04] what does he say here
[1:24:09] whatever says
[1:24:11] but God has just begun
[1:24:14] to my humble opinion
[1:24:17] to adopting his sons
[1:24:20] positionally
[1:24:23] calling them out to one side
[1:24:27] giving them a certain Ministry
[1:24:31] anointing them for that purpose
[1:24:36] the purpose for which you are born is
[1:24:38] not the same for which I'm born
[1:24:41] the purpose that we are we are in for
[1:24:44] which we are in Dallas is not the same
[1:24:45] for all of us
[1:24:49] anointing them for that purpose
[1:24:52] and sending them out what what happened
[1:24:55] what happens when he does
[1:25:00] God has started calling them
[1:25:05] asking them to come
[1:25:07] he wants to dispatch them
[1:25:10] he wants to send them
[1:25:12] he wants to use them
[1:25:14] and you keep are you asking me already
[1:25:17] if I'm a woman do I have a Ministry it's
[1:25:19] all about preaching brother
[1:25:24] explains those things we have the court
[1:25:26] here he said you're a housewife it's a
[1:25:29] Ministry you are you are a doctor maybe
[1:25:32] it's your ministry maybe whatever is and
[1:25:36] he calls it a Ministry in Christ
[1:25:40] surprisingly you are a farmer
[1:25:45] is there I have the quote
[1:25:49] even because the Bible goes as far as
[1:25:53] teaching us that in the book of First
[1:25:56] God this is not to encourage the
[1:25:58] Pentecostal system but this is exactly
[1:26:01] what the Bible says it's not it's not
[1:26:03] the Pentecostal Bible it's our Bible
[1:26:06] and he sees here what does he say in
[1:26:09] First Corinthians chapter 12 what does
[1:26:12] he say here Clean and Clear he says
[1:26:25] um
[1:26:27] should have it somewhere
[1:26:31] verse there should be verse chapter 12
[1:26:34] verse 28 and God
[1:26:38] has set some in the church
[1:26:43] first apostles
[1:26:45] secondly Prophets
[1:26:48] deadly teachers
[1:26:50] after that
[1:26:53] miracles
[1:26:54] he has said some in the church
[1:26:59] then Gifts of gifts of healings
[1:27:04] helps
[1:27:06] all of us in the world help in the
[1:27:08] plural but I'm surprised this when he
[1:27:10] comes it helps
[1:27:13] am I seeing well that's it
[1:27:16] let's see it's not all governments
[1:27:20] diversities of tongues
[1:27:24] is not only
[1:27:26] I had the five-fold Ministries
[1:27:28] for people to make offense until they
[1:27:31] are the super people
[1:27:33] it's already they who are working for
[1:27:36] God the others are there to be clapping
[1:27:41] a lot I'm not accompanying anybody to
[1:27:44] have
[1:27:45] I'm I'm accomplishing
[1:27:48] my responsibilities as I'm going to that
[1:27:51] place because I don't want to be a
[1:27:55] worker of iniquity
[1:27:58] when you get to that place they'll ask
[1:28:01] you
[1:28:03] they ask you to do this you do not do it
[1:28:05] they ask you to do that what do you do
[1:28:11] they gave you instructions
[1:28:16] and gave you
[1:28:21] the rules
[1:28:23] they told you what to do
[1:28:25] there can be no traffic jam
[1:28:28] traffic jam between us were different
[1:28:33] everybody is different
[1:28:35] and we are different in our attributions
[1:28:39] we are different in our activities
[1:28:42] we are different the expectation of God
[1:28:46] for me is not the same as you
[1:28:51] what God wants to get from you it's not
[1:28:53] it's not my problem
[1:28:56] I cannot execute all of the word of God
[1:28:58] I can only do and do very well the work
[1:29:02] the job my job description as a servant
[1:29:07] of God you are a wife you are somebody's
[1:29:10] wife there is a job description for that
[1:29:14] responsibility
[1:29:18] you are a teacher there is a job this
[1:29:20] option for that
[1:29:23] I'm talking about your ministry not not
[1:29:26] my own I don't know what God has asked
[1:29:28] you to do helps is it helps governments
[1:29:35] and that is why the church is suffering
[1:29:39] because
[1:29:40] you may have the the necessary blessing
[1:29:44] that this man needs
[1:29:47] you see when you take your telephone and
[1:29:50] you are calling somebody who's next to
[1:29:52] you
[1:29:53] surprisingly that call first goes to the
[1:29:57] satellite goes right up there before he
[1:30:00] lands on that person next to you
[1:30:04] and that's how it happens in many of our
[1:30:06] churches
[1:30:08] because you have the blessings of
[1:30:11] somebody in your pocket
[1:30:15] you have the help of somebody in your
[1:30:18] hand you have something that God has
[1:30:21] asked you to do
[1:30:24] bless my brother McGary
[1:30:27] you have the money to support the work
[1:30:29] of God you are blessing him we are
[1:30:31] talking through the satellite
[1:30:35] when you satellite
[1:30:38] you know what you're supposed to do
[1:30:42] when you carry out your responsibility
[1:30:45] because it is your responsibility
[1:30:49] observe yourself
[1:30:51] there is something that you do
[1:30:53] that makes somebody happy
[1:30:56] and there are many other things that you
[1:30:58] are trying to do that bring confusion
[1:31:00] into your life
[1:31:03] because it's not your ministry
[1:31:05] it's not your job
[1:31:08] people have carried all take big big
[1:31:10] titles he's a doctor of the world he's
[1:31:13] the teacher he you you what do you
[1:31:15] encumber yourself
[1:31:18] why do you torment yourself that thing
[1:31:20] doesn't resemble you
[1:31:23] the prophet was preaching you better you
[1:31:25] take your broom and sweep this house
[1:31:27] perfectly you have the same salary like
[1:31:29] a pastor
[1:31:31] you don't need to you don't need to take
[1:31:34] off somebody which is not yours
[1:31:38] said don't be found as a murderer
[1:31:44] oh
[1:31:45] Peter I like that your text soon I like
[1:31:47] this device I love so much I use it in
[1:31:51] many situations
[1:31:54] first Peter again let me just read it I
[1:31:56] love it
[1:32:00] wasn't none of you suffer as a murderer
[1:32:04] or as a thief or as an evil Doer
[1:32:09] oh as a busy body
[1:32:14] in other men's
[1:32:16] matters
[1:32:19] it's not your matter
[1:32:21] you're not concerned
[1:32:23] what you are talking about it
[1:32:26] you are meddling in people's things
[1:32:30] in order mess is that your matter is
[1:32:32] that your job
[1:32:34] how many people appreciate you when you
[1:32:37] do what you're doing there
[1:32:39] are you at the right position
[1:32:46] yes my brother
[1:32:48] it's a challenge
[1:32:50] it's difficult for us to begin to see
[1:32:56] and if we go as far when we read the
[1:32:58] message is preaching about perfection
[1:33:02] and he's talking about the bride that
[1:33:04] has to pray and the dead will rise
[1:33:09] do you think our responsibility is a
[1:33:12] small one
[1:33:13] do you think we have been called for
[1:33:17] calling sick just to be here and be
[1:33:19] quoting
[1:33:22] your own Lord
[1:33:24] your own person
[1:33:26] how clean is it
[1:33:31] how well kept is it
[1:33:36] what you're supposed to do
[1:33:39] maybe nobody has ever challenged you
[1:33:42] well I'm here to challenge you
[1:33:45] or you think that because you are young
[1:33:47] you're a young man as you are
[1:33:50] but David was a young man
[1:33:53] maybe younger than you I put one message
[1:33:56] sometime David became king at the age of
[1:33:59] 30.
[1:34:01] read your Bible Well which means that
[1:34:03] all those great victories that David had
[1:34:07] he had them before 10
[1:34:09] was a child
[1:34:11] but he purposed
[1:34:13] ah somebody purposed in his mind
[1:34:17] his name was Daniel
[1:34:24] he told himself
[1:34:26] I'll do it
[1:34:30] if you think it's all about reading what
[1:34:32] brahavana said saying what barabalam did
[1:34:35] and whatever
[1:34:36] it's more than that
[1:34:39] it's more than that
[1:34:42] God is expecting
[1:34:45] a church
[1:34:48] which is Desiring
[1:34:50] to continue the ministry of William
[1:34:54] Branham
[1:34:57] your evil remain only at the level of

[1:35:23] literature
[1:35:26] and the Bible is clear the letter killed
[1:35:29] it

[1:36:30] divorce builds
[1:36:34] are removing the clothes from our
[1:36:37] children's bodies

[1:36:49] proud devils
[1:36:52] where are the sons and daughters of God

[1:36:59] churches
[1:37:01] the best we have in the message is you
[1:37:04] are like this I am like this you are
[1:37:07] like this condemning one another hatred
[1:37:10] the whole place everybody wants to prove
[1:37:12] to his congregation that I am better
[1:37:14] than that that's a long day
[1:37:19] go to our countries it is still we have
[1:37:22] great churches and great
[1:37:24] hatred

[1:37:32] you don't talk with brother one two
[1:37:35] three is somebody's name that is down
[1:37:37] and you are discussing the brother
[1:37:39] and you're speaking evil about you
[1:37:44] why is the church not strong
[1:37:48] because you are not people are not going
[1:37:50] about the business they are supposed to
[1:37:52] do
[1:37:53] if you are doing what you're supposed to
[1:37:55] do he's doing he's doing he's doing
[1:37:57] everybody is doing his own part of it
[1:37:59] the church will be strong
[1:38:04] I said strong
[1:38:07] your deep prayer it's not a Ministry
[1:38:12] that God can give a woman or a man
[1:38:15] Lord told my wife when she was young at
[1:38:19] some point they refused to send her to
[1:38:21] school so she got annoyed okay that
[1:38:23] she's going okay the answer to pray she
[1:38:25] will not she will not pray
[1:38:27] whoa they just presented her hair
[1:38:31] and showed her how they were
[1:38:34] moving people using some strong some
[1:38:38] kind of wreck or something and selling
[1:38:41] them there so you'll be one of them

[1:38:47] praise her I will not pray the winter
[1:38:49] showed her again
[1:38:52] to tell her that God
[1:38:55] was asking her to be a woman of Prayer
[1:39:00] now I I love I love what Samuel said
[1:39:04] Samuel said
[1:39:07] it is true you are spoken against me it
[1:39:11] is true you have you have you have
[1:39:14] is that also but
[1:39:17] God forbid
[1:39:19] that I stop praying for you
[1:39:24] it's my job
[1:39:26] you served me I pray for you don't
[1:39:27] deserve me I pray for you it's my job
[1:39:32] it's also a responsibility
[1:39:35] it's a Ministry
[1:39:37] you can change a lot of things in this
[1:39:40] church by your name but if I don't give
[1:39:42] a testimony of a boy and a girl he said
[1:39:45] if I have every any success I have here
[1:39:48] there are two people behind there who
[1:39:51] have been fasting and praying for me
[1:39:54] they didn't opt to come and be preaching
[1:39:56] with brother
[1:39:57] they said they sat and they're at their
[1:39:59] little spot there and they were making
[1:40:02] prayers and they were putting anointing
[1:40:04] and they were and whatever was moving
[1:40:06] and he knew you see they are praying for
[1:40:09] me
[1:40:13] oh I love your calm it's very important
[1:40:19] he said he has set
[1:40:21] you know what it means to set
[1:40:24] look at look at how these drums are set
[1:40:28] see how
[1:40:30] the organ or whatever all this
[1:40:32] everything here is set
[1:40:34] you're set
[1:40:37] in his church
[1:40:40] you come to America you enjoy the way
[1:40:43] things are set
[1:40:45] you go to the
[1:40:47] deepest part of America you see the
[1:40:50] houses they have their normal toilet the
[1:40:53] small restaurant the churches are well
[1:40:55] kept they follow all the principles set
[1:41:01] she had to set the light when they said
[1:41:03] they said stop you stop
[1:41:06] or eat this one body
[1:41:08] which has got disorder is the body of
[1:41:11] Christ
[1:41:12] I'm sorry to tell you
[1:41:15] people don't know
[1:41:17] where they are standing
[1:41:20] people don't know
[1:41:21] what role they are playing
[1:41:25] people don't know what contribution God
[1:41:29] is expecting from them you don't know
[1:41:34] so the church you have all you see all
[1:41:36] of this is well said in America all the
[1:41:39] churches were set but your minds are not
[1:41:41] well set
[1:41:44] sorry to say that
[1:41:47] the reason is simple
[1:41:49] if we were all of us were well sick
[1:41:52] and we know very well that sister this
[1:41:55] has got a special gift of healing for
[1:41:58] example
[1:42:00] this brother has got special Financial
[1:42:03] blessing
[1:42:04] there are things we
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:08] the person knows
[1:42:10] that when I desire something
[1:42:13] excuse me in this light I know the
[1:42:16] person to talk to
[1:42:17] when their sisters a situation like this
[1:42:20] we know who can always easily easily
[1:42:22] carry out the responsibility
[1:42:25] you know
[1:42:27] but this resembles him God has given him
[1:42:29] the means to do that
[1:42:31] if I support our prayer I know in my
[1:42:34] various churches who is the prayer
[1:42:36] Warrior who are The Prayer Warriors I
[1:42:38] know them
[1:42:39] I don't come about and say brother I
[1:42:41] need some special prayers no I call one
[1:42:44] two three I know that those are the
[1:42:47] people once you call them and they go on
[1:42:49] their knees God listens to them
[1:42:52] because it's their job
[1:42:55] is the responsibility
[1:43:01] those who are there to receive messages
[1:43:03] from God
[1:43:05] We Are Spiritual Church after everything
[1:43:07] eh
[1:43:09] following the message you have Pillar of
[1:43:11] Fire
[1:43:12] it's not a simple thing it's God himself
[1:43:14] in the church
[1:43:15] and you're standing there
[1:43:17] so we Are Spiritual Church
[1:43:19] we don't undermine those things
[1:43:22] because God speaks continues to speak
[1:43:26] God has not abandoned the church to
[1:43:28] itself
[1:43:31] is still active and he wants to carry
[1:43:34] out his work
[1:43:36] but
[1:43:38] if you're a coach
[1:43:40] just imagine
[1:43:42] I don't know you will play What football
[1:43:45] here we play soccer a lot of soccer
[1:43:46] that's what I know about you are the
[1:43:49] coach of the team
[1:43:51] and in the game you know the person who
[1:43:54] give you the goal or the goals you know
[1:43:57] that in this my team this is my this is
[1:43:59] my Joker
[1:44:03] how you place him there you place this
[1:44:06] one day you place a coach the job of the
[1:44:09] coach is to please his people where they
[1:44:13] can
[1:44:14] deliver the goods
[1:44:17] where they can bring the success into
[1:44:19] the camp
[1:44:22] when the gay man who is supposed to
[1:44:24] deliver this is soccer this is not a I
[1:44:26] don't know you're very used to your
[1:44:27] football here which I don't understand
[1:44:29] that your own is complicated
[1:44:32] but this is soccer
[1:44:34] in soccer you always have the ninth
[1:44:38] yes
[1:44:39] when they give you that nine jersey it
[1:44:42] means that all of our hope is on you to
[1:44:44] put
[1:44:47] so no matter what you're playing
[1:44:48] everybody is directing the ball towards
[1:44:51] the the master I will not call any names
[1:44:53] here but some of you follow football you
[1:44:55] know what I'm talking about you know the
[1:44:57] Mastermind the man who knows his only
[1:45:00] thing the only thing he has God in his
[1:45:01] head I want to enter that goal I want to
[1:45:03] deal with
[1:45:05] cannot be
[1:45:08] at the back I want to go and put a goal
[1:45:14] so if the coach
[1:45:18] send the goalkeeper well you have to
[1:45:21] defend your post and you're running from
[1:45:24] Pillar To Post you're running for you
[1:45:27] abandon your post
[1:45:32] you expose your goalkeeper
[1:45:36] because you are not where you are
[1:45:37] supposed to be you are even jealous
[1:45:39] because each time there is a girl you
[1:45:41] saw the name of the person who made it
[1:45:44] exactly like in the day of of David
[1:45:48] he put the goal but he did not put the
[1:45:51] goal for himself he put it for Israel
[1:45:55] the work he did brought honor and glory
[1:45:58] to the entire Kingdom
[1:46:02] but the King was jealous
[1:46:06] you are not the you are not the you are
[1:46:08] not the one to do everything
[1:46:11] you're not a Superman
[1:46:14] God has placed other people to carry out
[1:46:18] various responsibilities
[1:46:23] and you have to tell them
[1:46:26] and don't forget you are accountable
[1:46:30] you will pay your render account for
[1:46:33] what you are supposed to do and you
[1:46:35] didn't do it
[1:46:38] oh I believe the message
[1:46:41] the message
[1:46:45] and so I love the story of of of of of
[1:46:48] of of Daniel
[1:46:51] he read the books the the the the books
[1:46:55] of pastor Pastor Jeremiah
[1:47:00] Jeremiah prophesied prophesied
[1:47:03] prophesied
[1:47:04] when the time came he took upon himself
[1:47:08] I said no you know the matter of
[1:47:11] Jeremiah I said but I was saying
[1:47:13] something today about this a lot
[1:47:16] it's a lot of some work for every
[1:47:18] generation I heard something like that
[1:47:20] is it correct said to every generation
[1:47:24] he said something like that got a lot a
[1:47:27] word
[1:47:31] to every
[1:47:33] period
[1:47:35] there is something that you have to do
[1:47:37] and all those living in that period have
[1:47:40] their role different roles to pray for
[1:47:42] the accomplishment of what God has said
[1:47:46] and you're one of them
[1:47:48] living in this critical moment
[1:47:51] where the third wall where bombs are
[1:47:55] moving around the place
[1:47:57] under normal circumstances the church
[1:48:00] has to be on its knees and everybody on
[1:48:04] position
[1:48:07] because the battle is strong
[1:48:10] our enemy the Bible says when the devil
[1:48:15] raises as a storm Rises as a storm God
[1:48:19] something like that he says
[1:48:22] God raises
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:29] I say you
[1:48:31] you are the standard
[1:48:34] you are the people
[1:48:37] who are supposed to give meaning to the
[1:48:39] message
[1:48:44] we love you when you as you know it very
[1:48:47] we are happy
[1:48:48] you read it
[1:48:51] you meditate it
[1:48:53] some have gone as far as saying that
[1:48:55] they won't don't want to listen to
[1:48:57] preachers they don't want anything my
[1:48:59] friend
[1:49:00] so the only Ministry
[1:49:02] that is remaining now is just listening
[1:49:06] if that's all that we have to do
[1:49:08] the word we can what we congregate
[1:49:12] it's not possible
[1:49:16] faith
[1:49:17] comment by hearing
[1:49:21] the world not the world not the word of
[1:49:24] Christ Christ means Spirit revelation
[1:49:27] was saying in the morning
[1:49:32] and where are the men of God
[1:49:35] where are the preachers doing their job
[1:49:39] where are the Christians saying pastor
[1:49:42] stop that's my charge
[1:49:44] that's my program
[1:49:46] you can understand this when brother was
[1:49:50] preaching someday ah 6 45 I'll be on
[1:49:53] time
[1:49:54] who I preaching once someday and he was
[1:49:56] preaching
[1:49:57] there was a woman seated somewhere
[1:50:00] and that woman was got laid upon her to
[1:50:05] pray for a certain child
[1:50:08] I should start there
[1:50:10] free footage
[1:50:12] prayers
[1:50:17] this one is breaking praying for that
[1:50:19] child
[1:50:22] she goes to a point where she could no
[1:50:24] longer bear the pressure of the voice so
[1:50:28] she said Madam sister can I pray for
[1:50:30] your child
[1:50:32] so you go ahead and she prayed and the
[1:50:35] child go well instantly
[1:50:37] was in front I would say there's a woman
[1:50:40] there
[1:50:42] this is what happened what what what
[1:50:43] what happened
[1:50:46] so they tell you A woman has nothing to
[1:50:49] do nothing to do a woman
[1:50:52] can have a gift of healing all those
[1:50:55] gifts are possible those nine gifts that
[1:50:57] God can give to anybody
[1:50:59] this is the sacred place where we cannot
[1:51:01] admit a woman to stand here to talk to
[1:51:04] us
[1:51:05] but there's so many things
[1:51:08] that great women have done in the Bible
[1:51:12] I said great women
[1:51:17] there was a woman this Sunnah my woman
[1:51:20] saw the prophet coming and it
[1:51:24] bothered her
[1:51:26] to see that this man of God had to go
[1:51:28] from hotel to hotel coming to the town
[1:51:31] he's going to places eating small
[1:51:33] restaurant and whatever
[1:51:36] she told her husband
[1:51:38] let's find a place for this man
[1:51:42] she did it the husband said yes and you
[1:51:45] know the story I cannot I cannot talk
[1:51:47] too much about that
[1:51:49] then
[1:51:52] the day the prophet wanted to thank her
[1:51:56] or to say something good to her
[1:51:59] they did not call on the husband to show
[1:52:02] up
[1:52:04] they did not say call that couple we
[1:52:06] want to know they call that woman
[1:52:11] she was the one who was invited
[1:52:14] and she stood at the door
[1:52:17] excuse me and they told her you
[1:52:22] next year you will carry a baby you
[1:52:25] it was the product
[1:52:28] of her feet
[1:52:31] it was
[1:52:34] the grace that she received because she
[1:52:36] did what was correct what she was
[1:52:39] supposed to do
[1:52:41] read your Bible very well what happened
[1:52:43] to Dorcas this wonderful woman
[1:52:47] giving clothes helping supporting she
[1:52:52] will not say well all the brothers in
[1:52:54] the church who are problems he does the
[1:52:56] one of the pastor she was a woman
[1:52:58] observing how the sister is coming to
[1:53:01] church one pair of shoes all this while
[1:53:03] look at the other sister she doesn't
[1:53:05] have any dresses
[1:53:07] give to this shoe give to give
[1:53:11] and she died
[1:53:13] and the people said oh God
[1:53:16] she will not be buried
[1:53:20] I want to remind you your works
[1:53:23] will speak for you one day
[1:53:28] the things that
[1:53:33] trouble
[1:53:35] no Lord
[1:53:38] Somebody went as far as reminding God
[1:53:41] you cannot kill me
[1:53:43] I've done my job
[1:53:45] you're not kill me
[1:53:47] go and tell him that he's going to die
[1:53:49] you are going to diagnose his sister
[1:53:55] no God you cannot
[1:53:58] did he win the case
[1:54:01] did he win the case
[1:54:03] God said well I have no choice
[1:54:07] this man is correct
[1:54:10] he has been faithful
[1:54:12] he has done what he's supposed to do
[1:54:14] he has carried out his responsibility
[1:54:16] he will not die adding 15 years the same
[1:54:19] God who said you will die same God
[1:54:22] in the face in the face of
[1:54:26] the realities of what he has done
[1:54:30] put that sentence down we will keep we
[1:54:32] postpone it
[1:54:33] that one is he has won the case against
[1:54:35] me
[1:54:38] and here you are
[1:54:41] let me tell you we love brothers and
[1:54:43] sisters somebody said in the Bible I
[1:54:46] used to see uh when we go back at home
[1:54:49] you write the right when somebody's dead
[1:54:52] they write the program of the burial and
[1:54:54] the right under he has fought a good
[1:54:56] fight
[1:54:57] so so he don't worry about him he's
[1:55:00] going to heaven which fight did he fight
[1:55:06] because you want to please him
[1:55:09] the man
[1:55:10] who wrote that he has fought a good
[1:55:13] fight actually fought a good fight
[1:55:18] listen Paul was testifying himself
[1:55:24] I'm sorry to tell you Paul was
[1:55:26] testifying himself
[1:55:29] Samuel told the people of Israel say you
[1:55:34] who
[1:55:36] can stand
[1:55:37] to see that I have taken his wife I have
[1:55:41] taken his goat his what
[1:55:44] look at some point you must give account
[1:55:47] of what you have done with your life

[1:55:57] judgment already here you'll give it
[1:56:01] spend your money anyhow you live anyhow

[1:56:06] blocked

[1:56:10] account
[1:56:11] nobody can testify you more than

[2:02:37] if God decides to bless you he can bless
[2:02:40] you anywhere anyhow
[2:02:43] when he knows that is my son understands
[2:02:46] why I'm going to give him money
[2:02:50] he understands why I'm putting all these
[2:02:53] dollars in his pocket
[2:02:56] not for his glory
[2:02:58] not for his honor
[2:03:00] but for the advancement
[2:03:02] of the kingdom of God
[2:03:05] and he says there is no Ministry for
[2:03:08] your good only for you is for the common
[2:03:11] good
[2:03:12] is for the people
[2:03:15] how many people are happy because of you
[2:03:18] how many faces have you put a smile on
[2:03:21] in your life
[2:03:24] how many people are glad because you
[2:03:27] exist
[2:03:30] when you pass
[2:03:31] many people praise God because you're on
[2:03:34] this Earth how many
[2:03:36] you are indifferent to people you are
[2:03:39] wicked you you just live anyhow
[2:03:42] you want God you but when I said at some
[2:03:45] point that if the pastor is happy
[2:03:47] God who is happy
[2:03:49] is that not very strong
[2:03:51] but if even the pastor doesn't
[2:03:53] appreciate you
[2:03:58] where are you what are you worth
[2:04:01] what are you doing
[2:04:03] what will I do in the question is what I
[2:04:06] do on Earth
[2:04:08] right here
[2:04:11] why are you here
[2:04:14] Jesus came he knew why he was here
[2:04:17] he lived for that
[2:04:19] Daniel knew why he was here he
[2:04:22] sacrificed the meat of Babylon he
[2:04:24] sacrificed the wine of Babylon he
[2:04:27] sacrificed he knew that I'm here because
[2:04:30] I'm supposed to prepare the going back
[2:04:32] of these people to that back to our land
[2:04:35] and because of that purpose that he had
[2:04:39] in his mind God looked at this this man
[2:04:42] marries and a visit from heaven
[2:04:44] and just also go and visit him
[2:04:47] and he visited him
[2:04:49] God will visit you
[2:04:52] when you do what you're supposed to do
[2:04:54] God will bless you Sister
[2:04:57] when you are executing to the letter
[2:05:01] your job performance what you're
[2:05:03] supposed to do
[2:05:04] and there is no there is no traffic you
[2:05:07] and me can never have any competition
[2:05:09] because everybody has got his own share
[2:05:13] and a definition of exactly what God is
[2:05:17] expecting from him
[2:05:21] I'm talking about you
[2:05:24] that's why today we are there's a lot of

[2:07:14] appoint somebody here in in whatever
[2:07:18] thing in Dallas all of Dallas will hear
[2:07:20] about it everybody would like to go and
[2:07:22] meet him and give him a handshake
[2:07:24] you you think that the appointment of
[2:07:28] God
[2:07:29] is the one that you have to to minimize
[2:07:32] you have to to to to to to to look down
[2:07:35] on you have to to to
[2:07:38] to refuse to consider
[2:07:40] you think to be an elect of God it's a
[2:07:45] position that you can buy
[2:07:50] it's only the blood of Jesus
[2:07:54] that has made you what you are for you
[2:07:57] to be what you are God himself have to
[2:08:00] climb on the cross God himself
[2:08:03] to give you a position
[2:08:04] [Applause]
[2:08:07] God
[2:08:08] himself
[2:08:10] because of you as he was climbing he was
[2:08:13] calling your name
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:15] he was calling your name
[2:08:18] when you become a Christian you think
[2:08:21] is the list of a position that a man can
[2:08:24] occupy some of you think being
[2:08:26] Christians is just something that you do
[2:08:29] because you lost
[2:08:31] you have nothing to do in life
[2:08:35] I have seen in my country some people
[2:08:38] they are fighting to be pastors fighting
[2:08:40] to be Apostle fighting because that's
[2:08:43] where they want they will have their own
[2:08:44] Glory
[2:08:46] all night since in the world nobody's
[2:08:50] seeing me after business nothing have
[2:08:53] done politics nothing so and now I just
[2:08:56] infiltrated
[2:08:59] and then I am I'm in every election in
[2:09:03] the church senior uh
[2:09:07] this advice out to the pastor this and
[2:09:10] there are four star in front at least
[2:09:13] I'm feeling that I'm something now
[2:09:17] he feels that is something
[2:09:19] because people are clapping
[2:09:22] you think that God
[2:09:25] Jehovah
[2:09:26] takes the Pains of calling you my son
[2:09:31] God the creator of Heaven and Earth
[2:09:35] gives you a position
[2:09:40] we were saying it yesterday
[2:09:43] down in Altus
[2:09:46] the position that you are fighting for
[2:09:48] Moses abandoned them
[2:09:51] because Moses knew that his position
[2:09:54] was not in this house
[2:09:57] with these beautiful women
[2:10:00] naked
[2:10:01] every one of them wants me to get
[2:10:03] married to her
[2:10:04] my name is Moses
[2:10:06] this doesn't resemble me this is not my
[2:10:09] Ministry
[2:10:11] being the son of pharaoh is not my
[2:10:14] Ministry
[2:10:18] the Bible says he considered
[2:10:21] a better position to suffer with no
[2:10:24] slaves out there
[2:10:27] than to remain
[2:10:29] in the glory of Egypt
[2:10:32] with the sin
[2:10:34] for a short time
[2:10:35] it's for a season I would use this for a
[2:10:37] season
[2:10:39] one day somebody was bearing another one
[2:10:42] it was a barrier somewhere and somebody
[2:10:45] said something interesting he said
[2:10:47] he said you see when two people are
[2:10:49] talking they say do you know who I am
[2:10:51] hey they challenge me he said just wait
[2:10:53] I'll show you who you are
[2:10:56] he went down somewhere and picked some
[2:10:58] ground and this is what you asked
[2:11:02] that's what you are
[2:11:04] dust
[2:11:06] you know where I am
[2:11:08] but don't try that with a Christian
[2:11:11] because it's covered by the blood of
[2:11:13] Jesus
[2:11:14] in Africa people take names of other
[2:11:17] people to go to witch doctors
[2:11:19] to go and make charms against them to do
[2:11:22] evil against them
[2:11:24] but be careful
[2:11:26] don't call the name of a Christian
[2:11:28] once you call the name of the Christian
[2:11:30] the
[2:11:32] tell you what have you done
[2:11:38] this is blood Hallelujah the honest is
[2:11:41] blood
[2:11:42] can we clap for Jesus Christ
[2:11:45] the blood of Jesus
[2:11:48] I say the blood of Jesus
[2:11:51] my friend

[2:11:57] you are blessed and when you are in the
[2:12:00] line of duty simple understand there is
[2:12:04] an angel standing by you
[2:12:07] I want to hear better amen
[2:12:10] another amen
[2:12:12] the angel of the Lord comforted by those
[2:12:18] who fear God
[2:12:22] and we see the American president is
[2:12:25] going somewhere motor kid motor kid
[2:12:27] motor kid soldiers bombs guns everywhere

[2:12:44] you know what an angel is
[2:12:46] go and ask those those syrians when they
[2:12:49] came fighting
[2:12:51] Israel
[2:12:53] and the colonists today with all his
[2:12:55] guns and his ammunition and everything
[2:12:58] and the angel told him
[2:13:03] a true story
[2:13:05] the war 1967.
[2:13:08] and when you went back somebody asked
[2:13:10] him how did you retreat with all these
[2:13:14] soldiers that you had he said my friend
[2:13:16] what I saw
[2:13:19] what I saw you asked me to continue I
[2:13:22] saw an angel
[2:13:23] starting with this one
[2:13:28] that same position is your position
[2:13:34] every devil fighting you will see the
[2:13:37] angel of the Lord

[2:13:44] entering into your business

[2:18:20] Let the church feel the effect of your
[2:18:23] Christianity that's the recommendation
[2:18:26] Paul was giving Philemon but God wrote
[2:18:29] it in the Bible so it becomes your
[2:18:31] recommendation too
[2:18:33] it applies to you
[2:18:35] it applies to you
[2:18:37] and I repeat as I'm going to end how
[2:18:40] many people are happy because you're on
[2:18:42] this Earth how many
[2:18:43] how many tell me
[2:18:46] how many people are joyful because they
[2:18:49] see you
[2:18:51] if they hear that you are sick how many
[2:18:53] people are they playing Lord he's so
[2:18:55] good to me he's such a nice man he's a
[2:18:58] wonderful person let him not die
[2:19:02] but if you're alive
[2:19:04] is Tainted with wickedness right
[2:19:11] that fool let him go
[2:19:14] [Music]
[2:19:18] you see there are names that when they
[2:19:20] call in church people are spontaneous in
[2:19:22] their in their reaction
[2:19:26] you say well that one does he come to
[2:19:28] church you see a brother he's a
[2:19:31] Christian
[2:19:32] but they're people
[2:19:34] whose testimonies
[2:19:37] within us
[2:19:39] amongst us I saw that we don't play with
[2:19:41] them
[2:19:42] at some point they begin to say oh
[2:19:44] Pastor is showing favoritism no it's not
[2:19:47] favoritism
[2:19:48] it's simply that this man's works
[2:19:52] his life
[2:19:54] he
[2:19:55] doing so well
[2:19:59] I was talking to we're talking about uh
[2:20:02] what are Moses we're talking a while ago
[2:20:05] about
[2:20:06] the the pastor's wife and what did you
[2:20:10] not tell me I was so happy
[2:20:12] for our testimony great things
[2:20:15] there are people
[2:20:17] whose perfume you like to smell
[2:20:20] and whose presence you like to be with
[2:20:23] their people even when you see them from
[2:20:25] a distance you disappear
[2:20:28] because once you meet the understand
[2:20:30] those the whole stories did we hear
[2:20:32] again uh London went to Paris Paris was
[2:20:36] how was that they Define me
[2:20:40] he said a Ministry
[2:20:42] this woman who came to barabbana shot
[2:20:44] and said after the meeting she completed
[2:20:47] she said oh thank you thank you thank
[2:20:50] you for what
[2:20:52] yes what's all this thanking me for
[2:20:55] he said she is the greatest gossiper
[2:20:59] in the neighborhood
[2:21:02] she thanked you because you did not
[2:21:04] touch her in the course of the preaching
[2:21:09] let me tell you people know you
[2:21:12] don't don't think that as you're walking
[2:21:15] around people don't know you they know
[2:21:17] you you don't even need to talk just the
[2:21:19] way you are walking people know you
[2:21:23] the way you live your life people know
[2:21:25] you
[2:21:27] and the life of Philemon
[2:21:29] Paul knew about it
[2:21:31] I've heard we know about the love that
[2:21:35] you are manifesting towards the
[2:21:36] Christian I can ask you a favor please
[2:21:39] if this man owes you
[2:21:41] put it on my account
[2:21:44] Paul was not only dealing spirituality
[2:21:47] with people he was also dealing with
[2:21:49] money
[2:21:50] with his quote whatever things he was
[2:21:53] doing it
[2:21:54] John wrote he said I've heard about this
[2:21:57] other man on a scene or whatever that
[2:21:59] man was see and your trip or whatever so
[2:22:03] we know
[2:22:04] we know
[2:22:05] he's the one blocking the burden when
[2:22:07] they want to come to that church we know
[2:22:10] foreign
[2:22:20] she blocks me bad testimony
[2:22:23] sorry
[2:22:25] their names are there
[2:22:26] he said I will not go again with with
[2:22:29] Barnabas because with the John John Mark
[2:22:32] somebody right because he abandoned us
[2:22:35] somebody because of the love of the
[2:22:37] world they know
[2:22:38] their names are there
[2:22:40] now it is not the past in reality we
[2:22:43] have those same people again in the
[2:22:45] church
[2:22:46] who are disturbing the work of God
[2:22:49] who are
[2:22:51] slowing down the activities of the
[2:22:53] spirit
[2:22:55] they refuse
[2:22:57] to do their work
[2:22:59] they refuse to carry out their
[2:23:01] responsibility
[2:23:03] and they want to do some other thing
[2:23:06] you go nowhere with that
[2:23:09] God will not bless you

[2:28:23] we have seen in churches full rise get
[2:28:26] up and say you Pastor I don't agree with
[2:28:28] you
[2:28:30] when they're dead
[2:28:31] with emergency
[2:28:34] you're dead
[2:28:35] I've seen things that I cannot describe
[2:28:37] to you
[2:28:38] just somebody gets up and all of a
[2:28:41] sudden he wants to challenge the pastor
[2:28:43] he's speaking against the pastor he
[2:28:45] thinks he's the only one it's in the
[2:28:47] Bible
[2:28:50] [Applause]
[2:28:54] is he the only one sir it's not your job
[2:28:59] keep away from this man his name is
[2:29:02] Moses keep away
[2:29:04] even he his own brother
[2:29:11] what is he thinking what is not your job
[2:29:14] and God described to them who Moses was
[2:29:17] saying you there's two of you when I
[2:29:19] want to talk to you I use a dream I can
[2:29:22] talk in a vision for this one when I'm
[2:29:24] talking to him I take a representation
[2:29:26] and I talk to him face to face
[2:29:30] how do you mix yourself in things that
[2:29:33] don't concern you
[2:29:34] you know the relationship between God
[2:29:37] and Moses you know
[2:29:41] you know how far they have gone to get
[2:29:43] to this point that they are
[2:29:45] do you know how far this gentleman has
[2:29:49] gone to where you are and where you are
[2:29:51] continue and you are going you just come
[2:29:53] from nowhere
[2:29:55] you're just eating his name or whatever
[2:29:59] discussing talking
[2:30:02] you don't know what you're saying
[2:30:04] why'd you meddle in other people's
[2:30:06] business is that your business
[2:30:09] does it concern you
[2:30:11] do your part
[2:30:13] play your role
[2:30:14] God will bless you
[2:30:16] [Music]
[2:30:19] once more may God bless all of you
[2:30:22] we want to see a church where everybody
[2:30:24] is doing his own part
[2:30:27] everything anything you can do reveal to
[2:30:31] you for the advancement of the work of
[2:30:33] God do it
[2:30:34] and may God bless you in Jesus name
[2:30:37] shalom
[2:30:38] [Applause]
[2:30:46] amen
[2:30:49] you know I like the gospel
[2:30:51] that puts flesh on the word
[2:30:54] amen because that's that's really
[2:30:57] what it's all about isn't it is the word
[2:31:00] being made flesh and it's good to hear
[2:31:03] the way that the work can be made flesh
[2:31:05] it just come on my heart so much when uh
[2:31:08] he was talking you know
[2:31:12] you talk about
[2:31:14] things that are great in the scripture
[2:31:17] Paul's going about doing his way of Duty
[2:31:20] right he thinks he's going to go put all
[2:31:22] these Heretics
[2:31:24] in prison
[2:31:25] where they belong and just so happens on
[2:31:28] the way there
[2:31:29] he meets the angel of the Lord
[2:31:32] and he says who are he says you know I'm
[2:31:35] Jesus who you persecute you know and
[2:31:37] Paul was struck blind you know that
[2:31:39] right and he was taken over to Damascus
[2:31:43] and so because that's where he was
[2:31:45] headed so he's sitting in Damascus blind
[2:31:49] not talking not eating
[2:31:52] right and then the Lord goes to talk to
[2:31:56] ananias
[2:31:58] you know and ananias was just a disciple
[2:32:02] you know what I mean and I I love the
[2:32:05] story uh because uh the scripture says
[2:32:10] and there was a certain disciple at
[2:32:13] Damascus team ananias
[2:32:15] and to him said the Lord in the vision
[2:32:19] ananias and he said behold I'm here Lord
[2:32:23] he said the Lord said unto him arise and
[2:32:26] go into the street which is called
[2:32:28] straight and inquire in the house of
[2:32:31] Judas of one called Saul of Tarsus for
[2:32:36] behold he prayeth
[2:32:38] and he hath seen a vision a man named
[2:32:43] ananias coming in and putting his hand
[2:32:47] on him that he might receive his sight
[2:32:50] here's God working on both ends right
[2:32:52] and ananias said Lord I have heard by
[2:32:55] many of this man
[2:32:58] how much evil he hath done
[2:33:02] to the Saints at Jerusalem
[2:33:05] and and here he hath Authority from the
[2:33:10] chief priest to bind all that call on
[2:33:13] thy name
[2:33:15] and this is a great story
[2:33:17] but the Lord said unto him go thy way
[2:33:22] for he is chosen vessel unto me to Bear
[2:33:27] my name before the Gentiles and Kings
[2:33:31] and the children of Israel for I will
[2:33:34] show him
[2:33:36] how great things he must suffer for my
[2:33:41] namesake
[2:33:43] amen you know and then I thought because
[2:33:47] this has been
[2:33:49] in my Bible for days and days it says
[2:33:53] this it says you've got something to do
[2:33:57] God's got something for you to do
[2:34:02] hmm
[2:34:05] you know what message that's out of
[2:34:09] three kinds of believers
[2:34:13] the real believer puts the word in flesh
[2:34:19] the Nate believer keeps it intellectual
[2:34:23] the unbeliever doesn't listen to it at
[2:34:26] all
[2:34:32] I'll finish the paragraph
[2:34:35] you may have some heartaches
[2:34:37] and some troubles
[2:34:40] you must have some he he says you may
[2:34:43] have some disappointments
[2:34:46] but do we pray
[2:34:48] to shun them
[2:34:50] no
[2:34:52] Lord take me through them
[2:34:54] whatever they is
[2:34:56] whatever it is don't let me escape them
[2:35:02] if they're set for me just give me Grace
[2:35:06] to go through that that's all
[2:35:11] it's not easy to be a Christian yes but
[2:35:15] I'll tell you something there's no
[2:35:18] reward like it
[2:35:20] you cannot give God

[2:35:28] I can tell you I've put that to test
[2:35:31] thousands of times you can't out give

[2:35:45] things going
