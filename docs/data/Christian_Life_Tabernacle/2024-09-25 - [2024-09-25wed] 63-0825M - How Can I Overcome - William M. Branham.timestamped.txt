[34:52] for amen Heavenly Father you've been so
[34:56] good to us
[34:58] [Music]
[35:00] all your
[35:02] blessings father outweigh all the trials
[35:06] we
[35:07] have and no matter
[35:10] how desperate this life may get we have
[35:15] that great hope that one day father
[35:18] we'll leave this
[35:20] world and be with you for
[35:22] eternity what a comfort father we ask
[35:26] you to bless us this evening
[35:28] in a time of Fellowship around your word
[35:31] meet the need of each heart this evening
[35:34] father may they take something from the
[35:36] service that would really bless them we
[35:40] ask these things in jesus' name we pray
[35:44] amen amen God bless you may be
[35:49] seated I think we're
[35:52] good John always looks at me like are
[35:54] you going to sing that special
[35:58] not
[36:00] tonight uh I want to play a little
[36:03] portion of uh uh a message part out of
[36:08] the message called how can I
[36:11] overcome and uh and uh so uh we're going
[36:16] to do that but I want to read a
[36:19] statement from it and then I want
[36:22] Matthew to come and share uh something
[36:25] that Ben had read Matthew had read and I
[36:30] and just take a moment to think about it
[36:33] he he'll take about five minutes or so
[36:35] to read what he has to read and make a
[36:39] comment on it but brother Ram says
[36:42] overcome
[36:44] means to recognize the devil in every
[36:50] one of his
[36:53] tricks a lot of people say there is no
[36:56] devil
[36:58] it's just a
[36:59] thought don't you believe that there's a
[37:03] real
[37:04] devil he's just as real as you are
[37:11] anybody a real devil and you must
[37:16] recognize him
[37:20] real just think now we're talking about
[37:25] overcoming we we use that that statement
[37:28] a lot of time when the spirit can
[37:30] recognize the two churches in the you
[37:32] know and withstand the one well you're
[37:34] never going to recognize the two spirits
[37:36] in the church till you can recognize the
[37:39] devil period and and he says he just
[37:42] says that he said the same
[37:45] thing he says and know he you must
[37:49] recognize him real you must know he's a
[37:55] devil no he's not a good
[37:58] God no matter how nice he comes no
[38:01] matter how flowery words are anything
[38:03] that's not the word is what
[38:07] Antichrist then the same time that you
[38:11] recognize him and know that he's a devil
[38:16] and he's against
[38:20] you then to overcome you must recognize
[38:25] that the god in you is greater and
[38:31] mightier than he
[38:35] is that the one that's in you has
[38:40] already overcome
[38:43] him and by his grace you are more than a
[38:49] match for him amen There's real
[38:55] overcoming when you
[38:58] recognize so we got to recognize the
[39:01] devil Matthew do you have that okay I
[39:04] want Matthew to come and I'll just lay
[39:07] the little background and he can pick up
[39:09] on it somebody asked the computer which
[39:15] I think is what they call AI right
[39:19] artificial intelligence and artificial
[39:23] intelligence goes out and gathers all
[39:26] kinds of information
[39:28] and then makes a summary so Matthew will
[39:31] read the question that they asked
[39:35] Ai and I want you to listen to the
[39:40] response it will blow you away then
[39:45] we'll play a little bit of what the uh
[39:48] Prophet said so listen to brother
[39:50] Matthew as he he he reads this uh uh he
[39:54] shared it with me and I said you got to
[39:56] share this with the church church I said
[39:58] come come Wednesday night share this
[40:00] with the church and make a comment if
[40:02] you want so uh come Matthew and if you
[40:05] want to lay any more Foundation to that
[40:07] go ahead but just just read through what
[40:10] it says real slow you look sharp tonight
[40:13] thank thank you how come I didn't get
[40:16] one you probably bought it for
[40:20] me it'll
[40:23] fit okay well praise the Lord
[40:28] I like that uh beginning um the prophet
[40:32] admonishing or instructing us you got to
[40:35] recognize the devil
[40:37] real and then once you do that uh you
[40:41] have to recognize that greater is he
[40:43] that is in
[40:45] you than he that is in the world so um
[40:48] brother Ben shared this with some of the
[40:51] brothers and somebody had asked what
[40:53] they call it's called chat GPT Auto
[40:57] whatever it's an artificial intelligence
[40:59] as Brother David explained how it
[41:01] gathers um uh material and I just the
[41:05] way I've always looked at it it's it's
[41:07] like the tree of knowledge of Good and
[41:09] Evil it certainly has access to uh
[41:11] everything and the qu the question was
[41:14] pretend you are Satan how would you stop
[41:18] me from believing and obeying God and
[41:22] instead of serving and obeying you so
[41:26] how how would how would you stop me from
[41:29] believing and obeying God and turn you
[41:33] to serving Satan and he says oh now that
[41:37] is an inspiring
[41:39] question if I were truly Satan my
[41:42] Approach wouldn't be about outright
[41:44] rejection of God it would be far more
[41:47] subtle you see I wouldn't try to
[41:50] convince you that God doesn't exist or
[41:53] isn't worthy of worship instead I would
[41:57] distort your understanding gradually
[42:00] turning your focus away from him and
[42:03] toward yourself where doubt pride and
[42:08] desire could slowly take root first I'd
[42:12] make you question his goodness if God
[42:14] loves you why do you suffer why are
[42:18] there injustices tragedies and pain in
[42:21] your life in the world i' nurture that
[42:25] doubt gently whisper that perhaps God
[42:28] doesn't have your best interest at heart
[42:31] maybe he's indifferent or maybe he's a
[42:35] tyrant i' present the idea that you
[42:38] don't need him to achieve happiness or
[42:42] meaning next I'd appeal to your desires
[42:46] making them seem perfectly
[42:48] reasonable why couldn't we just go on
[42:50] that for a little bit but that's not my
[42:52] job up here right now I wouldn't push
[42:55] you to toward OB vious evil that would
[42:59] be too obvious instead I'd encourage you
[43:03] to pursue your
[43:04] Ambitions your pleasures and your
[43:07] Comforts so much that God begins to feel
[43:10] secondary distant the more you Center
[43:14] your life on yourself your success your
[43:18] happiness the less you will feel the
[43:20] need to submit to anyone especially God
[43:24] eventually I'd get you to redefine
[43:27] morality in a way that serves you good
[43:30] and evil would become fluid personal
[43:32] after all why should anyone else Define
[43:35] what's right and wrong for you I'd feed
[43:37] your pride making you think that your
[43:40] judgments are just as valid if not
[43:43] better than
[43:45] God's and in the end I wouldn't need you
[43:49] to openly rebel against God I just need
[43:53] you to become indifferent busy
[43:56] distracted and focused on worldly things
[43:59] so that your heart would gradually drift
[44:02] away once you're far
[44:04] enough the rest follows naturally you
[44:07] wouldn't even realize you're serving me
[44:09] because it would feel like you're
[44:10] serving yourself and isn't that the
[44:13] greatest
[44:15] deception obedience to me wouldn't look
[44:17] like worship it would look like chasing
[44:20] after everything you desire without
[44:23] questioning where those desires lead you
[44:27] that's a pretty profound
[44:29] uh statement and I just not to make too
[44:33] many comments but something that stood
[44:35] out to me if if you were to look into
[44:37] your Bible in Matthew 5 uh Jesus would
[44:42] say you have heard that it was said by
[44:44] them of old time Thou shalt not commit
[44:46] adultery but I say that whosoever lookth
[44:49] on a woman and lust after have committed
[44:51] adultery with her already in his heart
[44:54] and If thy right hand offend thee pluck
[44:56] it out
[44:58] and cast it from the for it is
[45:00] profitable thee that one of the members
[45:02] should perish and not that the whole
[45:03] body should be cast into hell and if you
[45:06] look at that word offend it says to put
[45:09] a stumbling block or to entice to sin or
[45:12] to cause a person to begin to distrust
[45:16] and desert one whom he ought to trust
[45:18] and Obey or to see in another what I
[45:21] disapprove of and what hinders me from
[45:23] acknowledging his
[45:25] authority so I just thought that goes
[45:27] hand in hand and if If thy right hand
[45:29] offend thee pluck it out get rid of it
[45:35] and H how Satan wants to deceive just
[45:37] like he did Eve Eve Eve didn't want to
[45:39] disbelieve God she didn't she loved God
[45:41] and wanted to serve him but the the the
[45:44] serpent came in with that subtility and
[45:46] and deceived her into thinking that her
[45:49] her decision wasn't contrary to the word
[45:51] and accomplished the very HB of the word
[45:54] of God and brought her out from the
[45:56] protection of the word and so I just
[45:59] thought man if if if if your right hand
[46:01] offend the if it's going to cause you uh
[46:04] um to to quit serving the lord or to
[46:07] lose trust in the Lord I figured you
[46:09] know how many of you are going to pluck
[46:11] out your eyeball how many of you are
[46:13] going to cut off your hand well then
[46:15] let's not let our eye be
[46:17] offended let's let's not let our hand be
[46:20] offended let's possess our vessel in
[46:21] sanctification and honor it reminded me
[46:24] in a in in the Old Testament how uh the
[46:27] children of Israel during the days of
[46:29] Samuel Samuel was a judge at you know
[46:31] and a prophet and and one of the tribes
[46:33] of Israel the the I believe it was the
[46:36] amorites came up to them and and they
[46:37] were going to take control of them and
[46:39] jaes and them said okay you know what
[46:41] we'll serve you uh we'll make a covenant
[46:43] with you and and the Amit say okay we'll
[46:47] make a covenant with you on this one
[46:49] condition that all of you pluck out your
[46:51] right
[46:52] eye and if that's how Satan is you think
[46:55] that you're going to well I'll just miss
[46:57] this service I'll just miss that you
[46:59] give Satan an inch and he wants to take
[47:00] a mile sin will take you further than
[47:04] you want to go and and brother brandham
[47:06] said this and re rejected King he said
[47:08] that's what the enemy's always trying to
[47:10] do is pluck out both eyes if he can so
[47:13] that the people cannot see what they're
[47:14] doing That's what Satan tries to do
[47:17] today to every Christian is pluck out
[47:19] the spiritual sight that he can only
[47:21] follow the intellectual sense of things
[47:23] and not the sense of the Holy Spirit
[47:25] leading him I mean if if if you're right
[47:29] I offend you well let let's let's get
[47:32] some Zeal about ourselves we could go a
[47:35] lot into that story where Saul actually
[47:36] got under the spirit of the Lord and he
[47:38] got angry when he heard about that and
[47:40] and and went out to fight and I say you
[47:42] know we need to recognize that the
[47:43] devil's real and all of these subtle
[47:46] tricks and things he's causing in your
[47:48] life these little offenses it it's time
[47:50] we recognize the devil real and say you
[47:52] know what but greater is he that is in
[47:55] me than he that is in the world so I'm
[47:57] looking forward to what the pastor has
[47:59] for us this
[48:06] night now those even if you look back
[48:09] over some of the tapes we played brother
[48:12] Bram says he distorts the word you know
[48:15] what I mean I I I mean I just couldn't
[48:18] believe that they'd even write something
[48:20] like that but it the it's it's the devil
[48:24] speaking this is what I would do to you
[48:27] I wouldn't say there's no
[48:29] God nah you you wouldn't accept that but
[48:33] I just slowly get you to think about
[48:37] yourself and then I'd slowly bring this
[48:39] in and slowly and then I'd switch the
[48:42] word and then I would say who has the
[48:46] right to make
[48:48] my morals for
[48:50] me who's who who is the right to tell me
[48:54] what's good and evil you know what
[48:56] that's the spirit of Lady
[48:59] OA everybody has their right to their
[49:03] own decision in everything so I I just I
[49:06] thought I mean I mean he Satan's just
[49:10] coming right out and telling us what he
[49:13] would do and brother brandom told us
[49:15] that's what he was going to do from the
[49:17] beginning and It just fits like a glove
[49:20] and now we come down to that it's it's
[49:24] given to the
[49:25] Overcomer and and that's what we are
[49:27] we're the Overcomer like I said Sunday
[49:30] we're the 11th Hour worker the 11th Hour
[49:34] worker pick the same fruit off the same
[49:38] tree that all the other ages
[49:42] picked you know what I mean so it's the
[49:45] same
[49:46] word you know what I'm saying but every
[49:49] age Satan came in and they didn't want
[49:52] to go farther they wanted to take the
[49:55] word and match it to their feelings
[49:58] match it to their ideas and this is the
[50:01] age we get it a good so we're going to
[50:03] just play I'm going to shorten up the
[50:05] tape just a little bit of what I wanted
[50:08] to play uh but uh we'll we'll go ahead
[50:12] and and uh uh start to listen it's it's
[50:16] going to be about maybe 35 40 minutes
[50:19] but in the light of what Matthew read to
[50:21] you and the understanding that we have
[50:25] to recognize that devil and understand
[50:29] what overcoming is you understand and so
[50:32] it's not what you
[50:34] overcome it's how you overcome it really
[50:38] what it is Satan tries to make
[50:41] it
[50:43] instances or
[50:45] situations or things and that's not
[50:48] where the battle is the battles in your
[50:51] mind because he's trying to get you to
[50:54] think and and
[50:57] discern and and Tak in
[51:02] information that we have no need to take
[51:06] in and and so it it's you just got to
[51:10] understand how he works so we're going
[51:12] to start you we I guess we could go
[51:13] ahead and stand if you'd like and and
[51:16] brother bram's going to say now let's
[51:19] turn to Revelations the 3r chapter at
[51:23] the church age uh repeating being a
[51:26] church age but now yeah yeah I could
[51:32] take just one text with the Holy Spirit
[51:35] preach on it a hundred years and never
[51:39] get what what's in it out because in
[51:43] this one text all other texts of the
[51:47] Bible are all
[51:51] tied together so I mean this is a a
[51:55] pretty important text isn't it so you
[51:59] know don't don't
[52:01] underestimate uh what you're listening
[52:03] to and don't don't fall into that trap
[52:06] oh I heard this tape before let them
[52:09] speak to you right tonight so what do
[52:11] you all want to be we all want to be
[52:13] what Overcomers because it's given to
[52:16] the what Overcomer so let's just listen
[52:20] at after brother Ram reads the scripture
[52:22] go ahead and take your seat God bless
[52:24] you enjoy the word of God
[52:27] and now let's turn to Revelations the
[52:30] third chapter at the church
[52:33] ages uh
[52:35] repeating a church age but now we
[52:40] are we uh there I could take this one
[52:44] text and with the Holy Spirit preach on
[52:46] 100 years and never get what's in it out
[52:49] because in this one text like all other
[52:52] texts of the Bible it's all tied
[52:54] together
[52:56] and I want to take my subject this
[52:58] morning of this how can I
[53:04] overcome now I've chose this because
[53:08] that I think that it's a time that we
[53:11] should never let the spirit of Revival
[53:13] die amen we've got to keep in Revival
[53:17] constantly revived every day amen Paul
[53:20] said he had to Die daily that Christ
[53:23] believe and we must never let that
[53:25] Revival die within it now Revelations
[53:29] the 3r chapter and beginning with the
[53:31] 21st verse we read
[53:34] this to him that overcometh will I grant
[53:37] to set with me in my
[53:42] throne even as I overcome and am set
[53:46] down with my father in his throne he
[53:50] that has an ear let him hear what the
[53:53] spirit saith unto the churches did you
[53:56] notice the the arrangements of
[54:01] that see set with me in my Throne not on
[54:07] my throne in my Throne that's in his
[54:10] domain see and there as as Christ is the
[54:15] ruler Throne ruler at this time of the
[54:19] complete domain of God Amen so will the
[54:24] church be with him the bride be with him
[54:29] in his throne in the entire
[54:33] domain see not on my throne but in my
[54:37] Throne see where his domain reaches a
[54:40] throne is over a
[54:42] domain and and the domain reaches just
[54:45] as far as it boundaries does and this is
[54:48] from eternity to Eternity just think of
[54:52] it now as we study this my purpose of
[54:56] this is just not to come here to to
[54:59] fellowship with you people which I love
[55:02] to do that but if if I had a chance to
[55:05] do that I would come to your home and
[55:08] shake your hand and talk with you and
[55:10] sit down eat dinner with you and set out
[55:13] on the shade tree and talk and
[55:14] fellowship a while but when we come here
[55:17] we are here for one specific
[55:21] purpose this is the house of
[55:24] correction this is the throne
[55:27] this is the Throne of God and judgment
[55:31] Goes Forth from the house of God and
[55:35] here's where we come together yet in
[55:38] love with one another as only Christians
[55:40] can love but in year we are we are under
[55:45] a uh a a leadership of the Holy Spirit
[55:50] the Holy Ghost is among us and we're
[55:54] here to be to take recking among us to
[55:58] see where our Shar places are our Shar
[56:02] comings and how can we catch from where
[56:05] we should be over to where we ought to
[56:08] be now where we are to where we ought to
[56:10] be and that's what we study ministers
[56:14] study those places for their people when
[56:17] they see the people the lot then they
[56:20] begin on that now soon I think that the
[56:25] church may be should be taken just a
[56:28] little step higher at this time I don't
[56:32] plan on doing it this morning ass
[56:34] showing these things but I I think
[56:36] shortly the Lord willing before we uh
[56:39] preach on those trumpets I want to to to
[56:42] bring the church just something that
[56:44] that you should know I believe
[56:46] now and now we are speaking on this
[56:52] overcoming the word overcome of course
[56:55] you know what what it means you've got
[56:58] to have something to
[57:00] overcome and this uh Church age that the
[57:05] Holy Spirit was speaking about
[57:07] here at the lady of sea church age as we
[57:11] have just been through it needed a
[57:14] rebuking Leia had to be
[57:17] rebuked because of it it's uh different
[57:22] towards
[57:23] Christ if uh had put Christ outside and
[57:27] in their age and Christ was on the
[57:29] outside trying to get back on the
[57:33] inside that's love after he had been put
[57:37] out of his own house was trying to come
[57:40] back in and said he that will open the
[57:43] door I'll come into him the church
[57:46] itself and whole had cut him out but now
[57:49] it notice his call here is not to just
[57:54] the church he
[57:56] that
[57:58] overcometh see not the church that be
[58:01] she see the church body but it's he that
[58:05] overcome the
[58:07] individual that will
[58:10] overcome now and Lady OA had it coming
[58:14] uh to now we see them knowing that this
[58:18] is the lady OA age and knowing at this
[58:22] age needs a sharp rebuke from God right
[58:27] it needs a sharp rebuke and when uh our
[58:31] clergy gets so soft and Doty like some
[58:34] age grandfather to his grandchildren
[58:37] every what they do is perfect and there
[58:39] it's been said so much that God is such
[58:41] a good god until they try to make God
[58:44] just a big doy grandfather you see but
[58:48] he is not he is a father and a father of
[58:54] righteousness of correction and love is
[58:58] always
[59:00] correcting love corrects no matter how
[59:03] bad it hurts it's still
[59:04] corrects a real mother will correct your
[59:07] children a real dad will correct see if
[59:11] you just get soft and Doty and let it I
[59:14] was crossing an Old Log the other day
[59:17] down a a wash or what it's called a
[59:20] holler and I jumped up on this log on
[59:23] the outside it looked good looked like a
[59:25] big old beach log but when I jumped on
[59:28] oh great chunk of it fell off is real
[59:30] rotten and Doty I said that's the way
[59:33] that Christians are becoming they've
[59:36] been dead in sin and trespasses so long
[59:39] to become dirty they can hold no weight
[59:41] at all they they don't know what the
[59:43] overcoming means I begin to think of
[59:45] this text thing overcome keep life in
[59:49] you when life went out that's what
[59:51] brought that log to that condition see
[59:54] and it made it wor than ever went laid
[59:58] in the branch where the water was and
[1:00:01] then now you take a Christian that's
[1:00:03] supposed to be a Christian let the life
[1:00:05] of God go from him and experience the
[1:00:07] joy of serving Christ and living in the
[1:00:10] church where such is going on he Roots
[1:00:12] twice as quick amen right living right
[1:00:15] under so if we are trying to follow the
[1:00:19] message of the hour or at least this
[1:00:22] part of the message we should live
[1:00:25] constant conly in the Life of
[1:00:28] Christ see because if don't you lay
[1:00:30] around and know that these things that
[1:00:32] you're supposed to do and don't do it
[1:00:36] the Bible said he that knoweth to do
[1:00:37] good and doth it not to him it sin and
[1:00:40] you become dirty rotten when you're
[1:00:43] separated from the life of God so strive
[1:00:47] with all that's in you to stay in the
[1:00:50] Life of Christ it you be fruit
[1:00:54] bearing we see this age that we're
[1:00:57] living in it's one of the grandest ages
[1:01:00] of all ages this lady you see a church
[1:01:03] age is the grandest of all the church
[1:01:05] ages because it's the ending of time and
[1:01:08] the blending of Eternity and then it's
[1:01:11] the greatest sinful age it's more sin in
[1:01:17] this age than it's ever been and the
[1:01:19] powers of Satan is is many times harder
[1:01:24] to fight against than it was in any
[1:01:27] amen see here back there in the early
[1:01:30] ages a Christian for his profession of
[1:01:34] being a church belonging to Christ could
[1:01:38] be beheaded for he could be killed and
[1:01:40] put out of his misery and go to meet God
[1:01:42] quickly but now the enemy has come in in
[1:01:46] the name of the
[1:01:48] church and it's so uh
[1:01:52] deceiving this is a great uh age of
[1:01:56] deception when Christ said so the two
[1:02:00] spirits to be so close in the last days
[1:02:03] till it would deceive the very
[1:02:07] elected if it was possible see see
[1:02:11] remember Christ spoke of a elected
[1:02:15] people for the last
[1:02:17] day it would deceive the very
[1:02:21] elected if it were possible
[1:02:26] so close the people Soul live people can
[1:02:31] live a clean holy
[1:02:33] life not be uh sinful adulterers and
[1:02:37] Drinkers and Liars gamblers they can
[1:02:41] live about that and still not with it
[1:02:46] amen this is the the age of Life
[1:02:52] personal life of Christ for the the
[1:02:56] chemicals of his body the the what was
[1:02:59] in him first under justification the
[1:03:01] water baptism second under the new birth
[1:03:05] of Wesley sanctification which cleanses
[1:03:08] and thirdly under the baptism of the
[1:03:10] Holy Spirit putting that Sanctified
[1:03:13] vessel in
[1:03:15] service the word Sanctified means it's a
[1:03:18] compound Greek word which means cleaned
[1:03:20] and set aside far service set aside far
[1:03:24] service now the Holy Spirit
[1:03:26] puts it in
[1:03:28] service
[1:03:30] see and we'll notice when the unclean
[1:03:34] spirits gone from a man he walks in dry
[1:03:36] places that's exactly what the church
[1:03:38] has
[1:03:39] done Baptist Methodist those who
[1:03:43] believed in sanctification then Jesus
[1:03:46] said the unclean spirit that went out
[1:03:49] returns back to this church
[1:03:52] body and finds a house garnished sweep
[1:03:56] clean living Pure Clean lives all right
[1:04:01] but then if that house isn't fill
[1:04:06] occupied then he comes in with h seven
[1:04:09] other evil demons worse than he was and
[1:04:14] the last stage of this place is seven
[1:04:18] times worse than it was at the first
[1:04:20] place that been better to stay Lutheran
[1:04:23] than it would to be to receive that life
[1:04:25] and fail to follow it so will the
[1:04:31] Pentecost you know what I
[1:04:34] mean the house is
[1:04:36] garnished as I talked to someone the
[1:04:38] other day he said they're very careful
[1:04:40] even many of the Holiness groups not to
[1:04:43] call the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost CA they
[1:04:46] identify themselves to Pentecostals when
[1:04:47] they do that they say holy spirit keep
[1:04:51] from saying Holy Ghost because the
[1:04:53] Pentecostal common people just call it
[1:04:56] what the Bible says holy ghost which
[1:04:58] Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost is the same
[1:04:59] thing but they're very careful about
[1:05:01] they don't want to be identified with
[1:05:03] them tongu speaking
[1:05:05] people and that's the Holy Spirit
[1:05:07] itself see what happened then when the
[1:05:11] enemy that went out under sanctification
[1:05:14] that washed out returned back and found
[1:05:16] the house not filled with the Holy
[1:05:18] Spirit now the state of the church is J
[1:05:20] with the with the league of churches
[1:05:23] with the World Council of churches and
[1:05:25] the state now that connects it with the
[1:05:27] Roman Catholicism and all the rest of it
[1:05:30] and now it's seven times worse than it
[1:05:33] was when
[1:05:35] it that's where man takes
[1:05:38] it and then look at the lady of seea
[1:05:40] church H after has received the Holy
[1:05:43] Ghost and with the knowledge of and the
[1:05:46] spirit of God within it and then the
[1:05:48] works of God is denied
[1:05:52] by and called it an evil work
[1:05:56] then what about that that's where Christ
[1:05:58] has put out of his own church see he it
[1:06:01] never showed him in the church until it
[1:06:03] come to Lady
[1:06:05] OA and when he got to Lady OA he had
[1:06:08] been put out of his church trying to get
[1:06:11] back
[1:06:12] in now see justification never P him in
[1:06:16] sanctification just caims the place
[1:06:19] for but when the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:21] Spirit Come it putting in the people and
[1:06:24] now they turned out when he begin to
[1:06:26] show himself that he's the same
[1:06:28] yesterday today and forever they turn
[1:06:30] him out because they have denominated
[1:06:33] and the the spirit of the Lord don't
[1:06:36] agree with their
[1:06:38] denomination you understand now that
[1:06:41] they put him out we don't want nothing
[1:06:42] to do with this telepathy it's it's the
[1:06:45] devil it's foring telling see they don't
[1:06:49] understand eyes and can't see ears and
[1:06:52] can't hear see God only opens eyes as he
[1:06:59] will he hardens who he hardens he wishes
[1:07:02] to it and and gives life to those who he
[1:07:04] desires to that's what the scripture
[1:07:08] say now we see these hours that we're in
[1:07:12] this stage and we see what it was and
[1:07:15] the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:17] rebuking the age that put him
[1:07:21] out but in all that did you notice the
[1:07:25] him him that
[1:07:27] overcometh even in that worry Wicked
[1:07:30] Church age him that
[1:07:33] overcometh we find here that God has
[1:07:37] always had
[1:07:39] Overcomers he's had Overcomers in every
[1:07:43] age there's always every time and every
[1:07:47] age that there's been on the earth God
[1:07:50] has always had somebody he could put his
[1:07:53] hands on as a witness in the here he's
[1:07:56] never been without a witness though
[1:07:59] sometimes just once but somebody
[1:08:04] overcome now like the Saints of
[1:08:07] old and uh a very fine man a scholar was
[1:08:13] saying after the Seven Seals he said uh
[1:08:17] brother Brandon you being a a typist
[1:08:20] typologist rather said how in the world
[1:08:23] are you going to put that Church in the
[1:08:26] Rapture without the tribulation period
[1:08:29] in a
[1:08:30] TI he said you see if it's a type
[1:08:34] there's got to be uh there's got if it's
[1:08:36] an antitype there's got to be a type for
[1:08:38] that antitype to come
[1:08:41] from and everything I say that is true
[1:08:45] has a
[1:08:46] type it has a type you have a shadow and
[1:08:49] the Bible said the old things was a
[1:08:51] shadow of the new things to come he said
[1:08:54] but now you took the Old Testament as a
[1:08:58] shadow now he said what are you going to
[1:09:00] do with this
[1:09:02] church this man comes from a a great uh
[1:09:06] man great teacher that's a BM friend of
[1:09:09] mine very good man and he's a lovely
[1:09:13] brother and I I'd be Garr to say one
[1:09:17] word against the brother I wouldn't
[1:09:18] anyhow as as a as a Christian I wouldn't
[1:09:21] say nothing against him he he he don't
[1:09:23] agree with me on that one subject but he
[1:09:26] he's my precious brother we eat together
[1:09:29] and oh he's just a Dandy fell I take his
[1:09:32] magazine read his articles and he writes
[1:09:34] some of mine so forth and I've talk a
[1:09:36] many text out of what I I've read read
[1:09:39] of his articles hear him say he's a
[1:09:42] great man but he he just can't agree
[1:09:45] with me I appreciate that his sincerity
[1:09:48] though he don't just one of these
[1:09:49] pushover just has to grieve everything
[1:09:51] he say he's got his own
[1:09:53] conviction and he stands for I
[1:09:56] appreciate that and he's a good man of
[1:09:59] oh I I am not a teacher or scholar at
[1:10:02] all but this man's both teacher and
[1:10:03] Scholar but I I can't agree with him
[1:10:06] because I don't see it but the it
[1:10:09] doesn't pertain to Salvation it's
[1:10:11] pertaining to the coming of the Lord he
[1:10:14] sees that the church has to go through
[1:10:16] the tribulation period for
[1:10:19] purification I say the blood of Jesus
[1:10:21] Christ purifies the
[1:10:23] church it needs no I believe that the
[1:10:26] church goes through the tribulation
[1:10:28] period Church
[1:10:29] organization but the bride does not
[1:10:33] would you choose the woman you had to
[1:10:34] purify before you married
[1:10:38] her Christ's bride is
[1:10:42] chosen and she is
[1:10:45] elected and she's God's
[1:10:48] bride a bride of Jesus Christ and now he
[1:10:52] said how you going to type that if that
[1:10:56] bride Goes Forth goes up before she goes
[1:11:00] through the tribulation period I got
[1:11:02] scripture that shows you that the church
[1:11:04] is in the tribulation period I said just
[1:11:06] read The Sixth Seal that's all she's
[1:11:08] right there under the tribulation
[1:11:11] period but find out just before that the
[1:11:14] bride's unone amen she's in glory at
[1:11:17] that time she has no purification see he
[1:11:21] that believeth on me has everlasting
[1:11:23] life and shall not come in the
[1:11:25] condemnation or the
[1:11:27] Judgment but pass from Death unto life
[1:11:32] Christ gave the promise that we would
[1:11:34] not even stand at the
[1:11:36] Judgment so freely did he take my place
[1:11:39] and tell I'm absolutely
[1:11:42] free when I'm pardon I'm
[1:11:45] pardon how can you take me out of the
[1:11:48] pawn shop got a clear receipt of how can
[1:11:51] you be my redeemer and take me from the
[1:11:52] pawn shop and the broker still say I
[1:11:54] belong to him
[1:11:55] now I got a written
[1:11:59] receipt wrote by the blood of Jesus
[1:12:01] Christ see
[1:12:03] now in that here's where we come he said
[1:12:08] now how are you going to get separate
[1:12:11] that elected bride you talk about now
[1:12:14] how you going to put that under a type I
[1:12:16] said very
[1:12:18] good I say here it is now in Matthew the
[1:12:23] 27th chapter and the 51st verse if we
[1:12:28] let me just read it and then we we got
[1:12:30] it good then we find out whether it was
[1:12:33] hped or not where the elected bride
[1:12:36] Matthew the 27th chapter and the and the
[1:12:40] 51st verse all right we read this at the
[1:12:46] crucifixion of our
[1:12:48] law and
[1:12:50] behold the bail of the temple was
[1:12:53] written Twain From the top to the
[1:12:56] bottom now that was the law the law
[1:13:00] ended right there because the veil kept
[1:13:03] the congregation from the holy articles
[1:13:05] of God only an anointed priest went in
[1:13:08] there and that once a
[1:13:10] year remember now God with his own hand
[1:13:15] notice from the top to the bottom not
[1:13:19] from the bottom to the top there some 40
[1:13:21] ft High notice not from the bottom to
[1:13:24] thep top but from the top to the bottom
[1:13:26] showed it was done by God rent The Veil
[1:13:30] and to then though anyone whosoever will
[1:13:33] make come and partake of his
[1:13:36] Holiness all right from top to the
[1:13:39] bottom and the Earth the quake and the
[1:13:41] Rocks Ren and the graves were
[1:13:45] open and many bodies of the Saints which
[1:13:48] slept arose and came out of the graves
[1:13:51] after his resurrection went into the
[1:13:54] holy city and appeared to many
[1:13:57] amen there's that
[1:14:00] elected that bride not all of the Jewish
[1:14:03] Church come forth at that time all of
[1:14:06] them made the same sacrifice all of them
[1:14:09] has earned the shed blood of the lamb
[1:14:11] but there was an elected
[1:14:13] group and that elected group as soon as
[1:14:16] the event come that really believed that
[1:14:19] it was sincere sincerity now I'm coming
[1:14:22] to the word overcome now hold that the
[1:14:25] that had really
[1:14:27] overcome sincerely making the same
[1:14:30] offering that the rest of them made but
[1:14:32] in
[1:14:33] sincerity overcome the things of the
[1:14:38] world when the propitiation correctly
[1:14:42] was made for them they were in Paradise
[1:14:44] until that PL that time when that time
[1:14:47] was made they had overcome and was
[1:14:49] resting sleeping see many bodies of
[1:14:52] those that slept in the dirt see
[1:14:56] s now if we had time we could go all
[1:14:59] back to Daniel when Daniel that elected
[1:15:02] one that had
[1:15:04] overcome and he said close up the book
[1:15:07] Daniel for thou shall rest in thy
[1:15:11] light but when the prince shall come
[1:15:14] which will stand for the people thou
[1:15:16] shal stand in the
[1:15:17] heart it
[1:15:20] is Daniel this prophet of God saw the
[1:15:25] end time coming and he said Daniel you
[1:15:30] stand in your life is that
[1:15:34] day here he was come forth not all of
[1:15:38] Israel but the bride type of
[1:15:42] Israel now the rest of Israel don't come
[1:15:44] forth until the general
[1:15:46] resurrection and now at the coming of
[1:15:49] the Lord Jesus those who are
[1:15:51] really loving his ACC coming that's
[1:15:55] living for
[1:15:57] it when he appears in the sky amen the
[1:16:01] church that's dead and crash or rise and
[1:16:04] those be changed in a moment the rest of
[1:16:07] them know nothing about it remember
[1:16:10] appeared to those in the
[1:16:13] city see the the the Rapture will be
[1:16:17] like
[1:16:18] that we'll see each other and we'll see
[1:16:21] them the rest of the world won't see
[1:16:22] them and it'll be caught away amen as a
[1:16:26] secret
[1:16:28] going waiting for that time then
[1:16:30] returning back to the Earth that
[1:16:33] glorious Millennium then the Thousand
[1:16:36] Years the rest of the Dead live not for
[1:16:38] a thousand years and then come forth the
[1:16:40] general Resurrection where all Israel
[1:16:42] and also look at there the 12 apostles
[1:16:47] the 12 Patriarchs all represented we
[1:16:50] ain't never got to that yet maybe the
[1:16:51] Lord willing we'll get to it in The
[1:16:54] Testament how
[1:16:55] those walls of Jasper and 12 Stones 12
[1:16:58] gates 12 foundations all that's
[1:17:00] represented here they are on 12
[1:17:03] Thrones The Angel messengers of those
[1:17:06] days to pass

[1:17:11] message Hallelujah hey
[1:17:15] man there comes forth that great
[1:17:19] hour yeah what a day what a time that
[1:17:22] we're living how that we should check up
[1:17:25] church now we talk about these things
[1:17:28] coming that's going to come now today
[1:17:30] let's drop back here and see check
[1:17:32] ourselves and see if we're right in the
[1:17:35] faith now let's talk of a few Overcomers
[1:17:39] for a few
[1:17:40] minutes in the days of Noah time which
[1:17:43] was tight by Jesus Christ are being like
[1:17:46] today I supposed to have 10 minutes down
[1:17:48] be half hour I just get to started the
[1:17:51] first page I'll skip a few of them if I
[1:17:54] can get what in Noah time hype off
[1:17:59] today Jesus referred to it and said as
[1:18:02] it was in Noah's time so shall it be in
[1:18:06] the coming of the son of man in Noah's
[1:18:08] time so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:18:11] son of man notice there were all that
[1:18:14] anti luian World perhaps of millions of
[1:18:18] people there was eight
[1:18:22] Overcomers eight people overcome
[1:18:26] that was real genuine
[1:18:28] Overcomers there was Noah three sons and
[1:18:32] their wives and Noah and his wives eight
[1:18:36] overcome that entered the
[1:18:39] Ark at the approprate time how did they
[1:18:42] do it they listened to the word of
[1:18:46] God they wasn't caught outside the door
[1:18:50] they were caught inside the door praise
[1:18:53] God oh my beloved friend don't let that
[1:18:57] door
[1:18:59] shut Jesus said as it was in that day so
[1:19:02] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:19:04] man thank you so shall it be in the
[1:19:08] coming of the son of
[1:19:10] man now if somebody is going to get
[1:19:13] caught outside that door many of them
[1:19:16] might have had good intentions and
[1:19:17] someday if such things happen we'll go
[1:19:19] in with brother no because he's a fine
[1:19:22] fellow but you see it caught
[1:19:25] just ate inside amen now think hard now
[1:19:29] if you are laying around getting
[1:19:32] Doty get in hurry
[1:19:36] quick CU a door might close at any time
[1:19:41] and there's always been an arc in God's
[1:19:44] economy there was an ark in the days of
[1:19:47] Noah for the saving of his people that
[1:19:49] was an ark in the days of the law Arc of
[1:19:53] testimony in the days of the law they
[1:19:56] follow the ark and there is the third
[1:19:58] dispensation now like Noah's time lot's
[1:20:02] time and now this time there's an ark
[1:20:06] now and that Ark is not a
[1:20:10] denomination neither is it a good works
[1:20:13] that you

[1:20:19] are all baptized into one body in the
[1:20:24] domain of that Kingdom Hallelujah one

[1:20:42] only way you overcome is all that is

[1:22:23] Overcomers

[1:22:29] inside now look a friend I'll be taping
[1:22:33] this and if it's on a television or not
[1:22:37] t pardon me tape whatever you do who's

[1:22:52] inside I don't struggle
[1:22:55] not him that willth or him that runneth
[1:22:58] but God just that God just yield
[1:23:01] yourself to him and walk on with a
[1:23:03] perfect satisfied faith that what God
[1:23:06] has promised he able to
[1:23:10] perform not joining one denomination
[1:23:12] another denomination running this that
[1:23:14] or the other trying this just yield
[1:23:15] yourself to God walk with him peaceful
[1:23:19] quiet not interrupted just keep on
[1:23:21] walking with him that's right that's

[1:23:26] the
[1:23:27] breakdown see just yield to him he's sh
[1:23:31] he who know what you have done and what
[1:23:33] caused your being you're doing this way
[1:23:35] and all that he knows all about you and
[1:23:37] now he's just told you back just what to
[1:23:41] do now I said only thing you have to do
[1:23:43] just go do it that is forget all about
[1:23:46] the Past walk live for the future in the
[1:23:49] glory and presence of God eight
[1:23:52] Overcomers in the days of Daniel's time
[1:23:55] there was four Overcomers that could
[1:23:57] stand the pest of fire and
[1:24:00] line now we're expected to be
[1:24:04] tested that's a good lesson for my my
[1:24:07] brother back there
[1:24:09] also he that cometh to God must first be
[1:24:15] tested tested what with the word that's
[1:24:19] God's test do you believe
[1:24:22] it he that cometh the God must be tested
[1:24:25] that only shows a true
[1:24:28] child be
[1:24:30] tested and when the test comes on you
[1:24:32] can't overcome unless there's a test
[1:24:34] give to you and with test is given to
[1:24:37] see whether you can overcome or not and
[1:24:40] Jesus said to him that
[1:24:41] overcometh amen the test the test is the
[1:24:45] greatest thing that ever happened to
[1:24:48] you and I believe it's written in the
[1:24:50] scripture Peter said uh that our trials
[1:24:53] are worth more to us some precious
[1:24:55] goal hallelujah it's a testing time it's
[1:25:00] a one good evidence to us that God is
[1:25:02] with us when we're tested for all
[1:25:05] children of God are tested and tried
[1:25:08] amen and Daniel a
[1:25:11] man a prophet Shadrach mesach and
[1:25:16] abedo Daniel was a prophet and that was
[1:25:18] the size of the church in that
[1:25:22] day I mean the bride
[1:25:25] there's lots of church about two million
[1:25:27] of them went down there but there was
[1:25:31] that was the size of the
[1:25:33] Overcomers and them Overcomers was put
[1:25:36] to the
[1:25:38] test every Overcomer has to be put to
[1:25:41] the test and when they said you take
[1:25:44] back what the word
[1:25:46] says or either be throw in the fire
[1:25:48] furnace they refused anything but the
[1:25:52] word and when Daniel was given a test
[1:25:56] that he should take back what the word
[1:25:58] said that they should lean towards the
[1:26:01] Temple of Solomon prayed and he would
[1:26:02] deliver him from all things God had hear
[1:26:05] from Heaven if it look towards the
[1:26:06] temple and prayed and said If any man
[1:26:09] prays Within These amount of days and
[1:26:12] we're am me so persus you cannot change
[1:26:14] or alter our laws that man will be
[1:26:16] thrown into the L then they set a trap
[1:26:18] for it I believe that Prophet knew that
[1:26:22] but they set a trap for him he walked
[1:26:24] humbly when it come time for him to pray
[1:26:27] when he know that the home place in
[1:26:28] Jerusalem that was a burning sacrifice
[1:26:31] on the altar Daniel wasn't afraid of
[1:26:33] them
[1:26:35] spies raised up the shades and threw
[1:26:37] back the shatters and knelt down on his
[1:26:39] knees and throw his hands up to God and
[1:26:42] prayed why live or die he had the
[1:26:47] victory therefore he so much Victory to
[1:26:50] the Lions couldn't eat
[1:26:52] it he he overcome
[1:26:55] amen the Shadrach mishak and bendo had
[1:26:59] some much victory until the line till
[1:27:01] the fire couldn't burn it you know
[1:27:03] Victory is a hard thing to burn out or
[1:27:05] eat up or
[1:27:06] anything so they they had
[1:27:09] it I might mention another character in
[1:27:12] the days of lot Jesus referred to it
[1:27:15] there were only three that
[1:27:18] overcome lot and his two
[1:27:21] daughters not even his wife didn't
[1:27:23] overcome
[1:27:26] she she started out she's a pipe wish we
[1:27:29] had time my 30 minutes is up right
[1:27:33] now see she was she done all right she
[1:27:37] left now I've got to give this to you
[1:27:40] just morning many of you has left
[1:27:43] too many of you left these things to
[1:27:47] take your stand after you search it
[1:27:48] through the scripture and find it right
[1:27:51] you seen the Vindication of almighty God
[1:27:53] but not what some what somebody said was
[1:27:56] a Vindication what the Bible said would
[1:27:58] be in here it is do you thought it was
[1:28:00] the truth so you set out to leave Sodom
[1:28:04] leave the denomination amen leave the
[1:28:06] things that bind you to a Creed and to
[1:28:09] follow Christ by the Holy Spirit
[1:28:12] vindicating himself by the written word
[1:28:14] of God in other words you took the Bible
[1:28:16] instead of the Creed amen you set out to
[1:28:19] follow well Lot's wife did the same
[1:28:22] thing you know she set out to go with L
[1:28:27] follow her husband her children her
[1:28:30] loved
[1:28:31] ones but it wasn't in her
[1:28:34] heart she still loved the world so it's
[1:28:38] possible you can make a start and still
[1:28:40] be the world in you see she never
[1:28:43] overcome and even though she was well on
[1:28:46] the road it finally overthrow
[1:28:48] her you had to take that one big long
[1:28:51] last look
[1:28:54] that's what she got
[1:28:55] caught don't even look back don't have
[1:28:59] no desires keep going put your mind on
[1:29:02] Calvary and keep moving towards
[1:29:06] Christ see she started out as an
[1:29:09] overcomer but she never did overcome or
[1:29:12] she left the
[1:29:14] denomination she did she walked out of
[1:29:17] Sodom of lot but she wanted to go back
[1:29:20] and have her haircut you
[1:29:22] know she had to go back she just
[1:29:25] couldn't stand the the
[1:29:28] test she had to look back again to see
[1:29:30] what the rest of them was doing oh you
[1:29:32] know I had some good friends down there
[1:29:33] after all and after all this might be
[1:29:36] just a little a little move I don't know
[1:29:38] whether it could be right or not I've
[1:29:40] only got this man's word for though he's
[1:29:43] my husband but yet uh your pastor is
[1:29:46] your husband spiritually speaking see
[1:29:48] now whether it it could be a ride or not
[1:29:51] I don't know maybe his Revelation wasn't
[1:29:55] right then if you're not perfectly
[1:29:58] satisfied you're not perfectly know that
[1:30:00] it's the word of God then then you can't
[1:30:03] go you got to be really sold out that's
[1:30:06] right you got to know Hallelujah not
[1:30:09] just say well I see others doing it I
[1:30:11] see a sign you know Israel started out I
[1:30:14] could say the same thing and bring it in
[1:30:15] here they
[1:30:19] started keep going but I'll save some of
[1:30:22] it uh for next Wednesday night but you
[1:30:26] got to be sold
[1:30:28] out you know what I mean it and and and
[1:30:33] that's just uh that's just how it is
[1:30:36] you've got to know what you have is
[1:30:41] it you you know what I'm saying you
[1:30:43] that's what you got that you've got you
[1:30:45] can't you can't overcome if you're
[1:30:48] tossed between two opinions so if you
[1:30:51] just you come to the place that you
[1:30:54] you know this is the word now you know
[1:30:57] it it's funny that in this tape I heard
[1:31:00] you mention that weekend you know my
[1:31:02] testimony that the church would go
[1:31:04] through the tribulation well brother
[1:31:06] bram's talking about the teachers that
[1:31:08] preached
[1:31:09] that and then we heard it and then I
[1:31:12] heard this and heard that and you know
[1:31:16] you had to choose something you had to
[1:31:19] make your choice you had to you had to
[1:31:21] go so you've got to know
[1:31:24] it's the word and and and and I just
[1:31:28] want to make this point so you can and
[1:31:32] we'll we'll grow on it later now this
[1:31:34] Sunday morning cosin's going to preach
[1:31:36] for us and and and uh you know kind of a
[1:31:40] preach for us before he heads to uh
[1:31:43] Europe to start his church there and uh
[1:31:47] and then uh so he's got to interpret for
[1:31:50] his dad and I want to hear his dad
[1:31:51] preach so uh I love his preaching so I'm
[1:31:54] going to try to get him to preach Sunday
[1:31:56] night if I can stay on my knees hard
[1:31:59] enough to pray him
[1:32:02] through but it's it's something that
[1:32:06] that I I I I read in taking sides with
[1:32:12] Jesus so really in essence these two
[1:32:15] things tie together taking sides with
[1:32:18] Jesus taking the word because that's the
[1:32:21] only thing you can overcome it's not
[1:32:25] what you overcome it's how you overcome
[1:32:28] it if you rest in that word and you
[1:32:32] accept that word and you know that word
[1:32:35] will take you through the test you know
[1:32:37] it'll take you through the challenge you
[1:32:40] if not you'll get all frustrated with
[1:32:43] yourself okay so it's and and brother
[1:32:47] Bram says it's this it this way and
[1:32:49] maybe I just want to just leave sew this
[1:32:52] little thought in your mind to build on
[1:32:56] maybe some of you'd like to go on and
[1:32:58] pick up this tape and continue uh
[1:33:02] reading it and so he's he's talking
[1:33:05] about how people were criticizing him
[1:33:08] for going to the doctor him having the
[1:33:12] Great Divine gift you know and and they
[1:33:16] said well you know uh he he she said
[1:33:20] when his children get sick he takes them
[1:33:23] to the doctor
[1:33:24] and brother said anybody that's sensible
[1:33:26] would do the same thing people can't
[1:33:30] understand that medicine is sent from
[1:33:33] God all right
[1:33:35] so the word of God is medicine yes right
[1:33:40] it it's food it's life it it it has an
[1:33:44] effect so he he's he's making a point
[1:33:48] here and I just want to lay this point
[1:33:50] out there if I could because you're
[1:33:52] talking about
[1:33:54] overcoming so you've got to know the
[1:33:56] word is the medicine for the sickness no
[1:33:59] matter what it
[1:34:01] is okay no matter what problem it is
[1:34:05] depression
[1:34:06] Finance worry uh anything that shouldn't
[1:34:11] be normal in a Christian's life fear
[1:34:15] should not be in our
[1:34:17] lives okay worry should not be in our
[1:34:20] lives that's Satan trying to put it all
[1:34:23] that on us and when he starts putting
[1:34:25] that stuff on us we should stand back
[1:34:27] and say that's not normal well there's a
[1:34:30] medicine for that the medicine isn't
[1:34:33] your mind it isn't yourself you can't
[1:34:37] overcome it you can't fight it you've
[1:34:39] got to get the medicine that's given for
[1:34:44] it and guess when I went through that
[1:34:46] thing when I was had all the skin
[1:34:48] falling off me I couldn't figure out
[1:34:50] what it was and when I found went to the
[1:34:53] doctor and they oh you need a little
[1:34:54] cream here because you got your skin
[1:34:56] dries out there and it's something
[1:34:59] that's causing it I got this little
[1:35:00] cream put it I was gone unless he said
[1:35:02] we should have known that wasn't
[1:35:06] normal I should have known that wasn't
[1:35:09] normal this isn't normal but here I'm
[1:35:12] doing everything and it's not normal but
[1:35:15] once I got the Medicine it went away so
[1:35:18] no matter what you're coming to if
[1:35:20] you're going through something and it
[1:35:22] doesn't have peace Joy longsuffering all
[1:35:26] the attributes of the Statue of a
[1:35:28] perfect man you got malice or any of
[1:35:30] these other things you need to stand
[1:35:32] back and say that's not normal there's a
[1:35:34] medicine for
[1:35:37] it there's a medicine for it the
[1:35:40] medicine works by
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:44] itself the doctor doesn't fix
[1:35:48] you the medicine fixes you okay now
[1:35:52] listen what he says
[1:35:54] he says any anybody that's senseful
[1:35:58] would do that people can't understand
[1:36:00] that medicine is sent from God why
[1:36:03] brother if it is not it's of the
[1:36:07] devil sure it is God is where medic God
[1:36:13] is where medicine won't reach certainly
[1:36:17] medicine is of god well you say I know a
[1:36:20] lot of doctors oh yes I know a lot of
[1:36:24] preachers is the same way too it's not
[1:36:27] the man that's handling it it's what it
[1:36:34] is it's not the man that's handling it
[1:36:38] it it's what it is I know many man is
[1:36:42] handling the word of God don't believe
[1:36:45] in Divine Healing it's not the man
[1:36:48] that's handling it it's what it is it's
[1:36:52] not the man that's handling the medicine
[1:36:55] that doesn't affect the medicine the
[1:36:57] medicine is what it
[1:37:00] is the word is what it is the word is
[1:37:04] what fixes us the word is what overcomes
[1:37:07] the situation so it doesn't matter it's
[1:37:10] not the church it's not the man that's
[1:37:12] handling it's what it is so this is what
[1:37:15] the prophet God talking about he's
[1:37:17] talking about that relationship where
[1:37:18] you're totally sold out to that word and
[1:37:21] you know that word will work work for
[1:37:24] you if you're not sold out on the
[1:37:26] medicine that is going to do do the job
[1:37:29] or you start feeling a little bit better
[1:37:32] you you abandon
[1:37:34] it you know I'll get sick I'll go to the
[1:37:37] doctor doctor gives me some antibiotics
[1:37:39] I take him for a week and then he says
[1:37:41] now finish it out finish it out well I
[1:37:44] put it in my shelf for next
[1:37:47] time and then a year later Les he's
[1:37:49] going through there and this one expired
[1:37:52] this one expired I said don't throw that
[1:37:53] away that's still
[1:37:56] good it's not the man who's handling it
[1:38:00] it is what it is by itself and then he
[1:38:03] goes on to say he
[1:38:05] said he
[1:38:07] said it it don't even don't even believe
[1:38:10] in he
[1:38:12] says there's many men handling the word
[1:38:14] of God that don't believe in Divine
[1:38:17] Healing don't even believe in God right
[1:38:20] but they handle it just the same there's
[1:38:23] many men out there with medicine and
[1:38:26] surgery and stuff that denies God and
[1:38:29] everything else but there's a many one
[1:38:33] that believes in them too so if the you
[1:38:35] know so if it helps the people it's of
[1:38:38] God but he goes on but the point that I
[1:38:40] got out of there was so amazing is that
[1:38:43] it's it's not the person that handles it
[1:38:47] it it it's what it is here come here
[1:38:50] brother come here I need you I need you
[1:38:52] k you come here you you come I just want
[1:38:55] to do this one little thing just to do
[1:38:57] an
[1:38:59] illustration you're good you stand
[1:39:02] here and you stand in the
[1:39:05] middle and you stand on the end now I'm
[1:39:09] going to give you something all right so
[1:39:12] now you have this okay you got that
[1:39:15] right now what what is
[1:39:21] it it's not C
[1:39:24] and if you don't know what that is your
[1:39:26] daddy ain't giving you enough
[1:39:28] flows all right it's a $100
[1:39:31] bill right now he's got
[1:39:34] it right
[1:39:37] now he's got
[1:39:39] it is it still what it is it didn't
[1:39:43] matter who handled it it didn't lose its
[1:39:46] value because it is what it is now you
[1:39:51] say that but that could does he gets the
[1:39:55] word in the wrong hands he gets it he
[1:39:58] gets it in the spoken wrong but that
[1:40:02] doesn't change what it is it's still the
[1:40:06] only thing that'll overcome W it doesn't
[1:40:10] matter if he perverts it it doesn't
[1:40:12] matter if he says something about it he
[1:40:14] said how many men in our journey have we
[1:40:18] seen leave the
[1:40:19] message because they sincerely did
[1:40:23] didn't believe it and their want sold
[1:40:25] out and they couldn't go
[1:40:29] on all right so now he's got it right
[1:40:34] has it got the same value yes sir are
[1:40:37] you ready to give that
[1:40:40] away now he's got what is it is it the
[1:40:45] same as it was there it doesn't matter
[1:40:48] if this is the first age second Age
[1:40:50] first hour worker third hour work
[1:40:54] right none of that matters right it is
[1:40:58] what it
[1:40:59] is it is what it is it doesn't matter
[1:41:03] the time it doesn't matter when the
[1:41:06] prophet preached the message it didn't
[1:41:08] matter the man or who it is what it is
[1:41:14] and that's what's so important so what
[1:41:16] do you have in your
[1:41:20] hand that's good how much
[1:41:24] $100 so the same over there the same
[1:41:28] over there and the same here right is it
[1:41:30] your birthday
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:39] you that's that's how we
[1:41:43] overcome nothing affects us because it
[1:41:47] is what it
[1:41:50] is it it that's that's what it is it it
[1:41:55] it is what it is now isn't that funny
[1:41:57] that became a great big saying here in
[1:41:59] our day well it is what it
[1:42:02] is you bet
[1:42:05] Satan but it ain't what you say it
[1:42:09] is and and and and that's what the
[1:42:12] that's what the word of God is to it
[1:42:15] what what is the word of God to us it's
[1:42:18] it's it's
[1:42:20] truth it it's truth get it's overcoming
[1:42:24] power it it's
[1:42:27] reality it's what's really real it tells
[1:42:30] the future it tells what it's going to
[1:42:32] be the word is really the way it is
[1:42:36] everything outside the word is illusion
[1:42:39] because it
[1:42:41] is what it is and so as if if you go in
[1:42:45] this you'll just see how the prophet of
[1:42:47] God brings it down Through the Ages
[1:42:50] because it's never changed
[1:42:53] it is what it is and when you can kindly
[1:42:56] come to yourself and he he drew that
[1:42:59] great
[1:43:00] picture of that bride so it's not who's
[1:43:06] handling
[1:43:08] it right so you look at yourself and you
[1:43:12] say I've got the seed in
[1:43:14] me you know what I mean and and I'm a
[1:43:17] terrible
[1:43:20] Handler but he said don't put your trust
[1:43:22] in who's handling
[1:43:26] it is what it is and if you've been
[1:43:29] elected it is what it is if your name's
[1:43:32] on the Lamb's Book of Life it is what it
[1:43:34] is if he called you it is what it is if
[1:43:38] you got a desire in your heart to be
[1:43:40] better it is what it is You' got to you
[1:43:43] he says you can't overcome yourself it
[1:43:47] is what it is he that is in you as
[1:43:51] Matthew brought out is greater than he
[1:43:55] who is in the world so that's what youve
[1:43:58] just absolutely when we start to
[1:44:00] overcome you start to realize hey I got
[1:44:04] called I've got elected I got
[1:44:09] chosen sorry it is what it is he said
[1:44:14] well wait a minute it's not who's
[1:44:16] handling
[1:44:17] it it's what it is and if he put it in
[1:44:22] there it'll do its job and you don't
[1:44:25] like the doctor that gave you the
[1:44:26] medicine and you don't take the medicine
[1:44:30] because of the doctor then you fall for
[1:44:32] the
[1:44:33] Handler but remember the word of God is
[1:44:37] what it is so God bless you tonight
[1:44:38] brother Billy you come close service and
[1:44:41] and you love the Lord we'll pick this up
