[51:13] I deleted it as I was looking at it
[51:18] the demonstrations
[51:20] last Sunday we were really blessed God
[51:23] and foreign
[52:47] but it's God who sought us
[52:58] to save us to to help us
[53:04] to attract us to him
[53:08] to bring us to be in His image in his
[53:11] resemblance
[53:13] that's the love of God
[53:16] the Bible says love God so loved the
[53:19] world that he gave sufficiently his only
[53:23] begotten son
[53:24] the world didn't do anything
[53:27] the the world didn't ask for anything
[53:30] but God so loved the world
[53:34] says
[53:36] when you go out
[53:40] or you look at all of those that didn't
[53:42] believe
[53:46] on the millions and billions of people
[53:50] but it's to you that God came to you
[53:55] it's to you that God reflect his love to
[54:00] attracted to attract you to him
[54:05] to make of you his son or his daughter
[54:09] foreign
[54:24] let's go to perfect faith
[54:45] paragraphs paragraph 132. perfect faith
[54:50] says
[54:53] and when we were Sinners
[54:58] alienated without God
[55:03] without God
[55:04] Don Lemon dollar salute
[55:08] in the world in the mark in the mud
[55:12] as I talked about this morning
[55:15] God came to us
[55:18] God sought us
[55:22] you never sought God
[55:27] no man can come to me except my father
[55:31] draws him first
[55:35] and God came down in the mark where
[55:39] where you were here
[55:43] it's God who came in the mark where you
[55:46] were
[55:52] he didn't look at our condition
[55:56] he reflected his love
[56:00] he came in that Mark is he
[56:06] is
[56:11] he sought you out and he brought you out
[56:14] so like David
[56:18] that are to create a perfect love
[56:23] look at what you was
[56:27] and look at what you are
[56:30] what did that
[56:33] somebody that loved you Allah
[56:40] for me can't you have faith in what is
[56:44] Promised You
[57:06] then how can you not have faith for what
[57:10] he promised you
[57:19] real genuine love will create confidence
[57:23] in his word
[57:36] we were bad
[57:38] don't listen in the mark
[57:42] in his great love
[57:45] he made us what we are
[57:48] confused on me so we can have more
[57:51] confidence in him
[57:53] that everything that he promised
[57:56] he's able to fulfill it
[58:03] foreign paragraph 133 he caught me when
[58:07] I was nothing
[58:10] I'm still nothing
[58:14] that's speaking
[58:18] that's why it's astonishing or
[58:22] um
[58:23] when you see a servant of God
[58:26] he said he's saying that it's big
[58:29] it's only him that God hears because you
[58:32] please when I pray God hears me
[58:46] and if it's by the grace of God all the
[58:50] glory belonged to him
[58:54] because he loved me
[58:56] because of his great love it
[58:59] he made of me his servant this is your
[59:02] prayer to chill if I can be useful cut
[59:06] about yourself when we talk about a
[59:07] servant
[59:08] is someone who serves
[59:24] is not a king
[59:27] says is the one who serves
[59:31] it's the one whom the servant is serving
[59:34] to he's the one who asked and say I want
[59:36] this if they bring it I said I'm a Son
[59:41] of God I'm sick
[59:44] God said that you are a servant that you
[59:47] may serve me pray for me
[59:51] foreign
[59:57] you are working for somebody
[1:00:01] the glory is for the one that you work
[1:00:04] for
[1:00:05] because you are nothing
[1:00:08] and you were nothing
[1:00:11] it's only by the grace of God
[1:00:15] said somewhere
[1:00:17] I don't have the the quote here
[1:00:21] I believe it's in the image of Christ
[1:00:25] says
[1:00:27] when you see a servant of God or a
[1:00:31] preacher
[1:00:32] and he says all the time
[1:01:02] and he's wanting you to help him
[1:01:11] he's not gonna try to bring attention on
[1:01:14] himself but on his master
[1:01:18] says
[1:01:20] he caught me when I was nothing
[1:01:24] I'm still nothing
[1:01:27] but I mean his
[1:01:29] hands he he caught me
[1:01:32] he loved me
[1:01:35] when I was unlovable
[1:01:38] he loved you
[1:01:41] when you were unlovable May evil that
[1:01:44] transformed me but he changed you
[1:01:47] there
[1:01:51] just like the color the colored sister
[1:01:54] said that that time in her testimony it
[1:01:58] is
[1:01:59] she said I'm not what I ought to be
[1:02:14] she knew she had come somewhere
[1:02:19] something happened
[1:02:24] we have such a great desire
[1:02:27] to be like Jesus
[1:02:30] to have the love that Jesus had
[1:02:34] and but sometimes we we fail
[1:02:37] but we know
[1:02:40] that we know that we are not what we
[1:02:43] used to be because that we have made
[1:02:47] some ways
[1:02:48] and we have to have confidence
[1:02:53] the one who took us from nothing
[1:02:59] that he will be faithful to take us
[1:03:03] where he wants us to be
[1:03:07] he says
[1:03:21] okay
[1:03:26] she she comes she comes somewhere
[1:03:29] something happened
[1:03:31] and that's it that's in the that's in
[1:03:34] the way it is
[1:03:41] and he says when it says and if God when
[1:03:45] I was alienated from him so loved me
[1:03:49] till he stooped down to get me and pick
[1:03:52] me up
[1:03:53] don't confuse those disease
[1:03:57] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:04:00] to use me
[1:04:14] he seen something in you
[1:04:18] if God came to find you
[1:04:22] and to bring you to church tonight
[1:04:25] it's because he saw something in you
[1:04:30] because she wants to do something in you
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:05:09] no one can take your place
[1:05:29] and no one can take your place
[1:05:35] no one can take you out of that place
[1:05:44] even if a preacher comes and shows you
[1:05:47] that with what you did you're gonna go
[1:05:48] to hell
[1:05:50] you say Jesus Loves Me
[1:05:53] He has a purpose for me to do Larry
[1:05:56] where he placed me surely I have
[1:06:00] confidence in him no one can take my
[1:06:03] place I know that I'll get there
[1:06:09] no one can take your place
[1:06:13] he says
[1:06:19] you are in the economy of God they have
[1:06:23] certainly Fair no one can do it
[1:06:27] it is love towards you
[1:06:30] hello then
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:36] what you love Want Your Love reach back
[1:06:39] to him saying
[1:06:42] it says and there's a love affair
[1:06:46] no matter what the situation is
[1:06:53] circumstances is governed by this love
[1:06:57] that creates that the Lord this love
[1:07:00] that creates the faith God give with
[1:07:02] them then when God loves you
[1:07:05] and you love God
[1:07:10] and you love one another
[1:07:14] that brings the faith
[1:07:17] all right
[1:07:24] then he can't keep from bringing out
[1:07:27] just exactly what God promises
[1:07:30] what creates the faith in you
[1:07:35] it's the love that God has towards us
[1:07:39] it's what God has done for us
[1:07:44] it's what God has done through us
[1:07:47] and because of that love comes the book
[1:07:51] like this great uh hymn that we sing
[1:07:55] Oh I love him I love him because he
[1:07:59] first loved me
[1:08:01] it's because he first loved me
[1:08:05] when I was unlovable
[1:08:08] that would love him back
[1:08:10] that I have confidence in him
[1:08:13] that I have faith
[1:08:20] that he loved me when I didn't ask
[1:08:25] when I ask him something
[1:08:28] he's going to give it to me
[1:08:31] because of that love
[1:08:35] the the Christian walk
[1:08:39] is a love story
[1:08:45] it doesn't work by itself
[1:08:48] This Love
[1:08:51] companies
[1:08:52] we were in Corinthians
[1:08:56] that these three things abide
[1:09:00] love less parents Hope and Faith
[1:09:06] I'm sorry in love
[1:09:11] faith hope and charity they abide
[1:09:14] together
[1:09:16] so when Jesus came on Earth
[1:09:20] says
[1:09:22] that Peter represented Faith
[1:09:25] John represented charity is
[1:09:29] and and uh James represented hope
[1:09:36] so First Corinthians 13 tells us
[1:09:42] that that uh Peter John and James they
[1:09:46] are the three things that remains
[1:09:49] and we read the story of Jesus
[1:09:53] as he was on the way
[1:09:57] Jesus who was the love of manifested
[1:10:02] who was the love made flesh
[1:10:05] as he was on the way Jairus came to him
[1:10:13] he says oh Jesus I want you to come to
[1:10:16] my place
[1:10:18] because my my young daughter who's 12.
[1:10:21] she's she's uh terribly healed
[1:10:25] and she's she's ready to die
[1:10:31] and as Jesus was still looking at Jairus
[1:10:34] case
[1:10:36] and as Jesus was manifesting his love
[1:10:40] with all this power
[1:10:43] there's this a woman who came by behind
[1:10:46] yeah and he went and he touched the the
[1:10:49] the the His Garment
[1:10:58] and there were many people that were
[1:11:01] touching Jesus
[1:11:03] even to the point when Jesus asked the
[1:11:06] question who touched me
[1:11:10] Peter Peter rebuked him he said
[1:11:14] but everybody's touching you come on
[1:11:18] what do you mean somebody touch it
[1:11:22] means the way of touching it
[1:11:25] was not the same God when we come to the
[1:11:29] Lord
[1:11:31] we are not touching him the same way
[1:11:36] this woman who lost all her belongings
[1:11:40] this woman who had nothing
[1:11:43] she spent all the money to doctors
[1:11:52] solution got the life anniversary but
[1:11:54] when she came to Jesus
[1:11:56] there was no scripture it is like a
[1:11:58] constitution about this but if you touch
[1:12:00] his mental you will be healed
[1:12:03] but she had a revelation
[1:12:07] maybe she said to herself
[1:12:09] that if I come before him they're gonna
[1:12:13] reject me if I extreme maybe they're
[1:12:17] gonna push me to the side but I know
[1:12:20] good sister but this man he has all the
[1:12:24] power of God
[1:12:26] my way of approaching these two features
[1:12:29] that all I need is
[1:12:36] because I have no way to talk to him
[1:12:40] he's still working on Jairus case
[1:12:43] silver I'll just touched
[1:12:47] and when she touched him yeah
[1:12:50] The Virtue came out of Jesus
[1:12:56] she didn't touch like everybody else
[1:13:01] and that's how God wants us to approach
[1:13:03] him
[1:13:06] my testimony is not the same as the
[1:13:09] brothers
[1:13:11] my testimony is not the same as the
[1:13:13] sister's testimony
[1:13:16] she has a testimony with God others
[1:13:20] with her way to approach God
[1:13:23] he has a testimony with God
[1:13:26] but all God is
[1:13:31] for us to realize that the love that he
[1:13:34] had for us
[1:13:36] that in return we have confidence in him
[1:13:40] that if he was able
[1:13:44] to love me when I was a prostitute
[1:13:49] to love me when I was smoking dope
[1:13:53] to love me when I was drinking alcohol
[1:13:57] he loved me
[1:13:59] he attracted me to him
[1:14:02] if he did it
[1:14:05] without me asking foreign
[1:14:21] it's
[1:14:26] a love that attracts faith
[1:14:30] says
[1:14:39] be
[1:14:41] beyond the curtain of time
[1:14:46] it says faith brings us before the canal
[1:14:50] but it's the law that gets us in
[1:14:58] life
[1:15:00] that Jesus he he put parentheses around
[1:15:03] Jairus
[1:15:05] he looks at the woman yeah
[1:15:08] he projected his love says
[1:15:16] in uh
[1:15:19] uh projecting his love
[1:15:40] projecting is all he says
[1:15:42] uh uh uh uh paragraph 13. it says
[1:15:48] that love that God had
[1:15:52] love is a powerful force amen and when
[1:15:56] love is projected and it comes to the
[1:16:00] end of his strength Sovereign Grace will
[1:16:03] take it and put it from there
[1:16:10] love is a powerful force it
[1:16:15] and when we come to the end
[1:16:18] the end train coming from like this
[1:16:20] woman
[1:16:22] with a blood issue
[1:16:25] you explained everything that she has
[1:16:29] she came to the end of her strength
[1:16:33] she came close to love
[1:16:37] and when she came to the end of her
[1:16:40] strength
[1:16:41] that love was projected to her
[1:16:45] and she received her healing
[1:16:49] and he comes to the end of his strength
[1:16:51] he says Sovereign Grace will take it and
[1:16:54] put it from there and project and
[1:16:57] project the object that love has asked
[1:16:59] for that's the reason we have a savior
[1:17:03] tonight is because God so loved the
[1:17:06] world that he that he is love being
[1:17:09] projected to the world produce a savior
[1:17:12] God wanted to see you well so much he
[1:17:16] loved when you were out in the and and
[1:17:19] it's produced an atonement for your
[1:17:21] sickness and as your as your sins it was
[1:17:25] the love of God that constrained him to
[1:17:28] do it
[1:17:29] [Music]
[1:17:32] God wants to see you well
[1:18:01] regardless of the situation that you
[1:18:04] find yourself
[1:18:05] when you come closer to the god of love
[1:18:09] he will protect his love
[1:18:13] and Sovereign Grace
[1:18:16] will give you what you have need of
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:37] your daughter is already dead your
[1:18:40] daughter is dead Jesus said
[1:18:44] don't worry Jairus
[1:18:46] your daughter is not dead I love you
[1:18:49] let's go
[1:18:51] cause there is when Jesus gets to Jairus
[1:18:54] place
[1:18:57] the house was full of unbelievers
[1:19:02] were full of people that were lamenting
[1:19:05] oh my situation
[1:19:08] oh it's like God that's in here
[1:19:13] is over there taking care of the temple
[1:19:16] he only has one daughter
[1:19:19] and now she's dead
[1:19:21] what is he gonna do now oh we are crying
[1:19:25] when Jesus comes
[1:19:27] the Bible says he says
[1:19:31] Jesus asked for all those people to go
[1:19:34] out
[1:19:35] who did they leave yeah Peter for Faith
[1:19:40] John love
[1:19:43] Zach James let's put on Hope
[1:19:46] he said you come with me you come with
[1:19:49] me
[1:19:51] because with you
[1:19:54] if I have love in my heart if I have
[1:19:57] faith in myself if I have hope
[1:20:01] nothing will stand before me
[1:20:05] [Applause]
[1:20:07] yes
[1:20:10] Jesus remove all unbelief that was in
[1:20:13] the room
[1:20:14] all the fear that was there
[1:20:18] all the doubts that was around
[1:20:21] he brought Faith he brought hope and he
[1:20:25] brought love he continued and when they
[1:20:27] get in
[1:20:42] even if it comes to the end of his
[1:20:44] strength
[1:20:46] this love of God with faith it was going
[1:20:51] to be projected
[1:20:53] to give what is being asked for
[1:20:59] that's Jesus in Jairus
[1:21:06] Jesus was to spend a difficult time
[1:21:11] Matthew 24.
[1:21:13] and get some money
[1:21:17] Jesus
[1:21:19] he took all his disciples
[1:21:21] they came
[1:21:24] and he realized
[1:21:27] that there was Thomas there was Philip
[1:21:32] it was a difficult time
[1:21:36] they're not going to help me
[1:21:39] he said wait for me here
[1:21:41] he says Peter
[1:21:44] James John John come with me
[1:22:14] you
[1:22:26] want to teach me something
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:22:59] all thy diseases
[1:23:09] take me out of this place
[1:23:12] he can do it today
[1:23:14] he can do it tomorrow but he can do it
[1:23:18] the day after tomorrow
[1:23:21] but between all this time
[1:23:25] all those three things has to abide
[1:23:30] Peter James and John have to be at your
[1:23:33] side
[1:23:35] faith hope and charity
[1:23:37] you keep love because
[1:23:39] that because of his great love
[1:23:42] he made me what I am today
[1:23:47] there's nothing else that can stand
[1:23:49] before his love
[1:23:53] sometimes we don't realize the love of
[1:23:56] God
[1:24:00] we don't realize what God has done for
[1:24:03] us
[1:24:07] sometimes even in a simple way compared
[1:24:10] to personally
[1:24:12] how many people were born at the same
[1:24:14] time as we
[1:24:16] and how many have gone
[1:24:19] why is God kept us
[1:24:23] it is love
[1:24:25] well not here we didn't do anything
[1:24:28] person don't know no none of us
[1:24:34] it's not even know that after this
[1:24:37] service that we're gonna get home
[1:24:39] so when we leave church we get home it
[1:24:44] is love it is Grace
[1:24:49] and if he does it every day
[1:24:54] is able because of that love
[1:24:59] to give us all that we have made of
[1:25:50] yeah
[1:25:51] my
[1:25:54] um
[1:25:55] and when Jesus was to be glorified
[1:25:58] in the moment of Glory in the time of
[1:26:02] blessing
[1:26:03] where God places you upon the mountains
[1:26:06] where you are a happy from day till
[1:26:09] night
[1:26:10] who did you bring Peter James and John
[1:26:14] let's go to the mountain in traffic
[1:26:16] Transfiguration
[1:26:18] faith hope and charity
[1:26:23] the Bible says these three things abide
[1:26:29] but the great the the greater of all
[1:26:32] those things it's charity
[1:26:36] and if we have to talk about love
[1:26:39] it's a great subject
[1:26:43] and if God loved us
[1:26:49] why can we not love our neighbor
[1:26:53] if God
[1:26:55] gave me his grace
[1:26:58] to take me out of the muck
[1:27:01] foreign
[1:27:12] izing him
[1:27:18] but foreign
[1:27:48] when he's talking about uh uh uh
[1:27:53] uh love
[1:27:57] brightly love it says
[1:28:01] in that situation
[1:28:05] I put myself at the brother's place
[1:28:09] I put myself at the sister's place
[1:28:15] if I am in the same situation as that
[1:28:18] person
[1:28:20] how would I want to be treated
[1:28:28] to be helped
[1:28:31] you
[1:28:35] and that's what God is trying to bring
[1:28:37] us to California
[1:28:41] talks about the vision that he had uh uh
[1:28:45] beyond the curtain
[1:28:49] it says on the other side it was only
[1:28:51] perfect love it is
[1:28:54] I am very convinced
[1:28:58] that nothing else will enter in
[1:29:01] if not perfect love
[1:29:21] that God will give us that by his grace
[1:29:25] even when we get to move mountains
[1:29:29] we'll know that it's only by the love of
[1:29:31] God
[1:29:33] but the thing that we have to look for
[1:29:36] but the thing that will get in is
[1:29:39] perfect love
[1:29:44] when I was reading First Corinthians
[1:29:46] chapter 13
[1:29:49] it was almost like a scandal
[1:29:52] the Bible says because your problem is
[1:29:56] it that I can give all like all my goods
[1:29:59] to the poor but if I don't have love
[1:30:03] thank you
[1:30:06] I give all my goods everything I have
[1:30:09] but I don't have love
[1:30:17] What is love
[1:30:20] it's God
[1:30:22] what replaced in us
[1:30:25] God in our hearts just to manifest God
[1:30:29] manifested in us
[1:30:32] if I move mountains if I don't have love
[1:30:37] if I that means if I don't have
[1:30:41] godam says
[1:30:46] don't
[1:30:48] you see uh
[1:30:57] yeah what do without here he says
[1:31:06] Grande
[1:31:08] men and women can grow up
[1:31:12] and watch you
[1:31:14] along
[1:31:20] some powers
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:33] man and woman can grow up shouting
[1:31:36] praising God speaking in tongues and
[1:31:39] belonging to the church dancing in the
[1:31:42] spirit and paying the tithes still not
[1:31:45] be in their heart that still small voice
[1:31:49] of God's Rich deep love
[1:31:56] though I give my body to be burned as a
[1:31:59] sacrifice
[1:32:00] and have not loved I'm nothing cause
[1:32:04] your distributed
[1:32:07] though I give all my goods to feed the
[1:32:10] poor
[1:32:11] I'm still nothing
[1:32:15] I have faith to move mountains
[1:32:20] I'm still nothing
[1:32:24] I do speak with tongues of men and
[1:32:28] angels
[1:32:29] I'm still nothing
[1:32:36] it's that it it's that still Small Voice
[1:32:40] that speaks down in the heart
[1:32:45] that changes every attitude
[1:32:51] makes the nature different
[1:32:55] universe
[1:32:57] and you become a new creature in Christ
[1:33:02] yeah
[1:33:04] he says
[1:33:12] in perfect faith
[1:33:16] paragraph 123. you didn't know notice
[1:33:20] now to point
[1:33:25] elementary
[1:33:28] perfect faith is the master of all
[1:33:31] circumstances
[1:33:35] perfect Faith Masters all circumstances
[1:33:41] no matter what it is it Masters yes
[1:33:46] watch
[1:33:48] when you believe anything
[1:33:52] do anything
[1:33:54] foreign
[1:34:00] no matter what the circumstance is
[1:34:04] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:34:16] if it's in the room of sickness
[1:34:21] and the Lord reveals that this certain
[1:34:24] things is going to happen
[1:34:27] you just speak and go on
[1:34:35] that's that just don't ask any questions
[1:34:39] it's already over
[1:34:41] just just keep going forever
[1:34:46] a masters all circumstances
[1:34:50] well if you do this so and so until the
[1:34:54] fair and going and so and so forever
[1:35:00] you see it's already got it's it's
[1:35:03] already got it mastered but I got
[1:35:05] something paragraph 125 la
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:51] because you can't have faith unless you
[1:35:54] got love Pastor convertible
[1:36:02] because your faith is in a god who's the
[1:36:07] very essence of love
[1:36:10] Faith and love works together
[1:36:17] we can't have uh perfect uh faith
[1:36:21] without love
[1:36:24] we can have faith to move mountains
[1:36:29] when there's no love
[1:36:32] I'm nothing
[1:36:35] because this faith
[1:36:38] without love is
[1:36:41] able to curse his brother
[1:36:45] I have the power to make you blind
[1:36:52] but when you have love going forward
[1:36:59] that God told him one day that he was
[1:37:02] going to have a a a trial
[1:37:04] but he didn't know what was the trial
[1:37:08] what was the the Temptation
[1:37:11] he comes to church
[1:37:13] there was two uh young uh uh people that
[1:37:18] were kissing one another
[1:37:20] he had the power yeah
[1:37:22] the first thing that came was
[1:37:25] you can curse them may God hit them
[1:37:35] it was the trial I told you
[1:37:38] give them forgiveness
[1:37:42] close
[1:37:56] a perfect faith
[1:38:00] Divine love
[1:38:02] you
[1:38:06] paragraph 173 verse 72.
[1:38:13] he speaks about the story of the possum
[1:38:17] Eddie
[1:38:18] he said
[1:38:22] um
[1:38:29] and the old person with a with a leg so
[1:38:34] full of maggots and and so directed
[1:38:37] behind her swell twice its size

[1:38:47] picked up those babies it's in a pocket
[1:38:50] he said

[1:41:18] God will project his grace
[1:41:27] the musicians can come

[1:41:34] many people think I I live in mysterious
[1:41:37] life

[1:42:03] In Action my brother my sister
[1:42:06] God is asking us tonight
[1:42:13] with all our thinking our mind
[1:42:16] to believe his word
[1:42:20] that everything that he promised is
[1:42:23] able to bring it apart
[1:42:26] and when it will come
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:30] that we lose all our strength
[1:42:33] that we don't have any hope
[1:42:36] he's not going to leave us alone
[1:42:39] he will protect his grace
[1:42:44] he will project his power
[1:42:48] he will take us out of that situation
[1:42:52] because it's his promise
[1:42:59] God comes most time when we lose hope
[1:43:03] you can't understand when we don't know
[1:43:06] what to do
[1:43:08] something like the woman with a blood
[1:43:10] issue they are very deposited she spent
[1:43:13] all that she had members
[1:43:17] so even if they told her now that oh
[1:43:19] there is another better doctor over
[1:43:21] there
[1:43:22] she had nothing no money to go give
[1:43:25] another period She had no hope
[1:43:28] foreign
[1:43:38] who was there for years after years
[1:43:42] he had no one to to place him in that to
[1:43:46] put him in this in the pool
[1:43:49] it was a dark hour for him he had no
[1:43:53] hope
[1:43:55] but God projected his love
[1:43:59] the Bible tells us about Jairus
[1:44:02] who lost his daughter his only daughter
[1:44:06] every three days before he had no hope
[1:44:10] it showed that when he went back to his
[1:44:13] house
[1:44:14] when he saw everybody cry but thank you
[1:44:17] foreign
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:21] he had no hope
[1:44:24] but when he didn't have no strength
[1:44:27] love
[1:44:29] projected his grace
[1:44:32] God is always there to project this
[1:44:36] grace
[1:44:38] because he loved us so much
[1:44:41] when we had nothing
[1:44:44] when we were just sinners
[1:44:47] you know that he attracted us
[1:44:51] he gave us the grace to believe this
[1:44:54] message
[1:44:55] [Music]

[1:45:03] not will it be impossible for him to
[1:45:06] help us with everything we have in life

[2:02:13] you called me
[2:02:15] you also Justified me he also Sanctified
[2:02:18] me and Lord you said you would also
[2:02:20] glorify me that I'm not resting to what

[2:02:28] he who started the work

[2:02:40] wants to save you he wants to deliver
[2:02:42] you he wants to give you your family he

[2:03:00] thing brother Caleb
[2:03:03] [Music]
[2:03:08] Lord God thinking of your love Lord we
[2:03:10] can think of so many scriptures Lord God
[2:03:14] where you said love casts without fear
[2:03:16] yes
[2:03:18] Lord you said love covers a multitude of
[2:03:22] sins
[2:03:25] Lord thinking about the muck Lord God
[2:03:28] brother Paul was talking about
[2:03:31] I think of the scripture where it talks
[2:03:33] about
[2:03:36] how can you love God have you not seen
[2:03:40] [Music]
[2:03:43] when you can't love a brother that you
[2:03:44] do see
[2:03:47] what I think of
[2:03:49] Abraham walking Isaac up that mountain
[2:03:53] and Isaac wanted to know where the
[2:03:56] sacrifice was
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:01] Abraham looked at Isaac and said God
[2:04:03] will provide himself a sacrifice
[2:04:07] and Lord You're that sacrifice for us
[2:04:09] Lord and we're so thankful Lord Jesus is
[2:04:13] Lord God we want to be Jesus to each
[2:04:15] other Lord
[2:04:17] Lord we want to be a Living Word
[2:04:22] I look at
[2:04:23] how brother Paul brought out
[2:04:25] James and John and Peter
[2:04:29] they were living
[2:04:32] portion of that word
[2:04:34] we want that living in us too
[2:04:38] Lord Jesus as we walk out these doors
[2:04:40] tonight oh God I just pray Lord that
[2:04:42] these words will just go with us
