[11:51] Christ's name amen
[11:55] hey man good to be gathering the hearts
[11:58] of God this morning I want to welcome
[11:59] everyone I mean all our visitors it's
[12:01] good to see brother Gary and Sister
[12:03] Barbara God bless you we turn around and
[12:05] welcome someone is invited by the mic
[12:06] for a song reading this morning amen God
[12:09] bless you
[12:30] good morning
[12:32] you can go ahead and be seated for a
[12:34] minute and we'll uh while you're turning
[12:36] to Psalm 16 this morning
[12:39] one of the
[12:41] few benefits of doing the psalm every
[12:44] week is you get to pick your pick on
[12:46] your favorite Psalms a lot
[12:47] so we're going to turn to Psalm 16 and
[12:50] you know I didn't get very far as I was
[12:51] reading through this but there's an
[12:53] interesting passage it says a statement
[12:55] that David makes is where we look at
[12:56] verse two
[12:58] he says O my soul thou Hast said unto
[13:01] the Lord
[13:02] Thou Art my Lord
[13:05] my goodness extendeth not to thee
[13:10] you know here you've got David you know
[13:12] speaking of the witness of his own soul
[13:15] you know something within him speaking
[13:17] out to the Lord and
[13:19] you know I thought that was odd's
[13:20] statement for him to make to be talking
[13:22] about his goodness
[13:25] you know when he's speaking with the
[13:26] Lord it seems like a funny thing to
[13:29] dwell on my goodness
[13:31] when when he's crying out to the Lord
[13:34] and
[13:36] you know the scriptures speak frequently
[13:38] of the goodness of God
[13:41] and they constantly remind us that
[13:43] mankind has none
[13:47] you know David says in Psalm 14 and
[13:51] again in Psalm 53 there is none
[13:54] that doeth good
[13:58] you know Paul says in Romans 3 12
[14:01] he tells us none that doeth good
[14:05] no not one
[14:07] you know in Jesus himself when one came
[14:10] to him and
[14:11] called him good master
[14:14] responded in Matthew 19 17.
[14:17] why callest thou me good
[14:22] there is none good
[14:24] but one
[14:26] that is God
[14:30] you know so it's kind of interesting
[14:32] that he would talk about my goodness
[14:35] you know and this is one of those
[14:37] scriptures you know in the King James
[14:39] where the old English way of saying
[14:41] something
[14:42] doesn't translate well in our new
[14:44] English speaking
[14:46] the way they said things was different
[14:48] than how we talked today
[14:51] but you know when you boil it down to
[14:53] the original Hebrew all he's basically
[14:55] saying is
[14:56] you are my goodness
[14:59] Thou Art my Lord
[15:02] and thou art my goodness
[15:05] you know I don't in fact it's just the
[15:07] old English way of saying I don't have
[15:09] any goodness to extend
[15:12] there's nothing no goodness to extend
[15:14] except for
[15:16] the
[15:19] you know Thou Art my goodness you know
[15:22] and that got me thinking about goodness
[15:26] being good
[15:28] works
[15:30] you know
[15:31] we say things all the time you know
[15:33] that's a good person
[15:35] or you know that that's a good thing
[15:38] that they're doing or that's a good work
[15:40] that they're doing
[15:41] but you know as the scriptures told us
[15:44] we have no goodness
[15:46] mankind are not good people
[15:50] and you know we we don't even have the
[15:54] ability to have the right conception of
[15:56] good
[15:59] outside of the good one
[16:02] you know we've had a skewed perception
[16:04] of what good is ever since we first
[16:08] partook of the tree of the knowledge of
[16:10] Good and Evil
[16:12] we don't have
[16:15] we don't know what good is we don't know
[16:16] what goodness is
[16:19] you know we live in an age where
[16:22] everyone seems to be talking about or
[16:25] trying to show how good they are
[16:28] you know that their work
[16:31] their cause their skill
[16:34] their accomplishment is good
[16:37] or that theirs is good and someone
[16:40] else's is not
[16:43] what feels good is good
[16:48] you know Proverbs 26 says that most men
[16:52] will Proclaim every one his own goodness
[16:56] but a faithful man who can find
[17:00] you know goodness is an attribute
[17:03] or a characteristic of God
[17:06] not man
[17:09] no goodness is the effect of his
[17:11] presence
[17:12] of his work
[17:14] not not some good thing that I have done
[17:20] you know goodness is the evidence that
[17:22] God has been there
[17:25] because he's the good one
[17:29] it doesn't come from what I do it comes
[17:32] from who I've been with or from who's
[17:34] been with me
[17:37] you know religion
[17:39] tends to focus on how good
[17:42] I can become
[17:44] how much goodness I can have
[17:47] you know and that
[17:49] you know depending on how good I am I
[17:51] can be in the presence of the Lord
[17:55] and then the devil is always trying to
[17:57] do that battle in our minds that we
[17:59] don't have enough goodness
[18:01] to come into the presence of the Lord
[18:05] but the truth is goodness is the result
[18:08] of being in his presence not the
[18:11] prerequisite for getting in his presence
[18:14] goodness is a result of being there not
[18:17] a price you pay to get there
[18:21] you know
[18:22] it's his quality goodness is his quality
[18:25] it's in in Exodus 33 when Moses was up
[18:28] on Mount Sinai and he was there with the
[18:31] presence of the Lord the Lord told him
[18:33] in Exodus 33 19 he said I will make all
[18:37] my goodness
[18:39] pass before thee
[18:41] and I will proclaim the name of the Lord
[18:43] before thee he says in verse 20 you
[18:46] cannot see my face
[18:48] but I will make my goodness pass before
[18:50] you
[18:52] he is known by his goodness
[18:55] in fact Paul says in Romans 2 4 he says
[18:58] don't you know that the goodness of God
[19:00] leadeth you to repentance
[19:05] David said three times in Psalm 107 oh
[19:07] that men would praise the Lord for his
[19:10] goodness
[19:12] for his wonderful Works to the Children
[19:14] of Men
[19:16] in Psalm 144 1-2 he said the Lord was
[19:20] his goodness
[19:21] goodness is not something we have it's
[19:24] something he gives
[19:28] you know in Psalm 21 David speaks of
[19:31] being prevented With the blessings of
[19:33] goodness
[19:35] in other words receiving so much
[19:37] goodness from the Lord that it's
[19:39] actually more than he can handle
[19:42] in Psalm 23 he speaks of the Good
[19:45] Shepherd surely goodness and mercy shall
[19:47] follow me
[19:48] all the days of my life
[19:52] speaking of being pursued by the
[19:54] goodness of God
[19:57] and in Psalm 107 9 he speaks of being
[20:00] filled with goodness
[20:03] we know from Galatians 5 and Ephesians 5
[20:07] that goodness is a fruit of the spirit
[20:10] it is just like Faith just like peace
[20:14] just like Joy
[20:16] it's a characteristic of him
[20:20] any goodness I have
[20:22] is a result of his hand on me
[20:27] you know even his definition of what's
[20:29] considered a good work
[20:31] is different than what we have
[20:36] you know in John 10 in spite of Jesus
[20:39] doing many good works
[20:41] the Jews were trying to Stone him
[20:43] because it didn't agree with their
[20:45] religion which they thought was good
[20:49] his Works were
[20:51] not good
[20:53] you know and it was in Matthew 26 9 when
[20:56] Mary took that expensive ointment and
[20:58] began to wash his feet
[21:00] he called that a good work
[21:02] instead of taking that ointment and
[21:04] going out and feeding the poor
[21:06] which is what others would consider to
[21:08] be a good word you know you could do a
[21:10] whole study on what the scripture
[21:12] actually calls a good work
[21:16] but I was thinking is also as we turn to
[21:19] Psalm 16 we can go ahead and stand
[21:23] David makes the statement my goodness
[21:25] extendeth not to thee but to the saints
[21:28] that are in the Earth and to the
[21:29] excellent in whom is all my delight any
[21:32] goodness I have isn't for him
[21:35] and it's certainly not for me
[21:38] but it's for someone else
[21:40] it's for what he calls the
[21:44] Saints those who are set apart for him
[21:47] and for the excellent the unusual ones
[21:52] because his goodness by which he is
[21:55] known
[21:56] is not the result of my good works but
[21:59] because he's passing by
[22:01] and they Rejoice at his appearing
[22:05] you know so as I was reading that it
[22:07] just struck me
[22:09] you know first of all if you see any
[22:12] good goodness in me then thank the Lord
[22:15] because the good one has come by
[22:18] and I just pray that the good one is
[22:21] able to extend his goodness to me and
[22:24] through me
[22:26] so like I said that's as far as I got
[22:28] but let's go ahead and read that
[22:29] together it's a beautiful Psalm Psalm
[22:31] 16. it says preserve Me O God for indeed
[22:35] do I put my trust O my soul thou has
[22:38] said unto the Lord Thou Art my Lord my
[22:41] goodness extendeth not to thee but to
[22:44] the saints that are in the earth into
[22:46] the excellent in whom is all my delight
[22:48] their sorrows shall be multiplied that
[22:51] hasten after another God their drink
[22:53] offerings of blood will I not offer nor
[22:56] take up their names into my lips the
[22:58] Lord is the portion of mine inheritance
[23:00] and of my cup thou maintainest my lot
[23:03] the lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant
[23:06] places yea I have a goodly Heritage I
[23:09] Will Bless The Lord who hath given me
[23:11] counsel my Reigns also instruct me in
[23:14] the night Seasons I have set the lord
[23:16] always before me because he is at my
[23:19] right hand I shall not be moved
[23:21] therefore my heart is glad and my glory
[23:24] rejoices My Flesh also shall Rest In
[23:27] Hope for thou Wilt not leave my soul in
[23:30] Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy
[23:32] One to see corruption thou will show me
[23:35] the path of life in thy presence is
[23:37] fullness of joy at thy right hand there
[23:40] are Pleasures forevermore
[23:47] I'mma have your seats
[23:51] amen it's good to be in the presence of
[23:54] the Lord amen

[49:19] our hearts

[49:28] [Music]
[49:29] we asked this morning that
[49:32] we can look past the Realms of
[49:37] flesh
[49:39] [Music]
[49:40] that we could look into the heavenlies
[49:44] that we could rise above the burdens
[49:48] that we have
[49:50] and taste of your goodness
[49:54] that we could come to a greater
[49:58] understanding of your love for us and
[50:04] the Bounty and the benefits that you
[50:08] want to provide us
[50:10] father there's a dark times
[50:14] but you said you would not leave us
[50:16] comfortless
[50:17] but that you'd be with us even in US
[50:21] father and that's our hope
[50:24] Christ in US is the hope of glory
[50:28] and that's what we trust this morning
[50:30] that you'll be our portion in Jesus
[50:33] precious and holy name we pray amen
[50:38] amen God bless you this morning
[50:41] if uh if you have your Bibles let's turn
[50:45] over to a scripture uh
[50:52] thank you musician certainly enjoyed
[50:54] that this morning we want to turn over
[50:57] in our our Bibles to a couple scriptures
[51:00] this morning and uh let's turn over to
[51:04] Galatians
[51:08] this morning and we want to read
[51:12] as many of you
[51:14] uh have heard uh several months ago
[51:21] a brother that believes this message he
[51:25] lives in Washington
[51:27] and he came over to
[51:31] his family and introduced his
[51:34] his brother-in-law and his sister to the
[51:39] message
[51:40] and his name was brother the brother
[51:44] that he introduced to was his
[51:48] brother-in-law so his sister's husband
[51:51] so he introduced the message to them
[51:53] they accepted the message and they
[51:56] started to attend our fellowship
[51:58] and because of his work schedule he
[52:01] mostly came in the evenings
[52:04] and with us in his name was David
[52:06] Salinas and he probably have heard that
[52:10] he had a work related
[52:13] accident
[52:14] and he lost his life on the job
[52:19] uh they're a young couple they have two
[52:21] young children
[52:23] and so this morning after service we're
[52:27] going to have
[52:30] a
[52:31] basket in the back or the offering box
[52:35] in the back if you'd like to
[52:38] give them an offering
[52:40] to help them out in this time and as
[52:44] they go through this very hard time of
[52:47] all of a sudden not having her husband
[52:49] children without a father you the you
[52:53] just get to that place you don't know
[52:54] what what am I going to do
[52:57] you know what I mean and when you can
[53:00] come around them are are Hispanic
[53:02] speaking brothers and sisters have been
[53:05] over there comforting her uh spending
[53:08] time with her uh letting her know that
[53:12] you're not alone
[53:14] that we're here with you
[53:16] and as a body so I believe they may have
[53:19] the funeral here at church we don't know
[53:21] what the arrangements are but if you if
[53:24] you want to just write a check out just
[53:27] make it out to Christian Life Tabernacle
[53:29] put it a love offering you can I guess
[53:35] first uh
[53:37] uh the salinases are are and we'll know
[53:41] what it's for and then we can transfer
[53:44] that into cash and and get her an
[53:46] offering if you'd like to leave cash
[53:48] just put it there but we certainly don't
[53:50] want to forget them in this time we want
[53:54] them to know that we're there for them
[53:56] even though many of you didn't get a
[53:58] chance to meet them lovely lovely people
[54:01] and we certainly our heart goes out for
[54:05] them so just a sorrowful time but anyway
[54:09] so that it's let us read here in the
[54:13] scriptures
[54:15] and we're going to read from Galatians 4
[54:19] and then we're going to switch go back
[54:22] from Galatians 4 we're going to jump
[54:25] over to Galatians 27 and finish the
[54:29] chapter and and uh just trust the Lord
[54:33] will bless us this morning
[54:36] it says
[54:37] now I say that the air
[54:42] as long as he is a child
[54:46] differ nothing from a servant though he
[54:51] be Lord of all
[54:54] amen now if we have our our title for
[54:58] our
[54:59] our little thought this morning it's the
[55:02] acceptance of your election
[55:05] okay so uh this is a beautiful scripture
[55:08] he says but is under tutors and
[55:12] governors until the time appointed of
[55:14] the father
[55:16] even so
[55:18] even so we when we were children were in
[55:22] bondage under the elements of the world
[55:25] but when the fullness of the time has
[55:28] come
[55:29] God sent forth his son made of woman
[55:33] made under the law to redeem them that
[55:37] were under the law that they might
[55:39] receive the adoption of sons
[55:42] and because ye are Sons
[55:45] and God hath set forth the spirit of his
[55:49] son unto your hearts crying Abba Father
[55:54] therefore Thou Art no more servants
[55:57] but Sons
[55:59] and if a son then an heir of God through
[56:04] Christ isn't that beautiful
[56:08] amen 20 let's go to same chapter verse
[56:11] 27.
[56:13] as it is written Rejoice thou bearing
[56:19] and that beareth not break forth and cry
[56:23] thou that travaileth not
[56:26] for the Desolation that
[56:30] hath many more children than she which
[56:34] hath and husband
[56:37] now we Brethren as Isaac
[56:40] was are the children of promise
[56:44] oh my
[56:46] God isn't that beautiful so who are you
[56:49] your sons children of promise
[56:53] but as then he that is born after the
[56:57] flesh persecuteth him that is born after
[57:01] the spirit even so it is now
[57:06] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[57:09] cast out the bonds woman and her son for
[57:14] the son of the bonds woman shall not be
[57:16] Heir with the son of the free woman so
[57:20] then brethren we are not children of the
[57:24] Bond woman but of the free amen Heaven
[57:28] father we ask you to bless your word in
[57:31] Jesus precious name we pray amen amen
[57:35] God bless you may be seated
[57:45] the
[57:47] uh if the brothers in the back we're
[57:51] going to be uh
[57:52] reading and speaking a little bit this
[57:55] morning out of the message that
[57:59] seed is not air with the shuck
[58:03] and uh we just trust this morning that
[58:07] it would be uplifting you know in our
[58:10] our heart's desire is
[58:14] is never to take a negative approach
[58:17] against the gospel I think that you know
[58:21] you can
[58:22] uh
[58:24] it doesn't do any good to preach against
[58:27] a lie and keep preaching against the lie
[58:30] because really all you do is you
[58:32] propagate that lie it just keeps going
[58:35] but the best thing that ever answers a
[58:38] lie is the truth
[58:40] and so there's a lot of different things
[58:43] a lot of uh
[58:46] things that go on a lot of ideas that
[58:49] are spoken uh different people have
[58:53] different comprehensions of different
[58:55] things different ways of doing things
[58:58] but we know one thing about the Lord God
[59:02] only has one way of doing things
[59:04] and he does everything by his word
[59:07] and he interprets this word by bringing
[59:11] it to pass
[59:12] and so yeah you know you can spend a lot
[59:16] of time trying to correct air you can
[59:20] spend a lot of time trying to piece
[59:22] things together but you find out that if
[59:26] you just uh speak the truth
[59:30] that those that are for ordained to hear
[59:33] the truth will accept the truth and
[59:36] they'll live by it
[59:38] and because you don't want to create
[59:40] hard feelings you know there's a lot of
[59:43] churches out there there's the Methodist
[59:45] there's the Baptist Presbyterians all of
[59:48] them have different ways doing things
[59:49] but I want to have the love of God in my
[59:52] heart towards them all I uh even our
[59:56] messenger said I'd rather have a church
[59:58] that loved one another then all the
[1:00:01] gifts operating in their midst I just
[1:00:03] want that real love and I think real
[1:00:05] love is generated uh the very first part
[1:00:09] where Love's really generated is from
[1:00:12] the word of God the word of God
[1:00:15] but I love how this scripture starts it
[1:00:19] says now the air as long as he is a
[1:00:23] child differ nothing from a servant
[1:00:27] though he be Lord of all
[1:00:30] right and so you you have somebody that
[1:00:33] I I just I love this so much he says you
[1:00:37] could have the air of all the King's
[1:00:40] children
[1:00:41] but they're they're nothing separates
[1:00:46] them as long as their children
[1:00:50] in other words it's the maturity that
[1:00:54] that separates us
[1:00:57] and so and that's what he says but he
[1:01:01] says so as long as they're children and
[1:01:03] we're talking to today about accepting
[1:01:06] your election and as long as you're a
[1:01:10] child then you you you you don't differ
[1:01:13] you're in the same struggles you're in
[1:01:16] the same problems you're subject to the
[1:01:19] same things that the servant is subject
[1:01:22] to but you're not servants
[1:01:25] in fact your sons and daughters of God
[1:01:29] you're elected you're chosen you're Heir
[1:01:33] you're heir to all and so what were our
[1:01:37] heart's desire is is that we can come to
[1:01:40] the place that we can accept our
[1:01:44] election or our inheritance
[1:01:48] because that's what goes with our
[1:01:51] election is our inheritance we are joint
[1:01:54] heirs so therefore we are heir to
[1:01:58] everything that he was
[1:02:00] we and that's what he did for us he made
[1:02:03] us joint air you could look at him and
[1:02:07] see how that he acted our lord Jesus how
[1:02:10] he conducted himself how he approached
[1:02:13] things how he handled things in fact he
[1:02:16] was the master of every
[1:02:18] situation and Circumstance that he came
[1:02:22] in contact with he was in control
[1:02:26] now
[1:02:28] this morning
[1:02:33] this is what you're heir to
[1:02:36] your heir to what he is
[1:02:39] and in John I love that scripture John
[1:02:43] uh 4 and 17 first John 4 and 17. uh we
[1:02:49] could just uh
[1:02:50] I'll just read that to you real quick he
[1:02:54] said
[1:02:55] herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:03:00] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:03:04] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:03:10] now I I don't want just to look at that
[1:03:13] as a uh as a desire
[1:03:18] in our heart to be something because so
[1:03:22] much of us in Christianity we approach
[1:03:25] things like this is my desire to be this
[1:03:28] I want to be like him that's my goal is
[1:03:33] to be like him but if you can look at
[1:03:36] that from a different standpoint it's
[1:03:38] not a standpoint of a desire or a
[1:03:41] learning a yearning or a hope
[1:03:46] or some form of achievement
[1:03:49] that all our Christianity is is this
[1:03:53] great effort to to reach this
[1:03:56] achievement and to to achieve something
[1:03:59] and to uh work our way towards something
[1:04:02] and to live for something and if we can
[1:04:06] master
[1:04:09] this achievement
[1:04:11] then we're Christians so it's a it's a
[1:04:15] labor
[1:04:16] it's always a labor but this isn't he's
[1:04:19] not saying this is a labor or a goal of
[1:04:24] achievement
[1:04:25] he's saying because as he is so are we
[1:04:30] in the world this is not a labor or a
[1:04:33] goal
[1:04:34] it's a positioning
[1:04:38] you understand if it's not we hope you
[1:04:41] make it there it's I've elected you
[1:04:46] and I've chosen you
[1:04:48] and I positioned you
[1:04:52] that as he is
[1:04:55] so will you be
[1:05:00] if we could accept this now
[1:05:03] that it's our allotment
[1:05:06] right it's our entitlement
[1:05:08] it's our inheritance
[1:05:11] in other words when God in his great
[1:05:13] program
[1:05:15] when and we know what his word is when
[1:05:18] he spoke it in the beginning in the
[1:05:21] beginning you were a part of him
[1:05:24] and he had a place
[1:05:27] he had a a
[1:05:30] creation that he wanted to bring forth
[1:05:34] and so in every age he elected people to
[1:05:39] fulfill that role to manifest that uh
[1:05:44] expression that he was making for that
[1:05:47] time
[1:05:48] and so he elected a people to to be
[1:05:52] there at the end through the desire that
[1:05:56] he put in their heart the life seed that
[1:06:00] was in their heart and the word that was
[1:06:03] spoken and every time when the word was
[1:06:05] spoken it ignited something in the heart
[1:06:09] of the believer that caused them to
[1:06:14] think a certain way to act a certain way
[1:06:17] to have a certain desire and a certain
[1:06:21] Pursuit
[1:06:24] in their heart
[1:06:26] they were LED
[1:06:30] without even knowing it
[1:06:33] without helping it the prophet said
[1:06:36] things
[1:06:38] that didn't make sense people made
[1:06:41] choices because they were so compelled
[1:06:44] in their spirit because they the very
[1:06:48] life that they they lived and the
[1:06:50] choices they were making and the way
[1:06:52] they were thinking be even beyond their
[1:06:55] total understanding was the expression
[1:06:59] of what God was trying to do
[1:07:02] now God's trying to do something in our
[1:07:05] day
[1:07:07] he's trying to bring a people
[1:07:10] to a certain place
[1:07:13] and he's Chosen and elected people he's
[1:07:17] chosen a people
[1:07:20] that he can manifest
[1:07:24] the expression that he wanted for the
[1:07:29] day and the time that he allotted it to
[1:07:34] talk I don't believe God's dead
[1:07:37] I don't believe that we're serving the
[1:07:39] historical gospel
[1:07:42] but I believe there's a God that is
[1:07:45] trying to express himself
[1:07:48] that has something that he's
[1:07:51] predestinated and prophesied and and is
[1:07:57] wanting to accomplish and manifest
[1:08:02] now he's elected a people to do that
[1:08:08] and the way that God works so he he he
[1:08:12] has uh he he has an election
[1:08:17] and it's not an election without a
[1:08:20] purpose
[1:08:22] it's not I'll just choose you I'll just
[1:08:24] choose you I'll just choose you and I'll
[1:08:27] take you to heaven no God's got a
[1:08:29] purpose in everything he does
[1:08:34] so in in his choosing
[1:08:38] he didn't he didn't choose you and say
[1:08:41] okay I Choose You
[1:08:44] I'm going to set you over here you're
[1:08:46] now in my my uh
[1:08:48] salvation basket
[1:08:51] you know you're chosen you're here it's
[1:08:55] over
[1:08:56] okay and I Choose You and I choose you
[1:08:59] and all you that are chosen
[1:09:01] um
[1:09:02] your your over here
[1:09:04] and that's really uh
[1:09:09] that's nice to believe
[1:09:13] you know that's like saying all you have
[1:09:15] to do is confess that you're a sinner
[1:09:19] and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and
[1:09:21] savior and you're saved
[1:09:25] but Paul didn't want that to happen he
[1:09:27] said show me your faith
[1:09:29] without your works and I'll show you my
[1:09:33] faith by my works now he's saying I'll
[1:09:36] show you my revelation
[1:09:38] because my works are the predestinated
[1:09:42] works that God had for me now I've it's
[1:09:46] been revealed to me and now I'm going to
[1:09:50] express
[1:09:52] the love and the Salvation that God's
[1:09:55] manifested in me to bring me forth that
[1:09:59] I have a purpose
[1:10:00] so our election
[1:10:03] for our day
[1:10:06] and that's what we want to we want to
[1:10:09] grip and understand it's not the
[1:10:13] election for the other days not the
[1:10:15] election there was a people
[1:10:18] that were placed here on Earth
[1:10:21] that were elected and chosen to sit
[1:10:25] within the Frameworks of the meetings
[1:10:28] when the messenger of this age was
[1:10:32] broadcasting his message
[1:10:36] so there had to be a here
[1:10:40] and that word went out everywhere
[1:10:42] kind of went around the world seven
[1:10:45] times
[1:10:46] it was preached and it was expressed and
[1:10:50] it was manifested the anarch was
[1:10:53] Vindicated so there was a an elected
[1:10:56] group of people that were hearers
[1:11:03] and they heard it
[1:11:05] and yet
[1:11:07] and that's good
[1:11:10] and they believed it
[1:11:12] and and some doubted it and some fought
[1:11:16] against it and it was undeniable to
[1:11:21] others
[1:11:22] um many people took uh exception of many
[1:11:27] travels hundreds of miles to be in every
[1:11:30] meeting they could every time God's word
[1:11:33] Goes Forth there's a separation
[1:11:37] and there's a a manifestation
[1:11:42] the unbelievers manifested the
[1:11:45] make-believers manifested in the
[1:11:47] Believers manifested every time God's
[1:11:50] word Goes Forth there's a separation
[1:11:52] taking place even in our own lives every
[1:11:56] time the word of God Goes Forth there's
[1:11:58] a separation that takes place in us we
[1:12:01] should be separating ourselves farther
[1:12:03] from the world farther from the world
[1:12:05] farther from the world
[1:12:10] but there there comes there's a Time
[1:12:16] where it's not what's spoken
[1:12:20] it's not what's received
[1:12:23] but it's what's brought into
[1:12:26] manifestation because the word was
[1:12:30] spoken to bring forth a manifestation
[1:12:35] oh that's where the question comes in
[1:12:41] because
[1:12:43] we're humans
[1:12:47] and and the
[1:12:49] I have to say this humbly
[1:12:52] but a lot of times the biggest plague to
[1:12:55] the church
[1:12:57] is the ministry
[1:13:01] because the
[1:13:03] ministry wants to
[1:13:05] Force
[1:13:07] a manifestation
[1:13:10] or a product
[1:13:12] this is what we want what we've heard to
[1:13:15] produce I want the word to produce this
[1:13:18] I want the word to produce that and
[1:13:21] there becomes a variance a lot of times
[1:13:24] between what some ministers feel the
[1:13:27] work you're produced and what other
[1:13:29] Ministries
[1:13:30] Ministries thinks the word
[1:13:33] should be produced and then the people a
[1:13:36] lot of time get caught in the middle
[1:13:40] where some say well this is the
[1:13:42] anointing this is the move of the spirit
[1:13:44] this is the great working of God and
[1:13:47] everything and the people are going oh I
[1:13:49] want you know I want to be a part of
[1:13:51] that
[1:13:53] but
[1:13:55] there's something special
[1:13:58] about the elect
[1:14:00] and that is my sheep here my voice
[1:14:07] so God is always provided a way
[1:14:11] to bring you to Perfection and to
[1:14:15] manifestation
[1:14:17] and you've got to come to the place in
[1:14:19] your heart that you're settled on what
[1:14:22] that voice is
[1:14:25] and what it is
[1:14:27] that is moving you
[1:14:32] and that's why we could
[1:14:35] we have to understand that
[1:14:37] we've got to move to a great place
[1:14:42] of maturity
[1:14:45] and the exception of your election
[1:14:50] is the beginning of your maturity
[1:14:53] because as long as your
[1:14:56] as long as your
[1:14:58] uh a child
[1:15:02] you differ nothing
[1:15:05] but after you've had tutors
[1:15:08] and we we know that in our Bible
[1:15:11] teaching right the great Tudor was the
[1:15:13] Holy Spirit and the word of God the word
[1:15:17] of God continually bringing to your
[1:15:19] place tutoring you don't do this don't
[1:15:22] do that separate yourself from this
[1:15:25] separate but the purpose of it is is to
[1:15:29] mature you
[1:15:31] and then when you come to that labor
[1:15:33] level of maturity
[1:15:36] then you're no longer servants
[1:15:41] okay there comes a time as long as
[1:15:43] you're being tutored
[1:15:45] you're us you're a servant to that tutor
[1:15:50] and there's you he's continually
[1:15:52] teaching you continually teaching you in
[1:15:55] other words it's like being an
[1:15:56] apprentice
[1:15:59] you're being taught you're doing this
[1:16:01] you make your mistakes they teach you
[1:16:02] this they teach you that but one day you
[1:16:05] get that certification
[1:16:07] you get that card you're now you're a
[1:16:10] journeyman or you're a master
[1:16:12] you know what I mean okay you've got it
[1:16:14] well you you're not subject anymore
[1:16:19] now you can go perform your trade
[1:16:24] you can perform your task
[1:16:28] you know when you're an apprentice
[1:16:32] you can't be caught on the job alone
[1:16:36] do you have to have a journeyman with
[1:16:39] you you have to have a a Master with you
[1:16:43] you have to have somebody that's there
[1:16:46] that's continually watching you and
[1:16:48] testing you and trying you to make sure
[1:16:51] you do this as you come across different
[1:16:54] circumstances they're there to say do it
[1:16:57] this way do it this way I help you with
[1:17:00] this help you with that but and now
[1:17:02] God's looking at his church
[1:17:06] and he doesn't want to have to continue
[1:17:09] to tutor it
[1:17:13] he doesn't want to continually to have
[1:17:15] to anoint it
[1:17:17] anointed anoint it anointed
[1:17:22] they don't go by the anointing anymore
[1:17:27] they go by the maturity of their
[1:17:31] election I'm called to do this I'm
[1:17:34] chosen to do this I've been instructed
[1:17:37] to do this I can I can do this now
[1:17:44] give me the pipe bender
[1:17:48] I'm going to bend this stuff I'm going
[1:17:50] to put this stuff up give me the panel I
[1:17:53] can put it in place hook it up I know
[1:17:56] where it's going I know what it's going
[1:17:58] to do I can find the problems
[1:18:01] I'm certified
[1:18:05] God's trying to certify his church he's
[1:18:08] trying to certify his pride this is my
[1:18:12] certified bride
[1:18:19] may I say it humbly
[1:18:23] but he wants to move it out
[1:18:28] from under the instructions
[1:18:33] if I could even say this
[1:18:35] of preachers
[1:18:39] where we're Forever Learning
[1:18:42] another never coming to the realization
[1:18:45] of the truth
[1:18:48] but
[1:18:49] he wants us to be certified
[1:18:52] genuine
[1:18:54] Craftsman men and women of the word of
[1:18:58] God men and women certified as
[1:19:01] Christians sealed with the seal under
[1:19:06] the day of their Redemption
[1:19:09] this is my bride this is my elected
[1:19:13] person well it would be like going
[1:19:15] through all school and I and going
[1:19:18] through everything and getting passing
[1:19:20] all your grades and now you come up to
[1:19:23] get your diploma and and the master
[1:19:26] sitting there to hand your diploma and
[1:19:29] and you have a a a a a a a meltdown
[1:19:37] of complex
[1:19:41] you have a meltdown oh I don't know if
[1:19:44] I'm able I don't know if I'm I'm I I can
[1:19:48] do this I I I got a lot of problems and
[1:19:52] a lot of things and but the whole idea
[1:19:56] and the understanding of it is is that
[1:19:58] you have the ability
[1:20:01] because of your tutoring
[1:20:04] to fix
[1:20:06] and work through your mistakes
[1:20:11] I blowed up a lot of stuff as
[1:20:13] electrician
[1:20:17] I Buck faces on a 800 amp breaker you
[1:20:21] ought to seen that baby go off
[1:20:25] boom lights flickering I shut down the
[1:20:28] whole First Baptist Church of Euless
[1:20:32] I never should have fixed it
[1:20:37] did I make the mistake yes
[1:20:40] but did it was did I have the training
[1:20:42] the tutoring the understanding of to
[1:20:46] find the mistake to fix the mistake and
[1:20:49] to overcome it but I had to accept my
[1:20:52] responsibility I had to accept my
[1:20:54] position I had to accept who I was and
[1:20:57] the problems and mistakes I might come
[1:21:00] into them but I've got the goods to fix
[1:21:02] it
[1:21:07] it's called maturity
[1:21:10] it's called
[1:21:13] the understanding
[1:21:16] that I've been separated
[1:21:21] I've been called out
[1:21:23] I've been made different
[1:21:27] I'm not moved
[1:21:29] by every wind that blows
[1:21:34] I'm not moved by
[1:21:37] emotion
[1:21:46] I knew a man one time first thing he'd
[1:21:48] do you come on the job you ask for a job
[1:21:50] you look at your hands
[1:21:52] if you had some silky smooth hands he
[1:21:55] just didn't really care for you much
[1:21:58] you know he only hired people with
[1:22:00] calluses
[1:22:01] I said well what happens is that he says
[1:22:03] I want people that work he said well
[1:22:05] what happens if they if they don't know
[1:22:07] how to work he says I can train them
[1:22:11] if you got somebody that's always
[1:22:13] wanting to do to protect his hands
[1:22:19] we got to move past protecting our
[1:22:21] feelings
[1:22:24] so this is what we're talking about this
[1:22:26] morning
[1:22:27] I want to read you a little some
[1:22:29] statement I want you to walk with me I
[1:22:33] want you to understand I know there's a
[1:22:35] lot of emotionalism
[1:22:37] going on today
[1:22:40] I know there's a lot of questions that
[1:22:43] come come in about gifts and about
[1:22:47] operations of the spirits and about
[1:22:49] prophecies and about those things at
[1:22:52] which none of those things I heard
[1:22:54] Prophet God said many times that's all
[1:22:56] right that's okay
[1:22:58] you know it's it's okay
[1:23:01] but that isn't it
[1:23:07] okay so let's go let's see just for a
[1:23:10] few moments this morning what is it that
[1:23:13] he's trying to bring David McGary to
[1:23:18] what is it that
[1:23:20] he's he he's his goal is
[1:23:24] or if I could say this what did he have
[1:23:26] in mind for me in the beginning what was
[1:23:31] it that he wanted me to be
[1:23:34] now if I'm his right and I've been
[1:23:38] purchased
[1:23:40] then my position
[1:23:43] is
[1:23:44] to be as he is
[1:23:48] so as he is so am I in this world
[1:23:54] and so that's what he's trying to bring
[1:23:56] us to and he's trying to bring us to
[1:23:59] that through tutors
[1:24:02] and not just tutors but the tutor
[1:24:07] so look I want if Brothers if you would
[1:24:09] turn with me uh or if you would go in
[1:24:13] the message the seed is not air with the
[1:24:16] shock
[1:24:25] and let's just start okay and one book
[1:24:28] is paragraph 54.
[1:24:31] and uh
[1:24:34] I think
[1:24:36] it might be a different paragraph
[1:24:39] it depending on what book that you might
[1:24:42] have
[1:24:43] but
[1:24:45] now we're wanting to find ourselves here
[1:24:53] so when I talk about accepting your
[1:24:58] election
[1:24:59] accepting your election is not the fact
[1:25:03] that you're chosen
[1:25:06] you understand it could be like a
[1:25:08] basketball team
[1:25:10] so the if I chose you and I said to you
[1:25:13] uh brother Benoit I picked you on my
[1:25:17] team
[1:25:18] now wouldn't the first question you have
[1:25:22] what position do I play
[1:25:28] I mean I don't want to be on the bench
[1:25:30] well your position's the bench
[1:25:34] I have a cup of coffee over there and I
[1:25:37] want you to make sure that nobody
[1:25:39] touches my coffee
[1:25:41] I want you to keep it warm wait a minute
[1:25:43] I I'm a player
[1:25:47] you know I don't want to be on the bench
[1:25:50] so I I don't want to just make the team
[1:25:56] I want to know my position I want to
[1:25:59] know the part that I'm supposed to play
[1:26:01] I want to know I want to know what the
[1:26:04] plays are
[1:26:05] you know you have a football team
[1:26:07] brother Brandon used football so I'm
[1:26:10] okay there there's you got first string
[1:26:12] you've got second string you've got
[1:26:14] different people that's because people
[1:26:16] get hurt
[1:26:18] and people got to step up
[1:26:23] you know if you get your helmet knocked
[1:26:26] off in football you got to put
[1:26:27] somebody's got to take your place
[1:26:29] somebody's got to come in that knows the
[1:26:31] position knows the plays
[1:26:34] well we're on a team where everybody
[1:26:37] plays all the time
[1:26:42] because who we're fighting against is
[1:26:45] the devil
[1:26:50] Soca the exception
[1:26:53] of your election
[1:26:55] is no longer dealing with the hope of
[1:26:59] making it
[1:27:02] or battling with the fact you are
[1:27:05] elected when you accept your election
[1:27:08] you understand that the very election
[1:27:11] came with a position
[1:27:17] therefore an adoption
[1:27:23] you're under tutors
[1:27:25] but when you mature
[1:27:28] you become Sons
[1:27:30] and now your heirs
[1:27:32] to what that he has set aside
[1:27:37] for you
[1:27:39] from the foundation of the world
[1:27:42] he has had something for me not for the
[1:27:46] church not for all the Believers not for
[1:27:50] quote unquote message
[1:27:52] some anointing that sweeps over the
[1:27:55] whole group that we're all part of
[1:27:57] that's fine
[1:27:59] but if within it all
[1:28:04] there's ever
[1:28:06] eternal
[1:28:08] predestinated thought of God
[1:28:11] that's designed only to be manifested in
[1:28:15] me
[1:28:19] you can't take my place
[1:28:23] it's mine
[1:28:25] it's not ours
[1:28:31] I've got mine
[1:28:33] but thanks be to God you've got yours
[1:28:38] and yours and mine fitted together
[1:28:41] becomes a beautiful body of Christ Jesus
[1:28:45] and any in an eternal manifestation of
[1:28:49] the thoughts of God brought into
[1:28:51] perfection
[1:28:56] oh I like that he chose me
[1:28:59] he's got something for me
[1:29:05] he says this is paragraph 54 because
[1:29:08] this is you know this is a story of
[1:29:10] Abraham in Ishmael and and Isaac and and
[1:29:15] the whole
[1:29:17] election that Paul refers to in
[1:29:19] Galatians
[1:29:21] he says here we are
[1:29:24] predestinated with a picture
[1:29:28] here we are presented with a picture
[1:29:32] thought
[1:29:35] so you under isn't that a statement
[1:29:38] here here we are presented with a
[1:29:41] picture thought
[1:29:50] the seed started
[1:29:52] the seed of Promise started in a
[1:29:56] slightly doubted
[1:29:59] doubt of the original promise
[1:30:05] see how it started low in doubt in the
[1:30:09] original promise God promised Abraham
[1:30:12] through Sarah to have this child
[1:30:17] but now watch the first Seed of Abraham
[1:30:20] by the bonds woman come by Sarah
[1:30:23] doubting that this could happen because
[1:30:27] she was old and passed in age of bearing
[1:30:32] now that you understand
[1:30:35] that is a a a bride
[1:30:39] that looked at her flesh
[1:30:43] and didn't think that God was able to
[1:30:46] perform his word because of her fleshly
[1:30:49] conditioned
[1:30:52] but he settled that
[1:30:57] and not only that
[1:31:00] you had a fleshly condition
[1:31:04] that you would have continued
[1:31:07] to live in doubt
[1:31:09] if you don't accept
[1:31:12] the payment for that fleshly condition
[1:31:17] s
[1:31:20] and so
[1:31:22] we will jump down to uh
[1:31:24] that that's all wonderful reading but
[1:31:27] let's jump down
[1:31:29] to uh
[1:31:31] paragraph 59. that's where the trouble
[1:31:35] is today
[1:31:36] you cannot make a denominational chicken
[1:31:39] believe with an eagle
[1:31:42] it just can't do it
[1:31:45] there's where the Trouble Comes
[1:31:47] you've got to believe every word of God
[1:31:53] now remember this is this maturity
[1:31:57] this election
[1:31:59] what is he wanting for this day
[1:32:02] what did he predestinate for this day
[1:32:05] what did he elect this people for what
[1:32:09] was the purpose to believe every word of
[1:32:14] God
[1:32:16] not to have a rabbi come along and carve
[1:32:20] out just a portion of the word for you
[1:32:22] to believe or another Rabbi over here
[1:32:25] said you've got to have this feeling
[1:32:27] Earth this emotion or this Revelation
[1:32:31] how many of them I've seen since I've
[1:32:33] been in the message
[1:32:35] every Every Soul four five six eight
[1:32:38] years there comes a movement along
[1:32:43] and everybody does the Jericho March
[1:32:46] like they're fiction to March off into
[1:32:48] the rapture
[1:32:51] then the leader perishes
[1:32:57] the fire burns out
[1:33:03] and they find themselves right back
[1:33:06] thank God you know where they find
[1:33:08] themselves right back right back sitting
[1:33:10] in front of the message of the hour
[1:33:13] where once again that can go to the
[1:33:15] storehouse and be led
[1:33:28] where did I jump to
[1:33:30] what what paragraph is that
[1:33:36] 59
[1:33:39] okay gotta make sure okay
[1:33:44] 59. okay
[1:33:49] okay it could not be air with Ishmael
[1:33:52] the seed of the Bond woman because of
[1:33:55] the doubting
[1:33:56] Sarah doubted God's word that God was
[1:34:00] able to keep it notice Abraham you seek
[1:34:04] what I'm building to for Sunday morning
[1:34:06] Abraham did not doubt it Sarah doubted
[1:34:09] it she was the one it was not Adam that
[1:34:13] doubted it it was Eve that doubted it so
[1:34:16] then we find out one out more about this
[1:34:20] as we pick it up Sunday morning neither
[1:34:23] can the spiritual and the natural
[1:34:27] be Heir with the spiritual
[1:34:30] no American ishmael's children be heir
[1:34:34] with uh Isaac's children no more
[1:34:38] than the carnal can be Heir with the
[1:34:42] spiritual
[1:34:44] Church natural
[1:34:46] Church spiritual
[1:34:49] there is a church that
[1:34:52] there is a church that these women here
[1:34:55] type
[1:34:57] and there's a church spiritual also so
[1:35:01] the natural church and the spiritual
[1:35:04] church cannot be errored together
[1:35:07] they're two different
[1:35:10] separate times
[1:35:13] two different separate people under two
[1:35:16] different separate Covenants
[1:35:21] do you understand so
[1:35:24] you're an elected people
[1:35:27] an elected Church in a different time
[1:35:30] under a different Covenant
[1:35:33] separated and not heirs with the church
[1:35:38] that went before
[1:35:42] if it's not it's a coming out
[1:35:46] it's an exodus it's a complete leaving
[1:35:50] of the religious systems and those
[1:35:53] things which have gone on before moving
[1:35:56] into a divine
[1:35:58] spoken
[1:36:00] maturity
[1:36:04] that's bringing you to a place that you
[1:36:07] that it could take some faith
[1:36:10] to believe that you can come to the
[1:36:13] perfection
[1:36:15] that he's predestinated you to
[1:36:20] and you're going to have to leave the
[1:36:22] doubt of yourself
[1:36:25] behind
[1:36:29] you can have to leave the flesh behind
[1:36:35] My Flesh howls at me
[1:36:38] the flesh Wars against the spirit and
[1:36:41] the spirit against the Flesh and these
[1:36:44] two are contrary to one another
[1:36:50] when I would do good
[1:36:53] evil is present with me
[1:36:55] when I do that which what I'd want to do
[1:36:59] I end up doing that when I would not
[1:37:05] but praise be to God
[1:37:08] we've had one that's made a propitiation
[1:37:12] for us
[1:37:13] we have a sacrifice
[1:37:16] that allows us to separate ourselves to
[1:37:19] the Flesh and begin to move into the
[1:37:22] maturity
[1:37:24] of God's word
[1:37:31] two different people
[1:37:33] separate people under under two
[1:37:36] different separate Covenants
[1:37:39] now listen to this statement as we read
[1:37:42] that's why the Rapture is different
[1:37:45] and will only be for the Royal Seed of
[1:37:51] Abraham
[1:37:55] wow
[1:37:58] you don't think you want to settle your
[1:38:01] election
[1:38:06] the Rapture is only for the Royal Seed
[1:38:08] of Abraham
[1:38:11] I'm not going to go into this Rapture
[1:38:13] with the hope so
[1:38:17] I'm going to go into this Rapture
[1:38:18] knowing that I am the inheritant of that
[1:38:21] Rapture I have been predestinated to be
[1:38:24] a part of that Rapture that's my
[1:38:26] position that's my place God elected me
[1:38:30] to fulfill that that's why I've been
[1:38:33] created I've been created to take my
[1:38:36] position to be that fulfillment of the
[1:38:39] word of God I am that Royal seed my
[1:38:42] proportion in that Royal seed has got to
[1:38:45] be manifested just in the position that
[1:38:48] God placed me in
[1:38:51] you say well what happens if you die
[1:38:54] I'll meet you in the air
[1:38:58] because I'll rise first that would be in
[1:39:01] my position that would my my election
[1:39:04] that would have been the part
[1:39:07] that God chose me to play
[1:39:12] you can't look outside of yourself
[1:39:15] the kingdom of God is within you
[1:39:18] the Revelation is within you God brings
[1:39:22] that word to pass that life to pass in
[1:39:26] Your Heart by the spoken word that he
[1:39:30] predestinated to that time in that age
[1:39:33] to Enlighten you and revelate you and
[1:39:38] increase your understanding
[1:39:42] it's not a group thing
[1:39:44] it's an individual thing
[1:39:47] and those individuals by the nature of
[1:39:51] the spirit and the word are drawn
[1:39:54] together to fit and join together and
[1:39:57] make a body because every piece of that
[1:40:00] puzzle has been cut
[1:40:04] to match up
[1:40:06] with the other piece
[1:40:09] and that piece of the puzzle Longs for
[1:40:12] the peace
[1:40:13] that makes it complete
[1:40:16] because it wants to finish the picture
[1:40:19] how many believes God wants to finish
[1:40:21] the picture
[1:40:24] how many believe you're part of the
[1:40:26] picture
[1:40:28] well quit fussing about the way he cut
[1:40:32] you out
[1:40:37] because he's benefited together
[1:40:41] he's going to position it together
[1:40:47] and then
[1:40:51] this is it's different
[1:40:54] so I want you to understand you're
[1:40:56] different
[1:40:57] your oddballs
[1:40:59] you're all very weird
[1:41:08] but that's the way he does it
[1:41:13] he takes things that
[1:41:15] only he can fix
[1:41:18] and he'll fix him
[1:41:21] it's beautiful
[1:41:24] you understand what I'm getting at about
[1:41:26] accepting your election if you accept
[1:41:29] your election
[1:41:30] you will enter into the program
[1:41:33] it's like applying for a school
[1:41:36] and you finally get your scholarship and
[1:41:39] you don't accept it
[1:41:43] well when you get that when you get that
[1:41:46] letter of acceptance and you get that
[1:41:49] scholarship you just don't run over here
[1:41:51] and get your degree
[1:41:55] come here
[1:41:58] right yes
[1:42:01] I don't go down and go for a job
[1:42:03] interview and they say Well Mr McGarry
[1:42:06] uh
[1:42:07] what's your qualifications now that
[1:42:09] you're going to run our whole company
[1:42:11] you're going to be the CEO well sir I
[1:42:14] want you to know I was accepted into
[1:42:16] Harvard and I had a full scholarship
[1:42:21] never went through the program
[1:42:26] never attended class
[1:42:33] you know
[1:42:34] but hey
[1:42:36] no accepting the elect the scholarship
[1:42:40] is accepting the program
[1:42:42] it's accepting the tutorship it's
[1:42:45] accepting the experiences it's accepting
[1:42:48] the trials it's going through the
[1:42:50] failures it's the educations it's the
[1:42:53] struggles and when you get all done with
[1:42:55] going through all that and it comes time
[1:42:57] to take your degree it comes time to
[1:43:00] take the job
[1:43:02] TV
[1:43:05] you've got to know that you're chosen
[1:43:08] for it
[1:43:10] you've got to have that part in your
[1:43:12] heart that says this is me
[1:43:15] because the other seed
[1:43:19] was conceived with slightly doubting
[1:43:25] you know Pentecost is is the evidence of
[1:43:29] doubt
[1:43:32] oh
[1:43:34] I got way ahead of myself
[1:43:37] bad boy
[1:43:44] let's just read for a little bit
[1:43:47] do you have the Royal Seed of Abraham he
[1:43:50] says it cannot be the natural Ken carnal
[1:43:54] seed of the church it'll have to be the
[1:43:57] Royal seed
[1:43:58] of the word of God through Abraham the
[1:44:02] Royal seed that's why the Rapture has to
[1:44:06] be first because remember we which are
[1:44:08] alive and remain shall not hinder
[1:44:10] prevent them which are asleep for the
[1:44:13] Trump of God shall sound the dead in
[1:44:14] Christ shall rise first and we which are
[1:44:18] alive and remain shall be caught up with
[1:44:21] them together to meet the Lord in the
[1:44:22] air notice it's written again and the
[1:44:25] rest of the Dead live not for a thousand
[1:44:28] years therefore
[1:44:31] they will not be heirs together
[1:44:34] they're not to be in the Rapture
[1:44:37] together there's absolutely a church
[1:44:40] natural a church spiritual a church
[1:44:43] carnal and a church spiritual
[1:44:47] the two different churches
[1:44:51] and they're so close
[1:44:53] it would deceive the very elective
[1:44:56] possible
[1:44:57] and each one's claiming evidences
[1:45:02] that they're the true church
[1:45:05] let's get to the first
[1:45:07] thing that's got to be solved
[1:45:10] see
[1:45:12] here
[1:45:13] there
[1:45:14] see here is no there is no judgment to
[1:45:19] the Royal spiritual predestinated seat
[1:45:22] of Abraham for they are predestinated to
[1:45:26] eternal life they have accepted God's
[1:45:30] provided sacrifice
[1:45:34] and that sacrifice which is Christ the
[1:45:38] word and therefore therefore now no
[1:45:43] condemnation
[1:45:44] Saint John 5 24 if you want the
[1:45:47] scripture there is therefore now no
[1:45:50] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:45:53] Jesus Romans 8 1 that walk not after the
[1:45:57] flesh but after the spirit Romans 5 24
[1:46:02] he that heareth my word
[1:46:05] the word there is understandeth any
[1:46:09] drunken anyone can hear it and come walk
[1:46:12] away but the hearing of my words
[1:46:15] understands
[1:46:17] my word and believed on him that sent me
[1:46:21] has everlasting life and shall not come
[1:46:25] into the Judgment but has passed from
[1:46:28] death into life
[1:46:31] now
[1:46:32] that is not my works
[1:46:36] that's by election
[1:46:41] you will never pass
[1:46:43] from Death unto life if he didn't elect
[1:46:46] you to do it because you have no ability
[1:46:48] in yourself thanks be to God
[1:46:53] I'm going to try to go real quick now
[1:46:58] yes sir
[1:47:00] that is the great mystery
[1:47:02] of God made known
[1:47:05] understand how that God was in Christ
[1:47:10] reconciling himself to the world
[1:47:13] how that he and the father were one
[1:47:17] and how that the great mystery
[1:47:20] of the fulfilling of God
[1:47:23] taking and bringing himself
[1:47:27] manifested in the age of human beings
[1:47:31] and the stream of human beings and in
[1:47:35] the company of human beings
[1:47:37] to make his word manifest in the day in
[1:47:43] the East Eastern rising of the Sun
[1:47:47] okay that's what he did to him
[1:47:51] right but now you're talking about your
[1:47:54] election
[1:47:56] what you've been elected to see what
[1:47:59] you've been called to what you've been
[1:48:01] chosen to be a part of
[1:48:06] how you've been separated out
[1:48:10] he just said this is what they
[1:48:12] understand they see they get the mystery
[1:48:15] of it
[1:48:19] the same he says his word manifested in
[1:48:22] the Eastern rising of the Sun and to do
[1:48:25] the same thing as the sun sets in the
[1:48:28] West
[1:48:29] to make himself manifested in a bride
[1:48:34] Church
[1:48:35] the word made manifest
[1:48:40] now what are we elected to
[1:48:46] are we elected to anointings
[1:48:49] are we elected to
[1:48:52] gifts so to say
[1:48:55] they're good
[1:48:58] but we're elected
[1:49:01] to a word Union
[1:49:05] where the word was made flesh
[1:49:09] now the flesh is being made word
[1:49:15] so there's a perfection
[1:49:18] and a maturity
[1:49:21] that this bride has been elected to
[1:49:25] that sets them apart from anything
[1:49:28] that's ever before
[1:49:31] therefore there's a separation of this
[1:49:36] people
[1:49:38] from the shock that carried them
[1:49:43] so their power
[1:49:45] oh
[1:49:48] remember the rain falls on the just an
[1:49:50] unjust they're very shouts
[1:49:52] but their power is not in the rain
[1:49:59] their power is in the seed
[1:50:02] because they have the life
[1:50:06] they not only do they have the word but
[1:50:10] they've accepted their election to be
[1:50:13] the word
[1:50:18] now they've got what
[1:50:20] thus
[1:50:22] saith the Lord
[1:50:27] they're not relying on something that's
[1:50:29] outside
[1:50:32] that's why he got to the place he said
[1:50:34] pray to him that was within you
[1:50:37] the kingdom of God is within you that
[1:50:40] you can't understand either the
[1:50:42] beginning or the end of it
[1:50:45] in other words what he's trying to bring
[1:50:48] us to is the revelation of what we were
[1:50:51] in his mind in the beginning
[1:50:58] don't think you're going to get in
[1:51:02] unlovey-dovey Christianity
[1:51:08] oh I'm just going to love everybody
[1:51:11] I'm going to pick up the snake
[1:51:14] and put them in my pocket
[1:51:16] say oh good snake
[1:51:18] I got so much love in my heart
[1:51:25] you know that and you know the snake
[1:51:28] bites
[1:51:31] it's hard when you talk to people how
[1:51:33] can two walk together unless they agree
[1:51:38] every time I open the door
[1:51:41] and I go into something
[1:51:44] my testimony is
[1:51:47] this is a good place
[1:51:50] I go into a restaurant and I eat there
[1:51:54] I'm either going to come out saying this
[1:51:57] is pure food this is good food this is
[1:52:00] home cooking this is the best ribs I'm
[1:52:03] gonna go back
[1:52:07] or I'm not going to patronize that place
[1:52:12] right
[1:52:14] but if I keep patronizing that place and
[1:52:17] I keep patronizing that place and so
[1:52:19] where do you want to go well let's go
[1:52:21] over to Papa goes where do you want to
[1:52:23] go well let's go over to Spring Creek
[1:52:24] where do you want to go let's go over to
[1:52:26] Lucille where do you want to go let's go
[1:52:28] over to Dixie House
[1:52:31] would you think by the time that I think
[1:52:33] that's a good place
[1:52:40] look if I don't believe in something why
[1:52:42] do I keep going there
[1:52:43] why do I keep patronizing it why do I
[1:52:47] keep because now I'm I am preaching
[1:52:50] their gospel I'm saying this is good
[1:52:52] food
[1:52:53] this is what everybody should have
[1:53:00] no it's important
[1:53:04] because that's part of the reproach is
[1:53:08] blessed is he who is not offended in me
[1:53:10] what the problem was the church didn't
[1:53:13] like the product
[1:53:16] they didn't like what the words
[1:53:18] producing
[1:53:21] they want denomination they want system
[1:53:24] they want organization they want signs
[1:53:27] these signs that this church is going to
[1:53:29] have is not the signs of of of
[1:53:33] emotion It's The Sign of the saith the
[1:53:36] Lord when they meet Satan face to face
[1:53:39] and they stand there and they say it is
[1:53:42] written it is written
[1:53:45] get behind me
[1:53:48] because they're steadfast
[1:53:54] because it doesn't come from without
[1:53:57] it comes from within
[1:54:00] you say are you again shouting no I love
[1:54:02] to shout I love to praise I would that
[1:54:04] all of you speak in tongues
[1:54:08] I would that you all dance in the spirit
[1:54:10] I have danced in the spirit
[1:54:14] it's wonderful
[1:54:16] but it's not what God's bringing us
[1:54:22] he said the bright Church the word may
[1:54:25] manifest
[1:54:26] it will he that understandeth
[1:54:30] that is to know
[1:54:32] that been revealed
[1:54:35] to him of him
[1:54:39] that sent me
[1:54:41] has everlasting life
[1:54:43] and will not come into the Judgment but
[1:54:46] is passed from death and the light what
[1:54:48] is it
[1:54:49] a bride church right the word made
[1:54:52] manifested it
[1:54:56] it will too he that understandeth
[1:55:00] that is to know
[1:55:03] that's been revealed to him
[1:55:06] of him that sent me
[1:55:12] has everlasting life
[1:55:14] do you know there's a pathway of
[1:55:17] Revelation that God chose God chose a
[1:55:20] prophet
[1:55:21] to bring the revelation
[1:55:23] to the church
[1:55:26] it didn't it it didn't choose he didn't
[1:55:29] choose a another way to do it
[1:55:33] he chose the the word way
[1:55:36] to do it and and there's there's just no
[1:55:38] separation from that let's grab our
[1:55:40] Bibles real quick as we work here just
[1:55:44] for a moment this morning
[1:55:46] to go over to Corinthians
[1:56:00] and you know this great Corinthians 13.
[1:56:03] how it just speaks of all these great
[1:56:07] the great things in the word of God
[1:56:12] so he's talking about charity 13 4.
[1:56:16] charity he says you know of all these
[1:56:18] things you've got to have love how many
[1:56:20] knows that loves the Capstone
[1:56:22] God is love
[1:56:24] right God is the word in the beginning
[1:56:28] was the word in the beginning was the
[1:56:31] love
[1:56:32] the love is what put you here the love
[1:56:35] is what created you the love is what
[1:56:38] elected you it's the love that made you
[1:56:41] the way you are you see me just the way
[1:56:44] I am here I'm the love of God
[1:56:49] now you might think he might have done a
[1:56:51] better job
[1:56:56] you know he could have left me with some
[1:56:58] hair
[1:56:59] he could have rearranged a few
[1:57:02] facial features he could have made me
[1:57:05] stronger
[1:57:07] and have a much more better personality
[1:57:14] but he wouldn't relying on that
[1:57:17] I'm not relying on that I'm relying on
[1:57:21] the love
[1:57:27] part of accepting my election
[1:57:30] is accepting the love that goes with it
[1:57:34] God so loved us
[1:57:37] here as we're reading it says Charities
[1:57:42] long suffereth long and is kind
[1:57:46] charity envious not Cherokee Bank of
[1:57:49] itself
[1:57:50] it is not puffed up
[1:57:52] does not behave itself unseemingly
[1:57:55] seeketh not our own is not easily
[1:57:58] provoked thinketh no evil
[1:58:01] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[1:58:05] in truth
[1:58:09] beareth all things
[1:58:11] believeth all things hope with all
[1:58:13] things endureth all things
[1:58:16] charity never faileth
[1:58:18] but what wherever well where there be
[1:58:22] prophecies they shall fail
[1:58:25] where there be tongues
[1:58:27] they shall cease
[1:58:31] where there be knowledge it shall vanish
[1:58:34] away
[1:58:35] for we know in part
[1:58:38] and we prophesy in part
[1:58:41] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:58:46] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:58:49] away
[1:58:51] when I was a child I spoke as a child I
[1:58:55] understood as a child I thought of the
[1:58:58] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:59:02] childish things
[1:59:04] because there was a the maturity
[1:59:08] you've been under the tutors
[1:59:12] but you're no longer we've got
[1:59:15] we got to take our our
[1:59:20] uh diploma
[1:59:24] and we got to enter into the work
[1:59:27] Force
[1:59:29] and perform our elected trade
[1:59:33] whatever it may be
[1:59:37] but you're equipped with it
[1:59:41] he's put it in you each one of you has
[1:59:44] the power of God wrapped up in your
[1:59:48] heart if we could move past the doubt
[1:59:54] we don't compart
[1:59:57] shall be done away when a child
[2:00:00] I spoke as a child I understood as a
[2:00:02] child I thought as a child but when I
[2:00:06] became a man I put away childish things
[2:00:09] for now we see through a glass darkening
[2:00:11] but then face to face now I know in part
[2:00:15] but then shall I know even as I am known
[2:00:24] where do you think you are
[2:00:28] where are we in the
[2:00:30] the
[2:00:32] great scheme of things
[2:00:35] where are we in the time
[2:00:38] that we're living
[2:00:42] we're no longer heir of the shock
[2:00:47] the life has come up
[2:00:49] right we've come down to the age of
[2:00:52] maturity
[2:00:55] the shock is there what was the shock
[2:01:00] it was Pentecost
[2:01:05] right they spoke in tongues they
[2:01:08] prophesied
[2:01:09] they they did all these great things but
[2:01:12] they did it in part
[2:01:16] and it's fine
[2:01:18] the prophet of God said it was a good
[2:01:20] Chuck
[2:01:22] it brought us to where we are
[2:01:25] but it's hard because everything in the
[2:01:29] word
[2:01:30] is manifested in the flesh so the shock
[2:01:35] when it was coming it wasn't a shock it
[2:01:38] was a type
[2:01:40] but there was real human beings
[2:01:44] that were living worshiping and praising
[2:01:48] that represented that type in the flesh
[2:01:54] if that type's represented in the flesh
[2:01:57] then there's got to be a seed type
[2:02:01] represented in the flesh
[2:02:05] there's got to be something that comes
[2:02:07] into maturity
[2:02:09] of the same seed that went into the
[2:02:12] ground
[2:02:14] oh Hallelujah
[2:02:16] I'm looking at a house full of them
[2:02:20] little Messiahs
[2:02:23] Sons and Daughters of God
[2:02:30] that have their diploma
[2:02:33] that have thus saith the Lord
[2:02:36] that have the word of God that meets
[2:02:39] Satan
[2:02:41] it is not going to move him
[2:02:45] with a shout
[2:02:48] it's not going to move them with a
[2:02:51] Hallelujah
[2:02:53] or with dancing
[2:02:57] not a people that's got to be delivered
[2:03:00] over and over and over again
[2:03:04] you know how Deliverance Ministry works
[2:03:09] first of all I'd convince you all
[2:03:11] sinners
[2:03:13] you all got problems you all got trouble
[2:03:17] with television you all got trouble with
[2:03:19] internet you all got trouble with your
[2:03:22] phones you low down
[2:03:24] Center people
[2:03:28] you're so burdened and all this stuff
[2:03:31] you need Deliverance
[2:03:36] come on up I'll lay my hands on you
[2:03:40] well you feel delivered
[2:03:42] you'll fall out I'm not afraid
[2:03:45] thus saith the Lord
[2:03:49] you'll fall out and you have another big
[2:03:51] Deliverance
[2:03:53] you'll run to the altar over and over
[2:03:56] and over again you know why that's the
[2:03:59] shock
[2:04:04] is the shock
[2:04:05] it's a good shock
[2:04:08] it's a good thing
[2:04:10] speaking in tongues and prophesying and
[2:04:15] the anointing of the Holy Spirit and
[2:04:17] Dreaming Dreams and seeking Visions all
[2:04:20] that was what brought us it brought us
[2:04:23] to the place if that wasn't there we
[2:04:26] would have never recognized the ministry
[2:04:28] of William Branham
[2:04:34] and it's good
[2:04:37] you say can we still do that yes
[2:04:41] do it
[2:04:43] but understand
[2:04:46] that's not what God's bringing you to
[2:04:51] okay and let's close with this and we'll
[2:04:53] be on this subject
[2:04:56] some more because paragraph 91.
[2:05:09] and I'll just throw a paragraph 82 in
[2:05:12] there before or 81. it's just like the
[2:05:15] corn matures or the wheat
[2:05:17] it comes forth a stock
[2:05:21] then it comes forth the pollen and then
[2:05:24] comes forth the shuck
[2:05:26] but when you think that the shock if you
[2:05:29] don't watch it
[2:05:30] it'll look just exactly like the real
[2:05:34] wheat
[2:05:35] but when it's opened up the real wheat
[2:05:38] is on the inside it's only a carrier
[2:05:43] you see Mary through faith not through
[2:05:46] sex but through faith something exactly
[2:05:50] like it Mary was not that seed Mary was
[2:05:54] the carrier of that seed
[2:05:57] he was a genuine Faith seed because the
[2:06:02] word of God Is by faith that he gave to
[2:06:05] Abraham and only faith can produce what
[2:06:09] God said it'll do faith in his word
[2:06:15] paragraph 91.
[2:06:19] but Pentecost represented Mary
[2:06:30] but Pentecost represented Mary
[2:06:34] Mary the last stage of it
[2:06:37] now
[2:06:39] she was not the seed
[2:06:41] yet the life of the seed was in her
[2:06:46] now you see what he's saying right so
[2:06:50] Pentecost the life of the seed was in it
[2:06:57] that's why it's attracting
[2:07:01] it's you can't say it's not the life
[2:07:04] you can't say it's not the anointing
[2:07:07] you can't say it's not the spirit
[2:07:13] and you can't say this is it
[2:07:20] but they're they're they're there
[2:07:22] there's something more that pushes
[2:07:24] beyond that
[2:07:26] so I don't ever want to be guilty
[2:07:30] and I know a lot of people put me in
[2:07:32] that place
[2:07:34] I'm not against the life that was in the
[2:07:37] shock because it was the life
[2:07:41] mm-hmm
[2:07:42] but what I want you to understand is
[2:07:45] you're called for something higher than
[2:07:47] that
[2:07:52] so don't look for the life that was in
[2:07:54] the shock look for the life that was in
[2:07:57] the seed
[2:08:00] same life
[2:08:04] couldn't I preach anointed ones at the
[2:08:06] end time right now
[2:08:07] same life
[2:08:09] listen
[2:08:11] yet
[2:08:13] Pentecost represented Mary
[2:08:15] the last stage of it now she was not the
[2:08:19] seed
[2:08:20] yet the life of the seed was in her
[2:08:24] but it hadn't
[2:08:26] matured
[2:08:28] yet
[2:08:32] I feel very religious
[2:08:35] it hadn't matured yet
[2:08:39] it was there
[2:08:41] but it wasn't matured
[2:08:51] that's my heart's desire
[2:08:53] is the maturity
[2:08:57] and I know a lot of people because
[2:09:01] they've been brought into this message
[2:09:03] and they haven't been through that shuck
[2:09:05] stage
[2:09:07] that they're attracted to it
[2:09:10] okay
[2:09:13] it's okay
[2:09:18] but there's a maturity Beyond it
[2:09:24] there's a maturity where you make
[2:09:25] contact with the word
[2:09:30] you don't need them brushing wind
[2:09:32] you don't need a shiver
[2:09:35] you don't need excitement
[2:09:39] You Know Who You Are
[2:09:42] you know where you're going you know
[2:09:44] where you're come from you know what
[2:09:47] you've been trained with you know what
[2:09:49] you possess
[2:09:52] and ain't no devil
[2:09:54] in hell yes I'm gonna move you
[2:09:58] because you possess
[2:10:00] the gates of your enemy I've been chosen
[2:10:03] I've been elected I've been called my
[2:10:07] name's on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:10:16] I've matured
[2:10:19] to that perfect faith
[2:10:22] that Jesus knew what the word said
[2:10:28] he was
[2:10:30] and he wasn't afraid to accept his
[2:10:33] calling for this cause did you know that
[2:10:36] Jesus had to accept his position
[2:10:40] as Lord and savior
[2:10:44] and Messiah
[2:10:46] just like you have to accept your
[2:10:49] position and pride
[2:10:51] Jesus by faith
[2:10:53] sought the scripture
[2:10:57] took his life
[2:10:59] lined it up with the scripture
[2:11:01] and came to the place saying what
[2:11:04] they're talking about I am
[2:11:09] no wonder he said I am the I am
[2:11:16] that's what he was I am
[2:11:18] I am that word
[2:11:21] I am the god that orchestrated history
[2:11:24] that raised those prophets that put
[2:11:27] Israel in bondage that ran the whole
[2:11:30] history of his people to produce the
[2:11:34] prophecy and a in an example and a
[2:11:39] shadow and a type he said I am
[2:11:44] that word
[2:11:46] I am the way I am the truth I am the
[2:11:51] life
[2:11:52] that was the mature seed
[2:11:56] the I am
[2:12:01] to be all-inclusive that's the big thing
[2:12:04] nowadays again
[2:12:06] can I say
[2:12:09] we are the we are
[2:12:18] I'm not the shock
[2:12:22] I'm the full maturity
[2:12:26] of the word of God
[2:12:28] that's predestinated
[2:12:31] for this day
[2:12:33] did that offend you
[2:12:36] let me say it again
[2:12:43] you know I don't ever say something
[2:12:45] unless I got a quote don't you
[2:12:50] I'm trying to make sure
[2:12:52] that we don't stray
[2:12:56] though all these things are wonderful
[2:12:59] and if you want to you want to scream
[2:13:02] I'm all for it
[2:13:05] I scream in my office all the time
[2:13:10] I love to rejoice
[2:13:12] I love to praise God praise God
[2:13:15] hallelujah it's wonderful
[2:13:18] but I want to understand what I've been
[2:13:21] elected to
[2:13:23] I've been elected to a maturity
[2:13:26] that makes me in a position that's been
[2:13:30] prophesied is that as he is
[2:13:35] so are we on this Earth
[2:13:40] and he didn't go by outside feeling
[2:13:44] he went by inside Revelation that
[2:13:47] allowed him to speak the word
[2:13:52] and he lived by Spoken Word
[2:13:55] and let's just go and finish up this
[2:13:57] morning
[2:13:59] and we'll go we'll just jump over it
[2:14:01] this this ought to all get your hearts
[2:14:04] on fire to get into seed us not air with
[2:14:06] the shot
[2:14:08] let's jump over here to
[2:14:11] paragraph
[2:14:17] 100
[2:14:19] but when the seed was delivered it said
[2:14:23] I come to do the will of him that sent
[2:14:28] me
[2:14:33] don't let that blow by you
[2:14:36] when the seed was delivered aren't you
[2:14:38] the seed
[2:14:39] that's been delivered in this day
[2:14:42] he put you in this day he delivered you
[2:14:45] in this day he put you in this dark time
[2:14:48] this Dark Hour this Dark Age he
[2:14:51] delivered you to this age he could have
[2:14:53] delivered you to another age you say
[2:14:56] deliver you were in his mind the color
[2:14:58] of your hair the color of your eyes
[2:15:00] everything your statue and everything
[2:15:03] you were with him in the beginning and
[2:15:05] he delivered you to this age Hallelujah
[2:15:13] I've been birthed
[2:15:16] to this time
[2:15:18] to this age to this maturity
[2:15:24] if I'd have been birthed in Pentecost
[2:15:26] I'd have been the most dancing shouting
[2:15:29] speaking in tongues running around the
[2:15:31] church fool you ever seen
[2:15:36] I wasn't delivered to that age
[2:15:42] it's the same life
[2:15:45] because it's the same life I can produce
[2:15:47] the same product
[2:15:53] did that go over anybody's head because
[2:15:55] it's the same life this same life
[2:15:57] produces justification
[2:16:03] this same life produces sanctification
[2:16:06] this same life produces a restoration of
[2:16:08] the gifts
[2:16:09] but this same life produces maturity of
[2:16:12] Christ the word
[2:16:13] in The Believer
[2:16:19] I come to do the will of him that sent
[2:16:21] me
[2:16:22] I and my father are one
[2:16:26] these are your words
[2:16:29] they're your words
[2:16:32] when the seed is delivered
[2:16:34] you are the seed delivered
[2:16:37] it
[2:16:38] it said I come to do the will of him
[2:16:41] that sent me how many Heroes come to do
[2:16:43] the will of him that sent you
[2:16:46] the rest of you can do your own will
[2:16:52] thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:16:54] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:57] because he can get you
[2:17:04] he says
[2:17:07] and I am my father are one
[2:17:10] how many of you and God are one
[2:17:14] the rest of you God can make you one
[2:17:18] you don't have to raise your hand I'm
[2:17:20] just not trying to be so heavy on you
[2:17:24] if I do not the if I do not his Works
[2:17:27] Believe Me Not
[2:17:30] there was the seed
[2:17:32] which one of you can condemn me of
[2:17:34] unbelief
[2:17:36] what the Bible has promised
[2:17:38] I would do
[2:17:41] I done it
[2:17:44] now hasn't the Bible
[2:17:47] promised you
[2:17:50] that you're going to be the elect mature
[2:17:53] seed word of God little Messiahs
[2:17:58] and to do the works that he did also
[2:18:02] you know he did very little works in the
[2:18:04] synagogue
[2:18:07] because the Sinners weren't there
[2:18:12] we're reading down right
[2:18:15] notice
[2:18:17] he says
[2:18:19] but the seed in Mary the shuck
[2:18:24] it was close to being that
[2:18:28] but it wasn't
[2:18:32] it was still in the womb
[2:18:36] so can you imagine that here's all this
[2:18:39] movement of the spirit it is the life
[2:18:43] but the seed is still in the womb of
[2:18:45] that
[2:18:47] do you understand
[2:18:48] it's hard
[2:18:50] for the womb
[2:18:53] to let go
[2:18:56] of the sea
[2:18:59] now I don't have that experience but I
[2:19:02] should get amen from every mother in
[2:19:04] here
[2:19:08] it's hard there's what did we just read
[2:19:12] we just read in Galatians there's a
[2:19:14] travail
[2:19:17] it doesn't want to move from the life
[2:19:20] that it had in the shock
[2:19:24] where that spoke in tongues where it
[2:19:26] prophesied where it worked Deliverance
[2:19:28] where it had the movements and the
[2:19:30] movement of the spirit and everything
[2:19:33] was flowing and they felt that was God
[2:19:36] but it was hard for the shock
[2:19:41] to give Deliverance to the true seed
[2:19:50] and to come forth
[2:19:54] and become what it was in the womb
[2:19:59] to do
[2:20:02] was to produce the genuine
[2:20:05] son of God again
[2:20:10] we had the son of God
[2:20:13] but what was he missing
[2:20:15] he was missing his Eve
[2:20:18] because he was a two-part
[2:20:21] being in the beginning
[2:20:24] so he was missing his second part
[2:20:29] because without you he's not made
[2:20:31] perfect and without him we're not made
[2:20:34] perfect but the shock didn't want to
[2:20:37] give it up
[2:20:40] they wanted to birth
[2:20:42] that works now you say the word the
[2:20:46] bride is the word
[2:20:48] because her in the bridegroom are one
[2:20:52] didn't want to birth her out or she
[2:20:54] could come United totally with him in an
[2:20:57] invisible Union and become the word
[2:21:01] but notice he said notice Pentecost age
[2:21:05] it was still in the womb but notice in
[2:21:07] the Pentecostal age through the Luther
[2:21:09] age through the Wesley age it seemed to
[2:21:12] be the same thing through this
[2:21:14] Pentecostal age
[2:21:16] now notice
[2:21:18] but at the opening of The Seven Seals
[2:21:21] Revelations 10 the full word is to be
[2:21:26] born into manifestation again
[2:21:33] the full word
[2:21:35] is to be born into manifestation again
[2:21:38] not the shock
[2:21:43] but the full word is to be born
[2:21:47] who is that full word
[2:21:52] who has been predestinated who has been
[2:21:55] elected who has been chosen
[2:22:00] I have
[2:22:03] Hallelujah
[2:22:05] are you against anything I'm not against
[2:22:07] anything I'm only for my election
[2:22:12] I want to be what he wants me to be well
[2:22:16] he's elected and chosen me to be
[2:22:19] the full word born into manifestation
[2:22:22] again and Vindicated by the spirit of
[2:22:25] God in the full strength as it was when
[2:22:30] he was here on Earth
[2:22:36] manifested the same way
[2:22:39] doing the same things that it did when
[2:22:42] it was here on Earth amen Hebrews 13 8
[2:22:46] Jesus Christ the same
[2:22:50] yesterday
[2:22:54] today
[2:22:56] and forever
[2:22:59] Luke 17 30 said in the last days as it
[2:23:02] was in the days of Sodom when the son of
[2:23:05] man will be revealing himself again
[2:23:07] it'll be the same thing
[2:23:11] the world's in a Sodom condition and the
[2:23:14] churches went into Sodom
[2:23:16] with it like Lot's wife
[2:23:19] and I say that there is a elect church
[2:23:24] somewhere
[2:23:26] in this world
[2:23:28] that's pulling out and set aside from
[2:23:32] those things and the manifestation of
[2:23:35] God has attracted its attention
[2:23:39] we're at the last days the shut
[2:23:44] has given forth its strength into the
[2:23:47] seed
[2:23:48] it when uh it went on out it was a good
[2:23:52] shock
[2:23:54] but it served its time see it is word
[2:23:58] Bride of the word
[2:24:01] groom
[2:24:03] God bless you this morning
[2:24:06] God bless you accept your election
[2:24:10] accept your positioning in Christ accept
[2:24:14] the life that you can live
[2:24:16] don't defeat yourself
[2:24:19] if you don't have that life
[2:24:22] it's yours
[2:24:23] claim it
[2:24:27] not by some laying on of hands
[2:24:30] not by some feeling not by some
[2:24:33] repentance but by revelation
[2:24:38] of your election
[2:24:40] this is mine because I've been elected
[2:24:45] to have it I'm going to take it and it's
[2:24:49] going to produce in me
[2:24:51] The Works that he did also
[2:24:54] it's the same life
[2:24:58] but one is maturing
[2:25:00] let's mature
[2:25:03] and you know how I feel about this
[2:25:05] message
[2:25:06] the only place that maturity lies is in
[2:25:09] the message of God's word God bless you
