[45:04] not dependent upon the weather we're not
[45:06] dependent upon situation
[45:09] trials or tribulations
[45:11] to think that that would affect your
[45:14] outlook towards your brine for lord even
[45:16] though the trials come and the storm

[45:21] in us lord that is a sick fence called

[45:33] you lord and we know that this light
[45:36] affliction on this side lord

[45:44] father we just trust that this would be
[45:47] another step in that direction tonight

[45:54] sheep lord to your bride

[47:01] sisters in christ and i'm i'm thankful
[47:03] that we're not the only flock
[47:05] but we have brothers and sisters all
[47:07] over the world that are fighting and
[47:09] standing for this message with all
[47:10] that's in them amen so we'll just be
[47:13] reading out of genesis
[47:16] chapter one
[47:24] says in the beginning
[47:25] god created the heaven and the earth
[47:28] and the earth was without form
[47:31] and void
[47:32] and darkness was upon the face of the
[47:34] deep and the spirit of god moved upon
[47:36] the face of the waters
[47:38] and god said let there be light
[47:40] and there was light amen you may have
[47:42] your seats
[47:43] also we want to read out of john chapter
[47:45] nine
[47:49] just have a little
[47:51] fellowship with you tonight we won't be
[47:53] long
[48:00] and how many is thankful to have another
[48:02] opportunity to come into the house of
[48:03] god amen
[48:04] praise the lord well if you come
[48:06] expecting
[48:08] expect that your expectations are
[48:10] exceeded
[48:12] if you've come expecting not to get much
[48:15] you're not going to get much
[48:18] but i'm thankful god is not limited by
[48:20] man and man's ability
[48:22] uh because certainly there's nothing in
[48:24] myself that i could do for you that
[48:26] would
[48:27] would uh cause the perfection that god
[48:29] is calling in your life
[48:30] uh but if we're we're looking past
[48:33] the veil and we're looking to the unseen
[48:36] then we know
[48:37] that god can do something for you amen
[48:40] just reading now out of john
[48:42] 9 and we'll just read verse 1 through 5.
[48:45] it says and jesus passed by and saw a
[48:47] man which was blind from his birth
[48:50] and his disciples asked him saying
[48:51] master who did sin
[48:53] this man or his parents that he was born
[48:56] blind and jesus answered and said
[48:57] neither had this man's sin nor his
[48:59] parents
[49:00] but that the works of god
[49:02] should be made manifest in him
[49:06] so i want you to focus on that that
[49:08] there here's this man that's in a
[49:10] condition
[49:11] he's born blind and here the disciples
[49:13] are asking jesus why is he in this
[49:16] condition
[49:18] what what caused that was it his own sin
[49:20] or was it his parent's sin but i love
[49:24] the response here by the lord he says
[49:27] that neither hath this man sin nor his
[49:29] parents but that the works of god should
[49:31] be made manifest in him
[49:34] i must work the works of him that sent
[49:36] me while while it is day the night
[49:38] cometh when no man can work as long as i
[49:42] am in the world i am the light
[49:45] of the world
[49:46] and also let's just read out of first
[49:48] john 1 5.
[49:56] after reading these portions of
[49:58] scriptures i believe we all can say it
[49:59] was good
[50:01] when they said unto me let's go to the
[50:03] house of the lord
[50:06] first john
[50:08] 1
[50:08] we'll read verse
[50:10] 5 through seven it says
[50:12] this then is the message which we have
[50:14] heard of him
[50:16] and declare unto you that god
[50:18] is light
[50:20] and in him is no darkness at all
[50:23] if we say that we have fellowship with
[50:25] him and walk in darkness we lie
[50:28] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[50:30] the light
[50:32] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[50:34] one with another and the blood of jesus
[50:36] christ his son cleanses us
[50:38] from all sin
[50:40] amen now i want to just read this quote
[50:43] to you just to maybe lay a little
[50:45] foundation to where we uh pray that the
[50:48] lord will take us tonight uh the prophet
[50:51] of god is uh this is out of the
[50:53] countdown message he's going to be
[50:54] referring to hebrews 11 3 which says
[50:57] through faith we understand that the
[50:58] word worlds were framed by the word of
[51:01] god so the things which are seen were
[51:04] not made of things that which do appear
[51:06] and he says you know with all the things
[51:09] did you hear what the scripture said the
[51:11] things that are
[51:13] we see were made of things that was not
[51:16] because it was the word of god who spoke
[51:18] things into existence
[51:21] the world that we are sitting upon today
[51:24] the chairs that we're sitting in
[51:26] the floor that's beneath us
[51:29] the dirt the trees everything is nothing
[51:33] but the interpretation of the word of
[51:36] god
[51:37] when god interprets it when it happens
[51:39] that reveals it let there be
[51:42] and there was
[51:44] let there be and there was and maybe
[51:46] that would be the thought that i want to
[51:47] speak along to you tonight is let there
[51:49] be
[51:50] and there was
[51:52] we know in the beginning god created the
[51:54] heavens and the earth and we know that
[51:56] he created the heavens and the earth by
[51:58] the spoken word and and and if you could
[52:00] just maybe see as this uh would maybe
[52:02] unfold their their god is elohim the
[52:05] self-existing one and and there that
[52:07] logos is and from that god is going to
[52:10] say let there be
[52:12] and maybe my if we were there with with
[52:14] him in the beginning and we were
[52:16] standing there and and maybe uh god
[52:19] would say let there be stars
[52:21] and maybe there would be this uh a
[52:24] wonder my the lord has spoken let there
[52:27] be stars and and maybe we might wonder
[52:29] amongst ourselves well what would that
[52:31] look like what would that be but all of
[52:33] a sudden there came stars into existence
[52:36] and we would be able to say oh
[52:37] that's what the father intended when he
[52:40] said let there be stars and there are
[52:41] stars and he said let there be moons and
[52:44] there was moons and and out of out of
[52:46] that very mind of god out of the very
[52:48] thoughts of god this these very thoughts
[52:51] that he had to himself and now he's
[52:53] speaking the word and saying let there
[52:56] be
[52:57] and he said let there be and there was
[53:00] let there be a moon and there was let
[53:02] there be an earth and let there be
[53:03] planets but i thought about these things
[53:06] and and here he said let there be an
[53:08] earth
[53:09] and there was an earth but you know the
[53:11] earth was just maybe this peculiar thing
[53:14] in all of the galaxies because he said
[53:16] let let there be an earth but yet in
[53:19] this creation of earth it says in the
[53:21] beginning god created the heavens and
[53:24] the earth but it says the earth was
[53:25] without form and it was void
[53:29] am i just thinking of creation
[53:32] let there be
[53:34] my let there be galaxies and let there
[53:37] be stars can can you just think that
[53:39] god's creation stretches from eternity
[53:41] to eternity
[53:43] try to even start in your mind to just
[53:46] just try to to to grasp
[53:49] the creation of god
[53:52] i mean in into and to think that here
[53:54] god is a uh has stretched the heavens
[53:56] he's spoken every star into existence
[54:01] and then tried to compare that to man's
[54:03] efforts
[54:04] just think of a man even trying to count
[54:07] the stars
[54:08] think of man even trying to name the
[54:10] stars
[54:11] oh oh man could
[54:13] could live forever and he would never be
[54:15] able to even exhaust or to name the
[54:17] stars
[54:19] oh my that's what about the droplets in
[54:21] the ocean and every cloud and every
[54:23] blade of grass and every piece of said
[54:25] oh to even to even try to even start to
[54:27] comprehend the mind of god
[54:31] oh his ways are past finding out
[54:36] even that would exhaust all of man's
[54:38] efforts
[54:40] and i'm reminded of the story there that
[54:42] that's told of an old tale about how man
[54:44] had come so far and
[54:46] and you know they they had started to
[54:48] invent things and they had started to to
[54:50] to tap into technologies and electricity
[54:53] and you know they started to go to space
[54:55] and all of these things and you know man
[54:57] just finally told god you know what we
[54:59] got it
[55:01] we we can handle it from here we're
[55:03] pretty good on our own they said you
[55:05] know what we're just getting along just
[55:07] fine i mean we can clone humans we can
[55:09] we can we can clone animals we we're
[55:12] we're pretty much creators ourselves we
[55:13] can do whatever we want
[55:15] you know this little joke goes as it was
[55:17] and god said to the man he said well
[55:19] okay well why don't we just why don't we
[55:21] why don't we just put that to the test
[55:24] why don't why don't we see who can
[55:26] create a man and a scientist they say
[55:28] well this is no problem we we've already
[55:30] done this we we we we can do that we've
[55:33] done this several times and so the
[55:35] showdown went to happen and and god went
[55:37] to get some dirt and the scientists went
[55:39] to get some dirt and god looked at him
[55:40] said no wait a second
[55:43] get your own dirt
[55:46] oh see everything that man has been able
[55:49] to accomplish oh it's only because they
[55:52] are part of this very creation that god
[55:55] has created and i i looked at this quote
[55:57] i thought it was very interesting of
[55:59] this astronomer american astronomer
[56:01] named carl sagan he said to really make
[56:03] an apple pie from scratch
[56:05] you must begin by inventing the universe
[56:09] i thought well that's very well said
[56:13] my what is what is man
[56:15] david would say it like this he would
[56:16] say when i consider the heavens
[56:19] psalms 8 verse 3 and 4 the works of thy
[56:22] fingers the moon and the stars which
[56:24] thou hast ordained what is man that thou
[56:27] art mindful of him and the son of man
[56:30] that thou visited him oh i just say just
[56:32] look around
[56:33] you want to see god look he's made
[56:35] visible you can see the unseen by the
[56:37] the things that are visible around us
[56:39] you want to see god look at the moon
[56:41] look at the stars look at the very
[56:42] blades of grass that you would you would
[56:44] pass over every single day
[56:48] why it's all his handiwork it's all the
[56:50] very uh imprint of god it's all of all
[56:53] of his creation that if we would just
[56:55] take a little bit of a moment
[56:57] i know we live in the city and it's loud
[56:59] and it's noisy and there's skyscrapers
[57:01] everywhere but uh every once in a while
[57:03] let me just
[57:05] take a little step back and look up
[57:06] sometimes when the
[57:08] the sky is full of clouds
[57:11] and i don't know sometimes i feel like a
[57:12] little a kid gazing up there and just
[57:15] these huge just white billowing uh just
[57:18] white as snow clouds just just hanging
[57:21] up there in my they just oh oh it just
[57:24] looks so wonderful and you can just look
[57:26] up there and say my goodness god is so
[57:29] awesome such a creator but we see what
[57:32] man has done by tapping into the tree of
[57:34] knowledge he's caused destruction and
[57:36] death and and he's covered up god's
[57:38] creation with concrete and he stripped
[57:41] all the minerals out of it and and all
[57:43] the earth is coming into a place of
[57:45] birth pains and the prophet of god said
[57:47] it can't take another one where we're at
[57:48] the very final climax that the next one
[57:51] i'll tell you this this is going to be
[57:52] rent it's going to be purged by fire uh
[57:55] the whole world is groaning for the
[57:57] manifestation of the sons of god and
[58:00] we're right here at that climactic point
[58:02] that any moment that that it's going to
[58:04] burst forth and come into a new creation
[58:07] and we're going to be taken out of here
[58:09] and the prophet of god would say this
[58:10] out of there is a man here that could
[58:12] turn out the light which pulling our
[58:14] inspiration from he says in the
[58:15] beginning god created the heavens and
[58:17] the earth
[58:19] it might have been a hundred million or
[58:21] billion or whatever it was
[58:23] and how he done it that's up to him to
[58:25] know see not to me
[58:27] but the world well the earth was without
[58:30] form and void and the water was upon the
[58:32] earth and god said
[58:34] moved upon the water and said let there
[58:35] be light
[58:36] now i believe that the sun
[58:38] watch this now now i believe that the
[58:41] sun
[58:41] and so forth was already in existence
[58:46] i believe the moon
[58:47] as it goes on
[58:50] genesis 3 explained but i believe that
[58:52] there here the world was that he was
[58:55] going to use and therefore it it
[58:58] it moved in and there was a fog and a
[59:00] mist all over the earth making it dark
[59:05] and god said let there be light
[59:07] and the darkness faded away
[59:09] and there was a cloudless sky
[59:11] and i believe that's god's way of doing
[59:14] things
[59:15] in the bible the next verse says the
[59:17] fourth verse says and he separated the
[59:19] light from the darkness
[59:21] and the light he called day and the
[59:24] darkness he called night
[59:26] and god's word always separates light
[59:30] from darkness see
[59:31] it's the word that does the separating
[59:34] light
[59:35] from darkness so notice that
[59:37] point that he's making there that the
[59:39] earth the sun the moon the stars they
[59:41] were all in existence but we find out
[59:45] here the earth is sitting there and it's
[59:47] it it's without form and it's void
[59:51] and i just want to maybe take some time
[59:53] here and just that word form and void it
[59:55] actually means confusion
[59:57] it means emptiness
[59:59] it means a wasteland or a wilderness it
[1:00:02] actually means a place of chaos
[1:00:05] so there was a fog and a mist all over
[1:00:08] the earth making it dark
[1:00:11] and when god said let there be light
[1:00:12] that darkness it faded away but what i
[1:00:15] want to in taking this time to lay a
[1:00:17] little foundation here is we want to be
[1:00:19] able to see a type here that's laying in
[1:00:21] the scripture where we can actually see
[1:00:23] the condition of the age
[1:00:25] we could actually see the condition of
[1:00:27] an individual
[1:00:28] or a seed
[1:00:30] and we could also see the condition of a
[1:00:32] situation
[1:00:34] so we can actually see the condition of
[1:00:36] the age chaos
[1:00:39] darkness
[1:00:41] a fog
[1:00:42] obscurity
[1:00:44] and then maybe that seed laying there in
[1:00:46] the earth as as being a son or daughter
[1:00:49] of god there being this darkness and
[1:00:51] this fog over their life
[1:00:54] in a condition that it cannot manifest
[1:00:57] what it is and then maybe we can move
[1:01:00] along in our thinking and maybe think
[1:01:01] about a trial or a test or something
[1:01:04] you're believing for and it just seems
[1:01:06] like uh you don't know how it's ever
[1:01:09] gonna happen or how it's ever gonna be
[1:01:11] fulfilled and in your mind you're
[1:01:13] getting weary and you're believing and
[1:01:14] you feel like time is moving on and and
[1:01:17] oh it just maybe seems like there's this
[1:01:19] fog or this uncertainty that is
[1:01:22] surrounding your your situation but
[1:01:24] god's word always separates the light
[1:01:26] from the darkness it's the word that
[1:01:29] does the separating and i just want to
[1:01:31] say that the condition is for a purpose
[1:01:34] well if you can take any strength or any
[1:01:36] encouragement tonight to know that
[1:01:38] wherever you're at in life good or bad i
[1:01:41] want to tell you that the condition is
[1:01:43] for a purpose
[1:01:45] go ahead and i don't care what it is you
[1:01:47] feel like your life is in shambles and
[1:01:48] you feel like you should never be where
[1:01:50] you are well maybe that could be true
[1:01:52] maybe you have ended up in a condition
[1:01:54] and maybe you made a lot of bad
[1:01:56] decisions and maybe maybe you ran right
[1:01:58] through all of the doors that god was
[1:02:00] putting in your way and he put roadblock
[1:02:02] after roadblock after roadblock and now
[1:02:04] you find yourself in a position now
[1:02:07] where you're actually suffering the
[1:02:09] consequences of being a disobedient
[1:02:11] child what i love about god is he says
[1:02:14] there in romans 8 28 he would say all
[1:02:17] things work out together to the good for
[1:02:19] those who are who who love him and are
[1:02:22] called according to his purpose oh that
[1:02:24] could give the seed on the inside a true
[1:02:26] child of god some confidence to know
[1:02:28] that those i love i rebuke and i chasten
[1:02:31] but if i can just surrender myself now
[1:02:33] to your god and know that i've done a
[1:02:35] lot of things that i shouldn't have done
[1:02:37] and i realize that i'm suffering some of
[1:02:39] the consequences of not being obedient
[1:02:42] to your word but lord god you said that
[1:02:44] everything
[1:02:46] works out to the good for those who love
[1:02:48] you and are called according to your
[1:02:50] purpose and as paul would go on to say
[1:02:52] in that very scripture you say what can
[1:02:54] we say to these things then oh
[1:02:56] hallelujah the devil wants to try to run
[1:02:58] you down he wants to try to make you
[1:03:00] feel like you're insignificant he wants
[1:03:02] to keep pointing back to your past and
[1:03:04] your failures and how many times you've
[1:03:06] tried and you've fallen but oh if we can
[1:03:08] only say like paul said oh if god before
[1:03:11] us who could be against us that's what
[1:03:13] we should say to these things when the
[1:03:15] devil tries to buff at you and your
[1:03:17] situation looks dark or you're looking
[1:03:19] at the condition of the age and it just
[1:03:20] seems like darkness is all around oh if
[1:03:23] god before you who can be against you i
[1:03:25] want you to be encouraged that the
[1:03:27] condition is for a purpose there is a
[1:03:29] reason for it and as we just read in our
[1:03:31] text there in the opening about john 9
[1:03:34] what a a wonderful place in the
[1:03:36] scripture about this man who was born
[1:03:38] blind even there as this chapter would
[1:03:40] open up and the disciples would say to
[1:03:42] jesus they would say what caused this
[1:03:44] man to be blind was it the sin of his
[1:03:45] parents or was it his own sin you can
[1:03:48] even see in the question that these
[1:03:49] disciples who are following after the
[1:03:51] lord they're actually wondering in the
[1:03:52] self showing that this the very
[1:03:54] condition of this man there's this
[1:03:56] obscurity or this darkness or this
[1:03:59] wondering of why would he be in such a
[1:04:01] condition why would he be this way and i
[1:04:04] want you to tell you that just as the
[1:04:06] earth there was this darkness or this
[1:04:08] was there was this obscurity upon the
[1:04:11] earth you know many times we find
[1:04:13] ourselves in situations where we don't
[1:04:14] know which way to go
[1:04:17] and i want to maybe encourage you
[1:04:19] tonight because maybe maybe you're
[1:04:21] watching your child
[1:04:23] maybe you're watching your child and the
[1:04:24] decisions she's making and you're
[1:04:26] starting to wonder you know why it just
[1:04:28] seems like like uh where they're at in
[1:04:30] their life and the decisions that
[1:04:32] they're making it just it just seems
[1:04:34] like there's this uncertainty and
[1:04:36] there's this fog around them and what
[1:04:38] what are the consequences gonna be what
[1:04:41] is going to happen and maybe in your in
[1:04:43] your heart you you're being broken
[1:04:45] because it seems like they're making
[1:04:46] decisions and you don't want them to go
[1:04:48] that way and you you've done your best
[1:04:50] to instruct and to teach and and with
[1:04:52] everything in your heart you've been
[1:04:54] praying and believing and and you just
[1:04:56] maybe see this
[1:04:58] this situation and this this fog and
[1:05:00] maybe this obscurity are surrounding to
[1:05:02] them and it seems like oh it doesn't
[1:05:04] seem like which way are they gonna go
[1:05:06] and you're praying and believing and or
[1:05:08] maybe you're a young person and you find
[1:05:10] yourself and
[1:05:12] and you're now just coming of age and
[1:05:14] and you're coming to where you're making
[1:05:15] decisions and you're and you have
[1:05:17] interest and you have desires and
[1:05:19] and maybe there's a young person you're
[1:05:21] interested in or or maybe now you're
[1:05:23] you're a young man or a young woman and
[1:05:26] you you have a career and there's
[1:05:28] decisions that you need to make and
[1:05:29] there's all of these things that are
[1:05:31] pulling on you
[1:05:33] all of these decisions and and all of
[1:05:35] these distractions and you hear the word
[1:05:37] saying one thing but you you feel the
[1:05:39] world pulling this way and and maybe
[1:05:41] you're in a little uh obscurity and it
[1:05:44] doesn't have to be sin it doesn't have
[1:05:45] to maybe be darkness in a way uh that
[1:05:48] you're living in sin but it could be
[1:05:49] this just uncertainty and you're
[1:05:51] wondering which way to go lord where
[1:05:53] should i live what direction should i go
[1:05:55] and maybe you feel this just uneasiness
[1:05:57] and and you're calling out to god and
[1:05:59] you say lord i need your leadership
[1:06:01] right now in my life i i don't
[1:06:03] understand i need to make these
[1:06:04] decisions should i take this job should
[1:06:06] i should i move over there lord but it
[1:06:08] seems like it's taken me out of
[1:06:10] fellowship and you want to be led i want
[1:06:12] to encourage you tonight that that
[1:06:14] condition
[1:06:16] that situation
[1:06:18] that you are facing
[1:06:20] is that the works of god might be made
[1:06:22] manifest in your life
[1:06:25] that is the purpose of the condition oh
[1:06:27] for the believing parent i want you to
[1:06:29] know maybe you look out and i don't care
[1:06:31] if it's been one month or it's been five
[1:06:33] years and you see a fog or you see a
[1:06:36] darkness that's been setting over your
[1:06:38] child i want you to know that that
[1:06:40] purpose that condition is for a purpose
[1:06:43] because as a believing mother and as a
[1:06:45] believing father that the works of god
[1:06:48] might be manifested and that child
[1:06:50] because you have enough faith for
[1:06:51] salvation you can have enough faith for
[1:06:54] your children and now that condition is
[1:06:56] only persisting that the very word of
[1:06:59] god the very works of god could be made
[1:07:02] manifest in your child's life and i say
[1:07:04] you're coming to a place of maturity
[1:07:06] where the word is coming to perfection
[1:07:09] in you because now you are the light of
[1:07:12] the world and as that word is now taking
[1:07:14] on flesh you have a right by the
[1:07:17] scripture to speak the word and say let
[1:07:19] it be
[1:07:20] let it be all you might as well get the
[1:07:22] water and the baptism already because
[1:07:25] the word is speaking go on and speak
[1:07:27] deliverance for your children go on and
[1:07:29] speak healing for your body go on and
[1:07:31] say let it be because it's not you
[1:07:34] speaking it's god speaking that's what
[1:07:37] the message has brought in this end time
[1:07:39] is a union between god and man once
[1:07:42] again and we've seen one that come to
[1:07:44] that maturity that could stand there and
[1:07:46] speak the word and watch that spoken
[1:07:48] word materialize right before your eyes
[1:07:51] and i say god that's going to bribe in
[1:07:54] this end time to take the word and be
[1:07:56] able to speak it and watch it
[1:07:58] materialize
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:01] oh we're going back to eden saints this
[1:08:04] is redemption this is the fullness of
[1:08:06] redemption oh the very things that are
[1:08:09] unseen are now being made visible
[1:08:11] amongst you
[1:08:15] oh the condition
[1:08:18] is for a purpose
[1:08:21] you might not be able to see the light
[1:08:22] at the end of the tunnel
[1:08:27] but by faith
[1:08:28] oh praise god for faith brother billy
[1:08:32] praise god for faith
[1:08:35] that can call things that are not
[1:08:37] as though they are
[1:08:39] well i think what we ought to do is we
[1:08:40] ought to start practicing brother moses
[1:08:43] we ought to start calling things that
[1:08:45] are not as though they are
[1:08:47] that's not a scripture laying there just
[1:08:50] to be glossed over but that's a
[1:08:52] scripture for the elect in the end time
[1:08:55] to take that word into their bosom and
[1:08:57] under the anointing of the holy ghost to
[1:09:00] take the word of speak
[1:09:02] speak the word
[1:09:04] speak and go forward
[1:09:06] watch that mountain move
[1:09:11] oh hallelujah
[1:09:14] matthew 21 would say
[1:09:16] if you say unto this mountain
[1:09:18] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:09:21] the sea
[1:09:22] it shall be done
[1:09:24] oh my glory to god you know the
[1:09:26] denominationals pick that up
[1:09:29] and they use that as just a wonderful
[1:09:31] figure of speech
[1:09:34] and certainly oh it can be preached that
[1:09:36] way and there's nothing wrong with that
[1:09:40] maybe i might just do that for a moment
[1:09:42] whatever your mountain is
[1:09:45] well what is your mountain
[1:09:47] is it school is it finances
[1:09:50] is it your marriage
[1:09:52] is it an education
[1:09:54] i don't know what your mountain is
[1:09:58] we can look at that figuratively and
[1:10:00] it's very applicable
[1:10:02] but
[1:10:03] that was not the intention of that
[1:10:06] scripture to be just left as a
[1:10:08] figurative example
[1:10:10] because god always reveals his word by
[1:10:13] bringing it to pass if you say to this
[1:10:16] mountain
[1:10:17] to be plucked up and placed over into
[1:10:19] the sea god didn't leave that scripture
[1:10:21] dormant but he actually brought one in
[1:10:24] the end time who could take that very
[1:10:26] word and would be facing a storm up on
[1:10:29] the mountain that was certain death and
[1:10:31] he would turn around to go down to low
[1:10:33] ground because that's where safety was
[1:10:36] that's where life was that was the way
[1:10:38] to get away from the storm because to
[1:10:40] stay up on the mountain would be certain
[1:10:42] death but there was a voice that spoke
[1:10:44] to him and said turn around
[1:10:47] and that prophet had been trained he had
[1:10:49] been tested he had been tried to know
[1:10:52] that even in the face of death no matter
[1:10:54] what it is you be obedient to the word
[1:10:57] of god that's speaking to you you might
[1:10:59] lose your family you might lose your
[1:11:01] friends you might lose your job you
[1:11:03] might lose your car you might lose your
[1:11:06] health you might lose your life but if
[1:11:08] god is speaking to you oh to be obedient
[1:11:11] to that word what profitable man if he
[1:11:14] gains the whole world and loses his soul
[1:11:18] and he returns and now he's going to
[1:11:20] walk right in to the face of that storm
[1:11:26] now he's there and and he's waiting what
[1:11:29] to do next he's been obedient and and
[1:11:31] now the storm is ripping through there
[1:11:32] and the trees all the tops are about to
[1:11:35] come off of him
[1:11:36] and he says i am the god that created
[1:11:38] the heavens and the earth
[1:11:41] oh lord is that you
[1:11:44] is that you that's speaking to me
[1:11:46] oh what would you have me to do
[1:11:49] i have created the heavens and the earth
[1:11:52] i am the voice that calmed the waters
[1:11:55] i'm the one that stealed the troubled
[1:11:57] sea
[1:11:59] you speak to the storm
[1:12:01] whatever you say it'll be just the way
[1:12:05] that you say
[1:12:07] oh hallelujah what was god doing he was
[1:12:10] now taking a word that had been spoken
[1:12:14] and laying in the bible but now a mature
[1:12:17] son that had been predestinated in the
[1:12:19] end time to pick up that word and come
[1:12:22] into his position as a son of god and he
[1:12:25] would be able to speak the word and say
[1:12:27] let it be
[1:12:29] let it be let that storm dry up and go
[1:12:33] this way let the sun shine for four days
[1:12:38] let it go back let it be and it was
[1:12:41] why because now there was a son of god
[1:12:44] standing on the earth again holding the
[1:12:47] title book deed of redemption fullness
[1:12:50] of redemption all that adam had lost
[1:12:53] have been given back man had dominion
[1:12:57] over the earth again
[1:13:00] oh
[1:13:01] let it be
[1:13:02] and it was god is calling you to this
[1:13:05] type of maturity he's calling you to
[1:13:07] this type of perfection
[1:13:12] oh the scripture would say greater is he
[1:13:15] that is in you
[1:13:17] why don't you say it with me greater is
[1:13:19] he
[1:13:20] that is in you
[1:13:22] greater is he
[1:13:23] that is in you
[1:13:25] well who is the he the word is talking
[1:13:28] about
[1:13:30] greater is he
[1:13:32] he ain't talking about your mama
[1:13:35] he ain't talking about your daddy he
[1:13:37] ain't talking about your brother he
[1:13:39] ain't talking about your sister greater
[1:13:42] is he
[1:13:43] the creator of heavens and earth the
[1:13:46] same god that was with noah the same god
[1:13:49] that was with moses the same god that
[1:13:51] dropped down like a pillar of fire and
[1:13:53] come upon the word made flesh oh the
[1:13:56] same god that was with brother branham
[1:13:58] it's the same god that is in you
[1:14:02] oh if thou canst believe all things are
[1:14:05] possible greater is he that is in you
[1:14:08] than he that is in the world
[1:14:11] oh what can the church of god do when
[1:14:14] they get ahold of that revelation when
[1:14:16] you realize that elohim god has called
[1:14:19] you and spoke in his word that a very
[1:14:21] portion of his zoe life would be in you
[1:14:24] greater is he that isn't you
[1:14:28] oh friends who isn't living then
[1:14:32] it is not i that liveth
[1:14:34] but christ
[1:14:36] that liveth in me
[1:14:38] oh get our ways off the ways of flesh
[1:14:40] get our ways off the ways of man it's
[1:14:43] the very word that's calling you to
[1:14:45] maturity the very word that's calling
[1:14:47] you to perfection
[1:14:50] oh hallelujah
[1:14:52] jeremiah would say it like this in 11 he
[1:14:56] was sorry for i know my thoughts that i
[1:14:57] think towards you saith the lord
[1:14:59] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:15:01] give you an expected end
[1:15:04] oh you know you're the thoughts of god
[1:15:07] prophet would say it like this that of
[1:15:08] god is his own interpreter
[1:15:11] what i mean
[1:15:13] attributes
[1:15:14] was his thoughts
[1:15:17] and a word is a thought expressed
[1:15:20] and then
[1:15:22] that was in his thinking
[1:15:24] and when he said let there be and there
[1:15:26] was
[1:15:27] let there be and there was and now
[1:15:29] remember you christians here he
[1:15:31] christians were his thoughts before
[1:15:34] there was a world and now remember you
[1:15:36] christians where his thoughts before
[1:15:38] there was a world and you are the
[1:15:40] manifestation of his thinking oh i like
[1:15:43] that
[1:15:44] you are the manifestation of his
[1:15:46] thinking before there even was a world
[1:15:49] you were in christ amen and god in the
[1:15:52] beginning that makes you then you see
[1:15:54] his subject and the whole thing watch
[1:15:57] this now
[1:15:58] the whole thing
[1:16:00] the prophet just boiled this all down
[1:16:01] we're coming down to a funnel
[1:16:03] this is all funneling down the whole
[1:16:05] thing brother
[1:16:06] this is all funneling down
[1:16:10] the whole thing is god
[1:16:12] himself
[1:16:14] materializing himself tangible
[1:16:17] so he could be handled seen and so forth
[1:16:19] and that
[1:16:21] and that's what god is the whole thing
[1:16:24] oh just like the the disciples would be
[1:16:26] able to write to write and say oh we
[1:16:28] touched it we handled the very word of
[1:16:29] life that was made flesh now god has
[1:16:32] caught a bride in the end time that now
[1:16:34] also is the word made flesh you're the
[1:16:37] very bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:16:39] flesh you're the very attributes of god
[1:16:43] look come on there's no guesswork in it
[1:16:47] you might not even know who you are
[1:16:50] you might be wondering who you are but
[1:16:52] according to the word of god and god's
[1:16:54] thoughts that have already been spoken
[1:16:56] concerning you i know my thoughts that i
[1:16:59] think towards you thoughts of peace and
[1:17:00] not of evil to bring you to an expected
[1:17:02] look what you are and who you are where
[1:17:05] you came from and where you are going
[1:17:07] it's already sealed
[1:17:10] it's already settled it's already been
[1:17:12] determined in the thinking of god you
[1:17:15] might be trying to wonder and to figure
[1:17:17] out and to wonder well who i am and
[1:17:19] where did i come from but no there's no
[1:17:21] chance there's no thinking about it you
[1:17:23] are the very thoughts of god that have
[1:17:25] been manifest the very word that has
[1:17:27] been spoken in the end time but what
[1:17:30] god's wanting to do is he's wanting to
[1:17:32] open your eyes that you can actually see
[1:17:34] what god has spoken concerning you
[1:17:38] that's the purpose of the message
[1:17:41] that's the purpose of the prophet that's
[1:17:42] the purpose of the eagle going out and
[1:17:45] looking for the other egg that it had
[1:17:46] that had hatched out in a barnyard
[1:17:48] that's the purpose of the end time
[1:17:50] message is to find those predestinated
[1:17:53] seeds and to reveal to them where they
[1:17:55] came from and where they're going just
[1:17:57] as brother billy was ministering as this
[1:17:59] prophet would climb up into the very
[1:18:01] mind of god and be able to see even
[1:18:04] before time began we'd be able to see
[1:18:06] eternity to eternity and be able to soar
[1:18:10] out there up into the heavens and bring
[1:18:12] the very mind and thoughts of god and
[1:18:14] say you were with me in the very
[1:18:16] beginning
[1:18:17] you were with me before the world was
[1:18:19] ever formed
[1:18:21] and start to tell you where you came
[1:18:23] from and then start to identify the
[1:18:26] condition of the age and start to show
[1:18:28] us exactly
[1:18:30] the things and events that are going to
[1:18:32] transpire
[1:18:34] and then even go to show you
[1:18:36] where we're going to and a prophet could
[1:18:38] stand there and say oh in his humanity
[1:18:43] being a man he would stand stand there
[1:18:44] and say well
[1:18:46] i feel like this is an irresponsible
[1:18:47] thing to say
[1:18:51] but i believe i've been to both hell
[1:18:54] and heaven
[1:18:58] oh friends
[1:19:00] we're living with an open book
[1:19:03] we don't even have to guess what hell is
[1:19:06] we don't have to guess what heaven is
[1:19:08] but god has revealed his very secret of
[1:19:10] his mind to the bride he's left no
[1:19:13] guesswork all he's asking you to do is
[1:19:16] believe it and that's what the light is
[1:19:18] doing now is it shining forth and the
[1:19:21] spirit of god is moving upon your life
[1:19:23] to clear away the darkness that that
[1:19:25] light can strike the sea that you might
[1:19:27] recognize who you are in the word
[1:19:31] that's right oh my i just i love this
[1:19:34] type that we see in the earth
[1:19:36] because now here the earth is it's
[1:19:38] without form and it's void
[1:19:41] but now this this seed is laying there
[1:19:43] in the earth now think about it all the
[1:19:45] potentials are in that seed
[1:19:49] but there's a veil
[1:19:51] something there's a veil there
[1:19:54] that is preventing this seed from coming
[1:19:57] into its maturity there's something
[1:20:00] preventing the seed from being quickened
[1:20:04] now it's a seed of god because it's
[1:20:06] germatized
[1:20:08] prophet of god goes into that and says
[1:20:09] you know only only the elect can be
[1:20:11] reborn because in non-seed there's
[1:20:13] nothing to quicken so we're not
[1:20:15] questioning whether your seed you are
[1:20:16] sons and daughters of god but there has
[1:20:18] been a veil if you will something that
[1:20:22] has been stretched before of preventing
[1:20:25] that sunlight to strike the seed and
[1:20:28] quicken it to come to life
[1:20:30] now we can look at the condition of the
[1:20:32] world what it was in and it says oh
[1:20:33] there was the earth was without form and
[1:20:36] void and there's now this cloud and
[1:20:37] there's this darkness that is over the
[1:20:39] earth now we could look at that and
[1:20:41] understand that was in the firmaments or
[1:20:43] that was maybe natural but if we now
[1:20:45] take it to the individual maybe it's the
[1:20:46] veil of your humanity
[1:20:49] maybe it's the veil of your tradition
[1:20:51] you know a lot of message believers are
[1:20:53] in bondage to tradition
[1:20:55] maybe ought to say that again a lot of
[1:20:58] so-called message believers are in
[1:21:00] bondage to tradition they have their
[1:21:02] wednesday church service they have their
[1:21:04] sunday church service they have their
[1:21:06] press play but they're not being changed
[1:21:09] they're not being quickened they're not
[1:21:11] coming into an atmosphere and into a
[1:21:14] presence of god where they are the very
[1:21:16] life of god being materialized in this
[1:21:18] earth and now are the light to the world
[1:21:21] no you're just kind of blending in at
[1:21:23] your job you're just kind of blending in
[1:21:25] at your school you're just kind of
[1:21:27] blending in at the mall and everywhere
[1:21:29] you go you're just kind of blending in
[1:21:31] maybe blending in like pentecostals
[1:21:33] maybe blending in like lutherans maybe
[1:21:35] just blending in like you have a bunch
[1:21:37] of tradition but where is the life i
[1:21:39] wonder if there's not a veil of
[1:21:41] tradition that you have stretched forth
[1:21:44] before you and the very word that has
[1:21:46] been spoken in the evening time which is
[1:21:48] the light to bring that seed to maturity
[1:21:51] is being blocked because you feel like
[1:21:53] you've achieved something in yourself
[1:21:55] and you've arrived to a condition that
[1:21:57] you're comfortable with and there's not
[1:21:59] a thirsting there's not a hungering but
[1:22:01] the bible tells me those that first and
[1:22:04] those that hunger they shall be filled i
[1:22:06] pray that there's something in the child
[1:22:08] of god that's not satisfied with where
[1:22:10] they are there's something that's
[1:22:12] hungering and thirsting and saying i
[1:22:15] need more i want more i want to go
[1:22:18] higher i want to go further i want to go
[1:22:21] deeper all that you have for me lord i
[1:22:23] want that oh reveal yourself to me lord
[1:22:26] if there's a veil if there's a veil of
[1:22:28] tradition if there's a veil of
[1:22:30] denomination if there's a veil of an
[1:22:32] attitude come on somebody if there's a
[1:22:34] veil of an attitude towards the word of
[1:22:36] god if there's a veil of an attitude
[1:22:39] towards the man of god if there's a veil
[1:22:41] of an attitude towards the church if
[1:22:44] there's a veil of an attitude a towards
[1:22:46] the song leader if there's a veil of an
[1:22:48] attitude a torture brother or your
[1:22:50] sister you are being veiled from the
[1:22:53] very light of god and light brings life
[1:22:56] and you are void of the spirit of god
[1:22:59] moving in your life
[1:23:00] i say oh god we need something to come
[1:23:04] we need something to come and rip away
[1:23:06] the veil that the light of the s-o-n can
[1:23:09] shine into our souls and quicken that
[1:23:11] seed to life
[1:23:15] oh but we're veiled
[1:23:17] veiled by tradition veiled by humanity
[1:23:20] veiled by our attitude towards the word
[1:23:22] veiled by our own ideas
[1:23:25] oh ain't got to be sinful ideas
[1:23:27] we can even be veiled by our ambitions
[1:23:31] we got our life so pre-scheduled
[1:23:35] god's wanting to move in your life
[1:23:38] wanting you to to be in fellowship he's
[1:23:41] wanting to move in your life
[1:23:42] you're sorry god i'm actually let me see
[1:23:45] what i got what day i got available
[1:23:47] um i got school today
[1:23:49] i got church wednesday i got church
[1:23:51] sunday all the friends are coming over i
[1:23:53] know they're on friday
[1:23:55] um lord i think maybe
[1:23:57] you what do you got going on next month
[1:23:58] lord i think maybe let's just see if we
[1:24:00] can oh come on now
[1:24:02] oh as many
[1:24:05] as are led by the spirit of god
[1:24:08] they are the sons of god
[1:24:10] i think we need to let our ideas
[1:24:13] and our schedule
[1:24:15] and the way we got everything so
[1:24:16] pre-planned
[1:24:17] well this is what we're going to do
[1:24:19] after church we're just going to go home
[1:24:20] and we got it all predetermined and not
[1:24:22] realize that there's a hungry soul in
[1:24:24] the parking lot
[1:24:25] and if you just take a moment
[1:24:28] and take a chance to listen
[1:24:31] friends
[1:24:33] do you realize who you are
[1:24:37] you are god made flesh
[1:24:41] and sometimes i wonder after i've gone
[1:24:43] to a store
[1:24:44] or i've gone somewhere and i'm leaving
[1:24:46] i'm like that's it
[1:24:49] that's all god did when he went to the
[1:24:50] grocery store
[1:24:53] i just walked by all these people with
[1:24:55] needs and i know we can't heal everybody
[1:24:57] i know we can't talk to everybody but
[1:24:59] all if we could just be sensitive and
[1:25:02] say oh god is there a seed here is there
[1:25:05] something i can say is there something
[1:25:08] that i can do i'm reminded there in john
[1:25:10] 5 9 that speaks of jesus that he did
[1:25:13] nothing but what the father had showed
[1:25:16] him and the prophet of god would pick
[1:25:18] that up in the church book and you say
[1:25:19] this harmony now exists
[1:25:22] between the bride and the bridegroom she
[1:25:25] has the mind of christ she knows what he
[1:25:28] wants done with the word she has the
[1:25:30] saith the lord or she stands still i
[1:25:35] think that's one problem that a lot of
[1:25:37] us have we don't know how to stand still
[1:25:41] oh god help me
[1:25:43] help me lord when i don't have thus
[1:25:45] saith the lord to stand still
[1:25:47] i think of the the scripture where they
[1:25:50] the sadducees and pharisees had brought
[1:25:52] a woman that was caught in adultery and
[1:25:54] they come and threw her at his feet and
[1:25:56] said oh what do you say to this woman
[1:25:58] she was caught in the very act of
[1:26:00] adultery what do you say about it
[1:26:02] what do you say about so-and-so did you
[1:26:04] hear what so-and-so did
[1:26:06] did you hear about their sin did you
[1:26:07] hear about their mistakes what do you
[1:26:09] say about it
[1:26:11] well you know actually i think you know
[1:26:12] i kind of saw it coming because you know
[1:26:14] i could kind of tell you know what they
[1:26:16] they used to be sitting on the second
[1:26:17] row in church and then and they started
[1:26:19] moving towards the back and i started to
[1:26:21] think you know the first thing that goes
[1:26:22] the spirit you know and then it's
[1:26:23] manifested in the natural and oh my
[1:26:26] we're just so quick
[1:26:27] we've got our discernment we got our
[1:26:29] judgment
[1:26:31] i know exactly what we should do in this
[1:26:33] situation well the prophet of god said
[1:26:36] we have the law of moses she's in
[1:26:39] adultery my will it's
[1:26:41] there's no guesswork here
[1:26:43] the word says stoner we're all believers
[1:26:45] of the word stoner and hear the very
[1:26:48] word made flesh doesn't even say a word
[1:26:52] why because he practices what he
[1:26:54] preaches
[1:26:56] maybe he's waiting for the vision to
[1:26:58] unfold
[1:27:00] maybe he's maybe god's already given a
[1:27:02] vision he knows i know i'm going to
[1:27:04] speak this word right when this sadducee
[1:27:06] comes over here and puts his hand on his
[1:27:08] shoulder and the lord told me that right
[1:27:10] at that very moment as that hand goes up
[1:27:12] i'll go ahead and speak or maybe he
[1:27:14] doesn't even know what to do yet
[1:27:17] so he just knows father
[1:27:18] i don't do anything
[1:27:20] unless you show me
[1:27:22] and so he just stoops down
[1:27:24] he starts writing in the sand
[1:27:26] you know me and some of the brothers
[1:27:28] that's what we do now
[1:27:29] if somebody comes up and starts asking
[1:27:31] you and saying something about somebody
[1:27:32] or wanting an opinion and it really
[1:27:34] doesn't matter just why don't you just
[1:27:35] go ahead and go
[1:27:39] i'm just standing still brother
[1:27:42] i don't want to speak unless he shows me
[1:27:44] to speak
[1:27:47] and they keep after him and they keep
[1:27:48] after him
[1:27:50] and then oh then god had given him the
[1:27:51] words to say
[1:27:53] and he said he who is without sin
[1:27:56] cast the first tone
[1:27:58] oh my we got a bunch of stone throwers
[1:28:00] in the church
[1:28:01] we got a bunch of people that just want
[1:28:03] to pick up stones they got a bunch of
[1:28:05] stones like oh you did what
[1:28:08] what you
[1:28:09] you didn't show up to church on sunday
[1:28:12] i thought you were a bullet you
[1:28:14] you did what
[1:28:18] oh come on
[1:28:20] come on
[1:28:22] hey i i've been guilty i've been the one
[1:28:24] that's picked up the whole piano be like
[1:28:25] you need
[1:28:26] one you going
[1:28:29] i'm mad what's that still small voice
[1:28:31] saying
[1:28:32] you who's without sin
[1:28:34] oh what did the scripture say
[1:28:37] if we say we have no sin we're liars
[1:28:40] who are we to judge anybody
[1:28:42] who are we
[1:28:45] we're all born in sin
[1:28:47] we're all shaped in iniquity we're all
[1:28:49] sinners we all needed the blood
[1:28:51] we all needed the blood of jesus christ
[1:28:54] oh and when you've tasted it
[1:28:56] hallelujah it doesn't bring no judgment
[1:28:59] you could look at somebody in their
[1:29:00] fault and failure say man i know a god
[1:29:03] that forgives i know a god of grace i
[1:29:05] know a god of compassion i know a god
[1:29:08] that can take your situation he can take
[1:29:10] that condition you're living in and the
[1:29:12] spirit of god can move upon your life he
[1:29:14] can take away all the gloom and the
[1:29:17] doubt and the eson can shine into your
[1:29:19] life and change everything forever oh
[1:29:22] hallelujah that's what we're talking
[1:29:23] about
[1:29:24] oh the prophet would say this he'd say
[1:29:26] when he gets ready to use an individual
[1:29:29] he separates the light from the darkness
[1:29:33] when he gets ready to use an individual
[1:29:35] he separates the light from the darkness
[1:29:39] oh in order for that seed to be
[1:29:40] quickened it has to receive the light
[1:29:44] and the light is the manifestation of
[1:29:45] the spoken word
[1:29:48] prophet would say this
[1:29:50] the same message he goes so life
[1:29:52] is only by the word of god made manifest
[1:29:56] life comes only by the word of god made
[1:29:59] manifest as long as it is just in the
[1:30:02] book
[1:30:03] like this
[1:30:05] it still can be questioned
[1:30:09] and i want to say as long as the word
[1:30:11] remains on the tapes
[1:30:14] as long as it remains
[1:30:16] in the message books
[1:30:18] it can still be questioned
[1:30:21] oh i'd like to stop there but maybe we
[1:30:22] can build towards something
[1:30:24] but when it's made manifest i'll let the
[1:30:26] prophet do it
[1:30:27] but when it's made manifest then you see
[1:30:31] the product
[1:30:33] of what is spoke of being manifested
[1:30:37] then that is light on the word
[1:30:41] the word said so and then when it comes
[1:30:43] to past
[1:30:44] that is life in light
[1:30:47] light
[1:30:48] bringing life
[1:30:50] light brings life
[1:30:53] you are the word of god
[1:30:55] the spoken word is the original seed you
[1:30:58] are the word of god and god sent his
[1:31:00] word to his word to produce the word
[1:31:04] oh my talk about multiplication
[1:31:07] word coming to word
[1:31:10] praise god
[1:31:11] look if you if you plant a seed
[1:31:14] and you put it in the basement
[1:31:16] this is what the profit goes on next
[1:31:18] through the next paragraphs here and
[1:31:20] where a man can turn a light if you
[1:31:21] plant a seed and put it in the basement
[1:31:23] or maybe you put it out in the shed
[1:31:25] i mean if you keep going down there and
[1:31:27] check on it to see if it's coming to
[1:31:28] life you're wasting your time
[1:31:31] because that seed cannot come to its
[1:31:34] potentials
[1:31:35] until the light strikes the seed and
[1:31:38] it's the light that brings life if the
[1:31:42] seed is germatized the life in the seed
[1:31:46] is the life of god but it takes the
[1:31:48] light of his word to bring the life
[1:31:50] that's in the seed
[1:31:53] however that went that's the way it went
[1:31:56] and that's how god ordained it
[1:31:59] so as soon as the light strikes it it
[1:32:02] will bring forth life if it's a
[1:32:04] dermatitis seed or if i can say it like
[1:32:06] this if there is any life in the seed it
[1:32:08] will respond to the light
[1:32:13] oh that's how god always does it
[1:32:18] so hear the word made manifest in jesus
[1:32:21] christ
[1:32:23] he is the light
[1:32:25] the word made flesh the word manifested
[1:32:29] is the light
[1:32:30] so now here is the word made manifest
[1:32:32] and says i have needs to go by samaria
[1:32:37] why i have needs to go by samaria
[1:32:40] because there is a seed there
[1:32:43] that the light has to strike the seed
[1:32:46] but the woman at the well she was living
[1:32:48] in darkness there was a veil around her
[1:32:51] life there was a fog and there was a
[1:32:53] mist but now jesus christ is coming
[1:32:56] because when god decides to use an
[1:32:58] individual he actually starts to
[1:33:01] separate the light from the darkness and
[1:33:04] the esso in the word just it takes that
[1:33:07] to strike the seed and bring forth the
[1:33:09] potentials that was planted so here is a
[1:33:12] predestinated seed of god oh she's had
[1:33:15] five husbands she's living in sin
[1:33:19] there's this fog over her life she
[1:33:22] doesn't even know who she is she she's a
[1:33:24] samaritan
[1:33:26] she's half jew half gentile
[1:33:28] she she's she believes in god but
[1:33:31] there's this wondering of well we
[1:33:33] worship in this mountain they
[1:33:35] worshipping that mountain but her life
[1:33:37] has all been messed up all the jews
[1:33:40] wrote her off
[1:33:42] she had written her the town had written
[1:33:44] her off
[1:33:45] she was in violation of the law but now
[1:33:48] look at this the light hallelujah said i
[1:33:52] have needs to go by bedford texas
[1:33:55] because i have to shine upon a seed and
[1:33:58] now i got to start to discern the
[1:34:01] thoughts and intents of her heart and
[1:34:03] perform the messiah sign and the spirit
[1:34:06] of god is now going to move upon her
[1:34:09] condition and separate the light from
[1:34:13] the darkness that is the light that the
[1:34:15] sea can be struck by the manifested word
[1:34:18] of the hour and bring forth the
[1:34:19] potentials that i had in my mind and had
[1:34:23] spoke before i even put the world into
[1:34:25] existence oh hallelujah that is what has
[1:34:28] happened with you
[1:34:32] oh you talk about a revival
[1:34:35] talk about a spirit of revival when the
[1:34:38] word manifested showed up into her life
[1:34:41] and was able to discern the thoughts and
[1:34:43] intents of her life and actually
[1:34:46] separate the darkness away from the seed
[1:34:51] oh
[1:34:52] thank you jesus i was in a lot of
[1:34:54] darkness i was in a lot of bad places oh
[1:34:57] i was in a lot of sin but god moved upon
[1:35:00] my life and the spirit of god separated
[1:35:04] all of the darkness he actually took all
[1:35:06] of my sins he threw it into god's sea of
[1:35:08] forgetfulness oh it was a cloudless sky
[1:35:11] and the s-o-n of god's word shined into
[1:35:14] my soul and it birthed forth life oh you
[1:35:18] talk about a revival i told all my
[1:35:20] friends i told all my neighbors i'm
[1:35:23] still doing it you talk about a revival
[1:35:26] here this lady who had been just met the
[1:35:28] messiah she started to come back to the
[1:35:31] town and oh my you know what they wanted
[1:35:33] to do to her don't listen to her

[1:35:57] doesn't want to do it to you
[1:35:59] he's going to try to tell the church
[1:36:00] about it he's going to try to tell the
[1:36:02] world about it but oh you know what i
[1:36:05] love about that go ahead and tell the
[1:36:08] world and the church about my past cause

[1:36:18] can tell me where i messed up here you
[1:36:20] can tell me where i messed up there but
[1:36:22] oh there has been a revival that has
[1:36:25] broke out in my heart and i can stand in
[1:36:27] the face of my critics i can stand in
[1:36:29] the face of my enemy say all that be
[1:36:31] true but god rich in mercy come by my
[1:36:34] way he separated the darkness from my
[1:36:37] life and the glorious light of his
[1:36:39] gospel i struck the predestinated seat
[1:36:42] of god and now i'm living in revival i

[1:36:47] though they are because i know i come
[1:36:49] from god i'm going back to god oh let
[1:36:52] there be and there was
[1:36:55] oh we're coming into a position where we
[1:36:57] can speak the word
[1:36:59] hallelujah just moving towards the close
[1:37:01] here all the scripture would say ye are
[1:37:04] the light of the world a city set on the
[1:37:06] hill cannot be hid oh come on i want to
[1:37:09] see somebody who's alight

[1:37:55] bible said in the evening time oh you

[1:38:22] thing left is his very life
[1:38:24] oh that's a revival
[1:38:26] hallelujah and by god's grace i'm living
[1:38:29] in revival
[1:38:30] oh glory to god
[1:38:32] now we just
[1:38:34] we're gonna lay a foundation to close
[1:38:36] you ever that one
[1:38:39] i'm gonna lay a foundation to close
[1:38:41] we're gonna slow down for just a second
[1:38:43] stay with me
[1:38:47] because i'm finally to my
[1:38:49] my opening text
[1:38:53] the earth
[1:38:55] was without form and void
[1:38:58] and darkness
[1:38:59] was upon the face of the deep
[1:39:02] and the spirit of god moved now just
[1:39:05] listen to this word move the spirit of
[1:39:06] god moved upon the face of the waters
[1:39:10] now i'm going to attempt to say this the
[1:39:11] hebrew way once
[1:39:15] the word moved is rahoff
[1:39:18] and it comes from the root word to brood
[1:39:21] so now i'm going to say it the english
[1:39:23] phonetic way is rakoff
[1:39:25] so this word move rakoff is actually
[1:39:28] means to brood it's used only in the
[1:39:30] scripture three times
[1:39:32] and each time it's used it's used in a
[1:39:34] different manner it's used it means to
[1:39:36] flutter
[1:39:37] to move or to shake and as the spirit of
[1:39:41] god moved this is the same word
[1:39:43] rakoff that is used in deuteronomy 32 11
[1:39:46] that says as an eagle stirreth up her
[1:39:48] nest
[1:39:50] fluttereth there's the word moved as the
[1:39:52] spirit of god moved as the spirit of god
[1:39:54] fluttereth over her young and spreadeth
[1:39:57] abroad her wings and taketh them and
[1:39:59] beareth them on their wings i want to
[1:40:01] say you might not even know or believe
[1:40:04] that the spirit of god is moving on you
[1:40:07] but i want you to know that the spirit
[1:40:08] of god is brooding over your life
[1:40:11] it's brooding over your family it's
[1:40:13] brooding over your prayers your prayers
[1:40:16] have not been forgotten mom your prayers
[1:40:18] have not been forgotten dead those
[1:40:20] prayers that you've been praying for and
[1:40:21] believing for a married couple they are
[1:40:23] not forgotten but the spirit of god is
[1:40:26] now brooding over your life he's mindful
[1:40:29] of those promises he's mindful of those
[1:40:32] prayers and the spirit of god is moving
[1:40:35] he he's brooding over your life that's
[1:40:38] what the spirit of god is doing it wants
[1:40:40] to move upon you
[1:40:42] and speak the word to your condition and
[1:40:44] to your situation that you can be set
[1:40:47] free that you can be delivered
[1:40:51] and god the transforming power of god
[1:40:53] here is a world
[1:40:55] in chaos
[1:40:57] and god can move upon a situation
[1:41:00] and just with one word turn a world of
[1:41:02] chaos into a garden of eden
[1:41:05] oh i want to tell you friends
[1:41:07] start looking at start start taking
[1:41:09] courage and to call those things that
[1:41:11] are not as though they are
[1:41:13] and start drawing from the unseen
[1:41:16] and maybe in your situation and start
[1:41:18] calling those things that you're going
[1:41:20] to receive it that you could speak the
[1:41:22] word
[1:41:23] or if the musicians would come
[1:41:26] we're still laying a foundation for
[1:41:27] clothes though
[1:41:30] the prophet of god would say this i just
[1:41:32] want to
[1:41:33] to read this quote it blessed me
[1:41:35] it's just speaking about the spirit of
[1:41:37] god moving because the spirit of god
[1:41:38] creates an atmosphere
[1:41:41] just give me a moment sister i'll be
[1:41:42] i'll be ready in a moment
[1:41:44] it's the spirit of god that conditions
[1:41:46] the atmosphere the prophet god says it
[1:41:48] takes the spirit of god to bring life
[1:41:51] and that life must not come out of just
[1:41:53] an intellectual revival
[1:41:56] it goes to come out of the bible word
[1:41:58] revival and that word is the same
[1:42:00] yesterday today and forever when it
[1:42:02] falls today and quickens you get the
[1:42:04] same results you did in acts 2. well
[1:42:07] what happened in acts 2
[1:42:09] they were gathered in the upper room
[1:42:11] all praying in his name
[1:42:13] they were baptized in the holy ghost and
[1:42:15] power for service came and what he did
[1:42:18] for them that day he'll do for you the
[1:42:20] same i'm so glad that i can say i'm one
[1:42:24] of them oh it'll do
[1:42:26] the same thing when the quickening power
[1:42:29] strikes you oh it'll be like a sound of
[1:42:31] a rushing mighty wind and the very
[1:42:33] tongue of god will set down on you i'm
[1:42:35] talking about a lick of fire oh a very
[1:42:38] portion of that very zoey life will come
[1:42:40] down and set upon you or to produce the
[1:42:43] same thing exactly it always has it
[1:42:45] always will be because it's the spirit
[1:42:47] of god that conditions the atmosphere it
[1:42:50] takes atmosphere to do things that's the
[1:42:53] reason you men are always taught bring
[1:42:54] your children here well certainly that's
[1:42:57] right i was glad to see my daughter
[1:42:58] rebecca come in and sit down just a few
[1:43:00] minutes ago some of you see me wink at a
[1:43:02] woman it was my daughter so she come and
[1:43:04] sat down i want her to receive the
[1:43:06] baptism of the spirit and that's why she
[1:43:09] is here in the meeting
[1:43:11] that's the purpose of it it takes
[1:43:14] atmosphere what i'm drawing from this is
[1:43:16] the spirit of god that conditions the
[1:43:19] atmosphere
[1:43:21] now the third time this this rakoff is
[1:43:24] used in scripture is in jeremiah 23 9 it
[1:43:27] says my heart within me is broken
[1:43:30] of the prophets all my bones shake
[1:43:34] jeremiah's heart was broken and he was
[1:43:37] actually shaking
[1:43:39] and trembling because israel had now
[1:43:42] gone off into whoredoms and he said they
[1:43:44] were adulterers and the very land would
[1:43:47] have become a wilderness and i want to
[1:43:50] say as are we looking at this the spirit
[1:43:52] of god will move in your life
[1:43:54] he will brood upon your life as a hen
[1:43:56] would brood over or he will shake you
[1:43:59] and i want to tell you however it's
[1:44:00] going to come the spirit of god is going
[1:44:03] to move upon your condition that he
[1:44:05] might create an atmosphere and be able
[1:44:08] to speak the word of god to strike that
[1:44:11] predestinated seed to bring it to life
[1:44:15] that's how god always does it
[1:44:18] but god's word we know comes to a
[1:44:21] prophet
[1:44:23] that's what it says in amos 3 7 it says
[1:44:26] surely the lord will do nothing but what
[1:44:29] he revealeth his secrets unto the
[1:44:30] servants the prophet
[1:44:32] go ahead and play something
[1:44:34] that way we can close
[1:44:36] my foundation's getting longer to close
[1:44:39] let's stand
[1:44:42] but noah's message
[1:44:45] was the light
[1:44:47] of the hour
[1:44:48] moses message
[1:44:51] was the light
[1:44:52] of the hour
[1:44:55] moses
[1:44:57] had met the pillar of fire
[1:45:00] moses was the manifestation
[1:45:04] of the word that said i will send you a
[1:45:06] deliver
[1:45:08] and when that word was now manifested
[1:45:10] moses became the light
[1:45:14] and then moses comes down to egypt
[1:45:17] and because moses was that light god
[1:45:19] could tell him
[1:45:22] say let it be fleece
[1:45:26] and there was
[1:45:27] he can say let the death angel pass
[1:45:31] and it was
[1:45:32] because moses was the light
