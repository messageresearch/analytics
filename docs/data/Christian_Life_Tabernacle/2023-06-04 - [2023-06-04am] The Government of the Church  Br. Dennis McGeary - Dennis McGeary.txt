Description:
The Government of the Church
Br. Dennis McGeary
June 4, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

just come and open our service in prayer amen [Music] let's just welcome him in this morning Father God we're just so thankful Lord that still in this day of chaos and indecision Lord about whether

Lord you'll always be there on our side and there to lead us along the way and we just pray father that you'd be here in this service this morning all the more that Lord our worship will please you Lord God that you'll come and be gathered with your people Lord and be amongst us and father you would break the bread of life to us as you always do Lord and just reveal to us more of you Lord for this we give you all the glory and honor and all the praise in Jesus name amen amen so good to be in the house of God want to welcome everyone all our visitors you can turn around and welcome someone I mean that's invite by the mic for us home reading this morning may God bless you may have your seats good morning You Know It uh was thinking this weekend you know at some point I was listening to some other services and it occurred to me at some point you know each of us is going to encounter worship services that at a different church somewhere whether that's another one of our sister churches or whether it's just one of the you know the many versions of church that are out in the world today you know whether whatever it is at some point we're gonna you know experience different kind of worship service you know you'll find every church is a little bit different some fairly similar some very different you know there's nothing wrong with that but you know I'm not suggesting that there's any perfect worship service but you know as long as worship is a result of the word and not the music or the volume of the worship leader you know then it's it's worship you know something you might occasionally see in a worship service somewhere is you know perhaps one of the worship leaders or someone else beginning to quote some of the Psalms you know and maybe as a way to encourage the people to worship you know whether it's in the middle of a worship service at church sometimes you'll hear it you know even on the radio but you know one of these worship leaders might get up and start quoting things like let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him sing unto him sing unto the Lord bless his name show forth his salvation from day to day the Lord reineth let the Earth rejoice let the multitudes be glad you know and as someone begins to say these things you you know the people might begin to praise even more you know the music might start going louder and you'll hear the excitement of the people as they remember some of these things but again that's fine as long as it's the word Psalm 95 is one of these chapters that is often used at least that I've heard you know during a time of worship somewhere someone might speak of these things to encourage and remind the people to worship but you know it's a it's a wonderful scripture but as I was reading that this weekend I thought as I was reading that it occurred to me what if what if this wasn't about music or a church service at all what if it was instead an interaction between me and God alone how might that change how I look at this scripture you know look at a couple of examples in verse one O Come let us let me sing unto the Lord let us let me Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our salvation it's interesting as you read that he is the recipient the receiver of my song it's a song a noise a sound going forth from me that is something he can receive did you know each of us has a song a sound that goes forth out of our lives you know just as in an orchestra each instrument might produce a different sound based on how it's manufactured or crafted or an acquire each person might have a different voice based on how they're built and then the conductor or the leader will take and mix each and every one of these sounds together to receive the sound that he wants to hear you know so is it like us each of us has a unique sound that comes forth out of us that has been crafted and molded and shaped by the great conductor Oh Come let us let me sing unto the Lord you know when we read examples in the Book of Revelation of people that we're worshiping and singing the pattern that's in heaven the song that's continually going forth from the worshipers Revelation 7 blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving in honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever the sound that is continually going forth out of the people is blessing to God glory to God honor to God praise to God it's all talking about his power his might his works his ways and that if that's the sound that we're continuously making over there then should not that also be the sound that we're making over here where the song coming forth continually out of our life is the power of God the works of God the honor of God the glory of God every day continuously a sound a song Going forth out of our lives a continual sound peace of him O come let us let me sing unto the Lord that I may sing the song he has crafted for me to sing continuously Paul said it this way in Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works with God hath before ordained that we should walk in them crafted to make a sound verse 2 let us let me come before his presence with Thanksgiving again what if this has nothing to do with the church service in spite of how nice this building is or the building that we're building over there God's presence is not in buildings or even honestly in church services necessarily you know as Paul told the worshipers in Acts 17 [Music] says the god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshiped with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing as he giveth to all life and breath and all things he talks of how they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us let me come into His presence you know there is a call to enter his presence and a way has been ministered for each of us to do so it's not to get to that perfect worship service to get in his presence but it's a personal call to come into His presence it says Jeremiah 29 13 and ye shall seek me and find me when she when ye shall search for me with all your heart there's a provided way for us to enter into his presence and there's a call for us to come into His presence each and every day to Avail ourselves of the way that's been provided verse 7 for he is our God not the god of the group he is my God and we are the people I am one of the people of his pasture not my pastor not my placing not my positioning but I am the person of his pasture the pasture where he's placed us and the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice just remember John 10 you know my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow am I listening for his voice each and every day my tuning out all the other voices of the land and seeking his voice you know as we read this chapter as I was reading this chapter and looking at it from that lens not as a call to worship as part of a church service but as an individual interaction each and every day the thing he has called each of us to if we will it changes the passage it becomes an intimate call to his presence and to sing the song he's given for us to sing anyway that was what he spoke to me about I want to go ahead and stand we're going to read Psalm 95 together foreign starting in verse one O come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods in his hand are the Deep places of the Earth the strength of the hills is his also the sea is his and he made it and His Hands formed the dry land O come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if ye will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do air in their heart and they have not known my ways unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest amen hey man you may be seated and that's what we want to do this morning come into His presence with praise am I oh and I'm meaning oh I call on the Lord [Music] [Music] there's no one greater a wonderful savior to Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the greatest love story always [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh yes it is [Music] [Music] [Music] miracles [Music] [Music] yes [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh Victory today [Music] happy place [Music] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] together [Music] numbers [Music] [Laughter] [Music] falling as wonderful memories [Music] precious amen amen thank God for his power amen it's made available for the believer to come in and man Amen brother Tommy has a special if he can come at this time I've been real hesitant to do this for a long time and uh you know the Lord's been really putting it on my heart and when Davey came up here it really encouraged me uh but I told Brother Billy I guess it's probably been maybe a couple of years ago that it was on my heart to do it but also I wanted to read something and uh brother Mike just uh the psalm reading just went so well with what um I've been reading and what's been really encouraging me let's see if I can find her here it's from what hears thou Elijah it's at 29 if they want to put it up on the screen let me see so it says now I want you to notice no no no yeah now I want you to notice what taking place and it it isn't always noisy things that's great things it's the noisy things it's not the noisy things well wait a minute that's not losing my place here just bear with me sorry was it 29 Liz sorry guys it's not it okay yeah so that it was 29 I was reading right now I want you to notice what taking place it isn't always the noisy things that's the great things it's not the noise it's not the noisy things a wagon couldn't go out in the field when it's when it's unloaded it it'll bump and Rattle and make a lot of noise can come right back over the same bumps loaded with good things and won't even make a squeak why it's loaded while the church needs tonight it's to be loaded filled with the love of God the son can draw a million gallons of water with less noise than we can pump a glass of full water that's right the heavens can sprinkle Dew all over the Earth with less noise then you can sprinkle your front lawn certainly did certain certainly did you ever hear the planet turning great things are Quiet Things watch the Holy Spirit when it comes in tonight how quiet it gets everything but we're after Sensations running after little things failing to hear that voice did you ever hear the Daybreak no you never heard the Daybreak yet it scattered all the darkness if we would only listen to the voice of him that speaks Behind these things there would be Fellowship amongst all the churches Methodist Baptist Protestant Protestant Catholic and all together would tear down the middle wall of partitions and we'd have brotherly love you know it and it goes on and on but it just it really quickens something to me you know and I and even we've been in the in the someranian church age in the Bible study at Matthews and just held tests and trials are really they're special even though sometimes we think we're going through a hard time and we're thinking that God forgot about us he's allowing it for a purpose and I never really it took me a while to realize that and and when God put something on my heart I want to move forward and uh I've ran from this for a while so but you're gonna have to put the words up because I don't remember the words it's God is so good and if y'all can sing with me because I'm not a singer and I'm very nervous and gone is so good is so good God is so good he's so good to me yes he is he saved my sinsic soul he said my spirit free he hears My Broken Heart he's so good [Music] to me yes he is love him so I love him so I love him so he's so good to me [Music] he answers prayer he turns prayer he answers prayer he's so good to me God is so good [Music] God is so good [Music] God is so good he's so good to me thank you thank you [Applause] amen hey man has it been good to you yeah I said man I like that and then it's that identification in the heart and then it doesn't have to be done with great noise or anything but as long as that identification comes back to what is done in you that's what counts amen that's what we desire to be loaded by him and we have a couple of requests here up here we'd like to bring before the church is an announcement by the Patrick and sister Susanna would like to announce the arrival of the baby girl Joyce lusamba Kabbalah he was born on May 30th and Boone and the mother and the baby are doing well thank you all for your prayers amen amen amen amen is a good god amen this uh the Kube family they want to wish sister Linda and Kube a happy birthday it says we thank the Lord for giving her another year amen amen God bless your sister certainly happy for you and man those that don't know his sister Linda is can you listen to him just a little embarrassment that's just Heaven sister Leslie Wrights please pray for sister Jeanette Alexander she's been suffering from three broken ribs after falling she has an appointment this coming Tuesday that says that is for her back pain as well and she needs a load intervention we certainly want to remember our sister pray that the Lord will undertake for her and amen that will heal her again please pray for Sister Barbara stanky as she's having a hip replacement surgery this Tuesday so we pray that the Lord will guide the surgeon's hands that all may go well sister Linda Lily rash writes a sister Sarah rash as an unspoken prayer request should likely be remembered for so we want to lift her up in prayer this morning but Adrian writes God bless you brothers and sisters please pray for my cousin Samantha she's in a difficult battle with the spirit that that brings her anxiety and depression we pray that he comes to us to on the scene and touch our heart in the spirit thank you amen amen I believe we bring this request before the Lord because we know he's here to do that amen that's the purpose for the word if it's not for healing if it's not for deliverance then what is it for it's to bring us into that perfect condition and we have to come with confidence knowing that God will do these things but if John writes a friend a friend's wife Kelly fine who's undergoing a rare liver operation this Tuesday six uh please try it says to try to repair this car damage to leave of course by the parasites she had as a child so it's certainly want to remember Kelly this morning a friend amen if you have a need upon your heart this morning I believe we stand before the almighty God a man we can come before his presence and ask for this and know that he will hear our prayers I want to continue to pray for the the church constructions and amen and the needs that we have in our bodies that we know often so want to bring this before the Lord Amen brother Andrew if he could just come you take this needs before the Lord the brothers that are taking the offerings if you can come amen [Music] [Music] you know if we all could just think personally about each one of these tests there's requests for prayer because there's power in your prayer and if you can take to heart I know sometimes it's hard to remember I can't even hardly remember all the requests but sometimes just one of those requests strikes your heart and let the love of God that what God did for you how you can identify with that hurting individual that person you know I know there's some that you know experience the liver transplant that person can really bear the burden we want our prayers and our faith to go out to these needs and and to know that we can touch God because he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities and right now the the very needs this some of it doesn't seem between life and death but if the truth of God's word can come upon that situation and they can see this was actually used to bring me into his presence to to know that that God is so mindful even now to them and to bring them to a healing virtue or or a Providence or something let's Bear Let's bear our burdens with these requests and just really enter in and just trust that the Lord will undertake for these you believe God's going to do that by your prayer make these requests known pour out your the voice that you had let it be known to God because he'll make intercession upon those things that you're speaking even now let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we want to lift up our praise to you and say you're our healer it was by your stripes that we are healed father Lord you said ask anything in my name and I'll do it father we're trusting in

bring a transformation Lord we're in a late hour father we want to see you move upon these situations that your word can be alive and real to these requests Lord we're asking oh God for these tithes

different things taking place so you have a Mountaintop experience and then you you think you're going to stay there but it's right after the Mountaintop experience you go in the valley and when you're in the valley the devil makes you think that there's no way out there's no hope that it's the wrath of God on you but the reality is there's a Perfection he's trying to create a character that he wants to bring out in the midst of the trial in the midst of the problem and just studying at the men's meeting about the age of Marion like brother Tommy was talking about that christ-like character in the midst of suffering it was something something that was said uh in that book the expression of the church ages and it was something along the lines of God could easily at the snap of his finger and all your suffering he knows you're suffering he knows you're in Trials but he can't hear you he's not going to do that he's got to get you through it when you see his hand guiding you through it it means more to you than an instant gratification an instant blessing so I want to sing this song Just To Praise Him in the midst of the storm in the midst of everything foreign [Music] since there have been times I felt so all alone but in my lonely hours those precious lonely hours oh Jesus let me know who I was is all through it all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus

brought me through oh and if I never problem how would I know that God could solve them but how would I know what faith in his word can do that's why I sing through it all going through it all oh I've

such as us but yet you so loved us you gave your only begotten son father he laid his life down for us and father then you said if we would believe on him and take his name that you would give us power to become the Sons and Daughters of God Lord oh we magnify your name this morning we ask you to bless us in your precious and holy name we pray man God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly uh nice to be in the house of the Lord this morning I I see that we acknowledge sister Linda nakubi's birthday it's also Marie tomomo's birthday today so if we wish her happy birthday sister Nikki Oglesby if you're listening this morning sister Nikki happy birthday to you and Jonathan sends you his birthday greetings from Chicago and it was a brother Jonathan's birthday yesterday amen I I certainly uh felt for brother Ben this morning when he said it's been the last couple weeks have been real difficult and everything well he's been working for me for the last time we certainly know what that's like you know I I just don't know why God made me such a Taskmaster but I do know that uh there's great Deliverance after the hand of the Taskmaster so we're certainly grateful for that um but anyway we we certainly love the Lord especially nice to have my brother with us this morning we'll be hearing from him here in just a moment uh brother Mike could you put up uh I believe it's uh uh Luke 6 31 on the board Luke 6 on the board how many knows what this is called what the common terminology for this saying is the Golden Rule and you know it's a great it's a great uh when they say it's a golden rule another if if we could follow this how many things would uh fall in place you know in First Corinthians up 1134 uh Paul says he says if any hunger let him eat at home he says and the rest will I set an order when I come and then also in uh First Corinthians 14 41 he makes this statement he says let all things be done decently and in order if and those great scriptures really fall under the Golden Rule if is do other things so when you begin to follow that there's a few little things I'd like to go over with us this morning before our brother ministers to us but just little things that start to creep in and you find out that they don't appear so bad within themselves but they stand in opposition of the golden rule or of doing unto others so one of the things is like cell phones cell phone usage in the church and normally we'd like you to turn off your cell phones and put them away before you come to church but you know for a lot of you young sisters that have got into this be real and then you start taking pictures of one another in church and posting them online you know and I just want you to picture yourself at your wedding you know and you're you're standing up there at your wedding and you're about to give your vows it's your great day in church and somebody's around going you know total disregard for your day you know and I know these things become fads but but you you don't want to do that and and how about shopping on Amazon can you imagine at your wedding or your day at and the people in church are shopping on Amazon now you know the scripture says it just takes a little leaven to leaven the whole lot I mean just just that one moment you got bored or you got a flash in your mind that you could buy a dress if you didn't buy it by noon you know what I mean so you think you'll just pull out your phone and quickly flash in the order on Amazon you just got to remember there's a great God that's looking at the whole picture and when he he sees those things and I know they don't mean much to you and we all talk about our teenage years and and how boring church is and and all those things and you suffer through it but you know if you could just hang in there for a few hours and and just and just be mindful that there are other people here who really want to Worship the Lord and there are people here that God's really done a lot for you know I mean like brother Tommy I I appreciate that this morning because if you got something on your heart do it because it opens a whole nother Avenue of things that's that one thing you're holding back from doing maybe holding back a a fountain of blessing coming your way and I really appreciate it because I know where Tommy come from and every word that he speaks is genuine and so that means so much for me so these are little things that we just need to put under that great Golden Rule in other words an after service I know that we're trying to build a better facility for us but we just got to move out of the four-year after service when we're done don't stop and talk in the foyer temporarily you can go into the other building over here if you need to I know it's hot but if we could just empty out the foyer as quick as possible and uh and uh not stop and visit in the foyer so when you leave the church just make your way right outside the best you can and and we will do that and we're working as hard as we can to prepare uh better places for you in the next couple weeks it'll be even better so we want to do that and then also it's real important to keep the the sanctuary reverent and and as people are praying sometimes we'll have people at the altar and people especially our musicians have to be careful when you come off the uh altar if somebody's praying that you you don't step over them or you don't you know you you do that so we want to keep the sanctuary real reverent as possible tell everybody's finished praying and what happens a lot of times somebody will be in here praying or even in the back room praying and then we have a fellowship meeting going on in the four year and uh and I think what we fail to understand is the long-term effect of the little foxes that spoiled the vine so I think we need to pull ourselves back together start getting back to the main thing here which is to Worship the Lord Jesus to keep him number one to keep the house of the Lord reverent I'm glad you love one another and you have great social lives but let's move them to the outside and then sisters after foot washing we just like you to go ahead and stay in the room together till everybody's finished we're starting to get a few sisters that come out and congregate in the fellowship area there and talk and and uh and so now you don't have to stay uh tell the worship if you're done with communion and foot washing a few more than welcome to go to your home if you would like you don't have to stay for the uh worship after the singing afterwards so you when you're done washing feet we've completed communion and foot washing and you feel feel free to go at any time but uh let's just try to do a few little of those things and I think it'll make everything better for us amen I want to spiritually grow don't you amen I think that's uh that's a a wonderful thing to do is is to spiritually uh grow and it takes all of us to grow together so let's keep that in mind and so it's not the law that we're in putting it's the Golden Rule right do unto others as you have them do unto you if you were praying wouldn't you want someone to be quiet if you are in need wouldn't you want someone to be reverent so if we do these things I think that it's really wonderful amen it's nice to have my brother with me Dennis come here my good brother this is my brother I've been lying about for a long time I tell everybody he's my older brother most people believe me so uh but anyways nice to have him he reminds me more of my dad he's like my dad than all of us I call him Little Mac but anyway so it's been a blessing many of you have heard the story when he first came to see me in Montana and I told him about the message he uh so he went to wonder if what I was talking about that was the truth he was raised a Catholic like I was all his life and wasn't really introduced uh to the Lord as most Catholics aren't we disbelieve in the church and being a part of the church is on her way so he wanted to find out if this message was true or not so he knelt down before the Lord with a sincere heart and he said Lord if if this message be true and what my brother's talking about is real let a a tree uh Branch or limb or let a tree fall on his pickup truck I sure glad he's matured in his prayers so I'm in the woods I was a lumberjack I Saw Timber in Montana for a living and I come to a tree and this tree is what we call an easy fall it's leaning one place like this if there's nothing out in front of it it's an easy fall you just put your notch in you cut it you follow it you Buck it up and so I come down the road I park my truck back here like this and the trees over here leaning this way easy fall I cut that tree and I cut that tree and that tree goes off of that stump and out of the middle of nowhere a wind comes down and picks that tree up and I'm watching this tree go up in the air like this and I am not believing what I'm seeing and this tree falls right across my pickup truck and Smashes in and I think my goodness what did I do you know I just couldn't I couldn't comprehend that but anyway I I never could figure it out until uh my brother called me and said man I prayed that if this message be true you probably had to try well let me tell you the message is true and and he's here this morning too uh uh testify to that to you my brother does a lot of missionary work a lot of work for spreading this message and it's a real honor and privilege this morning to have you got introduce to you my little brother Dennis he's 10 years younger than I am but he's worked so hard in the gospel it hardly looks that way anymore but we love him with all our heart and we like even welcome him this morning my brother Dennis McGary God bless you [Applause] I greet you in the name of the Lord I wonder if the musicians would just stay a minute I was so much enjoying that song come let us Worship the Lord together how's that go you know what we were singing [Music] just happy in the Lord very encouraged day got to be with the young man I will study the other morning and that encouraged me well what really encouraging me is that I got to meet some of the older brothers and sisters and see that was very impressed with the joy of the Lord and I pray brother Brown said don't let my life be crowned with grumpiness something like that he said I saw them and I thought in the midst of all the onslaught of Affliction just that joy of the Lord it really encouraged me that that uh I may have some real good years if the Lord carries I might could have some real good years in front of me to do something for the Lord and I'm happy to be here this morning with you and uh just when we were going out the door My Brother David said well if you want to say something about Bulgarian I hadn't intended to because it's church for you all and you're looking to the word of the Lord but let me just say three names to you and if you could remember those names and pray pray for these three people they're working on the translation work and it's just New Beginnings in Bulgaria so you can't believe it if it's not in your language and so they're working to get this message in the language of the people and its three sisters and one of the sisters names is Ava and one is Jenny and one is Desi Slava or you could say Desi so Desi Jenny and Ava and they're trying to do the best they can to get it like God gave it in English to their people so if you just remember Bulgaria maybe you could find it on the map and pray for those people they don't have what we have and so if you do that uh we certainly appreciate I'm sure it'd be a great blessing to the children of God that haven't heard yet let's sing that song together maybe could you want to stand again and sing with me and Sydney [Music] [Applause] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] again to glorified [Music] his name Grace [Music] please [Applause] [Music] magnify the Lord with me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] let's just bow our heads before we approach this word dear Lord Jesus this is your word lord it's our joy to magnify you Lord you you're so wonderful as we approach your word we want to open our hearts to you Lord reverently ask you to come and have preeminence Lord to have the place that in our hearts we desire you to have and we reverently commit our needs and our hunger and our thirst to you now in Jesus name we ask you to bless your word amen amen if you like to remain standing for just a moment and I'd like to read out of the book of Isaiah and the ninth chapter and this is a verse Maybe often brought around Christmas time it's a very beautiful scripture and Isaiah chapter 9 and the sixth verse For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this amen God bless you you may be seated if the Lord had helped us this morning I'd like to speak about the government of the church and this is not a business meeting this morning but when we think about government and and what we are expecting leadership from and how we're going to face the challenges in our life uh brother Branham made this statement and I thought how striking it is he said as I was remarking some time ago about a certain little Canary and he thought he knowed all the knowledge that that needed to be node and he knowed so much that he could tell all the rest of the canaries about human beings so he flies up on his cage and he begins to speak about the human being how he knowed all about them and all of a sudden a professor from Purdue walked Walked up and began to speak some high polished words to him and the little fellow batted his eyes and turned his head now he had eyes he could see the professor he had ears he could hear him but of course he didn't know what he was talking about why he's got a canary brain he's just a bird brain that's all he's got he hasn't got a human brain so he can't think like human beings and neither can a human being think like God you're human and all the worldly knowledge is no more than a canary brain all you do you just hurt yourself with it you've got to have the mind of Christ I believe that's what we're all looking for this morning is the help of the Lord the human mind's a wonderful thing it's the womb to the soul and it's marvelous to see what man can do he's a little Messiah and so we want to give our thoughts and our our mind over to the Lord scripture says that the thought of foolishness is sin so God help us this morning to look into the word of God and may the Lord help our little Canary brains and anoint them and and and let us put on the mind of Christ so that this wonderful mind of ours that can can uh absorb and see the pictures that God is giving us the he wrote the Book of Revelation in symbols and he and he writes his love letter to his church between the lines and our minds are very wonderfully made to catch the concept of God the the word of God and what God is trying to express to his children that he loved that he wanted a family he could be almighty God and rule over the universe he's the great Creator but he desired more than rulership he wanted a love affair and and he gave you the mind that you have to to hear his word and and by his grace and by his quickening power and by the anointing that he sends to your heart he he fellowships and communes with you and it's a it's very interesting to be in foreign countries and to see in other languages they don't use these words the and ah and this and that but sometimes they put them on the end of the word so the word has the the what we call I think definite articles my brother could maybe correct me on some of this English but we put the definite article in front of the word but they build it into the word and so sometimes when you're trying to preach there you're talking about when we speak of the government and what a grand Liberty it is just to not have to have translation but if you think about the government and you think about an institution and and in your mind it's kind of a noun to you and you say the government you know the U.S government the the the local government and and it's it's kind of an institution to you and sometimes these Concepts get so common in man that words even change their meaning because Society has changed the original meaning of the word so for an example of that in England when they were translating the Bible when the in the New Testament when the Bible said the church the people had been under that Roman domination for so long that even the phrase the church meant Rome meant the hierarchy at Rome and so when they said the church so that's why you have these churches I don't know if any of you have seen them but they're called congregational and that came out of England because they wanted to change the word from church to the congregation to the people because that was so much in the mind when they said the church so this morning when we talk about the government we're not talking about a noun or an institution we're talking about a verb that someone is governing the the action of governing the church and the church is not this church but it's his church I mean not this church the building the organization organism you know well whatever we're building over there uh it is his bride it's me because I'm his choice and if I'm a believer I'm not afraid to say that it's me because I'm a believer I'm believing just that I'm believing his word so when we talk about his government there were certain things that God put in place temporarily and when Jesus came the scribes and the Pharisees when they heard him speaking and preaching it it brought some conflict and some controversies and they thought well if that be so what about this and we always have that as Believers when the word of God comes to us we get very challenged in our thinking sometimes whether we're raised in church or we come off the street when the word of God starts to be quickened to you there's this contradiction and there's this questioning like you know do I have this right and so the scribes and the Pharisees they said to Jesus they said we're we're not understanding here why did Moses then if what you're saying is true why did Moses give a law of divorcement because God doesn't God hates divorce and and he's making a choice when he chose you that's forever you were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world he wanted a bride he wasn't thinking well I'm going to have a bride for a while no that that wasn't God's thought so they asked Jesus they said why did Moses give give this law of divorcement and Jesus said because of the hardness of your hearts but it wasn't so from the beginning and by the grace of God we heard the prophet tell us what the beginning was because we would have just been wondering we would have we would have thought okay from the beginning of the beginning of the church you know the beginning of the law we wouldn't have known but the prophet came and said no the beginning was back in the garden there was one man and one woman and all the beauty of a woman and all that freshness and all that femininity and all that life that's in her when she's married that is for one man it's not for every man on the street it's not any kind of a game but all that beauty that when she's married that's for one man and that's how it was in the beginning in the garden there was just one man and one woman and there was perfect peace perfect Tranquility perfect love there was no sickness no controversies you know no ugliness no no friction no no anything it was just uh both the feminine and the masculine were in Adam then God took that feminine spirit and separated the feminine part and took a rib from Adam and put the feminine part in a woman and left the masculine part in Adam and then those two were different ever since and God always put a difference and so that's why it was an abomination in the sight of God for a woman to wear a garment pertaining to a man it was because she was invading that male domain amen and these things start going seamlessly together in the scripture if you're willing to go along and God is not trying to affirm or declare or defend his rulership of his creation he's not interested in that he'll need to do that he's almighty God and he created the universe and we're sending these little uh what do they call those little ships that go out there in the uh satellite thank you they're having they send these little satellites out there and they're just washed out there in space they're taking these pictures and they're just seeing galaxies Beyond and Beyond and Beyond so it he's almighty God you don't have to you don't have to affirm his rulership but but he's he wants to unveil himself in this fellowship and so if we went back in the garden where Jesus made this reference to I believe it's uh Genesis the second chapter is it not where he says because you've done this you know God would come down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with Adam and Eve and they'd lay down together with the lion and the leopard and and there they were in this perfect union with God and then sin came in the picture so when sin came into picture thou it's after the beginning and he says because you've done this and he talks about the serpent and he talks about Adam but he says this to the woman he says Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee we're living in such a world that these fundamental concepts in Christianity are really become a hard pill to swallow somebody says I can't believe you just said that well I didn't say it so don't look at me it I was just reading here now that's up to you to figure out about this Bible if it's really the word of God if it came from God if it was really translated right whatever but it's you you've come too late for me because something Supernatural happened in my life where when I started reading this word I knew it was him talking to my heart I didn't know this you know I was reading Jesus's sermons I was reading The Sermon on the Mount blessed are you that hunger and thirst and I said oh praise God that's what I want to hear Lord and he just kept talking to my heart and he kept talking to me and I started saying yes and I don't mean to be too uh sassafras to make myself too much at home but you know I I when I give my heart to the Lord I start reading my Bible a woman gave me I I like to give my testimony someday here and fix a few things my brothers about my my brother's version of My Testimony but maybe the Lord someday when it's a good time we can do that but this nurse gave me a a pair of pajamas and a Bible and I started reading that Bible and I started experience in Jesus's words that my he said my word is spirit and life and by reading my Bible I started seeing that I didn't know nothing about church I could say Catholic music That's a crazy idea of church and and started seeing by reading this Bible my life was changing I saw that Dynamic and I knew that it was him so I knew there's something Supernatural about this world word I didn't know a bunch about it but I knew that this was him and that's just you know that that's just the way it is that's just how I got here so here he is God's saying he shall rule over thee man that's rough especially in the condition that man is because brother Adam said a man's just a brute without Christ but God had no intention of staying there because he was going to get a people over to Ephesians 5. that's that's you know this was just the beginning but over in Ephesians 5 we don't have to turn there you're sure familiar with it he said he said husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and even gave himself for their sanctification so there's a lot of difference between government and rulership when when the mighty Khan brother Branham said in the mighty conquer and he's talking about Napoleon and he's talking about how he conquered the world he was just a young man and some of you might know the details better but I think by 35 he had conquered the biggest part of Europe in the Mediterranean he had a great Kingdom he was really a conqueror and he was very ruthless and he dominated the all of Europe and he went forth and he conquered but when he finally met his Waterloo he himself was conquered by alcohol and he in itself went down in disgrace and everywhere he conquered he left bitterness and and sorrow and every conqueror that's been like that in these great kingdoms when they go out and Conquer they're they're killing Sons and Daughters they're they're having ruthless and Reckless destruction and destroying families and lives and and the labor of that people have built up for years they tear it down and there's nothing but heartache and sorrow in their path and then they rule because they conquered they rule but there was one might he conqueror who came and he not only conquered but he conquered sin and death and hell and the grave and what did he leave behind perfect peace and love and goodness and and and so when he conquered and how did he conquer he humbled himself he was he became one of us he was so interested in our relationship with him that he became one of us how can you hold a trinitarian three-person God and believe in the Kinsmen Redeemer it wasn't somebody else it was him he came down to be one of us to suffer the things that you suffer to be tempted in every way as you are tempted so he could know how you feel and he could be your attorney and your guide and your counselor because he knows how you feel and he's interested in every detail of your life brother Adam said David got to thinking that maybe he wasn't and the sword never left David's house from that time on and he said yes God's interested in every detail of your life amen so the question is what kind of government are you accepting I certainly don't want it to be Canary Canary brain government and if you're you know if you're self-willed and you know it better and and you know how to do well then you know long live canaryville you know press on let's all tweet tweet tweet tweet to each other forevermore canaryville well I didn't see that one coming but maybe there's something to that but you know Abigail was under a government all saints of God if if we would remember I know a lot of you speak several languages and you know I'm a little ignorant myself I I had to learn my wife's language in self-defense but uh but you know we were trying to talk about Abigail the other day in in the Bible it says that Abigail was of a beautiful countenance so what was beautiful about her she was a woman of good understanding and of beautiful countenance so countenances is is you know that's not that's not what you do with your eyebrows and how you paint your face or uh doorbells or earbells or whatever think brother Bradham said they were Satan stirrups the devil stirrups and now he said but uh anyway uh uh that's not what you put on the outside and you know I just don't believe that the big problem is you know Fashions and putting on and all this outside putting on but the question is is sis are you not confident in who you are really are are you not comfortable in your own skin so I I think you know I think we're all kind of tired of a long Litany of do's and don'ts and we just can't keep track of it anymore but but what but what's beautiful to see is someone who's secure in Christ they know who they are they don't have to put on a anything from a new car to a new suit to a New Dress to new makeup or whatever but they just know that they're beloved of the Lord and God made me who I am and my daughter has a little plaque up on her house it says when you come in the door it says just be yourself everybody else is taken that makes you feel right at home you think oh well all right I'm going to take off my shoes and head over to the refrigerator so but the the Bible says that Abigail was of a a beautiful countenance well the Bulgarian Bible it just sits and beautiful and miss the whole thing and then so you see and they look over at my Bible and they go wow you know they missed something but anyway Abigail was under this Nable and he was and he was uh selfish and greedy and and and and he was into politics and he was all he was wanting to watch his football games and he didn't know what the prophet of the Lord said the prophet of Lord had anointed David and he and he wasn't aware of that world but she was she knew that the prophet's words wouldn't fall to the ground and so she was doing something about it but finally God brought her under a different government because nabal when she heard how how generous she was he had a heart attack and that was the end of nabel didn't brother round say If you think you got a little uh complex with something he said go just the opposite he said if you're going to be in a little stingy just just go right the opposite direction hmm sorry about that one so when you travel so so Abigail's under new government sometimes when you travel they're asking about your government you know what's going on in politics over there what's going on with your government and then they always say our government is corrupt and I'm so tempted to say oh no not our government you know we're America you know God and Country it's not God in country I'm sorry to say these things in the great state of Texas but it never was God in country it's just God and we need to forget all of these nationalistic things all of these ethnic things how would you like brother McGarry to come here and talk about cloverleafs and good luck good good luck and and Irish whiskey you know all this ethnic stuff needs to go away we we need to come into Christ and leave the ethnic things behind and it doesn't matter if it's Bulgaria China or DFW so God is governing his church and that's the only government that is not corrupt where man is there's the corruption's just going to want to want to come in there and and then we just got to constantly pray it out and in construction we have this expression the the the devil is in the details and you know you get right down to the Fine points I'm sure it's applicable in many things and you know the devil's hiding in the details and I tell the translator as I said but you know he's going to have a hard time uh uh hiding in this word of God in this work that we're doing we're going to work the details out and we're going to pray and let the Holy Spirit Drive the devil out of the details but God is his government is not corrupt in fact it's the only place to find righteousness and if we go over to Revelations the third chapter and the seventh verse this is the church at Philadelphia and unto the angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy it's only one holy it's very beautiful if you go to this in the church age book and I'm sure where I'm going many of you have been before but uh sure don't hurt to go there again when it's when it's real nice these things saith he that is Holy and he that is true and he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth and it's really wonderful in your life when you can recognize that it's God who opens doors for you and it's God who closes doors for you and I remember a certain place I had a certain job and I came back after being gone and I went to the door and I I went to open the door and it was locked and I thought man I'm a principal character in this operation I'm I would be the one that was doing some of the maintenance if anybody changed the locks it should have been me I wonder what the problem was and I called up another man and I said hey did you guys change the locks while we're gone and he said no I was gonna wait and wondering if you were home I was going to call you and ask you if if you changed the locks so we called up another principle in the operation and they informed us that we don't have keys anymore to the very office that we're working in and that was pretty abrupt like okay that chapter in my life is over and I was all bent out of shape for a long time meditating that one time I'm preaching in Phoenix about brother Branham he's talking about this scripture and he says he's the one that opens and he's the one to shut and right in the middle of the sermon I'm going wow what is wrong with me why am I vexed over the situation it was God that locked that door he shut that chapter in my life he he had me move on to another place in life and he's the one that does those things man doesn't do that to you man is not in control you've given your life to God and God is governing in his church thank you and I think that many of us don't have a problem to accept the sovereignty of God in a measure and sometimes God will raise that bar of how much you're accepting his sovereignty and you think of course I get the picture he's almighty God he can do what he wants there's very beautiful pictures of it brother Branham said when because God's Sovereign his grace he can extend his grace to whom he wants now we might think well that sisters that that slow down now I you know I don't know if there's forgiveness for that but when God stretches out his hand of Grace he is Sovereign he don't have to ask nobody well should I extend Grace should I extend forgiveness and mercy he is Sovereign God in Sovereign he don't ask nobody he can do what he wants he can save the lowest he can he can redeem the orneryist he can he can bring back the most back-sliced slitus well if you fell in the mud it's not pretty you might be stuttering too but I fell a few times like that and I know that he can do it so he sovereign but the picture that God is showing here when he says that he openeth and no man shutteth and he shutteth and no man openeth because he's got the Key of David it isn't that kind of sovereignty it isn't that kind of rulership God is trying to express to us something via the revelation of the prophet of God for an hour he's going to go to these scriptures and show us something else that it's not rulership like you might think it's not the kind of sovereignty that you like you maybe have a picture of so brother Branham starts to talk about David and this great because the scripture says that he hath the Key of David and David was a mighty conqueror he was a warrior he beat down all the nations all around him so Israel could have peace and that's why he couldn't build the temple that he wanted to build because he was a bloody man and David overcame the enemies and established the people and he sat down as a king on the throne so he he had established Israel beat down the envy and now he's sitting on the throne and maybe I'll just walk through some of this I I know you all love your church age books you can find this in the Philadelphian age but you'd read in Revelations here and a lot of times we're just too easy we just we read something we don't know what it refers to and we don't go any farther than that but if you would go just over the margin say in your Scofield bible it would bring you to Isaiah 22 and 22 and that's where brother Branham brings us when he's referring to this scripture he brings us over to Isaiah 22 and 22 and if you have your Bibles and you like to turn with me let's go there and I'm I realized this could be an old lesson to a lot of you I'm I'm sure many would like would have loved or did uh preach on this subject as brother Branham did Isaiah 22 22 and look at how similar it is to this scripture in Revelations 3 and 7. let's just read 21 to kind of lead you into it and I will clothe him with the robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and I will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shut he shall shut and None Shall open so brother random asked the question what does the key signify and he says the answer lies in the position of the key it's not in his hand it's not around his neck it's not in any other person's hand but it's on his shoulder so we read that in Isaiah 9 and 6 that the government shall be upon his shoulder and he gives us the interpretation of Isaiah 9 and 6. what Isaiah 9 and 6 means because I know that in my mind I always had this picture like Atlas the you know the man that they show with the big globe on it she's a muscle man and he's got the whole world and it's amazing in some of those old buildings in Eastern Europe they have under the buildings you know it's a big Stone building and at one point in the building they have this Atlas it gives you the idea that he's holding up the whole building you know it's Atlas and then so in my mind I'm just thinking the government like the noun you know like the government all the governments of the world all the politics all the rulership of the world it's all on his shoulders because he's the great prime minister of it all and brother Branham says this scripture in Isaiah 9 6 comes from the Eastern marriage of the marriage ceremony that's where Isaiah 9 6 comes from is that Eastern marriage where she takes off her veil and when she does she just dips her head a little bit to take it off you know not this Catholic idea of hanging your head down all the time and you know woe is me and I'm a sinner and I should live better for God and I'm just really not being what I should be and you know I just want you to know Lord that I'm not happy with myself and I I I pray that you accept this offering it's kind of an offering I came up with myself but it's it's what I want to give to you is that I want to be sorry and I'm sorry about my condition I'm sorry I don't do better is that what kind of a bride can you imagine a man that wanted a bride and never saw her face but when she takes that Veil off she just dips her head a little my husband my Lord the Lover of My Soul the one who chose me I'm bowing my head and I'm surrendering myself to you I'm putting my Authority or or the responsibility to me over your shoulders we have time just to read that just a moment are you too tired to read a little bit but what does the key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it read Isaiah 9 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is her head that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility isn't it wouldn't it be so terrible to stop at that point and say well I'm not giving up I'm not I'm not going to be anybody's fool I'm I'm not giving up my ambitions I got some plans I got some things I'm going to do Brother David wouldn't it be terrible to stop at that and not come into this next beautiful place that every believer has this feminine spirit because we're the church now let's let's get out of the natural realm and let and let's take our place as his bride that's all of us as a Believer we should desire this feminine place to come under his wing and to come under his and and what blessed my soul saints of God is this word no other man has any right remember over in Jeremiah I don't mean to go on a bunny trail but remember when the uncle came to Jeremiah in the prison and he said buy my land because the right of redemption is yours you're the one that has the right to redeem that's why I came to you because you're in that position the right of redemption is yours so the Bible says no other man has the power and no other has any right and responsibility he is taking responsibility for you responsibility for your natural life responsibility for your spiritual life responsibility for your heart heart that your heart's not going to drift away from him the responsibility for your sound mind he's taking responsibility for you and that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his pride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone is that the way you feel this morning she is wholly committed to him I don't know about you but I don't got no place else to go I don't nobody's going to understand my problem a lot of times I wish I could go to somebody and say you know this is the this is the real Crux of the thing this is the thing that's really slippery about this slope this is the thing in this relationship that is really hard for me to figure out this is the thing where I don't know where I'm at or what if my thinking's right and I could go to somebody but I couldn't have that complete confidence that they knew the very wisdom of almighty God now I could have some confidence that God would help them I believe God puts those gifts in the church he puts people in your life your dad your mom I would I would encourage you young people to hang on to Mom and Dad I know it's tempting to say man they don't owe nothing but God gave you them God gave them to you do you think just God give you to them but it it goes both ways but but even in all of that there's a place you can go where you know that he knows you can go to him and you don't got nobody else like that to go to and she is wholly committed to him I love these words and he accepts that obligation so if you will holy commit yourself to him he's obligated well Street language would just say he's stuck you know somehow you got the Rook over here and you got the king you know just by your honesty just by your pureness of heart you moved the queen over there and the King you know and the bishop you know if you're playing chess I think they'd call that Checkmate but if you take God at his own word and your holy committed to him he accepts that obligation and he says yes I'm obligated he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that's her Delight ask the Lord to forgive me for the times I didn't obey I won't obey I want to be more obedient I want to be under that care but you have to accept it you see rulership would just rule over you whether you accepted it or not but brother Branham said it's your attitude toward the atonement the atonement is true he atoned he he did that at Calvary that blood is perfect blood the cleansing is perfect cleansing but you've got to accept that it's your attitude toward the atonement that blings the blessing to you I wanna not only accept his government I want to embrace it I want to I want to love it and I want to come under that shoulder I want to come into His Embrace is that your desire this morning let's stand together with a foreign [Applause] musicians just whatever you feel led to places brothers and sisters do you feel

I am guilty that's the whole point and I have no place else to turn or go to him he just finally come to the place you say I can't do this I can't do this [Music] and that's why he says that's why I'm
