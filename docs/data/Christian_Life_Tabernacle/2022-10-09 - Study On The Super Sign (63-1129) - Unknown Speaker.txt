[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] my heart desire and I know [Music] my heart these to worship thee you're my friend and you are my brothers [Music] the other so much more than anything foreign [Music] to worship thee foreign [Music] foreign [Music] oh to you [Music] are alone [Music] even if I brought a mic too to pray for the opening of the service and read the Psalms [Music] [Music] [Music] go ahead and bow our heads the service to Him Father we so grateful to you for all things Lord we thank you for your faithfulness and how your lord so faithful to meet each need to come by your way to make yourself known to us father we love you and we so grateful for an opportunity that we might come and hear of you Lord that we might come and worship you Lord that we might come and feel your presence Lord take some time and fellowship with you we commit the service to you asking for you to have your perfect way Lord may your word speak May every need be met Lord you knew the needs that walked in that door before you know the victories that are going to walk out that door more than we can ask father we've just depend upon you now to move on the scene worship you give you all the glory pray this in Jesus name so we're going to do this the old-fashioned way this morning a little bit short-handed you want to turn in your Bibles to Psalm chapter 9 this morning you know I thought it was a timely psalm for the hour that we live in you know we seem to be surrounded on every Hand by people who are out of control you know nations are out of control governments are out of control mankind is out of control there's so many encouraging scriptures in just this one chapter you know that can put us put that all in perspective and remind us who's really in control you know we could spend time on every verse you know and probably be blessed by all of them but as I was reading that it was an interesting statement that David bade a couple times which also caught my attention he said it in verse 1 he said I will praise thee O Lord with my whole heart I will show forth all thy marvelous works and then it says in verse 14. that I may show forth all thy praise that I would show forth all thy marvelous works and that I might show forth all thy praise you know as we read when we read this chapter we're going to see that he's got it all under his control you know everything's coming into its position and though may it seem to us and to others in the world that everything is out of control it's coming into his control so has been in his control you know it's not about us getting things under control it says in verse 10 he says they that Know Thy Name will put their trust in thee for thou O Lord Hast not forsaken them that feare thee you know whatever it is that may be going on in our lives or going on around us in the world he's got this and they that know his name will put their trust in him and he hasn't forsaken them that fear Him so with all that being said in the midst of the chaos or seeming chaos what was David's part what's our part you know it says verse 1 I will praise him that's part of the role that he plays in verse two I will be glad and rejoice in him I will sing praise to his name in verse 11 it says Sing Praises unto the Lord sing and rejoice and praise you know and we have to do that he's worthy of Our Praise but all his praise all his works is more than that you know our lips our voice our shouting the best singing we can bring the best preaching we can bring is a unworthy instrument for the praise to his name you know in verse 11 it says declare among the people his doings you know we all enjoy a good worship service being able to praise and worship him and enjoy his the moving of his spirit and his word within the four walls of this church but there's more to the job you know something even greater than just celebrating his presence you know if we limit this to what happens in a worship service in the four walls of this church then we haven't performed all his praise we haven't performed all his works are we moving beyond just the praise and the rejoicing and are we making declaration among the people are we showing forth his praise and his works you know it says I will show forth all thy marvelous works that's demonstrate verse 14 I will show forth all thy praise that's demonstrate show you know anyone can enjoy his presence in a good service but when the Music Stops and the church dismisses are we showing forth his praise are we demonstrating showing forth his works you know brother Branham said that the bride would be the final voice to the final age but if the only voice we have is when the music is playing and it's within a church service are we fulfilling all his praise and all his works in other words it's incomplete without the demonstration Isaiah 43 21 says this people have I formed for myself they shall show forth my praise it's in the walk it's in the life it's in the actions it's in the day-to-day demonstration of the presence of the Lord first Peter 2 9 says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness and into His Marvelous Light you know as Paul said in First Corinthians 2 4 it's not about how good we can sing or how well we can preach but it was in power and demonstration as it says in second Corinthians 3 2 an epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men not just the ones in this building you know his people the people that he has formed for himself of whom David numbered himself were constructed to show forth all his works and to show forth all his praise and unless we get to the demonstration of his presence rather than just a celebration of his presence then the work is incomplete it's not all praise it's not all His Marvelous works so as I was reading you know Psalm 9 this morning and you know just encouraged by that promise that he's got this he's got it all in control but your part my part is to show forth all his praise to show forth All His Marvelous works as he brings all things under his control so let's just read that together here in Psalm 9. you know that's what stuck out to me I hope that blessed you we'll read that together starting in verse one I will praise thee O Lord with my whole heart I will show forth all thy marvelous works I will be glad and rejoice indeed I will sing praise to thy name O thou most high when my enemies are turned back they shall fall and perish at thy presence for thou has maintained my right and my cause thou saddest in the throne judging right thou has rebuked the Heathen thou has destroyed the wicked thou has put out their name forever and ever o thou enemy destructions are come to a Perpetual end and thou has destroyed cities their memorial is perished with them but the Lord shall endure forever he hath prepared his throne for judgment and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall Minister judgments to the people in uprightness the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble and they that Know Thy Name will put their trust in thee for thou Lord has not forsaken them that seek thee sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth in Zion declare among the people his doings when he maketh Inquisition for blood he rememareth them he forgetth not the Cry Of The Humble have mercy upon Me O Lord consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death that I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation the Heathen are sunk down to the pit that they made in the net which they hid is their own foot taken the Lord is known by the Judgment which he executed the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands Higgin Sila the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget God for the needy shall not always be forgotten the expectation of the poor shall not perish forever arise O Lord let not man Prevail let the Heathen be judged in thy sight put them in fear O Lord that the nations may know themselves to be but men see them foreign [Music] is a journey through the land singing as I go watching social covering [Music] many years [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh I want to sing foreign [Music] [Music]

[Music] of the rain out of the Tomb oh he came with Grace [Music] foreign [Music] oh he's alive he's alive [Music] foreign [Music] our gracious and wonderful precious father [Music] Lord we are so honored to have your presence with us that you would send your spirit to be in our midst to do for us exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask or think father there's no ability in man to even make contact with you you have to open the door and you have to administer Your Love and we're so thankful that you so loved us that you gave your only begotten son we ask you to bless this time of Fellowship this morning around your word father may we be anchored instead fast in your word father may we understand that every victory that we have it's not based on emotion it's not based on feeling it's based on thus saith the Lord we ask you now to grant us your presence in a continual revelation of yourself this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles this morning I'm excited about going through the word with you this morning and and uh fellowshipping around the things of the Lord you know I I find it sometimes that I I I get I watched other people do things and you want to uh a lot of times you want to compare yourself or or you kind of get jealous that you don't go from one end of the platform to the other and you don't have it but I don't have that anymore I used to think I had it but now there's one thing I know that I have and I have a message that God sent and we can all look at that together and it feeds us all the same and it'll be a blessing to us so let's turn in our Bible to Isaiah the uh seventh chapter of the book of Isaiah starting at the 10th verse just bible study this morning going through some quotations and um and fellowshipping around some nuggets we have a lot in Louisiana and some on vacation but we're here and we can have a good time in the Lord amen and to me a good time in the Lord is the opening of his word amen so it says in Isaiah the seventh chapter in the 10th verse it says moreover the Lord spake again that ahaz saying ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God ask it either in the depth or in the Heights above but he has said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord and he said hear ye now o House of David it is a small thing for you to wear him in but will ye weary My God also therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel father bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated this morning once again we can continually to thank you for tolerating the construction where it's starting to go slow uh if ever if you all pray real hard and everything goes good next week we hope that we can start pouring concrete here a week from next not this next week but possibly the week or so after start that and and then if everything goes good maybe we'll have some parking by the time that our meetings come that's November 11th 12th and 13th but we're going to have to move some mountains how many beliefs we can move mountains oh boy we're running on about a quarter of a tank all right well praise God you know why God don't have churches because he says it just takes two or three to agree on any one thing see he's not gonna he's not gonna let us be stalled out by the unbelief don't stop God but I say get enthused join in the the thing and if and and we'll just press and trust the Lord uh I'm excited about this this morning sharing this with you uh and and it just it's a beautiful message it it came on my heart and last uh Wednesday night I believe we listened to the uh message the oncoming storm and and we noticed in listening to that sermon we noticed how that there was so many parallels in that message preached in 1960 that it uh it was almost like it was just directed exactly for the time that were we were sitting here today it had storms in Florida right it had talking of nuclear uh war and destruction how many knows our president was speaking the other day and told a a large group of people he says that were on the doorsteps of Armageddon right right well you know even so come quickly Lord Jesus amen amen that that's a good thing for us for those that are going up you know it might not be too bad for everybody else but for us it's going up and we noticed in that sermon how it talked about disease but what he was talking about was that people fail to heed the warning that there were that he talked about how the the the whether prophets he called him to go out and get all the signs and all the data and everything and then they tell the people there's an oncoming storm there's there there's there's uh coming it's just like we have these Sirens that go off it's because all the conditions are right for a tornado for a a a a twister and you'll see the dark clouds and you'll start to see them swirl I've seen many a little hook come down out of the cloud and everything's right that the conditions are right and when the conditions are right for something you take heed you know what I mean you take warning and we also heard another beautiful nugget he said there's no need of giving a warning unless there's a place safety to run to in other words it wouldn't be a warning if you couldn't do something or make some uh sort of preparation to avoid uh what is being warned about so there's a warning given so there's got to be a place of of shelter and that's what they do why do they put the sirens out that it's it's it's to tell you take heed find a place of safety and and they give all the instructions about which a place of safety is go to the center of the house you know we have that little bathroom in the center of our house you know what I mean and and We've ran in there a time or two you know and maybe you bring a mattress in there with you or some pillows or or whatever and the wind's blowing and the tops of the trees are coming out and and boy you learn to pray I think that would be good if we had a few more tornadoes come through the neighborhood and and and maybe get a get Earnest with God learn how how to pray and so there's got to be a place of safety else the warnings of no avail you know what are you telling me in other words it's not as it's not a sentence of Destruction how would you like if the if the flash came over the news in a few minutes you will be no more there's a storm coming and there's nowhere to avoid it there's no place to run why you can tell that to the world today there's only one place to run and that's Christ when he preached the great message choosing of the Bride he says o Los Angeles Los Angeles dogs and felt that thou self above the city of Ames but Thou shalt be brought into the lowest tale and and and he said flee flee into Christ that's your only place of safety so we understood that by that sermon that that God sends warning and and what we took out of it as a congregation was are are we um in tune or hearing or seeing on or understanding the warnings you understand so we we know that uh and we'll get into this a little bit this morning but we we know that the message has a great great teaching teaching of the godhead teaching of water baptism teaching of of uh the gifts of the Spirit and the evidences of the spirit at the teachings of the church ages and who The Messengers are it has the opening of the seals that is the Revelation and the revealing of the son of perdition and how that God stood in his Seven Ages we have those great parts of the message but within the framework of the message is also a warning to his sheep of what to be a wary of you understand what to be aware of and and that we need to we need to be able to heed the warning heed the warning so uh this message that we're going to Fellowship in this morning is a message that brother bran preached uh 11 29 up 63 called the super sign and I I just felt in my heart I felt led to to go this way to listen to this message it came on my heart and and uh I always try to when it comes to the time when I start waiting for a sermon that's the way that I do I wait for a sermon I ask the Lord what would you have me bring to the people you know I I don't try to go and make a sermon and then present it in such a manner that it's acceptable all right okay so what I do is I just wait on the Lord and and usually I look for the direction from the Lord to the message to a message and those of that have known me for a long time you know I usually stay within the framework of one message I I don't try to go take a lot from this message and a lot from this message because I feel that the message was given with a message and if you can get the message that's in the message then you've accomplished a lot now I find out that there's a lot more message in a message than I'm capable of comprehending but I still try to to glean from it and so there was many things that stood out to me in this in this uh this message and uh and so I I just kind of want to go through it uh with you this morning and and and fellowship with these things and we want to kind of still hold that standpoint of recognizing the warning and and our messenger preached a message to us he called recognizing your day and its message and uh so uh that's a very good uh thought to understand that God's got something for us and so as we we start this little uh sermon out uh of course we just read the same scriptures that brother Branham read and he makes he makes this statement in paragraph tell 12 uh if the brothers are more than welcome to put these uh paragraphs up there because my heart says are is that you identify with the message that the message becomes something to you that you know it can be understood by you and revealed to you by God that it is the The Source uh uh in its a way that God hath chosen to speak to you so you can you can find out that you can be in many many circumstances life circumstances different circumstances I remember one time that uh we were considering um you know whether we should uh put our daughter in gymnastics or or or or something like that you know and this is years and years ago uh she's just a young girl at that time and we didn't have all the tapes available to us we didn't have them on online if if you wanted to listen to a tape I got reel to reels and and you got out the machine and you threaded it and you started playing it you know and you prayed that your player was good enough it wouldn't eat it up the tape and and you listen and at that time uh brother Doug mccuse and Roy borders begin to print brother random's messages in their garage in Tucson Arizona that was the beginning of the spoken word and then they got to Jeffersonville and they began to print out books and they begin to say send them out and you would get on the mailing list and then every month or or so maybe every two months a message book would come and and that's how you learned you know you just didn't pick a word you know what I mean and then go to 50 different messages no you had to sit there and read the whole message you know what I mean and I I feel that's part of the problem is that people aren't getting the message that's in each message because they've chopped it all up into quotes it's just you here this morning so uh you know you know I get on my soapbox every now and then but that's I can't help myself but it you know so they'll have a subject matter and and the contents of the message what the spirit of the word of God is that he's trying to present to us the the whole picture that he's drawing and the placing of the statements and the quotes in their context and continuity is lost but we couldn't do that when we got it we we didn't know what was in there don't you wish you could approach this message the same way I think you ought to I think when you are put on a tape you ought to sit there and say I don't know what's in here why because there's spiritual food in there for you today it's a FR it's a fresh cooked meal you know what I'm saying and and uh and your appetite changes things Leslie's cooked a lot of the same dishes to me over the years but when I'm really really hungry man that's just really really outstanding you you know what I mean it it it's really good at you know I told somebody one time I said you know I don't really like that they said you're not hungry enough yet you know that's how I learned to love I love deviled eggs now wish they weren't called deviled eggs but I don't mind eating up the devil so uh uh it's good but what I was pointing out to you is that so I I went to the door with this question on my heart and opened up the book and I can't quote the quote exactly right I remember how it spoke to me but it was on the lines go ahead and let your daughter do such and such and turn her into a street walker or something of that nature and I got my answer right there I believe those answers are still lying in the framework of God's word I I think if you have a question on your heart a doctrinal question wondering something that uh is uh a burden on you that the word of God is a place that you can go to and and my heart's desire is that each of you would have that relationship with the word of God how old can you be Brother David before you can have your relationship well I've seen six years old choose phones I don't care when they're old enough to listen to you they're old enough to listen to God so the the this is what our desire is as a pastor is to have a group of people that's associated with God's word I don't want to do your religion for you it's a warning it's a curse amen second hand Revelation is what's holding the church back but let us read this statement he says it said he says here he says but remember God's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to be all done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire what a teaching right there God does not predestinate by his desire he predestinated by foreknowledge he knew the beginning from the end he knew what you would do he knew the mistakes you made because he knew he would fall he knew you were shaped in sin uh born in sin shaped in iniquity came in the world speaking lies he made Provisions for you he had Grace for you he had mercy for you he knew you'd have an ear to hear so he made sure you heard the word but he doesn't predestinate by his desire he is not willing that any should perish but by his foreknowledge he knew who would accept it and who would not therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's clicking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he knew that we would live in this day he knew that this would be our day and he plans for this day and he had plans for this day he has plans for every day he never has one of his plans ever fail he is always on time now that that is a a great statement because this now places you in a very serious position because God's got plans for your day he's got plans for every day he's got a plan for this day he's got a plan for this hour he's got a plan for this time so it would behoove us as followers of God's word to question ourselves is what is the plan and we ought to seek it we ought to seek his face we ought to seek his will what is the will father what is the will for the activity of my day what is your will for my spirit what is your will for my nature what what what you've got to plan now I don't create a plan and I don't create God's plan and and I I can't say dear and tell you that what God's plan is for your life that's something that you've that you as an individual needs to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling and you could remember that God's mindful of you so if you were predestinated you were predestinated in his foreknowledge so he knew you he knew you'd accept it he made Provisions for you and he made a plan for your life we've went over this many times something that he has for you to do so if you don't seek that plan then what you're doing is is you're cloaking yourself in religion you're saying I believe and therefore it's what I believe that saves me did I make that clear in other words it's my doctrine that saves me it's the teachings that I accept that saved me the only salvation comes in the person of Jesus Christ in your life and he cannot reveal himself to you personally without him revealing his word to you which was his thoughts expressed or his plan so each of you are important and nobody can take your place because he has a plan for your life he's got a plan for your day he's got a plan and we we are in the lady of seeing age and so we've got to be very careful about being lukewarm and thinking that don't matter and everything's going to happen just the way it's going to happen oh where is the sign of his coming everything continues on as it is but remember the warning Swift destruction when they say peace and safety beware so we all want to understand this great warning that that there is and that God has given us signs and those signs go unnoticed and I mean I'll give you a sign he said an everlasting sign a great sign a virgin shall conceive how many think on Earth that that day knew a virgin conceived the greatest sign that God ever give goes unnoticed now most of the signs that God give go unnoticed but you got to remember that you've been chosen and elected to seek the signs because signs do two things they warn you and direct you so you see a sign and it shows us arrow and it's got a little number under it 25. that doesn't that means the road is quick crooked up ahead and go through this safely at 25 miles an hour it doesn't mean oh boy a crooked Road I can go 50. well that's fine if there's nobody else maybe but people sometimes forget they have other people in the car with them that they're responsible for other people on the road that they're responsible for that's why the prophet of God somebody that's he says that gets in a car drunk ought to be charged with premeditated murder because there's zero responsibility involved so not only are you responsible for yourself but you're also responsible because you are written Epistles red of all men and people are watching your life how did you respond to the events and signs that are transpiring around us and we've really got to the place where the ministry and and the people and one another we don't hold ourselves accountable we've lowered the standard by which we should live by we've lowered our accountability and we've written ourselves off just by saying we're predestinated we're gonna be there well you might be there but I'd like to be there with full reward I don't know who's going to be there or not but it's pretty evident by the gospel the people that are going to be there are going to be word living people and I'm not trying to preach condemnation today I'm trying to say that just like anybody if you're not given a hundred percent then let's pick it up a little bit if you're not doing your part then let's see what your part could be we can't do one thing about yesterday all we can do is cry Abba Father apply the blood leave those things which are behind behind him what press for a higher calling that collects our our desire so we we point out something in the the title of this message is super sign now the prophet of God is trying to point something out to us he says he says this is what we call a superage everything that you see nowadays must be super and I I won't re-continue reading but he points out everything super right supermarket super this super that it's always better I I don't even know what a razor blade they're on now you know it got track five now and and Ultra Glide and Super Glide and and and all this stuff pretty soon you're just gonna have to open a box and your hair is going to fall off your face everything's super you know it's always new and improved new and improved well every time I see new and improved I wonder what's the junk I was using before why didn't you do that the first time now you might just sit there and not uh take heed to that but there's no more Corner Grocery Stores they're all what supermarket and and so and they used to be just regular grocery stores right but they're not Target anymore what are they now Super Target Super Walmart because everybody buys into better that's what that's what it is did you know that's a sign it's a sign of the time and I just like to read these things to you because he said he says in paragraph 20 he says I think even the women is getting super dressing Modern Age the old-fashioned shoes they had some leather in them you'd buy them about three dollars a pair the very best kind had more leather than them than a dozen of pairs got today you got to pay 25 for but it has to be the Super type you know heals about like that and I I don't know I preach against heels all the time and I I believe that some of the sisters wear high heels because they just don't no sisters that's your job I am not going to try to go up to a sister and say wow sister I noticed your shoes you know those heels are awful High come on mothers Elder women teach the younger you know I mean I know we get these Fashions and these European Fashions and Fashions you know these ones were the the guys come around and they wear their pants like you know like this and all that like that you know what I mean and they they got they don't only have no socks on and and all that they look like woman's pedal pushers on a man come on I don't know I don't think your legs look so sharp that you gotta wrap them up like a wiener so he talks about weiner dresses on women and here's guys wearing wiener pants wake up okay Brothers you spiritual Brothers no I know a lot of culture you know you don't you don't ever say nothing to nobody but you go talk about them behind their back because it's impolite look it we're not about polite when it comes to saving lives there's an instance of a a jet plane in in an Asian airliner crashed and killed I don't know how many people because in their culture you never said anything to the person who was in charge four other Pilots or three other Pilots sat in that cockpit knowing that this Captain was in air and wouldn't stand up and save his life their lives and the lives of the people because they didn't want to be embarrassed come on if I can embarrass you and get one safe yeah then Lord help me with that in other words uh we need to start policing ourselves we need to be have a spiritual mind to be able to look around and say wait a minute man this is out of hand sister you can police yourselves about your clothes about whether something's too tight or not I would hope that the church is farther along that and the prophet of God said we can't teach you algebra because we don't have some of our ABC's down you teach your ABCs to one another you go to one another you talk to one another you help one another you know what I mean sit down go with them in a spirit of love that's how it's taught in the scripture you go to that person and it's pure love you pray you get up you go to them you sit down you talk to them you say you know you're wearing these fashions we just don't wear those fashions they're not good for the house of the Lord no I I can't govern you outside of this place but there are certain things we want to do here you know what I mean and we have we have rules for the sanctuary and I know there's a lot of things that we can't take care of right now because we don't have the facilities but when we have the facilities to keep the sanctuary holy and to keep us acting right then don't be a uh afraid if we're going to have to start getting rid of some bad habits of course it's always easier not to start the habit than it is to break it but anyway so we we understand that everything's super right we got super highway super freeway super this super that everything's super like he said about these shoes he says but it it has to be the Super type you know heels about like that no toes in it but it's super you see it the thing you have to almost be in super curves to walk in it you see that's right everything has got everything has got crazy to me see but it's a super age it's a super time how many catch that principle do you all understand that right everything's got to be better the newest better biggest fastest quickest more Super now do you understand that's a sign now that's the question as this has been going on Church of the Living bride elect lady Spirit-filled believer wife of the Lord Jesus Christ those are your titles that's your description have you recognized and understood that all this superness this super technology is a sign of God let's just look at it verse 20 acts excuse me paragraph twenty all these seeing signs are the marking of a spiritual Darkness all these things that we see happening in these super super super if we only knew it what is it it's the sign of spiritual Darkness let's go down and just read farther we're in a hurry we've got to get there and what do we do when we get there used to take walk home from work used to be that kids had to walk to school and now they have a bus to come to the door and pick them up and escort them into school and out of school and then pay half a million dollars for a recreation room to give them a little exercise or they die well they used to get it walking to school super age Now isn't that right even the Church of have to have they ain't got enough activity among them they have to get a room where they can all play and jump up and down used to be the spirit made him do that but now they have to get out there out there some sort of super time see all leading to a spiritual Darkness a great day that we're living in all of this superness all of this Modern Trend all of this making it easy being able to pull up this being able to pull up that being able to look this man I know everything now ask me a question where's my phone people don't have to use their mind they don't have to memorize you know what's happening people used to memorize scripture I find myself oh I won't look that up I know the scripture something in my mind somewhere but what I'll do is I'll just when I get there I'll ask my phone because I don't even have to quote it right I just got to say and it shall be in the days of King James Version there it is did you understand that God has been warning us that if it's causing us to go into spiritual Darkness oh we think we're bigger and brighter and better than ever but you know the difference between sitting down and reading your Bible and meditating on it and looking it up is that it doesn't stay here it drops into your heart how many understand the process of the will of God do you know the prophet that God taught that how many have read in the message and understand I know I'm challenging you left here a little bit this morning but I'm not doing it in Anger I'm doing it in warning in Awareness the prophet of God says it starts in your mind then it drops into your heart and becomes the will of God you know why where when does the spiritual Darkness go away the spiritual Darkness goes away when something drops into your heart we don't hardly have anything drop into our hearts anymore because it doesn't stay there very long you know what they call it they call it the news cycle people's EX attention span they have to have something new to stimulate them something new to this you can remember just a few months ago or maybe a year ago now I don't know how long war in Ukraine war in Ukraine you don't see it something new and better has come along no you know what's come along something darker mama is dark darker because these are signs all of its leading to spiritual Darkness the great day that we're living in now you know his people God's people of the Bible has always been warned of God to watch for the signs of the time God's people by God has always been worn to watch for the signs of the time so what was Wednesday night about it was a warning that challenging us are we watching for the signs of the time do we even know what the signs of the time are can we read the signs of the time are you able to read the world that you're living in spiritually you better because this is the age that Satan appears as an angel of Light and the only way he can be discerned is be discerned by the word of God you can't discern Satan by denomination you can't discern them by creeds you can't discern them by a social gospel there's only one way he can be discerned and that's by the revealed word of God there's there's no other way you just you just you you'll miss it look and so he said now look let's just read here a good he says about to watch the signs of the time Jesus when he was on Earth he said to the Pharisees of the day he said you blind Pharisees you go out in the evening and you look and see the skies are clear and red and say tomorrow you'll say it'll be a clear day and he said then you go out and there's lowering angry looking then you say tomorrow there'll be foul weather he said you can discern the face of the Skies but the signs of the time you can't discern now let's get real okay how's our discernment people have lost discernment they're being fed stuff that they don't even realize I I'm going to preacher and and it's just the truth but all this gender identity making girls wonder if they're girls and boys all it is is a bunch of perverts trying to get a bunch of new Young subjects that that they can enter in to all kind of perverted acts with parents if you find out that stuff's going on you go to that principle I know some of you mothers don't think you can homeschool if you want to know I I'm I'm for everybody that homeschools I'll support you 100 percent if you have to send your kids to public school get involved don't let them you know I had a brother come the other day he said my my daughter Ken I think 10 or 12 or daughter came to home and says Dad how do I detail whether I'm a boy or a girl or not well someone's wants her to get her mind messed up for some reason you know what the scripture says he snares their conscience with a hot iron giving them over to perversion working that which is unseemingly man with man and woman with woman have you been able to discern that when you first heard it did your spiritual antennas go up and say wait a minute this is a sign well we ought to have known that a long time ago because we were told as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom okay so Okay so we've got to be in tune but Satan is trying to make us spiritually dead substituting religion in other words no activity in the spirit I believe the message well great news to y'all Satan knows William Branham fulfilled Malachi 45. and he's more afraid of it than most of us he said foul weather he said you can discern the face of the Skies but the sign of the times you can't discern said if you would have known me you would have known my day if you'd known Moses he said you'd have known me because Moses spoke of me in otherwise I have been saying they would have known that the scriptures that must be fulfilled in that day was being fulfilled and they didn't know it now we talked about a plan of God and there's a plan of God that's going to be fulfilled in this day but do we know it see we've got complacent thinking it's all over can't do it wake up Shake ourselves let's get back in with God that's good let's get back connecting to the message let's leave those things which are behind behind no condemnation here everybody's name's on the book of life you're all going but you got to find the way to go before you get there I don't want to be elected and be spinning around in the circles and have to have God slap me flat on my back somewhere on a bed looking up at the ceiling for me to get my mind back in focus he said they he says in other words they would have known the scriptures that must be fulfilled in that day being fulfilled and they didn't know it they had their eyes were so set on their traditions and things until they couldn't see the actual scriptures unfolding before them I'll make what a warning that's a warning hey can you see the actual scriptures unfolding before you now young ladies you can't get so love sick with some boy that that's all that's on your mind and then miss every warning sign that he might give you that ain't the right one and vice Versi look I can't get a soul love sick kind of girl they want to drop out of church he's going to get away anything that tells them no no no no he just shuts off shuts off I'm not gonna listen this is what my heart said on I'm I'm just gonna go it you remember the story of the guy that picked up the snake put the snake in his pocket because it was freezing oh the snake got nice and warm and everything he felt it moving around there he said oh I think I can let the snake go he reaches it in his pocket and the snake bites him he said snake I loved you why did you bite me he said you knew I was a snake when you put me in your pocket have we got so narrow-minded have we got so disinterested in spiritual things that the evidence signs that something's not right go to the store pick up one of those bananas that's got all black on the peel and don't get mad when it's got brown spots and it's mushy when you go and peel it every sign told you that that banana was over ripe I got a couple of them sitting in the uh basket at home if anybody wants to come you know so you know what I do when I walk by those bananas I look at them I say banana bread where's the Walnut I was going to make some banana bread the other day while Leslie was gone but when I realized that I couldn't open the washing machine I figured I was a far cry from uh cooking something about get back now let's follow this down and you don't mind this is Sunday school right everybody okay anybody that if you have to go I totally understand if you get bored you can get up and run around you can go to that playroom brother bran was talking about he said they couldn't see the actual scriptures unfolding he said I would like in that age to that he said to this age now he says now we find about the same thing exists today this paragraph 25. when we know that we're living in the hour of gross darkness is covering the earth and the people everybody understand that everybody understand it's a sign every understand everything going super everything going modern was assigned to the church that spiritual Darkness was starting to set in fact you in other words this it's a great cloud it's a great fog of technology and knowledge and wisdom and and and uh the great civilization and education and science is moving over America and moving over the church and bringing spiritual Darkness oh I can see better than I ever can but that's not the kind of spiritual sight we need stay with me would you I'm just trying to point these things out he said among the fine people sometimes they fail to see it they just walk away honestly I would be discouraged it would discourage me if I didn't know that Jesus said what he did about it that no man can come except my father draws him and all the father hath given me will come they never be able to see it he said well did Isaiah speak of you saying you have eyes but can't see ears that can't hear it's a pitiful sight but that's the way they were now let me say it again that's not your lot you're not in that group of people you've been given I Sav that you can see but sight is the same as faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by what the word of God so this morning God has given us Isaac washing our eyes washing our hearts washing our minds calling out to us warning us their spiritual Darkness and what's the warning it gets covered up with Revival it gets covered up with fancy preaching it gets covered up with people thinking they're joining movements this is an individual affair I don't want to be dark you could be part of a church and blind as a bat I counsel thee to buy a meme let's just read paragraph 25. now we find just about the same thing exists today when we know that we're living in the hour of gross darkness is covering the earth and the people and we find that all these modern achievements technology all these modern achievements of this super age and so forth that we're living in is only a sign of gross darkness in the spiritual Realm not the historical Realm God sent a prophet the seals are open not in the historical Realm not in the doctrinal realm baptism not in those realms not in the natural Realm but it's in the spiritual Realm and what book the spiritual women you think of that I wrote it like this for my own self but what are the spirits doing to our lives not the not the the outward sign but the spirit behind it those 200 000 demon demons that were released on the bride those spiritual we fight what spiritual wickedness in high places what are the spirits it's like all this modern Christian music I had people get up in a great big Huff because I wouldn't allow certain groups To Be Sung go ahead run away go to some place they'll let you sing all that Honky Tonk rock and roll be a big church star all right you know what I mean come back and everything looked fine everything hunky-dory but it's the spiritual realm that we're getting dark into we don't recognize the spiritual realm we don't recognize the spirits that they're moving we don't recognize the effect you know the prophet of God warns the church he says you're all one big happy group he said but somebody will come in and they'll spread just a little poison what's that doing to you spiritually I hope we never measure our church my number that's right I hope we measure by men and women who can recognize the spirit of God they can recognize Satan in every single one of his tricks and they'll withstand them with the pure unadulterated word of God it's the spiritual Realm not to the movement of the spirit not to the Rain falling man may I just jump ahead the paragraph uh 166. it said brother sister we are living in the days of the supermarket super jet Super Highway super race super everything there is a super sign we've had signs of religion we've had signs of Revival we've had signs of getting together we've had signs of speaking in tongues we've had signs of healing to sick we've had all these signs they're they're those are the signs they're trying to throw out to the people now they're missing the sign if I get too long this morning you don't have to come back tonight okay whatever sign you want to take right the spiritual Realm we're in the lady of cnh where either just lukewarm [Music] since when did the the church start giving up evening services so they can play basketball they're letting it down but because we have the get together sign we have the Revival sign we have all the other signs all we have to do to am I preaching too crazy but all we have to do to make all of our lukewarmness go away is just have a good shouting Revival has some real hard uh uh healing preaching have some real hard lay it down boy get everybody excited tell everybody who they are tell them all their names are on the Lamb's Book of Life they're all going tell them we're the ones we're the Revival were it we're all together this is what he spoke of and spiritually don't even recognize the question is what are these spirits that are in the world working all this thing what is it doing to us spiritually is our spiritual awareness more acute than it's ever been or are we getting lukewarm cold formal getting to the place we know it all we gotta shake ourselves we got to be aware it's the spiritual realm they're lukewarm they go to church and people does and seem to have real Zeal to go to church but to know anything about the spirit I'm not saying this it's a warning from our messenger I'll close up I won't get all but I'm gonna I want to take this next part and I'll close there maybe finish up tonight of course you could always go home and get the book and sit down and listen to the tape and then you'll know exactly what I'm preaching they seem to have Zeal to go to church but to know anything about the spirit the time that they're living in some of them are as blind as they can be about those things no matter what God would do or how well it would be proved by his word they just can't see it I wonder if it isn't just about like that what he said we have eyes but we can't see we ought to look around and see all these things what's happening are a sign at the end is at hand because these are the things that was predicted to be at that time we ought to be able to look around and see these things so you see I'm a I'm just a pastor okay it's the lowest one of all the gifts on the totem pole and I accept that but I want you to know the the pro there's a lot of other things than this message that if we don't get serious we're letting slip by and you're accountable for them what does it say in Revelations 3 18. I may I mean just I mean that that's the the scripture for our very age that we live in let me just you go ahead and put it up there if you if you have a brother in my in Revelations uh 3 18. they said I count thee to buy of me gold tried and Fire that that may ask be rich and weight reiniment that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness does not appear now listen to this verse it doesn't say bye it says an anoint thine eyes with isab that thou mayest see that is a warning for our age that's our messenger the Angels little lady'll see it telling the church anoint your eyes with I said that you can see because Satan appears as an angel of Light you've got to be able to discern the signs of the times you've got to be able to discern the spirit you got to be able to turn the darkness that's coming on we got to be able to evaluate ourselves be honest with ourselves sit into the mirror and say am I carnal or I'm spiritual or am I lukewarm a little of both and I need to press to spirituality now I was going to go through this little section here but I'm going to skip it and and brother REM talks about how the signs always foreruns his events right like the birds the the geese they when it gets cold they go south when it gets hot they go north right the Cycles always been the same everything four runs the event or whatever there's there's always something that foreruns God always fore runs the event he says his signs always foreruns his events just as it does he says and that's what he says he says when you see geese going you see buds coming on you see leaves of hauling off see it's the continuity of nature blending in God's laws of nature Blends in he foreruns his events he always has been it never will fail it never fails then he says God's prophets prophets are the chief sign God's chief sign is a prophet so what does he always saying he always sends a prophet to forerun he never sends judgment upon the Earth without first sin that's paragraph 40 sending a prophet search the scriptures a prophet is the chief sign of God to his people that he has sent this person this certain person like Noah like Moses like Elijah and all the prophets he sends them to manifest the word for that age and give his people a warning of all these other signs we've seen the chief sign we've seen a prophet of Malachi 4 5. the Fulfillment of God's word we've seen that sign now I want to add this because this meant very much to me personally and I hope that I can drive it home because the prophet of God preached the in the message the voice of God he said there's so many voices today people pointing you everything to the wrong way and then he stands there and he says I am the voice of God to you now I know you resented that and then he says but I am the voice of God to you so as a pastor this morning I'm encouraged Curry to get back into your spiritual Realm to put on your spiritual glasses the prophet of God said your spiritual thinking cap understand this whole super trend is a sign of gross spiritual Darkness and Satan keeping people from the spiritual Realm don't let Satan blind you burden you clutter your mind so you miss the spiritual Realm God don't care about your sins he's forgiven your sins most of us can make our sins right do right say you're sorry apply the token get rid of the stuff that's eaten you up he's already forgiven you but the chief sign is a prophet and he says when God gets ready to send judgment before he sends judgment he sends a prophet to manifest his word his word this is paragraph 42 and 43. vindicates the word of that age he he did it in all other ages he promised to do it in this age he will do it in this age regardless of what the people say about it he'll do it anyhow because he cannot break his continuity it's the way he planned he always does it the same way he never fails to do it like he did it the first time so everything's happening just right like John the Baptist now we had 400 years the malachite to John and there's been no sign a prophet of the Old Testament but as long as the space at least the time of the judges that they're ever what that they ever was without a prophet what's the matter now I'm asking you this morning to jump with me into the spiritual Realm and listen to this what's the matter why didn't they have a prophet during that time there was no word placed for that time think of it they didn't have a prophet because there was no word placed for that time there was no word placed for that time they had to wait until the time got right they had to wait now no word place for that time so we understand that God has a time that he places his word now remember if it's not spoken before it happens it's not prophecy is that right so we understand that we had Malachi 4 5. he prophesied all these things we listened to the prophecy Wednesday night and stood back in awe how the world condition could be identical speaking of nuclear storms in Florida's diseases how many other statements in there that what was in there was going on right at the moment and now we realize his prophesied and we're sitting here this morning we're seeing the gross Darkness the spiritual decay all these things why because there's a word that is placed for this time okay it's his plan there's something a word that's placed for this time oh if we could grab a hold of it if we could know it's there if we could look at all the warning signs we know part of the word that's placed for this time is what the translation of the Bride the placing of the bribe the positioning of the Bride those are things we've got to take into our heart personally but you wonder why why wouldn't there a Prophet there was no word place for the time why did the prophet of God come in our day that many times since John Paul why did a prophet the chief sign show up in this day because there was a word placed here for this day that's the word you must make personal contact with don't let somebody else do your religion for you there was no word placed now all of a sudden I see a prophet I see the signs I see some Gomorrah and all of a sudden what's that telling me yeah I'm not here as an observer that was a prophet that was a sign that's the truth is Lady osia it's this is evil that's evil that's not what that's not the elect lady that's religion that's church members that's theology this is a spiritual Realm the spiritual realm tells a Believer there's a word that's been placed for this time and you can't rely on the sign of getting together the sign of religion the sign of Revival and all those signs you've got to understand because that there is a word that's been placed for our day there's a work at that time had to wait until it got so we know there's a word it says he said and what a what a warning he said that it took all that between that time so the church guy he says now nothing has taken place between that time so the church just got slothful and went on its own way until the time of Promise draws nigh the time of what God's got for the bride but the bride has got to heed the warning she got to get into the spiritual Realm it's not going to be done by preachers it's going to be done by the hunger of your heart you anointing your eyes with isab and entering in now in closing then I I had so many things to go but I'm just going to settle with this I don't need to go into all the teachings of Malachi 4 5. but I'd like just to say this because this is part of the warning that I believe with all my heart that the bride is slipping away from and I let me just read it if that you would it's paragraph 54 and Out close promise you with this that's the way the gospel is today it can only be seen in the way that God presents it to you and if it's presented to you outside of the continuity of the Bible and it's not God telling you that It could only be seen by the way that God presents it to you now I want to inform you I am not Malachi 4 5. I am not Luke 17 30. I am not Revelations 10 7 though I am all of those but I am those because I've accepted the way that God chose to present it the only way it could be seen is by the way that God presents it and remember God interprets his word by a prophet he sent the message by Malachi 4 5. he gave the sign the only way you're going to receive the plan of God is to receive it by the way that God sent it it's not second hand I love church I love church people I love preaching the gospel I Love The Gospel but God gave every single one of us a message and in our day here a way to hear it don't worry about the guy that's out there sitting on the backside of uh Tibet somewhere if he's God will take care of him but much is given of whom much is given much is required he chose you and elected you to see first of all the signs to see the chief sign to see the Vindicated word to see the ministry of the son of man and now to come to the full realization that the the plan the God's word that's been allotted for our age he has a way for you to see it and it's through that great message and I'll say this in closing again brothers and sisters we are living in the days of supermarkets super jets Super Highway super races super everything else and there's a super sign we've had the sign of religion we have this sign of Revival they're shaking those signs in front of us now but remember the only place you're gonna hear it and see it is from the source that God chose to reveal it I will do nothing until I first reveal it to my servant the prophet we've had signs of getting together we have scientists speak in it as we have signs of Healing The Sick we've had all these signs but yet we find in the Bible that the last sign before the sun promised Sun arrived it was a super sign Jesus says As it was then before the promised Sons arise that the super sign would come on the Earth again I declare to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ it's on earth now not only that but it's right here among us tonight the Holy Ghost God's super sign the resurrected Jesus Christ it cannot fail it's an eternal sign it can never be changed heavens and earth will pass away but that it will never change it's an eternal Everlasting sign God manifested in human flesh God makes himself known in human flesh oh Hallelujah what was Luke 17 30. what was the last sign Luke the one that the only way you could receive it was the way that he presented it the last sign was God failing himself in flesh speaking to you every warning not only that because you are in this mind but you weren't manifested yet he put it on tapes and books where you could have access to it and read it and it can do the same thing to you than it did to the believer that accepted it then he's the same yesterday today and forever isn't that beautiful he's got do you believe that to be the truth with all your heart you believe it don't shut yourself up like a turtle in a shell if there's any turtle in you take the shell out let the Holy Spirit come in don't close yourself to some Creed or denomination brothers and sister the hour has arrived and I believe that God has done as much as he's going to do the next thing is action of the church or either we're going to be you think it's the action of us running out and going to hospitals and laying and the action of the church is anointing their eyes with I sap that they can see the action of the church is the return to the spiritual Realm we've had to get together sign we've had the religious sign we've had the Revival sign what's the last thing for the church it's the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom in the Earthly bright it's every believer making contact with the revealed word of God for the hour you believe that this morning I'm sorry I kept you let's Stand Together oh glorious Victory brother Steve are you anywhere to sing we know that's all glorious victory hallelujah what a victory what an election you you understand that if we were in any other Church in this city they would just think that they wouldn't have any idea what in the world we're talking about but you see it you see it you sense it remember the prophet God said do you see that you see it do you feel it you know it's true you know what's true what a beautiful call what a beckoning let's get back to being spiritual let's get back to feasting let's get back let's leave those things which are behind let's anoint our eyes with thy Sav let's do these great things amen if you just this morning would like to ask God to blow the spirit on the coal of your heart if you don't see as clearly as you'd like to see if you feel that there's maybe things that are getting past you that you're not recognizing and you'd like to lift your heart to him this morning say Lord I want some ice have I want to enter into a spiritual realm I just I I feel a little dry boned I've let my past hold me down I've let my past mistakes and failures I I've let people come around and make my heart bitter and make me afraid but Lord I I want you to restore the joy of my salvation I want you to restore my appetite for your word Lord I want to start praying and receiving revelation I don't want to just be tossed to and fro I don't want to go with the crowd I don't want to go I just don't want to accept everything that just comes my way Lord I want you to give me some spiritual backbone I want you really to [Music] get my heart set right again on your message in your messenger Lord I've let a lot of people do my religion for me people say brother Branham said and I accept it with never going looking never reading never bringing it to my heart myself Lord in fact if I am honest with you I really don't have any leadership in my life at all I'm just being pushed down this the river of time and just going from door to door and I don't have any real spiritual leadership in my life foreign I don't have a place I'm grounded to that I know is truth Eternal truth and I'm asking this morning Lord that you would ground me this morning I'm opening my heart I see this morning that you stood at the door and knocked and I want to open up this morning and I want to allow you to come in and talk to me spiritually [Music] give me isap that I might see that my spiritual man can arise this morning foreign Lord that's what we need Lord I've preached this morning with all my heart as honest as I could be Lord I trust that the people know I love them Lord Lord you understand how much I understand that you chose a prophet to bring this message you so one-man invasion a one-man source of Revelation you told us Lord to hit on the high places and I've tried to follow that this morning hit on the high places the things that you said the wonderful things you pointed out but Lord it takes your spirit to deal with the heart and I ask that you would deal with the heart this morning and if there's one here this morning they'd like to draw closer to you than they've been and they'd like to lift their hand to you father Lord set me off flame again make this message real to me again make it like it was the first days I opened the books the first time I pressed the button don't let it be common to me Lord but may I receive the spiritual leadership and the way that you chose for us to see it was only the way that you presented it father and you presented it and stored it up in a storehouse that we can go there and live and eat I can't change that Lord you didn't choose me to be the source the Lord I believe you called me to make the source available I've
