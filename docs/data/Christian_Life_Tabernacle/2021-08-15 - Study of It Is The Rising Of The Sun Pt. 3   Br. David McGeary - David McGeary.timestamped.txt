[14:44] opportunity to be in your presence lord
[14:46] god

[14:49] that you would move and minister by your
[14:52] spirit lord god
[14:54] we come this morning lord god with our
[14:56] souls hungry and thirsty for your word
[14:59] lord god
[15:01] feed us lord god
[15:03] till we want no more lord god
[15:06] we believe by faith that you're doing a
[15:08] new thing in our midst lord god
[15:10] we're so grateful for the man of god and
[15:13] for the word of god lord god we pray
[15:15] that you would anoint him and continue
[15:17] to use him in a mighty way lord god in
[15:20] the simplicity of your word lord god we
[15:23] pray even now that we would have ears to
[15:25] hear and eyes to see
[15:27] give us a heart to receive your word for
[15:29] we ask and pray in jesus name
[15:32] we forget not our purpose for being here
[15:34] this morning lord god there may be one
[15:37] lord god that don't know you in the
[15:38] pardon of their sins we pray lord god
[15:41] through the foolishness of preaching

[16:19] amen god bless you we're gonna invite
[16:21] brother mike to come with their
[16:22] songwriting this morning amen
[16:45] good morning
[16:47] i'm going to be reading in psalm 15 this
[16:49] morning
[16:52] and
[16:53] i was just looking at that yesterday
[16:58] you know the verse the scripture begins
[17:00] lord who shall abide
[17:02] in thy tabernacle
[17:05] who shall dwell in thy holy hill
[17:08] you know i was thinking about that as i
[17:10] was reading it
[17:11] you know a tabernacle
[17:13] is a place of worship
[17:16] you know we tend to think i think of a
[17:18] tabernacle as a building
[17:21] or as a um as a physical space
[17:24] where people come together and hold
[17:26] worship services
[17:29] but that's not what david was looking
[17:31] for
[17:32] that's really not what god's looking for
[17:36] but it's usually what men will settle
[17:38] for
[17:40] you know and as long as we've got us a
[17:41] building
[17:43] you know meeting faithfully in that
[17:45] building and holding worship services
[17:47] whenever we can
[17:49] we're satisfying
[17:50] the vision
[17:53] you know if we're not careful we can
[17:54] also begin to measure our own
[17:56] spirituality
[17:58] or that of someone else's by attendance
[18:00] to worship services
[18:04] you know meeting in worship to hear the
[18:06] word of the lord and to strengthen one
[18:08] another that's just our good and
[18:09] faithful service
[18:11] but if we're not careful we can make it
[18:13] a tradition
[18:14] a religion
[18:16] a ceremony
[18:18] you know really like anyone else
[18:21] as long as
[18:22] attendance to mass is satisfactory we're
[18:24] good
[18:26] right but when david speaks of a
[18:29] tabernacle
[18:31] a place of worship
[18:33] he speaks of it as being a place where
[18:35] someone dwells
[18:38] lives
[18:40] abides
[18:42] not just three visits a week
[18:45] right
[18:47] you know psalm 27 verse 4 is a familiar
[18:50] scripture to us
[18:52] it says one thing have i desired of the
[18:55] lord
[18:56] that will i seek after
[18:58] that i may dwell
[19:01] in the house of the lord all the days of
[19:04] my life
[19:06] not in the future
[19:09] not in heaven
[19:10] but all the days of my life
[19:15] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[19:17] inquire in his temple
[19:20] for in the time of trouble
[19:23] how many could say we live in a troubled
[19:25] time
[19:28] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[19:31] in the secret of his tabernacle
[19:35] shall he hide me
[19:37] so the tabernacle
[19:38] is a secret place
[19:42] it's not a building with a sign on a
[19:45] four-lane road
[19:47] it's a place where god hides his people
[19:52] it's not a place you drive to
[19:55] it's a hidden place
[19:57] where if you dwell there you can find
[19:59] safety
[20:00] and stability
[20:02] in a troubled time
[20:05] you know we're all familiar with the
[20:06] story of
[20:09] jesus and the woman at the well
[20:11] in john 4.
[20:14] you know you know the story it's a woman
[20:15] who's living a hopeless life
[20:18] until jesus comes by her way
[20:22] i must needs go through samaria
[20:25] there's someone i have to meet
[20:28] you know and as he and the woman begin
[20:29] to talk you know she begins to realize
[20:31] that there's something different
[20:34] about this one
[20:37] she begins to recognize this is a time
[20:39] where maybe she can get some of her
[20:41] questions answered
[20:44] you know it's interesting that one of
[20:45] the questions that this sinful woman
[20:47] asks
[20:49] is something none of the other religious
[20:51] worshipers in her day asked
[20:54] she asked what's the right way to
[20:56] worship
[20:58] you can read that in john 4 20.
[21:02] she says our fathers worshipped in this
[21:04] mountain
[21:06] and ye jews
[21:08] say that a jerusalem
[21:10] is the place where men ought to worship
[21:12] everybody pointing to their building
[21:14] their place
[21:16] their surface
[21:17] their way of worship
[21:21] as being his tabernacle but notice how
[21:23] he responds
[21:24] in verse 21 jesus saith unto her woman
[21:27] believe me
[21:28] the hour is coming when ye shall neither
[21:31] in this mountain
[21:33] nor yet at jerusalem worship the father
[21:37] if go on to verse 23 it says but the
[21:39] hour cometh and now is
[21:43] when the true worshipers shall worship
[21:45] the father in spirit and in truth
[21:48] not in a building
[21:50] not in a worship service not at a
[21:52] specific time of day or day of week
[21:55] for the father seek us such
[21:59] to worship him
[22:01] so who are these people
[22:04] these true worshipers how does someone
[22:07] get to this tabernacle
[22:11] psalm 15 1 lord who shall abide in thy
[22:14] tabernacle
[22:16] who shall dwell in thy holy hill
[22:19] he that walketh uprightly
[22:23] and worketh righteousness
[22:25] speaketh the truth
[22:27] in his heart
[22:29] not just in his lips
[22:31] and the whole rest of psalm 15 as we
[22:34] read that right now
[22:36] describes who is abiding in this
[22:38] tabernacle
[22:41] you know what's interesting is there's
[22:42] no mention about
[22:44] their ability to
[22:46] speak about spiritual things
[22:50] or what they believe
[22:52] or their attendance to worship services
[22:57] or their observance of religious
[22:58] obligations or traditions
[23:02] all of those things can be produced in
[23:04] the flesh
[23:06] none of the things which men do mean
[23:09] anything if it does not produce what
[23:12] psalm 15 is talking about
[23:16] this is a description of someone who's
[23:18] walking in the sikh is there a dwelling
[23:20] in the secret place of worship
[23:22] a life
[23:24] abiding
[23:25] every day
[23:26] constantly
[23:28] in his tabernacle
[23:30] micah 6
[23:31] 7 it was a scripture that kind of came
[23:33] to my mind this weekend it says this
[23:35] will the lord be pleased with thousands
[23:38] of rams or with ten thousands of rivers
[23:40] of oil
[23:42] that's a lot of worship services
[23:45] shall i give my firstborn for my
[23:47] transgression
[23:49] the fruit of my body for the sin of my
[23:51] soul
[23:53] that's some pretty sincere religion
[23:54] there
[23:56] he hath showed thee
[23:58] oh man what is good
[24:00] and what doth the lord require of thee
[24:04] but to do justly
[24:06] and to love mercy
[24:07] and to walk humbly with thy god
[24:10] dwelling in the tabernacle
[24:13] so as we read psalm 15 this morning and
[24:15] david asked the question who shall abide
[24:18] in thy tabernacle remember god hasn't
[24:20] called a people to go to church
[24:23] he's called a people to be a church
[24:25] and those are entirely different things
[24:28] so let's read that together psalm 15
[24:31] chapter 1 or verse 1 lord who shall
[24:34] abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell
[24:37] in thy holy hill
[24:39] he that walketh uprightly and worketh
[24:42] righteousness and speaketh the truth in
[24:44] his heart
[24:45] he that backbiteth not with his tongue
[24:48] nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor
[24:50] taketh up a reproach against his
[24:52] neighbor in whose eyes a vile person is
[24:55] contempt but he honoreth them that fear
[24:58] the lord he that sweareth to his own
[25:01] heart and changeth not he that putteth
[25:04] not out his money to usury nor taketh
[25:07] reward against the innocent
[25:09] he that doeth these things shall never
[25:11] be moved
[25:22] and then god bless you have your seats
[25:25] let's sing this on i'm i'm looking for a
[25:28] city
[25:30] the one that made my hands
[25:32] amen
[25:33] i'm looking for a city
[25:39] i'm looking over jordan

[42:16] [Music]
[42:28] god bless you church
[42:35] today uh
[42:37] my my voice is going to be very cracky
[42:39] so
[42:40] i don't think i'll get the tune but
[42:42] i think uh i was cut by uh the meaning
[42:45] of the song
[42:47] uh it says that mighty uh almighty
[42:49] fortress is our god um and the reason
[42:52] why i was you know i was thinking about
[42:53] that was uh you know but abram said uh
[42:56] the mind is the greatest battle ever
[42:58] fought you know in your mind so you keep
[42:59] struggling you know back and forth
[43:02] and i haven't seen some traumatic
[43:04] experience um you know sometimes i wake
[43:06] up and um it's just gonna it's so weird
[43:09] because it's like oh today's gonna be
[43:11] the last day it was like where's that
[43:12] thought coming from um
[43:14] you know maybe just having some
[43:16] flashbacks
[43:17] and then um you know uh
[43:20] i have to go back and before i knew it
[43:22] you know i'll start hearing that voice
[43:24] telling me
[43:25] well i've saved you from this this this
[43:28] and that and that
[43:29] don't you know how powerful i am that i
[43:31] can do anything um in fact i was that
[43:34] telling myself about friends i can
[43:36] remember friends who tell me so how did
[43:38] you do it did you have some
[43:40] diabolic power or something i was like i
[43:43] i don't know but but i know of someone
[43:45] who was able to help me out and
[43:47] and so i would confess who god is to
[43:49] them
[43:51] and uh so this song came to my mind and
[43:53] my dad used to sing this song with his
[43:55] very deep voice i don't think i have
[43:57] that but i'll try
[44:02] almighty fortress he's a
[44:06] god abu work never failing
[44:14] i'll help her he
[44:16] meets the floor
[44:20] of mortar eels prevailing
[44:25] for still i hation for
[44:29] the seek to walk as wool
[44:34] is craft power great
[44:38] and harmed with cool elite
[44:42] on earth he's not he's
[44:47] [Music]
[44:49] indeed we
[44:51] now strand confide
[44:55] our striving would be losing
[45:02] we're not the right man on our side
[45:07] the man of god's own choosing
[45:13] don't ask who that may be
[45:17] christ jesus he'd easy
[45:22] lord sober jesus name

[55:20] as the father of our faith
[55:22] [Music]

[55:27] that you were able to perform
[55:30] that which you promised
[55:32] we all have needs father in our life
[55:36] seeking your will
[55:39] and we ask this morning that you
[55:41] stir our heart sin
[55:46] ever so united closer with your word and
[55:50] the understanding
[55:52] of what is transpiring in the hour that
[55:56] we are living
[55:58] father the words that
[56:00] were spoken
[56:03] by a prophetic messenger
[56:06] your servant
[56:08] william mary and branham father that
[56:11] you brought into this world to
[56:14] bring a message to a church
[56:18] to an elected lady
[56:21] and now that
[56:23] word that was spoken is manifesting in
[56:26] flesh
[56:29] father and it's coming to a maturity
[56:31] [Music]
[56:33] and father we're here this morning to
[56:36] [Music]
[56:38] listen and to study and to
[56:42] show ourselves proof father that
[56:45] that manifestation may be alive in each
[56:48] one of us
[56:50] we ask you to help us this morning our
[56:52] children are starting back to school
[56:55] we have
[56:56] jobs to go to things that
[56:59] we have to accomplish to live
[57:03] but lord we know that a new life awaits
[57:05] us
[57:07] and lord we'll tarry
[57:10] and look up
[57:11] until that day arrives
[57:13] we ask these things this morning
[57:16] in jesus precious and
[57:18] holy name we pray
[57:20] amen
[57:22] amen god bless you this morning if you
[57:24] have your bibles and
[57:28] will turn with me
[57:30] over to the
[57:32] first corinthians
[57:34] and in the 15th chapter of first
[57:36] corinthians i i guess probably most
[57:39] everybody knows by now that wednesday i
[57:42] got involved in an accident
[57:44] and
[57:46] i
[57:47] hate to say it but it was my fault
[57:50] and
[57:51] but you know god brings all things well
[57:55] you know both airbags went off and i got
[57:57] hit pretty hard
[57:58] or kind of a combination of me hitting
[58:01] and him hitting but he had a bigger
[58:04] vehicle then i he had a semi and i had a
[58:06] pickup truck
[58:08] and the semi truck won
[58:11] but uh
[58:12] i i kind of i knew i knew i had a
[58:15] concussion
[58:17] but what i didn't know is sometimes it
[58:19] takes two or three days for the symptoms
[58:22] to show up
[58:24] so the symptoms started showing up
[58:27] yesterday afternoon
[58:29] so
[58:31] i think i might be able to hold it
[58:32] together a little bit this morning
[58:35] but so i said well what do you do for a
[58:38] concussion and the first thing they said
[58:40] you do is you don't socialize
[58:43] and i thought well that ain't gonna work
[58:46] and uh and then
[58:48] so
[58:49] and then you know bright lights uh
[58:51] bother you and uh
[58:53] it's not like we don't have any light
[58:55] here
[58:57] so all these things but and then your
[58:59] cognitive
[59:01] abilities you know to recall
[59:03] and to put sentences together gets a
[59:06] little bit impaired so if i have a few
[59:08] little stumblings this morning aren't
[59:11] you glad we have a solid message that we
[59:14] can listen to that can fetus and take
[59:16] through so i want you to know it's the
[59:18] concussion it's not age
[59:21] that's my story and i'm sticking with it
[59:25] so
[59:26] let us read i i'm telling you these
[59:29] little scriptures here
[59:31] in corinthians
[59:33] i've read them all my life
[59:36] but i've never understood them like i've
[59:38] understood them since i've been
[59:40] listening to this message
[59:43] is the rising of the sun and uh
[59:47] this message has really stirred me
[59:50] and examined me and it's it's
[59:53] still working but let us read and we'll
[59:56] read from the
[59:57] 51st verse through
[1:00:03] the
[1:00:07] 54th verse
[1:00:11] it says behold i show you a mystery
[1:00:16] we shall not all sleep
[1:00:20] but we shall all be changed
[1:00:25] in a moment sorry let some of you find
[1:00:28] it
[1:00:29] first corinthians the 15th chapter again
[1:00:32] the 51st verse
[1:00:36] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[1:00:39] all sleep
[1:00:40] but we shall all be changed
[1:00:43] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:00:47] at the last trump
[1:00:49] for the trump
[1:00:50] shall sound
[1:00:52] and the dead
[1:00:54] shall be risen incorruptible
[1:00:57] and we shall be changed
[1:01:00] for this corruptable must put on
[1:01:03] incorruption
[1:01:04] and this mortal must put on immortality
[1:01:08] for when this corruptable shall have put
[1:01:12] on in corruption
[1:01:14] and this mortal shall have put on
[1:01:16] immortality then shall be brought to
[1:01:20] pass
[1:01:21] the saying
[1:01:22] that is
[1:01:23] written
[1:01:24] death is swallowed up
[1:01:27] in victory heavenly father bless your
[1:01:30] word amen god bless you may be seated
[1:01:35] as we know that we've been studying
[1:01:38] this great sermon
[1:01:41] the
[1:01:42] rising
[1:01:44] of the sun
[1:01:45] he's been explaining to us
[1:01:48] how that death is swallowed up in
[1:01:51] victory
[1:01:52] how that it's been
[1:01:54] swallowed up in the victory
[1:01:56] and the victory that was won
[1:01:59] and is being won right now
[1:02:02] as he's been separating us and calling
[1:02:05] us out
[1:02:06] of this world and so
[1:02:09] it's a a marvelous thing to
[1:02:12] think that you're in something that is
[1:02:16] corruptable
[1:02:18] and you know uh
[1:02:21] we talk a lot about corruption
[1:02:23] nowadays because the political world is
[1:02:26] corrupt
[1:02:28] uh
[1:02:29] it appears to me that
[1:02:32] science is corrupt
[1:02:35] you say well how is science corrupt well
[1:02:37] they think that they're developing
[1:02:40] something to fix something and yet
[1:02:42] they're causing another uh
[1:02:45] side effect if i could
[1:02:47] uh say it that way and so something that
[1:02:50] is corruptable means if if you're
[1:02:54] corruptable uh you might be honest but
[1:02:57] if you have a nature that can be
[1:02:59] corrupted
[1:03:00] something come it can can't come in and
[1:03:03] uh bribe you or or lead you astray or
[1:03:08] uh cause you to do things that you
[1:03:11] wouldn't normally do
[1:03:14] so that that's a nature that's
[1:03:16] corruptable
[1:03:18] and so we just aren't looking at it as
[1:03:22] uh
[1:03:23] uh the corruption of
[1:03:25] the flesh as when it goes into the grave
[1:03:29] you understand a lot of times when we
[1:03:31] talk about corruptable that's the way
[1:03:33] that
[1:03:33] we look at it we look at it that it's
[1:03:37] something that
[1:03:38] it just won't rot
[1:03:41] away
[1:03:42] but we're talking about a life that's
[1:03:44] going to come in us and keep us from
[1:03:48] being corruptible
[1:03:49] in other words satan can no longer
[1:03:52] corrupt us
[1:03:53] and the church
[1:03:57] world
[1:03:58] as we would call it formal and
[1:04:02] religion
[1:04:03] as we will hear our messenger uh
[1:04:08] describe
[1:04:09] as
[1:04:10] denominational fiction
[1:04:13] it had become corrupted
[1:04:16] in other words for different reasons
[1:04:19] they no longer stayed
[1:04:21] with the true
[1:04:23] resurrection message of easter
[1:04:27] they
[1:04:28] for money for popularity for crowds
[1:04:32] for
[1:04:33] many a number of reasons
[1:04:37] they left
[1:04:38] the true
[1:04:40] message
[1:04:42] of
[1:04:43] easter
[1:04:44] or of the resurrection
[1:04:47] the real message that the s-o-n brought
[1:04:51] to the world when it rose from the grave
[1:04:55] when he rose from the grave there was a
[1:04:57] message in it
[1:04:59] remember the seal was broken and the
[1:05:02] message was because i live
[1:05:06] you shall live also because i
[1:05:09] resurrected from the grave so shall you
[1:05:12] resurrect from the grave
[1:05:15] and we know that there's a rapture and
[1:05:19] or a translation the scripture calls it
[1:05:22] but
[1:05:23] even that translation
[1:05:25] is a resurrection from the grave of this
[1:05:29] body
[1:05:30] because no matter what age you're at you
[1:05:33] are years begin to pile up and finally
[1:05:37] this dust can no longer hang life
[1:05:40] and we drive down the roads and we find
[1:05:43] graveyards everywhere because that is
[1:05:46] the mark of sin
[1:05:48] every graveyard tells man that they're
[1:05:51] living in sin
[1:05:53] every graveyard tells man that they left
[1:05:56] eternal life every graveyard and and uh
[1:06:00] so it doesn't matter whether they spread
[1:06:03] your ashes or and those aren't the
[1:06:05] subject things that we're talking about
[1:06:08] but what we're talking about is a escape
[1:06:12] from corruption
[1:06:13] and that is a present tense
[1:06:18] okay something that god is doing us now
[1:06:21] that we can know
[1:06:23] that we possess
[1:06:25] eternal life and we can have the hope
[1:06:28] and the comfort that if they put this
[1:06:31] body it will rise again because i live
[1:06:35] and we know our scripture in romans 8
[1:06:37] that says simply it says if the same
[1:06:40] spirit
[1:06:41] that be in christ jesus dwell in you
[1:06:46] it shall quicken your
[1:06:49] mortal body
[1:06:51] by that same spirit
[1:06:55] and so that's what we're talking about
[1:06:57] is that that the the light that has come
[1:07:00] up
[1:07:01] that so that we know that if there has
[1:07:04] to be a light
[1:07:06] to bring a seed
[1:07:09] to life
[1:07:11] and god showed us that program
[1:07:15] and what his plan was
[1:07:17] in the very words that he spoke let
[1:07:20] there be light and we covered that as we
[1:07:23] listen
[1:07:24] and he talks about this light begin to
[1:07:26] shine so the s-u-n
[1:07:29] came up god said let there be light
[1:07:32] the sun became into existence
[1:07:36] i don't know how that transpired but it
[1:07:39] he said let there be light and there was
[1:07:41] light
[1:07:42] and that light shined on the waters and
[1:07:45] found the seed and brought the seed to
[1:07:49] life
[1:07:50] and every scene manifested he said now
[1:07:53] there had to be an s-o-n
[1:07:56] to shine to go forth and to find all
[1:08:00] the life
[1:08:02] and spiritual life and spiritual seed
[1:08:05] and bring them
[1:08:07] to life now we know that the church
[1:08:11] world went into darkness and this is
[1:08:14] what we've really got to come to grips
[1:08:17] with
[1:08:18] if and i just say this as honestly as i
[1:08:21] can
[1:08:22] why that there had to be this message
[1:08:26] because the church world and
[1:08:29] denominational world was no longer
[1:08:32] providing the light
[1:08:35] the s-o-n that would bring the spiritual
[1:08:39] seed that is in you to life
[1:08:44] we're not worried about politics we're
[1:08:46] not worried about these nations we're
[1:08:49] not worried about this world we need to
[1:08:53] understand one thing we've got to come
[1:08:56] to the
[1:08:57] knowledge and understanding and
[1:09:00] satisfaction
[1:09:02] and assurity
[1:09:03] that the seed that's in us has been
[1:09:07] brought to light
[1:09:09] and that we are new creatures in christ
[1:09:12] jesus and we have this life in us
[1:09:19] and it's time i mean i as i've been
[1:09:21] listening to this sermon
[1:09:24] i've actually uh
[1:09:26] i am in questioning
[1:09:30] my myself do i
[1:09:32] have this life it's if it's too late to
[1:09:37] to worry about my position or
[1:09:41] my popularity or
[1:09:43] anything uh
[1:09:45] of of that nature it's it's got to come
[1:09:48] down to where that is something
[1:09:51] genuine that i know that i've got
[1:09:54] and uh so
[1:09:56] we're going through this and we're
[1:09:58] taking our time in it because we want to
[1:10:00] understand what it is what it's here
[1:10:02] well this message if this is what he
[1:10:05] says
[1:10:06] it is
[1:10:08] the rising of the sun
[1:10:10] in other words in this dark lady ocean
[1:10:14] age that had completely gone to apostasy
[1:10:18] had put god on the outside of the church
[1:10:21] they're no longer preaching resurrection
[1:10:24] they're no longer preaching holiness
[1:10:26] they're no longer preaching the move of
[1:10:28] the holy spirit
[1:10:30] they're they're no longer
[1:10:34] preaching that that the power of god
[1:10:36] exists that there's a holiness and a
[1:10:39] standard to live by they've left all
[1:10:41] those things down and are preaching some
[1:10:44] fiction that someday jesus is going to
[1:10:47] come flying down out of the sky
[1:10:49] airplanes are going to fall out of the
[1:10:51] sky
[1:10:52] and we are going to uh we are just going
[1:10:56] to be taken up just based on our church
[1:10:59] association and brother mike i love what
[1:11:02] you brought this morning i thought that
[1:11:04] was so awesome
[1:11:06] i just wanted to come out and let you
[1:11:08] keep going
[1:11:10] and that's what he said he said god
[1:11:11] didn't call us to come to church he
[1:11:14] called us to be a church
[1:11:19] and so the the fiction it was great and
[1:11:23] men associated together intellectually
[1:11:26] they associated together in fellowship
[1:11:29] they associated together in doctrine
[1:11:32] but they were never possessors
[1:11:40] of the same spirit
[1:11:43] that he had
[1:11:47] now
[1:11:49] that's a statement
[1:11:52] to say do i have the same spirit that
[1:11:56] was in jesus christ in me because if i
[1:11:59] have it it'll do what it did for him
[1:12:04] now i believe it
[1:12:09] okay
[1:12:10] but
[1:12:11] i want to go beyond belief
[1:12:15] i want to go to possession
[1:12:18] and i
[1:12:19] uh this is david mcgeary speaking
[1:12:22] i don't believe you take possession of
[1:12:24] it all at once
[1:12:30] i believe it's
[1:12:31] brought to life
[1:12:34] because the church
[1:12:36] went into the ground and came up
[1:12:39] god is an evolutionist
[1:12:41] and i believe he's
[1:12:42] we
[1:12:44] are coming to a place
[1:12:46] where we're hungering
[1:12:48] we're thirsting we're crying out
[1:12:51] we want to have this
[1:12:53] in our life
[1:12:54] and he's calling us from all walks of
[1:12:57] life all different places all different
[1:12:59] jobs all different churches all
[1:13:01] different positions and he's bringing us
[1:13:04] into this light
[1:13:06] so we can be saturated you've got to be
[1:13:09] saturated in the light you've got to sit
[1:13:11] in that light just like sitting out in
[1:13:14] the sun until it bakes you
[1:13:18] you've got to really get into it
[1:13:21] in depth so we're going to start this
[1:13:24] morning where we left off
[1:13:26] and
[1:13:27] just to tell you
[1:13:29] you know
[1:13:30] these are from where we left off
[1:13:34] it was is right here and
[1:13:37] this is
[1:13:38] almost every page
[1:13:40] you know in these next few
[1:13:43] pages is just loaded with
[1:13:47] things that are brought to life
[1:13:50] and
[1:13:51] so as we listen to this
[1:13:55] brother the prophet of god
[1:13:57] there's a
[1:13:58] very um
[1:14:01] i don't i don't want to use the word
[1:14:02] subtle because i've discovered that
[1:14:04] there's nothing that the prophet of god
[1:14:06] says that's subtle
[1:14:08] once it's revealed it's like a massive
[1:14:11] headlight
[1:14:13] but he talks quite a bit in here
[1:14:16] uh maybe a terminology could i use his
[1:14:19] underline about the witnessing of the
[1:14:22] church
[1:14:24] and the display of this life
[1:14:27] we'd i hope that you can pick up on some
[1:14:30] of those things as he also talks to us
[1:14:34] in this little section
[1:14:36] about the sharing
[1:14:38] of this life so we're going to listen i
[1:14:41] think it's about 19 minutes or 20
[1:14:44] minutes this morning
[1:14:46] and then we're going to go back through
[1:14:48] so if if you have uh
[1:14:50] i i believe nowadays you can have little
[1:14:54] i don't know if they're laptops or uh
[1:14:57] phones and all those things
[1:15:00] we are listening and
[1:15:02] going to read from the message
[1:15:05] it is the rising of the
[1:15:08] sun and this morning we left off at
[1:15:12] paragraph
[1:15:13] 43
[1:15:15] before and now we're going to pick up
[1:15:18] on paragraph 44.
[1:15:20] last sunday evening we talked about uh
[1:15:25] the
[1:15:26] going this our seed being in the earth
[1:15:30] and uh but uh and so we're just gonna
[1:15:33] pick up from right here we're gonna
[1:15:35] listen from paragraph 44
[1:15:38] to the
[1:15:39] end of
[1:15:42] paragraph
[1:15:43] 80
[1:15:45] and then that's a good breaking point
[1:15:47] because the prophet of god begins to
[1:15:49] move into the sheaf offering and some
[1:15:51] other great things so let's just sit
[1:15:53] back this morning
[1:15:55] let's
[1:15:56] put your
[1:15:57] spirit in the mind of listening if you
[1:16:00] have a
[1:16:01] listening aid
[1:16:03] like maybe if you don't speak english
[1:16:05] and you can find this message in french
[1:16:08] or in spanish and you can read along
[1:16:12] we'll have it on the board
[1:16:15] and just pay attention for this 20
[1:16:17] minutes and let's see the the food
[1:16:22] that's in here
[1:16:24] you know
[1:16:26] if i could just use a real carnal type
[1:16:28] it's like going down one of those great
[1:16:30] big smorgasbords you know what i mean
[1:16:33] there's so many plates up there and if
[1:16:35] you just run down and make one pass
[1:16:38] you know you only get a few items well
[1:16:41] we're going to just go down and and
[1:16:44] see if we can take maybe some items that
[1:16:47] we've never caught before
[1:16:49] and feed on it but remember this morning
[1:16:52] every bit of what we're here for is
[1:16:54] about the lord jesus
[1:16:57] okay and it's not just jesus the man
[1:17:02] that walked 2000 years ago
[1:17:04] it's jesus the word
[1:17:08] that is eternal
[1:17:10] there's not three gods
[1:17:13] there's only one
[1:17:14] god
[1:17:16] and that god was manifested
[1:17:19] and became flesh in the man called jesus
[1:17:23] christ who is the only mediator between
[1:17:27] us and god
[1:17:28] but the same spirit that was in jesus
[1:17:31] was the spirit of the father the spirit
[1:17:34] of god that spirit was manifested in
[1:17:37] flesh and then he set that spirit back
[1:17:41] he sent the spirit back upon
[1:17:44] us
[1:17:45] that we could be possessors
[1:17:48] of that same spirit
[1:17:50] that that same spirit would do in us
[1:17:54] what it did in the lord jesus so god
[1:17:57] bless you this morning i hope the food
[1:18:00] of god's word
[1:18:01] nourishes your soul this morning again
[1:18:04] keep me in prayer
[1:18:06] brother billy is going to take the
[1:18:08] evening service i'll be in missouri and
[1:18:10] next weekend
[1:18:12] and
[1:18:13] so
[1:18:14] but let's just take a few moments this
[1:18:16] morning and enjoy god's word
[1:18:19] i don't know what time it is now but
[1:18:23] we'll just have a few moments of
[1:18:25] fellowship amen
[1:18:26] is everybody okay and loving the lord
[1:18:30] love this message it's wonderful god
[1:18:32] bless you
[1:18:37] now today we have
[1:18:39] a tuberculosis easter seal
[1:18:43] people send a message one to the other
[1:18:46] and to support this great
[1:18:51] fun or drive for the doctors and medical
[1:18:55] sciences to work upon
[1:18:58] something to retire or to help the
[1:19:01] tuberculosis they are sealed what we
[1:19:04] call an easter seal
[1:19:06] when we send message one to another
[1:19:09] but when we receive the message
[1:19:12] that seal is broken
[1:19:14] because the seal is what's got a message
[1:19:17] bound on the inside
[1:19:19] and now
[1:19:21] the true easter seal
[1:19:23] on this sunrise was broken
[1:19:27] and the secret of life after death was
[1:19:30] revealed
[1:19:31] before that time
[1:19:34] we didn't know the world uh
[1:19:39] grouped in darkness
[1:19:41] groped around
[1:19:43] man
[1:19:44] suspicion
[1:19:45] theories was among man's heart tradition
[1:19:49] made up
[1:19:50] man worshiped idols they worshipped the
[1:19:52] sun they worshipped all kinds of gods
[1:19:56] and all kinds of people that made claims
[1:19:57] they all went into the grave and they
[1:19:59] stayed in the grave
[1:20:02] but the real seal
[1:20:04] has been broken
[1:20:06] and one who once lived as we live
[1:20:09] died as we will die
[1:20:11] was risen from the dead
[1:20:14] what a morning
[1:20:16] never one like it in all the history of
[1:20:19] the world the secret was made known that
[1:20:22] he was both resurrection and alive
[1:20:27] and he said when he come forth on that
[1:20:29] morning because i live you live also
[1:20:34] not only was he the beneficiary of the
[1:20:37] resurrection but all those
[1:20:41] seed that was resting in god's great
[1:20:44] province was a benefactor of that
[1:20:47] resurrection to life because he said
[1:20:49] because i live amen ye shall live also
[1:20:57] that was the breaking of the seal
[1:20:59] because he was brought up so will
[1:21:02] everyone that's in christ be brought up
[1:21:06] with him
[1:21:08] at this glorious sunrise
[1:21:10] god had proven or vindicated his word
[1:21:14] all the glooms and doubt that have
[1:21:17] moved in people's minds
[1:21:19] was taken away
[1:21:21] because here was he who once lived eat
[1:21:24] drinks and fellowship with mankind that
[1:21:28] said i have power to lay my life down i
[1:21:31] have power to raise it up again
[1:21:34] and now not only had he made the
[1:21:36] statement but he proved it to be the
[1:21:39] truth
[1:21:41] oh what a glorious thing that is i'm
[1:21:45] sure this morning
[1:21:47] that even we who believe it cannot
[1:21:50] comprehend what a great thing that was
[1:21:55] because
[1:21:56] he raised from the dead we also have
[1:22:01] already raised from the dead
[1:22:04] while we were in him
[1:22:07] notice
[1:22:08] now as the gloom covered the earth and
[1:22:12] the seeds could not live without the s-u
[1:22:15] in their eyes
[1:22:16] and gloom had covered the earth and now
[1:22:19] the s-o-n was risen and all gloom was
[1:22:23] vanished by this light as it spread
[1:22:25] across of the nations to the people that
[1:22:28] he is not here but he has risen
[1:22:32] what uh what a statement
[1:22:34] he had proved his word
[1:22:36] he had proved it be to be true
[1:22:40] for he had now
[1:22:41] conquered
[1:22:43] death hell in the grave
[1:22:45] the trinity of the devil
[1:22:48] this
[1:22:49] hell and the grave
[1:22:51] or satan is the author of death
[1:22:54] he is the possessor of hell
[1:22:58] and also the great
[1:23:00] and that was the trinity
[1:23:03] of satan being caused by one
[1:23:06] thing that was death death you go up the
[1:23:09] grave and being a sinner you go to hell
[1:23:11] all the very one thing the trinity of
[1:23:14] satan which was death
[1:23:17] that had helped man in captivity all
[1:23:20] these years but now
[1:23:22] the true trinity of god
[1:23:26] being one manifested in christ who was
[1:23:29] life
[1:23:30] and it broke the seals and conquered the
[1:23:32] enemy and rose up the one true and
[1:23:35] living god
[1:23:38] i am he that was dead and i'm alive
[1:23:42] forevermore has a jesus death in hell
[1:23:48] in one
[1:23:49] made man and dwelt among us and
[1:23:51] conquered every enemy
[1:23:54] and it proved
[1:23:56] that the trinity of satan was conquered
[1:23:58] and if the trinity of god was made known
[1:24:01] because only god alone had power to
[1:24:04] bring life back again
[1:24:06] he was that emmanuel
[1:24:09] god
[1:24:11] had been manifested in the flesh
[1:24:14] no wonder he could claim there matthew
[1:24:17] 27 chapter all powers in heaven earth is
[1:24:21] given into my hand
[1:24:23] i send you to be my witnesses to all the
[1:24:25] world
[1:24:26] he had conquered both
[1:24:28] death hell and the grave
[1:24:30] not only did he do that and caught out
[1:24:33] triumph
[1:24:36] with all the power in the heavens and
[1:24:38] earth all that was the father all that
[1:24:40] was the holy ghost and all that there
[1:24:42] ever was was in him
[1:24:44] all powers in heaven and earth is given
[1:24:47] unto me
[1:24:49] everything else is powerless
[1:24:52] he had conquered it
[1:24:55] now
[1:24:56] and
[1:24:57] then not only that
[1:24:58] he sent word to his disciples just
[1:25:01] believing fear not
[1:25:04] for i am he
[1:25:06] that was dead
[1:25:08] and is alive again forevermore
[1:25:12] have the keys
[1:25:14] to stand in hell
[1:25:16] i've already conquered it don't fear
[1:25:19] anymore for every
[1:25:21] for our same predestinated seat of god
[1:25:25] shall come to life when that light
[1:25:27] spreads across the earth of the glorious
[1:25:29] gospel in every age it'll bring forth
[1:25:31] the crops that god are dangerous to do
[1:25:35] he is raised from the dead
[1:25:39] oh what a wonderful thing that is
[1:25:43] i am alive or quickened the word means
[1:25:48] the word quicken the greek word means
[1:25:50] that something that's made alive after
[1:25:52] death like the the seed that goes into
[1:25:55] the earth
[1:25:56] it has to die every bit of the seed
[1:26:00] it has to rock every bit of the seed
[1:26:04] and every bit of the life that was in
[1:26:07] the seat has to come forth again
[1:26:12] he was quickened
[1:26:14] not only that
[1:26:16] and will send
[1:26:18] the same life that quickened me
[1:26:20] the power that brought me from the grave
[1:26:24] i will send it upon you
[1:26:27] to quicken you
[1:26:29] that where i am
[1:26:30] there ye will be also
[1:26:34] in luke 24 chapter 49 first he said
[1:26:38] behold i send the promise of the father
[1:26:40] upon you
[1:26:42] but tarry are weighty
[1:26:44] in the city of jerusalem
[1:26:47] until you be endued with power from ohio
[1:26:52] to show that not only did he draw all
[1:26:55] the benefits out of it but he shared
[1:26:58] those benefits
[1:27:00] he come to redeem or to bring to life
[1:27:04] those predestinated seed that god came
[1:27:07] before the foundation of the world and
[1:27:10] put their names in the book of life and
[1:27:13] here they are on the earth without a
[1:27:14] hope
[1:27:15] he came not only to be the blessing but
[1:27:19] to share the blessings
[1:27:21] with every predestinated seed
[1:27:24] now
[1:27:25] if the seed wasn't on the earth it could
[1:27:27] not live
[1:27:28] it had to be on the earth and also
[1:27:30] traumatized
[1:27:32] no matter how long it's kept in darkness
[1:27:34] it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines
[1:27:37] upon it
[1:27:38] notice
[1:27:40] now
[1:27:40] he come to share it with us
[1:27:43] no wonder the gospel is good news
[1:27:46] the very word gospel means the good news
[1:27:50] the good news was
[1:27:52] if a man died
[1:27:54] for our sake
[1:27:56] that's good news
[1:27:57] if christ was born that's good news but
[1:28:01] never a news
[1:28:03] never was there news
[1:28:05] like this news
[1:28:07] that he who made the promise has
[1:28:10] confirmed the promise
[1:28:13] and he's alive forevermore
[1:28:15] and had the keys to both death and hell
[1:28:19] in his hands
[1:28:20] all the gloom was shook away
[1:28:23] there was no more gloom to be seen for
[1:28:25] the sun was up from the grave
[1:28:29] there was no
[1:28:30] oh he will come or he may come he had
[1:28:33] already come
[1:28:35] the gospel good news
[1:28:37] notice the very message of the gospel
[1:28:40] itself is to prove
[1:28:44] to the people
[1:28:45] that he is risen
[1:28:48] go tell my disciples
[1:28:52] that i am risen from the
[1:28:54] dead meet with them to confirm this to
[1:28:58] them
[1:29:01] oh god
[1:29:02] how in this last days there shall be
[1:29:06] light again across here
[1:29:09] i'll prove to my disciples don't tell
[1:29:12] them that i am not dead and i'm not a
[1:29:15] tradition but i am a living christ
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:21] i'll meet them
[1:29:22] take this message to my
[1:29:25] disciples
[1:29:27] that i'm risen from the dead
[1:29:29] the gospel good news you say is that
[1:29:31] right hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[1:29:34] yesterday today and forever
[1:29:37] we as beneficiaries
[1:29:39] are to prove his life
[1:29:41] is
[1:29:42] in us now
[1:29:44] the beneficiaries of
[1:29:46] this life the life he never was a life
[1:29:49] lived like it
[1:29:50] he was the son of god
[1:29:53] and he died
[1:29:55] and that shut it out
[1:29:57] but when he raised again from the dead
[1:30:00] on easter morning
[1:30:02] then
[1:30:03] we as his servants are commissioned by
[1:30:06] him to go into all the world
[1:30:10] and to bring this good news
[1:30:13] to every person
[1:30:16] that he is a living
[1:30:19] and how can we do it by
[1:30:21] word only
[1:30:23] or it is written the gospel can not by
[1:30:26] word only but through the power and the
[1:30:28] manifestation of the holy spirit to
[1:30:32] prove that he is alive
[1:30:36] now if there is another gospel that paul
[1:30:39] spoke to one of the groups i am so
[1:30:42] surprised that you turn to another
[1:30:44] gospel which is a leather
[1:30:47] a make-believe gospel
[1:30:50] to a denominational
[1:30:52] fiction
[1:30:54] turning from
[1:30:56] that good news
[1:30:59] and because
[1:31:00] i live
[1:31:02] ye live also
[1:31:04] and i live in you
[1:31:08] and the works that i do john 14 12
[1:31:11] the works that i do will identify
[1:31:15] myself in you
[1:31:18] what a message
[1:31:20] no wonder we've had a dark world of
[1:31:23] theology
[1:31:25] but in the evening time there shall come
[1:31:27] light again
[1:31:29] there will be a resurrection
[1:31:32] in the evening time
[1:31:34] it shall be like
[1:31:37] at the evening time
[1:31:38] now
[1:31:40] the very
[1:31:41] essence of the message that was sent
[1:31:45] that he is risen
[1:31:48] from the days
[1:31:50] we his beneficiary
[1:31:52] we who share the resurrection with him
[1:31:55] draw benefits from this by proving to
[1:31:59] the world that he is alive we cannot do
[1:32:02] it by word only we cannot do it for some
[1:32:05] traditional man we only reflect exactly
[1:32:08] what we're pointing to
[1:32:10] i'm afraid today that too many of us are
[1:32:13] not getting people to christ
[1:32:16] we're getting them to a church to a
[1:32:17] theory
[1:32:19] but we must get them to christ he is the
[1:32:22] only one and the only one that has life
[1:32:26] he that has a son has life
[1:32:29] and if the life of a man is dead
[1:32:33] be projected in you
[1:32:35] you will live the same life he is
[1:32:38] if the blood
[1:32:40] of a man
[1:32:41] was a certain type
[1:32:43] you took the blood from one man and
[1:32:45] changed the blood of one man into
[1:32:47] another he'd absolutely be that typed
[1:32:49] blood
[1:32:51] and if your spirit
[1:32:53] that's in you is reconciled
[1:32:56] and you are anointed with the life that
[1:32:59] was in christ is upon you
[1:33:01] romans 8 11 says
[1:33:04] if the spirit that raised christ from
[1:33:07] the dead
[1:33:08] dwells in you it will also quicken your
[1:33:11] mortal body
[1:33:14] that same life
[1:33:16] then paying powers
[1:33:18] from
[1:33:19] beneficiaries
[1:33:21] that he had here on earth from god he
[1:33:24] redeemed you
[1:33:26] a seed that was for known by god whose
[1:33:30] names was put on the lamb's book of life
[1:33:31] before the foundation of the world and
[1:33:34] that gospel light of the resurrection
[1:33:36] the confirmation of the words
[1:33:39] how do we know he was a crisis
[1:33:41] because he proves what he talks about
[1:33:44] todd i know the message of the hour
[1:33:47] god proves what he promised that he
[1:33:49] talks about
[1:33:53] that is the identification that we are
[1:33:56] of beneficiaries with him in the
[1:33:57] resurrection
[1:33:59] he proves what he's talked about
[1:34:02] what he promised to do in christ he
[1:34:04] proved on the resurrection
[1:34:06] what he promised to do in the days of
[1:34:08] moses he proved it
[1:34:10] what he promised in the days of enoch he
[1:34:12] proved it
[1:34:13] in all the days of the apostles he
[1:34:16] proved it
[1:34:17] now i understand he proves what he said
[1:34:20] because they are a part of that seed
[1:34:24] that was represented on the book of life
[1:34:26] that he came to redeem back to god again
[1:34:32] what a message
[1:34:34] by easter morning not only did he raise
[1:34:38] but his beneficiaries raised with him
[1:34:43] they were in crime at his crucifixion
[1:34:46] they were ending at his resurrection
[1:34:48] we are of his beneficiaries
[1:34:50] quicken after being dead in darkness in
[1:34:53] a darkened world of unbelief
[1:34:56] or churches and denominations and so
[1:34:58] forth have drawn us out and there's
[1:35:00] something in us calling old we want god
[1:35:02] we're hundred and thirsty for god we
[1:35:04] join the methodist baptist pentecostal
[1:35:07] presbyterians what more still there was
[1:35:09] something wrong
[1:35:11] we just couldn't find it yet
[1:35:13] and all others couldn't while we was
[1:35:15] groping in darkness a great resurrection
[1:35:19] came to us
[1:35:21] in the manifestation of the promised
[1:35:23] word of god like he was the
[1:35:25] manifestation of the promised word of
[1:35:28] god
[1:35:29] i will not leave his soul in hell
[1:35:32] neither will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:35:34] corruption
[1:35:35] amen he manifested in every word of god
[1:35:38] that was promised to him he proved it
[1:35:40] when he raised on the easter morning
[1:35:44] ah
[1:35:45] them who were once groping in darkness
[1:35:48] and wandering around if they should wash
[1:35:50] feet on this day or if they should keep
[1:35:52] a certain day or do a certain set of
[1:35:54] rules all those things passed away
[1:35:57] for that was a glorious resurrection
[1:36:00] that defied every man-made thing that
[1:36:03] man had ever done
[1:36:04] every man-made reason
[1:36:07] there had never been to that time a man
[1:36:08] that could lay his life down and pick it
[1:36:10] up again
[1:36:11] he defied that scientific proof they had
[1:36:14] by raising again
[1:36:16] when they say that jesus christ isn't
[1:36:19] deceit yesterday forever that his power
[1:36:21] isn't the same that his gospel isn't the
[1:36:23] same when the bible says it's the same
[1:36:26] god defined our denomination number
[1:36:29] creed and he moved forward with his holy
[1:36:31] spirit as he promised has proved it to
[1:36:34] us
[1:36:34] that he is
[1:36:36] alive we are the benefactors
[1:36:40] of his resurrection
[1:36:42] quickens after being dead in the world
[1:36:45] and sin and trespasses he is quickened
[1:36:48] us together with him
[1:36:50] raised with him now sitting in heavenly
[1:36:52] places in christ jesus
[1:36:55] his brain is spirit brings his same life
[1:36:59] again on the earth
[1:37:01] if the spirit of god
[1:37:03] that raised up christ the body
[1:37:05] the anointed bloody if the spirit of god
[1:37:08] anointed that body
[1:37:10] in such a way
[1:37:11] that when that seed fell into the earth
[1:37:14] he just wouldn't let him rest there
[1:37:16] no no
[1:37:17] he quickened him and raised him up
[1:37:21] that same spirit
[1:37:23] by the same works by the same power by
[1:37:26] the same signs being you
[1:37:28] he'll also raise you up
[1:37:37] that was gospel meat right there wasn't
[1:37:39] it
[1:37:40] amen amen let's just take a couple
[1:37:43] moments and
[1:37:44] and uh just
[1:37:46] walk back through this a little bit and
[1:37:51] emphasize some points
[1:37:57] that you know it kind of might be a
[1:37:59] blessing
[1:38:01] to us and
[1:38:03] um
[1:38:04] you know
[1:38:06] when you really like something and
[1:38:07] you're starting to feed on it you notice
[1:38:10] you'll slow down
[1:38:12] your bites and you'll
[1:38:14] chew it a little more you know and just
[1:38:18] did it
[1:38:19] spooned it in to move on you know and uh
[1:38:23] i was at a lovely housewarming the other
[1:38:26] day and
[1:38:27] they had some
[1:38:31] like side of a salad
[1:38:33] like a cabbage salad with raisins you
[1:38:36] know
[1:38:36] so
[1:38:38] i asked if i could take some home
[1:38:41] because
[1:38:42] i didn't want to just eat it that one
[1:38:44] time i wanted to feed on it again
[1:38:46] well they gave me a whole tray of it so
[1:38:49] i'm just feasting away and so
[1:38:52] you say well it's the same thing but
[1:38:53] it's so good you just keep eating it you
[1:38:56] know
[1:38:56] so let's just take a moment and
[1:38:59] i i thought that uh
[1:39:02] just um
[1:39:03] you know we're only 11 pages into the
[1:39:05] book
[1:39:07] so we know that uh
[1:39:10] that but as we noticed in the first few
[1:39:12] paragraphs 45 he said that man never
[1:39:16] knew
[1:39:18] really the secret
[1:39:20] of life after death
[1:39:22] you you understand so you say well
[1:39:25] there's been people that appeared in the
[1:39:27] bible
[1:39:28] uh they they did appear
[1:39:30] but
[1:39:31] the only record you had of that
[1:39:34] was the person that gave the record
[1:39:37] and
[1:39:38] he went into the grave
[1:39:41] and
[1:39:42] then
[1:39:43] that record had no other voice
[1:39:46] or no other witness
[1:39:48] because he was his own witness
[1:39:51] am i making sense to you so if i told
[1:39:54] you i saw a flying saucer the only thing
[1:39:58] the belief that you have in that flying
[1:40:00] saucer would have to have come from me
[1:40:04] and then if i died there was no record
[1:40:07] of that being existent so my testimony
[1:40:11] died with me
[1:40:12] so that allowed man always to have a
[1:40:15] question about life
[1:40:18] after death
[1:40:20] but when he rose from the dead
[1:40:24] that answered the question forevermore
[1:40:28] that i am i am he that was dead i was he
[1:40:32] that is the dead and alive forevermore
[1:40:36] so
[1:40:37] when he rose from the dead it just
[1:40:40] wasn't become a historical fact
[1:40:43] that he rose from the dead but now he's
[1:40:47] alive
[1:40:49] doing the same things that he did when
[1:40:52] he was on earth but now he's not doing
[1:40:55] him from earth he's doing them from his
[1:40:59] resurrected position
[1:41:02] so we know he's still alive because we
[1:41:05] see the works of his resurrection
[1:41:08] working and and being performed so
[1:41:12] he put a
[1:41:14] end to the question is there life after
[1:41:17] death for this body and so we saw a body
[1:41:21] liken our body
[1:41:23] that ate with us
[1:41:25] drank with us died the way we die come
[1:41:28] up
[1:41:29] and prove from where that he is
[1:41:34] from where he resurrected to
[1:41:36] to that he's still alive
[1:41:39] doing the same things so now the
[1:41:42] questions answer and we can look and say
[1:41:45] we know he's there in that place
[1:41:48] that's the place that we're going i
[1:41:51] don't want to resurrect back to this
[1:41:53] place
[1:41:57] you know what i mean praise god for a
[1:42:00] new heavens
[1:42:01] and a new earth a new place to go to but
[1:42:05] you understand the proof of the
[1:42:07] resurrection quest the works that i do
[1:42:11] shall you do also
[1:42:13] the church world put an end to that
[1:42:17] so there was no longer any proof of the
[1:42:20] resurrection there was just a hope so
[1:42:24] oh i hope there's a heaven i hope
[1:42:27] there's life i hope i make it i hope
[1:42:30] i've done enough good works but what
[1:42:32] he's trying to let us know is that you
[1:42:36] can have that question answered in your
[1:42:40] life forever because i will give to you
[1:42:46] the same spirit that quickened me
[1:42:51] put an end to the question
[1:42:54] so let's just go back to this a little
[1:42:56] bit because he said that was the great
[1:42:59] uh a seal
[1:43:01] that he said that was broken they broke
[1:43:03] the seal
[1:43:05] of the question of life after death
[1:43:08] does anybody have any question
[1:43:14] that this is not your existence
[1:43:19] you don't die
[1:43:21] this is not the body you're meant to
[1:43:23] live in there's more to your life than
[1:43:27] this
[1:43:27] 50 60 70 80 years whatever god gives you
[1:43:32] we're not living for here this is
[1:43:35] satan's kingdom and he's trying to get
[1:43:38] you to build it and when you die he's
[1:43:41] done with you
[1:43:43] he throws you
[1:43:45] into hell
[1:43:47] because that's his possession
[1:43:52] so he kills you
[1:43:53] with death and he throws you
[1:43:56] into hell
[1:44:01] boy
[1:44:02] sounds like somebody i want to work for
[1:44:06] wouldn't you rather work for somebody
[1:44:08] that's going to give you eternal life
[1:44:11] that when this world's over and all
[1:44:14] their science corrupts it and burns it
[1:44:16] and infects it and and starves it and
[1:44:20] and and it's ruined that you know that
[1:44:24] you've got another land another life
[1:44:27] another joy another peace that this it
[1:44:30] ain't over
[1:44:35] i don't want to end up a statue
[1:44:40] oh
[1:44:41] here's a monument
[1:44:42] to george washington well where's george
[1:44:45] well you see that river he threw a
[1:44:47] dollar over the river he chopped down a
[1:44:50] cherry tree
[1:44:53] what good does that do
[1:44:55] me
[1:44:58] what good does it do
[1:45:03] you've got to we by god's grace reveal
[1:45:07] to us the reality
[1:45:10] of life after death
[1:45:12] that's what jesus brought that was the
[1:45:15] message that was the seal hey everybody
[1:45:19] there's life after death this is not
[1:45:23] what you're seeing
[1:45:25] it's denominational fiction
[1:45:30] there really is a heaven
[1:45:32] there really is another kingdom
[1:45:35] look let me tell you something if you
[1:45:37] look at this mess
[1:45:39] and think that our great god created
[1:45:42] this then there's something wrong with
[1:45:45] your understanding of god
[1:45:48] look into those skies look at the sun
[1:45:51] look at nature the invisible things of
[1:45:54] god are clearly seen in the creation
[1:45:58] around us
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:01] not man-made science brick and mortar
[1:46:05] which is a perversion of them taking
[1:46:08] what god's made and turning it into
[1:46:10] something else that they made and it
[1:46:14] never lasts
[1:46:19] i've walked in europe i've walked places
[1:46:22] i walked through jerusalem and saw those
[1:46:24] great roman cities and those great ruins
[1:46:27] and and the archaeological digs
[1:46:30] they're digging 20 and 30 feet in the
[1:46:33] ground and finding things that used to
[1:46:36] be on the surface which shows you all
[1:46:39] civilization
[1:46:40] goes to the grave
[1:46:48] buried
[1:46:52] all the ships that used to sail the seas
[1:46:55] are underneath it
[1:46:57] i don't want to
[1:46:59] go
[1:47:00] with this life
[1:47:03] this life goes to the grave i don't want
[1:47:06] this life my life will not carry me over
[1:47:12] it takes divine life
[1:47:15] and that divine life's a gift of god
[1:47:19] so as we read there that's the seal
[1:47:22] that's what we're talking about that's
[1:47:24] what the rising of the sun told us
[1:47:26] there's life after death
[1:47:29] don't get hung up on this life
[1:47:32] and then he makes this statement
[1:47:33] paragraph 49 he says i'm sure this
[1:47:36] morning that
[1:47:37] even we
[1:47:39] who believe it cannot comprehend what a
[1:47:43] great thing that was
[1:47:46] lord
[1:47:47] increase my
[1:47:48] understanding
[1:47:50] make it shine brighter
[1:47:52] make me understand
[1:47:57] what a great thing it is
[1:48:00] that you shared with me
[1:48:03] there's life
[1:48:05] after death
[1:48:08] and as we begin to
[1:48:11] go down and and look at this
[1:48:15] these great things
[1:48:17] he says in in
[1:48:19] 51 he's talking about
[1:48:22] the trinity of the devil
[1:48:24] death hell
[1:48:26] and the grave
[1:48:28] and he he says and that's the trinity of
[1:48:31] satan being caused by one thing that was
[1:48:35] death
[1:48:36] death you go to the grave
[1:48:38] and being a sinner you go to hell
[1:48:43] that's the trinity of satan
[1:48:45] in other words
[1:48:46] this is what satan has to offer you
[1:48:50] you die
[1:48:53] i bury you
[1:48:55] and
[1:48:56] you over there go to hell
[1:49:02] that's what satan has to offer
[1:49:07] you ever hear the expression you know
[1:49:08] what you get if you work your fingers to
[1:49:10] the bone
[1:49:12] bony fingers
[1:49:17] how many times have i got on this and
[1:49:19] lifted something and put all my back
[1:49:21] into it and everything and 15 years
[1:49:23] later my back reminds me of the time
[1:49:26] that i overworked
[1:49:27] because i was some sort of muscle man
[1:49:30] and i got the job done for who
[1:49:36] i've worked 45 hour weeks for guys i
[1:49:39] worked that and when work got slow
[1:49:40] goodbye
[1:49:44] i'm done with you
[1:49:46] do you understand
[1:49:48] when you're no longer worthy for satan
[1:49:51] to use you he's done with you
[1:49:55] do you understand that's the trinity of
[1:49:57] satan you die
[1:50:00] you go to the grave
[1:50:02] you go to hell
[1:50:05] isn't that wonderful
[1:50:08] oh i am going to live for that
[1:50:12] please get me a career please get me
[1:50:15] something where i can work 60 70 hours a
[1:50:18] week and drive a car for a short
[1:50:22] season can they come and take your
[1:50:25] license away because you can't read the
[1:50:27] signs anymore
[1:50:30] or like somebody somebody was talking
[1:50:33] the other day they said you know brother
[1:50:35] randy just talked to the church and
[1:50:37] mention everybody
[1:50:38] lusting after the pastor's truck well so
[1:50:41] much for my truck
[1:50:48] it's the trinity of satan
[1:50:52] you know a trying court's hard to break
[1:50:58] but and so
[1:50:59] that's what he says he says and that
[1:51:03] held man in captivity
[1:51:06] all these years
[1:51:08] you understand
[1:51:09] if you don't have this life you are
[1:51:13] captive
[1:51:15] to the trinity of satan
[1:51:17] in other words there's no way to break
[1:51:19] that cycle of living
[1:51:22] dying
[1:51:24] the grave
[1:51:25] and hell
[1:51:27] he had every man captive
[1:51:30] until
[1:51:32] this day
[1:51:34] and that was broken
[1:51:37] and then he says now in 53 no wonder he
[1:51:40] could claim there in matthew 27th
[1:51:43] chapter all power in heaven and earth is
[1:51:47] given un to my hand i send you to be my
[1:51:53] witness to all the world
[1:51:56] now
[1:51:57] i didn't want to miss that because
[1:51:59] there's a few more statements we're
[1:52:01] going to make here because he's telling
[1:52:03] us something
[1:52:04] he said i send you to all the world so
[1:52:07] if you believe that
[1:52:10] and it's been revealed to you
[1:52:14] you will tell people
[1:52:16] hey there's life after this death
[1:52:20] you are in captivity
[1:52:23] to the triune plan of satan
[1:52:27] to take you to hell
[1:52:30] but there's one who's come
[1:52:35] who broke that chain
[1:52:38] and will give you the life
[1:52:44] that you can
[1:52:45] have victory
[1:52:47] that's right
[1:52:49] well probably because he's talking about
[1:52:52] giving
[1:52:53] a witness because he what so
[1:52:56] we're starting to see here and i said
[1:52:58] this is sort of the underlying thing
[1:53:01] is that there's there's a portion
[1:53:04] of that belongs to us
[1:53:07] when we become the voice
[1:53:12] of this message
[1:53:14] so every believer
[1:53:18] that is convinced
[1:53:21] is concerned
[1:53:24] and they become the voice
[1:53:26] of
[1:53:28] of the message
[1:53:31] now we know the message in our day is
[1:53:33] that the same resurrected life
[1:53:37] was sent over the gentiles to bring
[1:53:40] god's seed to life because the
[1:53:43] denominational fiction couldn't do it
[1:53:47] so let's just go here and he he says
[1:53:50] this in
[1:53:52] let's look at paragraph 54.
[1:53:56] he says now
[1:53:58] then
[1:53:59] not only that he sent his word to his
[1:54:03] disciples
[1:54:04] his
[1:54:05] his believing fear not
[1:54:09] for i am he that was dead and is alive
[1:54:13] again forevermore
[1:54:15] and i have the keys to death and hell
[1:54:20] i've got the keys
[1:54:22] to death in hell
[1:54:28] i've already conquered it don't fear
[1:54:31] anymore
[1:54:33] for every four
[1:54:35] days
[1:54:36] predestinated seed of god
[1:54:39] shall
[1:54:40] come to life
[1:54:42] when that light
[1:54:45] spreads across the earth
[1:54:48] of the glorious gospel
[1:54:51] in every
[1:54:53] age
[1:54:55] so that's what he said i'm going to shed
[1:54:57] this light
[1:54:59] i'm going to take this light this news
[1:55:02] this quickening power
[1:55:04] this spirit of life that brings the seed
[1:55:09] that's in you
[1:55:10] to life and breaks that captivity that's
[1:55:14] going to shine in every age
[1:55:19] now we can't be concerned with the ages
[1:55:22] gone by
[1:55:26] but i can be concerned about the age
[1:55:29] that i'm living in the light that was
[1:55:32] sent in this age to quicken the seed and
[1:55:37] bring it
[1:55:38] foreordained
[1:55:40] to life in every
[1:55:42] age
[1:55:45] it'll bring forth the crop
[1:55:48] that god ordained it to do
[1:55:52] now
[1:55:55] let me ask you this not in condemnation
[1:56:00] but ask yourself am i in that crop
[1:56:04] or
[1:56:05] you you know what i meant uh um am i
[1:56:09] in
[1:56:10] this camp or am i in that camp i'm of
[1:56:13] this political persuasion i'm i'm part
[1:56:16] of this cause
[1:56:18] i'm part of this or or i'm part of that
[1:56:25] because it's to it's to bring us to life
[1:56:29] to the cause
[1:56:31] of christ
[1:56:33] to the witness
[1:56:35] so in other words god's
[1:56:38] ordained seed
[1:56:40] that's brought to life
[1:56:42] now has that same message
[1:56:47] that's now their message
[1:56:49] it's not a message of social justice
[1:56:52] there is
[1:56:54] no
[1:56:55] social justice
[1:56:57] in a world that brings you to hell
[1:57:02] or the grave
[1:57:04] man will destroy one another they will
[1:57:07] hate one another they will imprison one
[1:57:10] another they'll put themselves in
[1:57:12] slavery they'll do ethnic cleansing
[1:57:16] they tried to kill the jews the cambod
[1:57:19] the cambodians tried to kill the poor in
[1:57:22] africa they had genocide in this country
[1:57:25] they had racial division and racial
[1:57:28] hatred hatred is a fruit of the devil
[1:57:31] it's a part of the threefold chain of
[1:57:34] satan
[1:57:36] and there's only one message
[1:57:38] that sets anybody free and that's the
[1:57:41] life of jesus christ being in a man
[1:57:44] whether he's black blue brown green
[1:57:46] yellow or whatever he is life comes from
[1:57:49] christ and from christ alone
[1:57:56] you're not going to change it
[1:58:01] hell
[1:58:03] is the end
[1:58:05] of anyone that does not possess
[1:58:08] the same spirit that jesus possessed
[1:58:14] no man can serve two kingdoms
[1:58:26] that's what we just read
[1:58:32] and that's what it quickly means means
[1:58:34] for that life that message
[1:58:37] to be brought alive in you you can ask
[1:58:39] yourself
[1:58:41] well we'll just read it
[1:58:43] but is that message alive in me
[1:58:46] okay
[1:58:47] let's not worry about
[1:58:50] what anybody thinks
[1:58:52] let's not worry about
[1:58:54] where you should be or where you
[1:58:56] shouldn't be
[1:58:59] let's just ask ourselves do i have that
[1:59:01] life in me well that's why i feel it's a
[1:59:04] growing life
[1:59:06] i'm not satisfied with the life that's
[1:59:08] in me
[1:59:12] i'm not satisfied with the things that
[1:59:14] are in my life that i know shouldn't be
[1:59:16] there
[1:59:18] okay
[1:59:19] but now i can press
[1:59:22] for the higher calling
[1:59:24] because i make a decision
[1:59:28] because the realization now is real
[1:59:32] that i've got to choose
[1:59:36] this day
[1:59:37] who i'm going to serve
[1:59:41] i i can't
[1:59:43] i i i i can't be lukewarm
[1:59:47] i can't try to mix this together and mix
[1:59:50] that together and and it takes a
[1:59:53] personal death and maybe in a a while
[1:59:56] i'll go more into my personal side of
[1:59:57] those things
[1:59:59] he says so as we read down he says now
[2:00:03] let's take we're going to read these
[2:00:05] next three paragraphs and let's just
[2:00:06] spend a few seconds on it
[2:00:09] paragraph 57
[2:00:11] 57
[2:00:12] he was quickened
[2:00:14] not only that
[2:00:17] and will send
[2:00:19] the same life
[2:00:22] that quickened me
[2:00:24] the power
[2:00:25] that brought me
[2:00:27] from the grave
[2:00:29] i will send it upon you
[2:00:34] to quicken you
[2:00:39] that where i am
[2:00:41] there ye
[2:00:42] will be also
[2:00:44] so now this is a promise
[2:00:48] i will send this same power
[2:00:51] to you
[2:00:53] now i like what brother mike was saying
[2:00:55] in his his exhortation
[2:00:58] we don't want a substitute
[2:01:01] we're not talking about a worship
[2:01:03] substitute or a church substitute we're
[2:01:07] talking about a personal
[2:01:10] possession
[2:01:13] and the results of that possession so
[2:01:15] that possession ain't going to give you
[2:01:17] an in and out life it's not going to be
[2:01:20] stoned and wrecked one day it can and
[2:01:22] back up believing and shouting it's
[2:01:24] going to take root where it brings this
[2:01:28] body under subjection
[2:01:31] so when it comes in it starts to work on
[2:01:34] you
[2:01:37] it's not microwave religion
[2:01:43] it starts to conquer
[2:01:46] remember how he said the he grant
[2:01:49] conquered
[2:01:50] how he conquered he said one city at a
[2:01:53] time one challenge at a time one mind
[2:01:56] battle at a time that life starts to go
[2:01:59] and starts to conquer you
[2:02:02] starts to conquer your mind it starts to
[2:02:05] conquer your body it starts to conquer
[2:02:07] your actions it starts to conquer your
[2:02:10] work it's a resurrection life coming
[2:02:13] alive like it did from the grave through
[2:02:16] the churches till we saw the first
[2:02:18] fruits of it manifested in our
[2:02:20] generation
[2:02:24] it's a conquering
[2:02:27] but i want to know it's working
[2:02:31] so look what he says he says it
[2:02:34] it it where i am
[2:02:36] there ye will be also
[2:02:38] in luke the 24th chapter and the 49th
[2:02:41] verse said behold i send you
[2:02:45] the promise
[2:02:48] of the father upon you
[2:02:51] so we just read what the promise was
[2:02:54] i'm going to send it
[2:02:56] unto you
[2:02:59] but now let's listen closely
[2:03:03] it says
[2:03:06] promised upon you
[2:03:07] but tarry
[2:03:10] or weight ye
[2:03:12] in the city of jerusalem until you be
[2:03:16] endued with power from on high may i say
[2:03:19] it this way may you be endued with that
[2:03:22] power
[2:03:24] from unhi
[2:03:27] he says
[2:03:28] to show
[2:03:29] that not only did he
[2:03:33] draw
[2:03:34] all the benefits out of it but he shared
[2:03:38] those benefits look don't understand you
[2:03:41] hear me preaching
[2:03:43] i'm preaching to myself
[2:03:47] but there's got to be something in me we
[2:03:51] call the deep calling to the deep we say
[2:03:53] we're the seed but let me tell you
[2:03:55] something the seed calls for the life
[2:04:02] and that's what he says tarry
[2:04:06] ask for it
[2:04:08] desire it
[2:04:12] it doesn't matter if i'm a wreck i'm a
[2:04:14] wreck
[2:04:16] if i've got the world in me i've got the
[2:04:18] world in me i can't change where i'm at
[2:04:23] but i can cry out
[2:04:25] rabbi
[2:04:26] have mercy on me
[2:04:30] hold out son of david
[2:04:32] have mercy on me
[2:04:36] i can be the little woman that reaches
[2:04:38] out and touches the hem of his garment
[2:04:41] lord i need your life
[2:04:43] she knew that he possessed
[2:04:46] power that would heal her
[2:04:52] but she made a new move to it
[2:04:55] she made a call for it she reached out
[2:04:57] and touched the hem of his garment she
[2:04:59] made contact with it and that's who you
[2:05:02] i don't care what your struggle is i
[2:05:04] don't care what your sin is but what i
[2:05:06] do care is are you asking god to put
[2:05:10] that life in you
[2:05:14] because there's no big eyes there's no
[2:05:16] little use there's nobody cleaner or
[2:05:18] better than anybody else but there's one
[2:05:21] thing we need we need the gift of god
[2:05:25] [Applause]
[2:05:28] amen give it to me lord
[2:05:31] give me more of it
[2:05:33] let it have conquering power in me i
[2:05:36] need the spirit of god to conquer david
[2:05:39] mcgary
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:43] not a time to get lukewarm it's not a
[2:05:45] time to run off the field it ain't a
[2:05:48] time for pleasure it's a time to get
[2:05:50] busy for the kingdom of god with the
[2:05:53] little bit of life you've got left
[2:05:56] [Applause]
[2:06:00] never seen a people
[2:06:04] that want to
[2:06:05] run off
[2:06:08] you don't retire
[2:06:11] from the gospel
[2:06:13] the fire grows bigger and bigger and
[2:06:15] bigger
[2:06:16] i don't care where you live in the flesh
[2:06:19] that has nothing to do with it but you
[2:06:21] don't lay down your witness
[2:06:26] and i know everybody just wants to say
[2:06:29] oh i'm just going to live the light
[2:06:33] and let my life shine
[2:06:38] let's just read on
[2:06:45] he comes to redeem to bring to life
[2:06:48] those predestinated seed that god
[2:06:51] seen before the foundation of the world
[2:06:53] and put their name on the lamb's book of
[2:06:55] life
[2:06:56] and here they are on the earth
[2:07:00] without hope
[2:07:02] he came not only to
[2:07:04] to
[2:07:05] to be a blessing
[2:07:07] but to share the blessing with every
[2:07:10] predestinated seed
[2:07:14] now if the seed wasn't on the earth
[2:07:17] it could not live
[2:07:19] it had to be on the earth
[2:07:22] and also germatized
[2:07:24] no matter how long it's kept in darkness
[2:07:28] it'll come forth when the s-o-n
[2:07:31] shines upon it
[2:07:33] notice now
[2:07:35] he come to share it with us
[2:07:40] it doesn't matter how long you've been
[2:07:43] in darkness
[2:07:45] you can be in this message and be in
[2:07:48] darkness
[2:07:52] darkness is any place
[2:07:55] that that s-o-n isn't shining
[2:07:59] brother david are there dark places
[2:08:02] in your life
[2:08:03] yes
[2:08:08] i am not saint david
[2:08:12] i don't want a statue
[2:08:14] i don't want candles
[2:08:17] i want the lord to take rule
[2:08:20] over every
[2:08:22] part of my life
[2:08:24] and every desire
[2:08:27] if it means i never draw drive another
[2:08:30] nail or ever cut another board or ever
[2:08:34] make another deal or ever do anything
[2:08:38] lord
[2:08:39] i'm willing to lay it down
[2:08:46] not i'm willing to fit it in
[2:08:54] that's just where we
[2:08:56] are
[2:08:59] now i know ministers have different
[2:09:01] things that they've got to give their
[2:09:03] life to
[2:09:04] but every individual is individual
[2:09:08] so we we see that that that
[2:09:11] part of getting this light
[2:09:13] is for you to call for it
[2:09:19] so
[2:09:21] if
[2:09:22] you see that there's
[2:09:24] some place lacking
[2:09:26] call out
[2:09:28] don't don't
[2:09:31] fill that
[2:09:32] spot
[2:09:34] with education
[2:09:36] i don't mean worldly education
[2:09:39] i mean message education
[2:09:43] get to the place where you know that you
[2:09:45] are in a good
[2:09:47] personal
[2:09:48] relationship with the lord
[2:09:51] that you talk to him and he talks to you
[2:09:54] and he proves his word
[2:09:56] there's nothing wrong with you lacking
[2:10:03] there's nothing wrong with you being
[2:10:05] sick
[2:10:07] when you get sick what do you do
[2:10:09] you pray for healing
[2:10:12] if you have not what do you do
[2:10:14] you ask
[2:10:17] don't go justifying yourself
[2:10:22] don't say well i've done all these good
[2:10:23] things i've done this i've served the
[2:10:25] lord for 50 years i've got a lot of
[2:10:28] converts
[2:10:29] when i find myself looking back
[2:10:33] at my works
[2:10:35] to justify
[2:10:37] my present state
[2:10:40] that's the first sign your backslid
[2:10:48] i don't care about yesterday
[2:10:52] i want my tomorrow to be victorious i
[2:10:55] want my tomorrow to possess more of that
[2:10:58] life i want my tomorrow to be have more
[2:11:02] proof
[2:11:03] of the resurrection
[2:11:06] the proof of the resurrection in me
[2:11:10] let's stay with that thought and move
[2:11:13] just
[2:11:14] to paragraph 61.
[2:11:21] notice
[2:11:22] the very message
[2:11:24] of the gospel itself
[2:11:26] is to prove to
[2:11:29] the people
[2:11:30] that he is risen
[2:11:37] now
[2:11:38] i'm just going to jump ahead so
[2:11:41] we can deal with this thought
[2:11:43] many of us look and look at brother
[2:11:45] branham and say brother branham prove to
[2:11:48] us
[2:11:49] that's the message brother branham did
[2:11:51] that brother branham did that but
[2:11:53] brother brown comes back and says in
[2:11:55] just a few paragraphs if the spirit of
[2:11:58] somebody is in you you will do the same
[2:12:00] thing that he did
[2:12:02] and if the blood was transferred then
[2:12:04] you would have that person's blood
[2:12:09] so if we've got the same life how many
[2:12:11] believes the life that was in our
[2:12:13] prophet messenger is the life of christ
[2:12:17] so much so that he fulfilled
[2:12:20] luke 17 30.
[2:12:27] he said to prove to the people that he's
[2:12:30] risen
[2:12:31] go tell my son my disciples that i've
[2:12:33] risen from the dead and i'll meet with
[2:12:36] them to confirm it to them he will meet
[2:12:39] with you
[2:12:40] to confirm it to you
[2:12:43] oh god
[2:12:44] how in this last days there shall be
[2:12:48] light
[2:12:49] again across the earth
[2:12:53] not only was that the ministry of the
[2:12:55] son of man
[2:12:57] revealed in our prophet
[2:12:59] but it's the life that that sun
[2:13:05] brought to life
[2:13:07] the seed life that that light shined
[2:13:11] was brought to life now that seed
[2:13:14] becomes a light and it shines because
[2:13:17] it's the same resurrected life brought
[2:13:20] to forth in you
[2:13:22] and i'll prove to my disciples
[2:13:26] go tell them that i'm not dead i'm not a
[2:13:31] tradition but i'm a living christ
[2:13:34] i'll meet them
[2:13:36] take this message to my disciples i am
[2:13:38] risen from the dead
[2:13:41] i will meet them that is god's promise
[2:13:44] to every seed i will meet you
[2:13:48] lord you want to meet me i'm a wreck
[2:13:52] i got so much religion wrapped on me i
[2:13:55] know most every answer to every question
[2:13:58] i you know i'm a sadducee i'm a pharisee
[2:14:01] i'm a priest i'm a preacher i'm all that
[2:14:04] stuff wrapped in one you still want to
[2:14:06] meet with e-yeah i want to meet with you
[2:14:09] your name's on the lamb's book of life
[2:14:11] so you're on my appointment book
[2:14:17] and you can keep running
[2:14:21] i would rather have a
[2:14:24] closet experience
[2:14:26] than a road to damascus experience
[2:14:30] but i'll meet you
[2:14:32] i'll change you
[2:14:35] it's my word
[2:14:38] i i will certainly do that
[2:14:40] now listen just to this as we're talking
[2:14:43] about we know about a meeting we know
[2:14:46] that we're the witnesses we know that
[2:14:48] we're to prove
[2:14:50] that he's risen
[2:14:54] he says this
[2:14:56] 62. he's the same yesterday day and
[2:15:00] forever we are as beneficiaries
[2:15:03] and are to prove
[2:15:06] his life is in us
[2:15:10] now
[2:15:15] we are to prove
[2:15:17] that his life
[2:15:19] is in us
[2:15:20] now the beneficiaries of this life
[2:15:25] the life there
[2:15:26] never was a life lived like it he was
[2:15:29] the son of god he died
[2:15:31] and it was shut up
[2:15:33] and when he raised again from the dead
[2:15:36] on easter morning
[2:15:37] then we
[2:15:39] as his servants
[2:15:42] are commissioned by him
[2:15:46] to go into all the world and bring this
[2:15:50] good news to every person
[2:15:53] that he is a living
[2:15:57] and how can we do it
[2:16:00] by word only
[2:16:05] for it is written
[2:16:07] the gospel came by not word only
[2:16:11] but through the power and the
[2:16:13] manifestation of the spirit
[2:16:16] that proves that he lives
[2:16:20] now these are simple requirements and i
[2:16:23] don't want to say it like requirements
[2:16:25] because you can't you can't manufacture
[2:16:29] it
[2:16:31] okay
[2:16:32] but if you have it
[2:16:35] you've asked for it
[2:16:37] you've sought it out
[2:16:40] and you've got it
[2:16:43] then
[2:16:45] it manifests itself
[2:16:49] by you sharing it with others
[2:16:53] so this is the life then he makes this
[2:16:55] statement there is
[2:16:58] is there another gospel
[2:17:02] is there another gospel than this what
[2:17:05] we're talking about this morning
[2:17:08] that i have made contact and
[2:17:11] emma
[2:17:12] zesser and jesus
[2:17:15] gave me
[2:17:16] the same life that he had
[2:17:20] this is why pentecost
[2:17:23] religion
[2:17:26] was such a deception
[2:17:28] because it made the holy spirit out to
[2:17:31] be a third person
[2:17:33] and a different anointing
[2:17:36] so we could have our life
[2:17:38] and the holy spirit life
[2:17:43] but this life is a oneness
[2:17:46] now i know the shape i'm in
[2:17:49] and i need i know more of that life
[2:17:52] and i'm sure each of us probably has
[2:17:55] spots in our life that we're not pleased
[2:17:58] with
[2:17:59] but let's ask him to come to those
[2:18:02] places
[2:18:06] he's not here against us he doesn't want
[2:18:09] to see any of his children perish but
[2:18:12] he's longing for his children to invite
[2:18:15] him behold i stand at the door and knock
[2:18:22] open up i will come in and help you
[2:18:26] clean house
[2:18:28] i will come in
[2:18:30] and sup with you
[2:18:32] on others i will come in and supply the
[2:18:34] nourishment
[2:18:36] the spirit
[2:18:37] the grace
[2:18:39] for you to be able to overcome this
[2:18:42] weakness in your life
[2:18:46] remember he plants
[2:18:48] he finds
[2:18:50] he nourishes and feeds
[2:18:53] no he plants
[2:18:56] he finds
[2:18:57] he quickens
[2:19:00] he nourishes and feeds and he harvests
[2:19:07] he's here for us
[2:19:10] we're almost coming to the end of our
[2:19:12] comment
[2:19:13] is there another gospel
[2:19:16] i'm surprised that you've turned to
[2:19:18] another gospel
[2:19:20] there is no other gospel
[2:19:22] but a make-believe
[2:19:25] gospel
[2:19:28] either i'm a make-believe gospel
[2:19:31] or i've got the real thing i'm not
[2:19:34] ashamed to say wait a minute
[2:19:36] there's parts that i'm
[2:19:38] faking
[2:19:44] i'm willing to expose myself
[2:19:48] publicly
[2:19:52] even to the tone of critics
[2:19:56] or people that might want to comb
[2:19:58] through my life to see if they can find
[2:20:00] my weaknesses
[2:20:03] but god's giving you an opportunity to
[2:20:05] go to him in private
[2:20:10] that's how important it is
[2:20:18] it's a make-believe gospel
[2:20:20] it's a denomination of fiction
[2:20:24] that's turning from the good news what's
[2:20:27] the good news i will give you my life
[2:20:31] the same thing that i have i'll give to
[2:20:33] you all we've got to do is say i want it
[2:20:37] i'm going to wait for it i'm going to
[2:20:39] tarry for it i'm going to ask for it
[2:20:42] every day
[2:20:45] if you have to feed it to me little by
[2:20:47] little because if i took the whole thing
[2:20:49] at once i'd blow up
[2:20:51] i'm happy with that
[2:20:55] give me life
[2:20:57] let me grow
[2:20:59] and i'm not driving you to conviction
[2:21:02] i'm not driving you to look back at all
[2:21:04] the things you've done and all the nasty
[2:21:06] things you brought into church with you
[2:21:08] this morning i'm trying to tell you you
[2:21:10] can ask and you can receive
[2:21:14] because he's alive
[2:21:29] that's what
[2:21:32] he said here
[2:21:34] and in 64
[2:21:37] he simply says
[2:21:39] the works that i do
[2:21:42] will identify myself
[2:21:45] in you
[2:21:47] what a message
[2:21:50] it shall be light
[2:21:52] at the evening time
[2:21:56] amen
[2:21:58] who is that light
[2:22:00] what's the last light
[2:22:03] you
[2:22:04] are the light of the world
[2:22:07] you are the salt of the earth
[2:22:09] lay for yourself a pattern of good works
[2:22:12] that your good works might glorify the
[2:22:15] father in heaven this is the same gospel
[2:22:18] that jesus preached
[2:22:25] paragraphs
[2:22:27] uh
[2:22:29] uh so we we see we are to prove that the
[2:22:32] life is in us
[2:22:34] that the
[2:22:35] with the works that i do shall you do
[2:22:37] also
[2:22:38] in 65 he says now the very essence of
[2:22:41] the message
[2:22:43] was sent
[2:22:44] that he has risen from the dead we are
[2:22:47] beneficiaries
[2:22:49] who share
[2:22:51] the resurrection with him
[2:22:54] now listen to this
[2:22:57] draw benefits from this
[2:23:01] by proving
[2:23:03] to the world
[2:23:04] that he is alive
[2:23:08] see
[2:23:09] we want to draw all the benefits of the
[2:23:11] life
[2:23:12] but you only draw the benefits
[2:23:15] when you start to prove to the world
[2:23:17] he's alive
[2:23:21] if the wages of sin is death
[2:23:26] the wages of good works is life
[2:23:30] show me your faith without your works
[2:23:34] and i will show you my faith by my works
[2:23:37] we draw benefits
[2:23:39] or we draw from this life
[2:23:42] as we try to prove to people that he
[2:23:46] lives
[2:23:47] so you want to you want to really be a
[2:23:49] christian you want to make the right
[2:23:51] stand you want to have the right nature
[2:23:54] you want to say the right thing you pray
[2:23:56] about it you want to prove that christ
[2:23:58] is living in you when you get to that
[2:24:01] then he feels that power he sends that
[2:24:05] quickening and he makes that alive
[2:24:13] all you got to do is ask it's real
[2:24:14] simple
[2:24:16] don't make it complicated don't judge
[2:24:18] yourself out of the picture
[2:24:21] don't think your past
[2:24:24] no matter how long it's been there if
[2:24:26] it's there it's there if it's coming to
[2:24:28] life now let it live
[2:24:32] there's a lot of people in this message
[2:24:34] that aren't born again
[2:24:37] let's get them born again
[2:24:42] it's not something you're going to be
[2:24:44] feared into
[2:24:46] it's going to when that word comes to
[2:24:48] you and you say wait a minute it's real
[2:24:51] i don't have it
[2:24:53] something in me wants it
[2:24:57] and i ask for it
[2:24:58] and i tarry for it
[2:25:01] and you shall
[2:25:03] you've been baptized you shall
[2:25:09] we draw benefits from this by proving
[2:25:13] to the world that he's alive
[2:25:16] we cannot do it by word
[2:25:20] only
[2:25:23] we cannot do it
[2:25:24] by some tradition of man
[2:25:27] we only reflect exactly what we're
[2:25:31] pointing to
[2:25:39] that's powerful
[2:25:41] i mean
[2:25:43] i i just sit back what am i pointing to
[2:25:46] and then i realize brother branham asked
[2:25:47] the question what are you pointing to
[2:25:50] he makes in one sermon he says there's
[2:25:52] too many things pointing to too many
[2:25:54] other things that was the one thing that
[2:25:57] made the i would say brother ram stand
[2:26:00] out he never begged for money he never
[2:26:03] tried to build an organization he never
[2:26:05] tried to build a great big this and a
[2:26:07] great big bat but he was so steadfast
[2:26:10] with his finger pointing to one thing
[2:26:13] you've got to have the same life
[2:26:17] that was in christ in you
[2:26:21] carry for it
[2:26:22] he will give it to you
[2:26:26] you say i'm a sinner repent
[2:26:29] and be baptized and you shall receive
[2:26:32] the promise of the father the gift of
[2:26:35] life
[2:26:36] you say i've been baptized then wait on
[2:26:39] it call on it
[2:26:42] start applying the token purging
[2:26:45] yourself making your life better where
[2:26:47] he can come in
[2:26:50] but whatever you do
[2:26:52] get it
[2:26:56] let's read paragraph 69
[2:26:59] we he talked about that blood type right
[2:27:02] before it
[2:27:03] if your spirit
[2:27:05] that
[2:27:06] in you
[2:27:08] is reckoned dead
[2:27:10] and you are anointed
[2:27:12] with the life
[2:27:14] that was in christ
[2:27:16] is upon you
[2:27:20] and so god's not taking your life away
[2:27:22] from you
[2:27:26] but he's manifesting himself
[2:27:29] in the person that he made you
[2:27:32] so his anointing is upon you
[2:27:34] romans 8 11 if the spirit that raised
[2:27:38] christ from the dead dwells in you
[2:27:41] it'll also quicken your mortal bodies
[2:27:44] that same life
[2:27:46] them same powers
[2:27:48] them same beneficiaries
[2:27:51] that he had here on earth
[2:27:54] from god
[2:27:56] he redeemed you
[2:27:58] a seed that was foreign by god whose
[2:28:02] name was put on the lamb's book of life
[2:28:04] before the foundation of the world
[2:28:10] so
[2:28:12] it's entitled to you
[2:28:17] a promise is a gift
[2:28:22] don't run from it
[2:28:25] let's stop
[2:28:26] and surrender
[2:28:28] and make sure
[2:28:30] that we've made personal contact
[2:28:34] with that great life
[2:28:37] the same benefits that he had on earth
[2:28:40] from god
[2:28:46] listen closely
[2:28:50] 70
[2:28:52] and that gospel light
[2:28:55] of the resurrection
[2:28:57] the confirmation
[2:28:59] of the word
[2:29:00] how
[2:29:01] do
[2:29:02] we know
[2:29:03] he was the christ
[2:29:05] because he proved what he talked about
[2:29:10] how
[2:29:11] will i know
[2:29:13] the message of the hour
[2:29:16] god proves what he promised
[2:29:20] and
[2:29:21] he
[2:29:22] talks
[2:29:23] about it
[2:29:27] a lot of people are leaving
[2:29:30] the talk about it
[2:29:33] off
[2:29:37] here the sun rises
[2:29:40] the son of man
[2:29:43] it didn't show up in john doe
[2:29:47] it didn't show up in a priesthood
[2:29:50] because melchizedek was not a priesthood
[2:29:54] that life
[2:29:57] that he wanted to transfer
[2:30:00] to the seed and the crop of this age
[2:30:05] that life was in william miriam branham
[2:30:11] i'm not taking away from the lord jesus
[2:30:14] brother branham was a sinner
[2:30:16] redeemed by the blood
[2:30:19] and he meant god under the shed blood he
[2:30:22] didn't meet god by his gift he didn't
[2:30:25] meet god because he was born and made a
[2:30:27] prophet he meant god under the shed
[2:30:30] blood of jesus christ was forgiven of
[2:30:32] his sins
[2:30:34] and from his testimony
[2:30:37] i knew in him being irish he had a
[2:30:40] temper
[2:30:45] he liked to fight
[2:30:50] you know you don't need to give any
[2:30:52] honor above him what god gave the honor
[2:30:55] god gave him is he was the first fruit
[2:30:59] of the seed that possessed the fullness
[2:31:03] of what that resurrected promise was to
[2:31:05] the believer
[2:31:08] and he was chosen
[2:31:13] to be the one that shined that light
[2:31:17] in this age that every seed could
[2:31:20] recognize the difference between
[2:31:23] denominational fiction and the true
[2:31:26] gospel of life
[2:31:29] [Applause]
[2:31:33] and we're invited
[2:31:38] by the call of the spirit
[2:31:40] and by the quickening of the conviction
[2:31:44] of god's word upon your heart to be a
[2:31:46] partaker of it
[2:31:52] but you can't separate the message from
[2:31:55] the messenger
[2:31:59] why
[2:32:01] because he's the reflection
[2:32:03] of the work
[2:32:07] that's the same thing that people that
[2:32:09] want to take salvation and not mention
[2:32:11] jesus
[2:32:15] preach the beatitudes
[2:32:17] preach sharing preach all the works and
[2:32:20] never mention jesus
[2:32:24] no i'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[2:32:27] jesus christ that's right because it's
[2:32:28] the power of god unto salvation this is
[2:32:32] where i know
[2:32:34] that i'm going to receive the quickening
[2:32:37] power to bring me to life
[2:32:41] because there's places i haven't come to
[2:32:43] yet
[2:32:47] and the sun stays with the seed all the
[2:32:50] way from its germination all the way to
[2:32:53] its harvest
[2:33:02] you you it
[2:33:04] you you can't separate it you got it you
[2:33:08] you talk about it he said
[2:33:11] we are beneficiaries with him of the
[2:33:13] resurrection he proved what he was
[2:33:15] talking about
[2:33:18] so how are we going to prove if we never
[2:33:20] talk about it
[2:33:22] how are we going to prove there's a
[2:33:23] light that shined in this day
[2:33:26] how are we going to be a beneficiary of
[2:33:28] it if we don't prove to the world what
[2:33:31] god's
[2:33:32] done everybody and even today
[2:33:36] in this message is trying to take people
[2:33:39] back to calvary and back to pentecost
[2:33:42] back to that type of holy ghost
[2:33:45] experience where the holy ghost
[2:33:48] experience of this day is the
[2:33:50] resurrected spirit that rose in jesus
[2:33:53] christ coming to you
[2:33:56] in this day in living person
[2:34:03] i don't want something that somebody
[2:34:05] else had
[2:34:09] i don't want yesterday's manna i don't
[2:34:11] want what peter had
[2:34:13] and paul had
[2:34:15] i want what god had for me in his mind
[2:34:19] before the foundation of the world that
[2:34:21] that life that was in christ would be
[2:34:24] manifested in me
[2:34:29] that's what i want
[2:34:32] you have it maybe not
[2:34:34] but praise god for this word
[2:34:38] that he can identify it to me
[2:34:41] and i can seek it
[2:34:44] because he said if you seek
[2:34:46] you shall find
[2:34:49] i don't know what i did with my glasses
[2:34:52] did i throw them somewhere
[2:34:56] what happened to him
[2:34:58] no i found him
[2:35:01] seek and you shall find
[2:35:11] all right so let's we just beautiful
[2:35:13] paragraph 69 70
[2:35:15] and he talked about it uh i want you to
[2:35:17] be aware
[2:35:19] when
[2:35:22] sermon after sermon
[2:35:24] what god done in this day isn't
[2:35:26] mentioned
[2:35:28] and i'm not saying it's a requirement to
[2:35:29] preach the gospel
[2:35:32] i when i talk to somebody
[2:35:34] i always present
[2:35:37] the promise
[2:35:39] and then i present who fulfilled that
[2:35:41] promise
[2:35:43] that's your own individual
[2:35:45] level
[2:35:50] i i won't go there but there's a lot of
[2:35:52] things that i want the lord to help me
[2:35:54] with my spirit
[2:35:56] he said he says now in this day
[2:35:59] paragraph 17 now in this day
[2:36:03] he proves what he said
[2:36:05] because they are a part of that seed
[2:36:10] that was represented
[2:36:12] in the book of life
[2:36:14] that he came to redeem back to god again
[2:36:18] oh what a message
[2:36:21] amen oh what a beautiful
[2:36:24] message and then
[2:36:27] let's
[2:36:27] close with this
[2:36:30] reading of this paragraph
[2:36:34] this morning
[2:36:37] the darkened world
[2:36:39] of unbelief
[2:36:42] where churches
[2:36:43] and denominations
[2:36:45] and so forth
[2:36:48] had drawn us out
[2:36:52] and there's
[2:36:53] something in us
[2:36:55] calling
[2:36:57] oh
[2:36:58] we want god
[2:37:01] we're hungering
[2:37:03] and thirsting
[2:37:05] for god
[2:37:06] we joined the methodists
[2:37:10] baptists pentecostals
[2:37:13] presbyterians
[2:37:14] and whatever
[2:37:16] and still
[2:37:17] there was something wrong
[2:37:20] we just couldn't find it yet
[2:37:24] and all of a sudden
[2:37:27] while we was groping in darkness
[2:37:31] the great resurrection came to us
[2:37:35] in the manifestation
[2:37:37] of the promised
[2:37:40] word of god
[2:37:41] the manifestation
[2:37:43] of the promise of malachi 4 5 the
[2:37:47] manifestation of the promise of luke 17
[2:37:50] 30. the manifestation of john 12
[2:37:56] revelations
[2:37:59] 3
[2:38:00] 14.
[2:38:02] it brought us to life
[2:38:05] and it let us know there is a life
[2:38:08] he's caught our attention
[2:38:11] he he's drawn us to him
[2:38:14] we've recognized
[2:38:17] that
[2:38:18] what that he is speaking about
[2:38:21] is truth
[2:38:23] that there is the ability
[2:38:26] or promise
[2:38:28] that a believer can have the life of
[2:38:31] christ in him
[2:38:33] and be free from the lust of the flesh
[2:38:36] be free from the pride of life
[2:38:40] be able to lay down his own personal
[2:38:43] goals
[2:38:44] and desires
[2:38:46] to give his life
[2:38:47] to the lord jesus
[2:38:49] and that the lord will take care of him
[2:38:53] you don't have need you'll never have to
[2:38:55] break bread
[2:38:58] he'll provide your every need
[2:39:00] he'll take care of you
[2:39:06] and he wants to enter in
[2:39:09] to not a church relationship
[2:39:12] but a husband-wife
[2:39:15] bride
[2:39:16] relationship
[2:39:18] and
[2:39:21] and i i can't emphasize especially the
[2:39:24] younger people i every believer
[2:39:28] if you want more you got to ask for more
[2:39:31] you got to tarry for more
[2:39:34] you got to
[2:39:35] do what you can do
[2:39:37] and apply the token
[2:39:39] but in doing so always hold the promise
[2:39:43] he promised to give me life
[2:39:46] and life more abundant
[2:39:48] he promised that where he is i'll be
[2:39:51] also
[2:39:53] he wants to share
[2:39:54] that spirit
[2:39:56] with me
[2:39:57] and i want it shared
[2:40:00] in my life
[2:40:01] and so
[2:40:03] we will
[2:40:05] stop
[2:40:07] here
[2:40:08] this morning
[2:40:09] and
[2:40:10] i'd like to just say and i don't know

[2:40:42] can do for you
[2:40:44] exceedingly and abundantly god's not
[2:40:47] angry at you
[2:40:49] for your past life
[2:40:51] because he's already has the blood
[2:40:53] over it
[2:40:55] all he's asking us to do is come out
[2:40:59] he never said go fix everything

[2:53:38] lord
[2:53:40] [Music]
[2:53:52] is
[2:53:58] [Music]
[2:54:11] we're going to help with the jackson
[2:54:12] tell us a testimony and just close our
[2:54:14] service in prayer this morning
[2:54:17] just kind of want to share a testimony
[2:54:19] of things that just happened
[2:54:22] a lot of times we know that when the
[2:54:23] word comes forth
[2:54:25] it's after that that the spirit is
[2:54:27] starting to be stirred within the people
[2:54:30] and we've seen it many times and even
[2:54:32] just just now
[2:54:34] as you know as the spirit's moving in
[2:54:36] the church
[2:54:37] brother matthew came to grab me because
[2:54:40] brother leonte
[2:54:42] which is brother
[2:54:43] cosma's dad had it on his heart felt
[2:54:46] like the lord spoke to him to grab some
[2:54:48] of the brothers to pray for brother
[2:54:50] david from his accident and just some of
[2:54:51] the things that he's been going through
[2:54:53] so they pulled him to the back pulled me
[2:54:55] to the back we just started to converse
[2:54:57] about it and then brother david asked
[2:55:00] for prayer
[2:55:01] and ask the brothers to come so we just
[2:55:03] wanted to share that where you see
[2:55:05] god deal with the man's heart grab
[2:55:07] another brother come up here to get
[2:55:09] brother david and pray for him just for
[2:55:11] the things that he's going through and
[2:55:13] some maybe the side effects from the
[2:55:14] accident so we know that god is moving
[2:55:17] and we know when the word goes forth
[2:55:19] that you can see it come into action
[2:55:21] brother david's always preaching a
[2:55:23] gospel that says we don't want it to
[2:55:24] just maybe live on the pages we don't
[2:55:27] want us to just maybe always live in the
[2:55:28] pew but may it be an action and we see
[2:55:30] that the prophet's message comes forth
[2:55:33] working still through men to allow those
[2:55:35] things that he has desire to do and
[2:55:37] fulfill
[2:55:38] so we just want to give the lord that
[2:55:40] testimony let's pray
[2:55:42] heavenly father we come to you this
[2:55:43] morning
[2:55:44] lord we see your word just perform an
[2:55:46] action in our church lord we know that
[2:55:48] when your word is spoke lord it can deal
[2:55:50] with individuals
[2:55:52] but it's when we're able to put
[2:55:53] ourselves aside our own spirits our own
[2:55:55] thoughts and let your still small voice
[2:55:58] deal with our hearts
[2:55:59] lord you performed something this
[2:56:01] morning where each of us had something
[2:56:02] that we had need of lord we believe that
[2:56:05] you feel those parts lord we believe
[2:56:07] that you speak to us lord if you're if
[2:56:09] we're if there's a young person here
[2:56:11] lord they may be dealing with things
[2:56:12] that that that a married man might be
[2:56:14] different with or or someone lord that
[2:56:16] has been in the ministry you reach us
[2:56:18] and eat each level lord and we thank you
[2:56:21] for that we thank you lord for the word
[2:56:23] that's gone and and the things that
[2:56:24] you're doing amongst our church
[2:56:26] lord we ask that you would give brother
[2:56:27] david strength lord we know that he
[2:56:29] preached his heart out and we've always
[2:56:31] been taught that the gift is that a man
[2:56:33] gets himself out of the way and it's
[2:56:34] either behind the pulpit or it's at work
[2:56:37] or it's at home wherever we are lord if
[2:56:39] we can get ourselves out of the way and
[2:56:41] let you work through us we know that the
[2:56:43] holy spirit can operate in that lord we
[2:56:45] thank you for the service and each one
[2:56:47] that played a part here we know it's not
[2:56:49] just one or two individuals but it's a
[2:56:51] body that comes together and allows
[2:56:52] these things to happen we love you we
[2:56:54] thank you for the testimony we ask all
[2:56:56] these things in jesus name amen amen
[2:57:00] amen god bless you
