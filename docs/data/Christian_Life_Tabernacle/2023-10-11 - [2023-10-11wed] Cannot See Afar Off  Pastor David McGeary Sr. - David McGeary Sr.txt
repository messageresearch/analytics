evening in this time of service we ask it in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles let's open up to uh first Peter and we want to read uh uh oh I said first Peter but um we'll do I think it's second Peter and then uh uh the first chapter you can find that here so let's read we're going to read 1 through 4 and then we'll jump down and uh uh uh skip uh to uh verse 9 it says Simon Peter a servant and an apostle to Jesus Christ to them that have obtained light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ so that's one thing we have in common right we all have a like Precious Faith Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue what a great scripture for anytime that you don't understand something or you got a question on your heart at or you you wonder which way you should go go back and read that it said all things are given unto me that pertain to the Lord that pertain to living right that pertain to Godliness whether it's Grace whether it's correction whether it's divine intervention whether it's the supernatural no matter what it is it's given to you that you might cry call climb H higher to a higher calling whereby are given un does exceedingly great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and then we drop down the next few scriptures as you know are the statue of a perfect man but let us drop down to nine but he that lackes these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen you may be seated amen anybody that has any spare time uh this weekend we will be working around the church so if you feel like coming out feel U please feel free but quite a week hasn't it been you know I would have thought tonight with what's going on in Israel that there wouldn't be a SE seat left in the house of the Lord amen what a uh What uh an amazing event but you know Peter says here he says that uh they can't see uh a far off they couldn't see a far off I was in Vancouver this weekend and they took me for a ride down to the city and they were going to show me some sites and I said I'd like you to take me down to this place that you're talking about where it seems like um the homeless are starting to gather and so they said oh yes I think they call it Hasting Street they said I said I'd like to drive down that and so you know they said no you don't want to go there and they they began to talk but I just felt compelled to drive down there and it wasn't an unfamiliar scene we drove down there and there's tents on the sidewalk and people laying out on the curbs and and everything but that used to be what was considered downtown you know that's where the shopping was that's where the shops were that's where everything was and now it's completely run down for blocks and uh they you know and they make comments like whatever you do uh don't get out of the car and lock the doors of course I'm not afraid of those things because that's where I came from you know that's where I would have been if there wasn't divine intervention in my life and I could look out onto those uh streets and and see myself but I thought you know I I wonder if they ever realized that was coming they couldn't see a far off they couldn't see that the the actions that they were taking and what was transpiring uh every day people wanting to get more wealthy and hoard more wealth and and to to build bigger and make things more expensive that they were grinding out homeless people every day now I feel sorry I know some of them have mental illness but you know they poisoned them with their TVs they poisoned them with alcohol they poison them with drugs and now they they when they started it all they didn't see a far off they could just passed another crazy law in California that that it it's no longer uh I got to say this in a way because we have young people but it it's no longer against the law to loiter and walk on the the street and solicit and and it's caused an outbreak down there that even Californians are shocked at you know uh very of uh just almost nakedness on the street and and I wonder if they could see a far off when they made those decisions you know a lot of people make decisions and they never they never look a far off they never consider what will be the end of the decision I'm making you know uh Gary was sharing with me uh uh something he said you know he says I remember from the sermon birth pains that it was brought out that it's under pressure that people make the worst decisions that they ever make you know I mean they they feel they're pressed in to making an instant decision you know every decision of a Believer should be prayed through amen they should think about it you know what what why am I doing you know I I I remember I counsel so many young men uh that were entering the workforce and boy their boss would say something that would make them mad and up they would pack their tools in the box and they were off you know what I mean I'll go find another job you know one day there's not going to be jobs to find and you're going to have to be able to learn to cope with that you know don't let that guy run you off he's stuck where he's at you know you're learning you're growing you got years ahead of you don't let one hardhead or one mean person uh force you into making a decision that's going to hurt you in the long run that's probably why he's doing it it's just like in school don't let a a a teacher that's uh not friendly or or mean to you or makes fun of you don't let them affect your lifelong decisions you know they're if I could say that they're not going any place you're going to move on to the next grade and they're going to be right there picking on somebody else you know I mean years and years grades are passing you're just starting your life you you got Vision ahead of you there's nothing that you can't do you keep a positive outlook and you move forward so you never let the negative ever throw such an effect on you that it it forces you into a decision you sit back and you look a far off you know what I mean don't let somebody do something to you that puts a root of bitterness in your heart because that person later down the road might be just the person that you need to to have to help you in life you know my best friends were always the ones that I got in a great big fight with you know we didn't like each other we had a fight and after the fight we became friends you know what I mean so you know I'm just getting to something but I I want to let it soak in a little bit about what I'm talking about looking a far off you know what I mean what it means that to uh and you say well the scripture says take one day at a time it does because the evil of that days sufficient that's right but he said look at the Fig Tree you know I me when it begins to put forth buds that's a sign he said look at the Moon look at the look at the sun look at the sky you know what I mean that's that's a sign so we're told in the scripture that we look a far off do you you know that every promise of God is a prophecy that's right amen you know what I mean Jesus said by my stripes you're healed well that just is a promise till one day somebody draws on that promise and somebody's healed if nobody's ever healed then that would have never come to pass and that what everything in the scripture is every promise is telling you what he's going to do I'm not going to leave you I'm not going to forsake you I'm going to be with you even in you so all those things were spoken but yet they if you would have to look a far off to see uh when they come to pass and so it's needful for us especially in this hour and what's going on to sit back and look a far off put on our prophetic scriptural uh eyes have that we can see there's something going on major going on the natural always types the spiritual like I said here before and I set up in Canada we we we are fighting for the Rapture that's right we're fighting for the Rapture and as many many of you know that they there there's a war going on in Israel I mean the most horrific Slaughter since the Holocaust and I don't know if any of us were even alive that are in this room that were even alive during that time but now it's risen again in our generation and like we could go into all kinds of Bible teaching right now about the Four Winds and the angels grabbing the Four Winds and about how the war was stopped and so many things that the prophet of God told us but you know one of the things that everybody's crying out on the news and and in politics and everywhere is it was an intelligence failure that's right thank that's right they didn't see a far off they didn't seeing it coming and we're warned about the thief in the night we're warned about him breaking in and and entering the house if the strongman knew the thief was coming you know what I mean he he would be prepared for it and so this is all that they're saying they're saying it's it's an intelligence failure they they they didn't read the signs they thought they thought there was peace and safety one of our diplomats got up and just boasted two days before there's never been peace like there is now there's there's never been Harmony like there is now there's never been uh uh people working together like they're working now you know when you find out that two people and I'm not talking in the Christian realm but two countries are just acting all cozy to one another one of them's got something up their sleeve they're they're they're they're lulling them to sleep and and that's what they they thought happened everything seemed to be going good everything seemed to be fine nobody was going over the Border nobody was doing everything at and and just for a moment they didn't see a far off how many knows that our Me Prophet mentions that same thing with Pearl Harbor that's right he said they were all drunken and they were all having a good time everything was fine and they should have been able to see my goodness they could have sat up there with binoculars and seeing that thing AAR off you could have just put your ear to the wind and you would have heard all those ples this guy must have been a a a buzzer you know what I mean but let me tell you something I don't know when the 144,000 are going to come but those people are a part of us whether they get white robes whether in the 144,000 they were blinded for our sake amen and their Messiah will return to them you know what I mean it ought to alarm us it ought to put us in prayer it ought to move Upon Our Hearts and spirit but it's also a Time piece that's right we can't let the fact that what's transpiring ought to be a real wakeup call you know a real genuine uh uh examination yes sir of what am I lacking what what's going on you know what I mean uh uh something fixtion to happen I need to look a far off and ask myself am I prepared and that's what the word does the word lets us look a far off how many knows we were told there'll be wars and rumors of wars earthquakes floods have you looked back over lately how many floods there been how many earthquakes there's been but what happens we get so common to those things I remember there used to be a story wasn't it where the little boy cried wolf you know what finally they just got tired of hearing it Peter says they begin to say where are the signs of his coming all things Contin Contin you as they are this is just another thing it's just another war no it's not and let me explain to you my view I'm not preaching Doctrine I'm I'm just sharing with you my view of things and and not to convert you to my view but to inspire you to pray and find your own Outlook your own view your own discernment of what's transpiring can sit back and not let this slip by but let's see what's possibly going on here and we've been touching on these things and I'd like to go over them one more time we talked about the Rich Young Ruler in the message investment he knew he lacked something you what I mean so he he wanted to know uh what must I do to inherit the kingdom of God what a great question amen you know when I begin to come up against certain things then I realize you know I should be farther down the road like I told the our our brothers and sisters in Canada we ought to be progressing spiritually at least as fast as the world is degress that's right we ought to be rising in power amen hallelujah and in understanding and in faith and solid commitment to God's word as fast are as they are running towards all this gender and all this craziness that's going on I we at least ought to match up at least that much you know what I mean we can't afford to be left behind but the rich ruler lacked something so he went to Jesus and said what must I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus says keep all the law all the Commandments and he said I've done all those things from my youth now that ought to tell us something that that wasn't what did it I would like to be able to say that I've never lied I've never hurt nobody I've never stole I never cheated you know what I mean I've never I've never painted the situation just a little bit so it looked favorable this guy was pretty upright but Jesus say you lack one thing sell all you have and follow me now you say why did he tell them that because Jesus could see a far off he could see the pathway that this riches was going to take this man he knew it wouldn't be long that that Spirit would overtake him and his greed would overtake him and then Barnes weren't big enough he had to have bigger he had to have more he had to make more he had he he he wasn't satisfied and other words for from going completely to complete peace and possessing the kingdom of God not being able to see a far off he made a terrible decision and he walked away sorrowful for he had much riches he didn't know that those riches was going to put him in Hell begging for somebody to go tell his family and just to have a drop water put on his tongue see the Lord knew cuz the Lord can see a far off so he intervened in this man's life to try to get him off of the path that he was on but the draw in him to riches and to fame and to recognition and the SE sitting at the feast and and being exalted was greater than the draw in him for eternal life and that's what we've got to really understand and when we talk about understanding your predestination and we talked about that that that we're in a battle for a Rapture yes sir so we want the draw in us to be for eternal life for the Rapture and so uh you know he he didn't feel that pole so we understood when we read in in the message I think it was thinking man filter that when we came into this world we didn't have a chance we were born in sin shaped in iniquity came and speaking life standing in a pile of crumbs and mommy says did you get into the cookie jar Little Johnny no mama not Me Oh Oh you mean not me did it again not me the evidence there everything there the worst person to lie to is yourself you know it's not the time you want to lie to yourself and so the the very we didn't have a chance because we were drawn to those things right the only way God could create in us a nature change because you couldn't change your nature with the nature you had right and you know when when somebody asked the prophet of God how do I know I've got the Holy Ghost I believe it's the interview with I forget the sister's name but he said sis he says look at your nature have your nature changed is there a change in your nature he says that's how you know cuz you could have all the gifts all the healing speak with tongues do everything and and still have that old nature but if you've had that real genuine nature change something's changed in you from the way that you were and do something else pulled you and Drew you to be something else so that's what God did he put a seed in us right and that seed is what Drew us out of the darkness I was a hippie I was a a drug addict I I was into music I had all these things I I had didn't even have it in my mind that there was such a thing as an elect lady a bride and a prophet you think I thought oh wonder if there's a prophet read the Bible what a waste of time you know I was waiting for the next vinyl album to come out where's the next concert where's the next lovein you you know all kinds of of foolishness there was nothing to turn me around but I had a seed in me and that seed had a season you understand there came a time when that seed needed the word of God to survive remember just like the blade of grass underneath the con rete it's got to have sunlight so it'll do everything it can to press its way to the sunlight so that seed begin to make a move amen I didn't make the move the seed in me made the move it was the seed drawing me to the word amen cuz a seed had to get the word that's started my life to fall to pieces I used to like to do things all of a sudden I was paranoid scared to death policeman drive down the road I'd crawl underneath the bed totally insane wasn't even in my right mind why not because of anything other than the seed was changing the conditions around me amen just think of it the very seed in my life its pull to the word of God was changing the atmosphere in which I was living it wasn't just outside forces it was him working on the inside changing the outside think of it where you might have lived what kind of life you have he tear up your whole world brother lante to get you to the word of God he's not going to lose you it was the seed that did that why because life connects with life and sin connects with sin there's two sides for me two armies for me that's right there's a battle coming and it's the battle for the Rapture the world is moving to a place where your convictions and the mind of Christ will be illegal they're they thinking that they're killing you thinking they're doing God a service if we could get rid of some of these voices that cry out against some of this stuff yeah get rid of the voice yeah that's crying out that's what they want to do so the the seed that was planted in you had a purpose and a season now look place this and especially you younger people somebody's going to fulfill the Rapture there has a seed been planted that a rapturing seed and I know there's a lot of teaching and Doctrine going on and I'm not pointing to any people about the word coming and the word coming in the bride uh this is a leaving message the word has come to draw the predestinated raptured seed to the Rapture that's right it's going to draw them in the fruit and the reason that God put that seed in there because he's got to prove his word about coming again and someone being caught up sir and I believe there's seed in here tonight I may not be one of them I live like I am and I'll be in a Rapture whether it's on this side of the Grave or the other side of the Grave it makes no difference to me sir but if I'm predestinated to that then that becomes the fruit of my seed there was seed that was planted for justification there was seed that was planted for sanctification there was seed that was planted for the restoration of the gifts and anybody that was a seed that was planted for the restor of the gift they're going to continually return back to that but if you're planted for the Rapture amen then your seed is going to start pulling for the Rapture now I'm not I'm not the first poll brother Ram said it was taking of the hand and we understood that that was attracting the people right the second he began to discern the thoughts in tense of the heart you know a lot of people that were happy with the taking of the hand cuz that was a carnal yeah manifestation they could understand that but when it went to him telling people they're thinking and then that became spiritualism to them they didn't they weren't moved by that in fact they walked away from it and yet there was another group of people that embraced it but finally came right was the word right that's that the first pull and then the second pull and we know those were signs well eventually the word had to come that followed the sign and the prophet of God said that word was the third pull it was pulling but the third pull didn't stop when our messenger left the scene right because a lot of you weren't even in the message but the message got to you didn't it and and to use the word the messenger used you conceived the word or the seed in you came to life because it it was brought to life by the word now so part of the third pole is the seed that was predestinated in you drawing the word of God to you and the word of God drawing the seed to itself that's right so if I could say this the third pull is actually in action this evening that's right there's a pull or a draw now so uh and we we know and we talked about filtering everything out that comes into you except what the purpose of that seed is we won't go into that this evening but if the rapturing seed is drawing and pulling and calling you've noticed it in your life all of a sudden there's things in your life you you don't want in your life anymore why the tree is pruning itself it's happening contrary to your flesh even right is the spirit of God moving in you bringing you under conviction causing you to to walk away from things not partaking things you just uh you don't have a taste for it anymore right thinking man's filter you're going to start filtering it out you don't have a taste in it why because there's a seed in you that draw to the Fulfillment of the prophesied word concerning it and the seed itself start changing the atmosphere both in and on the outside first of all you can't stand sin I used to like this you know I really like to listen to this I like to listen to this you know all of a sudden the the best voice in the world just don't sound the same to you the lyrics that moved you all of a sudden sound stupid just to think we used to walk down the street singing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah really somebody checked my brain the seed no longer loves that it's got a new voice it's got a new call if I could say it this way it's got a new set of Senses now this seed that's in you is on the move it starts changing your atmosphere starts changing it's starting to move to that condition that it can come forth now here we're entering the draw of the seed to the Rapture Israel's got to get in its Homeland starts to we see it there all of a sudden you say what in the world caused those people to go into Israel and to start slaughtering them in the most Unthinkable ways imaginable if we were all adults here I would start telling you some of the atrocities but they give me nightmares you say what's causing that the seed the world's got to get in the condition it's changing the outside it's changing the for face of politics it's changing the face of Israel you don't think there's people in Israel right now that on their knees asking God why that's right you don't think there's Hungry Heart screaming out you don't think there's The Holy Spirits over there starting to move on those people you say well no they they can't help it if that seed is in them then they're going to have a season and God will do whatever he takes to make that seed to start to pursue his journey now I just wonder if there's people in Israel that are called to be a part of that group or there parents or their children might be even though they may not be here the seed that's in them because it was in your father it was in your grandfather I wonder if that seed isn't start making the move so it's going to change the condition so that seed can be brought forth that's right that's what's going on that's going on because there's a Rapture that's going on because there Souls called in Israel that's going on so you can put on isav and see it ought to be the most important thing in your life right now is what does the word say do we have lowering Skies do we have wars and rumors of wars earthquakes in diverse places Israel's gathering in their Homeland do you know Israel right now is more united than they've ever been do you know they had political factions in Israel just as divided as Democrats and Republicans that's right Hardline Jews stay with the law stay with Israel liberal Jews let's open our borders let's do all this you think there's anybody separated could you imagine if someone came in here and took our loved ones took our children do you think I'd be going over here do you believe in the third pool do you believe this you do believe that uhuh are you a brother my children will you plow take your sword your plow and beat it into a sword and follow me no there' be no division there would be Unity do you understand what's going on right now is one of the signs the uniting time and sign cuz the seed's got to unite with the word that seed in Israel predestinated it's got to unite with the message that God has for him and look at us we're going to still miss communion we're going to still miss foot washing we're not going to come back to evening Services we're not going to sacrifice Wednesday night and I'm not talking about emergencies and things like that I'm talking about when it's just plain a harder choice if you can't make this squeeze you're never going to make the next squeeze I just want to ask tonight are we looking a far off can you see what's happening now around you and can't you understand they're starting to squeeze you they're starting to it's in your face what they want to teach your kids in your face no respect for God in your faith you're getting squeezed whether you realize it or not I just pray tonight we can look a far off and we can recognize what's transpiring and we'll make contact with the seed in us that's drawing us cuz that seed will draw if you're elected and it will start changing your life so don't be dismayed at the pull that's coming in you thinking not strange at the fiery darts of the enemy that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold we're really at a time church I don't think it's a political war at all I think it's the beginning of the greatest spiritual battle that the bride ever been in the seed in you is what's controlling the world around you the seed wants to leave and it'll make your life where you don't want to stay in it no those that love the world and the things of the world the love of God isn't even in them John said the messages having a great hour we're building bigger churches bigger congregations all over the country but that's no sign never was was a sign to the bride Israel was always one of our signs the desire of the believer and a hungering for truth and righteousness was the other sign and then we had the sign of Malachi 4:5 which told us these things were coming so I just say to you individually in the light of everything that's transpiring all around us in the world in politics and finance I noticed that today advertisement after advertisement buy B buy gold they're trying to get your cash buy gold Buy gold they'll make gold worthless you got this voice over here saying buy gold wasn't

nakedness doesn't appear that's what we want that's what we want to stop church and look AAR off and make sure young people high school grade school every time you're presented with something you take
