Description:
The Death of Pride & The Victory of Humility
Br. Matthew McGeary
Sunday Evening Service: October 4,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

there's nothing like the presence amen i kind of handicapped myself a little bit i guess by not uh using the uh mic i'm used to so i'll hold this instead but if we all want to turn in our bibles to proverbs i don't know if the pulpit mike will be sufficient brothers or do i need to hold this one wonderful be reading out of proverbs 22. man it's just good to be in the house of the lord especially on a communion service now let's just uh read proverbs 22 verse 4 but maybe we'll just read starting with verse one a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold the rich and the poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished by humility and fear of the lord our riches and honor and life heavenly father we just approach you as we've read your word lord just surrendering ourselves to you that you might come and have the preeminence and the service or that you'd speak to your people pray that you would impart revelation lord and may you just anoint the speaker and the hearer in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated i mean just in in reading uh proverbs 22 verse 4 says by humility and fear of the lord our riches and honor and life and you know especially in the day and age we're living in if you were to ask somebody how do i obtain rich's honor in life i imagine this probably wouldn't be in a thousand answers how can i how can i obtain riches and how can i obtain honor and how can i obtain life well for the believer having the word of god we know that the way we obtain rich's honor in life is by humility and fear of the lord the prophet says and how can i overcome he says i've had the privilege of getting meeting some great men and it's these guys that got a change of clothes and 50 cents in their pocket to rattle that's the guy that thinks he's something when he's nothing but i stood by great men i mean great men with ragged sleeve cuffs they make you think you're the great person see greatness is humility don't forget that church greatness is expressed in humility not how fine you can be i don't mean dirty now i mean humble in spirit see i don't mean just get out and don't ever wash and clean up that you should do you know that see but i'm talking about humility genuine humility not something is put on something that is that's a real humility jesus told us how to do it he overcome means overcome means to stand the test that's right like all the old saints did like jesus did amidst of all his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being the messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself why by the word you destroy this temple and i'll raise it up in three days the word said so see and in the presence of death he defeated it he overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the grave he overcame the grave why all by the word and humility oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example see he defeated everything overcome it and philippians 2 8 says and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every name should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth all by what all by the word and humility there's the real man that that's the one to make our example and just in something that's on my heart in in reading this you know i believe that it's it's every uh believer's desire that we want to climb into higher heights and jesus christ and and when we read the message and we read the word of god there's there's a great hunger for us to manifest the things that have been spoken of the bride and and there's a longing as our pastors been speaking on the attributes of god and and the stature of a perfect man oh something in us just longs that we would manifest all of these attributes just according to what would please the lord you know and jesus said for whosoever exalteth himself he shall be a base but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and just in and maybe in reading these things i i'd like to just speak to you this night maybe just not taking much time but i thought maybe this would go well with the communion service but i want to speak for a little bit about the death of pride and the victory of humility may we just uh read a few quotes and scriptures and and if if maybe we can take this with us uh into the week and into our lives and reflect on these things and and and really uh uh have a a something start to transform in our lives that would bring this type of humility into manifestation because the prophet now look when the prophet speaks something understand that this was more than a prophet this was god speaking and so when he says that he overcame by the word and humility that that's not a catchy phrase but there's a truth and a revelation that we can catch in it that will give us the victory he says so just in in reading that word humility it's it's a freedom from pride or arrogance that's maybe something out of the webster dictionary uh humility is freedom from pride or arrogance now we just we just think of the the humility of being an attribute of god my when when he could have come any way he wanted to the earth but he chose a manger he chose the most simple uh uh a way in humility that he could come so vulnerable uh in a babe in a way that all men have come uh not making himself a a greater coming in some uh a form that that it's unobtainable but he came in and liked fashion as we and he made himself humble and even humbled himself even unto death brother branham said he dwells in humility in your heart he comes in humility in the form of meekness and gentleness and i like this uh uh quote here they titled the sermon humble thyself and it's just a short excerpt where brother branham i believe he speaks before brother level and out of humble thyself in 63 it says now we look at this watch to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other will never know the correct time is that right he's speaking of an old-fashioned wrist watch some some folks now maybe have never even seen an old-fashioned wristwatch but all the the design in there and all the springs and the little gadgets and everything if one of them gets out of balance or or the spraying ain't just right it'll never tell the correct time but you know when it when it's when a a master watchman has crafted a watch and put it together oh it's just right on time but but if something gets out of cater it won't work quite right and the prophet says and that takes all of us all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for god coordination with every one of us together to humble ourselves before god and confess our wrongs and pray and believe god for these things all of us together look we're all part of a body right we've all been birthed into the body of jesus christ and and we're all members in particular we all have a specific job to do that we've been predestinated to uh the eye can't look at the foot and say i don't have no need of you and the prophet is laying this out saying oh it takes all of us together so we all have a personal responsibility to play he says if we want the third pool really do something how many how many wants to see the third pool in action how many is longing for the things that he spoke of i believe it's a look away to jesus and and december uh 29th in 1963 he goes i now know what the third pool is and what it does we we know what the third pool has done it's bringing man back into his rightful position once again everything that adam had lost that we might come into dominion over the earth once again and we saw a first one coming to that maturity with the power of the spoken word and able to speak to the storms able to call life back all of those things that i believe are the bride of something in her heart is longing and knowing that all of these things that we've heard and we've seen demonstrated it's something that belongs to us and how are these things going to come into manifestation uh uh god is speaking to our heart and he's saying if you want to see the third pool really do something for god oh it's going to take all of us together to humble ourselves oh my i thought it would be been some big demonstration i thought we'd have to uh maybe get into some big rally and some big special special meeting and get all uh worked up into a frenzy in mind just get things all swelling around but always says to humble ourselves before god and confess our wrongs and pray and believe god for these things you know as i read that just to jump out of this uh quote for a moment just thinking about the body and all of us together you know it's so easy uh uh to be carnally minded about the body of god and and how we esteem one another and you you hold one another and and things become common but you know paul said in first corinthians 12 23 he said in those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant commonness for our comely parts have no need and when you look into uh uh uh the definition or what um comely means it it means a deformed or or the part that has a need and so i love how god in his his mind would come and say for our calmly parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacked so am i how many times does the devil try to come and beat you down and make you feel like you're so needy well the word comes right and says hey i'm i'm bestowing more abundant honor upon you i love how the mind of god speaks oh if you think if you think you're the greatest where you're the least and if you're the least well you're the greatest uh why because we're all a body there's no big eyes there's no uh little use we all need one another to go in a rapture together look we're coming into rapturing condition and what did the prophet say when that last one comes in and that last one might be sitting right here in this church they're coming in is it coming into the church building what is the coming into coming in is catching the revelation of who you are in jesus christ and when that happens when the bride recognizes who she is that she can do the greater works and she recognizes those two spirits working in the framework of the church oh she'll stand like a mighty invincible army all but it takes all of us together oh and how does that happen my we gotta humble ourselves we gotta confess our faults and our wrongs together we need to pray oh i i think this is a wonderful word as we would approach communion maybe something in our heart would just even uh allow communion to to have a greater meaning to us it's not a ritual but it's an ordinance that god has given to us oh and it's an honor to know the truth and it's an honor to take communion it's an honor to wash the feet of the brothers and sisters why because our lord and our savior he humbled himself made himself a what would be called a foot wash flunky but but don't as we move along don't mistake humility for a a maybe a a negative weakness or a humility that's vulnerable to the devil but i'm talking about a godly humility something that is a very attribute and part of the mind of god for our crumbly parents have no need but god have tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacked that there should be no schisms in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another the same care one for another do we all have that type of love do we have the same care for one another well maybe i could be a little honest to maybe help this uh uh be a little bit more clear about how that how how god dealt with my heart one time but you know a brother uh you know was in need of something i can't remember coming into town and and was asking uh maybe for a ride or for something and and i was in a place to where it was going to be a little bit more burden to me to do it and i started to maybe think of other options but the lord spoke to my heart and goes well if that was brother so-and-so you know what i said yes lord i drop everything i'm doing i said god forgive me i realize i let pride i realized lord i there's something in me that needs to change when when i would treat one of your elected and chosen look i'm bearing my heart to you let's be honest with ourselves tonight look there's certain ones of the body that when they come asking uh we're more willing oh why because we're bestowing our own abundant honor upon them when the word says but that members should have the same care for one another oh this is the love that capstone love that we got to come into where it's a godly love that we we no matter who the brother and sister is oh there's such a love of god that there's no preferences and and there's no esteeming a greater honor to this man than that man but we'll love him just the same as christ loved every single one of us that's the love that's the agape love that's moving into the bride to bring us into higher heights oh but it takes a death to pride and it takes a victory of humility and i pray that what god has laid on my heart if something that could could be conveyed and and you could catch the revelation of the true victory of humility because in that victory of humility all it's not a burden anymore you know people want power and really they don't know what power is they really don't know what goes with it the way up is down always if you want power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have bent over to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ to humble yourself before him that's real power you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogant church just a sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and power of god that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before god and letting god just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise but you know i find that that's a lot of times what pride was it's a lot of times what the human nature wants is is a little bit of recognition maybe a little bit of of of of hey pat on the back uh good job i i'm proud of you guys i thought about it you know pride wants to be the quarterback pride wants to be the one with the ball uh pride always uh you know uh uh well you know he can do it but i can do it too but the prophet even starts talking about uh uh about being a team and being a body is that it's like a football game he said you know look everybody can't have the ball every everybody can't run with the ball he said the problem is we're all trying to take the ball from one another he says some of us need to block some of us need to get on our knees and pray some of us need to give a word of testimony some of us need to encourage a brother some of us need to reach out to those brothers and sisters that we don't see sitting in the pews oh some of us we got to become team players you know we're trying to build a church here you know and i think my if could you imagine if we all we all wanted to give our two cents it'd be a funny looking church no brother david i think this should be here and i think this should be here and i think it should be this big and i think it should be that that tall and then oh you know what you know what pry does when when when uh let's just use building the church as an example but this just applies to a litany of things in our life but oh when your expertise isn't drawn from or your specific skill set or or your gift that god has given you in the call that he's placed in your life when it's not utilized oh you get offended why because you're equipped and you're able and i've been called for the job lord that's why i'm here and they didn't even they didn't even come to me and asked my advice well i'm sorry you don't got the ball but you can do something who's in charge here god's in charge the holy ghost is in charge and you know what happens when we start questioning the leadership of the holy ghost we become a dathan or korra oh my goodness you know these brothers they're taking too much upon themselves i i think i need to give them a little bit of advice on how they should do things watch out nathan and cora you might be running right into the very will of god that he's orchestrating for the body but maybe maybe we got to humble ourselves maybe we ought to pray maybe we ought to start finding out well lord if i'm not going to be the one carrying the ball how can i properly how can i properly block what's the part that i can play look if we're all fighting amongst ourselves we're not going to score a touchdown we're going to go in a rapture but i want to go in the rapture a whole lot sooner if we're all bickering and fighting and there's schisms in the church and everything's messed up god's god's going to let things get uncomfortable until we all get on our face and seek god and get in one mind in one accord and one unity but all that what does the scripture say paul goes on to say look if one suffers we all suffer but if one rejoice we all rejoice oh isn't that right look when the running back runs in and scores a touchdown everybody's celebrating the blockers are celebrating the wide receivers are celebrating the quarterback oh the coach on the sideline the defense wasn't even on the field and they're celebrating why because we're a body oh oh let's let's get to a place where we're so sold out so surrender to god where there's such a humility in us that when the ball is given to a brother or sister we're we're so happy for him so you know what praise god lord i'm so glad you're using that brother i'm so glad you gave that sister an opportunity well i've been cleaning the church for 20 years and no one ever gave me a dollar for it and now some so i don't know where i'm going now some sister's cleaning it making money and all of us you ought to say you know what praise god he's doing that for that sister i don't know where that came from but but we got to take that uh into every avenue into our life and not let pride or bitterness spring up in us where we start to fight against the body oh if we can have a humility we see people blessed and we see people prosper we see people get things that you want oh if any humility and when i'm talking about true humility it's a true happiness and pleasure to exalt your brother where it actually becomes a joy and something that's a part of you that you like to see them succeed even in your place i just thought about it you know as you're raising your children and and uh for a few years you can outrun them you know and oh you want to race and sure enough you let them win and they're all proud of themselves right well that's because they're your child uh you're you're you're allowing that but oh get a competitive bone in you let it be a brother or something like they believe i'm going to do everything in my power unless i give even and i kill myself but that's that's a love maybe i'm speaking of as just a father mother raising a child that you would just you just want them to experience that joy you'd want him to have that type of fun oh think of how much more in the the agape love of god that if we can let that capstone be settled down upon us with the statue of a perfect man and that type of humility when we could look upon our brothers and sisters and be so happy for them for the work of god that he's doing in their life and start taking care of one another and for the ones that are suffering and for the ones that have burdens you know we we we develop friendships and we maybe have our little circles in the church and the brothers and sisters we fellowship with more often and while summer in prayer and some are in great need seeking god because of the great trial in their life we're a little bit more disconnected and we're in another place and we're more joyous and we're more happy but all if if we could just start coming into a greater unity church start coming into a love and looking upon the needs of one another philippians says chapter 2 verse 3 says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves i'm not talking about now we're not talking about a false humility one that deceives or one that's trying to check the box that i'm humble i never forget one time my brother uh paid me a compliment and i said you know i that that thank you so much that really means a lot coming from you and this reply is well i know like so does that take away the compliment so you know it means a lot to me so you gave me the compliment because you knew it meant a lot to me but you really didn't feel that way and if i was to give my opinion there which i won't i could just say this it seems there maybe could have been a deeper sincerity there could have been a greater humility and that's what we don't want to have is a false humility a put on where the very things that i'm talking about you're trying to manufacture it it'll never work it'll start to breed bitterness and i was i was thinking about that you know where we're using football as the example where all of a sudden the guy running with the ball you just wish he'd fumble i need this guy to fumble or trip or drop a few catches so i can get in the game well that might that might sound like it's in a church setting but we got to take that into our lives and into our family and into our workplaces and have such a humility where we're esteeming those that we come in contact with and we're esteeming our brothers and our sisters greater than we are and then when you come into that place of love and humility there's such an easy ability just to to do the the compliment and support and the lifting up and the praying one for another because there's something genuine in your heart the prophet says and influence the thing of it is people my brother sister and friends is to be conscious of your littleness see don't be conscious of how big you are be conscious in how little you are you're small we're all that way god can do without us but we can't do without him see we can't do without him but he can do without us god is only trying to find one person he can get his hands he has always tried to do that you notice all down through the bible when he found in isaiah when he found a jeremiah then he found a samson you know one day but samson gave his strength to god but he gave his heart to delilah you've got to give your all to god your reverence your respect your everything that you are just be nothing just see how little you are and that's what god wants us to do and that's real humility that's the way these seraphims are in his presence you see with their faces in reverence covered their feet in humility now thirdly they could fly they they had two wings that put them in action god has shown his prophet here what kind of servant he has prepared humble and in action see that's a real servant of god these who look upon him he was looking upon he was looking upon hezekiah that got lifted up and fell by pride but a servant we all know the story of hezekiah he was a king and he he got lifted up by pride and thought that he could go in and and offer up incense and take over the office of the priest he got lifted up in his heart and god punished him for that but a servant his servant is before him is reverent humble and in action his servants that's the way they should be dressed dressed in reverence humility and constantly about the father's business yes sir reverent humble and in action lord i want to be reverent humble and an action i need a greater revelation of what that means reverend humble and inaction and if you've obtained it give me a call let me know how i can do better i believe that this is a very attributing characteristic that god is wanting to impart and to the bride first peter 5 5 says likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be close with humility for god resist resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble we're speaking about the death of pride speaking about the victory of humility and that's what i was saying i'm not talking about some pushover i'm not talking about you going into the the workplace and and and maybe in your family or with your boss and where they're always running you down and and maybe they're always speaking against the lord and and and you're just i'm just going to take the back seat i'm just no no we're talking about humility with our brothers and sisters in christ but there comes a time where even in that humility you can be pressed and i believe it's your god-given right that you stand up for what you believe that reminds me of the story of miss weber uh uh she she's an old saint that went to uh brother branham's church he he gives an account of this and digging the valley full of ditches i believe it's in 1950 and he talks about ole miss weber and the the angel the lord came to brother branham and said hey go call a brother webber and let him know that sister webber's crossing over she was laid up in the hospital a real gallant saint of god i believe he he refers to i believe it's the same miss weber that he tells the story about what time he got a little bit of in need and and brother branham didn't know how he's gonna pay the bills you know and he said well you know what i gotta i gotta pay the bills i i know everybody else does it i've never done it but i think i'll i'll take up an offering this morning an old brother got it his little hat started walking over he looked over there and saw a little miss weber there getting into her apron there and trying to dig out a little bit of a nickel and he's when he saw that something his heart said i'm just kidding you oh he couldn't do it he tells the story how uh somebody gave him a bike and he painted it and he sold it for what he had need of oh god always provides but now this miss weber she's laid up in the hospital and she's dying and the angel lord now has come to the prophet and said uh she she she's crossing over go get go get mr weber and tell the family so brother branham goes over there and uh to mr webber says you know the lord came to me and your wife you know and uh is gonna gonna cross over it's gonna be you and the four four kids i believe it is four or five kids uh to make ready and make preparations and one of the girls i believe was older and and brother branham had a conversation uh uh with her about uh her mom crossing over and so brother branham uh i went back home and he delivered the message from the from the lord and and you know about two days later uh some of the girls from work went up to the hospital where miss weber worked and they came in there to visit her and they got to talking and she said you know if i could get brother branham to pray for me once more i could come out of here and they said oh you and you and matt branham and that gospel there's nothing to that you know and they started to speak against the very thing that she was standing for and she said you know i just i wasn't gonna stand for that and she started to tell him look god it looks like god's gonna take me home here in a couple days and it looks like i'm going to die by a sickness but i want to tell you something i've seen it all my life and i've seen the hand of god in the prophet's life and it's thus saith the lord and it's true and it's never failed one time and he started to tell those two work girls her convictions and what she stood for while laying on her deathbed and some of us and all of our strength and all of our health won't even take the time to testify to a co-worker oh because we're putting our our pride and we're putting uh all we're counting on our ability and we're counting on our job for our stability in our welfare when our welfare should be standing upon the promised word of god heavens and earth will pass away but his world will never pass away there on her deathbed she she spoke her testimony that she believed in god and that he was a healer and that he could take her out of that bed or we could run with that a little bit just like the hebrew children oh if he delivers us praise god if he don't but he's still the same yesterday today and forever well i believe a day went by there brother branham says it was about three o'clock in the morning and here come the angel of the lord walking through the door he said i want to tell you so miss weber will be sitting in church tomorrow she's going to be sitting back up in the right oh she was dying but she wanted to go to the house of god one more time he said i want you to tell her tell her that she's not going to die i said and i want to tell you that there at the hospital the other day when she was speaking about me the angel lord happened to hear what she said and said because of that she will not die or the prophet goes to say there she is sitting in the tabernacle and that's been eight years ago oh god is listening to your words you keep standing upon the promised word you have a testimony yes we're called to have humility yes we're called to be humble but with a boldness and humility in god we can stand upon the promised word and you speak the truth as our pastor was mentioning this morning you know we can't serve god and mammon you'll serve one or the other and i just i can echo the same thing or pastor said i've got to get all the world out of me all of it i believe that's the lord speaking to us saying we can all say amen lord take all the dross take all the unbelief lord take it all out of me all the things that are of you lord i want you to take it all lord i surrender it to you lord maybe you and you alone in your word only living in me first john 2 16 says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world i just want to read that out of the amplified it says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh craving for central gratification and the lust of the eyes greedy longings of the mind and the pride of life assurance and one's own resources or in the stability of earthly things now we might real not not realize how much the pride of life is truly affecting the believer assurance in one's own resources i remember when you know god bless me oh i couldn't even count the ways but i remember that just living at home with my parents and and i as i say this is a public testimony god's blessed me with a very nice house but i would never be in there if i wasn't able to live rent free for three years with my parents nothing that i did a love of a mom and dad and a love of god that provided me an opportunity nothing that i did but i remember there and and them gracious to give space for me my wife and my two kids and and you know what when you don't have no rent and then pack in the refrigerator you can save some money can you imagine not having any living expenses and all of a sudden that bank account you know i started i started seeing numbers i'd never seen before and all of a sudden you know you kind of felt good you had a little nest tag and all i said i was like wait a second no that means that could go to zero tomorrow don't start putting your trust in some 401k or some bank account or some insurance plan or some career you got because it could be gone tomorrow oh the stock market could crash and that thing could be gone that business could go bankrupt some other corporation can acquire your corporation and say we're changing the staff oh you better watch out oh the pride of life assurance and one's own resources or stability of earthly things i remember when we finally got into the house you know we we took the little money we had saved and were able to you know put it all towards the house and and i remember we came in and said well honey we're broke again but praise god we've got a nice house but you know if we ever start to let the pride of life consume us we're we're we're making a god out of it and he becomes the second or the third place just to reiterate that again assurance in one's own resources or in the stability of earthly things these do not come from the father but are from the world itself oh it can it can get real uh easy to get comfortable here in lady osea the scripture says love not the world love not the world and the things of the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him now now when it says love not the world you can't love the world with and that's not the agape love it's talking about but when you look at this love it even means to welcome to entertain or to be fond of or if i can maybe even say it like this tolerate the things of the world my i think a lot of times we get into a place in lady oseal where we tolerate the things of the world but paul said abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good just moving to a close uh quickly proverbs 8 13 says the fear of the lord is to hate evil to hate pride to hate arrogancy to hate the evil way it says the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and a forward mouth do i hate all right i say god help us to possess these vessels with sanctification and honor and do as paul said i die daily oh we must die daily and maybe pride isn't what you struggle with maybe it's a complex but you know complex complexes are a serious thing uh can cause just uh equal damage if you might say where a complex can keep you out of the house of god it can keep you out of fellowship it could even keep you from from listening to your bible and and reading the word because something in you feels like oh you're not getting the things you want and so it creates this this inability for you to feed because you're you're discouraged because you feel like things aren't opening up to you well complexes are great we got to be careful of complexes as we were going through some fellowship with the brothers the prophet talks about how he built a complex and he was losing a feeling for the people and in standing in the gap he makes the confession he goes could you imagine could you imagine a blind man going to walk over a cliff and die and not say anything about it and the prophet says i i have to make a confession that's what i was fixing to do because he had lost the feeling for people in a complex because the rejection over and over of the word had gotten to a place where he just he just wanted to slip up in the mountains is that if the lord calls me down that then i'll come but but god so graciously uh dealt with with the prophet's heart and he realized he had to have a change to to get the feeling and the love back for the people and god was so gracious to that that message standing in the gap god dealt with his heart and gave him an everlasting sign there in the mountains as you can look into that but all complexes but you know pride will make you do things you shouldn't do like hezekiah and you know pride will make you do things that you shouldn't do and this kind of might sound really odd it might strike you really funny but but my pants used to hold me accountable i love dead silence but you know my pants they would hold me accountable because i'm a certain size you know and when all sudden my clothes don't fit me like they should anymore it's a reminder to me that i need to get in shape or i need to discipline myself does anybody know what i'm talking about my i'm not alone well you know when i started thinking about it some things happened in this lady ocean age where they came up with a stretchy pant you know and and and everybody wants to be comfortable you know lady oc is all about comfort you know and all of a sudden i realize i'm wearing those ones they got a little bit more stretching a little bit more often because a little bit more comfortable but someday along the line there's going to come a rude awakening if you keep carrying on undisciplined and wearing your stretchy pants wearing your religious pets [Music] all because what did they start doing to the denim they started to sew in something called spandex they started putting in a little like elasticity and i think maybe that's a little bit of what we've been doing with the good old gospel robe that he's given us we've been starting to weave in a little pride been starting to leave we even a little elasticity so we can do the things that we want to do and we realize that we're lusting and gorging on the things of the world and you realize you ain't going to fit the good old gospel robe that way because you've got a little bit comfortable and ladies here you've started to weave in a little bit of pride you've started to weave a little into off complexes and then all of a sudden when you stand on the on the scales of god's word you realize you're out of shape yeah i've been there also and i realized my stretchy pants don't even fit anymore oh we get backslid why because we're feeding on the things we shouldn't feed on but at least my old school pants that they didn't know how to compromise they were one size not one size fits all but now the world's preaching a one-size-fits-all gospel but there's only one gospel and it only fits one size and that's the true genuine believer and if it ain't in the word i don't want it but don't try to modify your wedding garment i'm going to take my wedding garment down to the tailor and i'm going to weave in a little of this website a little of this entertainment and i can go there and i can go here shame on us let's get back to the old-fashioned gospel i don't want to make the word fit me i want to fit the word pants watch out for those things and watch out for pride and complexes and the pride of life because you'll find yourself backslidden spiritually praise the lord maybe just a move towards a close speaking about getting comfortable you know israel got comfortable down in egypt but there rose up a pharaoh that didn't know joseph but as long as there was a pharaoh that respected god's people they were comfortable they were living off the land but you know there came a time where there rose up a pharaoh that didn't know joseph and didn't know the power of god and god started to harden pharaoh's heart and that's when exodus 1 12 it says speaks of how god started to harden pharaoh's heart and they started to get fearful and worried about the children of of god whether they would maybe uh join themselves with an enemy or if they would become too great so they started to afflict them and put task masters upon them and give them burdens and you know what the the children of god started to get uncomfortable in ladies i mean in egypt they started to get a little uncomfortable and then in verse 12 it says but the more they afflicted him the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of israel that word grieving means it's to be grieved or loathed to abhor oh they had a sickening dread of the children of god and the prophet says why why did god have to harden pharaoh's heart to put the people back in the promised land before he could bless them to bring the messiah to them he says that's what he had to do with with with hitler's heart to be against the jew when he was half jew himself how could he have to do that to stalin mussolini see people that's not inspired like a nation they god has to take the things that they are living by the laws of the land many times to make his promises come true so he had to harden those dictators hearts to run the jew back to the promised land it had to be that way you think the condition of the age that we're living in is any coincidence you think the laws of the land and the things that are shaping up and the loathsome abhorrence for the word of god is any coincidence no it has to be that way the word said in the last days it'll be perilous times oh but we're going to overcome them uh just like he overcame and how how did christ overcome just in the very outset we were saying all by the word and humility the scripture says moses was the meekest man in the earth he was humble he was lowly but what i love about it was in that weakness in that humility that god told him to go take over egypt and make this in humility moses go on and take over let's just all stand it'll help me close go on and and take over what what would what would an old man in a stick be to pharaoh's army prophet says speaking of this he said moses had the word pharaoh had spears pharaoh had the pride of life he could count on his resources he could count on his bank account he could count on his great civilization that he had he had aspired to but moses had something greater than all of that he had thus saith the lord oh hallelujah the prophet said in proving his word that's all he needed was the word that's all you need today it's not a credential from some church you don't need a denomination to back you up you need the word to take the rapture you don't need some credential you don't need some long history of some school to be healed this morning you need to accept the word that does it you don't need the doctor's word if the doctor says he's done all he can do that's all he can do he says you got cancer tumor you're going blind you're deaf dumb whatever it is that doesn't matter if you could take that word to that burning promise of the bush yonder amen something's going to happen oh what was that burning bush yonder it was the pillar of fire it was the angel of the covenant i want to ask you where is the pillar of fire where is the angel of the covenant he didn't leave he's not off the scene where is he oh i wanted what did god tell joshua he said as i was with moses so shall i be with you joshua being a type of the holy ghost oh what did jesus tell us yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because i'll be with you i'll be even in you at that day oh the prophet said this day when the revelation comes forth you will know that i am in the father the father in me and i in you oh thank god we have the word the power the coveted angel that pillar of fire it hasn't left us we just need to submit ourselves and humility and fear of the lord where we find riches honor and life church we're going back to where we came from we came from god we're going back to god and the prophet said if you want to see the third pool really do something for god let's all humble ourselves let's confess our faults let's pray and seek god amen well you have your bibles let's just open our bibles into corinthians the 13th chapter and and well the brothers would go prayer for communion scripture just coming on my heart as matthew was speaking you know the lord said they'll know you're my disciples by your love one for another he could have given a lot of different descriptions huh they know you are my disciples because you raised the dead they know you are my disciples because of this because of that but he said you'll know that you are my disciple or in other words a disciple somebody that patterns their life after that person he said you'll know they are my disciples by your love one for another it's nice to have brother manuel ruth correa with us tonight they're uh they're headed back to phoenix to help their family that's in some situations at this time and and uh so they won't be with us for a while but they're going to go back and and to there so we definitely want to tell them how much we've appreciated the three years that they've been here with us and he's cut my hair and taking care of me and it's been a blessing so either i'm going to grow my hair long and my beard longer he's going to have to come out and take care of me but anyway so we're grateful for all that they've contributed and helped us here and and uh so we hope that all things can be taken care of there soon and they can certainly make it back to be with us let us read here he says i have received the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this duty as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come whosoever wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup this was a good sermon tonight to examine yourself by amen and for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink of damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we could judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come our gracious heavenly father is we come together tonight to partake in communion father the words that our brother matthew spoke to us father reminds us of the humility and and even the humility that you humbled yourself even under the death of the cross that by giving of yourself that we could live and that we could partake of life freely and lord have eternal life and the confidence that we possess life and life's more abundant father in that death has no sting and it has no victory over us but father if we just put off this mortal body we have one waiting for us what a fellowship the believer has father what a care as it was spoken to us tonight that we should have one with another father may as we have communion tonight it's a communion with you heavenly father and it's a communion one with another that our loves would be blended together father we ask you to bless this bread that represents your body which was given father for us that it by its stripes father we were healed and heavenly father we ask you to bless this wine father represents the stimulation of revelation the blood sacrifice that sanctified the world father and bought in our price and paid for the redemption of our sins we ask you to bless this this evening in jesus precious name we pray amen
