know the lord that is the caucus the diet prepared for us lord god and the eagles of god the lord god defeats upon lord true bread lord god that you give us in this day to direct our hearts and our lives lord god in jesus name we pray amen we may be seated uh we're gonna invite brother mike for the up some reading you know it's always a little bit intimidating to read psalm 119 and uh even the possibility that i might read one psalm 119 for our sunday morning psalm probably has some of us gasping just a little bit we're going to look at the first eight verses this morning if you want to go ahead and stand you know as i was looking at these eight verses it occurred to me that the word is mentioned in every single verse in verse one it's his law in verse two it's his testimonies in verse three it's his ways in verse four it's his precepts in verses five and eight it says statutes in verse six it's his commandments and in verse seven it's his judgments each and every one of these phrases is a description of an attribute of the word of god you know his word is his law his word is his testimonies it is his judgments it is his ways every single verse in fact if you read the entirety of psalm 119 almost every single verse with the exception of just a handful mentions his word you know not only does every verse mention his word but every verse here in the first eight mentions david's response to the word or his reaction to the word either some action he performs or some action he desires to perform in relationship with the word you know for example in verse six he says when i have respect to it pay attention to it consider it give it regard look at it four times it says that his desire is to keep it to retain it to hold it to hang on to it to not let it go to believe it twice he describes walking in it having your entire manner of life and your journey be ordered according to the word you know what a prayer you know but notice there's action associated with the word that's the relationship with the word there's one that caught my attention in verse seven it says i will praise thee with uprightness of heart when i shall have learned thy righteous judgments you know and i suppose one could look at that and think it's important you know to learn intellectually the contents of the word to study it as an object of academic study but if you look at that word to learn it's an action it doesn't mean to become knowledgeable but it means to become skilled like a craftsman yes you know any of you that are in the trades or even in a professional career knows that there's a process that somebody goes through to become skilled in that trade in that tool and it involves a number of steps one of it is you know as a as a young person maybe you start by paying attention to it focusing on how it's done looking at where it's used and then then you begin to retain some habits on how different tools might be used or a different job might be performed and then it becomes something that you do every day you keep walking it it becomes the focus of your life and your day and your week and then there becomes a point where you have learned it you're skilled you need no book you need no manual you know when something sounds a little off base you know in something when you've seen this pattern before how this is how you respond one could say it like this as you get to a point where you know what needs to be done what he wants done with the word you know being studious in those situations doesn't necessarily bring any value there's an experience of doing a practice and becoming skilled like a craftsman at no point did david say his action in response to the word was to study it his action was always motion pay attention to it keep it walk in it learn it become skilled in its use jesus said this in matthew 13 52 he said then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed skilled unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old you know an experienced householder or the steward of the house he knows exactly how to arrange things to place things just to suit the occasion or to please his master you know just like a skilled craftsman or a skilled householder there's a there's a promise that there's going to be a people that know what he wants done with his word by practice through continuous paying attention to how he uses the word to learn it you know so i thought as i was reading verse 7 when david says i will praise you with uprightness of heart when i have learned your righteous judgment you know that's certainly my prayer that i would get to a place where i become so skilled in the use of the word that i know what he wants done with it i will praise him when i will have learned his righteous judgments so maybe we'll read the first eight verses of that you know obviously you could spend all kinds of time in psalm 119 but that's just kind of what stuck out to me this morning so let's read that starting in verse 1 blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart they also do no iniquity they walk in his ways thou has commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently o that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes then shall i not be ashamed when i have respect unto all thy commandments i will praise thee with uprightness of heart when i shall have learned thy righteous judgments i will keep thy statutes o forsake me not [Music] [Music] we don't have any announcement let's go straight to the worship [Music] lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music]

it's just a song that's really hit my heart really hard especially during the last few days i've been going through a lot of stuff it's been very rough for me so just like to sing these few verses

[Music] be able to express how great you are [Music] lord though we're uncapable of doing that we we just love to show the world what a wonderful god that you follow we ask you to bless us this morning and help us as we fellowship around your word in the precious and wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you the morning it's certainly nice to be in the house of the lord if you have your bibles i'm going to do something a little bit different thank you musicians for playing thank you brother steve for leading songs for us they and each one that's here we're going to listen to two little portions of from two different tapes so that might be a little different but we have a we have a reason for the things that we want to do i really believe that the lord's trying to open our eyes to see something um and he he had a way in which he opened our eyes and that was by sending a message and a messenger and uh steve and cena and i love your beard brother amen that's greatness my heart's a flame this morning amen praise the lord and so god had a way of doing it and that was to send a messenger and the words those messengers were i sav that we could see so we want we want what we're doing to be anchored in god's planned word because that's where faith final resting place is is the word of god so if we can see this in the message we could see it's what god delivered to us we can take it personally to ourselves as coming from the divine throne of god that it's the word of god then we will begin to understand it can be manifested in us and we'll go over that this morning so let's turn in our bibles to ephesians the second chapter and let's just um start in the fourth verse of the second chapter of ephesians but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved just think you were quickened with them when you were already dead in sin i mean that's how great his love with was he looked right past that that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus so he wanted to show this grace he wanted to show this mercy he wanted to show it to us prove it to us for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast now this is a great scripture here for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus on two good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them father add your blessing to the your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning i'm certainly by no means a a bible scholar at all or uh much of a a preacher as far as preaching goes but i do believe that in my heart it's that the ministry that god's given me is is that of a pastor and and you know what what a shepherd does is he tries to lead his sheep into fields where they can eat you you you you understand that it's already created in the sheep to eat and to take the food of god and turn it in to wool in other words it's the sheep's nature to bear wool and and a shepherd he he doesn't really need to be much he just needs to take the sheep to the field and say here's here's the food eat it and because god made them sheep they will automatically start producing wool or or uh we wouldn't hope that they'd be producing lamb chops but uh but so it it it it it automatically it is something so you have to understand that that my heart's uh desired this morning is to bring you to the things that were spoken today in our age and for the hour that we're living in and to have some sort of expectation and understanding of what god wants for us you you understand he has we all just read that he has mercy and in the ages that come he wanted to show us that merchant he wanted to show us those riches he wanted to show us that kindness that and that were for ordained to to walk in these works and so it's a wonderful thing that he has taken on the responsibility but he also passes a responsibility onto the believer and and our responsibility if we could say it that way is to believe his word that's all that's been allotted to us to do is to believe him we would have all believed him was never a question if it wasn't for the devil and the devil came along and he had a plan and god had a plan and the devil began to speak his plan and he tried to get eve to accept his plan and said no this isn't true and that's not true and we find out that he is a liar he's the father of lies could you imagine having your testimony be there's no truth in you you can't speak the truth you know we have a saying that some people lie when the truth sounds better and and uh so we as we begin to look at our place uh we understand and we we put our our our ourself in the place that that there's there's things that we are for ordained to be a part of and we want to make sure that we catch that understanding because the understanding of the world and the way the world operates is totally different than god's understanding of the world and the way god operates and what man has tried to do is he's tried to come in between there and see if he can mix them together well you can't take hot which is the true word of god and cold which is the devil and mix them together because all you end up with something that's lukewarm and it'll be spilled out of the mouths and and the trying to mix the world and the desires of man and the program of satan with the with the the plan of god and the word of god trying to bring them together to some sort of compromise is what's produced so many different denominations they're they're they're all man's ideas of how to blend the two but the two don't blend they weren't made to blend they weren't made we weren't made to live in the world we're in the world but we're not of the world and and if we could ever bring ourselves in our thinking to the full understanding that god is a hundred percent behind us to live totally by his word and he'll provide all the power all the grace all every substance that we need to live by faith of course the enemy don't believe that but that's what we i want to do we want to grow in our faith so as we we've been talking a little bit and we're going to play 12 minutes this morning out of the message called proving his word and that's the idea that we want to lay down is that god it will prove his word he'll prove it's true so we understand that that the word of god a word is a thought expressed now i've heard people talk i don't think they're expressing any thought they didn't think at all before they spoke but but we know that that's what we are taught and we understand that the word is a thought expressed so a a thought with god if we could say it that way in the beginning was god there he would he dwelt alone but he wanted to have fellowship and he wanted to be god and he wanted to share what his attributes were those things we've been over many times so god in his thinking set forth a plan he was going to create the heavens and earth he was going to make man in the image that man was going to be he was going to have fellowship with this man man he he had the whole vision of what that his plan was set within him so the first thing god had is a thought or a vision he in other words he saw what he was planning to do it it's like the we are talked a lot about the great architecture of michelangelo when he had in his thought in his thinking to make a statue of moses and i've been fortunate enough to see that statue and and i i told you i couldn't help myself when i got there it's it's in the church of the chains in uh in rome and and we went there and it's kind of dark you can't hardly see it but you got to put some money in a little machine and it turns on the lights and we understand that we're being raised a catholic and so at least i didn't have to light a candle and and and so we uh put in and there was that statue you know and i i just you know i just i'm sure every believer that's ever stood in front of that statue yelled at it speak and and that that kind of means uh a lot when i start to look at that great uh message the masterpiece because he said that within his mind it's like an architect he he's got something in his mind and then he goes to build it to to build it and so god wasn't a builder because he didn't he's a creator so we had something in his mind and then he began to create it to create it but he said when the it finally came into the image of what that he had in his mind and he was so inspired to see what that he had thought come into a reality that he he he got so inspired he smoted with the hammer and said speak so the understanding of that was that there's something that was in the vision in god's mind so he had the vision and then he spoke what that that thought was he said let there be light and then there was light and he said let there be he says the first day he did this and the second day he did that and then he separated this and he had this come forth all those things were the thoughts that he already had in his mind then he was speaking them out and and he spoke and told what the vision or what the thought was so when he told what the vision was and what the thought was that became the word because the word was the thought expressed a virgin shall conceive that was his vision and then he spoke it and said a virgin shall conceive so it was his vision that a virgin would conceive before he spoke it then he spoke that of virgin shall conceive and then this is the part and then that is made tangible because the whole plan of god was that god wanted to make the things that he was the vision that he had the word that he spoke he wanted to make it real and make it flesh that's what he wanted to do so when the word comes to pass it's made tangible let there be light well he knew what light was because that was his vision then he spoke it and said let there be light and when it was made flesh it became the interpretation of what that that thought was and it became a reality oh if you could see yourselves because you are the light of the world and this light shined amongst men and it in the beginning was the word and the word was the light of men and it shined in darkness and darkness comprehended it not right but so you you when we begin to see that you are the light of the world amen whoa that means there's something that that what was light light was the word manifested it was the word made tangible so we understand we become the thoughts of god what he had in his mind what he spoke so he said there would be a bride he said there would be an elect lady he said there would be a church without spot or wrinkle somebody that word was predestinated to somebody so i'll just stop here for a moment and i i know that we've got uh you multilingual and and people and i know maybe it's hard for uh some of our members that speak different languages but you can always go back and read it and i hope in the future somehow that we'll be able to uh be able to play it on the screens in in the different languages that it's in but we're gonna we're gonna start here just a just like 12 minutes i guess is all that it is on paragraph 59 of proving his words he says a very odd little text three words that i want to speak from out of this reading you might say that's a very small thing three words out of all you read a portion of two chapters of the bible but i did that for a background to take these three words proving his word so if he had the thought and then he spoke it well he's got to bring it to pass and that that that is got to have something that anchors in because when he comes looking for this lady the select lady when he comes looking for his bride to harvest her and take her and see if she's ripened in the maturity to be brought into the garner of his kingdom he's looking for one thing will there be faith on the earth that's what he's looking for so if we could understand that he's got to prove his word so let's just listen to this 12 minutes and then we will uh go on a little bit then we'll listen to 17 more minutes but this is sunday school this morning we're here to anchor in god's word we're we're here to know what the messenger said take it into our heart and let it build in us and mature us into what that we need to be how many rick thinks the hour is getting late amen it's a lot later than uh it was before so let's just go forward with this uh god richly bless you as we listen to this 12 minutes and then we'll go a little farther thank you a very odd little text three words that i want to speak from out of all this reading you might say that's a very small thing three words out of all that you read a portion of two chapters of the bible but i i did that for a background to take these three words proving his word you know there's a scripture in the bible in first thessalonians 5 21 word is written prove all things hold fast to that which is good when anything is proven it will either be proven right or wrong and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right and then as you find what is right it says hold fast in other words grip it don't turn it loose hold it fast in other words hold it tight so that it will not slip hold fast to that which is good after it's been proven right and anything that's proven not right then turn it loose as quick as you can get away from it don't never hold on to the wrong thing now it is possible that staunch christians find people uh hold sometimes hold to the wrong thing thinking it is right but then these things should be proven whether they are right or wrong and it's the duty of all of us as we are expecting to go to heaven when jesus comes and it's a minister's duty when any question is brought up that he solves this out and then proves it before the people that they might understand because no one wants to be found wrong holding to the wrong thing so we have a scripture and jesus said all scriptures must be uh fulfilled that we should prove all things and then hold fast or hold tight get a death grip on it and don't turn it loose hold fast to that which is good i remember at school i learned something and many of you learned the same lesson when you have solved a problem worked it out you can take the answer and prove it by the problem how many ever did that all of you of course then then you don't have to worry whether your answer is right or not the problems answer has been proved by the problem therefore you know you got the right answer if every one of yours on your slate or sheet has been proven the problem proved by the answer proved by the problem then you've got it no one can say it's wrong you've got to get and if you do your work neatly and correctly and the way it should be done and your answer has been proved you can sit back and rest with the assurance that you're going to get a a on that on that sheet of paper that you turn in because it's been proven proven by the problem now there is also an old proverb it says prove it i'll believe it nah they got a one of our state one of our states in the nation they have a slogan i'm from missouri show me see in other words prove it to me i'm from missouri but this doesn't work always because god has in every age fulfilled and proved the work that he has set out for that age and spoken in his word and every time that god's word has been proven in the age the majority has turned it down so uh prove it and i'll believe it is not so you can only have faith as god gives you faith faith is a gift of god every how religious you may be yet it must take the it might you must have faith and your faith can only rest if you are a christian upon the proven word of god amen i remember god allotted his word to each agent foretold what would happen in this certain age that he was speaking on now if moses would have come with the message of noah it would not work if jesus would have come with moses message it would not have worked or one prophet came with the other prophet's message it not a word but through his prophets he has revealed the entirety of all of himself and his plan therefore the bible cannot be one word added to it or one word taken from it so if you prove your problem by your answer by your problem then why not prove the the answer that we're now getting by the word of this age if the bible speaks that a certain thing is to happen in this age it's in the bible and it will happen then if your answer that you're trying to tell the people if it's proven by the book then it is true it's true otherwise it isn't now we see another then you no doubt have heard them say seeing is believing that's another old proverb we have here but that doesn't work either it doesn't work because man can set and look right straight at anything and they'll not see it the word see the english word c has so many different meanings to it c might mean a body of water c might mean to understand c might mean to look at it and oh there's just all kinds of words you can use but when you say seeing is believing you're mistaken when you understand it you believe it jesus said except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom in other words understand the kingdom because the kingdom is the holy spirit in you so you have to understand what this is in you the only way you'll understand it is compare what it makes you do with what the bible said it would make you do then your problem solved and then he is that holy spirit so seeing is not believing i can prove that but the senses of the body see seeing is not believing i can not see this bottle of oil i could not see it because it's behind me yet i have a sense of a feeling it tells me i've got it in my hand hey i couldn't see it's impossible and now i cannot reach it it's impossible and yet i believe it this seeing is believing this feeling is believing now i'll close my eyes i neither could see it or feel it but if i get it close to could smell it i still believe it's there so faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence not seen taste felt smell or heard you believe it and faith must have a resting place and anything is contrary to the word of god faith in god can have no resting place unless it's a promise of god and there it takes its eternal stand but in the face of all these undoubting ages and things that we have went through and live in today the worst of all in the face of all this doubt god does uh go right on proving his words to be right as he has in every age he unbelief doesn't stop god it doesn't hinder him i don't care how much the world unbelieves it's still going to happen unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemns the unbeliever the unbelief will send the unbeliever to hell it'll rob him of every blessing god promised him but it doesn't hinder god from going right on with the believer unbelief doesn't stop god it only stops the unbeliever you say uh the sun is going to shine tomorrow i'm going to stop it you're trying and all right you can't do it god has set it in order and said it would shine it's going to shine that's all he said it would there might be some clouds in it but it's still shining just the same you can't stop god with that he what how does he make his word known to the people first god knowing that there would be unbelievers now watch the wisdom of god knowing there would be unbelievers and how the majority would be unbelievers he by foreknowledge predestinated a seed forever age that would believe it now if you notice in there for each age uh goes right on with his word everything right on time nothing hinders god he goes right on and every click is moving just exactly right we think sometimes it's not going to work right don't you worry his clock is timed just exactly to the split instant and everything's working just exactly right when i look around sometime and see these rickies and rickettas that we got today and on the streets and however things going on i think oh god wait a minute he says see my timepiece is turning just exactly right i've got to put you up on the same bases i did the first man them days i put you on the same bases of lutheran on the same basis away wesley because you see sin wasn't knowing then like it is now and when we got more knowledge now than we had then and when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it see and now today we've got more knowledge more understanding so the rivers of unbelief is flowing in hard but god raises a standard against it but remember he's always the reason that he he predestinated these things to happen he foretold him by his prophets they would happen and when the righteous see these things confirmed then they know it's right regardless of what anyone else says they know it's right you don't want to stop i mean i don't i don't know what's wrong with me but i just it just keeps opening up that you you know let that soak in okay because he he proves his word in every age and unbelief doesn't stop god so how many of you felt just like brother branham's felt he says i see all these ricketies i see all these kids i go oh god and he says but wait a minute everything's right on time is that right it's just perfectly uh uh perfectly laid out there and he says he says and now today we've got more knowledge no understanding so the rivers of unbelief is flowing hard but god raises up a standard against it now where's the standard that he's raising up you see this is the the thing that is a very delicate razor's edge line that i'm i'm gonna try to express just for this moment here it's so easy for us to look back and say that brother branham was that standard and he was but he was the first fruit amongst many brethren you you understand he wasn't the soul standard he wasn't the soul marker because even that's what the lord was that he might become the first fruit amongst many brethren because so the the he came and and he he wasn't the message he was the messenger the message was the eternal word of god that was in god's thoughts in the beginning but man had perverted god's thoughts so much that god had to raise somebody back that could bring us back to the pure thought of the pure expression of god's word in the beginning not a new word the only thing that made it seemingly like it was a new word is because there wasn't a predestinated seed there to receive it the predestinated seed was there to receive wesley's message or luther's message there was a predestinated seed that was there that received the restoration of the gift but when the seals were opened and the third pull and the mysteries of god and the furtherance of the revelation of the godhead and the plan of god there was a predestinated seed there to receive that that's the standard that he raised up and he says that he says he says he god raised a standard against it see and now today we've got more knowledge more understanding so the rivers of unbelief is flowing in hard but god raised up a standard against it but remember he always the reason he predestinated these things to happen he foreordained them by the prophets they would happen but what did he just say over here he said that by his foreknowledge he predestinates a seed for every age that would believe it now you've noticed in there for each age goes on with his word everything's right on time so you can see he predestinated a seed that predestinated seed is the standard let's let's let's just ask ourselves a little bit are we meeting our obligations are we we meet our are are we recognizing what our call is in life our we don't want to just sit back and be lukewarm and that's what that's what we were preaching is that is that if he's foreordained it for each age then he's he's got something in his plan that's made flesh for each age and so we realized he says so when the word of god is coming to pass and and he spoke that in in the little section that we just listened to when the word of god comes to pass it stirs the elect into action that's what it does i wonder how many people when they saw the and i know it went across the social media platforms and many of the brethren's in many churches uh put it on their uh bulletin board and everything of the comments that the prophet of god made concerning the woman that would rise up in america and that he saw her in a purple uh address i guess is the terminology dressed in in purple now you would think that they read those things but what does she do she goes there she shows up at her inauguration in purple just exactly we we saw we've seen how many things in this last year or so have we seen come to pass that people have posted that that they've they've brought the quotes up about the mask and going in and and the prophet's vision of working with the test tubes and looking up and the man-made all those things that were seen striking the fact that they used the word plague and and all the things that you you would think you would begin to realize that really there's somebody else in control amen if i just want to get under that control don't you that that's a control that i want to get under i want to get under and be a part of what it is that's happening but don't you realize something's happening okay young people you're old enough to wake up and and realize there's something going on here you know i mean i know you've got your jobs i know you go to school all that's fine but don't let it blind you don't let it cover your eyes don't let it you know get eye salve that you can see that that the vision's made clear to you you understand that that you're on a path and things come in your life that are fine you've got to you you make those but when someone comes something comes along is trying to alter your path it forces you in the valley of decision where you've got to make the choice and don't think you're going to get you're going you're not going to be faced with choices that's what he's looking for he's looking he wants to prove his word he's looking for men and women that will make their choice according to what's best for them in the relationship to their god and their future and what they believe is transpiring and so god is going to prove everything he spoke yeah and and when the word starts to come to pass it wakes up and it stirs the elect it's a wake-up call well i remember something about this i mean think of it i remember when i first came into the message we talked about that car that would drive itself i was in a car the other day guy pulled up to a parking spot said watch this he pressed the button and that car packed itself into that parking place i said let me out of this thing they got the gps technology they've got everything you know you know how it is in a car you drive you get too close it goes b b b b b b you know i don't always exactly drive in the center of the lane you know i'm a little swervy in my old age and that thing's going off all the time so how do you turn this thing off but i want you to stop for a moment we used to talk about that it's here it's here but it doesn't shake us does it stir us up does it awaken us well let me tell you something i believe that it's starting to stir the elect because there's people that are starting to make decisions for god they realize i've got to get out of this slump i've got to shake myself i got to get the cobwebs out i i've got to get a clear vision i've got to get back on fire i've got to draw an eye unto god amen now you can do that without emotion and you don't want emotion to be a substitute for the real actions so the real believer starts looking for the promises and the things that are to come to pass when the timepiece goes off you say wait a minute this lady just showed up in a purple dress just exactly the way the prophet of god said it would be yeah and then you go back over and and just the things we've seen the mask this the uh i don't have them i probably should have wrote a list of them but i if not i'll just get sidetracked into all the things that but my point is is that when the believer sees these signs coming they look up because their redemption is drawing not and they ask himself what kind of condition represents that i'm prepared what would a prepared believer be doing what would a prepared believer be thinking what what would be the concerns on the heart of someone that recognized the sign because that's what signs are for signs are directions they're pointing you to something so why would a messenger from god say i saw a vision and i saw them coming i saw a great woman coming into power and i saw her dressed in purple the first woman that this far away from the white house shows up in purple now here's the thing that i kind of chuckle in my heart if i could say it this way everybody says well she's supposed to be beautiful well that's so carnal and fleshly this woman is beautiful to the ungodly to the liberal to the one that doesn't believe a woman should be at home raising children and i'm not against women working others there's times when you have to work the prophet of god said that uh he said that them them women worked so their husbands could get out and preach the gospel there's a balance there's decisions that you make together as husbands and wife there's family decisions that are not me it's not up to me as the pastor to say you can play sports you can't play sports you do that in your family there's family decisions my job's just to preach the word of god to point you to what the prophet of god said then you go listen to it all i can say is here's the field here's the tape you understand here's the quote but i'm not the enforcer of the word of god i can tell you sisters don't wear high heels well you'll have to go through the litany of what's high okay but you know there's a scripture that answers that go to the elder women in the church who are to teach the younger woman you want to know how high high is sister coast my wife but if you want how high high is no i've preached against high heels for 50 years i still get them you understand so what am i going to do put jackson at the back door with a hacksaw come here a moment sister why we'd have a box fuller heals and then it would be well did you cut it too short i don't know you don't but that's not what a believer does the believer sees the signs and they start looking into the word of god for the answer they prove the word by the problem the problems were in ladies we're blind miserable poor wretched and don't know the the problem is it's a moral declare the problem is that they're uniting together against god's word in bedford right here in bedford we've been struggling with the city for two years to get a church built because they didn't know their drainage systems they don't know where their water lines are and this piece of property sat there dormant for all these years and all of a sudden they want to develop it and they don't have answers bedford never had a bar and you had to have 80 percent food sales now it's they don't even enforce it bedford in this year is going to have three liquor stores one's two of them are right on the corner of where you turn down the street from my house the old lubies and the old flood ruckers are now liquor stores you know where the third one is it's in the message church i thought oh you trinitarian devil you you understand what i'm saying in other words this isn't the bedroom community that texas some influences have come in the people have come in what do they want they want bedford is landlocked they want more money so for the love of money the root of evil sets in and now they're selling liquor which is the the moral decay of more young women and men that allow themselves to come under the thing let me say you girls don't you ever let any guy ever talk to you at all about taking a sip of alcohol he's trying to impair you let alone drugs you have to be foolish not to understand that something that imperish your judgment and the way you drive in the way you think thousands of people are killed under the influence because children and mothers have lost their lives because of liquor and our city has become so sick that they vote to put stores in that sell that stuff just face it the spirit's taping fight just remember he said you're the nuts that are holding the world together you're the oddballs you notice the whole spirit i'm sorry i got up on this but you notice the whole spirit of the world today is all conform if you don't if you if you don't agree with somebody you're the oddball guy out you can't even express uh you express anything it's like it snowed the other day so a guy built a snowman the neighbor came across the street says why isn't it a snow woman and then the other person comes and says it's got to be a snow person i mean that's the way people are kidding it's just it it it's lost it but the the elect as they see the day approaching as they see the day of approaching they forsake not the assembling of themselves together we see every sign of the day approaching and the government is stopping believers from assembling together poor in canada they're allowed 25 in one room and 25 in another room they're almost to the point they're just going to pay the fines and get arrested just think of it the the the the unbelief that is increasing but remember unbelief doesn't stop god everything's right on time but the signs wake up the believer for to start looking for the promises and the things that are to come to pass and because they want to find out what part do they play in the fulfillment of the word of god that's what i want to have anchored in a heart the world getting rotten is right on time right and it got a whole purpose god's plan i liked how he he used that and and he used that word uh as we were listening he he used the word he said this he says or one prophet come with the other prophet's message it it would not have worked but through his prophets he has revealed the entirety of all of himself and his plan through the prophets he's revealed the plan so we should be able to look into the prophet's message because modern events are made clear by prophecy and understand and see god's plan then we should be able to look at ourselves and say where am i fitting in god's plan that's right okay what is what is my where am i at and that's why i wanted to look at ephesians he says for we it's not our works not our good doing but by grace we are saved that's election by by nothing that we've done not of ourselves but of his love and his mercy towards us that it might be shown not of works lest we should boast but we say praise god i see i see not the seeing here but i see by revelation i see because my eyes have been opened i've received i sab you've received i says look at yourself yeah i don't deserve it i don't know why i see i don't know why it's so plain to me i don't i don't clean why when i listen to what he says it it permeates my soul and little statements just stand out that are so vivid can i boast no it's by grace this by mercy not in ourselves lest any of us should boast not of good works that not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship that's right we are his vision and made flesh his workmanship is the tangible flesh reality of his word everything he prophesied in jesus all the vision was what he would be me everything that it said how he would die all those things that were seen in this vision that were spoken through the prophets a virgin shall conceive every single one of those who was made tangible and made flesh that was his workmanship nobody else could do that right but him okay we are his workmanship created in christ jesus in other words we were created in the vision we were created in the spoken word that's where we are created that's where we were predestinated undo good works boy that takes in other words it's taken i believe that's all i have to do i believe god sent a prophet i believe he was the messenger i believe he opened the seals i believe this i believe i believe that what about the good works that you as an individual were created in jesus christ to do created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before for ordained or god hath before ordained that we should walk in them there's got to be a walk somewhere right now let's just take a look at ourselves for a moment we all claim to have heard the scream right so we all have claimed to flap our wings out of the chicken yard we place the title upon ourselves as the elected lady the bride of christ that's quite a boast now i pray god that that boast is true you know if something's a hundred percent wool you stick the label on and say it's a hundred percent wool so if we make the claim that we're a hundred percent wool i hope you get the type then that's okay to wear that sticker if you are now if god created you that right predestinated you to that then he's got to prove his word so he's got to be behind you but now let's listen to the next 17 minutes i don't know how late it is but yeah we should be out by a little bit so let's listen to the next 17 minutes that we want to listen to and it's in works is faith expressed so if you believe it is that right so if if we believe something then we've got to it's got to become more of a a reality a reality to us then than just uh leaving it in our head see if god would have left it just when he spoke it and never brought it to pass he would have never proved his word but when it becomes tangible and in the flesh then it becomes the word truth so in other words so we're not just predestinated to eternal life but we're also predestinated to fulfill the word that was allotted to us so we already know there's a lot of word or a lot of predestinated people that are going to prove that word there's already a people that's been allotted and placed in the age to bring the past tangibly and make that word flesh look now that's where we have to start stepping in to the picture and so i just like to play this 17 minutes of out of the message works is faith expressed and and i i want you to catch notice i i don't have any other vocabulary other than when i say i want i mean i want the lord to reveal to you so um but i don't want to pre be presumptuous in any way but as we listen to this i believe we're starting on paragraph uh see if i can find it i don't i didn't write it down what paragraph gary do you remember what paragraph we're starting on what we're starting on paragraph 122 in in the message uh works as faith expressed now just remember think of that ephesian scripture that you have for ordained good works that you are for gain to walk in so if you see the sign of the time in our hearts we might start looking for what those works are amen the lord bless you as we listen to this few moments this is sunday school this morning we want to we really want to fall in love with this message and get real serious about it god bless you jesus said that no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all that the father has given me will come to me no man can understand who he is or how it is except to be revealed to you by the revelation of god and then faith in that you act accordingly see here we see plainly that god is revealed in jesus and only those who were foreordained to see it will see it amen be sure to read this scripture i omitted it then that's saint john 6 44-46 i omitted it because i thought maybe we'd uh have a maybe a not enough time to go through because that clock up there just keeps moving and so we uh you notice no man no man can come except my father draws him first and all the father has given me they will come they'll recognize it no other man can do it no other person no matter how good who you are it's got to be revealed to you then you see who jesus christ is now here predestinated plan is in plain view just as other seed the word of god is a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand if you sowed seed just thrown out on the ground it would do no good the birds would pick it up if you throw it among thistles and thorns it'll choke it out pretty soon jesus parable says so so the ground has to be made ready first so god in sovereign grace prepares a heart first he prepared you before the foundational world to receive him in this age he foreknew you by his foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life amen therefore he prepared you that's where you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now it was god leading you to the place where he had ordained for you to be if or if this ground isn't prepared beforehand it can't grow that's reason the seed of faith when you're preaching faith see the discernments of the lord and see what takes place and all the gifts of the bible organ people work themselves out hallelujah i believe it and come up and find themselves disappointed the ground has to be for ordained and you know when it strikes it like my little eagle last night he knew when he heard that scream of that mother eagle there's a lot difference between that and the cluck of the hand because he was an eagle from the egg not he wasn't made an eagle right then he always was an eagle and a christian always was that's reasonably divorced when you're divorced because you were trapped into it see by your first parent adam and eve you become a sinner by nature you didn't want to be but now you heard the gospel and faith cometh by hearing revelation comes by hearing there is a little something inside of you another man set right by you saying oh i don't believe that stuff nonsense i don't believe that nothing to that like today on the day of pentecostal life said these men are full of new wine bro well it was a great thing to those it was happening to why it was god revealing himself to the individuals while others laughed these were rejoicing it was an individual revelation which is faith faith it's revealed if it wasn't faith then it wouldn't even be there it was faith just seeds has to have the ground prepared first therefore all he foreknew he called all he called all he for knew he predestinated if you want to read that romans 8 28 34 and also ephesians 1 1-5 see all he foreknew he did call all he called he justified and all he justified he has already glorified there's nothing out of order we think there is but look in the scriptures it's just kidding exactly the way god's word said it was we see the messages rejected today isn't that just what the scripture said they would do sure all these things are ordained of god oh it should make you walk happy that's our trouble with we today so much difference from the christians of old when the real true revelation of jesus christ being emmanuel dwelled in the hearts of those men they were rugged people but today we're padded by the nominations of oh i'll tell you they ain't got the revelation come over here you're depending on their revelation if their revelation isn't according to the word of god then it's wrong mind or anybody else's that's where the showdown comes the word of god tells which is right and wrong and you see that to have its ground of course therefore all he four knew see he already knew what was going to happen notice jesus said again about the seed some fell on rocks others and mixed grounds see overall his thorns thistles and everything else he couldn't grow and others on good ground good ground good soil which has been prepared already prepared all the man out here he's like as the chicken he's looking along trying to find he hits into this and he hits into that but actual while there comes a sudden scream from heaven he recognizes that right quick that's the word of god see he knows it because there's something in his heart that's been told to him revealed to him about him notice the prophet isaiah said a virgin shall conceive what a strange thing how a man in his right mind could say that there'd never been a virgin conceived a virgin shall conceive now he didn't worry about saying it he just said it how's she going to do it well that's not his business it's just to say what god said it was going to do god revealed it to him showed him the vision revealed it and it was right just the same god that told me that little baby be born with that man who couldn't have a the child uh have a girl like others and the things how it sounds strange when the doctor says it can't happen but when god says it's going to happen it depends on what kind of a word that falls in remember the prophet stood up there and his word went forth like god in genesis 1 he said let there be light let there be this let there be that create a man in his own image an image of god creating them male and female and there was nothing on the earth yet then we find out in genesis 2 here he made man in his own image there's no man to till the soul after the rest of creation what was it it's his words he was speaking it and when he spoke he said let there be light there might have not been light for 800 years afterwards might not be no light but he said it as long as he said it let there be a palm tree let there be an oak tree let there be this them seeds was forming down beneath that water that's right and in the season in the time in its own season it brought forth it can't fail it's god's word it just can't fail it's been expressed now one day god talked to man face to face but in time of moses when the fire was falling they said let god let moses speak not god we might perish therefore he said i'll speak to him like that no more i'll raise him up a prophet that's the way god's system always was now here's a prophet standing now he's under inspiration he doesn't think about his intellectuals well wait a minute if i'd say that well you know the people that think i'm insane see that's his intellectual there he's listening to satan just like eve did as long as the doctor says that you can't live you can't get well you can't do this or that as long as you listen to that that seed will never fall in that kind of ground to do any good it can but when something tears all that away and it falls in that bedding ground there's nothing can tear it out amen now no matter how long it takes it's going to happen now he said a virgin shall conceive did you know it was 800 years before that happened god foreknew the woman who should be what her name was where that seed would fall into you believe that or it did and from a literal womb would come forth this great miracle god knew about it he just revealed it to his prophet who was faithful and spoke the word without even thinking about what it was he just said it you never tried to reason it out if you kind of reason out what if this man this woman or this man sitting here or somebody tried to reason now i've been crippled all these years the doctor says is not a possible chance well there might not be as far as he knows that's true but if something can tear away them weeds if god buys grace not the preacher not nobody else but god can place into your heart a revelation that i'm going to be well there isn't nothing going to keep you sitting here there's nothing can hold you there you're going to be well but until that does happen you're going to sit right where the doctor says you're going to sit until that happens it has to be revealed it's the grace of god that reveals it now notice god knew the woman it would come to notice isaiah there was no question i said i didn't say wait a minute lord let wait just a minute what did you say to me a virgin is going to conceive well not now wait father there never was such a thing is that done he didn't hesitate he just said a virgin shall conceive right notice mary no now lord wait a minute you know i i never know the man this is impossible nothing like this never happened oh no nothing like this never happened how am i going to have this baby i don't know any man so it can't happen angel you're just mistaken i've got an optical illusion you know my church says these days are gone no it'll never fail in such a place as that mary never questioned she said how can it be an old old man he said the holy ghost will overshadow thee that's how it's going to happen she said behold the hands made of the lord no question see isaiah when god produced the word by thought revelation into the heart of isaiah it fell into the right grounds as a prophet that prophet didn't care for any man's wisdom he didn't care for any man's intellectual he didn't care about the person of anybody he was a dedicated channel to god and god spoke in his folk that's all where it hurt whether it didn't work sound crazy whether it didn't sound crazy didn't make any difference to him it was god not the man and that word went forth now it becomes a seed it has to fall somewhere if god said it there's bound to be a womb somewhere for it to fall into just as he said all things are possible to them that believe if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you saying see there's got to be somewhere that's right notice now we find that isaiah here spoke it the virgin mary as soon as the grounds has already broke up she had been a virgin she hadn't run around the grounds have been already prepared or predestinated before knowledge of god even said she's a virgin right then god knowed what her name would be for her name was on the book of life in heaven then it was vindicated man then to man saw the expression of it by the works when it was already done now we look back and say sure it was done because we see the works that was done noah's works expressed to man what his faith was in god's promise now god met noah and he said noah it's going to rain i'm going to destroy the whole earth with water not never had rain that's the impossibility well now noah god said prepare an ark at the dimensions that i'll tell you about him being a carpenter and he went to work and began to take his foot ads and everything to cut the boards and fix it up there with the of wood and put the pitch in it just like he said and do you imagine why people thought about that man they said that man is actually crazy because he says it's going to bring water out of the heavens and there's no water up there but you see noah didn't think about that his works was expressing to the people what his faith was and what god said would take place that's the reason a genuine christian separates himself from everything but the word of god no matter what the people think what anybody else says he's separated because he isn't just saying that if he is it won't be long till his work shall be made on he'll fall back and slip this way and join this and this and start you show what he is but if he's a genuine if the word of god has bedded into him then it's going to bring forth its kind you'll see that man preparing for that great hour see that's we know it in again i i hate to cut you off but i think that's pretty evident that what he's telling us see we've got to understand so much that this is spiritual food in due season that because he was a prophet a prophet is a seer so he could see out and and in seeing out by the vision he spoke what that he saw i mean that was just explained to us but when he spoke what he saw he didn't question it he just spoke what he saw so the vision that god that gave the vision already knew who the girl was he already knew that there would be somebody there to receive it you understand he said he had to prepare the ground well a lot of us in our life have had our ground prepared we've been through this we've been through that we've went through this suffering that suffering we went through seasons of doubt but i just love how he he just kind of says he says the ground has been already prepared or predestinated by the foreknowledge of god it's already prepared so i just want to see excuse me a moment so i'm so interested in my heart of the placing and the adoption of his elect lady in the hour that we live in so we begin to see as he begins to express this so he keeps we already know that we've been for we're his workmanship we're made in christ jesus under good works and that god hath predestinated or before ordained that we should walk in them so we see we see the the the program begin to unfold in other words god has the vision and and and the word and he speaks that word and it's revealed to the person that he had in his mind that would receive it so he knew you i mean that's one of the great principles that the prophet of god laid out to us because we we're going to have to have that as a solid foundation before we take the next step we have to know that he knew us that he predestinated us and that what that his vision was what that his word was it's now revealed it could only reveal to those that were predestinated to see it other people don't see it but because they don't see it it does not make it true that's why the believer what separates himself from everything but the revealed word of god so now it's revealed and i like how he used noah here if i could bring this to the point that i want to make this morning that i want to share and i want to share it with myself he said noah's works expressed to man what his faith was in god's promise now god met noah and said noah it's going to rain i'm going to destroy the whole earth with water now it had never rained that's the impossibility everything with real faith with god has that impossibility with it yes sir you know what your impossibility is it's you amen you're the impossibility i can't do this i'm no good right you're the impossibility you look at yourself you don't think i can do this i i can't do these works i can't do these things and that's why it's a beautiful message was preached called perfect strength imperfect weakness he said man's always using his excuses or he's either trying to use his ability but he doesn't understand that god's grace is sufficient for him so that's the impossibility so look at the condition we're in look at the world condition unbelief doesn't stop god they're getting more ungodly they're getting less of god they're taking god out of school they're trying to do away with any exemptions for churches they think they can make it without them the prophet of god said they don't need revelation they've got it all figured out because they've got a leader that leader just happens to be a doomed devil but think of it that was the impossibility now noah said prepare an ark of the dimensions that i tell you about and him being a carpenter he went to work that's what we've got to start coming to you know god can't do anything for you until you confess it first in other words you've got if you believe you're healed [Applause] it it isn't a secret thing you understand you you know that god's a healer so you the first step is you've got to take a step if i can say the word what i'm trying to expect is if you have a revelation there's got to be a step towards that revelation a work that proves that you believe it's going to happen now remember success and failure launch from the same spot if either for whatever place you are your next step is either going to be success or it'll be failure they both take from the same place the believer when he has a re revealed to him now the believer receives the signs they see that there is a messenger they see it coming to pass they see the lady in purple they see the plague they see the votes things they see all these things they see the cars they see everything that's transpiring and it awakes them to the promise what's promised to me what part do i play and when she comes to that point and they realizes wait i've been commissioned because this is the restoration of the faith of our fathers the faith of our fathers was the faith to act in carrying out the commission they weren't afraid to act upon it silver and gold have i none so they came up the guy bag doms peter says i don't have alms i don't have silver and gold but i do have something he confessed it because he knew that the lord told him the works that i do shall you do also so he had that faith he had the revelation but he still had to say fix your eyes upon me and perceiving the man had faith he said stand up and walk there was a work that went along with the faith in other words peter was standing in the spot where either he was going to be successful or he would fail he couldn't stand there he couldn't he's got to say wait a minute if i've got this and i've been commissioned and it's been revealed to me that the works that he did i this is what he did i saw him do it his spirit's with me i know he's present i know this is going to happen but he still had to make that step he still had to take that first step of faith he still had to start doing the works that showed that he was moving in the direction of the revelation and plan that was going to be brought to pass another if if someone is going to get well somebody's going to lay their hands on them or somebody's going to speak the word to them because faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of god somebody has got to put the work of the word of god into action in order for it to come to pass and i thought that was just so beautiful how that he said it he says and then faith he says jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all the father hath given me will come to me no man can understand who he is or how it is except it be revealed to you by the revelation of god and then faith in that you act accordingly so i believe we've come to this place that the revelation of the hour we live in the revelation that we have a commission the revelation that we've we've come to that place in our our lives that we see where we are the world's getting dark unbelief doesn't stop god but we're that elect lady we're that called out one we're that last voice we're the ones that have the truth that now we're from the point where we've got to make that step to have the work that expresses what we believe as long as we remain on paper we're no different than any other church with any doctrine but when we understand that we have a god not our own selves but we've been predestinated foreordained we're his workmanship we've chosen us for this hour to represent and bring the past and do the works of this restoration that you're the one that he's elected to do then you'll sit down and tell your neighbor you know i've been sick for a long time but i still believe god's going to heal her he's a healer it says right here in this word i want to confess to you you keep your eyes on me because i'm going to be healed but as long as we keep that in enveloped up as long as we keep that hidden it stays a word but an action or a step of faith or a move in that direction now it starts becoming tangible and when it starts to become tangible now it can grow into its completion doesn't care how long it takes because now the word is being made flesh and so every time you see a promise you see noah knew it was going to rain so he started to work he started to do the things that showed he believed the promise is coming just like us we ought to start doing the things that show that we believe is coming if you care about people at school you tell your best friend and and it's fine with me if you have best friends that aren't christians but if they're really your best friend they're not going to remain like that long because you'll share your heart with them and you'll either move them or they'll dump you it's okay can i say it like this so you kind of get my where i'm trying to say it's worth the risk because either you're going to be successful or you're going to fail it's launches from the same point but if they're a believer they'll receive it and they'll be baptized if they're not they'll reject it and be damned but you don't move you're not moved by what's on the outside you're moved by what's on the inside you have the revelation you believe it you make the testimony you lay your hands on the sick you go to the person says i believe god's a healer i'm going to lay my hands on you i believe you get well you've got to have the work of your faith if they believe it and they receive it they'll rise up if they don't don't stop you unbelief doesn't stop god it don't stop your work it doesn't stop your testimony it doesn't stop what you stand for it doesn't stop you confessing what you believe we are at the end time god sent a message to guide us out of here we believe it moses went down with a stick in his hand he's had the burning bush god told them everything but moses still had to load his wife on the donkey and head to egypt with the stick this is what the the messenger says he says moses took his stick and went down there and took that nation out of a nation and he come with a stick in his hand and told pharaoh let them go pharaoh seen in moses the works that he had faith in what he was going to do or try to do he had faith in the promise of god that made the promise he went down there in the promise of god of god that he made the promise he went down to take it over can you imagine him but moses had to take the stick he had to take the step of faith he had to stand in front of pharaoh and say let my people go he threw a stick down they called it a cheap trick see there he was standing at the same place of success or failure but he believed what god said moses dick ate him up he said let my people go but it was the work it was moses coming in there with a stick that pharaoh knew that this guy believes what he's saying what do you believe in other words do what does our actions and our works express if someone you know and you know in this condition you are going to die or in this condition you're going to be lost and you have that truth in that revelation and you have that love of god moving in your heart isn't there something that stirs within you that i've got the faith of my fathers you're not obligated to how they receive it you're only obligated to do the work of your faith but if fear of failure amen or fear of rejection or fear of reproach stops you from telling someone god's a healer to talking to somebody about a being delivered from drugs about testifying about the things if the fear of failure stops you then you have no work and you've got to have a work that expresses your faith because god's called you so he's given us the revelation he's given us the signs to tell us it's time we move towards the works you say i don't we're not saying no we're not saved by works there's works that are for ordained that we should walk in that's what i'm saying you've got to find what those works are that you've been for ordained to walk in the hour the signs point to the fact now is the hour and the time that i've got to find out what is my place in the plan and what would you have me to do and unbelief doesn't stop god every work of god is right on time but and you have a part that you play if we're going to be a body of believers and represent this word every member's got to be fitted and joined together all of us have got to be about our father's business doing what it is in our heart he's the great orchestra leader he's got every instrument to play its part and we've just got to rise up and recognize now's the time that i have the great work in my life and maybe you've been on the sideline maybe you've looked at your past but let me say the blood of jesus christ cleanses you from all unrighteousness don't let your past stop you don't let anything stop you from a work that expresses your faith show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my works faith and works works hand in hand like the old in the new testament we've just come to the place where it's time for us to see the supernatural work in our myth not producing it you understand but we know it's the time of it because we've seen the signs of it we've seen the positioning of it we've seen the place of it it isn't a workup it's a coming to pass of god's word god bless you let's stand this morning you love them this morning many of you i know have to go but we're going to have a little baptism at this time so if the brothers would go prepare the pool and uh get ready for the baptism and we're going to baptize uh sister lily stefan this morning uh and it is really a wonderful testimony uh he's just how that the lord came to her and she had three dreams and and in and she dreamed to be baptized and in one of the dreams she said that i baptized her and and it just seems like that's coming to pass so i i love to see god you know we've got to the place where if someone says they have a dream the first thing we don't believe that you're young you know god's going to start moving supernaturally amen prepare your heart for faith brother steve are you here and all things are possible church let's believe for the supernatural and and as we go to do this baptism this morning if you have to leave don't feel bad about leaving maybe you have work or you're hungry or whatever it is but if you'd like to stay and enjoy the baptism just feel free to stay so god richly bless you this morning and then i guess we'll let's just say a prayer before we go father we just ask that you let this word sink into the heart of each believer may they get along with you and understand that you predestinated them to this hour you've given the revelation and that you have a expression of that revelation that they are to show this world by the work that you before ordained that they should walk in father i just pray in my heart that every believer here can catch that they're a light and no man lighted the candle and set it on the hill under a basket but they set it on a hill that their good works might glorify the father in heaven i just ask that you grant it and you stir every heart in here that maybe he's just been sitting on the sideline or hasn't known their position or their place father may they rise up and say here is your handmaiden here is your servant lord be it done unto me according to thy will i'll bring forth that word in my flesh oh let us be that bride of christ we pray in jesus name amen [Music] grace [Music] my song of praise [Music] [Music] just why he came to love me [Music] i style for [Music] my [Music] jesus died for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] [Applause] my fault and so [Music] the same me from the seed and and gave me bye oh praise all glory to his [Music] i [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus died for me [Music] [Music] my knees [Music] the water so my soul [Music] desires [Music] [Music] here [Music] thee amen i think they can be seated if you would like i think you can see on the screen if not if you can't you're welcome to stand up hi i left my glasses so i'm going to read this by memory the best i can but you know when lily came to talk to me there was just such a sweet presence and such a sweet desire that and her testimony of how that she dreamed that she was to be baptized not just one dream but three dreams and it really let me know that this was the lord moving upon her heart and i don't know if you've ever got to meet her or talk to her much i know she's in one way shy but in another way just has just such a wonderful spirit but she's just such a lovely person and i'm really excited about baptizing her this morning i just think you can have a wonderful fruitful life and and you know we never want to be baptized because somebody else got baptized or it's what all the kids are doing so i love it when the lord is just moving on each heart individually and there's an obedience to the word of god and you know it doesn't matter and this is just for us in general it doesn't matter what's on your history whenever god moves on you if you'll be obedient from that moment you will reap the fruit of that obedience and it'll lead you to repentance of your past it'll lead you into doing things that you never thought you could do because you're the impossible so obedience to the word of god's wonderful and i just feel that lily is doing this according to the obedience of god's word and that means a lot to me i hope you can all hear me now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children to all them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this up toward generation and they that gladly received his words were baptized and the same day they were added unto them 3 000 souls he's still calling and you know what's so wonderful is the promise that our sister is going to receive when paul went to those people and he says have you received the holy ghost since you believe they said no we didn't know there was such do you notice the first question he asked how were you baptized because he would have known if they were baptized the promise would have been fulfilled so he re-baptized them in the name of jesus christ and they received the holy ghost so what a wonderful thing that we know the word of god is going to be fulfilled in our sister amen lily according to god's word in the great commission jesus told the disciples to go into all the world baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and by divine revelation peter knew what that name was it was the lord jesus christ and according to the scriptures we fulfill today the word of god in your life that god has led you to this pool that he can fill all his promises in you the predestinated seed we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ uh i think this song is our dismissal [Music] [Applause] he will guide you he will keep you safe [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all the is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] um [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
