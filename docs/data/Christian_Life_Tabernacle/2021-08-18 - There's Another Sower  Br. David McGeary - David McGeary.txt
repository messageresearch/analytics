Description:
There's Another Sower
Br. David McGeary
Wednesday Service: August 18,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

love that is shed abroad that's like your love father we just ask that you have blessed us this evening as we fellowship around your word in your precious and wonderful and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you tonight if you have your bibles we're going to uh a little bit out of a message called a seed of discrepancy and we want to read the scriptures that our messenger used in matthew the 13th chapter starting with the uh 24th verse and then also we want to flip over and then we'll read out of the i guess the 36th and the through the 43rd verse so let us turn there in our bibles tonight and the lord would bless us we just have a little thought tonight i think that we'll be able to enjoy so i'm going to be in missouri this weekend so i felt that i'd just like to take this evening's uh service and just fellowship with you this evening so if we start in the uh my the 13th chapter and starting with the 24th verse and another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like an unto a man which soweth good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy come and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way and when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servant of the house holder came and said unto him sir deadest doubt did didest not doubt so good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares and he said unto them an enemy has done this the servant said unto him without then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares you root up also the wheat with them amen but let them both grow up until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles and burn them but rather the wheat into my barn and we know the prophet of god told us the interpretation of that gathering was the world council of churches and the church is coming together and then we we go over it and i believe also this is in matthew also ended and this is that 36th verse he said and jesus sent the multitude away and went in to the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man amen amen that's ministry in our day the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that soweth them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned into fire so shall it be at the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the kingdom of their father he who hath ear to hear let him hear heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated it's certainly always nice to gather out in the house of the lord and to talk about the things we're get like i said we'll be in missouri this weekend uh helping the brothers there they're going through the process of how to select a new pastor and and uh of course brother brown's passing uh caught us all by surprise but um so we're going to pick up when we get back ministering out of the rising of the sun but i just wanted to share this little thought with us so we know that god in the beginning sowed his word and so that's what we we understood we read the statements and we read the quotes that that your god he he plants his word he sows his word and then he sends his holy spirit out to find that seed and he uses the great story of the eagle that that went out she knew she had an egg she knew that she had something that was a part of her that was somewhere that was given into the care another parable we know is that the shepherd when when one of his sheep is not found in the flock he goes out and finds that sheep and so all of us were were born in sin and shape and iniquity and we came into the world uh speaking lies but there was something in us that god had planted there and because he planted it there he went and found us and so he he searched for us and he found us he says you have not chosen me i have chosen you and so he came along and he found us and then so after he found us he quickened us he brought us to life and and uh we were as the saying would go we were green behind the ears we we didn't know anything alls we knew is that we weren't what we used to be that there had been a change in us and and all of a sudden we felt conviction and we felt that we didn't want to participate and do the things we used to do we began to find a peace and a joy with what came with our new transformation and but yet we didn't understand we didn't even understand the depths of our enemy well we didn't know how low that he would go we really didn't know anything about god we didn't know any doctrines we were just a little teeny blade that just popped up from a surface i i always liked a watermelon seed because i like that little two-bladed little thing that that came up you know and and uh i i used to throw all my watermelon seeds out and see that little thing pop up you know and i dig it and see that little thing coming out of that seed and and then you know grow into big watermelons and and so we knew that that we just come to life and then god wants to uh uh nourish us so he's got to feed us you know and that's what he told peter he said feed my sheep feed my lambs you know he's going to feed us and and grow us up and bring us into maturity he's going to be a husband tree over the field he's going to weed out the things and after and and let the sunlight shine upon us until he brings us to a place that we can be harvested and so uh we know that that's the the plan of god and so so we we know and if i could read this statement to you it says now it's harvest time at the beginning when god sowed his seed upon the earth and gave it in the hearts of his children his family to keep that word that was their only defense keep that word and he says and here comes the enemy in and broke that barrier by sowing the seed of discrepancy contrary to the word of god that was that was discrepancy in the beginning and still is anything that will add anything to the word of god is still the seed of discrepancy i don't care where it comes from it comes if where it comes from if it's from organization if it's from military sources if it's from political sources anything that's contrary to the word of god is the seed of discrepancy now that's uh and so what is a discrepancy so we know that god planted his seed and it's in our heart but he also said and that was his plan that was his defense but the enemy came in and it said he said he went down and i i went down and found the word of discrepancy so i got the dictionary and i looked up what discrepancy means and it means sowing discord or being contrary now just think of that sowing discord and being contrary you know uh that's uh that's very easily done you know what i mean just you know to be contrary says sowing a discord something different or being contrary to what's already ben now and so if i i if i had a little title uh for uh this thought tonight i i would want to say that there's a another sower there's another sower and so we're living life and we we talked about in the rising of the sun we realize that god planted the seed and he had to have something that shined upon that seed to bring it to light and so he left the pattern because the invisible things of god are clearly seen in the visible things around us so the earth was without form or void and there was waters upon the earth and god moved upon the earth and now he was going to quicken that seed to life now a lot of times we think that the sun quickened the seed really what quickened the seed was the spoken word which said let there be light and then when the light that was the spoken word manifested shined on that seed that seed began to come to life and and so uh i'd like to lay this because we we're what we want to talk about is this other sower now we're real focused on the spirit of god uh quickening the word to us we're excited about what god's doing we see the holy spirit moving we saw the other evening where a brother had on his heart to to to pray and and okay and i was sitting up here on the platform and the lord spoke to my part have the brothers have brother uh step on and the brothers pray for you and and i i got up and and and i i came i think maybe it was cosmine that was here and i said i want you to call the brothers and have them pray for and i said sometimes and they were sitting in the back of the church talking about we need to go pray for the brethren and so that wasn't orchestrated through any form of telepathy you know understand there was another being that was present that that god done something for uh many of you christians have realized how it's just something just it just has got to be the lord the way that it just works out you know the other day i was i inquired about a brother i looked over and says what about this uh pursuit that you were taking uh you know i i was curious i thought that was gonna happen and sure enough it just turns around and and right after we talk about it god brings it to pass and so it's not any reflection on any of us it's a reflection on the fact that god wants to move in our midst he's trying to bring us to a place that we are our participant in the supernatural and god chose man so in order to bring the supernatural to past he has got to have something to manifest in that's right do you understand so teaching is nothing but intellect until it's manifested in the flesh till somebody speaks it somebody does it the actions are taken and the fruit of those actions are approved so we could talk all we want about the scriptures saying lay hands on the sick or god's a healer but those are idle words until somebody comes along takes that word puts it into action and carries it out and then it's manifested now it's been proved to be true and therefore now it becomes living word god doesn't want a dead church he doesn't want ceremonies he doesn't want people just carrying on and and uh just having some sort of form of godliness but denying the power thereof god wants the power in his church that's why he sent him to the upper room and said go there and tarry until you're in dude with power from on high so if that was for the first church if that god was will his will for the first church for his children that's his will for his children today he doesn't want you to be powerless he doesn't want you to be brought into subjection he doesn't want you in bondage but he wants you to be free and not only does he want you to be free and i know we battle against the lust of the flesh the pride of life the lust of the eyes we these are all things that we fight with we have personalities that we have to bring in subjection paul says i die daily i bring myself into subjection but yet there's a hunger in our heart to have all this message that we believe for so long to really become a reality i think that we want to overcome and you say why would we want to overcome because it's given to the overcomer it's given to the overcomer just like that life has got to come out of the earth and we realize that seed life that's in us has got to come out and it has fruits every seed that's planted has a fruit if it doesn't have a fruit and it can't reproduce itself then it's a hybrid and it dies right there and that's the end of the train but that's not the way that god wants us to be he wants us to be fruitful and that's what he even said to adam go out multiply be fruitful he said you are the salt of the earth so he wants the believers to be fruitful if he wants them to manifest something and i believe that there's a time now in the church where god's really moving on his real children and they're hungry to live real overcoming christian lives i think they're tired of all the negativity that we possess and we want to overcome this negativity we want to overcome thinking that we don't feel godly we we want to we want to be able to pray we want to be able to feel the move of the spirit and and be able to bear burdens of our brothers and sisters i think that there's just a time that we really want to start being christ-like we don't want to hide in our teaching you know the message of the hour empowers a believer even in the intellect they can use brother branham stories they can use his statements they can use his little expressions of understanding and almost close the mouth of anybody that would dispute with you but that's not what we're wanting you know we don't want to be combative we want to be servants we want to let our light shine we want we want the lord to live in us and we want the love of god shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit we want to love one another we want to serve one another we want to carry out his will and so uh we understand that there's something that god planted and so i i i really believe that we're we're sensing that we're sensing that there's that god is moving and every time god moves we know that along with every upward move there's a there's a falling away there's just something that transpires where people decide not to go on they're comfortable to a certain place and then when it seems like the pressure is starting to come on and and the gospel is starting to move into their lives and they they they shrink away whether we don't know why that is uh it's always been that way with that you could study the two revivals you could study every time there's a move of god not everybody turns the corner people set up camps and they get to a place in their life where i'm kind of comfortable the way things are sort of like the little eaglets in the nest you know and god starts shaking the nest and the church starts moving and and when you move you've got to move from what you've become comfortable with into a higher realm and you know i have this on my heart i'd like to preach it when we get through with the message of it is the rising of the sun but there's a kind of two forms of leadership and one of them is the leadership of the word that's where you can read the word and it says you know do this do this do this sustain from this be careful about this and then there's that other leadership that comes from i have need to go by here or or i i feel led like the messenger felt led he come out and brother branham came out of the airport and i believe it was a memphis and something said start walking and remember he stopped but you know looked around he says walk and he looked at his watch and and do you know the story very well and he felt led and then when he came down that street there was another person that was led now remember she wasn't in the message that we call the message but she was in the message of the holy spirit okay and she recognized this preacher or parson as being elijah it's a wonder it's a wonderful story of the moving of the spirit of god and and of how that god moves and so we know that we know certain things right we know that we shouldn't cut our hair i mean that's what the prophet of god taught in fact he even said in question questions and answers i would that you wouldn't even put scissors on it now that's obedience to the word you you understand we know that we should be shame-faced and and sober he talks about men not having long hair and and bangs and wearing uh these uh bermudas and things like that and so we have that leadership and we obey that by because the spirit a quickens to us and tells us to keep his word and that becomes a defense and it becomes a blessing to us we you know more items pertain to sisters concerning dress than that it does to men but you you you know those things and you do those things by the obedience to the word of god in other words you're instructed and you know those things are true and you keep those things but there's another form of leadership that's where god can speak to you and you can follow the holy unction now they're never contrary one to another they're in perfect harmony but in order to get to the higher form of leadership the obedience to the first leadership has to be in place he who is entrusted with much you understand and then that is if faithful in the level will be faithful in the the much it and so this is what that we want to talk about we want to talk about this other sower because this is this other sower is the hindrance to the crop and so i like this statement i don't know if they want to put the statements up or not but this is in paragraph 62 of the message it is the rising of the sun he says hebrews 13 8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever we his beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now so okay that that's what so if that's what we're to do then we were to do that because god desires us to do that you understand and if you're his and god's desiring for you to put that life on display then you feel that pull in your heart i want more of god i want his life on display i want to be more of a christian i want to be more of a a real a believer i want to prove his life is in us now well that's hard if you're looking at the same person in the mirror that i'm looking at so it makes me cry out more lord i need more of you i need your grace i need your mercy i need your instruction i need you to help me overcome i i want you said that you would prove that you're alive in me not somebody else not the church but this is a promise that brought to me and you sent a messenger to me you veiled yourself in human flesh you called a young boy named billy branham you sent an a angel to him he became a minister reverend william branham and he stayed true to the message and he spoke the words of life that will quicken the seed that's in me that i can manifest it that's right so i want that i don't want to sit there and believe it that it's true that's the same pillar of our that's true that's the statue of perfect man that's true that's the cloud that appeared for the seven seals that's true that's the hoffman's head of christ the one he said that looked most like him i believe all that but i want that to turn into a living life in me i believe all of it i believe it with all my heart i i would dispute with you if you thought it wasn't true i've seen a lot of the people that have fallen away they call everybody else they won't call me because i'm dying in the wool sold out and then they're not going to change me they they know what god did for me and i wouldn't have never believed anything if it wasn't from the voice i didn't even know he was a prophet when i heard his voice i didn't know what he fulfilled i didn't know where he fit in the scripture i didn't know anything about him but i knew one thing when he spoke that was the words of life and it did something to me so he said he said here to prove that his life is in us now the beneficiaries of this life the life there never was a life lived like it he was the son of god and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on that easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and bring this good news to every person so he said when when he went into the grave all that life was shut out gone hope you enjoyed he's right in that tune you'll never see him again he's going to rot like everybody else i put in that tomb he's never going to come out of there his words are just going to fail fail away they're just going to fail they're just going to fade away but what happened there was a word prophesied i will not suffer my holy one to seek corruption and he had the power to lay this life down and to take it up again and he rolled that stone back and it came out of there and so we just want to just read this a little bit to set our our place up for this evening and by him the vote the good news to every person that he is a living how can we do it by word only okay so we can't do it by word only that's not what makes them live you see the word has got to transform into flesh so in the beginning if the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and he was a quickening spirit the first adam was a living soul but now he's a quickening spirit so he can make put that life in us and make it come alive and so uh that's where my life is i want that life alive in me not in a demonstration in a service not in a shout not in a song not in a prayer line but i want that life there when i meet the challenges of life that discourage me when i'm in my down time when i'm in my low places that's where i want to find him i want to find them in in the peace i'm not very good with idle time where i just get to those places i don't know where to go i don't know what to do i just feel kind of drifting those are weak times you know the worldly expression the idle mind is the devil's playground those are the times that i want to commune i i want to be closer with him i hate to talk about myself but i just i want it so bad amen amen and and so he speaks here he says you can't do it by word only for it's written the gospel came not by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the holy spirit to prove that he's alive now that's the gospel so the end which is the word of god which is what he's desiring for us to want to achieve to he doesn't want us to sit back and hope that what we believe is going to carry us through no he wants you to be living fruit of his spirit every one of us now this is what he says now if there is another gospel as paul spoke to one of the groups i am surprised that you've turned to another gospel which there is no other but a make-believe gospel in a denominational fiction turning from the good news so if we understand that there's another gospel that's what he said who where did you get this other gospel from okay i didn't know there was another gospel well the other gospel is being sowed if it's a seed of discrepancy there's somebody else out there sowing a gospel that's not the original word of god it's contrary it it's different it's it it meets all of the definitions it's not what was the purpose of what was to be uh uh uh brought like he said it's a denominational fiction and so we've got to realize and this is my point tonight is we've got to understand that there is another sower out there and he's at work now we know where the battleground is it's in our mind so the sower is out there always trying to sow something contrary and we've got to be aware of it you know we just we can't just think that we're good seed and that there's not this other sower who's suddenly and cunningly even in the night so he's not out in the open but he's sowing little things into our mind little things into our life trying to give us little explanations trying to reason things out in our life and and trying to say little things like that's not important that doesn't matter that really doesn't do it i i remember that the reason that this all came to me but i remember the time when we lived in flagstaff and we first came there and and all the sisters and everybody were we were just kind of fresh out of the world so nobody really had super long hair so they all come up with this idea that if you would just trim the ends off of it it would grow faster wow well i mean hey let's get long hair as quick as we can you know what i mean and it seemed reasonable you know everybody's clipping away well one day we listened to questions and answers and they were talking about uh brothers branham's children because i guess they cut bangs on themselves but then he said out i would that you wouldn't even lay a pair of scissors now i don't know what anybody else heard that's right you understand but i know as for me and my house we we accepted the word of the lord we took it as the word of the lord and that's another discrepancy well he didn't say thus saith the lord be followers of me as i am of christ you can't separate the messenger from the messi you understand he was a light he was an example of the scripture i believe paul said i am an example of you you to you you know what i mean so there there was a a part of us that got anchored into even though we didn't understand it but it was spoken and we we begin to hear all these little discrepancies all these little things that were sowed you know and some of them we didn't have answers for you know we we just uh we just would have to to pray and read and wait till we we heard something you know and and so many of those little things uh begin to uh come up and and we begin to realize that there was little things that were being sold little uh ways of thinking little ways of approaches the little understandings you know just all these little things that began to be sold and and the purpose of those things was to affect our witness of making the word of god alive and so i'd like to read this paragraph of the seed of discrepancy it's paragraph 50. so we've got a purpose right and that's to prove he's alive okay so we and so we've got to understand that there's something that we've got to stand for and possess to have it and so if we would read this statement it says now we find today that this discrepancy has been sowed through every age right so we know what we know what this discrepancy is it's it is sowing discord being contrary sowing discord something different or being contrary to what's already been so the sa this enemy just from the very first day when satan spoke to adam and eve it was surely you won't die that was that seed of discrepancy contrary to the word of god that seed is still being sowed today now we find today that this discrepancy has been sowed through every age if it's possible to get it in the next 10 or 15 minutes i i would do it but you can't down through the ages we are all most all of us read the bible and now like when jesus come and found that discrepancy discrepancy contrary he was the word made manifest he was god's interpretation of the word because he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are which testify of me there you are he was the interpretation of the word and every born-again son and daughter of god of this age is the interpretation of the word you are written epistles read of all men okay so that that's what it is now you've got another sower with another gospel and he wants his crop to come up he wants his gospel to be witnessed he wants to manifest what he's sowing so he's going to sow something contrary because if he can get something contrary into our lives now they're reading something different than the full picture you're living a different gospel and that's what his desire is okay his desire is for us to testify of his kingdom to give him some form of credence so if he if if he believes satan's lie as god's truth so when he says and satan appears as what an angel of light look he he comes and he sows discrepancies he sows things in the word of god that aren't true he gives you justifications for things that the unction of your spirit tells you not to do he's a sower he's always trying to find he's trying to find something he can put in your life because the purpose of him doing that if he can sow anything in it's going to keep us from achieving what it is that we're desiring to achieve so you can't you can't you can't uh not take heed of him every time you reach a valley of decision or every time you're seeking for more of god he is there trying to sow something there there's another sower and he's at work and he's trying to sow discrepancy something contrary just put a spin on something you know america don't take it at face value this is what he meant this is what he said look at this it can and so you've got to come down to your heart when you begin to think these things you've got to pray through them and begin to realize does this really help me manifest what my goal is i'll tell you one of the worst things is gossip i don't see any of my gossipers here oh we've got them we've got them and gossip is discrepancy and discrepancy kills the life of the church it's amazing who all stayed away they know they know in their spirit they they know they know what it does but it's become so part of tradition that you've got to talk about everything well guess what tradition will not get you into heaven there's only one thing that gets you in heaven and that's the love of god shed abroad in your heart by the holy spirit so you we've got you've got to understand that that these things are are are are he he's coming in and and so he wants to come in and he wants to start sowing all this stuff and you know what you do with the seed of the enemy you don't plant it you don't try to put it in a special pot you don't water it you don't have anything to do with it you walk away from it you start talking about somebody and you say gossip is not a lie gossip is a spirit and you can gossip the truth and end up in hell see we just got to the place that we think that we're untouchable you know we can't do anything wrong we're so predestinated that you know our names on the lamb's book of life well you've got to remember these things when you start seeing these shortcomings in your life you better see that's god letting you know that you might need to find the place that you're supposed to be you might supposed to find the fountain that cleanses you from all unrighteousness but but don't tell me that you're going to be cutting your hair you've been putting on all these powders and everything you're going to be putting on high heels be putting on all kinds of tight clothes and everything and think that your name's in the lamb's book of life i'm not saying it's not in the lamb's book of life but you're not manifesting that in the lamb's book of life if you'll be destroyed by fire that you could be saved i don't want that to i don't want to be unfruitful want to be fruitful and if jesus predicted this paragraph 63 and if jesus predicted this age to end up in the greatest discrepancy that ever was the lady of seeing church age something that is completely contrary and in adversity with the truth blind miserable poor wretched and naked and don't know it don't even know they're gossiping oh sister such and such and she did this and brother such and said you know and men can gossip too i think we call it with women we call it gossip with men we call it backbiting same spirit trying to kill what influence so you've got to understand these things aren't hurting nobody but yourself so if you have a desire to go further then you've got to realize wait a minute i cannot let this sower get anything planted in my life because a root of bitterness will defile many. he says the lady of cnh lukewarm that put him out of the church how can it be anything else but discrepancy certainly it is he said it is it the ends it ends in that age so discrepancy is going to end in this age how's it going to end it's going to end in the believer that's right it's going to have a place that it will not be sowed it will not be taken that it comes to a place where there's a people that will not receive his seed you know that's what the prophet of god taught there would be a new bride there'd be a new eve and she would not take his seed wow man i can actually get to that place wow i didn't even deem it was possible i thought i was going to have to struggle with this flesh i thought i was going to have to struggle with this weakness i thought i was going to have to go through these ups and downs and ins and outs all my life but now i'm realizing there's a s-u-n s-o-n that's shiny there's someone here that came to rise me up and bring me to a higher place where i'm not going to take that seed it's not going to be in my harvest he said it was cain and abel again on calvary now notice as is that on the board okay good now notice as ever as ever as soon as jesus went away and went into heaven the holy spirit was sent back that was the seed the life giver unto the word as we spoke last night it's the one that quickens the word quicken means bring to life the genuine holy spirit only brings to life the word that it is the holy spirit only brings to life the word that it is won't bring a creed to life it can't because it's nothing of the creed it is the life of the word of god for it is god see and it quickens that body now so why would satan want to be able to sow a seed of discrepancy in you because god cannot bring that to life he can't bear witness of that so now you've got something in your life that's contrary to the word of god and he can't quicken it he can't bring it to life he can't he can't put his a seal of approval on it he's got to stand back and say this person is not truly representing me okay and and i know i i watch it i i don't understand it i i i want to be gentle i want to be kind i i understand we battle in the flesh but many times we'll see people come to church after their clothes will be so tight and they're wearing high heels and the only thing i can think is they've not heard it but i know i've preached it so there's got to be a discrepancy you understand somebody sowed a seed of reasoning and they're filtering it through that reasoning and therefore they're not manifesting the life in fact they're actually sitting there walking contrary to the word of god an affront right in the face of god i've done it but i realized wait a minute i got to stop the sower i've got to stop the sower i've got to get them right at the seed i can't let it plant i can't let it grow i can't let it gain root because now if you're the manifester of the seed now you're manifesting the seed of discrepancy like all these woman preachers we know that when a woman cuts her hair it's a sign of authority it's her claim to spiritual leadership i'm spiritual the word of god says not to cut my hair but i'm i'm above that i've got spiritual leadership i will interpret to you what he meant oh i thought oh short hair is down to your shoulders well when you have hair down your back i'm talking about myself i didn't want to cut my hair i was believing the message but i was from the wrong side of the fence let it grow long i don't how long was yours jax did you ever have long hair oh you look sweet but you understand but when i so i thought i i i'll cut my hair i cut it short i even had a discrepancy for it just pull your head over your shoulder and cut it off and i had a nazarite vow i didn't realize that all the other nazarites i were hanging out with were smoking drinking less than doing all this other stuff in the world no nazarite bowen now the nazarite vows the heart i had to get rid of that seed of discrepancy i had to get rid of i could look to a messenger and see an example i could listen to what he said what he said about the beatles what he he said about these these uh he called duck tales wasn't that what it was murdered him though he did them ducktale haircuts and all that that stuff they had i could hear the word and what was the word doing it was pulling that seed of discrepancy out of me so now i was no longer as long as i had that hair i really wasn't a true representation of the true gospel i was living a denominational fiction it was my fiction but that's what i was living we need people that have the guts i don't care who it is to say that's not what the word of god said i don't care about their explanation i don't care they think that they're spiritual enough and they've got leadership enough i used to think i had a hotline to god me and god just pick up the phone and talk to god i could do anything i want yeah that's till i heard somebody that really did talk to him i found out i had the wrong number you know what i mean i mean you've got to come to the place that you've got an absolute and nothing because you're not going to let anything be sold contrary to it no matter how pretty it is no matter how good it sounds no matter if you think it and the worst discrepancy is the one you come up with yourself because he doesn't stand behind creeds now notice as they did then as the bible said and john spoke to his children said little children ye have heard of the antichrist which was to come into the world and which already is in the world and is working in the children of disobedience so that's the first sign of discrepancy is disobedience to the word let me tell you discrepancy brings god's wrath amen i'm not saying you're lost but you might end up on your bed somewhere with cancer looking up at the ceiling till god can finally get you to a place i say let's don't fool with it how many wants to go to higher ground how many wants to be more spiritual how many wants to have more of the love of god and the power of god not everybody's a testifier not everybody can witness but i'll tell you how many people that our messenger say that that person praying that person that gave that in words of encouragement that person that brought you here there's a lot of ways god can speak believe me it's not in word only so what does that do have a preacher that's preached and preached the gospel if it's never manifested in the flesh and it's not manifested in the flesh in his life it needs to be manifested in the flesh of the people he's preaching to to prove that his words are the gospel that's why we know this messenger was the gospel because it's proved in us because every truth son and daughter of god is the interpretation of the word of god he says now as long as there's he says the children of disobedience now that was long about 30 years after the coming of the holy ghost we find when the holy ghost come the real seed the real life giver to the seed then here comes that discrepancy in again and notice on it went the real word had been vindicated them prophets of old had vindicated the word of god to be true and as they went down if anybody ever read the nicaea council or the pre nicaea council then 15 days of bloody politics when they bunch of romans down there wanted to bring in and make a denomination out of that church prophets came in wrapped in sheepskin eating herbs and stood for that word but what did it do they had to be like cain it had to be like abel one had to die do you understand one's got to die billy you understand i want the sea disprepancy to die i don't want to be reasoning i don't want to be coming up with excuses i don't want to be coming up with programs i want to be resolved in my spirit that this is the rising of the sun this is the true light of god's word this is the truth there's many voices but as he even said i am the voice of god to you i know you resent that he said but i am the voice of god to you not oh this is what he meant or i've got the spirit or he was this and he didn't know this and he didn't know that let me tell you something jesus's gospel was not subject to technology it was eternal life and it works today just like it worked back then in fact our prophet told us that if he ever got it where they get to that place of technology they can produce that voice today i think it would sound real familiar one had to die certainly it did and the word lost its influence amongst the people now let me just finish reading this because i want to just jump right there and take off and i'm going to let you go certainly it did and the word lost its influence amongst the people and they all voted out the true word and took in dogmas of discrepancy of the early catholic church they added a pope they added a bishop they added this that and the other they taken away the real true meaning of peter and of mary and all the rest of it what they do made her the mother of god they never understood she was an incubator they made jesus part a human which is sin and there was no sin found in him therefore there was no mary found in him the rest of it and made idols and made nothing but just a pagan ceremony out of the so-called christian religion statues to this lightened candles to that he says what was it the seed of discrepancy and organized and organized for the first time on earth a church what is it that seed of discrepancy which started sowing something adding to and taking away the same seed is still doing what is satan trying to do add and take and intake it's so easy to not even realize that you're almost daring god i can get away with this well i want to get rid of that thing i don't want that guy sitting say well he's full of mercy he won't throw you out no i want to say no i don't want it i don't want it in my heart i don't want it in my mind i don't want it in my being that's not the kind of person i want to be i want to be like him you say this is awful strange for you preaching like this after being in the message 50 years well i'll tell you something 50 years don't mean nothing there's only one thing that means anything and that's one minute with jesus christ a pagan ceremony first time on earth something attitude is taken away whoever heard in the bible of not eating meat on friday whoever heard in the bible of anything of sprinkling instead of baptizing immersing whoever heard of those things a hail mary or something whoever heard of some of this rotten tommy rod of these protestants too pot can't call the kettle greasy right just guilty of the least is guilty of the whole whoever heard of god ever dealing in an organization show me one time that one organization ever stayed alive it died immediately and never did rise again it's that time it's time that something takes place it's time for a god to move it killed the influence amongst the people that's what the seed of discrepancy does you get a lady that comes in and she's dressed like a oscar meyer she's killed the influence of the gospel you get someone who's clipping away it's killing the influence it kills the influence of the gospel right here in this building because they're preaching a different gospel than the gospel of jesus christ it's the seed of discrepancy at work trying to kill the influence it doesn't matter is what they're saying i can do this and still be blessed of god well end up with that cancer living in your body end up with that mental problem end up with the nervous breakdown if you're bold enough come right up and say i don't have to obey i will offer a better sacrifice i will sing like an angel i will do good works i will do all those things if that's god doesn't want sacrifice he wants righteousness to flow like a river he desires obedience above sacrifice it's a seed of discrepancy but you see what it's doing is it's killing the influence of the gospel that's what he does what spirit killed the gospel cain he wanted to have a different sacrifice a different life and so he killed the true gospel and when the seed of discrepancy comes and those things start to grow in our life it kills our influence and it kills the influence of the gospel and when you kill influence that means it's murder murder well we don't want to be guilty of murdering the influence of a gospel into someone's life that really needs it your children your daughters your sons you gotta we just can't let that stuff get in we can't let the gossip get in we can't let the talking of one another get in the uh talking about those things which are done in darkness it's a shame to talk about those things but don't you see what it's doing don't you see what this discrepancy is doing it's killing the influence of the gospel right in a body the gospel will lose its influence and will won't have the power of the resurrection moving in our life because the seed of discrepancy is sucking the life out of it that's the truth now i don't want to call things out i may have to make some personal visits james said the tongue is a wicked weapon hard to bridle can sweet and bitterness proceed from the same fountain but see they don't realize that is the spirit of cain killing the influence of the truth that and so when we present another gospel we're presenting a fiction to people as it's the truth they preach it as the gospel truth and then god turns them over and sears their conscience and turns them over to a reprobate mind and they don't even know what happened to him it was all those little anti things and all those little personal uh viewpoints and all those little decisions they make and i know the gospel i know the holy ghost i know i can do this i do this i can take authority i can teach we got a world full of of you know i don't know what kind of preachers they are i want to say woman preachers but i don't even think they know they're women nobody knows what a woman is nowadays it gets so bad praise god we got real godly women that live by the god's word and are anointed by the holy ghost and are shining their light so it killed the influence amongst the people and it kills the influence that's cain same thing has been done today they killed the influence saying that bunch of holy rollers is nothing to them why is discrepancy meant the faith word face to face and see what it is see if god interprets his own word god's able of these stones to raise up children to abraham so i really am saying this as a pastor who desires for his flock and himself i can't go to higher ground if i don't take my flock with me you understand the only thing i can do is is okay if if if they can't go then it's a matter of life or death for me then i'll go on but but i don't want to leave anybody behind the seed of abraham doesn't lead seed of abraham behind we don't leave our children behind we don't leave our loved ones behind we're we're going to claim every one of them but what we've all each all of us i have to do it you have to do it you've got to be aware of the other seller you got to recognize them in the field and you've got to understand just like you teenagers one of the things you got to fight is music you know what i mean you got you got to fight these fashions you got to fight these things they'll kill you that's right do you understand you've got to fight we're we're we're a multi-racial uh uh congregation congregation we have to deal with attractions you understand it and and and we know for a fact that we we don't mix our races together because god created them to be kept pure within themselves that's not anything to do with prejudice that's not anything to do with nothing it's life you have a better life if you don't go that route you know what i mean it's no one's better than anyone else all of us are sinners saved by grace but those are all the things that he's sowing discrepancy he's telling all these lies he's trying to sow all these seeds get your absolute down get it anchored in your soul the absolute of god where let no bitterness no wrath let none of these things proceed from your mouth live a holy life before god praying looking up for your redemption draw off night understanding we're in the biggest discrepancy of ever and we've got to not let anything be sowed in our life amen so god bless you pray for me this weekend in missouri that the lord would move mightily amongst the people and give them what they need that the church would help god would give them direction on on how to find a pastor and as you know not that i'm capable or have any ability but brother brown asked me to help him and i i owe it to him for all the years of friendship and he passed that message to some of those brothers so we just meet with them periodically and discuss things that are transparent so pray that god keeps us in his word do you love him amen let's stand together [Applause]

atonement of calvary was it was a dual atonement healing and salvation a lot of people get the benefits of the healing because he said that was pretty much unconditional it was the law of god but
