[7:33] [Music]
[7:50] we just want to make an announcement
[7:51] there's several things that have been
[7:53] left at the church
[7:55] especially children's coats and sweaters
[7:57] so if you're missing something or you
[8:00] haven't seen something in a while it
[8:01] might be here at church
[8:04] and if it's a brother or sister look
[8:06] around if you haven't seen them in a
[8:07] while
[8:08] you want to get them in church
[8:10] amen and also you notice that we're just
[8:14] we're thankful to the lord that we're
[8:15] making progress towards the building of
[8:17] the church
[8:18] and we just want to um maybe reiterate
[8:21] to you that the parking is extremely
[8:23] limited so we appreciate you being
[8:25] patient with us
[8:26] for for families for brothers that are
[8:28] riding with your family it might work
[8:31] well if you're able to pull up and drop
[8:33] your family off and then go park maybe
[8:36] down at the baptist church or if you
[8:38] find one of the streets there that's
[8:40] convenient and then you can
[8:41] walk up yourself we're trying to have
[8:44] somebody positioned and maybe give a
[8:46] ride from the baptist church to help
[8:48] with that so but if you're a mother with
[8:50] the family and your kids uh we're trying
[8:52] to keep the the paved parking right here
[8:55] uh for the elderly and for mother with
[8:57] young children once again if you're a
[8:59] father riding with your family if it's
[9:02] if you're able to drop your family off
[9:04] and they go apart but we just thank you
[9:06] each one for all your patience
[9:08] in the process but i'm i'm looking
[9:10] forward to what god has for us
[9:12] you know we're we're going through
[9:13] growing pains
[9:15] and so we just ask that you bear with us
[9:16] we're just gonna ask brother mike to
[9:18] come at this time
[9:19] and have a little psalm reading so let's
[9:21] just go ahead and stand we'll just open
[9:23] in a word of prayer as he would make his
[9:25] way heavenly father
[9:26] we love you we're thankful that we have
[9:28] another opportunity to gather together
[9:30] lord and just be able to sing the songs
[9:32] of zion and to be able to be in an
[9:34] atmosphere lord knowing that you're here
[9:36] with us
[9:37] and we're looking forward to the word
[9:39] that you have prepared for us knowing
[9:41] that this is a predestinated moment in
[9:42] time we're just asking lord for the
[9:44] anointing of our precious brother
[9:46] raphael and brother billy as he would
[9:48] interpret the word lord our hearts are
[9:49] excited with great expectation for you
[9:52] just to move in a mighty way lord and
[9:54] speak the words that you would have to
[9:56] each one individually lord we love you
[9:58] lord we just commit the service now to
[10:00] you in jesus christ's name we pray
[10:02] amen
[10:04] amen brother mike
[11:48] to be
[11:49] a bad thing
[11:51] until you get a little bit of light on
[11:53] it
[11:53] and it turns out
[11:55] it's good
[11:56] and something may appear very good
[11:59] you're safe
[12:01] or comfortable you get a little bit of
[12:02] light on it
[12:04] and it turns out it's maybe not so good
[12:10] the entrance of thy words
[12:13] giveth light
[12:15] it was interesting that in genesis 1 3
[12:19] when god was first
[12:21] bringing the world to manifestation
[12:36] and we live in a dark age you know i
[12:39] don't
[12:40] suppose that's news to anyone here
[12:44] you know the circumstances around us are
[12:46] such that there's all kinds of things
[12:48] that are
[12:49] you know seeming to offer light
[12:53] seeming to offer guidance and things can
[12:55] wear any kind of
[12:57] camouflage look like they're good a way
[13:00] may look good some advice may look good
[13:04] but the entrance of thy words given it
[13:07] says in first corinthians 4 5
[13:10] therefore judge nothing before the time
[13:12] until the lord come
[13:15] who both will bring to light
[13:18] the hidden things of darkness
[13:20] and we'll make many of us the council
[13:24] of the hearts
[13:26] you know we're not careful we can
[13:29] lean on something else
[13:31] to give us a little bit of light
[13:34] guidance
[13:35] clarity
[13:37] in this dark hour
[13:39] the google search
[13:42] the advice
[13:43] or counsel of friends
[13:47] an expected career path
[13:49] or curriculum
[13:53] probably the worst
[13:55] our own discernment
[13:57] how we feel
[14:00] whether we get a tingle or not
[14:03] our emotions probably the worst guide
[14:06] there is in this dark age
[14:10] and i heard a person the other day on a
[14:12] christian radio station saying
[14:16] time and needs a path forward all she
[14:18] does is
[14:20] worship and then all of a sudden her
[14:21] path becomes clear
[14:23] well be careful
[14:25] you know who the chief worshiper has
[14:27] always been
[14:28] in every age
[14:30] and as we read in psalm 119 it's his
[14:33] word
[14:34] not your worship
[14:36] that bringeth light
[14:40] you know there can be no light without
[14:42] his word
[14:45] if you don't have his words then it's
[14:47] just darkness
[14:48] then it's just no guidance at all
[14:53] it says first john 1 5 this then is the
[14:55] message which we have heard of him and
[14:57] declare unto you that god is light
[15:00] that's right and in him is no darkness
[15:03] at all
[15:04] you know i was just reading that and i
[15:06] don't know about you but i sure need
[15:07] light
[15:09] i sure need his words
[15:11] to give me light to help me see
[15:14] and get clarity in this dark hour but
[15:17] you know as i was looking at that it one
[15:19] other thing stuck out to me you know
[15:21] there's an effect
[15:22] that his light has
[15:24] on us
[15:26] it makes us sources of light
[15:31] you know it says that
[15:33] for ye were sometimes darkness
[15:36] in ephesians 5
[15:37] but now are ye light in the lord
[15:41] walk ye according to the light
[15:45] think about that if his words give
[15:47] illumination
[15:49] then if you become light
[15:51] then how what should the effect of us be
[15:55] if we have become light
[15:57] jesus said ye are the light of the world
[16:02] it doesn't say that uh you know it says
[16:04] let your light so shine before men it's
[16:06] matthew 5 16. you want to take it down
[16:09] that they may see your good works
[16:12] not just hear what you say
[16:15] but see your works
[16:19] your words can say anything you can
[16:21] speak any message
[16:24] but light is something people see
[16:26] not something they hear
[16:29] and words without light
[16:32] are just words
[16:35] amen
[16:37] i wonder
[16:39] how often we get focused on the telling
[16:42] the good news
[16:44] we forget about the showing
[16:48] you know the scripture says in first
[16:50] peter 3 15 be ready always to give an
[16:53] answer to every man that asketh you
[16:56] the hope that lieth within you
[16:59] i had to ask myself how many times has
[17:00] somebody actually asked me
[17:03] without me having to tell them first
[17:06] [Music]
[17:07] the effect of the light is as it gives
[17:10] illumination his words
[17:12] the entrance of his words
[17:14] giveth light
[17:16] you know as i was reading that
[17:19] this this weekend you know my prayer was
[17:22] first of all i need light
[17:24] how precious are his words
[17:27] but also that
[17:28] it should have an effect
[17:30] and i should be light
[17:32] such that folks can ask me
[17:36] the reason for the hope that lieth
[17:38] within you
[17:39] let's just read that little portion of
[17:41] psalm 119 together
[17:43] we're going to be starting in verses 129
[17:45] and ending on 136 let's read that
[17:47] together thy testimonies are wonderful
[17:51] therefore doth my soul keep them
[17:53] the entrance of thy words giveth light
[17:56] it giveth understanding unto the simple
[17:58] i opened my mouth and panted for i
[18:01] longed for thy commandments
[18:03] look thou upon me and be merciful unto
[18:06] me as thou usest to do unto those that
[18:09] love thy name
[18:10] order my steps in thy word and let not
[18:13] any iniquity have dominion over me
[18:16] deliver me from the oppression of man
[18:18] so will i keep thy precepts make thy
[18:21] face to shine upon thy servant and teach
[18:24] me thy statutes rivers of waters run
[18:27] down mine eyes because they keep not thy
[18:30] law amen
[18:37] amen praise the lord you may have your
[18:39] seats
[18:40] i wanted to sing that song
[18:42] jesus hold my hand in the key of f
[18:45] i need thee every hour

[34:30] we'll just use this opportunity to take
[34:31] up the ties and offerings if maybe we
[34:33] can play that song i cleaned the blood
[34:35] in key of f
[34:37] and then
[34:39] take up the ties and offerings and sing
[34:41] this song
[34:42] sister sharon tub with her song special
[34:45] we do have a couple uh
[34:55] [Music]
[34:59] in order in the
[35:00] service
[35:02] how many are going to pray for sister
[35:04] rebecca's unspoken request
[35:08] these are moments
[35:10] that god provides us
[35:13] because the scripture says the prayer of
[35:15] a righteous man
[35:16] your prayer makes a difference
[35:18] and many times we don't realize that
[35:20] god's wanting to use us to be the
[35:22] difference maker
[35:24] i believe god works like that
[35:26] amen so i just want to i don't want to
[35:28] let this go by because i say i'm guilty
[35:30] many times
[35:32] come forth
[35:33] and i'm not able to hear and sometimes
[35:35] with the sound and everything if
[35:37] you're not able to
[35:38] hear the request
[35:40] i think it would be a responsible thing
[35:42] maybe after service to maybe ask
[35:44] somebody what what are we praying for
[35:46] there needs to be a unity amongst the
[35:48] church and we also just want to remember
[35:50] uh sister lori she's at home with a
[35:51] headache some severe headache and if any
[35:54] of y'all have ever suffered like that
[35:56] let's just
[35:57] bear together
[35:58] amen
[36:00] praise the lord
[36:02] troy why don't you just come and
[36:04] take these

[47:28] out there and be able to start parking
[47:30] and
[47:31] and but it's going to be a process and
[47:35] i i know it's going to be hard and but
[47:38] if you'll be patient we'll make it
[47:40] through it and
[47:42] and i think the outcome will be a
[47:44] blessing
[47:45] and
[47:46] we're
[47:47] we're
[47:49] putting a little extra room in our

[47:54] amen we want new converts that's what
[47:57] our hearts desire is just to have
[48:00] new converts and that people might know
[48:03] you know this message is ever more true
[48:05] every day
[48:07] because more and more of the things that
[48:09] have been prophesied
[48:11] are certainly coming to pass
[48:14] so i'd also like to make a little
[48:16] announcement next sunday

[48:58] brother cosman and brother matthew
[49:00] they're traveling to romania tuesday for
[49:04] youth meetings and services and we just
[49:06] trust that uh the lord will be with them
[49:09] so they go as part of you
[49:12] this you know our messenger told us if
[49:15] you can't go yourself send somebody
[49:18] so you send your prayers with them
[49:20] they'll be successful maybe the last
[49:22] one's over there
[49:24] wouldn't it be wonderful in the middle
[49:27] of the meeting some little soul comes to
[49:29] the altar and kneels down gives their
[49:31] heart to the lord and we all leave

[50:12] help us as a deacon
[50:14] and you'll see him playing the role of a
[50:17] deacon
[50:18] and

[51:15] spirit so you really enjoy him so let's
[51:18] stand this morning once again
[51:21] as we prepare to change the
[51:25] order of the service and i'd like to
[51:27] read the scripture

[51:33] the gospel of saint john
[51:37] these are very comforting scriptures so

[51:42] and because sometimes discouragement
[51:47] blinds you or closes your ears
[51:51] from seeing
[51:52] the hope that god gives you
[51:55] so i don't care this morning what kind
[51:57] of condition you're in
[51:59] what kind of sins you have on your chart

[52:05] and he paid a price and he can break
[52:08] through
[52:09] every
[52:10] every bar every wall
[52:14] everything that satan has put up against
[52:17] you he can break through it
[52:20] if you'll just incline your
[52:23] ears
[52:24] to his word
[52:26] so just listen for him to talk to you
[52:28] this morning he'll lift you up but these
[52:31] scriptures are found in saint john
[52:34] the 10th chapter
[52:36] and the 27th verse

[52:47] 26th verse he says
[52:50] but ye believe not
[52:52] because ye are not of my sheep
[52:57] as i have said unto you now listen to
[53:00] this
[53:01] great verse

[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:55] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:11:58] gave unto him to show
[1:12:01] unto his servants things that which must
[1:12:03] come shortly come to pass and that he
[1:12:06] ascend and signify it by his angel unto
[1:12:09] his servant john
[1:12:12] paul
[1:12:16] who bear record of the word of god and
[1:12:19] of the testimony of jesus christ of all
[1:12:21] things that he saw
[1:12:32] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[1:12:35] they hear it the word of this prophecy
[1:12:38] and keeps those things which are written
[1:12:41] therein for the time is at hand could
[1:12:44] you believe this
[1:12:45] blessing to the reading of his words
[1:13:01] that the blessing is for those that
[1:13:03] reads
[1:13:09] that hear and keep the words of the
[1:13:11] things that are written
[1:13:16] and we know that we become what we eat
[1:13:21] and i want this morning
[1:13:27] to speak just for a few moments for a
[1:13:30] delicate subject
[1:13:37] about christianity that the world would
[1:13:40] love to see
[1:13:42] christianism
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:14:01] there is a great proliferation or an
[1:14:04] increase of church of christian churches
[1:14:13] in all the cities in all the towns
[1:14:16] christian churches are multiplying
[1:14:20] the diversions
[1:14:23] they all have differences
[1:14:25] is
[1:14:32] and in their differences they all claim
[1:14:34] to have the only true
[1:14:36] and original faith of the bible
[1:14:43] and and for that they are waging a war
[1:14:46] of influence
[1:14:51] each church wants to be on top of the
[1:14:53] other church
[1:15:09] and an honest man who is really looking
[1:15:11] and wanting to be honest with his own
[1:15:13] heart we say but don't kill iglesias he
[1:15:16] doesn't know what church to go to
[1:15:23] but we all know that if there is a bogus
[1:15:25] or a counterfeit bill of 100 dollars
[1:15:32] it cannot exist unless there was a true
[1:15:35] and original bill somewhere that this
[1:15:38] one was a copy of
[1:15:40] me
[1:15:42] the the bogus dollar is an imitation of
[1:15:44] the truth
[1:15:48] you know you have to know that they
[1:15:50] cannot be a bogus unless the truth
[1:15:52] existed first
[1:15:55] that's why
[1:16:00] the confusion and the agitation that
[1:16:03] exists among christians today
[1:16:06] is not bothering christians
[1:16:12] and they know that god leads his own
[1:16:15] malchetes
[1:16:21] regardless of what happened here and
[1:16:22] there the the the true the elected ones
[1:16:25] they know that god is always in charge
[1:16:30] and god is the word not an imagination
[1:16:42] the lord himself talked about the things
[1:16:44] that had to happen in this time in
[1:16:46] matthew chapter 24.
[1:16:50] it says they will arise false christ
[1:16:53] and the false prophet
[1:16:55] the full one the
[1:16:57] false anointed ones
[1:17:01] they don't have a fake anointing
[1:17:06] they have a true anointing may suffer
[1:17:09] but they are they are they are false
[1:17:14] judas had
[1:17:26] that's why when you see people uh they
[1:17:29] they try to oh jesus
[1:17:31] jesus never invented himself the for
[1:17:34] prophet defoe
[1:17:36] the uh false uh prophets are false
[1:17:38] teachers
[1:17:43] they will do great signs and wonders and
[1:17:46] there would be even a point where they
[1:17:48] would uh uh
[1:17:49] deceive the elect if it was possible
[1:17:53] they think the only thing that assures
[1:17:54] us
[1:18:13] because he knew them and predestinated
[1:18:15] them before the foundation of the world
[1:18:21] the elect the elected they are very
[1:18:24] sensitive to the purity of the word
[1:18:29] brought forth to help the elected
[1:18:33] and to lift up the faith
[1:18:38] we are not bringing the word to so to
[1:18:41] show how much we know
[1:18:43] excellent
[1:18:45] oh how much we excel in this or that
[1:18:49] we bring the word
[1:18:52] used to help the children of god
[1:18:54] and to lift up the faith
[1:18:58] to connect them to the creator
[1:19:00] not to ourselves
[1:19:02] we are just past
[1:19:04] the man by him he abides
[1:19:11] the son and daughter of god will come to
[1:19:13] god situation
[1:19:15] if you if you attach yourself to god to
[1:19:18] respect her you will respect me
[1:19:27] your connection to god will impose the
[1:19:29] respect to the servants of god
[1:19:32] lazy
[1:19:36] the elected are only looking to the
[1:19:38] infallible word made manifest in this
[1:19:41] time
[1:19:45] god spoke in this age and we know it's
[1:19:47] god who spoke
[1:19:55] they are impacted and influenced by the
[1:19:58] word of god papa
[1:20:00] no not by uh cannons
[1:20:03] [Music]
[1:20:06] channel not by not by the channel okay
[1:20:13] not by the channel that god is using me
[1:20:15] if you wanna see par do you remember
[1:20:18] they are influenced by god himself who's
[1:20:20] the word
[1:20:23] that's what the elected or the elected
[1:20:25] are looking
[1:20:29] something is about to happen in this
[1:20:31] world they know
[1:20:34] and there's no way to stop it
[1:20:40] it's it's it's it's useless to hide
[1:20:42] behind religion
[1:20:44] there
[1:20:46] or to fill yourself up with religious
[1:20:48] rituals
[1:20:51] to try to show how much we are
[1:20:53] christians
[1:20:58] there is only one way to escape the
[1:21:00] judgment that's going to hit the earth
[1:21:04] and it's to find a shore refuge
[1:21:10] and the only the only refuge or the only
[1:21:12] hiding place that i know of
[1:21:14] christ
[1:21:17] and it's christ the word becoming flesh
[1:21:20] in you
[1:21:26] that's the thing that will impact the
[1:21:28] world and it will influence it
[1:21:38] all of our arrogance so how we know how
[1:21:41] we believe the message of william
[1:21:42] branham that will not help
[1:21:45] jesus
[1:21:46] sir i believe my brother my sister
[1:21:49] actually that this generation
[1:21:53] is the generation that will see the
[1:21:55] second coming of the lord
[1:22:00] the modern events in the whole world
[1:22:03] negan
[1:22:04] uh wars la criminality uh uh criminality
[1:22:08] or corruption
[1:22:22] it shows that we are at the end time
[1:22:26] we are at the end of mankind's history
[1:22:31] we are at the evening of the
[1:22:33] civilization of humans
[1:22:35] and soon do you remember
[1:22:41] god himself will enter into the scene
[1:22:44] through the church or his own church
[1:22:47] god will enter into sin
[1:22:57] to restore adam's race to the very
[1:22:59] condition that they were in the
[1:23:00] beginning
[1:23:03] and i believe the world vive
[1:23:06] it wants to see a living christianity
[1:23:11] like it was in the time of the apostle
[1:23:14] and this word
[1:23:16] it's bringing us right back to the
[1:23:18] apostolic times
[1:23:20] it dropped it doesn't have to be a shame
[1:23:24] or something that we are just saying
[1:23:29] it's a life that we leave that shows
[1:23:31] that we are being brought right back
[1:23:33] into the apostolic times
[1:23:37] the the evening light has come
[1:23:43] and human civilization has come to an
[1:23:45] end i believe that
[1:23:47] fanduemund it's the end of the world
[1:23:49] celebrities it's the end of the church
[1:23:53] i don't believe in churches
[1:23:55] i believe in jesus christ
[1:24:00] i don't bring people into my church so
[1:24:03] that i can have them
[1:24:04] stay there
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:10] i preach them the word that can make
[1:24:13] them free sons and daughters
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:17] we don't insist
[1:24:20] that people may need to be behind us
[1:24:23] we'd have nothing to give them
[1:24:26] what we want
[1:24:28] that people may meet christ satisfying
[1:24:31] that they may hang on to him
[1:24:33] and that they become new creatures
[1:24:39] that they may be a living a a
[1:24:42] gospel for the world that we are living
[1:24:44] in
[1:24:45] you clement
[1:24:49] i believe the same sun that rose in the
[1:24:51] east is the same sun that's that's
[1:24:53] setting on the west do you apologize
[1:24:56] god promised by the prophet zechariah
[1:25:01] that in the evening time the light will
[1:25:03] come
[1:25:05] the same son
[1:25:08] that came that rose to the east el m
[1:25:25] who rose up and manifested the holy
[1:25:28] ghost through jesus christ of nazareth
[1:25:30] elementary school
[1:25:32] it's the same episode who's shining in
[1:25:34] the west
[1:25:36] in the same time montreal
[1:25:41] showing the same signs that jesus christ
[1:25:44] give prophecies about
[1:25:46] ivan
[1:25:47] what happened to the time of noah
[1:25:52] manifesto
[1:26:13] it was christ himself who was on the
[1:26:15] scene on the body of flesh
[1:26:18] the angel who visited abraham
[1:26:22] and who made himself
[1:26:24] two thousand years ago
[1:26:29] it's the same angel who brought forth
[1:26:31] this message
[1:26:34] it's not the message of william branham
[1:26:38] it's the message of god through william
[1:26:40] branham and she comes
[1:26:42] and then when i read the message
[1:26:45] i hear god speak to me
[1:26:54] and that can play a bigger role in your
[1:26:56] life
[1:27:02] you know
[1:27:04] the grand immigration shows the great
[1:27:07] and wonderful things
[1:27:10] they were fulfilled in the supernatural
[1:27:12] ministry of buddhism
[1:27:16] until this uh messenger messenger
[1:27:19] prophet is
[1:27:23] jesus christ he was even confused and
[1:27:26] compared to jesus christ
[1:27:28] baptism or nun
[1:27:30] people
[1:27:32] people baptized in the name of william
[1:27:34] branham and the prey in the name of
[1:27:36] william branagh
[1:27:38] but we know the prophet
[1:27:42] but we know that the prophet was
[1:27:44] revealing these son of man who's christ
[1:27:46] don't let the ensemble message me crew
[1:27:50] whom he was just a simple messenger just
[1:27:52] like a microphone
[1:27:57] when john the writer of the book of
[1:27:59] revelation
[1:28:02] when he was about to write what the
[1:28:04] seven thunders were saying
[1:28:06] the angel told them
[1:28:10] seal up what the seven cells as the
[1:28:12] seven thunders have broken and don't
[1:28:13] write it
[1:28:17] but in the day when the seventh angel
[1:28:20] will sound of his trump download
[1:28:24] in the seventh church age
[1:28:27] the seven church ages which we are in
[1:28:29] today
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:33] and all the mysteries of god and all the
[1:28:35] subject about god
[1:28:39] how god is not a trinity man
[1:28:41] and one just one god
[1:28:45] because the jehovah of the old testament
[1:28:47] says jesus
[1:28:49] is jesus of the new year
[1:28:52] and all the other things devoted
[1:28:56] they had to be tied up in the voice of
[1:28:59] the seventh angel malaysia
[1:29:02] malachite 4 gathered up
[1:29:08] all the uh teachings and all the things
[1:29:10] that were suspended and
[1:29:12] and there were uh wrongly thoughts in
[1:29:15] the old testament
[1:29:17] the the seventh uh the serpent seed la
[1:29:20] trinity the the holy trinity la divinity
[1:29:23] supreme jesus christ the the the deity
[1:29:27] supreme deity of jesus christ
[1:29:30] the baptism of jesus christ of
[1:29:32] the holy ghost
[1:29:35] and today through this message
[1:29:39] we have seen the power of god in action
[1:29:42] long as you preach on long just celestia
[1:29:45] a powerful angel the heavenly uh
[1:29:48] celestial angel who's jesus christ
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:30:04] two messengers on earth at the same time
[1:30:07] just like in the time of
[1:30:08] john the baptist
[1:30:13] a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:30:15] who was using him
[1:30:19] and i believe that you have the eyes
[1:30:23] the spiritual eyes to understand those
[1:30:25] things jesus
[1:30:28] jesus christ is incomparable
[1:30:33] isaiah 40
[1:30:36] isaiah 40 and verse 25
[1:30:42] it says to whom will he liken me
[1:30:47] we are serving an incomparable a god
[1:30:50] who's not like the others
[1:30:53] we have our faith our trust in him
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:30:57] and we are not afraid of anything
[1:31:01] we want to throw ourselves into his arms
[1:31:04] you see i want you to remember this
[1:31:06] nippiness yeah mainly shows a man never
[1:31:09] take things in your own hands see who
[1:31:11] penelope
[1:31:13] if you take things in your own hands
[1:31:25] but know to give yourselves into the
[1:31:27] hands of god
[1:31:45] that is supposed to show the true face
[1:31:48] of christianity to the world
[1:31:52] it's become a trampoline for people
[1:31:55] seeking opportunities
[1:31:58] and they make the word of god the lapse
[1:32:00] of non-effect les opportuniste the
[1:32:03] opportunist on this objective they have
[1:32:06] uh objectives on the motif they have
[1:32:08] motives
[1:32:10] and
[1:32:33] in these days people are using the
[1:32:35] message
[1:32:38] if they don't want the message to use
[1:32:40] them all the messages say dude or the
[1:32:43] message is god talk to the people you to
[1:32:46] listen you cannot use god
[1:32:52] but give yourself to god and let him use
[1:32:55] you so you can be an instrument in his
[1:32:57] hands
[1:32:58] but today
[1:33:02] people want to use god as an instrument
[1:33:04] into their hands
[1:33:06] it's not going to work it's not going to
[1:33:07] go far
[1:33:10] it's also a sign of the end times
[1:33:14] the coming of the lord as it is at hand

[1:34:06] sister the message that's the message of
[1:34:08] william brown basically do you because
[1:34:10] it's god
[1:34:12] god literally loved the world
[1:34:16] god loves the sinners
[1:34:18] but he hates the sin
[1:34:24] it's a message that helps the sinner to
[1:34:26] get into the word
[1:34:33] the supernatural god who made himself
[1:34:35] tangible in the message of william
[1:34:36] burnham
[1:34:41] it has to capture the heart of the elect
[1:34:59] when it's brought with a pure heart to
[1:35:01] help
[1:35:04] and it's correctly received
[1:35:09] this message will stabilizes the members
[1:35:12] of the bride
[1:35:14] the elected lady is stable
[1:35:19] not to turn to new things
[1:35:22] la popularity popularity
[1:35:25] are honors
[1:35:40] all kinds of carnal pressures that
[1:35:42] people are enjoying today
[1:35:45] and they take a form of religious
[1:35:47] activity
[1:35:52] it's not in the heart of the elected
[1:35:54] lady
[1:36:20] [Applause]
[1:36:50] just with a different function than what

[1:37:02] and every member of that body has a
[1:37:04] position

[1:37:30] and we have received everything by grace
[1:37:33] the minister the ministry

[1:38:24] children of israel

[1:39:51] just the atmosphere
[1:39:58] and she measured me and then my my
[1:40:00] friends
[1:40:02] sacrifice
[1:40:05] there's no sacredness even among those
[1:40:07] that believe this message
[1:40:11] there's no there's no the the respect of
[1:40:14] the visible respect
[1:40:18] there's the believers of this precious
[1:40:19] message
[1:40:33] so that the world may see the
[1:40:35] resurrected christ
[1:40:39] we believe in the christ who's alive
[1:40:42] because he's resurrected
[1:40:45] we're not telling stories
[1:40:47] we're not talking about the past year
[1:40:50] because it's the same yesterday today
[1:40:52] and foreign
[1:40:56] that we want to present to the world
[1:40:58] today
[1:41:00] hello mr me then my friend
[1:41:10] what that one said or what this one says
[1:41:12] that the message has not said
[1:41:18] we should have been happy with malachite
[1:41:20] four only
[1:41:24] there's not a great one somewhere who's
[1:41:26] supposed to tell us what we're supposed
[1:41:28] to do
[1:41:29] what we're supposed to do
[1:41:45] this message and let me say in its
[1:41:46] purity
[1:41:50] is revealing the presence of god in the
[1:41:52] believers
[1:41:56] they are people that are coming for the
[1:41:58] first time
[1:41:59] just the atmosphere just the atmosphere
[1:42:03] it changes the condition
[1:42:07] atmosphere why the atmosphere was
[1:42:09] something
[1:42:10] we are not denominationals
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:43] we don't pay attention to the presence
[1:42:44] of god where we are in the sanctuary
[1:42:48] those people that are coming they're not
[1:42:50] coming to see a man even personally
[1:42:53] they come because god has spoken and
[1:42:56] that god whose fault
[1:42:58] he didn't go with william branham
[1:43:02] he's here
[1:43:04] so he can do a lot of things
[1:43:25] where sons and daughters of god are
[1:43:27] connected to the word of god
[1:43:29] christianity uh christ is coming back
[1:43:31] soon
[1:43:33] so he could take the his bride who's
[1:43:35] become the word
[1:43:40] he's giving us the faith of the rapture
[1:43:42] because soon will be taken out
[1:43:44] and i believe
[1:43:46] it's by the voice of the seven thunders
[1:44:16] that's what god said that the bride's
[1:44:18] supposed to take
[1:44:20] it
[1:44:25] only
[1:44:27] i i want you to be built up in the
[1:44:30] city
[1:44:32] the holy oracles
[1:44:34] of god in the faith love for the sitters
[1:44:38] the faith of this hour
[1:44:40] la for faith
[1:44:42] preach the it's going to take more
[1:44:45] faith
[1:44:47] that there never was in any age
[1:44:51] as
[1:44:52] in the other ages
[1:44:53] the reformation reformers they zoomed
[1:44:57] men who were thinking
[1:44:59] no but now say do you remember
[1:45:06] it's not william branham speaking
[1:45:09] it's god himself speaking of simplicity
[1:45:11] in the simplicity
[1:45:18] it's going to take more faith than we
[1:45:19] ever had in any age
[1:45:23] for it has to be rapturing faith put it
[1:45:25] on living to be taken out
[1:45:28] and show what we want
[1:45:31] we want that you believe what you
[1:45:33] believe tonight
[1:45:35] in all that you have seen mountain dew
[1:45:38] heard
[1:45:41] the word that you have heard preach
[1:45:47] the signs and the wonders that you have
[1:45:49] seen done
[1:45:54] that you accumulate all this together in
[1:45:57] your heart
[1:45:58] and consider it
[1:46:01] whether it's god or not
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:05] she said you if it's god or not
[1:46:08] i believe it's god
[1:46:21] he said if god is if god be god then
[1:46:24] serve him this is jesus
[1:46:28] and if jesus is the center of all things
[1:46:30] for the christians
[1:46:34] is he the center of all things for you
[1:46:39] it has to be that way
[1:46:44] if you want to go forward with god it
[1:46:46] has to be that way
[1:46:48] it has to be the center for your of your
[1:46:50] life it seems really something to choose
[1:46:53] and if jesus is the center of all things
[1:46:56] to the to the christians
[1:47:01] then i think we are we are let loose of
[1:47:03] everything else
[1:47:06] and cliff to him
[1:47:20] he is
[1:47:42] and the word always points to him
[1:47:46] william branham declares
[1:47:59] and the word always points to him people
[1:48:02] not to a man
[1:48:04] not to a group of men
[1:48:07] not to a tendency no no
[1:48:10] you'll remain with the word
[1:48:13] because god is always a guide
[1:48:20] let me say this the true christianity
[1:48:22] that the world is looking for
[1:48:25] identification
[1:48:27] is conditioned by the identification to
[1:48:29] christ
[1:48:45] it's possible to anyone who wants it say
[1:48:47] gratuity it's it's free
[1:48:50] whichever want
[1:48:52] can
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:10] the life the visible life that we live
[1:49:12] among men
[1:49:15] is testifying of what about what's
[1:49:18] inside of you yes
[1:49:25] when we try to imitate what we don't
[1:49:27] have a fabric
[1:49:31] or to fabricate humility and the fruits
[1:49:33] of the spirits
[1:49:37] it always turns out to be hypocrisy to
[1:49:39] our side el
[1:49:43] and the christian world is full of
[1:49:45] hypocrisy
[1:49:47] but the word the message is here
[1:49:50] so it can bring us out of that
[1:49:54] you cannot fabricate christianity look
[1:49:57] it's an eastman christianity
[1:50:03] it's a life subject to the spirit that
[1:50:06] lives within us and it automatically
[1:50:08] brings out fruits le frivian automatic
[1:50:11] monsters they fall fruits comes
[1:50:13] automatically without any efforts
[1:50:16] and then there's no way to fabricate it
[1:50:21] many people try christianity
[1:50:27] most tried to get into the prayer line
[1:50:29] they've ever assisted foreign i will see
[1:50:32] if this time god is going to heal
[1:50:35] you don't try um
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:52] and there are people that are most
[1:50:54] unstable and always floating
[1:50:57] wait
[1:50:58] yes
[1:51:00] to to try christianity
[1:51:04] it's to remain unstable
[1:51:08] it's to remain floating yes you see oh
[1:51:11] there's something over there you go yes
[1:51:13] they show this over there you go
[1:51:16] that's not a christian
[1:51:27] he knows who he is and whom he has
[1:51:30] believed in in a float path he doesn't
[1:51:32] float
[1:51:41] the christianity you don't get to try it
[1:51:46] it's a lived
[1:51:54] god looks at you as an individual
[1:52:04] what this member did or what the pastor
[1:52:06] did here does not affect the true member
[1:52:09] oh legalization oh that church
[1:52:13] i command you i'm sorry today
[1:52:52] it's not a group of people or a
[1:52:53] denomination look it's an ism the
[1:52:56] christianity

[1:53:03] under the influence of the holy ghost
[1:53:07] the pastor preaches to me the word
[1:53:12] it's a man with his own mistakes medulla
[1:53:15] but god placed him there

[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:50] i like to say things the way they are i
[1:53:53] think it is also unnecessary
[1:53:55] so people are honest when they are
[1:53:57] sitting there

[1:55:06] and i said
[1:55:10] i have never said that i was a healer
[1:55:15] i never said i could heal
[1:55:30] [Music]

[1:57:47] right after philip was saved
[1:57:52] he went to find somebody else his friend
[1:57:56] it was a good sign that he was saved
[1:58:01] and christianism when he went to look
[1:58:03] for somebody else that's what
[1:58:05] christianity is about lucianism
[1:58:07] christianity
[1:58:11] it's not what the i see or what we

[2:11:48] we don't need everything to work just
[2:11:50] perfectly
[2:11:52] [Music]
[2:12:18] what god is thinking about me
[2:12:21] that's what i think that's what i placed
[2:12:23] my thinking on right
[2:12:26] libra when things are floating liberally
[2:12:30] remember
[2:12:47] you will you will be falling down into
[2:12:49] the the the the fall and you will
[2:12:52] continue with the world
[2:12:54] you will flout with the world
[2:12:56] it's easy lieutenant the the train of
[2:12:59] the world cinema
[2:13:00] no
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:06] but you have to assume your
[2:13:08] responsibility
[2:13:10] and as christians what responsibility
[2:13:12] your responsibility
[2:13:28] in believing
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:56] it's him that's asking you
[2:13:59] on the second question
[2:14:05] he says
[2:14:07] and then after that it says
[2:14:09] right and you're looking at
[2:14:12] christ christ
[2:14:15] when he was reviled
[2:14:18] he reviled not against heaven

[2:14:34] is that right
[2:14:35] lucas and his christianity celebrity
[2:14:40] it's the life that a man lives
[2:14:43] personally it's a personal experience
[2:14:49] we can conclude now
[2:14:52] the secretary
[2:14:54] but we have various and diverse versions
[2:14:57] of what people call christianity
[2:15:02] but there's only one christianity
[2:15:06] it's not a denomination
[2:15:11] it's not what a preacher or or what a

[2:54:22] christianity this morning
[2:54:24] what it is
[2:54:25] [Music]
[2:54:27] as he read i wrote a few notes
[2:54:29] [Music]
[2:54:32] and i wrote this this
[2:54:34] morning and
[2:54:37] and i hope that it
[2:54:40] sticks with you in the simplicity
[2:54:43] [Music]
[2:54:44] that it is
[2:54:47] christianity
[2:54:48] is the possession
[2:54:50] [Music]
[2:54:51] of the love
[2:54:53] of god
[2:54:55] that
[2:54:56] he loved you with
[2:55:02] if you would be
[2:55:04] to others
[2:55:06] what he was to you
[2:55:08] [Music]
[2:55:11] if you would love others the way he
[2:55:13] loved you
[2:55:18] christianity is possessing the
[2:55:19] forgiveness
[2:55:21] that he forgave you with
[2:55:24] [Music]
[2:55:27] just think of it
[2:55:31] christianity is possessing the kindness
[2:55:34] and the goodness that he showed to you
[2:55:39] christianity is to give
[2:55:42] what he gave you
[2:55:45] the best way to be christ-like is just
[2:55:47] to live the experience that you have
[2:55:50] with him
[2:55:52] i know god's forgive her
[2:55:57] you know i've never met a person and i
[2:55:59] don't believe that god
[2:56:01] [Music]
[2:56:02] can't save
[2:56:04] because i know what he saved me from
[2:56:08] i know how far he
[2:56:10] went down for me
[2:56:12] i know how much he loves me
[2:56:14] if i could love with that same love if i
[2:56:17] could forgive with that same forgiveness
[2:56:19] god's been good to me
[2:56:21] god been good
[2:56:24] if you can just be good the way he was
[2:56:26] good
[2:56:26] [Music]
[2:56:28] has he been kind
[2:56:32] if you could just be kind the way that
[2:56:34] he was be kind
[2:56:36] and then we can understand we're not
[2:56:38] we're not at war with the world
[2:56:41] we're at peace with god
[2:56:45] we don't fear the devil because we know
[2:56:48] that nothing can pluck us
[2:56:50] out of the palm
[2:56:53] if we could just go forth and let this
[2:56:55] love of god
[2:56:57] be shed abroad in our heart
[2:56:59] by the holy spirit
[2:57:01] and if our hearts desire
[2:57:03] is
[2:57:05] as i've freely given you freely give
[2:57:10] go into all the world

[3:00:56] knowing that you're the shepherd that's
[3:00:57] going to make the path for them
