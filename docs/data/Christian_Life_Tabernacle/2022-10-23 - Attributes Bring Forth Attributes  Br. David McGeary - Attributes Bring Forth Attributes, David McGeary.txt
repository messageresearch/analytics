you if you have your Bibles oh did that there's just enough of us here that I can invite everybody to Brahms after service and I'll buy you an ice cream I believe in the what they call that the reward uh you know if you the reward theory anyway whatever but that that that offers good and no latecomers you know you guys keep track if they aren't here and you see them at Brahms right amen let's just go into the word uh tonight and uh I'd like just to uh title this and talk on this this evening attributes manufacturing attributes or attributes manifesting attributes attributes manifesting attributes and for our first scripture I'd like to turn to uh uh John uh three the uh John uh the third chapter of John and the 16th verse of the third chapter of John and we'll read uh 14 15 and 16 together emphasizing the 16th verse they say that the John 3 16 is the most quoted and well-known verse in the Bible you look around the world and it certainly doesn't appear that way does it but uh it's such a great scripture it says as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so unless the son of man be lifted up and we know the story that the children of Israel were sick and ill and Moses bit that brass Serpent and lifted it up and they that looked upon it were well that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved amen and amen we could go into great depth taking those scriptures apart but we'll let's just pray and then we'll be seated our heavenly father bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated and then let's turn over to uh uh this uh seventh chapter of the Book of Matthew and um again uh talking about attributes manifesting attributes and let's just start with Matthew 7 and 7. and he says ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son asks bread will he give him a stone or if he asked a fish will give him a serpent if he then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even sow to them for this is the law and the prophets I hope that you can see that theme kind of the attributes Manny uh manifesting attributes how you want people to do to you do to them amen it says entering in at the Straight Gate for white is the gate and Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrowest away which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravenous wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree beareth fourth for every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewed down and cast in the the fire the fire whosoever for whether for by their fruits ye shall know them amen we just ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word and as we just talk about this just for a few minutes because we have a little project ahead of us that we've got to get right into right ice cream that's uh that's the agenda tonight so uh uh you know uh we're gonna get right into it if you might if you could go back to the message that we're reading out of just uh this morning and go uh to paragraph 240 and and the 243 and I I would like to uh uh read that um and then we're going to read a few scriptures out of the book of Galatians and and not be long and and so we talked about this morning we understand that the seed of God is placed within us and it was placed there before the foundation of the world and that seed that God put in there was what that we were really to be but because we've came into the world the way that we came into the world that we inherited another nature and we're born with that nature and we know that that nature is a carnal nature and because of that nature we were subject to that nature and the things of that nature act and so uh that was what we were and then we realized that God had another nature for us in his mind and that nature was contained within that seed and and we know that every tree bringeth forth and every seed bringeth forth of its kind so if it wasn't planted in there from the beginning there's no way that it can produce any other thing than what God intended it to do and so we know that we are his workmanship in Christ Jesus foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them so there's an allotment to us in apportion to us and that's what that we're seeking we're seeking what is that uh position and what is uh the role that I play and these next uh this next few paragraphs kind of um it puts on puts it into words in a way that gives beautifully put and so if we start with the uh uh the story the stories about the the little uh uh Eagle that we find in the chicken yard and we're real familiar with that story how that that that a little Eagle got taken from its nest and found itself growing up in the chicken yard and acting like the chicken but because the mother Eagle knew that she had a a baby she knew that she had an eagle somewhere that she went looking for it and so he placed that in the type that God knew he had Sons and Daughters he knew that he had planted that seed somewhere now we uh we know that he knew where he planted that seed because he was the one that planted it but then because he had that seed he went searching for that seed at to bring that seed to life and the only thing that could mix with the seed that he planted in you was the pure word of God because that that's what it is even though your mind we'll we'll take in all kinds of things and you're intellect we'll take in all kinds of things because that's what happened to Eve that was the Gateway uh to the decision that she made now Adam could have never made that decision that Eve made so we understand that God took that part out of Adam and we we went through that this morning and allowed that part to fall that he could manifest his attributes he could manifest the things that he was his attributes so that seed was never lost because it was recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life and nothing could take it off because so the and in doing that then he became Justified in letting you come into this condition because you were already secure in him in other words he was going to get you to where that you needed to be one way or the other now and we certainly don't want to kick our foot against the prick you know he finally looked at Paul he said Paul it's hard to fight against me you know it's hard for you to do what you're doing because this is not what I called you for now figure the shock to Paul right that that piece of a Pharisee above Pharisees he's a a scribe of scribes he's he's well versed he he tutored under gamalia he's zealous consumed with Zeal he's going out to put all these Heretics in prison and all of a sudden he gets knocked off a horse and he says Paul I've called you to preach the gospel to the Gentiles now when I grew up we called that a 360. yeah it's really 180 but we never called it 180 we weren't good at math all the kids said I I ran around with they all were dropouts anyway so Bree would say man he hung a 360. and there's that means he's going the opposite direction he just totally opposite of what that he was thinking to begin with and all of a sudden Paul's sitting there he had this one great big agenda but God had another plan for him and he tells him Paul it's hard to fight against the plan that I have it it it it don't work so he's going to do whatever that he God has to do he will do to bring you to what he predestinated you to be and so we talked about this that how that he allowed us to fall so he could manifest his attributes and therefore we understand that attributes manifest attributes his attributes towards us is going to bring forth attributes so let's just read this for here he says and so he talked about that eagle and and he says and this is what she said and this is paragraph 237 she said Son you don't belong in that group anyhow you belong to me your mind now can you just see the Lord saying that to you you don't belong in that condition you don't belong in that group you don't belong in that place you're mine why why how can he say that because you were his in the beginning you were with him in the beginning he says you're mine he said Mama that sounds real good how am I going to get out said just make a jump I'll catch you that's all you have tuned just make that jump and I'll catch you the anointed word of God being Vindicated before any man that's born to be a son of God with the predestinated germ in germ into him for this hour he'll see God's message as sure as there's a God in heaven Martin Luther sought for his Wesley saw it for his the Pentecostal saw it for his now what about you could they went in the denomination here is the word uh condemning it telling you what you have today and just exactly Malachi 4 and all those other promises for this hour what do you see what are you looking at amen here we are the real genuine Eagle hears my sheep know my voice The Stranger they'll not follow why that's a that's a thing why why are you placed into the conflict with the religious world they're all claiming Christ and you claim the Lord and you love the Lord and they all look at you like you're a cult and you say no if anything were as far as away from a cult as you can possibly be we've had a true vision of God's word we're really worshiping for what that he is with an understanding of his attributes the uh an understanding of what that he did a real true understanding of what a Kinsmen Redeemer meant they never could understand the Kinsmen Redeemer until the opening of the seals they couldn't understand the Journey of the church they couldn't understand the four horse riders that came up against the church and the four riders that went out and the four beasts that went out and fought against those horse riders they're oblivious to that they don't see it therefore because they can never enter into the freedom that we have as Christians they still struggle and carry the book that we talked about closing this morning They Carried that book forever looking to the time that they come into judgment hoping that their good works out do their bad works and that they will be judged to be saved but the bride she doesn't enter into judgment she's judged already she's already proved that she's an Eagle and not a chicken because she saw the heard the voice and that's what identified her that's the identification that the germ seed that God put in you from the beginning is to hear the voice not a second-hand voice not a second-hand Revelation not the voice explained not me telling you like I'm doing now and reading it to you and putting there so you can read it at least I'm giving you the uh place to go hear it for yourself because we have that ability but yet these quotes are the word expressed so if you read them and hear them you blessed is he that heareth the words in this book and and that you can read the words of this book and God can speak to you through Revelation so I'm not just talking about audibly hearing right anybody can hear hearing doesn't mean here it means he that understandeth these things so when you see it here and you read it and you understand it this is the way that that the proof of that that that seeds in you it's the only identification it's got my sheep know my voice my sheep know my word my sheep hear my voice that in other words they understand what I'm saying isn't that beautiful there's something inside of you that if you hear the message or the hour you read the message or the hour someone shares with you something there's just something in your heart that plays like a melody it's so beautiful it's so beautiful it he says why it was put in there by predestination you were foreordained to a son of God you were in God before the foundation of the world your only manifested in this day for his honor and Glory how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God yes sir which you are a part of that word by predestination oh not by anything we did but not by will not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord because look the God is the word you believe it amen well then he always was the word in the beginning was the word and if the Word was God then you were in God the word in the word the part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world he seen you he knew you he predestinated you to it what did he predestinate you to he predestinated you to the role that you're to play now therefore we're talking about attributes manifesting attributes all this the prophet of God said that you are the attributes of God that's what you are you're the attributes of God you're part of the word of God and you have a part to play now that's the journey that quickly pointed out this morning was that that maturity that each of us wants to grow into is that maturity of being that part of God's word that he wants me to be and not comparing myself to anybody else that's a real freedom of that the Liberty that we have in Christ Jesus is that we don't have to measure up to anything but the Revelation that's in our heart oh my if I had to measure up to anything other than his Mercy I'd be in trouble wouldn't you like going down the manufacturing line and they call out the the bad product and the wrinkled product and the stuff like that well I'd never make it to the end of the line Here Comes this whole wrinkled up bin up old thing down the line and every time they're going to throw it off the belt Mercy Grace why why you let this thing go through it's predestinated to make the end of the journey oh that makes me feel good I don't put a shout in your heart he predestinated to you I tell you just as the eagle recognized that voice so does a real borned again Christian recognizing the voice of God speaking through the word when they see it anointed and Vindicated why how can we take this out of our existence this word it's it's it's a complete thing from beginning and end he's Alpha and Omega he's the bikini in the end he started it he finishes it he that starts the work will stay with it and complete it till the end that's the promise that we have nothing complexes out of the palm of his hand that's a promise we have so the work that he's doing that work is already set it's eternally set he's Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last the work of God is already set the plan of God is already set the method of God is already set man cannot fool with it that's what he said you can't fool with nature says every town man does it if it corrupts everything you can't fool with the plan of God it's sad so so what's going on your is pride he's pulling you up close to you and Whispering Whispering the love secrets in his ear he's sharing with you his plan he's sharing with you where you were in the beginning just like he did job where were you when I set the start where were you when I did this where were you which of you counseled me and how to do what I'm doing in an old job finally gets so inspired he says though the skin worms eat my flesh yet will I see God why he knew where he come from he knew he was he a part of he was playing out the role how many people do you think Through the Ages has taken comfort in job huh many people the prophet of God said just like the sun rises in the sunset we go through seasons sometimes you're on the Mountaintop sometimes you're in the valley sometimes he uses the expression when it rains it pours you know can you go through those times but no matter how many cyclists you go through there he's always there he's not going to lose all that the father hath given me will come he came for his own my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow what is he doing in this age he's chosen you this last elect lady the 11th Hour worker to show you and to open up to you it revealed to you what that he had in his mind from the beginning he's sharing it with you and and so if we if we can just read a little bit more you were predestinated to it just like the eagle here's the voice and when you see an anointed and Vindicated look he he looked up there he didn't see this old hand clucking around here join us and go over here and go this and go to this and that he saw a being like he wanted to be oh don't you like that Sailing In The Air screaming Free up in the Heights above all the vultures and the things of the earth Hallelujah he wanted to be that because it was in him to be that well what's he telling us he the first fruit has been waved over us the eagle scream of the The Book of Revelations that the eagle beast in this age going out screaming what's he doing he's flying over the seed he's flying over us speaking the words that's music to our ears calling out to our hearts and whether we're doing we're seeing something that we want to be is that not true I mean I think I won't go there no don't what wasn't good you know I I'm trying to just not worry about the negative right just stay with what God's saying and a man that's born of God a Son of God has to have the nature of God he has to be like God he honors God he is a part of the word of God and in this last day of this bride taking form just exactly the same power that he was in at the beginning has come up through these organizations and so forth and come out for the bride he can't be nothing else but that so what what are we seeing we're seeing the attributes of God manifested we're seeing the mercy of God the love of God the the the healing uh power of God for Vindication many people were healed in the day many people were healed that sat there and screamed crucify him you'll think oh no someone just talked him out of it that's one thing about the elect you can't talk them out of it you just can't talk him out of it because you'll doubt yourself before you'll doubt the word the words everything to you as life to you it's life it's abundance to you so we see that this great plan of God was God's attributes in the beginning being manifested the whole world the whole creation the first Bible that he wrote and put in the stars and put in nature and had the rivers and everything that he had it was all the manifested glory of God laying out and expressing himself but he just didn't want to express himself to himself he wanted to share this expression so he had a what a son Adam was the son of God all these attributes that he had he took those attributes and he put him in a son because he wanted to share him you're not the the children of Cain you're the children of Adam how do you know you're the children of Adam because the first Adam was a living soul but the second Adam was a quickening spirit he came in quickened in you the life that was in you oh I mean you understand you didn't come to this in your head there had to be something in you beside your head to grasp this message for what it really is because it don't make any sense to the carnal mind it's enmity to the carnal mind it's foolishness to the carnal mind even the church world the Greater Grace they're great systems their great beautiful speakings of the scripture when you come down and say Malachi 4 5 was fulfilled in a hillbilly from Kentucky give me a break how could you believe such a thing because I'm not using my head something inside him he rose up something I didn't even know was in there something came to life oh you say I got it from my parents that's what I love about this message it won't let you stay on your parents religion it will bring it to you personally he wants you to know you didn't get this from your daddy you didn't get this from your mommy you got this from me I loved you so much I let you come through believing parents I let you've been born into it but it doesn't matter the bond child is no good air is great is no different than the bond child under tutors but when you become heir to it you become arable he's not withholding anything from you you're the only withholding that's being done is on your side you know you got this worthy thing going on you'll never be worthy your righteousness is as filthy rags it's a gift of God lest any man should boast freely given freely give so we we see that the Beautiful part of it here it can't be nothing else but that so we find out that this that this these attributes of God was manifested showing that he loved he wanted to share he was a Shepherd a Good Shepherd you say well I'm living in this terrible world and I get sick he said by my stripes you are healed he made a provision for everything we have need of you say I sin he said cry Abba Father if you confess your sins I'm faithful and just for to forgive them he doesn't want you looking outside for something outside to stimulate you what he's wanting to stimulate you is his attributes and you understand it's his Mercy it's his grace it's his love it's his wisdom it's his counsel it's his hand that's what he wants you to rest and that's what he wants you to fellowship with he was the evidence of the holy spirit is Jesus Christ revealed to you personally amen I know him I don't know about him how do you know him you only know him by his attributes I've told you the story I had never never been been healed and I look I was a young man you know I had colds and stuff and got over them but I had never experienced a miracle of healing well in my infancy and not understanding the how beautiful God's extended Mercy is I really started praying oh God I want to feel your healing touch I want to be healed and you say well were you praying to be healed no I was praying to be sick really because he couldn't heal me until I was sick so I told you I went out in the log woods and I'm working I'm working a choker chain and jerking logs out of the wood and I pulled this great big log off of a and there was a bent over sapling and when that log went off that sapling sprung up it caught me under the arm flipped me up in the air my glove went way up in the air and when it came up it caught the inside of my thumb and just broke my thumb and put my shoulder out in everything now I was hurting I was almost hurting so bad I forgot to ask God to heal me isn't that funny we get so caught up in the problem that we forget about the fountain we get so self-centered so here I am I got this broken thumb and my arms dislocated and all of a sudden I'm invited to go to Japan and Korea and distribute Church age books with my good friend Jack Vance well I couldn't go like this and I wanted to go so I'd gotten service and I I could hardly get Mom and I just started praying oh God please heal me so I can go on this trip I can't go on this trip God would you just would you just please make this get better and all of a sudden I just felt the make my thumb all of a sudden it just came loose and I began to close my hand and I began to praise him and I lifted my arm before he knew it I was waving my arm and then sneezing my head and everything and I was praising God and I was instantly made well I didn't have to go that route do you understand my if I would have had faith in the beginning and accepted that everything that he is I am but I didn't know that uh 50 years ago but I've learned it I've learned that all the attributes all that he is all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into his church so we understand that God wanted to express all these attributes so in closing let's turn to Galatians and and I'll tell you Galatians we'll read in the fifth chapter of Galatians but I'll tell you if you go back and read a little bit in Galatians 4 he gives a beautiful type of the bonds woman and the free woman and and how that how that the children of desolation have more children than the children that have a husband and how that one's represented in Hagar and can the others represented in Jerusalem and it's a a beautiful allegory of election and so but we're going to read here in the fifth chapter now we're talking about act by your fruits that you know them and that attributes manifest attributes so the attributes of God the love that he expressed the kindness that he expressed the long-suffering that he expressed the patience that he expressed how many believes God was patient with Israel oh my he he he knew what his thoughts were towards them and and all these things that God projected in his love towards us because we're his own so he doesn't love us with something that's uh artificial he loves us with himself you understand that God loves you with himself his love for you is the very Capstone that he's capping our lives off with in fact John says God is love so all the attributes that God is everything that God is we are going to become that's the beauty of this because the attributes that God expressed towards us will manifest in US and we will possess the same attributes that he possessed this is the crowning uh of the his Earthly bride this Union with the Heavenly bride group and the Earthly bride this crowning what is your crown your crowns that Capstone is that perfect love if the final gift of God to you is that you possess all the attributes that he expressed does that not make anybody Shout Hallelujah when I was a young man I'd jump up above this platform like Lenny's dog she got a puppy that jumped 10 feet in the air straight up everything that he is that's what he said will be like God well what was God God was love we'll have perfect love we'll have the attributes you know we always think that that the power of God is in some sort of power and the prophet God turns around says power without character satanic you want to stop somebody in their tracks you think well if I can give him a left hook or something you just turn the other cheek if someone's gossiping about you you don't render evil for evil but you render good those attributes that God expressed to you towards you that were freely given to you to make you what that you are you take possession of those attributes then those attributes Empower you to overcome Satan and every circumstance and every situation that there is because now you are a possessor of the same love that he had that overcame your sins for you oh I like it let's close was that Amen to the word or Amen to Let's close I know you want that ice cream and I'm a man of my word I pray hope and don't let anybody join the congregation at Brahms no they can if they want an ice cream I'll buy them one too is let's read in 5. Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage let's close that book behold I Paul say unto you that if he be circumcised Christ's profit you nothing for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law Christ has become of no effect unto you wherefore if ye are justified by the law you are fallen from Grace by Grace ye are saved for we through the spirit wait for the hope of the righteousness by faith for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith that worketh by love faith is God to work within the same attributes that God expressed it let me put it this way God believed so much in you brother that he was willing to lay his life down on your behalf because he had confidence in you now if you came and sat in my living room and said oh brother maker I'd like to borrow this money you'd find out that I'd be going through a real drill am I going to get this money back I got a book full of promissory notes well they had a plan to pay me back you know the plan was that everything goes good and they make all these extra hours and they get all this extra money they'll pay me back but they end up with a flat tire they talk too long on the phone the washing machine broke down they got laid off from work they got sick and now they don't have the plan that's why the scripture says don't lend expecting to get paid back but a real Christian won't take advantage of that but I'd have to have confidence in you or in the word of God that says go ahead I'll take care of you but God had enough confidence in the seed that was in you that he laid down his life on your behalf he had faith that worketh by love you want to know his faith look at what he prayed for in Saint John 17 father that they may be one as we aren't that they might know the love that I have and the love that is in me would be in them also he's praying all this praise fiction to lay down his life not just to lay it down but for you because that was the attributes that was in him and he knew that if he expressed these attributes and he extended these attributes that these attributes would come back and be manifested in the bride that as he is so are we oh what a what a love affair of attributes manifest manifesting attributes he said which worketh by love ye did run well who did hinder you that you should have not obey the truth this verse 8 persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you there's Persuasions out there that aren't of the spirit that called you that aren't of the voice that you heard that aren't of the quickening seed that protects you A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump I have confidence in you through the Lord that you will be none other minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be and I Brethren if yet I preach circumcision why do I yet suffer persecution then is the offense of the Cross ceased I would that ye were even cut off which I would that you were that that they were even cut off which trouble you for Brethren he have been called unto Liberty only used not Liberty for occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another now he's talking about this expression and manifestation and of these attributes for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if he bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the Lust For flesh lustest against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these two are contrary one to the other so that you cannot do the things that ye would do but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law for the works of the flesh are manifested in these now watch the attributes of the first husband these are the attributes of unbelief these are the attributes of the flesh these are the attributes of the carnal man these are the fruits by which they are known he said in the works of the flesh are manifested which are these idolatry fornication and cleanliness lavishness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies ending murders drunkenness reviling and such like of the which I have told you before as I have also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God right but you already have an inheritance in the kingdom of God how many knows that amen now you used to walk in those things and that's why they question you what happened you used to walk with me in these things you used to do these things but you say something happened to me an attribute came to me that's what it was unattribute of God to save you out of Destruction to lift you up out of the Mirey clay the love of God was expressed to me in his son God so loved the world he sent his attribute to me that if I would believe it and see it but not only did I I didn't see it of my own accord I didn't believe it of my own accord he gave me Revelation he quickened it to me and made it known to me in such a way that it couldn't be doubted amen do you make mistakes yes are you saved yes how can you be saved by works no well how do you know you're going to be there he said Till and that settles it he put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life how do you know it's on the land Book of Life by faith in love how do you know I heard the voice I got the Revelation I understood when it was preached that that was me that's me he said well you're not worthy he didn't say I had to be worthy all he said was he had to think it in the beginning he had to start the work he had to perform the work he made the choice he's the Potter over the clay to make one unto honor and one under dishonor you don't like the fact that I'm safe talk it over with him let him know I Lord I'm just not going to be happy in heaven if brother McGarry is there now who do you think's going to be there because he always promised me to make me happy but you can be there it ain't going to bother me I'm going to be so happy that I made it I don't care who else is there my Crown's coming off my head as little as it might be as fast as I can get it off at his feet where were we he says all these things he says won't inherit the kingdom of God but the fruits of the spirit now these fruits are the very attributes that God used towards you to save and redeem you these are the fruits of his spirit and that's why when you're born to Kent right and you can't be born again unless you close that book and accept the the life that he's given you and I know everybody goes back well I did this when I knew better oh everything you ever did you knew better when you took your first cookie you knew better the first time I stole something I didn't just go in and steal it and put in my pocket I had developed another method it was called changing the price tag it's just when I went to try to buy a 55 reel for two dollars and fifty cents it didn't work I knew it was wrong it buzzed all over me it was wrong I didn't know about salvation I didn't know this but the very conscience of a man tells him when he's wrong that's why the world is without excuse um man I feel like a good Baptist preacher is it but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh along with the affections in lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be uh be desirous of vainglory provoking one another envying one another and so we see now that this great plan of God has finally coming down to a head she's come up through the ages she's brought the seed of life he's waved the Sheep offering before us the Eagles flowing over us we've seen what that is that we want to be and now we're coming down to the time where every attribute that he expressed to us is now going to be manifested in us because he sets the Capstone of Love Upon Us of which that we were in him in the beginning oh it's an invisible Union of the attributes now being formed in the bride because the word was made flesh and now the flesh is be made word and now she's becoming little Messiahs that's what we're shooting for that's what our promise is do we love the rain yes we love the rain the rain falls on the just and the unjust Let It Rain Let It Rain Lord but I'm not satisfied until I'm mature and I'm ripened and I'm brought into that image of Christ until the very attributes that he expressed or manifested in me and I in him become one father that they may be one as we are one and that's the hope and the glory of the church do you believe that amen let's Stand Together we'll say a quick prayer will sing a song and all that want to go to Brahms will invade that place and we'll have a Revival over there you love them tonight Oh what a beautiful beautiful relationship we have oh that that's what makes your heart jump with joy to think that there is a Grace of power and a Love extended in this age that's going to allow me to overcome My Flesh Hallelujah you say can it be done yes will it be done yes because you're predestinated to it let's pray are gracious Heavenly Father Lord every attribute that you were you poured into Jesus Christ was the mystery of God revealed Lord and then you sent that same spirit back upon us and you said fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom you said my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow and if I have begun to work I will finish it to the end Lord we look at ourselves and we don't look nothing like those attributes sometimes foreign we don't seem like that can be possible but it's not possible by works it's possible by promise and Abraham was impossible for him to have a child him and Sarah but in a great allegory in type they were transformed into something that they weren't to something that could fulfill [Music] the promise and Lord that's what I my heart's desire is is that every believer can come to the revelation of that that transforming power is now working in that bride forming that bride into the bride of Christ and that bride stands with every attribute that he has that's why he loves her because she's him these two that were Twain have become one and they're in a great love affair father [Music] and Lord how I realize that I don't have the words to speak it but if I could I would but I know and believe that this lies within the message for every believer and we'll just stay with it Lord I know it'll produce what it's prophesied to produce May every one of us take care be sincere do all that we can to separate ourselves from the things of the world and every time we see you father in one of your great manifested attributes may we look up and say that's I see something that I want to be and he says jump because you're not theirs your mind and I accept that Lord with all my heart that I am yours let's sing this you love them amen somebody help me start Lord I see you help me find you [Music] Hallelujah [Music] Lord forgive me if I wander far away from you foreign [Applause] [Music] been fine fresh on me fill my cup again amen
