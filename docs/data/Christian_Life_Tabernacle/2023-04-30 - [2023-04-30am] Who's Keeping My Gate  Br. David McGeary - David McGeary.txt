way with the service in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise the Lord his brother Mike comes to do the psalm reading we just want to continue to remember the building of the church in prayer and I'm just excited about the progress it's wonderful when you see a vision coming to fruition and we just appreciate all the brothers that have been pitching in and all those that have been in prayer why don't you just greet one another and welcome them to the house of the Lord and once you've done that you may have your seats as we have our Psalm reading good morning You Know It uh at some point in life you uh all of us find ourselves dealing with paperwork whether we love it or hate it it's kind of a fact of life whether you're buying a new house or you're signing up for a loan or you're doing a business contract or whatever the case may be but one of the things that you'll hear people say is to make sure you read the fine print pay attention to the fine print buried with on all that paperwork there's somewhere there's usually some important details some important sentences that are you know written in very small letters that if you miss them and if you don't read them you can be surprised or Miss a very important piece of information about that important document is you read the Psalms you'll notice under many of the chapters there's fine print those little statements in fine print and you know sometimes they'll be in providing instructions about what the psalm is to be used for what kind of music gets to be played with and sometimes it'll tell you the circumstances under which that Psalm was written and as we turn to Psalm 60 this morning you'll see there's a lot in the fine print at the beginning of the song it tells us that David wrote this Psalm while he was doing battle with the Enemy well when he speaks of joab returning from the valley of salt after defeating the you know you can read about these events in second Samuel chapter 8. describes a long string of Victories that David and the Israelites had against their enemies and it says in second Samuel 8 13 it says this and David got him a name when he returned from smiting the syrians in the valley of salt being 18 000 men it wasn't just a victory it was one that gave David a reputation a great Victory one for being a mighty conqueror for accomplishing great things you know if you read second Samuel 8 it's all about One Victory after the next and it was during those events that David writes this song but what's strange is when you read this psalm it doesn't sound like somebody who's experiencing victory in fact it doesn't match up at all with the tone of someone that you would expect after experiencing many victories says in verse 1 it says o God thou has cast us off thou has scattered us thou has been displeased o turn thyself to us again you read that you go wait what somebody who's just been experiencing all these victories and this is the psalm that he's pending he goes on to say that was made the Earth to tremble that was broken it heal the breaches thereof for its shaketh this does not sound like someone who's experiencing victory thouest showed thy people hard things that was made us to drink the wine of astonishment you know that sounds like somebody who's in great trial like someone who is Fallen searching for Redemption and deliverance so what is this Psalm doing being written during a time of great victory you know like any important document the details are in the fine print the fine print describes a battle with Nations called arum nayarayam and aramroba these are basically syrians in fact if you read the account in second Samuel 8 it refers to them as syrians and describes the start of the campaign in second Samuel 8 and verse 3 as David recovering his border at the river Euphrates he's doing battle with an enemy that continues to occupy the land that have been promised to them way up in the north of the country I had to write these down to keep myself honest but then he goes on to describe a battle at the valley of salt not with the seriums syrians but with Edom an entirely different enemy and the Valley of the salt is way down in the south of the country 200 miles away from where the river Euphrates battle was going on so while David is out there fighting these battles out in the North country and having all these great victories suddenly there's a pivot to a battle way down south 200 miles away with another enemy two battles on two different sides of the country you know he's out here fighting to restore the land way up in the north that have been promised to him and while he's distracted with the fighting busy fighting the enemy here comes another one 200 miles away on the other side of the Kingdom you know this is the situation where David begins to call on the Lord in psalm 60. he's just received word that another enemy has come up and he and his army are 200 miles away says oh God thou has cast us off thou Hast scattered us thou has been displeased while we've been off fighting the battle in one area the enemy has come in somewhere else to try to scatter us o turn thyself to us again suddenly in a time of Victory he's crying out to the Lord for deliverance and I wonder if that sounds familiar to anyone here where while you're doing battle with one thing something else comes along from Left Field I think the world has this phrase for that it's called when it rains it pours just one thing right after the other and the whole thing just try to scatter the people of God and as we read in Psalm 60 you know David is calling out to the Lord for deliverance and he says an interesting statement in verse 4. says this thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth and I read that and I went amen that's speaking of a people to whom he has given a banner to be displayed to be lifted up as I was reading that the scripture came to my mind Isaiah 59 verse 19. says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard a banner against him just like David when the enemy comes in on both sides and starts to overwhelm the Lord has given a banner a standard that he wants to see lifted up you know if you keep a reading in Isaiah 59 verse 20 21 it says then the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob saith the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever that's a promise I'm going to put my word in their mouth and it'll never leave their mouth you know as we finish reading in psalm 60. you know what is a standard what is a banner well it's his words on your lips the Lord has given his word to be put on display when the enemy comes in like a flood you know David begins to do that here in Psalm 60 as we'll read starting in verse 6 and going all the way to verse 9. he begins to recount every one of the Cities every one of the kingdoms every one of the enemies that the Lord had already given them that had already given the children of Israel to be defeated you go in there and you read city after city after City he can go back to Joshua and see what the Lord said and I'm giving you this city and I'm giving you this city and I'm giving you this city here David is now taking the word that the Lord had said and beginning to put it on his lips you said that this belonged to me you said that this belongs to me you said that this belonged to me he's now lifting up that banner and taking his words and putting it on his lips when the enemy comes in like a flood but you know as he begins to go through that now the last one he names is Edom the and it's interesting the story ends with a victory that should be impossible in the eyes of man so impossible in fact that to this day modern historians struggle to find all the right places on the map where this occurred because somehow an army that was 200 miles away showed up on the scene with only eighteen thousand men and defeated an army of the in the valley of Saul somehow they could they commit they created an impossible victory you know an impossible distance was crossed in an impossible battle was won because somebody lifted up a standard of the words on their lips you know as a result it says in second Samuel 8 13 David got him a name when he returned from fighting the syrians 200 miles away in the valley of salt being 18 000 men this caught someone's attention it's got everyone's attention why because the enemy came in like a flood and he lifted up a standard against him an impossible battle was won so we go ahead and stand this morning you know there's a banner there's a word that he wants to see us lift up you know when the enemy will continue to come in from all directions but he wants to see what his people are going to do with the word that he promised them that he gave them there's a banner to be lifted up a standard to be lifted up in the when the enemy comes in like a flood it's important to read the fine print let's go ahead and read Psalm 60 together oh God thou has cast us off thou has scattered us thou has been displeased o turn thyself to us again thouest made the Earth to tremble thou has broken it heal the branch speech thereof for it shaken thou as show thy people hard things thou has made us to drink the wine of astonishment thou is given a banner to them that feare thee that it may be displayed because of the truth Selah that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and hear me God hath spoken in his Holiness I Will Rejoice I will divide shechem and meet out the valley of suck off Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine Ephraim also is the strength of mine head Judah is my law Giver Moab is my washpot over Edom while I cast out my shoe philistia Triumph thou because of me who will bring me into the Strong City who will lead me into Edom will not thou God which has cast us off and thou o God which didst not go out with our armies give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man through God we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies amen praise the Lord amen you may have your seats key of f will soon and very soon we are going to see the

also uh brother he knows requesting prayer he asked for prayer last week he's asking again so let's let's not let this go unnoticed but he he needs work whether he knows are you here there he is so you can maybe meet him and ask him what the need is and get to know our brother and carry the burden with him that he knows he has a family of God that loves him and that's praying with them and believing that God's going to open that right door or close the wrong doors amen also brother Tiago is asking for prayer for immigration the immigration process with papers because they are closed so um this is a serious need as well um sister peace writes please pray for my son who is in a current uh financial trouble and also other issues that are happening May the Lord grant a testimony and intervene on his behalf and our Prophet told us the trial is the greatest thing that ever happened to us so we just pray God that would use this to bring him into his position bring him into the Revelation that God has for him amen a sister you've seen your rights I asked prayer for Mr Gustavo who had a car accident and just asked that the Lord would take control of everything and also in his recovery amen let's just remember those needs as the brothers are prepared to take up the tithes and offerings just brother ask brother Tim Seiler to ask prayer over these needs but let's just sing

pray in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles let's open our Bibles this morning we hope we have the parking lot open next weekend uh if we have service this Wednesday we're going to have a big crane out here so it's going to be real important that uh we're going to have to kind of walk around to come into church we don't want to get anywhere near that crane all that wood you've seen laying out there that's the ceiling for the new church we trust that we're going to start putting it in Tuesday Wednesday we hope we don't have to go to Thursday but very soon we should be able to have a roof on on that and take things I I don't mind if you uh want to walk inside of the building but be real careful for those nails and lumber and things that you can take us if you do take your children in there uh please uh take them by the hand um anyway let's turn in our Bibles to Genesis this morning and this is the 22nd chapter of Genesis we all know the story well um uh it's one that we all take great hope in God unveiling his word in his mind and his nature to Abraham but let's just start in the 12th verse the 11th is the bets of Earth it says and the angel of the Lord called out this is Genesis the 22nd chapter the 11th verse and the angel of the Lord called out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I can we say that this morning here am I amen and he said lay not thy hands upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou hath not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and be and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son and Abraham called the name of the paste Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven a second time and said by myself I have sworn saith the Lord for because thou hath done this thing and hath not withheld thy son thine only son in that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the Sands of upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies amen father we love you we ask you to bless your word test in your precious name we pray amen God bless you aren't you uh glad that Paul came along and explain that not all Israel's Israel it wasn't just the natural Seed of Abraham it was the royal see Abraham and how many believe that you're part of that seed this morning amen you are the Seed of Abraham by faith because do you believe the promise that God sent in this day every day God's in every age God has given something for the believer to believe something that separates them out from what seemingly is going on we know that God called Abraham and Abraham was going to have a people and there was a people that was going to come from Abraham and God's always a separator that's what God does he longs to identify You by separating you from those that aren't his and I'm not the judge of that he's the judge of that but but yet he has that in his great heart and his great mind and we've been studying a little bit here it recently out of the book of Nehemiah and and last Sunday we talked about um we talked about the walls and today we talked about the necessity of having walls in our lives and today we want to Fellowship a little around uh Gates and uh just do a kind of more of Evangelistic but and part of what we're doing we we want to encourage you to read your Bibles and to let the Bible inspire you you know as you read the scripture we're taught that we need to put ourselves in every uh every verse in every line you know make it personal to you put your name in there and and as you read the scriptures and you uh uh you study the word of God okay you know draw from the things that you need of can you you know make uh make the types and the and and the stories and fit your situation fit what you're going through make the word come alive to you nothing's changed man still tempted the same Satan's still using his same old tricks we're still fighting the same old battle you know all Satan's done is changed his disguise that's all he's done yeah you know he keeps trying to he he keeps trying to work himself to where he's appearing as an angel of Light you know what I mean and his goal we know what his goal is nothing he wants to be worshiped he wants to be the worshiper of the creator of his Eden he wants man to look at his scientific creation he wants man to look at his educated creation his civilization and and and just say oh this is glorious now this is wonderful I I love this thank you but how come it there's a group of people that can't stand it Hallelujah amen I don't want what he's got I have a promise amen I'm looking for a city aren't you there's a there's a place that's greater than this place that's more a wonderful but just to uh get a feeling this morning to where that we're going and and talking about this world this Eden that we're in I wanted to play this morning to you just 15 little minutes out of the message called letting off the pressure and it just kind to express the atmosphere that we're living in and what's uh around us and when I read this it's hard to believe that our Messengers talking about 1962. but I I think when you're gifted a way that a prophets gifted you're really not subject to the date and the time you're in he he I if I could say it this way he was caught up in the age so you know uh and the spirit of the Lord knows the beginning from the end so he can address anything at any time and for any day because he knows the beginning from the end he's omnipotent so he knows the outcome he knows what would be so he could address things years and years before that they've ever come to pass he can describe it he can address it and and how many it could have listened I love to listen uh but to when our messenger would tell a story I always remember the one that meant so much to me as he talked about when the Lord had come from being tempted 40 days and 40 nights and and I've been there to Israel where they point up to this finger type mountain and they say this is that where he was tempted and and up there in the wilderness and and then you could see the journey and and uh the scripture says that brother Brahm is talking he says and I can see Jesus coming down and being tempted and he drops down through there and he picks up his friend uh uh Lazarus you know and I I just I just the way that he described it you just get the feeling that he's there and uh when I listened to this tape it's almost like I think well he he was here before we got here amen how many knows a prophet can do that he can go out and he can see and he can prophesy he can look out ahead and he can see what he is I take great hope in that because many times I can only see my distress in my trouble and my problem I can only see the battle that I'm in but there's one that already knows the beginning of the end and just like our story Abraham here God provided a sacrifice he's provided an answer you might think that you're in in a situation that you can see no resolve to no end to but God can create an end that that's what's beautiful he can provide a sacrifice he can provide an answer he can provide a solution that's the kind of God that we want to serve that's the kind of God that we want to talk about that's the kind of God that we want to think about don't look at the what's being presented that's not our reality our reality is the promise of God's word so as we pick up this little 15 minutes of this message the prophet of God's just got done telling the story how he went to the hospital to visit somebody and as he was looking for directions the nurse you know said something to him you could go read it yourself you know like oh how do I don't know where every room is around here and he talked to a doctor and he says yeah up this way and out that way and and he said I just seen what it was if people are just they're letting off the pressure well let's just listen to a couple minutes of this before we start this morning and and uh and just kind of listen to it and understand what is going on around us how many knows it's crazy out there I mean I I don't care who you talk to I talk to people that only believe in God and and they they say it's crazy and um and I said well you know I I said uh you know God promised there'd be some oddballs here all right you know there's a few nuts holding this whole place together praise God but let's just listen as brother Brown picks the thing up and and he's just listened to all these people talk and he's just gonna talk just a few minutes I think he'll just just kind of understand because he puts you in this situation also so let's just listen for a few moments and we'll have a little time of Fellowship Lord bless you it's just becoming a a neurotic age everybody's all built up haven't got no time and that builds up to a place that uh it breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap them off and and say things you don't mean to say everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty you're all guilty we we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise so these uh these an excess pressure build up today I believe before I go any further I might say this I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing I believe it's the devil and we know the coming of the Lord is at hand and the Bible said in the last days that the devil would go about like a roaring lion and if he could get you under pressure hurrying running over something you will make decisions that you wouldn't make if you've sat down and think it over there about three years ago I was on a hunting trip and I had an Indian guide and I I have to hunt real fast that stuff that's just me you see one of them pressure Builders so I I was hunting with the Indian and I jumped off the horse and there's some elk up on the mountain and I start around the bin the old Indians about 10 years older than me she's as a puffin coming behind me I said come on Chief come on too fast too fast I don't know well I said come on and start you said too fast I slowed down next gear too fast I go down to a walk oh my I said Chief the elk is up there he said him stay there you were born there I said I guess that's right you stay there you were born there he said preacher hunt too fast secure all the game away to do like Indian walk them once look him nine times well I wonder what kind of a gear I'd have to get him to get on there or I was going to run up the mountain he said walk him once then look him nine times look all around over everything nine times before you make another step oh my but you see he's no hurry I've thought of that Ma precious old mother that's in glory tonight someone said why don't you wear a white flower today meeting your mother's day and I said my mother's Not Dead okay my mother's a living and then I'd wear a red one and then people say I thought your mother died so to keep from confused them and building up more sea mice left at all she's not dead she's asleep she's with Christ and then um the nervous neurotic age that we're living in and you don't want all of this the doctors don't have the answer because they're plagued with it too they don't have the answer they don't know what to do you say oh doctor I I I'm just about to blow my head I don't know what to do well he said I am too well there is nothing you can do he'll give you a tranquilizer when that wears off you're more nervous it was in the first place like a drunk man taking extra drink to get over his drunkness so you you can't do it there's no answer they don't have it but God has the answer right that's what we want to take talk about you have the answer God's got the answer he is the answer Christ is the answer to every problem we got now we're going to talk about him now in the Old Testament there was a time when a man could build up pressure way back there and that was when he done something wrong if he shed innocent blood well then he was on the Run because as soon as that man that he killed the wrong he did that man he did the wrong to some of his people would hunt him until he found him and there he kill him he's a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye and you see a man had no place to stop if he done something accidentally and of course the people wouldn't believe it but he had to take off because just as soon as as he did this then the the relatives of this man are woman whoever it was they started haunting him and when they found him it was tooth for tooth and eye for eye that's where they lived and so he couldn't stop nowhere he was a fugitive he didn't know what to do and he was on the Run a very hype of today I think that's what's causing so much pressure we're on the Run put some as the world knowing they're wrong knowing the coming of the Lord is at hand and the pressures building up and they're on the Run Roadhouse gaming Dan luxury sin immoral Decay anything to give them listen to television dirty jokes anything give this they're on the Run there's something fixed to happen they know it and they're drinking themselves to death with pleasures and everything else on the Run they know there's something fixing to happen the world speaks of it we know that something sticks to happen this world made me blowed up before daylight every Nations under kitchen why one time I was in Africa and I was watching a sheep feeding as a lamb or middle grown sheep and the little fellow was eaten very peaceful and all at once he got restless and you take a bite you look around you take a bite when he was peaceful I was watching him he look is this calm although it isn't that peaceful out there look at that little fella a Shepherd that had been washing had gone to the crowd back they eat colored and uh watch this little fella naturally got nervous I thought what's the matter with that little guy of course do binoculars and he got so nervous he looked this way in that way he started blatant he didn't know what to do I thought what made the little fella get so excited all at once now he was in a little pasture field but way over behind there I noticed something raised up and let out again about a half a mile from him he had good in the weeds a line slipping up and that little fella something in him was building to a place that he know there was danger somewhere he couldn't see it but the line has smelled the Sheep and he had to get quick now to get him before the shepherd got him got him out of the way so then watching him tension and built and in the distance this line was slipping up real easy yet the Sheep couldn't see the line but there's just something inside of him I told him that danger was at hand that's the way it is today that there's something inside of people that lets them know something is fixing to happen we know it the Christian knows it the world knows it the drunkard knows that the Gambler knows that the businessman the governments the U.N all of them know that something sticks to happen it's built attention women mothers just one cigarette after another I watch him come to the school they drive through Arlene there they'll have to watch my kids and my dog on a 20 mile Zone 70 miles an hour women taking their children to school cigarette in her hand hanging out one door fussing with her kids and down there and squeak the brakes in or the wheels are laying tires on the street and here they come back again I seen the wind blow four or five little kids fall off the road the other day of some neurotic mother where's she going what's the matter certain television program on maybe comes on she wanted to see but that's it tension there's something causing that they used to didn't do that something's approaching death and destruction is on its Road here it isn't very far away something is approaching now in the Old Testament God's seeing as some of this trouble was accidentally done so if you're innocent and not guilty God makes a way for you now if a man killed a man just deliberately premeditated he was lost he could not come to this place but if he did it accidentally he didn't mean to do it then there was a City of Refuge one was at Ramos Gilead and four places are they Joshua places Cities of Refuge now now the people could come to the City of Refuge if accidentally he'd done something wrong he didn't mean to he would come to the City of Refuge and go to the gate the gatekeeper would ask him why coming what was his idea of coming then his case was pleaded and when his case was pleaded at the gate and the man be found innocent and he did it not willfully then the man was taken into the city as a place of Refuge then the enemy could not get him and if he lied and done wrong and come into the City of Refuge though he was holding to the other Harms his enemy had the privilege and right to drag him from that order and kill him yes sir because he was guilty premeditated and he had to be punished now there was something went with that of course that man would be nervous mom maybe a dozen man behind you somewhere every Rock ever Hill ever bush the enemy somebody was standing ready for him he was nervous and then when he once got into the city he could let off the pressure he was safe he's all right because there's a provided Place made for him God's provided way for that innocent man not to be slaying but it could be accepted from this land because he did it accidentally now if you didn't mean to do it now if he meant to do it well he he had to stand the circumstances but um uh there's no chance for him as he did it willfully and there's two classes of people today may I say this there's man and women in the world today brother ruddle that really don't want to do these things they're doing there's men and women in the world today that don't want to sin I feel sorry for them they don't want to do anything wrong but they do it they're drove to it now there's a place for that person that wants to do right there's a place to let off that pressure it's true but there's some that doesn't care makes you want to go home and listen to that don't it amen so we just want to just have a little bit of Fellowship this morning I I think that uh I could certainly relate I think it certainly describes I think it gives us an understanding there's something fixing to happen there's something pressuring he says I believe it's the devil pressuring us pressure so how many understands that there's great pressure out there that Satan's like a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour and and he said along with this pressure comes a hurriedness or a a a a a need to do something and he said it causes us many times to make decisions without thinking it out and so in using the book of Nehemiah this morning because we're studying a little bit about that uh part of the scripture and and uh so I kind of would would ask kind of a a question if I would uh about Gates if I kind of had a title for this this morning I would I would call it maybe who's keeping my gate and so just to uh talk a little bit about the gates and about nehemiah's wall brother Mike do we have the ability to put that up uh there on the wall I don't know if if can can you see that maybe not uh uh but there's 12 gates I believe on this wall this is one of the many images and it says in the first verse of the third chapter it's seven and Aaliyah's just a high priest rose up with his Brethren the priest and they built the Sheep gate and Sanctified it and set up the doors to it even to the Tower of Maya they Sanctified it unto the Tower of Hannah now and if you uh look over here up on on the top up here at right up here is the Sheep gate and the Tower of Maya that's the Tower of the hundreds and go back the other way right so this is the Sheep gate the Tower of the hunter that's the Tower of hannel I don't know if I'm saying it right but this is where they started building and then if you follow reading down through Nehemiah Nehemiah 3 3 Nehemiah 3 6 it starts listing the people and the tribes that got together and they started building that wall around the city and you can go through here because this is just one of the many uh uh things that were under images and so if you kind of look at this uh in a sense if I could say that it's kind of almost like how that were built if you could look at us like we're each a city you understand we're a city we're a life we're uh we're a city and they started building around that wall and again you can read it it was like almost two and a half miles of wall they built it in 52 days uh it's a it's a tremendous story but you see first inside it was the temple and and that that was the place of worship that they built and then they went and built the the rest of the wall and they some like the fountain gate that this map they call it the Watergate there's a horse gate every single one of those had a purpose and and a meaning and and we won't go through all that this morning but I I want to talk a little bit this morning uh uh anyway so it's very interesting isn't it that all the gates and how can if you read down certain groups of men they'd get together and they would build the gate from this place to this place and from this place to this place and and we could discuss all those things but I want to talk we talked about walls and we talked why walls are so important is because they give us distinction they they give a line a distinction it it and that's what we're finding today in the world that there's no distinction that they want to erase any thing that gives any Clarity to anything you know separation isn't bad and being different isn't bad God made us different he made each one of us different he chose the the color that you are this morning God chose that that was by his making the nationality that you come from the background that you come from whatever you that all that was of God and he has a great purpose and he takes Delight in every single one of them there's no big eyes or there's no little use okay he he loves you the way you are as precious in His sight and every blessing is equally given to any man that chooses to have them our Prophet just said I thought that was a tremendous statement he said there's people that don't want to be the way they are they don't want to be what they're doing they want to be different he says there's a way for those people he said but there's other people they just don't care and this morning I don't want us to fall into the categories I don't care people are getting to where I don't care I I do whatever comes my way whatever pressure I get under whatever circumstances build up I'm going to let that circumstance drive me and push me and and whatever the result of it is I'm going to live with I don't want to live like that [Music] I don't want everything around me determining what I am or what I'm going to be I don't walk I don't want to be influenced from the outside I thought of that City it had the temple in it I want to be influenced by the temple that's in my heart but we understand we just heard it ourselves there's a pressure from the outside driving us to make decisions and and if and those that pressure has got to come through a gate you understand what we're we're one to Fellowship around because Gates control the atmosphere even in this natural City they had Gates that the horses came through welcome because you don't want to walk behind a bunch of horses I mean I don't think I have to go into much explanation on that I hope I don't and if your kids ask you you answer it but and they they had certain gates for these certain things because that's the way they would control the atmosphere you understand control the condition control the crowd they could stand at the gate in our little story we heard he had to come to the GateKeeper and it had to plead his case to the gatekeeper and and that's our questions who's keeping my gate you know who's keeping what arrives at the gate and our gate and uh wants to enter in because you've got to remember the gate is the control it controlled the atmosphere it controlled who comes in and who goes out you know that man that went to that City he had to have Refuge as long as he stayed there you understand but he would have to make a decision to go out that gate I believe there's a story in the Bible where some sheep got away and the guy went out of the gate and the minute that he left that protection right there's judgment okay so we're we're talking about we establish walls but now we've got to establish Gates we got to understand there's Gates there's gateways and we know that that that uh because a game controls you have to understand it can it it's a control point we could give many electrical types in the electrical field Plumbing well they call it a gate valve it's a gate you know we have other uh type of things in in the electrical it's like a breaker is like a gate you can turn it on or shut it off so we got to understand that if the gate is controlling the atmosphere then we've got to make a decision of what kind of atmosphere do you want to live in I don't want to live in an atmosphere of fear I don't want to live in an atmosphere of constant pressure I want to live in an atmosphere of faith hope I don't want to be controlled by what's happening around me I want to have something that allows me to con have control and over and understand that that I I just can't let every gate everything come into my life at once in we know that there's there's gateways to the census don't we or the flesh understand those things there you know we see touch smell taste we got to control you you understand that you you the Gateway you just can't eat all that you want to eat and be everything that you want to be you can't Swatch everything you can't hear everything you can there's got to come a time where something takes control over that gate you got to take control over what you what are you going to hear and what are you gonna listen to and what effect is it going to have on you you've got to understand that that that even your hearing is a gate that you've got to control you've got to have something that's controlling that gate that goes for gossip you know what you hear you don't gotta that you don't got to let in everything you hear you can start saying wait a minute I'm possessing this gate this is a gate that the enemy is using to get to me I'm not going to let him come through this gate of of hearing and listening oh you know it it's you know gossip is an amazing thing you know that soap operas were real popular in our country I don't know if they still are I remember they used to have you know the World Turns and my children and Hospital day and yeah some of you look like you've seen some of that stuff I never could handle it but you know they're all built on Gossip and what they are they they feed that they feed that Curiosity what's next what's he gonna say oh I got to see it bro prophet of God said they had to drive home as fast as they could because they got to watch some TV program some soap opera you understand that gate got opened and once that guy got open something was able to enter into that gate and affect the atmosphere that that person was living in to where they made a decision to drive five kids off the road oh Gates hearing is one of them eating's another one you know you just boy that's a hard one to get a hold of I know it's one I've got to get a hold of you know you just get to where you just want to taste it you know what I mean look I used to have a whole great big bowl of chocolates on my back thing there's hardly any left in there I just figure Ben's been in there eating my chocolate I don't want to think man I ate all that chocolate man I've got a big gate the Gate of eight no I'm trying to draw a parallel in your thinking because I want you to understand there's Gates into your life there's Gates that are there and the enemy has got to enter through one of these Gates so you can build the walls but he'll try the gates he'll come through the gates you know so we know that there's Gates through the sentence hearing you know and and tasting and feeling and and all those things they're gateways and you know even in the natural if you can start controlling those natural gains you can control the atmosphere and the health of your body that's that's true you can do it and I'm not I'm not here to preach this morning if Health you know my name's not Jacqueline or or somebody like that uh uh or maybe for some of you modern people Richard Simmons is that would that be a a modern guy you know what I mean uh but I I think that we are the temple of God I mean there ought to be some respect you know what I mean and there ought to be some discipline and there ought to be some moderation man I'm preaching to myself on that I know but uh but those are still Gates that have to be controlled amen and there's gate there's gates to the uh to the mind conscience memory all these things are gateways that are there that we've we've got to no understand if we could sit here today typing ourselves or using ourselves as an example of Jerusalem and we're trying to build ourselves in through the statue of a perfect man we understand what it is that God what why is he building this city why is he building this body why is he fitting it and joined together even the building of this city it took every group doing their part in order for it to come together and each of us as individuals has a part to play in the building of this body but if if we don't control the gates we can go on later and we can find out there's all these plans that these people were making of how to come in and disrupt it and to destroy it and to tear it down but we can't we can't keep thinking everybody else is going to do the job there's a responsibility that we all have and you say well what did that responsive come from who delegated that responsibility he did by election when he elected you right he elected you to be a part of his body fitted and joined together every member supplying the need to the other so you don't want to become a gate that allows things into the body so we've got to have something that's watching our gate we've got to watch our gates we could go through all the different things of the of the all those different senses of emotions and all those things and and how their Avenues into you but we don't want to that's not our Point our point is still for us to come to a realization that you've got gates in your life and you have got to watch what's coming through them okay and you've got we've got to I've got to we all have to uh my vocabulary I wish there was a better word but but we've got to understand that there's a pressure that's pushing that once in he wants in he's pressing he that the pressure that's on he's pressing to get in he's pressing to make you conform he's pressing you not to stand out they don't want any voices that's contrary they'll want everybody to conform everybody to think the same way everybody not to stand up nobody to do nothing then they've got complete control let's see we've got a controller it's the Holy Spirit it's the word of God the spirit of God that came back and when there's a gate that's pushed open we have the right by the promise of God by the gift of his son to sit there and possess that gate we have a right to by the title deed to go back and claim everything and push it right back to our ownership but you notice that all those principles are falling apart in the world today they're waking up too late they passing a law in a state here recently that if somebody's squatting on your property or in your house and you remove them or get them off your property they have a right to sue you I don't know for what maybe you didn't fold their tent upright because maybe you maybe you uh hurt their pillow or or whatever they don't they want to possess the gates this roaring line even in your own personal life in your own City where the lamb is the light here he's working on so many Avenues so many directions so many different uh approaches to try to press in and press you to make a decision that normally you wouldn't make the pressure's out there people run off and join this or they run off and join that they the pressure gets so bad they don't know what to do they because if they think well maybe if I go here or go there it'll be better you know the devil's end everywhere had a good friend that owned a ranch I mean just I mean just beautiful place fabulous you take her all the time every place I better thought I'd just like to go back and live on that ranch again there's no problems on the ranch the ranch is beautiful there's nothing out there and yet tragedy can strike there just an incident of a second a gun accidentally went off person to be crippled heart attack strike out there just like the strike anywhere he's everywhere the enemy is everywhere the prophet God said the whole pressure today I believe it's the devil pressing in at and you've got to understand he's trying to press into our lives he and he's trying to find what gate can he come in it's like a thief in the night he'll try this door he'll try this window he'll go around he'll keep trying every little place that he can get in he'll chase a place out and watch when do you leave when do you don't leave what do you do what do you do that there's all kinds of things they have because they they they're they're always looking for that gate of Entry so if you're not keeping the gate who's watching your gate I I wouldn't be opposed to a spiritual ring bell in our lives where the Holy Spirit notified us every time something was there I couldn't believe it the other day because I saw a clip of I guess they call them package thieves people just walk right up and take your package off of the and I thought well what what did their the it was a of this ring thing and I thought well what did that do for him they got a video of their package getting stolen they didn't get their package back because you can steal a package if it's under eight hundred dollars the gate has been knocked down it's destroyed the gates of our country have been destroyed now you've got to build your gates in your life you have got to have your walls built you have got to take control of your Gates you can't let everybody in it's just a must because if you don't keep clap mind battle we'll get to the place did you you heard it right this morning he said I just feel like blowing my head and the doctor said so do I and you go what am I here for so we both can go together they're losing it but if you pretend that you don't have Gates and you pretend that there's no devil and you pretend there's no pressure and you pretend there's no enemy and you just get to the place you just take things the way the they are and you're letting everything control you and that's that's the way people live whatever happens we'll deal with it later we'll deal with it later it's just I'm not going to deal with it now I'll deal with it later I'll worry about the gate later I'll worry about what this is uh later or what what they're trying to say or what they're trying to do I'll just worry about it later I won't deal with it now I've got too much going on it's just too heavy uh you know and oh just you know just forget it there's an amazing thing going on in this country right now is we open the gate to our young people through something called social media and the internet we got our kids phones because everybody had a phone we pretended that we needed them to watch our kids and to know where our kids at and to communicate in everything but they're smart enough to change that up and send an app and they can set it up to where you think that they're at somebody's house and they're someplace else they opened this door this gate and now they didn't deal with it back then oh they never sat down and prayed about it they never sought it through they never wondered what it would do how would it affect this and how it would affect that and yet all this propaganda all this ideas all these thinkings all this way of attitudes and all this great thing that they've been they kept coming through these Gates and coming through these Gates and coming through these Gates until now just recently they said that 1 in four teenage girls between the ages of 12 and 18 have contemplated suicide seriously the very thought of it people then used to think like that because there was hope but there's so much negativity about our errors not going to be breathable and our water's not going to be drinkable and oh some people are trying to get to the moon I like I like what the prophet said I want to go past the moon so fast that you can't even see it it's such a pressure on them so much things that they see and so many things that they're watching they start comparing themselves you cannot compare yourself to something that's not real you can't it's affecting them 30 of high school students I'm trying to tell you the gate's been opened and the enemy came in like a flood 30 percent one in three students in high school is trying to identify themselves as either gay or lesbian one in three they don't do that naturally no that thought has been sowed into them they don't want no distinction they don't want no distinction between men and women they want everybody to be a robot everybody to be equal everybody to be a clone no personal identity no sexual identity it could no personality they've opened the gate suicides are up almost 200 percent amongst teenagers why would a young person want to take their life the prophet said I feel sorry for because they opened the gate they open the gate to artificial intelligence and guess what they're trying to do now they're trying to close the gate we don't want any internet anymore for any children under 12. can you imagine they get them all addicted because everybody's being lazy they're they're all addicted to it they all got it they communicate with one another they can be whoever they want to be you can imagine who you're talking to you can imagine what they think about whatever it is and now they're saying oh we've got to stop this we got to make laws that keeps us from coming into our children it's affecting them it's affecting them in school it's affecting their lives it's affecting their decision making they're making decisions that they normally wouldn't make yeah now they're trying to stop the madness because they opened the gate they've opened the gate and they're realizing they've got a monster in the house they've got a monster in the city I know we've had people that's worked and and in in the social uh with the child protection agencies and things like that they understand the amount of drug addiction the amount of alcohol addiction amount of the things that are in their life why is that because they open the gate and all this time he's been standing at the gate knocking wanting to come in but they wouldn't open the gate they allowed everything else to come through that gate but the word of God and now we're in a fix and I don't want to be Doomsday because there's no Doom for the believer because he's got to kick it out of here Hallelujah you know what I mean he's got the he's got he's got his token in his hand he has a token applied the price has been paid I'm leaving I'm on the next train out of here praise God you know what I mean it's it's it's settled for me they're doing everything they can and they don't know what to do because they're not taking the answer Christ is the answer for every problem they're trying to find a social way to fix a social problem a kingdom cannot be divided against itself they're trying to use the devil to fix the devil it's like a crooked car mechanic you bring your car in to fix something he fixes it and breaks something else and he shakes your hand he says next time you have a problem come see me you know about a week later something else is wrong oh that's no let me look at that oh he knows exactly what it is he has it fixed in 10 minutes and a special deal just for you that's what Satan's always saying just for you you can handle it it doesn't apply to you that's everybody else is not he's at our gate and we've got to take control of the gates we've got to possess the gates we can't allow things just to go on uh and accept things as they've come and think it out and say what do I want to be what kind of Christian do I want to be what kind of believer do I want to be what kind of relationship do I want to have with the Lord you know a lot of couples grow apart and a lot of things get into into bad spots because Gates got opened and things came in and the things that came in were never for you in the first place they weren't there to help you they were there to destroy you and he said if a man watched his health and the good Watchman of his house if he knew the thief was going to come that he would be there but Satan now comes as an angel of Light and he he wants he wants to put us under so much pressure that we don't have time to pray about decisions we don't have time to even consider if I Open this gate that's what they did they built those Gates because they want they wanted to know what came into that City they wanted to know where it was going what it was there for what it was doing and what the effect of it would be because if not Jerusalem had been destroyed it's like a trojan horse you remember the story of the Trojan Horse right they built this great big horse and they filled it full of soldiers and they rolled it up to the city and they thought oh this is like a god offering so they rolled it on in and at night the soldiers got out and slayed everybody because Satan appears as an angel of Light and he comes up to your gate and he always goes to the weakest gate and we let things in and it might come in like a little leaven but eventually it starts leavening in the whole lump you start you start living with it and now it's you've got to do you gotta arrange your lifestyle around it because because it just got in there but it keeps wanting to take up more space and more space and more space your job can consume your whole life if you let it it can take up every space you've got every hour you've got if you can if you don't get there and eventually say I have got to close this gate I have got to close it I cannot let this gate remain because it keeps getting bigger and wider and more people coming through it and now it's becoming Avenue it started out as a straw now it's a pipeline and not only that he's bringing everything with it all kinds of other thoughts all kinds of other attitudes all kinds of other feelings and pretty soon you don't even know what's going on because we don't deal with it at the door we've got to have control over our gates you say well how am I going to get control over this gate Christ is the answer the word is the answer you've got to go possess that gate you've got to go right there and you've got to just possess that gate you know Goliath he wanted to use that gate of being a great warrior great big guy you know what I mean that's what he wanted to use to possess Israel he wanted to use the Gate of his strength the Gate of his might the Gate of his experience that was going to be his entrance to take over Israel think of it and he baits them come on who will come out and and fight me let's save lives that's not what Henry Van Winkle did he said Give me liberty or give me death he pulled all the Spears in them oh they said oh let's let's let's save lives you send your best I'll send our best Israel forgot their best was God's man that was the gate that Satan was trying to use to overtake Israel and here comes Little David up there he says who's this uncircumcised philistine he said I'm not buying this gate I'm not buying this boast who is he to defile the armies of the Living God when are we going to stand up and say who is this that's defiling the Bride of Jesus Christ and not let it into my life I'm not letting it on to my computer I'm not letting it on my radio I'm not going to talk about it I'm not going to associate with it who is this devil they're trying to come through this gate to get to the people I love amen Josh not you it's affecting it affects all of us pray for me I need it who is this guy what did he use he used Grace he is the Word of Promise and he went out there and he possessed that gate that gate looked big that gate looked powerful all the armies of this rules afraid of that gate but one little man with the word of God closed that gate Goliath I'm here to close the gate oh he's always got an answer boy if you close this gate I'm going to put you on that tree and the birds are going to eat your eyes out well I'm going to cut your head off don't you believe you can cut that head off don't you believe you can kick them back out that gate all of them you're not going to leave none of it behind nothing not going to compromise you're out of here I've got a title deed to my life I've got the grace of God I got the spirit of God that'll Lead Me In All truth and righteousness I can get this fixed I am not going to let my life fall apart I'm not going to let my marriage fall apart I'm not going to let my children fall apart I'm gonna have to find those open Gates I'm gonna have to go possess them I'm gonna have to go close them I'm here to fight I'm here to win thank you you can't come in this gate no more who's watching the gates Lord Jesus give me your spirit give me I save that I may see give me ice have then I can find the gates that he's coming through give me I said I can find where he's getting in you ever had mice I hope you've never I haven't been that fortunate but you start looking for the holes where is he coming in at where's he coming in at how's he getting in here you get this great big old rat I ain't got one this baby you get a great big old rat as big as this thing here they get that big I get as big as a cat and you find out he's coming through a little hole like that you say you're gonna be kidding me how do you get into that thing he presses his way through oh nobody wants to think about the devil you know who's got to think about the devil more than ever as you young ladies all the garbage they're trying to feed you you know almost you because they'll lie to you and think you've got to be anorexic to be pretty don't marry a guy just because he thinks you're pretty and a guy ought to know better than to marry a girl because she's quote unquote what the world calls pretty Beauty to a Christian's character you see that Godly character you see that sister that they'll tell you that's what that's what a Son of God wants somebody that can be a good children you don't want all this nonsense out there all this trash that they're feeding everybody all right well what's happened we've opened that gate now the world might not be able to close their gate but the bride's going to close their gate they're going to close his Gates by opening our gate to the one who's standing there and knocking you gotta be able to look over your city Nehemiah got up and he drove out in secret if I could say it this way because I'm talking about when I'm reading the Bible and part of this whole thing that we're going through is to encourage you to read your Bible to see things in the scripture to use the stories and place them in your life to me Nehemiah getting up in the dark of the night and getting on his thing he was in his prayer closet amen he was in his secret place he was there looking at it and surveying the outcome he was looking what it was going to take and every time you ought to see us they have some beautiful pictures of what the old Rubble looked like and every time he saw it he'd go but I believe there was something in him that said my God is more than able my God is more than able My Father Abraham had a promise that he possessed the gates of his enemies like Moses amen amen Moses comes down to the Red Sea and here's the Egyptians behind them right the Red Sea was a gate it was a closed gate if if something didn't happen to that gate then everybody started saying oh no the Red Seas in front of us and the rivers behind us we're doomed let's just go back let's just go back let's don't press forward you understand Satan is trying to make it look like it's impossible for you to press forward and to become a real Christian it's impossible for you to pray for the sick it's impossible for you to lead somebody to Christ it's impossible for you to to to comfort somebody and to be a real Christian they're even crying out against Christianity they're blaming Christianity for the social conditions of the world you talk about a tricky devil it's all Jesus's fault if he would just give this whole Kingdom to me then we could get this thing in order where everybody be happy yeah they'll get you in a room and stick Artificial Intelligence on your head and you can be there like a vegetable oh they've got it what do they call those things that they put on their head and you'll see somebody there going they don't even know where they are they're in a hard official world artificial world gets artificial results when they turn the button off all their peace is gone all their Joy is gone all their comfort is gone all their patience is gone all their goodness is gone other brotherly kindness is gone they don't have nothing I don't want to be like that I don't want to be like that I want to be a Christian I want the love of God shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy Spirit I want the Holy Spirit to become my gate watcher I need the Holy Spirit to watch my Gates I need him to give me notification what the Holy Spirit does it convicts us a sin it leads us and guides us into all truth and righteousness that's what the holy spirit is it's a gate Watcher what good does it do you if you shout and dance and I believe in that's wonderful but if you don't got somebody watching the gate some gates we just need to lock possess blocked up and finish I'm done with you you're not coming through this thing anymore and then you can maybe move on to the next gate but some of us got so many gates open we don't know where to start I tell you where to start start on your knees in your closet saying Lord my life's a wreck amen I need you to come help close these Gates I need you to open up other Gates because you've got to have a gate for him to come into Gates have coming in too you got to have a way that his Spirit comes in and deals with you you got to have a gate to your spirit in your heart believe me if you crack it that much he'll find a way in light will come in the smallest pinhole and it'll illuminate more space than you can ever imagine you've got to have ways to open gates to your spirit you've got to sit down and read your Bible and open that gate addictions are terrible things they become they it's a gate that gets you the way you think the way you act the way you look at things it's a it's a driving Factor and the only way to break those is to be able to look at it In a Different Light and Jesus said I am the light of the world I am the way I am the truth I am the life no man could come unto the father but by me he says I am the door to the Sheepfold I'm the gate and you're going to have places that you open up things that you do in your life whether it's a good work lay for yourself a pattern of good work go help somebody go Comfort somebody pray about giving somebody an offering there's got to be gates in your life where he can come in and live through you and work through you and do things through you a lot of us had no open gates to him we've got no works we're not testifying my our noses are in textbooks when you're all done what do you know you know what you get when you're all done you get to walk across the stage you get a piece of paper in your hand and you get some guy that says hey thank you for your sixty thousand dollars and then you got to go out and find a job you'd be educated if the guy don't like you tough I'll just testify about David Davey barely got out of high school don't mean that bad Davey you're not here to defend yourself but I know you're a lot like me at least he got farther than I did he showed up to a job fair no qualifications no educations no certifications whatsoever nothing nothing he he couldn't go there and put his Hope on his certification well I've got uh CP3 you know somebody caught that you know or or or something like that no he just went in there and talked to the guy he said what are you doing here I thought I'd come look around she was the job the guy liked them Davey's very personable you know he's got a real gift to minister to people and uh I remember Doug Hughes when David and Matthew and Aaron they all got converted WQ is a great friend of mine he meant you know his story his eyes and everything he said he said them boys are out at school passing out books he said I wouldn't doubt if all three of them are preachers anyway David Goes Up talks to the guy says Ah but you know David just everything's cool you know no problem and the guy likes him you know and then no pressure he says this place is interesting you know a lot of Geeks here and the guy says well he said so you want a job he said yeah yeah pretty good I'll take a job he said if you can pass the training I'll give you a job he passes the training he gets a job he starts out selling computer parts he moves over to another company and moves to another company and now I don't I don't know I don't know if I can explain what he does he's an account manager writing contracts or or something like that God Will Make A Way God will open the gate God provided a sacrifice God is Jehovah Jireh we got to open the gates for him and we've got to close the gates it's gate closing time it's gate opening time if you are going to have a city a personality A Life That's thriving you've got to have control of your Gates you've got to have control of your Gates you can't let people making that determine Nation for you and I don't care what consequences the enemy lies to you about Jesus Christ said I will not leave you I will not forsake you I'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness and the righteous shall not beg bread end a story Satan can't walk through that gate but you can there's Gates that are open for you to walk through this Bible is a list of thousands of promised Gates that you can walk through you can walk through the gate of healing you can walk through the gate of Deliverance you can walk through the gate a council you can walk through the gate of restoration but let me tell you there's a rule in hunting and there's a rule in Land Management when you go through a gate you close it and we need to close some gates and open some others and I think in this great story of Nehemiah a man went out and he looked and he saw a immense task he said but we can build these walls and he said we can build these Gates and we can take control of Jerusalem what comes in and what goes out because they had a temple they wanted to protect him and a place of worship that they wanted to worship God and in ladyocia their spots and wrinkles in the feast and they contaminate the offering to God and if we can start shutting off the contamination if you young men you young people take control of your life cut the garbage out old people get rid of the old habits get rid of the old gossips get rid of those things close out all the negative thoughts and all the stuff forget what happened yesterday let's press for a higher calling let's shut the gates and open the gates for the spirit of God and for Revelation to come into our lives and Enlighten us and be a lamp under our feet so we know what direction we're going to what kind of atmosphere we want to control because remember the gates is what controls the atmosphere and in the right atmosphere Anything Can Happen the right mental attitude to any promise of God will bring it to pass I don't wouldn't say that we're lacking anything I'm just trying to say the holy spirit is trying to lead us into a greater Victorious life than we've ever had one where we can Minister the love of God can be shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit and we can affect the lost and dying people isn't that what your heart's desire is God bless you this morning understand do you love them this morning our musicians come let us bow our heads and I want to give you an opportunity not for me because if I had 10 hands I'd have to raise them all but for you to be honest with yourself this morning in front of the Lord and lift your hand up our heads bowed our hearts bowed before and say Lord I got some gates open I got some old bitternesses that Satan's coming through I got some habits and things I don't want to let go of [Music] Lord I want to lift my hand to you and tell you I need you to come watch my gate I need you to help me close this gate this morning that that the devil's coming through lord it's affecting my whole atmosphere it's affecting my peace it's affecting my patience it's like the prophet said I just get to the place I just pop off and I do things and I say things that I normally wouldn't say Lord I've had the problem a long long time but I read a scripture that says a thousand years is but a day with you and father when I was a sinner you already died for me Lord I know you're true but I've never invited you into my life to help me close this gate Lord now I want to close it this morning maybe you'd lift your hand this morning say Lord my heart's a wreck my emotions are a wreck I'm I am in an impossible place and I heard a messenger say that all things are possible and he took it from the scripture and he proved that that was true Lord I need Restoration in my life I need your spirit in my life Lord I'm lifting my hand tonight just to let you know Lord I I want you to see that I'm I'm needy and I can't call you down lord but your word calls me up into your presence and I'm lifting my hands to say Lord I so want
