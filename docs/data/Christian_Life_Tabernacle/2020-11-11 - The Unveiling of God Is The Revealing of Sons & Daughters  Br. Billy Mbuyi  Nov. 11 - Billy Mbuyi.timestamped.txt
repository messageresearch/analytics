[2:02] be of help to all of us amen uh let's
[2:07] turn our Bibles let's open to uh Romans
[2:10] chapter uh
[2:11] 8 a very familiar scripture reading
[2:14] we're going to start from verse
[2:16] [Applause]
[2:24] 14 Romans 8
[2:27] and4 it says for as many as I led by the
[2:31] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[2:35] for ye have not received the spirit of
[2:37] bondage again for fear but ye have
[2:40] received the spirit of the adoption
[2:42] where where we cry whereby we cry ABA
[2:45] father it said the spirit itself Beth
[2:48] witness with our spirit that we are the
[2:51] children of God and if children then HS
[2:56] of God and join air with Jesus if so be
[3:00] that this that we suffer with him and we
[3:04] shall that we may be also glorified
[3:08] together it says for I reckon that the
[3:11] suffering of this present time are not
[3:15] worthy to be compared with the glory
[3:18] which shall be revealed in us for the
[3:21] earnest expectation of of of the
[3:25] creation waiteth for the manifestation
[3:28] of the sons of God for the creature was
[3:31] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[3:35] the reason of him who had subjected the
[3:39] same in hope now I want you to realize
[3:42] what he said the creature was made
[3:44] subject to vanity not by his own will
[3:47] but that's how it was made it says
[3:49] because the the the create the creature
[3:52] itself also shall be delivered from the
[3:55] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[3:57] Liberty of the children of God and I
[4:00] so like this I I'll just Paul is
[4:05] continually just reminding us the
[4:07] children of God the children of God the
[4:10] children of God it said for we know that
[4:13] the whole creation grown and travaileth
[4:16] in pain together until now not only they
[4:21] but ourselves also which have the first
[4:24] fruit of the spirit even we also grown
[4:28] within ourselves waiting for the
[4:30] adoption to with the Redemption of our
[4:33] body he said for we are saved by hope
[4:37] but hope that is not seen is not hope
[4:40] for what a man seeth why do where why
[4:45] they do does he hope for for if we hope
[4:49] for what we see we see not then we do
[4:53] with patience wait for it likewise the
[4:56] spirit also helped our
[4:58] infirmities for we
[5:02] know for we know not what we should pray
[5:05] for as we ought as we ought but the
[5:09] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[5:12] with groaning which cannot be uttered
[5:15] thank you Lord and He that searcheth the
[5:18] heart knoweth what is in the mind of the
[5:21] spirit because he maketh intercession
[5:24] for the Saints according to the will of
[5:27] God and then he says and we know that
[5:30] all things work together for good for
[5:33] them that love God to them who are
[5:36] called according to his purpose for whom
[5:40] he did forne he also did he predestinate
[5:44] to be conformed to the image of his son
[5:47] and that he might be the first be be the
[5:50] firstborn among many Brethren it says
[5:53] more over whom did he he did
[5:56] predestinate them he also called whom he
[5:59] called then he also Justified whom he
[6:02] justify them he also glorify what shall
[6:06] we say of these things if God be for us
[6:10] who could be against us let's also turn
[6:13] to one more scripture reading in
[6:15] Philippians um chapter
[6:19] 2 chapter 2 he
[6:22] says if there be if there if there be
[6:26] therefore any consolation in Christ if
[6:30] any comfort of love if any Fellowship of
[6:33] the spirit any bows of Mercy fulfill ye
[6:37] my joy that ye be likeminded having the
[6:41] same
[6:42] love uh being of one Accord and one mind
[6:46] let not let not let nothing be done
[6:49] through strive of V Glory but in
[6:52] lonliness of Mind Let each esteem other
[6:55] better than themselves look not every
[6:58] man on his own thing
[7:00] on his own things but every man on the
[7:02] things of others let this mind be in you
[7:05] which was also in Christ Jesus whom
[7:08] being in a form of God thought it not
[7:11] robbery to be equal with God but made
[7:14] himself of no reputation and took upon
[7:18] him the form of a servant and was made
[7:22] in likeness of man and being found in
[7:25] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[7:28] became obedient unto to death even the
[7:30] death of the Cross wherefore God also
[7:33] had highly exalted him and given him a
[7:36] name that is above every name that at
[7:40] the name of Jesus every knee shall bow
[7:42] every that the name of Jesus every knee
[7:45] should bow all things in heaven and
[7:48] things on earth and things under the
[7:51] Earth and that every tongue should
[7:54] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[7:57] glory of God the Father amen father we
[7:59] ask you bless your word to us we commit
[8:01] ourselves to your hands in the name of
[8:03] Jesus Christ we pray
[8:05] amen God bless you may have your
[8:11] seats amen we'll try not to be too long
[8:14] tonight
[8:19] but am man just have a a little thought
[8:23] in on our mind
[8:25] and we'll give you the title as we move
[8:29] along
[8:30] um I was just thinking about some of the
[8:34] things that our pastor has been talking
[8:36] about um even about the time that we're
[8:39] living in and what uh a time where a
[8:44] faithless generation like the scriptures
[8:46] calls it a faithless generation where
[8:49] man has rejected faith and embraced uh
[8:52] science and and you begin to look uh we
[8:56] can uh look at the Bible and we know
[8:58] butam say says often and and and so many
[9:01] times it would say that you know if I
[9:04] was asked in what age I would live in
[9:06] this is the age and this is the age and
[9:09] yet we sit here we look at the
[9:11] wickedness that's around us we look at
[9:13] just the confusion and all those things
[9:15] and and and what we need to come to the
[9:18] realization is uh uh to an unbeliever
[9:21] this is scary this is the scariest
[9:24] condition that you can ever be that's
[9:25] why people are Marching and and fighting
[9:28] and all kinds of things because this
[9:30] that's all they have but to the believer
[9:32] it's a glorious time because it's a
[9:35] glorious time because this is the
[9:37] Fulfillment of scripture this is the
[9:39] Fulfillment of Prophecy we can look at
[9:42] the world's condition and come together
[9:44] tonight and say that we can look outside
[9:46] and say that today this scripture is
[9:49] fulfilled and everything that's playing
[9:51] out there everything that we look out
[9:53] there that's happening it's happening
[9:56] exactly according to the prophecy that
[9:58] was given at the end time if you think
[10:01] about people and and and and the nature
[10:03] and and the way people are acting and I
[10:05] was talking about David uh the other day
[10:08] I said I was so amazed even as you was
[10:10] reading those things I was following uh
[10:13] one of the speeches that the the
[10:15] president-elect gave and everything and
[10:18] one of the the point that he wanted to
[10:20] make was that we and I'm just
[10:22] paraphrasing it they says that we will
[10:24] follow science whatever science tells us
[10:27] to do that's what we're going to do
[10:29] whatever this experts this educated
[10:32] people whatever they come up with
[10:33] whatever they tell us to do that's what
[10:35] we're going to do in other words science
[10:37] has become their God and I thought about
[10:40] there's another group of people who have
[10:42] not taken science and and God is their
[10:46] God faith is what they've been given for
[10:49] them to walk by it's not because we
[10:51] realize that this world was not framed
[10:53] by science science can take it and tell
[10:56] you that this is this many years old
[10:58] this is this you can put this together
[11:00] and do that but we understand the
[11:01] scripture tell us it was by the word of
[11:04] God that this was put together so we can
[11:06] come to a place and we begin to realize
[11:09] you know the the the the world out there
[11:11] is is making history United stat has
[11:14] made history this is the first elected
[11:17] woman of color and a woman in the
[11:19] position of Vice President you can look
[11:22] at that people are rejoicing over those
[11:24] things and
[11:25] realize that how that this uh with
[11:28] they're making advance ments they can
[11:30] claim they're making great achievement
[11:32] but we realize as even as our Pastor
[11:34] said as the world is making his
[11:36] achievement we need to pay attention to
[11:39] the achievement that God is making these
[11:42] things are not just happening over the
[11:44] blue and we just look and say we are a
[11:46] people that have been warned that have
[11:49] been given a word for us to look at
[11:51] what's happening out there and be able
[11:53] to look at the word of God and say that
[11:55] this today is the scripture being
[11:57] fulfilled and as this is happening I
[12:00] need to look at what is my portion in
[12:02] the word what is my portion in the
[12:04] scripture because as that is being
[12:06] fulfill God is also fulfilling something
[12:10] God is not sitting on the sideline God
[12:12] is fulfilling his word and and we we
[12:15] know we don't have a portion with what's
[12:17] happening out there but it's a portion
[12:19] for us in the scripture for us to also
[12:22] fulfill so we could see uh how that they
[12:26] they put their hearts and they put
[12:28] everything that they have
[12:29] in in science and they're hoping that
[12:31] they can come up with a way for them uh
[12:34] uh to make life better they always try
[12:36] to improve they a home that was built 10
[12:40] years ago the home that's built today
[12:42] they make Improvement by science they do
[12:44] it better they achieve it they go
[12:46] forward and they do all those things and
[12:49] the prophet tells us perhaps I'll don't
[12:51] know if I'll get time to get to it but
[12:53] it tells us all the achievement of
[12:55] science all of it amounts to death
[12:59] there's everything you can take
[13:01] everything that science can achieve all
[13:03] of that amounts to nothing but death
[13:06] there's nothing that it can bring
[13:08] outside of death and the only thing that
[13:10] can bring life is the word of Mighty God
[13:13] and that's why we could sit here rejoice
[13:15] and say that we are people that have
[13:17] received the word of mighty God we have
[13:20] received the word that is been allotted
[13:21] for our generation and by receiving that
[13:24] word we can produce life amen you you
[13:27] look at the the the the systems of the
[13:30] economy our Pro Pastor talked about the
[13:33] systems how that they have a system of
[13:35] Education that's been carried over and
[13:38] that same system is been even reproduced
[13:40] in the church and all those things you
[13:43] you look at the system you can look at
[13:45] the economy on average every 10 years it
[13:48] has to
[13:50] crash if you go look at it every 10
[13:53] years it has to
[13:55] crash and as it crash they come and they
[13:57] put and they they fix it and they bring
[13:59] it back up and and you could be sure
[14:02] within 10 another 15 years it's going to
[14:04] crash again and that's the best that men
[14:07] can produce that's the best system that
[14:09] they can come up with they can come up
[14:11] today they'll give you medicine tomorrow
[14:13] they'll give you something a medicine
[14:15] that's better than what they give you
[14:17] before and they're making achievement
[14:18] and they're trying to advance but we
[14:20] realize that God has a system that need
[14:23] no
[14:24] improvement God has a system it was
[14:27] perfect from the day it was spoken and
[14:30] that system is his word you eat his word
[14:32] you shall live you reject his word you
[14:35] die and that system is perfect and God
[14:38] has never come down to say well I need
[14:40] to improve my system because the way I
[14:42] created it it wasn't perfect it's been
[14:45] perfect from day one it's perfect today
[14:47] and it's that same because the scripture
[14:49] tells us that heaven and earth will pass
[14:51] away but my word shall never pass away
[14:54] so God's system is what we want to hang
[14:57] on to tonight brother speaks in the
[15:00] message uh the unfailing uh his
[15:02] unfailing word of a
[15:04] promise the his unfailing words of
[15:08] Promise he speaks and he says in
[15:11] paragraph 34 he says well and another
[15:13] thing he says every 2,000 years
[15:16] something has to happen on Earth he says
[15:19] and the politics and everything gives
[15:22] out God has to send help from Heaven and
[15:26] the first 2,000 years the world was
[15:28] destroyed with with water the second
[15:30] 2,000 years Christ came and in
[15:33] 1964 and they claim we it says we are
[15:37] about 17 years short of that so every
[15:40] 2,000 years something happened every
[15:44] 2,000 years the world come to an end
[15:47] every the as it says this first one the
[15:50] first 2,000 years God came and destroyed
[15:52] the world with the flood and and he came
[15:54] and we're realizing after that Christ
[15:56] came and he poured off his blood on on
[15:59] the earth and so that we could go on but
[16:02] then we realize that the same Earth will
[16:05] be judged and it will be destroy with
[16:07] fire and we live in the time where the
[16:09] Earth will be destroyed with fire he
[16:12] says in the message the world is falling
[16:14] apart again it says the world has met
[16:18] has met its
[16:19] Doom every 2,000 years we know the
[16:23] system has has fell apart it Fells apart
[16:28] it says it fell apart in the day of Noah
[16:31] the day of Christ it fall apart and here
[16:34] comes again it repeats
[16:36] 1964 does it it says what does it live
[16:40] it says uh 30 36 years to another 2,000
[16:45] year to another uh to another 2,000 the
[16:50] the 21st century the 21st century coming
[16:54] up what happened the work it says the
[16:57] work still has to come
[16:59] still has to be cut short Jesus says the
[17:03] corruption of this day the elect will be
[17:06] deceive if he wouldn't be if he if he
[17:09] wouldn't be saved if it would be
[17:11] possible it says there you are and the
[17:14] calendar tells us according to science
[17:17] what we about
[17:19] 15 15 years off of that we are behind on
[17:23] the Roman Calendar according to the
[17:25] Jewish calendar that we are about 15 it
[17:28] says 20 uh we are 15 or 20 years behind
[17:31] on that it says so where are we at we
[17:35] see Nations breaking Israel Awakening
[17:38] the signs that the Bible for foretold
[17:41] for this day we see the mechanic things
[17:44] taking place now it says now the spirit
[17:47] the dynamic of the promised word to get
[17:50] into his into his church and drive them
[17:54] to Calvary under to the Rapture and
[17:57] there we are yeah so it's it's it's when
[18:00] this is happening that God in this time
[18:03] is bringing his Dynamic into his church
[18:06] in order for him to bring us into a
[18:09] place where we could go into the Rapture
[18:11] is when this conditions are seen out
[18:14] there when we can uh uh uh look at the
[18:16] world out there and realize that this is
[18:18] exactly what was prophesied you know I
[18:21] was telling Brother David out there it's
[18:23] amazing where you know you you you you
[18:25] have people that have left this message
[18:27] and they claim you because it's not true
[18:30] because they didn't uh they couldn't
[18:32] find any historical record of a bridge
[18:35] that fall or they couldn't uh uh testify
[18:38] of something that somebody said and all
[18:39] of those things but yet there's a group
[18:42] of people every time they read the
[18:44] message it becomes so real every time
[18:47] they look at the news they read the news
[18:49] and everything that every time they look
[18:51] at the events that's happening out there
[18:53] they can't help but see the word of God
[18:55] coming to pass every time they're turn
[18:58] around every time they read a quote it
[19:01] makes the world it looks at everything
[19:03] that's happening there it makes it so
[19:05] crisp and clear it makes it so to such a
[19:08] place where there's doubt and it's
[19:10] peeling off the doubt from the heart
[19:12] it's increasing the Revelation it's
[19:14] bringing to them to a place where that
[19:16] rapturing Faith giv strengthening up
[19:18] it's bringing them to a place where they
[19:20] know that this word is the real word of
[19:22] Mighty
[19:24] God what a contrast you know the
[19:27] difference is in death there was nothing
[19:29] to believe it with but in you God has
[19:32] placed something that when you see the
[19:34] word come to pass there's something
[19:37] within your heart that desire to see the
[19:39] god manifested there something within
[19:41] your heart that looks at the word and
[19:43] God reveals himself too and I want to
[19:46] say this God hides himself but one them
[19:50] tells us it's in God's nature to hide
[19:52] himself but he says he hides himself to
[19:55] the unbeliever and he reveals himself to
[19:57] the believer he reveals himself to those
[20:00] that seek to know those that wants to
[20:03] know those that wants to see him oh so
[20:06] we would see Jesus some of them looked
[20:08] at him and called him be
[20:10] elab some of them looked at him and they
[20:12] said this is the son of Mary and Joseph
[20:15] some of them looked at him this is the
[20:17] son of a carpenter but all when the
[20:19] elected on saw him when when those that
[20:22] were called saw him when they looked at
[20:25] him they saw
[20:26] God at the same exact person one group
[20:29] looked at him they call him all kinds of
[20:31] name but the other group looked at him
[20:33] they said that this is the who are who
[20:36] do you say this man is he says you are
[20:38] the son of the Living God and he looked
[20:41] at him and he says flesh and blood has
[20:43] not revealed that to you amen God is not
[20:47] known by science God is not known by
[20:50] intellectual understanding God is known
[20:53] by revelation God is known by him and
[20:56] Revelation is not something that you dig
[20:59] yourself into you study the word of God
[21:01] so much and then you receive Revelation
[21:04] Revelation is a gift of God God so loved
[21:08] the world he will come that he will
[21:10] choose you he will choose an individual
[21:13] and he will deposit something within
[21:15] them that they will believe his word
[21:19] with it has nothing to do with the
[21:21] individual it has everything to do with
[21:25] God thank you Lord Jesus he says right
[21:30] the very thing that created I want you
[21:32] to listen to this this is the same
[21:34] message the world just Fallen apart it
[21:36] says no it says no wonder we are falling
[21:40] apart there's nothing he says the very
[21:45] thing that created the Earth the very
[21:48] the very thing that we put that that was
[21:51] put here from for for the earth to turn
[21:55] on the very thing that systems
[21:59] and everything else was to revolve
[22:02] around the word of God by God he framed
[22:07] the world it says Einstein said this
[22:11] there's only one explanation of the
[22:13] scripture only one explanation of the
[22:16] world being in existence he said in
[22:18] Hebrews 11 he says by faith it says by
[22:23] faith we understand the World by the
[22:26] word of God by the word of God that the
[22:29] world were framed together by the word
[22:32] by the word of God that's all there's no
[22:35] one that can tell how it hangs there in
[22:38] the air or how it could turn around and
[22:41] make the 20 uh and make its 20 uh 24
[22:45] hours around the equator or so forth
[22:48] like that or around the orbit anywhere
[22:51] come back in the same spot it says never
[22:54] misses a second every Star turning in
[22:57] its cycle like that it says helping one
[23:01] another as they go around no one can
[23:04] tell you that amen no one can tell you
[23:06] how perfectly and all they know is if
[23:10] any of it if any of it will come out of
[23:12] the orbit if any of it will stop doing
[23:15] what it's doing the whole world will
[23:18] cramble but yet they can't explain what
[23:20] dynamic what force and what just puts it
[23:23] together so it can function the way it's
[23:25] functioning right amen so I was like I
[23:29] said I was thinking about some of the
[23:30] things our pastor talked about and and I
[23:33] just got some quy I would like for us to
[23:36] read uh to just go over and and some of
[23:39] the things it's been talking about in
[23:41] focus to science it says science has a
[23:44] tree that they that they can climb he
[23:47] says but they can only climb so far and
[23:50] then that's as far as they can go that's
[23:53] the end of science research they kill
[23:55] themselves that's right yes sir that's
[23:58] that's the end of science they kill
[24:00] themselves it says but
[24:02] ye but it says but you see uh on the
[24:06] other tree on the tree of Faith there's
[24:09] no end to it you can just go on that's
[24:13] the tree where we should be on tonight
[24:16] the Tree of Life the tree of faith it
[24:19] says not headed towards the mo or
[24:21] towards the heaven or headed towards God
[24:24] but headed towards God for the Glorious
[24:27] Rapture of the Lord Jesus in his
[24:30] presence in his power is every life out
[24:33] of Heaven not coming down not making us
[24:37] join church not coming down even to make
[24:40] even even to make us shout but but
[24:44] coming down to let his whole life live
[24:48] through
[24:49] us now I want you to hold on to that
[24:51] because we're come back to
[24:53] it what what what this Faith is doing is
[24:58] for the I'm not talking about a partial
[25:00] Life of Christ I'm not talking about a
[25:03] measure of Life of Christ but so that
[25:06] his whole life remember the scripture
[25:09] says that the works that I do ye shall
[25:12] do
[25:13] also and and often time we look and you
[25:16] know say well some of the same word but
[25:18] I want to say this tonight that God has
[25:21] reserved certain works that even he
[25:24] himself when he was in the body of Jesus
[25:27] did not do right
[25:28] that he reserved those works so that
[25:31] only you and I can do those works so
[25:34] when I say the works that I do it's the
[25:36] same Christ doing the same works but
[25:39] he's in a different
[25:40] flesh it's the same Christ doing the
[25:43] same works but he in a different form
[25:46] it's the same God when we say you know
[25:49] often time you get amazed we say oh we
[25:52] come here to church what two or three I
[25:54] gather on my name I'm in the midst and
[25:56] then and then we look at one another we
[25:58] begin to look Perhaps it is in the air
[26:01] or somewhere no it's the same works it's
[26:03] the same God and the same God where is
[26:06] he is in you when you say we two or
[26:09] three I got to my them I'm in the midst
[26:11] it's because you have brought him here
[26:14] it's not because when we go out of here
[26:16] God doesn't remain in the empty building
[26:19] this is not his place of dwelling we
[26:21] bring him here and we go out with him
[26:24] God is in his people
[26:26] [Applause]
[26:31] just getting ahead of myself
[26:34] now
[26:37] so so he
[26:39] says live and Heavenly live in the
[26:43] Heavenly carry out yourself till you see
[26:47] things that is to come that were things
[26:51] that is to come was which is and shall
[26:54] come lifted up above anything that the
[26:57] church has since since the day that
[27:01] Christ was on Earth and you are enjoying
[27:04] it today sure we are we are in a great
[27:08] age friends a great time an astronaut
[27:11] age God give us astronauts give us men
[27:15] and women daring men daring wom did you
[27:19] know John Glenn them he says them to and
[27:24] them have to do what uh
[27:29] did you know that John Glenn and them
[27:32] have to do with them they stepped into
[27:34] the bubble they were Pioneers he says
[27:38] what God he says what God wants what God
[27:41] wants God wants Pioneers to his word
[27:45] astronaut who will take the things which
[27:48] have got which have gotten not be
[27:50] satisfied with it but going on God is
[27:54] making achievement Amen in other words
[27:57] the things which have been promised the
[27:59] things which have been made known the
[28:02] things which we know are in store for us
[28:04] God is looking for man and woman that
[28:07] will take those things and run with it
[28:09] he's looking for Pioneers you say well
[28:12] you know this has never happened God
[28:14] wants to do it by
[28:16] you no man has never done this before
[28:19] now I tell you that that first man had
[28:22] to have inspiration and has to have
[28:24] something within their heart for them to
[28:26] be the first to do it
[28:28] you know Mary didn't know about anybody
[28:31] who's had a baby without meeting a
[28:33] man right in the time of Lazarus there
[28:36] was never such thing as a dead man who
[28:39] who started his body started to corrupt
[28:41] who stood up and who was raised they
[28:44] didn't know about those things but yet
[28:47] there were Believers there were those
[28:49] that had faith and there were those and
[28:51] in us but the scripture tells us that
[28:54] Enoch as he came as a type of the
[28:56] Rapture in other words the reason why
[28:59] Enoch was in the Bible was just so that
[29:02] when we come to this age that we can
[29:04] make a reference to something that God
[29:06] had already done so we can know that as
[29:09] he done it he's going to do it again and
[29:12] if he had not done it before and he's
[29:14] promis it in his word that same God is
[29:16] able to bring it to pass why because
[29:19] it's his
[29:23] word in the message conflict between God
[29:26] and Satan it says but sons of God they
[29:30] stay humble they stay away from such
[29:33] thing as and the relieve upon God
[29:36] knowing that they were going to inherit
[29:38] all things all things in the earth now I
[29:43] I just jumped I want you to see the
[29:45] characterization that he's giving even
[29:47] as we we heard that message set in Z and
[29:50] he says notice this Mar educated
[29:53] Canaanites woman Canaanites woman it
[29:56] says for Canaanite line married The
[29:59] Humble peasant boys of Seth he says and
[30:02] they came and there became and there
[30:06] became Giants and and were
[30:09] renowned we find out that they became
[30:12] great scientists great workers of wood
[30:15] great art it says great smart educated
[30:18] people and they had a great economy they
[30:21] lived in such scientif scientifical age
[30:25] until they buil pyramid that we couldn't
[30:27] build today they build uh uh uh uh fs
[30:31] and many things uh many marks and and
[30:34] and they seen in the rocks in in SS of
[30:38] time that we couldn't produce today
[30:40] because those people leaned upon on
[30:43] their knowledge and became scientist and
[30:46] smart man and renowned man yes and we
[30:50] are told that's going to be repeated it
[30:52] says so people today they are smart
[30:55] they've got all this they do all is so
[30:58] much smarter than we was it says we are
[31:02] we are so smarter than we are we are we
[31:05] are so smart ra uh farther away from God
[31:10] than we were you draw yourself right
[31:13] away all right so in other word here we
[31:16] are we we could say it's the most
[31:19] scientifical age that there was and yet
[31:22] we find out that with science the
[31:25] science that we have man is drawing far
[31:28] and farther away from God we have all
[31:30] kinds of medicine that there is but
[31:33] people are sicker than there ever was we
[31:35] have the greatest economy that there was
[31:38] but yet people are the poorest there
[31:39] were in in in any time we have the
[31:42] greatest this but yet it's not producing
[31:45] in other words man was not science was
[31:48] not supposed to be given as the answer
[31:50] to men's need the men's need was to be
[31:53] answered by the word of God by faith in
[31:56] his word that God was intending to
[31:59] produce it
[32:01] that's listen to this I thought this was
[32:04] he says we find out that in the field
[32:06] today that there are so many things we
[32:09] say we find out that the medical the the
[32:11] medical doctor will say we said to the
[32:15] to to The Surge about the surgeon you
[32:18] don't need a man that can cut you in
[32:20] pieces that can cut you to pieces you
[32:22] don't need you don't need an
[32:25] operation he's nothing but a saw
[32:31] so now that's a medical doctor talking
[32:34] about the surgeon it says then the
[32:36] surgeon will come around and say you
[32:38] don't need a medical a medical doctor
[32:42] sugar
[32:43] pill you need an
[32:45] operation there you are we find the
[32:48] Chiropractic will say about the ASO
[32:52] astropath it says you don't need to you
[32:55] you need a rub on your back you you
[32:57] don't need an adjustment of the bone
[33:00] isn't that amazing yeah you know I I
[33:03] remember I I had a I had my I woke up
[33:05] one day my eyes were just bloodshot and
[33:08] it was just hurting and and so I call
[33:11] one of those tell doctors you you call
[33:14] you know remotely and and it came
[33:16] because the the the the doctor's office
[33:19] the the the eye doctor office was closed
[33:22] so he looked at it and he prescribed an
[33:24] antibiotics so I took it and he was not
[33:26] an eye doctor it was just
[33:28] a generalist so I went and I took it I
[33:30] put it for a couple of days scheduled an
[33:31] appointment went in there and then so I
[33:34] sat down and we began to talk I said
[33:35] yeah I just started a couple of days ago
[33:37] I started to put this he looked at it
[33:39] and says don't ever put that in your
[33:46] eyes he said you'll mess up your eyes
[33:49] with that and I'm looking I'm like so he
[33:52] they want the one told me one thing and
[33:55] the other tells me another thing you go
[33:58] this one it will tell you one thing the
[33:59] other how can not come together but
[34:02] listen to what it says it says it says
[34:05] you don't you don't you and and then the
[34:07] astropath will say you don't need a
[34:09] chiropractor you don't you don't need to
[34:11] you don't you don't want your your neck
[34:14] uh you don't want your neck broken your
[34:16] muscles are tight just adjusted but it
[34:19] says but all of them will say the
[34:22] preacher is a
[34:26] quack the one thing that they all can
[34:29] agree on they cannot agree with one
[34:31] another this one will say I have the
[34:33] best medicine the other one will say I
[34:36] know the way to get you to to get you
[34:38] better this one will send you to a
[34:40] specialist The Specialist will look at
[34:42] you and say I'm going to do this and
[34:44] this you go to another specialist they
[34:45] have a different way you know I I
[34:47] remember I went to a dentist I went and
[34:50] I I I got there they looked at me and
[34:52] say well you know we got to remove this
[34:54] too and not then count about five or six
[34:57] I'm like you know can I just get my
[34:59] tooth clean I'll come back later and
[35:01] then I went and then the next time I
[35:03] decided to go to another one and I go
[35:06] they pick up different teeth than the
[35:08] other one
[35:10] picked I looked at it I said what's
[35:13] going on
[35:14] here so I realized that even and I can
[35:18] say this tonight even within this uh uh
[35:21] knowledge of man there's an economy
[35:24] built behind it when you go to a doctor
[35:26] they got to make money when you go I
[35:28] remember I bring my son to the hospital
[35:30] you know you show up at the emergency
[35:32] room they got to run you through every
[35:34] machine that building is God before they
[35:37] can tell you that there's nothing
[35:41] wrong it's the way it's built that's the
[35:44] system and you tell a man to put his
[35:46] life to rely on that system people do it
[35:49] all the time oh but I'm here to tell you
[35:52] God has a
[35:54] system the system of a man will fail you
[35:57] the system of man is going to is nothing
[36:00] but death but God has a system tonight
[36:03] and it's been right since day one and
[36:06] that system will bring you healing that
[36:08] system will bring you Deliverance that
[36:10] system will provide for you every step
[36:12] of the way and when he done with you
[36:14] that system will take you into
[36:17] Rapture that's the system we need to
[36:20] rely on don't let the word of God Fall
[36:22] by the wayside don't believe what some
[36:25] men because they have a robe what they
[36:27] tell you then you believe him you trust
[36:29] in what God Said and God will vindicate
[36:31] his
[36:37] word all of them can agree on one thing
[36:40] a preacher is a
[36:41] crack that's the only thing that can
[36:43] bring them together so it continues on
[36:46] and in the Great Commission it says it
[36:49] says it says it takes God to it says now
[36:53] it says Brethren you see uh it's
[36:56] something it's says I just want to uh I
[36:59] just want to justify in saying this it's
[37:02] it's a selfish motive it continues on we
[37:05] know the surgeon help we know that the
[37:07] medicine helps we know the chiropractor
[37:10] the astropath pathic it says we know all
[37:13] that helps we know and and then after
[37:16] all it takes God to do the healing
[37:19] regardless of what comes or
[37:22] goes whether it's the surgeon whether
[37:25] it's the medical doctor whether it's a
[37:28] chiropractor it takes God to do the
[37:30] healing God is the only one that can
[37:34] heal there never was a drop of medicine
[37:37] that can ever heal a man or mental
[37:40] balance that that man ever said if he
[37:43] says if he did I could just show you for
[37:46] in a minute it says how foolish it is
[37:49] there's only one Healer and that's God
[37:53] it says and and and as the whole
[37:55] Christian armor is absolutely
[37:57] Supernatural there's nothing natural it
[38:00] can prove it says and I can prove that
[38:02] God there's no more need of Faith but
[38:05] God God but he that cometh to God must
[38:09] believe that he is by faith the whole
[38:12] Christian armor is by faith the whole
[38:15] way we make things happen the whole way
[38:17] things that are not in existence come
[38:19] into existence the whole way that we
[38:22] live and if you as you woke up this
[38:24] morning I tell you you may think you
[38:26] didn't have faith but it's faith that
[38:28] woke you up it's faith that got you in
[38:30] the car it's faith that took you to work
[38:33] it's faith that done all of that you may
[38:35] not realize you have it inside of you
[38:37] but it's faith that does all of those
[38:39] things and if you aband in it it's
[38:44] death amen now let me just skip here and
[38:48] get to my thought what I want to speak
[38:50] tonight I just want to give you what
[38:52] what I what this from those things that
[38:54] I spoken my heart has been on the
[38:56] message the Mighty God unveiled before
[38:59] us the Mighty God unveiled before us and
[39:02] and I want to give you my title is the
[39:05] unveiling of God is the revealing of
[39:07] sons and daughters the unveiling of God
[39:11] is the revealing of sons and daughters
[39:13] but now when you talk about andam speaks
[39:16] about in this message he talks about God
[39:19] he says it was he says that God uh uh
[39:23] men always wanted to know where they
[39:25] came from what are they doing doing here
[39:28] and what the purpose on Earth was and
[39:30] where they're going and then he he he
[39:32] makes a he makes a comment he says but
[39:35] there's only one that can tell him but
[39:37] there's only one that can answer that
[39:39] question and there the one who brought
[39:41] him here and it says that so the the
[39:44] desire is to know the purpose of the
[39:46] existence and the one who can answer to
[39:49] the purpose of the existing is the one
[39:51] who brought you here so he speaks in
[39:54] this message and we know it very well he
[39:56] talks about the great drama he talks
[39:59] about the great drama he talks about how
[40:01] that this little girl went into the
[40:02] school and they talked about this uh uh
[40:05] they had a drama in the school now the
[40:07] word drama is is is a composition of
[40:10] verse or
[40:12] Pros presenting a story in a pandemic uh
[40:16] uh uh in a in a dialogue and it contain
[40:20] conflict of characters particularly one
[40:23] whom perform in the front of the
[40:25] audience in the stage the the person who
[40:28] writes the drama uh is for the stage uh
[40:31] direction is known as a a dramatist so I
[40:36] want you to know so there has to be some
[40:38] conflict when you talk about drama there
[40:40] cannot be drama without conflict so
[40:43] there some uh uh if I could say some
[40:45] nail-biting moment something that just
[40:48] seems like it may go wrong and and
[40:50] something and all of that is done for
[40:52] the purpose of creating the drama and
[40:55] all of those things and I want to say
[40:56] this everything that's happening in the
[40:58] world is a drama everything that's
[41:01] happening in our life is a drama and I
[41:04] and I began to think about this if men
[41:06] of the earth could write the drama and
[41:09] they will have people as actors and you
[41:12] hire actors and to have them to play
[41:14] play different role but when them talks
[41:16] about one kid who played about five
[41:18] different parts and and all those things
[41:20] they come and they play this roles so
[41:22] that at the end they can come up and
[41:24] bring the story perfectly I want to say
[41:27] this if God was to unfold the drama he's
[41:30] going to use real character amen God is
[41:33] not using just some actors or something
[41:36] in his drama if man can do the same God
[41:39] can come and he's using real character
[41:41] God created the devil God created the
[41:45] heavens and the Earth in the threefold
[41:47] purpose bam tells us that God wanted to
[41:50] reveal himself it was something that was
[41:52] within his heart so he has to create
[41:55] this thing he has to create create this
[41:57] environment that he can let this drama
[42:00] play out now he didn't let it just play
[42:03] all smoothly where everything seems to
[42:05] be secure and everything and all of that
[42:07] he included some drama into it he
[42:10] included some nail biting moment where
[42:12] something looks like oh my God it's lost
[42:15] no he had it under control why before
[42:18] the drama can continue before the drama
[42:20] can even start God In His Infinite mind
[42:24] as he was writing the drama and writing
[42:27] the character he secure every single one
[42:30] of those character so that when the
[42:32] drama will play nothing will be
[42:36] lost I tell you when when when the devil
[42:40] came and caused Eve to fall he may have
[42:42] thought that he done something to win
[42:45] hear me thought that was a nail biting
[42:48] moment you look this is the creation of
[42:51] God and now they were created in heaven
[42:53] and now they Fallen apart and and the
[42:56] whole thing is Crum
[42:57] but oh I tell you is a mighty God he's
[43:01] the creator of Heaven and Earth nothing
[43:04] goes past him nothing has escaped his
[43:07] understanding and I tell you we live in
[43:09] this earth and this is where I just want
[43:11] to get to you tonight for you to know
[43:14] when as we sit here we are part of God's
[43:17] drama and it's not even in the sense
[43:20] where it's us trying to play a part no
[43:24] but it's God trying to use your flesh in
[43:27] order to play a
[43:31] part it's God because remember he was
[43:34] the creation of all but whatam says that
[43:36] God hides
[43:38] himself and he reveals himself to the
[43:40] believer he says when he came to job God
[43:44] now I I wonder if you could just see
[43:47] this it's the unveiling of God but yet
[43:50] the prophet continue to talk about how
[43:52] God is veiling
[43:55] himself it's the veiling of God but yet
[43:59] he continues he says when he came to job
[44:02] he was in the form of the
[44:04] worldwind God was in the Whirlwind when
[44:06] he came and when he came he says Moses
[44:08] wanted to see him he says that God hi
[44:12] and Moses saw the back part of of a man
[44:15] and brother makes it clear he says he
[44:17] did not see God he saw the veil of
[44:22] God he did not see God but he saw the
[44:25] veil of God and I just want to encourage
[44:28] us tonight the world may go by the
[44:30] wayside as we see it but all of that is
[44:33] part of God's big drama all of Doubt
[44:36] there could be some nail biting moment
[44:38] where you think I'm about to lose this I
[44:40] don't understand this pressure comes up
[44:42] and down and all those things but in all
[44:44] of that God is bringing up his word to
[44:47] come to
[44:51] pass what ROM
[44:53] says he
[44:55] says now
[44:58] he
[44:59] says Dr
[45:01] scoffield he says we find that in his
[45:03] word in it says the word changing form
[45:07] we find out that in morphe in Greek
[45:10] which means the Unseen was made visible
[45:14] something something that cannot we know
[45:17] we know that we we know it's there it
[45:20] cannot be seen but yet we know it's
[45:23] there and when it changes its form and
[45:27] it Mor which means to change it changes
[45:31] form from the supernatural to the
[45:33] Natural and it changed his mask in
[45:38] otherwise it's like a drama he was
[45:41] acting and in the Greek when you when
[45:44] when when they when they would when they
[45:47] would change his M his mask they may
[45:50] have one play One play might might have
[45:53] act in several different play
[45:57] he says now if you are if you would not
[46:00] if you would take the Old Testament
[46:02] prophecy concerning what the Messiah was
[46:05] and you would compare it to the life of
[46:07] Jesus you've got exactly who Jesus was
[46:11] he was just not an orinary man he was
[46:13] God in morphe he was he was changed from
[46:17] the supernatural into the natural and
[46:20] yet he was God manifested In the Flesh
[46:23] veil in human fleshly Veil and then it
[46:26] says and and and and and and you watch
[46:30] the Old Testament like it speak in I'm
[46:33] speaking of a mixup audience from a
[46:35] different part of the world we are here
[46:37] to find out what are we going uh what
[46:41] are we doing where are we and what's
[46:44] getting where are we getting to what's
[46:46] happening what does all of this
[46:49] mean that's the question we have what
[46:52] what are we doing what's happening
[46:54] what's happening all over you find out
[46:57] it's part of what God is trying to
[46:59] achieve in this generation he said that
[47:02] when God all that God was he poured into
[47:04] Christ he says it's not an empty out of
[47:08] himself that God took something that was
[47:10] in him and he emptied out no he changed
[47:14] the form from what it was into something
[47:17] different and in this end time it was
[47:20] promised that when we see what we see
[47:22] out there that in that time God will
[47:25] take what he is he will take what he was
[47:28] or what he was in Christ and he will
[47:30] pour it into his church and God will
[47:33] become his own Sons and
[47:36] Daughters
[47:38] amen it's not us trying to please God oh
[47:42] God I want no it's the part that God was
[47:45] in your flesh that God came and used
[47:48] your flesh for the purpose of
[47:51] manifesting something that he couldn't
[47:53] do when he was in the body of Jesus that
[47:55] he wants to do in your flesh he wants to
[47:58] go talk to your neighbor he wants to go
[48:00] and talk to your coworker he wants to go
[48:03] and talk to your family and he knows we
[48:05] within the Flesh of Jesus he cannot
[48:08] who's who's this MDC he was the same God
[48:12] but when he came to Abraham he couldn't
[48:14] come in the body of Jesus because the
[48:16] body was not
[48:18] there God made a body so he can come and
[48:21] do a work and go by but it was the same
[48:23] one says when he was in Christ he was
[48:26] the same God God he didn't change we
[48:29] don't sit here as well you know I I I
[48:32] somehow have a desire that I can become
[48:36] or please God if the scripture tells us
[48:39] that either you were with him if you
[48:41] have the Holy Spirit or if you have
[48:43] eternal life you are with him in the
[48:44] beginning so as of part of this
[48:47] unfolding of his drama he's making his
[48:50] word come to pass amen I tell you
[48:52] Brothers and Sisters Let's Embrace God's
[48:55] drama he's doing it for a purpose that
[48:58] we don't understand he's doing it for
[49:01] reasons that sometimes we fail but one
[49:03] thing that we can know for sure that as
[49:05] we look in his word he's revealing his
[49:07] word one by one he's making it known to
[49:10] us he's making it known to us why he's
[49:13] the writer of the drama and he's the one
[49:16] playing the
[49:18] characters but when I'm talks about that
[49:22] violin he said it was just looked like
[49:25] nothing and is as some insignificant
[49:29] amount and nobody will take it but he
[49:32] said when the master came and he took of
[49:33] that violin and he began to play it he
[49:37] said it brought out the value of that
[49:40] what that was and God is the one
[49:43] bringing the value out out of you and I
[49:47] let's embrace the drama let's it could
[49:50] be some nail biting moment I was
[49:52] thinking about it I begin to think think
[49:54] about just going to uh with Moses but
[49:58] what says that God the scripture tells
[50:01] us that God hardened the heart of
[50:03] pharaoh he sent Moses but yet he
[50:06] hardened the heart of pharaoh what use
[50:08] is that you sent me to go tell him to
[50:11] let your people go but yet that same
[50:13] person you harden his
[50:17] heart he came back and he came back and
[50:21] and when time was come that same God
[50:24] came and he tell him he said him you go
[50:26] and you apply the blood this is going to
[50:28] be the final plag and after this has
[50:30] happened they'll let you go I want you
[50:33] he came and he did all of that that came
[50:35] and I want you I want you to remember
[50:36] standing before the Red
[50:38] Sea you talk about nail biting moment
[50:42] yeah is the army of pharaoh just coming
[50:44] and ready just getting ready to slay
[50:46] them just getting ready it says we got
[50:49] them in sight we're going to get them
[50:51] and yet they are standing and there's a
[50:53] red sea and they begin to murmur oh God
[50:56] you let let us tired why did you not
[50:58] leave us in there and they say all kind
[51:00] of things God performing his drama God
[51:04] letting his drama play out I tell you it
[51:07] was not a second late he opened the Red
[51:10] Sea and they walked by and they began to
[51:12] walk they didn't run they began to walk
[51:15] and God was taking care of
[51:17] it I thought about the Hebrew children
[51:20] you talk about drama yeah they are and
[51:23] they prayed and perhaps you would think
[51:25] that God will get them out at the last
[51:27] second no he didn't he let them
[51:30] go he let them just just about to walk
[51:33] in in fact they came and the people that
[51:36] were holding them died you talk about
[51:39] nail biting
[51:41] moment that's the truth but that's all
[51:44] part of God's trama you know your life
[51:46] you could be sick or you could be going
[51:48] through some things and you said I think
[51:50] I can't take another breath and I think
[51:53] this is just the end of me and that's
[51:55] all I think I can can't take it anymore
[51:57] that's part of God
[51:59] drama for what glory is it going to be
[52:02] if it's just an easy thing God wants to
[52:05] dramatize it he wants to bring the glory
[52:08] out of it he wants just to bring it and
[52:10] make it big so that when you go through
[52:13] you can say he's a mighty
[52:15] God he not just the might God is a
[52:18] mighty God he's the creator of Heaven
[52:21] and Earth he wrote that play he knew
[52:23] what character you would play and he
[52:25] knew exactly what role you're going to
[52:27] be
[52:29] fulfilling let's all stand
[52:31] tonight if we could just rejoice in
[52:34] God's play say God I know it's hard I
[52:37] don't understand this the world is gr by
[52:40] the word side and it's just sometime so
[52:43] a place that I just can't grasp it but
[52:45] Lord one thing I know is you have it in
[52:48] control it's part of your great drama
[52:51] that you are playing you're playing your
[52:53] drama you're inviting your sons and
[52:55] daughters I tell you those kids those
[52:57] Hebrew children when they get out every
[53:00] man looked at them and they knew they
[53:01] had a God who was real no one questioned
[53:05] them anymore about their God and I tell
[53:08] you my brother my sister your life
[53:10] testifies of that
[53:12] God that's what we identify with that's
[53:16] the thing that we know that's the thing
[53:18] you think about science I want you to
[53:20] put on one side the achievement of
[53:22] science I want you to put the
[53:23] achievement of faith on the other side
[53:26] tell you the achievement of science
[53:28] there's not too many the best they can
[53:30] do what an astronaut that's the best
[53:32] they can do it goes up and come down but
[53:35] what I'm says they couldn't even create
[53:37] a blade of grass a blade of grass all of
[53:40] that knowledge couldn't even amount to
[53:42] creating a blade of
[53:44] grass but all this Mighty God is here
[53:48] doing wonderful things I tell you how
[53:50] are you going to go in the Rapture he
[53:52] has to take you through some drama some
[53:55] nail biting moment some place where you
[53:58] think I don't know how this is going to
[53:59] play out but what he's the Mighty God
[54:03] unveil before us and where is it today
[54:06] is in your flesh why because that's
[54:09] theam says it speaks about the woman as
[54:12] well he says that she noticed that he
[54:14] metant the scripture
[54:17] qualification you take what that was and
[54:20] it says and what he did he says you come
[54:23] up with the Messiah
[54:26] you take the promised word of this hour
[54:29] and you put it together with the
[54:30] experience that we have seen you come up
[54:33] with a bride it's not just words there
[54:36] has to be something that shows that God
[54:39] has com and he manifest himself amen

[55:04] scientific age
[55:06] within non- scientifical message
[55:10] something that they would just look at
[55:11] and just laugh
[55:14] at but Lord that was just part of your
[55:17] drama that you were doing we ask today
[55:19] that you lead us you guide us in all
[55:21] truth and
[55:23] righteousness father we may get nervous
