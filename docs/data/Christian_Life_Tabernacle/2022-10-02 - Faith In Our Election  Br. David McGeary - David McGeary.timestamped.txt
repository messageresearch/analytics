[5:02] to cover us when we don't have

[5:09] cover us with all that we go through it
[5:11] is covering that we need amen want to
[5:14] welcome everyone in the hearts of God
[5:15] this morning all our visitors God bless
[5:18] you man you may turn around and shake
[5:20] the hand of someone who divide by the
[5:21] mic for a Psalm reading and opening
[5:23] prayer God bless you
[5:29] thank you
[5:44] good morning
[5:47] we'll go ahead and turn to Psalm 119
[5:49] this morning
[5:51] this is it
[5:54] final section
[5:57] and what you would have enjoyed going
[5:59] through this section it's uh
[6:01] you know what a great chapter to read
[6:04] and to uh I think experts say it takes
[6:07] about 15 minutes to read it all by
[6:08] yourself just in one sitting I don't
[6:11] know how anybody can do that because
[6:12] it's so rich
[6:13] you just can sit and just chew over
[6:15] sections of it you know for days but I
[6:18] know I've enjoyed going through it I
[6:20] hope you have too
[6:22] you know I think the thing that you take
[6:24] away from Psalm 119 as we read through
[6:26] it it's all about a relationship with
[6:28] the word
[6:29] that's what it's all about you know
[6:31] church services are wonderful Fellowship
[6:34] is wonderful spending time in the
[6:36] reading the scriptures is wonderful but
[6:38] without without that relationship that
[6:41] personal relationship all that other
[6:43] stuff is just religion just the works of
[6:46] men
[6:47] you know Jesus said in John 17 verse 3
[6:51] it was kind of his last prayer he said
[6:54] in this is life eternal
[6:57] that they might Know Thee
[7:00] the only true God
[7:02] and Jesus Christ whom thou Hast sent who
[7:06] is the word
[7:07] amen and then in first John 5 20
[7:10] the disciple whom he loved
[7:13] said and we know that the son of God
[7:16] the word
[7:17] is come
[7:19] and hath given us understanding
[7:22] that we may know him that is true
[7:25] and we are in him that is true
[7:30] even in his son Jesus Christ
[7:33] who is the word
[7:35] this is the true God and eternal life
[7:41] you know as we turned that last section
[7:42] of Psalm 119 and pick up in verse 169
[7:45] you know what it caught my attention is
[7:47] there's back to back verses there
[7:50] that talk about
[7:51] using my mouth to speak forth something
[7:56] to make a noise to make a sound to make
[7:58] a voice
[8:01] it says in verse 169 Let My Cry come
[8:05] near before thee O Lord
[8:08] in verse 170 it said let my supplication
[8:12] come before thee
[8:14] in verse 171 it says my lips shall utter
[8:18] praise
[8:19] and then in verse 172 my tongue shall
[8:23] speak
[8:24] My Cry
[8:26] my supplication
[8:28] my lips
[8:30] my tongue
[8:32] you know we often speak about having
[8:34] eyes to see
[8:35] and ears to hear
[8:38] you know we all
[8:40] I think appreciate the value of having
[8:42] our ears open that we may hear him
[8:46] our eyes opened that we may see him
[8:51] but you know the thing about a
[8:52] relationship is it's two-way
[8:55] foreign
[8:56] you know remember the chapter is all
[8:58] about having a relationship with the
[9:00] word
[9:01] you know and if all we do is sit there
[9:04] and watch
[9:05] and see
[9:07] and hear and listen
[9:10] it's still not much of a relationship
[9:16] you know there's a two-way dialogue
[9:19] required
[9:20] the question is is what do we bring
[9:23] to the relationship
[9:26] after all the hearing and all the seeing
[9:29] what is it that he expects us
[9:32] to bring to the relationship
[9:36] you know there's a section of Revelation
[9:38] that we're all familiar with it's in
[9:40] Revelation chapter 10.
[9:43] when John takes that little book
[9:46] and he eats it
[9:48] and I hope we see ourselves in the
[9:50] scripture you know that there's been a
[9:53] word made available to us that if we
[9:55] take and we eat that and it becomes part
[9:57] of ourselves but there's a scripture at
[9:58] the end
[9:59] in verse 11. where he was instructed to
[10:03] speak amen
[10:04] amen you must prophesy again
[10:07] so after all the seeing and all the
[10:10] hearing and even all the eating
[10:12] there's a speaking
[10:14] that is part of the relationship
[10:18] you know there has to be a voice a sound
[10:22] a response from us
[10:25] in this relationship
[10:27] in verse 169 it says Let My Cry come
[10:31] near before thee O Lord
[10:33] and I don't suppose there's anyone in
[10:35] this room that hasn't ever had a time in
[10:37] their life where they cried out to the
[10:39] Lord
[10:40] you know crying out to him to come on
[10:43] the scene for us or to meet our need
[10:46] you know and there's whole books in
[10:48] Christian bookstores to help people
[10:49] manage the process of crying out to the
[10:52] Lord and maybe not hearing from him
[10:54] you know is it I'm not worthy
[10:57] is it because I haven't cried out enough
[11:00] you know the question is is it the right
[11:02] kind of sound that he's looking for
[11:06] you know what kind of cry does he
[11:09] respond to
[11:11] it says in verse 169 give me
[11:14] understanding according to Thy Word
[11:17] there is no promise that he's going to
[11:19] respond to every time you cry
[11:23] but he will respond to his word
[11:28] when I cry unto the Lord does he hear my
[11:31] desire
[11:32] or does he hear his word
[11:36] in fact brother Branham preached a whole
[11:38] sermon about that
[11:39] why cry speak
[11:43] remember the story of the children of
[11:44] Israel trapped against the sea and
[11:47] Moses stood there in a desperate hour
[11:49] and everyone was crying out to the Lord
[11:50] and his ask what his challenge was why
[11:53] do you cry to me speak he had already
[11:56] spoken he said I'm going to lead you to
[11:59] the promised land
[12:00] so what was he crying out for save me
[12:02] he'd already said what he was going to
[12:05] do
[12:06] it was the same with the disciples when
[12:08] they were stuck on that stormy sea and
[12:10] they saw that storm come up and they
[12:12] were panicking and they cried out Lord
[12:14] save us lest we be destroyed by the
[12:16] storm but he'd already told them we're
[12:17] going to the other side
[12:19] see it's why cry what what sound do you
[12:23] produce when you cry are you crying out
[12:26] and speaking his word
[12:28] right
[12:30] verse 170 let my supplication come
[12:32] before thee my supplication my prayer
[12:36] my request
[12:38] you know once again what's my part
[12:41] what's my voice what sound is being
[12:44] produced from me is it the number of
[12:46] times I pray how many hours I spend on
[12:49] my knees how loud I pray
[12:53] or is it simply as verse 170 says
[12:56] deliver me
[12:58] according to Thy Word
[13:02] see he's looking for a certain sound
[13:05] to come out of us as part of this
[13:07] relationship
[13:09] in verse 171 my lips shall utter praise
[13:13] is it because of the music
[13:15] is it because of the loud preaching
[13:18] is it because of the excitement of the
[13:21] room
[13:22] you know if he's looking for volume
[13:25] if he's looking for music then he's at
[13:27] the Ballpark this morning
[13:29] where he's in the Rock concert down the
[13:31] street
[13:32] what is he looking for what's the sound
[13:34] he's looking for
[13:36] it says in verse 171 let my lips shall
[13:39] utter praise when thou has taught me thy
[13:44] statutes Thy Word
[13:47] we praise in response to the word
[13:50] no music required
[13:53] no no loud preaching required if you've
[13:56] ever came to that place where you heard
[13:58] thus saith the Lord for you you have a
[14:02] basis of praise
[14:03] no music required
[14:06] you know in the last one I think sums it
[14:08] up really well
[14:10] verse 172 my tongue shall speak Thy Word
[14:17] you know the sound that he's looking for
[14:22] you know in a relationship it's a
[14:24] conversation
[14:26] you know we want to hear from him
[14:28] and that's our expectation this morning
[14:31] but you know he wants to hear from us
[14:35] he speaks to us by his word
[14:38] he wants to hear from us by his word
[14:42] word fellowshipping with word
[14:46] speaking word and word responding with
[14:49] word
[14:52] you know may My Cry
[14:54] my supplication
[14:56] my lips
[14:58] my tongue be an outlet for his word
[15:02] is that your prayer this morning
[15:04] it certainly is mine because there's
[15:06] really no other sound that he's looking
[15:08] for as it says in Psalm 19 let the words
[15:11] of my mouth
[15:12] and the meditation of my heart be
[15:15] acceptable in thy sight
[15:17] O Lord
[15:19] let's read that last section of Psalm
[15:21] 119 together those last eight verses
[15:23] starting in verse
[15:26] 169.
[15:27] it says Let My Cry come near before thee
[15:30] O Lord give me understanding according
[15:33] to Thy word let my supplication come
[15:36] before thee deliver me according to Thy
[15:39] word my lips shall utter praise when
[15:42] thou has taught me thy statutes my
[15:45] tongue shall speak of Thy word for all
[15:47] thy Commandments are righteousness let
[15:50] thine hand help me for I have chosen thy
[15:53] precepts I have longed for thy salvation
[15:55] O Lord and thy law is my delight let my
[15:59] soul live and it shall praise thee and
[16:02] let thy judgments help me I have gone
[16:04] astray like a lost sheep seek thy
[16:07] servant for I do not forget thy
[16:09] Commandments amen
[16:13] amen God bless you may have your seeds

[32:05] heart and to know your will Lord we ask
[32:08] that Lord our sisters Lord our sister

[32:39] nothing in this world that can make
[32:40] sense of a loss like that but father
[32:43] Lord I pray that the Great I Am would

[39:52] you promised that you would Supply our
[39:54] every need
[39:57] and you know what we have need of that's
[39:59] wonderful
[40:01] we just asked this morning that we could
[40:03] be lifted up in your word
[40:06] father our hearts would be encouraged
[40:08] and
[40:09] we'd be
[40:11] blessed today
[40:13] we'd walk out of here with hope
[40:16] we'd walk from this place with strength
[40:20] we'd be encouraged and
[40:24] and we would know that your love's
[40:27] forgiven us of our trespasses
[40:31] and that you'll never forsake us
[40:33] [Music]
[40:35] Lord draw Us close as our brother
[40:39] exhorted Us in this Psalm that it's a
[40:43] relationship it's a two-part
[40:45] father and you've never failed on your
[40:48] side
[40:49] Lord we ask that our part can grow
[40:53] we just ask your grace this morning in
[40:56] Jesus precious name we pray amen and
[41:00] amen God bless you may be seated this
[41:02] morning
[41:07] certainly nice to be in the house of the
[41:09] Lord
[41:11] today and to fill a ship around his word
[41:14] do you know Leslie's out in uh
[41:18] San Diego watching over my mom while my
[41:22] sisters away and I appreciate that but I
[41:25] found out a lot of things that you need
[41:29] to find out before you let your wife
[41:31] leave and one is how do you start the
[41:34] dish uh the dishwasher well I can wash
[41:37] dishes by hand but how do you start the
[41:40] washing machine
[41:42] and now so I I pressed a few buttons and
[41:47] I just threw the clothes in there I
[41:49] don't know what it did but now I can't
[41:52] get the door open so I don't know I
[41:55] guess they can sit in there till
[41:56] Thursday right
[41:58] well maybe one of my daughters-in-laws
[42:01] will come and and Rescue Me
[42:04] but uh
[42:05] but anyway I all the little things seem
[42:10] to pop up that she's been uh I noticed
[42:14] all the clothes laying all over the room
[42:17] for the first time I don't know I I
[42:21] guess she's been picking them up all
[42:23] this time but uh
[42:25] so you know I can tell she's missing I
[42:29] can tell when the Lord's missing in my
[42:31] life too
[42:33] amen so we certainly uh trust him I I
[42:38] certainly uh
[42:40] uh am so thankful for all the wonderful
[42:44] support that you gave Brother John
[42:46] and those that you came out for the
[42:48] funeral yesterday and we have some
[42:51] beautiful flower arrangements that
[42:53] sister uh Julia made for the uh
[42:59] uh funeral and they they had to leave
[43:02] them here with us and so um
[43:05] I guess maybe after evening service if
[43:09] some of you sisters want to pull a few
[43:11] of them and you can go ahead and and do
[43:14] that after you're after you get what you
[43:17] want no
[43:18] it's okay so but anyway I want to thank
[43:22] you for your patience during
[43:23] construction
[43:25] and we you notice we're making progress
[43:28] and and I know you have to park in the
[43:30] dirt and walk in the dirt and we're
[43:33] going to try to pour some parking lot
[43:35] here in the next couple weeks
[43:37] but I know it's hardest on our young
[43:40] mothers because we don't have any place
[43:42] for your children to play and run and
[43:45] and we'll we'll see if we can come up
[43:48] with some ways maybe to make a
[43:50] playground area or something we're just
[43:53] going to start praying about that but in
[43:56] the meantime it's
[43:58] very difficult because we just don't
[44:01] have the facilities
[44:02] and it's not your fault it's it's just
[44:06] that's the way things are if we can
[44:08] fight through it and be good but we're
[44:12] still trying to
[44:14] keep an atmosphere
[44:17] in the church house and respect for the
[44:20] church house so I know we we don't have
[44:23] a place for you to
[44:26] feed your children and give them snacks
[44:30] and places but so we'll we'll
[44:35] express our guidelines and then you do
[44:39] your best
[44:40] in the circumstance that you're in to
[44:45] try to
[44:46] maintain the best we can so I'm not
[44:50] trying to make it law and but or
[44:53] anything but just things so uh we don't
[44:58] have enough seating in the sanctuary as
[45:00] you know so we have a large section of
[45:05] overflow we call it overflow but really
[45:08] it's an extension of the sanctuary
[45:12] so when it when Services ended we're
[45:17] still trying to keep a reverent
[45:19] atmosphere in both places
[45:22] the trouble is the Fourier is stuck
[45:24] right in the middle of the sanctuary
[45:28] if you can understand that so that
[45:30] Sanctuary back there and this is
[45:33] sanctuary and the four you're in the
[45:35] restrooms and the nursery is stuck right
[45:38] in the middle
[45:39] so we've got to do our best
[45:42] in the foyer now to try to keep our
[45:46] conversations down
[45:48] if you can move your conversation
[45:50] outside that's better
[45:54] um if you have to talk in the four-year
[45:56] try to keep it down and then so the
[45:59] people that are praying in the back and
[46:01] praying in here can finish their worship
[46:05] and and then go on so I know what's
[46:08] going to be difficult and hard to do do
[46:11] your best to keep that in mind
[46:14] you know what I mean do your best and um
[46:18] you know I give charge to the deacons
[46:21] you know keep it reverent keep it quiet
[46:23] and they do their best to enforce it and
[46:26] of course they take all the grief as
[46:29] that's why I have to have seven deacons
[46:31] because uh
[46:34] all the grief that they've got to take
[46:36] for me but uh
[46:40] we'll uh we'll do our best okay and then
[46:43] I know we don't have a place to feed
[46:45] your children
[46:47] and and the nurseries crowded the
[46:51] nursery is not in is also an extension
[46:54] of everything so let's do our best to be
[46:57] mindful to keep everything quiet and
[47:00] reverent the best we can and uh
[47:04] you know be be careful about
[47:08] um
[47:09] you know what the prophet has said about
[47:11] children running and and things so I
[47:14] know it we don't have a place for them
[47:16] to run we don't have a place for him to
[47:18] go I know it's difficult so I know that
[47:21] this whole process
[47:23] is the most difficult on your young
[47:25] mothers
[47:27] and our hearts are with you do your best
[47:32] others
[47:34] if you the elderly sisters I'd like to
[47:38] say that you know but those of you who
[47:41] are spiritual Elders not age-wise help
[47:45] the younger that's scriptural and and
[47:48] we'll just we'll try to get through this
[47:50] the best we can amen so anyway uh just
[47:56] all those little things but uh but now
[48:00] we'll have my favorite part of being a
[48:02] pastor and that's a baby dedication
[48:06] amen I I I don't mind babies crying
[48:11] because that crime is good it's the
[48:15] crying they do when they get after they
[48:17] get
[48:18] older that's when the it gets hard but
[48:22] right now we're gonna dedicate Everett
[48:26] Matthew Armin
[48:28] and if Josh and Jessica would come and I
[48:32] wonder if Tim and Melinda would join us

[54:30] we pray amen amen God bless you God
[54:36] bless you
[54:38] it is
[54:42] great grandma what do you think of that
[54:45] huh that's something in it God bless you
[54:50] amen
[54:54] that's the best part of being a pastor
[54:56] right there you love the Lord this
[54:59] morning
[55:00] amen amen we're just going to have a
[55:03] time of Fellowship in his word this
[55:06] morning you love his word let's stand
[55:08] together and read one Short scripture
[55:11] and then we're going to go through some
[55:13] scriptures uh listen to our messenger
[55:16] and and just have a time this morning uh
[55:20] trying to build
[55:22] our faith so let's go to one of the
[55:25] great scriptures that uh we have we're
[55:29] going to read two little scriptures out
[55:31] of Hebrews the 11th chapter
[55:35] and and we're gonna just trust that the
[55:37] the that this morning that in the
[55:41] Simplicity of God's word that you'll
[55:45] take strength and faith
[55:48] and that you can see this morning what a
[55:53] wonderful way that God has made for you
[55:57] he he's he's done it so perfectly that
[56:01] you can't mess it up
[56:05] amen so let's read in Hebrews as Hebrews
[56:08] the 11th uh chapter it says now Faith is
[56:11] the substance of things hoped for the
[56:14] evidence of Things Not Seen
[56:19] amen so we know that faith is something
[56:21] real
[56:22] and then we come to the sixth verse of
[56:26] the same chapter but without faith it is
[56:29] impossible to please him
[56:31] for he that cometh to God must believe
[56:34] that he is
[56:36] and that he is a rewarder
[56:39] of them that diligently seek Him
[56:42] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[56:46] word to us in Jesus precious and holy
[56:49] name we pray amen amen you may be seated
[56:57] uh I I usually like to play uh
[57:03] the portion of message that we want to
[57:08] speak on uh first but I think I'm going
[57:13] to wait and play it at the end so that
[57:17] as you hear the uh our messenger
[57:22] speak to us that you can reach out and
[57:25] grab hold of it and uh so I'd like to
[57:30] talk this morning if we could if I was
[57:34] to have a sermon title and it would be
[57:38] called faith in our election
[57:43] faith in our election
[57:46] and we want to
[57:50] talk about
[57:52] our election this morning and I'd like
[57:56] to do this by if you wouldn't mind
[57:59] turning with me
[58:01] into the gospel of Saint John and the
[58:07] 15th chapter of the Gospel of Saint John
[58:11] and I'd like to read these scriptures
[58:15] and go through these scriptures together
[58:18] with us this morning
[58:21] now your election is the greatest
[58:24] possession that you have
[58:28] if I could uh
[58:33] re-quote or re-word by no means I have
[58:38] the authority or the ability to do it
[58:40] but just this shed light Jesus says when
[58:44] a man finds a pearl of great price I
[58:49] would like to insert the word election
[58:51] when a man finds his election he sells
[58:56] all that he has
[58:57] uh when he finds his election a treasure
[59:02] buried in the field the greatest
[59:05] possession that you have
[59:09] is your election
[59:11] it's it's it it's it means more to us
[59:15] than anything that that we could realize
[59:20] and and we want to talk about that today
[59:25] about election what it means to you and
[59:30] the great things and so I'd like to
[59:34] start in the 15th chapter of this Gospel
[59:37] of John and start reading the this
[59:41] scripture and and we'll read down a few
[59:45] verses but you've got to understand now
[59:48] this is Jesus talking
[59:51] to his elect
[59:52] he makes references to things that are
[59:56] there as we read this you'll see but now
[59:59] he's this is a special a special message
[1:00:04] to his elect and when Jesus spoke here
[1:00:08] he knew that he wasn't just speaking to
[1:00:11] those that was in front of him he knew
[1:00:14] he was speaking
[1:00:16] to you
[1:00:18] we know we were on his mind we know that
[1:00:21] we were on his heart he knew he knew
[1:00:24] whom he was going to Calvary for and so
[1:00:28] as we expound on this this morning we
[1:00:31] just uh we we want to do it as a family
[1:00:34] as as a body no big eyes no little ears
[1:00:41] uh just the the grace of God uh uh on
[1:00:47] our behalf speaking to our hearts so
[1:00:50] let's start and read he says
[1:00:53] I am the True Vine
[1:00:57] amen which would tell us that there's
[1:01:00] false fines
[1:01:02] there's other places for you to draw
[1:01:05] strength and life from
[1:01:09] but he says I'm the True Vine I'm the
[1:01:12] true place
[1:01:13] I'm the True Vine so that we don't we we
[1:01:16] don't want to be drawing a life from
[1:01:18] something that's not true he says and so
[1:01:22] he says and my father is the husband
[1:01:28] so he's the one that's orchestrating it
[1:01:31] right he's the one that's looking over
[1:01:33] it he's the one that's in charge of it
[1:01:36] every branch in me
[1:01:39] that beareth not fruit he taketh away
[1:01:43] and every branch
[1:01:45] that beareth fruit
[1:01:47] he purged it that it may bring forth
[1:01:51] more fruit
[1:01:53] so we're not weary and well doing we're
[1:01:58] not discouraged when we're chastised all
[1:02:01] that he loves he chastises and he
[1:02:05] corrects but there's got to be one thing
[1:02:08] that's sure
[1:02:11] you understand because you can't be
[1:02:14] corrected
[1:02:16] and uh and Fall to Pieces
[1:02:21] now I spanked my children I may have
[1:02:24] spanked them too hard I I didn't know
[1:02:26] how to raise children that's why I'm
[1:02:29] glad to be a grandpa because now I know
[1:02:32] how to raise children
[1:02:34] give them whatever they want and you're
[1:02:37] happy
[1:02:38] God don't have grandchildren
[1:02:42] okay he has children
[1:02:44] so if you're not if you don't have faith
[1:02:48] in your election
[1:02:50] every time that your Chast dies or
[1:02:55] rebuke you can't go back and and and say
[1:02:59] you know I don't every time my kids I
[1:03:01] spank my kids they didn't run up to me
[1:03:04] and say am I your child
[1:03:07] you sure I belong in this house you know
[1:03:10] what I mean now they may have thought it
[1:03:12] but I don't know but you can't go to
[1:03:15] Pieces every time because he tells you I
[1:03:19] can Purge you that you might be more
[1:03:22] fruitful hey he might take something
[1:03:24] from you that you really enjoy doing
[1:03:28] it doesn't mean that sin
[1:03:31] but he wants to make you more fruitful
[1:03:35] he wants you to he he
[1:03:38] we he's a god of fruit
[1:03:43] that's what he wants so he'll do
[1:03:45] whatever is best the father will to make
[1:03:49] you more abundant and more fruitful and
[1:03:52] because he rewards according to those
[1:03:54] things so he's a great God he says and
[1:03:59] every he says
[1:04:01] that that it may bring forth more fruit
[1:04:04] now ye are clean through the word which
[1:04:09] I have spoken unto you
[1:04:12] oh that's a long sermon
[1:04:15] you're clean through the word you didn't
[1:04:19] make yourself clean
[1:04:21] you couldn't have thought of the things
[1:04:25] that he taught
[1:04:27] you couldn't have come up with it it's
[1:04:29] not in your nature to turn the other
[1:04:31] cheek
[1:04:33] you wouldn't want The Gospel According
[1:04:36] to David McGarry
[1:04:37] if someone Smite you on the cheek go get
[1:04:40] a bigger hammer
[1:04:44] I mean that would it would be chaos
[1:04:47] you know what I mean it would be every
[1:04:50] every uh every man for himself you know
[1:04:54] what I mean uh my gospel would be do
[1:04:58] unto others before they do unto you
[1:05:01] you know that what kind of chaos but you
[1:05:03] couldn't even come up with the things
[1:05:05] that he said but he said you are clean
[1:05:08] through the word which I preached to you
[1:05:12] he said this is the secret the Secret's
[1:05:15] my word
[1:05:18] my secret the secret to life the secret
[1:05:22] to success the secret to everything is
[1:05:25] the word that I've taught you that's
[1:05:28] what cleanses you cling to that word
[1:05:31] read your Bibles to uh fellowship with
[1:05:35] his brother Mike said have communion
[1:05:37] with them that it's beautiful wait wait
[1:05:42] on his spirit
[1:05:45] you know his spirits is this real spirit
[1:05:47] it's a real presence it's something that
[1:05:51] you can sense you you can know when he's
[1:05:53] there
[1:05:54] you can know when he comes by you can
[1:05:58] you you can know that when you take your
[1:06:00] scriptures don't just read it
[1:06:02] intellectually read the scripture then
[1:06:04] wait on the Lord wait on the spirit of
[1:06:06] the Lord wait till it comes down it's a
[1:06:08] good idea before you make decisions
[1:06:10] before you talk to people before you
[1:06:13] enter into interviews before you go to
[1:06:16] school take a moment sit still wait for
[1:06:19] that peace to come wait for the presence
[1:06:21] to come wait for that anointing to come
[1:06:26] say oh because why his word he says he
[1:06:32] says ye are clean
[1:06:35] through the word which I have spoken
[1:06:37] unto you abide in me
[1:06:41] and I in you
[1:06:43] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:06:47] itself hold that there when we get to
[1:06:50] this a little bit later you can't do it
[1:06:54] yourself
[1:06:56] there's something that's going to do it
[1:06:59] for you
[1:07:03] oh I want to jump right ahead you know
[1:07:06] it's hard for me I don't I don't like
[1:07:09] building the things I like just saying
[1:07:11] like it is right now but look we want to
[1:07:13] lay it in the word this morning okay you
[1:07:16] can't do it in yourself
[1:07:18] so there's got to be some Source
[1:07:21] someplace that's going to bring you to
[1:07:25] what you want to be
[1:07:28] that's our battle
[1:07:31] we want to be one thing but we realize
[1:07:34] we're something else and it's what that
[1:07:37] we're not has more effect on us than
[1:07:41] what we should than what our hearts
[1:07:44] desire should be
[1:07:46] so we don't want to base our faith in
[1:07:50] the present reality of our weakness
[1:07:54] we want to build our faith in the
[1:07:57] promises of God's word and the word that
[1:08:01] cleans us and made us clean
[1:08:06] think of that now
[1:08:08] what is going what is the most
[1:08:11] solid thing what he said is going to be
[1:08:15] or what is
[1:08:18] because faith
[1:08:20] is the substance
[1:08:24] of things what hope for
[1:08:27] but not yet seen in other words I don't
[1:08:30] see a good Christian I don't see it but
[1:08:33] the word of God said that I'm going to
[1:08:36] be a good Christian
[1:08:39] now what am I going to put my faith in
[1:08:42] what I see
[1:08:44] or what I hope for
[1:08:50] you I'm going to put it in what I hope
[1:08:52] for
[1:08:54] what I want to be
[1:08:58] so we as we read it says
[1:09:03] and we keep going abide in me and I in
[1:09:06] you the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:09:08] itself except it abide in the Vine no
[1:09:13] more can ye accept ye abide in me
[1:09:17] now we want to really come down this
[1:09:20] morning to what does that mean
[1:09:24] when you abide in him what are you
[1:09:27] abiding in
[1:09:29] abiding what are you holding on to what
[1:09:32] is your resting place because Faith
[1:09:35] final resting place is what the word so
[1:09:38] if your faith abides it abides in the
[1:09:42] word it not abide in your feelings it
[1:09:45] doesn't abide the in in the voices
[1:09:48] around you it doesn't abide in what
[1:09:51] seems to be evident and pure fact
[1:09:56] even fact that can be proven
[1:09:59] but God don't deal with fact
[1:10:03] why because he's a creator
[1:10:10] when that nurses
[1:10:12] begin to
[1:10:14] not uh in any way
[1:10:18] uh evil but just the prophets God said
[1:10:21] because of her training when that person
[1:10:24] had such low blood pressure and they
[1:10:26] were so sick and there was just no
[1:10:28] medical evidence at all that they could
[1:10:31] come up and the prophet of God Walks In
[1:10:33] by vision
[1:10:36] well what's a vision why does it have to
[1:10:38] be a vision because it's got to be
[1:10:41] someplace that nobody else can see
[1:10:46] nurse he can see where you couldn't see
[1:10:50] he could know what you couldn't know you
[1:10:53] couldn't know it by the senses you
[1:10:55] couldn't know by reasoning the inner
[1:10:56] conscious beings he knew it because he
[1:11:00] saw it and what God showed him was what
[1:11:03] was real
[1:11:07] so he comes back
[1:11:09] and he says walks in the room he says
[1:11:11] you'll live the nurse says don't tell
[1:11:14] them that
[1:11:17] there's never been a case there's never
[1:11:19] been this it's over
[1:11:22] and the prophet of God prays for this
[1:11:24] little person and and the parents go to
[1:11:27] rejoicing
[1:11:30] and she said why are you giving these
[1:11:32] people false hope
[1:11:35] you know isn't it funny
[1:11:37] some people just they they just try to
[1:11:39] Rob your faith
[1:11:41] you're looking at certain death
[1:11:44] and they the only hope that you have is
[1:11:48] faith
[1:11:50] and they'll take that away from you
[1:11:54] you just wish you'd switch places
[1:11:57] you could just go and take them and put
[1:11:59] them there on the death bed
[1:12:03] now do you want to have some hope
[1:12:06] There's Hope in God's word
[1:12:11] and and so they got up and rejoiced and
[1:12:15] they ran over there and and the man said
[1:12:18] there's just a nurse we understand
[1:12:20] you're looking at the charts you're
[1:12:24] looking at the instruments you're
[1:12:26] looking at the medical evidence you're
[1:12:29] looking at everything you can see
[1:12:31] everything that's reasonable Faith goes
[1:12:35] beyond reason
[1:12:37] you look at all these things and you
[1:12:40] look at this and you say well this is
[1:12:42] the way that it is the way that it is is
[1:12:45] the way that he says it is that what
[1:12:48] that's what it is that's the final place
[1:12:51] that's where it ends up that's the word
[1:12:53] of God that's how it is I don't care I
[1:12:56] don't care what he says is eternal
[1:13:03] so he said it
[1:13:06] and she said but we're looking at a
[1:13:08] promise
[1:13:11] now remember that
[1:13:14] we're looking at a promise
[1:13:16] we're looking at what that he said
[1:13:21] what is the promise
[1:13:24] of our election
[1:13:26] let's continue
[1:13:33] if a man Abide a spirit if a man abideth
[1:13:36] not in me
[1:13:38] he is cast forth as a branch
[1:13:42] and is withered and Men gather them and
[1:13:46] cast them into the fire
[1:13:48] and they are burned
[1:13:51] now this is what he's telling here so I
[1:13:54] want you to understand he's creating a
[1:13:57] law of contrast
[1:14:00] this is what happens to those that abide
[1:14:03] and this is what happens to those that
[1:14:06] don't abide
[1:14:08] let me add what I'm trying to drive home
[1:14:11] this morning
[1:14:13] this is what happens to the elected this
[1:14:16] is what happens to the unelected
[1:14:20] remember our term of faith in your
[1:14:23] election
[1:14:26] if you abide in me seven and my words
[1:14:29] abide in you ye shall ask what ye will
[1:14:33] and it shall be done unto you
[1:14:39] what a promise
[1:14:42] what a uh what a thing to add to the law
[1:14:46] of contrast
[1:14:48] these people are being cast Into the
[1:14:51] Fire
[1:14:52] but you
[1:14:54] elected can ask what you will
[1:15:02] how many of you have asked for a loved
[1:15:04] one
[1:15:05] how many of you have asked for your
[1:15:07] children
[1:15:11] and God has answered your prayer
[1:15:15] it was how wonderful it is
[1:15:22] you shall ask
[1:15:24] what ye will and it shall be done unto
[1:15:27] you herein is my father glorified
[1:15:31] that ye bear much fruit
[1:15:34] so shall ye be my disciples
[1:15:40] so
[1:15:41] it's hard sometimes for us to pick up
[1:15:45] the responsibility
[1:15:48] that goes with the election
[1:15:51] and and we could build on that sermon
[1:15:53] there for a long time you know I'm not a
[1:15:56] man of eloquent words and and you know
[1:16:00] that but there's a responsibility uh
[1:16:04] meant some maybe many of you maybe in
[1:16:06] life has got a scholarship or something
[1:16:10] uh an athletic scholarship or an
[1:16:13] education scholarship well they they say
[1:16:16] to you they say okay I'm going to give
[1:16:18] you four years of college
[1:16:21] well you know that that ain't a free
[1:16:23] pass
[1:16:25] you got to keep your grades up
[1:16:28] you know what I mean if you're on a some
[1:16:31] form of sports scholarship you have to
[1:16:35] make practices you have to do that you
[1:16:38] can relinquish your practice
[1:16:42] you can lose your scholarship
[1:16:45] because you didn't uh keep it that
[1:16:48] that's in the carnal
[1:16:50] but it's still a good understanding for
[1:16:53] us to realize that there's
[1:16:55] responsibilities that go with the
[1:16:58] election
[1:17:00] it glorifies the Father in Heaven if
[1:17:03] you're fruitful
[1:17:04] amen that you bear much fruit we we will
[1:17:08] always want that to have that thing the
[1:17:12] prophet of God made this statement in
[1:17:14] three kinds of Believers he said but
[1:17:17] just remember God is always on the scene
[1:17:21] he's right there ready at any time
[1:17:25] so he's always there doing his part
[1:17:31] he's never forsaken you
[1:17:34] right he's picked you he started with
[1:17:36] you he stayed with you so he said I'll
[1:17:39] never leave you nor forsake you but I'll
[1:17:42] be with you even in you till the end
[1:17:45] so we have the the author of our faith
[1:17:49] he's not only the author of our faith
[1:17:51] but he's the finisher of the faith he's
[1:17:54] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:17:57] let's bring that back down to what we're
[1:17:59] trying to say this morning about faith
[1:18:01] in our election he's the author of our
[1:18:04] election he's the finisher of our
[1:18:07] election now Jesus said I I could speak
[1:18:11] to my father and straightway he would
[1:18:15] send me 12 Legions of angels oh what
[1:18:20] would one Angel do
[1:18:22] see
[1:18:23] but you see he could he could send 12
[1:18:29] Legions of angels just at his command
[1:18:32] but he had a job to do
[1:18:36] he had something to do he had to go
[1:18:40] through with that we know he's speaking
[1:18:43] of calvary
[1:18:45] you've got something to do
[1:18:49] yeah now what is it that pleases God
[1:18:53] faith you have something to believe
[1:19:01] you've got something to believe this
[1:19:04] morning something that you've got to
[1:19:07] settle
[1:19:09] except
[1:19:10] and believe
[1:19:12] and act on
[1:19:15] you've got something
[1:19:17] for you to do you may have some
[1:19:20] heartaches and some troubles you may
[1:19:24] have some disappointments
[1:19:26] but do we pray to shun them no Lord take
[1:19:31] me through them whatever
[1:19:35] they is whatever it is don't let me
[1:19:39] escape them if you're set if they're set
[1:19:44] for me just give me Grace to go through
[1:19:47] that that's all
[1:19:50] man we're not trying to run
[1:19:54] we're going to take whatever comes our
[1:19:56] way as Christians is there hard times
[1:19:59] that come our way sometimes yes
[1:20:03] but it hasn't even entered into the
[1:20:05] hearts of men that the present suffering
[1:20:08] of this world is not worthy to be
[1:20:10] compared to the joy that the Lord has
[1:20:16] oh this morning if I could ever just in
[1:20:20] my life and if I could ever say the
[1:20:23] words to you somehow uh
[1:20:27] through the preaching of the word or a
[1:20:30] word of encouragement not to look back
[1:20:34] to leave those things which are behind
[1:20:36] behind and press for a higher calling
[1:20:42] press for what's out ahead of us
[1:20:46] that is as we continue to go this
[1:20:48] morning
[1:20:55] as the father hath loved me
[1:20:57] so have I loved you
[1:21:00] continue in my love
[1:21:04] this this is this is the gospel to the
[1:21:07] elect
[1:21:08] this is to the called out this is to The
[1:21:11] Chosen he's he's telling the people that
[1:21:15] aren't elected that aren't fruitful
[1:21:18] they're going to be gathered up and
[1:21:20] burned but he's not talking about you
[1:21:22] he's talking about you being fruitful
[1:21:27] let me attributes the statue of a
[1:21:30] perfect man
[1:21:31] the patience the kindness the fruits of
[1:21:34] the spirit let those things embellish
[1:21:37] your life
[1:21:38] let them let them flow out of you when
[1:21:42] there's some when you recognize
[1:21:44] something in your life uh you you that
[1:21:46] old prickly pear that old sour spirit
[1:21:49] that old judgmental attitude that old
[1:21:53] feeling that's when you rest you stop
[1:21:55] right there
[1:21:57] say Lord this isn't you
[1:22:00] you know Come Holy Spirit
[1:22:04] Lord I'm going to stop right here am I
[1:22:07] lift my hands and say Lord come around
[1:22:09] me
[1:22:10] fill me with your goodness fill me with
[1:22:13] your presence
[1:22:15] take this attitude from me
[1:22:18] it's just going to hurt me it's just
[1:22:20] going to hurt other people I I don't
[1:22:23] need to be like this why because I'm in
[1:22:26] the palm of your hand and nothing can
[1:22:28] pluck me out of the palm of your hand
[1:22:30] yeah you started at work in me you'll
[1:22:33] finish it Lord I I know I just don't
[1:22:37] need to let this world make me upset
[1:22:41] why do we want to put our Treasures
[1:22:45] where the the where the thief can come
[1:22:49] in and take them
[1:22:51] the Lord said on the story of Treasures
[1:22:53] in Heaven
[1:22:55] please place your reward to where you're
[1:22:57] going why do people save up for
[1:23:00] retirement
[1:23:02] they put all this money in a retirement
[1:23:05] fund they put all this money up there
[1:23:07] they invest all this money because they
[1:23:10] hope
[1:23:11] they're going to old age
[1:23:15] they don't have no guarantee
[1:23:19] right but they set money aside
[1:23:24] whole mankind
[1:23:26] setting money aside based on the fact
[1:23:29] that when they get old
[1:23:33] that there will be something there to
[1:23:35] take care of them
[1:23:37] I had a good friend dear friend of mine
[1:23:41] he lived in a trailer
[1:23:45] hit here
[1:23:48] hardly spend any money
[1:23:50] he was saving for retirement
[1:23:53] because when he grew up
[1:23:55] his family his grandparents were poor
[1:23:59] and they died poor
[1:24:01] and he didn't want to do that
[1:24:04] didn't want to go to a rest home and
[1:24:06] didn't want to go and nurture home he
[1:24:07] wanted any source of all his money up
[1:24:11] and passed away
[1:24:14] sometime in his 50s
[1:24:17] I don't want to put my treasures there
[1:24:19] if he lets me live to be a hundred he'll
[1:24:22] take care of me
[1:24:24] I have a mother that's a hundred she's
[1:24:27] not wealthy she's not rich she's got
[1:24:29] everything she has she's surrounded by
[1:24:31] family that loves her

[1:24:40] old Spirit a crabby old person you know
[1:24:44] and and not get out of my way you know
[1:24:47] and and full of bitterness to everybody

[1:26:06] so he's asking two things here
[1:26:09] that that my joy might remain in you and
[1:26:13] that your joy might be full
[1:26:16] uh-huh
[1:26:18] I want to be full of joy what do we call
[1:26:21] it in the scriptures joy unspeakable
[1:26:28] he said these things have been spoken to
[1:26:30] you that my joy might remain in you and
[1:26:33] that your joy might be filled this is my
[1:26:35] commandment that ye love one another
[1:26:38] as I have loved you greater love hath no
[1:26:41] man than this that a man lay down his
[1:26:44] life for his friend
[1:26:46] ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I
[1:26:50] command you
[1:26:51] henceforth I call you not servants
[1:26:55] for a servant knoweth not what his Lord
[1:26:59] does but I have called you friends for
[1:27:03] all things that I have heard of my
[1:27:06] father I have made known unto you glory
[1:27:12] you talk about the opening of the seals
[1:27:16] you talk about the mysteries of God
[1:27:19] being fulfilled
[1:27:20] you talk about the things that was hid
[1:27:23] from from the ages
[1:27:27] just think what he's done the great
[1:27:29] blessings that he's poured out to us the
[1:27:32] the revelations that you have the
[1:27:35] understandings that God
[1:27:37] getting you because according to the
[1:27:40] promises of God's word he sent forth a
[1:27:43] messenger in this age he wasn't he
[1:27:46] wasn't here to build churches he wasn't
[1:27:49] here to to start an organization
[1:27:54] he went everywhere freely wherever the
[1:27:57] door was opened
[1:27:58] he went and gave him the words of Hope
[1:28:01] the understanding the truth of the
[1:28:04] Gospel so men wouldn't be anchored in
[1:28:08] the wisdom of man
[1:28:11] the interpretation of men
[1:28:14] I don't know why people
[1:28:16] will take a carnal explanation
[1:28:20] of the scripture
[1:28:22] and the person that's giving the
[1:28:25] explanation doesn't have one bit of
[1:28:28] Faith to make any of the promises of God
[1:28:31] come to pass
[1:28:34] because they've connected
[1:28:37] with reasoning
[1:28:41] who's the first person in the scripture
[1:28:43] that ever connected with reasoning
[1:28:49] it was Eve
[1:28:53] it's a cause of everything the death of
[1:28:56] faith is reasoning
[1:28:59] you're going to reason it
[1:29:02] you're going to try to figure it out
[1:29:05] you're going to try to understand it
[1:29:09] forget it
[1:29:11] you don't have the mind
[1:29:13] the ability the understanding the carnal
[1:29:17] mind is enmity with God
[1:29:20] the carnal mind is death but the
[1:29:23] spiritual mind is life and freedom
[1:29:28] you can't figure it out
[1:29:31] you'll never come up with the answer why
[1:29:33] me
[1:29:37] I don't even know why you
[1:29:42] you know I have to have a lot of faith
[1:29:45] in your election sometimes
[1:29:50] let's read here
[1:29:54] I don't call you servant
[1:29:56] but I've called you friends
[1:29:58] for all things that I have heard of my
[1:30:00] father I have made known unto you now
[1:30:03] this is where I want to anchor for just
[1:30:06] a few moments now
[1:30:09] and I read all this to build to this
[1:30:11] scripture
[1:30:14] ye have not chosen me
[1:30:18] but I have chosen you
[1:30:21] and ordained you that ye should go and
[1:30:26] bring forth fruit
[1:30:28] so now we have the law of contrast right
[1:30:31] he said those who are not fruitful those
[1:30:33] who don't abide in me
[1:30:35] they'll be cast Into the Fire and now he
[1:30:38] lays that so that raises a question in
[1:30:41] your mind
[1:30:42] but now he's going to come back and
[1:30:44] solve that question this is what he has
[1:30:47] got to put to rest and this is what
[1:30:50] every single one of us in this room this
[1:30:53] morning has got to finally put to rest
[1:30:56] no preacher no law no nothing can ever
[1:31:00] come and attack you I'm tired of
[1:31:03] Ministries that beat down the people
[1:31:06] make them feel like sinners
[1:31:09] try to steal their election and try to
[1:31:12] give them some Litany of rules to follow
[1:31:19] all it does is make for starchy religion
[1:31:24] you know what starts to happen if the
[1:31:26] preacher dances everybody dances
[1:31:32] if someone screams and shouts everybody
[1:31:34] in the building feels if I don't scream
[1:31:36] and shout I'm not part of it it robs all
[1:31:40] the individualness out of it it robs the
[1:31:43] personal experience out of it it turns
[1:31:45] it into a religion it turns it into some
[1:31:48] sort of uh uh informal
[1:31:52] formal worship
[1:31:57] everything becomes group
[1:32:02] God didn't save a group he saved
[1:32:05] individuals then God placed those
[1:32:08] individuals in a body according to his
[1:32:11] good pleasure according to his God's
[1:32:14] word and he gave each one of those
[1:32:16] members in that body a Ministry to help
[1:32:19] every other member in that body
[1:32:23] it's that simple
[1:32:26] but we're talking about this morning
[1:32:28] having faith in your election
[1:32:31] and we're going to listen to 15 minutes
[1:32:33] here in just a moment if you'll be
[1:32:34] patient with me
[1:32:35] ye have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:32:38] you and ordained you
[1:32:44] that ye should go and bring forth fruit
[1:32:48] and that your fruit should remain
[1:32:52] and whatsoever ye shall ask of
[1:32:55] of the father in my name he may give it
[1:32:59] to you
[1:33:00] I want to lay this election down for a
[1:33:06] moment
[1:33:12] oh good to see you my brother it's been
[1:33:14] a while take your chair
[1:33:16] and bring your chair here and set it
[1:33:19] right here
[1:33:23] Dylan you take your chair and set it on
[1:33:27] that side
[1:33:28] you sit here
[1:33:38] now you look at this situation here
[1:33:42] you got two people
[1:33:44] right
[1:33:46] now if you
[1:33:52] give me the moment in this little drama
[1:33:57] to be God
[1:33:59] now I could come up with some scripture
[1:34:02] if you need to okay but uh in in this
[1:34:07] case uh the scripture said ye are Gods
[1:34:10] right so okay uh I can I can get some
[1:34:13] quotes uh to just show you that I'm not
[1:34:16] out of place
[1:34:17] now
[1:34:22] I'm God and I say I've elected you
[1:34:28] to be the greatest
[1:34:32] basketball player that ever played in
[1:34:36] the NBA
[1:34:38] how tall are you I am 5'7
[1:34:42] five seven
[1:34:43] well
[1:34:48] how much do you weigh
[1:34:53] 140 pounds
[1:34:55] pretty scrawny
[1:34:59] have you ever played basketball
[1:35:02] I mean are you like been on a team or
[1:35:04] anything yeah
[1:35:06] yeah okay so you think you're pretty
[1:35:08] good
[1:35:10] you think you can make the MBA
[1:35:13] no he don't but this guy
[1:35:18] how tall are you
[1:35:21] six three
[1:35:23] you play a lot of basketball
[1:35:26] frequently
[1:35:27] you pretty good
[1:35:32] is that the way you used to think
[1:35:35] did you think you could have made the
[1:35:37] MBA
[1:35:41] now reason tells you what
[1:35:47] he's the guy
[1:35:52] okay let's go to another place in
[1:35:54] scripture I'm sorry brother yeah I've
[1:35:56] got you in the negative role
[1:35:59] but I I hope I've proven my undying love
[1:36:04] for you
[1:36:06] how about David and Goliath
[1:36:14] right all through scripture
[1:36:18] I mean if we were to play the part if we
[1:36:20] were going to do a little Sunday school
[1:36:22] skit
[1:36:23] you would have him be Goliath
[1:36:26] and you would have him beat David
[1:36:28] because that's all in your natural mind
[1:36:33] if we were to pick Samson
[1:36:37] this would be Samson
[1:36:41] didn't know that would be Samson this
[1:36:43] would be Goliath right now if I was to
[1:36:45] pick a bodyguard
[1:36:48] to go someplace with me
[1:36:51] Dylan I'm sorry son
[1:36:54] but I wouldn't pick you
[1:36:59] you know what I mean if we were going to
[1:37:01] go somewhere you know who I'm taking
[1:37:02] right I'm taking this this guy here it
[1:37:06] makes more sense
[1:37:09] reason tells me
[1:37:12] to take him
[1:37:15] right right if I have something big and
[1:37:17] heavy to pick up
[1:37:21] right reason tells me
[1:37:25] to take him
[1:37:27] every instance that I approach
[1:37:33] that I make a judgment on and reasoning
[1:37:37] on I go after what I perceive to be my
[1:37:42] answer
[1:37:44] so now let's take this I I as God
[1:37:49] I've elected Dylan
[1:37:53] to be an astronaut
[1:37:57] so I go to him and I say I'm
[1:38:01] I'm gonna
[1:38:02] let you go back
[1:38:04] I've embarrassed you enough for one day
[1:38:07] but you know me right there will be
[1:38:10] another opportunity
[1:38:15] all right
[1:38:17] Dylan you're going to be an astronaut
[1:38:22] why is he going to be an astronaut
[1:38:26] because I said so
[1:38:31] I've elected him to be an astronaut
[1:38:36] no he he doesn't perceive himself as an
[1:38:39] astronaut he doesn't know how he's going
[1:38:41] to get to West Point he doesn't know how
[1:38:44] he's going to get in Nassau he doesn't
[1:38:46] know how he's going to get in that
[1:38:48] capsule there is no no way that he can
[1:38:53] perceive that he is going to be an
[1:38:57] astronaut sit in a capsule and go to the
[1:39:00] Moon
[1:39:02] no the people have already been to the
[1:39:04] Moon you are going to Mars
[1:39:07] as God
[1:39:10] I've elected you to go to Mars
[1:39:15] now
[1:39:17] how is he going to get to Mars what is
[1:39:20] the very thing that's putting him on
[1:39:23] Mars
[1:39:26] the fact that I elected him
[1:39:32] so he said I have chosen you
[1:39:36] and I have four ordained you to go to
[1:39:39] Mars
[1:39:41] now he can say okay now boy I better get
[1:39:45] into college I better brush up on my
[1:39:47] math I better make call the senator and
[1:39:50] make an application for West Point he
[1:39:52] can put up but now he's putting his
[1:39:54] Trust
[1:39:57] and the only thing he needs to have
[1:40:00] faith in is the election
[1:40:06] that's all that determines it
[1:40:10] that settles it
[1:40:13] it's the election
[1:40:15] if I've chosen him
[1:40:18] and I've elected him
[1:40:21] and I'm the creator of Heaven and Earth
[1:40:25] all things are subject to me I can make
[1:40:28] a way where there's no way I'm the
[1:40:30] Waymaker
[1:40:34] what is the only thing he has to have
[1:40:38] faith in
[1:40:39] come on is the election
[1:40:45] because it's the election
[1:40:49] that's going to provide for him
[1:40:51] everything that he has need of to bring
[1:40:56] him to what I've chosen him
[1:40:59] to be
[1:41:01] aren't you glad I'm not sending you to
[1:41:03] Mars
[1:41:04] okay thank you
[1:41:09] what's our trust in
[1:41:13] our trust is in the in the election
[1:41:20] what does it say in Romans 9.
[1:41:23] it's such a great scripture let's just
[1:41:26] run let's just look there and read it
[1:41:28] Romans 9 and 10.
[1:41:31] when I'm trying to get this morning is
[1:41:35] for us not to look around
[1:41:39] not to look at our works not to look at
[1:41:41] our Deeds not to look at what we think
[1:41:44] we sh we should be living how we should
[1:41:47] be living not not to look at anything
[1:41:50] but to settle on one thing
[1:41:54] he has elected me
[1:42:00] because everything I have need of
[1:42:03] all the Forgiveness of my sins all the
[1:42:07] being lifted up when I fall down all the
[1:42:10] mud that I have caked on me my election
[1:42:13] is what takes care of it all
[1:42:18] if you can do one thing for your
[1:42:20] salvation
[1:42:23] Jesus Christ died in vain
[1:42:27] you've got to know you're elected your
[1:42:30] whole life
[1:42:32] screams at you and says You're Not
[1:42:35] Elected
[1:42:37] looks back look what you've done look at
[1:42:41] how stupid you are look at how ugly you
[1:42:43] are look at how clumsy you are look at
[1:42:46] how socially inept you are
[1:42:51] there's not one thing about you
[1:42:55] that marriage anything he's the vine
[1:42:58] you're the branches you can do nothing
[1:43:00] without him
[1:43:02] I've ordained you
[1:43:06] to be fruitful
[1:43:09] Romans
[1:43:11] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[1:43:15] having conceived by one even our father
[1:43:18] Isaac for the children being not yet
[1:43:22] born
[1:43:24] neither having done any good or evil
[1:43:29] that the purpose of God according to
[1:43:32] election might stand the purpose of God
[1:43:37] according to election what he has
[1:43:40] purposed might stand
[1:43:42] not by good
[1:43:45] not by evil not by works
[1:43:48] not by failure
[1:43:52] one thing only
[1:43:54] I chose you
[1:43:57] I put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:43:59] Life you're mine no matter what the
[1:44:02] preachers say no matter what the church
[1:44:04] says they can't put you out
[1:44:10] they can't take your name off the Lamb's
[1:44:13] Book of Life they can't change
[1:44:16] the will of the father in beginning
[1:44:21] no man can change your election
[1:44:29] thank the Lord
[1:44:31] so what am I going to trust in
[1:44:35] what's my faith in
[1:44:38] because my election has every Victory I
[1:44:42] need
[1:44:43] the very things that I want to overcome
[1:44:46] in my life my failures my election
[1:44:51] is what has
[1:44:54] the substance
[1:44:57] to overcome my deficiency
[1:45:02] I cannot go out and make myself better
[1:45:08] and then become elected
[1:45:12] when did he elect you
[1:45:14] before there ever was a star before
[1:45:17] there ever was anything anywhere he
[1:45:20] elected you he chose you he puts your
[1:45:23] name on the Lamb's Book of Life he
[1:45:25] eternally secured you
[1:45:27] so now this is what he's saying I
[1:45:30] forordained it I am going to make you
[1:45:35] whether you fight it like Paul fighter
[1:45:39] Paul's out killing the very Church he's
[1:45:41] elected to be a part of
[1:45:48] but what did Paul find out
[1:45:50] he found out he was elected
[1:45:53] Paul why do you kick against the prey
[1:45:57] who are you Lord
[1:45:59] I'm Jesus
[1:46:01] whom you persecute
[1:46:03] I'm going to show you the things you
[1:46:05] have to suffer for my namesake
[1:46:09] you don't think Paul was at rest
[1:46:12] with his suffering
[1:46:14] he says I've been scourged I've been
[1:46:17] thrown in prison I've been stoned I've
[1:46:20] done all these things I counted all a
[1:46:22] joy that I might suffer for Christ he
[1:46:25] knew
[1:46:26] he knew he was elected what did he rest
[1:46:29] in he rested in one thing only one thing
[1:46:33] is settle it he chose me and because he
[1:46:36] chose me everything else is going to
[1:46:39] fall in place
[1:46:42] my faith is in my election
[1:46:47] oh I've got long but we'll be out by
[1:46:49] just a few moments I'm going to just
[1:46:51] read this scripture
[1:46:52] for the children not yet being born
[1:46:54] neither have done any good or evil that
[1:46:58] the purpose of God according to election
[1:47:01] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:47:04] calleth
[1:47:06] you want to overcome something
[1:47:09] you want to get better you want to get
[1:47:12] rid of a sin you know where your answer
[1:47:15] is it's in your election
[1:47:20] your election holds the victory
[1:47:25] if you believe that
[1:47:28] then you say Lord you've chosen me
[1:47:30] this part of my life is unfruitful
[1:47:33] because of my election
[1:47:35] I believe that you're taking this out of
[1:47:39] my life
[1:47:42] I'm not going to trust in the ability
[1:47:45] for me to get rid of it I'm not going to
[1:47:48] trust in the ability for me to overcome
[1:47:50] it I'm not going to trust it's got more
[1:47:52] power than I've got but there's one
[1:47:54] thing I've settled on there's one thing
[1:47:57] I know I'm elected and because I'm
[1:48:00] elected I'm trusting that in an election
[1:48:02] and that election possesses my victory
[1:48:06] to overcome that
[1:48:08] yeah
[1:48:11] but if I don't believe in that election
[1:48:14] if I don't have faith in the fact that
[1:48:17] I'm chosen if you doubt whether you're
[1:48:20] elected or chosen
[1:48:24] you'll be in a forever battle
[1:48:28] you've got to settle it
[1:48:31] I could give you every evidence of the
[1:48:35] election
[1:48:38] why do we listen to Satan
[1:48:41] when we know he's the father of lies and
[1:48:44] there's no truth in them
[1:48:46] I don't have the vocabulary or the
[1:48:49] preaching style this morning to
[1:48:54] come forth in my heart because I don't
[1:48:57] want you to Anchor in Emotion
[1:49:00] I don't want you to Anchor in the
[1:49:03] excitement of it I want it to soak down
[1:49:06] according to God's word
[1:49:10] you've got to have faith in your
[1:49:13] election your election is what does
[1:49:17] everything for you I am the vine ye are
[1:49:20] the branches without me you can do
[1:49:23] nothing you have to abide in me you have
[1:49:26] to abide in my election my election will
[1:49:30] make you fruitful my election will take
[1:49:33] care of you my election will forgive
[1:49:35] your sins my election will deliver you
[1:49:38] of your fault I am going to make you
[1:49:41] what I promised I would make you you
[1:49:43] don't look like an astronaut but I said
[1:49:46] you're going to be an astronaut
[1:49:47] therefore you're going to be an
[1:49:49] astronaut
[1:49:53] you say well I don't want to be an
[1:49:55] astronaut he'll change that too
[1:50:01] that's right
[1:50:03] you think I want to be a preacher
[1:50:08] I don't even think I like people
[1:50:12] but he changed that
[1:50:16] I tried to use every single excuse
[1:50:19] that I could
[1:50:21] I I I don't have social skills I I don't
[1:50:24] have facial recognition disorder I've
[1:50:27] got add you know what I mean everything
[1:50:30] about it but you know what he says he
[1:50:33] says I chose you my grace is sufficient
[1:50:36] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:50:39] I'll make a way I'll take care of it you
[1:50:42] just believe one thing
[1:50:46] just believe it
[1:50:48] you already aren't
[1:50:51] confess
[1:50:52] but how long do you halt between two
[1:50:55] opinions
[1:50:59] as for me and my house we're going to
[1:51:01] serve God
[1:51:06] you've got to settle it
[1:51:10] you think you're going to choose the
[1:51:11] world no you're not
[1:51:15] no
[1:51:16] he'll seek the hound dogs of Hell after
[1:51:18] you
[1:51:20] you're not going to get nothing can
[1:51:22] pluck you out of the palm of my hand
[1:51:29] elect according to election might stand
[1:51:31] not of works but of him that calleth him
[1:51:36] that elected
[1:51:38] I said unto her the Elder Shall Serve
[1:51:41] the younger and as it is written Jacob
[1:51:44] have I loved and Esau have I hated what
[1:51:49] shall we say then is God therefore
[1:51:52] unright unrighteous with God God forbid
[1:51:55] for he saidth unto Moses I have mercy on
[1:51:58] whom I'll have mercy and I'll have
[1:52:01] compassion on whom I'll have compassion
[1:52:03] so then it is not him that willeth
[1:52:07] nor him that runeth
[1:52:10] but of God
[1:52:12] that showeth Mercy
[1:52:19] I want to play for you and if if you
[1:52:21] need to go I I totally understand uh
[1:52:24] this will be a good time but we're going
[1:52:26] to listen to 15 minutes
[1:52:29] of perfect faith
[1:52:31] now as we read this
[1:52:33] I want you to see what the prophet of
[1:52:36] God is expressing really what perfect
[1:52:39] faith is perfect Faith isn't the faith
[1:52:44] that operates the promises
[1:52:47] perfect faith is not the faith that
[1:52:50] makes you well
[1:52:54] it's like Sin Sin isn't drinking smoking
[1:52:58] it's the attributes of unbelief
[1:53:05] fruit
[1:53:07] and works
[1:53:08] they're the attribute
[1:53:11] of those who have perfect faith in their
[1:53:16] elections
[1:53:19] perfect faith is oh I can take this
[1:53:22] promise and work it
[1:53:24] I can take that promise and work it
[1:53:27] I can go do this work I can do work no
[1:53:31] perfect faith is whether you never do a
[1:53:34] work in your life but you have 100
[1:53:37] faith in your election
[1:53:41] and that's what Satan's been trying to
[1:53:43] rob
[1:53:45] a lot of us of
[1:53:48] we look at ourselves in the mirror
[1:53:51] and we want to see the election there
[1:53:54] the election is in him
[1:53:58] he made the election
[1:54:01] when you believe that
[1:54:04] you could be looking at somebody that
[1:54:06] has got two horns and a fork tail
[1:54:09] holding a pitchfork
[1:54:12] but if you believe I've been elected
[1:54:16] he will transform
[1:54:18] that you'll lose your horns you'll lose
[1:54:22] your fork you'll lose your tail
[1:54:25] you lose your red coat
[1:54:27] and all of a sudden a Christian is going
[1:54:31] to emerge
[1:54:32] by your work
[1:54:34] by works no by him that calleth
[1:54:39] him that chose
[1:54:40] just like he could take Dylan and
[1:54:43] transform him into an astronaut if that
[1:54:47] was his will he can take you because he
[1:54:50] purposed it I have chosen you you didn't
[1:54:54] choose me I have ordained you to
[1:54:57] whatever works that it is it will not
[1:54:59] fail so Faith perfect faith what you're
[1:55:04] believing God is you first got to
[1:55:07] believe that God has elected you if you
[1:55:11] have any doubt in that
[1:55:13] you are stuck
[1:55:17] you can't go to the left you can't go to
[1:55:20] the right you can't be a good sinner
[1:55:23] and you can't be a good Christian
[1:55:26] what have you become
[1:55:29] what is the curse
[1:55:32] of lady osia
[1:55:34] lukewarm
[1:55:38] I would that you were hot or cold
[1:55:40] because you're lukewarm I've Got The
[1:55:44] Spill thee out of my mouth
[1:55:47] there's only one thing that can take you
[1:55:49] out of that condition
[1:55:51] is when you can hear the word of God
[1:55:54] because my word has made you clean
[1:55:58] and you can put Faith in what he said
[1:56:02] and you're going to hear our messenger
[1:56:04] make these turn this these stains
[1:56:07] therefore he relied upon what God had
[1:56:10] made him
[1:56:11] and if he did that can't we rely upon
[1:56:14] what God made us
[1:56:16] he says now the only thing you have to
[1:56:19] do then is to have faith in what you are
[1:56:21] have faith in what the word says you are
[1:56:25] let's listen to this 15 minutes we'll be
[1:56:28] closed there'll be communion tonight so
[1:56:31] what we'll do with our Sunday schools
[1:56:33] will start Sunday school right at five
[1:56:35] o'clock and then it should be done by
[1:56:38] the time we have communion and the
[1:56:40] brothers can fix the back room is
[1:56:42] everybody okay you got 15 minutes to
[1:56:44] listen to the messenger
[1:56:46] amen
[1:56:48] let's settle it
[1:56:51] I hope when you walk out of here today
[1:56:54] that you'll come to one conclusion I'm
[1:56:57] elected
[1:57:00] now what you do with that election we
[1:57:02] can preach on that another time but
[1:57:05] until that questions answered
[1:57:09] we're in lady osia
[1:57:13] we're in a lady you'll see a attitude
[1:57:15] we're in a lady you'll see a mindset
[1:57:18] we're in a ladyocia actions the only
[1:57:21] thing that's going to rise us out of
[1:57:23] ladyocia is election
[1:57:27] the only thing that's going to take us
[1:57:30] in the Rapture is
[1:57:32] election
[1:57:34] the first thing we've got to settle and
[1:57:37] Believe on is election we must have
[1:57:41] faith in our election
[1:57:45] let's let the messenger share it with us
[1:57:48] in the next few minutes God bless you
[1:57:53] now Faith being the substance and in
[1:57:56] there we find out in Hebrews what faith
[1:57:59] was and what those did do have faith
[1:58:03] see there's many times that people have
[1:58:06] faced the day and tomorrow they haven't
[1:58:07] got it the next day they're stopping and
[1:58:09] something else for when God wants
[1:58:12] anchors it and you see it there's
[1:58:14] nothing ever going to make you move from
[1:58:17] you're just poking reaching pursuing and
[1:58:21] pursuing this adventure without
[1:58:22] Authority you're just trying this and
[1:58:24] trying this and go to this and run here
[1:58:26] and run there you haven't got the faith
[1:58:28] yet but when that is what we call Faith
[1:58:34] excuse me I want you to thank you
[1:58:37] I I want you to get this now we the
[1:58:40] church has got to lift itself in the
[1:58:43] power of God how we're to close to the
[1:58:46] end now
[1:58:47] and I believe the church is in condition
[1:58:49] where we can teach it a little deeper
[1:58:52] things and rub some of this make-believe
[1:58:54] out amen see don't get into something
[1:58:57] real see it's got to be something that
[1:59:01] you know
[1:59:03] if you say uh uh brother Branham uh that
[1:59:07] isn't the line
[1:59:09] get our noise
[1:59:12] how do you do it tonight I'm looking at
[1:59:15] it or how do you know what you could be
[1:59:17] wrong my side has always declared to me
[1:59:20] that that was life
[1:59:21] see and that's the reason I believe
[1:59:23] those Visions because it's always
[1:59:25] declared to me the true spot that comes
[1:59:27] from the word amen then if he says it
[1:59:30] that settled it now when it's declared
[1:59:33] like that there's no more guesswork it's
[1:59:35] going to be then you hear it thus half
[1:59:39] the law see because it's beyond the
[1:59:42] human thinking it's up into the realm of
[1:59:45] the large thing but you're standing here
[1:59:47] just as Divine just as a bridge
[1:59:50] producing the fruit that's in the Vine
[1:59:53] see God uses man and man only God
[1:59:56] doesn't use Machinery God doesn't use
[1:59:58] groups to man God doesn't use
[1:59:59] organization God uses individuals
[2:00:03] always
[2:00:04] thy faith is the substance and five we
[2:00:08] understand all those things are done
[2:00:10] it's not a it's not a imagination it is
[2:00:14] a substance especially perfect Faith
[2:00:18] that's what I'm talking on tonight
[2:00:19] getting into perfect faith
[2:00:21] it is not an imagination now other
[2:00:25] people come say oh I got all Faith oh I
[2:00:28] sure have or are you stand here for them
[2:00:29] see
[2:00:31] your very actions prove that you haven't
[2:00:34] got what you're talking about
[2:00:36] see if you had faith in where you stand
[2:00:39] the prayer line
[2:00:40] what do you do these things for see if
[2:00:43] you had perfect Faith you'd look right
[2:00:46] straight to God believe it and walk away
[2:00:47] and you would you would have no need of
[2:00:50] coming into a prayer
[2:00:51] you'd have no need of these things
[2:00:53] because your faith is done made it so
[2:00:57] and I see it or what would be the use
[2:00:59] for me saying I got to put a shirt on
[2:01:02] I got a shirt on
[2:01:04] how do you know you got a shirt them
[2:01:06] well I see it feel it and I know it's
[2:01:09] that
[2:01:10] well that's just how real that one's
[2:01:13] perfect Faith takes the whole you don't
[2:01:16] need no more praise God it's already
[2:01:18] done you know it hallelujah how do you
[2:01:20] do it they tell me so amen that's it see
[2:01:24] do you get it down one of these that's
[2:01:26] perfect faith in other words I'm
[2:01:29] venturing out well I'll go with the
[2:01:31] Bible say to all the elders let them
[2:01:33] knowing I want to pray over I know how
[2:01:34] I'm going and you said well I'm going to
[2:01:36] be you'll see you're making yourself
[2:01:38] don't watch how you're going to make
[2:01:40] yourself just just worked out
[2:01:45] there he was
[2:01:47] you just have faith
[2:01:49] your genuine faith will do it right
[2:01:51] there your your genuine faith will make
[2:01:54] us so real to you that look at that
[2:01:56] little woman with the blood issue she
[2:01:58] said if I can only touch the border of
[2:02:00] His Garment I'll be made well if I had
[2:02:03] as soon as she did she said she felt
[2:02:05] within herself that her blood issues
[2:02:07] stopped
[2:02:08] and she actually proceeded
[2:02:12] I want to see touched it the truth and
[2:02:16] stop and stopped Jesus turned and said
[2:02:18] who touched me
[2:02:20] that's perfect faith and that same
[2:02:24] perfect faith and I will touch Jesus
[2:02:26] Christ just as it did that
[2:02:28] a woman comes with a perfect face for
[2:02:31] that time now
[2:02:34] we see at first the disciples didn't
[2:02:38] have this perfect faith
[2:02:40] they didn't have it because they'd had
[2:02:43] Christ walking with him but then
[2:02:46] afterwards Christ was in that amen and
[2:02:49] so you see it's hard then to have this
[2:02:53] perfect faith
[2:02:54] without the Holy Spirit it has to bring
[2:02:58] it it does now you say the disciples
[2:03:01] didn't have perfect Faith No for they
[2:03:03] had an epileptic child there that they
[2:03:06] were trying to cast this devil out of me
[2:03:08] and they couldn't do it and the father
[2:03:10] seen Jesus coming and he said we have
[2:03:13] brought my son to to your disciples and
[2:03:17] they could not cure him
[2:03:19] okay
[2:03:20] and afterwards the disciples asked Jesus
[2:03:24] saying why could not we cure him and
[2:03:27] Jesus said because of a lack of faith
[2:03:30] and of your unbelief
[2:03:32] that's right because of your unbelief
[2:03:36] that I remember they had this house
[2:03:40] Jesus had given them power
[2:03:43] the heel was sick to raise the dead he
[2:03:45] cast out Devils just a few days before
[2:03:46] that yes
[2:03:48] they had the power
[2:03:50] but not the face
[2:03:52] to use the power
[2:03:54] now there's the grand Tabernacle there
[2:03:57] is a church the bride today the holy
[2:04:00] spirit is here with the power amen but
[2:04:03] you haven't got that Faith to prove it
[2:04:05] everybody
[2:04:07] see what it means
[2:04:10] it takes Faith to move it
[2:04:13] here I got a shell that a hand loaded I
[2:04:17] know what it'll do by ballistics like
[2:04:19] the word
[2:04:20] but I've got to fire the gun
[2:04:23] the fire has to get to the power the
[2:04:25] powder's got the power that's got to
[2:04:27] have the fire to light it up
[2:04:29] and the same thing that powers in the
[2:04:31] shell
[2:04:32] but it needs space to charge it let's go
[2:04:37] out
[2:04:38] that's what it takes
[2:04:40] the perfect Faith to ignite the power of
[2:04:45] the Holy Spirit which we have now since
[2:04:46] he's come upon us amen Faith to ignite
[2:04:50] to see great things
[2:04:53] is to the faith something that persisted
[2:04:57] to you for the Heart full of joy you
[2:04:59] walk into the sick room knowing exactly
[2:05:01] what you're going to say walk you never
[2:05:03] know what's going to happen something's
[2:05:05] already been redeemed and you know it
[2:05:08] and you walk in in the name of Jesus
[2:05:10] Christ rise up from there God pay us
[2:05:12] alone here you are that's perfect faith
[2:05:16] if there's these 10 million people stand
[2:05:18] there say it wouldn't happen you know
[2:05:19] what's going to happen anyhow because
[2:05:21] you know it
[2:05:23] it's going to happen regardless what
[2:05:25] anybody else says you're the one that
[2:05:27] got the faith
[2:05:29] could you imagine Joshua
[2:05:31] he called the Elders of Israel together
[2:05:33] and said uh brethren we are the Servants
[2:05:37] of the Lord I would like for you to say
[2:05:39] uh ask the Lord is it be all right if uh
[2:05:43] Ezekiel us a little more sunlight see
[2:05:45] and hold the son of a walk no he has
[2:05:49] need of it and without prayer without
[2:05:52] anything he had need of it and he just
[2:05:55] commanded the son amen
[2:06:02] not only in the service of the law yeah
[2:06:05] but he sent me over here to do this job
[2:06:09] and I'll do the best I don't know how
[2:06:10] and the enemy is routing and then I
[2:06:13] didn't hear if I let the sun go down
[2:06:15] they'll get together and cause me more
[2:06:16] trouble stand still
[2:06:18] [Applause]
[2:06:21] come down for 24 hours
[2:06:24] [Applause]
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:26] now if the world's turning it holds it
[2:06:29] up and the Sun stays in the place and it
[2:06:31] don't run what happened there amen
[2:06:34] that's right now you make yourself an
[2:06:36] Infidel because if you say of this and
[2:06:39] then if you don't see children full of
[2:06:41] science because they said the world will
[2:06:42] stop and drop from now on did you say
[2:06:45] God's words not right then you're an
[2:06:47] Infidel amen ever
[2:06:49] what happened that's amazing man I don't
[2:06:52] know the mechanics of it but it happened
[2:06:54] amen I don't know the mechanics of the
[2:06:56] Holy Ghost but I know it fell on me and
[2:06:58] I I can't tell the mechanics of it but I
[2:07:01] know the blessings of it that's that's
[2:07:02] all I care to know about is the blessing
[2:07:05] of the Holy Ghost and mechanics keyword
[2:07:07] said that's his secret
[2:07:09] this boy cannot be healed because the
[2:07:12] disciples had power Jesus gave them
[2:07:14] power to heal all men are sickness to
[2:07:16] cast out Devils to cleans the lepers and
[2:07:19] to raise the Dead
[2:07:21] and he gave their power
[2:07:23] but they didn't have faith to operate
[2:07:26] the power that they had and then they
[2:07:28] questioned Jesus and says well now why
[2:07:30] couldn't we do it now remember they had
[2:07:33] the word
[2:07:34] and the Word was resting
[2:07:37] and the word told them I'd give you
[2:07:40] power heaven
[2:07:42] amen
[2:07:45] I'll give you power
[2:07:47] and they had the power
[2:07:49] but they didn't have faith to operate
[2:07:51] the word that was in them amen see what
[2:07:54] I mean yeah
[2:07:57] Jesus had
[2:07:59] he was the word and he had faith that
[2:08:03] what he said would happen amen
[2:08:05] so bringing here
[2:08:08] how long will I suffer you
[2:08:11] he had Faith with his power
[2:08:15] how did he
[2:08:16] he said I can do nothing in myself
[2:08:20] wow he relied upon
[2:08:24] why you are
[2:08:26] he relied in knowing that he was the
[2:08:28] word
[2:08:30] and he had faith in God
[2:08:32] who made him the word he was God the
[2:08:35] word
[2:08:36] and it was in him and that's giving
[2:08:38] Faith because he understood his position
[2:08:42] he knowed what he was because the
[2:08:44] scripture had said he was this
[2:08:47] and here every scriptures tied in the
[2:08:49] proof that he was exactly what the
[2:08:51] scripture said he would be and he knew
[2:08:53] what he was
[2:08:55] therefore he relied upon what God had
[2:08:59] made him amen and if he did that they
[2:09:04] can't we rely up on what God made us as
[2:09:06] believers
[2:09:08] these times shall follow him that
[2:09:10] believes
[2:09:12] he had faith and what he was
[2:09:16] and if you are a Believer you have faith
[2:09:19] in what you are
[2:09:20] you are a believer
[2:09:22] as you've got faith in God the Bible
[2:09:25] says over here in uh if our uh if our
[2:09:29] hearts condemn us then we can have faith
[2:09:32] but if our hearts don't condemn us then
[2:09:35] we happy we have confidence towards God
[2:09:37] if you want to read that found Saint
[2:09:39] John 3 21. I got the scripture written
[2:09:42] down there how many
[2:09:44] thank you Army First John 3 21. uh
[2:09:47] notice if our hearts condemn us not
[2:09:50] then we have confidence towards God but
[2:09:53] as long as you're doing things that's
[2:09:54] wrong you can't have confidence towards
[2:09:56] God
[2:09:57] so you see you can you automatically
[2:10:00] know that you're wrong
[2:10:02] you already make a touch yourself back
[2:10:04] here a sinner by knowing that you're
[2:10:07] wrong but when your heart don't condemn
[2:10:09] me and you know you are a Believer and
[2:10:12] there's nothing between you and God
[2:10:13] because that's what you will and know
[2:10:16] that it'll be given amen because it's
[2:10:18] the word that's given to you just like
[2:10:20] it was to those disciples now the only
[2:10:22] thing you have to do then is have faith
[2:10:24] in what you are
[2:10:27] amen have faith in what the word says
[2:10:29] you are and Jesus had faith in the word
[2:10:32] of God that said what he was it is
[2:10:34] written of me
[2:10:36] that David in the Psalms and the
[2:10:38] prophets and all of them speak of him I
[2:10:40] am the bread of life that come from God
[2:10:42] out of heaven amen I am the Tree of Life
[2:10:46] from the Garden of Eden I have all these
[2:10:49] things I am that I am
[2:10:51] and he knew that a perfect faith that he
[2:10:54] was the anointed Messiah that the spirit
[2:10:57] of God was upon him he said now I myself
[2:11:00] do nothing but it's my faith in God and
[2:11:04] God was ending the word may manifest and
[2:11:07] when the word of God comes in you it's
[2:11:09] made manifest
[2:11:10] or you are a believer
[2:11:12] see an agreement is the face of God that
[2:11:15] moves in you you like that I like when
[2:11:19] you all right before the how to uh what
[2:11:22] faith really is
[2:11:24] knowing who he was
[2:11:26] without a shadowed doubt he knew he was
[2:11:28] the son of God
[2:11:30] he knew it
[2:11:32] for the word identified
[2:11:36] the word of God identified who he was
[2:11:40] he said if I do not to worship my father
[2:11:42] then don't believe me
[2:11:44] but if I don't do them Works don't
[2:11:46] believe me but if I do then please the
[2:11:48] worst for they are the manifested words
[2:11:52] or if you just wake up to that a minute
[2:11:56] you see
[2:11:57] the word itself identified
[2:12:00] Who You Are
[2:12:01] and he says who can condemn me instead
[2:12:05] in other words who can show me that my
[2:12:08] life and my words don't fulfill exactly
[2:12:10] what Messiah should do
[2:12:13] nobody could say nothing
[2:12:15] for he was and he had Faith to believe
[2:12:18] that whatever he said would happen
[2:12:20] then he turned around and said the words
[2:12:22] that I do shall you also a little while
[2:12:24] the world says the more yet you shall
[2:12:26] because I'll be with you even in you
[2:12:28] take old thought why she's for safe for
[2:12:31] it's not you to speak it's that father
[2:12:33] that dwelleth in you he one does the
[2:12:35] speaking and stop me it's the father
[2:12:37] that dwells in me he doeth the word
[2:12:42] now the identification of the scripture
[2:12:46] Christians these words says Jesus these
[2:12:51] signs shall follow them I believe
[2:12:54] now how can you call yourself a believer
[2:12:56] of people and deny those words
[2:13:00] how can you call yourself a Believer and
[2:13:03] deny any of this one amen amen you can't
[2:13:06] do it you're not a believer therefore
[2:13:08] science can't follow it because you just
[2:13:11] accept what you want to believe and
[2:13:12] that's the rest of us you want don't
[2:13:14] believe
[2:13:15] but you've got to take the whole thing
[2:13:16] and believe that's right amen and when
[2:13:18] you truly believe not make believe but
[2:13:20] really believe then these signs follow
[2:13:22] them at least
[2:13:24] amen
[2:13:28] foreign
[2:13:30] I just want to say this
[2:13:34] too many Christians
[2:13:37] get the cart before the horse
[2:13:41] they they trying to measure themselves
[2:13:44] by the signs and wonders
[2:13:47] I'm not a believer
[2:13:49] because I don't have the signs and
[2:13:51] wonders
[2:13:52] if you believe who you are you believe
[2:13:57] what the scripture said you are if you
[2:14:01] believe what he made you could you
[2:14:04] remember this saying he said he had
[2:14:07] Faith with his power how did he
[2:14:11] how did he have faith to do this he
[2:14:15] believed what the scripture said he was
[2:14:19] can't you believe
[2:14:22] the key
[2:14:23] the whole start to everything the signs
[2:14:27] the Wonders everything is your final
[2:14:30] without doubt without question without
[2:14:34] any unbelief whatsoever I'm elected I'm
[2:14:38] chosen
[2:14:43] then all things are possible
[2:14:45] your Transformations possible signs
[2:14:48] falling every come will come in its
[2:14:51] season but until that is settled he's
[2:14:54] settled
[2:14:56] who he was first
[2:14:59] he didn't do one sign
[2:15:02] in one Wonder without knowing who he was
[2:15:07] that's perfect Faith get the seed
[2:15:12] planted first
[2:15:14] get the Seed Faith planted your election

[2:15:28] sins

[2:15:37] but that's my sins didn't save me
[2:15:42] my sins don't make me a better Christian
[2:15:46] what makes me a Christian
[2:15:48] election

[2:15:54] morning I hope you can see that's
[2:15:57] exactly what the prophet thought how did
