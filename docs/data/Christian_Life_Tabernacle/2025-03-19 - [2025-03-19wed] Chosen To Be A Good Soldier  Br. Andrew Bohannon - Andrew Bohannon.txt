Description:
Chosen To Be A Good Soldier
Br. Andrew Bohannon
Wednesday Evening Service
March 19th, 2025
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

a bright spot and uh brother Isaiah was preaching that morning on going into another dimension and um I know he wouldn't mind me sharing this because it's on his heart but he he he remembered there was a a bright spot in the room where he was sitting and and uh that evening God just started to pull him over to that Dimension he had a stroke but when brother Isaiah came to see him he was full of vigor and he pulled him in close to him and shook said brother Isaiah it's everything you were preaching on this morning and so the Lord took him beyond the curtain of time and you know on this side we're heavy-hearted and I believe that was uh sister Kim's last uh living relative and so just remember her and um the verton at the passing away of this uh family member brother Keith but you know

and the Lord and how many have a need tonight we I know that there's many out but as we're here and you just want to lift up your need to the Lord one more time and by the preaching of the word your need can be met let's go to him in prayer Our precious Lord Jesus Lord you see the hearts behind the hand Lord you know that need Father Here we are your children Lord and we're needy father we need uh bread from Heaven Lord we need revelation Lord we know that it takes the operation of your Holy Spirit now and so we pray God that you would have your sway your way your will and that everything that can be said and done here would be edifying to the body and pleasing to you Lord as we commit the needs of your people we've heard the request and Lord surely our heart aches when Lord a Believer leaves and Lord in another way we're rejoicing father father and so just pray God that you would oh God not leave that undone Lord but that you would bring peace and comfort and joy Lord that you can give a sight beyond what can be seen father as we commit the needs Lord here we just ask that you would Minister to your people only as you can do for the glory of God we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen if you want to open your Bibles we're just going to read a few scriptures I have a simple thought and just trust by the help of the lord we can deliver it we can go rejoicing amen second Timothy Chapter 2 just thinking this week about remembering that we're in a battle you know sometimes you get going and you just you know it's in the back part of your mind but I want to keep it in the Forefront of my mind you know we're we're in a battle and um I won't keep you standing very long but we'll have two other scripture readings but let's read this together in second Timothy Chapter 2 we're going to read verses 1-2 amen scripture says Thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Jesus Christ Christ Jesus and the things that thou H has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that Warth entangle himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a a soldier I love that so much that's what I want to talk to you about tonight if I can title this thought to you is you've been chosen to be a good soldier it's not of your own choosing God did it it's by the will of God Amen and if a man also strive for the Mastery yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully the husbandman that labor must be first partaker of the fruits consider what I say and the Lord give thee understanding in all things remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I Endure all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us amen you may have your seats trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word I have also another scripture we'll just go to these two are very familiar but just in the way of remembrance we'll just mention them at the start just as a foundation in Ephesians chapter 2 and verses 8 9 and 10 the scripture says for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourself it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath for ordained that we should walk in them amen we're a happy people because God has ordained us to be good soldiers and he's ordained us to good works and I love that how it's ordered just right there in the scripture you know in the fight we got to realize it was the grace that of God that called us and and we're saved by grace but there's something that's connected with that it's through Revelation it's through faith amen these are the things that in our Warfare we must remind ourselves also in Galatians Galatians chapter 3 I'm sorry Galatians Chapter 2 in verse 20 says I am crucified with Christ neverthe nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live In the Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if the righteousness come by the law then Christ is died it dead in vain amen you know I was just fellowshipping with my daughter Hannah this week and I just it just struck me so much that we must remember that we're in a battle we must constantly remind ourselves not only that we're in a battle but the Lord's on our side and we don't want to go out into this battle front without a purpose we don't want to go out just fighting with our flesh right there's many times where we're trying to you know work on our outside you know we're constantly doing it but I feel like that's part of what an overcomer is is recognize that it's not about us putting all of this outward something but there is just like it was in the natural the the church world has rejected Christ and he's on the outside and he's knocking trying to get back on the inside but I just want to remind you that it's actually Christ in you that is the hope of glory I don't want to be going out and taking the word of God and letting my intellects try to Captivate a power to manifest some outward uh emotion or reaction or anything to make myself settled I I don't want it to be something that I can do so much on an expression but I want it to be God in Me It's the faith of God that's in me that's moving me that's the expression of the believer you know it's it's uh reminding me about this time back in 2006 I I remember it was right before the Lord opened the message to me I was laying there on the couch and I'd been down for days I had just got back from Trinidad and Tobago and uh while I was working out of the country I ended up Contracting a disease and I didn't know that I thought oh I'm just having a bunch of back pain and I got a headache and well it turns out they said I had menitis and I waited so long to go the doctor then they just said you know well anyway let me back up well I was sitting on that couch you know I was suffering and I I just remember my wife's in the kitchen and Haley was she was probably six months old 7 months old maybe just within a year's time but she was crawling around and I just remember just agonizing and I was at my give up I was done I'm I'm not going to sugarcoat this I I was done I was waving the white flag I said God heal me or kill me I'm done I'm I'm at my end I'm ready to go I mean if this is it I'm I'm giving up I'm at the end of my rope I can't take it anymore I've never been under this kind of slow I've never been under this kind of strain I've never been under this kind of Oppression physically mentally spiritually I was done I wasn't fighting no more it was over but then something something happened amen something on the inside I begin to see my wife struggling cooking I see my little baby crawling I was thinking there's something on the inside that came and he says it's time to fight amen it's time to get up amen I love it when the inside something starts jangling and bubbling up it's not me trying to work something up there's something on the inside that's saying it's time to go it's time to take a step it's not time to lay here and woe is me and look at myself and all my symptoms all my problems all my difficulties no but there's something on the inside that's pushing me forward it was the faith of God that moved amen that's what we want to see in action today we want to see faith in action in his believing children not worried about the symptoms not worried about the struggle but getting into the presence of God and saying I'm at the end of my road I need something that's greater than myself greater than my struggle greater than my disease greater than my adversary that's what I need I need that inside Soldier so I can fight the good fight of Faith amen that's what we're talking about today tonight we want to have the fight of Faith the the opposition's coming so that you can overcome we've been given promises heyen we're not here to back up we're here to walk forward we want the inside something to be on the Battlefront that that Spirit of the word to be channeled right at the front of the battle line it's not me it's Christ in me amen I ain't waiting around for my flesh to decide what I'm going to do there's something that loves this word there's something that loves him coming into me manifesting materializing his grace because it's that Revelation that recognizes I'm I'm a good soldier I've been chosen for this battle bring it on I'm more than able to do this that's what the father of our faith did he knew that God was able to fulfill his promise he wasn't waiting for the devil to hoop more troubles he just looked to the word Lord you said it I believe it amen I ain't waiting around for you to clown me devil trying to make us clowns we're Believers we're children of God we stand on the word the devil has to back [Music] up it's time to fight you know it's time to fight you know you know our our our armorment our battle our battle is a RAID we we want to recognize we're in a battle in a battle it's not so much out there the battle's on the inside it's the greatest battle that's ever been fought is now raging in the minds of human beings doubt and Faith are waging they are pressing in on us but praise God you've been chosen to fight the good fight amen you know we want to strive for the Mastery you know I think we have many examples in the word of God that we can look to to see that there was others that took God at his word and they were striving for the Mastery despite the opposition you know a lot of times what it does is we come to the very end of ourselves you know where it doesn't look like there's any hope and all the things that we can do is look to the Unseen you know it's not something great something out outside it's what God has spoke on the inside you're more than able I've made you more than a conqueror you know it's just special to think about that we're in about I had some quotes and some scriptures uh to add to this but I just tell you we might just close here in a minute brother Billy I feel wore out already but praise God y'all keep pulling we'll just stay here as long as the Lord tells us go you know it's just I was thinking about the scripture and whenever Brother David was preaching Sunday night I was like yeah this is it I'mma I'm going go ahead and share this the next time the Lord has me speak so here we are in 1 Corinthians 10 it says this in uh verses 12 and 13 I don't mean to be yelling but man it feels good get rid of this devil that was itching my throat so in uh 1 Corinthians 1 Corinthians 10 1 Corinthians 10 and we'll start there in verse 12 says wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall now as we read this just remember we're in a battle because the enemy wants to wage war in our thinking right so we're our battle is actually a battle of wills what the enemy can get us to think about like instead of like what Jeremiah spoke and he said I know the thoughts that I think towards you thoughts to prosper you thoughts not of evil but to bring you to an expected end God spoke things and and by faith he knows it's going to come to pass it's already manif in his mind it's already settled but now we're the soldiers acting out the plague that's right right so God's thoughts are for you but there's a battle where we're our thinking has been hibiz and and we got sin nature to contend with we got memory reasonings affections imaginations these things are Waring against us and it's not what I think about you so much as what God is trying to do on the inside so that I can be a master of every circumstance and let my faith live out in my personal walk I must be a partaker of the fruit first I want to see God go out to work for other believers I want to see God do for you what you need but God deal with the inside first come on the inside and pulsate the love of God the Forgiveness of God the goodness of God the kindness of God let me forgive like God let oh my I want to walk like God think like God talk like God live like God that's the you're chosen for this amen this is you this is me I love to see Christ manifest in his children this is the very age of the Life of Christ we want to strive for the Mastery we want to strive to keep life in us we have all of these things raging war against us that the Life of Christ might live in me live in you this is you this is for you he died for you he died for me what was the purpose of his death he's redeemed us he's given of his Spirit he wants his nature to be expressed in us hallelujah my where therefore let him that thinketh is standing take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taken you such as common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way of the Escape that ye may be able to Bear it Hallelujah God is a way maker that is there is no shadow in that promise God Will Make A Way of Escape that you may bear it the struggle sometimes is there's a kink in the line sometimes we get to look and like how am I going to make the way of nope nope God said I will make an escape I will make a wave Escape for you I don't want to look to other resources God you said it you said in your word I believe it and when the thought comes I take the inside Soldier and I make my tongue speak the word your word said Lord I make my testimony PL public I'll speak the testimony and I'll preach to myself that's what I'm doing tonight preaching to myself I said God is going to make a way I didn't feel like I was going to be able to preach I told Brother David I said and by his grace through faith we'll we'll move forward amen and that's what we're believing for your situations God is the way maker and with the trial he will make Make A Way aren't you grateful for that Comfort we need that Revelation to strike us we want to live in that we want to constantly excuse me honey we want to constantly live where we're striving to keep the Life of Christ in US when the battle gets hot and the enemy's coming in like a flood it's not time to cower and we'll sink back it's time to stand stand on the word of God God you've placed me here you've chosen me for this hour just like Esther in a time just like this you've chosen me you've ordained me I'm going to stand on your word and I'm waiting for the inside Soldier to get activated to come to the front cuz that's what you do you know when you've done all that you can you just stand God is obligated to his word and if you're speaking the word of God believing it with a pure heart you know what God does he says this is faithful this is a faithful statement he said God is faithful who will not suffer for you to be tempted above that you are able I love that that's wonderful to me praise the Lord I don't know where I'm at but you know it's just uh it's wonderful to know that we're in a battle and we're fighting along just only been 20 minutes so I was told I I can make this one short because the last couple ones were long so I don't know if it's I I just realized yeah I'm not the master of these things right God is the master you know and if we're striving and we're walking looking at the Master's Hand if he starts going like this we want to go we want to follow it if he says no no no we want to stop we're not looking to flesh this is not a flesh and blood Affair we want to walk in the spirit we don't want to be looking at the flesh that's not the Warfare we're called to engage in we'll come back to that Lord willing you know in the message how can I overcome brother brandham had mentioned about when he jumped over on that log and that laog gave way and he said this in paragraph 41 he says I was crossing well I I got to back up 37 it says this and now we're speaking of overcoming the the word overcome of course you know what it means it means something to overcome and this church age that the Holy Spirit was speaking about at the latest SE age and was we have just been through needed a rebuking leedan had to be rebuked because it's difference towards Christ it put him it put Christ outside in that are age you know and I don't want to be guilty of that putting Christ and working on the outside of my body like putting them on the outside just to deal with my intellect right if if we let Christ deal with the heart of the matter everything else God works from the inside out so it's not about how many times we attend church and how many times we feed the poor and how many times we spoke in tongues or prayed in the spirit all of those things are okay but is God God Mastery of our heart that's what I want in this battle is to know that I'm sold out and surrendered with everything I got God if you want me to suffer going through this battle and this trial Lord I know you'll make a way but I don't want to Short Change excuse me if that doesn't sound right but I don't want to Short change the work that's God doing on my character because really that's what this Warfare is all about is that the same faith that Jesus Christ he said I do nothing but for the father first show me I only do his will this is my meat to come to do the will of the father that's what the warfare that's Waring the good Warfare you know if we can learn to get out of the way that it can be God doing what he said he would do amen you you know it's he his call now he said notice and that was God's love expression he's knocking trying to come back into his own house but he says he's at the door but now notice this is paragraph 38 his call here is not just the church he that overcome see not just the church that would be she see the church body but now he that overcometh the individual that will overcome now you know and and I think that's that's part of the Warfare you know like we can have fellowships we can have groups we can have socials and different things like that those are fine and good but that cannot be a substitute for what God's asking to do because he's knocking he wants that intimate one-on-one to the individual that will overcome I don't get my confidence I don't get my security I don't get my comfort from our social Gatherings from our fellowships my comfort is in the comforter in the very Spirit of the Living God now we can have that and we can have Fellowship but we want to recognize if I'm in this battle and Christ is on the inside there's something wrong I want to recognize I want to have awareness it's not time to be playing these kind of things in our mind like this is not something that a good soldier does Soldier is not working carnally and if we're lacking this is the age of asking God there's no small and big to God excuse me Lord help us help me 41 he says and I was crossing an Old Log the other day down at wash and I I call it a hollow and holler and I jumped on up on this log on the outside it looked good looked like a big old beach log but when I jumped on it oh a big chunk of it fell off a real rotten and doie I said that's the way Christians are becoming they've been dead dead in sin and trespasses so long till they become doy they can't hold no weight at all they don't know what the overcoming means and I begin to think of this text you know and I'm just I'm saying this is the Warfare that I'm engaged in I this is the kind of thing God I'm examining myself where have I been not bearing the weight that you're asking me to Bear cuz I know that I can it you've given me your promise that you won't give me more to bear and so I want to I want to Bear the weight but but where's the channel what's the what's the issue brother brand overcoming is to keep life in you I said Lord thank you thank you for bringing to my mind bringing into remembrance how to overcome in the Warfare we got to keep life in you and that's what brought me to the log that's what brought the log to that condition see it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch in the water uh where the waters was and then there you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him and the experience and the joy of serving Christ and living in the church where such things go on he Rens twice as quick right living right under so if we're trying to follow the message of the hour at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the Life of Christ see CU if you don't you lay around and to know the things that things these things and your supposed to do and you don't do the Bible says he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him is sin and you're becoming doy rotten when you are separated from the life of God sounds like a bad prescription but he says so strive with all that's in you to stay in the Life of Christ that you should be fruit bearing that's what I want that's what I'm striving for to strive is to fight you know sometimes we think and and it has a negative connotation because you hear the scriptures in other places we hear to strives and Wars amongst you and different things but it also says strive one another try you know we want to provoke one another to love into good works amen like there there is a healthy fighting there is a healthy fighting you know just because you have all of these things that come across your mind that like man I I don't want to think that about my neighbor I don't want to think that about my mom my dad my brother I don't want to think that well that's the thing we need to do brother brandom told us that you know you the farmer couldn't keep the crows from flying over but he gave the farmer double barrel shotgun we could start blasting you know if the enem is constantly pouring it on you with these negative evil thoughts we can take the word of God the Old and New Testament and go to Blas in those thoughts I'm a Son of God I'm in a I'm a chosen to be a good soldier and to war Warfare God has so ordained me to walk in good works this is not something that I chose God spoke it and I'm believe in it and I believe that if you believe it God will bring it to pass so strive with all that's in you to stay in the Life of Christ that you would be fruit bearing I love that so much we see this age that we're living in it's one of the greatest ages of all ages the latest inan Church age is the grandest of all ages because it's it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age more sin in this age than there ever has been more powers of Satan is and many more times harder to fight against than it was in any age I Love You Know The Enemy coming in like a flood but God he's going to raise the standard amen and God has made a way of escape from this judgment that's coming upon this Earth by sending Malachi 4 you know I tell you God has provided a open book test I tell you when you go to a test I when when I was going through grade school and things like that when they said it's an open book test it was like man it was a relief how many like open book test you know all the answers are in the book I mean there ain't no reason not to get a 100 I mean we've already been through these things but now the veil has been taken off and we can see the Messiah he's come he's here [Music] amen you know part of the battle that we're in and just remembering that we're in a battle you know I think um well I'll just read this quote uh whatever he says to you do it 1953 on June 1st brother Brown says if there's no battle then there's no Victory but you've got to have a battle to have Victory if it isn't given to you you wouldn't you wouldn't know would be no Victory there wouldn't be a victory iory but he that overcometh is the one who has the victory so Jesus came to Earth he had a battle he won the Victory and tonight we have a battle and with Christ we have the victory I tell you there's such a peace in that you know when you face the battle you know there's one that already won the battle for us amen he went you know when we were in bondage to this sin nature here when we couldn't overtake the shackles the hooks in our flesh we couldn't we couldn't free ourselves it was too heavy but God provided a way and he is the way he's broken those shackles he's broken those chains you know in part of the battle I believe that as it's a battle for will part of it is to remember and this is out of um God hiding himself in simp ficity but he says I believe this is in paragraph 120 it says it so pleased God to reveal himself and then hide himself and then hide himself and reveal himself in simple little things that's put it over the top of the head of men because he did he did say why would a just God do that is because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to sift for himself a man was made to com to rely completely upon God and that's the reason we are likened to Lambs or sheeps sheeps cannot lead himself he has to have a leader the holy spirit is supposed to lead us so man made so man is made that way and God made all of his works so simple that the simple can understand it and God himself simp simple himself simple with simple with the simple in order to be understood by the simple in other words he said in Isaiah 53 I believe though a fool should not error therein it's so simple and we know that God is so great till we expect it to be so great something and we miss the simple thing we stumble over Simplicity that's how we miss God Is by stumbling over simp Simplicity God is so simple till the scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles because in their intellects they know that there is nothing like him so great but in his Revelation he makes it so simple they go Plum over the top of it and miss it now study that study it all uh well I think that's a part of the armorment part of the the battle is recognizing that man's intellects we stumble at the Simplicity if there's no battle there's no Victory and we've been given like a brother was preaching and the previous weekend we've been given a charge to go out and to take back what the enemy's taken to clear out the land to to to move to drive back you might have been oppressed with some physical malady you might have been oppressed by emotional hurt from your childhood you might have been uh uh you know hey I I'm not very smart I failed in school you might have all of these things worrying against you but that I want to tell you tonight that is not your identity your identity is you're a son or daughter of God and God by his blood has paid the price of redemption if you will receive it and accept it you will become a restored Son of God a restored daughter of God and you can take God's word and you can put it in your heart and you can put it on your lips and you can watch God on Earth moving driving back Demons of Oppression for years physical oppressions emotional scars God can use that as a character and a testimony that can touch somebody else's life that you can actually be a witness that God is still restoring lives no matter what the the the past was a lot of times we've had so much investment in our past we don't want to let it go we want to hold to it because that's part of our identification and the devil has tricked us thinking if we let this go we're not going to be as valuable because it meant so much to us it's been the cause for all of our conflict but I want God to deal with the inside I don't want to make excuses from my flesh I don't want to make no Provisions for the flesh I don't want to have no complex uh my daddy and my mommy my brother my sister my neighbor the church people I don't want to have the the the the problems with in my mind with the pastor or or the Evangelist or whatever I want God to deal on the inside I want to let let go and let God I want to live free because the word of God that is in you it is not bound but we try to depend upon our reasoning the way that we perceive it the way that we see it it's the way it is whoa whoa whoa whoa we walk by F by faith not by sight the battle is to walk by the Unseen I just want to remind myself remind you the bride of Christ you've been given a weapon you take the word of God what God has made known to you by the way of Revelation is so powerful there is something that is the devil doesn't want you to take that and put it in the hands of God by his spirit in a moment go to work every day we Face another battle but every day we have an opportunity for the good soldier to come to the front the Battlefront Allie's just waiting wake wake up wake up Jesus he's on the inside there Lord there's this big waves crashing the storm it's just Relentless he's in the inside of the ship let's go wake Jesus not some power outside of there but the promise is Christ in you amen we want to study that it's God in Simplicity God is actually allowing the difficulties the struggles the trials the burdens all of those is so that God can come on the scene we don't want to run from the battle want to call upon the name of the Lord amen everybody feeling okay well I don't know if I can get to any of this you know I just I'm so thankful that God's chosen us to be good soldiers and you know I know this was quoted and brother said in his title is it too late for the character you know character development and it's going to be the theme of that faith and character is going to be the theme until we leave right because if we don't have the character of Christ to seek the mind of Christ to know what his will is for our life because you know the bride has been it has been spoken over you that the bride has thus sayith the Lord or she keeps still so God has given us thus sayeth the Lord in 66 books he's given us thus sayeth the Lord in over 1,200 sermons he's given you thus sayith the Lord in your personal walk that's harmonized with both and so this theme is going to continually be and it's going to keep coming up because what God is looking for is I believe he's looking for a Perfection a maturing you know to to have the very Life of Christ on display and so the battle now is who are we going to yield our members to you know that's the Warfare that you and I are in right now there's a pool because this flesh is part of the world and it'll return back but God has given us power he says I give you power when you go Terry you will be endued with power from on high let's find and remember that there is a source of our strength in this fight it's the Holy Ghost it's the Life of Christ amen but you know in this battle this is out of the church age book out of the Samaran Church age you know that this is I don't know the paragraph number but I'll just read this he says you know whenever um you read Malachi per uh chapter 1 verses 1 and three the burden of the word of the Lord unto Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayith the Lord yet they say wherein has you loved us has not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob and hated Esau and they laid the mountains and his Heritage waste of the Dragons of the Wilderness you see they couldn't not figure out the love of God and many times you're testifying and you're talking with people they're religious you know and see we want to get to the place where what's inside of us can mature because like when we go to talk with people they can't figure out the love of God right how can a god of love hate it doesn't even make sense but that's why we have to have Revelation right we want to be good soldiers in the fight we're not looking at our flesh because if you start looking too long at your flesh it's going to get you going sideways that's right you know and and I'll just say this too and I I Lord help me say this but you know a lot of time we look in the mirror to see if we got you know Did I Shave right or is my face dirty I was out working whatever we look in the mirror and we're just like you know checking things but you know a lot of times people go and look at these social media things Facebook Instagram Twitter and all those kind of I don't know all the stuff I don't I'm not on it I probably would help my business if I did but but anyway I don't want to get clogged up in that you know one even scientists themselves are stating that what is happening when people go onto those platforms it's subconsciously already programming you when you look at the dress or you look at someone's face or you look at their business or their car or their house all that's it's starting to go on the inside in war against you because now it's getting you to compare yourself one to another the devil is so subtle in this hour we should take guard against the enemy I want to stand against the attacks of the enemy I don't want to compare myself to flesh this thing's changing where I'm going I want to prepare for something that's way better than this there's no sickness there's no sorrow there's no heartache oh what a day that'll be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face well we can do that now when we go into prayer when we go into the word of God we can see the face of God we can see the promises of God I'm for you I'm not against you I love you my love is elective my what a I'm not trying to say anything personal to anybody but I'm saying this is Attack of the devil come in and just say hey just take partake of this partake of that don't worry about any it's not going to hurt you devil you're trying to get into my subconscious you're trying to get me to think on your grounds I ain't playing your games and lay this stuff down that's right you know if you think you got power over those things well you just go to God and ask God for your Revelation cuz for me I I I just don't I know what I've come from and I know the bondage that I was in and it took me way further than I wanted to go and it kept me way longer than I wanted to stay and now I want to stay so far away from it to Shue the very appearance of evil I'm not striving with this flesh so much is I want to keep life in me and I don't want to worry so much I can't I can't do for you if I don't do for me first I got to feed on this word I got to pray up the battle is Raging the devil can pit us one to another and all of a sudden we're looking at flesh and we're comparing where's this coming from the devil I want to wage war against the devil not my brother oh my sister I don't even want to wage war with my own Humanity Christ paid the debt that I owed I'm forgiven God has made a way for me to be free from my ped God has made a way for you whoever is in Christ Jesus you are a new creature all things are passed away you you can fill in the blank if you want to add something to that and say well I got this other thing that you want to hold on to no no no for me all things are passed away and if I didn't remember something God when you bring it to my remembrance I say Lord I'm putting that in the blood I was wrong there too and I was wrong hey this is a progressive thing God is chiseling away he's got a masterpiece and he's got a master's touch he knows what he's doing how he can chisel away at our thinking he wants the mind of Christ to be on display in our very Humanity you see this is the thing though the proof of Love is election no matter what happened his love was proved truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation because God had truly by the fact that he had chosen unto salvation because God had chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose he did not if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is anybody else want to know what his purpose is like I I got to I got to have it I'm a soldier and if I'm just fighting if I'm just going on and I don't know what his purpose is I go in h Lieutenant Captain they're flanking over here they got they got Battlement coming up they got tanks they got Rockets they got satellites they got drones they got this they got that hey I got purpose in all this huh well what's your order I want to know uh speak to me you have the power you have the authority you've got all the atomic power we can wipe them out he says the this his purpose is that after you have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established and strengthened and settled as job said he put his strength in US you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered and being made perfect he has become the author of Eternal salvation unto all that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God will suffer for him while come to a measure of would come to a place of perfection why did he want this James one says my brethren counted all joy when I fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8:17 18 and if children then HS and HS of God and joy HS with Christ if so that we suffer with him we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer the reason for this is character simply not made with without suffering character is a victory not a gift amen a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even in his throne on the same basis that he overcame he sat down on his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him you know if we're in a fight if we have an opponent and you know he's a boxer or whatever we're going to we're going to study his moves his tactics right and we're going to train we got to train we got to build up you know if he's left-handed if he's right-handed whatever so we got to train to see his tactics right but you know whenever you think about it this character is not a gift it's a victory amen and so you got to fight yes sir you know when the when the when the Trials come just remember we're good soldiers we've been ordained this is actually like Peter said consider it all joy you mean this this this evaluation this prognosis I got fir lost a job I don't have the money for the bills you know you know my significant other is you know losing her mind or he I'm losing my mind no that's not it it's just God wanting to impart the character of Christ and it's it's the same way that he overcome through suffering so when we're going through the battle we don't look at oh I'm going through so much I can't handle this no God you promised you'd make a way God I'm not here to bear this alone you said take my yoke upon you I just start quoting the scripture to my flesh when when I was feeling bad I just I've been down this road before and I know this not a flesh and blood deal even though my flesh is weak and I'm whooped on but devil I got something greater than that the word of God brings life that's what I want to struggle for to keep life in me no matter what the struggle is I'm in the fight I'm taking the word of God we're going to fight to get the victory all right 55 minutes we're going to close soon maybe in First Corinthians 9 it says this and I I just think these last scriptures that we'll read I think they're important so Lord help us we'll be done here soon 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 and 27 says know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receive the price so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they that had do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible Crown I therefore so run not as uncertaintly so fight High not as one that beateth the air you know I'm not fighting an opponent where I'm just beating the air but I want to find out where the real opponent is is I keep under my body and bring it in subjection lest by any means I preach to others and I myself be a cast away I'm going to keep my body in subjection to the word amen so I want to strive for the Mastery you know I remember you know this preacher one time was saying you know you you could see the sliver and they're I oh man you see how there you know the high heels just a little bit too high or you know but I'm looking at your sliver and your sliver and then I got this big old Gangplank sticking out of my eyes like I can't even perceive out of that eye because I'm so obscured in my vision I mean why are we judges on each other like that I mean but that's part of the battle excuse me 2 Corinthians 10 2 Corinthians 10 and in uh verses 3-8 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalted s against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every say it with me let's do a little bit better every thought to The Obedience of Christ that's where the battle is so that's what Paul is telling us for we're we're in the flesh but we don't war after the flesh but we're bringing every bringing captive every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled do ye look on the things after the outward appearance If any man trust to himself that he is Christ let him of himself think this again that as he is is Christ even so are we Christ for though I should boast somewhat more of my of the our Authority which the Lord ha given us for edification and not for your destruction I should not be ashamed you know I was listening to some guy and I I just trust the Lord will help me to sh share this in a way that you know you know when we think about character and and the quote was saying that uh Power apart from character is satanic and there was a psychologist in the 60s that uh through um some of his family I don't know if it was his parents or whatever but he was studying and they did this test at Yale and it was called The Milner experience but this man he wanted to see the the nature of man like could this happen like how did they get to where Adolf Hitler and all those people would just just wipe people out you know what what is it about man and so they conducted a survey and they they said hey we'll give you um you know vouchers for lunch or whatever and so they conducted this study at yel and they called it the mgrm experience but there was U people that would sign up and they would come in and they were told that they were going to perform an experiment and there was going to be a teacher there was going to be a student and there was going to be a professor well the professor had a white coat on and they kind of let him know hey we're going to go randomly and you're either going to be the teacher or the student well they were hiding the fact that there was only going to be the teacher they the the the professor and the student were actors right but they were trying to get to see how that people would react under a certain given right a mandate say okay you know what um we're going to do this test and uh we're going to shock we're going to shock you in increments of 15 volts at a time but we're just going to give you uh multiple questions one through four and if if you get this wrong we're going to give you a we going to light you up a little bit and so they're like whoa all right this is just the experiment right and so well they didn't know that all of them got the card for teacher right and so there're they're all getting set up right they didn't know but they're in there and they're they're with the button and it was pre-recorded the response of the student right so they weren't really hitting them but it was was just to ex give an experiment how the nature of mankind how it would be driven when it was given a power when it was driven to give Authority so these these people they they got the Hat of teacher and they're sitting in there with the button and they said okay and and the uh there was a wall and the student was on the other side they couldn't see him they couldn't see the professor professor's in the back and so they said every wrong answer light them up and each time they got a wrong answer light them up again and again and every time you light them up it's getting stronger in 15 15 uh amperages uh more and and once you get shocked at 350 it can kill you but the test was to go up to 450 which was certain death and they found out and I might be butchering this experience cuz I just this study but but anyway I thought it was intriguing because it definitely shows the nature of sin nature in man but anyway they they they they would make and say hey wrong answer boom and you can hear after a while boom boom they they they would get over and the the the professor would be over their shoulder saying hey this is what you're supposed to do hey you know what this is part of the this is part of the um the experiment you got to you got to follow through with it and so the pressure that was put on them they kept caving and kept caving and kept caveen and then it got to a point where it was like at that level and you know the people the psychologists they thought man they got together amongst their people before they did this test and they said how many people would go all the way said maybe one or two and what was crazy is 100% of the people went up to 350 100% of the people and they can hear the people they had it recorded oh I got a heart condition stop I quit and they just because they felt empowered because they felt they had the authority of teacher you know what that that should scare the life out of us from the standpoint of our Humanity I cannot trust my flesh you get me in a position God let it be you living in me this is such a sacred trust that you've given I don't never want to be throwing my weight around my thought around no sir I want to bring every thought captive to Christ I'm just going to have to stop I'm just going to have to stop I had more but you know the spirit is willing and the flesh is weak we must go to God because now and I'll end at this quote because it's in the church age book and it's about Harvest time and I'll say it like this you know we see the world and the the just even to that example how Humanity even with the the shutdown of our world and people giving jobs and they say you six foot get back put on a mask you can't be here there's only 10 people here you know you could see that but what's coming we've already seen like a preview how dark it can get and don't think it's not going to get worse because it is but God has made a way of escape and that's character that's fighting the fight of faith and so as we see all of this stuff that's transpiring on the world we want to remember that in the latest Eden Church age I I I don't have the paragraph number but this will be my last quote and probably take me about five minutes and then uh the musicians can come but it says this in Matthew 13:30 says but let let both grow together until the Harvest and in the Harvest time I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to be burn to burn them but buying the wheat into my barn the wheat and the tears which from the first age till now have grown side by side are Harvest what NAA set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the mighty all the might of organization the false Church turned from any vesage of Truth and with political might reinforces her with State backing and set out to eradicate Forever The True Believer now we're fighting a fight of Faith see we're going to have to have our faith and our ground so solid that we're not banking on anything in our flesh we're not worried about our bank accounts we're not worried about our health we're not worried about our family cuz we already got the promise and the character of us believes it no matter what right we're coming to The Showdown you know I'm not here to scare you I'm here to tell you to lift you up it's time to prepare for battle it's time to go to fighting but just when she is about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat is gathered into the Garner no longer will the wheat in the tear grow side by side no longer will the tears receive the blessings of God because of the presence of the wheat for the wheat will be gone and the wrath of God will be poured out in the Sixth Seal which will end in utter destruction of the wicked now I said a moment ago that the false Vine came into full fruit in this age her fruit would mature and ripen is that correct this evil spirit church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew in the tree into a tree wherein lodged all the fowls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it is must also be true that the bride of Christ will mature her rightness will be in an identification with her Lord by the means of of the word and her head will come to her in the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up the political forces physical forces and demons of Darkness come against the True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts that Jesus did then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that the bride and the bridegroom will be United as one forever well that get me excited I got a purpose for fighting already the visible manifestation of what I've been telling you you are seeing all around us The ecumenical move of the tears is factual but also it is fact that the prophet for the last age must bring forth the message from God that will forerun the second coming of the Lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power God has giv you power to become Sons and Daughters of God God is leading you and guiding you into all truth that's the problem of this hour what critical times are these that we live in how careful we must be that we remain true to his word and not take from it or add to it for he who would speak where God has not spoken makes him a liar what I have particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the h for God I'm I'm sorry I'm going to skip that you can go back and read it but you know it talks about going through the church age and how God was raising up from the tossel and and the seed and the the shuck and the tossel and he was talking about you know in this age when the manifestation of speaking in tongues and different things that was just the shell that wasn't the seed but it was the shell coming up and we'll pick that up he says but but as one can go into the field and look what he's looking exactly like wheat yet it's the husk for the wheat seed is not yet formed so this was but the soft shell that looked like the real grain Yet to Come the original wheat seed of Pentecost was still to come back in the last age it had been buried at NAA it sent up a shoot in Sardis and grew into TOS in Philadelphia and it was matured at Lea but it could not be back to the original until the word was restored the prophet had not yet come upon the scene but now according to the time wherein we stand and L see the prophet messenger of Revelations 10:7 must already be in the Land once more thus sayith the Lord must be here ready to be manifested with infallible Vindication thus it is the true seed already maturing than the Harvest praise God you know we just want to ripen in the presence of the sun you know we're the wheed seed of God we've come and we've listened and we fed on the word of God now we want to be breed on the table let God do in us we we God wants us to engage in the battle that that pure wheat seed now can be bred on the table amen we invite the musicians to come and you know I was I was wanting to go down and as Brother David was talking about um the prayer oh I just love the past weekend sermons I really appreciate the way the Lord's dealing with our pastor and you know thinking about that prayer and how you know when Jesus you know he was going through it you know and and I was going to give get into it in Matthew I went to the the different uh gospels where it talked about when Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane you know and he prayed that intercessory prayer which we went through but then there was another thing that Jesus himself he came to a place in the garden of gethe and I believe brother brandom said I don't know if it was Easter still or where he said it but you know when Jesus agonized you know he said in one place that the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane cuz he had to die as a sinner but you know he came to a place where he bore the sins of your life my life the whole sins of the world and when he came to that place now he's fighting he's coming to his Jordan the death of self and that's what we got to do we got to come to the our Jordan and we got to cross over we can't say oh well my will and God's Will and try to blend it then we got lukewarmness but God he's showing an example and as I was going through you know John it was John Peter and James I believe that was there you know and they were they were you know called to come over there and as he was going to be agonizing and he knew he'd already told him you know hey uh destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up but now he's coming and he had that personal battle like that's what we got to have we got to have a personal battle a reckoning like am I really giving my all my will my ambition my goals my aspiration am I really laying it down have I even considered am I giving my all am I looking to what is your will God for my life and so as you know John I think he was there but when you read it it's like one paragraph and it doesn't even say anything about like the experience so much it just makes statement that they were there but then you go to Luke and you go to Matthew or and Mark but the details m Matthew maybe I'll I'll just read this I'm sorry if to keep you but I thought this was so special and this is maybe where I want to end but in Matthew 26 and Jesus said unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the Shepherd Of A Flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I will go go before you into Galilee and Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended of thee yet I will never be offended Jesus said unto him verily I say unto you that this night before the crow the crows Thou shalt deny me Thrice and Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet I will not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples do you see the the wrestling of will there see Peter he thought you know I will never deny you I will never be offended he's speaking of our Humanity these things are ingrained in our subconscious all never deny the Lord you personalize it how God dealing with you but I know how he did is with me and it makes me want to humble myself and say God if your grace don't come and make this correction I'm just like the next person I'm going to the pit I want to have that attitude it's by your grace that I'm saved through faith when you revealed that this is my Humanity that I'm Waring against God what you said is the truth then cometh Jesus unto to them unto the place called gethe and he said unto his disciples sit ye here while I go pray Yonder and he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death Terry you here watch with me and I will and I went and he went a little further and he fell on his face and he prayed saying oh my father if it's possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou will and he cometh unto his disciples and found them asleep and Sith unto Peter what could you not watch for one hour with me watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak and he went away again the second time and prayed saying oh father if this cup may not pass from me except I drink it thine will be done and he came and found them asleep again and their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time the same words then came he to his disciples and said unto them sleep now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand the son of man is betrayed in the hands of sinners rise let us be going behold he is at hand that betrayeth me you know in Psalms 69 it says this in verse 20 the reproach reproach hath broken my heart and I am full of heaviness I have looked to for some to take pity but there is there was none and for comforters but I found none they gave me also Gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink you know it was such an Agony and I believe he died of a broken heart because he bore those sins and that sweat turned into blood but praise God it pleased the father to bruise him that you and I we can come to the same very Christ and the character of our lovely savior amen is that your heart's desire do you feel lifted up to take courage and fight the fight of Faith to press towards the battle because there's somebody that's loved you and like our Pastor said there's two loves you know when you see the love of God what it did for you there should be a love that reaches back and say God I want to go to the Battlefront for you what you did for me I'm not going to let it go in vain I'm going to stand and fight amen let's raise together if you don't mind and we'll just close with the or we'll turn the service over to our brother Billy you can go ahead and play something [Music] you know how many are thankful that you were chosen to be a good soldier I certainly am thankful you know I put my shoulder to the wheel on a lot of worldly things but ever when I met the maker when I met the master there's something in me that's driving to that Master that Perfection it's attainable Saints God's called us to it amen how many would just want to Bow your heads and you just want to talk it over with the Lord and however he's dealt with you l i i I'm a mortal man I don't know what season of life you're in but I know this is an hour that God is maturing within us the very love and Life of Christ and if you feel like you haven't been in the battle and you've been Doty and you just want to re Reach Out And Touch the Lord and ask him to give you Revelation that you can enter again in the battle with confidence knowing that he fights for us that he's in on the inside of the ship you just want to lift up your hands you say you know I I just believe in my heart I don't have to raise my hand but I'm here to testify that it was by the lifting up of hands that demons fleed that diseases and sicknesses left and I'm here to testify that if you filled to defy gravity and you believe with all your heart that it's you're reaching out to God God is faithful he'll answer back I'm lifting my hands with you let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord we're so good to be a son and daughter of God Lord in this hour lord it's the most evil age of every age but oh God to think that you've restored your word to us Lord and the faith and the power of God can frow freely Lord if we just submit Our Lives to you believe every word Lord and see you oh God manifested in flesh Lord this is the hour Lord that the flesh is being made word father we pray for isav we pray that you'd Grant victory in the hearts of your children tonight so we commit ourselves to you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's sing this song together as we

unchanging go and me to hold something [Music] ET and hold to are changing Hallelujah did you enjoy that tonight amen are you do you feel like you're just ready to go fight you know I don't know I I I'm just ready to go fight you know I feel lifted up you know I feel I feel energized to just go fight you know the you know the prophet talks about this is not a picnic we are on the battlefield we are here to fight we're not here to just you know like is the struggle I think that's one of the things we forget you know take the natural life you you got to feed it and you got to work up and you got to if you decide I'm just going to sleep and not work up you're going to lose life you know what I mean you got to feed that life you got to work up and you got to you know do the things you need to keep that life going and I believe that's what Alberto was telling us there's a Life of Christ inside of us that we need to keep going with it we need to see that life continually manifested but said you know we come in such an age where Christianity is painted you know this micro Christianity you ask this in two minutes you get it and you pray for this God does it oh that's not Christianity you know we we are in for a fight you know what I mean and and and even more so at the end when we get to the end if God is going to produce some characters it's not going to be just by anything there's going to come the fight there going to be where you say like Shadrach mesak and Abed go I'll stay here even if it doesn't do it I'm not going to move that's character right there and and that's what God is looking for at the end character is built to trials and two things and God is bringing out the best out of you where you are focused on one thing and one thing only like Jesus Christ I'm focused on his word and nothing else I'm focused on the father's will coming to pass in my life and nothing else whether I have don't have that means nothing well if you have all the world the the goods of the world and everything and and lose your soul what benefit will that be and God don't want us to be like you know SPO children's well you know father I need this and father no he's going to give you what you have need of he like our our brother said he's not going to tempt you above what you can do but God wants you at the same time to have some characters about you you know we we we get to where God wants us to be those that will take there's a life inside of us not to fight against flesh and blood but to stand up and say I'm not going to move I heard the word of God the word of God made a promise for me I'm going to stay there until that promise come to pass in my life I'm not if if the devil is coming in fact the purpose for the Devil is just to keep you sharp yeah I mean imagine if there was no devil if it was all bound up and everything we were going to be some fat Christians you know not good what would be what would that be the life we have inside of us is as for us to go fight with it you know it the the the buffeting is so we can sharpen up so we can build character so we can have our minds ready so we can be those that are just ready to take and how we going to rule it's that character that's going to be build in us when we sit there when some one when those that will come to be judged will have a character about us that's the same as the character that was in Christ that's what we desire above all the only thing we take out of here is our character and therefore God wants to work on that until we have it the way he wants us to have it amen I surely enjoy that you know I was sitting there as our brother was preaching I said you know I think we need to get the sickest preacher in the Pulpit you know it seems like that's really when you get the best service you know that's really when they get out of the way and they let God do his way you know so next time we need to find who's the sickest and then bring him in the Pulpit I like how God knows how to do things you know praise the Lord amen character building that's what that's the business we are in amen we B we been on need oh Spirit come make us humble oh and we turn our oh
