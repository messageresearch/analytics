Remember the ones that were made this morning. If you came into his house with something on your heart, please make it known to him by the uplifting of your hands and trust that he grants you your heart's desire. We serve a faithful God, saints. He truly loves us and he hears us. We'll ask brother Chris to come and pray for these needs. And the brothers taking the tithes and offerings if they could please come up. [Music] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, truly we thank you for your love, Lord. And we can only love you because you first loved us. Father, your word said, "What manner of love was bestowed upon us that we would be called the sons and daughters of God? That even now we're called sons and daughters of God." Lord, your prophet said the greatest gift that was ever given to mankind was the privilege that we can bow our head, close our eyes, and speak to you. Lord, we do it by faith right now, believing, Lord, that you hear us. Father, you're faithful to your word, Lord. And Father, there's a comfort knowing, Lord, that you watch over us as a father, Lord. Everything that we have need of, Lord, the uplifted hands here this evening, Lord, we just pray that you would move on behalf of everyone, Lord. God, the price has been paid and a promise has been made for everything that we have need of, Lord. We just need revelation, Lord, and faith, Father, to bring it to pass, Lord, of patience. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I pray, God, that for every need that's in here, Lord, every heart that you would drive away the fear, drive away any complex, any unbelief or doubt. But, Father, that you would by the preaching of your word tonight, Lord, let faith be built up in every one of the hearts here this evening, Lord. God, we heard you this morning, Lord. Father, we're just trusting, Lord, that we not be hearers only, but doers, Lord. And I pray that tonight you would chip away from the things, Lord, or chip away these things, Father, that we don't have need of, Lord. And that you would continue to just soften the ground in our hearts, Lord. Father, speak to us. I pray, Lord, that you just take the Lord, the minister tonight, Lord. God, give him the words to every needy heart this evening, Lord. Father, we ask in your name because you said whatsoever we ask in your name that you would do. That you'd grant the desires of our heart, Lord, and that you're faithful. Lord, we just thank you. We ask your blessing upon the tithes and offerings, Lord, that you'd bless them to the furthering of your kingdom, Lord. Father, we just commit the rest of the service to you. In Jesus name we pray.

[Music] That's why we call you upon the sane &gt;&gt; that you may guide everything according to your pleasure. &gt;&gt; Father, bless your servant, brother David, our pastor.

[Music] Fill him with more of your inspiration and or your guidance Lord &gt;&gt; that he may always be at his post of duty. &gt;&gt; Bless every member of this church and come in our midst tonight &gt;&gt; as we commit ourselves this service to you. in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we're still standing, &gt;&gt; uh let's uh uh uh take our Bibles [Music] &gt;&gt; uh in the uh book of Matthew. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5. [Music] It's a very familiar scripture. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5. [Music] &gt;&gt; We'll read just uh the verse 48. Be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect. That's Jesus himself speaking. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus asking us &gt;&gt; to be perfect &gt;&gt; even as our heavenly father is perfect. &gt;&gt; Uh let's again move to Matthew chapter 17 uh 19 &gt;&gt; Matthew 19. We let's start from verse 16. [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh we'll read 16 through uh &gt;&gt; 221. It says, "And behold, one came and said unto him, good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" And he said unto him, why thou calllestth me good? There's only one good. There's only one good. There's none good but one, that is God. But if thou will enter into life, keep the commandment. He said unto him, which Jesus said, thou sh thou, he says, thou shalt do not murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. The young man said unto him, All these things I have I kept from my youth up. What lackth thy what lack thy yet? Jesus said unto him, "If thou will be perfect, go and sell that thou has, give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow me." But when the young man When a young man heard that saying, he was he went away sorrowful. He had a great possessions. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; I believe we're so happy to be gathering the house of God tonight. After the service from the pastor this morning, &gt;&gt; I don't even I found I don't feel worthy to speak tonight. [Music] And I was talking about the things that are happening in the message and how important it is that we return back to the principles. How in order to go forward, we have to come back to the message. We have to come back to the spirit that was in the message and the spirit that was upon the prophet. &gt;&gt; He he spoke about music music and dancing and as he was speaking about those things some came something came into my mind and worship and all those things it's part of the Christianity it's part of A true Christian loves music and love worship. &gt;&gt; But Christian music [Music] always has something sacred about it. [Music] satisfy. &gt;&gt; It's not something that is just there to satisfy the carnal [Music] &gt;&gt; just to to rejoice. &gt;&gt; But it's something it's something that brings us into the presence of God. I was thinking about in the Bible it talks about in the book of 1st Samuel chapter 16 that when Saul was possessed of the evil spirit that that David will come and will pray and harp and that music will cast away the evil spirit. So the true music, Christian music, &gt;&gt; it will cast away demons. But today we have the impression that what we have called Christian music that those that are called Christian musicians [Music] in instead of uh uh uh praying to cast away demons. They actually play in order to cause people to just dance &gt;&gt; or to to to cause the demons to dance it even to the point where music sort of plays in clubs and and and bars. &gt;&gt; It's the same music that's playing in in uh uh uh pagan uh manifestations. We call it Christian music. &gt;&gt; Music &gt;&gt; music of the message. &gt;&gt; It's it's a shame for us. I &gt;&gt; I believe I understand the emotion that our pastor was under this morning. even in music. The Bible tells us in 2 Kings chapter 3 that there was the king of Israel who was Ahab's son who was supposed to go fight the Moabitete and he called Jehoshaphat the king of Judah to go with him. And Joseph had told him, he said, "I can't go with you unless I consult what the word of God says." &gt;&gt; So they went, they went to Elijah the Tishb. And Elisha was completely mad on the king of Israel. He said, "What is it between you and I? Go and follow the gods of your fathers that if it wasn't for Joseph, &gt;&gt; I wouldn't even say a word to you." And as he was m happy, there was a musician who came by [Music] and as the music began to be played, It came that Elisha came down &gt;&gt; and the scripture says that the uncction the spirit of God came upon him says that when a good when a good and decent music is played before the preacher come to the pulpit it causes the anointing to fail. [Music] But today we have the impression that the music instead of bringing the spirit and the anction &gt;&gt; the the music is rather bringing emotions the agitations and sometimes even pride where they sing to elevate the preacher. &gt;&gt; And when it comes to the pulpit and he's already lifted up. &gt;&gt; May God have mercy upon us. &gt;&gt; God placed in my heart &gt;&gt; to speak on a subject to be the living tabernacle of the living God. &gt;&gt; And as I was thinking on that, the the Lord led me to that scripture that we read, be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect. And when I read that scripture, uh my heart went to this other scripture that we read of the rich young ruler and I believe we are rich today in this world. &gt;&gt; We are rich. We have a lot of riches in this world. &gt;&gt; It looks like there's a lot of uh uh vitamins from the world into the message. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said to this young man, &gt;&gt; if you want to be perfect, &gt;&gt; he showed him the way, &gt;&gt; go, &gt;&gt; sell everything that thou has. Sell your unbelief. &gt;&gt; Sell your own way of thinking about the message. &gt;&gt; Sell your own understanding of the message then come and follow me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I believe the best way to come and follow Jesus &gt;&gt; is to listen to the voice of a true messenger of a true prophet. &gt;&gt; And as brother David told us this morning &gt;&gt; if we love him that we continue to listen to that voice. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we all love him tonight. So for 35 minutes, &gt;&gt; I'm going to continue where we left off this morning to paragraph 240 and I won't have any comment to make at the end. I'll let Billy just close it. If you can start from paragraph 132. Oh, how we need today a call back to the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Look, today in our nation needs a call back. &gt;&gt; Going to speak one of these nights if I can. I want I've got an indictment. And I won't wait to get all the preachers together. I want to indict this generation of the blood of Jesus Christ and prove it to you. Now I may get out somewhere to do that. But we'll we'll see if we can have a breakfast some morning just for ministers. And I I want to Lord helping me to show exactly where we're where we're heading the wrong way. &gt;&gt; We got to come back. There's no other way but come back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Look at our nation today. Look what we're trying to do. The very thing that took place in a dark age. Unite church and state together. Look at the you uni union or the the world council of churches. All the churches going into this world council of churches and they think this is the oneness of God because all the churches United brethren man the fundamental churches go into this great one big organization that's because of lacking knowing the word of God &gt;&gt; the prophet spoke at that thing would take place and make an image unto the beast &gt;&gt; and it have power to speak or do you think Amos could stand in a pull pit tonight down here if he was in Phoenix and fail to cry out on that thing. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be that he'd be against us, the brethren. But he'd be against the system that's drawing us away from the word. That would be what he would do. &gt;&gt; How can those men walk together? The Bible said here in your Amos, the Lord said, tell the people, "How can two walk together without they be agreed?" How are we going to take our Pentecostal groups and go into the world council of churches when half of them in there more than have 85 or 95% even deny the virgin birth. &gt;&gt; They deny I guess 99% of them divi the they deny vine divine healing. They deny the principles of the Bible. They deny the speaking with tongues. Only the Pentecostal group alone takes that. And how are we going to unite ourselves with them in a oneness? &gt;&gt; How are we going to be one with them? How are we going to walk with them without being agreed with them? &gt;&gt; How are you going to do it? You'll have to deny the great evangelical beliefs that you have, the fundamental principles of the Bible to walk with them. &gt;&gt; I tell you, God calls an individual. &gt;&gt; He's calling you as an individual. to stay with his word and stay with him. &gt;&gt; How could God walk with them when their own creeds made up by their own worldly wisdom denies word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When a creed accepts a doctrine of a group of man together and denies the word being sold. &gt;&gt; Then you turn God from you. God is holy and God, the Bible says he watches over his word to a vindicate it. &gt;&gt; And how can he a vindicate the word when the word isn't there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we have members instead of children. &gt;&gt; That's we have creed and everybody can. The world is looking for a Superman. They're working for they're looking for something that can let them hold on their Christian profession and live any way they want to. &gt;&gt; The women want to act like Hollywood and still maintain that they got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The preachers want to build the biggest church and do all these things and have deacons and married many times and and they can do these little things and wear these clothes. They call it the liberation of women. You think Amos would stand still for that? &gt;&gt; No. Indeed he wouldn't. &gt;&gt; You think Amos to stand still and meet with the hierarchies and the bishops up there and say, "Brethren, I think you've done a great thing." You'd say, "You bunch of renegades. &gt;&gt; You impostors, &gt;&gt; you deniers of the faith." He'd say the same thing that Micah said that day before those 400 self-style Hebrew prophets &gt;&gt; they said in a number a multitude isn't there safety depends on where you want to apply that scripture I can say Judas went and hung himself and you go do the same thing &gt;&gt; it doesn't apply there and it doesn't apply that in the multitude of counsel there's safety the Catholic church has it on all of you then &gt;&gt; in the word of God, their safety. The Bible said, "The name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The righteous run into it and are safe." And that's the only safe spot I know. &gt;&gt; The prophets always believe that when Abraham died, when when Job died, he placed himself in the promised land, his grave. When Abraham died, he bought a partial land right in the same place. But Job, what did he do? He watched that prophet. He know that was a man of God. And he said, "I know my redeemer liveth. At the last days he'll stand on the earth. Though at the skinworms has destroyed this body, yet my flesh I see God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Abraham knew that. He buried Sarah there. He bought a parcel of land and buried. He himself was buried there. Isaac when he died, he was taken back and buried there. Isaac begott Jacob and Jacob died way down uh in Egypt. But before he died, he called his prophet's son Joseph. And he knowed he was a prophet, spiritual man. Interpret dreams and saw visions is perfectly right each time. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come here, Joseph, my prophet's son. Lay your hand upon this hip that the almighty God touched me years ago and change my name from suppler to a prince with God. &gt;&gt; Lay your hands up here and swear by that God that you'll not bury me down here in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. What difference did it make? That's what they say today. What difference does it make? We get a bunch of people get him to join church and off the streets. You sometime make him a two-fold more child of hell than he was out on the street. &gt;&gt; Right. [Music] does make a difference. &gt;&gt; Joseph when he died, he made mention said, "Someday the Lord God will visit you." He's a prophet. &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord God will visit you and don't you leave my bones down here, but take them up in the promised land." &gt;&gt; Why? He know that the first fruit of the resurrection would come out of the promised land. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Jesus when he died and rose up on Easter morning, the Bible said that many of the saints that slept in the dust rose and come out of the graves and appeared to many. Who was it? Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph. Why? They were in the right place. That's the reason I said it does make a difference. You just don't bury me out here in some Methodist, Baptist, or some other church. Bury me in Jesus. For them that are in Christ, what God brings in. And it does make a difference. It's early enough. &gt;&gt; Don't let somebody tell you because you jarn in church. Amos will never stand still for that. He said the very God that you're saying that you serve. I'd say this in the name of the Lord. The very God that this nation's supposed to represent will destroy this nation. &gt;&gt; He'll destroy these churches. The God of heaven will send down his wrath and judgment and destroy these churches, &gt;&gt; so-called churches, &gt;&gt; remember, you take my word, there's nobody can join the church. &gt;&gt; You join a lodge. &gt;&gt; You don't join a church, you're born in a church. &gt;&gt; You join a Methodist lodge, Baptist lodge, Catholic lodge, Pentecostal lodge, but you're born into the church of the living God. And that's what he's coming after. that church. So we have lodges, not churches. Anything together in that lodge, hypocrites and everything else. But I'll let you know this right now. According to the word, there's not one hypocrite in the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; And nothing there but saints. &gt;&gt; Now, the membership can take you in. And you think, you think Amos wouldn't blast that? He'd shake that thing to its foundation. &gt;&gt; He certainly would. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, when Israel was on its road up into the promised land led by the Holy Ghost, a pillar of fire was before them. A smitten rock followed him. And there come Moy about which was a brethren. Remember, he was part of Israel too. He was part from that Jewish descent because it was Lot's child by his daughter that brought out Moab. And look at Balum their priest come out there and made an altar offered the same kind of sacrifice and just as fundamental as he could be. See, and he had celebrity with him. He had the king. &gt;&gt; He had all the great men, the princes and the unics standing with him. But there was one standing with Moses &gt;&gt; that he didn't see. &gt;&gt; That's who stood with Amos. That's who will stand with every person that'll stand for God in righteousness. &gt;&gt; No matter how much potent monarchs desire doesn't have one thing to do with it, they'll never be able to curse what God has blessed. &gt;&gt; Why? It's a living seed. It's a word of God. It'll grow to its perfection. &gt;&gt; No signs of the living God in the camp. That's looked like that Israel had done wrong down there, but they failed to see that smitten rock and that atonement being made for Israel. And there was a shout of the king in the camp. &gt;&gt; God was with him. Why? He was healing the sick and doing great miracles and signs and wonders. And a pillar of fire hung over him. &gt;&gt; Moses was following a pillar of fire. The children of Israel was following Moses. And they were on the road to the promised land. And there's nothing going to stop them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, could it not be easy repeated today if God could get somebody in his hand, in his control? &gt;&gt; That pillar of fire is still alive. &gt;&gt; He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. The word still lives. &gt;&gt; God sent us an Amos. &gt;&gt; That's it'll stand for truth and right. &gt;&gt; Shake these things. You see, could we What kind of results do you think he would have? Well, he would have a result that he would call all those that God had for ordained to be called. That's who he get. All the fathers give him, he will come. &gt;&gt; Yes. Micah was before Ahab and Ahab hated him. All the ministerial group was against him and they all was inspired too. But their inspiration didn't cope with the word. I suppose maybe Amos hit that same thing when the priest walked out in the street said, "Now wait a minute. What? What? Show me your credentials. What school did you come from? &gt;&gt; What lineage did you come out of? &gt;&gt; Are you a Who made you a priest? You'd say, "God made me one. &gt;&gt; What school are you from?" Jehovah God. &gt;&gt; I have thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; They listen to him. Certainly not. They didn't want to hear that guy. Certainly not. They didn't want. And yet that man might said, "I'm inspired." Well, I belong to the great church of the Pharisees here. Look how God has blessed us. We put golden altars in. We put temples on. We've done all these things and our missionary offering is greater than any of the rest of the churches throughout all Judea. Well, we do all these things here. Our people are great tithe payers and all that. Yet, Micah or Amos stood there and said, "The God that you claim that you're serving is going to destroy you." &gt;&gt; And it happened that way. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not condemning missionary programs. I'm not condemning big churches, but the trouble is people gets your eyes upon that &gt;&gt; and upon off the word and finally it leads you right off into that thing and you find yourself slipping. Come right back to the word. &gt;&gt; Don't get away from it. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we need a crow the wilderness today. Certainly is true. Now certainly other reasons people reason they want to reason. That's the first thing that got a that's what lost the fellowship of the human race is when Satan introduced a program of reasoning against the word being so &gt;&gt; and it sound very logical. Let's just take Satan what he might have said to Eve when God barricaded them in by his word. That's the only thing that God ever did give his people to fortify them from the enemy was the word. &gt;&gt; He never give us a creed. &gt;&gt; He never give us nothing but his word. &gt;&gt; That's all. And God is infinite, omnipotent, unchangeable. &gt;&gt; He cannot change. &gt;&gt; His first program is perfect. &gt;&gt; He never has to alter it. His first decision when man sinned and crossed that great chasm between him and God leaving himself no way back. God full of mercy and grace &gt;&gt; accepted a substitute. Only a God that's full of mercy and grace could do a thing like that. &gt;&gt; He accepted a substitute and that substitute was blood. &gt;&gt; That's the only place that man could ever come in fellowship with God again is under the shed blood. And it's never been any time that man could fellowship to God only by the blood. &gt;&gt; And it's so true &gt;&gt; where he fellowships with God. Now Eve let down the bars. Eve began to reason. Satan said like this. Now you're you don't know. You haven't had any schooling yet. I'm the professor of the seminary out here. His own. And uh I tell you, we've learned some things out there. We learned that God is so good. We learned in our seminary that God is so good. He don't expect you to do all he wrote there. He doesn't expect that. Yeah. But she said the Lord God said, "Ah, she'd have made a good preacher." She stayed on that. &gt;&gt; That's reason she's condemned to be one today. Keep her away from him. &gt;&gt; What would Amos say about that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I wish I could hear him for about five minutes and record his message. I'd put it right on tape and let the whole world hear it. And I could keep quiet about it from then on. Notice, yes, sir, he would condemn him. And notice what she said. Now, Satan said, now he couldn't do that with Eve. You he could do that Adam, but he did with Eve. &gt;&gt; So, he said to Eve. Now, now you know this. He said, you know, surely God's too good to hurt you. God, you surely won't. You know, he's a good God. We hear so much of that today. &gt;&gt; He is a good God, &gt;&gt; but in order to be good, he has to be just also. &gt;&gt; That's what makes him good. &gt;&gt; He's not wishy-washy. &gt;&gt; He's God. &gt;&gt; And now God's too good to do that to you. And he began said, "Well, you'll be wise. You'll have an education. You'll be smart and wise. You'll you'll know things that you don't know." Now, see, she only had to know one thing. That was the word. &gt;&gt; We don't have to have a bachelor of art and a PhD and a LLD and all these other things. Just know God's word. The simplest child they can read, you know. &gt;&gt; But reason, what did they get? What did they get right there? They broke down and Satan know defeated the human race right there. And that's where he's defeated them ever since. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the reason Amos come because popularity and popular opinions and find great uh president or king and brought prosperity of people or sell their life for a mess of beans like Esau. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hurt, but I'm trying to make true. &gt;&gt; You Democrats sold your birthrights not long ago. That's &gt;&gt; right. And I'm not a Republican. I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; Brother, what a disgrace. And had to take a crooked machine to vote it in like that. But that's what the miracle wanted. &gt;&gt; They got it. He usually gives you what you want. God, give me your word. That's what I want. Let me hide thy word in my heart, Lord. I sin not against thee. Oh, others reason. But see, Amos couldn't reason because he was a prophet. Let the word come to him. Now, same as the word today, you must interpret it. Let the Holy Spirit interpret it by vindicating it in your life. That's what was said. What you know Jeremiah said to the to the prophet Hannah. He said, "When that prophet speaks and what he says is manifested, then the prophets know he was right." &gt;&gt; If Amos was here, what do you think he would do? &gt;&gt; He would he would stay with the word. That's what he would do. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? He had tell us that we've been taught off of the foundation of the original word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had tell us that we're far away from the first Pentecostal church. That's what he tell us. Pentecostals &gt;&gt; said, "Now, you had almost 50 years to get yourself in gear and you've never come there yet." Oh, what would he say to denominational personality? What? Oh, if he wouldn't give that, if he wouldn't tear up the churches for their immorals for accepting creeds, joining a church instead of being born into it. Well, if you're born into it, brother, sister, you act different. You You stay with the word. The Holy Spirit's in you. It only feeds on the word. Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word, &gt;&gt; not part of the word, but every word that proceedth from the mouth of God." He being a prophet, he would see this thing in us of Amos was a prophet. Now, I'm going to close in a minute, but I want to make these remarks stick. If I can, I'll say it. And the Holy Spirit has to make it stick. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you something. If he must come here tonight and stood on this platform, if he walked up and down the streets of Phoenix, he would see in us today in our national affair, in our church world. He'd see the very thing that he saw in Samaria, &gt;&gt; given holy over to immorals &gt;&gt; away from the word of God. He'd see a very religious group. They were every one of them Israelites. But he would see an immoral immorality. He'd see he'd see social and immoral decay among the people. He'd see immoral decay among on the nation. He'd see immoral decay from the word. He see adultery in the church. &gt;&gt; I'm not meaning both physical and he see spiritual adultery. how they would be taking the creeds of man out here as man's creeds and accepting them instead of the word. That's committing spiritual adultery against God. &gt;&gt; Revelation 17 says so. &gt;&gt; That the this committed sin because with her abomination she made the earth drink the wine of her wrath. &gt;&gt; Yes, we see it would be allto together different. He had see it the immoral decay. Amos never blamed the government on listen Amos never blame the government and all this scripture &gt;&gt; but he blamed the people for electing such a government. &gt;&gt; Oh I can Are you tired? &gt;&gt; Just hold on just a minute. See &gt;&gt; don't blame your government. The government cannot build a house on a rock that the people votes for sand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The people want it. &gt;&gt; Many times I say things in the pull pit when I know my brethren is sitting out there ministers. Good man. I talk to him, get him in a corner and it's my duty knowing these things to tell my brethren. And I talk to him and say, "Brother Brandon, I know you're right. But my church will walk out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, it's what you want. &gt;&gt; You can. &gt;&gt; It's the people. &gt;&gt; Now, if you think I could start up a building down here on the street and sell the ladies today those old fashion high top lace shoes, they probably got more leather in them than a whole store full has today. One pair has. But if I sold them for 50 cents a pair, I'd starve to death. &gt;&gt; Why? You don't want them. &gt;&gt; If I sold those oldfashioned mother hubard skirts to the women today, you think they'd buy them? Certainly not. &gt;&gt; They want something that they can pour themselves into. Looks like the skin on a wiener. They they just want to be so tight walking down the street about four or five different degrees. pushed in, pushed out, and ran back on a pair of heels or head suck out. That's I don't mean that for joke. &gt;&gt; This is no place to joke. But that's the truth. &gt;&gt; I have not got a good education. That's the only way I can make my word know you know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Now, it's true. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't buy them dresses. The other night on the platform, a little Indian woman come up there. I wanted to shake her little hand up at brother groomer's church here where she had a dress on like my mother wore. I thought, "Well, bless your heart, lady." And the Lord healed her right there before she even got to me. She thought, I I just better keep still. See, just wait till the occasion comes sometime. And there it was. Well, you couldn't sell those dresses. You might sell them to an Indian. And not too many of them. They're getting just about as loose as the rest of them. You got too much television programs and your children getting out some of these modern white school teachers coming in and all this other nonsense. You'd be better off he's back out like setting bull and was long time ago in Africa when we had the colored race there. What do they do? go to other missionaries is reading, writing, and arithmetic when you Well, they they know more about morals and their tribes than you could Christianity could ever bring to them. &gt;&gt; That's right. If any of those women out there, if she in the Zula tribe, if she waits to a certain age to get married and hasn't someone hasn't taken care of her wife, she has to get out of there. She's no more a tribesman. And when she's married, she's tested for her virgin. And if she be found guilty, she has to tell the man that's done them and they're both killed together. Be a lot of killing around here if we had that kind of a setup, don't you think? That's right. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't have enough undertakers to bury the men and women. &gt;&gt; Certainly. &gt;&gt; But you're dead anyhow and don't know it. So that's a trouble. See, but now so much. That's right. Then what do you do? They take them over there and teach them school. Then you find them on the street. They got their own tribal sins. What they had to come in, take the white man's sins. And then they're 10 times more child of hell than it was to start with. &gt;&gt; The only thing they need is Christ to stay where they're right. That's with our American Indian. Anybody I feel sorry for in this nation's Indian sure had a bad deal out of it. I'm not &gt;&gt; I'm just one person. But I'm far. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The Lord ever calls me from the fields of dealing like this and my message is over. He lets me live any longer, I'm going to the Indians. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. My We see what Amos would do when he called out our whole system would be condemned. Certainly not. The government cannot build. My remark was upon a rock that the nation votes for sand. Amen. &gt;&gt; How you going to build your church upon the rock? How will a preacher ever stand in the pull pit and preach the rock and build it upon the fundamentals of the full gospel when his audience, some of his people out there would put him out? &gt;&gt; Now, I blame the preacher for not having the audacity and the spirit of God for just shutting the door and saying, "Getting somebody else to stand for that stuff and not me." Uh, I admire a preacher that would do that. But woe onto that congregation when a anointed man of God tries to bring them the word and then they won't line up with it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; How's he going to have a a church that all the nine gifts operating in it and so forth and then they and that and the church won't even even live decently and morally won't learn their ABCs of the gospel. They say, "If I had a better preacher, well, it's your fault." That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's our nation's fault. Our Americans that we come over here for freedom of religion from what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we go right on back and put into our capital the very thing that we're was come over here to be free from. &gt;&gt; This nation's a whole lot like Israel. They Israel come into Palestine, drove out the occupants and took the land. The first they had some good good man over them. They had David and Solomon, a great man. Finally, after a while, they kept voting in and pushing in and letting in till they got a Ahab down there &gt;&gt; that married a heathen. &gt;&gt; Now, Ahab was a pretty good fellow. He wanted to do right, but he couldn't do right for that woman of his. Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't got nothing against the man I was speaking about a few minutes ago. He might be a good man, but it's that system of that harlot behind him that twist his neck. &gt;&gt; That's the thing he's going to do it. Come in like this as easy as he can like that and flash the whole thing down. Did you know we are we are now our national debt is so great until we're paying on barred money off of taxes that we'll get 14 years from today. &gt;&gt; What's going to happen when this system breaks? Castro, sure I'm against him. He's a communist, &gt;&gt; right? I'm against him. But he done a good thing when he changed the currency and sent the gold back. Bought up the bonds and sent the gold back. We'll have to do that or the one thing stuck in our face that is that the Catholic Church owns the wealth of the world. She's got the money. She's got the gold to buy our bonds back again. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And you think these whiskey dealers, the tobaca dealers and great uh people of the country won't sell out to keep from losing all their business and counterfeiting the currency. They'll go right back and take that money from the Catholic Church. And then she's sold. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't the Bible predict that? &gt;&gt; The wealth of the world. I'm not a politician, neither a smart man. But I thank the Lord I know him. &gt;&gt; And that's right. That's where she's going to lay right there. You watch it. You watch and see if that ain't right. I hope we all live to see it. I don't think we'll have to live too long. But how you going to do? How we going to build a church? How we going to build a nation? How are we going to build a nation upon this? Now, &gt;&gt; what are we going to do about it? Maybe I better shut up. &gt;&gt; Go somewhere else. But you know, I said enough. You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Look what we want. You You see what you want, that's what you get. &gt;&gt; That's your desires. Look at our television programs today. Uncensored. &gt;&gt; Used to be as wrong for our children. We would let them go down in the the city and see the biccopes, the the picture shows. That's right. &gt;&gt; But now the devil turned right right back around and and made it a television and set it in every house. &gt;&gt; That'll be all right. The television's all right if you got the right thing on it. &gt;&gt; Certainly is. But what do you do? It's getting rotten by the hour. &gt;&gt; Using God's name swearing, cursing &gt;&gt; naked women immoral acts &gt;&gt; and poison the mind of these children. So we raised up a bunch of beats. That's right. Hoodlams. &gt;&gt; It's exactly the truth. You might as well look at it. &gt;&gt; Our whole nation is turning to a bunch of hoodlams. &gt;&gt; Any boy walk around with his britches hanging off his hips and head hanging back, his hair hanging down his neck like a Miss Kennedy's waterhead haircut and going around like that as a hoodlm and then called that American. You've fallen from grace. Repent and turn back to God or you'll perish. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we we want to get somebody in here to let us do anything we want to. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the way the churches. They want to elect in a pastor. Not a pastor that'll stand there and beat the gospel to them, but they want somebody to let them stretch themselves in a bathing suit and play bunk hole in the basement and live any way they want to. Television programs of uncensored radio nast. joining church in the world together. No wonder he aimless to scream out against that stuff. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You think the people would receive him when they voting the thing right in &gt;&gt; if the pastor preaches over 20 minutes, the trustee board calls him over into the room and said, "Look at here, pastor. We we didn't bring you here to do something like that. We have 20 minutes program and that's over. Let her go." &gt;&gt; That's right. What he needs to do is kick that bunch of trustees out the door and take the Bible and preach all night like Paul did and see the resurrection of the dead. &gt;&gt; Exactly. They put him out of the building, the street corners. All right. God's with these stones. &gt;&gt; Television uncensored picture shows dirt filth and makes an example. Look at our young kids today. Look at our girls. See little bitty fellas coming from school not over six years old, seven, eight, lighting up cigarettes. &gt;&gt; Why is it they're mammy before him probably done it? &gt;&gt; If he didn't do it then some of the kids are associating with watch who your kids play with &gt;&gt; right some time ago wife knows it. We're sitting at the table and my little Joseph let out a word that would make a drunken sailor ashamed of himself. I turned around. I said, "What's that?" And the mother faded. The little fellow looked innocent. He said, "What's the matter, Dad?" Big tears in his eyes. I said, "Don't you never say a thing like that." He didn't know what it's all about. Come to find out, the kids at school was using that dirty word. &gt;&gt; I said, "Honey, that's of the devil." &gt;&gt; See, there you are. Your kids, it just got into a place, brother, to it's just doggy dog. That's right. &gt;&gt; Such a conglomeration of sin. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; television programs, sin lovers, pleasure lovers. &gt;&gt; Oh my. 20 minutes is long enough. I've got to see the late show. See, hurry up and get this out of here. I got to do this. See, they've done their religion. They went down there and that's enough. But I tell you, a real man or woman that's born of the spirit of God will sit hour after hour drinking in the word of God. Not only that, but when it hits there, it anchors and changes a lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's our people's desires. Our whole setup is corrupted in decay. It's our people's wants. You take a good man. So, like a good man, put him in a family that's a bunch of of pleasure lovers, they leave that man a dog's life. &gt;&gt; Or a good woman ain't the one. Put him in a family that's mixed up. The whole family should surrender to God. &gt;&gt; It's our business to pray to our children are saved. Keep our house in order. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we are something like Israel did made an alliance with their enemies. First, they had to get away from the word before they could do that. &gt;&gt; And it just goes to show how far America has gotten away from the word. You know, you you have to deny the truth before you can believe a lie. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Eve first had to deny God's word before she could take Satan's lie. &gt;&gt; They had to get away from the word then. Same now, letting Rome take over without firing a shot. &gt;&gt; They don't know the word of God about these things. That's what the trouble is. We need a rising of a true prophet. &gt;&gt; Bring us back to the word. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're promised one. &gt;&gt; We're promised that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, indeed. Malachi 4 said he wouldn't need to restore the faith of the people back to them Pentecostal fathers again. Amos knew that Israel's ungodly lovers would someday destroy her. Now, let me say this with reverence. So does a believer today know that the world, this America's ungodly lovers is going to destroy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your love of politics. &gt;&gt; I just let that anchor a minute. &gt;&gt; That'll destroy the nation. &gt;&gt; And your love of the world, not coming up with the word and trying to do what's right will destroy the church. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. I hope that's gone. The church had left. He left his word of life. The whole world stumbles at it like a stumbling block. They do the same thing today. Yes. If Amos would share it, he'd cry against the whole system. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I can surely say that we've received one like Amos in the same time. &gt;&gt; You know, it's amazing because you can only receive this if it came from a prophet. Only a prophet will have this type of eyesight to tell you what's really happening. You know the scripture will say it was by a prophet that Israel was taken out of Egypt and it was by a prophet that Israel was kept. And it's so important that we as believers of the message, we never move away from what the prophet is saying because it's human nature that in every generation even when the word was sent that people will move away from that word because they will take it and mix it with other things and it will take a prophet to come and see the condition and point people right back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I love it. I think we heard it this morning. It said, "Israel, I got you as a little girl that was out on the field. I cleaned you up. I gave you land you never deserved. I gave you food that was not yours. I I I think it's if you go listen to a message, I believe uh um um what is this message? Uh no, not this one. This there's about three or four that he talks about Amos. um uh when somebody's gotten dull of hearing &gt;&gt; amnesia spiritual amnesia and he talks about the same thing saying how did he got us out of all of those things but yet the people that he got out went right back into the things that they were brought out from &gt;&gt; where they were supposed to be led by the word and it was supposed Satan came and introduced reasoning and introduced well there's nothing wrong with this and you know yeah we are Christians they are Christians too we can mix. No, we're not called to mix with the world. &gt;&gt; And and I love that he just made this point and it just touches my heart. It said it's the people that's causing the things to happen. &gt;&gt; So it's not the preacher, it's the people. The preachers preach what people are looking for. &gt;&gt; Now that's another problem we're going to talk. But first is the people. &gt;&gt; And and I want to say this. I was talking about the Paul in the office. It it wouldn't help for somebody to come here day in and day out, talk about how we are predestinated, chosen, elected, and we got the land and still live in sin. &gt;&gt; Still cannot overcome. Still turning in circles. Still don't see the product over any of that. That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, but yet, you know, we jump around. Praise God. I was be in the beginning with him. If you were in the beginning with him, you will manifest something that will show that you were with him. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I need to change the posture. &gt;&gt; But that that's really true. That's it's really our own problem. It he says politics it's what people people elected those those people and they went and they did exactly what those people elected them for. &gt;&gt; People want a watered down religion a gospel that doesn't really cut deep. You know something that even when you are in sin you still feel good about yourself. &gt;&gt; That's not this message. Amen. &gt;&gt; You if you are in sin, you should feel terrible. &gt;&gt; If you living in sin, you should feel terrible. We can't come and and and and and you know, pet you up and says, "Oh, you are fine. You No, you need to get out of that and be saved." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's what our pastor is trying. I It's not It's just a hard to see what what we have received. One that can remember the prophet is one that can see before we can get to the corner. He can see a far off and he can see the condition and warn you and say don't go in that direction. &gt;&gt; If you see what people have made of this message, things that are happening in the name of the message, all kinds of thing you're like this cannot be what the prophet preached. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You you couldn't tell a believer from an a an unbeliever today. &gt;&gt; The the churches, you couldn't take a picture of a message church and take a picture of a Pentecostal church and tell them apart. &gt;&gt; It's what people wanted. &gt;&gt; They wanted a king. They wanted someone when Moses took too long. They wanted something that they could worship, something that they can contribute, something that they felt they part of. and and all of that. And I want to say this, even as a preacher, it's very important that we don't do this for the people. It's important that everyone, preachers, believers, everybody, we are behind what the prophet said. I love what our pastor said. What I love, one of the things I love about brother David is I can bring a quote, I can bring and say, look at the prophet and we are in agreement. &gt;&gt; He loved it. When you show him, oh, look at what the prophet say here. Why? Because we are all guided by one thing and that's the message at the hour. There's no big guy, no little you. We all trying to make it to the kingdom. &gt;&gt; But oh my, Satan just knows how to slip in. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; God loves you. He's not I mean, he didn't predestinate you so he can lose you. That means stay in sin. &gt;&gt; That's not the message of the hour. predestination is got to come into manifestation. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, this is not said so we can go, well, oh, I need to go throw out my television and do this. Yeah, you need to go do that first, but most of all, you need the new birth into your heart. That's where it start. You will throw that television, you will buy another one. But if you really have a true conversion in your heart, what the word speaks and it speaks to your heart, then when you kick it out, you won't put it back in. Why? Because there's been a change. &gt;&gt; That's the way forward. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I don't want in my heart there be any semblance of sin or something that loves and I want when I see sin, my head turned. I want when I see this, I want to have that same kind of just love for the love of God, for the word of God that the believers in the beginning had. Let me say that has never changed. &gt;&gt; They sold everything so they can follow the word. &gt;&gt; Now we take the word, we mix it up with other things. We take, we mix it up. We take, we mix it up. We are I mean we are all predestinated so it won't matter. They were predestinated for the promised land, but only two made it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't God. God God couldn't get them out of Egypt with with with not enough provision for them to desire or to get to a place where something that they needed to get to the promised land was lived in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; God provided the prophet. He provided the pillar of fire. He provided everything that they needed on the way to the promised land. But guess what? In their hearts, they still desired the things of the world. &gt;&gt; They still desire some of the things that we need. I couldn't even believe how they were whitewashing it to say, "Oh, the onions." They forgot that they were dying there. &gt;&gt; They forgot that they the one that cried out for God to take him out. &gt;&gt; If we not careful, we'll find ourselves in the same situation. Oh, God is getting me out of sin. But you know, I just love that tune. You know, that music, it just attract my ear. And and it's just this. No, we need to be a people separated, &gt;&gt; separated from the world, &gt;&gt; if it's of the world, we don't want nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; And it's with that kind of heart, that's when God can speak to us. Back to the word, back to drinking. When we drink of the word, we become the word. When we eat the word, we become. The only time we hear it cannot be when somebody else is playing. We And I was fellowshipping with the brother. I said, "You here is where and I I look even in my own last. I said this is where we fell short." The the the importance of eating and drinking the message is that the more you eat of it, the more you drink of it, your language will change. Your mind will change. Your approach will change. Your view will change. &gt;&gt; You will speak it's the message come out. You will think it's the message come out. But if you're not in it, how is it going to come out? &gt;&gt; Only humanity, flesh will come out. But it's not done so we can say oh this is no it's because whatever you expose yourself to you become that. &gt;&gt; Have you ever talked to somebody I mean all they talk it's just two seconds before even the sentence formulation. Why is it? Because they are so much into it that they've become the very thing and that's the heart's the desire. We could say like David, I want to look at you until I become even like you. And I want to say this, it's not an easy road. I think we've painted it like a rosy road where you just glide and you're going to get to the finish line. No, it's a daily battle to separate. It's a daily battle, Lord. I don't want this. I don't want that. It's a daily decision making to walk away from the things of It's every day. Lord, I don't want to make a bad choice. I don't want to I made one yesterday that was not good. I'm separating myself today. You have to constantly guard your heart &gt;&gt; because says what? The devil has got that punch coming. But how are you going to be protected if there's no word in it? &gt;&gt; And I really think it's that it's we we getting to where the the the way to destruction is getting bigger and bigger &gt;&gt; and many are being swallowed up in the name of the message. You you you should see even some of those meetings that brother David is referring to and you look at it you say I don't recognize this over anything of the message. &gt;&gt; You couldn't take that and and play a tape in such environment. It wouldn't mix. &gt;&gt; But we call it the message. &gt;&gt; The word is preached. Even I believe what our pastor was saying this morning. The word is preached. And the next guy who comes up and say, "Now we're going to turn to dancing." &gt;&gt; No, no conviction that the word just went forth, God, let the word that was spoken in my heart and let it produce what you really want out of my life. Let me be what I just heard, Lord. Let it let it change my life. Let the part of me that's still not of you, let it be change. No. Right after that, it's a tune out. It's a different channel. And I want to say this, if the word of God has no effect upon your heart, you better watch out &gt;&gt; because it's the only form of transformation that's provided to the believer is that you hear the word change come. You hear the word change come. If you tune it out, if you are not in that channel of the it's music is not going to change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. entertainment is going to not change you. It's only one provided way to the change and that is you hear the word. Remember the prophet said the Holy Spirit is there to only vindicate the word. &gt;&gt; Not your thinking, not your ideas, not what you think the word is supposed to be. No, only what the messenger spoke. Only what God has given. &gt;&gt; You go outside of that. You go on your own. &gt;&gt; That's right. is not respect of persons. &gt;&gt; It's only respect of one thing. And if we claim we have the message, it has to produce the same thing that it produced on the day of Pentecost. And that is life that are changed. &gt;&gt; And I'm not speaking this in I'm looking even to my own self. We can't claim. We have so much knowledge but very little reality of life. &gt;&gt; But we can't keep walking that way. We have to stand up and do our own examination and say, "Lord, where am I? &gt;&gt; What's happening within my own life? I I have heard and I've heard. I've heard I've heard. I want transformation. I want somehow what's spoken and what I see to match. &gt;&gt; Somewhere they got to match. And that's where I need to be. Wherever that is, I want to get there so I can see the transformation." &gt;&gt; If the musician could come. Sorry, I didn't just speaking for my own heart and because that's really what we can and I think even the comment that was made about clapping, it's not it's because if you use it just as a form of disconnecting with what's spoken, &gt;&gt; it's not going to help you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not in malice. It's it's it's almost a form of okay, you disconnecting with what's about. No. When the word is preached, what comes after is actually true worship is you saying, "Oh Lord, I just heard your word. I want what I just heard to change my heart right now." So we need it's a deepest of sincerity that continues. It's not a cut off so we can now do something else. No, it's the continuation of what we just heard. So he can really touch our heart and change us because the Holy Spirit that just spoke through the pastor, he now has to come and make that word true. It's not you making the word true. It's him making the word true. All we need to do is just willing vessel believers and say, "Lord, if it cuts me, I want to take it. If it bruises me, I want to take it because I know one thing that I cannot make it by myself. You have to do it. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you don't do it, I'm lost." &gt;&gt; Let me say this. People don't realize that without the prophet they are lost. They think they got something to do that they can make or interpret what the prophet say and make it to the end. They are no other interpretation except what Amos spoke. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's the only voice and he's the only one who's the interpreter of the divine word of God. And it's only when we walk by what he spoke that's how we're going to make it. Let's all stand. &gt;&gt; May I just want each one and personally and to just look within our heart and say Lord what is it that we really want? Let me say this and even time many times we say the heart the scripture says the heart is a very deceitful thing. &gt;&gt; You got to line up your heart with the word of God. You don't just don't want any kind of heart or or just something that will just tinkle the heart. Oh, it makes me feel good. No, I want my heart what I call to be my heart to be in line with the word of God. Not just something that will cause me to or or either cry. There's nothing wrong with that. That will cause me to be happy. There's nothing wrong with that. But is it in line with what he has spoken? If it is, then that's the kind of heart I want. If that's not the kind of heart in me, then God, take that heart out of me. You said you will take this stony heart out. You said you will give me a heart of flesh. You said you will give me a new spirit. And then you promise on top of that you will put your Holy Spirit into my spirit. That's what I desire. Then that way I'm in line with what you said. You speak it, I believe it, and it produces the result. That's the kind of Christianity we want. Not one that's babyed and you know oh you know just go it's the original kind of believers those that walk with God. We're fellowshipping with brother Mike yesterday we all you know but David came around here how that it's so important but one of them said he said even the experiences of yesterday it's not good enough. [Music] &gt;&gt; You have to have a brand new experience every day with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't, oh I when I was saved, it was like this. If what was back then is different from what's today. If it's no more today, then there's something wrong. When you advance, it gets better. When you advance, it gets deeper. When you advance, it changes you more and more. We don't want to go back. We want to go forward. &gt;&gt; And the only way forward is more of him and less of us. But it won't happen if the people don't want it. &gt;&gt; It won't happen if people want something else. That really struck me tonight. I I'll be honest. It won't happen if our hearts are on something else that's not the word of God. It won't happen if we just strolling into the morning and say, "Preacher, make me happy. It won't happen if the desire is just well I have my hour and a half to come to church and go home. It will only happen if we come together and say Lord what do you have in store for us today? Lord we are here for you. We can say like Peter said and neon say Lord I have no idea what you're saying but one thing I know you have the words of eternal life. You are the way. You are the truth and you are the life. When you speak, you speak life. Therefore, I will take even if it cuts me open. Let me say this. We don't want to just scroll in and you know, you know, you know how people go, oh, I'm offended. Offended by what? If the word speaks, it will offend. It's for the good of us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [Music] Only a child of God can take correction. &gt;&gt; One who's not a child, you know, they feel like they've got it, you know, they've got it all made and I speak with God directly. If you speak to God directly and it's contrary to the message, you don't even speak to him. You're speaking to somebody else. &gt;&gt; I better stop. Let's just examine ourselves and tell, "Oh, Lord, what's in my heart? &gt;&gt; If what's in my heart is not yours, take it out, Lord. I I I what whatever it takes, Lord, I want to be there. I want that love to be in my heart, the love for your word and the love, whatever it takes, if it's to break me apart, if it's to tear me into limbs, but I know that once you've done doing what you're doing, you've made me into what you want me to be. I don't want to be a stuff up and intellectual believers that just here and my heads gets keep getting bigger and the like there's no life in me. No, I want whatever you want for me to change me until I become in that very image. And I know it's not an easy road, but whatever you have chosen, that's what I desire. Let's just sing that and hallelujah. Oh, glorious victory. Oh, I've he willing and even my heart. Oh, his favorite with my life is no longer [Music] of the Lord. [Music] Oh, [Music] hallelujah. Oh, I am [Music] I can see who I am. Oh, a part of his word. Oh, and it's forever [Music] who I am. Oh, [Music] enter it in his heart. We thank you king. Oh, he came my savior. This is God's great sweet of love expressed to me. Oh, I [Music] am I am [Music] I can't see. Oh my part of my sior part of his word into revelation of who I am. Hallelujah. Why don't you just take a minute and speak to him and just yourself from your own language, from your own mouth and just say, "Lord, what we heard this morning and what we heard tonight, Father, we desire to become that church and that perfect church. Even as our brother said, let us move on to perfection, Lord. Perfection is yourself, Lord. And if you called us to be a bride, we need to move into that mature manifestation and leave everything else behind." and and Father, we desire to be that in every aspect of our lives. And and Father, we don't want to carry an 11 or anything that would produce something that's not that's not what you called. And let the devil introduce things that are not of you. But father, we've received a vindicated prophet who showed us the way and that we can take the way of a true prophet and that is to remain with the word of God and to stay with the word and preach the word because the only thing that will produce the results that God is looking for is the true word of God that we may remove everything that's not of us and anything that's not of you, anything that's human and anything that's human understanding, human leadership, human works And father that we may be committed to your word 100% and that it will produce what you want us to produce Lord. And father that the things of the world father even as they come against us that we may look away to you Lord and not let those things influence us and even when we are influenced that we would go back to the word and remove of all of those things that are not of you and let the pure word of God be manifested in our lives. Father, that's what we desire tonight. And we pray that you just lifted our heart, oh God, and look at our heart and help us, Lord, and where we have fallen short, Father. That we'll be those that could actually be corrected when we hear, Lord. That there will be those that will look deep and and Father, to know the message until we become the very message, oh God. that we may father look to you and and let the word of God every part of it father even as your prophet say this morning that he would look a section and say oh this is not that important every word of that you have spoken is important every tit every bit of it is important why because it all ends up into what you want us to be but he's always there oh the father trying to keep our attention to something else and remove and to water down and to do all of that. But we desire tonight, Lord, that we may receive the fullness of who you are, the fullness of what you have spoken, Father, that we may not let down our bars. It don't matter what it is. And that we may stand firm and stand at the gate, Lord, to face the enemy with the full word of God within our hands. We ask this, Lord. This is our heart. And we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Key of F. Amen. Oh, and the fire [Music] real and walking holy and upright. Keep the flag. I want to keep that flag flying high with a mighty living. [Music] Oh, and the fire and the Oh, and a real true life. Oh, and a walking glory. [Music] Oh, keep the flag. Oh, I find Oh, by me. Oh, help me sing that first. Oh, in this world of compromise standing in the making to our moral accord whereby in the midst of all the sin all we have heard deep within God wants display. No matter what the call. Oh, and I know I'm the final re. Oh, I'm walking home. [Music] Oh, keep the flag. Oh, keep the flag of my heart. Nobody living clean and undefiled. And when we walk down the street and the people that we meet, we see we keep the sword of we temptation drawing near. Let's run to the evil snakes for our bodies of the temple of the glorified. [Music] Hallelujah. I want to walk holy and walk in the flesh. Oh, keep the flag on fire. Halleluah. Oh, and the father. Oh, and the final re and walk in. Walk the flag. Oh, keep the flag of my hand. Oh my go. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Tim, if you could just come and dismiss us tonight. Amen. Amen. Don't you just love Sunday nights? Amen. I think it's wonderful. We get prepared and let it just soak in. Sometimes we don't reflect on it. When the word comes hard, comes fast. We just let the the water run off. But let's take the time and meditate on what's been said. I don't know how it works. But I was reading Amos this morning before church started. I started out in Isaiah. I think we ought to be fortified by the word of God. &gt;&gt; And I was reading and refreshing just memory skills or whatever you benefit from the word of God. Isaiah 42:9 says, "Behold, the former things have come to pass. New things do do I declare. Before they spring forth, I tell you of them." So immediately I reflect on Amos 3:7. It says, "Surely the Lord God would do nothing except it reveals to his servants the prophets." So then you start reading back ahead of that. Can two walk together unless they be agreed? You continue on. And I received it as a warning. Amos says, "Shall the trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Davis told us this morning, you'll be judged by what he spoke this morning. We know we'd be judged by the prophet's message, but these minister brethrens, they're representatives of that same message. &gt;&gt; If we had the reverence to realize every time we come in these doors, we know we can't leave the same person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Judgment begins at the house of God. &gt;&gt; This is a chance to make it right. There's a tenderness, a reverence we need to have. And let me say this, that's what brother Billy says. Let me say this. You could have a satchel full, a suitcase full of $100 bills, and if they're counterfeit, and you have one genuine dollar, I'm talking the George Washington little piece of paper, just the one simple dollar, it exceeds the value of that entire suitcase. Yes, &gt;&gt; there are real true message believers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I believe I'm in the presence of a bunch of them. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Our gracious and kind heavenly father. Lord, we do thank you for the revealed truth, the word of the Lord that keeps us right in the center of the road. Lord, we thank you for God called men that are willing to stand, Lord, with no reputation that they're desiring to be built up, Lord, in the eyes of man, but in tenderness and behind closed doors, Lord, that are willing to give themselves over to study and and have you reveal your word to them, Lord, through this message of the hour. Bring it in truth, Lord. We appreciate it. We rely on it and that's what we come here for. Lord, we ask you just continue to build us up in your word, Lord. Strength, strengthen us, Lord. May we not slip, but if we slip, Lord, may we find the right traction, Lord, to get back in line to get back with the the truth, Lord. Lord, if it cuts, if it pounds us, if it beats us, Lord, it's just like a a chef preparing a piece of meat and wanting it to soak in and marinate. May it the flavor be better. Lord, sometimes you have to mar it. Sometimes you have to cut it, beat it on the counter, whatever it takes. Lord, we want to be seasoned just right. &gt;&gt; Grant it to us, Lord, as we go from here that Lord, we just meditate on these things. And Lord, we just come up a little higher. And Lord, we're going down the road because we can't just stall out and be left behind. We have to be moving on. We're the bride of Christ that's that's headed somewhere, Lord. And we're following those bloody footsteps. We pray, Lord, that we just all be in one mind and one accord as we go from here. Lord, may your presence just continue to be with us, be with our families, our loved ones, Lord, and truthfully, the the entire body of Christ tonight, Lord. We lift them up and ask you to strengthen them as a whole, Lord. And Lord, we trust and believe that you're more than able to do these things. We ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] Amen. Let's just sing that as our dismiss tonight. Will and he became sin who knew no sin that we might become his righteousness. [Music] He humbled himself and carried it across. Oh, and love so amazing. [Music] Oh, and love so amazing. [Music] Oh, Jesus Messiah. Oh, the name of our king. Oh blessed redeemer. Oh mighty manuel [Music] the rescue for sinner.
