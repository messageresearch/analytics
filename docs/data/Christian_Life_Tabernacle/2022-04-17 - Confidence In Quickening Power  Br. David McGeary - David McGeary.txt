Description:
Confidence In Quickening Power
Br. David McGeary
April 17, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

thinking about you amen brother tim salafi could just come and open our service in prayer a beautiful day to come together i realized there's many of us uh out still at camp we just prayed their blessings and coming on in this evening let's just go to the lord in prayer [Music] gracious and kind heavenly father [Music] what a day and what an hour lord to be able to come together recognize even the variability that we're able to come together lord is because there's an empty tomb there's a resurrection [Music] you think of mary magdalene lord your words recorded said she came early to the sepulcher while it was yet dark and found the stone rolled away [Music] lord she ran to get your disciples they came back and or they looked in you weren't to be found [Music] but lord you're worthy of a second look [Music] we're here again lord to find you lord you're not even in this sepulchre it's just a building the lord has been set aside and sanctified for the worship for the praise and honor and glory of god but now lord that we inhabit these spaces lord your your chosen elected people lord by way of promise you said you'd be here amongst us lord you revealed yourself to mary [Music] and you called her by name lord was at that bidding that she recognized you [Music] she supposed you might be a gardener or someone attending the sepulcher the lord you called her may we recognize each one of us lord your continued calling you're wooing you're drawing lord we we all have a desire to come up closer but lord let's look again let's hear the call and draw us closer to you lord we pray lord just be with us this day as we realize that through the fall lord you said every sickness every disease every siren every ambulance came from that disregarding of your your word lord but lord the the redemption the salvation the blessings the healing it all comes from the benefits of the cross of calvary the work that you've done you said is finished that's what we claim this morning lord and we are redeemable lord we thank you for that lord as we lift up these songs of praise and worship we pray that you just come down in a great and mighty way lord that if there's any sick or needy here this morning lord they can be tended to as only you can we honor you we praise you and we lift up your name bless us and keep us now in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] amen good to be gathered in the house of god son you want to welcome all everyone and all our visitors man we have many out and prayed it the lord will bring them back safe as they'll be traveling back home we'll invite very much for so i'm reading this morning god bless you good morning and we're going to continue to read in psalm 119 this morning we're going to begin at verse 17. i don't know about you but i'm really enjoying going through this chapter you know spending time on it you know certainly i hope you don't you know take out of this the things that i get out of it i hope you're spending time on your own just reading the wonderful things that are in here concerning a relationship with the word and you know as we read the portion this morning there's one particular verse that caught my attention that's verse 18 it says open thou mine eyes but i may behold wondrous things out of thy law you know what struck me as david was speaking of this that this is before the days of jesus this is you know a time when the law the tabernacle the priesthood were all were all kind of the it was that it was that day but yet here's david he's not a priest he's not a member of the ministry but in his psalm as he's describing his fellowship with the word his prayer is open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law you know he recognized that the wondrous things could only be seen if his eyes were opened amen you know notice he didn't say open thou thy law he said open thou mine eyes you see it wasn't the law that needed opening it was his eyes that needed opening we all familiar with the time when jesus was speaking with his disciples he said in luke 10 23 blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them more familiar might be matthew 13 16 where he said but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear you know jesus entire ministry was examples where he would speak the word the same word and two different people will have two different reactions to it some would see what he was saying some would be offended by it some would see the wondrous things out of the law and some would just take offense and it was the same word the difference was not the word it was the eyes whether they were open or not open first corinthians 2 9 says this but it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him wondrous things but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things the wondrous things of god you can keep reading first corinthians to encourage you to do that it's all about the wondrous things that are in thy law but you see it takes someone to open your eyes to be able to see the wondrous things you know notice it says in verse 18 of psalm 119 it does it says open thou mine eyes not our eyes not the people's eyes my eyes his personal opening you know we certainly spend a lot of time in fellowship around the work that was done in our day where there was one who came and through that ministry things were loosed things were made known things were opened up but it doesn't take away from the fact that you still need your personal eye open otherwise it's second hand revelation otherwise i'm just hearing it i'm understanding it i'm agreeing with it but if your eyes haven't been opened it says open thou mine eyes my own that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law not a priest not a minister just david right but it requires you to encounter the opener you know and it's interesting we know from scripture you know man can open this book but only he can open the eyes and that's one of his attributes he's an opener there are things that only he can open it says in isaiah 22 22 in the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open there's only he's the only opener that there is you have to know the opener for him to open your eyes he's always been an opener he opened many wombs that were shut in scripture he opened blinded eyes that people might see you know paul prayed in colossians 4 3 that god would open a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ he has to open up your mouth open your mouth and i will fill it he opens graves he opened a tomb one day 2000 years ago and from that opened away that we might enter he's the opener so unless you encounter the opener your eyes can't be opened to the wondrous things aren't you grateful for the opener that there's one who can open the eyes and my prayer and i hope your prayer as well is open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law so you know as we read this portion of psalm 119 this morning you know that should be our daily prayer that our daily walk that there's an opener that's opening our eyes to the wondrous things let's read that together starting in verse 17 deal bountifully with thy servant that i may live and keep thy word open thou mine eyes that i may behold wondrous things out of thy law i am a stranger in the earth hide not thy commandments from me my soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed which do air from thy commandments removed from me reproach and contempt for i have kept thy testimonies princes also did sit and speak against me but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes thy testimonies also are my delight in my counselors amen amen god bless you may have your seats oh yes i spent in canada [Music] for me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] today oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] his friends [Music] oh [Music] oh when pains death [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] my [Music] is [Music] oh

second timothy the 21st first through the 24th verse if a man therefore purge himself of these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meant for the master's use and prepared unto every good work flee also youthful us but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do generate strife and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient amen so that's those requests i'm sure is what he wants for his family as his family family's growing

jesus for what you've done for us in jesus name we pray amen amen our gracious father once again we bring our little sister father and she's now been dedicated to father she's a part of the body lord

pray amen amen amen god bless you thank you hallelujah amen thank you musicians amen we certainly uh love the word of the lord and and uh i'm i'm not going to minister too long but there's a little something that i felt to do this morning and yeah and you don't know the challenge every time that you feel led to do something there's so many voices in so many things that come against you you know but you you just got to trust the lord amen and in all my life i i find that that's the hardest thing for me personally to do you know i'm a fighter by nature you know i like to fight uh it's just in me i guess it's because i'm irish you know what i mean i i will fight for a believer i will stand in the corner shoulder to shoulder and fight and in doing that sometimes you you go about things and and you try to help god and it's hard to really come to the place to realize that god don't need your help amen that it's not what i've done for him it's what he's done for me and that's our testimony and and this is a great day for us because of it being easter because this is really the day that lets us realize what god has really done for us and you got to remember every single one of us in here received the curse when we were born and you know what that curse was right it didn't matter how much money you had it didn't matter how much health you had it doesn't matter how much how much fame you gained there was one thing waiting for you and that was death and then all your life then went to maybe a plaque or maybe a statue or maybe a line in an obituary it and all the sum and substance of your life all of a sudden became history there was really no more presence of your life in this world just think of it you were gone and the last words that are spoken over you are ashes to ashes and dust to dust in other words you can't you you came out of the dust you've gone back to the dust and so our last memory is saying goodbye we have the history of your life but now you're a pile of dirt oh wow isn't that just the way you want to end your life and to so many that's the end of life to so many if that that that's the the final thing of it your life has been written your story has been wrote you've done what you've done and many times a a young person is is taken from us god does that uh he allows people to to depart from this world uh from every age and and every time of life some old and some very young i've had to stand over babies and and that have passed and and stand in the graveyard and lay a child that's just a few months old into the ground and and all that can be spoken of is what could have been oh what potential this young man had he was he was so uh uh intelligent he was so smart he was so vibrant he was so wonderful and and all that can be spoken of is the things that he might have been or what could have been or or maybe even that could go as far as what should have been or or talk about the plans that they had but when it all was said and done it was done his life was done he didn't have another day he wasn't going to have another hour he wasn't going to have another sentence written about him that his history had now been uh embedded in the in the end loads of time until this morning hallelujah amen this morning was a gift to us that our story's not over amen that there's more after this in fact there's more after this than there was before this amen so paul wrote it this way oh death where's your sting oh grave where's your victory i've ran a good fight now i'm going to get the reward that waits for me this is the most changing event in our lives or it should be it should be because this changes everything this day changed everything this was the day that the curse of death was broken amen whoever believeth on me shall not perish but shall have eternal life oh that is something i wish that i could come to the full revelation of is that that if this earthly body be dissolved i have one waiting for me that just right over the edge of this realm of time is really the beginning of my existence this is just a small time period here this morning that god has placed us in a circumstance and a situation where he can reveal himself to us so let's once again let's stand and open our bibles to romans the 8th chapter and we'll once again read this great verse and we'll start at the sixth verse and read through he says for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is an enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but you are not in the flesh ye are in the spirit for if ye be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his so we see the importance of this spirit he says and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you amen let's just turn over and read a few paragraphs in in luke the last chapter of the gospel of luke luke 24. any and and luke the 24th chapter and the 44th verse the 44th verse of luke 24 and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you well i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me amen then open heat their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves christ to suffer and to raise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold i send you the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high god bless you you may be seated easter is such a a beautiful day because though in jesus's ministry they watched him do signs and wonders and signs and wonders over and over again and they knew that no man could do these works unless the father be with them so they understood that there was something about this uh this man that was different but i don't think they really realized what the real difference was they have stories of david slaying goliath they have stories of samson pulling down the pillars they have stories of joshua defeating thousands and thousands of philistines they have many testimonies down to the time they have the testimonies of moses and all the great works that moses done so they they knew that there was something about him that was different and and even the pharisees and the scribes would come to him at night and they would say rabbi we know no man could do these things unless god be with them but you know there was something greater that he possessed and and so they knew that he had this record they knew that he uh was doing great signs and wonders it wasn't like today where if he would heal somebody that instantly it would show up on some sort of media it was always meant by testimony because god chose the foolishness of preaching to spread the gospel he chose that man would speak one to another that it would be transferred by from faith to faith and that was the the great uh reality of it because every time somebody went up with the testimony the person that heard it was meant with the challenge of whether to believe or not could you imagine the the little blind boy that one of my favorite places in the bible is the young blind lad that received this site and he's arguing with the pharisees and the sadducees and the scribes on who had the authority to do this who had the power to open your eyes he says you are the leaders of israel and you know not by what this is done how can i have any confidence in you explain by what means what what authority he says i don't know he says but one thing i do know i was blind but now i see and the scripture said there is no record ever of a person being born blind that has received their sight just think of it there they were and this man was testifying and so they went and got his parents why because they were they were held captive by unbelief just think of it the fear and the captivity of unbelief was so strong and they were so rooted in their traditions and their religious background and their and their formal teachings and of and always being told what was right and what was wrong you know there's got to come to a place in your life where it's not the outside voice that tells you what's right or wrong it's an inside voice that tells you what's right and wrong that even the parents when they were questioned their own son that's been blind and just think of the trial that it must have been for those parents having a blind child teaching it to feel for its cup talking to it describing knowing that he had never seen their face that he would have to have a stick or maybe like a blind bartimaeus a seen lamb he would have to have help all his life and all of a sudden by the great majesty of the messiah he sees and when they question him and they question the mother and father they would not give answer they wouldn't stand up and identify with the very life that gave their child sight they said let him answer for himself and i thought oh my can you imagine there is no medical proof i'm surely many people said oh he never was born blind in the first place and they write it off and they write it off you know i wonder this morning that if like those parents sometimes we get so associated with the carnal life and the carnal mind that we have a tendency to write off the supernatural working in our lives that it's only a thing that occasionally might come our way but it isn't the the the the carnal mind is at enmity or i could use the words it's at odds it it it's not an agreement or it's going in a different direction than god's going the carnal mind is concerned about the present god's not concerned about your present he's concerned about your future there's nothing in your presence that god can't take care of there's nothing that is too hard for him but he when they inc when they inquired of jesus in all the works that he's had performed and they asked that they would see him he he never pointed to the lady down the street that was healed or this thing's he pointed to something that was greater he said destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again hallelujah that was the power that he wanted the church to understand and come up be acquainted with it was the power of the resurrection the power that can quicken amen that was what was granted he was uh so wanted them to realize that it not only could quicken this blind person not only could it quicken this lame person not only could it quicken the devils out of people but it can quicken your mortal body [Applause] it can take the curse of death it's a privilege to me this morning because i have the oldest member of my ministry in the building this morning and don't look for an old person but ben sitting right over here when we still had our little hippie commune his mother marianne being a part of it leslie delivered him he got his first breath of life i've i don't know how old you are now how old are you now 49 years ago amen because the oldest person in here outside of leslie that was a part all of our children were born after but that's the power that he wanted him to see he wanted to recognize that there was a quickening power that there was a power and a life that he had to offer and that life and that power that he had to offer was so powerful that he could give a testimony so he spoke to him he said believe if you don't believe me for my words believe me for my works because they are which testify of me now i want you to see the beautiful pattern here he does the works and he does the signs and wonders because he has a message and we know that every discernment and every gift of discernment and everything that is spoken in all the works that were done he said god never did those type of works unless there was a message that follows and that's the truth because he was gathering them up and the message wasn't woke that there was deliverance in the land though he fulfilled every prophecy the message that he wanted to get across to the church and to every believer that would follow is that there's life after death oh what we could endure in this life if we were absolutely convinced there was life after so he told them to go up into that room can you wait because though i'll send you the promise of the father what was that great promise of the father jesus said i will not leave you comfortless but i personal pronoun will come again and i will be with you and i will be in you there's so much confusion nowadays about what the holy spirit is it's an office it was god above us then it was god with us in flesh and now jesus said the same spirit that's in me i personally i am the father who he who hath seen me hath seen the father i'm the physical manifestation of the father i'm the lamb of god i've become you that you can become me i'm laying down my life so you can have my life eternal life that we could have the same spirit now think of that that we could have the same spirit that dwelt in him in us that's the gift of god that's the gift of the resurrection it wouldn't have done any good if he just paid the price for our sins and we still had to finish our jail term it wouldn't do any good if if he paid the price and we still had to reap everything that we sowed you know that's what the mercy of god is so many times you've sowed things that you should reap but yet in his mercy and his goodness he takes the sentence away from you he throws it in the sea of god's forgetfulness to be remembered no more and not only that but he beckons you or invites you and calls to you and says i want to come in to you amen i want behold i stand at the door knock if any man open i will come into him and i will suck with him he wants to infuse his spirit into you oh but we've got the enemy i call it the enemy of the mirror the enemy of looking at ourselves the enemy of the carnal mind how could it be how can he take me everything i've done everything i've thought the things that i've done when i've known better still wipe it clean that's the kind of love that he had in fact that's what he finally capstones this whole age off is with great love and so he proved to us this easter that he's alive now what does it mean that he's alive if he's alive that means he's present and if he's present and he was present back then then all the works that he did back then he can do today because he's the same yesterday today and forever it's not a different resurrected jesus it's the same jesus that was resurrected but man still looks back and they worship him for the resurrection that was but remember in this message we listened he said what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is that the same quickening power the same power that brought him to life out of the grave that he wants to share that with us this morning oh the carnal mind says no take a look at me the spiritual mind says he died for that part of me he didn't seek me i didn't seek him he sought me he brought the word to me of life and that life is still so beautifully prevalent this morning peter went to that upper room and he received that quickening power it wasn't too long before that that he had denied him three times that he was a coward he was afraid but now this spirit of life when the lord jesus christ came back to him and infused himself into him then he had confidence in the quickening power and if i had a title i would say this i would call it confidence in quickening power confidence in quickening power the carnal mind automatically sets up the defense of reasoning how could it be how could this happen how what by what authority is this done the carnal mind all of a sudden builds all the realms of circumstance they feel their deliverance is trapped within the circumstances of their lives it's like sickness sickness is fenced in by symptoms that we feel that as long as the symptoms there the sickness is there but that's the difference of this quickening power the symptoms are not what holds it there's nothing that holds it it's done by the will of god at his bidding in his will this quickening power if you have confidence in it this quickening power this it's a gift of god it's not something that you can go get you can buy somewhere or find somewhere it's something you have to wait on go to the upper room carry their weight i gave you a promise and if i gave you a promise i there's one thing i can't do is i can't lie don't put a time clock on it don't put a symptoms on it don't build a fence around it have confidence in the quickening power of god that he can do exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think that those cages can be broke down because god doesn't tear the cage down from the outside he tears the symptoms down from the inside once you have confidence once he spoke to you once he's told you once you've heard that voice you're healed you're delivered you look out and you still see the fences you still see the captivity you still see the gates or he's come into your life but now is when you stand up because you got confidence in that power and that revelation that he faith he give me you start possessing those gates satan you're a liar i'm carrying you down i'm plugging this hole the quickening power is what tears satan it's what down them it's what takes it from word to reality you don't have to be in conflict with yourself you don't have to be in conflict with your feelings what you've got to do is have confidence in his word and his quickening power and where did that quickening power come from it came from the defeat of death because the result of every disease is death in fact the result of the time world that we live in is death i was just thinking that if i did the math and ben's 49 i'm 72. so how old would that make me about 22 years of age and you can see the effect of time because that's part of the curse but that doesn't hold me you understand that my body aches and and i get sore and i get weary more easy that doesn't affect me because i've got confidence that what's in me will be quick and it'll quicken this mortal body and then i'll rise again that that quickening power is not a historical memory that is something that's alive this morning and lives here to do exactly what it said it would do now our proof of that is a resurrection how do we know how can we prove that he's risen as long as it's in word form only it's just a testimony it's just a record of event if i say jesus is risen from the dead and you say well prove it to me well i can go to the scriptures and say well here it says it well that's just a record of events that's just like george washington cut down the cherry tree right and he threw a silver dollar across the potomac you know how many believes that george washington never told a lie why because it's anti-word scripture says we come into the world speaking lies you know so we know better in those things but just be leaving it from this alone isn't a true record the proof of his resurrection you can say well it did something for me personally and they could simply say well that's psychology many a person has went to a psychiatrist and a psychologist and they were able to put their thought pattern back together that they could travel down that road i don't want to travel down the road of a psychiatrist or a psychologist i have a promise that if i would believe in the name of the lord jesus christ that he would give me power to become the sons and daughters of god now it's 11 28. so we're having service tonight at six o'clock because of dinner and also because of so many of our young people be coming back in around that time so parents don't have to run back and forth but i want to take you this morning back to easter april 10th 1955. and i want us to listen as jesus christ proves that he's alive that he's risen and that he's there to quicken it's 30 minutes so if we start right now we'll be done by noon then we can go our way but if if he's alive from the time that he rose and he's the same it wouldn't matter when in timeline he would appear as long as we understood it was him it's him he's here and if he's here then couldn't you also touch the hem of his garment couldn't you also go to him and say cast this spirit off of me couldn't you like the blind man in blind bartimaeus couldn't you like the 10 leopards couldn't you like the men possessed by demons couldn't you like the widows and all the people in the scriptures that went to him if he's the same wouldn't he be the same this morning if that power that quickening power the power that he had over the grave couldn't he also have power over every circumstance in your life as the brothers get ready to play this i'd like to read to you we read part of this on daniel but he's talking about he said and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves this morning if there's anything within you you've got to understand that that's not the real you it's something that's opposing you it's something that's fighting against you whether it's depression whether it's nervousness no matter what it is it's something that's opposing you and keeping you from having the full life that you deserve in christ it's the enemy it's a fence it's a prison it's a captivity and this is what he does he says oppose themself if god pre-adventure will give them repentance to acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will everything sickness is satan placing his captivity on you habits are satan placing his captivity on you depressions emotions doubts fears all those things are things that satan uses to place his captivity on us but that's what he came he came out of that grave to leave captivity captive he came to captivate what was captivating you and bring it unto his captivation by this quickening power so as we listen i want you to listen closely because he says so many beautiful words in this next 30 minutes but what the title of this is is the proof of the resurrection the present day proof of what really proves that he's alive and what our commission to us was the works that i do shall do you do also i believe you'll be thoroughly blessed as we pick up the beginning of the prayer line easter 1955. it is phenomenal god bless you i love you with all my heart now father i pray that you'll be merciful and now for your glory lord i pray that you'll grant it right here today in the tabernacle to settle it forever that you have rose from the dead amen now in the name of jesus christ i ask this blessing for god's glory amen now for the glory of god and for the power of his resurrection or the omnipotence of god i now take every spirit in here under my control in the name of jesus christ so do as you're told and now i want that lady here to stand right here by the microphone i know the lady i i think her name is sutton i'm not mr cop oh cobb i'm sorry um i've seen the woman before sure she comes here to tabernacle once in a while and now but i know nothing of what's wrong with her but now the only way that i would have of knowing that would be some way that god would have telling me isn't that right mrs yes it is but cobb it's right cobb is your name now all right all right mrs cobb the only way that i know that what was wrong with you would be god would have to reveal it to me yes and then if he would do that they would have to come through a supernatural power that doesn't belong to human beings it would have to come from divine power isn't that right and then in doing so would that make you believe that i've told you the truth about his resurrection would it make you believe it friend now what what if jesus was standing here with this suit on that he gave me and he and he was standing here if it's now the woman may have financial trouble she may have domestic trouble she may have sick troubles i don't know god knows that i don't know i can't tell you it may be that she's done something in her life it's called every water trouble is to come up on earth i don't know god does i don't but he can tell me well that's what it is jesus said i do nothing except the father shows me it has to come through that now what i'm doing to this woman here will be not reading her mind no sir god forbid god knows that that's wrong it won't be god in heaven my judge knows that's not right not reading her mind but it'll be through the power of the resurrection amen jesus christ how paul and different ones looked upon the people and they perceived that there were certain things that were wrong jesus talking to the woman at the well he carried a conversation with her now we all know that saint john the the fourth chapter he talked to the woman at the well and while talking to the woman after well he was merely catching her spirit the father had told him to go up for the way of samaria jericho where he was going dried straight down like this from jerusalem but he went way around samaria because the lord told him to go up there and he sat there on the well sent his disciples away he knew the woman was coming when she come with her water potty she said bring me a drink she said it's not customary for you to ask me such he said but if you know who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink i'd give you waters you didn't come here to draw is that right then after the conversation went on a little while he finally found just exactly where her trouble was said go get your husband she said i have answered that shrine that's right said you have five and the one you have now it's not your husband she said i perceive that you're a prophet i know when messiah cometh he'll do this or he'll tell us things but who are you he said i'm he that speaks to you now that was jesus [Music] uh lady the only way that i have anointed would be had to be some kind of a contact between you and i with god that would make it known have you ever seen that picture they've taken of the angel the lord standing behind me that light you know you you have seen one of those as a church or you've seen them you're in a church of course now that is what i'm trying to get close to us now now that life is the same pillar of power that led to children of israel which was jesus christ that's ryan the angel of the covenant he was a supernatural foreign man of light he came down with flesh he said i came from god and i go back to god a little while the world won't see me anymore yet you'll see me the world is the unbeliever you'll see me for i'll be with you to the end of the world yes praise the lord now the lord be blessed and you know that i'm i something is taking place now to the audience i want you to be revered but now that same light thanks be to god amen is coming in here to my right side

that as far as i know i've never seen him in the life but i declare that jesus raised in the dead that the same things that jesus did when he was here in a in a body that you could see is right here today doing the same thing he's raised from the dead into the life forevermore blessed are your eyes who see these things and believe on the lord jesus this man a stranger i've never seen him in props he's never seen me if i've ever seen him god knows i don't remember he said he was a stranger to me but god knows him if god will reveal to that man standing there a total stranger to me just exactly what's wrong with him all about it tell about what's wrong with him what it is and he knows that i know nothing about it will you accept christ as your healer everyone [Music] the buildings begin to fade away and come back if you only realize the reason i'm talking to you friends you go into another world you're a different place you're way down the stream of time in somebody's life seeing them who they are and where they are they don't realize i realize that it doesn't isn't working perfectly in here because it's home that's right but you see that he's raised you to the head you see that i told you the truth now look on me sir just a minute just an order that you and i could come in contact with the lord jesus if i be his servant jesus said the things that i do shall do also a little while in the world will see me anymore that's the unbeliever they're about to ball games and swimmings and so forth they'll never see but ye shall see me for i'll be with you in you to the end of the world then if he's racing the dead and he's standing here this morning and this anointing that i have now isn't mine but it's his then you couldn't hide your life if you had to because we're in contact with one another by spirit beings [Music] if god can reveal to me what you're standing there for will you accept it with all your heart you will do it you're suffering with the stomach trouble that's right exactly and the reason of it is because that you're it's caused from a nervous condition and it's not a nervous outward shaking nervous i see you're a deep thinker you're always planning something crossing breaches before you ever get to them you make things that nevertheless come to pass and you've been told that before that's right but it don't do any good to tell you because but now it will because you're healed you're going home a well man jesus christ has made you hold in the name of jesus christ the son of god i rebuke every evil spirit that haunted this man and may he go in peace through jesus christ's name amen god bless you are you believing [Music] all your heart do you believe jesus christ rose on easter do you believe his presence is here now will you obey me is this prophet if you'll do it and sir every one of you can be healed right now every person in earth can be made well do you believe it then bow your head almighty god author of life giver of every gift send thy divine blessing upon this audience and now as your spirit moving and this audience here in this condition i rebuke ever unclean spirit every demon that's bound the sick people christ is here who opened the doors and set the cathy free and every one of them's free because jesus raised from the dead and proves himself here today satan come out of the people in the name of jesus christ and everyone now that please i don't care what condition you own the crutches there raise up every person raise up in the name of jesus christ [Music] the lord amen hallelujah amen amen now that same jesus that was there in 1955 is here that was the message that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever if it was never to try to duplicate that ministry we didn't have to duplicate it because he proved and revealed that that same jesus is here to the gentile church now you can contact him every single one of those persons came up the prophet of god said it i don't control it it controls me that same pillar of fire the same jesus that rhodes is here now because he's resurrected and every day in your life never underestimate the power of the resurrection never lose confidence in that quickening power that it can do for you exceedingly and abundantly above that which you can even think or ask if it can quicken death which was the ultimate curse of sin then it can heal and deliver everything this site of death so this easter this is what easter is about jesus setting the captive free he rose to break the curse that sin had on man and set us free i give you life and life more abundant so i like i said if i had a message i say have confidence in that quickening power have confidence in what you've seen displayed through a prophetic gift that that same spirit knows you he knows everything about you he knows where you've been he knows what you've done and he wants to do for you because if he ever does one thing for one person he has to do it again every time the same have faith today this is our easter this is what it's about jesus christ has risen from the dead and is here to do exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask or think god bless you let's stand this morning i thought in my heart i thought you know i could preach about easter but wouldn't it be better if i could demonstrate easter and i thought who demonstrated that who proved to us that our easter is true that's why he sent our messenger so i just felt led to do that this morning i hope it was a blessing to you this morning let us bow our heads [Music] many people in this scripture look to the lord jesus and the lord would say do you believe and they would say lord help my unbelief [Music] and what a beautiful prayer lord help my unbelief lord the power of your resurrection the quickening power is here to do for me exceedingly and abundantly and father it doesn't have to be in an emotional physical feeling father it's a confidence in the quickening power it's a confidence that you're alive that you're not historical but you're standing here this morning because you promised that wherever two or three gathered in your name that you would be there and father i know there's needs in the assembly lord as we saw in the as we listened the prophet saw evil spirit going from one side of the room to the other racing back those spirits calling out from one another evil spirit and he said it was it was gallbladder and they were healed they were healed because you rose from the dead and you were standing in that room right there in the form of the pillar of fire and father you've given us blessed are the eyes who have not seen but yet believe father you've given us the faith and you've quickened into us a life that believes this morning that you've risen that you're the same yesterday today and forever and that you're performing the same works and father i ask that you take every person that lays their request on their altar and may they have confidence in your power to quicken their request to life because quickening power means to make alive and father that they lay their petition at the resurrected jesus and that quickening power would make that request come alive in their life and have confidence in your power to quicken and to bring to life our request we ask it this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you happy easter service at six o'clock tonight six o'clock give you a little extra time to eat easter dinner and those that are picking up kids from camp they can come in so lord richie bless you billy elitist and
