[20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our God is the God of victory.
[20:12] Amen. Amen. We don't have any written
[20:14] request up here. Amen. There was an
[20:17] announcement in the youth chat, but my
[20:19] phone died. So,
[20:24] um,
[20:26] &gt;&gt; yeah, just help me out. Can you just
[20:28] come up here and you'll, uh, pray for
[20:30] the offering? So, amen. The brothers
[20:32] that are taking the offerings if you
[20:34] could be ready
[20:47] before the Lord. we were able to arrange
[20:49] uh a group camping area at Lake
[20:51] Grapevine and so we sent out an
[20:53] announcement for it. The area is for
[20:57] only made available to groups that would
[20:58] be camping. Um but it is a very nice
[21:02] group area. We sent out a little video
[21:03] of it, but there's an area day use area
[21:06] for families, picnic area and things
[21:08] like that. But um what we're doing is
[21:11] going to have a bonfire, an opportunity
[21:13] for testimony, and um it's a public
[21:17] park, so you anybody could go, but for
[21:20] what we've paid for and reserved, um
[21:22] we're allowed like 25 cars and really
[21:25] enough room to take care of most people.
[21:29] Um and most so depending on what it
[21:32] looks like and who comes out, we can
[21:34] accommodate extra vehicles. So, there's
[21:36] just some parameters, but it's at Lake
[21:39] Grapevine at Mural Park. Um, and we if
[21:43] you want to show up earlier than like 4,
[21:46] let me know. We can get you in, but
[21:47] that's that's kind of the basis of the
[21:49] announcement. Um, that it's at Meadow
[21:53] Mir Park. So, let me correct that. So,
[21:55] it's at Meadow Mir Park on Lake
[21:57] Grapevine and we can check in from 2 PM
[22:00] and have to be gone by 100 pm Saturday,
[22:03] but there's ample area for those who
[22:04] want to camp or tent and uh otherwise
[22:07] it's going to be a time for bonfire and
[22:09] fellowship. So, let's just uh there was
[22:13] no request, but I know that um there's
[22:16] always a need upon our heart and
[22:19] something that we want the Lord to do
[22:20] for us. So, let's just go before him and
[22:23] pray. Gracious heavenly father, as we
[22:26] come to this part of the service, Lord,
[22:28] even myself was eager to come and Lord,
[22:31] there was things and cares that had
[22:33] pressed upon me, Father, and we just
[22:35] came in late. And it was just such a joy
[22:39] to walk into this sanctuary and to hear
[22:40] the praises of your people being sung.
[22:43] And Lord, even just to reflect on the
[22:45] wonderful things you just did [music]
[22:47] this past weekend. And Lord, in all that
[22:50] we do, we want to give you our all, give
[22:52] you first place. We want you to sit on
[22:55] the throne of our heart with nothing in
[22:56] between. [music] And Lord, we just ask
[22:58] now if there's any small hindrance,
[23:01] Lord, that we would just brush them
[23:02] aside, Father, and give you the complete
[23:04] preeminence. Lord, we're we're nothing
[23:07] truly without you. Lord, you're the one
[23:10] who gave us our breath this morning to
[23:12] rise to praise you. [music] There's
[23:14] nothing that we in ourselves could keep
[23:15] in our own hands, Lord. Not even the
[23:18] things we take for granted if it's not
[23:20] for the grace of God. If it's not for
[23:22] you, Father, we wouldn't have them. So,
[23:24] we just want to tender our hearts once
[23:26] again before you and [music] Lord,
[23:29] proclaim you, Lord of all, Lord, I have
[23:32] nothing that you aren't in control of.
[23:34] So, I just surrender myself to you. Ask
[23:36] that you'd speak to my heart, to my
[23:38] mind. Lord, that your people here who've
[23:40] gathered, Father, you'd move
[23:42] supernaturally. [music] Lord, would we
[23:44] look past humanity, the felity, and
[23:46] Lord, see you once again speaking to us.
[23:49] [music]
[23:50] Father, we commit it to you in all the
[23:53] sincerity we know how and ask that you
[23:56] would have your will and way in the
[23:57] service. Forgive us, Father. We We don't
[23:59] want to be left, Lord, in any place that
[24:04] Lord needs a [music] furtherance. Lord,
[24:07] we want to go further. You know, our
[24:09] hearts cry and how we desire [music] to
[24:11] express it. May just be according to
[24:13] your will. In the name of our Lord and
[24:14] Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[24:34] Oh, why [singing] would I [music] worry
[24:36] when giants come calling my name?
[24:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[24:44] &gt;&gt; My God [singing] is so much bigger than
[24:48] all [music] this fear.
[24:53] Oh, why [music] would I [singing]
[24:55] hunger for power which is all faith?
[25:01] [music]
[25:03] My [singing] God is so much bigger than
[25:07] all [music] this.

[25:36] each time [music and singing] to move.

[25:43] better, stronger, greater than you.

[25:52] scattered for the whole battle is
[25:56] [music]
[25:56] done.

[26:12] and rose up on the third [music] day.

[27:03] you.

[27:16] He [music] doesn't already know. There's
[27:19] no problem to be. There's
[27:21] [music and singing] no weapon too
[27:22] strong. There's nothing

[30:38] heard my [music] cry to you and raise me
[30:42] up again.
[30:45] My strength is [music] almost
[30:51] [music]
[30:53] if I can. Hallelujah. He's the present
[30:56] help. Oh, as the time
[31:01] Oh, I [music] will hear your whisper
[31:05] through the rain.
[31:07] Oh, I'm with [music] you.
[31:13] Oh, and your mercy fall. Oh, I raise
[31:17] [music] my hands to praise the God of
[31:21] King.
[31:23] and it takes [music] away.
[31:30] I praise [music] you with this.
[31:34] I will my
[31:38] [music] you.
[31:46] [music]
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, you hold [singing] in your hand.
[31:53] Never left my [music] side.
[31:56] Though my heart is told
[32:04] I'll praise you [music and singing] in
[32:05] this.
[32:09] I remember [music] when
[32:15] I [music and singing] remember when
[32:19] I stumbled in the [singing] wind
[32:23] heard my cry and you raised me
[32:27] [music and singing] up again.
[32:30] My strength is almost gone.
[32:34] How can [music] I carry on?
[32:37] If I can't find you. [music and singing]
[32:43] And as the thunder [music and singing]
[32:45] rolls,
[32:47] I hear you whisper through the rain,
[32:50] [music]
[32:53] I'm [singing] with you.
[32:58] And as your mercy [music and singing]
[33:00] falls,
[33:02] I pray on him. I praise the God [music]
[33:05] who
[33:07] [singing]
[33:08] and he takes away.
[33:14] [music]
[33:15] I will praise [singing] you with this
[33:17] Lord
[33:19] and I will lift [music] my hands.
[33:23] You are who you are.
[33:26] No matter where I [singing] am, [music]
[33:30] in every tear I cry. [singing] Oh, you
[33:34] hold in your hand. [music]
[33:38] You never left my side.
[33:41] Though my heart is
[33:48] I'll praise [music] you in this stor.
[33:55] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just go before
[33:57] him.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Truly, Lord, we are so thankful and we
[34:03] could have the revelation to know that
[34:04] all things work together [music]
[34:06] for good to those that are called
[34:09] according to your purpose, Lord. And we
[34:12] go through trials. We go through
[34:13] heartaches, [music] Lord. We go through
[34:16] turmoil. Many times we can't even
[34:18] explain or understand.
[34:21] the Lord down in our soul there's a
[34:23] revelation
[34:25] just like Job said that one day though
[34:27] the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
[34:29] blessed be the name of the Lord
[34:32] Lord we have that revelation in our
[34:34] souls to know Lord that all good things
[34:37] have come from you Lord and we thank you
[34:39] for it Lord if [music] something's to be
[34:41] taken away from us Lord we know we
[34:44] haven't lost anything for soon and very
[34:46] soon we'll be changed in a moment in a
[34:48] twinkling of an eye and everything that
[34:50] we love and hold dear Lord Lord will be
[34:52] with and we'll be with you for all
[34:54] eternity. [music] Lord, we love you. We
[34:56] thank you for the songs that have been
[34:57] sung and the opportunity to come be
[35:00] together with our brothers and sisters
[35:02] once again. We love you, Lord. We just
[35:04] commit [music] the remainder of the
[35:05] service, asking that you would just
[35:06] come, Lord, and break the bread of life
[35:08] to your children as only you can.
[35:10] [music] We ask it in your name, the Lord
[35:11] Jesus Christ.
[35:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. If you have
[35:16] your Bibles, we'll be reading out of
[35:17] Numbers chapter 13. It's just good to be
[35:21] uh back in the house of the Lord. We
[35:22] really enjoyed our meetings with brother
[35:24] Tom and brother Michael and just the
[35:27] services that were preached. Um brother
[35:30] um Tom preaching my children give me
[35:33] your heart and uh just what a moving
[35:36] service to to call to all of us to give
[35:38] him all of our heart and all that we
[35:41] can. And brother Michael uh preached on
[35:44] beyond the last breath. We're so
[35:45] thankful that uh this natural breath
[35:47] that we breathed is is is not the one
[35:49] that counts, but it's that spiritual
[35:50] breath that God has given us by the
[35:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you know,
[35:55] even if we went by the way of the grave,
[35:57] one of these days, we're going to step
[35:58] into that new body. Amen. And that last
[36:02] sermon that brother uh Tom preached,
[36:05] just what a what a wonderful word that
[36:07] he cares. He does care. Aren't you glad
[36:09] he cares?
[36:11] &gt;&gt; And I believe he's come once again. He
[36:12] cares about where we're at and what
[36:14] we're going through and what we have
[36:15] need of and we're just looking to him to
[36:17] speak to our hearts. Amen. Amen. God
[36:19] bless you. Reading out of Numbers
[36:21] chapter 13 and verse 25 through3.
[36:26] Just I going to try to be short, but I
[36:31] know that doesn't work a lot. But we
[36:33] know we've had long weekends and we've
[36:35] all got right back into work. So, I know
[36:37] some of us are maybe run down and tired
[36:39] from the weekend, still recovering. Some
[36:41] of you, I don't know about about y'all,
[36:44] but I'm still recovering. Amen. So,
[36:47] numbers 13 and 25 says, "And they
[36:50] returned from searching of the land
[36:52] after 40 days, and they went and came to
[36:55] Moses and to Aaron, and to all the
[36:57] congregation of the children of Israel,
[36:59] into the wilderness of Pan and Teadish,
[37:01] and brought back word unto them, and to
[37:03] all the congregation, and showed them
[37:05] the fruit of the land." And they told
[37:07] him and said, "We came unto the land
[37:09] whether thou sentest us, and surely it
[37:11] flowth with milk and honey, and this is
[37:14] the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the
[37:15] people be strong that dwell in the land,
[37:17] and the cities are walled and very
[37:19] great." And moreover, we saw the
[37:21] children of Anoch there. The Amalocites
[37:23] dwell in the land of the south, and the
[37:24] Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the
[37:26] Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the
[37:27] Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
[37:29] coast of Jordan. And Caleb stealed the
[37:31] people before Moses and said, "Let us go
[37:33] up at once and possess it, for we are
[37:36] well able to overcome it." But the men
[37:38] that went up with him said, "We be not
[37:41] able to go up against the people, for
[37:44] they are stronger than we." And they
[37:46] brought up an evil report of the land
[37:49] which they have searched unto the
[37:50] children of Israel, saying, The land
[37:53] through which we have gone to search it,
[37:55] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[37:57] thereof, and all the people that we saw
[38:00] in it are men of great stature. And
[38:03] there we saw giants, the son of Anoch,
[38:06] which come of the giants, and we were in
[38:08] our own sight as grasshoppers, and we
[38:12] were as so we were in their sight. Amen.
[38:15] We just ask a blessing on the reading of
[38:16] the word. You may be seated. I also want
[38:18] to just read out of Isaiah 53
[38:21] and verse one. Uh this is uh you know
[38:24] Kadesh Barnea is a a very um important
[38:28] part of scripture because here the
[38:30] children of Israel are coming to cross
[38:32] over into uh the promised land. And
[38:35] you're seeing uh an evil report is
[38:37] rising up. And in Isaiah 53 it says,
[38:40] "Who who hath believed our report? into
[38:43] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[38:47] And you know, report is news. It's it's
[38:49] tidings. And I'm so thankful I've heard
[38:51] the good news.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; I've heard the gospel.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and
[38:57] he is alive.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; And it says, "Who hath believed our
[39:01] report?" And brother Brandon would say
[39:03] this in the sixth seal. Just a short
[39:06] comment on this scripture. He says, it
[39:08] said, "Who hath believed our report? And
[39:11] to whom has the arm of the Lord been
[39:13] revealed? See, believe the report.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Then the arm of the Lord is revealed.
[39:19] The arm, the word of God is revealed.
[39:22] Believe the report.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; So maybe that would be my title tonight.
[39:26] Believe the report.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Whose report are you going to believe?
[39:33] Because here here in uh the children of
[39:35] Israel that they sent the 10 spies and
[39:38] they they went over into the land and
[39:40] and they spied it out and they brought
[39:42] back the evidence that it was a good
[39:44] land and and Joshua and Caleb said,
[39:45] "Hey, we're more than able to go." But
[39:47] watch, there was an evil report that
[39:49] rose up and we might just uh just preach
[39:52] on some of these things with the help of
[39:53] God. Some familiar things that's been on
[39:55] our heart here recently. And one of the
[39:58] things that struck me, I was listening
[39:59] to the conflict between God and Satan.
[40:01] And brother Brandon would say this. He'd
[40:03] say, "The other night I was preaching. I
[40:04] believe it w it was at the tabernacle
[40:06] and I struck something that's done me
[40:08] more good than anything I've thought of
[40:10] since I've been converted."
[40:16] &gt;&gt; That should make your ears perk up.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; I'll read it again in case some of you
[40:21] are were shuffling or going through
[40:22] something.
[40:24] He was preaching the other night and he
[40:26] said he struck something that's done me
[40:28] more good than anything I've thought of
[40:31] since I've been converted.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; I when I heard that I went, "Wow."
[40:36] Well, I want to know more about that. He
[40:39] said, "I might repeat again if it's if
[40:40] that's all right. I I I I know I know
[40:43] where you know that where I'm going to,
[40:45] but but it was that evidence of
[40:47] salvation."
[40:50] He says, "It just struck me and I said
[40:52] it." I went home and I got in my room
[40:54] and I I walked up and down the floor. I
[40:56] I just had a little good time by myself,
[40:59] you know, just in there thinking about
[41:00] it. And here's what it was. I might pass
[41:04] it on to you just for a minute. I was
[41:05] talking about we are possessors of all
[41:08] things. Everything is ours. Isn't that
[41:12] wonderful how in in Galatians 3:29 it
[41:15] would say if you're Abraham's seeds,
[41:16] then we're heir. We're we're heir of
[41:18] everything. We're heir of the promise.
[41:20] We're we're heir of all things. And
[41:21] brother Brandon would go on and show you
[41:23] can take that down. Brother Brandon
[41:25] would go on and show how he would say
[41:27] that we're possessors of all things. You
[41:29] know that we're possessors of joy. We're
[41:31] possessors of love. We're we're
[41:32] possessors of peace. And and all of
[41:34] these things were heir to. It's all
[41:36] given to us. And he would start to show
[41:37] how, you know, you can't go down to the
[41:39] store and you can't buy yourself some
[41:40] love. You can't you might think you can,
[41:42] but look, you can't buy love. You can't
[41:43] go down to Walmart and go down and ask
[41:45] the store clerk and say, "You know, I
[41:47] was just in here looking for some
[41:48] peace." And I'd come to the store and
[41:50] I've been looking up and down. I was
[41:51] going to tell you, if you're looking for
[41:52] peace, don't go to Walmart.
[41:56] You're not going to find you're not
[41:57] going to find peace at Walmart. It's
[41:58] it's not going to be there. You know,
[42:00] you're not going to be able to go into
[42:02] into Walmart and and and go to the the
[42:04] the clerk and, you know, say, "I'm
[42:05] looking to buy some joy. I'm I'm looking
[42:07] to buy some peace. I I'm I'm I looking
[42:10] for something." You're not going to find
[42:11] it in Lady Osia. You're not going to
[42:12] find it in in your job. It might be
[42:14] temporary. Sure, there's things that we
[42:16] might do and you find some joy and some
[42:18] some satisfaction. But all of those
[42:20] things are going to perish. They're all
[42:21] going to pass away. But but there's a
[42:22] there is a peace that paths
[42:24] understanding. There is a joy that comes
[42:26] from the Lord. And and and the prophet
[42:27] of God is showing how we're possessor of
[42:29] all things. We possess love. We possess
[42:31] joy. We we we possess peace. All of
[42:34] these things are ours. We're possessors
[42:36] of all things. And he would go on
[42:38] saying, you know, uh just thinking about
[42:40] our inheritance and thinking about
[42:41] Israel and and how they were in bondage
[42:43] for 400 years and a and and here come
[42:47] here they are just uh being beaten by
[42:49] their task masters and the slaves are I
[42:51] mean that the the the slave drivers are
[42:53] hitting them with the whips and here
[42:55] they are in bondage and here comes a a a
[42:57] prophet coming out of the wilderness and
[42:59] he's telling look look you don't have to
[43:01] be in bondage anymore. Uh uh God is
[43:03] going to take you over into the promised
[43:05] land and and no more mud pits and and no
[43:08] more being beat over your back. You
[43:09] don't have to live like that anymore. I
[43:10] want to tell you what a message that
[43:12] would be that that a prophet would come
[43:14] and say, "Look, you don't have to be in
[43:15] bondage anymore. You don't you don't
[43:17] have to be whipped by task masters that
[43:18] say go here and and go there and do this
[43:21] and do that." But here come a prophet
[43:23] with a message saying, "Look, we're
[43:24] we're God is going to take you out of
[43:26] here by a mighty hand and he's going to
[43:27] take you into a promised land because
[43:29] you're an heir.
[43:32] And we know the story about how God
[43:34] brought them out uh by a mighty hand.
[43:36] And the prophet would say this. He he
[43:38] would say, "And Joshua went over into
[43:40] the promised land." Now remember, none
[43:42] of them had never been there. They
[43:44] didn't know whether the land was
[43:45] actually there or not.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; They just by faith went by what was told
[43:51] them
[43:52] &gt;&gt; that God had a place for them
[43:54] &gt;&gt; and they was going to that place just by
[43:56] faith. Now think of that. left Egypt and
[43:58] God brought them out. And now they're
[44:00] nearing the land. And when they get near
[44:03] the land, Joshua goes over into the land
[44:06] and brings back the evidence. Crosses
[44:08] Jordan, goes over into Palestine, brings
[44:12] back the evidence, a great bunch of
[44:14] grapes that had taken two men to pack,
[44:16] and they could eat those grapes. And he
[44:18] said, "The land is just exactly what God
[44:22] said it was." Look, Joshua and Caleb
[44:25] came back with the fruit and it was the
[44:27] evidence that it showed. Look, this is
[44:29] exactly what God said it was. Look at
[44:31] the grapes. Look at the fruits. Look at
[44:33] the things that when we went over, we
[44:35] were able to look out into the land and
[44:37] and it's a land that flowth with milk
[44:39] and honey. It's everything that God
[44:41] promised. It's everything that he said
[44:43] it was. And they brought back packing
[44:45] the evidence.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you the same thing
[44:48] about the message of the hour. It's
[44:50] everything that God said it was. It is
[44:53] my joy. It is my peace. It is my
[44:55] salvation. It's everything that I ever
[44:58] wanted. It's everything that I ever
[44:59] needed. It will save you. It will keep
[45:02] you. It will take you into a rapture. It
[45:04] will take you up out of the grave. It's
[45:06] my salvation. It's I It's my It's my
[45:08] justification. It It's my
[45:10] sanctification. I It brings the baptism
[45:13] of the Holy Ghost. Why? Because it's the
[45:14] promise of the age. Just like God sent
[45:17] Noah, a prophet, with a message to be
[45:19] able to escape the oncoming judgment.
[45:21] God sent a prophet with a message.
[45:23] That's exactly what the message of the
[45:25] hour is. If you want to enter into the
[45:27] promised land, I say God has sent a
[45:29] word. He sent a message. And if you
[45:31] believe it by faith, it'll take you into
[45:33] every promise.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; The land is just exactly what God said
[45:41] it was.
[45:44] It's everything.
[45:46] Not just a promise of another age, you
[45:48] know, not just something of a of a day
[45:50] gone by, but what is the hour that we're
[45:52] living in? We're living in the age of
[45:54] adoption. We're we're living in the hour
[45:56] of the fullness of restoration. This is
[45:58] the adoption of sons. Look, we don't
[46:00] want to stop short and just be satisfied
[46:02] with a a good feeling or I've been I've
[46:04] been delivered of my sins or, you know,
[46:06] I I've gone to church and I've done my
[46:08] duty and and the burden of sin has been
[46:10] lifted. But no, we've given been given a
[46:12] promise and we want to enter into all
[46:14] the promises of God. We want to possess
[46:16] this vest vessel in sanctification and
[46:18] honor. We want to see the adoption and
[46:20] the placing of sons and the maturity. We
[46:23] don't want to just be in babies and and
[46:24] and and pampered around and patted on
[46:26] the back and and up and down and up and
[46:28] down and always wondering, am I in and
[46:31] am I out? Am I going in the rapture and
[46:33] I'm not going to rapture? Am I the bride
[46:35] and am I not the bride? Am I just
[46:36] foolish virgin? and maybe I'll I'll
[46:38] start handing out cups of water to
[46:40] everybody at church so just in case, you
[46:42] know, I miss the rapture, I can make it
[46:44] in because I was good to somebody in the
[46:46] bride. But that ain't no way for you to
[46:48] think. The devil puts those thoughts in
[46:50] your mind and he's trying to rob you of
[46:52] everything that you're heir of. You're
[46:53] possessor of all things.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Everything is ours. And I say there
[46:59] ought to be a cry in the heart of the
[47:01] people that would say, "Let us go up at
[47:03] once."
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; We're more than able to do it. Let it
[47:08] let us go up at once. Let's take the
[47:09] land, church. What are we waiting for?
[47:11] We we waiting for some great calamity
[47:13] and we finally get into desperation. We
[47:15] we got to lose a loved one. We got to
[47:17] lose a family member. Something has to
[47:19] happen or we finally get uncomfortable
[47:20] in our jobs or we lose our job or we
[47:22] lose our health or something happens and
[47:24] we finally get in desperation. We
[47:26] finally start to call on the name of the
[47:27] Lord. I say, "Let's get into desperation
[47:30] now. Let's get the love of God in our
[47:31] heart. Let's get a love for the Bible.
[47:33] Let's get a love for prayer. Let's get a
[47:35] love for the message of the hour. Let's
[47:36] sell out lock, stock, and barrel. Look,
[47:38] if you gave everything you had to the
[47:40] world, I say some of us live pretty hard
[47:42] out in the world. I say, let's live
[47:44] pretty hard for Jesus Christ. Let's give
[47:46] all of our heart. Let's give all of our
[47:47] time. Let's give all of our effort.
[47:49] Let's give everything that we have to
[47:50] the Lord Jesus Christ. Why don't we just
[47:52] live for Jesus? Preach for Jesus. Why
[47:54] don't we do everything for the Lord
[47:56] Jesus Christ? Hey, some people, you
[47:58] might not be sold out, but I want to
[48:00] tell you, if you can get on the back
[48:01] side of the desert and you can be Jesus
[48:03] Christ, he'll change your life. He'll
[48:05] change the way that you think. The Bible
[48:07] said if if that same spirit that raised
[48:09] up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in
[48:11] you, it will also quicken your mortal
[48:13] body. I say, Lord Jesus, quicken my
[48:15] thoughts. Quicken my actions. Quicken
[48:17] the things that I say. Quicken the
[48:18] things that I do. Quicken me in church
[48:20] to hear the word. I don't want to sleep
[48:22] on the word. I don't want to come in and
[48:24] go back on a change. I don't want to
[48:26] come in here unimpressed. Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Are we sufficiently
[48:33] impressed with the word in our midst?"
[48:37] &gt;&gt; I think some of us aren't impressed.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; We're more impressed with CBN and NBC
[48:43] and ESPN and all those other letters out
[48:46] there.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; It's funny how a movie can hold your
[48:49] attention for three hours. You can you
[48:51] can be so tired and want to go to sleep,
[48:53] but turn on a movie and for some reason
[48:55] you're wired for three hours. But if you
[48:57] open up your Bible,
[49:01] &gt;&gt; it's like good night. You want to go to
[49:02] sleep, put on a tape, that'll put you to
[49:04] sleep. You want to stay up, put on
[49:06] something that your flesh likes, and all
[49:07] of a sudden you'll be wired and glued. I
[49:10] say there ought to be something in the
[49:12] believer's heart to say, "That ain't the
[49:13] way." Uh-uh. Devil, you ain't going to
[49:15] anoint my flesh like that. I I
[49:17] [screaming] I'm going to sell out to the
[49:19] Holy Ghost and fire. I'm going to read
[49:21] my Bible. I'm going to pray. And if I
[49:23] get tired, I'm going to stand up and
[49:24] pray. If I can't read my Bible, if I
[49:27] walk in, I'm going to do something
[49:29] because this body is going to read the
[49:31] word of God and listen to the message of
[49:33] the hour. And I say it's about time we
[49:35] we kick all the Tommy rod out, all the
[49:37] other stuff that we're giving our time
[49:39] and attention and start giving our time
[49:40] to the word.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm here to encourage you with what
[49:44] the with what the the the the the
[49:46] meetings we just went through and and
[49:48] what's on my heart. I want to believe
[49:50] his report. Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, we want to come out of these
[49:54] meetings running. We want to come out of
[49:56] these meetings strong. We want to come
[49:58] out of these meet meetings and go
[49:59] higher.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I I want to live higher.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; You know what it mean? You know what you
[50:07] can do if you live higher? That means
[50:08] you can jump higher.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God never come to tell
[50:12] you not to jump.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, just don't jump higher
[50:15] than you're living." So, we received a
[50:17] message so we could live higher. So, we
[50:19] could jump higher.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Well, you might like it, don't like it,
[50:24] but I like it because I'll jump for
[50:25] Jesus.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; That just might be a good old sermon
[50:28] title, jump for Jesus. You jump for the
[50:30] world, you might as well jump for Jesus.
[50:32] You might as well get excited for God.
[50:34] You might get You're going to get
[50:35] excited for something. Especially our
[50:37] young people. Young people are going to
[50:38] get excited about something. And we give
[50:40] them everything else to get excited
[50:42] about but the word of God. But I tell
[50:43] you, when you get a revelation, there's
[50:45] nothing else worth being excited for
[50:47] than Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[50:49] today, and forever. It is something
[50:51] worth to fellowship about, to get
[50:53] together about, to talk about, to
[50:55] testify about, to go camping about. I
[50:57] tell you what, it's it's it's worth it
[50:59] when Jesus Christ is in your midst.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Prophet didn't come to quiet us down and
[51:06] to sit us down. He came for us to soar
[51:08] in heavenly places.
[51:10] And if you live higher, you can jump
[51:12] higher.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Right? The prophet preached that getting
[51:15] in the spirit. I say, "Let's live in the
[51:17] spirit. If you if we if we're going to
[51:19] walk in the spirit, let's live in the
[51:21] spirit."
[51:23] &gt;&gt; So, brother Random goes on and shows how
[51:25] the great warrior Joshua led them into
[51:27] the promised land. And and so, they're
[51:29] no longer slaves living under the living
[51:31] and they're living under the blessings
[51:33] of God. And now they've come into the
[51:34] promised land and and and now they're
[51:36] going just through the through the cycle
[51:38] of living life and thy
[51:40] &gt;&gt; they're in the promised land and now you
[51:43] know but that they're there and and
[51:44] Joshua brought them in and now they're
[51:46] they're living a in a natural promised
[51:48] land. But the prophet of God shows he
[51:50] says then one day come the greatest
[51:52] warrior of them all the Lord Jesus the
[51:54] son of God. And he said there is a land
[51:56] where a man don't die.
[51:59] He said in in in paragraph 26, "Then on
[52:02] the day of Pentecost, he sent back the
[52:04] earnest of this place, the assurance,
[52:06] the evidence that this land is real."
[52:09] Just like Joshua brought back the
[52:10] evidence, Jesus brought back the
[52:12] evidence of the Holy Ghost. Now, we
[52:14] reckon ourselves dead. We're buried with
[52:15] him in baptism unto his death. And we
[52:17] raise with him in the resurrection. And
[52:19] now, we are in already, not we're going
[52:22] to be, we're already raised. Oh my. We
[52:25] are now not will be. We are now tonight
[52:28] sitting in heavenly places. How? In
[52:31] Christ Jesus.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a promise to know that right
[52:35] now we are seated in heavenly places in
[52:38] Christ Jesus. That if that same spirit
[52:40] that raised up Jesus Christ from the uh
[52:43] from the dead dwell in you, it will
[52:44] quicken your mortal body, you are a new
[52:47] creature, old things have passed away.
[52:50] All things have become new. Is there
[52:51] somebody here that knows what I'm
[52:53] talking about? Is there somebody that
[52:54] say, "Preacher, I know what you're
[52:56] talking about. I know what I I used to
[52:58] be, but then Jesus Christ got a hold of
[53:01] my life. And the creature that I once
[53:02] was is dead, and I have been changed.
[53:05] And I have been made alive in Jesus
[53:07] Christ." I say, "Sometimes on your worst
[53:10] days and on your down days, why don't
[53:12] you just start thinking about his grace?
[53:14] Why don't you start thinking about his
[53:15] mercy? Why don't you start thinking
[53:16] about, you know, where I once was, but
[53:18] then God reached down with his great
[53:20] mercy and he pulled me up out of the
[53:22] muck and mire of sin and he set me on
[53:24] the strong rock of revelation that I can
[53:27] never fall off that rock. So no matter
[53:29] how bad my day is and how good my day
[53:31] is, I am resting in his hands. I'm
[53:34] resting upon a promised word.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Baron said, "Religious religion
[53:42] is a covering, but salvation is
[53:44] freedom."
[53:47] Some of us just got religion.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, religion ain't no way to
[53:53] live.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; It kind of might make you feel good that
[53:56] you were able to cross your tees and dot
[53:57] your eyes,
[53:59] &gt;&gt; but it ain't liberty.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; It ain't freedom. Living by a moral code
[54:04] of conduct and and always having to
[54:07] remind yourself and and hearing the
[54:08] preacher or the word and come back again
[54:10] and and you're always constantly moving
[54:12] towards the edge. You're always
[54:14] constantly moving towards the fence.
[54:15] You're you're always constantly trying
[54:16] to keep the word to keep the letter.
[54:19] It's always the law I if it's no joy.
[54:22] It's no peace. I tell you that that
[54:24] that's there that's no way to live.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; That that's exactly what religion is and
[54:30] religious it's just a covering. But
[54:31] salvation is freedom. Does anybody know
[54:34] what it is? Oh. Oh. To be free,
[54:39] &gt;&gt; free from the world.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Free from sin. free from unbelief. Free
[54:44] from from transgressing the word of God.
[54:46] Free from all the doubt. Free from all
[54:48] the unbelief and how Satan will come
[54:50] around. He'll try to lie to you and and
[54:52] try to tell you, you know, you're not
[54:53] going to make it. And you can just say,
[54:54] "Shut up, you old dumb devil. I ain't
[54:56] listening today. You might have talked
[54:58] me into thinking like that one time."
[55:00] But look, I am free. And whom the son
[55:02] has made free is free indeed. I ain't
[55:05] got no time for your negative thoughts.
[55:07] I ain't got no time or attention for
[55:08] you, devil. I'm not going to believe
[55:10] your report because what is the devil
[55:12] always trying to do? He's always trying
[55:14] to bring up an evil report. He's always
[55:16] trying to run you down. He's always
[55:17] trying to tell you how big the trial
[55:19] looks and how big the giants are. And
[55:20] what does he want you to do? He wants
[55:22] you to start giving him an ear so you
[55:23] might believe his report. But I ain't
[55:25] going to believe his report. I'm going
[55:26] to believe the report of the Lord.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to maybe focus on
[55:33] something for a moment. Like I said, we
[55:34] won't be long tonight. Lord willing,
[55:37] just want to encourage you in something.
[55:39] But but Paul said in Ephesians 2:8, he
[55:41] said, "For by grace are you saved
[55:43] through faith, and that not of
[55:45] yourselves. It is the gift of God, not
[55:48] of works, lest any man should boast."
[55:52] So it's not your good works.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Help me out. Help me out.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; It's not your good works.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; It's not your efforts.
[56:04] It's not how much you can quote the
[56:06] Bible,
[56:07] &gt;&gt; not how many tapes you can listen to.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not how how much uh how
[56:13] much of a message theologian you can
[56:15] become.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; There's plenty of theologians out there.
[56:19] There's plenty of men who are studied
[56:21] and and know their Bible and and my I
[56:24] would tell you what, some of the the the
[56:26] people who hate this message study it
[56:27] more than some of us do.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; They hate it so bad. I mean, they they
[56:33] just they they they they're just trying
[56:35] to find something and and always trying
[56:37] to come up with something. Look, that's
[56:38] how the devil is. They're consumed with
[56:40] it. That's what you know, you know,
[56:42] that's how you keep a dumpster fire
[56:43] doing you. You got to keep looking for
[56:45] trash and that's all they can do is keep
[56:47] looking for trash and looking for heirs
[56:48] and looking for this and looking for
[56:50] that,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:54] &gt;&gt; But it's not your good works.
[56:57] It's not your efforts.
[57:00] Brother Brandham said, "Now works are
[57:02] fine, but they don't save you.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; They don't make you perfect. It is
[57:08] Christ or perish. It is not even Christ
[57:11] and works. It is Christ alone."
[57:15] &gt;&gt; This is the Philadelphiaian church. As
[57:16] he said, "This age begin the years of
[57:18] our manyism that does not believe in
[57:20] Christ as the reality. It does not sing
[57:24] of nothing but the blood, for it sings
[57:26] of nothing but the blood and my own
[57:29] conduct."
[57:32] Now, if we're not careful,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; we allow the devil to start bringing an
[57:37] evil report where we start to measure
[57:39] the word of God by our conduct.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, Brother Brandon will hit
[57:43] this. We're not doing away with good
[57:45] conduct.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; But what we want to do is lay in the
[57:48] principle of the word that it's not your
[57:50] good works that save you. It's not your
[57:52] good works that make you perfect.
[57:55] Because as soon as you do anything,
[57:59] &gt;&gt; as soon as you make a mistake or as soon
[58:00] as you do anything, Satan's right there
[58:02] as an accuser to say, "Aha,
[58:06] &gt;&gt; you ain't got the Holy Ghost.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; You didn't get nothing out of the
[58:09] meetings."
[58:10] &gt;&gt; If you were a real message believer, you
[58:12] would have never done that or said that
[58:14] or watched that or listened to that.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And what is he trying to do? He's trying
[58:19] to move you off the promise
[58:22] &gt;&gt; and get you to start looking at your own
[58:24] conduct as an evidence
[58:28] &gt;&gt; when brother Red is clearly showing that
[58:31] this age came and it said nothing but
[58:33] the blood in my own conduct. Now I
[58:34] believe in good conduct. If you are
[58:36] saved you will do righteously. We have
[58:38] already gone over that. But let me tell
[58:40] you now salvation is not Jesus plus.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; It is Jesus alone.
[58:48] Salvation is of the Lord.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; From start to finish, it is all God.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Let it be his life in me. Let it be his
[58:57] blood that cleanses me. Let it be his
[59:00] spirit that fills me. Let it be his word
[59:03] in my heart and mouth. Let it be his
[59:06] stripes that heal me. Let it be Jesus
[59:09] and Jesus alone. Not by works of
[59:12] righteousness which I have done. No,
[59:14] sir. Christ is my life. Can we establish
[59:18] that? That is not by our good works. I
[59:20] want to tell you, if your good works
[59:22] don't save you, then your bad works
[59:24] don't unsave you.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; I think I want to say that again. If
[59:31] your good works don't save you,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; your bad works don't unsave you.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Because it was never based on your
[59:39] works. It was based on the grace of God.
[59:43] Let it be his blood that cleanses me.
[59:45] Let it be his spirit that fills me. Let
[59:47] it be his word in my heart and my mouth.
[59:49] Let it be his stripes that heal me. Let
[59:51] it be Jesus and Jesus alone, not by
[59:54] works of righteousness which I have
[59:56] done. Oh, is there somebody that wants
[59:58] to thank God for Calvary and thank God
[1:00:01] for his grace and thank God for his
[1:00:03] mercy. That salvation is of God and
[1:00:06] salvation is of the Lord. It is Jesus
[1:00:08] Christ and Jesus alone. It is not Jesus
[1:00:12] plus my good works because I would have
[1:00:14] messed it up a long time ago, but it is
[1:00:17] Jesus and Jesus alone.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; But that devil, watch him. He's always
[1:00:26] right there
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; wanting to bring up an evil report.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; [crying]
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; But we want to lay that in there as a
[1:00:33] foundation to show that salvation is of
[1:00:36] the
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; how much you can be a good boy or girl.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; And in our text right here in in in
[1:00:46] verse 28, Numbers 13:20, it says,
[1:00:48] "Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[1:00:50] dwell on the land, and the cities are
[1:00:52] walled and very great. And moreover, we
[1:00:54] saw the children of Anoch there. The
[1:00:56] Amalocites dwell in the land of the
[1:00:57] south. And the Hittites and the
[1:00:58] Jebusites and the Amorites dwell in the
[1:01:00] mountains. And the Canaanites dwell by
[1:01:02] the sea and by the coast of Jordan.
[1:01:05] See what's see what's raising up. What
[1:01:07] are they doing?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; They're looking at the opposition.
[1:01:10] And many times when God does a work in
[1:01:12] your life
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; and you have a real experience with the
[1:01:15] Lord or you come out from meetings and
[1:01:17] now you're going into the battle,
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; the devil's right there to try to show
[1:01:22] you all the giants in the land and
[1:01:24] everything that you have to overcome and
[1:01:26] and maybe you come to the first test and
[1:01:28] you don't pass it. Well, I got news for
[1:01:31] you. Every son and daughter of God that
[1:01:33] comes to God must be tested.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; And they don't pass every test the first
[1:01:38] time.
[1:01:40] News
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; flash,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; You're not perfect by your works.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; And just because you fell a touch
[1:01:50] doesn't mean you didn't have a real
[1:01:51] experience with God.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; But what happens is we start to listen
[1:01:57] to the evil report.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; And Satan's always there to bring up an
[1:02:02] evil report. Listen to what the prophet
[1:02:04] said in redemption by judgment. He said,
[1:02:06] "And everything without faith is sin.
[1:02:09] Unbelief is absolutely sin. Everything
[1:02:12] that's not of faith is not of God. You
[1:02:14] must believe.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can have faith is
[1:02:19] first see what God said about it.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; And then believe his word. That's the
[1:02:26] only way you can do it.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can do that.
[1:02:32] I'm so glad that all I have to do is
[1:02:35] find out what God said about it and
[1:02:39] [screaming] believe his word. Believe
[1:02:42] his report.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; That's the only way you can do it.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; That means there's no other way to do
[1:02:51] it.
[1:02:54] So Joshua and Caleb knew that God had
[1:02:56] promised and they come back and they
[1:02:58] wasn't afraid to say we can take it
[1:03:02] because they based their faith
[1:03:05] not upon what they saw
[1:03:08] but what they believed.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; We are believers.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; We believe the message of the hour. We
[1:03:16] believe Malachi 4:5. We believe that we
[1:03:19] can do all things through Christ that
[1:03:21] strengthens us. So I'm not not looking
[1:03:23] at mistakes. I'm not looking at
[1:03:25] failures. I'm not looking at what I see.
[1:03:27] I'm looking at the promised word.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; But what happens? We start looking at
[1:03:33] the giants in the land. We we start
[1:03:36] looking at the opposition.
[1:03:38] And then what happens is we get we stop
[1:03:40] looking at the promise and we start
[1:03:41] looking at our ability.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Or we start looking at the symptoms and
[1:03:46] not God's promise.
[1:03:48] We we start to look at the opposition
[1:03:51] and not God's power, not God's promise.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; But the only way to do it is to look God
[1:03:56] look into God's word.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Believe that God said it.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; That's the only way that you can do it.
[1:04:07] So, exactly what Caleb and Joshua here
[1:04:09] the here the other people, they're
[1:04:11] coming up saying there ain't no way,
[1:04:14] you know, and and I kind of it kind of
[1:04:16] struck me a while back here. Here Joshua
[1:04:19] and Caleb, they go over there and
[1:04:20] they're going through the land and
[1:04:22] they're taking inventory.
[1:04:24] Yeah. You know, Joshua and Caleb walk in
[1:04:27] the land of and Caleb's over there
[1:04:28] going, "Look at that mountain. I want
[1:04:31] that mountain. That is going to be an
[1:04:33] awesome mountain because
[1:04:35] God give me the land. I want that
[1:04:37] mountain right there. And the other guys
[1:04:39] are walking by going, "Whoa, man. Get us
[1:04:41] away from that mountain. Can you see all
[1:04:43] the giants on that thing?"
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Here. They're in the same place and the
[1:04:48] 10 spies, they're doing inventory
[1:04:49] completely different.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Like, man, this is not a good place to
[1:04:53] be. There's no way. And Joshua and Caleb
[1:04:55] are walking through the land saying, "My
[1:04:56] goodness, give me I'll take that one.
[1:04:58] I'll take that one. I'll take this one
[1:05:00] over there." Because what were they
[1:05:01] doing? They weren't looking at the
[1:05:02] opposition. They were looking at the
[1:05:04] promise.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; In verse 30, it says, "And Caleb stealed
[1:05:08] the people before Moses and said, "Let
[1:05:10] us go up at once and possess it, for we
[1:05:15] are well able to overcome it." I I
[1:05:19] wonder, do we got some Joshua and
[1:05:20] Caleb's here tonight? Has some people
[1:05:23] come back from from the meetings and
[1:05:25] we've come back to the house of God and
[1:05:27] we know we got the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:29] Ghost and regardless of the excuses
[1:05:31] regardless of the giants that are in the
[1:05:33] land regardless of how bad it looks and
[1:05:35] how dark lady sea it is. We can look
[1:05:37] into God's divine promise and say I
[1:05:39] don't care how bad it looks. I don't
[1:05:40] care how dark it gets. I know that God
[1:05:43] has given me a promise and I am more
[1:05:45] than able to take the land. Regardless
[1:05:47] of the complaining, regardless of the
[1:05:49] excuses, regardless of everybody else
[1:05:51] walking away from the message,
[1:05:53] regardless of people compromising on the
[1:05:55] word of God and maybe preachers
[1:05:56] compromising on the word of God and
[1:05:58] people compromising on how they dress
[1:05:59] and what they listen to and and how they
[1:06:01] conduct themselves. But as for me in my
[1:06:03] house, we will serve the Lord. I will
[1:06:06] not make no excuse what I see in the
[1:06:08] message of the hour. I believe that God
[1:06:10] has come to perform his word in me and I
[1:06:12] got my eyes on the promise and I am more
[1:06:15] than able to do it. And what did Joshua
[1:06:17] and Caleb say? They said, "Let us go up
[1:06:19] at once." I say, "There ought to be
[1:06:21] something raising up in your heart right
[1:06:23] now." Say, "Let us go up right now." I'm
[1:06:25] not going to wait for Sunday. I'm not
[1:06:27] going to wait for Friday. I want to go
[1:06:29] right now. I want to take God in every
[1:06:31] promise. Take God in everything that
[1:06:33] he's promised. We're well more able to
[1:06:34] take the land.
[1:06:37] Hallelujah.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; We are well more able to take the land.
[1:06:45] Let us go up at once. And in possessing
[1:06:48] all things, this is the message that
[1:06:50] brother Brandham's actually referring to
[1:06:52] um that he's now uh bringing out uh
[1:06:55] preaching in a conflict between God and
[1:06:57] Satan. He's referring to when he
[1:06:59] preached possessing all things at the
[1:07:01] tabernacle. a when he struck this
[1:07:03] thought and after he struck the thought
[1:07:04] on the evidence of salvation, he said he
[1:07:06] went home and was just pacing back and
[1:07:08] forth. And so I I I got into that
[1:07:10] message and he says just what Joshua did
[1:07:12] for the children of Israel. Joshua means
[1:07:14] savior. The word Joshua and that's the
[1:07:16] same thing Jesus done for the church
[1:07:18] when they killed him. He conquered
[1:07:20] death. He conquered hell. He conquered
[1:07:21] the grave. And he rose up again with the
[1:07:24] evidence, the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:26] that there is a land beyond the river
[1:07:28] that they call the sweet forever. Amen.
[1:07:30] He come back and brought us the
[1:07:32] evidence. What does it do, brother
[1:07:33] Brandham? It makes you stop your lying,
[1:07:35] stealing, drinking, cursing, immorals,
[1:07:38] everything. It makes a new creature out
[1:07:39] of you. I who was once dead in sin and
[1:07:42] trespasses, nevertheless, I live, not
[1:07:43] me, but Christ lives in me. I'm a new
[1:07:46] creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. Heir to
[1:07:48] the promise. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That
[1:07:50] land belongs to us. How do you know it?
[1:07:52] Joshua rose from the dead, brought back
[1:07:54] the evidence of the Holy Ghost, and I
[1:07:56] got it. Amen. Glory. I'm an heir. A
[1:07:59] child of the king. A child of the king.
[1:08:02] Heir to all things. The Bible said. So
[1:08:04] look, we are possessors of all things.
[1:08:07] We've been given a promise.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; How do you know? I got the evidence. I
[1:08:11] got the proof.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; He rose from the dead and brought back
[1:08:15] the evidence, the Holy Ghost. And I got
[1:08:18] it.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; I said he rose from the dead and he came
[1:08:23] back with the evidence and I got it.
[1:08:27] Is there somebody here that can say, "I
[1:08:29] got it."
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Is there a young person here that can
[1:08:33] say, "I got it. He rose from the dead on
[1:08:36] the third day and he came back with the
[1:08:38] evidence and I got it." Oh, I want to
[1:08:41] say if there was ever something to shout
[1:08:43] about, if there was ever something to
[1:08:45] scream about, if there was ever
[1:08:47] something to be thankful for, if there
[1:08:48] was ever something to talk about is to
[1:08:50] say, "I got it.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; I got the Holy Ghost. I got the
[1:08:56] evidence. I got the proof of his
[1:08:59] resurrection. I got [screaming] it.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll give somebody here to say, I
[1:09:04] got it.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that's worth talking
[1:09:09] about.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; That's worth living for.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; That's worth something getting excited
[1:09:15] for. Look, we come out of meetings, is
[1:09:17] everybody charged or we already right
[1:09:19] back down?
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Bang. Didn't take long. Monday came and
[1:09:25] bang. Hey, sometimes it happens.
[1:09:29] But I'm so glad we're not looking at how
[1:09:30] we feel.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Every time you
[1:09:34] get a victory, you just watch, the
[1:09:35] devil's right there.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Every time you get a victory, every time
[1:09:39] you go to go to church meetings, every
[1:09:41] time something happens, every time you
[1:09:42] get a blessing, the devil's going to be
[1:09:43] right there.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You come into a test, you're going to
[1:09:46] come into a trial."
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, even a matter of fact,
[1:09:50] I think it's in that same sermon,
[1:09:51] conflict between God and Satan. says it
[1:09:52] just watch out. You're going to go have
[1:09:54] a have a meeting or have something and
[1:09:56] God's going to bless you and then all of
[1:09:57] a sudden you're going to go right into a
[1:09:59] hard time. It just happens every single
[1:10:00] time. Some of you been wondering why
[1:10:01] Monday was so hard. Now you know.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Some of you wondering why it was so hard
[1:10:05] to get to church on a Wednesday like now
[1:10:07] you know.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; He goes, "Well, the devil's always there
[1:10:10] trying to bring up an evil report. He's
[1:10:12] always trying to rob you of what God
[1:10:13] done for you."
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to tell you, it's just an
[1:10:16] opportunity to kick that dude in the
[1:10:17] face. Forgive me for being so graphic,
[1:10:19] but I don't like that devil and I don't
[1:10:21] like his lies. And every time he tries
[1:10:23] to come around and run his mouth, I just
[1:10:25] want to take the word and hit him with
[1:10:26] the word. Look, that's what the prophet
[1:10:28] of God told us to do in the greatest
[1:10:29] battle ever fought. You hit him with the
[1:10:30] word. And if he don't move, what do you
[1:10:32] do? Hit him again.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Why do you do that? Hit him again. Hit
[1:10:35] him again. Hit him. Hit him with that
[1:10:37] word.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Keep hitting them.
[1:10:43] said until you peek yourself out of the
[1:10:45] shell like the eagle that you are and
[1:10:47] then say hallelujah.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Where's the next one?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; That's how we ought to show up to
[1:10:53] church.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; But you know what, man? I had to chop up
[1:10:56] some demons on the way here. But glory
[1:10:58] to God, I showed up. Where's the next
[1:11:01] one? Oh, I see a little cloud over there
[1:11:04] hanging on my brother or sister. Let's
[1:11:05] get to praying. Let Let's break off the
[1:11:07] heavy bands. Let's get this cloud off
[1:11:09] the tabernacle. Some people have had a
[1:11:11] hard time. They've had a hard week. They
[1:11:13] come through Monday. They come through
[1:11:14] Tuesday. Brother Billy had to work the
[1:11:16] whole song service by himself
[1:11:17] practically. The musicians are wondering
[1:11:18] why it's a hard time. The preacher can
[1:11:20] hardly get anywhere. Well, maybe there's
[1:11:22] just a cloud hanging over the tab. But
[1:11:24] you know what? We are more than
[1:11:25] conquerors through Christ Jesus. We can
[1:11:27] go into faith. We can go into action. We
[1:11:29] can go into prayer and say, "Devil, you
[1:11:31] ain't going to get the victory. You're
[1:11:33] not going to win this battle. We are the
[1:11:35] sons and daughters of Almighty God. We
[1:11:37] come here to worship the Lord. We come
[1:11:39] here to praise our God. We come here to
[1:11:41] get the victory. We are more than able
[1:11:43] to do it. Let us go up at once. Let's
[1:11:45] chase every demon of doubt. Let's chase
[1:11:48] every fear. Let's chase every anxiety.
[1:11:50] Let's chase every away thing away from
[1:11:52] these believing children that have come
[1:11:54] to the house of God that they can be
[1:11:55] free to praise him. Free to worship
[1:11:57] them. Free to lift up their hands and
[1:11:59] say, "Praise [screaming] the Lord Jesus.
[1:12:01] Thank you for the victory. Thank you for
[1:12:03] life. Thank you for salvation. Thank you
[1:12:06] for saving me. Thank you for giving me
[1:12:08] my family. I know my son and my daughter
[1:12:10] might be out in the world, but Lord
[1:12:12] Jesus, I am a possessor of all things,
[1:12:15] the seen and the unseen. And I claim my
[1:12:17] baby girl. I claim my son in the name of
[1:12:20] the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan, you can't
[1:12:22] have them. You take your hands off of
[1:12:24] God's property. Take them. Take your
[1:12:26] hands off of the children of God. I am
[1:12:28] heir of all things. I am more than a
[1:12:31] conqueror through Jesus Christ.
[1:12:33] Hallelujah. We come with a faith like
[1:12:35] that. you start doing battle, start
[1:12:36] hitting that old devil with the There's
[1:12:38] no telling what God can do in a meeting
[1:12:40] like this if we'll just let our faith
[1:12:42] rise up beyond beyond our complexes and
[1:12:44] beyond who's behind the pulpit and who
[1:12:47] and our fears and and our wants and our
[1:12:49] desires and and what we think we want
[1:12:52] and what we think how things should be
[1:12:54] and just get into a heavenly place with
[1:12:55] Christ Jesus and say, "Lord Jesus, just
[1:12:58] have your will and way in me. I want to
[1:13:00] love you. I want to worship you. I want
[1:13:02] to praise you. Lord, may it be like a
[1:13:04] day of Pentecost where a rushing mighty
[1:13:06] wind might just sweep through the
[1:13:07] building. May it change hearts and
[1:13:09] change lives. Lord, may it deliver the
[1:13:11] bondage and the things that the children
[1:13:12] of God are going through. Lord, we
[1:13:14] haven't come here to play church. We've
[1:13:16] come here to see you, Lord. We've come
[1:13:18] here to see a God that's more than Abel.
[1:13:20] The same God of Isaac and Jacob and
[1:13:22] Abraham. The same God that was with
[1:13:24] Paul. The same God that was with John.
[1:13:27] The same God that was with Peter. He's
[1:13:28] the same God that was with brother
[1:13:30] Brandham. He's the same God that's right
[1:13:32] here in the tabernacle tonight. If we
[1:13:34] can just release our cares, release our
[1:13:37] desires, release our wants, and let the
[1:13:39] living God come down your aisle.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; I got [screaming] it.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I got the evidence.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I got the Holy [screaming] Ghost.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Some of us got more excited when we got
[1:13:59] our first car.
[1:14:05] I I was about to say some of us got more
[1:14:07] excited when we got our braces off, but
[1:14:09] I don't blame you.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; You feel like your mouth is finally
[1:14:13] free.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; But we get excited about things in the
[1:14:17] natural.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; I get excited about the Holy Ghost
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; because I got [screaming] it. See, if
[1:14:28] you ain't got it, there ain't nothing to
[1:14:30] be excited about.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; But when you got it,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; you know, we all get excited about maybe
[1:14:40] going on vacations and everything.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; We might get excited about we were we
[1:14:45] were promised something and all the
[1:14:46] expectation and all the anxiety and all
[1:14:49] the waiting to get there,
[1:14:52] but when you finally got it, Yes, sir.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; It's mine. Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; I got it. And you know what I love about
[1:14:59] the Holy Ghost, Brother Orlando?
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't no devil. Ain't no demon. Ain't no
[1:15:04] mistake. There ain't no failure. There's
[1:15:06] nothing that I can do that nothing can
[1:15:08] ever take it away from me.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; It's the evidence. It's the down
[1:15:15] payment.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You know, that's what the that's what
[1:15:18] the Holy Ghost is. was the down payment
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; to let you know there is a land beyond
[1:15:24] the river.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; We call the sweet forever. And if you
[1:15:28] got it, you're going.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; I said if you got it, you're going. So
[1:15:33] it really don't matter if your house is
[1:15:34] big or your house is small. If your car
[1:15:36] [screaming] runs or you don't your car
[1:15:38] don't run. If you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:40] you got everything because you are
[1:15:42] possessors. If you don't ever get to
[1:15:44] Italy on this side, it's already
[1:15:46] [screaming] yours. You own it.
[1:15:50] That should be a reality.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying what a prophet said.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all didn't even know that
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; you own it.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Ju just go back to school. Go back to
[1:16:11] work and say, "Did you know that I own
[1:16:13] Italy?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:16:18] Like what are you? God gave it to me.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Well, you turn over
[1:16:23] here. It's in my Bible somewhere.
[1:16:26] [snorts] Galatians
[1:16:28] Galatians 3 verse 29.
[1:16:32] And if you be Christ, then are ye
[1:16:34] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[1:16:37] the promise.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; I'm heir to all things.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; I'm actually heir to the things seen
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; and the things you can't see.
[1:16:48] And we don't even know what the Lord has
[1:16:50] in store for us.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; So when I say I got it, I really don't
[1:16:54] even know what I got. But I'm glad I got
[1:16:57] it
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; because I know if the prophet of God
[1:16:59] said if what we got would make us this
[1:17:01] happy down here,
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; wait till we get up there. How happy
[1:17:06] we'll be. Well, I'm just going to tell
[1:17:07] you what, I'm not going to wait to walk
[1:17:09] the streets of gold to shout and to
[1:17:10] praise God. I'm going to start it right
[1:17:12] now cuz I already got my ticket. I
[1:17:15] already got it. Look, people when they
[1:17:17] win bingo and they win the lottery, they
[1:17:20] don't wait to get excited. When they got
[1:17:22] the winning ticket, they say, "I got
[1:17:24] [screaming] it. I got it." They call
[1:17:26] their friends, they call their mama,
[1:17:28] they call their brothers. And you don't
[1:17:29] got to work no more. You don't have to
[1:17:32] worry about anything. Why? What are you
[1:17:34] talking about? I won [screaming] the
[1:17:35] lottery. I got the winning numbers.
[1:17:37] Well, is there people here on a
[1:17:39] Wednesday night? You might have not won
[1:17:41] the lottery. You might not have a
[1:17:43] million dollars, but you got the
[1:17:45] evidence of the Holy Ghost shot up in
[1:17:47] your bone. You're a possessor of all
[1:17:49] things of heaven and earth, things seen
[1:17:51] and unseen. And you want to say, "I got
[1:17:54] it." [screaming]
[1:17:56] [applause and cheering]
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; We got it.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:04] I once was lost,
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; but now I'm found.
[1:18:10] I once was blind, [screaming]
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; but now I see.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not re rejoicing because devils are
[1:18:20] subject to me. I'm rejoicing because my
[1:18:22] name is written in heaven. I came from
[1:18:26] God and I'm going back to God.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; But brother Matthew, I don't feel really
[1:18:34] well. I actually feel terrible.
[1:18:38] Sounds like you're a Christian.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; What? Yeah. Christians go through hard
[1:18:44] times.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; They go through struggles. They go
[1:18:48] through heartaches. But it don't it's
[1:18:50] not based on how you feel.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; It's not based on what you see. It's
[1:18:56] based on what he said and if you
[1:18:59] believe.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet of God said in
[1:19:03] end time signed. He said when the word
[1:19:05] came to Mary, she never doubted it. She
[1:19:08] said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord.
[1:19:11] Be it unto me according to thy word."
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; I'll just read it. It's fine, brothers.
[1:19:17] Be Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be
[1:19:19] it unto me according to thy word. See,
[1:19:22] she never said, "Now you wait till I
[1:19:26] feel life
[1:19:28] and then I'll go testify.
[1:19:31] You wait till I'm positive of it. That's
[1:19:34] the way we Christians so-called today
[1:19:36] do.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Wait till I'm positive. Wait till I
[1:19:40] begin to get better.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Wait till I see something happen and
[1:19:44] then I'll do it. No, sir. That's not the
[1:19:48] question.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; You believe first.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would go on and say
[1:19:54] that's exactly what happened to Elijah
[1:19:56] with with the the with the widow woman.
[1:19:59] He said, "Go bake me a cake first." He
[1:20:03] said, "You put the word first, then
[1:20:05] watch the miracle."
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the question isn't if
[1:20:10] you feel it. The question is if you
[1:20:12] believe. That's exactly what he had to
[1:20:14] teach John Ryan. John Ryan came through
[1:20:16] and he said, "So you you you he goes, I
[1:20:19] believe." He goes, "Okay, you're healed
[1:20:20] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:20:21] John Ryan was blind. He come back and
[1:20:23] said, "I thought you said I was healed."
[1:20:25] He said, "I thought you said you
[1:20:26] believe."
[1:20:28] He said, "I do believe this. Then go
[1:20:29] testify." He didn't walk off the
[1:20:32] platform said, "That's just a false
[1:20:33] prophet." He said, "I was healed and I
[1:20:35] can't even see a thing." But John Ryan
[1:20:37] was a real believer. He went down to his
[1:20:40] work. He went down to his job. He
[1:20:42] actually sat back up in the church. And
[1:20:44] he actually, as the word was going
[1:20:47] forth, he said, "Praise [screaming]
[1:20:49] God, I'm healed."
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Preacher went on a little bit longer and
[1:20:53] he was just sitting there. He said,
[1:20:55] "Praise [screaming] God, I'm healed."
[1:20:58] The ushers or or the deacons were
[1:20:59] actually looking to brother Brandham
[1:21:01] because they were going to go shut tell
[1:21:02] him to be quiet. And brother Brandham,
[1:21:04] you know what he said? He said, "Just
[1:21:05] leave him alone." You see, sometimes
[1:21:07] it's okay to get out of order if you're
[1:21:09] going to get saved. Sometimes it's okay
[1:21:11] to get out of order if you're going to
[1:21:13] get the blessing. Sometimes it's just
[1:21:15] all right. Here's a prophet saying, "Let
[1:21:17] the man testify." He didn't get healed
[1:21:19] there in the meeting. He didn't get
[1:21:21] healed maybe the next day, but one day
[1:21:23] he was sitting in that barber chair and
[1:21:25] the world and all them were scoffing and
[1:21:27] making fun of him and say, "Listen to
[1:21:28] this old guy. He thinks he's going in a
[1:21:30] rapture. He thinks he's going in a body
[1:21:32] change. He thinks he's the bride of
[1:21:34] Jesus Christ. He thinks in a moment, in
[1:21:36] a twinkling of an eye, he's going to be
[1:21:38] changed." And he said, "Praise
[1:21:40] [screaming] God, I'm healed." And his
[1:21:41] eyes come open. He come running out the
[1:21:44] barber shop and down the street with
[1:21:46] with shaving cream flying off his face.
[1:21:48] And here come the barber with a razor in
[1:21:49] his hand saying, "Wait, come back."
[1:21:51] [screaming] Why? Because he took God at
[1:21:53] his word. Put the word first, then watch
[1:21:55] the miracle. The question is is, "Do you
[1:21:58] believe?" [screaming]
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I try to just move quickly and in along
[1:22:04] these lines.
[1:22:06] I want you to act like you've it's your
[1:22:09] first time to ever hear this.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; We've heard that said before
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; because sometimes things just become so
[1:22:16] common.
[1:22:18] And I'm going to read some really
[1:22:19] familiar stuff,
[1:22:21] but we're talking about whose report are
[1:22:24] you going to believe?
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Are you going to keep listening to the
[1:22:29] evil report that raises up?
[1:22:33] And and you'd be surprised
[1:22:36] that evil report doesn't uh
[1:22:39] it may it maybe doesn't come how you
[1:22:41] would think.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; It might come in a temptation.
[1:22:46] It might come pulling on your flesh.
[1:22:49] It might want you to listen to something
[1:22:51] or to like something or to give in
[1:22:53] something you've been delivered from or
[1:22:54] you've been believing to be delivered
[1:22:55] from. But if you allow that negativity,
[1:22:59] you don't want your flesh that you're
[1:23:01] bringing into subjection to take sides
[1:23:03] with that evil report.
[1:23:07] What you want to do is you want to
[1:23:08] rebuke that thing. Say, "Devil, I don't
[1:23:10] want nothing to do with it.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; You're going to try to tempt me to
[1:23:12] listen to worldly music. I'm going to
[1:23:14] praise the Lord. I I'm going to listen
[1:23:16] to a tape. I'm going to read my Bible.
[1:23:19] And if you realize you got a little too
[1:23:20] far and you already gave in, you know
[1:23:22] what to do. Don't finish the song.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Say, "What in the world am I doing? Lord
[1:23:28] Jesus, forgive me. I have fallen again.
[1:23:31] I plead the blood of Jesus Christ. Lord,
[1:23:33] give me the strength next time this old
[1:23:35] lion devil evil report wants to come
[1:23:37] around and try to tell me I even like
[1:23:39] this stuff. I don't like it, Lord. And
[1:23:41] if there's something in me that likes
[1:23:42] it, take it out of me because I want to
[1:23:44] be more like you, Lord Jesus. I'm not
[1:23:46] going to listen to the evil report. I'm
[1:23:48] going to listen to what you said in your
[1:23:50] word. I am more than a conqueror in
[1:23:52] Jesus Christ. I can do all things
[1:23:54] through Christ that strengthens me. You
[1:23:55] start looking at the promised word. Quit
[1:23:57] looking at how you got off sides. Quit
[1:23:59] looking at how it got your attention.
[1:24:01] Quit looking at the giants. Quit looking
[1:24:02] at all the things out there and start
[1:24:04] looking at the promise. Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; He says an invisible union says the real
[1:24:09] genuine eagles hear
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; my sheep know my voice.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; A stranger they they'll not follow. Why?
[1:24:17] It was put in there by predestination.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; You were fore orained
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; to a son of God.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; You were in God before the foundation of
[1:24:29] the world.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; That never gets old to me. I want to run
[1:24:35] around the church right now.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing his report?
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; What he said about you?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; You were for ordained to be a son of
[1:24:47] God. You were in God before the
[1:24:50] foundation of the world world.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Devil, you lose, I win.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz I was before you were.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm eternal.
[1:25:02] I'm as eternal as God was et as is
[1:25:04] eternal.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That means I can no more fail than God
[1:25:07] can fail.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; You are in God before the foundation.
[1:25:17] You're only manifested in this day
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; for his honor and glory.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; How can you do do it without honoring
[1:25:25] his word
[1:25:27] and stand with every word of God? Yes,
[1:25:29] sir. which you are a part of that word
[1:25:32] by predestination because look
[1:25:35] the God is the word you believe it
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; well then if he always was the word in
[1:25:42] the beginning was the word and if the
[1:25:43] word was God then you were in God
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; the word the part that you're you're to
[1:25:49] play was in God before the foundation of
[1:25:52] the world he seen you he knew you he
[1:25:56] predestinated you to it
[1:26:00] You notice how he said the part that you
[1:26:01] play.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Look, look what he said. He said the
[1:26:07] word the part that you're to play was in
[1:26:10] God before the foundation of the world.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; You're just manifested in this day and
[1:26:14] age to play your part.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I was thinking about that and I got
[1:26:18] preaching on that a little while ago.
[1:26:20] The part that you played. And I got to
[1:26:22] thinking about our church here. You
[1:26:23] know, one time we did a church play
[1:26:25] [snorts] and we and we, you know, we all
[1:26:27] picked out of all of our parts and
[1:26:28] everything and I and I always remember I
[1:26:30] believe Brother Towanda played the palm
[1:26:32] tree.
[1:26:33] Yeah. Everybody had a everybody had to
[1:26:35] play a part. Maybe it was you, brother
[1:26:37] Billy. I can't remember. It was
[1:26:38] somebody. Somebody had to play a palm
[1:26:40] tree. Somebody had to play the camels.
[1:26:42] Somebody had to play Isaac and Rebecca.
[1:26:44] Somebody had to play all these parts,
[1:26:45] right? But they were picked and they
[1:26:47] were given a script. And then when it
[1:26:49] came time for everybody to play out
[1:26:51] their part, they knew how they were to
[1:26:53] dress. They knew how they were to act.
[1:26:57] [snorts]
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing with you. God
[1:26:59] chose you to play your part. [screaming]
[1:27:03] [applause]
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times you pick out uh uh
[1:27:07] parts you because you know I remember I
[1:27:09] I I mentioned this at at Louisiana camp
[1:27:11] some years ago. Uh they did a play on
[1:27:14] David and Goliath. It was just a little
[1:27:15] play that was thrown together real fast.
[1:27:17] And so they needed a big tall guy. And
[1:27:18] of course they chose El brother Eli
[1:27:20] Arbaggast. You know, he was big old tall
[1:27:22] brother and he was going to be Goliath.
[1:27:24] And then they they chose they chose uh
[1:27:26] some some brother, you know, to be
[1:27:28] David. And then, you know, they needed a
[1:27:30] rock. Well, it just so happens that they
[1:27:33] chose Ma uh brother Matt Morris to be
[1:27:35] the rock. And I was thinking about that
[1:27:37] and I text him. I was like, man, I was
[1:27:38] just thinking about that how we did that
[1:27:40] play a long time ago and how, you know,
[1:27:42] uh you were the rock. And he texted me
[1:27:44] back and said, "Somebody had to do it."
[1:27:45] And actually got inspired. Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] Praise God. Somebody had to do it. And
[1:27:50] somebody had to be an overcomer in Lady
[1:27:52] Oia. Somebody had to look the part, act
[1:27:55] the part. And God chose you. You were
[1:27:57] actually that part in his mind before
[1:28:00] the world was ever formed. And he
[1:28:02] actually wrote out the whole script and
[1:28:03] he actually chose you. He knew how tall
[1:28:05] you would be. He knew how short you
[1:28:07] would be. He knew how wide you would be.
[1:28:09] He knew if you'd be prettier or you
[1:28:11] didn't think you were pretty. Look, I
[1:28:12] want to tell you, some of us got
[1:28:13] complexes and things hanging over our
[1:28:15] life. We don't think we're pretty
[1:28:16] enough. We don't think we're tall
[1:28:18] enough. We think we're all those things.
[1:28:19] That is a lying devil from the pits of
[1:28:21] hell. Look, if that be the truth with a
[1:28:23] nose this big, I should have given up a
[1:28:25] long time ago. But God knew exactly how
[1:28:27] big my nose would be. Amen.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Look, sometimes you got to make it funny
[1:28:33] because some people really wrestle with
[1:28:35] complexes and they they wish they didn't
[1:28:37] look the way they looked and they wish
[1:28:39] they were taller and they wish they
[1:28:40] weren't this this way and that way and
[1:28:42] and they hate the way they look. That is
[1:28:44] a lie from the pits of hell. God chose
[1:28:46] you. He ordained you. He wanted you to
[1:28:49] show up looking exactly the way you
[1:28:51] showed up. You are the very mind of God
[1:28:53] and thoughts of God. He said, "I want
[1:28:55] that one here in this day because just
[1:28:58] as Satan came into my Eden in the
[1:29:01] beginning and disrupted everything, I'm
[1:29:03] going to send my bride in the evening
[1:29:05] time and she's going to disrupt and tear
[1:29:07] down the gates of hell. I have chosen
[1:29:09] you for a part. It's time to play your
[1:29:11] part, church."
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Well, come on.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; You got the best part.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:26] You got the lead role.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; You know, every time we, you know,
[1:29:30] somebody does a song special or
[1:29:32] something, it's like, well, why why do
[1:29:34] they have to be the lead or why they
[1:29:35] have to do this? You know what? We all
[1:29:37] have a part to play.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; But he chose all of us to be the main
[1:29:42] character in the end time,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; He only has our hands as we yield our
[1:29:48] hands.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; He only has feet as we yield our feet.
[1:29:51] He only has a mouth as we yield our
[1:29:53] mouth.
[1:29:54] Where is Christ?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; He's in the bride. He's playing out his
[1:29:59] part through his bride.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; I say it's time to play our part.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll move quickly through these
[1:30:05] last quotes. We got to play our part.
[1:30:09] And we have to recognize that God chose
[1:30:11] you and picked you. Hand selected. Said,
[1:30:14] "I want you just the way you are
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; and I want you to play this part." He
[1:30:19] knew [clears throat] the whole family
[1:30:21] tree.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; He knew when you would be born and all
[1:30:25] of the things about your life. He knew
[1:30:26] the struggles. He knew the heartache. He
[1:30:28] knew everything that you would come
[1:30:29] through. What does he do? He's building
[1:30:31] you into the stature of a perfect man.
[1:30:35] Now, I could skip a few scriptures here,
[1:30:37] but you know, we know all things work
[1:30:39] together. I'll just read it really
[1:30:40] quick. Romans 8:28. We know that all
[1:30:42] things work together for good to them
[1:30:44] that love God,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; to them who are called according to his
[1:30:47] purpose. For whom he did forno, he also
[1:30:50] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:30:52] image of his son, that he might be the
[1:30:55] firstborn among many brethren. Now, now
[1:30:57] listen to this. These are these are
[1:30:59] scriptures that I I want to read again.
[1:31:02] You fight with this.
[1:31:05] You fight with the word of God,
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; the sword of the spirit. How did Jesus
[1:31:10] overcome? It is written.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; He taught us how to fight. So that when
[1:31:17] you're in the valley or you're going
[1:31:19] through the hard time, my Bible tells
[1:31:21] me, moreover, from whom he did
[1:31:22] predestinate
[1:31:24] them, he also called. Has God called
[1:31:26] you?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Is there somebody has God called you?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going try to do quick math here.
[1:31:31] About half of us. Has God called you?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to everybody. Has God called
[1:31:35] you?
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; There's somebody that wants to testify.
[1:31:37] Say, God called me.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; God call you? Did God call you?
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; God call you. that if God has called
[1:31:45] you,
[1:31:47] my Bible tells me
[1:31:50] who he's called, he's also justified.
[1:31:53] And whom he's justified, them, he is
[1:31:54] also glorified.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; And the evil report is always raising up
[1:32:01] to begile you of the evidence.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Well, no, you know, it you really can't.
[1:32:06] It's too big. It's too hard. You'll
[1:32:08] never get total victory. You're always
[1:32:10] going to struggle. You're always going
[1:32:11] to go through these things. Look, if if
[1:32:13] if you come to that place, you repent of
[1:32:16] your sins, you say, "Lord, I may be fail
[1:32:18] again. I thought I had victory over this
[1:32:20] thing, but Lord, I know one thing. You
[1:32:22] called me.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you who started the work,
[1:32:27] you're just and faithful to finish it.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to get my eyes back on the
[1:32:31] promise.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to quit looking at looking at
[1:32:34] how I got off track. And I'm going to
[1:32:35] look back at the word." So, this is
[1:32:37] where I just want to end on these couple
[1:32:38] quotes
[1:32:40] because I I I just want to what was on
[1:32:42] my heart was just to take a moment to
[1:32:47] have us believe his report.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Invisible union. He the bridegroom took
[1:32:53] away your shame.
[1:32:56] You can put that up, brothers. Paragraph
[1:32:58] 262. Invisible union.
[1:33:01] He the bridegroom took away your shame
[1:33:04] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness.
[1:33:06] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:33:08] and the blood of life.
[1:33:11] That's what the Bible said. Your first
[1:33:14] husband that you are married to the
[1:33:16] world, the anointed bridegroom which for
[1:33:19] ordained you has washed you by the
[1:33:21] washing of the water.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Now, I like to take some time right
[1:33:26] there, but I won't. But you know that
[1:33:28] that first nature, that's your first
[1:33:29] husband that has to die. Paul said, "I
[1:33:32] die daily." When you're born again and
[1:33:34] filled with the Holy Spirit, that first
[1:33:35] nature, that's what you were you first
[1:33:38] married to. Brother Brandon saying your
[1:33:39] first husband that you were married to
[1:33:40] the world, the anointed bridegroom which
[1:33:43] fordained you has washed you by the
[1:33:44] washing of the water by the church,
[1:33:50] by your good works,
[1:33:54] by by how many times you went to church
[1:33:56] in a row.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:34:02] What does he say? No, that don't sound
[1:34:04] right. You might find that in the
[1:34:07] almanac, but not in God's Bible.
[1:34:10] By the washing of the water by the word
[1:34:13] in the word. You are standing completely
[1:34:16] justified as though you never did it at
[1:34:19] the beginning. I I I say what a report.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; What a report.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; What a message.
[1:34:30] Now, has it become so common to us
[1:34:34] that that it just we just breeze right
[1:34:37] over it? We've just heard it so many
[1:34:39] times that ought to produce such a love
[1:34:41] in us for the Lord.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; That if he did that for us,
[1:34:47] we'll serve him with all of our heart.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; We'll want to have good works.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; We'll want to abstain from evil, the
[1:34:54] appearance of evil.
[1:34:56] He says, "You are the pure, virtuous,
[1:34:58] sinless bride of the son of the living
[1:35:00] God." Every man and woman that's born of
[1:35:02] the spirit of God and washed in the
[1:35:04] blood of Jesus Christ and believes every
[1:35:06] word of God stands as though you never
[1:35:07] sinned at the first place. You're
[1:35:10] perfect.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask the musicians to come.
[1:35:15] That evil report's always trying to
[1:35:18] offer you something that the word didn't
[1:35:21] say you were.
[1:35:24] I say, "I want to believe his report.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I I I I'm I'm done listening to the
[1:35:30] devil. I'm done with his lies."
[1:35:34] He does care.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; He does want you to give him all your
[1:35:39] heart.
[1:35:43] I like how Brother Brandham said, "The
[1:35:45] only thing you have to do then is have
[1:35:46] faith in what you are." Have faith in
[1:35:49] what the word says you are. And I'll
[1:35:52] just end on this. This was kind of my
[1:35:53] inspiration here.
[1:35:56] Out of Christ, the mystery of God
[1:35:57] revealed. Brother brother brother Tom
[1:35:58] just ended uh he was ending his sermon
[1:36:01] and ending the meetings uh with these
[1:36:04] quotes right here. Brother Brandham says
[1:36:06] this in 594 says, "Justified in his
[1:36:09] sight." Why are we justified? We are his
[1:36:11] victory. The church is his victory. We
[1:36:15] come forth in the last days with this
[1:36:17] glorious gospel showing his victory. He
[1:36:20] died for this purpose and we are proof
[1:36:23] of his victory.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; You,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; you are the proof
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; of his victory.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; You are the proof of the message of the
[1:36:35] hour.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; You are the proof of his resurrection.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; You are the proof.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see his coming down and
[1:36:49] living among the church, that's his
[1:36:51] victory. Shows that he couldn't keep him
[1:36:52] in the grave. Neither can he keep us.
[1:36:54] That's right. We are we are bound,
[1:36:56] right? And we're already potentially
[1:36:58] arised because we've raised from the
[1:37:00] dead unbelief in his word from
[1:37:02] denominational creeds to an eternal word
[1:37:03] of the eternal God which is in himself
[1:37:06] working through us, manifesting himself
[1:37:08] that he is the same yesterday, today,
[1:37:11] and forever.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; That's his report.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; That's the report I'm going to believe.
[1:37:16] Amen.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection.
[1:37:19] I am his victory.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Why don't we all stand?
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, that devil, he comes around and he
[1:37:27] starts to [music] to bring up the evil
[1:37:29] report and tries to start telling you
[1:37:32] all of those things.
[1:37:34] My Bible says, "Arise and shine,
[1:37:38] for the glory of the Lord has risen upon
[1:37:40] you."
[1:37:43] I said, "Arise and shine. Rise out of
[1:37:45] the muck and mire of Lady Osia.
[1:37:48] You're not in the chicken yard anymore.
[1:37:50] You're seated in heavenly places in
[1:37:52] Christ Jesus. You got your eyes on the
[1:37:55] promise. I am the proof of his
[1:37:56] resurrection. I am his victory. We got
[1:38:00] the devil's answer.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Couldn't keep him in the grave. He can't
[1:38:04] keep us in the grave. Why? Because I got
[1:38:06] it. I got the evidence. I might make a
[1:38:09] misstep. I might fall. But I'm going to
[1:38:11] get right back up again because my eyes
[1:38:13] are on the promise. I am going in a
[1:38:15] rapture. I'm going in a body change. I
[1:38:18] don't care if I have a good day, bad
[1:38:19] day, no day, up, down day. It doesn't
[1:38:22] matter. Why? Because I got my eyes on
[1:38:24] the promise of God. I am what he said I
[1:38:27] am. I am the very proof of his
[1:38:30] resurrection. I am his victory. I say
[1:38:32] that ought to make you act different.
[1:38:34] That ought to make you live different.
[1:38:35] That ought to make you talk different.
[1:38:39] Why don't we just bow our heads? Lord
[1:38:41] Jesus, we love you.
[1:38:42] We're thankful that we could be in your
[1:38:44] presence, Lord, just to come one more
[1:38:46] time and gather around your word, Lord.
[1:38:48] I know it's just a simple sermon. We
[1:38:51] just wanted to [music] encourage the
[1:38:53] people to believe your report, Lord.
[1:38:56] Lord, when we can catch that revelation
[1:38:58] of justification, that we never did it
[1:39:02] in the first place,
[1:39:04] that we're justified.
[1:39:07] Lord, that kind of love, that kind of
[1:39:09] redemption. Lord, it sets us free from
[1:39:11] our our [music] past and we don't have
[1:39:14] to worry about mistakes and failures.
[1:39:16] Lord, it gives us the confidence and the
[1:39:18] reassurance and the faith to know that
[1:39:21] we can do all things through Christ that
[1:39:23] strengthens us. That we can just keep
[1:39:25] our eye on the promise and know that
[1:39:27] we're being built up in the stature of a
[1:39:29] perfect man. that this is the hour of
[1:39:31] adoption and the placing of sons and we
[1:39:34] don't have to worry about old baggage
[1:39:36] and wonder [music] if we've been
[1:39:39] forgiven or wrestle with if we're good
[1:39:42] enough. Lord, you said that we're
[1:39:44] perfect.
[1:39:46] Then Lord, if you said we're perfect,
[1:39:49] Lord, I'm going to believe your report.
[1:39:51] Lord, I won't listen to that evil report
[1:39:53] that raises up and tries to pull me away
[1:39:56] from your promised word. Lord, I'm just
[1:39:58] going to surrender to your word that you
[1:39:59] can have the preeminence. Lord, I love
[1:40:02] you. Just thank you for your word.
[1:40:03] [music]
[1:40:04] Just ask your blessings on the people
[1:40:05] now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:40:08] Amen.
[1:40:11] I've been liking that song. I wasn't
[1:40:13] made to be tended in a grave. I was
[1:40:15] called by name. Let's try to sing that.
[1:40:22] I need help with this song. I know who I
[1:40:26] am
[1:40:29] cuz I know who you are.
[1:40:34] The cross of [music] salvation
[1:40:39] was only the start. [music]
[1:40:45] Now I am chosen.
[1:40:50] Free [music] and forgiven.
[1:40:54] I have a [music and singing] future
[1:40:59] and it's worth [music] living.
[1:41:06] I wasn't made [music and singing] to be

[1:41:13] Born and raised [music] back to life
[1:41:16] again.
[1:41:18] I was made.
[1:41:25] So [music] why would [singing] I lay a
[1:41:28] bed in my shame when a fountain of
[1:41:31] [music and singing] grace was running my
[1:41:34] way? I know I am yours and I was made
[1:41:40] for more. [music]
[1:41:44] I know [singing] who I am. Cuz
[1:41:48] [music] I know who you are.
[1:41:53] The cross [music and singing] of
[1:41:54] salvation
[1:41:58] was only strong.
[1:42:04] Now I'm [music] chosen,
[1:42:08] free and forgiven. [music]
[1:42:13] I have a future
[1:42:16] [music]
[1:42:18] and it's worth living.
[1:42:24] I was made [music]
[1:42:26] to be dead in the grave. I was called by
[1:42:30] name, born and [music] raised back to
[1:42:34] life again.
[1:42:37] I was made [music] for more.
[1:42:44] So why would I make [music]
[1:42:46] a bed in my shame when a fountain of
[1:42:50] grace is running my [music and singing]
[1:42:52] way? I know I am yours I was made for.
[1:43:00] [music]
[1:43:02] I know who I am.
[1:43:07] [music] I know who you are.
[1:43:12] The cross of salvation [music]
[1:43:16] was [singing] only the strong.
[1:43:22] Now I am
[1:43:26] [music]
[1:43:27] free and
[1:43:32] I have a future [music]
[1:43:36] and it's worth living. Oh sing with all
[1:43:40] your heart. Oh, and [music and singing]
[1:43:43] I was made to be tending grave. I was
[1:43:47] [music] called [singing] by
[1:43:50] born
[1:43:52] back to life again.
[1:43:55] I was [music] ready to go.
[1:44:02] Why would I [music] make
[1:44:05] my shame when I found your grace
[1:44:10] running my [music and singing] way? I
[1:44:11] know I am yours. I was faithful.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that. Don't you? I was
[1:44:21] made for more. Amen. [music]
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Now, wasn't that wonderful tonight?
[1:44:25] Praise the Lord. Just that should just
[1:44:28] lift your spirits right up. In fact,
[1:44:29] that was so good. I'm going to repreach
[1:44:31] it Sunday morning
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to have a different title.
[1:44:36] I'm going to call it
[1:44:39] faith in the accusation.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Same message because God's wanting us to
[1:44:47] hear it.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; God's wanting it to sink in. Yes, sir.
[1:44:52] [music]
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; You know, when you teach something,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; this is how you teach it. You tell them
[1:44:59] what you're going to tell them.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You tell them
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; and then you tell them what you told
[1:45:05] them.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Now, Matthew told you what he's going to
[1:45:09] tell you. I'm going to tell it again
[1:45:12] Sunday and somebody's going to come and
[1:45:15] tell it to again until we get to the
[1:45:18] place that we quit listening to the
[1:45:23] devil.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Just that simple.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Let's pray for brother Matthew. He's
[1:45:31] going this weekend uh to uh Arkansas,
[1:45:35] right? Brother Jason Jackson. Preaching
[1:45:37] for brother Jason Jackson.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; May that word that he maybe that's on
[1:45:41] his heart. I I I was hoping you would
[1:45:44] have shared that with us out of that uh
[1:45:47] AI.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want you to listen to this. You
[1:45:51] got one second. You can you got to hear
[1:45:53] this. This is good. [music] Let's sit
[1:45:55] down. Just five minutes. Come here and
[1:45:57] share this.
[1:46:01] No, this this excites me. But anyway,
[1:46:03] that's just me. Forgive me. I you know
[1:46:06] I'm I'm 76. I'm entering into my second
[1:46:10] childhood and and I got a scripture for
[1:46:13] it. So unless you become like children,
[1:46:16] you shall not enter the kingdom of
[1:46:18] heaven.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. But anyway, this go just take it
[1:46:22] right there.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; You got you got me. Here we go. All
[1:46:24] right.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; So, let me see if I can uh um
[1:46:30] I I I just, you know, don't don't get
[1:46:32] too far out on this, but it's it's
[1:46:34] sometimes you want to see what's out
[1:46:35] there. So I I asked chat GBT, did
[1:46:38] William Brandon preach the truth?
[1:46:40] And he and and and this is it it
[1:46:44] actually came up and it said whether
[1:46:46] William Brandon preached the truth
[1:46:48] depends on what you mean by truth and
[1:46:51] which standard you measure him by.
[1:46:54] People generally fall into three
[1:46:56] categories.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Those who believe he preached the truth.
[1:47:04] Amen.
[1:47:07] The believer
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; those who be those who believed he did
[1:47:11] not preach the well the other one is
[1:47:13] those who pre believe he preached the
[1:47:15] truth and some truth
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; make believers those who believe he did
[1:47:20] not preach the truth but this is what
[1:47:24] blew my mind but here's the real
[1:47:26] question for you Matthew
[1:47:30] are you asking because you're wrestling
[1:47:32] with doubts
[1:47:34] you want confirmation of what you
[1:47:36] already believe you're comparing what he
[1:47:38] taught with scripture. You want an
[1:47:40] objective historical answer. Your motive
[1:47:43] changes how I should answer you.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Wow."
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll let you.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that something? So, he asked
[1:47:55] AI and he said, "Well, it depends. Do
[1:47:58] you believe?" There's three categories
[1:48:00] of people.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; People that believe everything he says.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the believer,
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; right? People that don't listen to
[1:48:08] nothing
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; else.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; People that believe some of what he says
[1:48:14] is true
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; and some isn't
[1:48:17] lukewarm
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; make believer
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; and some that don't believe anything he
[1:48:23] says at all.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Unbeliever that come out of a robot.
[1:48:31] We don't want no
[1:48:33] unbelief.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand back up again cuz now
[1:48:41] I'll get to preaching.
[1:48:43] Amen. I I I I like that. That that
[1:48:47] that's so good. We've got a a a fabulous
[1:48:50] land that is ours. You know what we call
[1:48:53] that land? It's called the promised
[1:48:55] land.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; The land of promise. I am bound for the
[1:49:00] promised land. I We're all bound for the
[1:49:04] promised land. And the deeper we enter
[1:49:07] into the promised land, the more
[1:49:09] promises we find out that are there for
[1:49:12] us. And the more promises we have, the
[1:49:15] more we can take those promises and do
[1:49:18] what brother Matthew says and just kick
[1:49:20] them in the teeth, hit them with promise
[1:49:22] after promise after promise. Brother
[1:49:25] Bram says in he said state Satan come in
[1:49:29] in greatest battle ever fought he said
[1:49:31] Satan come in like a bunch of
[1:49:33] stormtroopers
[1:49:34] you know ready to take the country and
[1:49:37] he said the word of God cut them to
[1:49:39] rivens
[1:49:40] let's take the promises of God and let's
[1:49:43] sing this for our dismissal song I am
[1:49:45] bound for the promised land amen how
[1:49:49] many is bound for the promised land
[1:49:51] doesn't matter that we're standing on
[1:49:53] stormy Jordan dank It doesn't matter. We
[1:49:56] got a wishful eye. We're going
[1:49:58] somewhere. I made for more. I'm gonna
[1:50:01] become more.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; I There's victory for me to have. It's
[1:50:05] prophesied for me to have it. I'm going
[1:50:08] to go forward and believe it. I'm going
[1:50:10] to believe what is promised to me.
[1:50:13] What's given to me and I'm not going to
[1:50:16] look at any of the obstacles cuz he who
[1:50:19] is in me is greater than he who is in
[1:50:22] the world. God bless you. Pray for
[1:50:23] Matthew. Andrew, are you going this
[1:50:25] weekend, too? Denver this weekend?
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Next. Okay. Andrew will be going to
[1:50:30] Denver next weekend. So, let's keep him
[1:50:32] in prayer. Let's say it. God bless you.
