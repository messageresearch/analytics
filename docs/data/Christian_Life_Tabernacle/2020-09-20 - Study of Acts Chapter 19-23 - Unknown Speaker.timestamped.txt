[15:20] amen certainly thankful that god will
[15:22] give us the opportunity
[15:24] amen let's invite brother mike for a
[15:25] psalm reading this morning god bless you
[15:38] amen
[15:45] that is a much longer walk
[15:49] good morning so you know we
[15:54] we all know the the story of david and
[15:56] goliath you know where
[15:57] we're taught that story many of us from
[16:00] the time that we're
[16:01] knee-high you know what
[16:04] you know here you have a young man still
[16:07] a boy
[16:08] before he'd ever been on the throne or
[16:10] before he'd ever run a kingdom or before
[16:12] he'd ever fought in any battles
[16:15] he's facing this giant
[16:18] you know the thing is is the giant never
[16:20] saw this coming
[16:22] you know when the giant came before the
[16:24] children of israel david was not even in
[16:26] the picture
[16:27] he was out there targeting their
[16:29] mightiest soldier
[16:31] their king that stood head and shoulders
[16:33] above all
[16:34] and he was expecting to show with force
[16:37] of strength
[16:38] how he could overcome with strength this
[16:41] challenge and what steps out is a little
[16:44] boy with a sling
[16:46] and he's just like are you kidding me
[16:49] i'm gonna squash you like a bug
[16:52] but you know the thing is is we know the
[16:53] story david wins a big victory there but
[16:57] from that moment on there's a target on
[17:00] his back
[17:01] from the moment he takes that stand
[17:03] against the giant
[17:05] he begins to be a target of the entire
[17:07] bloodline of that giant
[17:09] and his family while they weren't
[17:11] looking for him the first time
[17:13] they were looking for him from that time
[17:15] for the rest of his life
[17:16] after that you know you can read the
[17:19] account in second samuel
[17:21] 21 about how one by one
[17:24] each members of that giant's family came
[17:28] to try to take him out because he had
[17:30] made a stand against the giant
[17:33] you know and one by one many times with
[17:36] the help of others
[17:38] he overcame each time that giant came
[17:40] came around
[17:41] defeated him giant would raise up he
[17:42] would defeat him the giant would raise
[17:44] up and he would defeat him
[17:46] until finally toward the end of his life
[17:50] when that final giant was defeated for
[17:52] the final time
[17:55] david begins to raise his voice in a
[17:57] song of praise and the entire
[17:59] chapter of second samuel 22 is him
[18:02] praising the lord
[18:04] for the final defeat over the giant in
[18:06] the bloodline
[18:08] of that giant and he says an interesting
[18:10] thing in in second samuel 22 49 he says
[18:13] thou
[18:14] also has lifted me up on high
[18:18] above them that rose up against me thou
[18:20] has delivered me
[18:22] from the violent man
[18:25] you know after this entire lifeline
[18:29] of doing battle with assyria with that
[18:32] giant in his kin
[18:35] david sums that up as his battle with
[18:38] the violent man
[18:40] that's how he describes it you know
[18:42] unlike
[18:43] david from the very first moment
[18:47] that we take a stand against that giant
[18:51] that stands in in our flesh that big old
[18:55] pile of meat and bones that would
[18:57] through force of strength
[18:59] try to push us and pressure us and crush
[19:02] us
[19:02] from that life that was in it is in us
[19:04] but from the time that we first
[19:06] stand up there is a constant target on
[19:10] our back
[19:11] until we defeat that giant for the thing
[19:13] david speaks about quite a bit
[19:15] in psalm 140 verse 1 he says deliver me
[19:18] o lord
[19:19] from the evil man preserve me from the
[19:23] violent man
[19:25] in verse 4 he says preserve me from the
[19:28] violent man
[19:29] who would who have purposed to overthrow
[19:32] my goings
[19:33] so this violent man is defined by a very
[19:36] specific purpose
[19:37] to overthrow my goings in psalm 86 14 he
[19:41] says the assemblies of violent men have
[19:43] sought after my soul
[19:45] not my body my soul
[19:48] and in proverbs 16 29 a violent man
[19:51] enticeth his neighbor
[19:53] and leadeth him into the way that is not
[19:56] good
[19:56] so you have the characteristic of this
[19:58] pressure of
[20:00] the meat and bones of our flesh that
[20:01] would seek to entice us
[20:03] to draw away to crush our soul to
[20:05] overthrow our goings that giant
[20:08] that each of us must do battle with from
[20:10] the very first time we step
[20:12] out to challenge its power
[20:15] you know i think that the prayer of each
[20:17] of us would be like david in psalm 140
[20:21] deliver me from my violent man right and
[20:24] just like some
[20:25] in second samuel 22 you know the lord
[20:28] has
[20:29] anointed us to defeat that man that's
[20:32] right
[20:32] he has quickened us to overcome and just
[20:36] like david said in second samuel 22
[20:38] the lord liveth and blessed be my rock
[20:42] and exalted be the god of the rock of my
[20:46] salvation and that bringeth
[20:47] bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou
[20:50] also has
[20:50] lifted me up on high above them that
[20:53] rose up against me
[20:55] one he like david who had a victory over
[20:57] his violent man were also promised that
[20:59] same victory
[21:00] so when you make that first stand
[21:02] welcome to the battle
[21:04] and we also have a promise that we'll
[21:06] overcome so as we read psalm 140 today
[21:09] and it speaks of the violent man
[21:11] let's consider the struggle that we're
[21:12] in the victory that were promised
[21:14] and that the violent man the giant in
[21:16] our life represents
[21:18] a clue that we're in a victorious battle
[21:21] let's read that together psalm 140
[21:24] deliver me
[21:25] o lord from the evil man preserve me
[21:28] from the violent man which imagine
[21:30] mischiefs in their heart
[21:32] continually are they gathered together
[21:35] for war
[21:36] they have sharpened their tongues like a
[21:38] serpent adder's poison is under their
[21:40] lips
[21:41] say them keep me o lord from the hands
[21:44] of the wicked
[21:45] preserve me from the violent man who
[21:48] have purpose to overthrow my goings
[21:51] the proud have hid his snare for me and
[21:53] courts
[21:54] they have spread a net by the wayside
[21:56] they have set jinns for me
[21:58] selah i said unto the lord thou art my
[22:02] god
[22:03] hear the voice of my supplications o
[22:05] lord
[22:06] o god the lord the strength of my
[22:08] salvation
[22:09] thou hast covered my head in the day of
[22:12] battle
[22:13] grant not o lord the desires of the
[22:15] wicked
[22:16] further not his wicked device lest they
[22:19] exalt themselves
[22:20] say look as for the head of those that
[22:23] compass me about
[22:24] let the mischief of their own lips cover
[22:26] them
[22:27] let burning coals fall upon them let
[22:30] them be cast into the fire
[22:32] into deep pits that they rise not up
[22:35] again
[22:36] let not an evil speaker be established
[22:38] in the earth
[22:39] evil shall hunt the violet man to
[22:42] overthrow him
[22:43] i know the lord will maintain the cause
[22:45] of the afflicted
[22:47] and the right of the poor surely the
[22:49] righteous
[22:50] shall give thanks unto thy name the
[22:52] upright
[22:53] shall dwell in thy presence
[22:58] amen god bless you may be seated amen at
[23:01] this time again
[23:12] good morning amen
[23:15] uh we i want to bring you up to date on
[23:18] a few
[23:18] uh uh
[23:22] events and things that are transpiring
[23:26] in the church so uh we'll all have kind
[23:29] of
[23:29] a clear understanding of what we're
[23:32] doing as we're going forward
[23:35] as you know we've been dealing with the
[23:39] city of bedford for over a couple years
[23:43] trying to get a building permit and
[23:47] have our properties become one property
[23:50] well we're in the very final stage of
[23:53] that now
[23:55] we've turned in all the
[23:58] paperwork and everything that they need
[24:01] to what is referred to as platting
[24:05] the property so the lot next door
[24:09] and this lot will now become one
[24:12] property the property is owned by the
[24:15] church
[24:16] it is not owned by me i had purchased
[24:20] both properties
[24:21] but i have donated both of the
[24:23] properties to the church so the church
[24:26] owns the property the the
[24:30] churches governed by a set of bylaws
[24:35] that we have written that
[24:38] govern our church we have bylaws that
[24:40] everybody
[24:43] that's how we operate our is by our
[24:45] church bylaws
[24:47] the trustee board has a certain
[24:49] responsibility
[24:50] and the deacon board has a certain
[24:55] responsibility and so what we've been
[24:58] trying to do of course is
[24:59] have a place where we can sit and
[25:03] have space and have room for our
[25:05] children and
[25:06] and have sunday school classrooms and
[25:09] and uh and you say well isn't the lord
[25:13] coming yes but we're going to plant our
[25:14] potatoes
[25:15] we're going to be diligent in doing what
[25:18] we
[25:19] should do so
[25:22] we're and in in the process of
[25:25] doing that what that we're doing
[25:28] is is we're preparing for
[25:32] the future so we're making
[25:35] accommodations now
[25:37] in decisions now for what is going
[25:40] to take place in the future
[25:43] we have always been and i personally
[25:46] have always been
[25:48] someone that was reactionary another as
[25:51] a problem would come up i would react a
[25:53] problem would come up
[25:55] and i would react i never really
[25:57] believed much
[25:58] in preventive maintenance i believe when
[26:02] it
[26:02] finally wore out then deal with it
[26:05] but that's not always the best way to
[26:08] perceive so well in in our effort to
[26:11] prepare for the future
[26:14] we've undertaken a lot of different
[26:17] programs or different uh uh
[26:24] challenges that we're facing one of them
[26:27] is we're going to redo
[26:28] our complete sound system redo
[26:31] all our technology redo our website
[26:35] and just try to bring everything up to a
[26:39] better point brother mike parks has
[26:44] been placed in charge of coordinating
[26:47] all that effort
[26:48] with the sound people the technical
[26:50] people
[26:51] the deacons the musicians the ministry
[26:55] and building for us an internet
[26:58] a sound system and
[27:02] the technical things that all involve
[27:06] you know i'm not very technical so i'm
[27:09] not going to try to
[27:11] put too much in there they told me that
[27:14] they
[27:14] could do all this stuff without cables
[27:17] so i guess i have to believe him
[27:21] and so i want to
[27:25] introduce to you this morning
[27:30] a new member of our church family
[27:35] and um and so
[27:38] he's standing over here his
[27:42] his brother brent wetzel
[27:45] and he's a born-again christian he's
[27:47] been born again and spirit-filled
[27:50] since 1969
[27:53] and we have hired
[27:57] brent and his company to offer us
[28:01] some security now
[28:04] let me i'll explain that to you in a
[28:06] moment but
[28:07] brent is a licensed and insured top-tier
[28:11] security guard
[28:13] he's certified in first aid cpa
[28:17] the use of defibrillators and things
[28:19] like that
[28:21] he's trained in traffic control with
[28:24] traffic control
[28:25] experience now let me explain to you
[28:29] well brent first of all stand up and
[28:30] come up here
[28:32] brother and i want to introduce you and
[28:34] uh
[28:36] and so this is brother brent and i want
[28:38] you to get to know him and
[28:40] he's here to to uh
[28:44] serve you uh he he's gonna be providing
[28:48] for us some comfort and some
[28:51] work that we have to have done uh
[28:54] for the city and so when you see him out
[28:57] there
[28:58] he's he's not there to arrest you uh
[29:02] he's not there to check your immigration
[29:04] papers
[29:05] he's not there to give you a c19 test
[29:09] uh he's a he's a set of eyes and
[29:13] uh so uh just if you get a chance to
[29:16] shake his hand or
[29:17] give him a knock or stay six feet and
[29:20] wave to him whatever you're
[29:22] comfortable with i i hope that you get
[29:24] used to him and understand
[29:26] and i'll explain to you here in a moment
[29:28] why that we have him
[29:30] and what's going so i'm sorry that i had
[29:34] to go help my mother
[29:36] i'm not sorry i had to go help my mother
[29:37] don't no
[29:39] don't misinterpret that by any means
[29:44] i had to apologize to brent because i
[29:47] didn't
[29:48] get a chance to introduce him properly
[29:51] because of some
[29:52] the situations and circumstances but
[29:54] we're trying to make that
[29:56] right this morning and he loves the lord
[29:59] and he loves god's people
[30:01] and i think you'll be glad to have him
[30:03] so brent i'm sorry i have to send you
[30:05] back to work
[30:06] brother
[30:15] and so um
[30:19] in in part of preparing for the future
[30:22] when
[30:23] it and if the lord allows us to build
[30:26] our new building and we always approach
[30:28] everything lord willing
[30:31] we're going to have quite a bit of
[30:33] territory
[30:34] to keep our eyes on our parking lot is
[30:38] going to go
[30:39] almost to two and a half acres of
[30:41] parking
[30:43] we're going to have over 170
[30:46] parking places and what we've hired
[30:50] brett for
[30:51] is that while you're sitting here in
[30:53] church
[30:54] you know that your cars are protected
[30:58] in the parking lot in the past we've had
[31:02] people drive
[31:02] into our parking lot and go through our
[31:05] cars
[31:06] and so we're going to
[31:10] put an end for that to that also
[31:14] in the environment uh
[31:19] anybody knows when the economy goes down
[31:21] crime goes up
[31:23] and people become desperate for any
[31:26] number of reasons
[31:28] and it's important in the security world
[31:31] and even in your
[31:32] own christian lives that you never want
[31:35] to present yourself
[31:37] as a soft target
[31:40] you know you know somebody that's
[31:42] vulnerable
[31:44] somebody that's unsure and
[31:47] by providing external security
[31:51] it allows for people to realize that
[31:54] this
[31:54] is not a soft target in other words this
[31:57] isn't an
[31:58] easy place to come and commit a crime
[32:02] and so we've asked him to do that
[32:05] plus also he is
[32:08] certified in first aid so if someone
[32:12] was to be in the parking lot or have a
[32:15] heart attack
[32:16] or or something then he know he has
[32:19] the ability to respond to that
[32:22] we will probably get a defibrillator to
[32:26] be
[32:26] here on site along with a first
[32:29] responders kit
[32:31] and i know that we don't ever
[32:35] anticipate any problem
[32:39] and we know that if god doesn't watch
[32:42] the city
[32:43] the watchman watches in vain
[32:46] but that's like saying god knows what i
[32:49] have need of so i'm not going to pray
[32:53] god knows i love him so i'm not going to
[32:56] worship
[32:57] and that is not due diligence
[33:02] so i believe we're going to grow and
[33:05] if the lord tarries we have children
[33:07] that are
[33:08] growing up children are moving off your
[33:11] laps and off the floor
[33:13] onto a a seat so we we have to make
[33:17] preparations for those things so having
[33:21] somebody out there
[33:22] allows our deacons to do the job that
[33:26] they're supposed to do
[33:28] in the framework of the church
[33:31] so our deacons can be about our duty you
[33:34] can sit in here
[33:35] this morning and know that you're
[33:38] outside
[33:38] is being taken care of also it relieves
[33:42] us our deacons and our congregation
[33:46] from a lot of liability that
[33:50] goes with an incident
[33:53] so we have an insured hired security
[33:56] guard uh watching our outside
[34:00] while we're in here worshiping that is
[34:03] uh uh as as many of you know
[34:06] if you would read the first uh uh
[34:10] verses of uh the 13th chapter of romans
[34:14] the fourth fourth verse says for he is a
[34:16] minister of god
[34:18] to thee for good but if thou
[34:22] do that which is evil be afraid
[34:25] for he beareth not the sword in vain
[34:29] for he is the minister of god a revenger
[34:33] to execute
[34:34] wrath upon him that doth
[34:37] evil and so there's many scriptures in
[34:40] the
[34:42] bible that recognizes law enforcement
[34:45] and security we're very fortunate to
[34:48] have a
[34:48] a police officer that attends our church
[34:52] a dallas police officer that attends our
[34:54] church
[34:55] brother isaac i don't know if you're
[34:56] here this morning i know sometimes he
[34:58] has to work on
[34:59] a sunday but we're grateful for that and
[35:03] we support
[35:04] our law enforcement and uh
[35:07] and so that that's why brent's here he's
[35:11] he's here so i can sit in my office you
[35:14] can sit in this church and know that
[35:15] there's somebody out there that's
[35:17] trained
[35:18] watching if some something happened out
[35:20] there
[35:21] at that we know he's trained in first
[35:23] aid and
[35:24] can be there to help
[35:28] and we'd also like to know this morning
[35:32] that if any of you are
[35:36] come in the first responder category if
[35:39] any of you
[35:40] are certified in cpr
[35:43] or certified in a first aid
[35:47] or have some sort of first aid training
[35:50] some of you are doctors
[35:52] some are nurses if you could turn
[35:55] that information into
[35:58] brother jackson brother chris brother
[36:01] john one of the deacons
[36:04] and just write your name what you're
[36:06] certified in
[36:07] and turn it in then we can look across
[36:10] the congregation if we have a child fall
[36:13] down or something
[36:14] and we need somebody we'll know who to
[36:16] reach out to
[36:18] so we want to do that because we
[36:21] we want to we know these are difficult
[36:25] times
[36:25] and i think that we really have to
[36:29] be more conscious of taking care of one
[36:34] another
[36:34] than we've ever been taking care of one
[36:38] another
[36:40] so if you know that if somebody's
[36:42] unemployed
[36:44] uh then and you know they have a need
[36:48] i encourage you to reach out to them and
[36:51] help them
[36:53] the best that you can
[36:56] if you can't help then you can report
[36:59] back to us
[37:00] to myself the deacons one of the
[37:02] ministers such and such
[37:04] is in need but this is a time that
[37:08] we need to take care of one another more
[37:11] than we've ever taken care of one
[37:13] another
[37:14] that we we need to invite one and over
[37:17] have one another reach out one to
[37:20] one to another i think congregational
[37:24] care is something that belongs to all of
[37:28] us
[37:29] and we're a body and we're fitted and
[37:31] joined together
[37:32] and each one supplies the need to the
[37:35] other
[37:36] and so there's no program that
[37:39] we could ever put in place that would
[37:42] ever
[37:43] take the place of your personal love
[37:47] your personal care your personal
[37:50] words of encouragement your personal
[37:54] involvement
[37:55] in somebody's life who has a need
[37:58] and that was why the first church failed
[38:02] is they adopted nickelodeonism and they
[38:05] passed all the responsibility onto
[38:08] a group of of man
[38:12] and and the holy spirit is who leads our
[38:16] term
[38:17] and the spirit of god said it's the love
[38:19] of god
[38:20] shed abroad in our heart by the holy
[38:23] spirit
[38:23] so i want you to be involved in that
[38:25] love i want you to be
[38:27] conscious of the leadership of the holy
[38:29] spirit
[38:30] to take care of one another to reach out
[38:34] to one another to look after one another
[38:37] to to have your ears up if
[38:40] you hear somebody is in a burden or a
[38:44] trial
[38:44] see what you can do to help see if you
[38:47] can find
[38:48] somebody to help you take care of them
[38:51] and do whatever you can
[38:53] and and then if you need to you can
[38:56] reach out to the church
[38:58] but let's try to take care of it at a
[39:00] congregational
[39:01] level first amongst ourselves amen
[39:05] another reason i also wanted to
[39:08] let you know why that we have
[39:11] uh brother brent if the city of bedford
[39:14] may require us to provide
[39:16] traffic uh assistance
[39:20] and uh so uh if it comes to that time
[39:23] we'll have to have somebody stand in the
[39:25] street
[39:26] stop cars and let people out so we're
[39:28] making preparations for that
[39:30] in the future we certainly don't uh want
[39:33] that
[39:33] also uh this last uh yesterday
[39:37] we had our first children's fellowship
[39:40] and from all the reports i've heard it
[39:42] was really a wonderful time
[39:45] with the children and so we can't have
[39:48] sunday school now our facility with our
[39:52] seating
[39:52] and the seating we had to move out of
[39:55] the sanctuary
[39:57] to the back it doesn't allow us to have
[40:01] sunday school so sunday school
[40:04] is i guess the best word to use
[40:07] is on hold until we can resume it
[40:11] and when we can resume it we'll resume
[40:13] sunday's goal
[40:15] in the meantime we're going to have
[40:18] children
[40:18] fellowship uh events
[40:22] or or saturdays
[40:25] where we gather all the children in
[40:27] provide
[40:28] to them some bible teaching some
[40:31] activities
[40:32] and a lunch or food it may be
[40:36] held here at the church it may be in a
[40:38] different venue
[40:39] but we will we will
[40:43] plan those and announce them
[40:46] as we have them we're going to try to
[40:49] shoot for once a month
[40:51] if it works easier we may do some other
[40:54] things but
[40:55] we may have some some
[40:59] programs according to age groups we may
[41:02] do an
[41:03] all-encompassing thing but we're going
[41:05] we're going to have some different
[41:07] things
[41:08] for our children in that sunday school
[41:11] age group
[41:12] as we go forward so we haven't forgotten
[41:15] them
[41:16] we are trying to do something for them
[41:20] that we can and
[41:24] and lastly we do
[41:27] try to have a small area in the back of
[41:30] the church
[41:32] that we can provide some form of social
[41:35] distancing
[41:36] uh for those who feel they need a little
[41:39] extra space
[41:41] and also if you want to come to church
[41:45] we're not as crowded on wednesday
[41:47] evenings and sunday evenings
[41:50] so that is also a time that you can come
[41:53] and have more
[41:56] space so if you have any questions you
[41:59] can
[42:00] certainly contact me uh direct
[42:03] uh lee and i think i sent out an
[42:06] email with my phone number on it and
[42:09] i'll be happy to answer
[42:11] any questions that you have and
[42:14] and um uh you know it's it's
[42:18] it's just things are different being in
[42:20] a big city
[42:22] and having a government out there and
[42:25] and all the things that they're
[42:28] requiring us to do but
[42:30] we're going to persevere and if god be
[42:32] for you who can be against you
[42:34] amen so um
[42:38] and so i just hope that you understand
[42:43] why we've went forward and i've
[42:45] discussed it with the elders of the
[42:47] church and
[42:48] and they'll encourage us in the things
[42:51] that we're doing
[42:53] i hope i have your support and your
[42:56] prayers
[42:57] and i think together that
[43:00] we're going to fight this battle tell
[43:03] our feet leave this
[43:04] ground amen and i don't know which way
[43:08] the world's going
[43:09] but i know we're going up amen and we
[43:12] don't want to leave anybody behind
[43:15] and so we're here we're here to nourish
[43:17] our souls
[43:19] we're here to draw closer to our lord
[43:21] and savior
[43:22] we're here to worship him and to praise
[43:25] him and
[43:26] uh and it's just when you have a body
[43:30] we're not an organization but we should
[43:33] be organized
[43:35] we shouldn't we shouldn't be in
[43:37] confusion
[43:38] but we should be in order and so that's
[43:41] what we're trying to do is place
[43:43] everything in order
[43:45] and i know a lot of these things don't
[43:47] cross your mind
[43:48] but part of my office
[43:52] requires me to to uh
[43:56] take these things into consideration and
[43:58] we're doing them for you
[44:00] so god bless you we love you so much
[44:02] we'll bring billy back to lead us in
[44:04] worship
[44:05] and then brother george will come out
[44:07] and minister the word of god to us
[44:09] then we can go outside and fellowship
[44:12] and
[44:12] and and love the lord and come back
[44:15] together this evening it
[44:17] at five o'clock and we have a couple
[44:19] baptisms after
[44:20] service this morning so if you can stay
[44:24] for the baptism
[44:25] we we always love to have that if you
[44:28] have to go
[44:29] just feel free to go but anyway god
[44:31] bless you this morning brother billy as

[1:14:11] jesus name
[1:14:12] amen you may be seated
[1:14:17] it's good to be back here after several
[1:14:19] months
[1:14:22] i was here in march maybe some of you
[1:14:24] don't remember
[1:14:25] but we were
[1:14:28] here and according to my records we got
[1:14:31] through chapter 19 of the book of acts
[1:14:33] remember
[1:14:37] that's why we're going to cover 19 again
[1:14:40] but um
[1:14:42] you know before we get started on the
[1:14:45] word just want to give you a word of um
[1:14:47] report about the missionary activities
[1:14:49] because first and foremost i'm a
[1:14:51] missionary
[1:14:52] to other countries i travel through here
[1:14:55] to encourage the saints but
[1:14:58] um we do have the church age book
[1:15:00] printed in english and spanish
[1:15:02] and it's available to you know everybody
[1:15:06] and um we also realize that there's
[1:15:10] god is still calling people um we're
[1:15:13] still here so the last one hasn't been
[1:15:14] found
[1:15:16] but there's people eagerly looking for
[1:15:18] him and her
[1:15:19] and just in the months of this year only
[1:15:22] this year there's been thousands
[1:15:25] baptized in mexico and brazil
[1:15:28] and other places so we hear about them
[1:15:31] they send us pictures sometimes
[1:15:34] and these are the brothers that are out
[1:15:36] there facing the enemy
[1:15:38] facing the trials and things
[1:15:41] but god is is with them and the gospel
[1:15:44] is still
[1:15:45] true the word is still the word it
[1:15:48] doesn't matter who speaks it
[1:15:50] um i want to thank you for the
[1:15:54] offerings that you've given and for the
[1:15:58] clothes that you've donated that we send
[1:16:00] to venezuela
[1:16:01] venezuela is very very needy
[1:16:05] went to the dollar and the dollar went
[1:16:08] high you know
[1:16:09] sky high uh hyperinflation
[1:16:12] and everything is just a total wreck
[1:16:14] because they've tried to
[1:16:16] institute socialism which they have no
[1:16:18] history of ever working any place
[1:16:20] only for the three people at the top
[1:16:24] just the way it works that's why you're
[1:16:26] here
[1:16:27] but we do send stuff every two weeks
[1:16:31] and we have a secure way of getting it
[1:16:32] to them we can't help everybody
[1:16:34] we're helping many families and the lord
[1:16:37] has blessed
[1:16:38] in in africa in malawi i was over there
[1:16:41] last year
[1:16:43] and turns out that this one group of
[1:16:44] people was thrown out of their church
[1:16:47] because the man that helped him build
[1:16:51] the church wanted it back
[1:16:53] if you come here we're going to shoot
[1:16:54] you fine we won't go there so they met
[1:16:57] under the trees for a while
[1:16:59] and then they found a piece of property
[1:17:02] that you know
[1:17:02] they had saved up about a third of the
[1:17:04] money necessary for the for the property
[1:17:06] and so they reached out said could you
[1:17:08] help us with the other two thirds
[1:17:11] and so we approached a few brothers and
[1:17:12] yeah we can send the money
[1:17:14] well by the time the money got there and
[1:17:15] everything the other
[1:17:17] people that wanted that property reached
[1:17:19] in and bought it
[1:17:21] it just so happened it was a catholic
[1:17:22] church but
[1:17:24] i told them don't worry god's got
[1:17:25] something better for you keep looking
[1:17:28] so god provided a place out of town a
[1:17:30] little ways a couple acres
[1:17:32] and um so they're busy you know leveling
[1:17:35] it and
[1:17:36] and uh you can build a church and so
[1:17:38] they're such lovely people
[1:17:40] and they said oh well we're glad that
[1:17:42] god has provided we want to call this
[1:17:44] the george smith tabernacle
[1:17:48] i said i don't think so
[1:17:51] we're going to call this walking in the
[1:17:53] light tabernacle
[1:17:55] okay so they've registered that so
[1:17:57] they're busy with that but it's one of
[1:17:59] these places that's very poor
[1:18:01] that they don't know what the next day
[1:18:03] is bringing
[1:18:04] so they're um they're very happy
[1:18:07] and also during this um pandemic
[1:18:11] i mean it's it's kind of a joke right
[1:18:12] there are people dying i
[1:18:14] first admit but they politicized it
[1:18:18] okay so these many thousands of people
[1:18:20] died well so nobody's died of cancer
[1:18:23] nobody's died of heart attacks during
[1:18:24] this time
[1:18:26] uh coming down the road you all saw the
[1:18:28] same sign i did
[1:18:29] in these ten months nine months of this
[1:18:31] year on texas roads only
[1:18:35] 243 people have died
[1:18:38] well if we had the little short italian
[1:18:40] guy in charge he would park all the cars
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:43] highway should come people got get the
[1:18:45] cars off hot road well that's not the
[1:18:47] answer
[1:18:48] why did those people die how many were
[1:18:50] on drugs how many were mad at their wife
[1:18:54] how many were on alcohol so let's go
[1:18:57] where the problem is you know
[1:18:59] but this is laodicea and the reason it's
[1:19:02] so insane
[1:19:04] is not because they don't come to this
[1:19:06] church is because a prophet said many
[1:19:08] years ago
[1:19:10] if this goes on the way it's going now
[1:19:13] which at that time it looked like it's
[1:19:14] pretty smooth
[1:19:15] but he said if it keeps going on the way
[1:19:16] it's going now in 50 years he'll be
[1:19:18] total insanity
[1:19:21] yeah that was that was six years ago so
[1:19:24] the 50 years so that's why we have these
[1:19:27] problems
[1:19:27] but we're looking up you know because um
[1:19:31] jesus said you shall know the truth and
[1:19:33] the truth shall make you free
[1:19:35] now the alternative to that is stay in
[1:19:37] bondage
[1:19:38] you have a choice this is america
[1:19:42] you have a choice well
[1:19:45] brother random says over here in uh
[1:19:49] 1964 knowing that you are my
[1:19:51] responsibility
[1:19:53] in other words you're under my umbrella
[1:19:55] uh and in my hands for the gospel
[1:19:58] i'll always want to keep you right in
[1:20:00] the pages of this bible
[1:20:02] brother brown didn't bring a new gospel
[1:20:04] he preached
[1:20:05] what paul preached you see so we have
[1:20:09] our anchor
[1:20:10] in the word so during this time we've
[1:20:13] also had many zoom meetings i've got
[1:20:15] another one tomorrow
[1:20:17] and it's not just you know spanish or
[1:20:19] english just in several languages
[1:20:20] like tomorrow we have a meeting that's
[1:20:23] going to be in
[1:20:24] spanish portuguese and german and
[1:20:29] so they've asked me to say a few words
[1:20:31] and
[1:20:32] that happens at least once a week so
[1:20:34] we're reaching more people
[1:20:36] and not spending near as much money
[1:20:38] because we can't go
[1:20:39] but we have the technology you know so
[1:20:42] the lord
[1:20:43] has blessed well um we don't want to
[1:20:47] stay with the alternative we don't want
[1:20:48] to stay in bondage we want to stay in
[1:20:50] the truth
[1:20:51] the truth shall make you free not
[1:20:53] brother david not brother george not
[1:20:55] jackson
[1:20:55] the truth shall make you free so we're
[1:20:58] going to take the liberty today
[1:21:00] to preach out of brother branham's
[1:21:01] absolute
[1:21:03] has anybody got a problem good
[1:21:07] start to give you a chance but um
[1:21:11] i was listening to a tape this morning
[1:21:13] unfailing realities
[1:21:15] and it's still the unfailing realities
[1:21:18] it's it's real
[1:21:19] you know and only god knows what the um
[1:21:21] what the outcome he knows who the real
[1:21:23] ones are
[1:21:24] you know brother brahm said in every
[1:21:25] congregation there's three kinds of
[1:21:26] believers
[1:21:28] all i see is believers but god knows the
[1:21:31] hearts
[1:21:34] so you just sit still and turn to page
[1:21:38] turn to page ninth or chapter 19 of the
[1:21:40] book of acts
[1:21:41] we're going to go through this we'll see
[1:21:42] how far we get maybe we'll get through
[1:21:45] does anybody know how many books there
[1:21:46] are in the book of acts how many
[1:21:48] chapters
[1:21:50] 28 but we might not get finished tonight
[1:21:54] so um in chapter 19 of the book of acts
[1:21:59] we have apollos a good baptist preacher
[1:22:02] preaching in corinth
[1:22:03] paul was traveling through there and he
[1:22:04] came into contact with some believers
[1:22:07] in the city of ephesus okay now ephesus
[1:22:11] at that time could have been a city of
[1:22:12] 350 000 people
[1:22:15] and um priscilla and aquila man and wife
[1:22:19] were there and they had a business of
[1:22:21] tent manufacturing okay
[1:22:24] that's affordable uh
[1:22:27] camp trailers let's say tents and so
[1:22:30] verse two
[1:22:32] and um he said unto them have ye
[1:22:35] received the holy ghost
[1:22:36] since he believed so paul comes across
[1:22:39] these believers
[1:22:40] and they said well we don't even know
[1:22:42] there's such a thing it's the holy ghost
[1:22:44] and so um verse 3 and he said unto them
[1:22:47] and well how in the world were she
[1:22:48] baptized then
[1:22:49] well unto john's baptism that was the
[1:22:51] only truth they knew at the time
[1:22:53] they knew no more truth the light hadn't
[1:22:55] shined any farther for them but now the
[1:22:57] light is there
[1:22:58] and he posed a question and so we mis
[1:23:01] you know john's baptism uh he said
[1:23:04] paul then said paul john verily baptized
[1:23:08] with the baptism of repentance he's very
[1:23:10] good saying to the people that they
[1:23:12] should believe on him
[1:23:14] which should come after him that is
[1:23:17] christ jesus
[1:23:18] when they heard this they were baptized
[1:23:21] according to romans according to what
[1:23:24] according to
[1:23:25] acts 2 38 which is the manifestation
[1:23:29] of jesus red letter words in matthew 28
[1:23:33] 19.
[1:23:35] nowhere in the bible where are you going
[1:23:37] to find where anybody was baptized
[1:23:39] according to the exact words of jesus
[1:23:41] christ in matthew 28 19.
[1:23:44] but there's a revelation there's a it's
[1:23:46] it's a rose that opens up oh that's what
[1:23:48] it is
[1:23:49] and so these people were baptized in the
[1:23:50] name of jesus christ
[1:23:52] then paul laid his hands on them and the
[1:23:55] holy ghost came on them and they spake
[1:23:56] with tongues and prophesied and all them
[1:23:58] were about 500 people
[1:24:00] no it was a little group of 12 people
[1:24:02] not even these two benches here
[1:24:05] all this over 12 people yeah mighty paul
[1:24:10] but he was dedicated he was yielded to
[1:24:13] how god was leading him okay
[1:24:15] so they were perfectly carrying out the
[1:24:17] pattern of acts chapter 2.
[1:24:20] great missionary paul baptizing 12
[1:24:21] people mentioned that
[1:24:23] so the same was done throughout the
[1:24:26] scriptures
[1:24:27] and every place they were spreading the
[1:24:29] gospel the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:24:31] up until the catholic church had the
[1:24:34] council
[1:24:35] we're going to put this thing in order
[1:24:36] because we say so because we've got the
[1:24:38] gold and we've got the nice
[1:24:39] clothes and we say it should be this way
[1:24:41] in 325
[1:24:43] and from then we had problems but
[1:24:45] there's always been people baptized in
[1:24:47] the name of jesus christ all the way
[1:24:48] through history
[1:24:49] but now we come into the fullness of the
[1:24:51] word and
[1:24:52] our prophet made it very simple and very
[1:24:55] obvious to us
[1:24:57] so we know god by his word and we know
[1:25:01] god by revelation
[1:25:02] right and we have an open book this is
[1:25:05] not a dead letter
[1:25:06] now see in the days of paul he had to he
[1:25:09] had to
[1:25:10] you know have fusses with the sadducees
[1:25:12] and the pharisees
[1:25:13] some of these people didn't believe in
[1:25:14] revelation they didn't believe in uh
[1:25:16] what he called the resurrection angelic
[1:25:19] means nothing all the head was dead
[1:25:20] letter
[1:25:21] but we have a living letter you know so
[1:25:25] um paul stayed in this area over two
[1:25:28] years
[1:25:29] as pastor verse 10.
[1:25:33] and this continued by the space of two
[1:25:34] years so that all they which dwelt in
[1:25:37] asia
[1:25:37] heard the word of the lord jesus both
[1:25:39] jews and greeks well
[1:25:42] the predestinated herder okay and um
[1:25:46] so we're moving along and when you have
[1:25:48] time this afternoon i would suggest that
[1:25:50] you
[1:25:51] read carefully chapter three of the
[1:25:53] exposition of the seven church ages
[1:25:56] and if you don't have a book i'll bring
[1:25:58] you one tonight
[1:25:59] yeah we've got them in the car um
[1:26:04] in speaking about the early church
[1:26:06] brother adam says on page
[1:26:08] 86 their persecutions and trials and
[1:26:11] patience
[1:26:12] were not let's start over their
[1:26:15] persecutions and trials and patience
[1:26:17] were over the blessed name of jesus you
[1:26:20] know that is not at all strange
[1:26:22] for it is the word and the name that
[1:26:24] brings the enemy pouring after us like a
[1:26:26] flood
[1:26:27] that mighty word which was manifested in
[1:26:29] healing signs wonders and demonstrations
[1:26:32] caused the pharisees to scream out for
[1:26:34] the death of the true believers
[1:26:37] now these people these pharisees are not
[1:26:40] communist
[1:26:40] they're not you know no they're word
[1:26:43] people
[1:26:44] they memorize their prophet's words but
[1:26:46] where there's a manifestation of it they
[1:26:48] just couldn't handle it
[1:26:49] screaming out for the death of the true
[1:26:51] believers and now the name
[1:26:53] hated and despised by the jews is mocked
[1:26:56] by the cultured
[1:26:58] in other words the important people the
[1:27:00] arrogant people
[1:27:02] you've met some american people this
[1:27:04] week my way or no way
[1:27:06] just out of my way i've got the biggest
[1:27:08] baddest car i'll get my
[1:27:09] take what i want no
[1:27:13] the name was hated and despised by jews
[1:27:15] is mocked by the cultured
[1:27:17] as they laughed to think that anyone
[1:27:19] could be so foolish
[1:27:20] as to believe a man who died and rose
[1:27:23] again
[1:27:24] and is now seated in heaven see this was
[1:27:26] like comic books to them they couldn't
[1:27:27] believe that
[1:27:28] so here they're here where the religious
[1:27:31] persecutors the jews
[1:27:33] cursing this jesus and that caused paul
[1:27:37] to leave corinth okay
[1:27:38] who to them was a false messiah and here
[1:27:41] were the others laughing with delight
[1:27:43] and mocking sarcastically at the name of
[1:27:46] the new god
[1:27:47] who to them wasn't a god at all now
[1:27:50] here's something else that started in
[1:27:51] that age
[1:27:52] and we'll continue right down through
[1:27:54] the ages getting deeper and darker
[1:27:57] right through today that is people were
[1:28:00] repudiating that name
[1:28:02] that means refusing to recognize they
[1:28:04] were rejecting it
[1:28:05] it was not the true ephesian church that
[1:28:07] was doing it no sir
[1:28:08] it was the false apostles quoting
[1:28:12] their prophet's words be careful
[1:28:15] it was the outsider trying to get in and
[1:28:18] defile the believers
[1:28:20] the ephesians knew the name and loved it
[1:28:23] so we are in love with jesus christ he
[1:28:26] is the one that's leading this bribe
[1:28:27] okay
[1:28:28] brother branham also says over in 1955
[1:28:31] now as moses went with that judgment
[1:28:33] stick before him
[1:28:34] that same stick tonight to the church is
[1:28:37] jesus christ
[1:28:39] if those egyptians could ever got that
[1:28:40] little stick out of moses hands
[1:28:42] they would have had him whipped and when
[1:28:45] the devil
[1:28:46] can never get the deity out of the name
[1:28:48] of jesus christ
[1:28:49] he's got the church quipped and we've
[1:28:52] long we've lived long enough to see
[1:28:54] these words fulfilled we've got people
[1:28:57] in pulpits
[1:28:58] right this minute with this same bible
[1:29:01] quoting this same prophet
[1:29:02] but taking the deity out of the name of
[1:29:04] jesus christ and putting it over here
[1:29:06] over there over there and the church is
[1:29:10] flat and they don't know what to do with
[1:29:12] the young people
[1:29:13] and they got a lot of problems because
[1:29:15] they got it out of
[1:29:16] balance
[1:29:21] now this has got two purposes one to
[1:29:24] keep you in balance
[1:29:25] and one to keep you awake
[1:29:29] okay so
[1:29:32] may god help us that is why
[1:29:35] some followers of this glorious message
[1:29:37] seem to be whipped and powerless
[1:29:39] they're following personalities and not
[1:29:41] the god of the bible
[1:29:43] they haven't stayed in the pages of the
[1:29:45] bible the way the prophet said
[1:29:47] you know this is not a religion of
[1:29:49] convenience whatever you like okay we're
[1:29:52] in chapter 19 verse 11.
[1:29:54] and god wrought special miracles by the
[1:29:56] hands of paul
[1:29:58] so that from his body were brought unto
[1:30:00] the sick handkerchiefs
[1:30:03] and aprons in other words you know
[1:30:05] cloths
[1:30:07] and the diseases departed from them and
[1:30:09] the evil spirits
[1:30:10] went out from them in rome
[1:30:14] there's a church called the
[1:30:17] church of paul outside the walls because
[1:30:20] when they took paul's head off
[1:30:22] back in i think of 67 a.d
[1:30:26] it happened outside the walls somewhere
[1:30:29] on that street
[1:30:30] where the church is and so this church
[1:30:32] is put there in memory of him
[1:30:34] because that's where his tomb was it
[1:30:37] still is
[1:30:38] and so when we were first there in
[1:30:42] 1973 i think it was
[1:30:45] you know there was a grave marker and it
[1:30:47] was it was a stone that was it was broke
[1:30:49] it was in several pieces and so i was a
[1:30:52] tourist you know
[1:30:53] but i asked the lady so why is it like
[1:30:55] that well she says for many years
[1:30:57] people have come by here and tied a rock
[1:31:00] and a cloth to a string and let it down
[1:31:03] and when it hit
[1:31:04] it would hit the sarcophagus you know
[1:31:06] where paul's bones are
[1:31:08] and they would pull it back out and
[1:31:09] people were healed oh yeah
[1:31:11] like it says right here well in the year
[1:31:14] 2000 the pope had a great idea
[1:31:16] let's bring that out of the ground and
[1:31:18] have it here on the surface where people
[1:31:20] can reach it
[1:31:21] and that's where it's at today so
[1:31:24] it's still having an effect now
[1:31:27] um 13 through 20 has to do with
[1:31:31] vagabond jews in other words jews out of
[1:31:33] order jews that were
[1:31:35] you know out of balance and they were
[1:31:39] freelance they weren't orthodox there
[1:31:41] was a man named siva
[1:31:43] a chief priest amongst the jews and he
[1:31:46] knew his prophet's words
[1:31:47] very well i'm not teaching you against
[1:31:51] using the prophet's words but you got to
[1:31:53] keep in balance
[1:31:54] brother branham wasn't out of the
[1:31:56] scripture this message is not like the
[1:31:59] people in salt lake city that is
[1:32:00] something separate
[1:32:01] no it's all one thing same spirit
[1:32:04] you see and so he knew his prophet's
[1:32:07] words well
[1:32:08] he had seven sons okay and they were
[1:32:11] into exercising or casting out demons
[1:32:13] and spirits and so forth
[1:32:15] and they heard about the success of paul
[1:32:17] verse 11
[1:32:18] uh that from his body were taken you
[1:32:21] know clots and people were healed
[1:32:23] and so they thought hey we should try
[1:32:26] that
[1:32:27] so they found a man with an evil spirit
[1:32:29] he was actually insane man
[1:32:31] and verse 13 we adjure you in the name
[1:32:34] of jesus whom paul preaches
[1:32:37] in other words what's going on over
[1:32:38] there we're with them
[1:32:41] they were not witnesses they were only
[1:32:43] wannabes
[1:32:46] they had no no concept of what was
[1:32:48] really about they just saw the effects
[1:32:49] of it
[1:32:50] and so what happened in verse 15 and the
[1:32:53] spirit
[1:32:54] and the evil spirit answered out of this
[1:32:57] crazy man
[1:32:59] jesus i know and paul i know
[1:33:02] but who are you guys
[1:33:06] so don't go about go don't go around
[1:33:08] repeating things unless you have an
[1:33:09] experience
[1:33:11] because the unbeliever can tell the
[1:33:13] difference and little children can tell
[1:33:15] the difference
[1:33:17] so you don't lie to little children you
[1:33:19] got to speak truth to them okay verse 16
[1:33:23] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[1:33:26] leaped on these seven guys
[1:33:28] and overcame them and prevailed against
[1:33:31] them
[1:33:32] so that what he got all their clothes
[1:33:34] off and beat them up and they had to run
[1:33:36] away
[1:33:37] that's pretty powerful yeah
[1:33:42] but in all of that confusion verse 17
[1:33:44] and this was known to all the jews and
[1:33:46] greeks also dwelling in ephesus
[1:33:48] and fear fell on them in the name of the
[1:33:51] lord jesus was magnified
[1:33:53] and many that believed came and
[1:33:55] confessed
[1:33:56] and showed their deeds okay
[1:34:00] so such was the conviction in their
[1:34:03] heart
[1:34:04] due to the reality of christ in the
[1:34:06] preaching of the word and the miracles
[1:34:07] and so forth verse 19
[1:34:09] many of them also used curious arts
[1:34:13] brought their books together and burned
[1:34:16] them before
[1:34:16] all men and they counted the price of
[1:34:19] them
[1:34:20] and found it to be fifty thousand pieces
[1:34:22] of silver
[1:34:25] so mightily grew the word of god and
[1:34:28] prevailed
[1:34:29] okay so all these magicians
[1:34:32] you know wow this is something real and
[1:34:35] they had a book burning
[1:34:36] and it was the only way to get rid of
[1:34:38] evil spirits okay
[1:34:40] i had a great revival this book burning
[1:34:44] they were really serious about following
[1:34:46] in the way
[1:34:48] they burned their stuff this is their
[1:34:49] livelihood you know
[1:34:51] and it's the only way to follow jesus
[1:34:52] christ properly
[1:34:54] it's not optional it's not popular but
[1:34:56] they were convicted
[1:34:57] by the holy ghost preaching and they got
[1:34:59] real serious
[1:35:01] okay now i knew a man a long time ago
[1:35:05] he had just come to the lord and he was
[1:35:08] just a man in the world he knew nothing
[1:35:09] about nothing
[1:35:10] but he just like people come into this
[1:35:12] church and they saw that it's real
[1:35:14] what do you think he did he went home
[1:35:16] and he was a logger
[1:35:18] and he had a 16 inch chainsaw
[1:35:21] he had a big collection of really nice
[1:35:24] albums long play records
[1:35:28] two weeks before that he had been
[1:35:29] offered three thousand dollars for that
[1:35:30] collection
[1:35:32] but now he's a believer he took that
[1:35:34] chainsaw
[1:35:37] cut all his records burned him that's
[1:35:39] the only way to get rid of evil spirits
[1:35:41] okay so the value of the books back
[1:35:44] there
[1:35:45] was um what do you say here 50 what
[1:35:48] yeah a lot of silver okay well that
[1:35:51] happens to be
[1:35:53] 50 000 days wages for one man
[1:35:57] or about the equivalent of 10 men's
[1:35:59] wages for 14 years
[1:36:03] what they once thought was valuable and
[1:36:05] a way of life was now trash in the fire
[1:36:08] anything that was contrary to jesus
[1:36:10] christ went into the fire
[1:36:12] you got to be serious you know we hear
[1:36:14] brother brandon say about throughout the
[1:36:15] tv
[1:36:16] oh but guess what we've got something
[1:36:19] better than tv now
[1:36:21] there's only 500 channels on tv we got
[1:36:23] it all here
[1:36:25] be careful where your little fingers go
[1:36:28] okay just just telling you so um
[1:36:33] they applied the token for real and uh
[1:36:36] but satan was on the scene verse 20.
[1:36:38] uh the word of god grew mightily uh-huh
[1:36:42] so with all this going on you know
[1:36:46] verse 23 uh and the same time there
[1:36:49] arose no small
[1:36:51] stir about the way i'm the way the truth
[1:36:53] and the life
[1:36:54] that one word cotton these are people of
[1:36:56] the way so
[1:36:57] people started talking about it you see
[1:37:00] and um
[1:37:01] in john 14 6 yeah i'm the way the truth
[1:37:03] and the life
[1:37:04] so um that one word stuck in their mind
[1:37:08] and as usual the other twin was right
[1:37:10] nearby
[1:37:11] it happens in this church it happens on
[1:37:13] your job everywhere when god blesses us
[1:37:15] here's that other guy
[1:37:16] it's a continual confusion to keep you
[1:37:19] in balance
[1:37:20] it's not going to be all peaches and
[1:37:22] cream no it's going to be a struggle
[1:37:25] excuse me and there was a revival
[1:37:29] people were turning from idol worship
[1:37:31] away from
[1:37:32] you know favorite personalities being
[1:37:35] baptized
[1:37:35] living right and um
[1:37:39] but the people that got upset was the
[1:37:41] ones making the idols
[1:37:42] because it was it was an industry there
[1:37:44] was people busy you know polishing and
[1:37:46] so forth and um demetrius was a
[1:37:50] silversmith in the
[1:37:51] in ephesus he crafted the the uh
[1:37:54] the elaborate shrines for the temple of
[1:37:56] diana that's the roman name
[1:37:58] artemis was the greek name and in
[1:38:01] verse 25 they had a union meeting to
[1:38:03] discuss their future
[1:38:05] okay at a union meeting verse 25
[1:38:08] and when he called together um
[1:38:12] when he called together the workmen of
[1:38:14] like occupation
[1:38:15] sirs you know that by this craft we have
[1:38:18] our wealth this is how we all have our
[1:38:20] nice stuff because we sell these crazy
[1:38:21] idols
[1:38:22] moreover you see in here that not
[1:38:26] alone at ephesus but almost all of asia
[1:38:28] this paul
[1:38:29] has persecuted and turned away much
[1:38:31] people saying that there be no gods
[1:38:33] which are made with hands just preaching
[1:38:36] the truth
[1:38:37] you know okay let's let's be real honest
[1:38:40] here
[1:38:41] how many of you came from the catholic
[1:38:43] church just be honest
[1:38:45] we're not going to give out no prizes
[1:38:47] okay
[1:38:50] you know what it is to count the beads
[1:38:53] light the candles pray to a dead idol
[1:38:56] it's not god
[1:38:58] okay so 27 so that not only this craft
[1:39:02] is in danger to be at
[1:39:04] you know zero but also the temple of the
[1:39:06] great goddess diana should be despised
[1:39:09] and her magnificence should be destroyed
[1:39:11] whom all
[1:39:12] asia and the world worshipeth they had a
[1:39:15] going thing there
[1:39:16] you know 28 and when they heard these
[1:39:19] things
[1:39:20] they were full of wrath they were upset
[1:39:22] screaming and hollering confusion
[1:39:24] and cried out saying great is diana of f
[1:39:28] of the ephesians and the whole city was
[1:39:30] filled with confusion
[1:39:32] imagine that and having caught
[1:39:36] uh gaius and aristocars men of macedonia
[1:39:41] paul's companions in travel they rest
[1:39:43] with one accord
[1:39:44] unto the theater in other words they're
[1:39:45] going to bring some justice to this
[1:39:47] situation
[1:39:48] these guys are tearing up our our whole
[1:39:50] livelihood
[1:39:51] and so we got to do something and
[1:39:55] and so they brought them for you know
[1:39:57] some kind of justice
[1:39:59] but see in verse 6 and 12 and 17
[1:40:02] there was great blessing of the lord the
[1:40:04] name of the lord was magnified
[1:40:05] but now in verse 29 there's mass
[1:40:08] confusion
[1:40:09] okay it only took two christians into
[1:40:12] custody
[1:40:13] brought them to the public area verse 32
[1:40:17] some therefore cried one thing and some
[1:40:19] another okay so we got conflicting
[1:40:21] you know accusations here couldn't agree
[1:40:23] among themselves
[1:40:25] for the assembly was confused and the
[1:40:27] more part
[1:40:28] uh knew not where they were even come
[1:40:30] together
[1:40:32] does that sound like what we've endured
[1:40:33] in this country the last two months they
[1:40:36] don't know why they're there they're
[1:40:37] just there for the party and the
[1:40:38] blah blah blah and somebody gets killed
[1:40:40] no problem there's more
[1:40:42] it's the same confusion it's crazy
[1:40:45] verse 34 and when they knew that that he
[1:40:49] was a jew
[1:40:50] all with one voice about the space of
[1:40:52] two hours
[1:40:53] we worship god for 20 minutes and we get
[1:40:55] tired
[1:40:57] shave that brother
[1:41:00] moses with the guitar he could have sung
[1:41:02] all i could have just sat and worshiped
[1:41:04] the lord you know
[1:41:07] but these people for two hours great as
[1:41:10] diana
[1:41:10] of the ephesians now paul wanted to go
[1:41:14] in and help he thought he could go in
[1:41:15] there and you know set
[1:41:16] some things in order but his friends and
[1:41:18] companions stopped him not like
[1:41:20] you're going to get hurt so it was a
[1:41:23] well
[1:41:24] uh calculated ruckus that's what it was
[1:41:26] and it only produces confusion
[1:41:29] that's all they had they even confess
[1:41:31] it's confusion
[1:41:32] um but um their attention was focused on
[1:41:35] this brother alexander in verse 34
[1:41:38] when they knew that he was a jew okay so
[1:41:39] they let this guy this this
[1:41:41] guy we're going to kill you know well
[1:41:44] so what we have here is a religious riot
[1:41:46] in ephesus
[1:41:48] because of the way and what it produces
[1:41:50] what's that
[1:41:51] god fearing god living people okay
[1:41:55] they're willing to take a stand for the
[1:41:56] truth no matter what it costs you see
[1:41:58] no matter what the relatives thought
[1:41:59] about it we're going to stand for the
[1:42:01] truth and that caused confusion with
[1:42:02] these other people
[1:42:04] so these were our brothers and sisters
[1:42:06] this isn't somebody way far off no this
[1:42:08] we're the we're part of that same church
[1:42:10] you see
[1:42:12] and um they were the present day
[1:42:14] fulfillment of hebrews 13
[1:42:15] 8 because the scripture is forever
[1:42:19] jesus christ's name yesterday for today
[1:42:21] and forever didn't start with william
[1:42:22] branham it's been here all along
[1:42:24] and even back then there was no new
[1:42:26] testament they were living it out you
[1:42:27] see
[1:42:28] back in 1950 brother branham said behold
[1:42:30] the lamb of god get ready
[1:42:32] wake up lift up your heads redemption is
[1:42:34] drawing nigh
[1:42:35] get ready signs and wonders appearing
[1:42:38] critics and infidels waxing worse and
[1:42:40] worse
[1:42:42] yeah 1950 that was a long time ago most
[1:42:45] of you weren't even alive yet
[1:42:46] you know growing wax and worse we've got
[1:42:49] to put up with them
[1:42:50] but we're not looking to them we're
[1:42:51] looking to god
[1:42:53] so you are wasting your time going on
[1:42:56] the internet
[1:42:56] and seeing what these people say and
[1:42:58] thinking that you and your canary brain
[1:43:00] are going to straighten it out
[1:43:02] don't go it'll take you down and you'll
[1:43:05] walk out of this church and commit all
[1:43:06] kinds of things
[1:43:08] stay with the truth
[1:43:11] okay so the believer that is secure and
[1:43:14] fortified by the word of god
[1:43:16] knows that first john 4 4 is the truth
[1:43:19] greater is he that's in me
[1:43:20] than he that's out there jesus prayed
[1:43:24] for you amen yeah jesus prayed for you
[1:43:27] believer in 21 20
[1:43:28] here in this time neither pray i for
[1:43:31] these alone john 17 20
[1:43:33] but for them also who believe on me
[1:43:36] through their word so these that he's
[1:43:39] talking to
[1:43:40] he knows he's gonna go out there and
[1:43:41] they're gonna repeat and they're gonna
[1:43:43] so they're gonna give testimony and he's
[1:43:46] praying for praying for us the gospel
[1:43:49] didn't come to dallas
[1:43:51] in a parachute somebody
[1:43:54] had to travel over here okay some people
[1:43:57] stayed up too late last night
[1:44:03] we don't serve coffee here
[1:44:06] so you were in the thoughts of jesus
[1:44:08] christ even before he hung on the cross
[1:44:12] he could see that there's going to be
[1:44:13] believers in dallas way back there
[1:44:16] let's see he loves you how much
[1:44:19] so much that he died and rose again on
[1:44:21] the third day
[1:44:22] and that is the gospel resurrection is
[1:44:25] the cornerstone of our message
[1:44:29] brother bram's ministry is wonderful but
[1:44:31] the resurrection is the cornerstone
[1:44:34] so in this case here in chapter 19 the
[1:44:36] mayor the town clerk
[1:44:38] he got him quieted down he explained to
[1:44:40] him you know 35 through 41.
[1:44:41] you men of ephesus calm down in other
[1:44:44] words people
[1:44:45] we have laws look at verse 35
[1:44:49] uh when the town clerk appeased the
[1:44:51] people he said you men of ephesus
[1:44:54] what man is there that knoweth not how
[1:44:56] that the city of
[1:44:58] the ephesians is a worshiper of the
[1:45:00] great goddess diana
[1:45:02] and the image which fell down from
[1:45:03] jupiter seeing then that these things
[1:45:06] cannot be spoken against
[1:45:07] you ought to be quiet and to do nothing
[1:45:11] rashly in other words cease with the
[1:45:14] confusion
[1:45:15] for ye have brought hither these men
[1:45:18] these christians
[1:45:19] which are neither robbers of churches
[1:45:22] and they don't blaspheme your goddess
[1:45:24] wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen
[1:45:27] which are with him have a matter against
[1:45:29] any man
[1:45:31] the court is open you know we can take
[1:45:33] care of this
[1:45:34] but if you inquire anything concerning
[1:45:37] these other matters
[1:45:38] hey this this is an unlawful assembly
[1:45:41] here
[1:45:42] for we're in danger of being called into
[1:45:44] question being arrested for nonsense
[1:45:47] and when they thus spoke and you
[1:45:48] dismissed the assembly okay
[1:45:50] so that's the scene of chapter 19
[1:45:54] chapter 20 verse 1 and after this
[1:45:57] uproar was ceased after you know they
[1:45:59] all went home paul called unto him the
[1:46:01] disciples and embraced them
[1:46:03] and departed to go to macedonia so after
[1:46:06] the riot
[1:46:07] paul had a meeting with the faithful
[1:46:09] embraced and prayed and he moved on to
[1:46:11] another city of macedonia
[1:46:12] so the text goes on to mention several
[1:46:15] of his faithful traveling companions
[1:46:16] there were seven of them
[1:46:18] and of significance in verse six they
[1:46:20] sailed
[1:46:22] for five days to cover 200 miles
[1:46:25] they didn't have gasoline engines they
[1:46:27] didn't have diesel engines
[1:46:29] you know all they had was the wind and
[1:46:31] the rowing
[1:46:32] it's the only way to get there they were
[1:46:34] patient people they didn't have an other
[1:46:35] choice
[1:46:36] now we live in a world of many many
[1:46:38] choices
[1:46:40] i just traveled from bristol tennessee
[1:46:43] to arkadelphia was over 700 miles
[1:46:47] in 13 hours you know and i came here
[1:46:50] and you know you all travel you know
[1:46:52] what it's like
[1:46:54] in brazil on the amazon river where
[1:46:56] there's no road
[1:46:57] they have diesel-powered barges it takes
[1:47:00] six days to cover 1200 miles
[1:47:03] so you know there's all kinds of choices
[1:47:05] so
[1:47:06] they were with the believers that were
[1:47:07] there in troas for uh
[1:47:09] seven days at trials as a part of
[1:47:12] turkey today it was a roman seaport at
[1:47:15] the time
[1:47:16] and the working people gathered around
[1:47:18] the visitors to
[1:47:19] uh you know learn anything new that they
[1:47:21] were bringing
[1:47:22] and they have followed a pattern that
[1:47:24] was um from the beginning back there
[1:47:26] of coming together around the apostles
[1:47:29] teaching for fellowship
[1:47:30] daily breaking of bread which is in
[1:47:33] chapter 2 verse 42 and 46
[1:47:36] that they came together often on a daily
[1:47:39] basis
[1:47:40] to have fellowship to commune you know
[1:47:42] and brother branham says they actually
[1:47:44] had communion every day
[1:47:45] because jesus said this due in
[1:47:47] remembrance of me
[1:47:49] and they were serious okay chapter 20
[1:47:52] verse 7
[1:47:53] if on the first day of the week when the
[1:47:55] disciples came together
[1:47:56] to break bread paul preached unto them
[1:48:00] ready to depart on the next day and he
[1:48:02] continued his speech until midnight
[1:48:05] imagine that
[1:48:09] i promise we'll be out before lunch
[1:48:13] but he preached long to midnight
[1:48:17] and he's leaving the next day that had a
[1:48:19] lot to say
[1:48:21] and so um uh as we've noticed throughout
[1:48:24] our study
[1:48:25] paul and his associates always made a
[1:48:27] point to go to church you know
[1:48:28] go where the jews were on the sabbath
[1:48:30] the synagogues
[1:48:32] these early missionaries took the gospel
[1:48:34] wherever whenever there was an audience
[1:48:37] chapter 16 they were down at the river
[1:48:39] that's where they met lydia remember
[1:48:41] but here for the first time it mentions
[1:48:45] that they met
[1:48:46] to break bread on the first day of the
[1:48:48] week two important points
[1:48:51] the early churches were specifically
[1:48:52] warned against submitting themselves
[1:48:54] to the bondage of any legalistic
[1:48:56] observance of the sabbath days
[1:48:58] cautions 2 16 and galatians 4
[1:49:01] 9-11 so these early
[1:49:04] churches voluntarily chose the first day
[1:49:07] of the week
[1:49:08] as an appropriate time for fellowship
[1:49:10] and worship
[1:49:11] in remembrance of the day that our lord
[1:49:13] arose okay that's how it started
[1:49:16] and it's all throughout the gospel and
[1:49:19] so it was a new day
[1:49:21] for new people a new creation and the
[1:49:24] observance
[1:49:25] of the first day is also in many early
[1:49:27] writings even to irenaeus
[1:49:29] messenger to the second church age so
[1:49:31] here's paul having communion
[1:49:34] uh having a convenience service with the
[1:49:35] saints at troas and he's leaving the
[1:49:38] next day
[1:49:39] and he's preaching to a very eager whole
[1:49:41] bunch of disciples
[1:49:42] had a lot to tell them and he was still
[1:49:45] preaching at midnight verse 8
[1:49:47] and there were many lights in the upper
[1:49:49] chamber where they were gathered
[1:49:50] together
[1:49:51] now this whole study is designed so that
[1:49:54] you will go in and read your bible
[1:49:57] because it's full of details why does
[1:49:59] that say that
[1:50:00] well guess what they didn't have these
[1:50:01] kind of lights these lights don't put
[1:50:03] off a lot of heat
[1:50:04] besides we've got a nice air
[1:50:06] conditioning got soft seats
[1:50:08] stay awake okay
[1:50:11] and he's still preaching at midnight and
[1:50:13] all these torches you know there's a lot
[1:50:15] of light they produce a lot of heat
[1:50:16] you know like when you go camping all
[1:50:18] that fun you have out there
[1:50:20] when you got a thousand dollar bed at
[1:50:21] home with air conditioning
[1:50:23] forget it
[1:50:27] verse nine and they sat and there was
[1:50:29] sitting in the window a certain young
[1:50:30] man
[1:50:31] named what was just calling bob
[1:50:36] but i see a few here that could be take
[1:50:38] his place
[1:50:41] and he went into a deep sleep didn't
[1:50:42] know what was going on he was thinking
[1:50:44] of you know
[1:50:45] going to the lake and as paul was very
[1:50:47] long in preaching
[1:50:49] he sunk down in sleep
[1:50:52] and what he fell out of the third loft
[1:50:56] onto the concrete or stones and he's
[1:50:58] dead
[1:51:00] what happens now so paul went down and
[1:51:04] fell upon him and embraced him saying
[1:51:06] trouble not yourselves
[1:51:07] there's life in him and we therefore was
[1:51:10] come up again
[1:51:11] uh and had broken bread and eaten
[1:51:14] taking a long while anyway they had
[1:51:17] church until the sun came up
[1:51:20] yeah they didn't stop church and and you
[1:51:22] know
[1:51:23] this man's raised from the dead normal
[1:51:25] procedure
[1:51:28] and they brought the young man alive and
[1:51:29] they were very comforted okay
[1:51:31] so that happened in chapter verse 20.
[1:51:36] so now he's heading up to jerusalem okay
[1:51:39] he's over troyez and in turkey going to
[1:51:42] jerusalem
[1:51:43] for the feast of pentecost which is 50
[1:51:44] days after the resurrection
[1:51:46] and um from the text it looks like they
[1:51:49] were in a big hurry
[1:51:50] they stopped at a place called mailitas
[1:51:52] and sent a messenger to call the elders
[1:51:55] of the church in ephesus and they came
[1:51:57] down to the dock
[1:51:58] and they had you know time with uh with
[1:52:01] paul
[1:52:03] so chapter 20 18 30 through 35
[1:52:06] is a farewell speech to these believers
[1:52:10] the church leaders and uh he felt
[1:52:12] compelled to go to jerusalem
[1:52:14] even though the saints at every stop
[1:52:16] urged him not to go
[1:52:17] fearing for his safety but the hard
[1:52:20] facts are
[1:52:20] in chapter 20 and verse 25
[1:52:24] let's see here and now behold
[1:52:28] i know that you all among whom i have
[1:52:31] gone
[1:52:31] preaching the kingdom of god shall see
[1:52:34] my face no more
[1:52:36] now they didn't want to hear that you
[1:52:38] know they've been warning them don't go
[1:52:40] there they're going to hurt you
[1:52:41] and but he's telling i have to go
[1:52:44] verse 27 for i have not shunned to
[1:52:47] declare unto you all the counsel of god
[1:52:50] verse 28 take heed therefore unto
[1:52:53] yourselves
[1:52:54] and to all the flock over which the holy
[1:52:56] ghost hath made you or seers
[1:52:59] to feed the church of god which he hath
[1:53:01] purchased with his own blood
[1:53:03] now this is not the way some people are
[1:53:06] doing it today
[1:53:07] you know take you know you tell them
[1:53:09] what i said and you bring the tithings
[1:53:10] to me
[1:53:11] and no they're all independent groups
[1:53:14] see 29. for i know this that after my
[1:53:18] departing after i leave
[1:53:20] grievous hungry wolves are going to come
[1:53:23] in
[1:53:24] and they're not gonna have any mercy
[1:53:27] that happens thirty also for your own
[1:53:31] self of your own selves
[1:53:32] shall men arise some of you among your
[1:53:34] own little churches
[1:53:35] speaking perverse things draw away
[1:53:38] disciples after themselves
[1:53:40] i'm the one that's got the truth now
[1:53:41] paul's gone he gave me the
[1:53:45] no he didn't therefore watch and
[1:53:48] remember
[1:53:49] that by the space of three years i cease
[1:53:51] not to warn every one of you day and
[1:53:52] night with tears i was here with you
[1:53:54] in ephesus for three years and now
[1:53:56] brethren
[1:53:58] i commend you to god and to the word of
[1:54:00] his grace which is able to build you up
[1:54:02] and to give you
[1:54:03] an inheritance among all men which are
[1:54:06] sanctified
[1:54:07] i have coveted no man's silver gold
[1:54:09] clothing nothing
[1:54:11] yeah yourselves know that these hands
[1:54:14] have ministered unto you
[1:54:15] my necessities and to them that were
[1:54:18] with me
[1:54:19] i have showed you all things how that
[1:54:22] so laboring you ought to support the
[1:54:23] weak and to remember the words of the
[1:54:25] lord jesus
[1:54:26] how he said it is more blessed to give
[1:54:29] than to receive
[1:54:31] well that's a little different than some
[1:54:32] of our people today
[1:54:34] give me give me give me sit on the porch
[1:54:36] and wait for the check
[1:54:37] no it's better to when you give it's
[1:54:40] more blessed
[1:54:41] amen yeah continuing
[1:54:44] and when he had thus spoken he kneeled
[1:54:46] down
[1:54:47] and prayed with them all just imagine
[1:54:50] here they are
[1:54:51] at the port where the boat came they'd
[1:54:53] come down from ephesus
[1:54:54] they're kneeling in prayer and they all
[1:54:56] wept sore and fell on paul's neck and
[1:54:59] kissed him
[1:55:00] sorrowing most of all for the words
[1:55:03] which he spake
[1:55:04] that they should seek his face no more
[1:55:06] and they accompanied him
[1:55:07] onto the ship
[1:55:10] it was a sad day but it was part of
[1:55:13] god's program
[1:55:15] now look over carefully at second where
[1:55:18] we are second corinthians chapter four
[1:55:21] uh let's see what we've got here
[1:55:24] second corinthians four and um
[1:55:27] verses three and
[1:55:31] yeah four and three but if our gospel be
[1:55:34] hid
[1:55:35] it is hidden that they are lost in whom
[1:55:37] the god of this world has blinded their
[1:55:38] minds
[1:55:39] of them which believe not lest the light
[1:55:42] of the glorious gospel of christ
[1:55:45] who is the image of god should shine
[1:55:47] upon them for we preach not ourselves
[1:55:49] no it's not me when you see me
[1:55:53] it's god in simplicity yes we don't
[1:55:56] preach ourselves but christ jesus the
[1:55:58] lord
[1:55:59] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[1:56:02] sake
[1:56:02] for god who commanded the light to shine
[1:56:04] out of the darkness hath shined in our
[1:56:06] hearts
[1:56:06] to give the light the knowledge of the
[1:56:08] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[1:56:11] amen so this was their father in the
[1:56:15] gospel
[1:56:16] amen and so uh their messenger from god
[1:56:19] they recognized that
[1:56:21] and um they actually never saw him again
[1:56:25] only later they later they received a
[1:56:26] nice letter from
[1:56:28] prison in rome the epistle to the
[1:56:31] ephesians
[1:56:32] okay so moving right along to chapter
[1:56:36] 21.
[1:56:37] nobody's real tired those that aren't
[1:56:39] tired well they'll hear the recording
[1:56:41] later
[1:56:44] okay chapter 21 the sea journey
[1:56:45] continues so he's coming from troas
[1:56:48] turkey down trying to get to jerusalem
[1:56:51] and they came to tyre which is currently
[1:56:53] lebanon
[1:56:54] ministered to the saints there for an
[1:56:56] entire week
[1:56:57] 21 and four and finding disciples we
[1:57:00] carried there seven days
[1:57:02] who said to paul through the spirit that
[1:57:04] he should not go to jerusalem same thing
[1:57:06] all the
[1:57:06] they said in these other places verse
[1:57:08] five and when we had it
[1:57:10] and when we had accomplished these those
[1:57:12] days
[1:57:13] we departed and went our way and they
[1:57:15] all brought us
[1:57:16] to the ship no way and they they all
[1:57:19] brought us
[1:57:20] on our way with wives and children until
[1:57:23] we were
[1:57:24] out of the city and we kneeled down
[1:57:28] on the shore and prayed you know when i
[1:57:31] read these things
[1:57:32] it just it brings us so real to us these
[1:57:34] were real people like you and i
[1:57:36] they were suffering they had families
[1:57:39] they love their messenger
[1:57:41] they're at the sea they're they're
[1:57:42] they're at the port they're they're over
[1:57:44] at the shore
[1:57:45] they're kneeling in the sand they're
[1:57:46] praying and they knew that they're never
[1:57:48] going to see him again
[1:57:51] yeah another final goodbye
[1:57:54] so verse eight they finally arrived at
[1:57:57] caesarea
[1:57:58] they stayed in the home of philip the
[1:58:00] evangelist we saw him back in chapter
[1:58:01] six
[1:58:03] and in verse nine and the same man had
[1:58:05] four daughters
[1:58:06] virgins which did prophesy okay
[1:58:09] and of course this is a fulfillment many
[1:58:12] fulfillments
[1:58:12] one of the fulfillments of joel 2 28
[1:58:15] your daughters shall prophesy
[1:58:17] when prophets say something it might not
[1:58:20] be universal on air everybody no but
[1:58:22] there's a fulfillment
[1:58:23] someplace of those words you just got to
[1:58:26] pay attention
[1:58:26] you see and these were all in one family
[1:58:30] verse 10 through 15 and as we carried
[1:58:33] there many days
[1:58:34] where at uh caesarea in the
[1:58:37] house of uh philip evangelist as we
[1:58:40] turned their many days
[1:58:42] there came down from judea a certain
[1:58:44] prophet named agabus
[1:58:45] okay and when he was come unto us he
[1:58:48] took
[1:58:48] paul's girdle you know one of the uh it
[1:58:50] was his clothing
[1:58:52] and bound his own hands and feet and
[1:58:54] said thus saith the holy ghost
[1:58:56] so shall the jews that jerusalem bind
[1:58:58] the man that owneth the squirtle
[1:59:00] and shall deliver him unto the hands of
[1:59:02] the gentiles
[1:59:03] and when we heard these things both we
[1:59:05] and they that of that place
[1:59:07] besought him don't go to jerusalem paul
[1:59:09] please don't go
[1:59:11] and paul answered would mean you to weep
[1:59:13] and to break my heart
[1:59:15] for i am ready not only to be bound but
[1:59:17] also to die at jerusalem for the name
[1:59:20] of jesus christ
[1:59:23] and when we would not be first when he
[1:59:26] would not be persuaded
[1:59:27] we ceased we quit saying you know
[1:59:31] thy the will of the lord be done and
[1:59:33] after those days we took up our
[1:59:34] carriages our baggage and stuff and we
[1:59:36] went on to jerusalem
[1:59:37] which today is you know hour and a half
[1:59:40] journey
[1:59:41] probably took them a day or two well
[1:59:44] so so paul is on the way to jerusalem
[1:59:46] okay he wants to be there for the for
[1:59:48] the
[1:59:49] festivities and everybody says don't go
[1:59:51] but he was god's servant he knew what he
[1:59:53] was doing
[1:59:54] first corinthians 2 1 and 2 says uh
[1:59:58] let's go back over there real quick
[2:00:01] i'm sure that you should know that by
[2:00:02] now you don't come to this church
[2:00:03] without your bible
[2:00:04] but uh in first corinthians
[2:00:08] 2 it says here
[2:00:13] and i brethren when i came among you
[2:00:17] um i didn't come with excellency of
[2:00:19] speech i didn't like
[2:00:20] great knowledge or wisdom declaring unto
[2:00:23] you the testimony of god
[2:00:24] for i determined not to know anything
[2:00:26] among you only
[2:00:27] jesus christ and him crucified
[2:00:30] so after many warnings from good friends
[2:00:32] very spiritual people
[2:00:34] even a vindicated prophet
[2:00:37] not to go because of possible danger
[2:00:40] paul and his associates arrive at
[2:00:42] jerusalem and verse 17 they were
[2:00:44] welcomed
[2:00:45] very warmly now we're in chapter 21
[2:00:48] verse 17 uh
[2:00:52] they received us gladly okay verse 18.
[2:00:56] and the day following paul went in with
[2:00:58] us unto james and all the
[2:01:00] elders present and
[2:01:03] as far as we can tell this is the james
[2:01:05] of matthew 4 21.
[2:01:07] but there were several people named
[2:01:08] james in the new testament
[2:01:11] now this is you know sunday school and
[2:01:14] there might be a test later
[2:01:17] so there's james the apostle brother to
[2:01:20] john
[2:01:21] son of zebedee matthew 10 2. there's
[2:01:23] james the apostle son of alphaeus
[2:01:25] matthew 10
[2:01:26] 3 also known as james the lesser why
[2:01:30] because he was shorter than the other
[2:01:31] james
[2:01:34] and there's james our lord's brother
[2:01:36] matthew 13
[2:01:37] 55 and there's james the father of judas
[2:01:40] the apostle
[2:01:41] luke 6 16. so in jerusalem paul meets
[2:01:45] with the apostles
[2:01:46] and the church leaders and he tells of
[2:01:48] the mighty things that was accomplished
[2:01:50] on his missionary trips
[2:01:52] now this is the end of his you know he's
[2:01:53] coming to the end of everything he's
[2:01:54] been on three missionary trips
[2:01:56] uh over the period of 30 years traveled
[2:01:59] maybe 10
[2:02:00] 000 miles um
[2:02:03] so they were pleased and glorified god
[2:02:05] and uh this could have been as late as
[2:02:07] 56
[2:02:08] a.d uh over 20 years after the pentecost
[2:02:12] and they said now look dear brother we
[2:02:14] have a situation here in jerusalem
[2:02:16] you are aware that thousands of jews
[2:02:18] have believed
[2:02:20] and um they're they're zealous for the
[2:02:22] law
[2:02:23] but they they have been informed they
[2:02:26] know that you're here
[2:02:27] you see and so um uh
[2:02:31] they've been told that you were out
[2:02:32] there amongst the gentiles and so forth
[2:02:35] so um that you're out there telling
[2:02:38] people to forsake
[2:02:39] prophet moses that was not true and
[2:02:42] you're telling them not to circumcise
[2:02:44] your little voice that wasn't true
[2:02:46] and that they should forget the customs
[2:02:48] of the law
[2:02:49] now they know that you're here there was
[2:02:52] no secrets
[2:02:53] and they didn't have cell phones no the
[2:02:54] word gets around
[2:02:56] so they say to paul now look we have a
[2:02:58] plan we have four men here willing to
[2:03:00] take
[2:03:00] a vow take them with you purify
[2:03:04] yourselves
[2:03:05] according to the law you can pay for
[2:03:06] their haircut and
[2:03:09] then all people will know that all these
[2:03:11] other things are false if you do these
[2:03:12] things
[2:03:13] showing that you and your guys have four
[2:03:15] you know you fulfill the law
[2:03:18] and so in verse 25 answering the same
[2:03:20] questions
[2:03:21] providing guidelines for the gentile
[2:03:23] believers but look at verse 26
[2:03:25] it says here then paul took the man and
[2:03:28] the next day purify themselves
[2:03:30] and entered into the temple to signify
[2:03:33] the accomplishment of the days of
[2:03:34] purification
[2:03:35] until that uh an offering should be
[2:03:38] offered
[2:03:39] for every one of them okay so they were
[2:03:41] obeying the law of moses
[2:03:42] following the advice of the lord's
[2:03:45] disciples
[2:03:46] and but once again there was the trend
[2:03:48] the twin is always close by
[2:03:50] you can count on it you know and so
[2:03:53] until the day that you're raptured
[2:03:55] and that's why we're here today to be
[2:03:58] rapture
[2:03:58] ready we're not just here to you know
[2:04:00] warm up the benches and get the free air
[2:04:01] conditioning
[2:04:02] no we're here to get rapture ready okay
[2:04:06] and so verse 27.
[2:04:10] and when the seven days were almost
[2:04:11] ended the jews which were of asia
[2:04:13] when they saw him in the temple stirred
[2:04:16] up the people
[2:04:17] and grabbed him that said late and
[2:04:20] when it says laid hands on that wasn't
[2:04:22] god bless you no that's
[2:04:24] come with me we've got some things to
[2:04:25] talk about verse 28
[2:04:27] and they were crying out man of israel
[2:04:30] this is the man that teacheth all men
[2:04:32] everywhere against the people
[2:04:34] and the law and this place and further
[2:04:37] brought greeks into the temple
[2:04:39] and have polluted the holy place making
[2:04:42] up stuff
[2:04:44] verse 29 for they had seen before with
[2:04:47] him
[2:04:47] in the city of you know atrophymas uh in
[2:04:51] whom they supposed that paul had brought
[2:04:54] into the temple
[2:04:55] okay now so here's another
[2:04:58] religious riot in jerusalem these
[2:05:01] weren't peaceful times
[2:05:02] just like now another religious riot in
[2:05:05] jerusalem
[2:05:06] great confusion they grabbed paul and
[2:05:08] they had plans to kill him on the spot
[2:05:09] this is the man who do away with him
[2:05:11] finish the problem and they were going
[2:05:14] to beat him to death
[2:05:15] yeah verse 31 where's it at here
[2:05:18] and as they went about to kill him
[2:05:21] tithings came into the chief captain of
[2:05:22] the band in other words
[2:05:23] chief of police that all jerusalem was
[2:05:26] in an uproar
[2:05:28] mainly because of a rumor a supposition
[2:05:32] and meanwhile someone went and reported
[2:05:34] the activities to the captain
[2:05:36] the chief of police and so he took a
[2:05:38] bunch of soldiers
[2:05:39] and they went down to check out what was
[2:05:40] going on see
[2:05:42] so when the writers saw him coming they
[2:05:44] quit beating paul
[2:05:46] didn't sound familiar and so the
[2:05:48] soldiers you know they restrained him
[2:05:50] put him in chains and asked who he was
[2:05:53] what's this all about
[2:05:54] so this is this is the problem guy so
[2:05:56] we're gonna we're gonna secure you
[2:05:58] change okay what's going on and so um so
[2:06:02] the crowds began shouting all kinds of
[2:06:03] accusations
[2:06:05] nothing was understood so the captain
[2:06:07] ordered him take him
[2:06:08] take him to headquarters so due to the
[2:06:10] violence of the people
[2:06:12] the soldiers were carrying paul now he's
[2:06:14] in custody
[2:06:15] for his protection they're carrying him
[2:06:18] and when they were going up the stairs
[2:06:20] into the building the people were
[2:06:22] shouting all kinds of things like he
[2:06:23] should die and so forth
[2:06:25] without any evidence only supposition
[2:06:28] all about confusion so we go back to
[2:06:31] first corinthians
[2:06:32] chapter 14 because that's when he tells
[2:06:35] a lot of this story himself first
[2:06:38] corinthians 14
[2:06:40] and verse 33 uh
[2:06:44] for god is not the author of confusion
[2:06:46] but of peace
[2:06:47] as in all churches of the saints so when
[2:06:50] you see things that are confusing
[2:06:52] a that's not a church of the saints that
[2:06:54] is not god's spirit
[2:06:56] so put it aside because you know if
[2:06:59] you're over 10 years old
[2:07:00] that you can't change anybody they're
[2:07:03] going to do what they want to do
[2:07:06] whether it's how they quote the prophet
[2:07:07] or whatever just leave them
[2:07:09] alone because we're in a land of equal
[2:07:12] opportunity everybody's got a bible
[2:07:13] everybody's got a cell phone entire
[2:07:15] message is on the cell phone in several
[2:07:16] languages
[2:07:17] there's no excuse okay so
[2:07:20] these people were so blind to their
[2:07:22] religion
[2:07:24] uh what they thought to be truth quoting
[2:07:27] from their prophet
[2:07:29] and um they were ready to kill anyone
[2:07:32] who did not
[2:07:33] see things exactly their narrow way
[2:07:36] blind fanatics and we got them today
[2:07:39] carrying spoken word books
[2:07:42] i know them
[2:07:45] so they were ready to die and to kill
[2:07:47] for their
[2:07:48] view of a god of yesterday totally
[2:07:51] ignoring what god was doing in present
[2:07:53] tense
[2:07:54] and not interested in what may be in the
[2:07:56] future
[2:07:57] they were content with forms rituals
[2:08:01] quoting verbatim but no life
[2:08:04] and willing to kill anyone with a
[2:08:05] different view
[2:08:07] yeah way back then it only got worse
[2:08:11] okay and so the revealed word was a
[2:08:15] foreign concept to them
[2:08:17] all they cared about what did moses say
[2:08:20] i wish i had a dollar for every time
[2:08:21] somebody got in trouble uh brother
[2:08:23] george what did brother brown say about
[2:08:24] it doesn't matter at this point what
[2:08:26] brother branham said you guys are so
[2:08:28] way off the beam that's the least of
[2:08:30] your problems
[2:08:34] but very selectively ignoring parts that
[2:08:37] were not convenient to their views
[2:08:39] and of course they didn't have an actual
[2:08:40] recording so it's whatever they heard
[2:08:42] and they thought they heard
[2:08:43] okay yeah so god's word is never
[2:08:47] stagnant okay it's moving on just like
[2:08:48] here you're getting ready to build a
[2:08:49] church who would ever thought of that
[2:08:52] but things move on you know
[2:08:55] and so uh it is truth
[2:08:58] that you can depend on heaven and earth
[2:09:02] all this that you see out here all these
[2:09:04] forty thousand dollar cars everything's
[2:09:06] gonna be ashes
[2:09:08] but the word of god will remain forever
[2:09:12] my word will never pass away
[2:09:15] matthew 24 35. but the word of god is
[2:09:18] living
[2:09:19] and moving and god will find someone
[2:09:22] somewhere through whom he can make it
[2:09:25] come alive
[2:09:26] you see god has no hands but your hands
[2:09:29] he has no eyes but your eyes no feet but
[2:09:32] your feet
[2:09:32] you see no mouth but yours so we must be
[2:09:36] totally yielded to him yes lord whatever
[2:09:38] you say
[2:09:39] all my stuff is foolish whatever you say
[2:09:43] got to be yielded completely brother
[2:09:46] branham was born
[2:09:47] a seer okay you've heard all that many
[2:09:49] times he was born a prophet
[2:09:51] but god could only use him properly when
[2:09:54] he was totally yielded
[2:09:57] so you want to say what he says fine
[2:10:00] i'll say what he says
[2:10:01] he says i'm just a sinner saved by grace
[2:10:03] oh we don't want to hear that part
[2:10:06] we just want to hear the marvelous works
[2:10:08] and you know
[2:10:10] but this is him sinner saved by grace
[2:10:13] use my god because god ordained it
[2:10:14] before the foundation of the world
[2:10:17] okay so may god have
[2:10:20] mercy on us here at the end time what
[2:10:23] about us
[2:10:24] each one of us thinks something special
[2:10:26] amen okay it's time for her
[2:10:30] see that stops the snoring
[2:10:34] only thing that makes us special is that
[2:10:37] god
[2:10:38] has trusted us to live out our portion
[2:10:41] of the drama
[2:10:42] here in the age and the ending of
[2:10:43] laodicea that's the only thing makes you
[2:10:45] special
[2:10:46] you see it's by his grace and we're in
[2:10:48] the darkest of ages
[2:10:50] and some of you weren't here the last
[2:10:52] time i said it but you know brother
[2:10:54] branham has talked about 1977
[2:10:56] for a long time so in 1959 he was
[2:10:59] preaching in the islands of the
[2:11:00] caribbean
[2:11:02] several weeks down there and one of the
[2:11:04] americans with him had about four hours
[2:11:06] with him
[2:11:07] and he reported later he says you know
[2:11:09] when we were together
[2:11:10] i asked brother and why do you say so
[2:11:12] much about 1977
[2:11:14] which was 18 years away who cares
[2:11:17] well brother branson said it's very
[2:11:18] simple because when i was looking
[2:11:20] through the stream of time and you can't
[2:11:21] do that only a prophet
[2:11:22] and he's seeing numbers and he said by
[2:11:24] the time i got to 77
[2:11:26] it was so dark that i didn't see how
[2:11:29] any believer could live in such darkness
[2:11:33] now we're over 40 years on this side
[2:11:37] it's very dark spiritually okay
[2:11:41] so may god help us
[2:11:44] but we are in a very dark age so all the
[2:11:47] saints of all the past ages
[2:11:49] are depending on you and me to live out
[2:11:52] our
[2:11:52] portion don't worry about luther's
[2:11:55] mistakes
[2:11:56] don't worry about what william brown
[2:11:57] said or didn't say just live your
[2:11:59] portion right now
[2:12:00] because the scripture says they without
[2:12:03] us laodicea
[2:12:04] are not made perfect so may god
[2:12:07] have mercy on us okay let's go back to
[2:12:09] our story 21
[2:12:11] 37 let's see
[2:12:14] the holy ghost will put it together for
[2:12:16] you and as paul was led
[2:12:18] into the castle and he's on the stairway
[2:12:21] he said to the chief captain
[2:12:23] uh can i speak to you and he said oh
[2:12:26] you can speak greek uh
[2:12:29] are not you that egyptian which before
[2:12:31] these days
[2:12:33] made such an uproar and led people out
[2:12:35] in the wilderness four thousand men
[2:12:36] there were murders
[2:12:38] paul said i am a man of which i am a jew
[2:12:41] of tarsus
[2:12:42] city of cilicia citizen of no mean city
[2:12:45] and i beseech you
[2:12:46] except suffer me to speak to the people
[2:12:49] and when he had given him license
[2:12:51] paul stood on the stairs and beckoned
[2:12:54] with his hand to the people that when
[2:12:56] there was you know
[2:12:57] a great silence and he began to speak to
[2:13:00] them in the hebrew tongue
[2:13:02] so he knew at least three languages okay
[2:13:05] so he begins to speak to the crowd
[2:13:07] just these people want to kill him it's
[2:13:09] only the mercy of god
[2:13:10] that the law you know
[2:13:13] rescued him now he's going up the stairs
[2:13:16] and he's speaking to the people
[2:13:18] okay so what did he look like at this
[2:13:20] point
[2:13:21] he didn't look like a preacher he was
[2:13:24] bloody he was
[2:13:25] tattered very scroungy looking
[2:13:28] he quieted the wild religious crowd
[2:13:31] without a
[2:13:31] microphone and he began to tell his
[2:13:34] story
[2:13:35] it's not lunch time yet chapter 22 verse
[2:13:39] 1
[2:13:40] man and brethren and fathers hear ye my
[2:13:42] defense which i make and now
[2:13:44] unto you okay so they're all quiet and
[2:13:46] when they heard that he spoke hebrew
[2:13:47] whoa they were very quiet they won't
[2:13:50] hear what he had to say
[2:13:52] i am verily a man which am a jew born in
[2:13:55] tarsus the city of cilicia
[2:13:57] yet brought up in this city at the feet
[2:13:59] of gamaliel
[2:14:00] okay so he's trained in the pharisee
[2:14:03] religion these are the purest
[2:14:05] of the moses disciples let's say
[2:14:08] and this training went on from 14 to 40.
[2:14:12] it wasn't a two-year course like no no
[2:14:14] it was a big deal
[2:14:16] and taught according to the perfect
[2:14:17] manner of the law and the fathers and
[2:14:19] was zealous toward god
[2:14:20] as you all are this day i was just like
[2:14:23] you
[2:14:24] zealous for what prophet said and i
[2:14:27] persecuted
[2:14:27] where we have verse four and i
[2:14:29] persecuted this way
[2:14:31] unto the death binding and delivering
[2:14:34] unto prison both men
[2:14:35] and women now see that was one of the
[2:14:37] biggest miracles back then
[2:14:39] that this man who was
[2:14:42] taking people to prison watching him die
[2:14:45] god appeared to him turned him around
[2:14:48] now he's the apostle to the gentiles
[2:14:50] amen so he tells the whole story
[2:14:53] we'll fast forward to verse 17 and it
[2:14:55] came to pass that when i was come again
[2:14:57] to jerusalem
[2:14:58] even while i prayed in the temple the
[2:15:00] other day i was in a vision and trance
[2:15:03] and i saw him saying unto me
[2:15:06] make haste otherwise hurry up get thee
[2:15:09] quickly out of jerusalem
[2:15:10] for they will not receive thy testimony
[2:15:12] concerning me
[2:15:14] now these are direct words from god that
[2:15:15] he's repeating and i said lord
[2:15:18] they know that i am prison and beat in
[2:15:20] every synagogue
[2:15:21] them that believed on thee and those are
[2:15:24] our family okay and when the blood of
[2:15:27] thy martyr stephen was shed
[2:15:29] i also was standing there consenting to
[2:15:32] his death
[2:15:33] and i kept arraignment of them that slew
[2:15:35] him so he was he was in agreement he was
[2:15:37] a pharisee in training
[2:15:38] he was too young to throw stones but
[2:15:41] what he saw that day when steve was
[2:15:43] killed
[2:15:43] that was stamped in his mind and it
[2:15:45] never left him
[2:15:47] verse 21 and um he said unto me depart
[2:15:50] for i will send thee uh far hence unto
[2:15:54] the gentiles
[2:15:55] and they gave him audience unto this
[2:15:58] word
[2:15:59] and then they lifted up their voices and
[2:16:01] said away with such a fellow from the
[2:16:03] earth
[2:16:04] for it's not fit that he should live
[2:16:07] he's breathing our air we want him gone
[2:16:11] and as they cried out and cast off their
[2:16:13] clothes and threw dust in the air
[2:16:16] more confusion the chief captain
[2:16:18] commanded him to
[2:16:19] take him into the castle and that he
[2:16:22] should be examined by scourging
[2:16:26] and he might know wherefore they cried
[2:16:28] against him so he didn't have a clue
[2:16:29] what this is all about it's a religious
[2:16:31] matter
[2:16:34] and they take him in there
[2:16:37] so he's in jail now the scourge means to
[2:16:41] harass
[2:16:42] you all what harassments right
[2:16:45] severely with no mercy yeah that's what
[2:16:48] they were doing to him
[2:16:49] we're going to get the truth out of this
[2:16:50] character so from chapter 21
[2:16:53] paul's in jail for the protection from
[2:16:55] the religious fanatics
[2:16:56] and since the jews were so upset with
[2:16:58] him he must be guilty of something
[2:17:01] you know these police they're romans
[2:17:03] they're just keeping order they don't
[2:17:05] know nothing
[2:17:07] so in verse 25 and as they bound him
[2:17:10] with thongs which was
[2:17:11] leather straps it's like a
[2:17:12] straightjacket we've got him in a
[2:17:13] straight jacket we're whipping him with
[2:17:14] no mercy
[2:17:17] and so um the chief police does not know
[2:17:20] who he is
[2:17:22] and why the people are ready to kill him
[2:17:25] and this official is a roman officer
[2:17:29] he's just a public servant he has no
[2:17:31] revelation
[2:17:32] no interest in the fanatical religion of
[2:17:34] the jews
[2:17:35] but he's responsible for the peace in
[2:17:37] jerusalem so he has to get to the bottom
[2:17:39] of the problem
[2:17:41] 25 part 2. paul said unto the
[2:17:45] centurion that stood by is it lawful for
[2:17:47] you to scourge a man
[2:17:48] that is a roman and uncondemned oh we
[2:17:51] got a problem
[2:17:52] when the centurion heard that he went
[2:17:55] and told the chief captain saying hey
[2:17:57] be careful this guy's rolling then the
[2:17:59] chief captain came and said on him
[2:18:01] uh tell me are you a roman yes i am
[2:18:05] and the captain said you know with great
[2:18:08] some
[2:18:08] i obtained this freedom and paul said
[2:18:13] i was born i was born a free man
[2:18:17] you know then straight away they
[2:18:21] departed from him left him alone the
[2:18:23] chief captain
[2:18:24] also was afraid after he knew that he
[2:18:27] was roman
[2:18:28] and because he had bound him well
[2:18:32] uh he can't figure this out himself you
[2:18:35] know
[2:18:36] and he's got to get to the bottom of the
[2:18:37] problem somehow and he wants to know the
[2:18:39] truth of it
[2:18:40] so he calls together the high priest and
[2:18:43] his counsel
[2:18:44] the religious people now this is the
[2:18:47] sanhedrin
[2:18:48] i know this is a lot of details when you
[2:18:50] listen to it later it'll fit together
[2:18:52] but this is all facts the sanhedrin
[2:18:55] was the high court of the land okay made
[2:18:57] up of 71 members
[2:18:59] divided into three groups there's the
[2:19:01] chief priests the elders and scribes
[2:19:04] and they were the religious rulers and
[2:19:06] they interpreted the law to the people
[2:19:09] and they made the decisions but they
[2:19:11] could not issue the death penalty that
[2:19:13] had to be
[2:19:14] uh the romans so the high priest
[2:19:17] presided over the nation's
[2:19:18] highest administrative judicial body and
[2:19:21] right below this high priest
[2:19:23] in rank was an exclusive group of about
[2:19:26] 200
[2:19:27] pure-blooded jews couldn't put a finger
[2:19:29] on them
[2:19:30] below these 200 was another 7 000
[2:19:33] ordinary priests and all these men could
[2:19:36] trace their roots
[2:19:37] all the way back to aaron they had it
[2:19:40] together
[2:19:41] and so they were divided into 24
[2:19:45] priestly clans and each group served a
[2:19:49] week
[2:19:49] at a time in the
[2:19:53] temple so you get the picture right
[2:19:55] these people were in charge
[2:19:57] but under the watchful eye of the romans
[2:20:00] and only the romans could have entered
[2:20:02] administered the death penalty so
[2:20:05] um it just so happens that this is the
[2:20:07] fifth occasion
[2:20:08] when these men in this council with all
[2:20:11] the power
[2:20:12] were called upon to render an official
[2:20:14] this decision
[2:20:16] regarding the claims of christ and his
[2:20:18] followers
[2:20:19] okay they wished it would all go away
[2:20:21] they wish this the whole christian thing
[2:20:23] would just disappear and we could go on
[2:20:24] with our life
[2:20:25] but that's not possible see why because
[2:20:28] jesus christ was and is the fulfillment
[2:20:31] of the words of prophets that they these
[2:20:33] guys claim to follow
[2:20:34] they knew their prophet's words by
[2:20:36] memory and here's the fulfillment and
[2:20:38] they couldn't see it and they want to
[2:20:39] kill him
[2:20:40] see so they knew it by the letter of the
[2:20:43] law
[2:20:44] and they failed to see the manifestation
[2:20:47] so when you're reading your scriptures
[2:20:48] when you're reading your spoken word
[2:20:50] books keep in mind
[2:20:52] he said it but there's a manifestation
[2:20:54] of these things
[2:20:55] okay it comes to pass okay
[2:20:58] so they were on the wrong side on the
[2:21:00] blind side of the issue and they were
[2:21:02] very good at repeating what their
[2:21:03] prophet said
[2:21:04] but zero revelation ready to punish
[2:21:07] anyone
[2:21:08] with a different viewpoint especially
[2:21:12] if there would be some manifestation of
[2:21:14] the words
[2:21:15] of the prophet why can't you guys just
[2:21:18] be normal people not be
[2:21:19] quoting this you know so this
[2:21:22] like say this the fifth time the first
[2:21:24] time they had jesus himself
[2:21:26] on the stand in luke 22 and he was on
[2:21:28] his way to calvary to die for us
[2:21:31] the second time after healing of the
[2:21:33] lame man at the gate called beautiful
[2:21:35] peter and john were questioned by the
[2:21:37] same counsel
[2:21:39] uh by what power what name have you done
[2:21:41] this
[2:21:42] now they weren't upset that the man had
[2:21:44] never walked nice walking and you know
[2:21:46] he's a product producing man of the of
[2:21:49] the
[2:21:49] city but that name please number three
[2:21:54] the apostles were having a marvelous
[2:21:55] meeting
[2:21:56] manifestations of the power of god okay
[2:21:59] look at acts chapter 5.
[2:22:02] it's worth reviewing for just a minute
[2:22:03] here acts chapter 5
[2:22:07] and verse um where are we at verse 12
[2:22:10] of 5. and by the hands of the apostles
[2:22:13] were many signs and wonders wrought
[2:22:15] among the people
[2:22:17] and they were all with one accord and
[2:22:19] solomon's porch
[2:22:20] okay verse 16. and there came also a
[2:22:24] multitude out of the cities around about
[2:22:25] jerusalem
[2:22:26] bringing sick folks and so forth and
[2:22:28] they were healed everyone total
[2:22:29] deliverance right
[2:22:31] what happened to verse 17 of chapter
[2:22:33] five then the high priest
[2:22:35] the people in charge the one that knew
[2:22:37] their prophet's words perfectly
[2:22:39] and all they that were with him which is
[2:22:41] the sadducees
[2:22:42] were filled with joy and praise god no
[2:22:45] they were mad as all get out
[2:22:47] we got to kill these people yeah verse
[2:22:50] 18
[2:22:52] and they laid their hands on them the
[2:22:54] apostles and put them in the prison
[2:22:56] but the angel lord came by that night
[2:22:58] opened the prison doors and brought them
[2:22:59] out
[2:23:00] and said go preach the words of this
[2:23:03] life
[2:23:04] god delivers his people you might think
[2:23:07] god forgot about you he knows exactly
[2:23:09] where you are and what you're thinking
[2:23:11] and why you wore that color today he
[2:23:13] knows all these things
[2:23:15] okay fourth occasion was the death of
[2:23:18] deacon stephen
[2:23:19] and now 20 years after the crucifixion
[2:23:22] paul is facing the same
[2:23:24] counsel different individuals of course
[2:23:26] but the same exact spirit
[2:23:28] only more corrupt and more arrogant
[2:23:32] so chapter 22 and verse 30.
[2:23:35] and on the next day because he would
[2:23:38] have known
[2:23:38] the certainty whereof he was accused of
[2:23:41] the jews
[2:23:42] in other words he want to know the truth
[2:23:43] of it he loosed him from his bonds and
[2:23:45] commanded the chief priest
[2:23:46] and all the council to appear and
[2:23:48] brought paul down
[2:23:50] and set him before them okay
[2:23:54] so the romans called for a meeting of
[2:23:55] this powerful council and put
[2:23:58] brother paul on trial
[2:24:01] and i don't see any clock here what time
[2:24:04] you got
[2:24:06] doesn't matter fine pastor said
[2:24:09] okay we're gonna we're gonna cover
[2:24:10] chapter 23 so the scene opens paul
[2:24:14] is standing before this high council the
[2:24:16] simon hedren verse 20
[2:24:17] verse 1 of chapter 23 and paul earnestly
[2:24:21] beholding the council
[2:24:22] said man and brethren i have lived in
[2:24:24] all good conscience before god
[2:24:26] until today okay so his opening
[2:24:30] statement
[2:24:30] he uh establishes the foundation
[2:24:34] honestly i've been honest every day
[2:24:37] so god knows that you and i are not
[2:24:39] sinless okay
[2:24:42] and he calls for us to be honest if we
[2:24:44] say that we have no sin we deceive
[2:24:46] ourselves and the truth is not in us
[2:24:48] first john 1
[2:24:48] 8. so as paul stood before this hostile
[2:24:51] jewish council religious people the
[2:24:54] greatest on the planet
[2:24:56] he could honestly declare that he had a
[2:24:59] clear conscience
[2:25:00] okay now honesty
[2:25:03] and a clear conscience are not the same
[2:25:04] as perfection
[2:25:07] paul was by no means perfect but he was
[2:25:09] totally forgiven
[2:25:10] and he was honest about his failures as
[2:25:12] we'll see later
[2:25:14] so in a total fit of anger and surprise
[2:25:17] verse 2
[2:25:18] and the high priest ananias commanded
[2:25:20] them that stood by him
[2:25:22] to smack him in the mouth knock his
[2:25:25] teeth out
[2:25:26] and all he had said i my conscience is
[2:25:28] clear
[2:25:30] and the main guy says smack him wow
[2:25:33] it's getting serious then paul
[2:25:36] remembered how brother branham described
[2:25:38] him
[2:25:38] hook nose high-tempered sarcastic jew
[2:25:43] i mean that's in the blood so totally
[2:25:45] surprised he lost his cool for a moment
[2:25:47] and in verse 3 god shall smite thee you
[2:25:52] white at wall
[2:25:53] who sitteth thou to judge me after the
[2:25:56] law and command us me
[2:25:57] to be smitten contrary to the law oh
[2:26:00] sounds bad
[2:26:01] verse 4. then one of the one of the
[2:26:03] flunkies that stood by
[2:26:05] are you speaking against god's high
[2:26:07] priest
[2:26:08] and paul said oh i didn't know he was
[2:26:10] high priest i'm sorry you know the
[2:26:12] scripture says
[2:26:12] thou shalt not speak against the ruler
[2:26:14] of thy people
[2:26:16] verse 6 and when paul perceived that one
[2:26:19] part of the sadducees
[2:26:20] and the others pharisees he cried out to
[2:26:23] the council men and brethren
[2:26:25] i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee
[2:26:28] of the hope and resurrection of the dead
[2:26:30] i am called in question
[2:26:32] and when he had thus said there arose a
[2:26:34] dissension amongst them
[2:26:36] oh yeah they start arguing and the
[2:26:38] multitude was divided
[2:26:40] just like on the streets of america
[2:26:44] for different reasons for the sadducees
[2:26:47] say there's no resurrection nor
[2:26:49] angels nor spirit but the pharisees
[2:26:51] confessed both so they
[2:26:52] their doctrine was contrary to one
[2:26:54] another you know
[2:26:56] and there are rows of great cry and the
[2:26:58] scribes that were
[2:26:59] um let's see and the scribes that were
[2:27:02] of the pharisees
[2:27:03] partly arose we're fighting we find no
[2:27:06] fault in this man but
[2:27:07] if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to
[2:27:10] him
[2:27:10] let us not fight against god and
[2:27:14] when there arose a great dissension of
[2:27:16] the chief captain
[2:27:18] fearing unless paul should have been
[2:27:20] pulled to pieces
[2:27:22] he's told the soldiers take him away
[2:27:25] bring him back to the castle
[2:27:27] so got a lot of things going on here and
[2:27:29] the night following the lord stood by
[2:27:32] paul and said be a good cheer you know
[2:27:34] and it's tough paul but hey stand steady
[2:27:37] stay balanced for as thou has testified
[2:27:39] of me in jerusalem
[2:27:41] and all he said was that one phrase i
[2:27:43] have lived in all good conscience before
[2:27:45] god until this day
[2:27:46] and it caused all that he said as you
[2:27:48] have
[2:27:49] stood for me here in jerusalem so must
[2:27:51] you bear witness
[2:27:52] in rome you are going to go to rome
[2:27:55] and tell the same story yes sir
[2:27:58] well so god confirming his eternal word
[2:28:03] because in matthew 28 20 20 28 20
[2:28:06] i am with you always even to the end of
[2:28:09] the world
[2:28:10] and we're not there yet so when things
[2:28:11] get tough hey
[2:28:13] that verse is for you i'm with you
[2:28:15] always
[2:28:17] always you know so verse 12
[2:28:20] of 23 and when it was day you know sun
[2:28:24] came up
[2:28:24] certain of the jews banded together
[2:28:27] these people are serious
[2:28:29] and under a curse not under a blessing
[2:28:33] saying that they would neither eat nor
[2:28:35] drink until they had killed
[2:28:37] paul wow 13.
[2:28:41] and they were more than 40 which made up
[2:28:44] this conspiracy so here's 40
[2:28:46] tough guys saying we're not going to eat
[2:28:49] we're not going to drink till we get his
[2:28:51] head off
[2:28:52] now you try to go from right now until
[2:28:55] the sun goes down
[2:28:56] and don't drink or eat and you're going
[2:28:59] to hurt
[2:29:00] but they they said we're not going to
[2:29:02] take nothing till we kill him
[2:29:04] and they came to the chief priests and
[2:29:05] elders saying uh we have bound ourselves
[2:29:08] under a great curse
[2:29:10] that we will eat nothing until we have
[2:29:11] slain paul so god's elect have been
[2:29:14] under assault
[2:29:15] since the garden of eden this isn't
[2:29:17] anything new
[2:29:20] and so they simply have a different
[2:29:23] revelation okay
[2:29:24] they believe differently and the spirit
[2:29:27] of arrogance cannot stand it
[2:29:28] when there's the least bit of opposition
[2:29:31] in their way of thinking
[2:29:33] we're right you're wrong that's the only
[2:29:35] way they can see things
[2:29:37] so the christians can mostly get along
[2:29:39] in this world you know we try to get
[2:29:41] along
[2:29:43] but the muslims have a totally different
[2:29:45] way of looking at things
[2:29:47] very very dangerous now if you make a
[2:29:50] a circle and you divide it into a
[2:29:53] thousand parts
[2:29:56] 999 are muslim and one part is jewish
[2:29:59] and they can't stand it they want to
[2:30:01] wipe them out that's how serious it is
[2:30:03] you see
[2:30:04] so the bride is not looking to just get
[2:30:07] along
[2:30:07] but you know we're not just looking to
[2:30:10] live out our part of the drama
[2:30:12] and live honest before god he's going to
[2:30:14] take us home one day
[2:30:16] we just want to be honest like paul was
[2:30:17] here you know according to his promise
[2:30:20] god will unfold his word on his schedule
[2:30:23] not ours
[2:30:24] so don't try to figure it out right when
[2:30:27] there's things that you don't understand
[2:30:29] why
[2:30:30] such as the building of the church or
[2:30:31] why we got a man with a gun out there
[2:30:33] just relax everything's okay you take
[2:30:36] care of yourself
[2:30:38] don't try to figure it out just be
[2:30:40] faithful be obedient
[2:30:41] okay so a long time ago brother branham
[2:30:45] said
[2:30:46] and you people with these saw blade
[2:30:48] tempers
[2:30:50] oh i'm sure that didn't apply anybody
[2:30:52] here because hey
[2:30:54] nice much christians in dallas
[2:30:57] you people with these saw blade tempers
[2:30:59] that's always spouting off in the mouth
[2:31:01] of somebody
[2:31:03] you can't put up with anything be
[2:31:05] careful you're guilty if you speak a
[2:31:07] word against
[2:31:08] your brother or sister that's not right
[2:31:12] not to just go around and tear things
[2:31:14] down you don't have to stick a knife in
[2:31:16] a man's back to kill him
[2:31:17] you can break his character and kill him
[2:31:20] kill his influence
[2:31:23] the scripture says be still in other
[2:31:26] words
[2:31:26] zip it i don't need your opinions i'm
[2:31:29] god i'll take care of things
[2:31:31] how can you kill people running your
[2:31:33] mouth without a filter
[2:31:36] yeah we're guilty
[2:31:40] in john chapter 12. turn back there a
[2:31:43] minute
[2:31:44] john 12 and verse where's it at night
[2:31:47] verse 9 12. john 9
[2:31:51] 4 john 12 and 9.
[2:31:55] much people of the jews therefore knew
[2:31:57] that he was there
[2:31:59] and they came not for jesus sake only
[2:32:01] but they might see lazarus whom he had
[2:32:02] raised from the dead
[2:32:03] it just happened but the chief priests
[2:32:06] consulted that they might put lazarus
[2:32:08] also to death
[2:32:09] so they're not happy that this man is
[2:32:11] resurrected from the dead and took out
[2:32:12] of the tomb
[2:32:13] they want to kill him again because
[2:32:16] by reason of him many of the jews went
[2:32:18] away and believed on jesus
[2:32:20] imagine that well and now over here in
[2:32:22] the book of acts and nearly
[2:32:24] church they continue under that same
[2:32:26] evil anointing
[2:32:27] trying to kill and destroy and it has
[2:32:31] only gotten worse
[2:32:32] okay so these 40 plus
[2:32:36] in verse 12 they were very serious
[2:32:39] total fast until paul is not breathing
[2:32:42] let's see how this unfolds verse
[2:32:46] 14 where are we at here
[2:32:50] so they came and they asked for you know
[2:32:52] they told the elders hey we're not going
[2:32:54] to eat till we kill him
[2:32:55] verse 15. now therefore ye with the
[2:32:58] council signified to the chief captain
[2:33:00] that he should bring him tomorrow as he
[2:33:03] would like maybe to inquire something
[2:33:04] more perfectly
[2:33:06] and um where you know we'll be near him
[2:33:09] we're ready to kill him
[2:33:10] so get him out here where we can see him
[2:33:12] and when paul's sister's son so paul had
[2:33:14] a sister
[2:33:14] she's married and so this little nephew
[2:33:17] heard them
[2:33:18] that they were you know conspiring he
[2:33:21] went and told it
[2:33:22] to the castle he entered into the castle
[2:33:25] and told paul okay so he
[2:33:26] went and told uncle paul what's going on
[2:33:28] and paul called one of the centurions
[2:33:30] and said
[2:33:31] ring this boy under the chief captain
[2:33:34] for he
[2:33:34] has a certain thing to say to him
[2:33:37] and so he took him over to the chief
[2:33:40] captain
[2:33:41] and i said paul the prisoner called me
[2:33:43] unto him
[2:33:44] and prayed me to bring this young man to
[2:33:46] you he's got something to say to you
[2:33:48] okay verse 19.
[2:33:49] then the chief captain took him by the
[2:33:51] hand and went with him aside privately
[2:33:54] and asked him uh what has you got to say
[2:33:57] and he said the jews have agreed to
[2:33:59] desire thee
[2:34:00] that they will just bring paul tomorrow
[2:34:02] morning down to the council
[2:34:04] like maybe ask a few more questions but
[2:34:07] do not
[2:34:08] yield unto them for they are lying in
[2:34:10] weight
[2:34:11] and there's 40 men and they bound
[2:34:13] themselves and so forth
[2:34:15] and they're ready to kill him so the
[2:34:16] chief captain verse 22
[2:34:19] then let the young man go and charge you
[2:34:21] hey don't tell anybody what you said to
[2:34:22] me
[2:34:23] okay so in verse 23 we've got 200
[2:34:27] foot soldiers okay not and these aren't
[2:34:30] little puny guys these are sturdy well
[2:34:32] fed dudes
[2:34:33] 200 foot soldiers 70 more on horse
[2:34:36] and 200 arms spear on foot
[2:34:40] 470 men verse 23
[2:34:43] to take one preacher down to caesarea
[2:34:47] that's right there in the bible so the
[2:34:49] chief of police claudius
[2:34:51] sent a letter along with the soldiers to
[2:34:54] felix the governor
[2:34:55] that's in 26-30 they took off in the
[2:34:58] dark
[2:34:59] all 470 moving slowly to about 40 miles
[2:35:03] from jerusalem and they stopped to rest
[2:35:05] then the next day
[2:35:07] the 400 returned to headquarters and the
[2:35:09] 70 on horseback continued with paul
[2:35:12] to caesarea verse 33.
[2:35:15] uh they left the horsemen to go with him
[2:35:17] and return to the castle
[2:35:18] verse 33 who when they came to caesarea
[2:35:21] and delivered the epistle to the
[2:35:23] governor in other words this letter of
[2:35:24] commendation
[2:35:25] presented paul also before him and when
[2:35:28] the governor had read the letter
[2:35:29] he asked of what province he was oh he's
[2:35:32] from cilicia
[2:35:33] he said i will hear thee and when thine
[2:35:36] accusers shall also come in others make
[2:35:37] this fair
[2:35:38] and he commanded him to be kept in
[2:35:40] herod's judgment hall
[2:35:43] so it wasn't exactly jail it was uh just
[2:35:45] a confinement with pleasant surroundings
[2:35:48] and if you come back tonight we'll cover
[2:35:50] chapter 24.
[2:35:52] god bless you
[2:35:56] we need some good musicians up here
[2:36:12] if the uh musicians could come brother
[2:36:15] billy could come
[2:36:16] you know as
[2:36:20] brother george was saying that you know
[2:36:22] a lot of what went through my mind is
[2:36:25] the statement that brother branham said
[2:36:27] that there would be another book of acts
[2:36:30] read off of this message
[2:36:33] okay i don't know if i want another book
[2:36:36] of acts right
[2:36:37] prison jail whooping you know
[2:36:40] we always look think it's going to be
[2:36:42] we're going to be empowered with
[2:36:44] miracles and we're going to go to the
[2:36:46] hospital and
[2:36:47] and no there was persecution that came
[2:36:50] with it
[2:36:51] there was testing that came with it
[2:36:53] there was commitment that came with
[2:36:55] it there was uh the proving of your
[2:36:59] faith
[2:37:00] the trying of your faith which is more
[2:37:02] precious than gold
[2:37:03] that comes with it you know anything
[2:37:06] that's not tested doesn't have any value
[2:37:10] it's the test that gives it the value
[2:37:14] that that's what makes it what it is
[2:37:18] because it's tried and true and you know
[2:37:21] we read the book of acts you know you
[2:37:23] could almost read it
[2:37:25] this was the book of the testing of the
[2:37:28] faith
[2:37:30] of our fathers it was a book of the
[2:37:34] testing of the faith of our fathers
[2:37:37] and what's supposed to be restored to us
[2:37:43] that's what's supposed to be restored to
[2:37:44] us the faith of our fathers the children
[2:37:46] are supposed to come back to that faith
[2:37:48] well how do we know
[2:37:50] it's that faith without
[2:37:53] the test so you can read the book of
[2:37:56] acts and look at the tests and the
[2:37:59] trials
[2:38:00] and the proving and the commitment
[2:38:03] and everything that's what's got to
[2:38:05] follow
[2:38:07] the life and it's like we said last
[2:38:10] time that we preached i don't know maybe
[2:38:13] wednesday
[2:38:14] night i don't know when it was but uh
[2:38:17] you know the miracles followed the
[2:38:20] attributes
[2:38:21] the attributes had to be expressed first
[2:38:24] that's right
[2:38:26] you know okay and you can't have a
[2:38:28] testimony without a test
[2:38:32] it's it's a boast until it's tested
[2:38:36] but then after it's proved it becomes a
[2:38:39] testimony
[2:38:41] and so when we read about the book of
[2:38:43] acts as brother george
[2:38:45] is going through this you know you can
[2:38:48] it gives you more of an idea of what's
[2:38:52] really going on in our lives
[2:38:56] that we're going to be tried we're going
[2:38:58] to be tested we're going to be singled
[2:39:00] out
[2:39:01] but what's also do we see the whole time
[2:39:04] that through all these tests he never
[2:39:06] forsook them
[2:39:07] amen he choose to manifest himself
[2:39:11] and and even the scripture tells when
[2:39:14] all men speak
[2:39:15] uh you know well of you take heed
[2:39:20] you know but you it just but when you're
[2:39:22] committed and you've got that revelation
[2:39:24] you just go forward
[2:39:26] amen so lord richly bless you uh
[2:39:29] brother juan where are you i've it are

[2:41:19] adversity

[2:49:09] god bless you this morning and
[2:49:14] brother juan is a
[2:49:18] neighbor of brother
[2:49:21] andrew lives in the same neighborhood
[2:49:23] and
[2:49:24] one would take walks during the
[2:49:27] day and they would he'd come across
[2:49:30] andrew and they'd have
[2:49:31] fellowship and and invited brother juan
[2:49:35] to
[2:49:35] come to church as you know he's been
[2:49:37] coming to our services for a while and
[2:49:41] hearing the gospel and the lord moved
[2:49:43] upon his heart
[2:49:44] to be baptized so we'll turn in our
[2:49:47] scriptures
[2:49:48] in the book of acts and and as we've
[2:49:51] just
[2:49:52] heard of the lesson how these men began
[2:49:55] to testify
[2:49:56] and uh once again uh
[2:50:00] the disciples began to come out of the
[2:50:02] upper room filled with the holy ghost
[2:50:04] and
[2:50:05] and the men perceived that they were
[2:50:07] drunk and
[2:50:08] peter placed the the event right in the
[2:50:11] scriptures this is
[2:50:12] that which was prophesied being
[2:50:15] fulfilled
[2:50:16] this is the pouring out of the spirit
[2:50:18] that was spoken of in the scriptures
[2:50:21] and when they they saw it and they
[2:50:24] brought witness to it
[2:50:27] those devout men that have come the
[2:50:30] devoutment of israel their heart was
[2:50:32] sort of pricked
[2:50:34] and when they actually saw the word of
[2:50:36] god being fulfilled
[2:50:38] and there's nothing that moves anybody
[2:50:40] more than seeing the word of god
[2:50:42] fulfilled amen not just words
[2:50:46] but as brother jordan shared with us
[2:50:48] this morning that word become manifested
[2:50:51] is what they they raise up against
[2:50:55] and this morning we're seeing the word
[2:50:57] of god made manifested amen
[2:51:00] and when they heard this they were print
[2:51:05] in their heart and said unto peter and
[2:51:07] the rest of the apostles
[2:51:10] men and brethren what shall we do then
[2:51:13] peter said unto them
[2:51:15] repent and be baptized every
[2:51:19] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[2:51:23] for the remission
[2:51:25] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[2:51:28] the holy ghost
[2:51:30] for the promise is unto you and to your
[2:51:34] children
[2:51:35] and to all that are afar off even as
[2:51:39] many as our lord our god shall call
[2:51:42] and with many other words did he testify
[2:51:46] and exhort saying save yourselves
[2:51:50] from this up toward generation and they
[2:51:53] that gladly received his words were
[2:51:56] baptized
[2:51:57] and the same day they were added unto
[2:52:00] them
[2:52:00] about 3 000 souls aren't you glad that
[2:52:03] god's still adding
[2:52:05] to his kingdom amen so it's so wonderful
