[33:48] but bu is speci special if he could come

[33:55] amen
[34:19] God bless
[34:20] you so I had told
[34:23] John earlier that I was going to sing a
[34:26] certain song
[34:28] and then I walked into church and God
[34:30] put another song in my heart so he's
[34:33] been thinking about that song but I got
[34:35] another
[34:36] one uh this is probably
[34:39] like weirdest week I've had I'm not the
[34:42] type of person that loses
[34:44] things this is a short testimony but uh
[34:48] Sunday
[34:49] night after communion
[34:52] service had a lot of stuff in my hands
[34:55] was walking up the stairs to go and
[34:58] sleep and I guess I forgot to lock my
[35:00] car and uh I didn't go to work Monday
[35:04] morning cuz I was trying to get this
[35:05] cough off of me and I go downstairs
[35:09] around 8 I
[35:11] think and my car door is open my stuff's
[35:15] outside my glove compartment's open like
[35:19] it looked like somebody went in there
[35:20] and had fun napkins everywhere papers
[35:24] everywhere they stole a
[35:27] air compressor for my
[35:29] tire um some other stuff that wasn't
[35:32] important the air compressor I missed
[35:33] but you know that's okay and then um
[35:38] that Tuesday I lose my
[35:41] wallet I'm I'm like okay something's
[35:44] something's up and then but luckily I
[35:46] found it cuz I remember the last time I
[35:48] knew I had it so it was easy to find and
[35:51] then uh two days ago I lost my car
[35:54] keys and I stopped working I told my B I
[35:57] said um I don't have my keys so he calls
[36:02] all the shuttles that we have and ask
[36:04] everybody to check so they stopped
[36:05] working to find my keys so about an hour
[36:08] and a half I spent checking all the cars
[36:10] that I took from dispatch up which is
[36:14] about 30 something cars checked every
[36:16] single one of them didn't find it I
[36:18] finally got to the last one I said God
[36:19] either it's here or it's in my pocket
[36:22] whether it's in this car in my pocket
[36:24] one or the other those are the options
[36:25] I'm giving you and I open the car door
[36:29] and I know if I look under the seat and
[36:31] I don't find it that ends the search so
[36:34] I don't look there I look where I know
[36:36] it's not so I looked in the passenger
[36:38] seat I looked in the back I looked in
[36:40] the trunk I looked everywhere and then I
[36:42] finally got to this year I said Lord
[36:43] please just please let it be here and I
[36:46] looked down disappointment it wasn't
[36:48] there so I'm like Lord what is this and
[36:51] then that's so I got down I started
[36:52] praying I said God I need my keys I got
[36:55] to get home and so somehow and my boss
[36:58] tells me check your car now I knew it
[37:01] wasn't in my car cuz I was late to work
[37:03] that morning and I went downstairs I
[37:06] remember vividly stopping at the stairs
[37:09] and turning off my car and hearing it
[37:11] beep twice I'm like okay yeah I'm good
[37:13] so I run downstairs so I knew I had it
[37:16] he says go and check your car maybe it's
[37:18] in there I said it's not in there I know
[37:20] it's not in there he said go and check
[37:22] you so I walked to my car and someone
[37:25] tells me your door's open
[37:27] I said no it can't be the door opens and
[37:30] then I look in a spot where I never put
[37:32] my keys it's sitting right there in
[37:35] between two things just sitting there I
[37:37] said wow what placement I says so I just
[37:42] want to sing this song

[1:02:00] Jesus
[1:02:02] amen amen God bless you may be
[1:02:08] seated wonderful to be in the house of
[1:02:10] the Lord and be in the
[1:02:13] battle
[1:02:15] amen and uh he certainly uh he knows how
[1:02:19] to
[1:02:20] fight and you know what happens when you
[1:02:22] meet somebody that knows how to fight
[1:02:24] fight you go learn to
[1:02:27] fight I was a little fella I still am a
[1:02:30] little fella but I was a real little
[1:02:32] little little
[1:02:34] fella and all through until the summer
[1:02:39] between my eighth grade year and my
[1:02:42] ninth grade year I grew six Ines and put
[1:02:46] on about
[1:02:48] 50
[1:02:50] pounds and uh I used to get beat up a
[1:02:53] lot but I beat up a lot of people that
[1:02:56] summer because all of a sudden I felt
[1:02:58] like King
[1:03:00] Kong you know and Satan uh he's been
[1:03:03] beating my body but every time he beats
[1:03:05] me I purpose in my heart to destroy him
[1:03:08] someplace
[1:03:10] else amen so I I'm hoping I can go steal
[1:03:13] some Souls out of his grasp amen I can
[1:03:18] get people delivered from some of the
[1:03:21] sicknesses that he imposes you know
[1:03:24] we're
[1:03:25] not the enemy he's the enemy amen and if
[1:03:30] someone offends you it wasn't them that
[1:03:33] offended you it's like brother Murphy
[1:03:35] said there was a voice in them that's
[1:03:38] right that was speaking that really
[1:03:40] wasn't their voice and uh and that's
[1:03:43] with it purpose in my heart I'd like to
[1:03:45] read a little
[1:03:47] scripture uh found in St John and been
[1:03:51] the uh theme that's been on my heart
[1:03:56] for uh this meeting and uh if you read
[1:04:01] it it's a simple scripture but it really
[1:04:04] caused me to stir
[1:04:07] deep inside and it said says let your
[1:04:13] let not your heart be troubled amen
[1:04:16] you've believed in God believe also in
[1:04:21] me in my father's house are many men
[1:04:24] itions if it were not so I would have
[1:04:28] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[1:04:33] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:04:37] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:04:41] myself that where I am there ye may be
[1:04:47] also he
[1:04:49] says and whether I go ye know
[1:04:54] and the way ye
[1:04:58] know and Thomas said unto him Lord we
[1:05:02] know not whether thou goest and how can
[1:05:06] we know the
[1:05:08] way and that struck me very much and it
[1:05:14] became the theme in my heart for the
[1:05:17] meetings is show us the
[1:05:20] way you know they knew he said you know
[1:05:23] the way but they
[1:05:26] didn't you know and I know Thomas he
[1:05:29] takes a lot of heat but you know he went
[1:05:33] on to bring the gospel all through the
[1:05:35] area of India and and and all down
[1:05:39] through that part of the world and
[1:05:42] because he was full of that Zeal that we
[1:05:44] heard about last night that jealousy for
[1:05:48] the gospel um I
[1:05:51] I notice that every time there's great
[1:05:54] confusion and how many would agree that
[1:05:57] the world's
[1:05:58] confused and there there things start to
[1:06:02] rise up and and uh divisions come in and
[1:06:07] separations come in and and we've had
[1:06:10] great events great leaders great people
[1:06:12] that are part of this message that have
[1:06:15] left the scene uh great the great voices
[1:06:19] of this hour have been silenced one by
[1:06:23] one the people that knew our messenger
[1:06:26] and and walked with them there's very
[1:06:29] few left and it press me so much in my
[1:06:34] spirit
[1:06:36] to ask the Lord I say
[1:06:40] Lord we need to know the
[1:06:43] way which way do you want us to go what
[1:06:47] path do you want us to take what what
[1:06:51] light do you want us to shine
[1:06:55] what is it that you want us to stand for
[1:06:59] and
[1:07:01] represent and you when you have people
[1:07:04] around you uh that were there you find
[1:07:09] out that you lean on them you know you
[1:07:11] have that thing you could always call
[1:07:13] this brother or talk to that brother I
[1:07:15] always felt that way with my dad if I
[1:07:17] ever had a business problem or
[1:07:20] electrical problem or I just knew he was
[1:07:23] there and one day he wasn't and I
[1:07:26] realized
[1:07:28] that I had
[1:07:30] to start
[1:07:32] walking and I think that time it is for
[1:07:35] all of us to realize that there's a
[1:07:38] place that's been prepared for us and we
[1:07:41] need to start finding the way there and
[1:07:44] what it is that God would have us to do
[1:07:47] on that way and I just didn't want him
[1:07:50] to speak to the individual a lot of
[1:07:52] times we ask God to speak to us
[1:07:55] individually speak to the individually
[1:07:57] deal with the heart but my particular
[1:08:01] desire for this meeting was that he
[1:08:04] would speak to us as a
[1:08:06] church as a body not something to go out
[1:08:11] and find maybe individual problems or
[1:08:15] weaknesses or sicknesses but that we we
[1:08:18] are a
[1:08:19] body you know what I mean and we're part
[1:08:22] of a body and we're fitted and joined
[1:08:25] together and God has called us from all
[1:08:28] parts of the earth and all places and
[1:08:30] assembled us here and and brought us
[1:08:33] together the ones that he's brought
[1:08:35] together here and he did that
[1:08:38] work why we don't know but that's what
[1:08:41] we want to know Lord what are we here
[1:08:44] for show us the way what what do we want
[1:08:48] to be as as a body for years we've we've
[1:08:53] grown and and and little by little by
[1:08:56] little family by Family Birth by birth
[1:09:00] we've grown but it it you come to the
[1:09:03] time where if I could just say this
[1:09:06] you're big enough to
[1:09:10] fight you know what I mean you're big
[1:09:13] enough to have an impact you're big
[1:09:16] enough to do something if everybody
[1:09:20] comes together and we could find the way
[1:09:24] that God wants us to go the vision that
[1:09:27] God wants us to have not the vision of
[1:09:31] another place and and and not the uh
[1:09:35] work that somebody else is doing but
[1:09:39] that God would find what is the work
[1:09:41] that you would have for our body to do
[1:09:44] what light do you want us to show in
[1:09:48] this place this 6 million 7 million
[1:09:52] people that are starting to surround
[1:09:55] this area people are pouring in
[1:09:59] here there's 400 and some people a day
[1:10:03] move to this
[1:10:06] city and
[1:10:08] and there's there hardly a voice out
[1:10:12] there anymore that's willing to stand
[1:10:17] for the truth and if there's ever a time
[1:10:19] that we need to come together and to
[1:10:22] find a divine
[1:10:24] purpose and a Divine reason that each of
[1:10:27] us plays and what it is that we're
[1:10:32] bringing
[1:10:33] to this area and I I thought brother
[1:10:37] Murphy last night is
[1:10:40] really begin
[1:10:43] to touch on that I thought it was
[1:10:47] miraculous he said the first thing we
[1:10:50] all need to do is become more zealous
[1:10:53] and more jealous over this
[1:10:57] message there's no reason for us to hold
[1:10:59] our peace we've got the greatest word
[1:11:02] that's ever been
[1:11:04] spoken we we we have we have a truth now
[1:11:09] that explained what's going on more than
[1:11:12] anybody else can ever explain we've got
[1:11:16] prophecies after prophecies after
[1:11:18] prophecies that are coming to pass every
[1:11:21] minute surrounding us we got Israel in a
[1:11:24] war we've got a government that's
[1:11:27] selling our morals down the two and we
[1:11:31] have Americans and people coming from
[1:11:34] all over the world and they don't know
[1:11:37] where to go they don't know the way but
[1:11:41] he said you know the way amen and so it
[1:11:45] it behooves us to to stand back and say
[1:11:48] wait a minute Lord what is that way
[1:11:50] Thomas said we don't know the way show
[1:11:52] us the way where are you
[1:11:55] going and I think when we begin to sum
[1:11:59] this up in our heart and we begin to
[1:12:03] really start getting to the place that
[1:12:06] we start joining ourselves one to
[1:12:09] another for the cause of this
[1:12:14] message to stand for this message like
[1:12:17] we've never stood for it before you know
[1:12:21] they want to make it a curse to say God
[1:12:24] sent a
[1:12:25] prophet but you know something God sent
[1:12:28] a
[1:12:29] prophet that's the truth and he had the
[1:12:33] word of life for this age he had the
[1:12:37] pathway for this age he had the way for
[1:12:40] this age there was there's no
[1:12:43] escape from this world without the
[1:12:47] guidance of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 and
[1:12:52] Revelations 10:7 it's not that people
[1:12:56] are evil it's that they don't know the
[1:13:00] way and I I I trust that you will let
[1:13:07] this services not only speak to you
[1:13:10] individually as a member of the body but
[1:13:14] it would also speak to you to the fact
[1:13:17] that you're fitted and joined
[1:13:20] together with the rest of the body we
[1:13:23] preach so much on
[1:13:25] individuality that we have no
[1:13:30] Unity we preach so much on our own way
[1:13:33] and and our own responsibility that we
[1:13:36] fail to understand that we have
[1:13:38] responsibility to one
[1:13:41] another and I'm I'm the worst I I think
[1:13:44] if anybody needs Improvement on that I
[1:13:46] do but I'm asking the Lord Lord make me
[1:13:50] a part of the way show show me the way
[1:13:56] where do you want us as a body we're
[1:13:59] going to have a new building by the
[1:14:00] grace of the Lord if he comes before
[1:14:03] that thank you Jesus yeah even so come
[1:14:07] quickly Lord Jesus but if he doesn't
[1:14:12] then I I don't want to if there's an
[1:14:14] empty seat I want to fill it up with a
[1:14:17] lost soul that's right I want us just to
[1:14:19] become a
[1:14:21] lighthouse everybody out there with the
[1:14:24] same Zeal the same fire the same
[1:14:26] jealousy that our brother spoke
[1:14:29] about the other night that Burning Flame
[1:14:33] within us that and he he gave examples
[1:14:37] of people you know brother Roger came to
[1:14:40] me he said you know Brother David he
[1:14:42] said that statistic that the government
[1:14:46] gives is a million people being killed
[1:14:48] in Rwanda he said I was
[1:14:51] there I watched the dead bodies I I took
[1:14:56] 150 kids out of the army and brought
[1:14:59] them to safety he said the reality of
[1:15:01] the real number was more like 4
[1:15:05] million
[1:15:07] genocides and things are happening all
[1:15:11] over the world men are losing their mind
[1:15:15] but there should be a people that have
[1:15:17] the mind of Christ that's
[1:15:20] right and if if if you if you could see
[1:15:23] that this is an assembly of people from
[1:15:28] everywhere and every one of you is
[1:15:31] important and nobody can take your place
[1:15:35] and there's no big eyes and there are no
[1:15:37] little you so in these meetings I'd ask
[1:15:40] you not only to look at where you stand
[1:15:43] individually with the Lord but ask
[1:15:46] yourself where do you stand in the body
[1:15:49] where do you stand in the
[1:15:51] church what labor are are you putting
[1:15:54] forth and what labor do we
[1:15:57] have as a body and thus my prayer when
[1:16:02] Thomas said he says how can we know the
[1:16:07] way we know the way by his word I am the
[1:16:13] way the truth the life no man cometh
[1:16:17] unto the father but by me let's seek and
[1:16:21] pray that the the Lord would not only
[1:16:24] show us the way as individuals but he'd
[1:16:26] show us the way as a church he'd show us
[1:16:28] the way of the body he would speak to
[1:16:30] our hearts and bring it deep into us in
[1:16:33] the part that we play and I think it'll
[1:16:37] be wonderful sorry brother Michael for
[1:16:40] that but I I I know that you can touch
[1:16:44] the high voltage line anytime you put
[1:16:46] your hand out so I'm certainly not
[1:16:48] taking any fire from you uh I it's it's
[1:16:52] been a privilege to to have
[1:16:55] uh uh brother Tom and sister Joanne and
[1:16:57] their three boys with us and their wives
[1:17:00] and the ray family and they've been a
[1:17:02] blessing to me uh and my family and it's
[1:17:06] been blessing so would would all of you
[1:17:09] stand up for us please this is the whole
[1:17:12] Ray family and not their children but
[1:17:16] there they
[1:17:21] are God bless
[1:17:25] brother Tom is uh brother boll's
[1:17:28] son-in-law and and brother Boll has uh
[1:17:32] you know he's he's uh he's been his
[1:17:37] years in the gospel and and no longer
[1:17:40] physically able to carry on the work and
[1:17:43] brother Tom's been carrying on that work
[1:17:46] as the Lord leads him so we're certainly
[1:17:49] grateful for that but you know brother
[1:17:51] Michael he he this is the first place he
[1:17:55] preached a a real
[1:18:00] sermon anybody can preach at home you
[1:18:02] know where you get
[1:18:04] cuddled you know and and everybody's
[1:18:07] there and Grandpa's there and Grandma's
[1:18:10] there and all the kids and everybody
[1:18:11] loves you but he I always think he cut
[1:18:14] his teeth right here you know and he
[1:18:17] came and preached for us and I'll never
[1:18:19] forget he was preaching and he was under
[1:18:21] the inspiration and and he grabbed a
[1:18:24] piece of paper and he curled it up like
[1:18:27] that and he he threw it up in the air
[1:18:31] and uh I went and got that piece of
[1:18:34] paper and I pinned it on the wall in my
[1:18:37] office and I called it
[1:18:40] inspiration well Mike I think one of my
[1:18:43] cleaners thought it was a piece of
[1:18:45] wrinkled paper I stuck on the wall but
[1:18:48] uh but to me it meant so
[1:18:51] much and I I saw a real man of God with
[1:18:55] a real gift because I saw the
[1:18:59] inspiration come down and take it over
[1:19:04] and that stirred my heart and I knew I
[1:19:05] found someone that could find the mind
[1:19:07] of God I hear a lot of preachers anybody
[1:19:10] can go to this message and put together
[1:19:13] a
[1:19:15] sermon it's not the knowledge that makes
[1:19:18] you a preacher it's the inspiration and
[1:19:21] the move of the Holy spirit amen and I
[1:19:24] saw that and my heart was endeared to
[1:19:26] him and and uh I knew he was going to
[1:19:29] give a lot
[1:19:31] up a lot of professional Pursuit and a
[1:19:34] lot of things in order to give his life
[1:19:37] to that and that meant much to me and
[1:19:40] then last time he came here how many
[1:19:42] remember the service about pre-venture
[1:19:44] shooting an
[1:19:46] arrow amen just putting your request up
[1:19:51] there pre-advent Venture it would find
[1:19:54] the Mark just the faith to to to put it
[1:19:58] that that so inspired me and I told
[1:20:00] myself I'm waiting for that Arrow to
[1:20:03] land amen so I I want to let you know

[1:23:57] it's the spiritual food that gets us
[1:23:59] where we need to be which is eternity

[1:24:03] scriptures
[1:24:06] tonight Matthew 22 is where we'll

[1:24:20] now to pull on the word
[1:24:23] you help me because I'm going to need it
[1:24:29] amen Matthew
[1:24:31] 22 very familiar
[1:24:34] Parable verse two it says the Kingdom of
[1:24:37] Heaven is like unto a certain King which
[1:24:40] made marriage for his son and sent forth
[1:24:43] his servants to call them that were
[1:24:46] bidden to the
[1:24:48] wedding and they would not come again he
[1:24:51] sent forth other servants saying tell
[1:24:53] them which are bidden behold I have
[1:24:55] prepared my dinner my oxen and my
[1:24:58] fatlings are killed and all things are
[1:25:00] ready come unto the
[1:25:02] marriage you can imagine as the servants
[1:25:04] went forth and they were conveying the
[1:25:07] earnestness and the the excitement of
[1:25:09] the king and here they were conveying
[1:25:11] this message come bid them it's all
[1:25:14] ready the the marriage Feast is prepared
[1:25:16] and but the verse five says but they
[1:25:18] made light of it and went their ways one
[1:25:21] to his farm and another to his
[1:25:23] merchandise and the remnant took his
[1:25:25] servants and in treated them
[1:25:27] spitefully and slew
[1:25:30] them incredible but when the king heard
[1:25:33] thereof he was wroth understandably and
[1:25:36] sent forth his armies and destroyed
[1:25:38] those murderers and burned up their City
[1:25:41] then saith he to his servants the
[1:25:42] wedding is ready but they which are
[1:25:44] bidden are not
[1:25:47] worthy go ye therefore into the highways
[1:25:50] and as many as ye shall find bid to the
[1:25:52] marriage so those servants went into the
[1:25:54] highways and gathered together all as
[1:25:56] many as they found both bad and good and
[1:25:59] the wedding was furnished with guests
[1:26:02] and when the king king came in to see
[1:26:04] the guests he saw there was a man or
[1:26:06] there a man which had not on a wedding
[1:26:09] garment and he saith unto him friend how
[1:26:12] camest thou in hither not having a
[1:26:14] wedding garment and he was
[1:26:18] speechless then said the King D's
[1:26:20] servants bid him bind him handed foot
[1:26:23] take him away and cast him into outer
[1:26:26] Darkness there shall be weeping and
[1:26:28] nashing of teeth for many are called but
[1:26:32] few are
[1:26:33] chosen let's just
[1:26:38] pray Heavenly Father Lord
[1:26:43] tonight Lord I know the heart of each
[1:26:45] one
[1:26:46] Hees Lord I want to be at that
[1:26:49] Feast I desire to be with the king of
[1:26:52] glory Lord in here it's even would seem
[1:26:56] unfathomable that the response of the
[1:26:58] invited ones that Lord even slew your
[1:27:02] servants that beckoned and called but
[1:27:05] Lord there's a group of people here
[1:27:06] tonight that are saying Lord we're
[1:27:08] hearing the call and we're responding
[1:27:11] Lord and maybe there's one tonight that
[1:27:13] needs to respond may this be their
[1:27:15] moment tonight Lord Lord as the king is
[1:27:18] still
[1:27:19] beckoning Lord these are words that you
[1:27:22] spoke Lord you spoke this Parable and
[1:27:25] Lord your word is eternal and so Lord
[1:27:27] that word still Goes Forth the call
[1:27:29] still goes forth so Lord May Lord your
[1:27:32] word Lord in Be Inspired tonight to your
[1:27:35] people may we receive it with open heart
[1:27:38] and Lord you would do your Mighty work
[1:27:40] tonight in your people we pray in Jesus
[1:27:42] Christ's name amen amen amen you may
[1:27:45] have your seats
[1:27:48] tonight just going to read Isaiah 4 64
[1:27:51] while you're
[1:27:52] you don't have to turn to
[1:27:55] it Isaiah 64 and I'll turn I'll try and
[1:27:58] tie these together but but but we are
[1:28:00] all an unclean thing and all our
[1:28:03] righteousnesses are as filthy rags and
[1:28:07] we all do Fade as a leaf and our
[1:28:08] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[1:28:12] away all our righteousness are as filthy
[1:28:15] rags and I want to speak on a little T
[1:28:18] subject tonight a call to put on His
[1:28:22] Garment or maybe a call to put on
[1:28:25] Rapture and just to speak a little bit
[1:28:27] about the the the subject here I feel a
[1:28:29] little bit like a uh uh I can imagine a
[1:28:32] racehorse at the gate as the gate's been
[1:28:35] just holding him back a little while and
[1:28:37] he's just quivering ready to go you know
[1:28:40] and I can just imagine his little
[1:28:41] muscles there just just ready for that
[1:28:42] gate to to smash open and and hit the
[1:28:45] hit the racetrack I kind of feel like
[1:28:46] that a little bit so I'm just going to
[1:28:48] try and hold myself back the gate is now
[1:28:50] open I'm just going to to try and walk
[1:28:52] out a little bit and then I'll run huh
[1:28:55] but that depends on you a little bit if
[1:28:58] you start pulling maybe I'll run faster
[1:29:00] or or sooner I should say
[1:29:02] but here we go but the scripture says a
[1:29:05] call in verse three the servants were
[1:29:07] sent forth and a call was that was made
[1:29:10] out there to bid them to the wedding you
[1:29:13] know and when a call comes from a
[1:29:14] dignitary you know generally that would
[1:29:16] create quite a large stir you know when
[1:29:18] a call Goes Forth you know to have a
[1:29:20] king said hey you want to come to my to
[1:29:22] my dinner or to my event of such and I
[1:29:24] know that everybody has their circle of
[1:29:26] of influences or maybe their circle of
[1:29:28] interests I should say that you know
[1:29:30] there's if someone called you from a
[1:29:32] maybe an area of Interest some of you
[1:29:34] maybe young men maybe it's sports or
[1:29:36] something of that nature uh maybe it's
[1:29:38] somebody that loves investing and you
[1:29:40] know Warren Buffett would call you to to
[1:29:41] the to come to have a one-on-one
[1:29:44] invitation to his table to give you the
[1:29:46] his investment mind and say I've got the
[1:29:48] the the uh the wisdom that if I can just
[1:29:50] sit with you I want you to come to my
[1:29:52] table and I'm going to give you what you
[1:29:54] need to succeed and be a billionaire
[1:29:56] like
[1:29:58] me I tell you you'd be like I'm there is
[1:30:01] it today tomorrow what what's the date
[1:30:03] marking in my calendar 18,000 reminders
[1:30:06] you'd have them set so that you wouldn't
[1:30:07] miss the moment e that's what You' be
[1:30:10] doing because you were called and you
[1:30:12] would want to make sure you're
[1:30:13] responding right and then you'd probably
[1:30:15] walk around for the next 3 weeks or
[1:30:17] however long it was and you'd be saying
[1:30:19] hey guess where I'm going I'm got a
[1:30:22] personal invite with Warren Buffett he's
[1:30:24] going to give me what I need to be a
[1:30:26] billionaire oh and you'd go to the next
[1:30:28] person you say hey just in case you
[1:30:30] didn't know and you'd be like I heard it
[1:30:32] 1,800 times you're going to see Warren
[1:30:34] buff you're like yeah that's exactly
[1:30:35] where I'm going because you'd be so
[1:30:37] excited because he's called you to give
[1:30:39] you what he needs now do you sisters
[1:30:41] that probably means Zippo to you but
[1:30:43] pick a person write the name down and
[1:30:46] say if they called me I bet you you'd be
[1:30:49] responding right but I'd say tonight is
[1:30:51] just as we open up the service but our
[1:30:53] Briand says the people say he says the
[1:30:55] people that's got the Holy Spirit they
[1:30:56] say he they brag too much about it he
[1:30:59] said we can't brag enough about it it's
[1:31:01] something to curl about you've been
[1:31:04] invited to a feast it's something to
[1:31:06] curl about he says we've been invited to
[1:31:08] a wedding supper of the Son of God it's
[1:31:10] worth walking on the street testifying
[1:31:13] telling every creature you come in
[1:31:14] contact with what a good thing it is
[1:31:17] that you're invited to a wedding supper
[1:31:19] amen he said God Almighty has selected
[1:31:21] you from the slums of the earth to
[1:31:23] attend the supper of his beloved Son oh
[1:31:26] what an
[1:31:27] invitation it w in buffet pales in
[1:31:30] contrast what an invitation he said it's
[1:31:33] worth a 100 billion president suppers to
[1:31:37] attend that come on a 100 billion that's
[1:31:41] a whole lot of President suppers to
[1:31:42] attend maybe you don't want to attend
[1:31:44] your president's supper per se but maybe
[1:31:47] if it was Lincoln or something like that
[1:31:49] or George Washington
[1:31:50] right
[1:31:52] well you know if you had that
[1:31:53] opportunity you'd probably you know fuss
[1:31:55] and make sure you're all looking just
[1:31:56] perfect you know you got the right
[1:31:58] attire on the the suit and tie whatever
[1:32:00] you need to be in just to make sure that
[1:32:02] you're prepared to attend the banquet
[1:32:05] amen amen and that's what we're talking
[1:32:07] tonight but you know if you got the call
[1:32:09] let's just run down with the Warren
[1:32:11] Buffett this morning or this evening
[1:32:13] maybe somebody pick you know name who
[1:32:14] who's like a big you know who's your
[1:32:16] football star

[1:32:54] maybe at this personal one-on-one
[1:32:56] opportunity you'd be pretty

[1:35:04] something inside is saying wait a second
[1:35:06] something's speaking to me something's
[1:35:08] beckoning me it's you're unable to miss
[1:35:11] the
[1:35:13] call amen there you were as butter brown
[1:35:16] talks about that little Eagle scream or
[1:35:18] that little eaglet sitting there in the
[1:35:19] little farmyard how many knows the story
[1:35:21] so well you can lift your hands it's
[1:35:23] okay it's
[1:35:25] church have well done that's right this
[1:35:27] is just Saturday night amen we can just
[1:35:30] relax and man but we know the little
[1:35:32] story of the little Eagle as he's
[1:35:33] sitting in the barnyard I can imagine
[1:35:35] that little eaglet sitting there and the
[1:35:37] the den of the cluck you know and how
[1:35:39] terrible that have been as this little
[1:35:41] guy or I should say big guy is sitting
[1:35:43] there in the middle of all these
[1:35:43] chickens and they mo you
[1:35:46] know God there's no God or there's you
[1:35:48] know whether it's Trinity or this or
[1:35:51] Apple in the garden he's just looking
[1:35:53] and running around listening to all this
[1:35:55] B B B there in the chicken yard all his
[1:35:57] own thoughts on the matter of what they
[1:35:59] feel you know God means or this that and
[1:36:01] the other and he's just in this den of
[1:36:04] noise who is in a d of noise whether
[1:36:08] some denominational realm or whatever it
[1:36:09] was or in some World worldly system
[1:36:12] somewhere or whatever and just a whole
[1:36:13] bunch of noise that you were listening
[1:36:15] to but then here he was trying to peck
[1:36:17] on the ground and trying to sustain
[1:36:19] himself somewhere and there he'd peck on
[1:36:21] little worm and he'd seriously and he'd
[1:36:24] try and swallow what they're trying to
[1:36:26] throw down his throat spiritually
[1:36:30] speaking just something inside of him is
[1:36:33] rejecting it I can't swallow that I
[1:36:36] can't believe that there's three Gods
[1:36:38] there's no way it was an apple in the
[1:36:39] garden something was just that's just
[1:36:42] not right for me amen because you're an
[1:36:45] eagle something was crying out for more
[1:36:48] amen and so you're trying to choke down
[1:36:51] food are you kidding me there's no
[1:36:52] Miracles anymore there's nothing there's
[1:36:54] nothing God doesn't move on the scene
[1:36:56] anymore like this you can't be born
[1:36:58] again you can't be transformed that's
[1:37:00] just stuff of the past that's somewhere
[1:37:02] back in Acts but it's not
[1:37:05] today that's all that is but your little
[1:37:08] Eagle heart is saying I can't stomach
[1:37:12] that well
[1:37:14] sir but then
[1:37:17] something something caught your ear it
[1:37:20] was a call
[1:37:22] From Another Dimension amen he's saying
[1:37:24] come up a little higher come up a little
[1:37:27] up a little Bride come a little higher
[1:37:29] what was it you were hearing a screech
[1:37:31] you were hearing a call that was
[1:37:33] beckoning to something a little deeper
[1:37:35] than what the little chicken yard could
[1:37:36] give you right amen you say wow that's
[1:37:39] just a humble little sounding Prophet
[1:37:41] really could it really be something like
[1:37:43] that everybody just looks at the they
[1:37:44] look at the bad your skin but don't
[1:37:46] realize the voices you heard last night
[1:37:48] behind the voice that was screaming out
[1:37:50] to you come my little Bride come to this
[1:37:53] wedding
[1:37:55] supper but Brenham said he would not
[1:37:58] understand it no matter how he tried to
[1:38:00] tell him an eagle he didn't know what an
[1:38:03] eagle was cuz all he looked around was
[1:38:06] at chickens he had nothing to identify
[1:38:09] with well I I look different but no no
[1:38:13] you're just a chicken but I just don't
[1:38:15] we look different like I've got really
[1:38:16] big claws and you got little ones and I
[1:38:18] got a beak and you got a tiny one we're
[1:38:20] no no it's the same as us because he had
[1:38:23] no reference point to show him what he
[1:38:26] really was nothing has given a visual to
[1:38:29] say hey this is a he didn't he couldn't
[1:38:31] stand in front of the mirror no one else
[1:38:33] he stood there but no no one else he had
[1:38:35] nothing to say what an eagle was but
[1:38:38] then something started to fly something
[1:38:42] started to move in his realm maybe in a
[1:38:44] church service one day somewhere where
[1:38:46] God started to move and that little eag
[1:38:48] that big eagle mommy Eagle started to
[1:38:50] fly over that little Barnyard brother
[1:38:52] brandom says he would not understand it
[1:38:55] understood it until he seen something
[1:38:57] that reflected him he said then he that
[1:39:00] he reflected rather and when we see not
[1:39:03] a denomination not a good neighbor but a
[1:39:06] Son of God molded in the image of God
[1:39:08] with the dynamic power of God to answer
[1:39:11] the request of this day amen he's the
[1:39:14] same yesterday today and forever he said
[1:39:16] ain't no hen going to hold you no sir
[1:39:21] he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to
[1:39:23] begin with and he recognizes it imagine
[1:39:26] the first moment when he saw that Mama
[1:39:29] eagle and he's like wait a second that
[1:39:32] looks a lot like me she's got feet like
[1:39:35] me she's got big wings like me she's got
[1:39:38] a big beak like me that must be who I am
[1:39:42] that's where I came from oh my there
[1:39:45] there was a squabble in the chicken yard
[1:39:47] at that point in time I can imagine
[1:39:49] trying to tell him well you know no way
[1:39:52] there's there's no way you're just could
[1:39:53] stay down here with us but there was no
[1:39:55] way because when the chickens started to
[1:39:57] see the eagle I can
[1:40:00] imagine Eagle's like that's
[1:40:04] food that's right there that little
[1:40:07] Eagle was sitting in food all the
[1:40:13] time yeah Eagles could eat chickens
[1:40:17] clear the yard there's an enemy overhead
[1:40:21] eag's like what do you mean that's looks
[1:40:23] like me Hallelujah who says an enemy get
[1:40:27] undercover it's just a cult it's just we
[1:40:30] don't believe in prophets anymore this
[1:40:31] thing's going to kill you no sir this is
[1:40:34] going to give me life this is going to
[1:40:37] get me out of the chicken
[1:40:38] yard
[1:40:40] amen that depends on who you're where
[1:40:42] you're what seed inside of you amen as
[1:40:45] someone said many times you say well you
[1:40:47] called me a chicken someone I don't know
[1:40:49] over the years they say well I didn't
[1:40:50] hear no chicken they call me an eagle
[1:40:52] what are you what are you identifying
[1:40:54] with that's my reflection I see Eagle
[1:40:58] reflection yes
[1:41:02] sir yeah Hebrews 1 prophets are done and
[1:41:06] gone come on this is this you got to
[1:41:09] stick with the worms but once you taste
[1:41:11] a little bit once you get a little bit
[1:41:13] of Eagle food once you start feeding on
[1:41:16] the word of the hour you start receiving
[1:41:18] the message and the word you say you
[1:41:21] satisfied with what that barnyard could
[1:41:23] give you
[1:41:29] anymore Revelations
[1:41:31] 22 and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:41:36] is a call said let him that heareth say
[1:41:39] come and let him that a thirst come and
[1:41:43] whosoever will let him take of the Water
[1:41:45] of Life freely you mean you mean I got
[1:41:48] to leave all this behind I can imagine
[1:41:50] the Eagle's like well there ain't much
[1:41:52] here to leave I'm going to just start to
[1:41:54] fly but you know what he didn't know how
[1:41:55] to do that quite yet he'd never done
[1:41:58] that before he his wings he'd been held
[1:42:00] back all this time brother brandham says
[1:42:03] the invite went out call him to come and
[1:42:06] said just just me for a moment and here
[1:42:08] he said he's I'm calling you he's at the
[1:42:11] door he said he says I'm out here to
[1:42:12] give you a robe he says and you try to
[1:42:14] climb up your own moral stepladder or by
[1:42:16] some Creed or some church brother you're
[1:42:18] going to find yourself the same way
[1:42:20] referencing the robless one he said
[1:42:22] every man comes by the door is going to
[1:42:25] get the same robe and that robe is the
[1:42:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost every man pays
[1:42:31] the same price amen no man comes to me
[1:42:33] except the father draws him but I want
[1:42:36] my ear to be listening to the sound of
[1:42:38] the cry saying come are you a thirst
[1:42:41] come come to this marriage table amen he
[1:42:44] says that barard stuff didn't do him
[1:42:45] good nothing no more and he said all
[1:42:47] things are possible and he starts to get
[1:42:49] off the ground he said just jump a
[1:42:51] little bit you mean all I got to do is
[1:42:53] believe have faith all things are
[1:42:55] possible really is it that easy it's
[1:42:58] just that easy he said that's what's the
[1:43:00] matter so many Christians today they
[1:43:02] can't get their feet off the ground he
[1:43:04] said that old mom he said Son jump
[1:43:06] you're an eagle come up where I am you
[1:43:09] mean I just got to believe your word
[1:43:11] every word is it that hard and simple
[1:43:14] it's that simple just start to read just
[1:43:16] start to take it in just start to
[1:43:18] believe what I've said to you okay I'll
[1:43:20] he starts to jump that little Eagle
[1:43:22] start to jump a little more believe a
[1:43:24] little more read the scripture a little
[1:43:25] more and his wings start to move it
[1:43:28] wouldn't take too long for a big old
[1:43:30] Eagle to do about two flaps and you
[1:43:32] realize you've set your wings to The
[1:43:35] Winds of Faith you can fly in a higher
[1:43:39] Place
[1:43:41] amen he said M I never jumped in my life
[1:43:44] she said well you
[1:43:45] jump said well I've never really stepped
[1:43:48] out in faith like that before you jump
[1:43:50] yes you jump a little higher he gave you
[1:43:54] the word and you believe it now he says
[1:43:56] you're an eagle to begin with you're not
[1:43:58] a chicken so he made his first jump
[1:44:01] flopped his wings didn't Doo didn't do
[1:44:03] too good but he got off the
[1:44:06] ground am man it did not take too long
[1:44:09] after that where he was more than just
[1:44:10] off the ground but he started to fly
[1:44:12] because a call was going forth and he
[1:44:14] was drawn beckoned to a higher Place
[1:44:19] amen a seat of God daughter of God a Son
[1:44:22] of God they're going to be drawn by a
[1:44:24] call because a seed in your heart is
[1:44:27] drawing you into a higher place with
[1:44:32] him so we go into the
[1:44:34] scripture so many heard the call so many
[1:44:38] were
[1:44:41] beckoned but they've looked at the
[1:44:43] Garment of the word
[1:44:44] today and they're like yeah well I want
[1:44:48] to wear something different
[1:44:51] at Style just doesn't quite fit
[1:44:54] me in fact why do I even need a garment
[1:44:57] provid I'm just going to wear my own
[1:44:59] thing
[1:45:00] anyway and really they're saying my Rags
[1:45:02] are just fine he said who on Earth would
[1:45:05] say a thing like that that's insane I
[1:45:08] know because you're all
[1:45:11] believers Revelations 3:17 says because
[1:45:13] thou sayest I am rich and increased with
[1:45:17] goods and have need of nothing and no
[1:45:20] not that thou are wretched miserable
[1:45:23] poor and blind and naked no garment
[1:45:27] nothing I me it's a deceived age that we
[1:45:30] live in to the extent that their garment
[1:45:32] are so stained so tattered so wretched
[1:45:35] as the scripture says that it's
[1:45:37] nakedness to God and they don't even
[1:45:40] know
[1:45:40] it I thought you know what a
[1:45:44] mindset to believe that you're adorned
[1:45:47] and Fit For A King and to present
[1:45:49] yourself to to a King and knowingly Go a
[1:45:52] different way fully expecting as we just
[1:45:55] go into this Parable a little bit let
[1:45:57] just go down this way and then we'll go
[1:45:58] that way okay but this one went into the
[1:46:01] feast fully anticipating that all would
[1:46:04] go
[1:46:06] well that's that I can't expect that he
[1:46:09] went in there thinking that he was going
[1:46:10] to go to weeping and wailing and nashing
[1:46:12] of
[1:46:13] teeth I don't think anybody saying in
[1:46:16] the mind or thinking that they're saying
[1:46:17] would even do that but Mark says though
[1:46:19] that not everyone that saith unto me
[1:46:21] Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom but he
[1:46:23] that doeth the will of My Father which
[1:46:24] is in heaven and many will say unto me
[1:46:26] in that day Lord have we not prophesied
[1:46:29] in thy name and in thy name cast out
[1:46:31] devils and in thy name done many works
[1:46:33] and I will profess unto them I never
[1:46:35] knew you depart from me ye that work
[1:46:39] iniquity and so this one that went into
[1:46:41] this into the into the that Jesus is
[1:46:43] speaking of in the parable here he was a
[1:46:46] clear representation I would say of the
[1:46:48] make believer mentality because the
[1:46:50] unbeliever didn't even attend he didn't
[1:46:53] even show up to the feast he he called
[1:46:55] and he had other things to do and and
[1:46:57] the King went out and and dealt with
[1:46:58] them but the this one here he attended
[1:47:01] the feast but he had his own garment on
[1:47:04] he he had no intention of following the
[1:47:07] process here and so he he landed at the
[1:47:09] feast and it was going to basically make
[1:47:11] up his own his own way he knew there was
[1:47:14] a wedding Feast he had heard a call but
[1:47:17] he had his own
[1:47:18] thought and so here as a pre-wedding
[1:47:22] preparation this person could talk the
[1:47:25] talk he could fit in with the crowd
[1:47:28] because he knew there was a call but in
[1:47:31] his private life when no one was around
[1:47:34] there was his own idea and his own
[1:47:36] Concepts was very much abounding he knew
[1:47:39] that there was an invitation and maybe
[1:47:40] someone would say hey you going to the
[1:47:42] wedding you know the King has invited
[1:47:43] all of us yeah I'm going to the wedding
[1:47:46] do you have an invitation you know what
[1:47:47] I think I just left it at home and they
[1:47:50] they they could they could kind of talk
[1:47:51] and fit in a little bit into that
[1:47:54] conversation but when he got to the door
[1:47:57] or he didn't even get to presented to
[1:47:58] the door you can only you can only come
[1:48:00] in through the main door and so but you
[1:48:02] need to have your invitation because you
[1:48:04] got to go through the door you got to go
[1:48:05] through the right entrance yeah I know
[1:48:07] yeah know it's okay I'll make sure I
[1:48:09] have everything in order when I get
[1:48:10] there I mean it's not really urgent you
[1:48:11] know but in his mind he had no intention
[1:48:13] of going to the
[1:48:16] door everybody will be accepted I mean
[1:48:19] how can they deny me if I want to come
[1:48:21] in the way that I want to be because God
[1:48:22] loves
[1:48:24] everybody
[1:48:27] right there's a
[1:48:29] way there's a
[1:48:36] way my pages are
[1:48:40] uh make sure got them in order
[1:48:43] here I wonder what a bold spirit that
[1:48:46] would be to approach the king and his
[1:48:49] feast with my own idea and my own way my
[1:48:53] own clothing Concepts and the spirits
[1:48:56] today are so bold they're in your face
[1:48:58] they're rebellious they're they're
[1:49:00] they're they're pressing their idea in
[1:49:02] front of you what they what they think
[1:49:04] how they feel about it whe in whichever
[1:49:06] way whichever Sodom aspect of this world
[1:49:09] that we're dealing with it's a bold
[1:49:11] spirit that is pressing against but so
[1:49:13] is this one so bold to walk into the
[1:49:17] presence of the king's court the way he
[1:49:19] designed
[1:49:21] that religious spirit is worse as we
[1:49:23] know So Many religious people to face
[1:49:26] their own their own thoughts on their
[1:49:27] spirituality and what they would would
[1:49:29] feel even the message said you know
[1:49:31] there's you could go down that road at
[1:49:33] which I won't spend too much time but
[1:49:34] his own idea is what was manifesting and
[1:49:38] I can imagine he thought you know well
[1:49:40] you know I'll come but it's going to be
[1:49:41] in such a way that the Royal purpose
[1:49:44] will not be served but maybe rather
[1:49:46] hindered he knows he's coming in in a
[1:49:50] totally different
[1:49:51] clothing not the way that was being that
[1:49:54] was required and so you know I'm not
[1:49:56] really going to share in the ceremony
[1:49:58] per I'll be present but uh you know and
[1:50:00] maybe I won't even show maybe a whole
[1:50:01] lot of care for the business at hand but
[1:50:04] uh I'll just kind of do what serves my
[1:50:05] own purpose and so the man came full
[1:50:08] really full desire or full exercise of
[1:50:10] his own self-will and his self-love he
[1:50:13] resolved to yield no respect but to
[1:50:16] assert his independent self
[1:50:19] sovereignty said wow that's a whole lot
[1:50:21] of
[1:50:23] information about a man that just didn't
[1:50:25] take didn't have the wedding garment but
[1:50:26] you got to realize he didn't just get
[1:50:28] there and suddenly poof oh I'm here and
[1:50:31] I don't have the right garment there was
[1:50:33] a process to get there he had the
[1:50:36] opportunity to get there the right way
[1:50:39] he had to consciously figure out and
[1:50:41] wrestle through and whichever to go in a
[1:50:44] different way through the back door or
[1:50:46] through the window some way he had to
[1:50:48] premeditate this is how I'm doing this
[1:50:53] this and he would show up the king even
[1:50:56] at his own table where the king's
[1:50:58] bounties were so largely
[1:50:59] dispensed that he was not afraid to
[1:51:02] affront
[1:51:03] him and basy stand as an affront saying
[1:51:07] I don't need your
[1:51:08] rope I don't need your garment this is
[1:51:11] just as good as it's going to
[1:51:14] get that garment was intended to show
[1:51:17] that the wearer was a real participator
[1:51:20] in the joy of the feast we're a body all
[1:51:24] robed in spotless white and here there
[1:51:26] that wedding garment brother brandham
[1:51:28] said oh listen to this it's the wedding
[1:51:30] garment is the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:32] Spirit how are we going to be
[1:51:34] represented any other way if the first
[1:51:36] church had to come by the door Christ
[1:51:38] Jesus be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:51:40] Christ receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:42] Ghost to put on the wedding garment how
[1:51:45] are we coming any other way impossible
[1:51:49] to come in he said if you come by
[1:51:50] Methodist or Baptist or Pentecostal any
[1:51:52] denomination you'll be bound and cast to
[1:51:54] Darkness he said you got to come by
[1:51:56] Christ Jesus the way the door the truth
[1:52:00] the life amen amen we can Echo an amen
[1:52:03] with brother brandham say absolutely the
[1:52:05] truth amen but this one here was not
[1:52:08] acknowledging that he didn't acknowledge
[1:52:10] the king nor the prince nor Karen Adam
[1:52:11] about the G gladsome event and they had
[1:52:13] no objection to be there and to eat and
[1:52:15] recline and see the pomp in the show but
[1:52:18] reject the desire that the King
[1:52:20] had I could say he was only in it but
[1:52:24] not of
[1:52:25] it right in the world and not of it but
[1:52:28] he was the bit of the Reversed he was
[1:52:30] there in the in the area but he was not
[1:52:32] of it he was not of the the wedding
[1:52:35] Feast he was in body but not in spirit
[1:52:38] right how many sit in church in body but
[1:52:41] not in spirit we need to be in and of I
[1:52:44] should say
[1:52:48] Amen you know I can't even fathom if I
[1:52:51] was sitting if I I'm going to try and
[1:52:54] get into his mind and this fellow or
[1:52:57] whoever is is the scripture is standing
[1:52:59] there and all around him are everybody
[1:53:02] in a wedding garment and he's the odd
[1:53:05] man
[1:53:05] out you'd think okay wait a second ah I
[1:53:10] need to deal with this you know you'd
[1:53:12] think he wouldn't want to or everybody
[1:53:14] around him say hey um you don't got a
[1:53:17] garment on and that's a problem so the
[1:53:20] king isn't here yet so you want to make
[1:53:22] a dash out there you want to go I don't
[1:53:24] know what way you got in here because
[1:53:25] surely you should have taken a garment
[1:53:27] at the gate when you came through Christ
[1:53:29] when you came through the baptism of the
[1:53:30] Holy Ghost and he robed you in Pure
[1:53:32] White you should have came in here
[1:53:33] looking like I am but somehow you got
[1:53:35] here differently so maybe go that way
[1:53:37] you came in go around and come back
[1:53:40] through the door do that and then you'll
[1:53:42] look just like us and you'll be right a
[1:53:44] part of the body of Christ you got to
[1:53:46] come the
[1:53:48] way said well you know there was some
[1:53:53] premeditated intent to just stay there
[1:53:56] oh and as a songwriter pinned down oh
[1:53:58] sinner what's your needless delay amen
[1:54:02] why you hesitate why do you hesitate get
[1:54:04] back come in the right way and a call to
[1:54:08] be robed in Christ he
[1:54:12] rejected rejected the call and he at
[1:54:16] some point the call would go out the cry
[1:54:19] and says the bride room it's
[1:54:22] coming he's
[1:54:24] arriving and oh my everybody stands to
[1:54:27] attention oh the king is here the feast
[1:54:30] is the beginning this is incredible and
[1:54:32] everybody's at straight attention and
[1:54:34] there's one there that is sticking out
[1:54:36] like a sore
[1:54:38] thumb and
[1:54:40] here right
[1:54:43] there the king spots
[1:54:46] him you don't think Christ can't see who
[1:54:49] needs needs attention immediately in
[1:54:52] even this little meeting here as the
[1:54:55] king can walk through and his eye can
[1:54:58] spot you need attention you don't have
[1:55:02] the Rob on that you need my call went
[1:55:06] out he
[1:55:08] said
[1:55:11] friend if you go into that word actually
[1:55:14] that word friend doesn't mean my buddy
[1:55:18] my beloved
[1:55:21] you're you're you're so close to me that
[1:55:22] actually that word friend it means a
[1:55:24] selfish acquaintance one who seeks his
[1:55:27] own interest above the interest of
[1:55:28] others it's not it's not attached with
[1:55:31] filio and in fact the other there's a
[1:55:33] few times in Scripture that that word
[1:55:35] friend is used in the New Testament and
[1:55:38] the other one is when Jesus called Judas
[1:55:40] friend there was no filio connection
[1:55:44] there was no tight connection to this
[1:55:45] one CU he had had if I could say he'
[1:55:48] lost his opport opportunity the call had
[1:55:51] gone forth and the the the the the the
[1:55:54] process had been given which way to come
[1:55:56] through the door through Christ to get
[1:55:58] your garment to to be robed and he had
[1:56:00] bypassed and bypassed and bypassed and
[1:56:02] maybe some had in had said you know this
[1:56:04] is the way to go this is you need to get
[1:56:06] to Christ the end is coming the message
[1:56:08] has been given to this hour this is the
[1:56:11] pro a prophet has come and someone's
[1:56:12] been bidden bidden but then there came a
[1:56:14] point at this in the parable where there
[1:56:18] was no more time
[1:56:21] and the King said
[1:56:23] friend where's your
[1:56:28] garment you know I could say
[1:56:33] Tonight Rapture hasn't
[1:56:36] happened and I may be asked the same
[1:56:39] question do you have the right
[1:56:43] garment and this man scripture said was
[1:56:48] speechless what do you
[1:56:50] say well wait I I believe uh I'm I'm I'm
[1:56:55] a Pentecostal or you know better I'm
[1:56:57] read quote well wait a minute I'm a
[1:56:59] presbyterian I'm a Methodist or I'm a
[1:57:00] Pentecostal but BR says that had nothing
[1:57:02] to do with it he said well I believe
[1:57:04] brother br's a prophet I went to a
[1:57:07] messes Church in fact my home I had Holy
[1:57:10] Ghost
[1:57:12] parents but you don't have the robe on
[1:57:15] yes well my parents had the robe on but
[1:57:19] you don't have the
[1:57:24] robot better around says he didn't come
[1:57:26] by the door and he failed to get a robe
[1:57:29] Jesus said I am the door to the
[1:57:30] Sheepfold and if you come you can't come
[1:57:32] by the Methodist Church you're a thief
[1:57:34] and a robber he says you got to come by
[1:57:36] Jesus Christ the only way you can ever
[1:57:39] come to him is to come by Jesus and when
[1:57:42] you pass through him he throws his love
[1:57:44] a robe around you leads you to the fold
[1:57:46] that we're living on the Hallelujah side
[1:57:48] he said come and by the
[1:57:51] door why would anyone show up with the
[1:57:54] knowledge that weeping and wailing is
[1:57:56] the end never I can't believe anybody
[1:57:59] would ever do that to come by man's own
[1:58:02] way but brother B said God has a way
[1:58:04] provided that way is Jesus he says your
[1:58:06] life would compare if you had Christ and
[1:58:09] the new birth you're born again your
[1:58:10] life would compare with those in the
[1:58:12] Bible the apostles who are robed in his
[1:58:14] righteousness the thing of it is he says
[1:58:16] they come in some other way besides the
[1:58:18] door they're robed with some kind of a
[1:58:20] spirit they have the same kind of life
[1:58:21] or they or they'd have the same kind of
[1:58:23] life if they did they'd be the same
[1:58:25] people as in scripture amen he said but
[1:58:28] like Paul said in the way that's called
[1:58:30] heresy so worship I God of our fathers
[1:58:33] oh because he'd been robed in the same
[1:58:35] righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:37] your life would manifest the same power
[1:58:40] the same fruits the same gospel would
[1:58:42] flow through you amen he said so many
[1:58:44] people trying to get in but they're not
[1:58:46] taking God's provided entrance he said
[1:58:49] oh and if they go any other way when the
[1:58:51] apostles come to Christ when the early
[1:58:52] church came they received the baptism it
[1:58:55] made them a different
[1:58:57] people it made them a different people
[1:59:00] it made them act different it made them
[1:59:02] live different their whole life was
[1:59:04] motivated different they had different
[1:59:07] motives they had different objectives
[1:59:09] everything but Braham said was different
[1:59:12] when they came to Christ amen that's how
[1:59:14] you know you're a different people
[1:59:17] you're a peculiar people amen it should
[1:59:19] be a warning Bell in your little brain
[1:59:21] if there's some real tight similarities
[1:59:24] between you and the
[1:59:26] world right if you're like well you're
[1:59:30] kind of saddling up a little close to
[1:59:31] some of the desires or the different
[1:59:33] Trends and Fashions and it's like that's
[1:59:35] hard to see the difference here you're
[1:59:36] kind of similar I wonder we should be
[1:59:42] different some little bell should be
[1:59:44] going off on your mind because as pul
[1:59:46] hit in the way that's called heresy
[1:59:48] they're saying that's just wrong but it
[1:59:49] was the way that God desired it was the
[1:59:52] way that the Holy Spirit would would be
[1:59:54] presented through Paul and the world
[1:59:56] would say it's
[1:59:57] heresy well he should be saying that to
[1:59:59] you and
[2:00:00] I but in the way they call heresy so
[2:00:03] worshiped by God of our fathers amen
[2:00:08] what's your ambition the world's views
[2:00:10] your views how close are they oh about
[2:00:13] the Fashions and the world's ideas on
[2:00:15] that end how close are they I'd say
[2:00:17] let's get a little bit you could go say
[2:00:19] well brother Michael you can preach a
[2:00:20] little deeper no sir let's get down a
[2:00:22] little business we say we want our life
[2:00:24] to be different I want my life to align
[2:00:27] with the word of God not any bit close
[2:00:29] to the
[2:00:31] world cuz I need to have a garment
[2:00:34] that's
[2:00:35] accepted
[2:00:39] inside I'd say there's still
[2:00:41] time the door still open and the robe of
[2:00:45] his spirit is still here to fall upon
[2:00:48] you
[2:00:51] I'm going to take the I'm going to take
[2:00:53] now another
[2:00:56] road there's a call and a robe that you
[2:01:01] must wear I was just to set that portion
[2:01:04] of the service up I have no idea what
[2:01:05] time I started so my apologies but uh
[2:01:09] we'll just uh see where we go here there
[2:01:12] was a little girl one day this is for
[2:01:15] little ones maybe and big ones
[2:01:18] alike
[2:01:21] and she was a lovely little
[2:01:23] lady and she had a lot of
[2:01:26] difficulty she worked
[2:01:29] hard her mother
[2:01:31] died her father
[2:01:33] remarried to another woman that had two
[2:01:35] daughters so she had a couple step
[2:01:38] sisters and she was a really scorned
[2:01:41] little thing and you'd say she would
[2:01:43] maybe work I should say worked more like
[2:01:45] a maybe a little bit of a servant girl
[2:01:49] and she labored and they put her to work
[2:01:51] and she had to basically do their every
[2:01:54] wh and way and you know she would she
[2:01:56] went through these trials I could say in
[2:01:58] tribulations and she grew into just a
[2:02:00] beautiful young lady she had a lot of
[2:02:02] character because hardship brings that
[2:02:05] fiery trials and tribulations can bring
[2:02:08] build character and so she would learn
[2:02:10] to turn the other cheek and how to love
[2:02:13] her enemy you know and she was just a
[2:02:14] humble Meek little contrite thing and as
[2:02:17] she did her duties and she would you
[2:02:19] know she would get all dirty and filthy
[2:02:21] as she labored in the kitchen and such
[2:02:23] these you know the stove and the sit
[2:02:26] around that and they would end up
[2:02:27] calling her she'd all look smudgy and
[2:02:29] all that sit on her and she would be
[2:02:31] working and they would end up calling
[2:02:33] her
[2:02:34] Cinderella you know the
[2:02:38] story it's an old old old tale really
[2:02:42] old tale but one day an invitation went
[2:02:46] out to come to a banquet
[2:02:49] and oh she wanted to go real
[2:02:52] bad she had asked you know could I
[2:02:56] really go to this banquet that the
[2:02:57] prince is the king is putting on for the
[2:02:59] prince she wanted to go so bad to this
[2:03:02] but the response was never it ain't
[2:03:05] going to happen who would ever ever want
[2:03:07] a little dirty little thing like you at
[2:03:10] the at this banquet you got too many
[2:03:12] things to do you got all your chorice to
[2:03:14] do and slave away and do this you ain't
[2:03:15] coming for nothing look at you in filthy
[2:03:17] rags anyway
[2:03:20] oh but she just wanted to go oh and so
[2:03:23] it was just something in her heart that
[2:03:24] was yearning to be at this little
[2:03:26] banquet and her step sisters prepared
[2:03:28] and they pred and they pampered
[2:03:30] themselves in all these different ideas
[2:03:32] of what they thought they should wear
[2:03:34] and they had their own stepsister
[2:03:36] religion of what their covering should
[2:03:38] be and so they put their own design
[2:03:41] together and they had their ideas this
[2:03:43] is exactly what the prince is going to
[2:03:44] want this is what he's going to look at
[2:03:46] I'm going to wear my thought this way
[2:03:48] I'm going to wear this certain dress and
[2:03:50] I can imagine if we just kind of jump a
[2:03:52] little bit that I'd say well what what
[2:03:55] they were Desiring to Adorn themselves
[2:03:56] in was their idea of what the prince
[2:03:59] wanted their idea of what the prince
[2:04:02] wanted and I wonder how many people have
[2:04:05] their own concoction of what they're
[2:04:07] dressing themselves in of what they
[2:04:09] think he desires you know and if we said
[2:04:13] well at this right this moment right now
[2:04:15] if you were adorned in where you're at
[2:04:17] what would you be dressed in
[2:04:19] some people might be dressed in a
[2:04:21] complex of complexes that they're not
[2:04:23] able to and that that just so surrounds
[2:04:26] their world their life they're adorned
[2:04:28] in it it consumes them or maybe somebody
[2:04:30] is just a straight up hobby that that is
[2:04:33] they they eat sleep and breathe it
[2:04:34] because that's what that's what you are
[2:04:36] everything you are that that's what
[2:04:38] you're presenting yourself some people
[2:04:39] are just they work they're Workaholics
[2:04:41] they they desire the fame and the riches
[2:04:43] and the glory that's what their robe is
[2:04:46] if I could put it that way amen their
[2:04:48] robed in their profession or they're
[2:04:50] robed in their education or maybe maybe
[2:04:52] there's a hurt or a bruise or or
[2:04:55] something deep in their life and it just
[2:04:57] consumes their everyday life it's what
[2:04:59] they've robed themselves
[2:05:04] in and these step sisters with hotty shy
[2:05:07] never really wondering or even
[2:05:09] researching you know what the prince
[2:05:11] desired does anyone even know what
[2:05:13] catches his eye did anybody even do that
[2:05:15] what what does he what does he like what
[2:05:17] is his favorite color I don't know but
[2:05:19] my favorite color is yellow so that's
[2:05:20] what I'm wearing I don't really care
[2:05:21] what he
[2:05:22] thinks that's about how some people
[2:05:25] believe I don't know what what what what
[2:05:28] what what does God mean here I don't
[2:05:29] know this is what I think it means here
[2:05:31] we don't think there's an answer for
[2:05:32] that you know it says in Malachi 4 that
[2:05:35] there Elijah would come before the great
[2:05:37] and Dreadful day what's well I think
[2:05:39] that there's no more prophets anymore
[2:05:41] what you robing yourself in is your own
[2:05:47] color and so they put put themselves and
[2:05:49] they put their dress together and they
[2:05:51] left to the banquet with their own
[2:05:53] adornments and
[2:05:55] their pretty dress that they thought but
[2:05:59] reality was those pretty dresses were
[2:06:03] really just filthy
[2:06:04] rags because a prince had no desire
[2:06:07] about them anyway because if you fast
[2:06:08] forward that little story he didn't care
[2:06:10] to cents about them what they look like
[2:06:13] his eye wasn't on them it didn't catch
[2:06:15] his
[2:06:16] attention and there at back at their
[2:06:20] home they did indeed leave one that was
[2:06:23] in rags her own
[2:06:26] unrighteousness crying but there was
[2:06:28] such a desire my heart yearns to be
[2:06:32] there and she had all the grace the love
[2:06:34] the humility and the respect you know
[2:06:36] she had this Inner Strength she carried
[2:06:37] herself like a queen but she was needing
[2:06:41] a garment that she could be presented
[2:06:46] in she needed a blood token
[2:06:49] that surround would surround a little
[2:06:51] bride her character was exactly what the
[2:06:55] prince was looking for through trials
[2:06:57] and through testing but she needed she
[2:06:59] needed to be made holy and made perfect
[2:07:02] by a robe amen so brother Bram says God
[2:07:05] usually puts us in the shop and trims us
[2:07:08] up you know he didn't alter his robe to
[2:07:10] fit Elisha he ordered Elisha to fit the
[2:07:13] robe amen that's what he does today he
[2:07:16] Alters us to fit the robe so he go
[2:07:18] through trials we go through difficulty
[2:07:20] you go through some tribulation but he's
[2:07:22] just altering you a little bit he's
[2:07:24] getting you ready to fit a rope because
[2:07:27] he's got a ro for you that it's going to
[2:07:29] be perfect match that you are going to
[2:07:31] be doned and adorned in his
[2:07:33] righteousness amen but he's got to get
[2:07:35] you so you can fit it amen I don't want
[2:07:38] to be all sloppily dressed you say this
[2:07:41] thing's way too big he's going to have
[2:07:43] to work you down a little
[2:07:45] bit he said that's what he does today he
[2:07:47] Alters us to fit the robe not the robe
[2:07:49] to fit us sometimes we want to make the
[2:07:52] robe fit us right let's just go back to
[2:07:55] the story oh they had a little slipper
[2:07:57] That was supposed to it's going to fit
[2:07:59] me and they try to cram their foot into
[2:08:00] a little slipper It Don't Fit you it
[2:08:02] isn't made for you it's made for a
[2:08:05] certain little lady that's been custom
[2:08:07] made for the Prince of
[2:08:11] Peace he said he's got to bring
[2:08:14] us you've got to let yourself to be all
[2:08:18] altered for the robe it's God's robe and
[2:08:20] he's made it perfect he's got to bring
[2:08:23] us into that realm to make us fit the
[2:08:25] robe he says we can't be perfect ourself
[2:08:28] we know we can't there's no way for us
[2:08:30] to be and yet he said for us to be so
[2:08:33] but what did he do he made a
[2:08:34] propitiation for us I can't be perfect I
[2:08:37] know but I got exactly what you need
[2:08:40] amen as we heard last night brother
[2:08:42] Murphy was kind of stomping all over
[2:08:43] there a little bit but the God has a
[2:08:45] mind brother Murphy and so we'll just
[2:08:47] keep going down this line he said
[2:08:48] there's where Perfection comes of
[2:08:50] ignoring our own Holiness of which we
[2:08:52] have none of our own thoughts which we
[2:08:54] ought not to be but we rest solemnly
[2:08:57] upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus
[2:08:59] God sent him to the Earth and it was in
[2:09:01] him that we rest amen and so her cry
[2:09:05] does your heart cry of course the seed
[2:09:08] will cry oh God I need to be adorned I
[2:09:12] want to go to this Feast I heard a call
[2:09:15] I Heard a Voice that called to me and
[2:09:17] I'm responding I'm not
[2:09:22] robed so she's crying her deepest
[2:09:24] calling her deepest yearning there must
[2:09:27] be a deep to respond as we know and he
[2:09:29] said there's there's just no way in the
[2:09:31] States you are you have even have a
[2:09:32] chance to present yourself I I can't
[2:09:34] look this way I'm Unholy I'm unrighteous
[2:09:37] and then one
[2:09:38] came if you go into the little
[2:09:41] story someone came from a different
[2:09:44] dimension to put a garment on her that
[2:09:48] would be custom fit that was going to
[2:09:51] get the attention of the
[2:09:54] prince is that what happened and so she
[2:09:57] started to create a gown that was going
[2:10:00] to catch the eye she goes I know exactly
[2:10:03] what he's looking for so I'm going to
[2:10:05] Adorn you that way so that you are no
[2:10:08] one else there's no other person it
[2:10:09] might as well be an empty room it's just
[2:10:12] you and him there could been thousands
[2:10:16] of other ladies but when you're adorned
[2:10:18] in what the Prince of Peace is Desiring
[2:10:20] Nothing Else Matters to him but you and
[2:10:24] him and so he rose she robed her to we
[2:10:27] the only one that he would see and I
[2:10:29] could say if I end there we've had an
[2:10:31] eleazer coming this day to robe us so
[2:10:35] that we are the only one he wants to
[2:10:37] even look at he's going to clothe you
[2:10:39] and I amen that's what this message is
[2:10:42] is to clothe you you say well I don't
[2:10:45] know what the message was you better
[2:10:47] need that you need the message
[2:10:48] cuz it is the adorning of his word to
[2:10:51] get you ready to present you to a
[2:10:56] King there an angel a messenger From
[2:11:00] Another Dimension stepped into this
[2:11:03] realm Amen to bring the design and the
[2:11:06] layout of exactly what he wants his his
[2:11:10] Queen to wear the exact color the exact
[2:11:14] fashion he knew what he wanted and so in
[2:11:19] 1947 the threads of this garment started
[2:11:24] to be
[2:11:25] weaved amen someone from another
[2:11:28] dimension came to this Dimension to
[2:11:31] issue out the exact pattern amen anybody
[2:11:34] looked at a fabric pattern I tell you I
[2:11:36] look at it be like I wouldn't even know
[2:11:38] how to read that because it takes
[2:11:40] someone special that's anointed to be
[2:11:43] able to take the pattern to be able to
[2:11:44] receive from God and then issue out this
[2:11:47] is what he's
[2:11:50] Desiring and we had then we start to
[2:11:52] hear the very beginnings and it starts
[2:11:55] to weave and the the me the message
[2:11:57] starts to go forth and G and the faith

[2:19:06] where the token is required that makes
[2:19:08] get the whole unit for the Rapture water
[2:19:12] blood and Spirit come when a mother

[2:19:15] normal birth is water second blood and
[2:19:17] in life there come from the body of our
[2:19:19] Lord Jesus water blood and life and the
[2:19:22] whole church the bride together has been
[2:19:24] made to justification sanctification and
[2:19:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[2:19:29] the
[2:19:31] token simple and the church in this day
[2:19:34] has received it of the
[2:19:37] baptism he
[2:19:40] says the blood has been shed the Holy
[2:19:42] Ghost is upon the church without us then

[2:20:10] appropriately that we are adorned and
[2:20:12] waiting and ready for this great Rapture
[2:20:15] he said there's no Rapture without a
[2:20:16] people that won't Adorn themselves in
[2:20:18] this
[2:20:23] message people who died in here are
[2:20:26] depending but a brand says and are
[2:20:28] waiting on us think of it they're
[2:20:32] waiting on
[2:20:34] you the church has got to come to
[2:20:36] perfection in order to bring
[2:20:37] Resurrection Souls Under The Altar and
[2:20:40] this church you see is coming smaller in
[2:20:42] the minority he said less and less are
[2:20:45] wanting to put on the the Garment that
[2:20:48] he's prepared can you

[2:21:25] day and even people that have been in
[2:21:28] this message have professed to believe
[2:21:30] it and they've just left it behind said
[2:21:32] no I don't believe it no more and
[2:21:34] they're essentially stripping themselves
[2:21:36] of the Garment that is going to bring
[2:21:38] them into a Rapture can you imagine as
[2:21:40] they stood before the king of judgment
[2:21:42] and say well you tore off the Garment

[2:25:05] real and neither do we want an
[2:25:07] artificial Christian will'll never raise
[2:25:09] in the resurrection genuine Believers
[2:25:12] Sons and Daughters of God that have
[2:25:14] received the call and responded to
[2:25:16] adoring
[2:25:18] themselves yes
[2:25:22] sir brother Murphy you know I had some
[2:25:26] when you started speaking about the
[2:25:29] scrubbing I've never heard a
[2:25:31] preacher you know even take that topic
[2:25:35] of a of a lady trying to scrub I I I I
[2:25:38] could find it in my notes I have wrote
[2:25:41] and I
[2:25:41] wrote U I'll go on a limb here when I
[2:25:44] was a kid we would uh we you know in
[2:25:47] school we did the lion witch in the
[2:25:48] wardrobe CS Lewis The Chronicles of
[2:25:50] Narnia it was a book thing anybody ever
[2:25:51] read that yeah okay you know if you read
[2:25:54] the whole thing there's a you know one
[2:25:55] of the characters turns into Dragon
[2:25:57] because he gets
[2:25:58] greedy right and he tries to carry clean
[2:26:01] himself and and remove the skin of of
[2:26:04] his of his torment and I had wrote that
[2:26:07] in my in my notes and you brother Murphy
[2:26:09] started to just scrape he says no how is
[2:26:14] this God is trying to tell you something
[2:26:18] that's how I receive that God's trying
[2:26:20] to tell you something you cannot remove
[2:26:21] the stain on your own it requires
[2:26:25] somebody from another dimension to come
[2:26:28] and start to scrape if you know the
[2:26:29] story it was a lion that came in and
[2:26:32] tore deep into that story I said it's
[2:26:34] the lion of Judah that has to tear deep
[2:26:36] into you to remove the
[2:26:39] stain but this garment that we've been
[2:26:42] given it's a cleansing robe I'm going
[2:26:47] Lord has a has a desire if you didn't
[2:26:49] hear it last night you go listen to it
[2:26:51] and you'll hear a little bit even now
[2:26:54] but maybe the Lord has sometimes he'll
[2:26:55] say things two times as a parent you
[2:26:57] ever said something to your kids once
[2:26:58] twice maybe three times four five 10 20
[2:27:01] times will you ever get
[2:27:04] it and then they do so sometimes when a
[2:27:07] preacher comes and you're like well I've
[2:27:09] heard that before but maybe it just
[2:27:10] hasn't quite sunk and so he brings
[2:27:12] another preacher and he brings another
[2:27:14] and another message and then maybe on
[2:27:15] the 20th time you're like yes I get
[2:27:19] it and so this
[2:27:21] garment is a cleansing robe it's more
[2:27:25] powerful than bleach it's almost if I
[2:27:27] could say like an invisibility cloak
[2:27:30] because it makes but revers because
[2:27:32] what's underneath it cannot be seen all
[2:27:35] you see is the robe amen and all that's
[2:27:37] under it is forever gone and I was
[2:27:39] thinking of Ruth the moabit a heathen
[2:27:43] considered wretched and unclean to
[2:27:45] Israel MO Mo was for is balam and such
[2:27:48] and Israel was justified in scorning and
[2:27:50] uring there was no connection with Moab
[2:27:54] no connection cursed nation and she had
[2:27:57] the stain of a heathen upon her you
[2:28:01] think she walked into Israel and they
[2:28:03] was just like oh oh no it was
[2:28:08] scorn
[2:28:10] ridicule
[2:28:11] mockeries because she had a stain of the
[2:28:15] moabites upon her a heathen and no
[2:28:18] matter what she did to try and be as
[2:28:19] inconspicuous as possible she could
[2:28:22] never get away from that and so she'd
[2:28:23] maybe glean somewhere but she couldn't
[2:28:25] escape that she was different the stain
[2:28:28] of her past was on her and she could not
[2:28:32] remove it she could not no matter how
[2:28:34] hard she tried could not remove the
[2:28:37] stain of who she
[2:28:38] was but I would say there was a redeemer
[2:28:41] in the story that could remove the stain
[2:28:44] and when she became part of him
[2:28:47] all things changed because she was no
[2:28:50] longer identified with Ruth the moabit
[2:28:53] but she's identified with Ruth who was
[2:28:55] Boaz his wife and her identity was in
[2:28:59] him it was he who covered her with his
[2:29:03] robe and adorned her and took her into
[2:29:06] his body he said no Ruth you're you're
[2:29:08] mine you're stain of who you are is no
[2:29:11] more you're now part of me you're your
[2:29:14] Boaz his wife not the
[2:29:18] moabit hallelujah how many in your past
[2:29:22] desired to remove stains blemishes of
[2:29:25] sins maybe you're smoking and drinking
[2:29:27] and you're lusting and all of that and
[2:29:29] you hated it but you couldn't remove
[2:29:33] it maybe some even currently hate
[2:29:35] something but on your own you cannot
[2:29:38] remove
[2:29:39] it and like brother Murphy said you try
[2:29:42] to rub it
[2:29:44] off what about your past
[2:29:47] David you
[2:29:49] think that you'd try to smear off in
[2:29:51] your own way but I think of those that
[2:29:54] in the past there was David David did
[2:29:57] not walk across into glory and adorned
[2:30:01] him he was wrapped in a robe and he was
[2:30:03] accepted on that day but then someone
[2:30:05] look at and say wait a second you got a
[2:30:08] spot right there what's that stain on
[2:30:11] your
[2:30:12] robe no oh that's the spot of murder
[2:30:17] no that's not how it was it's not when
[2:30:20] Abraham didn't receive he didn't receive
[2:30:22] a garment he was given it to him he like
[2:30:23] sorry uh my blood couldn't remove where
[2:30:26] you lied

[2:30:32] Samson sorry but you married a
[2:30:34] Philistine and you got all that issues
[2:30:36] with Delilah I just couldn't get it out
[2:30:38] of the robe you're just going to have to
[2:30:39] wear like that but but that's not going
[2:30:41] to be accepted it needs to be spotless
[2:30:44] and pure the bride needs to be Adorn in
[2:30:46] His Garment that that doesn't have any
[2:30:48] stain or spot or wrinkle I'm sorry
[2:30:52] that's not what he got that's not what
[2:30:54] Moses got when he got given a given a
[2:30:56] robe and it's like well you murdered a
[2:30:58] guy you know that's like pretty bad how
[2:31:00] do you think I got that out of there you

[2:31:05] the Harlot all the time Rahab the Harlot
[2:31:07] I mean your Deeds were terrible you know
[2:31:09] what you had to do and your way of
[2:31:11] living it it's filthy I can't get that
[2:31:13] out of that
[2:31:15] robe
[2:31:17] there's a
[2:31:18] stain on your character you know that's
[2:31:21] the hardest thing to remove you
[2:31:25] know
[2:31:29] nothing but my Jesus Hallelujah My
[2:31:33] Savior shed his blood at
[2:31:37] Calvary this robe that I wear is not of
[2:31:40] my own but it's a blood covering that
[2:31:43] raps me and whether it was murder
[2:31:46] whether it was Harlot Tre whether it was
[2:31:48] thieving and lying and lusting or
[2:31:50] whatever it could be you put your sin
[2:31:52] there I put my sin there I don't care
[2:31:54] what it was but when you get wrapped and
[2:31:56] adorned with this word and it adorns you
[2:32:00] all over when Jesus sees you and look at
[2:32:02] and gives you the robe you can look at
[2:32:04] say oh my goodness that's as white as
[2:32:06] snow although my sins be as Scarlet they
[2:32:10] are white as snow because I've been
[2:32:13] washed in the blood of the
[2:32:15] Lamb Hallelujah that's the robe you want
[2:32:18] to be dorned in that's the robe you want
[2:32:20] to be wrapped in you don't want to be a
[2:32:22] Moses or somebody that would that had
[2:32:24] that kind of thing no sir but there are
[2:32:26] some that do not have that covering and
[2:32:29] they will indeed come up and he will say
[2:32:31] I'm sorry but you didn't wrap yourself
[2:32:33] in the covering of my blood and
[2:32:35] therefore I I cannot but see the stains
[2:32:39] I cannot but see the Maring say oh but
[2:32:42] can't you cover me now I gave you an
[2:32:43] opportunity yes yes true
[2:32:49] I don't care what your stain is right
[2:32:50] now I don't care what your complex is
[2:32:53] right now I don't care how deep the hurt
[2:32:55] how hard the Forgiveness might be I
[2:32:58] don't care what it is this word this
[2:33:01] Jesus Christ can Adorn you and remove
[2:33:05] every
[2:33:07] stain you get identified in your boys in
[2:33:10] your Redeemer the bride is adorned in
[2:33:12] the token blood the scripture says
[2:33:14] verily verily I say unto you he that
[2:33:15] Hearth my word and Believe on him that
[2:33:17] sent me hath everlasting life and shall
[2:33:20] not come
[2:33:22] into condemnation but is passed from
[2:33:26] Death unto life Hallelujah wouldn't you
[2:33:29] want to be in that place that's where
[2:33:31] the call is going forth saying come up a
[2:33:33] little higher little bride Adorn
[2:33:35] yourself in my word because therefore
[2:33:38] there's no condemnation to them who are
[2:33:40] in Christ Jesus Oh may you walk out
[2:33:43] tonight oh maybe you're just walking a
[2:33:45] few feet off the ground in some air
[2:33:47] because you're like I am not condemned I
[2:33:50] am covered in the robe of Boaz amen
[2:33:53] Rahab right Rahab became not Rahab the
[2:33:57] Harlot as bad as her history could be
[2:34:00] but the moment Salon took her as wife
[2:34:04] she became part of him and no longer she
[2:34:07] got ejected injected into the lineage of
[2:34:13] Christ when you become part of this
[2:34:15] groom when he receives you into himself
[2:34:18] you get injected into the lineage of
[2:34:22] Jesus
[2:34:24] Christ that's the power of this Blood it
[2:34:27] can remove all pasts all stain all
[2:34:29] history and inject you into
[2:34:37] royalty what a barrier this blood
[2:34:41] is hallelujah that he might present to
[2:34:45] himself a glorious church not having a
[2:34:47] spot or a wrinkle or any such thing amen
[2:34:51] that it should be holy and without
[2:34:54] blemish that's my God I say come come
[2:34:59] unto me all you who are weary in heavy
[2:35:03] Adorn yourself in this garment if I
[2:35:06] could close I'm sorry I don't even know
[2:35:07] what time I would started I'll just
[2:35:09] close with
[2:35:10] this there's more to this garment if I
[2:35:12] could say it this way not diminishing at
[2:35:15] all but just add to the the
[2:35:17] characteristics of this great robe
[2:35:19] because the robe has more it has also
[2:35:23] the power of the blood but there's
[2:35:24] another there's power also in this great
[2:35:27] robe and the scripture says in in the in
[2:35:30] Kings Elisha wanting a double portion
[2:35:33] and he said Elijah said you have asked a
[2:35:35] hard thing he said if thou see me when
[2:35:38] I'm taken from
[2:35:40] thee it shall be so I wrote the first
[2:35:43] thing the first key is Elisha could not
[2:35:46] take his eye now off of
[2:35:49] Elijah Elijah asked a hard thing you've
[2:35:52] asked a hard thing to have a double
[2:35:54] portion of my spirit but if you see me
[2:35:58] then you'll have what you ask for so I'd
[2:36:00] say if you ask for a double portion of
[2:36:03] his blood and his covering and his
[2:36:05] Spirit to be infused in you as Jesus
[2:36:07] Christ Holy Spirit was sent out after
[2:36:10] the cross of Calvary you say I want that
[2:36:12] I say you better keep your eye on this
[2:36:15] message am what he sent you in this day
[2:36:17] because of Elisha wherever Elijah went
[2:36:20] now and he missing it how did he know
[2:36:23] Elijah's Gone elij Gone how do you know
[2:36:26] you got to keep your eye on this word
[2:36:28] you got to keep your eyes dead center
[2:36:30] wherever it moves whatever it says
[2:36:33] whatever this message says I ain't
[2:36:34] deviating because I want a double
[2:36:37] portion of his love amen is a songwriter
[2:36:39] pin
[2:36:41] down he says oh this garment wasn't just
[2:36:45] it's not not a form of godliness it
[2:36:48] wasn't that there's no power no no no no
[2:36:51] when Elisha got the mantle there was a
[2:36:54] power that came behind that mantle he
[2:36:56] didn't just wear it for good
[2:37:00] looks he said brother don't be afraid to
[2:37:03] ask God for
[2:37:06] anything second-handed robe was all
[2:37:09] right but AB BR said he needed a fresh
[2:37:11] call of God in his heart he needed a
[2:37:12] fresh anointing he wore a secondhand
[2:37:15] robe when came to the river but he
[2:37:16] needed a brand new firsthand call from
[2:37:18] God and a firsthand power from God he he
[2:37:21] said my brother don't be afraid to ask
[2:37:23] God anything now catch this brother
[2:37:26] brandham says You must demand God or ask
[2:37:29] God for anything he's promised for if
[2:37:31] I'm introducing a God that's omnipotent
[2:37:33] and all powerful and if I be a servant
[2:37:35] of God I must do the works of God and if
[2:37:38] I do the works of God you're ready for
[2:37:40] this not disrespecting but he says I
[2:37:43] must demand of God to bring these things
[2:37:45] to pass because he's demanding of me to
[2:37:48] produce the
[2:37:50] impossible
[2:37:51] [Music]
[2:37:53] all that's a Son of God that's standing
[2:37:56] exactly who he knows he is he knows
[2:37:58] where he stands and he's saying God is
[2:38:01] demanding of me to produce the
[2:38:03] impossible he says I have to ask him I
[2:38:06] have to call on him and stand there and
[2:38:09] say you
[2:38:12] promised hall hallelujah but it takes us
[2:38:15] son and daughter of God who are willing
[2:38:17] to step out in faith and say you're
[2:38:19] demanding of me to produce the
[2:38:21] impossible then oh God respectfully I'm
[2:38:23] demanding that you come on a seene and
[2:38:25] do the
[2:38:27] [Applause]
[2:38:28] impossible brother Bram says so you say
[2:38:31] well that's the prophet that's the
[2:38:32] messenger that's Malachi 4 he says then
[2:38:35] to you the bride that he's adorning he
[2:38:38] says to you so do
[2:38:41] you every person so now suddenly he's
[2:38:44] put that word in your mouth
[2:38:46] prophesy again
[2:38:49] Hallelujah you shall receive power and
[2:38:52] you after your robed is a your faith is
[2:38:54] set in Christ then you you shall receive
[2:38:56] power there you are yes and every
[2:38:58] brother sister this morning he says may
[2:39:01] I say this before going to prayer he
[2:39:02] says it's not Goliath that hindered me
[2:39:04] God slayed him before me but the thing
[2:39:06] that's hindered it's the lack of
[2:39:09] faith I said oh God May the faith Bank
[2:39:13] raise this night
[2:39:17] when Jesus stood on
[2:39:19] Earth healings and miracles are going
[2:39:21] abroad the disciples were following and
[2:39:24] there was a point there they tried to
[2:39:25] heal God gave him power to go and they
[2:39:28] couldn't and they could the epileptic
[2:39:30] boy couldn't be healed and said oh we we
[2:39:32] couldn't do it we couldn't he wasn't
[2:39:33] healed he prayed he wasn't he healed he
[2:39:35] said oh little faith and so there was a
[2:39:37] time then Jesus prayed delivered the
[2:39:41] disciples wow this is this is incredible
[2:39:45] and they seem blind then they seen lame
[2:39:48] then they seen the deaf he blind see and
[2:39:52] I'm sure their amazement started to
[2:39:54] increase then he walked then they walked
[2:39:57] on water Peter stepped out and you know
[2:40:00] all this little time maybe they had a
[2:40:01] little bit of doubt you know wow you
[2:40:04] know a blind one but oh no no he can do
[2:40:06] that you mean calm the sea and it's a
[2:40:08] raging Storm oh he can do that and their
[2:40:10] faith Bank I'm sure was raising a little
[2:40:12] bit to the point where it must have come
[2:40:13] to Lazarus and they're like well I mean
[2:40:15] he can heal but what are we doing here
[2:40:19] this is the dead that stinketh all so
[2:40:22] long and after four days but then they
[2:40:24] stood there and they watched in Wonder
[2:40:26] and amazement as the Son of God Christ
[2:40:29] himself stood there cried out with a
[2:40:31] loud voice Lazarus come forth and they
[2:40:34] saw the dead man come walking out of the
[2:40:36] Tomb at that moment I'd have to say that
[2:40:38] the disciples would have to said all
[2:40:40] right there's
[2:40:42] nothing there's nothing he cannot do
[2:40:46] throw it at him devil but he's God and I
[2:40:49] believe
[2:40:51] wholeheartedly H I'd say as a body of
[2:40:55] Christ we've seen a whole lot of what
[2:40:57] our God can do that's right you start
[2:40:59] going by I don't even have the time I
[2:41:01] could go through this aisle and say what
[2:41:02] have you seen God do what have you seen
[2:41:04] God do you've seen the miracles happen
[2:41:06] you've seen the death here you've seen
[2:41:07] the lame walk You' you've seen God move
[2:41:09] Cancer's Cancer's completely annihilated
[2:41:12] do you've seen it I'd say we've come to
[2:41:14] a place bride of Jesus Christ that we've
[2:41:16] got to come and we are here now where we
[2:41:19] can say there's nothing my God cannot
[2:41:28] do because Leviticus says he shall take
[2:41:31] blood of the Bullock sprinkl it with his
[2:41:32] finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and
[2:41:34] before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle
[2:41:36] the blood with his finger seven times
[2:41:38] but AB Bram says oh isn't that beautiful
[2:41:40] seven times towards the east what is it
[2:41:42] the seven Church ages shall be covered
[2:41:45] by the blood blood Jesus Christ blood
[2:41:47] just as sufficient in it yesterday today
[2:41:49] and forever in every age to save every
[2:41:52] sinner to heal every sick person bring
[2:41:54] every miracle and every sign to pass
[2:41:56] seven times way back in the Old
[2:41:58] Testament 1490 years before Christ come
[2:42:02] think of it a symbol seven times so does
[2:42:06] it prove today in this age in this day
[2:42:09] that he can still raise the
[2:42:13] dead you say Well that's pretty bold
[2:42:15] words brother the Michael he can raise a
[2:42:18] dead and if there's a dead person here I
[2:42:20] believe with all my heart he raise him
[2:42:21] right up out of the Grave Just as he did
[2:42:23] Lazarus but there might be a dead
[2:42:24] spiritual person and I'd have to say if
[2:42:27] you could put on a scale that's
[2:42:31] worse but my God can raise the dead you
[2:42:35] know how I know that because you're
[2:42:37] sitting here excuse me you're sitting
[2:42:40] here dead in sins and trespasses but God
[2:42:44] through his rich Mercy has raised you up
[2:42:48] and adorned you with a bride with a robe
[2:42:50] that's how I know he can raise the
[2:42:53] dead you say some here are pretty pretty
[2:42:56] desperate cases like Lazarus yep yep but
[2:42:58] you're here so uh boo
[2:43:04] devil it's been done it's been
[2:43:10] done we have our brother back home
[2:43:12] brother yonas was had cancer they told
[2:43:15] him for one he had cancer and so that
[2:43:18] was a death sentence in itself and for
[2:43:20] two the remot chance that you're going
[2:43:22] to somehow survive from that you can't
[2:43:24] even have kids and such and he was just
[2:43:26] getting he was engaged at believeing
[2:43:28] about Dem married or in close to that
[2:43:30] but you know what he does not have
[2:43:32] cancer and he does have a
[2:43:36] baby is that the
[2:43:39] truth that's the
[2:43:41] truth we've seen too many I we don't
[2:43:44] have time but surely like the Disciples
[2:43:45] of old we don't doubt the power of
[2:43:48] almighty God because the Holy Spirit has
[2:43:50] robed this bride and is not lacking in
[2:43:52] power so then what I say is take the
[2:43:54] robe that Elisha has received take the
[2:43:57] holy spirit that you have received and
[2:43:59] walk to
[2:44:01] Jordan and strike it right you have not
[2:44:05] just been given a robe to look beautiful
[2:44:07] you've been given a robe to defeat the
[2:44:09] enemy you've been given a robe to
[2:44:11] Rapture out of
[2:44:13] hereen Amen
[2:44:16] he said brother Braham said it's time to
[2:44:17] take this holy spirit that we're
[2:44:19] Anointed with and say where is the god
[2:44:21] that was Upon Jesus
[2:44:23] Christ you say well that's pretty bold
[2:44:26] that's your Prophet yes I'm just quoting
[2:44:28] him you say it yeah where's the god of
[2:44:31] Jesus Christ where's the god of Abraham
[2:44:33] Isaac and Jacob where's the God that was
[2:44:35] on our lord Jesus the blessings he said
[2:44:37] and in this great crisis here that
[2:44:39] someone had to turn back to Elijah was
[2:44:41] gone he was the one that had poured the
[2:44:42] water in his hands that had double
[2:44:44] portion so this sick and sin for world
[2:44:45] goodday could look at a real Church of
[2:44:47] the Living God who possess a double
[2:44:49] portion of his holy spirit we can we
[2:44:52] what can we do in this
[2:44:55] time what can we do in this time if
[2:44:58] someone has the boldness to say I've
[2:45:00] been
[2:45:01] adorned and he's demanding me to do the
[2:45:07] impossible what's the impossible to
[2:45:10] me you might have something on your
[2:45:12] heart that's
[2:45:13] impossible God's
[2:45:16] you with a robe that is
[2:45:19] accepted and gives you
[2:45:22] power if you just
[2:45:26] believe musicians why don't you
[2:45:33] come Elisha asked for a double
[2:45:38] portion and I was thinking Elisha we
[2:45:40] know types the
[2:45:42] bride we you go back to eight miracles
[2:45:45] Elijah 16 Miracles Elisha double portion
[2:45:48] I know preachers have preached on that
[2:45:49] as
[2:45:52] such I was thinking about the double
[2:45:54] portion if you go deep that that last I
[2:45:56] believe the
[2:45:57] 16th miracle was the dry bones if I'm
[2:46:00] correct on the dry bones when the or the
[2:46:03] body was thrown onto the bones and they
[2:46:05] were Elisha's bones and he raised
[2:46:08] up so it took some time for that to come
[2:46:11] to
[2:46:14] fulfillment
[2:46:16] but those power and those bones still
[2:46:18] held still had the Bones still held the
[2:46:20] power to bring that prophecy to pass no
[2:46:22] matter how long they sat there but at
[2:46:24] the Jordan I was thinking that this
[2:46:25] bride is coming to indeed if you look at
[2:46:28] that last miracle the last one was a
[2:46:30] resurrection you say there's the double
[2:46:31] portion and we're here as a bride to
[2:46:33] receive a rapturing double portion and
[2:46:36] that's that's where we are and you can
[2:46:37] run run the tip but I was just thinking
[2:46:39] you know that double portion has even
[2:46:41] maybe an extra little air to that
[2:46:43] because at this day and age there's not
[2:46:45] just Resurrection that's needed for dead
[2:46:47] bones but there's a double portion in
[2:46:49] that power and anointing in this bride
[2:46:51] because there's living bones there's a
[2:46:53] bride that's staying here that's living
[2:46:55] and breathing and we need an extra
[2:46:57] portion so that we are also resurrected
[2:47:01] it's the dead bones and it's the living
[2:47:03] bones that will be resurrected by this
[2:47:05] double portion of this anointing so
[2:47:08] that's uran I portion of this garment
[2:47:10] say Lord I'm not here to die and go into

[2:58:30] amazing he said you know there's a that
[2:58:34] man had that
[2:58:36] attitude in that wedding supper he he
[2:58:39] was
[2:58:41] self-independent his own agenda his own
[2:58:46] design sat right in the midst of
[2:58:51] everybody but never
[2:58:54] surrendered never gave in to the way it
[2:58:56] was spoken just the way the messenger

[2:59:03] walked away from
[2:59:06] it you know
[2:59:09] and he didn't want to be
[2:59:12] clothed and he told us how that that
[2:59:15] garment was that
[2:59:17] token you say well what's that what's
[2:59:19] the token that's the biggest question
[2:59:21] that we get what is the baptism of the
[2:59:23] holy
[2:59:24] spirit it's when the one from the other
[2:59:27] dimension Hallelujah comes down and
[2:59:30] changes your
[2:59:34] nature and changes the desires of your
[2:59:41] heart can you be religious without the

[2:59:46] us so beautiful
[2:59:47] [Music]
[2:59:49] tonight that you can fake everybody out
[2:59:53] around
[2:59:56] you but what a time to be honest with
[3:00:02] yourself what a what a what a wonderful
[3:00:06] time right now
[3:00:10] to ask yourself if you want to
[3:00:15] rededicate your
[3:00:17] [Music]
[3:00:22] life to look deep inside
[3:00:27] and and to know what it's like maybe get
[3:00:30] Place St or
[3:00:33] something and I think that I wouldn't
[3:00:36] want to take it to this place
[3:00:41] without giving us the opportunity Unity
[3:00:45] to wait a
[3:00:47] moment you know I like that
[3:00:49] song stay because it says do you know
[3:00:53] what it's
[3:00:55] [Music]
[3:00:57] like you know it's like to be so
[3:01:03] lost so far away from God that there's
[3:01:06] no
[3:01:08] hope and then just to look up to him and
[3:01:14] scream from your heart God help me God
[3:01:16] help me I don't know what I
[3:01:19] am but I'm not
[3:01:24] this and then to have him come
[3:01:28] down pick you up in his hands and say
[3:01:32] it's
[3:01:34] okay that's why I
[3:01:39] died and I I thought it was so beautiful

[3:02:01] can't there's nothing in
[3:02:04] you to do
[3:02:06] [Music]
[3:02:08] it it's got to come from someplace
[3:02:11] else Hallelujah
[3:02:14] it's got to come from another realm
[3:02:16] another
[3:02:17] dimension thank you Jesus and I think
[3:02:20] that's so beautiful he demands you to be
[3:02:25] perfect and you
[3:02:26] [Music]
[3:02:30] can so he just says that you got to look
[3:02:34] back up to him and say Lord I can't
[3:02:36] you're demanding me to do it so I'm
[3:02:39] going to demand you to change me

[3:02:54] removed it takes
[3:02:58] you dedicating
[3:03:01] yourself to
[3:03:03] him and then God takes those people that
[3:03:06] he's changed and he molds them together
[3:03:10] fit and joined and he becomes a
[3:03:12] beautiful bride
[3:03:16] do you want to be a part of
[3:03:19] that I mean I'm I'm talking from the
[3:03:22] bottom of your heart Lord I don't want
[3:03:24] to miss what our brother was preaching
[3:03:27] about a message that's come to dress us
[3:03:31] and Adorn us for a Rapture and a wedding
[3:03:36] supper and I have not been involved in

[3:13:33] yesterday today and
[3:13:36] forever that we take our stand now and

[3:14:09] hand and that he would take my Roe
[3:14:14] filthy as they
[3:14:15] [Music]
[3:14:18] are and he would tailor me a new garment
[3:14:22] a new nature a new life a new heart that
[3:14:27] he'd take my heart a stone and he'd make
[3:14:30] it like
[3:14:31] flesh that I could become a new
[3:14:35] creature in Christ
[3:14:37] Jesus and I want to just take a moment
