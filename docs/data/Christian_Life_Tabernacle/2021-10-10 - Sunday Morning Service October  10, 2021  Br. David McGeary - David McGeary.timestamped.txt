[21:45] god bless you man as you invite brother
[21:46] mike for our song reading this morning
[21:48] amen
[22:09] all the others are out at the meeting
[22:12] you know if
[22:15] you've been paying attention to the news
[22:16] at all there's
[22:19] kind of been a tragic story playing out
[22:22] about a couple
[22:23] that
[22:24] went on a vacation
[22:27] and only one of them came back
[22:30] and of course many days later they found
[22:34] her body and
[22:35] he has of course disappeared
[22:39] and it struck me as i was reading
[22:41] the news reports about how
[22:44] there's this great manhunt underway
[22:48] they're pouring
[22:49] thousands
[22:50] of dollars and
[22:53] men and women and resources and
[22:55] equipment and
[22:57] you know they're they're using every
[22:59] resource at the disposal
[23:01] weeks and days and
[23:03] nights
[23:05] all looking for
[23:07] one man
[23:09] and you think about all the effort being
[23:10] put into seeking
[23:13] this one
[23:15] you know what i was thinking about that
[23:17] i was thinking about that word to seek
[23:20] something
[23:22] you know webster defines it this way
[23:24] it's to search for something or to try
[23:26] to find something
[23:28] the thing about seeking
[23:30] is first of all
[23:32] you have to know what you're looking for
[23:35] you can't just go seeking for something
[23:38] and not really have anything in mind
[23:40] other than you know maybe a few
[23:42] misguided young people that are out
[23:44] looking for themselves
[23:46] and i promise they won't like what they
[23:47] find when they find it you have to have
[23:50] something in mind you have to have
[23:52] something that you're focusing on when
[23:53] you're searching
[23:55] but the other thing about seeking is it
[23:56] takes work
[23:58] it takes effort
[24:00] it takes investment and it takes
[24:02] desire you know i'm sure we've all had
[24:04] that those of us that have children
[24:06] who've had that experience where we send
[24:07] them to the refrigerator to find
[24:08] something
[24:10] and they open the door and they stare
[24:11] blankly at the inside for a minute or
[24:13] two and like it's not there
[24:15] that's not seeking
[24:17] moving things aside and digging because
[24:19] you know it's there and you're going to
[24:20] find it right
[24:22] but there's effort involved in that
[24:26] you know some people spend their entire
[24:28] lives
[24:29] their entire careers their last dollar
[24:32] seeking something whether it's a
[24:34] scientific achievement
[24:35] whether it's a pinnacle of their career
[24:38] a position a title
[24:40] whatever the case may be an object
[24:42] could be that dream car that dream home
[24:44] but they spend their entire lives
[24:46] seeking that thing
[24:49] you know jesus told several parables
[24:51] about this
[24:52] about this seeking
[24:54] in luke 15 he spoke of the shepherd who
[24:56] has lost a sheep
[24:58] and leaves the 99 behind and goes off
[25:01] into the mountains
[25:02] spending who knows how long
[25:04] to find that one it took effort it took
[25:07] work it took focus it took desire
[25:11] then of course there's the story of the
[25:12] woman that lost the coin in her house
[25:15] turned over everything in her home
[25:17] sweeping the floors clean took hours of
[25:19] work
[25:20] to find
[25:22] that which he was looking for
[25:24] seeking
[25:26] and when we read psalm 70 this morning
[25:28] if you want to turn to that
[25:31] you know david describes
[25:34] two searches going on
[25:38] there's two things that are being sought
[25:40] two seeking campaigns two manhunts if
[25:42] you will
[25:44] and the first is in verse two it says
[25:46] let them be ashamed and confounded that
[25:49] seek after my soul
[25:53] let them be turned backward and put to
[25:55] confusion that desire might hurt
[25:57] you know as we mentioned several weeks
[25:59] ago there's no time in the psalms where
[26:01] david is asking for deliverance from
[26:02] someone that's coming after his body
[26:05] or coming after his health
[26:07] or coming after his comfort
[26:09] or his safety it's always about coming
[26:11] after his soul
[26:13] but it's interesting the word that's
[26:15] used here is
[26:16] seeking
[26:18] his soul
[26:20] you know it occurred to me that there
[26:21] was someone that had his soul as their
[26:24] specific target
[26:26] and if we look at that example of
[26:28] seeking turning over every stone
[26:30] using every tool at their disposal
[26:33] working tirelessly day and night to try
[26:36] to get his soul
[26:39] and that's a sobering thought
[26:42] you know that's still the case today
[26:45] there is one who is using every tool in
[26:47] the book
[26:48] surrounding us with
[26:50] everything in his arsenal day and night
[26:52] without rest
[26:54] seeking after our soul
[26:57] you know it says in first peter 5 8 be
[26:59] sober
[27:00] be vigilant
[27:02] because your adversary
[27:04] as a roaring lion
[27:07] walketh about seeking who may maybe
[27:09] may devour
[27:12] you know all everything around us in
[27:13] this troubled world all those
[27:14] distractions all those voices
[27:17] those influences part of that arsenal of
[27:19] someone coming to seek after
[27:22] our soul
[27:24] but you know then in verse 4 there's
[27:26] another search
[27:28] underway another seeking that's being
[27:30] described it says this let all those
[27:32] that seek thee
[27:34] rejoice
[27:36] and be glad in thee
[27:38] you know once again just as in the other
[27:40] example seeking takes a couple of things
[27:43] you need to know what you're looking for
[27:44] you need to have a specific target and
[27:46] it takes work it takes effort it takes
[27:49] commitment
[27:51] it takes focus
[27:53] it says in deuteronomy 4 29 but if from
[27:56] thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god
[27:58] thou shalt find him
[28:00] if thou seek him with all your heart and
[28:05] all your soul
[28:08] so that's interesting
[28:09] it says in jeremiah 29 13 and ye shall
[28:12] seek me and find me when ye shall search
[28:15] for me with all
[28:17] your heart
[28:19] this is no casual look in the word
[28:23] to satisfy your curiosity or to
[28:26] you know solidify your
[28:28] belief system or to
[28:31] you know just to
[28:33] fulfill your religious obligation this
[28:35] is a full-time commitment
[28:37] this is absolute
[28:39] 100 percent commitment in the search
[28:43] or you won't find it
[28:45] right two searches going on both
[28:47] requiring 100 percent commitment it says
[28:50] in matthew 13 again the kingdom of
[28:52] heaven is like unto treasure hidden a
[28:54] field
[28:55] the which when a man hath found he
[28:57] hideth
[28:58] and for joy thereof goeth and selleth
[29:00] all that he hath
[29:03] and buyeth that field
[29:05] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[29:07] a merchant man seeking goodly pearls
[29:09] when he had found one pearl of great
[29:11] price
[29:13] went and sold
[29:14] all that he had
[29:16] and bought it
[29:18] total commitment
[29:20] total investment
[29:22] you know and it
[29:23] struck me
[29:24] psalm 70 has a little note at the front
[29:26] it says it's a psalm of remembrance
[29:29] you know and i thought that that was
[29:30] really a sobering reminder
[29:32] to remember that there are two great
[29:34] searches going on and both
[29:36] require 100 commitment of your soul
[29:40] the first is one who is using every tool
[29:42] in his arsenal
[29:44] to try to find and devour your soul and
[29:47] the reminder to be sober
[29:49] to be vigilant can't be half-hearted
[29:51] about this in this laodicea age of
[29:53] partial commitment
[29:55] the stakes are full commitment
[29:58] but the other is a search
[30:00] for him
[30:01] pouring our full heart and our soul and
[30:04] our commitment to seek his
[30:06] face jesus said in john 6 44 no man can
[30:10] come to me except the father
[30:12] who sent me draw him
[30:15] do you realize how precious it is
[30:18] to even desire to see
[30:21] when you rub your shoulders with all the
[30:23] people in the world how many of them
[30:24] aren't even giving it a second thought
[30:28] yeah maybe they believe in god maybe
[30:30] they talk about religious things but
[30:31] there's no desire there
[30:33] no hunger to go seeking
[30:36] and here's a cry to seek him with all of
[30:39] our heart
[30:40] i thought it was a good reminder as we
[30:42] read that this morning
[30:44] it says in isaiah 55 6 seek ye the lord
[30:47] while he may be found
[30:49] call ye upon him while he is near
[30:52] i thought as we read this this morning
[30:54] it's just a small small chapter
[30:56] to remember
[30:58] the great
[30:59] offer we have
[31:01] to put our whole heart and soul into
[31:03] seeking his face
[31:05] let's read that together psalm 70
[31:08] just five verses says make haste o god
[31:11] to deliver me
[31:13] make haste to help me o lord
[31:15] let them be ashamed and confounded that
[31:18] seek after my soul let them be turned
[31:20] backward and put to confusion that
[31:22] desire might hurt
[31:24] let them be turned back for a reward of
[31:27] their shame that say aha aha
[31:30] let all those that seek thee rejoice and
[31:32] be glad in thee and let such as love thy
[31:35] salvation say continually let god be
[31:38] magnified but i am poor and needy make
[31:42] haste unto me o god thou art my help and
[31:45] my deliverer o lord make no tarrying
[31:49] amen
[31:52] [Music]
[31:55] god bless you i have your seats
[32:10] [Music]
[32:16] [Music]
[32:17] [Applause]

[53:40] and
[53:41] just going to have a little uh
[53:44] short service this morning
[53:47] so let's turn in our scriptures over to
[53:49] matthew i mean to mark
[53:52] excuse me
[53:54] that
[53:55] 11th chapter of mark
[53:58] and
[53:58] we're going to read 12 13 and 14
[54:02] and then drop down and pick up
[54:05] 20.
[54:16] and uh
[54:18] the the portion of scripture
[54:21] that
[54:22] we've are skipping is when jesus goes
[54:27] into the temple
[54:28] and he routes
[54:30] the unbelievers
[54:33] out
[54:34] who don't have the right motive and
[54:35] objective
[54:37] but it's here in the 11th chapter it
[54:39] says
[54:41] and on the morrow
[54:44] they went and come from bethany he was
[54:47] hungry
[54:48] and seeing a fig tree afar off having
[54:51] leaves he came
[54:54] if happily he might
[54:56] find anything thereon
[55:00] and when he
[55:01] came to it he found nothing but leaves
[55:05] for
[55:06] the time of figs was not yet
[55:09] and jesus answered and said unto it no
[55:13] man eat fruit of the
[55:16] hereafter forever
[55:18] and his disciples heard it
[55:21] and then on the 20th first
[55:23] and in the morning as they passed by
[55:26] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[55:30] roots
[55:32] and peter called to remembrance
[55:36] and saith unto him master behold the fig
[55:39] tree which thou
[55:41] cursed it is withered away
[55:44] and jesus answering said unto them have
[55:48] faith
[55:49] in god
[55:52] for verily i send you
[55:55] that whosoever shall say unto this
[55:58] mountain
[55:59] be thou moved and be thou cast
[56:04] into the sea
[56:06] and shall not doubt it in his heart
[56:09] he shall believe that those things which
[56:14] he saith shall come to pass
[56:17] he shall
[56:18] have whatsoever he saith
[56:22] therefore i say unto you
[56:25] what things
[56:27] soever ye desire
[56:29] when ye pray
[56:31] believe that ye receive them
[56:34] and ye shall have them
[56:37] and when you stand praying forgive
[56:42] if you have ought against any
[56:45] that your father also which is in heaven
[56:49] may forgive you of your trespasses
[56:54] but if ye do not forgive neither will
[56:58] your father which is in heaven forgive
[57:01] your trespasses may the lord add his
[57:04] blessings to his word you may be seated
[57:12] you know many uh
[57:15] different scholars
[57:18] in studying
[57:20] the story of the fig tree
[57:22] and we know that the fig tree
[57:25] represented israel and
[57:28] and
[57:29] putting forth its bloom and
[57:31] and so many scholars feel that when he
[57:34] cursed the fig tree it was a
[57:37] representation
[57:38] that the israel the fruit of that that
[57:42] law
[57:43] and the things were coming to an end but
[57:46] i like to drop down to the conclusion of
[57:48] the matter
[57:49] when he said have faith
[57:51] in god
[57:52] and we just wanted a fellowship just for
[57:55] a little a bit
[57:58] this morning
[57:59] about faith
[58:03] you know we're we're living in a time
[58:07] now
[58:08] and every believer
[58:11] knows that
[58:13] the world
[58:14] is changing rapidly
[58:17] and that
[58:18] the
[58:20] the world has chosen
[58:23] not to put its trust
[58:25] in god
[58:26] they're laying their trust in science
[58:29] uh
[58:30] we've heard over and over and over again
[58:34] uh we're trusting the science we're
[58:36] believing in the science the science the
[58:39] science the science now could you just
[58:42] imagine if we had somebody that said
[58:45] let's all of our nation go to prayer
[58:49] let's ask god to come down and spare us
[58:53] from this mistake
[58:56] that we made
[58:57] and
[58:59] god was never brought into the picture
[59:03] in fact we closed churches and we
[59:06] limited the number of people that could
[59:09] come
[59:10] and we see that our
[59:14] within our country in different places
[59:16] of the world there's great political
[59:19] turmoil now
[59:21] of there's a great divide in our country
[59:24] between capitalism and socialism and
[59:28] and and i i'm not here to preach either
[59:32] of those because i believe god has a
[59:35] kingdom
[59:37] and that's what our hearts desire is
[59:40] it's to be in the kingdom of god
[59:44] so we know that man is ruling and
[59:47] governing themselves and they have a
[59:51] right to do that
[59:52] i don't think it's the wisest thing to
[59:55] do
[59:56] is to rule without god i think that it's
[1:00:00] very important and i think it's
[1:00:03] beneficial that we have the creator of
[1:00:07] all things involved in our life
[1:00:10] we know the story of the man that was
[1:00:12] working in the garage and he was there
[1:00:15] working on the carburetor of an
[1:00:18] automobile and that he was just
[1:00:20] struggling so much to get that to run
[1:00:23] and he was struggling and a gentleman
[1:00:26] stepped up to him and and asked him he
[1:00:29] said uh may i help you
[1:00:32] and the guy looked over and his hands
[1:00:34] were covered with grease you know the
[1:00:36] mechanic and he'd been doing this for
[1:00:38] years and he looked at the fell and the
[1:00:41] fella was there in a slacks and a nice
[1:00:43] shirt and everything he thought
[1:00:46] okay
[1:00:48] you know give it a shot
[1:00:50] you know what i mean many a times i've
[1:00:52] suggested
[1:00:54] you know to somebody that's doing
[1:00:56] something you know you'd say well why
[1:00:58] don't you try this and the first thing
[1:01:00] they do is you do it
[1:01:02] you know what i mean they hand you the
[1:01:04] tool you want to tell me how to do it
[1:01:06] you think you can do it better you do it
[1:01:08] here's the wrench here's the tools you
[1:01:10] know and uh
[1:01:12] you know and but this man was very very
[1:01:15] gentlemanly and he just said may i help
[1:01:17] you
[1:01:18] and so he got in there and he just did a
[1:01:21] few little things and
[1:01:23] the car was accomplished and the man
[1:01:26] stood back and he said who are you
[1:01:29] he said well i'm the chief engineer for
[1:01:32] ford motor company
[1:01:34] and i
[1:01:35] designed this carburetor
[1:01:38] and so why would you not have a god in
[1:01:42] your life
[1:01:44] that
[1:01:44] designed life
[1:01:47] he designed life
[1:01:49] you know he even designed our days
[1:01:53] did you know the footsteps of the
[1:01:55] righteous are ordered by the lord
[1:01:58] he
[1:01:59] he he
[1:02:00] wants to be in the affairs of man and
[1:02:04] govern the affairs of man it's when man
[1:02:07] turns away his leadership that my man
[1:02:11] finds himself
[1:02:12] in trouble so we realize we're kind of
[1:02:15] in an age now in
[1:02:18] where things are changing rapidly uh
[1:02:21] technology is changing rapidly
[1:02:25] they were talking uh
[1:02:27] here on the other day i was listening on
[1:02:29] the radio and they said that bill gates
[1:02:32] used to be the richest man in the world
[1:02:36] because of he developed this
[1:02:39] technology i think was it microsoft or
[1:02:42] whatever that he does in the phones and
[1:02:45] and all these things but he was
[1:02:48] surpassed by
[1:02:50] another gentleman named
[1:02:52] bozo jeff bozo and
[1:02:55] and he uh
[1:02:57] he
[1:02:58] i guess he's a developer
[1:03:00] and i said it correct
[1:03:02] he might not pronounce it that way
[1:03:04] but that's exactly
[1:03:07] what it is and and he uh
[1:03:09] and he's developed this uh uh
[1:03:12] thing now that everybody can shop at
[1:03:15] home
[1:03:16] you know
[1:03:17] and uh my porch is loaded with stuff
[1:03:20] all the time you know and
[1:03:23] and uh so that and now he was the
[1:03:26] richest man in the world
[1:03:28] but now they have a new richest
[1:03:32] man in the world and uh i believe his
[1:03:35] name is ed at something musk and
[1:03:38] and uh he's now the richest man in the
[1:03:40] world but i take uh i disagree with them
[1:03:45] i'm the richest man in the world
[1:03:48] because he testified the other day that
[1:03:52] he wants to die on mars
[1:03:56] but i don't ever want to die
[1:04:00] i thought what a goal
[1:04:02] in life
[1:04:04] to die on mars
[1:04:07] what are you living for to die on mars
[1:04:11] to be the first man
[1:04:13] buried on mars
[1:04:15] i want to go past mars
[1:04:18] don't you i mean that i don't want to
[1:04:20] die on mars i want to wave mars goodbye
[1:04:25] i i i
[1:04:26] don't want to die why and i don't have
[1:04:28] to die because i can live forever the
[1:04:32] smartest people in the world are those
[1:04:35] who have eternal life
[1:04:38] that's the smartest people in the world
[1:04:40] they have eternal life
[1:04:43] amen and again and so you know like i
[1:04:46] say why live
[1:04:48] uh why live to die
[1:04:51] when you can live to live
[1:04:55] you know
[1:04:57] i think his goal of leaving this world
[1:05:00] is is a great goal
[1:05:02] i want to leave this world i don't want
[1:05:05] to learn how to stay here i want to
[1:05:07] learn how to leave here
[1:05:09] and i want the
[1:05:11] rapture to become a reality to me
[1:05:15] i i i want the eternal life to become a
[1:05:19] reality to me you just to know that
[1:05:23] there is life after this death to have
[1:05:26] it come so much into my heart and be
[1:05:29] such a reality to me that that i i when
[1:05:33] this flesh takes his last breath
[1:05:36] that i totally understand beyond a
[1:05:39] shadow of a doubt i will still be
[1:05:42] conscious and aware of my existence
[1:05:48] it's just the people on the outside
[1:05:51] can't see where i am but i've stepped
[1:05:54] into what is invisible to us
[1:05:59] in in the carnal realm but there
[1:06:02] actually there's life there there's
[1:06:05] eternal life and and we have the promise
[1:06:08] that when this body here is is decayed
[1:06:12] and gone that we have one
[1:06:15] waiting for us that that one that puts
[1:06:17] on incorruption
[1:06:20] and and so i just don't want to read it
[1:06:23] from a uh
[1:06:25] a
[1:06:27] biblical if i could say that
[1:06:29] intellectual standpoint i i don't want
[1:06:33] to
[1:06:35] just
[1:06:35] have it there
[1:06:37] as a
[1:06:39] a hope so
[1:06:41] you know what i mean or as something
[1:06:43] that
[1:06:44] i feel that
[1:06:47] someday
[1:06:48] i'll find out
[1:06:50] if it's true or not
[1:06:53] i'd like to have it answered now
[1:06:57] and
[1:06:58] the hour that we're in
[1:07:02] and what it is that
[1:07:06] we're facing
[1:07:08] we're being faced
[1:07:10] more and more and more
[1:07:13] with
[1:07:14] the need
[1:07:16] in our lives
[1:07:18] to understand that there is life
[1:07:21] after this life
[1:07:23] because this life is becoming very
[1:07:26] discouraging to us
[1:07:29] i mean just think if you could be the
[1:07:31] richest person in the world one day and
[1:07:33] in just no time flat you're not
[1:07:37] right
[1:07:38] you know
[1:07:39] uh
[1:07:42] then
[1:07:44] any earthly accomplishment
[1:07:46] ends
[1:07:48] with death
[1:07:52] so
[1:07:53] i i like i'm saying so i think it really
[1:07:56] behooves us but so what we
[1:07:58] what i'm trying to
[1:08:00] point to
[1:08:02] is that
[1:08:05] in the hour
[1:08:07] that we're living now
[1:08:11] it's going to take faith
[1:08:15] faith is the most important thing
[1:08:19] to the believer now
[1:08:22] faith will allow us to navigate
[1:08:26] no matter how dark
[1:08:28] it becomes
[1:08:31] and we know that in hebrews is a
[1:08:34] scripture that we're all very familiar
[1:08:36] with hebrews 11
[1:08:38] and 1
[1:08:40] it says faith is the substance
[1:08:43] of things hoped for
[1:08:45] the evidence of things
[1:08:48] not seen
[1:08:50] so if
[1:08:53] faith can give us an evidence
[1:08:57] and it's a substance
[1:09:00] something that's real
[1:09:02] and
[1:09:03] my hope
[1:09:05] is
[1:09:06] the kingdom of god
[1:09:09] that's what my hope is our our hope
[1:09:12] should be the kingdom of god
[1:09:15] no matter what blessings god has given
[1:09:18] us
[1:09:19] by the fruits of our education
[1:09:22] which is fine
[1:09:24] by the pathways that we've chosen in
[1:09:27] life
[1:09:28] to
[1:09:29] do what we do
[1:09:30] for a living we know that all those
[1:09:33] things are just things that are abiding
[1:09:37] time it's what we do in tell
[1:09:41] there's no great eyes and no big eyes in
[1:09:45] little you
[1:09:46] a
[1:09:47] a person that uh
[1:09:49] uh as uh
[1:09:51] what we call a sanitary engineer
[1:09:54] for example you know because someone
[1:09:57] that go drives down up and down the
[1:09:59] streets and and picks up the art garbage
[1:10:02] and and okay and hauls it to the dump
[1:10:05] forest that's a very important part of
[1:10:08] life that that because
[1:10:10] that's not a lower
[1:10:12] uh uh a job
[1:10:15] especially if that person's got the joy
[1:10:17] of the lord in their heart and they're
[1:10:20] singing praises to god and they know
[1:10:23] that this is what they're doing until
[1:10:28] again you may have we have all kinds of
[1:10:31] different talents here some in computers
[1:10:33] some in construction
[1:10:35] uh some in medical all all different uh
[1:10:39] uh types of jobs and things that we do
[1:10:43] and none of them have any greater reward
[1:10:47] than any other if you're just abiding
[1:10:50] time
[1:10:52] if you're just waiting for that great
[1:10:55] hope
[1:10:56] because uh the you know
[1:10:59] god didn't come to the rich in this
[1:11:02] world
[1:11:04] he came to the poor of this world rich
[1:11:08] in faith
[1:11:09] and so that's where our treasure wants
[1:11:12] to be it's harder the scripture says for
[1:11:16] a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[1:11:19] god than it is for a
[1:11:22] camel to go through the eye of the
[1:11:25] needle and you know the eye of the
[1:11:27] needle was the small gate that sat by
[1:11:31] the great
[1:11:32] double gates that when they closed the
[1:11:35] city up at night then they could guard a
[1:11:37] very narrow passage that could go
[1:11:40] through and so he said it's harder for a
[1:11:43] rich man because we have a tendency to
[1:11:46] put our trusts in our accomplishments
[1:11:50] we put our trust in the things that we
[1:11:53] have we look at our bank account and we
[1:11:56] feel secure because we have
[1:12:00] so much money there but a man of faith
[1:12:03] that believes god has more money in his
[1:12:06] account than
[1:12:08] pictures of dead presidents
[1:12:13] because with faith he can do all things
[1:12:18] you know i mean he has all things
[1:12:21] in fact the scripture says i've never
[1:12:23] seen the righteous big bread
[1:12:26] okay and
[1:12:28] the richest of the world always have a
[1:12:31] tendency to move us to the place where
[1:12:35] we begin to trust in our accomplishments
[1:12:38] we trust in our education we trust in
[1:12:41] the things that that uh that we can
[1:12:44] feel feel and that we can touch and then
[1:12:48] we weigh their value
[1:12:52] you know i uh
[1:12:55] i don't have i would say
[1:12:58] someone asked me would i like a paper
[1:13:00] copy
[1:13:02] yeah i like paper copies i don't know
[1:13:04] why
[1:13:06] because i i didn't grow up where you
[1:13:08] just put something in a cloud somewhere
[1:13:11] in hopes it comes back
[1:13:13] to me that's like flying a kite
[1:13:17] you know i hope it comes back you know
[1:13:19] and
[1:13:20] and and i don't have confidence in that
[1:13:24] but we we want to
[1:13:26] we don't want to have confidence in
[1:13:29] things that are forever changing
[1:13:35] do you understand what i'm trying to say
[1:13:37] from my perspective something becomes
[1:13:40] totally obsolete
[1:13:43] you know i have a computer at home i
[1:13:45] don't know what's wrong with the thing
[1:13:47] it wants to update every other day
[1:13:51] just leave me alone
[1:13:55] you know what i mean i don't need no
[1:13:57] updates
[1:14:00] you know
[1:14:02] i i don't i you know i uh
[1:14:05] you know leslie always has to ask tell
[1:14:07] me every day have you checked your
[1:14:09] messages have you checked your text have
[1:14:11] you checked your email
[1:14:15] you know i
[1:14:16] i said no nobody's called me
[1:14:20] you know i haven't heard from anybody
[1:14:22] everything's fine no you've got to check
[1:14:24] these things
[1:14:25] that's what people do
[1:14:27] and
[1:14:28] and so
[1:14:29] we
[1:14:30] we why would we put
[1:14:33] our trust in something that's going to
[1:14:36] change so rapidly
[1:14:41] because what happens is you your whole
[1:14:44] life is trying to keep up
[1:14:47] now can you imagine living your whole
[1:14:49] life trying to keep up
[1:14:51] trying to keep up with the joneses
[1:14:54] trying to keep up with a guy that wants
[1:14:56] to die on mars
[1:14:58] i don't want to keep up with that
[1:15:01] i want to keep up with the one that's
[1:15:04] got the information that's going to give
[1:15:06] me eternal life
[1:15:08] that's who i want to keep up with i want
[1:15:11] to keep up with the updates that are
[1:15:14] coming from the word of god because
[1:15:17] that's where i want to put my trust
[1:15:19] that's where i want to put my my faith
[1:15:22] that where i i want to come to the place
[1:15:26] that this is what i live for this is
[1:15:28] what i believe in this is what's going
[1:15:31] to take me i i now have an awareness
[1:15:35] about me and a consciousness about me
[1:15:38] and a reality about me that this world
[1:15:42] is going to perish
[1:15:44] don't let it deceive you don't let it
[1:15:47] fake you out if i can say this the
[1:15:50] reason they keep going and keep changing
[1:15:53] and keep doing everything is because
[1:15:55] they haven't found it yet
[1:16:00] but when you've come to and meant him it
[1:16:03] makes a difference
[1:16:05] so this is why what we're talking about
[1:16:07] today is that what we need
[1:16:10] more than ever
[1:16:12] is faith
[1:16:16] faith is the tool
[1:16:20] that accomplishes everything for the
[1:16:24] believer
[1:16:26] for with god nothing is impossible
[1:16:31] i believe that's luke 1
[1:16:33] uh 37 for with god all things are
[1:16:37] possible faith is
[1:16:39] it is with the for in second corinthians
[1:16:43] 5 and 7 says
[1:16:45] for we walk
[1:16:47] by faith
[1:16:49] not by sight
[1:16:51] and matthew 21 22 all things whatsoever
[1:16:56] ye shall ask
[1:16:57] in prayer
[1:16:59] believing you shall have believing so
[1:17:03] faith
[1:17:04] becomes the tool
[1:17:08] if i could say that by which we are
[1:17:11] going to have to live by
[1:17:14] in order to pursue
[1:17:16] the reality that we want to live in
[1:17:20] you don't want to live in the world
[1:17:23] you don't want to be following
[1:17:25] everything that's going on the world
[1:17:28] like i said you want to bring peace to
[1:17:30] your heart turn off fox news
[1:17:34] turn off
[1:17:36] nsnbc turn off cen
[1:17:39] my goodness they changed their story
[1:17:42] over and over and over again i i sat in
[1:17:45] a little uh i sat in the restaurant the
[1:17:48] other day with leslie and and that that
[1:17:51] little shooting that took place in
[1:17:53] arlington come up and all i saw on the
[1:17:56] news over and over again and the one
[1:17:59] hour was this they kept showing the
[1:18:01] picture of the swat team
[1:18:04] running up to the school it was so
[1:18:06] sensationalized
[1:18:10] and they created such panic
[1:18:14] you know wasn't the reality of it
[1:18:18] the boy didn't mean to kill anybody they
[1:18:20] shouldn't have had a gun he shot some
[1:18:22] people and he went home got an attorney
[1:18:25] and turned himself into the police
[1:18:27] oh they didn't report that for hours and
[1:18:30] hours and hours later just shooting
[1:18:34] shooting shooting shooting shooting
[1:18:39] okay
[1:18:40] the world's falling apart
[1:18:43] what are you going to do about it you
[1:18:45] better find some place to put your trust
[1:18:51] because if the watchman watches the city
[1:18:55] if god doesn't watch the city the
[1:18:57] watchmen watches in vain
[1:18:59] so there's got to be something that we
[1:19:02] as believers can live by in a world that
[1:19:07] we can't trust anymore
[1:19:13] a lot of people trusted their jobs
[1:19:16] and one day they shut their jobs down
[1:19:21] okay now that we we visited with a lady
[1:19:23] at the restaurant she said i've worked
[1:19:25] here so many years she said so far so
[1:19:28] good but if they make me get a vaccine
[1:19:30] i'm not going to be here anymore
[1:19:34] that's how she feels
[1:19:37] she's afraid of it
[1:19:41] and she has a right to me
[1:19:45] the only reason i took the vaccine
[1:19:47] because i had a promise that if i take
[1:19:49] up a deadly thing it shouldn't harm me
[1:19:53] i i felt i was in a position that i
[1:19:56] didn't i couldn't set a precedent for
[1:19:58] you and say don't get it it's that's not
[1:20:01] my place
[1:20:03] but my place is to put our trust in the
[1:20:06] word of god
[1:20:07] so faith
[1:20:09] now becomes very
[1:20:11] extremely
[1:20:13] important
[1:20:15] to those who want to live in the kingdom
[1:20:19] of god
[1:20:20] because you can only live in god's
[1:20:23] kingdom by faith
[1:20:27] faith is what makes his kingdom work
[1:20:33] you can't try to live here
[1:20:36] pretending you're living in the kingdom
[1:20:38] of god and don't believe it
[1:20:44] don't believe it can't take care of you
[1:20:47] don't believe it can't provide for you
[1:20:50] whatever you pray for and you act that
[1:20:52] you can have if you can't believe that
[1:20:55] it can't take care of you
[1:20:58] that if you seek it first
[1:21:01] all things will be added to you
[1:21:04] you can't live
[1:21:06] and serve two masters
[1:21:09] it comes to a time and the time is
[1:21:13] approaching us
[1:21:14] and being forced on us very rapidly that
[1:21:18] we're going to have to choose who's
[1:21:20] going to lead us
[1:21:24] who am i going to believe
[1:21:28] that's the great they
[1:21:32] would someone please tell me who they is
[1:21:35] i'll tell you who that is
[1:21:37] they is lucifer in the 200 000 demon
[1:21:41] demons that were poured out on the earth
[1:21:44] to to test the bride that's who they is
[1:21:51] you see one of these great movie stars
[1:21:54] they're anointed with one of those
[1:21:56] demons that we're let loose that are
[1:21:59] influencing our young people
[1:22:03] you see all this these things going out
[1:22:06] there all this sin and people and
[1:22:09] murders and all this stuff those that's
[1:22:11] those demons
[1:22:13] that are manifesting themselves in flesh
[1:22:16] the 200 000 demon demons that were
[1:22:19] poured out on the world
[1:22:24] we better start
[1:22:25] losing confidence
[1:22:30] because every word of man is a lie
[1:22:34] and every word of god is true
[1:22:39] so
[1:22:40] there there comes a time that we've got
[1:22:43] to step out of the in between
[1:22:50] we've got to step out of trying to
[1:22:52] filter what's going on in the world our
[1:22:56] personal desires our personal goals in
[1:22:59] life and the goal of the kingdom of
[1:23:04] god i preached i thought what brother
[1:23:07] mike said fit so well
[1:23:09] in the morning service
[1:23:11] seek ye first
[1:23:14] the kingdom of god
[1:23:18] don't try to
[1:23:19] join it together and mix it you know
[1:23:22] what what do you get when you mix hot
[1:23:24] water and cold water
[1:23:28] so he said don't be lukewarm
[1:23:33] don't mix it
[1:23:35] don't be afraid
[1:23:39] to put yourselves
[1:23:43] in the hands of the living
[1:23:46] god amen
[1:23:51] don't be afraid of that
[1:23:54] now our question is he told us here so
[1:23:58] if we read on further it says in hebrews
[1:24:01] 6 it says without faith
[1:24:04] it's impossible to please him
[1:24:11] you can't please god without faith
[1:24:16] okay if you're trying to live in a
[1:24:17] kingdom
[1:24:19] and not please the king
[1:24:23] things won't go very well for you
[1:24:30] it just makes sense
[1:24:33] right you can't be there
[1:24:35] raising insurrection
[1:24:37] against the king
[1:24:39] and and
[1:24:41] speaking blasphemes
[1:24:43] to the king
[1:24:45] the king will simply
[1:24:48] put you out of his kingdom
[1:24:51] whether he puts you out of the kingdom
[1:24:53] by putting you in his dungeon
[1:24:55] or whether he carries you out to some
[1:24:57] other borders and let's go
[1:25:00] but we've you we have all got to
[1:25:04] realize now
[1:25:06] that the world has left us
[1:25:13] they're no longer wishing to retain god
[1:25:16] in their knowledge
[1:25:18] they give no consideration to god
[1:25:21] no consideration education and science
[1:25:25] and civilization is what their god is
[1:25:29] they no longer have place
[1:25:32] for
[1:25:34] god in their society this is the first
[1:25:38] time in history that more people in the
[1:25:41] united states do not go to church than
[1:25:44] those that do
[1:25:51] and
[1:25:52] streaming don't count as going to church
[1:26:00] and the scripture tells us to forsake
[1:26:02] not
[1:26:03] the assembling of ourselves
[1:26:06] together
[1:26:09] but
[1:26:10] let's settle that this morning
[1:26:14] there is a real kingdom
[1:26:20] behold the kingdom of god is at hand
[1:26:24] there is a real kingdom
[1:26:26] and in that kingdom there is a governing
[1:26:30] law
[1:26:32] that runs that kingdom
[1:26:37] it is what controls the society
[1:26:42] of that kingdom
[1:26:47] and that
[1:26:48] rule of law in the kingdom of god is
[1:26:52] faith
[1:26:54] that's how you live in the kingdom of
[1:26:57] god you live in the kingdom of god by
[1:27:00] faith
[1:27:01] by faith if you believe
[1:27:04] and you put the king first everything
[1:27:07] will be taken care of
[1:27:10] if you believe all things that you ask
[1:27:12] for
[1:27:14] you shall have them
[1:27:16] by faith in this kingdom if you come
[1:27:19] upon some obstacle or some mountain or
[1:27:23] some valley that you can speak to that
[1:27:26] mountain and if you believe in your
[1:27:28] heart it'll be moved
[1:27:30] in other words faith is what puts you
[1:27:34] living in a kingdom that actually has a
[1:27:37] civilization of faith
[1:27:40] things happen in the kingdom of god that
[1:27:43] don't happen in the world
[1:27:49] and it is a place you can live
[1:27:54] because he gives you the spirit
[1:27:57] to live there
[1:28:01] you got carnal life
[1:28:03] that right
[1:28:05] and because you were born in whichever
[1:28:07] country you were born in and
[1:28:09] and that allowed you to come to this
[1:28:11] country because your flesh lives in this
[1:28:14] country you live in this country by the
[1:28:17] flesh
[1:28:18] but and so we have the spirit the spirit
[1:28:22] of america
[1:28:25] the you know the spirit of the way
[1:28:27] things are done here and
[1:28:29] you know if you go to england they drive
[1:28:31] on the wrong side of the road
[1:28:36] no
[1:28:37] they say we drive on the wrong side of
[1:28:39] the road
[1:28:42] but there's a spirit
[1:28:45] that god gives us
[1:28:49] that allows us to live in his kingdom
[1:28:53] and that is his spirit
[1:28:57] that's what the holy spirit is
[1:28:59] the holy spirit is the same spirit that
[1:29:03] dwelt in jesus christ
[1:29:06] jesus had the personality of god
[1:29:09] what dwelt in jesus was the spirit of
[1:29:13] god it was a spirit that was holy
[1:29:17] why was it holy why do we call it the
[1:29:19] holy spirit because the spirit he had
[1:29:23] was without sin
[1:29:25] it was without unbelief
[1:29:28] which of you can convict me of sin or
[1:29:32] unbelief
[1:29:34] so he was the first fruits
[1:29:37] of that kingdom
[1:29:39] that's why they said behold the kingdom
[1:29:41] of god behold the lamb of god
[1:29:45] he says in my father's house are many
[1:29:47] mansions
[1:29:49] if it were not so i would not tell you
[1:29:51] if my kingdom were of this world
[1:29:55] my soldiers would come fight for me
[1:30:01] so he's invited us
[1:30:05] to enter into
[1:30:08] his kingdom
[1:30:11] which is operated and lived in by faith
[1:30:18] hook it's extremely important
[1:30:23] that
[1:30:25] we come to a greater
[1:30:28] revelation
[1:30:30] and understanding of the need for faith
[1:30:37] and
[1:30:39] the
[1:30:41] understanding
[1:30:42] of that we need to use it more in our
[1:30:46] lives
[1:30:47] it's not just for catastrophe
[1:30:53] it's for everything
[1:30:58] so faith
[1:31:00] uh
[1:31:02] we
[1:31:03] we need faith
[1:31:05] to fight
[1:31:09] because this kingdom
[1:31:12] of the world
[1:31:13] is trying to overcome our kingdom
[1:31:19] oh yeah
[1:31:22] in fact
[1:31:24] satan offered
[1:31:27] his kingdoms
[1:31:29] to the king of kings
[1:31:32] and he said no
[1:31:36] get behind me
[1:31:38] because i have a kingdom that won't
[1:31:40] perish
[1:31:44] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[1:31:47] word will not pass away
[1:31:50] so we want to live by something
[1:31:54] that is not going to pass away and you
[1:31:58] can't live by the word of god without
[1:32:01] faith in it
[1:32:04] so what what are we
[1:32:07] trusting because faith has to have a
[1:32:10] place to rest
[1:32:15] i'd like to read a few statements to you
[1:32:18] as we just
[1:32:20] fellowship
[1:32:22] along but i thought
[1:32:24] this was a an outstanding statement
[1:32:28] to see if i can
[1:32:30] find it here
[1:32:36] maybe i i forgot to mark it but uh
[1:32:43] in other words
[1:32:46] let me see just give me one second if i
[1:32:48] can just i thought i marked it but uh
[1:32:57] well i guess i i didn't but i'll just
[1:32:59] tell it to you he says god has to prove
[1:33:03] to you he's god
[1:33:05] in order for you to believe him
[1:33:13] now so
[1:33:14] let's understand god's not asking you to
[1:33:17] believe
[1:33:18] in something
[1:33:20] right i was fellowshipping with
[1:33:23] uh my barber and i was trying to explain
[1:33:27] to her i said you can't ask for
[1:33:30] something unless it's in existence
[1:33:34] we're talking about deep calling to a
[1:33:36] deep
[1:33:37] and and she's confused about the church
[1:33:40] world she she doesn't like what she sees
[1:33:43] in the churches she's continually
[1:33:45] telling me
[1:33:47] my preacher says this but that's not
[1:33:49] what the bible says that preacher says
[1:33:51] this but that's not what the bible says
[1:33:54] i thought my goodness
[1:33:55] i'm going to get my hair cut every other
[1:33:57] day
[1:33:58] okay yeah you know what i mean i may p
[1:34:01] she just uh you know and and and i know
[1:34:04] that
[1:34:06] that what she's seeking for
[1:34:09] is truth
[1:34:11] and the truth lies in the word of god
[1:34:16] he said i am the way the truth the life
[1:34:20] no man comes unto the father but by me
[1:34:24] until you've got to enter into this
[1:34:26] world of faith
[1:34:29] and god
[1:34:30] doesn't
[1:34:32] leave you
[1:34:34] empty without something to
[1:34:37] believe in so he's got to prove to you
[1:34:40] first that he's god
[1:34:43] so faith
[1:34:44] resting place it's got to
[1:34:47] rest in something and it's got to
[1:34:50] rest in something that god has made real
[1:34:55] to you
[1:34:58] else it's intellectual
[1:35:07] he said
[1:35:09] verily verily i say unto you that
[1:35:11] whatsoever ye shall say unto this
[1:35:13] mountain
[1:35:15] be removed and cast
[1:35:18] into the sea
[1:35:21] and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:35:24] but believe that those things which he
[1:35:27] saith
[1:35:28] is coming to pass
[1:35:30] he shall have
[1:35:32] whatsoever he's sayeth
[1:35:36] what a promise
[1:35:41] he's introducing his kingdom
[1:35:44] if you live by faith
[1:35:48] things that that you wouldn't even
[1:35:51] believe was possible
[1:35:53] could happen
[1:35:57] faith in god
[1:36:00] it's staggering thing
[1:36:02] to many people
[1:36:06] faith in god is a staggering thing to
[1:36:09] many people
[1:36:11] in other words
[1:36:14] am i going to take my existence
[1:36:19] and my self-care
[1:36:22] and the provisions of my life
[1:36:27] am i going to take my life
[1:36:31] which
[1:36:32] we uh we have survival instincts
[1:36:35] we have
[1:36:36] self-preservation instincts we have all
[1:36:40] these things another am i going to take
[1:36:42] my life
[1:36:43] and put it into the care
[1:36:46] of god
[1:36:52] oh that's what they ask ananias and
[1:36:54] sapphira
[1:36:57] go sell all you have
[1:36:59] bring it here
[1:37:00] enter into this new life
[1:37:03] and they held back
[1:37:08] they didn't believe
[1:37:10] now their sin wasn't holding back
[1:37:12] their sin was lying about it
[1:37:15] that they thought they could deceive god
[1:37:18] and enter in you know your life will
[1:37:21] prove whether you're living by faith or
[1:37:24] not
[1:37:25] because
[1:37:26] but it's a staggering thing to many
[1:37:28] people
[1:37:30] and yet we ought to be ashamed of
[1:37:32] ourselves to confess that we don't have
[1:37:36] faith in god
[1:37:42] what a
[1:37:43] what a thing
[1:37:46] just say i do not totally completely
[1:37:50] put my life into the hands of god
[1:37:55] oh you're going to let
[1:37:56] somebody else rule your life
[1:38:01] why we we don't want to do that that's
[1:38:04] right
[1:38:04] okay we're reading the world don't want
[1:38:07] us we're outcasts the shuck is pulled
[1:38:10] away from us we're a seed waiting for
[1:38:12] harvest we have nothing left to do
[1:38:17] our existence is not going to be because
[1:38:20] we please man
[1:38:22] our existence is because we put god's
[1:38:24] word first and god keeps us
[1:38:30] he provides for us he takes care of us
[1:38:33] the boss wants to fire you and he can't
[1:38:44] something's standing in your way and the
[1:38:46] lord comes on the scene
[1:38:48] amen
[1:38:50] you know what he did for israel he sent
[1:38:52] hornets out
[1:38:55] the army all gets in a ray to fight
[1:38:57] israel and all of a sudden hornets sting
[1:38:59] them
[1:39:01] israel just marches right on through
[1:39:05] amen
[1:39:06] so
[1:39:07] if it presses down to us
[1:39:11] that we've come to it a
[1:39:13] hour
[1:39:15] that we might think you're going to
[1:39:17] advance
[1:39:21] but you're not going to advance in the
[1:39:23] world
[1:39:25] because the very seed within you will
[1:39:29] cause confusion
[1:39:31] in your mind
[1:39:33] if you try to advance
[1:39:38] you'll live with a continual turmoil
[1:39:41] and battle
[1:39:43] it comes to a time that we've got to
[1:39:46] finally come to the place where we say
[1:39:49] i'm going to believe god
[1:39:51] have faith in god
[1:39:54] have faith
[1:39:56] put your faith
[1:39:58] in him
[1:39:59] so let's talk just a few
[1:40:01] things about faith so we know faith
[1:40:03] final resting place is the word of god
[1:40:08] so god has to prove his word to be true
[1:40:12] in order for you to have faith in it
[1:40:18] jesus didn't come with word only
[1:40:22] he came with power and demonstration
[1:40:26] he turned the water into wine
[1:40:29] he he healed the blind man he
[1:40:32] touched the leopard
[1:40:34] he preached the kingdom of god
[1:40:37] with gladness
[1:40:38] as the people saw him he proved to them
[1:40:42] beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:40:45] by vindicated word that what that he was
[1:40:49] saying was truth another he proved it to
[1:40:53] them that it was the truth in order for
[1:40:56] them to have faith in it
[1:41:02] can you understand he's never asked you
[1:41:05] to have any form
[1:41:08] of blind faith
[1:41:10] he's only asked us to believe in what
[1:41:13] was true
[1:41:15] that's why in this generation
[1:41:18] you'll hear many times the prophet of
[1:41:20] god say dance in the spirit shout
[1:41:23] prophesy do all these things and don't
[1:41:26] believe the word
[1:41:31] now the word in our day
[1:41:34] malachi 4 5
[1:41:37] was manifested and scripturally brought
[1:41:41] to pass
[1:41:42] in a
[1:41:44] messenger to the church
[1:41:47] and his name was william branham
[1:41:49] that was just his name it could have
[1:41:51] been any other name
[1:41:53] in in
[1:41:54] in the world
[1:41:57] that's just the name of the name of the
[1:42:00] minister
[1:42:01] the fleshly name of the body of the man
[1:42:05] in whom
[1:42:06] god brought the word to pass
[1:42:10] look malachi 4 5 was something that was
[1:42:14] brought to pass
[1:42:16] luke 17 30
[1:42:20] the ministry of the son of man
[1:42:24] which was the lord jesus taking on the
[1:42:27] form again
[1:42:29] of a prophet
[1:42:33] the vessel wasn't
[1:42:36] the lord jesus
[1:42:38] the spirit that was in the vessel was
[1:42:42] the lord jesus
[1:42:43] jesus said i will appear again
[1:42:47] in the ministry of a prophet and i'll
[1:42:51] reimpersonate again i will do the things
[1:42:54] that i did when i was on earth i will re
[1:42:58] redo those same ministries those same
[1:43:01] works those same miracles for the
[1:43:04] gentile church
[1:43:08] amen so here was a man that looked like
[1:43:11] a man just like me
[1:43:15] very similar in height
[1:43:17] stature thinner than i am
[1:43:21] a lot of the
[1:43:23] just a man
[1:43:25] but there was something that dwelt in
[1:43:27] that man because he was a prepared
[1:43:30] vessel by god
[1:43:34] that the spirit of god that the lord
[1:43:37] jesus christ in spirit form
[1:43:40] that's what the holy spirit is it isn't
[1:43:42] a third person of the trinity it's the
[1:43:45] same god
[1:43:47] back
[1:43:48] dwelling in us
[1:43:50] in spirit form if the spirit that dwelt
[1:43:54] in jesus christ dwell in your mortal
[1:43:57] body it'll also quicken your mortal body
[1:44:02] and he did the same wonders he did the
[1:44:05] same signs
[1:44:07] he did the same works
[1:44:09] he raised the dead the blind received
[1:44:12] their sight the lame walk
[1:44:16] wasn't brother branham that did that
[1:44:21] he was the vessel that the lord jesus
[1:44:23] christ used to do that there's only one
[1:44:26] healer
[1:44:28] in that healer's god
[1:44:31] that was the promised
[1:44:34] word of god
[1:44:37] made manifest that it was true
[1:44:40] so he never asked you to believe this
[1:44:42] message based on anything intellectual
[1:44:46] in fact jesus didn't ask
[1:44:49] them to believe him
[1:44:51] intellectually
[1:44:52] he said if you can't believe what i
[1:44:55] teach
[1:44:56] believe believe me for the works that
[1:44:59] were done
[1:45:02] because they testify
[1:45:04] of who that i am
[1:45:07] so you understand god's not asking you
[1:45:09] to put your faith
[1:45:12] in a theology
[1:45:15] he's not asking you to put your faith in
[1:45:17] an intellectual conception
[1:45:20] he's only asking us to put our faith in
[1:45:23] something that he absolutely
[1:45:26] identified and proved to us to be true
[1:45:35] luke 17 30.
[1:45:37] we've seen it
[1:45:39] made manifest revelations 10 7
[1:45:43] the mighty angel set his foot on the
[1:45:46] land in the sea
[1:45:47] john prophesied of it
[1:45:50] we we see the
[1:45:52] the representation of that in the sky
[1:45:55] and the opening of the seals
[1:46:00] so when he talks about when he talks
[1:46:02] about the word
[1:46:04] that's why he he chastised the church
[1:46:07] you believe all these things but you
[1:46:09] don't believe the word
[1:46:12] when it come to pass
[1:46:16] and so now he's asking us to believe the
[1:46:19] word of god
[1:46:21] to put our confidence in it to put our
[1:46:24] trust in it to believe what it says
[1:46:29] because through that we'll have life
[1:46:33] to live in this world
[1:46:36] until our time of departure comes
[1:46:40] and it's the faith in the word that
[1:46:43] keeps the world out of our life
[1:46:50] if not everything can slip in
[1:46:55] i'm not kidding you
[1:46:57] you know
[1:46:59] you know sports slips in
[1:47:02] television slips in movies slip in
[1:47:04] things just slip in
[1:47:07] it's not
[1:47:08] that
[1:47:10] it's not that
[1:47:11] uh
[1:47:13] that
[1:47:14] everything is evil right
[1:47:17] it's what happens is that we're trying
[1:47:19] to
[1:47:20] satisfy
[1:47:22] something with something else
[1:47:27] it's like hunting
[1:47:28] i like to hunt
[1:47:30] i'm not very good at it i think i'm a
[1:47:32] better fisherman and i'm a hunter and
[1:47:34] i'm not a good fisherman
[1:47:36] but
[1:47:37] you
[1:47:38] you don't go out there just to kill
[1:47:40] no sir
[1:47:41] you know you're there because you you
[1:47:43] you're outdoors you you love the things
[1:47:45] you love nature it's time you can talk
[1:47:48] with god and get along with god the
[1:47:51] hunting itself won't satisfy you the
[1:47:53] fishing itself won't satisfy you
[1:47:57] but it's fellowship with god that
[1:47:59] satisfies you
[1:48:00] you might have something else you like
[1:48:02] to do it's fine but you know if you keep
[1:48:06] him in every part of your life you have
[1:48:08] peace
[1:48:10] if you live by faith and walk by faith
[1:48:14] then you find out there's a satisfaction
[1:48:17] and a confidence in your life that
[1:48:20] that holds you
[1:48:23] and then you can recognize
[1:48:26] when something is trying to pull you
[1:48:29] away from your kingdom
[1:48:33] because that's what sin is
[1:48:35] sin is unbelief
[1:48:37] it's satan inviting you out of the
[1:48:40] kingdom of god with another greater
[1:48:42] promise
[1:48:46] oh i'll give you a better job wait a
[1:48:48] minute
[1:48:50] do i need a better job
[1:48:53] thank you satan you're going to give me
[1:48:55] a better job
[1:48:57] with more stress
[1:48:59] more headaches
[1:49:01] more pain
[1:49:04] i get to work
[1:49:06] 65 hours a week
[1:49:08] instead of
[1:49:10] 40 hours a week
[1:49:13] but you can buy a better car that cost
[1:49:15] me more to repair
[1:49:17] cost me more for insurance
[1:49:19] you know there's a reason he said god
[1:49:21] come to the poor in this world rich in
[1:49:24] faith
[1:49:26] we don't want to be attracted away
[1:49:30] from the kingdom of god
[1:49:32] we want our faith
[1:49:35] to grow
[1:49:36] because
[1:49:37] that we have the faith to live in the
[1:49:40] kingdom of god to live by the promises
[1:49:45] that he gave us in this kingdom of god
[1:49:48] that we can live by the promised word
[1:49:51] it's by these great and precious
[1:49:53] promises
[1:49:55] that we become partakers
[1:49:58] of divine nature
[1:50:00] so he gives us the promise
[1:50:03] and now he says if you believe in my
[1:50:05] promises
[1:50:07] you'll be a partaker of my kingdom you
[1:50:10] will enter into a peace and a rest
[1:50:13] that that surpasses understanding
[1:50:18] joy unspeakable
[1:50:20] full of glory
[1:50:22] and you will to be living a life in the
[1:50:25] spirit of god that's so comforting
[1:50:29] and so full of joy and you don't care
[1:50:32] what goes on to the world because you
[1:50:34] know you have a place prepared for you
[1:50:37] you're on a pathway to glory you have
[1:50:40] eternal life and it doesn't matter you
[1:50:42] don't have to show say nothing
[1:50:49] well let's talk about just faith in just
[1:50:51] a few moments we're closing
[1:50:54] it says and usually people who have
[1:50:57] faith
[1:50:59] are people who have experience
[1:51:04] experience brings faith
[1:51:07] i think that's the reason the bible
[1:51:10] teaches us
[1:51:12] and jesus says in saint john the third
[1:51:15] chapter except a man be born again
[1:51:19] he cannot understand the kingdom
[1:51:23] of god
[1:51:27] therefore people ought to be saved
[1:51:30] before
[1:51:31] first
[1:51:32] they come to god
[1:51:34] and have an experience of salvation
[1:51:38] before they
[1:51:39] appreciate for their healing
[1:51:42] it must
[1:51:44] it'll work wonders
[1:51:46] if you can only believe
[1:51:51] so
[1:51:54] it's important
[1:51:56] to have an experience
[1:52:00] that you can build your faith on
[1:52:04] now we're not void of experience
[1:52:08] ephesians
[1:52:09] uh
[1:52:10] uh two and eight
[1:52:13] that's a good scripture let's just put
[1:52:15] that there on the board ephesians
[1:52:18] two and eight
[1:52:23] it says
[1:52:31] for by grace
[1:52:34] are you saved
[1:52:35] through faith
[1:52:37] and not of yourself
[1:52:39] it is the gift
[1:52:41] of god
[1:52:43] your first experience that god is
[1:52:47] wanting
[1:52:48] to
[1:52:49] build your faith with
[1:52:51] is the conviction
[1:52:53] of the spirit of god on your life
[1:52:59] you're living your world
[1:53:02] you're you're doing whatever you're
[1:53:03] doing and all of a sudden
[1:53:06] for some reason a conviction
[1:53:09] begins to work in your life
[1:53:13] you're convicted of sin
[1:53:15] because the spirit of god convicts men
[1:53:18] of sin
[1:53:19] you know you're not living right
[1:53:22] you know you're not heaven bound
[1:53:24] you know you're not
[1:53:26] that what you're doing is wrong
[1:53:29] all of a sudden there's a great
[1:53:30] dissatisfaction in your life and your
[1:53:33] heart with the things that are going on
[1:53:35] in your life and all of a sudden can you
[1:53:38] now out of the middle of nowhere having
[1:53:41] a consciousness with god
[1:53:44] that's the beginning of faith
[1:53:51] that's god giving you faith
[1:53:53] that's him making himself real to you
[1:53:57] convicting you of sin because he wants
[1:54:00] to transform you
[1:54:04] and have you become
[1:54:05] born again
[1:54:07] he wants to take you from the life that
[1:54:09] you're living into the kingdom that he
[1:54:13] has prepared for you
[1:54:15] taking you from the world to the kingdom
[1:54:18] of god that is by
[1:54:20] grace that is by invite
[1:54:24] god did that
[1:54:28] patrick and i were fellowshipping
[1:54:32] last evening and he came by him
[1:54:35] and
[1:54:36] uh as you know his little
[1:54:40] daughter was born uh premature and
[1:54:43] and the doctor told her she couldn't go
[1:54:45] out in public for
[1:54:46] three months and you know covet and all
[1:54:49] the things with so they came to show me
[1:54:51] the little darling and she's
[1:54:53] she's up ten pounds now you know in four
[1:54:55] months from two and a half pounds
[1:54:59] you know so god's being wonderful
[1:55:04] but
[1:55:05] patrick was
[1:55:07] suicidal
[1:55:11] and he was at work one day and he told
[1:55:14] the
[1:55:15] the fellow sitting next to him
[1:55:18] i might not be here tomorrow i'm going
[1:55:19] to kill myself
[1:55:22] now the guy he was talking to
[1:55:25] used to come to this assembly
[1:55:28] but he had dropped out his church and
[1:55:30] was backslid
[1:55:34] look he looks at patrick before you do
[1:55:36] that go talk to these people
[1:55:42] so
[1:55:43] he came over were you speaking english
[1:55:45] back then patrick a little bit english
[1:55:48] pretty good english okay
[1:55:52] and patrick came over to
[1:55:56] the house
[1:55:59] god
[1:56:01] was dealing with him
[1:56:03] that wasn't anybody that was the grace
[1:56:05] of god
[1:56:07] [Music]
[1:56:09] and we prayed with him
[1:56:12] and we told him about the lord and we
[1:56:14] talked to him that that that re that
[1:56:16] wouldn't solve the problem and and
[1:56:19] because there'd be a greater problem on
[1:56:21] the other side of death and er and he
[1:56:24] took he took it and he
[1:56:27] he said to me he said i i can't live the
[1:56:30] way i'm living i can't sleep
[1:56:32] i haven't slept in days and days and
[1:56:35] weeks and i got all these addictions and
[1:56:38] he just couldn't sleep
[1:56:40] and so i just told myself patrick
[1:56:42] look it we prayed
[1:56:44] and i said when you it was what did did
[1:56:47] you bring him over billy and after and i
[1:56:49] said billy will give you something to
[1:56:52] listen to and something to read
[1:56:55] so billy looks in there and he's and
[1:56:57] he's sitting in his car
[1:56:58] and
[1:56:59] billy had some books there and he told
[1:57:01] patrick just take one of these books and
[1:57:03] read it
[1:57:04] well patrick grabbed demonology
[1:57:10] of god
[1:57:13] you see god is going to give you
[1:57:16] something to build your faith
[1:57:22] he duck he's not talking to you about
[1:57:24] intellectually
[1:57:25] taking a scripture and believing it like
[1:57:28] an encyclopedia
[1:57:30] he's not asking you to believe he's
[1:57:33] asking you to believe in him
[1:57:36] because he is the word he is
[1:57:40] what he promises
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:45] but because it's by those promises
[1:57:47] you're partakers of divine nature so
[1:57:51] he's not asking you to have faith in a
[1:57:54] mind game
[1:57:57] or the faith in the word of god every
[1:58:01] person that's in here whether you're
[1:58:03] living right for god or not or whether
[1:58:06] you're in the valley of decision god
[1:58:09] somewhere sometime in your life knocked
[1:58:12] on your heart
[1:58:16] because the scripture says you have not
[1:58:19] chosen me i have chosen you and that's
[1:58:22] what he wants you to build your faith on
[1:58:25] is what he's done for you
[1:58:31] i'm glad god convicts me of sin
[1:58:35] amen
[1:58:36] the scripture tells us
[1:58:38] do not don't be discouraged when you're
[1:58:41] chastised because he loves those who
[1:58:44] chastise us
[1:58:48] that's the grace and beauty of god
[1:58:52] and so
[1:58:53] patrick grabbed it and billy gave him
[1:58:55] some tapes
[1:58:57] and all of a sudden one day i
[1:58:59] i see him coming across the parking lot
[1:59:02] and i wonder how he's doing he looks so
[1:59:04] much better
[1:59:08] and he comes up to me says pastor
[1:59:11] i can't sleep
[1:59:14] i thought i prayed for you that you
[1:59:15] sleep he says no he says it's those
[1:59:17] tapes i just listen to them and i can't
[1:59:20] turn them off i just love to hear the
[1:59:22] word of god it's such a blessing
[1:59:25] amen praise god
[1:59:29] now he's got something
[1:59:33] where his faith rests
[1:59:35] it wasn't a paper promise
[1:59:40] you understand it was an experience
[1:59:44] of god knocking
[1:59:46] on his heart
[1:59:55] you know how when you got your healing
[1:59:59] was in that day at home
[2:00:01] when you listened to that word and that
[2:00:04] word touched you
[2:00:09] and you came to this church
[2:00:11] and you walked up in front of this
[2:00:13] congregation and she says i can't fight
[2:00:17] it
[2:00:17] anymore
[2:00:20] what i'm hearing is truth
[2:00:25] you know you know we think we muster up
[2:00:28] healing
[2:00:30] healing is a part of it
[2:00:32] when you accepted it
[2:00:35] you accepted your healing that's the
[2:00:37] place he wants you to put your faith in
[2:00:40] it's in the experience he doesn't get
[2:00:43] you where okay if you believe work it up
[2:00:48] very good no
[2:00:50] he gives you the experience the people
[2:00:52] that have had faith and have
[2:00:54] accomplished something were people who
[2:00:56] had an experience
[2:00:58] he says it behooves us to have an
[2:01:00] experience before faith can ever
[2:01:04] accomplish very much
[2:01:09] think of it
[2:01:11] sometimes we abandon
[2:01:15] the birth that we had
[2:01:18] and that's the foundation of our faith
[2:01:22] you can read these scriptures every day
[2:01:25] and it will never build your faith
[2:01:29] but if you know that you pass from death
[2:01:31] on the life
[2:01:33] and you know he called you he know you
[2:01:36] know he saved you you know that he's the
[2:01:40] the one that you're eternally secure
[2:01:43] with
[2:01:44] now it's on that basis of faith
[2:01:50] that you ask
[2:01:55] it's not a proof
[2:01:58] whether you're a believer or not
[2:02:02] your name was on the lamb's book of life
[2:02:04] before the foundation of the world
[2:02:06] he gave you an experience
[2:02:14] what happened to david
[2:02:18] when i was tending my father's sheep
[2:02:22] out there
[2:02:23] when i walked down through the green
[2:02:25] pastures
[2:02:27] and by the still waters i learned of a
[2:02:30] god who made the heavens
[2:02:33] and earth
[2:02:37] what happened to david
[2:02:40] he had an experience
[2:02:43] he meant god
[2:02:45] i learned of god who made the heavens
[2:02:48] and earth
[2:02:49] and i was responsible for my papa's few
[2:02:52] sheep
[2:02:54] and a bear run in and grabbed one and i
[2:02:57] slew him
[2:02:59] and a lion
[2:03:00] ran in and grabbed a
[2:03:02] kid
[2:03:04] and took off
[2:03:06] and i knocked him down with my slingshot
[2:03:08] and when he raised up i grabbed him by
[2:03:11] the beard and slew him he said the god
[2:03:16] that delivered the bear
[2:03:18] and the lion
[2:03:20] how much more will he deliver that
[2:03:23] uncircumcised philistine into my hands
[2:03:28] the god that saved me from the sin
[2:03:32] the god that came into my life
[2:03:35] and took me from madness
[2:03:39] to joy
[2:03:41] from no hope
[2:03:43] to eternal life
[2:03:46] that's the god
[2:03:48] that i believe
[2:03:50] is with me
[2:03:56] he said that god
[2:03:58] this uncircumcised
[2:04:00] certainly
[2:04:02] he knew
[2:04:03] what he was talking about
[2:04:06] he had faith in god
[2:04:08] he had an experience
[2:04:10] to see what god would do
[2:04:13] therefore he knew that experience would
[2:04:17] carry him
[2:04:19] to victory
[2:04:21] can you imagine any greater thing god
[2:04:25] could do for you than give you eternal
[2:04:27] life
[2:04:31] that's why you can say
[2:04:33] i got financial trouble the god
[2:04:36] who saved me the god who changed my
[2:04:39] nature the god who introduced himself to
[2:04:42] me and called me for sin that's the
[2:04:45] person
[2:04:47] that's the god that's going to deliver
[2:04:49] me out of this crisis
[2:04:54] but if
[2:04:55] you if you don't have that
[2:04:57] you're trying to read a paper promise
[2:05:00] and kind of come up with something to
[2:05:02] make it work
[2:05:06] it works because of what he did for you
[2:05:10] it works because of the experience he
[2:05:12] gave you it works because of the blood
[2:05:15] that bought you it's part of that
[2:05:20] what you have need of is part of the
[2:05:23] salvation he gave you when he laid the
[2:05:26] foundation for your life
[2:05:30] that's where it's at
[2:05:32] it's because of that
[2:05:36] that's why you can ask i never asked to
[2:05:38] be saved
[2:05:43] no i'm saying that for me
[2:05:46] i
[2:05:47] never
[2:05:48] asked to be saved
[2:05:53] he came down
[2:05:55] in my life
[2:05:58] drove me
[2:06:00] to my knees by putting me in a situation
[2:06:04] i could not escape
[2:06:06] without him
[2:06:08] and he squeezed me so hard that i
[2:06:11] finally cried out god help me god help
[2:06:14] me i don't know what i am
[2:06:17] but i'm not this
[2:06:20] many of you are raised in the truth
[2:06:22] and you know what it's like to run from
[2:06:24] that truth and you know what that truth
[2:06:26] comes when it comes haunting you and
[2:06:28] finally brings you to the place in that
[2:06:31] secret place of your heart
[2:06:34] where you go i know this is true
[2:06:39] that's where it begins
[2:06:43] if we can't be sure of that
[2:06:46] how are we going to be sure of all the
[2:06:49] things that we need
[2:06:52] brother chris you know how it was
[2:06:53] sitting at that desk that day
[2:06:56] he's working away making that money
[2:07:00] selling that stuff just doing great
[2:07:05] out of the middle of nowhere
[2:07:08] sitting at his desk
[2:07:10] a spirit drops down
[2:07:16] could i use the word undone
[2:07:20] and he comes totally undone
[2:07:24] breaks down balling out over a desk
[2:07:27] crying out
[2:07:28] because now he needs god
[2:07:33] now chris wasn't sitting there going
[2:07:35] wait a minute god's gonna drop down give
[2:07:38] me salation hallelujah
[2:07:43] he was going to go to the gym and bench
[2:07:45] that
[2:07:45] 375 pounds or 550 or whatever he bench
[2:07:49] passed
[2:07:50] and he's going to do this and he was
[2:07:52] going to do that
[2:07:55] and in a twinkling of an eye
[2:08:00] in a moment
[2:08:05] the spirit of god
[2:08:07] dropped down
[2:08:11] and changed them
[2:08:14] just like that
[2:08:18] that's what you believe from
[2:08:21] the prophet god said before it behooves
[2:08:24] us
[2:08:25] to have a born-again experience
[2:08:29] because faith has got to have a place
[2:08:32] that rests
[2:08:33] and it rests on the word of god it's the
[2:08:36] father's perfect will that all men
[2:08:39] be saved
[2:08:43] it says the lord appeared to nathan and
[2:08:45] said go tell my servant david i know he
[2:08:48] was just a little ruddy thing
[2:08:51] i know he was wearing sheep
[2:08:54] coat
[2:08:55] but i took him away
[2:08:57] from that cheap coat and made him ruler
[2:08:59] over my people and gave him a name like
[2:09:02] great men of the earth
[2:09:04] how god seen
[2:09:06] that sincerity of faith to believe him
[2:09:10] upon an experience that he was the
[2:09:13] living god
[2:09:16] how little it was for abraham
[2:09:20] after he had endured
[2:09:23] endured as seeing him
[2:09:26] whom was invisible
[2:09:28] how after he meant god
[2:09:31] and had an experience
[2:09:33] of talking face to face with god
[2:09:36] that he could call those things which
[2:09:38] were not
[2:09:39] as though they were
[2:09:42] for he had an experience
[2:09:44] he had talked to god
[2:09:46] face to face that's what we need is a
[2:09:49] personal experience with the living god
[2:09:58] why try to go do things
[2:10:03] when the answers in the personal
[2:10:05] experience
[2:10:08] don't struggle on your own
[2:10:12] if you need to overcome
[2:10:14] go get personal yes sir
[2:10:18] that's right if you need an answer
[2:10:21] go get personal
[2:10:23] when he called you you didn't call
[2:10:26] him or choose him he chose you
[2:10:29] my sheep know my voice
[2:10:33] all that the father hath given me will
[2:10:35] come
[2:10:36] if i start a work in you i will finish
[2:10:39] it to the end
[2:10:41] see we we
[2:10:42] we're trying to muster up a faith we're
[2:10:44] trying to come up with something that's
[2:10:46] intellectual and every
[2:10:49] promise
[2:10:52] came with him
[2:10:56] is those promises
[2:10:58] he is that word they they don't sit
[2:11:01] they don't sit separate
[2:11:04] from him
[2:11:08] it's his person that heals
[2:11:13] you don't heal yourself
[2:11:15] by your faith
[2:11:16] that's what they crawled out called out
[2:11:18] to him o physician heal thyself
[2:11:22] he said i'm not going to heal me i'm
[2:11:24] going to heal the whole world
[2:11:29] they're in him
[2:11:32] so when he knocked on your door he just
[2:11:35] wasn't knocking with salvation he was
[2:11:38] knocking with every attribute that he
[2:11:41] was your healing your deliverance you're
[2:11:44] being taken care of your food your
[2:11:47] clothing everything
[2:11:50] it was all in him
[2:11:53] and why did paul says why did you begin
[2:11:57] in faith
[2:11:59] and then are so easily moved
[2:12:02] to theology
[2:12:09] how that after moses
[2:12:12] having 40 years of religious training
[2:12:15] by his mother
[2:12:17] having 40 years of military might in his
[2:12:20] hands
[2:12:22] of how to whoop a nation
[2:12:24] how to conquer
[2:12:26] and it taken
[2:12:27] god 40 years to take it out of him
[2:12:31] but once out there
[2:12:33] in the wilderness
[2:12:34] alone one day he came face to face with
[2:12:38] god
[2:12:39] and in a burning bush
[2:12:41] and he was better equipped
[2:12:44] in five minutes
[2:12:46] after he had talked with god then 80
[2:12:49] years of schooling had done anything to
[2:12:53] him
[2:12:58] if you've had an experience with god
[2:13:00] everything you need
[2:13:03] came with that experience
[2:13:05] because jesus christ is the same
[2:13:08] yesterday today and forever
[2:13:13] it was samson with a jawbone of a mule
[2:13:17] that killed a thousand philistines
[2:13:20] because he had an experience
[2:13:22] that he was born again
[2:13:24] he had an experience
[2:13:27] that he was a nazarite
[2:13:30] the god of heaven
[2:13:32] was with him
[2:13:39] faith
[2:13:44] is the last
[2:13:46] thing
[2:13:48] that we're going to possess
[2:13:52] it is the gift of god
[2:13:54] lest any man should boast
[2:14:00] it was god's gift to you
[2:14:04] like we read in ephesians
[2:14:07] by grace
[2:14:08] we are saved
[2:14:10] it was the gift
[2:14:12] of god
[2:14:15] and everything that he was
[2:14:19] he gave to you
[2:14:21] and you can't
[2:14:24] if there's anything
[2:14:26] that is important for us to do
[2:14:32] it's to go back
[2:14:38] and visit
[2:14:42] the day of our salvation
[2:14:46] the day the tears ran down our cheeks
[2:14:49] the day he lifted that ton of bricks
[2:14:53] and embrace him again
[2:14:56] on the grounds that he embraced you
[2:14:59] because he's never forgot that first hug
[2:15:04] he's never forgot the day that he put
[2:15:06] you in the palm of his hand and promised
[2:15:09] you
[2:15:09] nothing
[2:15:11] will pluck you out
[2:15:15] i will not leave you
[2:15:17] nor forsake you
[2:15:19] but i'll be with you
[2:15:21] even in you
[2:15:23] till the end
[2:15:28] you can meet that god
[2:15:32] how do you know
[2:15:34] you know if he's tugging at your heart
[2:15:38] i i've been a christian
[2:15:40] 50 some
[2:15:41] years
[2:15:44] and i know when the spirit of god comes
[2:15:45] down and convicts me of sin
[2:15:49] i can feel it from my toes to my head
[2:15:53] i can sit there and vibrate
[2:15:55] in that presence
[2:15:59] knowing that he knows
[2:16:01] knowing i haven't done anything that he
[2:16:04] doesn't
[2:16:05] see
[2:16:08] that i'm totally exposed in his presence
[2:16:12] and you know what he does
[2:16:15] he invites me
[2:16:18] to repent
[2:16:21] he invites me to cry abba father
[2:16:27] he invites me to make it right
[2:16:31] he didn't come to torch me
[2:16:36] he come to invite me back
[2:16:38] into his kingdom
[2:16:40] come back to where there's peace
[2:16:43] come back to where there's power come
[2:16:46] back to faith
[2:16:50] come back to believing in what i did for
[2:16:53] you
[2:16:53] in the first place
[2:16:56] because when i started that work
[2:16:59] i'm going to finish it
[2:17:02] and nothing can pluck you out of the
[2:17:04] palm of my hand
[2:17:06] i hope you'll listen to me
[2:17:09] this morning
[2:17:12] and many times i didn't
[2:17:16] and the next time the visitation
[2:17:18] was a little rougher
[2:17:22] and then it followed with something else
[2:17:25] and finally
[2:17:27] he brings me
[2:17:28] back
[2:17:32] like the prodigal son
[2:17:34] he finally brings us
[2:17:36] to ourselves
[2:17:39] so we're gonna have to have faith
[2:17:42] faith is another sense
[2:17:46] it's just like hearing and seeing
[2:17:48] it's something you know
[2:17:51] you've experienced
[2:17:53] it's something that's a substance
[2:17:55] it's something that's real
[2:17:58] and i just wanted to just share it this
[2:18:00] morning to encourage you
[2:18:05] to
[2:18:06] bring to life
[2:18:08] the faith
[2:18:10] that brought you to life
[2:18:12] in the beginning
[2:18:14] the same faith that you believed the day
[2:18:17] you saved is the same faith you use for
[2:18:21] every promise
[2:18:23] in the book
[2:18:25] what did you do to be saved
[2:18:28] nothing
[2:18:31] but what he did for you that day
[2:18:34] entitles you
[2:18:36] to every promise
[2:18:38] in the book god bless you this morning
[2:18:41] let's stand let our faith grow
[2:19:00] as our musicians softly play
[2:19:10] so
[2:19:27] [Music]
[2:19:36] [Music]
[2:19:39] it's just our heads
[2:19:48] and ask yourself
[2:19:55] am i
[2:19:56] living this morning
[2:20:00] in the kingdom of god by faith
[2:20:04] am i trusting
[2:20:07] my total existence
[2:20:09] in his hands
[2:20:13] do i know that there's an eternal reward
[2:20:16] that awaits me
[2:20:22] or do i find myself out on the middle
[2:20:25] ground
[2:20:33] i find myself
[2:20:37] not sold out to either
[2:20:47] and there's
[2:20:48] spoken of a scripture of faith
[2:20:52] that can move mountains
[2:20:55] a faith that i could pray
[2:20:59] and receive what i asked for
[2:21:03] a faith that pleases god
[2:21:07] a faith that believes that
[2:21:09] he's a rewarder
[2:21:13] of those that
[2:21:15] diligently seek him
[2:21:20] and i trust the holy spirit this very
[2:21:22] person of jesus christ himself
[2:21:29] is coming by and
[2:21:31] knocking on your heart
[2:21:37] and inviting you to trust him
[2:21:42] if you have a need in your life
[2:21:49] i could pray for you and
[2:21:52] we could join our faith together and god
[2:21:54] honors that
[2:21:57] or you yourself
[2:22:02] could place it into his
[2:22:06] hands you could
[2:22:08] take the eyes of your heart and
[2:22:12] look straight on this person and say
[2:22:15] lord
[2:22:19] i need deliverance from
[2:22:21] a critical spirit
[2:22:24] lord i need deliverance in my body
[2:22:30] lord i need a mended heart
[2:22:35] lord i know you're here because i feel
[2:22:37] you touching me
[2:22:38] [Music]
[2:22:42] you say well i don't feel anything
[2:22:47] if you'd like to invite him
[2:22:51] say lord i'm sitting here and i don't
[2:22:53] feel a thing
[2:22:56] would you come near to me and
[2:22:59] make your presence known
[2:23:04] lord i don't want a journey in this life
[2:23:08] not knowing where i'm going
[2:23:11] would you make my salvation a reality to
[2:23:14] me
[2:23:16] will we make the reward of eternal life
[2:23:18] become
[2:23:19] so real to me that's all i live for
[2:23:25] lord i'm not going to make the rest of
[2:23:27] this journey
[2:23:29] with satan gaining the power he's
[2:23:32] gaining
[2:23:34] without having faith in you
[2:23:37] and your word
[2:23:40] lord like the little man that lay there
[2:23:42] in desperation he said oh god help my
[2:23:45] unbelief
[2:23:50] lord help our unbelief this morning
[2:23:54] let us rise with the wings of the eagle
[2:23:57] lord
[2:23:59] lord we've got two choices
[2:24:04] we can walk by sight or we can walk by
[2:24:07] faith
[2:24:10] we can believe what you said
[2:24:15] or he can believe the paper
[2:24:17] the radio show
[2:24:20] the government
[2:24:23] whose kingdoms we know
[2:24:26] are of the devil
[2:24:30] because he offered them
[2:24:35] and there's one thing we know about that
[2:24:37] devil
[2:24:38] he's a liar
[2:24:41] and the father of all lies
[2:24:44] and there's no truth in them
[2:24:47] wouldn't you desire this morning to come
[2:24:49] to the truth
[2:24:52] the true word of god
[2:24:54] if you have request would you just slip
[2:24:56] your hand up
[2:24:58] not to me to him
[2:25:00] my hands raised my
