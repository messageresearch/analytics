Lord before you're seated why don't you greet one another welcome each other into the house of the Lord as brother Mike comes why don't you tell each other we're going in the rapture amen praise the Lord amen you may be seated well good morning it's good to see all the any guests in the house this morning I'm glad you could come when we have when the weather is cooler it's um just wait till it's hot you know it's a we're going to read a Psalm here this morning in a minute you know I was thinking as I was going through the week I'm one of those guys that works for a big Corporation a big company and you know the company that I work for like any Corporation likes to completely redesign things every nine to 12 months you know because every good corporate leader knows that you know if you can keep things moving around it looks like you're making progress you may not actually be improving something but the important thing is is you look like you are you know we're going through another one of those organizations again at work and you know over time you start to recognize some of the familiar behaviors in people you know they start to look busy they start to look valuable and important you know all of the sudden the people that you could never find before they'd never take your call you just could never get anything out of them all of a sudden they're everywhere they won't leave you alone and it's frustrating because everyone knows that they aren't actually contributing to the business they're just really good at looking like they are occupying position without progressing the work you know because there are big changes going on and you don't want to find yourself without a position doesn't matter if you're actually productive for doing the work the important thing is you look like you are you know looking and sounding like what you think the leaders want to hear and see I got to thinking about that it occurred to me I wonder how many people respond to the move of the Lord that way where God will come and do a work or he'll be moving somewhere they begin to recognize that something important is taking place so they start doing all the things saying all the things making all the sounds acting all the ways that they believe someone who is Walking with the Lord should do laying claim to a position but not actually progressing the work that's what religion is brother Branham called it make-believers and they're everywhere whenever there's a real need or a testing time or an hour of proving or if there's a work that needs to be done that is difficult maybe not very glorious they're nowhere to be found but whenever there appears to be a great work somewhere they're everywhere worshiping just as loud as they can amending the loudest preachers in the land God seems to be speaking them at every turn but yet they're never actually progressing the work you know Paul said in Romans 12 he said I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice but in verse 2 he tells us why it says that ye may prove demonstrate make known what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you know this is moving beyond someone who claims to be following the will of God moves Beyond someone who is seeking the will of God to someone who is performing the will of God is doing the will of God we're going to read Psalm 20 this morning you know it's just a wonderful Psalm probably familiar to most of us it's you know for years I read this Psalm as a you know it's a Psalm of prayer it's a prayer of blessing it's a you know often you'll see it on the walls of Christian homes and you know I always just read that as you know may this be unto me or may this blessing be unto you but it occurred to me as I was reading this this is this is more than just a prayer blessing or a nice sounding religious may this blessing be upon you this is a Psalm of action this is more than claiming something is being done this is the job this is doing it this is the proof of one who's not only occupying the position but is progressing the work let's look at the evidence of one who is actually progressing the work verse one the Lord hears thee in the day of trouble you know if you have the King James version Bible you'll see a footnote there that says it this way answer thee in a day of trouble but the thing is is this isn't a question there's no prayer here there's no crying outs to the Lord there's no asking a question it's a statement the Lord hears you the Lord responds to you in a day of trouble this isn't a question this is you speak and he answers you know someone who is claiming the position will testify that they are hearing from the Lord and we're grateful when we do someone who's doing the work the Lord hears them you know brother Branham spoke of a people once coming to a place that they will know what he wants done with the word not that they'll believe it not that they'll accept it but that they'll perform the work that the word is supposed to perform you know he always responds to his word doing the job putting the word to work if you skip down to verse 6 of Psalm 20 he explains this a bit more now no I that the Lord saaveth his anointed you know not only does he respond when you speak you know he does there's no hope so there's no question you expected there's no name it claim it nonsense this isn't making a claim or getting worked up in a church service this is knowing that he responds when you speak his word because you're practiced at doing it you know that word anointed there is actually Messiah anointed one Christ in the Greek he will hear from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand there is one who he responds to and it's his word this is my beloved Son hear ye him you're doing the work if you're speaking forth what he will respond to which is the word still in verse 1. the name of the god of Jacob defend thee again a statement of fact not a prayer not a hope that he will defend you but it's a statement again the King James version footnote here says the name of the god of Jacob set thee on high proof of being about the work you know someone who is making a claim to a position will be all about standing against the enemy but someone who's doing the job is not fighting the enemy they're being lifted up above them moving to a place that's even beyond their reach leaving the enemy behind not fighting him leaving him in your dust doing the work lifted up above David says in the Rapture chapter of Psalm 27 verse 6 and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies you know brother Branham spoke about how if Eve had stayed behind the word the enemy would not have been able to reach her not that she'd be able to fight him she'd be out of her his reach a place he cannot go that's still true today more than claiming a position progressing the work you know verse 6 says this we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set up our banners remember in Luke 10 when Jesus sent forth 70 men two by two to go into the City and progress the work they came back in verse 17 and they said this and the seventy returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and their rejoicing was based on the fact that they were defeating devils but that's not the basis of our joy that's not what we get excited about Jesus told them in Luke 10 20 notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven you see they're rejoicing our rejoicing is based on the fact not that we're defeating Devils our focus is not defeating devils the focus is the name we've been given it's a saving name not a defeating name it's about imparting life not defeating devils and that's just verse one you know let's stand this morning we're going to go ahead and read Psalm 20. it's just a short little psalm this is the resume of one who's doing the work not just claiming holds to a position as we'll read verse 2 verse 3 verse 4 statement after statement claim not just claims statements this is happening progressing the work Lord help me to be about the work you know as we continue to see God moving in this hour how many of you believe he is moving in this hour you know I pray that we're not among those who are simply claiming a position getting excited about a position that we've been promised but are progressing the work as evidenced by the scripture being about our father's business let's read our resume this morning the resume of those who are doing the work not just claiming the position starting in verse one let's read that together the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of Jacob defend thee send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of Zion remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice Selah Grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfill all thy counsel we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set up our banners the Lord fulfill all thy positions now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots and summon horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God they are brought down and Fallen but we are risen and stand upright save Lord let the king hear us when we call praise the Lord you may have your seats now let's sing that song there's no God like Jehovah the Days of Elijah they're here amen praise His Wonderful Name well these are the days I've always [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] every year [Applause] [Music] foreign

might depart from this Earth soon and be ever with you we ask your grace and your blessings on these things in Jesus precious name we pray amen you may be seated for a moment it's um certainly a personal privilege to me to have uh brother Tom with me this morning and with you also I normally only get to see him once a year in November and this year I got a special treat so I I'm grateful for that I appreciate you doing this for us this morning just a few moments first of all thank you all for coming and and being here this morning I know we're crowded um but we invite everybody to church in this town but the fire marshal and but uh anyway God provides us and I think we have probably over 450 people this morning in our building but as 400 people lifting their hands to the Lord and magnifying his name we do want to let you know if you would like to go in and inside the new building next door it's open just go through this little hallway door that's right out there and you can walk in and look around the church if you bring your children in there try not to let them run around too much be careful because they're there's you know the just the way construction is but you you're welcome to take a look if you're interested in that and keep us in prayer that certainly we would get it done uh you know I'd like to personally thank my deacons for doing such a wonderful job with the people they're really a great bunch of brothers and I really love them a whole lot a little scripture came unto my heart and I I just uh I'd like to read it to you and it's found in Hebrews the third fourth chapter and the 12th verse and it's one that we all know very very well uh and the 11th Lord says let let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same examples of unbelief for the word of God is quicker and Powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword person piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joint and Marrow and it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed unto the heavens Jesus Christ Son of God let us hold fast to our profession amen I thought this morning I thought you know Lord I'm naked before you because the word of God says you have you know what I have need of there's nothing hidden your sight and I I it's just uh so why should I not take total advantage of this opportunity this morning to let God walk through my life amen separate everything in my life that needs to be separated amen I I just think we've entered into such a time of preparation for the rapture we see all the prophecies coming forth around us so quickly it's just such a time to be so serious with the gospel to lay things behind and separate ourselves from the foolishness of the world and press for that higher calling and that higher Mark and and I'm I'm just grateful that we have received the only word that prepares the bride for the Rapture I mean it's marvelous it just makes my heart rejoice and and to see so many people come from the East the West the north the South land so far so many different languages and cultures all being drawn to that same great Fountain it shows it's only one person can do that amen somebody had to sow this crop hey Mighty somebody had to plant this Garden of Believers someone had to bring it to maturity and he's here here to do that amen so let us stand again this morning as we prepare and uh we like to sing that's all magnify the Lord amen this has kind of become you know that this poor man crying you got that one that's the one I want to say what you say why is that song because this poor man's cried a lot amen this is me and brother Tom's personal revival song well we got singing that up here one night together and we were so drunk in the spirit that we were walking around with our arms one in there we was ready to go I I don't know if that was after a new preacher before but anyway we're gonna sing it again because I love it amen oh I saw it yesterday [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music] hello [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen is my mic on it's okay that's about our heads in the word of Prayer Heavenly Father we've enjoyed the presence of the Lord this morning songs that were sung the specials hearts of your children to glorify the king of glory are lovely Lord Jesus Christ so this morning Lord we find ourselves in the house of God glorifying you one more time asking that you come and Reveal Your word to us so individually Lord that we can mark this day as a special red letter day knowing that the bleeding bloody word Lord has done and is doing its work within our lives father we're thankful for this great Lighthouse that is shining so brightly Pastor David Gary we love him dearly pray Lord God that you'll use them mightily whatever days that we have left may we use it for the kingdom of God so Lord bless your children as we go to the word we ask that you will open it to us in Jesus name we pray amen amen you have your seats one more time I was I was given instruction already a song service was one hour and 15 minutes did you know that well I just told you that she couldn't see it either so let me say brother Billy told me for every one minute of song we get two minutes of preaching [Laughter] so we'll see whether I have mercy on you or not I think thank the Lord for this great opportunity it's incredible what a wedding will do isn't it I come from the East and the West that's the Brother David said the North and the South and and a large group of our people are here and I said poor are poor people I thought brother Roy would he'd love to hear Brother David which he will tonight and the different ones that have come here what they hear me what through how many times a year and and now they're here hearing me again that's weird but I just trust that the Lord will just bless each and every one the bridegroom side the bride's side everybody is here and I hope you're not too tired you fall asleep on me you know me I know this church knows me yeah I I watch your eyeballs and I know he said well we had a great time last night and we're halfway through the service the most important thing is the word of God that's the most important and to see so many friends again it's been a special privilege for me to to be here and thank you brother David for this Grand opportunity I like to bring greetings from my wife sister Joanne and the assembly back home sister Sharon and and Joseph are here from all the way from Hungary it's incredible that they would fly all that way to see her brother get married but she's on her way home back to Cloverdale so that's what happens you know you see these ones they get married and they do eventually come home they do eventually come home and and it's just so special to be here with all all of you and and it was a wonderful time yesterday to see this young couple married and to witness the joy and to witness a union so God bless you all all the saints from Cloverdale and thank you for coming and making it special also we love you dearly and pray that God will bless you brother Gary I haven't seen you in so long I looked at that white hair in the back room and I said that's got to be Brother Gary stanky he's the only one that I know that has weight hair like mine but I think I've had mine longer than you Gary so it's lovely to see you and if you don't mind now we just got a few little comments made and and if you would stand and we will read from the Bible I would also like to make an announcement I I don't know those that are from Cloverdale would you raise your hand please just just lift it away I wanted to account one two three 17 people Brother David McGeary will be speaking at our church October 6th to the 9th and Thanksgiving so we had 17 come down I knew you would get it I knew you would get it hey we're being married or spiritually come on all right so no we would we'd love to have you and we're looking forward to brother McGeary coming to minister to the to the Saints and Cloverdale we've been looking forward to it for a long time Isaiah chapter 43 please thank you Isaiah chapter 43. brother Billy says don't don't you use an iPad I said well I'm I'm that generation that's halfway between iPad and paper because I don't know I went to China One time I had 20 some odd Services all lined up and I bought myself a new uh a little um computer and I thought hey that's perfect I can print out my notes and everything will be fine and I arrived the first day in my computer went blue screen and I couldn't believe it was happening to me and so I was sweating from my neck down and of course I had a few Choice thoughts about Apple and and me and the vice president got to be friends actually and I we tried to correct the condition which we couldn't so then we are have some old paper notes just in case so if you don't mind I won't I won't be long this morning I know you're you've been worn out and we'll try and revive you Isaiah 53 verse 1. I'm sorry 43 Verse 1 you're right but now thus saith the Lord that created thee o Jacob and he that formed thee o Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine now very quickly as we read the scripture I don't want you to think so many hundreds of thousands of years ago I want you to put your name as we read the Bible because the Bible is a personal love letter to the bride so now I'd like to reread that and I want you to keep your thoughts about yourself but now thus saith the Lord that created thee o Jacob and he that formed thee o Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee and have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine when thou passeth through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee will now walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel the Savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and siba for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for their lives fear not I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth and everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yea I have made him verse 10 you then you are my Witnesses saith the Lord my servant of whom I have chosen that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there is no God formed neither shall there be after me may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats God bless you I have the grand privilege of having my granddaughter here Hannah and her husband Caleb and Hannah I was looking at a picture today dear you and I were in China together with the school and it's always nice that you can have your grandchildren serving God it's very very very special when you when us you young fellows get there you'll understand what I'm saying and so God bless Johnny nice to have you here I just love the Lord I do love the Lord let's turn to Joshua please chapter 4. Joshua chapter 4. now I I I know as we approach the word and then everybody might even have a conceived idea of where the preacher is going to preach and even some of our people my people might think that also but we just want to be led by the Holy Spirit to take the word and make it personal and that it will be spiritual food and due season for you individually and so I know we've had some great events but the greatest event there is is the opening of the word brother Peter and so now uh Joshua chapter 4 verse 1. and it came to pass when all the people that were clean passed over Jordan that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every tribe a man and command ye them saying take you hands out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priests feet stood firm 12 Stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall Lodge this night why God was wanting to have a witness of his glory and of his power and so then Joshua called the 12 men of whom he prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe a man and Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder a court it's not a pebble here this wasn't a pebble revelation this was a stone they had to carry on their shoulder the burden of the word of thou Lord was becoming a reality and the stone upon their shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come say what meaneth these Stones then you will answer them and say that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and when it comes to Passover Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be a memorial unto the children of Israel forever and the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded took up the 12 Stones Out of the midst of Jordan as the Lord's fake unto Joshua according to the number of tribes of the children of Israel and carried them over with them unto a place where they lodged and laid them down there what a testimony what a testimony here we are looking at the scripture and we're wondering how how is the word going to affect me or how is it going to be applicable within my life because if the scripture isn't applicable to you it's a story and we don't like storytelling we love word preaching and the word the word went forth and delivered the people it doesn't say stories went forth and delivered the people but the word of God went forth and delivered the people so I might ask you there's a number of saints here this morning every one of you so individual every one of you with all different backgrounds but every one of you have a need period there's not one of us that doesn't have a need and I happen to know a God that can meet your need this morning and it's not going to me me telling you things but if I could take you to the word and let the word speak to your heart then when the word does it it's forever it's eternal and so if you wouldn't if you wouldn't mind giving me some Liberty I I don't want to I I because you can swing one way or another and go intellectual and kill a church you can go emotional and kill a church we want to walk down the middle of this Great River of Life and I want to be looking at Lively Stones I don't want to look at any dead stones here today I want people that actually came out of death and the voice of God raised them up and that you can say what meaneth these Stones Daddy I am a Son of God born by the word of God delivered by the hand of God that has to become a personal revelation and there should be a little bit of Joy knowing that you pass from Death unto life it's not a head thing I'm sorry friends I don't go for head hallelujahs or head amens we're priests we're Kings giving praise and you don't praise them by your head whose name was I thinking right now huh who said James there you go James God had him in his thoughts all I know that he has all your thoughts collectively in the great mind of God and so yes indeed he had everyone Jackson he's got everyone Caleb he's got every one of you in his thoughts so now if God has you in his thoughts can I can I just say something if you were ever in his thoughts you were always in his thoughts okay so any devil that's trying to get you this morning say well I don't know if I'm in or I don't know if I'm out if you've ever found yourself in the mind of God there's no devil there's no doubt there's no preacher there's no doctrine that will take you out of the mind of God you are always in his mind and you always will be in his mind so now I'd like to preach on living Witnesses living Witnesses Living Stones living foreign you can walk through life and you can walk through malls or you can walk through a gas station you go anywhere wherever you were the last week and all you see are people dead while they're living and I I saw this you see this in the advertisement you know Satan is such a mocker he's a mocker I mean I don't know I've never seen it I don't know what they're talking about but I just walked through and they got this this advertisement The Walking Dead I said exactly so they got to make a movie of it just walk out on our streets I don't know what it's about I don't know what it what it is but they are walking dead people but there's a people that are alive and you're called Lively stones amen we're not dead stones we've been birthed by eternal life himself amen we're a living people God sees you thank you brother James thank you he sees you he knows what he wants done that's what brother Brown said in white Christ speak he said the faith in you the faith in you this faith faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but you didn't even know you had Faith until Malachi 4 came and Malachi forward turn the hearts of the children back to the face of their fathers so you didn't even know you had it until this message came so now brother Brahm says faith sees what God wants done all right and I I hope this goes in he's talking to the people Faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't look at your failures I want you to stay with me Faith does not look at your failures he looks at you in glory rejoicing around the Throne of God so Faith doesn't look at this present time Faith doesn't see this here Faith sees what God wants he wants a church triumphant Victorious hmm amen I'm so happy no there's there's an expression that you want to see you see your child if he's sitting on the stairs and he's moping around what's the matter honey what's wrong with you you see people sitting in church moping you know um they don't know my problems God knows all your problems and the problem of it is your faith hasn't reached at a level yet of trusting in God to meet all your needs according to his riches in glory we still bring God down to our level he wants to bring us up to his level so where you can say I can do all things through Christ Jesus that what strengthens me amen so if we don't have a miracle working God then what kind of a God have we got if God can't save you deliver you heal you why are we serving him but that's the God we serve he's the god of the supernatural so now Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks to what God wants God's wanting a Victorious Church Christ and mystery God revealed very often quoted God wants that you know that that's not no big surprise I'm not bringing you some big revelation God knows it God knows a prophet spoke it now he also knows whether or not you've heard it preach which you have or you've read it now that's what God wants for you what do you want it really gets down what do you want as I've often said to our young people I says you love you you know your little girls have their tea parties they have their little fake tea parties they got little cups and saucers and they have that little well we have our pity parties and and when we have those kind of parties we want to out pity the other person isn't that weird that to me is totally bizarre oh if you only knew me huh my pity is bigger than your pity it used to be in the sandbox my daddy was bigger than your daddy but as we get older we get into these different Realms but God is wanting us to look past and look into the realm where God dwells so Faith looks to what God wants and it works accordingly it works accordingly so now you say brother Tom I got faith this morning to believe for the impossible well then it starts to work accordingly it starts to well up within you saying Lord that's what's for me I'm a needy person you're a God that meets my needs it works accordingly so now you do something so you you want the preacher to do it or you want the pastor to do it but you've got to actually put your faith to action and brother Bram so often said you didn't even know sir that you had that much face and you've got it and you don't even realize you got it you got much Faith here this morning and let's start exercising that Faith because Faith doesn't look at the present it looks to see what God wants he wants a church translated it works accordingly and that's what faith does see it sees what God wants and what God wants done Faith operates through that why because he's wanting you and me to be a living Witness of a living God and we wonder sometimes why do our young people leave I wonder what kind of lives the parents are living we're going to get it right down to home because you're the living examples to them they don't see you with joy why should they have joy they hear the preacher say you should have Joey unspeakable and full of glory and daddy and mommy are sitting there without anything and they believe that that's acceptable because they keep coming to church but is that acceptable to God and so then we start to form habits and children take on their parents natures rather than the Holy Spirit nature and that's why you must be born again irregardless of what your father and mother are as Sons and Daughters of God you must be born again outside of that saints of God you're just playing Church brother Brown said now would it would it strengthen now your faith now he's shelling to the people he knows what faith and what God wants in your faith is that so now he wants to strengthen their faith now hear what he says would you would it strengthen your faith to see Elohim there's no message like this message thanks would it help your faith to see Elohim not you and not me but him the word that's what he is he's your protection he's your Armament he's your armor he's the word of God made manifest in human flesh your flesh just a second here I thought you said you he wants you to see Elohim he's what he's wanting to see is God in flesh our faith sees what God wants would it help you to see Elohim he's your armor he's your protector the word of God that's what he is but he's made manifest the word what is it it's your protection God his words made manifest in your human flesh to see the works of God because he wants to see not dead Witnesses but living Witnesses I'm building a platform I'm only laying down a platform okay he wants to see living Witnesses would it help you to strengthen your faith to see Elohim God made manifest in human flesh your flesh My Flesh to see the works of God so now do me a favor those that have known me before have seen me preach I want you to do me a great favor this morning turn around and look at one another I want to see Elohim not her not him no way what do you think this message is it's Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured in you Hallelujah living Witnesses of a living God not just some mental attitude I can quote brother Branham he said this here and he said that there I don't want your quote I want your life Hallelujah it's a life in Christ you can fall asleep fall asleep but if you get him you're a living testimony [Applause] isn't what I want to do this morning is boot every doubting demon because listen we can play Church long enough but what we are we are the church all you are creating a building to make you more comfortable but that's a building a match should go to that building we're having wildfires all over the place and it's burning down buildings and people's homes and they say for their life savings and what did it mean nothing hey honey let's save for this let's save for that we've got to put money away for this money away for that and some crazy forest fire comes burns the whole thing up and you save scrimped I think we should start living for the day sufficient come on live for the day Saints this world's going on fire and it's going to be built burnt with a Holy Fire we're seeing it all over my wife said to me as I said to the brothers the other day she said to me honey when brother Brown saw that vision of American ashes was he meaning the forest fires I go hey not a bad problem but but I said there is one problem with that Revelation honey it's called craters I think there's craters that come with the fire okay but we're seeing as the pastor was saying we're seeing judgment all over the land we aren't building our kingdoms for here we are looking for that Eternal Kingdom that's why he said teach us how to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven Hallelujah so that you could be strengthened by the word encouraged by the word built up in the word amen so that's why he said he's your protection he's your Armament he's your armor he's the word of God he's in human flesh he's in your flesh he's in my flesh and we see the works of God and you turned around and you looked at one another and you looked at God in flesh again wow who's got a problem now good answer no answer yeah that's a good answer what's her problems everything Works to the bad now come on come on everything works to the bad well some of you believe it oh man that was this happening to me it is happening to you because God's Building character [Applause] so there's no woe is me it's all to his glory [Applause] amen so everything that happens is for a reason right Sam everything right you might not like God's reason you don't like the knot hole glamming out backwards but God knows how to mold his bride amen and we have perfect trust in his perfect molding listen to what he says in perseverance are we strangers to one another lady so now God's going to confirm listen to me this is for free anybody that comes against this message and spends a moment's time reading garbage about why this message isn't real you need help because those people have never met the god that William Branham I always call him Johnny come lately huh it's so ridiculous it's like Jason and Korra where were they before Moses come on where were they before Moses bricks bricks bricks bricks then a prophet comes on the scene and my people go [Applause] [Music] then all of a sudden they're delivered now they murmur now they murmur right right has thought there been enough graves in Egypt that you bring us to the Red Sea my God can part any sea if he wanted to go through the Pacific Ocean right come on and make me go to Hawaii right listen 10 plagues then finally the token comes nothing happened in motion not one plague happened in the ocean protected by God Saints let's catch this little Revelation you are protected by almighty God under the blood Hallelujah Glory are we strangers to one another lady if it is raise up your hand now God delivered you raise up your hand that's a good response so now he's discerned her told her what her problem was and now he makes her confess because she has to be a living Witness sister dear we don't know each other is that right you've got a long condition is that right you're a healed sister didn't you feel that nice breeze or that presence that soft presence it's gone it's gone wasn't that what you were praying for don't you now see Elohim my I thought it was Malachi 4. I thought it was William Branham no no no no no you have to look past the Veil ah look at this Gary back there it's not Gary back there it's God and Gary back there it wasn't William Branham it was the god in William Branham so when you listen to however me however you listen to the prophet you can understand one thing for sure that that was not William random speaking don't you see Elohim God he goes God how can you doubt can't you be persistent oh my goodness it's got to happen right this very moment it's got to happen right this very moment you know God does Miracles that happens in a moment God does healing that's over time God can do whatever he wants to do he can do anything he wants to do he says now how can you doubt can't you be persistent here lady you believe God can tell me your trouble would you accept it just look at me you got it gross you believe God can tell me where that growth is it's in the intestine that's right you believe that God will heal then go as you believe so will it be ah the pastor read Hebrews 4. isn't that incredible incredible that the Holy Spirit would now have you read Hebrews 4 he's a discerner of the thought and intent of the heart is he the same yesterday today and forever but no but you want somebody to tell you or your address you know your address you want somebody to tell you your name you know your name but the word by the word is telling you who you are in the word so he came to a place of perfect faith and said if I just lay hands on you and say do you believe in Jesus name you're healed oh but I want you to tell me your name where you live God was trying to bring you into a higher faith higher faith to believe his word and be persistent my he says just can't you be persistent lady you believe God can tell me your trouble so he tells her trouble now go believing it will be as you believe now I could say the same thing to you because can I say I'm not not to get away ahead of myself but to get way ahead of myself and you've heard for years she is the final voice to the final age so then she is going to prophesy again and by prophesying she's only going to say what he said we are not prophets we're preachers and so according to the word of God the Bible says you ask you believe and you shall have what you ask and you ask not because you believe not but I want to say I'm with a group of people this morning I said I'm a needy person but I believe your word and you look you you see my faith Lord I don't want to look at the moment I want to look at the promise of God and I'm going to walk in

can I do it one more time a little louder one two three hahaha now brother Graham said the high priest will move do you believe it do you believe it the high priest will move because he's a high priest of your confession and he can't do it until you first confess it I am delivered [Music] Hallelujah this is what it's all about amen I'm looking at some Deliverance today Dave why don't you stand up for me there's a man that came to a camp Gabe tell them you're delivered there you go are you delivered amen yes sir I love his voice I may get you in the podcast room God moves When You Believe not when you doubt it's when you believe so he's the high priest of your confession did not David first prophesy before he took off Goliath's head didn't he here's David huh and here's this monster city of a man right he's got his brass head he's got his shield he's got everything but here's Little David with his little sling walking down there and says today first he spoke it [Applause] did it happen why because he's the god of our confession David said your head's coming off today you come to me with a sword and a spear devil you try to give me sickness you try to take away my health but I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah why we are living Witnesses he's a living God today Glory that's right what did I what did Isaiah say but now thus saith the Lord I created thee o Jacob I have formed thee fear not I redeemed you so now now Isaiah is talking about God forming you Jeremiah said I knew you before you were formed in your mother's womb and then a prophet picks it up and said you were always in the mind of God and he just brought your great great grandfather with your grandmother made your great-grandfather to your great great grandmother your great father great grandmother father mother mother and you that was a logistic nightmare do you know how he watched over you Civil Wars Civil War Vietnam War World War plagues come on think about it have God in his greatness watched over all your great great grandparents so that you could be here this morning if he can watch over you all away he's gonna watch [Applause] Glory tribal warfares world wars millions of deaths but no bullets could watch over your until that seed passed Glory oh I think there could be a few that could jump up and do a little bit of a dance [Applause] they'll be singing they'll be shouting no you're not Presbyterians anymore I'm Lutheran no you're not I'm not a Baptist I'm not a Lutheran I'm not a Pentecostal I'm a son and daughter of God whatever he did in the book of Acts it's me come on Stay With Me because I would like I want to get there because the Bible says I'll make you Witnesses and I will endure you with power what is the Holy Ghost it's God's life what's God's life it's called divine power then if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got divine power in you so then you've got power to put the devil under your foot anytime any place anywhere come on stay with me saints of God don't let your mind wander you take God at his word I'm not quoting you my idea I'm quoting you what a prophet says do you need to quote I'll give you the quote if you need the scripture I'll give you the scripture I've got nothing to think okay I got nothing to think I don't want Tom Ray's thinking I want the mind of God so let this mind that was in Christ be in you who thought it was not robbery to be equal with God when did Brother Brown preach that in 1964 unveiling of God Mighty God unveiled before us the Son of God is behind your Veil I get a better one than that one this is not Hey listen I had history 101 at UBC that was the most boring class I ever had and that's exactly how I'd sit there man I could not wait till it was over I have my donut and coffee but once I found Christ there was no time limit right right there was nothing all I wanted is whatever the preacher preached that's all I want Saints I don't want your thinking I don't want Tom Rays thinking it doesn't mean nothing I had no thought to think outside of this message so David prophesied first that's why I had you say it I'm going to say it one more time one two three yeah you're a little late on that one but you say it that's what he said it's unto you as you go believing so David said today your head comes off Jesus said destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up right he said it first and then he did it then of course there was John the Baptist he prophesied again and said there is one amongst you who I'm not even worthy to unlatch his shoelace and then a few days later Behold The Man Who the Lamb of the Lamb of God that taking the the of are you part of the world your sins are gone amen Let's Take God at his work every sin you ever did have done and will do the blood it reaches to the highest mountain the blood it flows to the lowest River amen so we know David prophesied then it happened Jesus prophesied then it happened John prophesied then it happened how about Abraham go go offer your son Isaac so he Journeys three days and said the lad and I shall return first speak it then it manifests okay so now what you want to do this morning you spoke it watch God manifest it it's manifesting time the fruit is on the vine and our lovely one is coming in Plainview amen for we knew in part and we prophesied in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is imparts done away when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became the bride a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then prophesying then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as I also am known God knew you would be here God knew you would be in this room he knew you would hear this little message so now he listened to the amplify here for now in this time of imperfection we see in the mirror dimly blurred reflection it's Enigma mystery puzzle but then when a time of perfection comes when the time of perfection comes we will see ourselves in reality when the bride sees who she is Christ Mr God revealed then we are raptured all right face to face now I know in part just in fragments but then I will know fully just as I've been fully known by God brother Bram says this question is announcers 1964. he says in First Corinthians 13 it says when thou which is perfect has come that which in part shall be done away so all these things jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away so when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things it doesn't put away your joy it doesn't put away your rejoicing it doesn't put away if you want to lift up your hands and the Holy Spirit takes you and you run if God wanted you to run you run if you want you to dance dance but do it by the spirit not by the flesh because we're not children anymore we're Children of the word that's what I'm saying you can take it all on one side here and be intellectual and you're dead take it all over on this side it goes into fanaticism let's marry them both together and you'll have the word of God messages praise the Lord everybody still with me okay just a second let me check I got one more hour to go [Laughter] I might take an hour and 15. if you've got your Bibles turn to first John chapter 2. first John chapter 2. so now the problem with having 17 of our people here this is part two Vine part one so you get part two you haven't heard part one yet so in November you'll get maybe part one no you won't so I haven't preached it at home so this is for you okay first John 2 verse 13. you ask me why I'm happy and I'll just tell you why well I am en you know that's what I don't get that's why I don't get I whenever the devil gets me I say devil just just remember I'm sinless huh that'll put on anybody's smile on anybody's face huh yeah I'm sinless take that one devil you might as well hey I remember when my youngest son Joel wasn't saved yet and I'd come walk in the house and sister Joanne would be ironing and she said devil I said who are you talking to talking to she said I'm talking to the devil I said okay what are you telling them you can't have my son you can't have them he's mine God given come on listen saints of God you might think I'm nuts but you might as well tell the devil if you go Wayward signs I claim my sons they're mine God gave them to me I'm under a token message I'll not leave my little ones behind not a hoof not a cattle nothing Hallelujah serious we're serious people we're sober people we're not a bunch of frivolity around here we're serious we can we can have joy and be serious I I had a couple of them moved for a few months from Germany normally when they move I know they're going back so I I I I keep I do I'm the prodder so they came to me and they said he said that you know he'll never hear this tape so I hope he says y'all he goes uh do you sell good tile here no I said we don't sell good tile here I thought so I need to get trial in Germany and fly it to Canada yeah yeah I said you do we have rotten tile here terrible okay got a good tile there you got a good tile there here I go nope we have rotten tile layers I thought so I'll have to fly him from Germany I said yeah you better and then his wife came up and she said Tom is playing with you but you find if you come from Germany everything's better in Germany I'm not picking on German I hope there's no Germans here I had there was a brother named brother Franz and he built our pulpit and uh all the young brothers that just got out of school they needed a job and he they would work for brother Franz and brother Franz he's already gone to Glory so he can't hear me and I would you know go across the border I'd get some of our our our mail and so forth across the border and I'd come back and he was living close to the border so I'd pull in and have a coffee with brother Franz he says and brother Franz was shorter than me if you can imagine and he says Tom he goes there's no good workers in Canada I go I know we have a problem he says I thought so hahaha I said Frozen if there's no good workers here why did you move here go back to Germany they're all good workers there you'll have a happy day but saints were not of Germany we're not a United States of America we're not of Canada I want you to get my point the point is this we are children of the king Hallelujah and we've been birthed by our heavenly father I have not been birthed by a man I have not been birthed by brother biscoll I've been birthed by Jesus Christ it's not a church that's gonna give you the accolades or the the minister that's going to do it it will be Jesus himself that will say Well done my faithful servant answer now into the joys of the Lord listen we had a tremendous camp we had a tremendous camp and the thing of it is we don't want to limit God because again you can go one side or the other I was telling Brother David in the back my my grandson's wife two o'clock in the morning was just a holy ghost got a hold of her she was going all over the the tent round and around eyes closed for over an hour or so just lost in God and people say well that's that's Pentecostal that's emotionalism no that's God we don't want to label to throw you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater we want God whatever form he comes and as I would say to our young people as I would say to wherever I go God now emotion is emotion but when it's God it's God so if if a young person gets they say delivered by emotion it only lasts a period of time but if you get delivered by the word it'll last forever so a word Deliverance is what we're looking for you still at First Peter two thirteen I'm writing to you fathers because you know him who has been from the beginning I'm writing unto you young man because you have overcome now I want you to notice that you have overcome not what you will overcome you have overcome the reason I'm saying that is a perfect tense and in its perfect tense it shows then it's a permanent victory now I'm not uh if anyone here knows that was my toughest class in University was English but I know what a perfect tense is and when you have a perfect tense what it's really but what it's saying is exactly what I just said it's a perfect tense that means he has delivered he is delivering he will deliver so now you have overcome is a perfect tense which gives you the picture of a permanent victory write that one in your Bible write it in your mind write it wherever you want Satan I am a permanent Victorious son and daughter of God Bible Bible I'm writing you young men because you have overcome the evil one I've written to you children because you know the father I have written unto you fathers because you know him who has from the beginning I have written into you young men because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome can you say that with me you have overcome so now here's John writing prophesying about you and me you have overcome because he's the god of the present not to go to the Past not a god of the future he's everything so now you have overcome perfect tense one more time so if you just did you know Brothers had done one place he says sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves I you know I'm not a a Greek guy I'm not a Hebrew scholar just look up the odd word it helps you and then when you look it up and you find out that in its perfect tense you have permanent victory so the only time you haven't had victories let your flesh control you whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so the only time you don't have Victory is when you let Tom Ray dictate the Inner Man so then then brother Brown say in uh the things that are to be he said now the inside man takes control of the outer man so that's the time we're living in it is a perfect tense it's a perfect verb and it's to show that it's complete your Victory is complete your Victory is finished and it's perfected uh well that's oh that's not a bad thought no that is a great thought that's one of the greatest thoughts that I've read this morning that's a great thought you said oh over to him that's a great thought no that's more than a great thought to realize in this perfect tense verb that it's an action and in that action you have overcome means that you are completely overcoming write it down I don't care write it down you know how many went to school with a big pen anybody here have big pens in the states huh and you'd write something on your hand because you we didn't have your um yeah we didn't have phone smartphones notebooks we had skin and then especially when an exam came oh that's what the answer is but this is and those things weren't worth writing down but this is worth writing down you can take first John 2 and 13. first John 2 and 14 and realize in its perfect tense form the way Paul was writing it that you have overcome it's a complete overcoming it's a finished overcoming and it's a perfect overcoming that overcome the squat describes the quality it goes on in the Greek to say this that overcome describes the quality of a true saint just say true saint I'm interesting don't get bound up as soon as I said now it's the quality of a true saint then you start looking at yourself again well I don't think I'm a true Saint who said that the devil said that your flesh said that the Bible never said that so why would you want to think anything other than the Bible so the Bible says this he says you are a true Saint you may stumble you may fall but God always say it God always picks you up [Music] Hallelujah I Stumble I fall but God rich in Mercy lifts you up Glory my favorite preacher won't be there my favorite brother won't be there but God will be there and that's normally when you stumble when there's nobody around you but then you get up you shake yourself off and God picked you up hahaha all right take it take it devil thank you it describes the quality of a true saint you may stumble you may fall but God always picks his feed up so it's onward come on let's go onward so it's onward and upward upward Christian Soldiers ah you've been used to onward I just helped you change the new make a new course upward Christian soldiers were re-marching as to war through the blood of Jesus going on before we're going upward Saints not only onward we're going upward amen you want to turn to John 16 verse 33. it won't be much longer John you got and say Amen when you're there Saint John 16 verse 33. can we read it together please these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world but I Hallelujah Glory at that day you will know that I'm in the Father the father's in me I in you and you and me be of good cheer I have overcome the world Hallelujah I have overcome the world don't get discouraged and don't lose faith take God at his word and live joyfully Glory live joyfully don't try and be super spiritual people you know I Gotta Be You know I gotta do this and I gotta do that you gotta do nothing you tell me what you had to do about your new birth tell me you had nothing to do with it he picked you up he took you to the Cross he washed you by the blood he redeemed you purchase you wash you and brought you to himself which is this message [Applause] Hallelujah he brought you to this message Glory think about it how many churches did you go to how many I don't know about you but I butt my head in a lot of churches I you know you don't probably don't even know what Harry Christian is you know the flowing robes and the burning incense and the bald heads I couldn't go that far and then you try you know then you you go to university take philosophy of religion courses you take all these courses and it means nothing I looked at an old paper a plus whatever that is what's an eight plus four point how do you get higher than a 4.0 and I read that piece of paper and I just said garbage that was me that wrote it and I said they accepted this nonsense crazy stuff and those are the people that are running the world that's even crazier but then Jesus came this message came to lift you up people put so much into education it's nonsense they're putting queers in your classrooms they're putting homosexuals drag queens that's what their education is doing but this education is going to put you in a rapture uh-huh [Applause] yeah they they might come in here you're not woke enough I hate I woke up the day that an angel got me huh brother Brown said about that prodigal son right yes there he was in the pig pen hello we were in the pig pen but then he said an angel came by yes and he and he pray and he just poked them said wake up boy go back to your father and that's what happened to you and I an angel came by your way poke you and brought us back to our Heavenly Father you are living testimonies Jordan has to open so that you can manifest death had to roll back so that life would come forth and what am I seeing I'm seeing heaven in his people again Hallelujah Hallelujah I Got Heaven on my mind and I'm feeling mighty fine I Got Heaven you don't know the song but we got evidence you know that's all I got on my mind all this nonsense this you know rainbows and unicorns you know is that the silliness you know I gotta have some perverted guy come in to teach my great my grandchildren they come into our school boy it wouldn't last long you're a bigot well I guess I am but that one thing I don't understand we can't say anything against them but they can say a lot about us I thought this was freedom of America huh hey we lost a long time ago but when we met Jesus [Applause] I am free Glory amen so then first John says these things have I spoken unto you that you might have peace in the world peace I said Peace oh people are looking for peace you found peace he's the king of peace Hallelujah quesadek come on Saints we live in another realm these people don't know don't get down into their Realm don't you dare get into their Realm they'll feed it on the news you know people that were against it are now holding it up and and and and now you come against it just because you don't believe in it they want to lock you up it's a day when they call that which is good evil and that which is evil good we might as well realize we're living in that day and we can scream out this day that scripture is being fulfilled and and if I was a young couple and I had little children right now I'd be finding myself on my knees more than you ever have in your whole entire life because they're coming after your children I want that to sink in they are coming after your children no different than Pharaoh no different than Herod that demon power once your children and I rebuke it and I want you to rebuke it not in your head in your lips Satan I rebuke you you are not having my children I claim them in the name of Jesus Christ and oh Lord I know you fellas saying well I'm not married yet now Bill listen listen how fast it's happened when I was in first year university 1972 where they had a homosexual meeting at our University at and I went to it a bunch of us guys us long-haired end of the hippie part people whoever we were we're still trying to figure out who we were and we show up you know how many people were there a half a dozen and we went there to Malcolm that's what we were unfortunate well I was a mock anyways now it's gone from 1972 to 2023 and they're running the show you got the Rainbow on the White House that's a shame when Russia has a higher standard than America I know I'm gonna I'm flying out tomorrow so I told you I'm not American I clarified that one a long time ago I'm not Canadian I'm not American I'm from another kingdom right what an abomination that they show the rainbow color on the White House and proud of it and then we preach the unadulterated word of God and they want to shut you down they can't shut us down no it's onward and upward amen and as I said as this goes on how fast it is moving we used to go down the streets of Vancouver I told my boys I told my boys I said boys when I say God has saved me from the gutter I'm going to show you what the gutter was so I took them in the cars this was a array field trip Friday night seven o'clock terrible time to go downtown so we get down in in the back alleys of Vancouver and all of a sudden my wife is pushing every lock button in the car hands feet everything else is going on she says honey we got to get out of here I said I just just for boys to see so then I got scared and I said let's go and if that was in the 70s you go down that that that used to be like a maybe a city block now it's blocks upon blocks upon blocks sin has moved in but so has Heaven and brother Rams at one place don't always speak about how evil it's getting speak about how powerful [Applause] how powerful she's getting I knew in part now I know then which is perfect is come God has given us a perfect message for a perfect people to get us to a perfect place for a perfect rapture amen God bless you and may you be living Witnesses that this message is true God bless you [Applause] man I want him to preach more I want to hear it amen I want to believe it I want the revelation of it amen I want it to strike Me Prophet God says you know when it strikes you you know when it's real you know with the pastor the hard part is is that you party of your nature is you'll never leave the one behind right you know when the 99's rejoicing I'm sitting here saying is there somebody that's not right in the flop you know what I mean is there somebody there that doesn't have what we're talking about I can't help that you know that God made me that way and you know so when I I you know I don't want to shout and run around the building and jump up and down and praise God with somebody sitting there with their head down because they're broken-hearted I can't do that you know so don't don't ever misunderstand me that but it's just that when you've come where I've come from you know what he can do for somebody and you just don't want to see somebody sitting outside of that and I thought when Tom was preaching I thought you know really how simple it is you just gotta walk away he'll catch you you know what I mean I know they tell a kind of is a a a joke or a kind of a a little story about the man that drove his car off the cliff and if he jumped out and he grabbed a hold of a limb and he cried out to the Lord Lord help me Lord help me if you know come save me come save me and he's just hanging onto that limb for all his life and finally the Lord said let go you know let go put your life in his hands just let go he'll catch you amen he won't leave you but we always want to navigate our own way we want to plot our salvation we want to plot tomorrow we want to figure out how am I going to get delivered what do I have to do to get delivered and you know sometimes it's just so simple they'll just walk away from where you are just Lord this is where I am I I rejoice in what the brother Tom says I believe everything about it it's all real but I've got that part of me that is I know it's just that negative reality you know what I mean in that'll try to get you all the days of your life you know what I mean the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh but identify yourself is that me or is what his spoken of me me is is the Victory and the power and the the life and and the joy and the peace is that me or is the the sin that the things that I'm doing that's not right is this me you know the beauty of it you see both of them you see them both they're they're with you now in your heart which one do you choose which one do you choose I'm going to walk away from this right right I'm going to walk away from the negativity I'm going to walk away from from the nonsense I'm doing I'm gonna walk away from the games I'm gonna walk away from the cultures I'm going to walk away from the negativity I'm gonna pick up this book I'm gonna start reading it I'm going to start following it I'm going to start believing it I'm going to believe everything that it says this is telling me what I am amen this other person came from from sin amen that was the person I was born into but that is not going to rule over me goodbye goodbye I'm walking away you say well I gotta have a plan he's got a plan that's what's beautiful I will lead you and I will guide you into all truth and righteousness are you ready to leave all that stuff behind amen just leave it behind and say you know something I've done it long enough I've fought this battle in my mind long enough today I'm going to surrender Lord Jesus come take my life Lord everybody talks about the baptism of the Holy Spirit I nobody will know whether you've got it or not it's a personal the baptism of the holy spirit is the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you where you know he's got you you know he's got you and I love when Tom said about falling down he picked you up I'm telling you I can testify to that I've fallen many times but he's never left me in nor forsake me if his companies cuddled me he's put his his arms around me and he won't leave me amen I can't get away amen and the worst part about it is you can either so you might as well surrender you might as well just say I'm done with it if you say boy that's I want a religious ceremony no you're not getting a religious ceremony all you have to do is say I'm done I'm done watching it I'm done playing it I'm done thanking it I'm done it has no control over me it has no power over me Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you love them all right man let's Stand Together I want to sing I like this song he's the only God what's the name of that song

won't be able to hear preaching like that but not everybody's made like that but we love you those that are traveling home may the Lord go with you and be with you [Music] How great is our God great nothing he can't do nothing he can't say from nothing he can't fix [Music] no marriage you can't restore no matter how wrecked no disease he can heal no matter how fatal no sin he can't forgive truth

forsake you don't sell them short and have what you asked for all things are possible only believe let's bow our heads our gracious father our brother spoke just this morning about what are we witnessing what God are we showing the world where is our identity lied does our identity lie in the negativity of this world that surround us or does our identity a lie in a God that can do all things [Music] and Lord if I failed you and let my candle grow dim I asked this morning Lord that you would trim my Wick that you'd set my heart aflame that I wouldn't be ashamed of all that you've done for me [Music] Lord and you said if I would confess you before men not just with my lips but with my life that I would show that there's a great hope that lives Within Me there's a great peace that has come across my soul there's a great joy that is even unspeakable because I've met the king of kings the Lord of lords The Giver of Life [Music] a present help in the time of trouble the all-powerful and Almighty creator [Music] and he cast his love towards me and he gave his only begotten son to be my kinsman redeemer Lord let that testimony live in me this morning so I walk out these doors I know in my own heart whether I've been living the caliber of life that I know to live but I'm asking you father that I can walk away from the old ways and the old man and I can walk in the newness of life this morning Lord and it's by Your Grace it's by your mercy and I implore father once more for the people for all of us here father that you once more in your great kindness which shed that mercy and Grace upon us renew our Spirits father and strengthen our resolve as the scripture says father may we ever stand true to our profession this morning and go with us we pray in Jesus precious and wonderful name we ask these things amen and amen amen God bless you I hate for services to end but we got to do it can we do God God is good and God's good God bless you if you want to go in the building please feel free and and if I don't get a chance to see everybody I love the prophecy that Tom spoke for all my little brides that have gone away he said they'd return home so mail that tape out oh my I you know God's got us where he wants life goes on May this bride spread across the world because we know one day we're all going to be together again hey man let's sing if you
