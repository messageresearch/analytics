in the house of god amen it's good to be gathered in his presence all our visitors will welcome you this morning god bless you amen [Music] good morning let's just bow our heads and commit the service to the lord that he would have his way this morning we trust that he's here among us father we love you and we thank you father for this opportunity once again to be gathered together unto your name lord we're so grateful to have the opportunity together with fellow believers lord those who of like precious faith who share our love for you and for your word lord so we lift our hearts and our minds and our words together father to commit this service to you we ask for you lord that you would reign in this service that lord there would be nothing that would hinder the delivery of your word and the working of your word in our midst father we invite you to have the freedom to work with hearts lord to speak which should have us here lord we sit here to learn of you lord we pray that what happens here might be pleasing to you that this would not be lord something that would bring glory to man but that you would be glorified in all things and lord we take control of any spirit that's in this place that would hinder your working and we pray that the holy ghost and your word would rule in all things we pray that every need would be met and lord that everyone would hear from you as we committed to you in jesus name amen well good morning we're gonna go ahead and read our psalm for the day welcome to all of our visitors i see a lot of new faces here this morning we uh we've been really reading little portions of psalm 119 together and you know just sharing some of the things that you know stick out to us in the scriptures as we do that we're going to go ahead and turn to psalm 119 and read that portion that begins in verse 49 and you know as i was reading this there's an interesting the the section begins with an interesting statement which kind of caught my attention you know how it is you'll read a passage of scripture and just kind of casually read it for years and all of a sudden it'll catch your attention when you read it and that's what happened to me with verse 49 it says this it says remember the word unto thy servant and the thought occurred to me as i was reading that did did the lord forget what are we asking for him to remember his word you know as you go through the scriptures there are times when you know people call on the lord for the lord to remember something and that would be an interesting study to do one time is the things that the lord remembers and the things that the lord remembers not but there are times when people will call on the lord to remember me or to remember someone else or to remember not my sin and my iniquity remember your tender mercies but there's just a few times in the scriptures where someone calls out to the lord and asks for him to remember his own word and there are times in the scriptures where the lord speaks up and says that he did something and he remembered his word concerning something and you know as i was thinking about that you know there were times when people called out to the lord just a handful of times where remember your word moses did that he called out on the lord for the children of israel and said remember your word your covenant concerning this people and it stayed the plague to stay the judgment there was a time when nehemiah he called out to the lord and said remember your word concerning this people and after 70 years of bondage the lord moved on hearts of kings and caused them to enter back into their land but as i was thinking about that there was a portion of scripture that stuck out to me in exodus chapter 2 and it was in the time of the exodus where it says that the lord remembered his own word and the question is this did he forget did he need a reminder of what his word had said and it's in exodus 2 verse 24 it's speaking of the children of israel that were in captivity in egypt and it said and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and then we begin to see the hand of the lord move on their behalf and he said this of himself in exodus 6 5 the same thing but the question is daddy forgotten had he been off doing something else and all of a sudden he heard of people pray it's like oh yeah i remember about those people i need to go see what they're up to you know it's uh did he need a reminder you know there are you'll find no there are many times in the scripture where the where he says lord where it says lord remember me or forget not but at no point in the scripture does it say that he actually forgot his own word so if he never actually forgot his word what actually are we asking for him to remember you know it's interesting if you read this section in exodus 2 it's you know the children of israel had been in bondage for 390 years but it wasn't until after moses had been born raised fled egypt and gone into midian that they began to call on the name of the lord so for 390 years they dwelt in this condition and they were just trying to stay comfortable coping living with the bondage compromising but then it wasn't until 390 years that their voice began to change that that fourth generation rose up and began to cry out with a cry of affliction when previously it had been a cry of coping of compromise there was a different sound coming out of the people it says in exodus 2 25 that they all the sudden god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them this isn't a situation where all of a sudden he remembered a people that he forgot but it was a situation where now he was hearing something from a people that reminded him of his own word the sound the reflection from the people changed it's kind of like when you look at somebody that you know might walk on the round in the crowd and say boy that person reminds me of someone remembering someone that you know in the image that you see in someone else you know when when david is calling out to the lord asking for him to remember the word concerning his servant this isn't about him asking the lords to remember a long forgotten word concerning him but the prayer my prayer would be lord when you look at me may i remind you of your own word may you remember your own word because of what you see coming from me and when i think about us when i think about it this is we read this this morning in psalm 119 i pray that that would be our prayer that lord this is not about you remembering some long forgotten word it's so often we get an affliction we have a burden we have a need we have a trial we all do it lord have you forgotten me lord remember your word he hasn't forgotten his word he's waiting to see his word reflected because when the word that he spoke matches the word that he sees now you can ask anything in my name you know what it says in verse 50 is we're going to read this in psalm 119 this is my comfort and my affliction for thy word has quickened me you know when his word goes forth concerning anything it's a quickener and it begins a work in the one for whom the word is intended so that it begins to reflect the image that is going to be fulfilled so as we read psalm 119 this morning this passage let's just may that be our prayer lord may your word be reflected in me may you see a reminder of your own word in me so let's read that this morning psalm 119 verse 49 to 56 we'll read that together remember the word unto thy servant upon which thou hast caused me to hold this is my comfort in my affliction for thy word hath quickened me the proud have had me greatly in derision yet have i not declined from thy law i remembered thy judgments of old o lord and have comforted myself horror would have taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage i have remembered thy name o lord in the night and have kept thy lord this i had because i kept thy precept amen god bless you and have your seats i mean i'd sing at calvary this morning amen [Music]

together this morning and uh and it's a wedding that's gonna bring us all together again amen and so we're really looking towards that it's wonderful when you can come together with people from different parts of the country in different places and know that you have that kindred spirit that you know you have the same word it truly lets you know he's the same yesterday today and forever i don't think there's a people like i've said many times we're not a religion we're a people we're an elected people that come from a father and so we're we're not different in any way we're all the same purchased with the same blood and it's just wonderful to have that unity and and to know that the gospel is certainly the same amen it's nice to be here with brother ron today is you know brother when i came out of my egypt brother ron came out of my egypt with me and i always appreciate of that and it's hard to believe that i guess it's what 50 years now run 20 72 that now 50 years yeah 50 years that's a long time we're selling celebrating our 50th truly so that truly shows you that all things are possible amen if we could come from where we came and uh to where that we are today but uh there's we're sister sandy and sister sandy would you stand up wherever you are [Applause] sister sandy's a great part of all of it and it's nice to have her with us here here today and and you know it's great to be in anticipation of god's word and and to be able to understand that we're not getting farther apart we're getting closer together i think there's a desire amongst the bride now to to get everything that's in between us out of the way to have our heart and our focus on one thing only and that's him to be totally brought into remembrance of the love that he expressed for us when he laid that life down at calvary and he gave us a place that we can meet him and that we can all be equal and so the word is simply applied to all of our hearts this morning i'm glad to come to church this morning i'm glad to sit under the word of god this morning and let the word of god prick my heart if it would prick my heart encourage me speak to me give me revelation to go forward give me i sav that i might see and it's a wonderful time so i i'm anxious to for what the lord's laid in our brother's heart i i love them the lord's put us in different paths in different parts of the country but we serve the same god for the same purpose and that's to make a resurrection so i'm so thankful for the opportunity that we could have this fellowship together this morning so let's stand this morning together as we prepare for the word of god let's just wash our our minds from everything and just for the next hour hour and a half whatever the lord would have for us that we just intensely listen and let the lord seep into us and speak to us and i think we'll all come from here better per people with a greater revelation of what our goal is in life so let's sing that great song amazing grace this morning as we invite our brother to come speak us it's by grace that we're here it's by grace that he found us in california [Music] is by grace that he's led us and brought us here this morning and here we are it doesn't matter what tomorrow was it's what today is and what tomorrow holds so let's sing this as we invite our brother [Music] oh wasn't that sweet [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] [Music] my [Music] thank you [Music] oh let's sing that last verse when we've been there [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] to see [Music] [Applause] praise god praise god is god [Music] [Music] amen let's just bow our heads together heavenly father as we come to you this morning we bring all our needs our petitions to you knowing that you're a mighty god your jehovah jireh [Music] you provide all of our needs father and so we bring our petitions our needs our prayers may they rise up before you as a sweet smelling savor this morning and i would pray heavenly father that you would let your word have preeminence in our lives this morning we've come to learn of you to know your ways and so we ask father for divine intervention once again come and move upon these mortal beings that we might know where we come from and where we're going we thank you i pray a blessing upon each and every one i ask now father that you just let your spirit rest upon your servant this morning and use me for your glory to bless your people for the furtherance of your kingdom we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you all this morning thank you musicians each and every one of you he greets you in the lovely name of jesus christ it's a special blessing to be here with you all today amen i don't know how long ago it was that we were here last but it's been a while and even brother david and i with our great analytical minds we still couldn't figure out exactly what it was but it was a long time ago and god by his grace has seen fit to keep us all these years you know brother david and i started in the message together back on california beaches of san diego and god has kept us up to this time we had a lovely wedding on friday that was that was the reason that we came out here and that was special and and david said it also there's another wedding that we're going to and that's what's brought us all together here is there's a greater wedding that's to take place and um i want to thank brother david and sister leslie for their hospitality their christian kindness to us uh making us just feel so welcome here and just being like family with them and um also brother matt mcgarry and sister gabby their family opened their home yesterday and fed us and we certainly appreciate that let's just turn directly to the word of god if you all would please the book of deuteronomy deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 33 through 36. hallelujah deuteronomy 4 verses 33 and 37 through 36. did ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou has heard and live or hath god assad to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by temptations and by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm by the great tears according to all the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes unto thee it was showed that that thou mightest know that the lord he is god and there is none else beside him out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice no deposit no return unless you got to see to god inside of you no man can come except my father drawing out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon earth he showed thee his great fire and thou heardest his words out of the midst of fire heavenly father now that we have read thy word o god i would ask a special anointing upon this our service today quicken us lord by your word and by your holy spirit lord i pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you you all may be seated in the presence of the lord the bible says that our god is a consuming fire and he baptizes with fire his ministers are as flames of fire and this message was vindicated by a pillar of fire the bible says that we ought to fear god and give him reverence for our god is a consuming fire i would like to title my sermon this morning quickened by the voice i'd like to take a subject of the voice of god has quickening power turn with me to one other portion of scripture so that we could just complete our reading of the word here together john chapter 5 verses 24 through 29 john 5 24. verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that hath sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is past from death unto life verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and them that hear shall live for as the father has life in himself so he hath given to the son to have life in himself and have given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth and they that have done good under the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation may god bless his word today the bible says that let him that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the church we realize that god has got a voice and that it is in due season you've got to recognize the word of god for your day in your hour that's what's brought us all together god sent a voice by the way of a vindicated prophet in this last day and that is what has gathered you i want you to understand that no man did this it was god that did it it didn't matter if you were in africa or in india or down in mexico or here in america he that hath an ear is going to hear what god says in this day and when that voice of god speaks it will quicken and energize the seed amen amen brother brenham says in the fourth seal when the real true sincere predestinated believer somebody say that's me yeah that's you when that light strikes upon that seed something burst forth to a new life little did david mcgary and i understand that when we came across or should i say the message came across our path a bunch of hippies and just kids and little did we know we were together i'll just tell you one little story this is not a this is not going to burn david type thing no but i tell you we uh we were listening to tapes in california there and one of the brothers gave my brother and i and brother mitch buckingham a list of the tapes and we looked at it and i tell you you got 11 1200 sermons oh my and you're a new believer and you're looking at this and you've got limited financial money you know and so you you have to be very selective so we went down you know tape by tape and looking oh yeah yeah uh the church in this condition let's get that one oh yeah how about this one over here uh yeah we'll get that um the great harlot and we'll get oh hey we have to get this one choosing a bride young man we weren't married yeah we won't hear what prophet god said about choosing a bride man and we're just a bunch of you know california kids and we're sitting there listening to his kentucky waves and his hillbilly uh viewpoint of that and he said now he said i met a guy and he said he had a heifer out in the field and he said you got to go look that heifer in the eye said she got that wild stare he said you he said don't you buy that heifer and he said now if you're going to look for a wife he said you better look that heifer in the eye and we're all laughing word is having a big day because she'll never be a mama to a cat and we're just sitting there and having a good time and listening to his mannerisms and stuff and then at the end of the tape you all know he says now i've tried to leave the pulpit three or four times he said the steering wheel is out of my hand oh capernaum capernaum and when we heard that i'll tell you all of the people there listening to that tape we all fell on our faces before god oh god we didn't know judgment striking the west coast oh my we didn't know if god would even give us time to get out of california just within weeks the people all of the group there we started leaving california that's how much we believe this message [Music] that's why uh people ask me you know um well brother ron you know you do you believe all that he said i said i do as a young man had a four year scholarship san diego state university marine biology and the first year i hear the prophet's message you know what i gave it all up when we hear that judgment striking the west coast we don't know what to do and uh but we knew we had to get out of there i still believe it amen i've got aunts uncles and cousins and nephews and everybody over there in california and i could go over there have a big vacation go to disneyland do all this kind of stuff and not have to spend any money but gas just to get there i still don't go there now there's been times i've gone in and now but i tell you what i'm real nervous i took one brother with me one time he'd never been to the he never seen the pacific ocean and so we were dropping down into san bernardino going across that that fault san andreas fault and i told him i said hey see that fault line over there and there's people that take cans of spray paint and they they paint a line down like you go come back a year or two later and it's already moved that shows the land was shifting anyway went down to huntington beach but down there he'd never seen the pacific ocean he's never seen waves come up and waves go back and anybody that's never done that of course the wave uh come up and he oh yeah oh that's nice so he's wanting to touch it so now it's starting to reseed back out so he follows it out about 50 feet and all of a sudden it comes back in and and so anyway here he is in his cowboy boots and everything and he he's going oh wow this is so wow and if any of you know and you stand in the ocean what what do you feel when the water recedes back out do you feel like you're sinking well all of a sudden he's he's there enjoying the like this all of a sudden he goes it's sinking he runs out of the water here's hundreds of people on the beach right my brother-in-law who's there he's looking at me like who is this guy this shade game well it didn't sink that that day but it will soon brother branham said there is a quickening power to the word of god when you hear his voice the light penetrates the darkness and and all the doubt and unbelief goes away it'll quicken to life that predestinated seed amen but you have to recognize your day and its message we are not worshiping the messenger we love him and we certainly give him preeminence but i tell you we do not worship the messenger we worship jesus christ this message caused me to fall in love with jesus christ this message is christ just as the angel refused john to worship him neither would the messenger of today take any credit for even the message he was delivering in the anointed ones at the end time you that listen to this tape you might have thought today i was trying to say that about myself being i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of the father that i declare to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these sayings and happens as perfect as they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it wasn't it was i just surrendered myself to him and he spoke through it isn't me it isn't the seventh angel oh no it's a manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ and he's the only one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man somebody say hallelujah you are not feeding on a man his his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man hallelujah amen brother david and i we started this message together early as young men and we were talking yesterday in fellowshipping and really brother david what has kept us together on this message is we began to see something that others didn't something greater something more than church order we began to see the unfolding and revealing of the son of man hallelujah prophets are always representatives of the mouthpiece of god god uses them to speak to his people god speaks through a prophet in revelations 10 a very familiar portion of scripture verse 7 through 11 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel didn't say in the days of his life said in the days of his voice brother ram said not when he began to speak but when he began to unfold the word and when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and i went under the angel said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again for many peoples and nations and tongues and kings i want you to notice that it was after the angel messenger had finished his message it was after the mystery of god was finished that the voice spoke to john john who is a type of the bride take the book take that revealed word and need it what good are tapes and books if you don't take them into you what is what is horrible is to have someone die in a grocery store die of hunger why wouldn't they take the food off the shelf and eat it why do people just collect the tapes and books and don't read them take them down take that book and eat it john was obedient took it and ate it up he didn't just say collect tapes and books or just distribute tapes and books or to just agree with it but to take it you need it you know when you take something and you eat it you assimilate it into yourself and whatever you were eating you become thou must prophesy see not the angel on the earth thou must prophesy revelations 10 1 the mighty angel anointed revelations 10 7. and revelations 10 7 anointed revelations 10 8 take the book and eat it do you see the order of the condescending of god you're a part of this my brother and sister thou must prophesy so now the voice of god is in the bride she is the final voice to the final age in the laodicean church age brother branham says page 340 a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again a pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not the simple word they could no longer speak for god for when god sent wesley he was the voice with the word in his day and the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation and when the method is failed god raised up by others and so it has gone on down through the years until this last day there is again another people in the land hallelujah who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age when god speaks things happen i want you to just think that everything that god has ever done he quickened with his voice brother branham said he could have thought about things for eons of time but until his mouth spoke it because the spoken word is the original seed and so the thought now came down from the womb of his mind and then god spoken and he said let there be light see there could not be light until he spoke it he quickened the sun with his very creative words let there be light and there was light everything that god did he has quickened with his voice is it any different today that if god were to send a voice a messenger that he would quicken you you weren't quickened by william branham you weren't quickened by your pastors you weren't quickened by people around you you're quickened by god himself hallelujah everything that god does he quickens with his voice everything john 15 16 and you have not chosen me i've chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you god's will only quickens that which is ordained to life the prophet of god says watch i can show you many times through the scriptures he says that if there is an elect seed he said the spirit of god will be directed to that elect seed and the others won't catch it he said the woman at the well for example there she was shrouded with doubts and unbelief and false teachings give me to drink it's not customary that you should ask of me to give you a drink and he says if you knew who it was you would ask him to give you living water it wasn't until she asked finally she said give me this water and the very reason she went to the well she left her water pot and ran into the city that's why your whole life changes i tell you coming across the god of this message is a life-changing experience hallelujah acts chapter 13 verse 48 when the gentiles heard this they were glad glorified the word of the lord for as many as were ordained somebody say ordained as many as we're ordained to eternal life believed you don't persuade anybody into this you don't talk them into it if they're like seed you just preach truth where did you get this huh wow i've never heard anyone speak where'd you get this knowledge hallelujah you were ordained to hear the voice of god brother branham preaches 14 sermons by taking the the scripture of exodus chapter 23 verses 20 through 24. behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then will i be an enemy to under thine enemies and an adversary into thine enemy adversaries for mine angels shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites and the hittites and the parasites and the canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and all of the other parasites and i will cut them off thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images brother branham uses this sermon this scripture excuse me in over 14 sermons every time he is emphasizing that god sending a messenger and says to emphasize to obey his voice listen carefully when god sends a prophet among you when it speaks it's the same as god speaking there is always a voice representation on the earth since eden god's always had a believer somewhere that he could use as his voice and when the prophet left the scene god was already raising up other ones it wasn't just a singular but a many-membered body just as john was commanded to take the book of redemption and eat it up and after he partake of the message or that revealed word of the hour it was his turn to speak revelations 22 verse 17 says the spirit and the bride so notice what the spirit is saying the bride will be saying the same thing the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come and let him that a thirst come and whosoever will let him take you the water of life freely give you a personal testimony i had a friend of mine he was hunting with brother branham they were up in colorado they were sitting around the campfire just a few of the brothers and he says you know the bible says let whosoever will let him come he said but it's not they all raised their eyebrows but he said that's what the word says he says no man can come except the father calls him first do you see we've got to have a full balance on the word of god i thank god that this message has given us a balance huh hallelujah brother branham says in the true easter seal notice as soon as the voice of abel was silent and death god raised up seth to take his place god kept his voice alive with the prophets they spoke the word of god and they stoned them and as soon as the they would stone one and put him away god had raised up another one and down through the ages he kept his voice alive before the people all the way from eden brother brennan preached a sermon called the voice of god in phoenix he says when you hear my voice harden not your heart as in the days of provocation now is the time and this is the acceptable time that if any man will hear my voice that goes to show that his voice would still be there in the midst of all the chaos he's still got a voice why his voice will ever remain here it is heavens and earth will pass away but my voice shall not pass away his word amen ezekiel says 43 verse 2 and behold the glory of the god of israel came in the way of the east and his voice was like the noise of many waters sound of many waters i was in kinshasa congo any of you know where that place is at we were there and there was thousands i don't know how many thousands we had there and he said let's just all pray as a congregation and as they began to pray in the whole congregate thousands of voices raised up and i have a video of it and it sounds like the cataract of a waterfall the sound of many waters do you understand that when you raise your voice and you speak your voice and that voice joins this voice and this voice and this voice pretty soon it's the sound of many waters thank you lord thou hast many waters all over the world in every country amen voices of many waters patmos vision brother bram said what does waters represent what is his voice it's a judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many waters cried out thickness and multitudes the voice of those seven stars in his hand to every church age preaching the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues the power of god the resurrection of christ the second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters coming forth from this one that looked like the son of man many waters you see it it is a antichrist spirit that wants to silence the voice of god do you know that the false church has a voice also the voice of politics voices of voting in and voting out the voice of religion and denomination that is the voice of education the voice of church theology we picked that up in the book of acts chapter 12. i'm trying to work my computer here and i'm not good at this so let me see here hold on oh okay it's not i don't use one at the pulpit normally i print it out but i didn't have time to print it out in acts chapter 12 verses 21 and 24 and upon a set day herod a roid arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them and he gave the and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of man and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost but the word of god grew and multiplied notice it said it was the voice of a god not the voice of god how many people make a godlike man their image false prophets movie stars idols all of these athletes so much are called the voice of god today that it cause causes confusion in the sermon voice of god 1963 god has promised to meet the need of the hour he always does it we need the voice of god today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time we're living in and after he promised it we can rest assured he'll keep his promise and today one reason that the church is in the condition that it's in is because there's so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of god until it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of god though it spoke right in their midst there's perhaps they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it's a foreign thing to them they have got themselves so many centered around the voices of the day the voice of god became foreign to them why because there were so many other voices and then if god promised he would give us that and if other voices are contrary to the voice of god then it must be the voice of the enemy to try to confuse us we must not understand that we excuse me that we would not understand the voice of god when it was spoke so many voices in the earth today absolutely hard thing because it deadens the voice of god of the supernatural so many intellectual voices you know it's amazing how people can try to think they're so spiritual because they got something so intellectual i remember at a meeting one time hundreds of people's there there was a brother preaching and i'll tell you what you know i'm not the most spiritual guy in the world but when he got done it was still a mystery he preached this mystery in that mystery and it still was a mystery now when you hear the prophet speak it never remains a mystery no you catch the you catch something you see something hallelujah god questions it to you but what's amazing how many people get one another spirit and if if you know like he did this now watch this i want all of you be real spiritual now i want you to catch this all the people sitting there like this oh now if you're spiritual you catches no no no you didn't get it are you spiritual listen watch they didn't get it either but when i was there somebody went hallelujah another one oh glory to god and i went to him after what what does this mean you see sometimes you can try to get so spiritual talk above the people i don't believe you ever have the gospel it should ever be above the people it should be down where they live the bible said even a wafering man would understand it not some intellectual something about you know some big thing in the sky and over here and this mystery that mystery and it's still a mystery and people go well praise god wasn't that a good service it was so deep i never even got it you gotta be kidding me just stay simple brother branham said in the unchangeable god how many of you believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever god don't change now watch his prophet say this well now he has no hands on earth but mine and yours his voice on earth is ours our voice is given to him that's why we preach the gospel we believe it's not us we're inspired to preach those things but the holy spirit is speaking through us amen god always has a way of making his voice known to the people he sends prophets he gives them signs takes his voice and that's been spoken on before on his word and vindicates it by this man and they know that it's his voice because it's a promised word of the day amen all of you my brother and sister that are here i trust if your predestinated seed you have been quickened energized activated manifested in this hour if you say that you believe the message of the hour let me see it in your life your revelation must give manifestation amen tell me that you believe this message and still cut your hair brother brown said that that one pastor introduced his wife to brother branham said she's a real saint and he says i looked at her and said she looks more like a hain because she ain't got it you remember that one lady up there where that highfalutin lady put her hand up there gave it to brother brown well how do you do brother abraham said bring it on down here if you want me to shake it i love that this message is real it's not above us it's right here where we live amen you have been quickened by the voice of god it's caused you to raise up and it's had an effect upon you brother david would you have ever thought that what we came across would change our lives and make us leave california and leave everything behind us who would have ever thought just a bunch of young kids but when we got a hold of this there's something about seeing others that you've met before but there's nothing like old friends amen and nothing like old friends brother david and i we hug next just before i came out he said i love you brother ron i said i love you brother david all of a sudden i was transported back man to a young man that heard this message see nobody convinced us nobody talked us into it oh i'll tell you what we'd come we'd come to meetings we're just playing tapes we don't know nothing about going to church or preachers or anything we just come and we play a tape and when we hear what he said we just believed it he said long hair on a man uh you know as wrong as perverted and those of us that sat there with our long hair wow i remember going and i had hair long hair and nobody no no nobody none of the believers told me cut my hair so one day i walk in by the mirror and i see my long hair and i thought i need to i need to cut my hair so anyway i got my hair cut went to the meeting later that day and guess what i went in and shook everybody's hand i walked by everybody nobody said nothing nobody and so i turned it i had audacity enough i turned the tape off i said isn't anyone going to congratulate me that i cut my hair no we expected now shut up and turn the tape back on you don't listen if you take everything away from everybody they'll resent you but if they give it to god it's a different story god has called you to this message not to just listen to it but to obey it to believe it to assimilate it into your life that the word of god did not just stay on a tape but that tape was assimilated into a multi-membered body called the mystical body of jesus christ and here we are look at you you are sermons in living epistles the world looks at you and they can't understand you why because god is a mystery so lying within each one of you is a part of the mystery of god that must make itself manifest amen wow i'm done i have something on my heart for you tonight that i'd like to share with you but i i didn't feel good last night i've been very very sick if i'd have been home i'd have gone to the hospital so i wrestled oh god sandy woke me up she said are you are you gonna preach i said yep so any of you know what diverticulitis is i had a real real bad bout of it last night and i i tell you i just tossed and turned and moaned and groaned all night and i couldn't do it to my friend david and tell him that hey i i can't preach this morning and so i daresome eat anything everything is any of you know anything about it so i'm sorry brother david i've kind of cut it a little bit short this morning but god knows and i'm sweating inside of my coat right now beads of sweat just going down my back because i've had chills and different things and so i apologize for that i would have loved to have preached a couple of like your like your past he probably two three hours he just no anyway i do love god and i love this message i've been a fool for christ ever since i came into this message amen i have been even the brothers have brought me to the message and i remember and i'm just gonna close with a couple little testimonies here i remember some of the brothers that brought me to the message they told me brother ron you know the beatles are in the bible the beatles in the bible yeah they are you know what's another word for beetle locust oh in the book of revelation locust and they got breastplates of iron that's their guitar they sound like roaring lions yeah yeah yeah right and they got stinging their tail and the sound of thundering chariot [Music] i'm going wow that's the most fire the beatles are in the bible but then when i found out when brother i found out what brother brenham said about the locust and he never said the beatles are in the butt so i went to the brothers i said that ain't in the bible well it's not even in the message yeah well it's far out man and and i said what yeah it just blows people's mind and i tell them stuff like and i said well we're not here to blow people's mind excuse me that's our old drug terminology you know hey no no we preached from truth so guess what they did the next morning the two elders said god told us to not say another word to you these are people who brought me the message not to share anything spiritual with any you anymore and i was absolutely struck where do i go there's nobody else i know in the world nobody in the world david we didn't know of all these people around the world that believe this messi where do i go to have people that bring you to the message and then excommunicate you but i found out god did it for a purpose i stood for god's word in the very beginning and god spared me from all of the false doctrine and all of the nonsense and where are those people today they all hit the ditch somewhere and then look at a couple young kids that stayed with the word and you know what we ain't the biggest church we need to shout in this church we need the most intellectual pastors ain't that right david he was thinking on that one let me see but we're still here [Music] how many have hit the ditch and gone here and there and gone off into some false doctrine but god by his grace rich in mercy has kept us i am not kept by myself i am kept by the power of god do you love him this morning somebody say praise god amen i love you thank you for coming here this morning i'm going to turn it over to brother david i do have something for you tonight and if i if i'll get some strength in my body and i'll be able to to rise to the inspiration maybe the lord will help me to give it to you i love you thank you brother david i'm going to turn it over [Applause] you know it it's the same voice that took two people down two different paths and have them end up in the same spot you know when we left uh california brother ron went up the west coast into oregon and washington with a group of brothers and then the group that i had we went up in to montana and uh and the stories would go on forever of the things that we've seen god do and and and then i moved from montana and he moved from oregon and we both moved into flagstaff together and those three years that i spent in flagstaff with ron and sandy and uh where some of the best years of my life you know when we went through things back then we went through things together there wasn't i don't know if there's this many people in the country that believed the message when we first come in the books weren't printed the tapes weren't out you know we didn't have everything but we had that one thing that brother ron spoke to us this morning and that's that something in your heart that receives the word of god and and with young people even with people when they get older we always talk about young people you know but older people or middle-aged people are all drawn away by voices and by opportunities and and by things that are presented to them but when you have that still small voice on the inside and you can finally let that lead and guide you that's where all the unity lies and that's where all the victory lies is god he doesn't work from the outside in he works from the inside out he speaks to your heart i like how brother ron said he spoke to his heart and when we left california like brother ron went up there up the west coast i went up into montana we didn't leave knowing everything we all had long hair you know what i mean we didn't hear that yet we didn't need to hear that yet because we settled in our heart what the voice was what it was saying and we understood the absoluteness of it and it became our absolute we settled that early on that this is the voice of god amen this was the thing that stirred us this was the thing that woke us this is the thing that led us and this is what we're going to let lead us and any real servant of god will never insert himself in between that relationship amen he'll tell you like our brother did eat the book listen to the tapes know it for yourself let that voice speak to the inside of your heart because it'll all put us in unity it'll all put us in one accord just as we shared here and and you know when we come back we needed one another to survive we did we couldn't do it without one another i i didn't have work and i had to go cut timber uh what we call fence post a lodgepole pine you cut it into fence post and brother ron would go out with me and i'd cut the post down and he'd stack them that wasn't very fair but that's all you could do and i couldn't do it without him and we'd stack these posts up and and everything and we'd talk about the word of the lord we're driving down the road one day and and we just get excited about the word of god we're talking about predestination we're just thinking there about how we came out of california and how we met there at that church and and i heard the message i had a fella come to me and i had to come up commune many of you heard our testimony i had a a hippie commune which was popular back then and we'd kind of come to the lord and had this hippie commune and we're going to this church as a charismatic church remember we'd all sit around and sing they will know we are christians by our love they will know that we are christians by our love you know we'd all sing those songs and we'd all sway you know but and me and ron would be arm and arm just just playing together you know and and some man came and started telling me things and they struck my heart he said you know women shouldn't wear pants yeah i know why would that strike my heart we had pants but all our pants were what nowadays would be moz we didn't know and and he'd just say these things and never knew never tell us where he got him so i went and broke into his house and i found a book and i and that was a spoken word book and i read it and uh and so you know i sent for some tapes and brother ron sent for some tapes and out of those groups of tapes we got we both picked choosing of a bride and so we're driving down the road thinking about that time that we had together and how we came out of california and how we ended up here in flagstaff and here we are together and we got talking about predestination and our names being uh written on the lamb's book of life and we started shouting and we started having we couldn't even stay in the car it wasn't big enough for us we pulled that little volkswagen beetle on the side of the road and parked it and we ran around that car for about 30 minutes shouting and praising god i'm surprised someone didn't think that i was trying to kill him or he's trying to kill me because he'd pass me up and then i'd get to run round and around we went shouting the glory of god and we're still shouting the yes sir the glory of god and so i went to that church that night and and i finally heard when the prophet of god preached a little sermon and in that sermon he said that the bride wouldn't go through the tribulation so we're in a transitional period so i go to that uh that church that where uh me and brother ron used to kumbaya together and uh and uh you know and we we'd sing those songs you know i i got to love that baffles buddha down in my heart you know and and we love the lord it's one thing i always knew about ron is he loved the lord you know he loved the lord he loved the same lord that i did and um so we're sitting in that meeting and this guy started preaching the bride's gonna go into the tribulation so we gotta get ready we're going into the tribulation we're going in the tribulation and you know in the gentleman that i was at that time i couldn't take it no more so i i stood up and said god sent a prophet and he said we weren't going through the tribulation you know and remember ron they went crazy and he said william brown and you said thus saith the lord you're a false prophet that was true they blew up man and so they're blowing up all over the place they couldn't they're they're fighting they're fighting over the mic to rebuke us and everything and uh and then they said we'll take any doctrine and love another brother that was with me he said i i bring you the the doctrine of william branham and love and you know and uh ron's sitting there and this guy looks over at iran and says who's william brannon ron says i don't know but i'm going to find out now that's the difference when there's something in you you know be be true to the voice that's in you be true to that voice that's why the battle's in the mind because the voice comes to the inside do you hear what our brother said today he said there's so many voices out there that are trying to take you astray there's so many voices that are trying to keep you from the one true void and the biggest lie that satan tells us is that this voice of the message will not get us through this hour but faith in this voice will supply every need that you ever had you'll never see the righteous big bread you'll you'll never have to compare yourself to the world or the things of the world because you've got to remember you are not of this world you're in this world so when i finally met brother ron i meant another alien and it was fine beautiful to find somebody in life that was just as crazy as i was that loved the lord right and by by following this voice and listen this voice though our path go different things god had different ministries for us different places for us to go but there has been one governing factor through it all and that's thus saith the lord and and i just shared with my church this last wednesday this church bride all of us even though we're from different places around this country and sit under different ministries and different places we are not going to go any farther until we all settle on an absolute until we're convinced in our heart that this word this message is the absolute is the final amen and that's what he sent and when he preached leadership he said we have to have someone to lead us into the steps that lie before us and and i believe with all my heart that that's even as he spoke today he spoke what's brought us here is a voice because we've heard a voice my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow and he said i'll not forsake you but i'll be with you even in you till the end and i'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness and you know we will never go forward if we come to the place that the message has been it has been preached it has been spoken it has been recorded it has been printed this is not a has-been message it happened it hasn't even all been unfolded it's true there's there's there's food there for us and it's still vindicated and it's still true and when we all come together with that with one heart whether you're in phoenix and lose the end no matter where you are from but if we would feed together in peace together if we would incline our ear to his voice my sheep hear my voice then i believe we'll rise up in the unity and the loved one for another in the power of the resurrection that's been granted to us and we will write a book of acts after this church and i believe we're starting to write it now i believe that we're separating ourselves from the world we're dedicating our hearts to this gospel and we're trusting above all things that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so we we know that brother ron has the word of the lord for us tonight so i'm sure we'll all be back but do you love him this morning amen i'm so glad for the experiences and the love and the friendship i'm have in the past but i'm looking forward for what god's got for us amen don't you don't you baby's got something for you amen he chose you to manifest himself to the world be the salt of the earth will you god bless you let's stand this morning we'll ask brother billy to come and lead us in a few songs of worship before dismissal close our service in prayer service at five o'clock tonight god bless you we'll go pray for ron and get some strength in them and and i think the only reason he went ahead and preached because he knew i wouldn't let him say no i would have stood behind him and held them up but i enjoyed the word this morning thank you
