Description:
Br. Andrew Bohannon
Wednesday Service: August 12,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

strength it'll be a real life lord it'll be overcoming lord you said in your word through the prophet that lord we won't never let the spirit of revival die lord so we pray oh god that you would

requests that are upon the heart lord here and over the stream and the wire lord god we know that you're a god that's not fettered by time lord so we just commit all the needs to you lord committing this service from beginning to end to your hand in jesus christ's name amen amen wonderful so uh happy to hear the worship he's certainly worthy of all the praise and all the honor to his name such a privilege to live in a time where god has anointed us to see the things that we see and hear the things that we hear we are definitely a privileged people amen i just want to take a little thought that uh lord placed on my heart i was um thinking about you know the service brother david had about you know um god never called in a man until he first warned him and then even a service prior to that about the frontline workers and something just struck my heart that just maybe if the lord will help us we just want to share a little something and we'll just take the scripture out of ephesians um chapter six where we'll begin and just as he was preaching about the front line workers he had made a statement that he said well where is the front line and so something began to stir in my heart and you know it's and then he said brother branham said in that message that we listened to on sunday he said um you know we ought to go to him and find out what he wants done and so you know we take those those challenges personal you know and we place ourselves in the story and so uh tonight by his help i want to share a little bit about where we feel we can get a little closer to that front line amen so in ephesians chapter 6 and we'll start in verse 13. the scripture says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girded about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you may be able to quench all the darts the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god amen if we can also turn into first timothy chapter one paul was encouraging timothy no doubt in verse 18 first timothy 1 and 18. i think i wrote this scripture down wrong just bear with me for a second here it is this charge i commit unto thee son timothy according to the prophecy which went before on thee that thou that thou by them my war good warfare holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck of whom is hymenius and alexander whom i have delivered unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme amen you may have your seats it's interesting the um the you know we're at the end time and the the prophet said that you know we didn't come here for a picnic we're here to fight and you know god's god doesn't just provide the whole armor of god the dress where of god so that we could just you know have an apparel that people can recognize and notice but we actually want to be those members those equipment to actually be utilized and and i just got to thinking in in you know as far as what the frontline workers in the natural there's a lot of people that are putting their life on the line in front of um sick people and you know the the chaos the thought of uh germs and different things like that now people in order to help them they have to compartmentalize their own fears and then they have to also realize that there are certain safeguards if that they would just apply what exactly they've already had as far as protocol how that those protocols are safe measures to guard against an infection or to guard against a disease or or an incident where now their life could be in peril and so just like the believer there's things in god's word that if we'll just stay right with the word of god we don't have to fear nothing we can just say we'll hold to the protocol and so we're just thinking about how you know we're called to to be uh written epistles right of all men we're called to shine a light in the dark place and so as as the nurses and the doctors are looking towards science and medicine and different things to care for their patients they want to be able to ask them certain questions to start understanding where they're at what sickness do they have and how they can appropriate a salve or how they can bring about a certain remedy or some kind of vaccine or whatever they can do to help and so as believers i just got to thinking about how that we can discern the things that are going on in the world the things that are affecting people that don't have the same resources in their armament in the equipment there's people that don't have the same faith they're not they're anointed by a different spirit and we're thankful tonight that we're a privileged people that we've heard the call to come out of all that chaos and all of that nonsense all of the human thinking all of the the ways of man's science and civilization and education so we can come into the promised land of god isn't that wonderful and to know that when you've come over the the promised land and now you're on the other side you can start making a call hey you can come over to this land let me just tell you how i did it not the way i think it's done but exactly how i did it and if you do the same thing god is obligated to bring the same results because god is not a respecter of persons amen there's such a wonderful atmosphere here tonight i just thank god you know i just me as a man i feel so insufficient but we know that god's faithful and so we just we just trust in him we'll just ease our way and and just trust the lord's hand so this the scripture that we read there is and the thought that just kind of was striking my heart is to stand in the evil day and and we're anointed and you know there is an anointing that comes and it even can anoint those that don't have the life of christ now they're going to carry out a job they're going to carry out a commission also because there's going to be a people that actually stand against you and me as we're walking in life they're they're anointed for the job to stand against us but there's nothing that can stand against this word and win it's it's this is undefeatable so we just want to stay with what it says and so you just think about paul telling timothy in the scripture there he says now according to the prophecies which were went before thee and i thought about that and i thought about what things were spoken of us and you know you think about things and paul was pointing he says now if you can hold to that faith and and with a good conscience see that you might war of good warfare amen that's that's what we really want to do we want to stand on god's word and we want to fight a good warfare not holding the truth in righteousness not going about just with uh the gospel truth like a hammer you know that's we've all been guilty of doing it in our ignorance but now we want to realize there's people that are so distressed they're so in such a chaos they they have no hope they're walking in darkness but when your life crosses their path there's a glimmer of hope because you're the light of the world so i've just drawn a little contrast between faith the revelation that we've received in this hour and the fear and doubt that is also in the world i mean you think of the atmosphere how so charged it is for unbelievers to or make believers to be walking and experiencing a shutdown you know nothing seems to be making sense everything is obscure you don't really understand you're just kind of rolling along going along well what's next what do we need to do next yes but we know because a vindicated prophet came and he spoke to us and he let us know clearly he says it's thus saith the lord they're going to unite okay there's no obscurity for us we have the revelation we're the time is short we're at the end things aren't just gonna go on and go on like the scripture prophesied that they would have that attitude but we don't have that attitude we know the hour is late we want to stand at the front line and let the people know there's a place of escape from the judgment that's coming amen the the scripture says in isaiah 59 19 and kind of halfway through the scripture there it says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him hey man don't you feel privileged don't you feel the spirit of god just reviving your heart to the realities is you're that standard you see the world they're going on and and now they're being used as that flood that's coming in coming in to destroy coming in to stifle out the witness of the holy ghost in this hour saying surely you could just live any kind of life you can drink you can smoke you can do all of these things and just go to church and pay your tithe and that'll be fine but there's a standard that's been risen in this last day it's a people that say i'm not gonna take here a little and they're literal out of it i'm gonna take i want it all amen doesn't isn't that the heart of our our faith and just saying lord let me have it all what you have for me amen brother branham said this in god hiding in himself in simplicity and then revealing himself in the same he says you see it was wisdom that started the ball rolling in the muck of sin at the beginning for eve was seeking wisdom eve was seeking wisdom when she met satan and satan gave it to her he give it to her and wisdom is contrary to the word we're not asked to have wisdom we're asked to have faith in what has already been said amen you know we're just wanting to get a little closer to where we need to stand a little closer to where the front line is we want to just have faith in what already been said amen thinking about the um you know the witness of the spirit is so wonderful because you know when you're in in a question in your mind and then you're just reading scriptures and you're going on and you see a contrast then god could come and bring that witness like oh that's what the word means i see it made alive and so there's a rest there's a peace you know don't you thank god that he can give that peace that goes beyond all understanding though you don't understand what's going on all in the world but even in the midst of it there's peace see the world doesn't have that peace their their their peace is it's within the arm of flesh and what they can do in their armament but we have a different armament it's a supernatural armament you know when we see the the system the uniting of the church and state as it's coming up brother branham said this in the latest in church age about how that the the the fitting of those characteristics in the last age in which we live for example the worship of one god zeus and who was the chief father of the gods this forecasts the 20th century one god father father of us all religious premise that is set forth in the brotherhood of men okay and he says that even now is bringing together the pentecostals the catholics the jews hindus etc and they intend to to to to to a mutual form of worship that will increase our love understanding and care for each other now think about the deception okay so we're gonna help minister to somebody that's that that we need to be a front line worker going to render aid to somebody who doesn't have the present truth uh we just want to say okay you know what this whole blending where they're just watering down any truth that they're just gonna say oh you know what we're all coming together that we can increase and love one for another but there really there's no love if you don't have truth if i if i had my children running out in the street and i didn't tell them that there's a car coming that's not love there's a judgment on its road this is a watered-down gospel that they're trying to say and they're uniting for what well the pentecostals are not even striving and actually gaining ground in this union with the avowed intent that all all others will follow this very attitude was seen in the united nations organization when the leaders refused to recognize any one individual concept of spiritual worship but recommended putting aside the separate concepts with the hopes of all religions becoming leveled into one for all desire the same goal all have the same purpose and all are basically right this is the hour that we're living this is the confusion that they're promoting you know we want to war a good warfare that's a lie from the pit they have an anointing and they're carrying out their commission how about a people that sees their uniting sees their false doctrine and now we're rising up to the place where we can recognize our position on the front line we have a truth it delivers it heals it saves it brings vision it brings understanding standing in the evil day you know this day you see it there's people taking up all kinds of causes you know it's the the latest scene church ages is laid out there and it says that this is the age of people's rights and and never mind god what god sees was right never mind what god said in his word the justice is now what's justice for the people what kind of social equity can we pass out here how can we level the financial sector how can we do this and how can we do that so now they're anointed to make these stands for causes and so we want to be on the front line to be able to assist if there's somebody in need and maybe there's somebody that's still on the lam's book of life that's on that other side taking up the wrong cause we want to be able to approach them say brother this is the truth god sent a vindicated prophet that system is headed for the fire hey let's just keep it simple too you know the truth is you see it's all headed up yeah it might sound good they're giving free money now but like our pastor said there's tougher times coming this is a delayed reaction the reality is about to set in let's press in let's press into the kingdom hallelujah now they're standing and they're boldly demanding equality equality socially and financially and this is the age of the communists where all men are supposedly equal though that is only so in theory you know just because someone believes something doesn't make it right my goodness it's all headed up for that one world government that they're now setting up as we think of the city of being some great church council we we foreshadow the ecumenical move that's going to take place today wherein wherein very soon we will see the so-called christians come together indeed church and state religion politics are coming together the tares are being bound and the wheat will soon be ready for the garner amen lord if i'm doing something lord burn it out of me i want to be that ripened wheat i want to be ready for the harvest i want to be bread on this table for those who are on the front line brother come over hey man don't you feel like that don't you feel like you want purpose in your life lord fulfill your word in me this this world is headed for a burning we know the scripture says that it's thus saith the lord we know who's going to bomb the vatican and so now you know i i looked at this thing and and it just it just amazes me man when when they grab science you know one of the first times they detonated a hydrogen bomb they were kind of waiting for fallout you know they were going to do a test and it was like five megatons out in some kind of area and they they detonated in the water you know trying to minimize well water is two parts hydrogen or one part hydrogen anyway scientifically it's it's explosive oxygen is explosive and hydrogen is explosive so the fallout it turned out to be three times the magnitude of what they anticipated and the fallout was great you know we already know that they've got bombs they've got stuff that one fanatic hitting that button i mean we're sitting on a a pile of dynamite i mean the oil the gas the water i mean everybody's got uh you know those plants or whatever oh my goodness brother the judgment's in the mail let's get this urgency i mean i got co-workers i got neighbors i got family members they need to hear the truth god sent a vindicated prophet and he said come to the fountain it's flowing if you have a desire for grace come to the fountain jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't look at your life look at what his life did for you that front line worker that front line worker he makes his confession before men he says in matthew 10 and 28 he says fear not them that shall kill the body not be able to kill the soul sometimes i think that we're kind of a little bit out of balance on that because we're kind of caught up in some things that got us earthbound the lord help me lord help me fear not them which kill the body but not able to kill the soul you see man when he was created he created and then he was put in a body he never fell in that part he failed in the natural body and so god you're part of him he the enemy cannot touch you now this whole body this whole pest house is just dirt it's earth so i don't fear of this body i got another one it doesn't have these problems this one does but rather fear him that is able to destroy both soul and body in hell brother i'm on the front line i want you to know that you know what you can go without a paycheck you can die all this stuff but fear the one that can take soul and body i mean we're we're talking on a another level here you got a soul and we got a charge we got an influence our lives are witnessing something to those are desperate to have what we have just needs one spark of life one testimony brother i i was uh you know walking along and the car hit me whatever the incident was and you know what i was at god's mercy and i someone testified to me and said if you just name the name of jesus from your heart god will heal you and someone does that and all of a sudden they're just sharing it with somebody else and they say hey wait a minute he did it for such and such and he's just like me that's how simple we want it to be we're not some super duper we're just people trusting in the grace of god in the promises of the hour you are called to lift the standard of his word you have been anointed fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen ain't that wonderful amen whosoever shall confess me before man him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven yeah i got to thinking about a testimony and you know it's it's really interesting i i've never in my life you know and i'm not trying to throw anybody under the bus i really appreciate certain things that that in my life when i've come into hardships really hard times my mom's always been there for me as a rascal and she did all kinds of stuff and you know that's a mother's love you know and i i just i'm telling you i i went over to drop something off this is back in march and you know i i kind of understand better now but you know i went to see and it been a while you know with the whole shutdown and things and i went to hug her and she she kind of you know she's like i was like whoa you know wait a minute this has never happened so you think about it you know how that you know you go through things and you realize wow how the enemy will try to work in our humanity how to work in our psychology the things that we feed on have an effect in our subconscious so we got to be really cautious and and guard our heart guard what goes into the eye gate guard what goes in through the ear gate so we're not just constantly looking and feeding and then just becoming like court reporters or or news reporters or you know some kind of something that's not confessing truth that is so valuable for a son or a daughter that's been restored and been brought into the economy of god to testify of truth because that's the lifeline that's the very thing that'll draw someone into a new birth please god hallelujah says think not that i am come to send peace on the earth but i have come to i have not come to send peace but a sword and so i testified to my mom that god sent a prophet and you know surely i probably could have approached things hindsight's always 20 20. so you know there's things that you do and you realize man i wish i could have approached that a little bit differently but you know if you walk with the lord long enough you see that you're his son or you're his daughter no matter how much you fail you're still his son or daughter and god will testify of his gifts god will allow circumstance to work to vindicate his truth so don't fear of making a mistake i ended up saying some things and it was years like man i really love my mom and we things got rough you know i remember my first daughter she was you know making requests because i was like i don't know what to tell her you know just grandma's sick you know there's things going on and she did get sick you know you can only say so much about a true witness before you start symptoms start showing up you know the enemy starts knocking at your door because god's not going to have his witnesses have this kind of loss for words on that but you know you follow what i'm trying to say is that you know you can only mock so long before god comes and proves his word and so you know i ended up getting a call and you know my mom had been she had gone through a surgery and it got infected it was really bad and it was looking very dark and and her hour had come and uh just been praying just asking the lord for his his mercy and his guidance and i tell you i i was able to go where she was at at the hospice and god put a scripture on my heart i just did what he said in his word i was on the front line i didn't try to i didn't try to do anything other than what he already spoke and god raised her out of that place and you realize that today when there's needs who does she call is because there's a witness in your life where god dwells what an honor what a privilege we're living at the end and we're anointed for the job god has placed confidence in your life he has given you a testimony what the power of the resurrection can do it can take you from a life of sin and unbelief and selfishness and walking your own way to yielding and letting the love of god lead you even if it comes into persecution even if it comes into mockery even if it comes into misunderstandings you know this whole mass thing you know i already heard that the head hunt the head man the head boss over there he just said he didn't want nobody to testify of their faith you know and you know it just kind of you know it's really really hard to see like if you have any kind of damage to your ear or anything like that if you have anything other than just perfect hearing if you're talking to me with a mask and i can't see your mouth man it's hard to hear you and then you give me six feet away ah but you know we'll render under caesar with caesar's but we're looking for an entrance to be on the front line i want to see the hand of god extended through these redeemed members i want to see the house full we're we got a vision for a new church i want to see the the vision of the pastor come to pass i want to get behind them i want to say lord give everything that i got let me give it [Music] yes so man's taking up all kinds of causes because there's perception of social injustices and you know to think of the great god of glory extending his hands being nailed to a cross bridging the way that man could come back to him and man spurn that love and that grace and to think that you know the day and the hour that we're living and what we've been exposed to and how that god has manifested his word once again you know there's there's there's certain things in natural that i won't go into it very very much i don't know exactly where my time is looks like i'm already kind of there but you know there's um you know this body this body and so you know if we're going to minister aid to the world or those that we love you know the condition and the time that we're in the we want to realize okay for this cause for the shutdown and all the things that are being implemented you know people who don't have the same resources who want to see what kind of effects are transpiring in their world because if we really want to be effectual to somebody else we need to place our feet in their shoes for a moment to be able to understand if we can bring ourselves to that understanding how that they're seeing things how they're feeling things what is their mind working towards what is their hope what are they giving over to what is their faith in where does their confidence lie so we we just think about you know how that pressure you know we know that in this end time the the the there's three great burdens that that are upon this age and one was the the nervous tensions you know and and the other one was soft living and the the pressure the pressure for riches so now we're living in an evil day you know the love of money is the root of what's transpiring they want to rule because they can't get enough i mean that's an anointing so the pressures and the stresses so god made the body that if if you know you had a lion coming at you you know you would have this uh response in the body where certain other vital organs would shut down and then it would give you a burst it would give you uh adrenal rush and you would be able to i mean you could jump like probably twice as high and lift like you know so many more strength than you're capable of normally doing but this response was only supposed to transpire and and chemically there's a couple of um hormones that are released uh from there's a little gland on the kidney that um it releases adrenaline and cortisol and so these chemicals are supposed to elevate the blood pressure and and give a burst of energy and then it even enhances the brain's use of glucose and increase the ability to to substances that repair tissues so it's like okay a lion's coming boom but you're only supposed to be in that condition for just a brief moment because once you're gone then the levels can subside and you're not in fear of death just like that but now the the problem that the body has if it's constantly being bombarded with more stress and more pressure and more stress and and economic pressure or you're gonna you're gonna get sick and die pressure or or you're gonna take your kids away or or you don't have enough money to pay for this insurance if you get this virus or whatever you know and so what happens now it says that the long-term activation of this stress response system and overexposed exposure of this cortisol it actually can disrupt all of the body's processes and so we want to be aware of that well you know when we come to the front line and and realize that these people were all being put at risk because of the atmosphere that has been created around us it's it's symptoms like and and so for your nurse is going to diagnose symptoms and gather them up give them to the doctor he says well one of them the long-term stress response and exposure is is is anxiety depression digestion problems headaches heart disease sleep problems weight gain memory and concentration impairment i've been stressed has anybody else caught any of these symptoms so you know what you can go to them and say you know what i know how you feel i'm experiencing this too but you know what i want to share with you a resource this is not a coping mechanism this is not some kind of medicine this is a power to deliver this is a power that brings hope it brings peace it brings vision it brings life see we want to face the battle face the battle not just cope with it not just say well whatever's next no god has given us exceedingly precious promises amen this this pressure it causes emotional symptoms of general unhappiness moodiness irritability anger feeling overwhelmed loneliness insulation and other mental and emotional problems you know as a christian sometimes we feel these things and so what we want to do is realize we can complementalize compartmentalize those things and say you know what i can feel the feelings but that doesn't dictate my life faith is what leads me as the body perceives stress your adrenaline glands makes and releases hormone cortisol in the bloodstream this stress hormone it causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure you know and one thing that the mayo clinic advised is you know to get a hobby i tell you what it's not a hobby but let's let's get to soul saving let's get the gospel out another one of the things that said well you know exercise i want to exercise my faith when i see the sick say by his stripes i was healed if you take god at his word he'll do the same for you he said you know reading a book and say why don't we just eat the book amen amen you know you think about things and and you wonder at it sometimes but you know man they they do these things and they go to the doctors they have great confidence in science and medicine because that's what they're taught and it's not until those things completely utterly fail you that you started looking to the side unless you were just witnessed by somebody that the truth of god's word and so i think about this time that they had questioned brother branham about you know there was a there was a certain witch doctor that all these people that would have come to her and if they did the certain ceremony that you know over 30 of the people that went to the witch doctor were being healed by incurable diseases and you think wait a minute well the scripture and the question brother brown satan can't cast out satan unless his kingdom be divided so you think well how do you reconcile these things you know but you think about where we're at in time people are living by faith some of it is in their own ability some of it is in their bank account which could dwindle and then where they're at if your science and your civilization and your education fail you because it's changing there's something that doesn't change it remains the same and so they say well you know it was her approach it was the people's approach to the witch doctor that caused this god honored the faith because they believed they were approaching deity they were approaching a god and god there now so the in science they've tapped into this um effect they call it a placebo effect where if they're now they're going to have like a certain new drug or whatever they'll they'll have a test sample of thousands of people and with so many of the thousands of people they'll have the exact same looking pill and then they'll say okay without that pill is the real thing but this one over here is just sugar and so they do the test study and it's profound how many people actually whatever the the medicine was designed for now a large percent of them that took the sugar pill are good what oh my i mean the power of faith you know it was the very things that abraham feared that came upon him you know what as we're facing the things that are coming let's walk in faith believe in the promises let's not fear what man can do you know even even science is testifying about faith and how god honors faith and people try to do some kind of form of religion well i'll feed the poor i'll do this and do that those are honorable things but brother put your faith in god's word and watch him move in your life the life of your loved ones that's why i want to tell those on the front line you know what god will move for your needs and for your family it's all your hearts ever desires were he'll do exceedingly and abundantly what you can even think or imagine amen amen praise the lord you know at this i probably just try to summarize some of this and just you know we realized that as it was with you know christ's first coming and you know there was a judas and he fell for money and now there's an anointed people that are also going to follow in that same suit they're going to be very the very incarnation of that antichrist spirit but there's going to be a people that are going to be the incarnation of the living god anointed by the spirit of god and so brother brown said this in the four seal he says but when the lord appears here on earth he'll be riding a snow white horse he'll be completely fully emmanuel the word of god incarnate and see now here's the difference how much there is in them that's the difference of them notice the antichrist is a pale horse mixed colors a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up why politics is national powers religious powers its demon power and all kinds of powers mixed together a mix pale horse was he got all kinds of powers but when jesus comes he'll be on a solid white horse the word amen this is a mixed color with his colors red white black three colors in one represented in one and the three powers represented in one the white horse the black horse the red horse three crowns and one amen i seen the crown myself stood oh and closed and i looked at it won't let me get to it on the count of the glass on it so there was with a big lock on it sitting in the case a triple count crown so you know it's true uh-huh so there he he was triple crown viker of heaven purgatory and earth and see we're living in a time where it says in revelations there's we're going to merchandise all these things the gold the silver the cinnamon the this the that the other and then it gets down and it says at the end of i think it's verse 14 where it says that even the slaves and souls of man i mean we are the ones that can go to the front line and extend the lifeline brother the devil is trying to make merchandise of your soul my what a privileged people we are to shine the light of god's word if nothing else we give them an opportunity speak the truth and love if they hate you for it well they hated our lord for it you know i think that you know we want to be placing our feet and and and placing ourselves in the word um i think brother brother david said like put yourself in this story and so there was a story of a brother that was made mention and i'll try to paraphrase it because it's kind of a lengthy quote but he says in the key to the door there was a a man that kept feeling the call to the mission field in africa and he had a lovely wife and a couple of girls and they were young seven or eight and and so he just kept having this feeling that god was calling him and calling him and finally just couldn't get away from it and then he was starting to speak to his family and he said i must go and finally it came down to the showdown where he said i must go you know i think that's kind of where i stand i must stand on the front line to witness this gospel just as plain as pure and simple as it is i must go he says and then it went to the mission boards and they said oh god called me to the mission field back there in the jungles of rhodesia and in the jungles they're infested with malaria with fever with hot sun with plaguery with leprosy and all kinds of diseases back there in the jungle and that would be where he would be going for the rest of his life and so he sold his home and all that he had so the the mission board wanted to test him and said are you sure now are you sure this message is the truth we want to be certain of god because in a similar way there's things that are coming they might take our homes they might take everything we have they might try to create an atmosphere where it seems like it's all of these same perplexing things hot sun plaguery lepsy malaria fever that's kind of what the atmosphere is feeling charged now the financial burdens and all of those things but he said i'm positive see when god speaks and you know it's god you can be positive god can't lie hey man he said sir have you thought it on this manner you have two pretty little girls and a lovely wife and if you just you won't you won't pass over and then you can come back he said no that the lord told me and it is so real he said the lord called me and i don't want to leave my home i don't want to leave my church and my people but the lord called me to there in the jungle in that jungle and he said sir did you know those little girls can take yellow fever or blackwater fever and die overnight and he referred to the different people who lost their children the little ones and they were taken back there on the diseases that they had no inoculation for and he said think of leprosy oh you're pretty wife you're two girls with leprosy and that hot sun and things oh jesus see i was working on the flesh working on your conscience working on your mind that's what the devil tries to do in reason out the faith that god's placed us for to stand at the front line says aren't you afraid of the the the danger of taking your children and wife in such places and the missionaries stood there and the yellow fella the young fella with tears running down his cheeks he turned around he said my brethren my vision of god's call he said if god's called me to africa my children and family is more safe in africa than anywhere in the face of the earth amen what was it he had a key to his call he had faith in what he was talking about and i thought what a gallant remark when i first heard that my heart bounced he says if god had called me to africa and my children in leprosy and plaguery and everything else i'd be safer than anywhere else in the earth he had the key that's what it takes when you got the key there's no fear there's no doubt there's no question you don't have to ask nobody about it you know exactly amen and that's what we're asking for to god right now is god where we're at in time is this where you placed me i want to serve god with all of my heart and you know the only way we can serve god is serving his people reaching the lost standing on the front line not caring for this old bag of bones god's got it he's got provision for this guy hey man i'm gonna try to rap wrap this i just i just feel to share briefly brother brown said this and and and things that are to be you know we are the very gene of god and one of the things that we're to do is we're representatives of heaven so we're here to express god we're here to express the way he loved we're here to express the way he forgive we're here to express his kindness we're here to exp to to express when we're reviled not to revile back we're here to to offer our cloak and whatever else they ask us we want to be able to do those things and we're here to express god he says because it's our duty to express god to this nation and to this people and to this neighborhood that we're associated with amen so as we're getting ready for this build we want to remember our neighbors around here you know surely some people don't understand the hope that we have and surely it's just an inconvenience of kids crying and yelling and all the carry-ons that maybe they just they really care for but you know what we're here to express god how can we extend the hand how can we make it a little bit easier more peaceable for them now that's that's our duty and so i'll i'll wrap this up here and just invite the musicians i just have one more little thought i wanted to share with you is we're just thinking about you know you know we want to make our battles count for the lord we don't want to be just taking up arms of our own agendas and our own thinking and what we feel is necessary but now this this thought came across brother brahm in time tested memorials he said now some time ago the great caesar augustus after the great famous battle that he got the victory he won he got the victory and he was going to celebrate in rome and he said to them i want someone to ride with me some worthy man to ride by my side while i'm doing this i want some man to share these blessings with me and all the i went through the camps all the officers trimmed their plumes they polished their swords they made their armament real bright and everything they practice standing there straight and certain salutes to the king and and so forth and each one of them walked up with their big armor before him and he set out there on his throne and watching and there come up a little officer there come up an officer with his big fine plume his feather edge and stood there and made a salute and caesar he just shook his head and then he walked away and another came up and made his salute and caesar shook his head and walked away time after time soldier after soldier till finally finally way down along the line come a little footman he didn't have any shield to polish he didn't have any plume to trim but he walked in front of caesar and he didn't even know how to make the right kind of salute he just bowed his head and walked away and caesar said wait a minute come back here and he walked over there and he looked at him and he said where those scars on your face that cut that disfigure that crippled up where did you get those scars at he said i got them in the battle fighting for my lord caesar amen and he said climb up and sit down by my side you are the one that's been tested and proven hallelujah your testings and trials are not in vain saints take courage tonight he wants you to take the full armor of god realize the truth of the realities what we're going through is to battle train us to to bring us to that place where we can sit next to the lord and testify say yes i did this on the battlefront these scars it brought me to a place where now i can be adopted and you can harvest me that that ripened wheat praise the lord why don't we stand i have one closing scripture i wanted to to read in isaiah 50 9. [Music] scripture says in isaiah 59 19 he says so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall raise up a standard against it and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from the transgression in jacob saith the lord and as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the lord from henceforth forever amen so we're just believing that tonight we got a little closer to the front line we don't have nothing to fear we have like the bible says we want to fear him who can destroy the soul and the body amen [Music] why don't we bow our heads together if you have a need and the lord spoke to your heart and you received his witness and you feel that you want to be more dedicated to be a front-line worker and you you have a desire for souls you want to ask the lord to help you to cut away from anything that would hinder that work you would you would want to ask god to give you a vision what that looks like that you can walk into it let's just pray together heavenly father lord god we love you lord because you first loved us and lord you saw us in the work lord how that you placed into our care a pardon redemption lord we're so privileged lord we pray that tonight lord that you would grant vision and revelation lord that we can see the urgency of the hour the lateness how that we're at the door lord and father we just pray blessings upon each one that's made an effort here and even online lord we just commit the words that we've spoken lord we just pray that you would bless us lord each each need that's upon the heart as we commit it all to you we thank you lord for your goodness and your kindness we just committed to you now in jesus christ's name amen why don't we sing that together [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] and all i want to say [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you just take your seats in a moment i just want to make a little announcement to you all you know i i thought as as brother andrew was ministering and that song that we just sang all i want to see is jesus they can't see jesus till you either speak or move you know what i mean if they're just looking at you and you're just standing there doing nothing then they see you but when you speak or move or have an action then they see christ in you so it's just like our brother said without being there in the line without doing something without but explaining for yourself a pattern of good works without without some sort of action and even the our messenger told us he said show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my work so you can look at my actions and determine whether i believe you can hear what i say and what that i do to be able to tell whether i'm convinced or concerned or not and and so that's a very good thought tonight that that we have got to be in action i i would like uh tonight i asked brother andrew if he wanted me to make this announcement before or after he ministered and he just felt in his heart he would rather have me do it afterwards and i certainly don't want to take away from the wonderfulness of the word so you set that right in your heart i'd like just to read a little scripture to you and and and this is found in matthew 12 and you don't have to look for it you know it pretty much by heart have you not read this scripture the stone which the builders reject has become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way and they sent unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words and when they were come they said unto him master we know that thou art art true and charist for no man for that regardeth not the person of men but teacheth the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempting me bring me a penny that i may see it and they brought it and he said unto them who is this image and subscription and they said unto him caesars and jesus answered and said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesar's and to god the things that are god and they marveled at him so we're gonna try to do both and so what i'd like to do is just sit with us you know our sundays are starting to get uh more people and i'm real happy with the turnout tonight it seems like people are hungry for god but i want to set in just some new safety guidelines if you could listen and and and that is to do to render to caesar the thing that they want to caesar and still give us the opportunity to render to god the things that are god you know what i mean they'd want to cover us so we couldn't sing or we couldn't praise but so these are guidelines they're not laws they're not things that we're going to enforce or arrest you but we just asked that you would help us do these things so we want to put in place some new safety guidelines and and so and we'd like to say this and we'll send an email out and reiterate them but if you are not feeling well it is better to stay home until you are less likely to catch something so if you're not feeling well then i know that's kind of hard because we want to pray for the sick but if it's something that you're not feeling well and it's you know there's a difference between having a sickness in your body or having a disease something that we can pray for and not feeling good for when you don't have the strength so if you don't feel good then it's better to stay home so you less likely if you're not as strong and that's different than if you have symptoms if you happen to have a virus symptom fever cough fatigue and when i say fatigue i don't mean being tired or lazy it's a big difference you know what i mean i mean we have people that haven't darkened the days of the the church since this thing started you know and uh uh you know i i i i hope they're well but uh but if if you know so your loss of appetite you know the symptoms it's best to stay home and we're going to try to go back in sitting as family units the best we can parents with children aunts and uncles cousins except grandparents so if we can sit as much together in a family unit as possible that's we that we would like to do we want to sanitize our hands often coming in and out of the sanctuary bathrooms except wash and sanitize your hands often now this is something that we're going to do a little different we're going to wear masks coming into church and leaving church until you're seated like in a restaurant or at work so in a restaurant you wear a mask in you sit down you take it off the feed well we're going to wear a mask in take it off to praise the lord to worship the same and defeat on god's word and say amen but when we leave we're going to put it back on so we're going to wear our mask going in and coming if you have to get up and use the restroom put your mask on go up and use it so we're going to do the little extra measures that we can do to try to make it safe for everybody i know just like our brother said tonight we're not ruled by fear but we want to we want to make it as best as possible there have been our churches and they're believers that doesn't mean they're not godly people they're really good christian people where this sickness has struck their congregations and and i'm not saying they didn't take precautions you just don't know you know what i mean so we're going to do our best we're going to try to make it comfortable so if you would like to wear a mask in church during service feel free to do it amen don't don't feel bad but if if you do take your mask off and you sit in your seat and fine and then if you get up to go or come back in and out just put your mask on and and so we'll just we'll do that put it on and off it says yeah if if you don't want to touch anything wear gloves if you don't want to get near the offering plate or touch money or or do anything wear gloves we'll do our best to provide masks and gloves please bring your own mask if you have one outside mask are your choice but let's try to keep our social distancing you know four to six feet it's probably better not to shake hands and to hug but if you can't help it i understand i mean it's like an instinct to me you know what i mean i see somebody and i just want to grab them by the neck and just give them a big old hug you know what i mean and yeah and i i i'm just not as worried but i also don't want to send a mixed signal you you know what i mean that so we want to do our best so i think the most times we're crowded is when we're going in and out of the church and when we get in the foyer so when you get outside just create a little space for you you can take your mask off outside uh where you can leave your mask on so certainly don't feel bad about that we will we will uh uh send an email out to um to uh again to everybody but also pass it along to one another if you would and so we'll we'll just do our part and it's okay so we'll render that part to caesar but because you have to wear your mask in and out i expect us to sing all the louder and clap our hands since our hands are sanitized we ought to be able to clap them louder right and and say amen so let's really uh let's really do our best just to go forward with the lord you know brother andrew was preaching i i thought about you notice that we dumped some piles of dirt out here that was not for the kids could play king of the mountain eventually that'll be watered in and become a hard service surface that we're going to park on but the gentleman that's doing that and bringing that to us we met today and we just got to talk and in the conversation uh when he was raised the catholic that like i was raised a catholic and we started talking about doing you know knowing what god's plan is for your life just like brother said tonight you ought to go ask what would you have me to do and the conversation led and we started talking about serpency and he and it's just amazing how he just latched onto it and believe it and saw it and started rehearsing scriptures back to me that that uh testified of those things and and and how uh you know and of course he began to talk about his experiences in the catholic church and how that he knew that that some of those things weren't right and how the lord's dealt with them and it's marvelous to see what we take for granted how enthused somebody is and what the truth does for him i asked him you know i said david i said are you are you like history he says yeah i like history and i like to read i said i have a book about the seven church ages that i really think you agree well this guy's really on my heart and i'd really like to see the lord bless him i gave him a message called healing thoughts the little booklet i believe brother george or somebody put that booklet together and he told me he says man i incorporate that with my my reading every day and he's just got his year pinned from aaa and he says now this is a part of my daily worship so every day he's reading the message you know what i mean and he says it's blessing him and he's gaining faith from it and i love to see god do things for people don't you i would rather see a guy come to know the lord than be healed and so i just thought the message tonight was perfect for that so let's go ahead and stand together brother andrew i didn't mean to take from your service at all but we we need to go ahead and put these things in place and do our best to do it and you know there's all kinds of things out there you know there's people that know that they're sick and they're trying to go into public places and to try to infect people and all those things well i told the companies well that's not nothing new to us satan comes to church all the time you know what i mean trying to bring division trying to hurt people trying to complain i said just like brother andrew said tonight we got a gospel that heals all that amen so let's go ahead and and um sing this this evening and uh we'll sing it as our this mitchell song let us bow our heads father god we ask you to bless it may these words that were spoken to might anchor deep father lead us and guide us that we can be an example in a burning light that people could look at us and see that we're doing our best to worship you and to render to caesar the things that are caesar's that we're doing the best to protect one another and others and father just the little things that we do people put those hope their hopes in those little things we'll give them what hope that they have need of lord but our hopes in you our strength is in you our healing is in you our safety is in you lord jesus and we just ask you to guide us on the decisions that we make may they be right may they be true may they be understood and may the motive and objective be what stands the most and may they see you and the things that we have to choose and the decisions we make as the pastor i covet the people's prayers lord i i covet your leadership and and i covered the counsel of the elders in this church and and the people for any advice that they might have that would help us go forward lord may they feel free in their spirit to come share with me their experiences and their wisdoms that we can pass from this darkness into a greater light we ask you now father to bless these people in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen can we take a moment as we sing this together and just let's just worship him a moment let's just put our eyes on him and our thoughts on him and let him know lord i'm a child of the king no longer a slave lord i love you amen help me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm [Music] you have chosen me [Music]
