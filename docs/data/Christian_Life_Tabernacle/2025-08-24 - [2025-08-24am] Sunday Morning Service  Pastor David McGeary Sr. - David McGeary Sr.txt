We thank the Lord for that. You certainly enjoy those specials. Amen. Just a couple announcements to make at this time. If you haven't signed for the sign up for the Sunday school yet, uh please make sure to do so. Uh there's a lot of things going on in preparation for that. So, just make sure you sign up in the back so the classes can be appropriately uh allocated and everything. Amen. Also, um uh today there's going to be pictures taken for the uh directory. So, if you want to have your pictures taken, I also just want to remind if you've changed addresses, just make sure that you take one of those forms and you fill it up. Um, we went to visit somebody. We showed up at the wrong location because the address was not updated. So, please make sure you do that. It's It's very helpful. People rely on that a lot. Um, and you know, if you have if you don't have your picture in there, uh, please uh take your picture and um, arrange some time to get a picture taken today. It's that's going to be very helpful. Amen. Um, our meetings are upon us. uh they're going to start uh this coming Friday if you could put the flyer up. Uh so remember the Friday is the banquet is youth only. It's only for those that have registered. So if you haven't registered yet, uh this is your uh final opportunity to do so. Registration is free. You don't have to pay anything. All it takes is for you to just take your phone, take the link, and fill it out. So, uh, please don't show up unregistered. Um, not that we're going to send you away, but it's just very helpful, uh, so we know where to seat you. You know, we don't want you to be the guy sitting at the door entrance, so it's not going to be good. So, please make sure you register. And, and I want to just say this. I I don't know about you, but I'm expecting the Lord to do something. I I don't believe these meetings are just held so we can say we also have uh meetings but I believe uh as the Bible the prophet will tell us if we come expecting that the lord will meet our expectation we we live in such a time where our expectation has to be unlimited our expectation is for the new body is for rapture is for all of that so we we want to come to these meetings and and be expecting and be prayerful that the Lord will inspire the minister, the preacher, so you can receive from directly from God something that he has for you. And not just the meeting, even this morning. That has to be our attitude every time we walk in the building. Lord, I'm I'm here expecting for you to speak to me. And I think that's when we'll see him move in such a way that we'll never that will just pass the even the understanding of man. Amen. Um so let's do that. Um there will be a a a choir practice in uh uh after the youth choir practice in the sanctuary after that. The west just want to tune up everything and and make sure they're ready for that. We want to remember sister Heidi u you know sister Heidi Thomas lost her dad and pray that the Lord will be with the Thomas family. Brother George lost his father. We want to remember them this morning. Pray that the Lord will comfort them and and it will be the portion. Uh, Sister Melinda writes, "Please pray uh, please be in prayer for my mother. Uh, she will be having a surgery to remove her a gallbladder on Wednesday. We pray that the Lord will certainly uh, guide the whole process and be with the surgeon's hand. Men can only do what men can do, but it's God who provides the result when it's all said and done." Brother John Enchans writes up says, "Please pray for my mom as she was discharged from the hospital. The doctor says that uh there's no hope that she should go in the hospice and we need this time to minister Jesus word to her and and we are praying for clarity in their mind and we just want to remember the family at this time. I I tell you our God there's nothing impossible for him and and I want to say this even the things that comes to us he still knows about it. He allows those things so we can come closer to him and come asking and say, "Father, we have this needs upon our hearts." And amen. I want to say if you're sick this morning, if you have a need upon your heart, just lift your hand up to him this morning. Say, "Father, remember me this morning. Don't pass me by this morning. Just come by my way." When the the pastor comes and he's ministering the word, Lord, remember me this morning. I I and if though that's you all you can do. You have broken gravity and God sees your hand and he knows your need and he will do it this morning. The brothers that are taking the offerings, if you could come, brother Abel, if you could just come and take this needs before the church. Amen. [Music] Let's pray. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Santochech. [Music] [Music] United control [Music] [Music] Congrat. [Music] for [Music] Amen. [Music] Lift our hands in worship as we praise your holy name. You deserve the glory and the honor. Lord, we lift our hands in worship as we praise your holy name. Oh, you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. Oh, you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] There is no one else like you. Oh, and you of the glory.

Oh, you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. You are great. you the miracle so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Rebecca is a special. Amen. If she could bring it at this time. God bless you. Y'all pray for me. Satan's been fighting me this morning. [Music] Whatever happened to death do us part? Does it all reflect the heart? Parents faces tell of worried minds. While children search but can't seem to find. [Music] It's time we took a closer look. Got back to living by the holy book. No compromise without getting slack. We'll go forward. If we'll just go back. We've got to go back to living true. We've got to go back to the absolute. Got to where the church stand strong. Back to where there's a right and there is a wrong. Back to where it's black or white. You see the difference is like day and night. [Music] We're going back to things above. We're going back to our first love. [Music] We'll know the trees by the fruit we see. [Music] Serving God has no in between. We're ether cold or we're hot. He said lukewarm will have no part. It's coming down to in or out. There's no time for playing around. We're going back to lost or found. We're going back to stand our ground. [Music] We've got to go back to living true. We've got to go back to the absolute. [Music] Back to where the church stands strong. Back to where there's a right and there is a wrong. Back to where it's black or white. You see the differences like day and night. We're going back to things above. We're going back to our first love. [Music] We've got to go back to living true. We've got to go back to the absolute. Back to where the church stands strong. Back to where there's a ride. And there is a wrong back to where it's black or white. You see the difference is like day and night. We're going back to things above. We're going back to our first love. We're going back to things above. We're going back to our first love. [Music] Amen. That's what we want. Back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. back to where the church stands strong. Amen. Just for clarification, the the the Friday service is at 6 pm. So I I I think I heard there probably was a uh mistake in one of the flyers. So Friday sex ser uh banquet is at 6 p.m. It's youth only. Saturday service, everybody's invited. Uh not for the fellowship is for youth only. Saturday 6 pm service, everybody is invited. and Sunday morning 8:00 a.m. service, everybody's invited. Amen. Amen. Aren't you glad we serve a living God, one who knows what we have need of and and is made a way that we could certainly be touched by his word and be changed. You know, man cannot change men. Only God can make the change. Amen. Let's just open our hearts this morning as we get ready for the word and and just sing this as we invite our pastor this morning. Take this hands. Hallelujah. Oh, and take this hand. Lift them up. I have nothing strength to praise your name. Oh, I have nothing. Let's all stand and sing it. Oh, I have nothing. without you. [Music] Go and take my voice. [Music] Pour it out. [Music] Let us sing the song of mercy I have found. Oh, for I have nothing. Oh, I am nothing. Oh, without you. Oh, and all my soul [Music] for your love to cover me. All the world will say, "I have nothing without you. [Music] Take my body. Build it up. [Music] may be broken as off the ring of love. For I am nothing. I am nothing without you. Oh, [Music] and the glory I will for I am nothing. I am nothing without you. [Music] All the soul [Music] for your love to cover me. All [Music] will see. I am nothing without you. &gt;&gt; Our gracious father, what's this building? [Music] What's this people? What's this city in this town? in this world, in this country, Lord, it's nothing without you. What's our life but a space of time that's forgotten and put into the ground and maybe a wood marker on top saying this person lived from such and such time to such and such time forgotten. But Lord with you life is everything. Father, as our sister sung, the way forward is back. Lord, we want to come back to where our lives are nothing without you. Guide us there. We pray by your holy spirit and by your word. Let us find our way back. Father, I ask that you would bless this in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated this morning. Certainly always nice to be in the house of the Lord. Thank you musicians and and appreciate that. This is what the prophet of God said in the way of a true prophet. He says, "Oh, how we need today a call back to the word of the Lord." Look, today our nich nation needs a call back. And as the Lord's been dealing with our heart, we understand that in order to go forward, we got to go back. And we're going to continue on that thought this morning. We're going to play a portion out of the message in his presence. But I'd like to I have to make a few announcements this morning. Um uh if you would bear with me and and then uh we'll uh play our portion of our tape. Uh um so uh we we want uh to realize that we do have the meetings coming up. Uh brother Jason and Matt Watkins will be with us. I'm excited about that. uh for our youth. Uh and we certainly want to uh uh get registered to make it easier on everybody, but because of our preparation for that, the fellowship hall is going to be closed uh until next weekend. So, uh, if you have to feed your, uh, baby or something, maybe take them to your car or, um, uh, or you know, if you use one of the rooms then, but just don't go over into the fellowship area cuz we're decorating there. But the only meeting we're going to have over there is after service uh today after our baptism. Uh we're going to meet with uh brother Tim and I are going to meet with the Sunday school teachers and uh start finding out what we need. So we have a meeting for our Sunday school. I believe our Sunday school starts the the weekend after next weekend. And so we would love to have you let us know if you're going to have your children there uh so we can figure out how many classrooms we have to have and how many uh children. So if you can make it easier on us, you know, everybody gives these um all this effort, you know, um and you know, none of the deacons get paid, you know, the Sunday school superintendent. I think it his salary is about negative3 or $400 every year. You know what he puts in out of his pocket. Sunday school teachers just give their time and effort, but it's for the kids. And so, if you'd help what you can do to help us, it'd be uh wonderful. And you know, as we're we're growing, uh we're we all we've been growing and we're grateful for that. Uh and you know, we have new families uh coming all the time. In fact, uh, Brother Sergiro and Sister Carla Hernandez have come to join us and their four children from El Paso. I don't know if they're here this morning or not. Oh, yeah. Why don't you stand up? So, out of here, Amen. God bless you. Brother Sergio, Sister Carla, uh, Brother Sergio was a desire on his heart to spread the gospel and and to preach for doors open for him and and we appreciate that. So I I don't know if the kids are here. They didn't stand up with you. Where are you? Stand up. All right. Oh, there they are back there. You know, I uh I tried not to identify with my parents when I grew up, too. So, no, we we we certainly appreciate that. um at you know as we are uh um we've only been in the church a couple years and uh we're finding that there's certain things that are necessary uh for us to do to have order and to u and to uh be able to accommodate. and uh we we still haven't learned to be on time for church. So, uh that's always been difficult, but uh we're we're going to try to uh develop, if I could say, a seating pattern. So, um that would help us as we seat people. So, I I'd like just to uh uh so you know what we what we're trying to do is try to make things this the best and the most uh orderly as possible. We don't want to be legalistic, but we want to be able to do things decently and in order. So, if you understand, so what what we're trying to do is have some seating guidelines. Okay? And uh and uh so uh I we got kind of some categories here. So if you're young and an unmarried individual now you apply that the definition to yourself. Okay. But we want the young and married unindividuals to try to if they can seat in the first four rows, you know. So we have that for the the young and um and unmarried. Okay. So we'll do that. And I and I I know this isn't maybe fair, but we're just trying to do this to see how it works. Now, if there's total rebellion, then we'll figure something else out. You know how that goes. Cuz you're not going to make everybody happy. But anyway, we're so we're trying to get the the teenagers off the back row and get them up front, you know. So anyway, and then if you're you're married couples uh without small babies, then maybe you could sit in the middle of the church somewhere uh in the rows 5 through 8. Now, we're not going to number the rows, but it's just how it is. Uh you know, I'm subject to the deacons. I didn't know if you knew that or not. And then families with young children, you you'd sit in the next part of the church like through nine and 10. And then um and then so then we'll try to save the the back rows for like the small babies that where the mothers have to go out. But here's the good thing, and this is how it's written. Our precious elders are welcome to sit wherever they are most comfortable. If you need assistance, please let the deacons know and we are here to serve you. So Jerome where whatever category you want to put yourself in, young, old, senior, you know what I mean? uh feel free and uh you know uh so um you know so that's how it is. So we we'll try it. Uh if you come in late and uh you're a young person, they'll probably just escort you on up to the front and fill in the spots and and all those things. So uh we want to know that. So just uh try to stay out the best you can out of the uh uh the room over here. We will have our Sunday school meeting. And then another housekeeping issue um and uh it is um you know we know that sometimes our babies have accidents and we understand that but uh if your child has an accident on the pews, would you immediately clean it up? um if you could do that. Um now if you can't afford diapers or you didn't bring extra diapers, let us know. Uh we'll provide that for you. But what's happening is some of the children are um you know, do I need to get more descriptive? You got the picture. Okay. So we need to keep it clean. There's nothing more like a surprise when our sisters are cleaning and they come down and all of a sudden there's a real some type of thing going on there. So, um, enough said on that. We're good. Okay. All righty. Um, we made mention last week and um, and I want to explain it a little deeper to you about um, and I hope I didn't come across being upset and and I I appreciate the fact that you love me and and if we preach a sermon that you're appreciative of that and I know that uh we applaud for specials and that's the time and place to do it but after the preaching of the word um we ask not to applaud for a reason and the um when the word's preached if you would um you know understand the whole purpose of the gospel this is a house of correction you understand that we come here to hear the word of God we don't come here for the minister to correct us or the minister to point out fault uh you know I do have a few hobby horses I get on every now and then and you just have to bear with me uh through those. But the the idea is that you hear the word of the Lord and the Holy Spirit deals with your heart and you want to keep that atmosphere. Uh I was fellowshipping with brother Joan and he he put it in such beautiful uh terminology. He said we need to marinate in in the in the word, you know, and when you marinate something is is you let it soak in till the flavor of it comes into it. And that's what we want. We want the spirit of God to soak in to us until we uh it becomes a part of our lives. And the Holy Spirit's very timid and he's he's looking for a place to rest. And our our messenger taught us that he's looking for a hungry heart, something to rest. And um we want to work towards that atmosphere. And a as I think when we listen to this portion, it's just 24 minutes. When we listen this this morning and we'll make a few comments, you'll understand uh the direction that is on my heart. The Lord started dealing with me the end of last year here just recently about where do we go from here? Uh what's our path forward? What's next for the church? you know, uh, we've been through doctrine and doctrine and doctrine, but I think the most important thing is that we should be able to take what we have and bring it out to the world as a burning light. And we need to be more sensitive to the moving of the Holy Spirit. We don't want to produce wool. We want to bear it. We want our lives to just for God to be able to deal with us. And we want to be extremely sensitive to him. And that's what our heart's desire is to de to bring his presence into our midst that he can deal with us as a body and as individuals and that we can have leadership in our lives. Very important that the spirit of God is leading you in your life. And so we want to play this message in his presence and we hope that we'll play pro portion tonight uh rest some of it this evening also but I want you to listen as brother Bram explains the effect of God's presence and so and then we'll make us a few comments on it afterwards. words. So, uh we're the he he's going to read um out of the book uh uh uh here uh out out. It's out of the uh book of uh let me see here. I had it wrote down. I um it's Isaiah the I believe the sixth chapter. and and we'll we'll read there uh the sixth chapter of Isaiah and uh and we'll we'll the prophet of God's going to read the scripture. We'll use that as our scripture reading. Then we'll listen to these next few moments and and just listen. It's very easy listening. But but understand what that he's pointing out. You understand? He's pointing out the effect of the presence of God. You understand? So he's making a great distinction and he wants us to understand the distinction of the presence of God and what the presence of God does. And then when you see certain responses to what people think is the spirit or the presence of God, then you can see there's a contrast. And you'll find out that all these people that he's talking about that came into the presence of God all felt like they were dead men. You know what I mean? Now, our idea today of coming into the presence of God is running around and and doing all that. And he wants to make a distinction &gt;&gt; because when God is present, &gt;&gt; things happen. &gt;&gt; Good things happen. Yes, &gt;&gt; prophet of God told several of my friends and brother Billy Paul shared it with me, brother Ed Biscll shared it with me, Barroy Border shared it with me. Uh many of the people that uh brother Robersonson they said whenever brother Brandham was around good things happened because he brought that presence of the Lord. I remember brother Hickerson talking about I think brother Brenham gave him a fishing pole or something to go fishing with. He said he caught fish a mile high. He ran back down there and brought somebody else. They didn't catch a thing, you know. So, we want to become sensitive to that. We also want to understand that we have a guide. Do you understand God sent us a message to guide us through this hour that we're in? the most evil, the most wicked, the most deceptive age, more temptations, more spirits to draw us off, more candalization to the flesh and to the mind, and and we've got to be able to build up a resistance to the things of the world and return back to the world. We listened last week where prosperity is not a measure of God's presence and we and and the church is drifting that way. Numbers is not a measure of success or God's presence. The only measure of the spirit of God as our our messenger said was the deviation from the word of God. That's how you tell something is how does it deviate from the word of God. And in my own personal heart, there just seems to be such a drift away from the absoluteness of the messenger and trying to separate the messenger from the message and trying to separate the move of the Holy Spirit from the word of God. And uh we've got to come back to that, back to our ABCs, back to our fundamental holiness, back to what true spirituality is. And um to me I feel that's my responsibility of of of whatever influence I have in an hour or so on a Sunday morning is uh what direction are we going to and I don't want to go forward without the guide. So I hope you understand that. So, uh, it wasn't that I didn't appreciate the hand clapping. It w the applause. Uh, everybody likes to hear they did good. I I, you know, I I know understand that you it's your way of saying that it's a great sermon. I really enjoyed it. But that's not the point of the sermon. &gt;&gt; You understand that's not the result. I I'm not preaching for that result. Is you understand that? So when I get that result, it makes me feel like I didn't accomplish what I was preaching &gt;&gt; for. Is it you you understand that? So we're we're we all want the same thing here, don't we? Isn't our goal to try to make the rapture? Are are we all here for that? &gt;&gt; I mean, we don't want to be left behind. And and and I know young people you go through different things in life. It's a very difficult time of life. But that you know we want you to understand that the world is not your friend. &gt;&gt; They're they have it doesn't intend for you to live forever. Their goal is to destroy your life, destroy your mind, destroy your spirit, and take you to hell, you know, and and and we we don't want that for you. We don't want you to do a temporary career or a temporary fantasy relationship or get involved with a boy or a girl and have your life scarred and then you have to battle battle mental battles all your life and then you get to the place that you you know you you you have to suffer for those things. You know, we want to get you back if you've been that road. We want to get you back to the peace and the love of the Lord Jesus Christ. We want us to res as a body of believers to understand the importance of being born again of recognizing the world and the things of the world and having the spirit of God come into your life, forgive you of your trespasses, and fill and lead your life. Those are some of the basic things that we've got to project. And and if if I've uh and like any minister, we've been down the roads of mysteries. We've been back to the things. But nothing happens without the presence of God. though if you would uh bear with me and my folly if you would say that and and listen for the next 20 minutes to a man whom I believe was the fulfillment of the promised message of this age. The fulfillment of Malachi 4:5. Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. The fulfillment of Luke 17:30. In the days as it was in the days of Noah, as it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the day of the revealing of the son of man. and also Revelations 10:7, in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mysteries of God should be finished. So to me, this was a man that was born, created, and sent to fulfill scripture and to give a message to this generation. And that message is not to be handled by man. It's to be left alone just the way God brought it. And he brought it in such a manner that it would speak to every predestinated heart. It doesn't need explaining. The Holy Spirit will convict you and speak to you and deal with you from the word of God. So, let's just listen and we'll have a few comments at the end and uh and and we appreciate and love you. So, um let let's just try to go forward. Let's clap for the uh specials and after the preaching, let's marinate. &gt;&gt; Sound good? God bless you. This is your messenger trying to guide you to the kingdom. And now tonight, God willing, we're speaking on the subject of in his presence. Oh, how we thank God for the privilege that we can come into his presence. But first, I wish you all to turn in your Bibles with me to the prophet Isaiah, the sixth chapter of the prophet Isaiah. We all know that Isaiah was a major prophet and one of the great prophets of his day. He ended his life by being saw a sunder with Sauls for a testimony as a martyr to the power of almighty God. In the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter, I begin at the fifth verse to read. Then said I, woe is me. Or maybe I start with the first verse. Let's pardon me a moment. Let's start at the first verse and read down to about the eth verse. In the year the king died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne. High and lifted up. In his train filled the temple. Above it stood the serapens, each one having six wings. With twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly, and one cried unto another, and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts, and the whole earth is full of his glory. And the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. Then said I, "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts. Then flew one of the seraraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the thongs from off the altar. and he laid it up on my mouth and said, "Lord, this has touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is purged." Also, I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Who shall I send and who will go for us?" Then said I, "Here I am. Send me." May the Lord bless his word. I think that's the most striking scripture. We find that in the presence of God, men recognize themselves to be sinners. We may feel pretty good when we're out different places and feel like that we're pretty good people. But when we ever come into the presence of God, then we see how little we are. [Music] &gt;&gt; Standing not long ago with a a friend of mine that I had the privilege of leading to Christ, Bert Call up in New Hampshire, a hunting partner. We are standing by Cobbrook Falls up in the Aderondac. And it was such a mammoth big falls. I taken my family last year up there to look at it. Way back off the road, you had to hike back to get to it. And when we seen that blue green water pouring with such mighty power out of the mountains and gushing down over the rocks, Burton stood there and looked at me and he said, "Gee, Billy, it makes a man feel just so little." He measured about a quarter of an inch on his fingers. I said, "That's right, Bert." Now, that was all he of getting into the presence of God to see his creation. I wonder the man who wrote, "How great thou art." If he didn't look up one night, look at the stars, how far they are away. A few months ago, Brother Fred, Brother Woods, and I was standing with Brother Mcilly out in the Arizona desert. We was measuring trying one star how close it was to the other. And with the millions and billions of miles away, they did look over a quarter of an inch from each other. Then we begin to think according to scientific proof of that, those stars are probably further away from each other than we are from them. See how it is? Then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is and how close we come in coming to his presence. Somehow or another, it's always stroke a great effect upon people to come into the presence of God. I've seen the time in my ministry when you would see the presence of God come into such a place that it would bring a person up and just reveal the life to them and call out their sins of all kinds of immoral acts. And it brings such a holy hush amongst the people till they drop out of the prayer line before they ever come up to be prayed for and run to the altar, get right with God before they come up into his presence. &gt;&gt; There's something about coming into the presence of God. It causes things to happen. I've seen people laying in CS and stretchers that night down there at Mexico when that little dead baby laying under a blanket that the little Spanish mother brought up or little Mexican mother rather brought up. when they seen several thousands of those people saw maybe 50 or 75,000 at one gathering saw that little dead baby come to life went and fainted. People threw up their hands and screamed. Why? They realized that a human being could not do that. that they were in the presence of almighty God &gt;&gt; and it caused something to happen. &gt;&gt; I've been privileged to hear godly man speak. It was said one time of Charles Spinning, little bitty fella never weighed over about 110bs, but he had such a forceful way of speaking until he was trying the acoustics one day in a building. They didn't have PA systems then. And there was a man repairing up in the balcony or up in the roof of the place and he heard the man come in. So he didn't know who they were. He just kept quiet. Mr. Finny was going to try the acoustics. After spending much time in prayer for that revival that is going to hold, he tried his voice to see how it would carry. He slipped up quickly to the pullpit and said, "Repent or perish." And he said it with such for force after being on the donate God till the man dropped out of the top of the balcony down onto the floor out of the top of the building onto the floor. He preached the gospel in such way till he stood and Boston, Massachusetts in a little bay window because there's no church could hold his crowd. And he stood there with such mighty force and preached held such a place until working men with their baskets under their arms fell into the street and scream for mercy &gt;&gt; in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Great preachers who's been able by the word of God to bring the presence of God to an audience. &gt;&gt; For be it that man would ever be so seared in their hearts for they could never recognize the presence of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Forbid &gt;&gt; when the first man as soon as he had sinned and done something wrong and when God came into his presence or he came into the presence of God, Adam, he could not stand in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He run and hid himself in the bush and tried to cover himself with a fig leaf because he knowed he was standing in the presence of Jehovah, the creator. That was the reaction of the first man after he had sinned and tried to come into the presence of God with sin upon his soul. He could not hide because he was tender yet. Sin had not took a hold like it has rooted into people's hearts today. But he was very conscious that he was standing before his creator. how he hid himself in the bushes and would not come out and could not come out until God had made a preparation for him. We could go back and take a Genesis the 17th chapter and the third verse when the great patriarch Abraham when he came into the presence of God and God spoke to him in the 17th chapter in the name of Almighty God, Abraham fell on his face. Amen. &gt;&gt; The great patriarch servant of God could not stand in the presence of God though had served him for 25 years faithfully. But when God moved into his presence, the patriarch fell on his face because he couldn't stand in the presence of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Exodus 3, we find that Moses, the great servant and prophet of God. When he was back on the back side of the desert, that man was a holy man. He had been born for the purpose. He was born from his mother's wombs to be a prophet. He had tried to get his education and do everything he could to deliver his people because he understood that he was to deliver his people. But when he had understood it by a theological standpoint, he was trained, he was well scholarred, he could teach the Egyptians wisdom, which was the most smartest people in the world. He know all the ins and outs. He know the scripture from A to Z. He know the promises that God had made. He know them from an intellectual standpoint. And he was a a great military man. But one day on the back side of the desert when he come into the presence of God, he jerked off his shoes and fell to his feet knowing that he was on holy ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could not stand upon his feet when he come in the presence of God. He fell to his face like Abraham did. He could not stand in the presence of God. In Exodus 19:19 when the chosen people of God since the way back in the days of Abraham from Abraham come Isaac Isaac come Jacob out Jacob come the patriarchs and years after years had developed holy man great man a chosen people a chosen race a sanctified holy people and serve God their life and one day God said gather Israel out here I'm going to speak to them. But when God came down on top of Mount Si, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; and the whole mountain caught a fire and the smoke was powing from it like a furnace and the voice of God roar out. Israel fell on their face and said, "Let Moses speaking not God lest we die." &gt;&gt; Man in the presence of God &gt;&gt; realizes he's a sinner. Yet they were everyone circumcised according to the law. They had carried the commandments and everything. But when God spoke and they moved up into his presence, they realized that they were out. They were they were not right. There was something that was lacking because they were in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. And they said, "Let Moses speak and not God. For if God speaks, we'll all die. Let Moses speak to us. It was in Luke 5:8 that when Peter, oh, when he was a great stubborn man and a man of great influence, great power that we understand, he was like a bully, a noted fisherman. But when he saw the miracle of God performed by an ordinary man looked like, which he recognized at that time that that taken more than a man to throw all that fish in a net where he with all of his education, his knowledge of fishing had fished all night and not even taken a thing. But he heard someone say, "Cast your net in." &gt;&gt; And when he began to pull, he had a great multitude of fishes. And he realized that he was a sinful man and he said, "Depart from me, oh Lord, for I am a sinful man." &gt;&gt; Who said that? St. Peter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the presence of God asked for God to depart out of his presence because he recognized himself a sinner. &gt;&gt; Abraham recognized himself wrong. Adam recognized himself wrong, which was the son of God, recognized himself wrong. Moses recognized himself wrong. Israel as a church and nation recognized themselves wrong. Depart from me, for I am a sinful man. He didn't try to say, "Now I'm holy and worthy to receive this." He said, "I am a sinful man." One time a selfstyle religionist with all the theology they could learn under a great teacher called Galia. His name was Saul of Tarsus which we know as Paul. Religious to the dot. He know all the ins and out of their religion. He was a Pharisee of the Pharisee and a Hebrew of the Hebrews. He was a noted man, a scholar, smart, shrewd, educated, plain old god from baby up. One day on his road down to Damascus, that pillar of fire shined over him and he fell on his off of his feet to the ground in the dust and said, "Lord, what would you have me to do?" Amen. &gt;&gt; All of his great training, all of his great theological training, all of his education didn't mean a thing when he stood in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; I'd like to stop here a minute and say that's the same thing. You might have died DD, PhD, whatever you might be. You might have went to church since you was a child. You might have done all the religious acts there is. But once in the presence of God, you feel so little in no count. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul realized that he was wrong and he fell to the ground under the influence and power when he looked up and seen the very God that he had been preaching and against the thought he knowed and seen that he was wrong. He fell from his feet to the ground because he was in the presence of God. He seen that pillar of fire. What about the great St. John of Revelations 1:7. When he was showed the vision and looked and heard a voice speaking to him, and he turned to look to see the voice, and he saw seven golden candlesticks, and one stood in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, with hair like wool, eyes like flames of fire, feet like pillars of brass. He was girded with a golden girdle around the patch. And he was called the word of God. And when the great saint John &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; had walked with Christ &gt;&gt; leaned up on his bosom &gt;&gt; when he done all these things as I said this morning Paul's ministry exceeded any of them here after John had walked with Jesus talked with him slept with him eat with him but when he seen him standing there that glorified state he said he fell like a dead Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; We can come to church and talk and praise God and so forth, but oh brother, when we see him coming, &gt;&gt; something will be different in our hearts. &gt;&gt; We might think we do our religious duty but go to church and pay our tithings. We might think we keep the laws of the church and recite all the creeds. But once let us get a look at him, the whole things changed all the way around. &gt;&gt; Yes, it's sure this great man, St. John, a great man like that, the Bible said in Revelations 1:7 that he fell as if he was a dead man. after three and a half years of fellowship with Christ was one of the writers of the epistles wrote behind him, eat with him at the table, slept with him at the bed, and fellowship with him wherever he went. But when he's turned to see him, he had no more life left in him. He fell like a dead man to the floor or to the ground. All right, we see Isaiah in Isaiah 6 and5 as we've just read this great mighty prophet. &gt;&gt; He's one of the greatest prophets there is in the Bible. There's 66 books of the Bible. There's 66 chapters in Isaiah. Isaiah starts off in Genesis. The middle of Isaiah, he brings in the New Testament. At the end of Isaiah, he brings in the millennium. just exactly Genesis, the New Testament, and Revelations. Perfect. Isaiah was one of the major prophets. But one day he had been leaning upon the arm of Hezekiah, the great king Hezekiah taken from him, and he was down. He was a pretty good fellow. He's a good righteous man. If that righteous king, a good king, recognized him as a holy man and kept him in his temple. Isaiah saw visions. He was a prophet. Isaiah preached the word. He was a minister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah was a holy man. &gt;&gt; But one day &gt;&gt; down in the temple, he fell into a trance and he saw the glory of God. &gt;&gt; He saw the angels with wings over their face, wings over their feet, flying with wings, crying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." That prophet realized he was nothing. &gt;&gt; He said, "Woe is me, for I am a man of unclean lips, a prophet, &gt;&gt; a mightest prophet of the Bible, one of them. I am a man with unclean lips, and I dwell among people, it's unclean lips. Woe is me because I see the glory of God." And he said, "When that angel cried, the post of the temple shook back and forth." Brother, &gt;&gt; that'll make you not only does the post of the temple go to shake, but the whole heavens and earth go to shake. &gt;&gt; The mountains will flee and the seal fade away and scream, "Hide us from the face of him that sits upon the throne." &gt;&gt; It's going to be a terrible time. I tell you, sinner friend, you better be checking it up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, Isaiah said, "Woe is me. I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell among unclean people and I'm these people as unclean lips. Now remember, if such holy man recognize themselves sinners in the presence of God, what will the sinner and ungodly do at that day? &gt;&gt; What will people do who set in the meetings? What will the people do that's seen the power of God, that's heard the countdown on the word, &gt;&gt; that's seen God manifest himself and beyond a shadow of doubt ever scripture fulfilled &gt;&gt; and will still try to make it to heaven without being born again and receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "If a righteous man be scarcely saved, where will the sinner and ungodly appear?" Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of a place are we going to stand in if we see God unfold himself right before us and see the glory of God just the same as that man did? And that kind of man cried out. Prophets and sages upon whom the word is based upon. If they cried and fell to their feet and screamed, "A man of unholy lips, uncleanness." What will it be then for that man who won't even confess his sins? &gt;&gt; What will it be for that teenager that won't confess his or her sins? &gt;&gt; What will it be for that hard-hearted man that thinks he knows more about uh God's creation, God does himself? What will happen to that man spent all of his life trying to disprove the Bible? Where will that guy appear at? &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; This is evangelism. &gt;&gt; This is a time to shake people. &gt;&gt; This is a time that God said there come a time he shook Mount Si one time, but there come a shaking again that he wouldn't only shake Mount Si, but he shake everything that could be moved. &gt;&gt; But did you notice the rest of scripture? But we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everything that can be shock will be shaken. &gt;&gt; The heavens will shake. The earth will shake. Heavens and earth will pass away. But that word shall never pass away. For upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell will never break. &gt;&gt; Everything that can be shut will be shaken. But we receive a kingdom which is the word of God himself. And God is his word. He don't shake himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; It's unshakable, said Paul, the Hebrew writer. Such a person, and such a man, such a time, and how they felt. We have also ourselves. We've seen the glory of God like this man did. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen, &gt;&gt; sir. We seen it. We see the glory of God like Abraham saw it. &gt;&gt; We saw the glory of God like Moses saw it. &gt;&gt; Same pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; The same power of God. &gt;&gt; The same Christ unrevealing himself, showing himself, keeping his word in the last day. How can we come by then and walk and treat it so lightly? &gt;&gt; How can we walk around and hold our creeds and denominations and not take the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. What will it be for us in that day? How will it happen with us when we see the glory of God? Some people stand off and make fun of it. &gt;&gt; Some will laugh at it. Some will call it fanaticism. Some call it mental telepathy. &gt;&gt; Some call it beyond. &gt;&gt; Some call it one thing or another. &gt;&gt; As the old proverbs is, fools will walk with hobb shoes where angels prayer to try. &gt;&gt; Right? The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." When he sees God manifested so perfectly by his own word, not by a creed, but by his word, and then walk right over it and make fun of it, he's a fool. &gt;&gt; As God is the word, and God's made himself clean to him, &gt;&gt; and he's a fool, the Bible say, &gt;&gt; what will it be for him when he has to stand in that place? It'll be a it'll be terrible for that man in that day, the ungodly. I certainly hope you can recognize the contrast. Okay? But that's what we need. We need the presence of God. We need to feel the presence of God. You can't receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit without coming into the presence of God. And so we I just want to uh uh you know in a just in this manner of of talking why it's so important to come into the presence of God. And and so we we understand that that that's if you want to worship somebody or fellowship with somebody, you got to come in his presence. You You know what I mean? And and that's what we're here. We're here to worship him. So in order to worship him, we want to come into his presence. We want to we want to feel his spirit is here amongst us. We want to we we want to be able to open our hearts to him. But because there's certain results, certain things happen in the presence of God, people shy away from it. &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's just take just a few moments. we won't be long at all. He says he he says this. He says we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is and h how close we come and how close we come in of coming to his presence. somehow or another it always throws a great effect upon the people to come into the presence of God. So we understand that God's presence has an effect. You you understand and and so you your your human nature, right? So we we begin to understand that that the the presence of God has an effect. So the the it it causes things to happen. &gt;&gt; You you understand? So I'm I'm just saying that you don't control the presence of God. The presence of God controls the atmosphere. The presence of God takes command over the situation. When the presence of God comes, everything falls subject to the presence of God. It it's eternal. It's supreme. It It's the ultimate. It's the end of the story. In fact, there's nothing to be said in the presence of God. And so, we understand that he says these things. He said he says he he he says the presence of God come into such a place that it would bring a person up and just reveal the life to them and call out their sins and kinds of immoral acts. It brings such a holy hush amongst the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now he he you know it that's something isn't it? &gt;&gt; It brings such a holy hush amongst the people and we we've been taught you know be still and know that I'm God. The presence of God brings such a holy hush amongst the people. So if the people aren't desiring the presence of God, they're going to make a lot of noise because the presence of God brings an effect. So we love to worship them. Lord, you stay up there. We'll stay down here. We'll praise you. We'll worship you. We'll have a good time. We'll sing our songs. We'll operate everything. But you just accept our worship. &gt;&gt; But we know if you come in here &gt;&gt; in our presence, there is going to be a holy hush. Every single one of those men that that came into the presence of God, every single one of them begin to do a self-examination. &gt;&gt; Paul, Moses, all of them. &gt;&gt; He said John walked with them, ate with them, talked with them, lived with them. But when he come into that presence, he felt as a dead man. &gt;&gt; So we we got to understand there's a reason that man has been shying away from the presence of God and the true baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now remember, the anointing can fall on the just and the unjust. We won't go into a lot of teaching on gifts, but the presence of God does something to you. &gt;&gt; He makes this statement. It brings a holy hush. He says, "See, there's something about coming into the presence of God that causes things to happen." Things to happen. So these are evidences, if I could say that, that the messenger's telling us and bringing to us. He says when God comes, the atmosphere changes. When God comes, men change. When God comes, if you are no longer in control. And that's what man has always wanted to do is be in control. They want to control their singing. They want to control their worship. They want to control how their reaction is. They want to control how people look at them. &gt;&gt; You could be the greatest preacher in the world. The presence of God comes on you. You'll be on your floor. You'll be crying and balling in the presence of God because you realize that you are a sinner. The only place a man can be great and be important is outside of the presence of God. &gt;&gt; So we got to understand why that we're shying away from it. Man likes to operate as a group. comfort in numbers. But if there's sin in our midst, then we'll want to shy away from the presence of God. If there's not sincerity in our midst, we'll shy away from the presence of God. If there's not dedication, we'll shy away from the presence of God. If we come just to fulfill an obligation, we're not going to be looking for the presence of God. We want to go beyond what we believe. We want to get into that place where we can invite the presence of God and let God make things happen. &gt;&gt; You know, we let things slip. like young ladies, you we we we preach against high heels and in tight dresses and and things that allows you to present your body as a sex object. We preach against those things because th those things are the things that the makes the Holy Spirit just fly away, &gt;&gt; you know. I mean, and then things start thing we just start letting those bars down. We don't worry about our hair and and we don't worry about there's certain things we don't worry about. We we we we forget about the ABCs. We forget about those fundamentals. We do those things, you understand? in preparation for the presence of God to come and and and not to do that because we we we know there's certain things like we've been reading that the presence of God does. Far be it it that a man would ever be so scared in his heart till that he could never recognize the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look at what he's saying. He says, he's saying people are afraid of the presence of God. He says, "Far be it from us." We get to the place that we're afraid of the presence of God because the presence of God's going to convict us of sin. Any man that came into the presence of God realized he's a sinner. &gt;&gt; And that's not a good feeling. &gt;&gt; It brings conviction. And those are the things we get away from. But once we can understand that, sure the presence of God convicts us of sin. Sure, the presence of God tells us we're wrong. But that presence bring makes things happen. It it makes us realize that we're nothing and he's everything and he still loves us. says because he was he's talking about that was the reaction of the first man after he had sinned and tried into the come into the presence of God with sin upon his soul. He could not hide because he was tender yet. And and the this is the thing as a pastor is that I afraid we're losing that tenderness. You know, we've fallen into we're going to have song service. We're going to have programs. We're going to have preaching. We're to discuss our creeds and our doctrines of what I believe. Like I said, most people, they're members of a message. They're not members of a body. This is just a place they come to fulfill their obligations to the message. But that's never been the body of Christ. It's always been people that loved one another and were fitted and joined together and they ministered to one another. They lived for one another. They they they worked together for the furtherance of of one another and the helping of one another to come into the presence of God. But he said even Adam he said he he he said he was still tender yet sin had not took a hold like it has rooted into people's hearts today. See sin has got rooted into our hearts. In other words when something's rooted into your heart it becomes okay. Things have become okay. It's never okay to talk about somebody. &gt;&gt; It's never okay to murder somebody's influence. It's never okay to gossip. And let me say this, it's never okay to look back on your life once the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven you. Don't pull things out from under the blood. He says he he he says but he was very conscious that he was standing before his creator. He was still he was conscious. Brother Bren preached sermons like Jesus with dirty feet where he sat in the corner. He preached a message the unrecognized presence of God. He's he's talking to a nation and and to a people. And it's the very presence of God, the son of man ministry. God veiling himself, Jesus Christ present with them using a prophet man as a veil and looking out of the people and they don't recognize it. They don't sense it. They don't feel it. They don't feel the holiness. That's why the lot of the people rejected the prophet of God because whenever he'd come, he'd bring conviction. He they didn't like the fact the women didn't like the fact the way that he made them feel cuz I'll tell you what the presence of God made them feel. They felt naked, blind, miserable, poor, and wretched. And and we we don't want to slip church into being church. We don't want to slip into religion. We don't want to slip into creating an atmosphere and an attitude about one another. We don't want to get to the place I belong. I'm okay. We want to be able to get to the place I'm going to come into the presence of God. And if it slays me, &gt;&gt; and that's what we could probably should all use as a good slaying, don't you think? And that's what I'm trying to say is that we've got to get back to the ABCs. &gt;&gt; We've got to get back to the fundamentals. We've got to get back where right is right and wrong is wrong. &gt;&gt; We've got to get back to the book. We've got to get back to the word. You can I it can say we, but we is me and thee. You've got to get back. I've got to get back. I've got to reestablish. I've got to take a look at myself. I I've got to do those things. You know, the prophet of God, he preached, you know, he called the Beatles, remember? recalled the Beatles haircut and he talked about bangs on their heads and and all that and and now it's all over the message in our young kids. We don't even hardly have a the the guy's standards are going down and and those are things that and I'm not talking about from the trying to condemn anybody. I'm talking about our return back to the presence of God. Back to where we don't come into church. When you walk through those doors and you sit in your seat, you should start inviting the presence of God &gt;&gt; in. Lord, if nobody in here wants your presence, Lord, please let your presence fall upon me. &gt;&gt; I want you to to discern me, my my thoughts and intents of my heart. I I want you to go uh through my life. He says, "A man in the presence of God realizes he's a sinner. Nobody likes correction. I certainly don't. You know, I like I I I can Give me a bit of time and I'll justify every mistake I've ever made and I'll show you somehow that I was right. That's human nature. And those are the things that we want to lay down. Lord, I'm laying down my nature for your nature. I want to be in your presence. But it's that conviction of sin. What did Adam do? He used to walk with them in the evening. Then he realized he's a sinner. And what did he do? He ran and hid. Well, where do you think that we would do? What would I do? Well, I would run and hide, too. You say, "Oh, I wouldn't run and hide." Yeah, you would. You know what? What Adam was afraid of? He's afraid God was going to kill him. And God would have killed him. But instead, God did a lamb sacrifice to cover his sins. And the prophet of God will go into this in the next part of the tape, how God gave us a lamb sacrifice, too. Sure, he'd run and hide. So, what's our nature? If we're going to come in here all full of the world, all backslid, all kinds of junk on our lives, doing all kinds of stuff, no, we're not going to run into the presence of God. We're going to hide in church. There's no bushes to hide behind. So, we hide behind doctrine. We hide behind song service. We hide behind personality. We hide behind the message. We hide behind the pillar of fire. We hide behind the cloud. We hide behind who we are. But we won't stand naked. Excuse the expression. Because that's what Adam realized. All of a sudden, he realized he was naked and he didn't want to go into the presence of the Lord naked. How many knows what religion is? It's a covering that thy nakedness does not appear. You can have all the anointing, all the gifts, but when his presence come, the gift stops, the anointing stops, and there's a holy hush. &gt;&gt; If you're feeling conviction, that's a good thing. That's the first sign of his presence. &gt;&gt; When his presence comes, the first thing that happens, everybody that's a sinner, all the sin in your life all of a sudden is exposed. And you feel you're a sinner. You feel you're unworthy. You feel you're no good. You feel that all that your big mouth rolls on about yourself and all the theology that pours out of your mouth, all the types and wisdom that you have, it starts to shrink and pretty soon you realize I'm not so big. He said when the presence of God, man realizes how little they are. And that's why that we we tend to avoid the presence of God because our conscience bothers us. And we substitute we substitute anointing for holiness. We substitute doctrine for life. But there's nothing that substitutes for the presence of God in our life. And that's what he said. He says he realizes what he sinners. He says here, he says, ' I'd like to stop here a minute and say this the same thing. You might have a a DD, a PhD, whatever you might be. You might have went to church since you was a child. You might have done all the religious acts there is, but once in the presence of God, you feel so little and no count. That's true. And I don't want to feel that way, but I need to feel that way. &gt;&gt; I need the presence of God to put me in my place, &gt;&gt; which is nothing but a sinner saved by grace. And we need to let that marinate. And that's what I'm saying. As you come to the close and that presence is there, if we're not careful, we'll just say, "Oh, that's a good sermon." Clap, clap, clap. And you've pulled it out of the marinade and it won't get the flavor. We're preaching these things for you to take the word of God personally and you make your life better. You let it convict you of sin. You let it take you to your home and apply the token. Paul said, "All things are lawful for me, but all things aren't expedient." You've got to make choices. And and I love the baptism of the Holy Spirit for what e what nominal people feel it is the rain, the blessings. And that's good. That's great. But if you're not careful, that actually becomes a substitute. And that's what they say. Look at God's with us. Look at all the miracles. And they're live contrary to the word of God. You say, we say, seek after the baptism of the Holy Spirit. You want to be baptized by his spirit, come into his presence. That's what the baptism of the Holy Spirit is. It's a man or a woman that's come into his presence, recognized how little they are, recognized how great they he is, recognized that they're a sinner, recognized that they need what he is, and they ask him to change them. And that nature changes. Anybody that ever gives you an evidence is giving you a substitute for the presence of God. You say, "Well, I would never be able to come into the presence of God." Thank God for Calvary. Thank God for the blood that there's a place that I can meet him under the shed blood. Thank God I can apply that blood to the post of my life and walk into his presence crying holy, holy, holy, holy is the lamb of God. Holy is the host of Israel. Thank you Lord for paying for my unworthiness and let the wonderful spirit of God's word move. He says, "We can come to church and talk and praise God and so forth, but oh brother, when we see him coming, something will be different in our heart." He and he he goes on to say here he says we might think that we keep the law of the church and recite all the creeds but once let us get a look at him the whole things changed all the way around. Yes sir. Sure. So I I want you to understand that I'm I'm I'm not wanting to bring condemnation, but I'm wanting to bring realization. I want to put him back where he belongs. Not the ministry, not our knowledge of the message, not our understanding of the revelation, but understanding that we are gathered here today, Lord, that we can come into your presence. &gt;&gt; We know we're sinners, but your presence changes things. It's his presence that heals the sick. &gt;&gt; It's not the power of your faith. It's your faith in that he's here and that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that he's presence. Every time in the prayer line that someone would come before the prophet, he said, "Oh, you feel that warm spirit on you." He says, "Oh, that's just him. He's here." And don't you want that? That's what you got to ask your heart, young people, old people, all of us. Do we want the presence of the Lord? Let's not get away from it. Let's get back to it. Let's go back to the way of a true prophet. Let's go back to how we fundamentally prepare our lives to come into his presence. Let's invite his presence. When you come to church, just don't run in here late. Come to church like you know he'll be here, like his presence is here, and that he's here to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask or think. So that's why we've asked so we you can let it marinate and you can think about it and you can apply it to your life. We can look in the mirror and see ourselves and then I believe with all our hearts we can start to say even so come quickly Lord Jesus God bless you. Uh uh you're Is this your Okay, you're ready. You want to be baptized then, sister? Good. God bless you. That's wonderful. Mag, you can guys go. We're going to go prepare for baptism. I know some of you may have to go. Uh but we're going to baptize this young uh lady. Uh, I think she's Magnus niece cousin. Okay. That means different things in different countries, you know. So, this is wonderful. Amen. It's great. This thrills my heart, you know, because there's nothing like giving your life to the Lord and trying to start on the path and just, you know, what the presence of God can do for her &gt;&gt; and her life. It's wonderful. Brother Billy, if you'd come and I don't know which deacon's going to help me baptize, but if we'll do, we'll do that. God bless you. Thank you for understanding my heart and the path I want to take. Certainly, you're not obligated to come here. You're not obligated to go down the road that I feel the Holy Spirit's leading the church, but you are obligated to what you heard on the tape. God bless you. Amen.

And it says, "And after him was Shamgar, the son of Anath, which slew the Palestinians, 600 men's with an ox god, and he also delivered Israel." Brother Brennan uh this bless the verse has blessed me tremendously. Brother Brunham, he explained that the shamgar is you and I. And uh this uh field is our mind. Every single day we wake up, we have to face the 600 evil spirits, demons ready to possess our bodies. We need to protect our families. And as we move into this new week, we need to cover ourselves, our families, our brothers and sisters under the blood of Lord Jesus Christ. Let's pray. Dear father God, thank you for this beautiful day that that you have brought in our lives for such a beautiful message by brother David. The only way forward is going backward and the backward is going to the word of God which is our absolute Lord. When we come to the word of God, we receive the revelation as uh we receive when we read the word uh uh it comes by hearing and uh uh is that much needed faith that we get when we read the word of God. Lord, I pray uh every single one of us here, Lord, you anoint us uh with your Holy Spirit. Cover us under your blood. All the brothers and sisters who are watching um through the online service, Lord, I pray you bless them as well. Lord, I pray as we move into uh this new week. Lord, may your presence be upon us, Lord. Also as we come back for the evening service, let that service be also blessed and everything and everything we do Lord we all only do it for the extension of your com of your glory of your kingdom and to glorify you Lord. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. Amen. [Music] It's amazing, man. Praise God. I you are dismissed this morning. Oh, and my my my joy you're serving my Jesus. more than I could explain the way I feel. He's singing unspeakable joy and full of glory. It's amazing my grace that I know is true. When I receive salvation, I felt like jubilation. When Jesus came and washed my sins away, he gives me strength and power to feast the midnight hour with all my heart and soul. I now can say my my my what a joy serving my Jesus more than I could expect the way I feel rejoicing I speak of all joy and full of glory it's amazing my praise God I know it's real oh my Jesus is my savior you.
