[8:07] [Music]
[8:17] [Music]
[8:24] Let's just go before him in prayer.
[8:27] [Music]
[8:29] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we
[8:32] come to you this morning, Lord, with
[8:34] open hearts, Lord, in expectation, Lord,
[8:38] what you would have for us,
[8:40] Lord. May each one here, Lord, have a
[8:44] open heart, Lord, prepared to receive.
[8:48] Lord, we know that the minister has
[8:50] already put himself aside and made
[8:53] himself a willing vessel and has prayed
[8:57] up and prepared his service, Lord,
[9:00] knowing that you're going to be the one
[9:03] in control, Lord. And Lord, and we know
[9:07] that
[9:08] it will be you speaking, Lord. and not
[9:11] our brother, Lord. And Lord, we're in
[9:14] expectation of what you have to say to
[9:16] us, Lord. And we've prepared our hearts,
[9:19] Lord, and made our way here, Lord, and
[9:23] we're willing to receive what you have
[9:26] for us, Lord.
[9:28] Lord, may you bless the service and
[9:32] bless each one who's made their way out.
[9:35] Lord, we
[9:37] we just want to
[9:39] receive what you have for us, Lord. And
[9:42] we're grateful that you've blessed us
[9:45] with the opportunity to be here, Lord.
[9:47] We thank you for the blood you shed for
[9:50] us and the life that you've given.
[9:54] Lord, we want to give back that love,
[9:56] Lord, that you once gave for us and that
[9:58] you give us each day. Lord, we want to
[10:01] show you that love, Lord. Lord, may we
[10:04] show that in our praise and worship,
[10:06] Lord, as we open our hearts and prepare
[10:09] for the word. We love you and praise you
[10:11] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[10:13] Amen.
[10:20] You may turn around and shake one
[10:22] another's hand.
[10:27] We'll turn and read out of Psalm 129 for
[10:31] our psalm reading.
[10:46] I'll read the first, you read the
[10:47] second, and we'll continue on and join
[10:49] together. In the last verse,
[10:53] it reads, "Many a time have they
[10:55] afflicted me from my youth. May Israel
[10:58] now say,
[11:06] The flowers plowed upon my back. They
[11:08] made long their furrows.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Let them all be confounded and turned
[11:17] back that hate Zion.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; Wherewith the mower fillth not his hand,
[11:27] nor he that bindeth sheav his bosom.
[11:31] Neither do they which go by say the
[11:33] blessing of the Lord be upon you. We
[11:36] bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[11:39] You may be seated. Let's sing. I know it
[11:42] was the blood.
[11:46] [Music]
[11:49] Oh, I know it was the blood. I know it

[11:58] for me.
[12:01] One day when I was gone, oh, he died
[12:05] upon that cross. Well, I know it was the
[12:09] blood for me. I know it was the blood.
[12:13] I knew it was the blood. Yes, I knew it
[12:17] was the blood. I knew it was the blood
[12:22] for me.

[12:37] Well, there's power in the blood.
[12:41] Power in the blood. Well, there's power
[12:45] in the blood for me.
[12:49] [Music]
[12:50] one day when I was lost. Oh, he died
[12:54] upon that cross. Well, there's power in
[12:58] the blood. Oh, there's healing in the
[13:01] blood. Oh, there's in the blood. There's
[13:07] in the blood.
[13:10] the blood for me.
[13:15] One day I was lost. Oh, he died. I hope
[13:20] that was
[13:22] in the blood. Oh, I know it was the
[13:26] blood. Well, I knew it was the blood.
[13:30] Yes, I knew it was the blood. I knew it
[13:35] was too for me
[13:42] [Music]
[13:44] on that cross
[13:47] [Music]
[13:49] for me.
[13:53] and bound in my heart. When the Lord
[13:58] comes, when all the saints of God are

[26:55] us a special
[27:30] [Music]
[27:38] I'm going to sing Down for His Glory,
[27:42] &gt;&gt; the ever living story.
[27:45] You know as the Bible teaches us that
[27:50] God
[27:52] God condescended and became one of us so
[27:56] we can be like him.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; And you know we thank the Lord for this
[28:01] message. Um brother Brandham teaches us
[28:05] that you know even the angels are so
[28:08] filthy in front of God that they say
[28:10] holy holy 24/7.
[28:13] And if it not for this message, you
[28:14] would have never known the standard that
[28:16] God requires.
[28:19] God required death because of sin. That
[28:22] he subjected his own self to his own
[28:24] law. But we thank God that the word has
[28:27] given us a better way, has given us an
[28:29] understanding of what it, you know, what
[28:32] he requires for us to be his bride. So I
[28:34] hope this is a blessing to you.
[28:40] down from his glory.
[28:47] Everliving
[28:49] story.
[28:54] My God and saving
[28:58] came
[29:01] and Jesus
[29:04] was his name.
[29:08] Morning
[29:10] in a manger
[29:14] [Music]
[29:16] to his own
[29:18] strangeanger
[29:22] [Music]
[29:25] of sorrows,
[29:27] tears
[29:29] and
[29:31] God.
[29:33] [Music]
[29:37] Oh, how I love
[29:42] him.
[29:45] How I
[29:47] adore
[29:49] you.
[29:52] My bread, my sunshine,
[29:59] my all
[30:01] and all
[30:06] the great
[30:08] creator

[30:53] of night,

[31:03] God gracious
[31:06] tender.
[31:07] [Music]
[31:10] He laid aside
[31:12] his splender
[31:14] [Music]
[31:17] and he stood in it
[31:21] to win to save
[31:25] my
[31:27] soul.
[31:30] [Music]
[31:32] Oh, how I love
[31:36] him. Thank you, Jesus. How I adore
[31:43] him,
[31:46] my bread, my sunshine.
[31:51] [Music]
[31:53] I
[31:55] adore
[32:00] the great creator.
[32:06] [Music]
[32:07] He became
[32:09] my savior
[32:13] [Music]
[32:14] and all God's fullness
[32:21] dwell
[32:23] in him
[32:26] [Music]
[32:28] without
[32:30] reluctance.
[32:35] Flesh and blood his substance.
[32:42] He took the form
[32:46] of man,
[32:49] revealed
[32:51] the hidden
[32:54] plan.
[32:56] Oh, glorious
[32:59] mystery
[33:04] sacrifice
[33:05] of Calary.

[34:33] him.
[34:36] My break, my sun.
[34:43] I
[34:46] in all
[34:51] the great
[34:53] creator.
[34:58] He became
[35:00] my savior
[35:05] and all God's fullness
[35:13] dwelling
[35:15] in him.
[35:19] [Music]
[35:26] I surely enjoyed that. I know you
[35:28] enjoyed it, too.
[35:32] We have an announcement here. Brother
[35:34] Adrian writes, "We want to thank the
[35:36] Lord for one more year of life for our
[35:38] son, Angel. May the Lord continue to
[35:41] bless him, guide him in all he does."
[35:45] Happy birthday, Angel.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:53] There's another birthday today, but he
[35:56] happens to be in a different
[36:00] country. Brother Billy, his birthday is
[36:02] today,
[36:03] &gt;&gt; so we'll have to get him when he gets
[36:04] back.
[36:06] We love Brother Billy.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have any other
[36:11] announcements. We want to remember
[36:13] Daniel. It was mentioned yesterday that
[36:15] there were some uh complications post
[36:17] surgery that took place and he's back in
[36:20] the hospital. So, we trust that the Lord
[36:21] can touch him and help him on his path
[36:24] of recovery. If you have any request and
[36:28] you came into the house of the Lord with
[36:29] something on your heart, make it known
[36:30] to him by the uplifting of your hands
[36:33] and trust that that allsufficient God
[36:36] who wanted to condescend cares about you
[36:40] and he's got an answer for you. and you
[36:42] can receive it by the preaching of the
[36:43] word.
[36:45] We also want to remember our pastor and
[36:47] sister Leslie and they they travel
[36:49] tomorrow morning. May God be with them,
[36:51] Lord, and just give them blessings and
[36:54] just walk with them in all that they do.
[36:57] We'll ask brother David Junior to come
[36:58] and take these needs before the
[37:00] congregation and the brothers that are
[37:01] taking the tithes and offering if they
[37:03] could please come up.
[37:07] Why don't we just go ahead and stand
[37:08] together just
[37:11] to give ourselves a a moment to just
[37:14] think about who we're approaching.
[37:18] Let's just bring our hearts together
[37:20] before him. Gracious heavenly father,
[37:23] &gt;&gt; yes,
[37:24] &gt;&gt; what a great privilege it is to bow our
[37:26] hearts and our heads before you and know
[37:28] that you hear the very petition of our
[37:30] heart. And Lord, that you're mindful of
[37:33] each need that's here in this building
[37:34] from the smallest to the eldest. Lord,
[37:37] there's nothing that's too small or too
[37:40] great, Father. And Lord, if we could
[37:42] just better understand your love for us,
[37:44] the care that you have, then Lord, our
[37:46] faith could rise up to believe that all
[37:48] things are possible. And Lord, as these
[37:51] requests have been spoken, Lord, we know
[37:53] that you're the God of the impossible.
[37:56] Father, where man could fail, you cannot
[37:59] fail. Lord, that your word will
[38:01] accomplish that which you send it forth
[38:03] to accomplish. And Lord, we're now
[38:05] speaking your word upon our lips,
[38:07] Father, that you're the Lord God that
[38:08] heals all our diseases. Father, that
[38:11] you're a present help, Lord, in the time
[38:12] of need. And Lord, as the need is great,
[38:15] Father, so much more than need me, dear
[38:18] Lord. And Father, now our hearts are
[38:20] looking even to what your word will
[38:22] accomplish. And Lord, it's you. your
[38:24] presence where you are, Father. Darkness
[38:26] cannot abide.
[38:29] All things are possible to them that
[38:32] believe. And Lord, you've given us a
[38:34] faith to believe. We're going to thank
[38:36] you for that. We're going to praise you,
[38:38] Father. We're looking now that just each
[38:42] one would be aware of your divine
[38:44] presence here, Lord. As we've gathered
[38:47] together as a body, Lord, we love you.
[38:50] You're the lovely one. You're welcome
[38:52] amongst us, Lord. Lord, you're welcome
[38:54] in every room of my heart, every place
[38:56] of my mind. I want to commit myself
[38:58] aresh to you this morning, Lord. If
[38:59] there's been anything I've held on to,
[39:01] Lord, if there's been any any idea,
[39:03] anything of myself that needs to be
[39:05] burned out, oh God, by the power of your
[39:08] of your word, Lord, by your precious
[39:10] presence, come but consume me aresh,
[39:12] Lord. Lord, as a body, we're sitting
[39:14] upon your altar this morning, Lord.
[39:17] We're asking you to come and do only
[39:19] that which you can do. Thank you for
[39:21] hearing the request of our hearts, for
[39:23] the needs that are spoken, our brother
[39:25] Daniel, Lord, and you deliver him,
[39:27] Father, from where he's at, the pain,
[39:29] the the anguish, Lord, that he in a
[39:32] greater way will know your love and care
[39:33] for him. And Lord, that our pastor and
[39:37] sister Lesie as they would travel, Lord,
[39:40] our hearts would be that they would stay
[39:41] here with us. And Lord, we wouldn't want
[39:44] them to go. We know though that you have
[39:46] a will and a path that he would walk in.
[39:49] Lord, we ask that you'd protect him,
[39:51] Lord, that your angels would go before
[39:52] him. And Lord, the burden that's on his
[39:54] heart to see your gospel furthered,
[39:57] Father, that that'll be delivered. And
[39:59] Lord, you know all things and we commit
[40:02] it to your hands, even this service, the
[40:04] rest of it. In the precious name of
[40:06] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.

[46:35] &gt;&gt; My gracious father,
[46:39] that's the motivation of every step we
[46:42] take every day is your coming back.
[46:50] some glad morning
[46:55] that dimensional open
[46:58] and we'll step from
[47:01] this unreal
[47:03] lost world
[47:05] into eternal reality
[47:09] forever
[47:12] to be with you.
[47:15] Father, may it become so real to us
[47:20] that we look up because we know our
[47:22] redemption drawth nigh.
[47:28] May the love that you have for us shed
[47:31] abroad in our heart
[47:33] to the lost and the hurting,
[47:36] Father, because we know it's the enemy.
[47:40] And we know that he who's in us is
[47:42] greater than he who's in the world.
[47:45] We ask you to bless our morning, Father.
[47:48] We ask that you'd minister to the needs
[47:51] of the people,
[47:53] that you'd heal our sick, that
[47:57] you would lift up the weary and
[47:59] brokenhearted.
[48:01] And that in you, Father, that we could
[48:03] see hope
[48:05] because all things are possible to them
[48:09] that believe. We ask this this morning
[48:12] in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen.
[48:16] And amen. God bless you. You may be
[48:18] seated.
[48:23] Certainly wonderful to be in the house
[48:26] of the Lord
[48:28] serving a God that you know that all
[48:31] things are possible.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it doesn't matter. It didn't
[48:35] say some things are possible.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; It said all things are possible. Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't know some things, he
[48:42] knows everything.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; So, you know, if if you know, they used
[48:46] to sing that song. I grew up with it all
[48:50] the time. It's about Santa Claus, you
[48:52] know. You say, "He knows if you've been
[48:54] naughty, he knows if you've been nice,
[48:56] you know." And I mean, I thought, man, I
[48:58] know somebody that knows that who's a
[49:00] whole lot more greater than some fake
[49:02] Santa Claus.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; But he knows.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? That's a good
[49:08] thing. because he knows what causes my
[49:11] failures. He knows how to fix me.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we certainly rejoice in that.
[49:18] Um, we have a visiting minister this
[49:20] morning, uh, Brother Zachary Wallace. I
[49:24] knew his grandfather,
[49:26] I knew his father, and now I know him.
[49:30] So, we're into the third generation
[49:34] here. Hallelujah. I sure hope he comes
[49:37] soon.
[49:39] Amen. So, I I want to thank everybody
[49:42] for yesterday. We had a wonderful day
[49:44] yesterday. A wonderful brother's
[49:46] breakfast. Thank brother Chris for that.
[49:48] Really encourage the brothers to come
[49:51] out to these breakfastes that they're
[49:53] really wonderful and just really
[49:55] heartlifting. Then we had our Sunday
[49:57] school picnic or whatever you'd like to
[50:00] call it, family, young family picnic.
[50:03] and uh brother Tim and sister Melinda,
[50:05] all the teachers, all the brothers that
[50:07] helped. It really was a great day. We
[50:10] thought through the rain and we had our
[50:13] young kids eating corn, raw corn, and
[50:16] playing in the mud and and all kinds of
[50:20] things. It was just it I'd like to had
[50:22] it all on film because it was just
[50:24] really a great time. I think the kids
[50:27] had a a wonderful time. So, uh, we just
[50:30] really, uh, appreciate that. We want to
[50:33] pray for brother Matthew. He's back east
[50:36] and he's been preaching and he'll be
[50:38] here to preach for us on the 24th and
[50:41] then he's got meetings all through
[50:42] November. So, we want to keep Brother
[50:45] Matthew in prayer. Brother Billy's in
[50:47] London. I think it's his birthday. So,
[50:50] um, no presents from us, Billy. You're
[50:53] you're too far away. But I'm sure he's
[50:56] streaming this morning and I think he
[51:00] has a meeting with the king and the so
[51:03] um the real king.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; The king of kings.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not some temporary throne. So
[51:13] anyway, and then uh brother Sergio's in
[51:17] Alta Oklahoma
[51:20] uh preaching for us. So, uh, and then
[51:22] don't forget communion Sunday. Uh,
[51:26] November 2nd, communion. We should all
[51:28] be there for communion because it's it's
[51:32] a wonderful time. Communion. Communion's
[51:34] got healing in it. It's got deliverance
[51:36] in. Got everything you need. Just humble
[51:39] yourself. Make your heart right with
[51:42] God. Make your heart right with your
[51:44] brothers and sisters. Come have
[51:46] communion and watch what God does for
[51:48] you. Amen. He longs for your fellowship.
[51:51] So as as the brothers mentioned, Lesie
[51:54] and I leave for Zambia
[51:57] tomorrow evening and we have meetings
[52:00] there the 24th, 25th and 26th uh for
[52:04] brother Ronnie Kabichi and the uh
[52:08] dedication of his new church uh his
[52:11] addition and remodel of his church. So
[52:14] we're looking for that. And then on
[52:16] November 7th and 8th, we'll be in Tucson
[52:20] uh having one of the services for
[52:23] brother Israel
[52:25] uh Poe there in Tucson, Arizona. And uh
[52:31] uh brother George Smith will be
[52:32] preaching there and brother uh George
[52:35] Ferguson. So that's uh if you want to
[52:39] drift out, that's fine. But our meetings
[52:41] are the following weekend. So, we have a
[52:44] lot on on our plates, but we want to
[52:47] keep busy. We want to keep going. All
[52:50] that we have, we want to do for the
[52:52] kingdom while we can still do it. You
[52:54] know what I mean? My bones ache, but
[52:57] they still got strength. So, I I want to
[53:00] be used up by God. I remember when they
[53:04] prayed for me, when they laid hands on
[53:06] me to uh I don't know what you call it,
[53:09] to ordain me, if you would use that
[53:12] terminology,
[53:13] they they asked the brothers asked the
[53:15] Lord to say, "May his candle be totally
[53:19] used up." And that's what I want to do.
[53:21] I want to be used up for the Lord. We've
[53:24] got a lot of young great preachers here
[53:26] in our church that can go forward. So,
[53:29] if we can do some work outside for the
[53:31] furthest of the kingdom, we'll certainly
[53:34] be uh wanting to do that. So, do you
[53:37] love them this morning?
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that God knows what you
[53:41] have need of
[53:43] &gt;&gt; before that you ever ask it? You know,
[53:47] um that's a great confidence. It used to
[53:52] scare me and now I I realized I read a
[53:55] story that brother Ram told about you
[53:58] know the story about when she that
[54:01] washing Jesus feet that you know and he
[54:05] said when that little prostitute stood
[54:07] there oh brother Mike and Ellen Parks
[54:11] are with us
[54:12] &gt;&gt; and this is here today because of what
[54:16] he helped us do
[54:18] &gt;&gt; I don't 20 years ago I Yes, brother
[54:22] Mike. So, I'm never forgot it. the time
[54:25] we sat there in the banker's office and
[54:28] and uh put all our paperwork together
[54:32] and and we're trying to get a little
[54:36] loan or something for this building next
[54:38] door and and sure enough the banker
[54:42] comes out and it was a guy that I
[54:44] happened to know and and that helped and
[54:46] then Mike closed the deal and so it
[54:49] didn't stop from there and we got a
[54:52] bigger church waiting in the skyline. So
[54:55] we appreciate you, brother, with all our
[54:57] heart. So we want you to uh to know
[55:00] that. But in the story,
[55:03] he talks about the the little lady and
[55:08] she said she saw him and she ran quick
[55:12] and took her money and bought some
[55:14] ointment
[55:16] and she stood back and she wanted to
[55:20] wash his feet.
[55:22] And she began to think the battle began
[55:27] to go on in her mind.
[55:30] And she said,
[55:32] "He will know where I got this money.
[55:38] He'll know
[55:40] what I had to do to pay for this money."
[55:45] And so she began to shrink back
[55:49] and be afraid because of what that he
[55:52] would know about her. But there's
[55:56] another part of her heart that spoke up
[55:58] and said, "But he's the only one that
[56:02] can help me."
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And
[56:09] there she went.
[56:11] And when she got done crying and weeping
[56:14] before him, she stepped up free
[56:20] &gt;&gt; to go with no more burdens. So he
[56:23] already knows this morning.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; So just let him come speak to your
[56:27] heart. He'll lift you up. He'll he'll do
[56:30] wonders. He'll guide you and direct you.
[56:33] So let's stand this morning
[56:40] and let's
[56:44] just
[56:47] uh maybe we'll just sing a little
[56:49] different song as we invite brother
[56:52] Zachary. It It's the one that you know
[56:57] uh stay. I think they call it stay.
[57:02] You know, you know what song that is.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Maybe if you got a mic over
[57:08] there, you can help me sing it. But you
[57:12] know, and it says, "I know what it's
[57:16] like is to be in the presence of the
[57:20] Lord." And maybe if you just let that
[57:22] presence come around you, you'll find
[57:25] out that he loves you.
[57:29] He's not ashamed of you. He died for
[57:31] you.
[57:33] But let's just let him come this
[57:35] morning. Let's let him know, Lord,
[57:37] you're welcome here.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; We can't we can't make it without you.
[57:46] And we just want you to surround our
[57:49] hearts this morning.
[57:51] I want to say I'm sorry.
[57:56] I want to leave my past behind and go
[58:00] forward.
[58:03] man
[58:06] [Music]
[58:14] to be in the presence of the Lord.
[58:23] I know what time it is
[58:30] because time
[58:32] [Music]
[58:38] And the bodies
[58:40] were
[58:43] [Music]
[58:47] families restored.
[58:50] [Music]
[58:55] Because we stay here
[59:02] in the presence of the Lord.
[59:09] No one had to say a word
[59:14] [Music]
[59:17] to make a sound.
[59:22] [Music]
[59:25] I give up everything
[59:28] [Music]
[59:33] for this treasure.
[59:40] I never wanted to
[59:45] [Music]
[59:51] change.
[59:56] I don't want you to know
[1:00:04] my heart is burning
[1:00:12] in your presence.
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:18] Oh, please
[1:00:22] stay.
[1:00:27] I don't want you to go.
[1:00:35] My heart is burning
[1:00:42] in your presence, Lord.
[1:00:50] I want
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:00:58] I want
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:06] and I want
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:14] Jesus.
[1:01:15] I want
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:22] I want more.
[1:01:29] I want more.
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:37] I want more.
[1:01:41] Jesus.
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire this morning
[1:01:54] is for more of him.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; You don't have to leave this place
[1:01:57] without more of him this morning. If
[1:02:00] you're desiring, if you're hungering,
[1:02:03] he's here to meet that hunger. He's here
[1:02:05] to meet that desire.
[1:02:07] I I just pray you came ready for church
[1:02:09] this morning. You know, a lot of people
[1:02:11] they they take a shower to come to
[1:02:13] church. That's fine. I appreciate that.
[1:02:16] I really do. Some people they brush
[1:02:19] their hair, you know, they get their
[1:02:20] their suit on. But did you pray this
[1:02:23] morning?
[1:02:25] Did you really get ready for church this
[1:02:27] morning and say, "God, I want to meet
[1:02:29] with you. I want you to speak to my
[1:02:31] heart. I want to hear from heaven today.
[1:02:33] Did you come ready for church today? or
[1:02:36] did you just come ready to meet your
[1:02:38] neighbor? Brothers and sisters, I want
[1:02:41] to meet with the Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:02:43] morning. It's just wonderful to be in
[1:02:46] his presence here.
[1:02:48] Bring you my my greetings. I I live in
[1:02:51] Ohio. I attend a church there at True
[1:02:54] Word Tabernacle with Brother Wayne
[1:02:56] Lawson and and uh bring you my greetings
[1:02:59] from there, but I'm originally from
[1:03:01] Arizona. So, if you've ever been out
[1:03:03] there and received a cannon salute, you
[1:03:05] you were at my dad's house. And uh so,
[1:03:08] we've known the the McGary family for
[1:03:10] for as long as I've been alive. And grew
[1:03:13] up around the dinner table hearing my
[1:03:14] dad tell people about the testimonies of
[1:03:17] God's grace and brother David's life.
[1:03:19] And and so, I've just grown up hearing
[1:03:21] about how God was so good to him and
[1:03:24] brought him through everything to lead
[1:03:26] him to the truth. And and so, it's just
[1:03:28] wonderful to be here with you now. And I
[1:03:31] appreciate the opportunity and the
[1:03:32] privilege to be here. And I I enjoyed
[1:03:35] the the fellowship we had with the the
[1:03:37] younger group yesterday. It was it was
[1:03:39] good and all the effort that goes into
[1:03:41] that. That's a tremendous amount of
[1:03:42] work. And and it's a labor of love
[1:03:44] because you know a lot of time the
[1:03:46] younger children might not even say
[1:03:47] thank you. But uh it's a real labor of
[1:03:50] of love for them. And you know yesterday
[1:03:52] we we took a thought on come follow me
[1:03:56] where Jesus is talking to that rich
[1:03:57] young ruler.
[1:03:58] And you know, we look at that and we
[1:04:00] say, "Oh, that's that's good for the
[1:04:02] kids." You know, remind them to follow
[1:04:04] Jesus. And that's true. But do you know
[1:04:07] who he is?
[1:04:10] Because Jesus Christ isn't off in
[1:04:11] Galilee somewhere. Jesus Christ is the
[1:04:14] word for this hour. And if you're going
[1:04:16] to follow Jesus Christ like that rich
[1:04:18] young ruler was given the opportunity,
[1:04:20] then you've got to forsake everything.
[1:04:22] You've got to forsake your own ideas.
[1:04:23] You got to forsake your own thinking,
[1:04:25] your own teachings. You got to lay
[1:04:26] everything aside and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:04:28] following you and you only." And that
[1:04:31] gets to be where it's a little more than
[1:04:32] a Sunday school lesson. It's something
[1:04:34] that hits us right in the heart because
[1:04:36] I want to give him my all. I want to
[1:04:38] follow him with everything I have. Not a
[1:04:40] not a historical Jesus off in Galilee
[1:04:43] somewhere, but the present tense Lord
[1:04:45] Jesus Christ. And it's just uh good time
[1:04:49] yesterday, and I'm expecting a a good
[1:04:51] time in the Lord this morning. And if we
[1:04:54] could just go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:04:56] Lord, we we love you, Lord. And we're so
[1:04:59] thankful to be gathered together with
[1:05:02] saints of like precious faith, Lord, and
[1:05:05] to feel your presence here among us. To
[1:05:07] know that according to your word that
[1:05:09] you promised you would be here, Lord,
[1:05:10] and and to recognize your presence among
[1:05:13] your people. And we just ask that you
[1:05:15] would have your way in the service this
[1:05:17] morning, Lord. And I just ask that you
[1:05:19] would take this unprofitable servant,
[1:05:22] Lord, and you would use me to express
[1:05:24] your thoughts to your people this
[1:05:25] morning. We just want to yield ourselves
[1:05:28] to you and may you have your way among
[1:05:30] us. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:05:34] If we could just read in the book of
[1:05:36] Mark, the 16th chapter, and uh verse 15,
[1:05:40] we'll take a a reading from there just
[1:05:43] real short. uh something that I'm sure
[1:05:46] we all have memorized, but
[1:05:49] something I hope we never forget.
[1:06:04] Mark 16 and 15.
[1:06:10] It's Jesus speaking to his disciples.
[1:06:13] He said unto them, "Go ye into all the
[1:06:15] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:06:19] creature." You can be seated this
[1:06:21] morning. Just want to take a thought on
[1:06:24] on the true gospel. The true gospel. And
[1:06:28] and and you know, there's the the word
[1:06:30] gospel, it it means good news. And and
[1:06:34] so there's a lot of people that go
[1:06:35] around and they they say they've got
[1:06:37] some good news to share with you and
[1:06:38] they say, "Listen, you know, the the
[1:06:40] economy is going up. you know, things
[1:06:42] are looking better and they they want to
[1:06:44] tell you that's the good news. But you
[1:06:46] know what? That's not the good news
[1:06:47] because the economy is up one day and
[1:06:49] what happens the next day? It's down the
[1:06:51] next day. And and so there's the up and
[1:06:53] the down of the economy. That that's not
[1:06:54] the good news we're talking about. We're
[1:06:56] not talking about going around and and
[1:06:58] telling everybody, you know, America's
[1:07:00] the the best country in the world. You
[1:07:01] know, I do appreciate it, but it has its
[1:07:03] ups and downs, too. And and everything
[1:07:06] that you might look at and say, "Well,
[1:07:07] this is the good news. I want everybody
[1:07:09] to know about this. It'll have a time
[1:07:11] when it's good and then there will be a
[1:07:12] season when it's down. But the gospel,
[1:07:15] the good news is the fact that Jesus
[1:07:18] Christ is raised from the dead.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; And that's true yesterday. That's true
[1:07:22] today. That'll be true tomorrow. There's
[1:07:23] no changing the reality that my Lord
[1:07:26] Jesus has raised from the dead. And so
[1:07:28] that is the true gospel. It's the news
[1:07:31] that Jesus Christ is not dead, but he's
[1:07:34] alive. And I want to look a little bit
[1:07:36] about what that means for us in in
[1:07:38] present tense and and how that that that
[1:07:40] has an impact. It has a meaning for us
[1:07:43] today. And and back uh I I've had the
[1:07:46] opportunity to travel for mission work
[1:07:49] the last few years. I I really
[1:07:50] appreciate brother David having a heart
[1:07:53] for for missions and and to go out and
[1:07:55] to preach this gospel to every creature
[1:07:57] because it's needful because we want to
[1:07:59] go home and there's still people there
[1:08:01] that need to hear the gospel. And and
[1:08:03] last week I I got to be over in in
[1:08:06] Pakistan up north of India there. It's a
[1:08:08] it's an Islamic nation. And we we were
[1:08:10] visiting with the people there. And I
[1:08:12] and this thought really just began to
[1:08:13] burn in my heart of of what what we're
[1:08:16] we're inviting these people to church.
[1:08:18] We're inviting these people to come and
[1:08:20] and and come to the church. But what
[1:08:23] what are we telling these people? What
[1:08:25] what is it that we're trying to bring
[1:08:27] them to? Because you know the the the
[1:08:29] Muslims, they have the religions. We we
[1:08:31] have the Hindus there. We have all of
[1:08:33] these different groups. We have the
[1:08:34] Catholics, very strong Catholic
[1:08:36] community. We have all these different
[1:08:37] denominations, different religions
[1:08:39] gathered around and we're inviting them,
[1:08:41] come on over to the church.
[1:08:44] But what are we inviting them to?
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; What are we presenting to them? Are we
[1:08:50] just telling them, "Oh, well, come and
[1:08:51] and and and find another religion."
[1:08:54] Are we telling them just, you know, come
[1:08:56] to come to this church and and you know,
[1:08:58] you can have a different lifestyle? What
[1:09:01] are we actually presenting to them with?
[1:09:03] Are we just coming together to say,
[1:09:05] "Hey, this is where we gather on
[1:09:06] Sundays. You can gather together with
[1:09:08] us." We sing a few songs. We hear some
[1:09:10] preaching. And then we go back home and
[1:09:12] and and we just live the same life we've
[1:09:14] always lived and there's no change.
[1:09:15] There's no power. There's no reality.
[1:09:17] What are we presenting to the people?
[1:09:19] and and it just began to burn in my
[1:09:21] heart that we're presenting them with
[1:09:23] the gospel and and and the true gospel,
[1:09:26] not a not a denominational gospel of
[1:09:28] just come and join and and be a part of
[1:09:30] the church and be a member and like
[1:09:32] that's not what we're presenting to the
[1:09:34] people as church membership. We're not
[1:09:36] presenting to the people an identity
[1:09:38] that you have a new name and you're
[1:09:39] called a Christian and and you go to
[1:09:41] church and you know you can you can even
[1:09:43] you can put it on your your ID in those
[1:09:45] countries. you can put on there, I am a
[1:09:47] Christian or I am a Muslim. But that's
[1:09:48] not what I'm talking about when I talk
[1:09:50] about the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm
[1:09:52] talking about something that has a power
[1:09:54] in it. I'm talking about something that
[1:09:56] has a reality in it. I'm talking about a
[1:09:58] living Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; That is the gospel. That's the good
[1:10:03] news. And and I want to go through a few
[1:10:05] things the prophet mentioned here that
[1:10:07] kind of sets a tone for the thought this
[1:10:09] morning.
[1:10:10] He says here in God's provided approach
[1:10:12] to divine fellowship, I say this that
[1:10:14] the gospel yet in its simplicity
[1:10:17] preached in the power of the blood is
[1:10:20] the greatest drawing card the world has
[1:10:22] ever knowed. He says, "And believe thou
[1:10:25] this, give us some more Baptists like
[1:10:27] John. He stirred the regions." What was
[1:10:29] it? His eloquency? No. Because he had no
[1:10:32] such great speech. Uh no, it was
[1:10:35] psychology. No, he preached Christ. And
[1:10:38] the preaching of Christ will stir the
[1:10:41] people it's true. No matter if it's
[1:10:44] simplicity, it's just the greatest
[1:10:46] drawing card the world ever knowed is
[1:10:48] the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he says here, and I believe this
[1:10:55] this isn't just true for for you know,
[1:10:57] Jeffersonville where he was talking, but
[1:10:59] it's it's true of of Texas right down
[1:11:01] here. He says that's what we need. what
[1:11:03] we that's what some of these churches
[1:11:05] around Louisville and Jeffersonville and
[1:11:06] New Albany need. It's a good
[1:11:09] old-fashioned shaking down God sent Holy
[1:11:11] Ghost revival. Then you can have a
[1:11:14] healing service and decent and in order
[1:11:16] and and God will bless and the altars
[1:11:17] will be full and and you don't need some
[1:11:19] new theology. You need the Holy Spirit
[1:11:22] preached in its power. Though in
[1:11:25] simplicity, it's the greatest drawing
[1:11:27] card the world's ever had. Oh, to know
[1:11:30] that I have the greatest drawing card
[1:11:32] the world's ever had. It's the
[1:11:34] simplicity of the gospel of Jesus
[1:11:37] Christ. The news that my God's not dead.
[1:11:39] He's not in a grave. He's not back 2,000
[1:11:42] years ago. But he's Jesus Christ the
[1:11:44] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:11:46] all the power he ever had when he walked
[1:11:48] in Nazareth is right here in this
[1:11:50] building this morning. That is some good
[1:11:52] news.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, the good news of the gospel of Jesus
[1:11:57] Christ. and he told his disciples, "Go
[1:12:01] into all the world and preach the
[1:12:03] gospel." Now, the preaching of the
[1:12:05] gospel, it's not just a a teaching of
[1:12:09] theory. It's not just a teaching of a a
[1:12:12] standard of theology or or some kind of
[1:12:15] a seminary teaching. It's it's something
[1:12:18] beyond that. It's something more than
[1:12:20] that. And and I I appreciate doctrine,
[1:12:22] and we need doctrine. You've got to have
[1:12:24] it. I appreciate, you know, teaching.
[1:12:26] It's good. We've got to have it. That's
[1:12:28] important. If you're not teaching the
[1:12:29] word of God, then you know, you're
[1:12:31] you're way off in the wrong direction.
[1:12:33] But there's something more than just a
[1:12:36] talking about the word of God. There's
[1:12:38] something more than just a well, you
[1:12:40] know, you go to the denominations, you
[1:12:42] go to these churches out here and
[1:12:44] they'll say, John 3:16, yes, I believe
[1:12:46] it. And that's good. You should believe
[1:12:48] it.
[1:12:51] This this church here had better be a
[1:12:53] word church. If this church here is not
[1:12:55] a word church, then you guys need to get
[1:12:57] back to the foundation and establish it
[1:13:00] as a word church. It's got to be a
[1:13:02] word-based solid church. And that's
[1:13:04] wonderful. That's important. You've got
[1:13:06] to have it. I' I've been to churches
[1:13:08] that weren't that way. And brother, it's
[1:13:10] rough to preach there because they ain't
[1:13:11] got a clue what you're talking about.
[1:13:13] You talk about the word and and they
[1:13:15] don't know what where you're at because
[1:13:16] they don't know the word of God. And so
[1:13:18] we we must know the word. And that's
[1:13:20] important. And we we recognize in
[1:13:22] Genesis or in John 1:1 it says in the
[1:13:24] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:13:27] with God and the word was God and the
[1:13:30] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:13:33] We we see that that condescending of God
[1:13:35] and and so we recognize that that God is
[1:13:37] the word and and and that's who he is.
[1:13:40] That's his identity. And and I but I
[1:13:42] want to re you recognize that it's not
[1:13:45] just when we talk about in the beginning
[1:13:48] was the word. We're not talking about a
[1:13:50] a book floating around up in space
[1:13:52] somewhere.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; When we talk about the logos, you have
[1:13:56] that picture there. Uh when we talk
[1:13:59] about the logos, we're not talking about
[1:14:01] a a a a theory or a a a bunch of pages.
[1:14:05] We're talking about the pillar of fire.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about. We're
[1:14:10] talking about a person. The person that
[1:14:12] we see over the the prophet of God
[1:14:14] there, that was not just a a a book.
[1:14:18] That is a person. It's the logos. It's
[1:14:20] Jesus Christ. And that's the one we're
[1:14:22] talking about that was in the beginning.
[1:14:24] The pillar of fire. Now, that pillar of
[1:14:26] fire is also the anointing. It's the
[1:14:28] Holy Ghost. It's the when you get the
[1:14:31] word, not just in letter form, not just
[1:14:34] in page, but when you get it in fire
[1:14:36] form, when you get it in power form, now
[1:14:38] you've got something that'll put the
[1:14:40] dynamics back into the church. And so,
[1:14:42] when when we say we want the word in our
[1:14:45] church, what are we talking about?
[1:14:48] Oh, absolutely. We're talking about the
[1:14:50] Bible 100%.
[1:14:52] But it's not a dead letter.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; It's a person.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; In the Perkamian church age, the prophet
[1:14:59] of God says, uh, speaking how Christ is
[1:15:02] is speaking to that church and drawing
[1:15:04] them to himself and and he says, "I am
[1:15:06] the word." If you want deity in your
[1:15:09] midst, then welcome and receive the
[1:15:12] word. Don't ever let anyone or anything
[1:15:15] get between you and that word. And he
[1:15:19] goes on a little bit later to say, I
[1:15:21] wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[1:15:24] with the word in our midst. Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Second Timothy 3:15, he speaking there
[1:15:34] and Paul to Timothy. He says, "From a
[1:15:37] child, you have known the holy
[1:15:38] scriptures, which are able to make thee
[1:15:40] wise unto salvation through the faith
[1:15:42] which is in Christ Jesus. And all
[1:15:44] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[1:15:46] and is profitable for doctrine, for
[1:15:48] reproof, for correction, for instruction
[1:15:50] and righteousness, that the man of God
[1:15:52] may be perfect and thoroughly furnished
[1:15:55] unto all good works. The word of God,
[1:15:58] it's the it's it's a foundation. It's
[1:16:00] the the the doctrine we bring for the
[1:16:02] the church. It's wonderful. And and in
[1:16:04] Isaiah 28, it tells us that precept must
[1:16:07] be upon precept and line upon line and
[1:16:10] here a little and there a little. don't
[1:16:11] just take, you know, one little one
[1:16:13] little line in there and create a whole
[1:16:15] uh doctrine out of it. It it lines up.
[1:16:18] This scripture runs in continuity. It
[1:16:20] runs in harmony. And if you ever try to
[1:16:22] take one little verse and set it off by
[1:16:24] itself and and make something out of it
[1:16:26] that it it's not, you'll get yourself
[1:16:28] all out of cater trying to build the the
[1:16:30] church of God. But it's line upon line,
[1:16:32] word upon word, and it grows and it
[1:16:35] builds. But I it's growing up into a
[1:16:38] body, a word body. And that's the word
[1:16:41] that's come in this hour. It wasn't just
[1:16:44] a a Lutheran doctrine of just shall live
[1:16:46] by faith. It's that plus plus more. It's
[1:16:49] not just a Wesleyan doctrine of of
[1:16:51] sanctification and you should live a
[1:16:53] Christian life. The word has been adding
[1:16:55] line upon line, word upon word. And it's
[1:16:57] been growing up until it's come now in
[1:16:59] this hour. We have the fullness of the
[1:17:02] word. We have not just a part of the
[1:17:04] word, a part of the revelation. We have
[1:17:06] the fullness of the word unfolded to us
[1:17:08] in this hour which is that logos again
[1:17:12] here in the sermon things that are to be
[1:17:14] the prophet of God. He says now if if if
[1:17:17] we are those attributes of God are you
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; are you one of those attributes of God?
[1:17:25] If we are those attributes of God we
[1:17:28] cannot live by creeds. We cannot live by
[1:17:31] denominationalism. We must live by the
[1:17:34] word because the bride is a part of the
[1:17:36] bridegroom like any wife is a part of
[1:17:38] her husband. Therefore, we must be that
[1:17:42] word bride. And what is that word bride?
[1:17:45] The manifestation of this hour. The
[1:17:47] bride not a creed or a denomination but
[1:17:50] a living oracle of God. A living
[1:17:53] attribute of God displaying to the world
[1:17:55] the attributes of God in the formation
[1:17:58] of the bride. that's to be expressed in
[1:18:01] this hour that we're now living. The
[1:18:03] attributes of God being expressed in the
[1:18:06] formation of the bride. But I want you
[1:18:08] to notice, it's not a dead bride.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; It's a living bride. It's a living word.
[1:18:13] It's a living manifestation. It's an
[1:18:15] expression
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; of the word of God in shoe leather.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; And what was Christ? What was Jesus? He
[1:18:24] was the word made flesh. Invisible
[1:18:27] union. He says, he says, "And now the
[1:18:30] word, the word is becoming flesh, and
[1:18:31] the flesh is becoming word."
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Second Corinthians, he says, "Who also
[1:18:37] hath made us able ministers of the New
[1:18:39] Testament, not of the letter,
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; but of the spirit. For the letter kleth,
[1:18:44] but the spirit giveth life." Th those
[1:18:48] Pharisees, they were so set on the the
[1:18:51] word, the word, the word, which it was
[1:18:53] the word. They had the commandments and
[1:18:55] they were so fixated on the letter of it
[1:18:57] that when the flesh of the word came
[1:19:00] manifested in front of them, they
[1:19:01] rejected it and they crucified it
[1:19:04] because they could not see the
[1:19:06] manifestation of that word.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Looked it right in the eye and they
[1:19:11] said, "You're claiming to be God.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; That you're a man and you're making
[1:19:16] yourself God." And it was God making
[1:19:18] himself man. And they're looking at him
[1:19:21] and they're saying what's you know
[1:19:24] you're saying that you knew Moses like
[1:19:26] he says well yes before Moses was I am
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; they looked at him they knew the word
[1:19:36] they had it memorized
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; but they didn't know the person
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; you know I grew up as a young boy all of
[1:19:46] my life hearing this message hearing
[1:19:47] tapes played at night and hearing and
[1:19:50] hearing it and that's wonderful. I
[1:19:51] appreciate it so much and I have a I
[1:19:54] have a real good knowledge of the word
[1:19:56] and I'm thankful for that.
[1:19:59] But don't let me miss the person
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; because it's not to know the knowledge.
[1:20:06] That's not where the life is at. It's
[1:20:07] not just to have head knowledge and and
[1:20:09] teaching and education. That's not where
[1:20:12] the power of almighty God is laying at.
[1:20:14] But when you know the person, when you
[1:20:17] can recognize who he is, and you can
[1:20:19] welcome him, the word into your life,
[1:20:22] then deity has come down and when deity
[1:20:24] is there, all power in heavens and earth
[1:20:27] is present to give you whatsoever you
[1:20:29] have need of.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; The word is not a theory. It's not a
[1:20:35] teaching. It's not knowledge. The word
[1:20:38] is a person. It is Jesus Christ.
[1:20:43] Oh, I ask you, are you tired of
[1:20:45] religion? Religion and forms of man and
[1:20:48] traditions and all of these different
[1:20:50] things that they bring in as a dead type
[1:20:53] of a religion and oh, just go to this
[1:20:55] place and and put your offering in and
[1:20:57] tell your Hail Mary and and do this and
[1:20:59] and make sure you make your pilgrimage
[1:21:01] to to Mecca or whatever the forms and
[1:21:04] the religion of man. I'm not interested
[1:21:06] in religion, but I do know a person.
[1:21:13] Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Christian life is not about dead
[1:21:18] traditions and forms and oh, we just go
[1:21:20] to church on Sunday and then we go home
[1:21:22] and and we go through back to work and
[1:21:24] then we go be we become a Christian
[1:21:26] again on Sunday. No, it's a re everyday
[1:21:29] present tense reality where you have the
[1:21:32] power of almighty God flowing through
[1:21:34] your vessel.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; My God's not dead.
[1:21:41] And the gospel I've been commissioned to
[1:21:44] preach is tell everybody I come in
[1:21:46] contact with that he is alive.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; But in this last day there there is a a
[1:21:53] a spirit that's come down on the age and
[1:21:56] and we and it speaks of it in 2 Timothy
[1:21:59] 3 that the last day they would be
[1:22:01] treaders traitors heavy heavy
[1:22:03] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:22:06] lovers of God. Now, I want you to
[1:22:08] recognize they love God. They go to
[1:22:11] church. They call themselves Christian.
[1:22:13] But you know what they love more than
[1:22:15] going to church? Their own pleasure,
[1:22:18] their own comfort. You know what they
[1:22:20] they they love? Oh, I love God. I
[1:22:22] believe in God. Yes. You know, I believe
[1:22:24] those things are true. That's good.
[1:22:26] That's wonderful. But I'd rather do my
[1:22:28] own thing. I love my own things more
[1:22:31] than God. You stay in that condition and
[1:22:33] you'll be the exact same way that rich
[1:22:35] young ruler was when he lifted up his
[1:22:37] eyes in hell and realized he'd missed
[1:22:39] his opportunity to follow Jesus Christ.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Set your affection singular. Set your
[1:22:46] affection on things above, not on things
[1:22:49] down here.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And in this last day, they will be that
[1:22:52] way. They'll be heady, high-minded,
[1:22:54] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:22:56] God, having a form of godliness.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; A form of godliness. They will look like
[1:23:02] God. Godliness is to be like God. And
[1:23:04] they'll have a form and they will have a
[1:23:06] form of godliness, but they'll deny the
[1:23:10] power thereof. From such turn away. I'm
[1:23:14] not interested in a form of godliness.
[1:23:17] I'm not interested in looking the part
[1:23:19] and and acting the part. What I want is
[1:23:21] the power of almighty God coming down
[1:23:23] inside of me and him expressing himself
[1:23:26] in reality. Amen.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; God is not interested in manmade
[1:23:33] religion or man-made forms or man-made
[1:23:36] creeds or dogmas. What he's looking for
[1:23:38] is a religion with power in it.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; And the prophet in the pardon, he says,
[1:23:42] "But when a church comes under the blood
[1:23:44] of Jesus Christ with the token of the
[1:23:47] Holy Spirit upon them, then you're going
[1:23:49] to see brotherhood again. You're going
[1:23:51] to see a church full of power. You're
[1:23:54] going to And God hates a powerless
[1:23:57] religion. It's got to be power.
[1:23:59] Certainly, it's a power to save a man
[1:24:01] from sin. It's a power that can do signs
[1:24:03] and wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ
[1:24:06] promised.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; If he promised it,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; then I'm going to experience it.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; If he promised that there would be a
[1:24:16] power of God that would save a sinner,
[1:24:18] then that power is available to me. And
[1:24:20] I'm not just talking about that by
[1:24:22] theory. I experienced it.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; The power of God that saved me from my
[1:24:28] sins is the same power of God that's
[1:24:30] dwelling inside of me by the baptism of
[1:24:33] the Holy Ghost that these signs shall
[1:24:35] follow them that believe.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, you look in that in Mark 16 there
[1:24:41] when when when they heard because the
[1:24:44] disciples were there and Mary and and
[1:24:46] the different ones went to the to the
[1:24:48] tomb and they go to there and they they
[1:24:50] come and they look in
[1:24:52] and they find out he's not in the grave.
[1:24:56] He's not here. And they're wondering
[1:24:59] what's going on. And they get a message.
[1:25:01] He's not dead. He's alive.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And then they're told, "Go tell my
[1:25:07] disciples."
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Go tell him. Go tell him he's not in the
[1:25:11] grave. Go tell him he's not back 2,000
[1:25:14] years ago. Go tell him he's not dead in
[1:25:16] some religious organization. But my God
[1:25:19] is alive and he has risen as he said he
[1:25:22] would be.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have seen a resurrection out of
[1:25:26] dark denominationalism in this hour and
[1:25:29] my God is alive.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, when they But you see this here and
[1:25:34] and it's so striking to consider this.
[1:25:36] These are the disciples. These are the
[1:25:39] ones that walked with Jesus. They were,
[1:25:41] you know, we would say the the greatest
[1:25:43] spiritual leaders of the day in in the
[1:25:45] real sense of the word. But when they
[1:25:48] heard he was alive, scripture says they
[1:25:52] did not believe it.
[1:25:55] A little bit later he appears to two
[1:25:57] walking down the road and says that he
[1:26:01] told they to he appeared to them and
[1:26:02] walked with him in the country. Mark
[1:26:04] 16:12 and went through the country with
[1:26:06] him and then he went they went and told
[1:26:08] it under the residue and neither
[1:26:10] believed they them.
[1:26:15] There's something about mankind that
[1:26:18] just can't accept the reality of the
[1:26:22] resurrection.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; There's a unbelief that just sits there
[1:26:27] and says, "No, no, he can't be alive."
[1:26:30] Like there, no, no, you know, you
[1:26:32] you're, you know, you're you're just,
[1:26:35] you know, you're just enthused. You're
[1:26:36] just imagining. You just had a
[1:26:38] hallucination. You just
[1:26:41] denying
[1:26:43] could not accept that he was alive.
[1:26:46] And afterward, Mark 16:14, "And
[1:26:48] afterward he appeared unto the 11 as
[1:26:50] they sat at me, and upraided them with
[1:26:53] their unbelief and hardness of heart,
[1:26:56] because they believed not them which had
[1:26:59] seen him after he was risen."
[1:27:06] There was those who had seen him after
[1:27:08] he was risen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; And their job was to go and tell the
[1:27:13] others he's alive.
[1:27:16] Do I have some witnesses here this
[1:27:18] morning that have seen him? They know
[1:27:20] him personally. Not just what grandpa
[1:27:22] said, not just what some church father
[1:27:24] wrote in a book somewhere, but they've
[1:27:26] met him personally. They know him in the
[1:27:29] power of his resurrection. and they can
[1:27:32] stand there as a witness and say, "He's
[1:27:34] not in a grave. He's not dead. He's not
[1:27:36] buried by some church denominationalism,
[1:27:39] but my God is alive and he has the same
[1:27:42] power he ever had."
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, when Jesus sent out the disciples,
[1:27:47] they went out as witnesses of the
[1:27:49] resurrection.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, what we need today is some
[1:27:53] witnesses. Some witnesses that can go
[1:27:56] out to work and tell them the gospel of
[1:27:58] Jesus Christ. Because you know you you
[1:28:01] may never have a chance to travel to
[1:28:03] Pakistan like I did last week or to
[1:28:05] Zambia like brother David next week but
[1:28:07] somebody's got to go to your workplace
[1:28:10] and share the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:28:12] that our God is not dead but he's alive
[1:28:15] and that there's a power there to meet
[1:28:17] the need of the people.
[1:28:21] Yes, sir.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, this world. What they're dying for,
[1:28:24] what they're needing, what they're
[1:28:25] longing for is the power of the
[1:28:28] resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; That's what they have need of. That's
[1:28:32] what they're looking for. This world,
[1:28:34] they're searching for for some answer,
[1:28:36] for some solution. What's the answer to
[1:28:38] all our our problems? And how do we
[1:28:40] bring peace to the earth? And and how do
[1:28:42] we deal with all the cancers and the
[1:28:44] sicknesses and all the problems? Oh, the
[1:28:46] economic problems. I mean, you look
[1:28:48] around, there's just problems
[1:28:49] everywhere.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Every level you look at it, you look at
[1:28:54] the scientific community and and they're
[1:28:56] all worried about where the AI is going
[1:28:58] to take off to and they're creating AI
[1:28:59] armies that they're worried going to
[1:29:01] cause problems and and well, if we don't
[1:29:02] do it, we somebody else will, we better
[1:29:04] get our own army and and they're they're
[1:29:06] racing over here and then you've got
[1:29:07] your nuclear bombs over there and
[1:29:08] they're trying to figure out, well,
[1:29:09] well, if they shoot their nuclear bombs,
[1:29:11] how do we handle this? They've got
[1:29:12] nothing but problems over there. You
[1:29:14] look at the world nations borders and
[1:29:16] the the battles that are being fought
[1:29:17] over whose land is this and who's this
[1:29:19] belong to and which country is going to
[1:29:21] take over this and and now you got
[1:29:22] pandemics and you got cancer running
[1:29:24] rampant. You got people becoming sick
[1:29:26] with every kind of disease and diabetes
[1:29:28] sweeping the planet and everywhere you
[1:29:31] look it's a mess.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; There's problems on every hand. There is
[1:29:37] no person that has the answer.
[1:29:43] But I got it.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; It's my Lord Jesus Christ. And he is
[1:29:50] alive and he is well and he's living in
[1:29:53] me to tell that he's just the same as he
[1:29:56] ever was.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, but when you begin to tell people of
[1:30:00] the gospel, if there's not something
[1:30:01] inside of them to respond, they think
[1:30:03] you've gone crazy
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; and you've got the thing that the whole
[1:30:07] world needs.
[1:30:10] Oh, you know, the devil, he he really he
[1:30:13] he does not want you to know that Jesus
[1:30:16] Christ is raised from the dead. And so,
[1:30:18] he'll do everything he can to put an
[1:30:20] unbelief, to put a question mark, to put
[1:30:22] a doubt. Is he really alive? Is, you
[1:30:25] know, they'll say, "Oh, well, he raised
[1:30:26] from the dead. Oh, yes, Jesus raised
[1:30:28] from the dead, but he's still back there
[1:30:30] in Galilee somewhere.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus raised from the dead, but he
[1:30:35] stayed in the book of Acts and didn't go
[1:30:36] anywhere else.
[1:30:38] Put him back somewhere in history. Put
[1:30:41] him back somewhere in and and some other
[1:30:43] day in some other age. Oh, well, if if
[1:30:45] Jesus Okay, I'll I'll I'll let you
[1:30:47] believe it. I'll let you believe Jesus
[1:30:49] raised from the dead. But
[1:30:53] he says, "Listen, his his power to heal
[1:30:56] that stopped with the apostles, the Holy
[1:30:59] Ghost, that that that's no longer
[1:31:01] relevant for this day. that ceased with
[1:31:02] the with the apostolic age and and all
[1:31:05] these different lies the devil begins to
[1:31:07] put. What he's trying to do is keep you
[1:31:10] from the benefits of the resurrection.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; The benefits of the resurrection. He'll
[1:31:16] say, "Okay, I I'll if you have to
[1:31:18] believe that he raised from the dead,
[1:31:20] okay, but you can't believe that there's
[1:31:24] any benefit for your personal life from
[1:31:26] his resurrection. You you if you've got
[1:31:28] sickness, you just got to take that all
[1:31:30] the way to your grave. If you got if you
[1:31:32] got problems in your family and you've
[1:31:33] got unsaved loved ones, well, you know,
[1:31:35] there's nothing. There's no power there
[1:31:36] to go out and help them. If you've got
[1:31:38] situations that you don't know what to
[1:31:39] do about, well, you just have to sit
[1:31:41] there in your misery and hope something
[1:31:43] happens to make it better because God
[1:31:45] doesn't have the power to fix your
[1:31:47] situation. That's what the devil's
[1:31:48] putting into your mind. He'll put into
[1:31:50] your mind, no, that was for some other
[1:31:52] day. That was for the prophet. That was
[1:31:54] for Moses. That was for William
[1:31:55] Brandham. That was for And he's always
[1:31:57] telling you, but it's not for you.
[1:32:00] trying to steal the benefits of the
[1:32:03] resurrection of Jesus Christ away from
[1:32:05] your life. If he can get you to believe
[1:32:07] he didn't raise, oh, he's happy. But if
[1:32:10] he's if you've if you're convinced that
[1:32:12] he raised from the dead, then he'll
[1:32:13] start to tell you, but it's not for you.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; You know what? He's a liar.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Or if the devil can convince you that
[1:32:23] Jesus didn't raise from the dead, then
[1:32:25] there's no benefits. There's no
[1:32:26] blessings. There's because if he didn't
[1:32:29] raise, what that means is he wasn't
[1:32:31] worthy
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; because it had it had to be a sinless
[1:32:36] one that died and only a sinless one
[1:32:38] could raise. If he did not raise from
[1:32:41] the dead, there is no healing for your
[1:32:43] body. If he did not raise from the dead,
[1:32:45] there is no forgiveness for your sins
[1:32:47] because there has not been a worthy
[1:32:49] sacrifice. But if he raised from the
[1:32:51] dead, then he was worthy to pay the
[1:32:55] price. He was accepted. And if he is
[1:32:58] worthy, then my sins are gone. They've
[1:33:01] been washed in the blood of the lamb. If
[1:33:03] he was worthy, then my sickness has
[1:33:06] already been healed. If he was worthy,
[1:33:09] oh, everything opens up. If he was
[1:33:12] worthy, and I declare to you this
[1:33:14] morning, he is worthy. Worthy is the
[1:33:18] lamb that was slain to redeem us from
[1:33:21] our condition. Worthy is that lamb.
[1:33:25] Oh, I declare he is worthy. And he was
[1:33:28] wounded for our transgressions. He was
[1:33:31] bruised for our iniquities. The
[1:33:33] chastisement of our peace was laid upon
[1:33:35] him. And with his stripes, we are
[1:33:39] healed.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; It's time to take access to your
[1:33:43] Christian benefits.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; In Psalms 103, he says, "Bless the Lord,
[1:33:48] oh my soul, and forget not all his
[1:33:51] benefits.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Who forgiveth
[1:33:55] all
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; all thine iniquities. And who health
[1:33:59] healeth all thy diseases?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Who redeemth thy life from destruction,
[1:34:06] and who crowneth thee with loving
[1:34:07] kindness and tender mercies, who
[1:34:10] satisfyth thy mouth with good things, so
[1:34:12] that thy youth is renewed like the
[1:34:14] eagles.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; There's benefits today.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Are you living below your privileges?
[1:34:21] Because there's benefits in my Lord
[1:34:23] Jesus Christ raised from the dead.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's He was He was bruised for
[1:34:28] our iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:34:30] peace was upon him.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Do you have peace this morning?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Are you living in a in anxiety and
[1:34:38] nervousness and worry and fear? You
[1:34:41] don't have to.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have to live under oppression
[1:34:44] and depression and and the torment of
[1:34:46] the devil. You don't have to live under
[1:34:48] that because he already paid the price
[1:34:50] for your peace.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; There's benefits this morning to serve
[1:34:59] an arisen, resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:35:01] Christ.
[1:35:03] Take advantage of your benefits this
[1:35:05] morning. You don't have to be beaten
[1:35:07] down and and all all nervous and all
[1:35:09] discouraged and and all, you know,
[1:35:12] Christians, prophet of God says a a
[1:35:15] Christian should be happy.
[1:35:17] He said we were prayed for that our joy
[1:35:19] might be full.
[1:35:21] It's something there's something about
[1:35:23] this this life, this Christian life
[1:35:25] that's real. Christians should be happy.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; So if you're not happy this morning,
[1:35:31] there's benefits you aren't taking
[1:35:33] advantage of.
[1:35:35] It's God's power that that that's come
[1:35:38] upon our life to give us joy unspeakable
[1:35:41] and full of glory. There is a joy in
[1:35:44] your salvation. If you don't have that
[1:35:47] joy of your salvation, you're still
[1:35:49] saved,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; but you're just not enjoying the
[1:35:52] benefits.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, I enjoy the benefits of
[1:35:56] being saved. I enjoy the benefits of
[1:35:59] knowing that my sins, which were black
[1:36:01] and were dark, have been taken. And I
[1:36:04] have been justified as though I never
[1:36:06] did it in the first place.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, that sets my soul to rejoicing. It
[1:36:11] gives me a happiness. It gives my feet
[1:36:14] light feet. Like brother Brandham said,
[1:36:16] he says, "Get your joy shoes on." He
[1:36:18] says, "It does something to you when you
[1:36:20] realize
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; that my sins are gone."
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, well, that's simple.
[1:36:29] That's such a simple thought. My sins
[1:36:30] are gone." Yes. But if you ever could
[1:36:32] really grasp it,
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; then there wouldn't be one hindrance to
[1:36:36] keep you from accepting your healing
[1:36:38] because there's nothing between you and
[1:36:40] the savior. You say, "Oh, well, if I
[1:36:43] could just be good enough, then the Lord
[1:36:45] would heal me." No, that sacrifice was
[1:36:47] what was good enough. The Lord Jesus
[1:36:50] Christ paid the price and that settles
[1:36:52] it. You say, "Oh, if I could just be
[1:36:54] good enough to get the Holy Ghost."
[1:36:55] Listen, it is a gift. It's not something
[1:36:58] you earn. It's the gift of the Holy
[1:37:01] Ghost. So, what you have to do is to
[1:37:03] receive it.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; You receive salvation. You receive
[1:37:07] healing. You receive the Holy Ghost. You
[1:37:10] don't earn it. You don't work for it.
[1:37:11] You accept it
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; because he was worthy.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was listening to the prophet this
[1:37:18] morning in a sermon called God's power.
[1:37:21] And man, that was just a revival for me
[1:37:23] right there. The power of God. And and
[1:37:25] he said something in there that just so
[1:37:27] blessed me. He said, "It's God's power
[1:37:30] that feeds the sparrow."
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; It's God's power that feeds the sparrow.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; God cares about a sparrow.
[1:37:45] He cares so much that he makes sure that
[1:37:49] sparrow got his breakfast this morning.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; God cares about a sparrow.
[1:37:57] every sparrow. I don't know how many
[1:37:59] millions of them there are on this
[1:38:01] world, but God cares about every
[1:38:03] sparrow. And not one of them can fall
[1:38:05] down on the ground. But what he notices
[1:38:07] it and the prophet says by his power, he
[1:38:10] feeds the sparrows.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Brother David, if he'd do that for a
[1:38:16] sparrow,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; if he's using his power to take care of
[1:38:21] the sparrow, what about the sons and the
[1:38:23] daughters of God? If you have a need
[1:38:26] this morning, I say his power is there
[1:38:28] to supply your need. And he knows and he
[1:38:33] sees it and he cares.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, he cares. But do you care?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was over over there in Pakistan
[1:38:45] last week and I heard a testimony there.
[1:38:47] I met the sister and and we we talked it
[1:38:50] over and it was just so powerful. There
[1:38:52] was a young girl there, a pastor's
[1:38:54] daughter. She She's about 18. She'd been
[1:38:57] about 17, I guess. 17, 18, and she got a
[1:39:01] a blood a blood uh disease, and she
[1:39:04] began to it began to attack the
[1:39:06] neurological pathways in her brain, and
[1:39:08] everything was just going wrong with
[1:39:09] her. They were at the doctor back and
[1:39:11] forth trying to to to deal with this.
[1:39:14] And and pretty soon, she she lost all
[1:39:17] mobility in her body. She was completely
[1:39:18] paralyzed. And she's just laying there,
[1:39:21] her her brain's being attacked. Her her
[1:39:23] uh her her body was just shutting down.
[1:39:25] And and then she she lost her eyesight,
[1:39:27] went completely blind for months. She's
[1:39:29] laying there paralyzed, blind. And then
[1:39:33] she began to lose all of her memory. She
[1:39:36] lo she she forgot everything she knew
[1:39:38] from school. She forgot she got to where
[1:39:40] she didn't even know who her father and
[1:39:42] mother were. She knew nobody. Knew no
[1:39:45] one's name. Nothing. Completely lost
[1:39:48] everything.
[1:39:50] But they told me
[1:39:53] they said she forgot who her dad's
[1:39:56] sitting there. She forgot who I was. He
[1:39:58] she forgot who her mother was. She
[1:40:00] forgot everything. But there was one
[1:40:02] thing she kept remembering and kept
[1:40:04] saying. She kept saying only believe all
[1:40:08] things are possible.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can forget a lot of things,
[1:40:14] friends. You can forget a lot of things.
[1:40:16] But if you can remember the main thing,
[1:40:18] if you can remember Jesus Christ, it'll
[1:40:21] make all the difference. And she's
[1:40:23] laying there in her blindness. She's
[1:40:25] laying there in this paralyzed
[1:40:26] condition. She can't remember anything
[1:40:28] of her life. She can't remember her own
[1:40:30] family. But the one thing she knew was
[1:40:33] that my God can do all things.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; And you know when I met her, she was
[1:40:40] standing on two feet. She could remember
[1:40:42] everything. And her eyes had come open.
[1:40:47] Only believe all things are possible.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; You know, it wasn't what the doctors
[1:41:00] figured out. It was the hand of the
[1:41:01] great physician.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz one day, her eyes just snapped open.
[1:41:07] One day,
[1:41:12] Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2,
[1:41:15] "Brethren, when I came to you, I came
[1:41:17] not with the excellency of speech or of
[1:41:19] wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony
[1:41:21] of God. For I'm determined not to know
[1:41:24] anything among you, save Jesus Christ
[1:41:26] and him crucified. And I was with you in
[1:41:29] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:41:31] trembling. and my speech and my
[1:41:33] preaching was not with the enticing
[1:41:36] words of men's wisdom, but in
[1:41:38] demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:41:40] power. That your faith should not stand
[1:41:43] in the wisdom of man, but in the power
[1:41:46] of God.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what is it that makes the
[1:41:51] power and demonstration uh in the
[1:41:54] church? It's the true gospel.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; It's the it's the it's the news that
[1:41:59] Jesus Christ is alive. It's the reality
[1:42:02] of a resurrection. We don't we don't
[1:42:04] serve a Jesus Christ that's dead, but
[1:42:06] he's alive. And he cares about the
[1:42:08] sparrows. And he cares about every
[1:42:10] single one of you as you were driving on
[1:42:12] the way to church this morning. He was
[1:42:14] watching over your vehicle. He was
[1:42:15] watching over the road because his eyes
[1:42:18] on the sparrow and he's also watching
[1:42:20] over you this morning.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:42:28] today, and forever. His reality is the
[1:42:31] same. His power is the same. And he's
[1:42:34] here. But I I want you to understand,
[1:42:36] I'm not talking about a I'm not talking
[1:42:39] about just a a a spirit. And I'm not
[1:42:42] talking about just a book, but I'm
[1:42:44] talking about a person.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said it's the pure.
[1:42:50] Speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:42:52] he says the pure, unadulterated. Oh,
[1:42:55] hallelujah. Leaving soon for the skies.
[1:42:57] Standing ready. Think your garments
[1:43:00] washed by the water of the bleeding
[1:43:03] word. The word became blood. The word
[1:43:08] bled for you. And you are washed in
[1:43:11] bleeding word.
[1:43:16] This book can't bleed.
[1:43:20] But the word made flesh.
[1:43:23] The word made flesh came down and washed
[1:43:26] us in his bleeding word. And I want you
[1:43:28] to recognize though that that bleeding
[1:43:30] word is not something of history. It's a
[1:43:33] present tense reality. In this day,
[1:43:36] Jesus Christ came down in the fullness
[1:43:39] of his word. And he was crucified by the
[1:43:41] denominations. He was crucified by the
[1:43:44] religions of this world. And the prophet
[1:43:46] of God says when they did that, that's
[1:43:49] when the word came into full effect.
[1:43:52] Oh, you must be under the water of the
[1:43:55] bleeding word, washed by the word, not
[1:43:58] of a Lutheran day. That the Luther's day
[1:44:00] had its word and it was a living word in
[1:44:02] Luther's day. And and what Wesley had a
[1:44:05] word and it was a living word in
[1:44:06] Wesley's day. But I'm talking about the
[1:44:08] living word of today. Not the living
[1:44:10] word of a yesterday, but the living word
[1:44:12] of right now. The word of God for this
[1:44:15] hour. You must be washed in that living
[1:44:18] bleeding word.
[1:44:20] Oh,
[1:44:22] you know,
[1:44:24] stat brother Brandham talks a lot about
[1:44:27] those those dynamics and mechanics and
[1:44:30] talks about those two cars and you get
[1:44:32] the one car and it's it's it's got
[1:44:34] everything in it. It's got diamond
[1:44:37] studded steering wheel and it's got, you
[1:44:39] know, chromeplated wheels and
[1:44:41] everything's just beautiful and it looks
[1:44:43] just like a church is supposed to look
[1:44:46] and that's good. That's wonderful. Over
[1:44:49] here we have another church and it's got
[1:44:51] the same thing. It's got the steering
[1:44:53] wheel. It's got the the the the the the
[1:44:55] leather seats and it's a beautiful
[1:44:57] looking car and that's wonderful. He
[1:45:00] says but there was one little thing
[1:45:02] different about them two vehicles.
[1:45:05] Says one of them didn't have a spark
[1:45:07] plug. Both of them were filled up with
[1:45:09] high octane gasoline. They had a power
[1:45:12] inside of them
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; potentially.
[1:45:16] Potential power was sitting there, but
[1:45:18] it was lacking one thing. It was lacking
[1:45:21] that spark that would take it and would
[1:45:23] drive it down the road under the power
[1:45:25] of the Holy Ghost. And he says that's
[1:45:27] the way the churches are today and shows
[1:45:29] how they're in that same condition. And
[1:45:32] and and and I want to read it here. Uh
[1:45:34] uh rising of the sun. He says, "And he's
[1:45:37] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:45:39] And we are his beneficiaries are to
[1:45:42] prove his life is in us now. The
[1:45:45] beneficiaries of his life. The life
[1:45:47] there never was a life like his. He was
[1:45:50] the son of God and he died and then it
[1:45:52] sh shut it out and but he was raised
[1:45:54] from the dead. And on Easter morning
[1:45:57] then we as his servants are commissioned
[1:46:00] by him to go into all the world and to
[1:46:02] bring the good news to every person that
[1:46:06] he is living. And how can we do it by
[1:46:09] word only? For it's written, the gospel
[1:46:11] came not by word only, but through the
[1:46:13] power and the manifestation of the Holy
[1:46:16] Spirit to prove that he is alive. Now,
[1:46:20] there is there is another gospel as Paul
[1:46:22] spoke of in one of the groups and I'm
[1:46:24] surprised that you're turned to another
[1:46:26] gospel which is no other but but it's a
[1:46:28] makebelieve gospel to a denominational
[1:46:32] fiction turning from that good news. But
[1:46:35] because I live, ye live also. And I live
[1:46:38] in you. And the works that I do, the
[1:46:41] works in John 14:12, the works that I do
[1:46:43] will identify myself in you. Oh, what a
[1:46:46] message. No wonder we had a dark world
[1:46:48] of theology. But in the evening time
[1:46:51] there shall come light again. There will
[1:46:54] be a resurrection. And in the evening
[1:46:56] time, and it shall be light at the
[1:46:59] evening time. Have you seen the
[1:47:01] resurrection of Jesus Christ in this
[1:47:03] last hour when he raised up after 2,000
[1:47:06] years of being buried under the
[1:47:08] teachings and the traditions of man? But
[1:47:10] he's no longer bound by that
[1:47:12] denominational tradition. He has raised
[1:47:15] from that. And there's people that might
[1:47:17] want to say that he doesn't have power
[1:47:19] today. And maybe he don't have power in
[1:47:21] their life, but he has power in my life
[1:47:24] because I have accepted the rising of
[1:47:26] the sun. I have recognized his presence
[1:47:29] as a reality today.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, and my commission is to go tell
[1:47:36] everyone that he is alive.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; That's the gospel of Jesus Christ. Not
[1:47:43] just a a word or a teaching or a theory,
[1:47:46] but a person.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, a risen resurrected savior.
[1:47:52] Talking about that paragraph 103 of the
[1:47:55] rising of the sun. No matter how much
[1:47:57] theologians claim and and how well you
[1:47:59] get your churches set and how much
[1:48:01] education you got and how much like the
[1:48:04] Bible until that wave sheath until that
[1:48:07] Holy Spirit comes upon the person to
[1:48:10] quicken that word the gasoline
[1:48:12] represents the word and and it's the
[1:48:14] truth but without the spirit it won't
[1:48:16] move. We put too much stress on the
[1:48:19] mechanics and nothing on the dynamic. It
[1:48:22] needs the dynamic power of God, the
[1:48:24] resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon
[1:48:28] the church to manifest and to bring to
[1:48:30] pass that this is gasoline.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, we have a word
[1:48:36] in this hour and it's a powerful word.
[1:48:39] And we have the Holy Ghost in the church
[1:48:41] to take that word and manifest it in its
[1:48:44] power.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not le interested in dead
[1:48:48] religion. I I I have been to India and
[1:48:50] seen their idols on the side of the road
[1:48:52] and I've come year after year and they
[1:48:54] were still there and they'd never moved.
[1:48:57] They have no life. They have no power.
[1:49:00] But that's not my God. My God is alive
[1:49:02] and he's moving and he's sweeping
[1:49:05] through this building this morning
[1:49:06] looking for somebody that'll reach out
[1:49:09] and take a hold of the hem of his
[1:49:10] garment. Looking for somebody that will
[1:49:12] recognize his presence. The prophet of
[1:49:15] God says when you recognize his
[1:49:17] presence, that's what releases his power
[1:49:19] to you.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Prophet God said in message of grace, it
[1:49:28] takes a humble heart dedicated to God to
[1:49:32] bring Jesus Christ under present tense.
[1:49:36] It doesn't take theology. It doesn't
[1:49:38] take education. It doesn't take money.
[1:49:41] It doesn't take your your prestige. It
[1:49:44] takes humility dedicated to God to bring
[1:49:47] Jesus Christ to present tense. And what
[1:49:49] I'm looking for this morning is Jesus
[1:49:52] Christ in present tense
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; because he has everything that I have
[1:49:56] need of.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, prophet in the rising of the sun. If
[1:50:02] you haven't heard that sermon lately,
[1:50:04] brother, sister, there is a wonderful
[1:50:07] treasure trove in there. But he says,
[1:50:09] "I'm afraid that too many of us are not
[1:50:12] getting the people to Christ. We're
[1:50:14] getting them to a church, to a theory,
[1:50:18] but we must get them to Christ. He is
[1:50:20] the one, the only one that that has
[1:50:24] life. For he that has the son has life."
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Well, what I'm interested in is life.
[1:50:32] I'm interested in a power of the
[1:50:34] resurrection of Jesus Christ that could
[1:50:36] take a dead man and raise him back to
[1:50:38] life. I'm not talking about just in
[1:50:40] Jesus's day. I'm not talking about a
[1:50:41] Lazarus, but I'm talking about the same
[1:50:44] power that's here in this day that's
[1:50:46] going to bring forth the dead out of the
[1:50:48] grave that's going to transform this
[1:50:50] mortal body. I'm talking about that kind
[1:50:52] of a power because that's the hour we're
[1:50:54] living in. We're living in the hour when
[1:50:56] the we which are alive and remain shall
[1:50:58] be caught up. We're living in the hour
[1:51:00] when those which are dead are going to
[1:51:02] raise from the grave. And there's a
[1:51:03] power that's going to raise them. It's
[1:51:05] the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus.
[1:51:08] And there's benefits right now today of
[1:51:11] that resurrection.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:51:17] prophet of God.
[1:51:21] says here in Bal and Gilead
[1:51:24] talked about that girl who was dancing
[1:51:26] across the floor and half naked and all
[1:51:30] excited about the the music of the the
[1:51:32] Wildcats playing and everything. And
[1:51:35] Brother Brandham was talking to a
[1:51:36] Methodist pastor who couldn't get the
[1:51:38] people to show up at church. He said,
[1:51:40] "Uh, I asked I sent out all these cards
[1:51:42] and they signed all these cards. Will
[1:51:44] you come to church?" And he says, "Out
[1:51:46] of 4 or 500 people," he says, "nomely
[1:51:48] two of them said they would come six
[1:51:49] months out of the year."
[1:51:52] And he said, "You know, you know, Bill,
[1:51:53] what's going on?" And he says, "How do
[1:51:55] you get those people all up there at
[1:51:56] your church on Sunday night?" And he
[1:51:58] says, "Oh, I give them pills."
[1:52:02] So, I give him pills. He says, "How how
[1:52:04] do you get them all there on Sunday
[1:52:05] night?" He says, "I give him pills." And
[1:52:07] he says, "Uh, what kind of pills?" He
[1:52:09] was excited. Hey, this might work. He
[1:52:12] said, "I give him gospels."
[1:52:14] And you know what he said? He's like,
[1:52:16] "Oh, well, you haven't lost your
[1:52:18] southern ideas."
[1:52:22] He saw he thought it was going to be
[1:52:24] something new. It was going to be
[1:52:25] something special.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; But when he found out it was just the
[1:52:28] gospel,
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; he was like, "Oh,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; just the gospel. Just the fact that
[1:52:35] there's a reality of a supernatural God
[1:52:38] presence in the church. That's what'll
[1:52:40] draw the people." He said, "If I be
[1:52:42] lifted up, I will draw all men unto me."
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "You know, that man and was
[1:52:50] asking, you know, how do we get these
[1:52:52] people to come to church? And what do we
[1:52:54] do?" And he says, uh, he says, "Well,
[1:52:56] let me ask you, do you think, Brother
[1:52:57] Brown, that he says, you'd have to get
[1:52:59] somebody to to sign a card to to come to
[1:53:01] that that Wildcat dance there that she
[1:53:04] was just all excited about?" He's like,
[1:53:06] "Well, no." He said, "You're right.
[1:53:08] she'd sell what little clothes she did
[1:53:09] have so she could make it there. And he
[1:53:11] says, "If them people loved God like
[1:53:15] that woman loved dancing, they would be
[1:53:17] at the church and you wouldn't have any
[1:53:19] to sign any card to get them there." And
[1:53:22] that's where the trouble is, brother.
[1:53:23] The church has lost its zeal, its love
[1:53:27] for the gospel, for the power, for the
[1:53:29] Holy Ghost. It's lost it. Is there no
[1:53:32] balm in Gilead? Is there no physician
[1:53:34] there? Then why is the daughter of my
[1:53:37] people not recovered? Oh, brothers and
[1:53:40] sisters, there is a bomb in Gilead.
[1:53:43] There is a resurrected Lord Jesus. And
[1:53:45] he's here this morning to give to you
[1:53:48] what you have need of. If you are
[1:53:50] willing to entertain his presence,
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; oh, if you can be like that little woman
[1:53:56] who pushed through the crowd and she
[1:53:58] pushed past every obstacle and she broke
[1:54:00] through every barrier until she could
[1:54:02] get to his feet and pour out her worship
[1:54:05] onto him, if you can push past every
[1:54:08] person who would say, "Oh, well, look at
[1:54:09] you. You're not worthy enough. You're
[1:54:11] not good enough." She pushed past that.
[1:54:13] She pushed past every barrier till she
[1:54:15] could get to him
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; because he had what she needed.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, and you know, you you might say she
[1:54:25] wasn't worthy, and you're absolutely
[1:54:26] right, but he was worthy of service.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; He deserved to be made welcome. And is
[1:54:34] there somebody here this morning that's
[1:54:37] willing to make him welcome and say,
[1:54:38] "God, I have a need in my life. Lord,
[1:54:42] there's things I can't fix on my own.
[1:54:44] There's situations I don't want know
[1:54:46] what to do about, but I have a need of
[1:54:48] you this morning. And I tell you, if you
[1:54:51] can get to him, if you can get to my
[1:54:53] resurrected Lord Jesus, his power is
[1:54:56] just the same as it ever was.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; If he forgave her, he'll forgive you.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; If he healed that woman with the blood
[1:55:04] issue, he'll do it for you because he's
[1:55:07] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:55:10] Let's stand to our feet this morning.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; We're not living in a day of dead, dark
[1:55:17] denominationalism.
[1:55:19] But in this last day, there has been a
[1:55:21] resurrection out of that. There's been a
[1:55:23] wave sheep waved over the people. We
[1:55:25] have seen Jesus Christ as the same
[1:55:27] yesterday, today, and forever. But that
[1:55:29] wasn't just to let us know that he was
[1:55:31] alive in 1960, friends. That wasn't just
[1:55:34] to let us know that he was moving back
[1:55:36] there. That's to let us know he's here
[1:55:38] right now today in 2025. He's the same
[1:55:41] God right now.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, and whatsoever things you have need
[1:55:46] of, believe.
[1:55:49] Believe you will receive them.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "What are you talking about?"
[1:55:55] I'm challenging you to release your
[1:55:57] faith in him. I'm challenging you to
[1:56:00] believe that he has the answer for what
[1:56:03] you're dealing with.
[1:56:04] Oh, do you believe it this morning? Do
[1:56:06] you truly believe that Jesus Christ has
[1:56:09] raised from the dead with all your
[1:56:11] heart? Is that a reality to you? Is it a
[1:56:13] story book? Or is it a Sunday school
[1:56:15] teaching you heard one day? Or is it
[1:56:17] something that's just impulsating in
[1:56:19] your heart saying, "Lord, I believe. I
[1:56:21] believe you're here. I believe your
[1:56:23] presence and I believe that whatsoever I
[1:56:26] have need of, you're here this morning
[1:56:27] to meet my need."
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I challenge you to believe it this
[1:56:32] morning.
[1:56:34] Let's just sing that. Let's just sing
[1:56:36] that. Only believe.
[1:56:43] Only
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:52] believe.
[1:56:55] All things are possible.
[1:57:01] Holy,
[1:57:08] holy,
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:14] holy
[1:57:17] believe.
[1:57:21] All things are possible.
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:31] Jesus is here. Amen.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:57:36] is here. Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:57:43] is here.
[1:57:46] All things are possible.
[1:57:53] Oh, Jesus
[1:57:55] is here.
[1:57:58] Oh Jesus
[1:58:02] is here.
[1:58:06] Jesus
[1:58:08] is here.
[1:58:12] All things are possible.
[1:58:18] Oh Jesus
[1:58:20] is here.
[1:58:23] You know, one time Jesus walked through
[1:58:26] a multitude of sick folk.
[1:58:29] He walked up to one person. He said,
[1:58:32] "Would you may be made well." And that
[1:58:35] one man was healed and he walked out of
[1:58:37] there. But there's no record that
[1:58:39] anybody else was healed.
[1:58:42] Why?
[1:58:44] The power was there. The healer was
[1:58:47] walking through the midst of them. If
[1:58:50] they would have reached out and took the
[1:58:51] hip of his garment, there was the power
[1:58:54] to heal them right there. If they would
[1:58:55] have cried out, "Jesus, thou son of
[1:58:58] David, have mercy on me." His power was
[1:59:00] there to heal them, but they didn't
[1:59:03] recognize him.
[1:59:05] And because they failed to recognize
[1:59:08] him, they did not receive their
[1:59:10] blessing. Oh, but if you'll recognize
[1:59:13] him this morning, oh, if you'll
[1:59:15] recognize his presence is here to give
[1:59:18] to you your desire. Oh, then every
[1:59:21] whatsoever you have need of is available
[1:59:24] this morning.
[1:59:26] Just if if you want to come for special
[1:59:29] prayer or if you want to kneel down at
[1:59:31] your chair, if you want to kneel down at
[1:59:32] altar, I don't care how you go about it.
[1:59:34] But brothers and sisters, don't miss
[1:59:36] your opportunity this morning
[1:59:39] to meet with the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:59:42] Christ. Let's just sing that again.
[1:59:45] Jesus is here.
[1:59:48] Oh, Jesus
[1:59:52] is here.
[1:59:55] Jesus
[1:59:58] is here.
[2:00:01] Through all things are possible,
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:08] Jesus
[2:00:11] is here.
[2:00:13] Oh Jesus
[2:00:17] is here.
[2:00:20] Oh Jesus
[2:00:23] is here.
[2:00:26] Oh, all things are possible
[2:00:32] for Jesus
[2:00:34] [Music]
[2:00:35] is here.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:00:42] I receive.
[2:00:46] Lord,
[2:00:48] I receive.
[2:00:50] [Music]
[2:00:52] All things are possible.
[2:01:00] [Music]
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; And Lord,
[2:01:07] I receive.
[2:01:11] Lord,
[2:01:13] I receive.
[2:01:18] All things are possible.
[2:01:24] Lord
[2:01:25] [Music]
[2:01:26] receive. Lord I believe and Lord
[2:01:32] I believe.
[2:01:36] Lord
[2:01:39] I believe.
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:46] are crossing
[2:01:48] and Lord I
[2:01:52] believe
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:55] and Lord
[2:01:58] I believe
[2:02:02] Lord
[2:02:04] I Impossible.
[2:02:07] [Music]
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:34] Oh, and thank
[2:02:37] [Music]
[2:02:44] you for
[2:02:47] [Music]
[2:02:53] all my sins.
[2:02:54] and shame
[2:02:57] in love. You came
[2:03:01] and gave amazing
[2:03:05] grace.
[2:03:07] Thank you for your love,
[2:03:11] Lord.
[2:03:15] Thank you for
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:23] wash me in your cleansing flow.
[2:03:29] All I know
[2:03:32] for
[2:03:36] praise
[2:03:41] worthy is the lamb.
[2:03:48] See it on the throne.
[2:03:54] [Music]
[2:03:56] We crown you now
[2:03:59] with heavy
[2:04:02] ground
[2:04:04] to great victorious.
[2:04:07] [Music]
[2:04:12] I am lifted
[2:04:15] up
[2:04:17] [Music]
[2:04:20] Jesus son
[2:04:23] of God.
[2:04:24] [Music]
[2:04:27] The treasure of heaven.
[2:04:38] Worthy is
[2:04:41] [Music]
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:59] You know, it's hard to
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; sell something you don't use yourself.
[2:05:12] And if you believe he's here,
[2:05:15] you can't tell somebody
[2:05:19] that he's risen if you don't
[2:05:22] touch them yourself.
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:28] You know, a a prayer line doesn't work
[2:05:31] if you don't touch them yourself.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Nobody can touch him for you.
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; You know that
[2:05:44] that you've got to touch him.
[2:05:50] And that's and he said, "If you draw
[2:05:52] nigh unto me, I'll draw nigh unto you."
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe you could sing that little song.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; So, you know,
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; if we don't have room here, you can
[2:06:08] touch him right in your seat.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; The battle's in the mind.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; You just start fighting in your mind.
[2:06:19] Will he touch me?
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; If I lift my hand and I admit,
[2:06:27] will he touch me? Yes, he will.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; He will touch you.
[2:06:36] And if you're not saved this morning,
[2:06:41] that means you haven't given your life
[2:06:42] to him.
[2:06:46] Don't be ashamed to come up and say,
[2:06:51] you know, I want to give my life to him.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz he said, if you come unto me in no
[2:06:56] wise will I cast you out.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; If you got something in your life, you
[2:07:03] just can't overcome it.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; He already knows what it is.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; He just wants you to touch the hem of
[2:07:12] his garment. Our
[2:07:15] brother preached. He's here. Do you
[2:07:17] believe he's here?
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; You believe what he said? Wherever two
[2:07:22] or three are gathered together in my
[2:07:24] name, there I'll be.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; So, he's here
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; and he knows everything in your life.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; What you're battling, what you go
[2:07:35] through, what your weaknesses are, what
[2:07:38] your trouble is, what what your failures
[2:07:41] are. He knows every single one of them.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord,
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; this morning.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; There's nothing hid.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing hid.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; The question is, do you want to reach
[2:08:00] your hand and say, "Lord, I want to
[2:08:02] touch you this morning." Nobody can
[2:08:07] touch them for you.
[2:08:10] Don't think about what it is that that
[2:08:13] you're doing wrong.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Think about who he is
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; and that he died for that problem. He
[2:08:22] died for that sin
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; and he rose up
[2:08:28] and comes back alive in our presence
[2:08:32] to fulfill every promise he made to you.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And he said if you're
[2:08:38] faithful and just to confess your sins,
[2:08:41] he would be faithful and just to forgive
[2:08:44] them.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; And he's here to forgive.
[2:08:48] And you can feel that forgiving power.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; He's here to heal. And he's here to
[2:08:55] bring
[2:08:56] that healing to you.
[2:09:01] If you've never been baptized in the
[2:09:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and given
[2:09:06] your heart to the Lord, we have a pool
[2:09:10] that's open.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Would you just reach up
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; and let him come into your life?
[2:09:24] There's nothing like it, church.
[2:09:26] [Music]
[2:09:28] Oh shackled
[2:09:30] by a heavenly
[2:09:33] [Music]
[2:09:34] burden.
[2:09:40] Be the Lord app
[2:09:49] [Music]
[2:09:54] of Jesus.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, touch us this morning. Oh,
[2:10:03] and now
[2:10:05] I am no longer
[2:10:08] [Music]
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:29] the joy.
[2:10:33] Oh, reach up and touch him. If you know,
[2:10:36] touch him.
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:41] [Applause]
[2:10:58] Oh, if he's dealing with your heart,
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; you know you're not right with God. You
[2:11:03] know you haven't given your life to him.
[2:11:06] You feel him all around you.
[2:11:10] He's calling you.
[2:11:12] That's a privilege.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Why die with a dying generation in a
[2:11:18] world that's law?
[2:11:21] Why don't you hear the call this
[2:11:23] morning,
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Lord? I'm not right.
[2:11:29] I've got things in my life that's not
[2:11:31] right. I can't overcome. I'm I'm broken.
[2:11:36] But the brother said that you were
[2:11:38] alive.
[2:11:41] He He testified that he touched you
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; and you did something for him.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Father, I was lost
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; so far, but Lord, you touched me.
[2:11:59] And if you ever been touched, you want
[2:12:01] somebody else to be touched.
[2:12:08] All you have to do is slip your hand up
[2:12:11] to him and say, "Lord, I'm not right.
[2:12:15] I know I'm not right.
[2:12:18] But I heard the gospel
[2:12:21] that you can make me right.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; I don't have to make myself right.
[2:12:27] that you can touch me
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; and forgive me and your spirit can come
[2:12:33] in my life
[2:12:35] and joy can
[2:12:38] make a difference in my heart.
[2:12:43] And Lord, I'm willing to go to the pool
[2:12:45] this morning
[2:12:47] and testify that I was wrong, but
[2:12:51] I'm going to be baptized in your name
[2:12:54] for the remission of all my past that I
[2:12:58] can resurrect new and be filled with
[2:13:01] your spirit.
[2:13:06] The gift of God is eternal life through
[2:13:08] Christ Jesus. The wages of sin is death.
[2:13:15] Man is making his choice today.
[2:13:19] Will you make your choice for him? Don't
[2:13:22] be ashamed.
[2:13:26] I know how it feels. That feeling comes
[2:13:28] all around you and you feel the
[2:13:30] conviction and you feel the guilt and
[2:13:33] you it just like every eye in the
[2:13:36] world's on you. But just lift up past it
[2:13:40] and say, "Oh God,
[2:13:42] this morning,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; I know it's the truth.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; And I want you this morning."
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Do you do that?
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Don't let this opportunity pass you by.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that sense first. Amen. Oh,
[2:13:57] since I meant this glad
[2:14:01] savior.
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:10] cleansing me.
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:20] I shall never see
[2:14:24] to praise him.
[2:14:29] Oh,
[2:14:30] I shall
[2:14:34] eternal
[2:14:36] [Music]
[2:14:38] touch
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:43] me.
[2:14:45] Oh
[2:14:49] me
[2:14:58] [Music]
[2:14:59] my soul
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:11] and
[2:15:13] I Oh
[2:15:17] my
[2:15:19] and
[2:15:22] [Music]
[2:15:26] hallelujah.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; I remember
[2:15:35] brother Neville told me something that
[2:15:38] [Music]
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said. He said, "David,"
[2:15:43] he said,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; "the minute you make that first move
[2:15:47] towards him,
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; you raise your hand, your heart cries
[2:15:52] out." He says, "9%
[2:15:55] of it's already taken care of.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; It's all acceptance."
[2:16:09] I tell you, there's not.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; There's nothing.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; I always laugh at these liquor stores.
[2:16:15] They say spirits.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Why? And we got the best spirit in the
[2:16:21] world.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; We got his spirit. He loves you.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; If you could if we could ever grasp that
[2:16:30] God so loved the world, he gave his only
[2:16:33] begotten son.
[2:16:36] He He went to Calvary for you.
[2:16:41] It's you personally.
[2:16:44] He knows He knows the anguish of your
[2:16:47] heart. Just touch them. It's so
[2:16:50] beautiful when you touch him.
[2:16:55] And And I I would like if the if it the
[2:16:59] brothers would before I head overseas.
[2:17:02] And I can't explain to you
[2:17:07] in the realms of what's
[2:17:11] happening.
[2:17:13] I mean, the brother came today and
[2:17:16] preached a message. And if you're
[2:17:19] spiritual, you understand that a few
[2:17:22] weeks ago, we stood right here and said,
[2:17:24] "We need to take this church
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; and move it towards evangelism."
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; And I never talked to him.
[2:17:35] I mean, last time I saw him, he was the
[2:17:37] squirt.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:17:47] I believe I he said I gave my testimony
[2:17:50] at brother Ted said, "Remember that
[2:17:53] meeting? It was so crowded
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; that the the the first person's face was
[2:17:59] right here.
[2:18:04] it. But what was it all about? It was
[2:18:08] all about a God that could do something.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; And
[2:18:15] there's there's hardly any voices
[2:18:18] anymore that want to bring pe people
[2:18:21] back to the reality of the word of God.
[2:18:27] what the prophet of God was really
[2:18:30] preaching
[2:18:31] that he is the same yesterday, today and
[2:18:34] forever.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; That was his theme.
[2:18:38] All things are possible only believe.
[2:18:43] And as our brother said, that's been
[2:18:45] that has been exchanged
[2:18:49] for people ruling over God's people.
[2:18:54] The ministry has inserted themselves
[2:18:58] in between the promises of God and the
[2:19:02] people
[2:19:07] and the people are starving
[2:19:13] and the light is starting to break.
[2:19:17] As some brothers could tell you, the
[2:19:19] idea and the recognition of culture
[2:19:24] are Spanish believers.
[2:19:26] You know the culture
[2:19:28] [Music]
[2:19:29] of how that the authoritarian
[2:19:35] leadership will control your life
[2:19:41] and that you live in fear
[2:19:45] of the ministry.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; And all along the ministry was only
[2:19:51] supposed to be your servant. That's
[2:19:52] right.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; They weren't supposed to lord over you.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; And it's like that little blade of grass
[2:20:04] that gets buried under all that
[2:20:06] concrete.
[2:20:09] Eventually,
[2:20:12] it's got to work its way to the
[2:20:13] sunlight.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it takes years to come out
[2:20:19] from amongst it.
[2:20:21] But the only thing that causes that
[2:20:25] grass to make that journey from the
[2:20:29] beneath that concrete is because there's
[2:20:32] a sun
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; drawing it.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; And there's a s this morning here that's
[2:20:42] drawing.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; And maybe you felt that this morning.
[2:20:46] You felt that pull. Don't shut it off.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. cuz it'll pull you into
[2:20:51] the sunlight. And if you think living
[2:20:54] under concrete's good, you ought to see
[2:20:57] what it's like living in the glorious
[2:20:59] sunlight of God.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; A God that cares for you.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; A God that knows what you're suffering,
[2:21:10] knows what you're going through. One
[2:21:12] that'll do anything for you.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; I come from a dark place.
[2:21:22] Even in my testimony, I can't
[2:21:26] speak
[2:21:28] of how dark and evil
[2:21:32] and demonfilled
[2:21:35] that I was.
[2:21:39] So in my heart, there's no sin that God
[2:21:42] can't forgive.
[2:21:44] There's no place that you can go that he
[2:21:48] can't reach farther.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; He's real.
[2:21:58] and and maybe if the brothers would come
[2:22:01] lay hands on me
[2:22:03] uh for my journey,
[2:22:06] you know, every time I I know that God's
[2:22:10] going to do something, Satan starts
[2:22:12] whacking my flesh.
[2:22:16] You know, he'll do something to
[2:22:19] discourage me that just pushes me
[2:22:21] farther.
[2:22:23] But there's some people that are hungry
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; and we just trust that God will do
[2:22:28] exceedingly abundantly. Brothers, the
[2:22:31] minister, brothers, any other brothers
[2:22:32] that'd like to come, just ask the Lord
[2:22:35] to
[2:22:59] [Music]
[2:24:15] What are you excited?
[2:24:34] Amen.
[2:24:37] How many's already given their heart to
[2:24:38] the Lord?
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Is that all, man? We need to have more
[2:24:43] revival.
[2:24:45] Is that all the people that's given
[2:24:46] their heart to the Lord? 1 2 3 5 6 10
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Have you been sorry?
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Never been sorry.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; I've never been sorry. We'll see. This
[2:25:00] is our dismissal song. God bless you
[2:25:02] this morning. Jesus Christ is the same
[2:25:06] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[2:25:11] [Music]

[2:25:16] and I've been singing every day
[2:25:22] [Music]
