[29:54] &gt;&gt; Um last week I was talking to someone um
[29:58] and I uh in admonishing the person I
[30:02] said uh uh God cannot do something for
[30:06] you uh today. Maybe he protect you
[30:11] that God cannot protect you today and
[30:13] then he will not protect you tomorrow.
[30:16] If it protects you today, it protects
[30:17] you tomorrow and the day after and it
[30:20] continue to do that. Um, but when I was
[30:22] saying that, apparently I was talking to
[30:23] myself as well. Have you ever been in a
[30:26] near miss? Maybe you go through
[30:27] situations and you're just thinking,
[30:30] "Oh, I escaped through this one." And
[30:32] and something in human is like you're
[30:34] expecting the next one. When is the next
[30:36] challenge going to come up? And but
[30:38] sometimes you might forget that the God
[30:40] that took you through this one will take
[30:42] you through that other one as well. Um,
[30:44] so I want to sing a mighty fortress is
[30:47] our God.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Uh, I might not follow the key. Uh, I
[30:54] said I don't know the key, but I'll just
[30:56] give it a try.
[31:01] A mighty fortress. He's a God.
[31:08] A work never failing.
[31:14] A helper he me the flood
[31:20] of mort heals prevailing
[31:27] for still I f
[31:32] seek to walk
[31:36] his craft and par great
[31:41] and armed with cool
[31:46] on earth is not his equal.
[31:54] Did we in our own strength confide
[32:01] our striving would be loseing?
[32:08] Were not the right man on our side?
[32:14] The man of God's own choosing.
[32:21] That ask who that may be.

[33:16] would tremble not for him.
[33:20] His rage we can endure.

[35:13] Oh, I've heard a thousand
[35:18] stories. stories of what
[35:21] they think you're like, but I've
[35:26] heard the tender whispers of loveing

[38:16] peace so
[38:19] unexplainable.
[38:22] I
[38:23] can hardly think as you call
[38:29] me.
[38:31] Deeper still as you call
[38:35] me.

[48:36] what can be said of your love and your
[48:40] kindness
[48:42] towards us,
[48:47] Father, if we could just care one for
[48:50] another just
[48:54] just in the like manner that you care
[48:56] for us.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful world this would have
[49:01] could be.
[49:03] We ask you to bless us this morning.
[49:05] Father, help us.
[49:08] Encourage our hearts and
[49:13] may we come to the place that we know
[49:16] that we're not alone.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. that you made a promise
[49:20] that you would never leave us nor
[49:22] forsake us, but that you'd be with us,
[49:25] Father, even in us all the way until the
[49:28] end.
[49:32] The battle seems great sometimes, but we
[49:36] have this confidence
[49:38] that he who is in us is greater than he
[49:41] who is in the world.
[49:43] Encourage us this morning. Once again I
[49:46] pray in Jesus precious name we pray.
[49:50] Amen. Amen. God bless. You may be
[49:52] seated. We have a a baby dedication
[49:56] this morning. And uh
[49:59] and uh
[50:01] from the looks of things, we're going to
[50:03] have a lot of these in the future. So uh
[50:07] we just uh trust the Lord to this
[50:10] morning. It's uh
[50:13] William and Kimmy. Uh I I am going to
[50:17] try to pronounce this the best I can. Uh
[50:21] Ayako and if I didn't say that right, um
[50:26] I'm Irish
[50:28] and uh and so we'll do that. But uh uh
[50:33] Brother William and we're going to
[50:35] dedicate baby Stephen this morning. So
[50:38] if they would come, we could sing this
[50:41] song, bring them in, as they come to
[50:43] dedicate their baby this morning. Amen.
[50:47] Oh, bring them in.
[50:51] Bring them in.
[50:54] Bring them.
[51:01] Bring them in.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Are you Mark David's older or younger?
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Younger.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Younger. Okay, good. Yeah, he did look
[51:22] quite a bit older than you, so I wanted
[51:25] to make sure I got that right.
[51:28] Sorry, Mark. Anyway, I'd like to read a
[51:31] little story here in the Bible as we
[51:33] dedicate Stephen. And it said, "And when
[51:36] they heard these things, they were cut
[51:38] to their heart, and they nashed on him
[51:43] with their teeth.
[51:45] But he being full of the Holy Ghost
[51:48] looked up steadfast into heaven and saw
[51:52] the glory of God and Jesus standing on
[51:56] the right hand of God. And he said,
[51:59] "Behold, I see the heavens open and the
[52:02] Son of Man standing on the right hand of
[52:05] God." And they cried out with loud
[52:08] voices and stopped their ears and ran
[52:11] upon him with one accord and cast him
[52:15] out of the city and stoned him. And the
[52:18] witnesses laid their coats on a young
[52:22] man's feet whose name was Saul.
[52:26] And they stoned Stephen calling upon God
[52:29] and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my
[52:32] spirit." And he knelt down and cried
[52:35] with a loud voice,
[52:37] "Laying lay not this sin to their
[52:40] charge." And when he had said this, he
[52:44] fell asleep. Amen. What a great saint to
[52:48] be named after. And I I always this
[52:51] story to me
[52:54] Stephen could be so full of the love of
[52:58] God that that he sin not be laid to
[53:04] I I really think that's marvelous. So as
[53:07] a little Stephen God bless you. Can I
[53:09] shake your hand here?
[53:13] Show everybody this little guy.
[53:23] Now it's a miracle
[53:26] &gt;&gt; that you can go from this little to this
[53:30] big
[53:33] and and just by the life of God and the
[53:37] grace of God. How marvelous is our God.
[53:42] And I think just a baby come into the
[53:44] world just one of the most How can you
[53:47] not know there's a God? He just so real.
[53:52] Oh, brother, we just ask maybe you'd say
[53:54] a prayer over your son and then we'll
[53:56] all pray for him. Go ahead.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Father Lord, um we thank you for today.
[54:07] We thank you for this baby. You gave
[54:09] this baby to us and we're giving him
[54:11] back to you, Father. Um, we commit his
[54:15] way onto your hands for the rest of his
[54:17] life. May he live his life according to
[54:20] your gospel. May he follow in your
[54:22] footstep. May his life be a beacon to
[54:26] everyone else. Wherever his name is
[54:28] echoed, may grace follow. Wherever his
[54:32] name is heckled, may mercy follow.
[54:34] Father Lord, as he leaves his life, may
[54:37] he be a cornerstone, Father Lord, may
[54:39] the uh whip of the enemy not catch him.
[54:43] Father Lord, as he leaves and in this
[54:45] life and as we hope to leave another
[54:48] when we leave this world, may his life
[54:51] be uh a testimony to others. And as um
[54:55] as he grows, may he grows in the light
[54:58] of the word of God. Uh we commit him to
[55:00] your hand today. Father, Lord Jesus
[55:02] Christ, take him in Jesus name. For in
[55:04] Jesus name we pray.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He did say he cried with a
[55:10] loud voice. So he's just being
[55:13] scripture. Let us pray to our father as
[55:17] this family dedicates this gift that you
[55:20] gave him. Father, may they lives just be
[55:25] an example to him as they raise him
[55:27] according to your word. Father, as we
[55:30] prayed and grace follow him, our
[55:34] gracious father above all things, Lord,
[55:38] we ask
[55:40] kingdom as we've given them to you,
[55:43] Father, that you will rule his life. We
[55:46] ask these things in Jesus' name we pray.
[55:49] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister. God bless you.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[55:59] I am
[56:08] I'm going in and out.
[56:10] Well, one day I'm going up.
[56:13] So, in and out's okay for now. But long
[56:17] as I go up, you know, and
[56:20] there'll be some of us that have to go
[56:22] into the grave. So, we'll have to go
[56:24] down before we go up. But the bottom
[56:27] line is we all want to go up, right?
[56:31] &gt;&gt; That's where why we're here this
[56:33] morning. Thank you. Oh, good. It's good
[56:37] to see you back, Sister Rebecca.
[56:41] Uh
[56:42] yeah. Anyway, I have uh a little uh
[56:47] message on my heart this morning and I I
[56:51] thought just as our brother sang that
[56:53] first song this morning, it just kind of
[56:55] encouraged me that maybe what I have in
[56:58] my heart was would be good. And and uh
[57:03] so we're going to turn in our Bibles to
[57:06] um the book of Ephesians. If we could
[57:10] stand, we'll read our scripture.
[57:13] And it's found in Ephesians the 2
[57:16] chapter.
[57:21] And uh
[57:23] we'll we'll start with the first verse
[57:26] of the second chapter and and we we'll
[57:29] read um through the ninth verse.
[57:34] And he's speaking
[57:36] uh to you or to us or how you have to
[57:42] place yourself in the scripture.
[57:45] And you hath he quickened who were dead
[57:49] in trespass and sins
[57:52] wherein in times past you walked
[57:54] according to the course of this world.
[57:58] And I think we can all say that. Is
[58:00] isn't that true? that
[58:02] &gt;&gt; in times past we all walk to the course
[58:04] of this world
[58:06] according to the prince of the power of
[58:11] the air.
[58:13] The spirit that now workketh in the
[58:16] children of disobedient.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; So we see there's a spirit and there's a
[58:22] power.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. that works. Among whom
[58:27] also we all had our conversations in
[58:31] times past in the lust of our flesh,
[58:35] fulfilling the desire of the flesh and
[58:39] of the mind, and were by nature the
[58:43] children of wrath even as others.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; So you have to see that we were in one
[58:51] condition. That's right.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And something took place that put us in
[58:55] another condition.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; And Paul is drawing the contrast because
[59:01] it's important that you see the
[59:04] contrast. But what we want to emphasize
[59:07] on this morning is what brought us from
[59:10] where that we were to where that we are.
[59:16] And uh and then Paul goes on to try to
[59:20] let this speak out to us.
[59:24] But God,
[59:25] &gt;&gt; that's right. who is rich in mercy
[59:30] for great for his great love wherein he
[59:35] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[59:40] hath quickened us together with Christ
[59:44] by grace ye are saved and hath raised us
[59:50] up together and made us sit together in
[59:54] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[59:59] that in the ages to come he might show
[1:00:03] the exceeding riches of his grace and
[1:00:08] kindness towards us through Christ
[1:00:10] Jesus. For by grace ye are saved through
[1:00:14] faith
[1:00:16] and not of yourselves. It is the gift of
[1:00:20] God,
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; not of works, lest any man should boast.
[1:00:26] Heavenly Father, bless your word. In
[1:00:27] your precious name we pray. Amen. You
[1:00:30] may be seated.
[1:00:39] We know that uh and we're taught
[1:00:43] that
[1:00:45] we're and then I'd like to uh greet all
[1:00:48] the campers that are at Inks Lake. If
[1:00:52] you're listening in this morning, I hope
[1:00:55] that you're you're all warm and
[1:00:59] everything even though it's freezing
[1:01:01] outside. But we want to greet our
[1:01:03] campers. they may be listening online
[1:01:06] this morning.
[1:01:08] We know we're in a great battle. I think
[1:01:11] that's one of the things that we we were
[1:01:15] taught that that there this battle
[1:01:18] started in heaven. And it was a battle
[1:01:21] between two kingdoms.
[1:01:24] And the Lord our God had a a kingdom
[1:01:29] that he was going to set up. and his
[1:01:32] kingdom was going to be a kingdom that
[1:01:36] was lived by and and its glory would be
[1:01:41] the attributes of God. That's what his
[1:01:45] kingdom wanted to be. It wanted to be
[1:01:48] one that was a kingdom that that God
[1:01:52] could reflect himself through who he was
[1:01:57] and and what his greatness was. and he
[1:02:01] he chose this kingdom and in doing so he
[1:02:06] created a garden
[1:02:08] and uh you you've got to uh realize God
[1:02:14] could have created anything he wanted to
[1:02:17] you know all things are made by him but
[1:02:21] he chose to create a garden and he chose
[1:02:24] to have a son uh in that garden that
[1:02:28] ruled that garden and he would speak and
[1:02:31] this and and speak that and this would
[1:02:34] come to pass and and these different
[1:02:37] things would transpire and he would rule
[1:02:40] over this garden and then God would come
[1:02:43] down in the evening and walk with his
[1:02:47] son and God saw that he his son was
[1:02:51] lonely and he said it's not good that
[1:02:54] man should dwell alone so he made for
[1:02:57] him a helpmate and He took from him a
[1:03:01] part of his side and and created woman.
[1:03:06] And Adam said, "She's bone of my bone,
[1:03:08] flesh of my flesh." And now these two
[1:03:10] were one. And they were in fellowship
[1:03:13] with him. And they walked with him. And
[1:03:16] they were living in this kingdom.
[1:03:20] And this kingdom was the way that God
[1:03:23] wanted it to be. his son and his
[1:03:25] daughter were the way that he wanted
[1:03:29] them to be. And it was the fellowship
[1:03:31] and the attributes and the glory of God.
[1:03:35] I I I wish in my mind I I had even
[1:03:39] comprehend it, but it hasn't even
[1:03:41] entered into our hearts and minds the
[1:03:44] things that God has prepared for them
[1:03:46] that love him. And so this these
[1:03:50] kingdoms are are uh
[1:03:54] what was God's kingdom.
[1:03:58] Now we're in a battle today between two
[1:04:01] kingdoms because
[1:04:03] Lucifer, he did not
[1:04:06] uh if I could say this, he felt that God
[1:04:10] was making his kingdom short.
[1:04:13] In other words, were so much science and
[1:04:16] education and and there was so much
[1:04:18] fruits in the tree of knowledge that
[1:04:21] that that God had chose not to manifest
[1:04:25] or or to share. And and he felt that
[1:04:29] these things should be shared that that
[1:04:32] science should be shared and mathematics
[1:04:35] and civilization. And Satan had uh he he
[1:04:39] had a desire for a kingdom or his Eden.
[1:04:45] So God had an Eden, but Satan desired in
[1:04:48] Eden. He desired to be worshiped. So you
[1:04:53] have to see that within Satan, within
[1:04:55] this tree of good and evil, this tree of
[1:04:59] knowledge, all laid within him, all
[1:05:03] these other uh scientific things and
[1:05:07] achievements of space and technology and
[1:05:11] and minerals and all the knowledge of of
[1:05:15] all those things that could be. And God
[1:05:19] chose not to go that way.
[1:05:23] But Satan wanted to be worshiped
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; as God was worshiped.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; So he wanted to instill
[1:05:32] or to bring forth his Eden what what he
[1:05:37] thought man should be. And so he he came
[1:05:41] into that garden and he he began to
[1:05:47] uh speak in that garden and began to
[1:05:50] fellowship with Eve. And and so when
[1:05:54] they would go through the midst of the
[1:05:56] garden, uh the serpent or or the beast,
[1:06:01] he was in the midst of the ar of the
[1:06:05] garden. In other words, the person, this
[1:06:08] angel Lucifer that was cast down to
[1:06:12] earth because he he desired to be
[1:06:15] worshiped and and exalt himself above
[1:06:19] above the sons of God. He desired to put
[1:06:22] his Eden into existence and and he
[1:06:27] didn't he didn't want to uh wait. God
[1:06:30] may have had another time for him.
[1:06:33] There's so many things we don't know
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; and uh we might imagine or come up with
[1:06:39] reasons but nevertheless he wanted to
[1:06:43] get his message across to Eve. So what
[1:06:48] he spoke to her, he says if if if you
[1:06:50] come with me and you be a part of me, he
[1:06:54] says the reason he doesn't want you to
[1:06:57] eat these fruits
[1:06:59] to to partake of my knowledge, to
[1:07:01] partake of my wisdom, to partake of my
[1:07:04] ways, the reason he doesn't want you to
[1:07:07] fellowship with me and become part of me
[1:07:10] because you'll become like gods,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; you know. So I have something to offer
[1:07:18] you, you know, uh I I have I have this
[1:07:22] great wisdom and this great knowledge
[1:07:24] and and and you'll be able to create and
[1:07:27] you'll be able to manufacture and you'll
[1:07:30] be able to invent
[1:07:32] and and you'll be able to to civilize
[1:07:35] and and and and grow and do all these
[1:07:39] great accomplishments, achievements. And
[1:07:42] if if you come with me and and join
[1:07:45] yourself to me, uh I will pass on to you
[1:07:52] all these great things that I know and I
[1:07:57] possess because I'm the tree of
[1:08:00] knowledge that is in the midst of the
[1:08:02] garden. I possess these things and God
[1:08:07] chose not to let me uh insert
[1:08:12] all my great wisdom and my great
[1:08:14] knowledge into this world,
[1:08:18] but I'm going to do it anyway.
[1:08:22] So he got a hold of Eve
[1:08:26] and Eve told them,
[1:08:29] he told us
[1:08:32] that you were here
[1:08:35] and he told us you had these great
[1:08:39] abilities,
[1:08:41] but he said, "The day that we parttook
[1:08:43] of them is the day we'll die."
[1:08:49] and his cunningness and his
[1:08:51] deceitfulness.
[1:08:53] He said, "Surely
[1:08:56] you won't die."
[1:08:58] No, you won't die. Surely you won't die.
[1:09:01] He just added one word,
[1:09:04] you know, and so she,
[1:09:07] if I could say it that way, she took the
[1:09:10] chance
[1:09:12] or she she failed
[1:09:15] to all that God had said.
[1:09:21] And we know that at that time
[1:09:26] that
[1:09:28] uh she partook
[1:09:30] of the fruits of Satan and and she
[1:09:35] brought this to
[1:09:37] her husband and and we won't go into
[1:09:42] that great story but but parttook of
[1:09:47] also.
[1:09:49] And then all of a sudden their eyes were
[1:09:51] opened and they realized
[1:09:56] what they had done. You know that so
[1:09:59] many times with our young people is that
[1:10:02] you know when you're on this side of sin
[1:10:06] and and you're being enticed and you're
[1:10:09] being led and and you're being talked to
[1:10:13] and and it's it's seduction. It's trying
[1:10:17] to get you to let down your bar. That
[1:10:22] it's always presented, sin's always
[1:10:25] presented a as being pleasant
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; and good,
[1:10:32] you know, uh, you know, just just smoke
[1:10:35] this. You It's great. It makes you feel
[1:10:38] good. Do this, drink this, listen to
[1:10:41] this, go here. You know, it it it's just
[1:10:44] like a a a boy tells a girl, "Oh, I love
[1:10:47] you. I love you. If you love me, you
[1:10:50] know, you'd kiss me. You hug me. You
[1:10:52] know, and and and all those things. It's
[1:10:55] just all is to get you to move your
[1:10:59] needle, to pull you over onto the side."
[1:11:02] And and what happens is listening to it,
[1:11:05] it it becomes beautiful. It becomes
[1:11:08] something. Oh, it could be a reality. It
[1:11:11] could be good. You know, a I'll tell you
[1:11:14] something. If a boy ever tells you to do
[1:11:17] something because if you love me, you
[1:11:20] would do this.
[1:11:22] That's the same line devil
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; that lied to Eve. A boy that loves you
[1:11:29] will want you to keep your virtue. He'll
[1:11:32] never try to invade that sacred trust
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; that God's given you. a real boy that
[1:11:41] really loves you.
[1:11:44] He'd never crossed that line.
[1:11:48] Becca were sinners.
[1:11:50] But before this, they they got there.
[1:11:53] Can it's the same thing. You get
[1:11:55] enticed, you get talked, sin becomes
[1:11:58] beautiful. But once you cross that line
[1:12:02] and you get on the other side and you
[1:12:04] realize what you've done, that's when
[1:12:08] the dread sets in.
[1:12:11] That's when the conviction sets in.
[1:12:14] That's when the darkness sets in. That
[1:12:17] that's when you get discouraged. Even
[1:12:20] now as Christians, when we fail, we
[1:12:23] become so discouraged and so disgusted
[1:12:27] with ourselves, you know, how could I do
[1:12:30] it? How could I fail? How could I I do
[1:12:33] that? like like the alcoholic who maybe
[1:12:36] goes so many years and then he gets
[1:12:38] under pressure and he takes a drink and
[1:12:40] he falls off the wagon so to speak and
[1:12:44] now he's so defeated.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; And when Adam and Eve cross over that
[1:12:51] line,
[1:12:53] they were defeated.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that they were
[1:12:58] totally defeated.
[1:13:01] And the only thing that awaited them was
[1:13:06] the judgment of God.
[1:13:11] You understand that God said, "The day
[1:13:14] that
[1:13:16] you eat, that day you shall die."
[1:13:20] And they were gone.
[1:13:24] And so if I had a title this morning,
[1:13:28] won't try not to be long,
[1:13:31] but I'd like to call this grace and
[1:13:34] mercy
[1:13:36] is the believer's greatest weapon.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; The greatest weapon against Satan
[1:13:45] is grace
[1:13:48] and mercy. As our brother saying, it was
[1:13:52] mercy
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; that rewrote our lives.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Paul was talking here. He says, "We were
[1:13:59] once here. We once did these things. We
[1:14:02] once walked in things." In another
[1:14:04] place, Peter said, "A man that can't see
[1:14:06] these things can't see a far off and
[1:14:09] forgot where he's come from."
[1:14:14] That is the source of all
[1:14:17] self-righteousness
[1:14:19] is a man that can't see where he's come
[1:14:22] from.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; He forgets that he too once was a sinner
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; and that he once walked in the in those
[1:14:30] places. But if it wasn't for the grace
[1:14:33] and mercy of God.
[1:14:36] Paul comes up and he says he says we
[1:14:39] once did these things but he said God
[1:14:42] who is rich in mercy
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; for his great love towards us loved us
[1:14:50] when we were dead in sins he hath
[1:14:53] quickened us together in Christ Jesus
[1:14:55] for by grace
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; ye are saved
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; so Adam and Eve were now in the clutches
[1:15:05] es of the enemy.
[1:15:10] You understand they stepped out of the
[1:15:14] protection of God's word.
[1:15:19] Remember when you step out from behind
[1:15:22] the word, you step out of the protection
[1:15:26] of God. Now you're subject
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; to the results of that decision.
[1:15:37] So the the the results of that decision
[1:15:42] are inevitable.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; In other words, the only thing that Adam
[1:15:47] and Eve had coming to them now was
[1:15:50] death.
[1:15:53] So Satan had achieved what he wanted to
[1:15:56] achieve.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; He had placed himself in rulership
[1:16:02] over Adam and Eve.
[1:16:05] Now he ruled them.
[1:16:09] They given up.
[1:16:11] Paul comes back. He says we were once
[1:16:13] all under this great power,
[1:16:17] this great influence as
[1:16:21] has as he said, we walked according to
[1:16:24] the course of the world by the prince of
[1:16:28] the power of the air, the spirit that
[1:16:32] now workketh.
[1:16:34] So now Adam and Eve had the spirit of
[1:16:40] the power of the air working in them. I
[1:16:45] want you to see that if I could I wish I
[1:16:48] was a greater speaker uh to uh
[1:16:53] uh bring this point but you you have to
[1:16:55] help me this morning. So they were
[1:16:58] helpless.
[1:17:01] So the inevitable
[1:17:04] result of their
[1:17:07] decision was looming and pending and
[1:17:12] about to be carried out.
[1:17:14] Now the only
[1:17:17] now they were defenseless
[1:17:20] against Satan.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; He had already broken them.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; He had broke their will. He had broke
[1:17:27] their spirit. They did what they done
[1:17:30] and there was no undoing it.
[1:17:35] And we all come into that same place
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; in our lives. We do things, but we do
[1:17:41] things now. We're discouraged and angry
[1:17:46] that we've done them. We can't undo
[1:17:49] them. We can't deny it. We could cover
[1:17:52] it. We could cover it re with religion,
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; but nevertheless, we within our own
[1:17:58] selves know that where we're at.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; So now, what is our defense
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; against Satan?
[1:18:09] H how how do I come from now being
[1:18:13] trapped and now being the prisoner of
[1:18:16] sin and and now being ruled by this
[1:18:19] power of the prince and the power of the
[1:18:22] air? I have no weapon.
[1:18:28] But the only weapon
[1:18:31] that had against Satan was the mercy and
[1:18:38] grace of God.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; That was their only way out.
[1:18:47] It was their only way to defeat him. It
[1:18:51] was the only way to be set free was by
[1:18:54] grace
[1:18:56] and by mercy.
[1:18:58] Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; That God would look on them and say, "I
[1:19:02] know what I said, but I'll provide
[1:19:06] a way.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; I'll step in." Grace
[1:19:15] is when the inevitable outcome and the
[1:19:18] pending outcome is inevitable. In other
[1:19:22] words, it's going to happen. But God
[1:19:25] chooses to intervene and change the
[1:19:29] inevitable outcome.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; That's grace.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Grace
[1:19:39] is
[1:19:42] our weapon
[1:19:45] and mercy
[1:19:48] becomes our weapon. It becomes the only
[1:19:52] defense.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; The only thing that we have
[1:19:59] that keeps us from being completely
[1:20:03] destroyed.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; What was going to happen to Adam and Eve
[1:20:08] was going to happen. So God provided
[1:20:12] them. I want you to look at if I could
[1:20:16] place that in your thinking. He provided
[1:20:18] for them. The only weapon
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; that would defeat Satan was his mercy.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And his grace.
[1:20:32] Paul said, "You were all there, but God
[1:20:36] rich
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; in mercy
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; cuz his mercy endureth forever."
[1:20:47] And grace
[1:20:50] is the intervention
[1:20:53] and the application
[1:20:56] of that mercy.
[1:20:59] So grace and mercy became their only way
[1:21:04] in the days of Noah
[1:21:07] when the world got so corrupt
[1:21:14] that it was totally going to be
[1:21:16] destroyed.
[1:21:20] Man had finally crossed over the line.
[1:21:22] God couldn't take it anymore.
[1:21:27] And he said within himself, I'm going to
[1:21:30] destroy
[1:21:32] the whole thing.
[1:21:37] But then the only weapon
[1:21:41] man had
[1:21:43] against the impending destruction
[1:21:47] was God's mercy.
[1:21:51] now and his grace
[1:21:55] to take that mercy
[1:21:58] and put it in action
[1:22:02] and change the impending
[1:22:05] destruction
[1:22:07] that was going to come upon the earth
[1:22:11] and provide man a way of escape.
[1:22:17] And he built an ark.
[1:22:20] God's always provided man
[1:22:24] way
[1:22:26] of mercy.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; And and we're in a battle.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; We know that we're in a battle between
[1:22:36] these two kingdoms.
[1:22:39] And the and and the life I is is a
[1:22:43] warfare.
[1:22:45] And Satan warth against us. He's
[1:22:48] continually
[1:22:50] wanting to present to us his kingdom,
[1:22:54] his ideas, his way of doing things, the
[1:22:57] things that he thinks is right. You
[1:23:00] know, man is always trying to to come up
[1:23:04] with his own code of justice
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; and his own code of fairness. But there
[1:23:11] had to be something that was the the
[1:23:13] north star. There had to be something
[1:23:16] that was the beginning of all
[1:23:19] righteousness. And the beginning of all
[1:23:22] righteousness is God's word
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; because he's the creator.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; So he's the original
[1:23:33] and any other thought and any other idea
[1:23:37] other than the original is a
[1:23:40] counterfeit.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; It's bogus.
[1:23:44] And when somebody has got the expertise,
[1:23:50] they can look at a bogus dollar or a
[1:23:54] counterfeit dollar in a real dollar and
[1:23:57] tell you what's real.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; A painting, a real expert can tell you
[1:24:04] that it's what's real and what's not.
[1:24:08] Well, this counterfeit of Satan is so
[1:24:10] close.
[1:24:15] It would deceive those
[1:24:19] who didn't have the weapon
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; of grace and mercy.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Without grace,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; without mercy, you too would be
[1:24:34] deceived.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; You too once walked in the darkness of
[1:24:40] this world. You too once were entangled
[1:24:43] in the by the power and the spirit of
[1:24:47] the prince of power that works in the
[1:24:49] air, principality and spiritual
[1:24:52] wickedness in high places. You too were
[1:24:55] subject to those things.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; But by grace
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; and mercy.
[1:25:05] That's the weapon
[1:25:08] that defeated Satan.
[1:25:14] Without it, we're doomed.
[1:25:19] The the battles between these two
[1:25:21] kingdoms,
[1:25:25] the word of God, and man keeps coming up
[1:25:29] with what he thinks is righteous.
[1:25:33] He he he he doesn't think it's righteous
[1:25:36] that we should discriminate or preach
[1:25:40] against or speak against
[1:25:43] human choice.
[1:25:47] If a man chooses he wants to be a woman
[1:25:50] or a woman chooses she wants to be a
[1:25:53] man, you you shouldn't speak against
[1:25:56] that.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; That's human righteousness.
[1:26:03] That's the carnal mind.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; And the carnal mind is an enemy of God.
[1:26:09] It's at emnity. In other words, it can't
[1:26:12] fit.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; It can't blend.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And that's what Leo see is. These two
[1:26:19] kingdoms are opposed one to another.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; They were opposed one to another in the
[1:26:26] beginning. And that battle came from
[1:26:28] heaven down to earth. And it ended up in
[1:26:31] the Garden of Eden. And that battle's
[1:26:33] still going on today.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; And we know where that battle is.
[1:26:42] It's in your mind.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Satan is always pouring stuff
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; into our mind.
[1:26:54] He's always trying to bring us under
[1:26:57] captivity.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; And God's always trying to set the
[1:27:03] captive free.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring your mind under
[1:27:09] captivity. He's trying to bring your the
[1:27:12] the history of your wrongdoing against
[1:27:16] you. He's trying to make you feel
[1:27:18] hopeless. He He's trying to make you
[1:27:21] feel that that the impending doom of
[1:27:25] your actions will be upon you, that now
[1:27:28] you've done wrong and and now you're
[1:27:30] going to receive the the the the
[1:27:33] benefits of it. And and and you would
[1:27:36] reap what you sow, but the only WEAPON
[1:27:39] YOU HAVE AGAINST IT is the mercy and
[1:27:43] grace of God.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] Do you understand? I'm trying that. It's
[1:27:52] your weapon.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; If you didn't have that working for you,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; do you think you could find your way
[1:28:05] back?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; You couldn't find your way back to God
[1:28:13] for nothing.
[1:28:16] your carnality,
[1:28:18] your human mind,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; your nature,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; your common everyday mistakes
[1:28:27] would make it seem totally impossible
[1:28:30] for you ever to get back into the favor
[1:28:37] of God.
[1:28:42] You wouldn't even think, "How could I
[1:28:43] ever get back in this grace?
[1:28:46] How could I ever get back in this favor?
[1:28:49] How could I ever get back to where I
[1:28:51] could feel in my heart, if God be for
[1:28:55] me, who can be against me?
[1:29:00] I I I I I look at my life and I I see a
[1:29:05] shipwreck.
[1:29:08] I see a failure.
[1:29:11] What? How am I going to get from this
[1:29:14] condition
[1:29:16] back to peace
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; and joy
[1:29:22] that surpasseth all understanding?
[1:29:27] How am I going to get back to freedom?
[1:29:31] What what do I have that that I've got
[1:29:34] that can fight the condition I'm in that
[1:29:39] can fight the mistakes that I've made,
[1:29:41] the the failures that I've accumulated?
[1:29:45] You know, I I I I crossed the line so
[1:29:48] many times. What do I have
[1:29:52] to bring me back? There's only one
[1:29:55] weapon
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; you have against Satan, and that's grace
[1:30:00] and mercy.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; It's the only thing you have.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; It's his mercy
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; and his grace.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; And his grace endureth forever.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And his mercies endureth
[1:30:22] forever.
[1:30:24] It's the only thing that man has
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; else he would be defeated.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Paul goes on to say, "But not of works,
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; lest any man should boast.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; It's by grace and by mercy. By grace ye
[1:30:43] are saved through faith,
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. It is the
[1:30:50] gift OF GOD." HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; It's God's gift to you.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; It's God's weapon.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; The only thing he's given you that you
[1:31:05] can defeat this man with this evil
[1:31:08] kingdom that wars against you, that's
[1:31:11] seeking TO DEVOUR YOU, THAT'S TRYING to
[1:31:13] get you to be a member, THAT'S TRYING TO
[1:31:16] GET you to become UNDER ITS POWER. AND
[1:31:18] THERE'S STILL TOO MANY OF US TODAY THAT
[1:31:21] ARE UNDER THE POWER OF THE WORLD.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; But praise God, there's a way out.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God, we have a weapon
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; that defeats him every time.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And it's grace
[1:31:44] and mercy.
[1:31:47] If you read the book of Psalms,
[1:31:51] David is in this battle.
[1:31:54] He knows where he came from.
[1:32:00] He was a shepherd boy.
[1:32:06] Didn't have no ability to be king.
[1:32:11] Doesn't have any influence.
[1:32:15] doesn't have anything
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; but election.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; The only thing he has. God said, "I'll
[1:32:27] choose David
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take him from the
[1:32:30] sheephold and I'm going to put him on
[1:32:32] the throne."
[1:32:37] David didn't know he didn't have any
[1:32:39] ability, but he trusted
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; in the grace of God.
[1:32:46] He trusted that God would intervene,
[1:32:53] that the inevitable outcome of his
[1:32:56] decisions,
[1:32:59] that God would insert himself
[1:33:03] and change the outcome
[1:33:06] of his actions.
[1:33:12] If people do certain things,
[1:33:15] if you put
[1:33:17] water in your gasoline,
[1:33:20] the inevitable outcome
[1:33:24] that car is going to sputter and die.
[1:33:30] You understand what I mean by the
[1:33:31] inevitable outcome. Another the actions
[1:33:35] produce these results.
[1:33:38] That's why they say the definition of
[1:33:41] insanity is to keep doing the same
[1:33:43] things over and over again and expect a
[1:33:47] different result.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Well, the only way you'll ever get a
[1:33:52] different result is the grace of God.
[1:34:02] I don't care what pattern your life is
[1:34:04] in.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; That pattern may produce the same thing.
[1:34:09] But if the weapon of God comes into your
[1:34:12] life, WHICH IS THE GRACE OF GOD, it'll
[1:34:15] change that pattern.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; It'll change that result. Right.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; That's your weapon.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; That's what he gave us.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; That's what we know that we have.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; When Satan starts beating down on us and
[1:34:37] destroying us and taking our joy from us
[1:34:40] and taking our life from us and taking
[1:34:43] our will to go forward and putting us
[1:34:45] into give up, I JUST DON'T GOT IT. I
[1:34:49] JUST CAN'T LIVE IT. I JUST CAN'T MAKE
[1:34:51] IT. THERE'S ONE THING THAT YOU HAVE.
[1:34:54] THAT'S GOD'S MERCY.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; That is merciful.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we don't get what we deserve.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; But what made the difference?
[1:35:14] Mercy, brother.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Rewrote
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; my life.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; That was the only weapon I had against
[1:35:23] Satan. Satan, you've got me. I'm
[1:35:26] trapped.
[1:35:29] You've tricked me into it. You've put me
[1:35:31] in this condition. I'm in bad shape.
[1:35:35] I'm a failure.
[1:35:40] What
[1:35:42] do I have
[1:35:44] to redeem me? What do I have? What's the
[1:35:48] only thing I've got?
[1:35:51] My impending doom?
[1:35:56] Mercy.
[1:36:00] Mercy.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Have mercy on me,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:36:09] have mercy.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Please, by your grace,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Don't let me receive
[1:36:20] what I've got coming to me.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; I plead grace and mercy.
[1:36:27] Grace and mercy is is
[1:36:30] why that he went to the cross.
[1:36:33] Not only did he provide the way for Adam
[1:36:36] and Eve by God through promise, God will
[1:36:39] said, "I'll put enmity between thy seed
[1:36:42] and the serpent seed." In other words,
[1:36:44] I'LL BREAK THE CHAIN and the power of
[1:36:49] the sin that's GOING TO BE PASSED ON
[1:36:51] FROM FATHER TO DAUGHTER to son to after
[1:36:55] generations and generations. That man
[1:36:58] was born in sin, came into the world
[1:37:01] speaking lies, full of iniquity.
[1:37:05] He said, "That's the chain.
[1:37:09] That's the inevitable result.
[1:37:14] That's the fruit
[1:37:17] by which Satan is going to build his
[1:37:20] kingdom.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; He's going to build it on lies.
[1:37:29] And everybody's going to come into the
[1:37:31] world speaking those lies.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; They start in kindergarten,
[1:37:39] speaking the lies,
[1:37:42] getting you educated, getting more
[1:37:44] money,
[1:37:46] getting a higher living, doing this,
[1:37:50] find your place in the kingdom.
[1:37:53] They get counselors.
[1:37:55] I'll never forget it. I couldn't believe
[1:37:58] it. I went to one of those counselors
[1:37:59] and they had me fill out all this paper
[1:38:03] and and and everything and and uh this
[1:38:06] is no insult to my good friend uh James
[1:38:10] Hayes, but they decided that I'd make a
[1:38:13] good airplane pilot.
[1:38:19] That's what they said I should become,
[1:38:21] an airplane pilot.
[1:38:24] Well,
[1:38:26] I decided I'd find something that took
[1:38:28] me a lot farther than the sky.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; But that was only by grace.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; That's what they wanted me to do. Pick a
[1:38:36] career.
[1:38:39] Pick a a way that you'll go. I mean,
[1:38:42] it's embred in us because Satan is
[1:38:45] preaching his kingdom, right? What
[1:38:48] you're going to do is you're going to
[1:38:49] live and then you're going to either
[1:38:51] have wealth to pass it down to your
[1:38:54] generation and pass your inheritance
[1:38:57] down and and and that and you get into
[1:39:00] this whole mindset and this whole world
[1:39:04] uh and you get all the burdens with it.
[1:39:06] You got to go to school and you got to
[1:39:08] work two jobs and you got to do this and
[1:39:11] it becomes a whole weight,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:16] And he's been selling us that forever.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; And here comes one along full of grace
[1:39:24] and mercy. And he says, "I've never seen
[1:39:26] the righteous bake bread."
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; A man that's tasted of the mercy and
[1:39:34] grace of God is content in whatever
[1:39:37] state he's in.
[1:39:41] He doesn't need the riches of the world
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; because he's rich in faith.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; He's got faith
[1:39:51] to know that he has a merciful God
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; and a God full of grace and that that
[1:39:59] grace is sufficient for us because his
[1:40:02] strength is made perfect in our
[1:40:06] weakness.
[1:40:08] Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And we start to veer
[1:40:14] and we start to let this influence of
[1:40:16] the world come in. And then we decide
[1:40:19] that we have to come up with some sort
[1:40:22] form of works to be righteous. And now
[1:40:25] we're stuck in the cycle of our flesh
[1:40:29] trying to find our reward or find our
[1:40:33] liberty or find our freedom or find our
[1:40:37] deliverance. And you'll never find
[1:40:39] deliverance. You'll never find freedom.
[1:40:42] You'll never find escape outside the
[1:40:45] mercy and grace of God because that's
[1:40:49] our weapon.
[1:40:53] That's the one thing that you possess.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; That defeats the enemy
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; is God's grace and his mercy.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; You can look on your children and they
[1:41:11] may seem hopeless.
[1:41:13] I know what it's like when teenagers get
[1:41:16] rebellious and they just quit listening
[1:41:18] to you and now they finally think that
[1:41:20] that's the day that they can whoop you.
[1:41:26] I don't care. I could never whoop my
[1:41:28] dad. I don't know. I was always
[1:41:32] I I wouldn't even want to get in a fight
[1:41:33] with him.
[1:41:37] I don't know.
[1:41:41] But you know, you get to the place you
[1:41:43] just don't think you have to listen and
[1:41:45] you want to go to the mall and they
[1:41:47] don't want you to go to the mall because
[1:41:48] they know there's nothing but a bunch of
[1:41:50] devils down at the mall. But oh, you
[1:41:52] just want to go to the mall. That's
[1:41:54] where everybody's going. wide is the way
[1:41:56] to the destruction.
[1:42:01] And you're going to get there and then
[1:42:03] you're going to start playing those
[1:42:05] games and some little boy's going to
[1:42:06] walk around and he thinks you're cute
[1:42:08] and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1:42:10] blah.
[1:42:13] And then you think you're in love.
[1:42:16] Oh, I met the cutest little boy at the
[1:42:18] mall. And you just got to go down to the
[1:42:21] mall so you can get another look at him.
[1:42:27] and you're just going
[1:42:35] gone wrong.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And then what are you going to do?
[1:42:41] You're going to have to rely
[1:42:44] on the grace and mercy of God
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; to make your life right again.
[1:42:54] Like we were talking of David.
[1:42:58] You know what David's sin was?
[1:43:02] Everybody thinks it's Bath Sheba.
[1:43:05] But it started before that.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; It started when he began to count his
[1:43:10] might.
[1:43:13] And he be started began to look at
[1:43:16] his kingdom
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; and he and he started listening to the
[1:43:21] people sing of his exploits.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Saul's kind killed a thousand but
[1:43:26] David's killed 10,000
[1:43:30] that drove Paul
[1:43:32] to want to smite David. And David was on
[1:43:36] the run just the type of Christ. his
[1:43:39] whole life was playing out and he relied
[1:43:42] on the mercy and he relied on the grace
[1:43:45] of God. Even I believe it was Abigail,
[1:43:47] wasn't it, that came and fell at his
[1:43:49] feet and says, "My husband's a foolish
[1:43:51] man." He speaks to the foolish man. I
[1:43:54] know that you're king.
[1:43:57] Be merciful.
[1:43:59] And David showed mercy. But when David
[1:44:02] quit relying on that mercy,
[1:44:06] when he kept quit relying on that grace
[1:44:10] where that no longer became his weapon
[1:44:14] to fight the enemy
[1:44:17] and he began to count for himself his
[1:44:21] works.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; That's
[1:44:27] when he began to fail.
[1:44:32] And when he got in that condition, then
[1:44:34] he felt he he could do what he had to do
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; for Basha.
[1:44:42] He departed from his weapon.
[1:44:48] Do you understand what I'm saying? The
[1:44:50] weapon you have against Satan is God's
[1:44:54] mercy.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; You've got to call on that mercy. You've
[1:44:59] got to ask for that grace.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Without you, Lord, I cannot make this
[1:45:04] journey.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; I will not be in the rapture without
[1:45:10] your grace and your mercy.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; I will not be over to overcome.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; It's given to the overcomer. How do we
[1:45:20] overcome? We overcome by grace.
[1:45:26] by God intervening in our lives and
[1:45:30] changing the outcome of our mistakes.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; You can get a bitter heart
[1:45:41] and a bitter spirit.
[1:45:45] You know, if you get mad at your
[1:45:47] parents, they're not going to quit
[1:45:48] loving you.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; But you're going to be all tore up
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; and it's all going on in your head.
[1:46:02] And then it goes into your heart and it
[1:46:04] goes into your feelings and it goes into
[1:46:06] your actions and you don't even realize
[1:46:09] how ridiculous
[1:46:11] it is.
[1:46:14] We used to kind of
[1:46:17] laugh at our kids when they were
[1:46:18] younger. They would try to go sit
[1:46:20] someplace else so nobody would know that
[1:46:22] they belong to us.
[1:46:28] Yeah. They walk up to Matthew GO, "YOU
[1:46:30] LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR DADDY."
[1:46:33] Who's that?
[1:46:35] They knew who they were.
[1:46:38] Wasn't
[1:46:40] that what we want to start coming is
[1:46:42] knowing who we are?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; We're the children of the living God.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; We're in a battle. Satan's always
[1:46:50] imposing the world on us.
[1:46:54] And if we depart
[1:46:57] from grace and mercy as being our weapon
[1:47:02] against the enemy,
[1:47:06] if we don't rely on his mercy, we don't
[1:47:10] rely on his grace,
[1:47:14] then we're doomed.
[1:47:17] And when David finally came back
[1:47:21] to the grace and mercy of God
[1:47:25] and he went back to the righteous
[1:47:27] judgments of God and he pronounced his
[1:47:30] own death,
[1:47:33] let the man who's done this be slain.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:40] In other words, David finally got back
[1:47:42] to the place is I'm worthy of death for
[1:47:47] what I've done.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; And the stamina said, "David, it's you.
[1:47:56] You took that man's
[1:48:00] lamb.
[1:48:02] You killed that man. You're guilty."
[1:48:07] And you know what David said? Let it be
[1:48:10] un done unto me even as I've declared
[1:48:14] it.
[1:48:19] He was willing to die
[1:48:21] for his sin.
[1:48:26] We'd be a lot better off having that
[1:48:28] attitude than trying to cover it up with
[1:48:32] some sort of carnal
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; uh excuse.
[1:48:38] As a prophet of God said, passing the
[1:48:40] buck.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, he made me do it.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; That's what Eve did.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, Adam did. Oh, she made me do it.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Always trying to pass the buck.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; David said, "Let it be done unto me."
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; David was facing the impending
[1:49:01] outcome of his decisions.
[1:49:05] But what saved David?
[1:49:09] Saul said, "He has mercy on you
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; and grace."
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; All through the Bible,
[1:49:20] when you read the when you read the
[1:49:25] the New Testament,
[1:49:29] remember the New Testament was the
[1:49:31] exodus
[1:49:32] from law
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; to grace.
[1:49:37] where man was no longer going to live by
[1:49:39] the law, but they were going to live by
[1:49:43] the grace and mercy of God. They were
[1:49:46] going to live by God.
[1:49:51] now
[1:49:54] having mercy
[1:49:57] and inserting himself
[1:50:01] into the equation
[1:50:03] to change what the result would be. So
[1:50:08] God changes the result of man's
[1:50:11] decisions by grace.
[1:50:16] And now he was passing from the age of
[1:50:21] law to the age of grace and mercy. Now
[1:50:26] grace and mercy was going to become
[1:50:30] man's weapon, not the law. And they come
[1:50:34] upon a lady, Mary Magdalene,
[1:50:41] and she's caught in adultery.
[1:50:48] And now she's fixing to be stoned.
[1:50:54] That's what they did.
[1:50:59] They took it out and they would stone
[1:51:02] it.
[1:51:05] Her doom was set.
[1:51:10] The impending doom of her decisions
[1:51:14] were set.
[1:51:17] But there came one
[1:51:20] on the scene
[1:51:24] and he started writing, "Which of you
[1:51:27] that hath no sin cast the first stone?"
[1:51:33] What saved
[1:51:36] Mary Magdalene
[1:51:38] from the sin
[1:51:40] that Satan trapped her into
[1:51:45] wasn't the law.
[1:51:48] Did you know if she would have been
[1:51:50] stoned, she would have paid the
[1:51:52] punishment
[1:51:54] for that sin
[1:51:56] and she may have had a path to heaven.
[1:52:04] That's what the law did.
[1:52:08] It purged them.
[1:52:11] It purged the sin out.
[1:52:16] How many of you want to live under that?
[1:52:20] That's why they had priests and they had
[1:52:22] judges and it got more complicated and
[1:52:25] washing of pots and pans and and it got
[1:52:28] all that place and he come down and he
[1:52:30] said all the commandments
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; are all in these. Love thy neighbor as
[1:52:36] thyself and love God with your whole
[1:52:39] mind, your whole heart, your whole soul.
[1:52:41] It was a transition from the law
[1:52:45] to grace.
[1:52:47] And there she was. And he says, he
[1:52:51] finally looks at her and says, "Where
[1:52:53] are your accusers?"
[1:52:57] And she says, "There's none, Lord, to
[1:53:01] accuse me but you." And he said,
[1:53:04] "Neither will I
[1:53:08] accuse you.
[1:53:10] Go your way.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; I have mercy on you.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; The grace of God has showed up
[1:53:21] to keep you from the impending outcome
[1:53:26] of your actions.
[1:53:30] Grace and mercy
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; was Magdalina's only weapon
[1:53:38] against what Satan had done.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; She couldn't undo it.
[1:53:48] She couldn't have blamed anybody else.
[1:53:52] But God,
[1:53:54] rich in mercy
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; and full of grace.
[1:54:00] Legion.
[1:54:02] The man possessed with devils.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Full of devils.
[1:54:11] How many? What's your name? Legion. He
[1:54:14] had devils. A legion of devils. He was
[1:54:18] possessed of the devil.
[1:54:21] He would throw on people. He'd roam the
[1:54:24] graveyards.
[1:54:26] They try to chain him.
[1:54:31] How was he gonna get out of that
[1:54:32] condition?
[1:54:35] No way.
[1:54:37] He couldn't think his way out of it.
[1:54:41] He couldn't act his way out of it. The
[1:54:44] only weapon
[1:54:46] that Legion had against the demons that
[1:54:50] possessed him was the mercy
[1:54:54] and grace of God.
[1:55:00] Do you understand that? That's your
[1:55:02] weapon.
[1:55:06] It's what God's given
[1:55:09] us to defeat him. That's right.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Is his mercy, his love wherein he so
[1:55:15] loved us, he gave his only begotten son.
[1:55:20] Where God who is rich in mercy for his
[1:55:23] great love wherein he loved us.
[1:55:30] Even when we were dead in sin, hath
[1:55:34] quickened us together with him.
[1:55:38] By grace
[1:55:41] ye are saved.
[1:55:44] What a great weapon. The only way she
[1:55:48] had to escape Satan was the grace and
[1:55:52] mercy of God.
[1:55:54] The 10 lepers, the only way they had to
[1:55:57] escape the 10 lepers with leprosy
[1:56:02] was the grace and mercy of God.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; That was their only way out of leprosy.
[1:56:08] Leprosy is a type of sin.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:13] Leprosy is a type of habitual
[1:56:16] sin,
[1:56:18] habit forming sin
[1:56:21] where it now becomes a part of your
[1:56:23] life.
[1:56:24] You incorporate it in your life. You go
[1:56:28] about all the other things that you do
[1:56:30] in life normal except for your one
[1:56:32] addiction.
[1:56:36] Whether it's smoking, whether it's
[1:56:39] drugs,
[1:56:40] whether it's anger,
[1:56:43] whether it's temper, whether it's
[1:56:46] bitterness,
[1:56:49] you know, and sins are imaginations,
[1:56:54] all those things
[1:56:57] we cast down.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; And it's a leprosy.
[1:57:04] It's a spot and a wrinkle.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Then the only way of escape,
[1:57:12] you have no power over it.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; If you smoke,
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; that's a tough devil.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; You can try patches. You can try
[1:57:30] everything.
[1:57:35] But you know what's your weapon is?
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Mercy
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; and grace.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; God have mercy on me.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Give me your grace.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Father, take this from me.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Take my fault. Take my anger. Take my
[1:57:53] bitterness. Take my loneliness. Take all
[1:57:56] these things that Satan has put on my
[1:58:00] life. Oh, this might not seem like the
[1:58:03] great deep revelation.
[1:58:07] I could preach to you about the four
[1:58:09] horse riders and the son of man and God
[1:58:11] veiling himself in this last day and and
[1:58:15] how that the son of man's work and how
[1:58:18] that you now are the word of God and and
[1:58:21] you are the voice of God to this
[1:58:23] generation and and and you're the brideg
[1:58:27] of Christ. You're the bride now. But let
[1:58:30] me tell you something. The prophet of
[1:58:31] God said, "If Satan can take your weapon
[1:58:35] away from you, you become as a sounding
[1:58:39] temple,
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; a sounding brass, a tinkling symbol.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; You have all this revelation
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; and you have no victory.
[1:58:54] You don't lay your hands on the sick and
[1:58:56] they get well by your power.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; You lay your hands on the sick get well
[1:59:02] by the grace and mercy of God.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; If we could get grace and mercy down,
[1:59:14] THEN WE WOULD UNDERSTAND IT'S BY HIS
[1:59:16] mercy we see the seals.
[1:59:19] IT'S BY HIS GRACE we recognize Malachi
[1:59:23] 4:5.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; You didn't choose me. I chose you.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; It's by his grace and mercy we see we're
[1:59:32] in Lady Oia.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; We understand what it is
[1:59:38] we have working for us.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; What's working for us is grace
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; and mercy.
[1:59:51] I don't care how bad you are.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; I could just I'd like to read the way
[1:59:56] the brother Brandham said it if it would
[2:00:00] be all right
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; with you,
[2:00:05] but he says it like this.
[2:00:08] Let me say this,
[2:00:11] my sinner friend.
[2:00:13] You may be here this morning a
[2:00:15] prostitute.
[2:00:18] We wouldn't know it, would we?
[2:00:25] Maybe be here this morning
[2:00:28] a woman chaser.
[2:00:31] You may be here a drunkard or a gambler
[2:00:36] or a murderer. Uh-huh.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; You might be here as an impure husband,
[2:00:47] an impure wife.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; You might be the vilest of sinners.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; And you say, "I'm
[2:00:57] a past the stage of redemption."
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; No, you're not.
[2:01:06] or you wouldn't be at church this
[2:01:09] morning. Grace will make a way for you
[2:01:14] in this dark hour if you'll just accept
[2:01:17] it.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Adam had to be willing to accept it. So,
[2:01:22] do you accept it?
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; You understand? It becomes your weapon.
[2:01:33] It's your if it's the the only thing you
[2:01:37] have,
[2:01:40] but it's too simple.
[2:01:44] We try to replace it. And I believe in
[2:01:47] anointing, don't get me wrong. You know
[2:01:50] what anointing is? When you're anointed
[2:01:53] to do something,
[2:01:56] that means you're called
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; to do it.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The anointing means that God is
[2:02:02] going to provide to you the tools to
[2:02:06] carry out the task that he assigns you.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; That's what it means to be anointed. It
[2:02:13] doesn't mean it's a feeling.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; But it means God equipped you to do the
[2:02:21] job.
[2:02:23] If I'm anointed to be a pastor,
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; then God will equip me with the tools to
[2:02:30] do the job.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be the elegant speaker.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; I don't have to come up with great
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; things. That's not what if the
[2:02:40] anointing's there.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; In other words, I've been anointed or
[2:02:45] called for the task.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; He will provide the sermons. He'll
[2:02:50] provide the the the way THAT HAS SPOKEN.
[2:02:54] HE'LL PROVIDE THE NATURE. HE'LL PROVIDE
[2:02:56] THE WISDOM BY HIS GRACE
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; AND BY HIS MERCY
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; TO CARRY OUT THE TASK.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; And if he started a work in you, he'll
[2:03:10] finish it by his grace
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; and by his mercy.
[2:03:21] You could go through the Bible. You
[2:03:24] could talk about the maniac. You could
[2:03:26] go all through the scripture. The lady
[2:03:29] coming down the throat with her dead
[2:03:32] son.
[2:03:34] The whole ministry of Jesus
[2:03:40] is the revelation
[2:03:42] of grace
[2:03:45] and mercy.
[2:03:47] that we've passed from grace to mercy.
[2:03:52] And now by this grace and mercy, we are
[2:03:57] going to enter into a third exodus
[2:04:03] where we break the chain
[2:04:10] that Satan has on our flesh.
[2:04:16] And we break that chain
[2:04:18] by his grace
[2:04:21] and his mercy.
[2:04:25] It's our greatest weapon
[2:04:30] in the battle in your mind.
[2:04:32] When your mind starts to fail you and
[2:04:36] the ability of your flesh
[2:04:39] starts to fail you, remember
[2:04:44] my strength
[2:04:46] is made perfect
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; and weakness by grace.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; My grace Paul
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; is sufficient for you. My intervention
[2:05:00] in your life to change the outcome of
[2:05:04] things
[2:05:06] is what you have to rely on.
[2:05:12] Things may be messed up where you are
[2:05:14] right now.
[2:05:17] You don't like how you've been treated.
[2:05:22] Maybe you're misunderstood.
[2:05:26] It doesn't matter what burden
[2:05:30] this kingdom
[2:05:33] of the world has put on you.
[2:05:37] You're not of this world.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; This is not our home.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; This is not our kingdom. Amen.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; And the only chance we have of making it
[2:05:56] out of here is by the mercy
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; and grace of God.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; The woman that washed Jesus' feet was
[2:06:07] stuck
[2:06:09] in the life she was in.
[2:06:13] And she ran
[2:06:16] to the throne of mercy.
[2:06:22] and started to wash his feet.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; And he looked at all of them around him
[2:06:29] and said, you know, all your
[2:06:30] righteousness,
[2:06:33] but she has not quit crying and weeping
[2:06:37] and washing my feet with her tears and
[2:06:41] wiping it with her hair.
[2:06:46] She whose sins are many
[2:06:49] are forgiven.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; You're forgiven.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; What brought her from that condition
[2:07:02] to life eternal?
[2:07:06] Grace
[2:07:07] and mercy. It was her greatest weapon.
[2:07:11] It's our greatest weapon.
[2:07:16] Trust it. Accept it.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Ask for it.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; It's here for you this morning.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; If you're I don't care what vile shape
[2:07:30] you're in.
[2:07:32] You can look back and all you're seeing
[2:07:35] is all the places he trapped you. Our
[2:07:39] prophet of God said, "You were tricked
[2:07:40] into it. You were trapped into it by
[2:07:43] your first nature. Paul said, "We were
[2:07:45] all did this. We all walk like this."
[2:07:49] But if you want to be saved this
[2:07:51] morning,
[2:07:55] you want to be delivered
[2:07:58] this morning.
[2:08:01] It won't be my by my prayer.
[2:08:05] It won't be by a great sound of music by
[2:08:10] our talented instruments.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; It won't be by the sweet anointing that
[2:08:16] comes.
[2:08:18] And I love the anointing. I love songs.
[2:08:20] The choir, the little quartet that sang
[2:08:22] that harmony that bless my soul. The
[2:08:25] songs that were sung about mercy, it
[2:08:28] thrilled me.
[2:08:31] They just told me
[2:08:34] of the grace and the mercy.
[2:08:39] But I've got to go
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; and take that mercy
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; as my weapon and say, "Satan, by the
[2:08:48] mercy of God,
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; you are defeated.
[2:08:54] Satan, by God's grace,
[2:08:58] your chain is broken.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy
[2:09:05] through faith.
[2:09:08] Faith
[2:09:10] in his mercy.
[2:09:14] Faith
[2:09:16] in his grace.
[2:09:18] Do you have the faith to believe that he
[2:09:20] could be merciful to you?
[2:09:23] With all our adultery and all of our
[2:09:26] anger and all of our cursing, can we
[2:09:30] have faith
[2:09:31] that he's merciful?
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Can we have faith that his grace
[2:09:39] will intervene?
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Not of yourselves,
[2:09:46] but by grace.
[2:09:50] It's our weapon.
[2:09:52] And I wanted to leave that with you this
[2:09:55] morning.
[2:09:57] Don't ever think of ourselves above that
[2:10:01] which we really are.
[2:10:03] But just remember
[2:10:06] everything we have is by his grace.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; It's by his mercy.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; It's by his eternal love.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; And it's by his promise.
[2:10:19] I promise you I'll not leave you nor
[2:10:23] forsake you.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; I promise you if I started a work in
[2:10:28] you, I'll finish it.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; I promise you nothing can pluck you out
[2:10:36] of the palm
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; of my hand. Yes.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; I promise you,
[2:10:43] no matter what you've done,
[2:10:46] if you're faithful and just to confess
[2:10:48] it, I'll be faithful and just to forgive
[2:10:53] you.
[2:10:55] Rely on his mercy.
[2:10:58] Rely on his grace. Rididge your hearts
[2:11:01] of bitterness.
[2:11:04] Father,
[2:11:06] forgive my trespasses
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; as I forgive those who trespass against
[2:11:12] me.
[2:11:14] I have a lot of people who have hurt me
[2:11:17] over the years,
[2:11:20] done things to me that have broken my
[2:11:23] heart,
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; that have
[2:11:30] hurt me so bad that
[2:11:33] I never wanted to enter behind a pulpit
[2:11:37] again in my life,
[2:11:41] but by grace.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:44] and mercy.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; It's all we've got.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; But yet, it's the greatest weapon
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; in our arsenal,
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; the word of God, grace and mercy,
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; the attributes of God. We've never
[2:12:07] reached the mark. We haven't reached our
[2:12:10] full potential, but it's the grace of
[2:12:13] God that keeps us going.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Let's rely on it. Let's accept it. Let's
[2:12:21] realize that
[2:12:23] everything that we are this morning is
[2:12:26] by his grace.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; If some hardship has come your way,
[2:12:33] his grace delivers you
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; out of all trouble. If unfairness has
[2:12:39] come your way, his grace
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; heals all the wounds.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; And I can't look at all the things
[2:12:51] that I feel
[2:12:53] that were done wrong. I can only look at
[2:12:56] the one thing that was really done
[2:13:00] right. And that was his death on the
[2:13:02] cross
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; for me.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; And I don't deserve anything. I don't
[2:13:07] think any of us deserve anything but God
[2:13:11] rich in mercy
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; for the love that he has for us by grace
[2:13:19] we're saved. Let us stand.
[2:13:30] Maybe if the musicians would come.
[2:13:42] If we could bow our heads as they
[2:13:46] play something
[2:13:51] soft this morning.
[2:14:19] Maybe we could ask ourselves this
[2:14:21] morning. Maybe you could ask yourself
[2:14:23] this morning.
[2:14:32] Do you need the mercy
[2:14:36] of the Lord this morning in your life?
[2:14:41] Do you need his grace?
[2:14:49] Maybe you've never given
[2:14:52] your heart to him.
[2:15:00] because you've always let your past
[2:15:05] and your knowledge of your sins
[2:15:09] and the kind of person that you really
[2:15:12] are hold you back.
[2:15:16] But I want to tell you this morning,
[2:15:22] his mercy overcomes that
[2:15:29] and his grace,
[2:15:35] changes us.
[2:15:40] Maybe you've never experienced it,
[2:15:44] but you'd like to lift your hand this
[2:15:46] morning. You don't have to come to the
[2:15:48] altar.
[2:15:50] If you'd like to come to the altar and
[2:15:52] be prayed for, we'd be happy to pray for
[2:15:54] you. We were all once sinners
[2:15:58] who walked under the power and the
[2:16:01] influence of the prince of the air.
[2:16:05] the spirit that now workketh in the
[2:16:08] children of disobedience.
[2:16:10] If this morning you say, "I don't want
[2:16:12] that spirit to work in me anymore.
[2:16:17] I don't want to be a part of that
[2:16:18] kingdom, but I want to be a part of the
[2:16:21] kingdom of God."
[2:16:24] And you'd like to slip your hand up,
[2:16:29] say, "Lord, I I need this mercy.
[2:16:35] I just put it way up where he could see
[2:16:37] it.
[2:16:39] Up to like you mean it. Lord, I got
[2:16:41] things in my life I I need your mercy
[2:16:45] and grace
[2:16:47] and I'm having faith in that mercy
[2:16:51] and that grace.
[2:16:54] It's my weapon, Father, to break every
[2:16:57] chain.
[2:17:02] Father, you know the hearts.
[2:17:06] You see the hands, Father,
[2:17:09] that are raised.
[2:17:11] But most of all, above the hand, Lord,
[2:17:13] you look into the heart.
[2:17:21] Father, for those who have never been
[2:17:23] baptized, we have a formula in the
[2:17:25] Bible.
[2:17:28] When they asked him, they said, "Men and
[2:17:30] brethren, m what must we do?"
[2:17:34] The scripture says, "Peter, filled with
[2:17:36] the Holy Ghost
[2:17:39] said,"Repent
[2:17:42] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:17:45] Jesus Christ,
[2:17:49] and you shall receive the gift
[2:17:53] of the Holy Spirit.
[2:17:57] You shall receive this continuous
[2:18:02] ongoing
[2:18:04] neverending mercy
[2:18:07] and grace of God
[2:18:11] being with you even in you all the days
[2:18:13] of your life.
[2:18:17] He said if we're faithful and just to
[2:18:20] confess our sins, he's faithful and just
[2:18:22] to forgive them.
[2:18:25] And if you've never been baptized and
[2:18:27] you'd like to be baptized, the pool is
[2:18:31] ready.
[2:18:33] There's men of God all throughout the
[2:18:35] building who can baptize you.
[2:18:40] Find a deacon, find a minister, find
[2:18:43] somebody
[2:18:45] and let them know that you want to be
[2:18:46] baptized and
[2:18:49] you want the mercy of grace of God to
[2:18:53] be in your life. And
[2:18:57] you know that that mercy is your only
[2:18:59] escape.
[2:19:08] If you've got
[2:19:13] some addiction,
[2:19:18] remember,
[2:19:21] not by strength,
[2:19:23] not by might, but by my spirit, saith
[2:19:28] the Lord.
[2:19:30] By my mercy and my grace,
[2:19:33] I forgive you and I'll transform you.
[2:19:39] Lord, I believe that I
[2:19:42] ask you to help me
[2:19:44] personally this morning. Father,
[2:19:48] overcome my many complexes,
[2:19:53] my many fears,
[2:20:02] my many thoughts. Father,
[2:20:07] I rely on your mercy to make a
[2:20:09] difference in my life this morning.
[2:20:12] Father, I ask you bless each person,
[2:20:15] each hand that went up.
[2:20:19] Father, now we commit them into your
[2:20:22] hands that you will lead them and guide
[2:20:26] them in the steps that they would take.
[2:20:30] And I pray, Father, that they understand
[2:20:34] it's your mercy
[2:20:36] and your grace
[2:20:40] that is their path.
[2:20:42] to freedom.
[2:20:44] I ask these things this morning in the
[2:20:47] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:20:51] we pray. Amen. God bless you. I'm going
[2:20:54] to ask brother Billy to come and lead us
[2:20:55] in some worship.
[2:20:57] If you need prayer, you want to be
[2:20:59] baptized, we're here for you. God richly
[2:21:02] bless you.
[2:21:13] Praise
[2:21:16] God.
[2:21:19] Praise
[2:21:22] grace that
[2:21:24] will pardon
[2:21:27] and cleanse
[2:21:30] with him.
[2:21:33] Oh great,
[2:21:37] great
[2:21:39] God.
[2:21:45] Grace
[2:21:48] is greater
[2:21:50] than all
[2:21:54] I've seen.
[2:21:56] Oh my
[2:21:59] goodness. Grace of the loving.
[2:22:07] Oh grace that
[2:22:11] exceeds
[2:22:13] our seed.

[2:22:42] all the way.
[2:22:48] Oh God,
[2:22:54] oh grace God.
[2:23:17] Grace
[2:23:20] is greater
[2:23:22] than all.
[2:23:25] I sing.
[2:23:27] Oh, and see
[2:23:30] and spread
[2:23:42] the soul.
[2:23:50] Oh yes, grace.
[2:23:55] his grace
[2:23:58] of joy.
[2:24:01] Hope
[2:24:03] to
[2:24:05] reuge
[2:24:07] the mighty
[2:24:10] God
[2:24:12] for the great
[2:24:19] God.

[2:24:35] all the praise.
[2:24:41] God

[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Where would I be?
[2:25:04] You are it all
[2:25:08] and I'm glad you see
[2:25:12] through Christ.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Just think about it this morning.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:25:28] where would I be?
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Where would I be?
[2:25:34] You know, you know,
[2:25:50] our testimony this morning.
[2:25:54] Hallelujah. Holy God.
[2:25:58] Oh, amazing grace. Amazing.
[2:26:04] I see the sound.
[2:26:21] Oh, what an empty.
[2:26:27] Oh, amazing.

[2:26:53] way.

[2:27:18] king.

[2:27:28] Hallelujah.
[2:27:31] Amen. Amen. But brother Tim W, if you
[2:27:33] could just come and sing that song again
[2:27:35] that you sang this morning. Amen.
[2:27:46] Amen. What a grace that would make a way
[2:27:51] that we may be called sons and daughters
[2:27:52] of God this morning. Amen.
[2:28:08] For years I traveled
[2:28:12] down a road of wrong.
[2:28:17] My heart had lost its joy
[2:28:22] and I
[2:28:24] I lost my song.
[2:28:28] But your grace,
[2:28:31] it came and placed me
[2:28:35] right where I
[2:28:38] belong.
[2:28:40] And your mercy,

[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Grace and mercy this morning.
[2:32:48] Hallelujah.
[2:32:50] Hallelujah.
[2:32:54] What am I telling if you could just come
[2:32:56] and dismiss us this morning? That's the
[2:32:59] song of our heart. And
[2:33:01] every day, every footstep we take is
[2:33:05] grace and mercy.
[2:33:07] Amen.
[2:33:19] It's by our heads, hearts.
[2:33:25] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just
[2:33:29] approach that throne of mercy and grace.
[2:33:34] Lord, I got to thinking about
[2:33:41] if we had a testimony service here right
[2:33:44] now in this building
[2:33:48] about the grace and mercy in each one of
[2:33:50] our lives. Lord, we'd
[2:33:54] be here for months,
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; months, Lord.
[2:34:01] Lord, and your word says that it's new
[2:34:03] every day,
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; Lord. That inexhaustible mercy and
[2:34:12] grace. We are so thankful, Lord, that
[2:34:14] you reminded us today, Lord, that
[2:34:18] it truly is our greatest weapon.
[2:34:22] As the enemy comes in, Lord, may we
[2:34:27] stand and fight.
[2:34:33] It's by your grace, Lord, that we can
[2:34:36] stand. It's by your grace that we can
[2:34:37] fight. It's by your grace
[2:34:40] that we're here today.
[2:34:44] Lord, we just want to thank you and
[2:34:46] praise you, Lord, for the word that
[2:34:47] we've heard.
[2:34:51] Lord, if there be one that
[2:34:54] hasn't experienced
[2:34:56] this mercy and grace,
[2:35:00] may they know just now
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; that it's there for them.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:35:13] I pray that you'd move on their heart to
[2:35:15] talk to somebody after this service,
[2:35:17] Lord, cuz
[2:35:20] there's so much mercy and grace,
[2:35:31] Lord. Thank you.
[2:35:34] Just pray that you'd be with us as we
[2:35:35] leave.
[2:35:38] Pray that you'd restore our pastor for
[2:35:40] pouring out from his heart, Lord God,
[2:35:43] what you've put in it
[2:35:46] till we meet again. Jesus Christ's name
[2:35:49] we pray. Amen.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; Hey, V.
[2:35:58] Amen. God bless. You are dismissed. Oh,
[2:36:00] thank you for the cross,
[2:36:05] Lord.
[2:36:08] and thank you for what
[2:36:13] you
[2:36:16] Oh, bear in all my sin and shame. Lord,
[2:36:21] and in love you came
[2:36:26] and gave amazing
[2:36:29] grace.
[2:36:31] Oh, and thank you for the smile,
[2:36:36] Lord.
[2:36:39] Oh, thank you for the name
[2:36:43] of his name.
[2:36:47] Wash me in your cleansing flow.
[2:36:52] Now all I know is your forgiveness
[2:36:59] can bring
[2:37:04] all worthy
[2:37:07] to
