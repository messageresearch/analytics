you're undefeatable and you're in us thank you lord jesus we just commit this little time of fellowship lord we're so grateful that you spoke through our pastor this morning lord and we're endeavoring for a double portion lord we pray you'd help us tonight lord be glorified lord feel welcome oh god in in the in this the little places where your believers are held up at home in the different places that they're at lord we just committed all to you praying o god that you would speak to our hearts in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen praise the lord we certainly appreciate his wonderful grace amen hallelujah he's listening to our pastor preach this morning and just something in the heart of the believer that says i've been ordained for this time for such a place and a time as this to stand in the face of opposition and declare truth amen amen i just i won't be long i just trust that the lord will be our portion and help us to deliver a little burden that we have on our heart and and if you turn with me into your uh bibles we're going to read a little scripture in hebrews chapter 2 and something that's just on my heart you know god's given us his best amen and when he's given us his best would never want to put it as second fiddle in our lives we never want to put it in the back seat of our lives but we want to keep it right in front and center because it's everything to us amen it's it's so precious it's so valuable god's word is himself in us amen and so we're just we just want to hold the torch light to a lost and dying world knowing that he's called us to this stand amen amen hebrews chapter 2 and verse 1 it says therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time they sh we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedient received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so greater salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and diverse miracles in the gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is a man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visiteth him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crowned him with the glory and honor and did set him over the works of thy hand thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he had put all things subject under him he left nothing that is not under him but now we see not yet all things under him but we see jesus who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man amen you may have your seeds amen such a wonderful scripture it empowers the believer you know i was talking with the brother this week and he called me and uh you know there's something in my mind that said you know do you want the good news or the bad news and that's kind of the devil's approach to to us as believers he said well you i'm going to give you some bad news but praise be to god this is the good news amen we're not a defeated people amen god died the death so that you and i don't have to fear death amen and when we look and to see that he was made a little lower than angels and he suffered in the flesh amen the scripture says that in verse 10 for it will become him for whom all things and by him all things are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of our salvation perfect through suffering amen god has left a little measure of suffering for each one of us amen he said that character is the only thing we're going to take with us amen and so it's it's god's choosing to allow us to go through some struggles some sufferings because it's without those struggles and it's without that suffering that we cannot have character amen we must have character and character stays with the word amen amen i was thinking about um you know the prophet of god teaching a a subject out of uh then jesus came and called and i was so moved by it i thought if the lord permit me i just share a little bit out of that message and just thinking about how there's there's never such a time in as as believers to to not to not point others to the cross of calvary we must be pointing souls to calvary because you know if i would say it like this um you know any time the enemy tries to present well you know we're gonna have to have a layoff you know and and you're on the list well that might seem like that scenario the the good news bad news scenario and that's just the way the enemy tries to always approach us to get us to have the wrong attitude towards the word of god amen and so we want to definitely be on guard for his attacks and and we want to be on guard for his tricks knowing that his he's always trying to give us these kind of scenarios and and so i got to thinking about it and i said you know really as a believer we got good news amen he said he'd work it all together for good so when the enemy comes in and he starts saying well we got this report and it's an incurable disease well i say well you might be presenting it in the form of a bad news but i got news for you buddy i got isaiah 53 amen by his stripes i am healed hallelujah so whatever he comes bringing in the battle of the mind it's good news amen i always want to find my voice speaking the word amen so if that's a little thought that we just want to kind of share with you is is finding our voice you we're living in a dark time and in a dark hour where there's gross darkness on the people and people they're picking up all kinds of causes and they're expressing a lot of things and yet we have free moral agency every man has the right to his opinion amen but there's a predestinated people and elect people that will say thus saith the lord amen and it's the same voice and so we want to find our voice speaking the same thing he spoke amen amen so this uh message brother branham talked about and and we'll just turn into scripture gives kind of a little bit of a backdrop in john chapter 11. in john chapter 11 speaking about mary and martha when lazarus you know jesus was told by the father to go take a journey to to get out of the house and to go on and martha was there and you know it's it's um it's like it is today for us as believers their situations and circumstance that you prayed for and you're believing for and you know it just seems dark you know and we've been taught that just because there's rain clouds on the outside and it's storming and there's difficulty in life doesn't mean that god's against you amen and just because things are going well and there's plenty of money in the bank and there's no uh problems with health doesn't mean god's for you amen but when god can speak and amen we can receive the word of god in our heart and say amen that's the way it is in my life amen let it be amen then we can know where we're standing is a sure foundation amen so mark that came to that place in john chapter 11 says this in verse 1 now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and his sister martha and it was that mary would anoint the lord with ointment and wipe her feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore her sisters went to him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick amen when jesus heard this he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby thereby now jesus loved martha and her sister in lazarus and he had heard therefore that he was sick and about two days still in the same place where he was and after that saith he his disciples let us go into judea again amen and i'll pick up in this um then jesus came and called this is preached in 1964 um april 17th and [Music] paragraph 50. he says now death struck the little home they had sent for him what a broke up home that was the man that they had confidence in the man that they had loved the man that they had seen heal the sick the man and made the blind to see in prophecy to know the thoughts of the heart and to tell the people what happened every time he fit the scripture to the dot exactly so much till they the most loyalist friends and he let that happen see he let that happen just to see what they would do amen you think about this story and you think about your life and you think about the things that you have on your heart the faith in god's word and yet there's times like this with mary god would allow something to transpire and it's an opportunity to keep the right spirit the right attitude towards god's word amen and no doubt that was what was in the father's mind about it all hopes was gone the man they trusted in and they was turned out and he wasn't what they thought he was and and they were so desperate lazarus their brother was dead amen and you know martha mary and lazarus they had they had turned their back to the denominations they turned their back to the world they were completely sold out amen it sounds familiar in my house amen there's times where i ain't got no other options amen and god he's just saying no doubt that that was what the father had in mind to just leave them stand there as if he wasn't gonna answer amen but the scripture says there in verse 4 he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby amen there is a representation of heaven here on earth today amen and we're just thinking about how that god would allow even in the darkest hour in the darkest time when no hope it appeared was around and yet then his presence comes and brings new hope amen how many can testify that they've experienced his presence and it brought new hope amen i think that's what the call is in this day as i've heard the testimony that the figurehead the popes made and said that he believed that jesus failed when he died but what he failed to realize is that he rose from the dead amen and what he died for was to redeem me and you amen to deliver us from the bondage of sin amen that's the good news amen there is a promise of a resurrection and to think that he's also he's he's told his audience he said now you just don't go out there and try to convert nobody don't go out there and tell them what you believe don't try to win souls to jesus christ don't try to convert nobody we'll do all that you see that spirit at work those two spirits balaamism and nicolaitanism still at work amen but there's a people that is taking up the voice of the word the resurrection is now inhabiting a multi-member predestinated bride hallelujah not just gonna sit still at the commandment of the pope or a king or anybody other than king jesus amen thinking about this statement it just was so profound to me that oh my just got me to jumping i just thought about it and and we know it's true and martha in verse 78 now martha knowing speaking about the elijah and the shooter might woman you know she came to a dark hour but you know there's something that a believer does when you come to christ is you you you make your vow you say you know i believe that jesus died for me and all of what i represented all that i was now i'm i'm laying it at the altar and i'm trusting that the life of christ now can rise up in me and i can satisfy his word i can do his will amen and there's a vow that's made you say lord if you take the burden of sin if you take the bondage of sin from me and you make me a new creature in christ i'll serve you with all of my heart amen i'll give you my all i won't make no excuses or arguments to serve your word amen and to think about that the shooter might woman she wanted to do something for the lord amen there's something that that resonates in a believer's heart that says i want to do something for the lord amen no matter how dark it is no matter how chaotic it is no matter who's running for the president no matter what causes my neighbors taking up and what banners they fly amen but there's a love in my heart that says i want to serve the gospel amen i don't want it just to be the preacher or the pastor the deacons or the trustees or the song leaders or the musicians oh god what would you have me to do if it's just to whistle i certainly appreciate the the the prophet and brother david pointing that out last weekend i just thought oh my that that fits me if i could just if nothing else i'll just whistle him or something for the glory of god amen you got a part to play glory this shooter might woman see martha she was a student and brother branham's pointing out that she was knowing that shudomite woman had faith in the prophet amen and that was being god's representative on earth and that was elijah and god was representing that was his representation in his day amen and she was knowing and seeing enough that jesus was the representative of that day hallelujah amen and so you think about what mary was going through and the call came to to martha that that jesus had been calling and came and called amen and i just feel like in my heart i say lord i know you've been calling a bride out of denominationalism out of selfishness out of lawlessness to come into the the the seven course meal amen and now she is sitting long enough under the word being dressed by the word and now she's representing heaven amen this is where the the deliverance is this is where satisfaction is amen it's in the representation of heaven in the form of the bride of jesus christ amen amen so wonderful to think that god chose you and predestinated you to be the lighthouse to be the very representation where those who are lost those who don't even realize that time is winding down and all they can see is whether or not they'll have the schools open back up or or whether or not they'll get a raise next quarter because of the economy my i believe it's times like this that we can allow god to reset our vision to refocus on what's what's really important amen if if we don't have the hope of the resurrection we of all people are most miserable amen there is a resurrected savior living in a people that has been redeemed that that here from heaven that prophecy that's been spoken that spirit will live again amen thinking about job and thinking about the situation that job came to and no doubt if he knew that the appointment that was made and and how that you know there was a conversation between god and satan and there was going to be a test you know and god allowing the devil to say you know his mockery saying you know job's like your little pet you put a little fence around him and you know you pet him you don't and and he said knob you can't get him to curse him and yet they they the trials come and yet when the trials come upon us we know god's requirement he said if we confess our faults one to another god is faithful to cleanse us of every sin amen that that atonement it cleanses from all sin amen and to think about job and he made his he made his stand and yet when he lost everything he lost his health he lost his wealth you know he lost his family and in that trying moment it was in that dark hour and even even that the voice that the devil the enemy tried to say that he would get job to curse you know there was that voice of his companion and yet standing with the word he said thou speak is like a foolish woman he wasn't saying she was an unbeliever but you know we're subject to carnal nature so so we want to make sure that we're taking up the right voice amen we want to keep the right attitude towards the circumstances in the world to all that's going on you know it's it's easy to take up the wrong voice when we're feeding on the wrong things amen god help us god help us to stay with the word to stay faithful to feed on the message of the hour and not filter it amen with man's thinking amen thinking about job and you know he just in that dark hour because god he spoke he said i c he will not deny he will not deny me amen and there's something about the prophecy of our day for this bride she is going to stand the test amen take courage saints you've got the goods in you to stand the test amen we just want to feed on the right things and that way we can have the right attitude so dead to our senses amen she had the right response speaking of martha when she was questioned on her test she must have went out there and she knew that god had manifest himself and she watched and watched when she come they followed her and to see what she would say now she went out there and fell down before him first and said lord what was it if thou would have been here my brother would not have died see thy brother would not have died and she he said thy brother will rise and he yes lord he'll rise in the last day at the general resurrection he was a good boy he'll rise in the last days see they believed in the general resurrection jesus said but i am the resurrection in life oh my the life and my after turned her down how could a man that resurrects your life treat her friend like that sometimes he's testing you to see what you'll do put you put the thing before you and to see what you'll do with it he might do it tonight he was he has been doing it so just to see what you'll do about it amen you know that's the same thing with you and me amen god's showing that he likes to see the reaction of his children amen and we just want to maintain the right attitude you think about martha's response amen that's what my heart's desire is lord let me reflect this kind of attitude she said this she said then when we find out that when what was the next thing that was done she said i believe that thou art the son of god which is come into the world amen and that's exactly what he confessed to be amen even now though my brother is dead though he's embalmed though he's buried though he stinketh and in the grave but even now whatever you ask god god will give it to you amen there you are there you are that's the key note she believed in what he asked if he asked god for her god would hear her prayer even now whatever you ask god god will give it to you now could you have that kind of faith tonight in god's word well jesus is his word could you have that much faith in god's word when it's just as directly identified for this day as much as was identified in that day whatever you ask god god will give it to you amen and aren't you thankful that the the the scripture says whatever you ask in my name i'll do it amen and we know that there is a sacred trust imparted to the believer in this hour and we know that when we have need of it the power of the resurrection is available to the believers amen even now no matter how dark it is no matter what the symptoms are amen god is able to deliver the victory into your hands amen doesn't it say in the bible that he sits at the right hand of the majesty not like not like a right hand like a man but it's power right hand means power and authority amen he is he is the god with us god in us god is here right hand ever present right here when you need god you don't have to go to heaven he's right here now amen the right hand of power of his majesty sitting here ready to make intercession upon your confession he's waiting to be called on amen if you have a need tonight find your voice calling upon the lord for whatever you have need of even now lord even if the doctors told me i can't live but a week even now lord whatever you ask god will give it to you amen god is just waiting for us to harmonize with his heartbeat with his word amen whenever the believer in god gets turning together it generates the power of his resurrection amen that little will of faith getting the big will of god moving amen that's what we want in our lives as believers is to let our little faith in the big god bring to pass every word amen i want to have that we want to find our voice the voice of the resurrection amen you know god uses the impossibilities of man to bring about the realities of god don't you love god because he's done so much where we failed where we came to a place where we couldn't see a way around it we couldn't see a way over it but praise god there's a grace in the hour of need to take us through it amen he's gonna crest every wave we have nothing to fear amen amen another little scripture i have i'll be winding down here just want to encourage you you know there's so much in the way of news and you know if we're going to take up a voice let's just not repeat news and let's just not repeat you know what political positions people seem to say is is right and whatever ones we think but lord you know it's just in my heart you know let me find the voice of the word speaking out of my mouth amen because that's really the only thing that will change a heart that's the only thing that can deliver the soul that's in bondage is the word of god amen in first corinthians paul was teaching and it just you know if if there's something that i want on my lips what i want in my mind is to know what the cross of calvary did for me you know when the enemy comes and brings some news that i have no money in the bank i have no home to go to i have no car whatever the news that seems to be bad i have the good news on my lips though my sins were as scarlet amen he's broke the bondage of sin and i am in direct contact i don't need a pope i don't need a dead saint to intercede for me i have a living christ in my heart speaking to me peace in the midst of storms amen in first corinthians 15 it says this in verse 51 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trump shall sound and the dead shall rise incorruptable and we shall be changed for this corruptable shall put on immortality and this mortal shall put on immortality so when this shall have put on incorruptive incorruption and this mortality have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that is written death is swallowed up in victory amen o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god who give us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord foreign so much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord amen we just we're just trusting that we're just pointing to the prophecy that was spoken we're trusting that we can take up these causes upon our lips and we can speak thus saith the lord amen we have a great victory ahead of us and it is a sure word of prophecy amen well lord richly bless you i didn't intend to be very long we just wanted to encourage you in these things and we just trust that no doubt um looking forward to to gathering again in the service where we can all come together and rejoice just want to encourage you in a little time of fellowship maybe we can all stand and we just invite our brother billy to come as we'll have a little word of prayer maybe we can sing some songs and just rejoice in what god's done for us we're not in bondage to sin amen we've been set free we're no longer captivated by the corruption of this world and this flesh amen if you have a need upon your heart we just trust that god will undertake for every need why don't we borrow heads together precious heavenly father lord in
