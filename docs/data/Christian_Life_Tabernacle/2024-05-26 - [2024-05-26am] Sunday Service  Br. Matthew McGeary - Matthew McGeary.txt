Bible let's go ahead and turn to Ephesians chapter 1 and Jacob it's good to see you amen it's good to see each of our visitors and those that have come you brought Mom too hi Mom it's so good to see y'all Jacob's a a childhood friend that's come and and he has a wonderful testimony of what God's done in his life and I'm believing one day he'll he'll be able to stand and share that uh you know we're all sons of God and and God knows how to look out over our lives and keep us amen and we just want to maybe speak a little bit about that in Ephesians uh chapter uh one we're going to be reading uh verse five my isn't it good to good to be in the the presence of the Lord and just to we could be somewhere else today but that's right here we are I say it's the grace of God you might not feel like you got much to be happy about but you should be happy just because of where you are this morning you might have been struggling and battling a lot of things but you're here and if you're here that means something let's just read in our Bibles Ephesians chapter 1 and verse five would read like this having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so whose will was it and whose pleasure was it to do so it was his to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved ain't that wonderful this isn't something that you have done but he made you the accepted not based on your works not based on your merits it's not based on how good you were but it's something that he did in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will now that's a profound thing right there the mystery of his will so God has a has a will but that will is a mystery un until it's revealed to you what his will is according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in all in one in one all things in Christ both which were in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will notice that you've been predestinated and you have obtained an inheritance and there's nothing that can take that away from you you have an inheritance when the devil would try to Rob and he'd try to steal he'd try to Snuff out your life and try to bring you into situations that you thought you could never get out uh be reminded that you have been predestinated and you have an inheritance and there's nothing that the devil can do there's nothing the devil can do to rob you of your inheritance that we should that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory amen you may be seated I I just want to say we are certainly living in such a great hour uh we see the gross Darkness upon the people and you know uh great truth has come through a Vindicated prophet in the day that we are now living but when when man rejects truth the only thing left for them is to believe a lie and the scripture say that they would be damned for it and give it over to a strong delusion and certainly that is what we're seeing today we're seeing the manifestation of a nation in a world that has rejected truth and so the only thing that has been left for them is is reprobate minds they believe a lie and we're certainly starting to see the confusion and the things that have that have come out over the people where where people are just confused they don't even uh know who they are and and they they're starting to now it's unfortunate thing but you're starting to see a sickness and a thing develop in people where where they don't even recognize their gender they don't even recognize really uh uh what they belong to and and there's some people that even are starting to identify with animals and things like that you talk about a strange World we're living in but you know all of these are the symptoms and the repercussions of what happens when truth is presented and you re reject truth then you're going to uh uh believe a lie and you know as I was just thinking along these things and and I I I I start started to um uh think of the um the the the message that brother Brandon would preach spiritual Amnesia and as you think along these things you know there's conditions and illnesses that cause people to forget their identity you might see it and heard of it there's there's Alzheimer's and there's dementia and things and you know it's a sad thing when a loved one or somebody starts to forget who they are or who they're married to and you know you can imagine the the trouble that that one would go through uh having a spouse that they might have spent 30 40 50 years all their life and all of a sudden this person who who knows everything about them it starts to come into a condition where they don't even know their name they don't know who they are and and there's been things out there it's it's a little heartwarming things where you might see somebody who they've been married a long time but they forget and so what they're trying to do is they're trying to remind them they're trying to show a little picture they're trying to show something familiar they're trying to do anything that might for a moment connect that memory back to the relationship that they once had because there's been something that has come and and something that's developed in such a way where they're no longer attached because their memory has failed them so they can be looking at their spouse of 40 50 years who they've had uh four or five kids and grandkids and and all of a sudden through through a sickness through something in the mind they they now are looking at this person and they don't even know what they have but then for a moment every once in a while maybe something a picture or they might show some old wedding photos and then all of a sudden something something will Bridge the leak and there's a spark in their eyes they're like oh you're my husband and I say I I I I I pray that as we would look into the word of God a and we would start to look into the Bible you know we've all been shocked by sin and come into this world and we all have spiritual Amnesia not knowing who we are not knowing where we came from not knowing where we're going but God has sent a message to to to bring a spark that something you might look at like Oh Oh you mean that's where I was before the foundation of the world I was in him you mean you mean I don't belong to the things of this world in the way that I've been living and all these things uh that I've Gotten Trapped up in and all these things that I'm battling you mean that's not my identity no your identity is in the word your identity is in the scripture your identity is in Christ as our text would say having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so there is an identity or characteristics if I could say as the scripture uh would have said to to to uh Jesus would tell his disciples as the father sent me so I send you so if we're coming into a place as adopted Sons and Daughters of God there's going to be characteristics and things in our lives that are explain that we are like him we are a son we are a daughter of God and as the F he said as the father sent me so I sent you what was Christ he was the anointed one right he was the Messiah so what he's saying look if go if I was the anointed one the same way the father sent me I am going to send you that means you're going to be anointed the prophet of God said the bride is the anointed one for this day now that should be your IDE identity something you're wanting to press into and understand that there's a characteristic that the word of God is telling you that you are now the anointed one you are going to be the vessel you are going to be the body of the Lord the holy spirit is going to in Tabernacle your life and now you are going to do the Greater Works you're going to lay hands on the sick they're going to re uh recover you are going to be an overcomer you're going to overcome just like he overcame how did he overcome it is written it is written Satan get behind me man shall not live by bread alone oh aren't you thankful for it man shall not live by bread alone you know Satan's tried to develop a an economy where you're so dependent on everything that he has to offer you're depending on an education you're depending on a paycheck you're depending on everything this economy can offer you and so what do you try to do you try to you try to chase after the values that the the economy has developed because oh my the the economy they value in education so I better give all my time and all my attention to getting an education because I I I I need to make it in this economy I need a nice house I need a nice car you know I really need to be somebody and to be somebody you got to have a nice house and a nice car right you you you got to be able to drive around town and let people know I'm successful and if we're not careful we're letting I love what brother Paul was preaching on about your value if we're not careful we start to let our economy and the society around us tell us what's valuable tell us what we're worth you're you're worth $9 an hour I'm worth $9 an hour that's my value and some people they they their whole self-esteem their whole countenance and everything through lives on what the the recognition that this world and this economy can offer that's why social media nowadays is such an illness that people are always being sprayed with all of these ideas and all these pictures of and all these lavish things and so everybody wants to make a hamburger when they're out to eat and and do all the photoshopping and like look at the Burger I ate best burger in the world yeah well you know ain't going to be much of a Burger in a little bit we put value on something that's turning into waste I got news for you this whole world is going to burn that might be shocking but we are putting all of our time all of our effort all of our value and trying to get worldly Goods that I want you to know all this is going to burn I'm afraid some of us have gotten too caught up in what the economy can offer you know I I was thinking about this I was looking over some things and I got to thinking about you know some of my brothers and sisters I I'll just leave this in the vag and you know I'm talking about but boy they they really know how to pray they really know how to enter in they really know how to to to to just just to break through into the presence of God and you see some of them Believers get together and my they start to pray and they'll bring down an atmosphere of prayer if you were to walk in and felt like you were all beat up you walked into that church and everybody praying in the presence of God in there you just fall right down on your knees you get to pray and I've seen kids four five six eight years old in the spirit of prayer everybody crying out to God and the spirit moving through there and you know in that Nation guess what their average salary is a year $449 you know what they're not putting their value on their economy but when they heard a message that you're a predestinated Son of God come out of the darkness come out of the Gloom that's all around look they didn't have to to weigh through all of the Comforts of Lady Osa they didn't have to weigh through uh making a six figures a year and fancy cars and all this things that's a lot of our struggle is lady oia because all these things that bombard us but you let a simple humble believer with with a fat roof and a dirt floor over their head and a predestinated seat of God hear the message of the hour they ain't worried about no economy they're rejoicing they got a smile on their face I'm a Child of God I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm an heir of all things why are they happy because they know who they are they're not depending on the Congo they're not depending on the United States they're not depending on an annual salary they're not depending on how nice their car is or how nice their houses they're depending on one thing man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God if he said I'm a Son of God I'm a Son of God if he said I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer if he said I'll put hell under my feet I'm going to put hell under my feet I'm not looking at my ability I'm looking at what he said Hallelujah I am a predestinated son of almighty God that's my inheritance it belongs to me no devil in hell can take it away but we got a big battle going on up in here in our mind can you get me some water please we got a big battle going on in our mind who am I what's my identity what what am I even doing here a lot of times just look at your life look at the things you're chasing look at your desires look at how you let off the pressure it'll tell you tell you what you think we were fellowshipping a little long how the prophet of God said that that that Jesus didn't complete everything in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and thank you too that means we can go a little longer so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time you got work to do and it ain't N9 to5 it ain't flipping burgers at McDonald's don't knock it I worked there you know they actually pay pretty good good place to work but you're called to be a child of God on the job site that's right what is your occupation your occupation isn't your identity who are you well I'm a I'm a stone Mason what are you I'm an arbest what do you do for living I well you know what I do for a living I give praise to the almighty God what do I do do for a living I honor the word of God what do I do for you know I apply the token what do I do for living I don't live by bread alone but I live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's what you do for a living we need to start living for the message we need to start living for the word we need to start living for him and stop living for this economy and the society around us for that what they esteem valuable now we we know that eternal life is living for others but how can you live for others when you ain't living for him how can you live for others when he's not living in you yeah you might be able to Pat yourself on the back while I went to the soup kitchen and I went to the shelter and I did all this and that but what about your private life sir what about the things you're feeding on what what are you using to let off the pressure and let off the steam what are the vices what are the demons that you're struggling with what are the things that you're facing God has a promise for you and an inheritance that if the spiritual Amnesia can just break for a moment oh and you can start to recognize who you really are that you're a Son of God you can be born again and the same life that was in Jesus Christ can come back upon you and you can be changed become a new creature in Jesus Christ old things pass away as the scripture would say but as many as received him to them he gave power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name power to believe all the potential is there you know everything is in there right now you're not waiting for something outside to come but everything for you to be an overcomer everything for you to be that Son of God that predestinated seed is already in you now you mean when I was out in the drug houses there was a predestinated seat there you mean when I was laid out on the bed and all these things happened the predestinated seed was laying there you mean when I when I ran from God and I ran as hard as I can go there was a predestinated seat of God on the inside of you and no matter how much the devil would try to Snuff your life out there was nothing he could do because the Holy Spirit was brooding over your life he was watching out over you he was protecting you he was keeping you because there was something in there that didn't come from the Earthly it didn't come from the natural it didn't come from your M or your daddy but it came from the very Mind Of God that you were in him before he even founded the world oh that sounds pretty valuable and all of the potentials for you to be what God called you to be is already there but there has to come something I say where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy there has to come something to break the spiritual Amnesia you think you're an alcoholic you you think you're you're you're addicted to pornography you you you think all these things you say well I don't think I know because I can't I can't break myself from it I understand that you have vices and there's things that that are controlling your life but that's not who you are that is not your identity that's something the flesh has taken to but there's a predestinated seat of God on the inside of you and there's the only thing it wants is the word just give me the word just give me the word just give me the word and it's the unadulterated word of the hour when it strikes that predestinated seed watch out watch out devil preacher what are you talk I know what I'm talking about I once was blind Hallelujah I once was blind what do you mean you you've had good eyesight your whole life oh no no there was a time in my life the only thing I could see was the circumstances around me the only thing I could do was grab for a bottle and smoke some of this or that the only thing I can do you brother Matthew growing up in the message yeah cuz I was blind but all all that time I was blind I was packing around a predestinated seed and I finally got to a place I said God I need your help oh that's all he was waiting for because there's a b a scripture that says if you call on the name of the Lord you shall be saved if there's somebody here that needs saving this morning why don't you go go to calling on the name of the Lord like B blind baras oh Master oh Messiah Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me I give somebody an opportunity you need to be saved you need something from God why don't you start crying out oh it might be all right to get out of order why is he here is he passing by your way I think he's coming right down the aisle right now is there somebody that just want to say thou son of David Lord Jesus have mercy on me start identifying you know what's amazing about blind bmus he was identifying with his condition he had the little beggar clothes on he had a staff and then he called on the master prophet of God would pick that up and you say you know it wasn't very far from where Joshua with that great faith spoke and stopped the Su n here stands a mighty general of the army Joshua Jehovah savior in battle says son stay still and all of creation had to obey why why why cuz it was a son walking in the line of duty oh yeah brother Matthew that's Joshua though he was he was Joshua the prophet of God was saying there was blind barus on the side of the road and with the same Faith Joshua had Joshua stopped the Su n But Blind bz stopped the S so n of God he turned around what did he do blind Bame you're healed and his eyes come open you think he stayed down there that any longer you think he kept his beggar garments on you think he kept his little staff you think he kept his little little beggar cup out I think that's the problem with some Believers we still got our beggar clothes on we still got our little arms cup I'm just a believer I just just help me out a little bit another tragedy another thing happened please bless me please help me but oh when blind b m Skies come open Hallelujah I once was blind but now I say it's time to throw off the the beggar garments it's time to throw down the arm because it's time to start testifying I know a God that's real I once was blind but now I see hallelujah oh thank God for opening my eyes it won't hurt you to get excited do you know what it's like do somebody know what it's like I mean if you do help the person here that doesn't maybe they'll get excited too if you get excited hallah be

sources we have to go to outside marriage counseling we have to go to AA sure that can help somebody but it only makes you cope you're not called to cope you ain't called to cope people say well you're just battling demons and you just battling the rest of your life not the God I serve you're battling a demon I say bring it here I have a Divine Commission of almighty God go into all the world and preach the gospel lay hands on their sick they shall recover and in my name and in my name I'll cast that demon Spirit out not because it's the man it's the word in the man it's the god in the man it's the god in the church it's the god in the bride not something a man can do but a predestinated seed of God being germinated oh the face of God starts to shine upon your life when the face of God starts to shine upon your life things start to happen changes start to happen things start to Fall Away things you thought you would never be delivered from I remember one time I was traveling I was over at a brother's house he had two dogs out there playing around and the older dog was quite a bit smaller than the younger one well that that little dog you know was his older he just yip yip yip yep and Chase that big old like some type of bull mastiff or something like that I'm like man how does this work he's like well he's older and he's actually I brought the other one home when he was a puppy so this one's always kept him in order and so that dog doesn't realize he's bigger than him so this thing that didn't have the power over this dog but this dog didn't really know who it was or what it was and it was just about the time that he said that that puppy started to realize wait a second I'm bigger than you and just in a Fell Swoop that little puppy picked up that older dog and slammed it on the ground and pinned it and said you know what I'm tired you've been chasing me around long enough you've been yipping at me and yapping at me and telling me I'll never be an overcomer that I'll never make it that I'll never be delivered you're just going to go through the same Cycles over and over and over you're never going to get delivered you'll really never have the Holy Ghost and power and dominion over your vessel you're just going to have fish hooks in your elbow till you die you'll never get total deliverance and that dog one time finally realized you know what I'm sick and tired of you trying to boss me around and tell me I'm not a son of God he picked that other dog and slammed it down and put his foot on his neck I think it's tie time for the bride of Christ to tell that Old Devil you've tried to yip and Yap around here long enough you try to tell me I'm not a son of God you tried to tell me I'm going to be an alcoholic on my life you try to tell me I'm going to be in bondage to pornography you try to tell me I'll never be Overcomer I'm sick and tired devil boom get behind me Satan you're defeated and the name of Jesus Christ whatever you're going through this morning why don't you tell that Old Devil I'm sick and tired I'm sick and tired of you [Applause] devil you have been given Authority by the Holy [Music] Ghost now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts Hallelujah amen what book of Acts are you talking about brother Matthew I'm talking about the one where blind eyes were open where when people lied in the presence of the Holy Ghost they Dro dead we got some fronters we got some fakers we got some people that are trying to be what they're not brother Brandon said I long for the day when sin's called out at the door I say we ought to created such an atmosphere in here when the sinner comes in and say you know what I want some of what they got right I don't know have we lost our identification have we stopped longing for the Supernatural Well brother Matthew you know we're in the intelligence now nothing's manifesting in the supernat in the in the natural realm oh really tell Jesus that when all the Sadducees and Pharisees came away who is this man that can forgive sin you know the scripture says whosoever sends you remit they are remitted and whosoever they retain are retain was he lying or telling the truth the problem is is do we believe it do you believe it he said it they all they all scoffed at him and say man who's this guy that that could that says he could forgive sins he goes is it harder to say thy sins are forgiven or take up thy bed and walk Hallelujah huah I say the same Jesus is here this morning thy sins are forgiven you you don't have to lay on the bed of Affliction anymore Rise Up in Jesus Christ name and walk hallelujah thank you Lord but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm and formal and Powerless what's he trying to do defile the church making lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast in the Lake of Fire if I can get to touch more on my monitors he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army do you believe it you are an invincible Army you are an invincible Army do you believe it you've been given power to become all the potential is there it's about time we start talking like it it's about time we start living like it it's about time we start expecting it you know you get what you expect she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her Satan will be powerless before her when when will that happen when when when is that going to happen when now ye are what Hallelujah now you are an invincible Army now another book of Acts is springing forth now I'm not waiting for something to come now the question is it's already been spoken the word has already been spoken now it's becoming material in you the seed's already there waiting for you to say amen amen amen I am the bride I am an invincible Army I can do all things I can do Greater Works amen then if you believe it see that's what you when you get into adoption oh when you get into adoption you are always a son differing no no different from a servant but Lord of all so all of the inheritance is the son but there has to come a dispensation or a change of dispensation where he's no longer just under tutors and Governor but now the tutor the Holy Ghost himself is now in the son his word becomes the same as the father I want to ask you the prophet said we're now living in the dispensation of adoption what are we waiting for what are you waiting for to be adopted God quiet that's good maybe he's waiting on you to realize who you really are and that you can do the great you want to know why you can do the Greater Works why can you do the Greater Works because he said so now if I tell you to come over to my house and I got a big tablesp bread full and I got the grapes and and I got the strawberries and the raspberries and and the almonds and and the honey and and the cheeses and oh you know the the the regano and and all the kinds of and it's all laid out there and it's a big spread and I just tell you hey come on over you can have whatever you want just go ahead and and kick your feet up on the table don't do that come in and make yourself at home come back around brother Ben why are you still sitting on the porch well you you told me to come over and we could have some fellowship I know but I told you to come in and and and and I have all this stuff made for you I I know thank you for having me over no are you not hearing me I said come in yeah I'm here brother Matthew I'm here do you not see the front door that's a lot of the problem a lot of us in our relationship with the Lord what did he say everybody lives in a three-bedroom house everybody wants to stay in the front of the house and but nobody wants to go back and make let them be your lord where he has complete control of your thoughts and your thinking and you become a bride impregnated with the word and now you're bringing forth the word you're bringing forth the children of the word you're bringing forth the fruit of the word not my thinking not my will Lord but thy will this is the the season of adoption you stand right now because the season of adoption brings forth the fullness of time which is the resurrection of the Dead Saints you know that's all waiting on you to recognize who you are to recognize what God has called you to now now don't take that in the negative because God sent a message to chase away the spiritual amnesia yeah the prophet of God said as long as you still love the world no matter how much you confess to be up here you're not up here you're down there he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God hasn't entered in yet but when you raise above that to the Heavenly things then set your affections on things above because ye are risen with Christ and now seated in Heavenly places now before we move a little bit further that's where you belong amen you belong living in Heavenly places flying above all the cares of the world not allowing all these political things and all these agendas and politics and oh my I mean there some people's lives are going to be ruined whoever's elected next I mean there's people I mean they're like man if that happens I'm just going to move out of the United States I I'm I'm GNA sell my house I'm gonna I'm gonna quit my job and I'm gonna I'm I'm just going to I'm just going to yeah that's what I'm going to do yeah none of them did it but but their their whole life oh wouldn't it be nice to be seated in Heavenly places where you're walking with Jehovah and you've entered in behind the veil and the veil has dropped down behind you and you're walking with Jehovah you're walking with him and Jehovah saying hey did you hear what's going out in the world no Lord tell me all about it oh my it might have been recorded 50 60 years ago what you're walking with him Hallelujah you've received a message the voice of God you're walking with him Faith come by hearing and hearing the word of God now just trying to progress somehow in this message I was just listening to spiritual Amnesia a little bit and the prophet of God would start talking about how Nebuchadnezzar you know he he started to lift himself up and he exalted himself and God God let him uh get to a place because he exalted himself that he thought he was an animal he forgot he was a human being and he starts to talk about how Israel I believe it's in in in uh Ezra where it starts to talk about Israel he says you know I found you when you were when you were when you were left alone in a field and you were polluted in your own blood and I came along and I picked you up and I washed you and I clinged you and I clothed you and I put Jewels upon you and I made you the great woman you are today and then the scripture says but you trusted in your own Beauty see she forgot and Nebuchadnezzar forgot it was God who gave them what they had they had come into a place of Amnesia where they got lifted up and he said oh that's exactly what the church world has done he that it's so easy today we forget sometimes what the Christian church is we act like the world that shows that we got spiritual Amnesia because that you don't act like a Christian you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this so we're dealing with spiritual amnesia for a moment there's a condition that comes upon the believer where you forget who you are where you're came from or what even brought you this for could you imagine if this church forgot what got us here we start to forget the grace we start to forget the mercy we start to forget the sacrifice and we start to to to put emphasis on our efforts and who we are and what we've accomplished look we got to are you kidding me everything we have is because the grace of God everything I have is because of the grace I haven't merited one thing it's all been Grace I can't point to anything that I've done I couldn't save myself I couldn't help myself and when I needed help I called on the name of the Lord and he saved me that's why we can have Grace for other people that's why we can have Grace for the Sinners and Grace for any of those out there because it's all Grace oh if it wasn't the love of God where would we be amen then that which was freely given freely give so just in laying a little Foundation here as we begin our message prophet of God would say in spiritual Amnesia don't worry we'll try to not be too long paragraph 37 he says now this Amnesia we're told will cause you to be in a place where you cannot identify yourself now it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the cause is shock it's somebody that don't even know who they are you find it in war sometimes a soldier gets it sometimes people get it another thing causes it worry worry will cause it worry has no virtue in it at all just skip worrying except Faith another thing that'll that paragraph 41 another thing that causes it among people it's getting between two opinions that'll cause Amnesia and it gets you to a place where you actually what you've done you've lost your reasons you've lost your mind you can't make you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself worry will cause Amnesia when you keep worrying about that prodal son or that prodical daughter it'll cause you Amnesia and you'll start dwelling on the wha ifs well well what if this happens what if they get in a car wreck what what happens if I if if if if they don't get delivered what what if this happens what if that happens and all of a sudden that worry worry will get you between two opinions too now all of a sudden you're like well I don't I don't know I mean he the Lord said I'm Healed but you know I'm still sick and and and you know it's been so long and the doctors say this is going to happen and that's going to and if you're not careful you get between two opinions you got to stay anchored the devil will try to move you into a place where you where you're into two opinions and then what he says happens is you lose your reason you lose your purpose look I know what he's talking about I remember I had an experience as a kid I come into the presence of the Lord that I knew he was real because I felt his presence uh there was something wonderful that happened at Camp I was 12 years old you know and I I from I got home at 12 years old and and 13 years old 14 years old it wasn't long until you know the kids and Junior I now they were starting to experience things and whatnot and my parents thought I was just playing ball down the street but I was going over to this friend's house and going over that friend's house and before you know it I was in a car going over to a keg party and people were drinking and and I'm just hanging out with my friends I grew up with I don't really want to be there I mean I guess I do they're my friends but they're drinking they're smoking I guess I'm I'm glad to to to be with people and and maybe not being an outcast I don't know we didn't have no youth groups and the only thing we had was a ball to kick down the street maybe a neighborhood for a friend or two to do it with us and and you know that's just all of a sudden before you know to hanging out with people around the neighborhood we're getting older and the person say hey you want to you want to drink like no I'm a Christian like oh that's awesome that's really cool so am I you laugh makes me think of a time I was at at a restaurant and I was witnessing to somebody like you know what I'm a Christian like yeah that's awesome so am I like you know and the the awesome thing is I drink whenever I want I smoke whenever I want and I do whatever I want to like yeah man that's what I'm talking about I'm like which is never and they're like okay I'll get another server but these people they they think they're okay you better be careful that say devil just wants you to keep coming on his Turf and I kept telling people oh no I don't drink I don't smoke I'm a Christian well one time I was driving down the road with one of my friends he goes hey man you want a cigarette I'm like man you know I don't smoke why don't you smoke like um you know it's not it's not good for you it makes you cough and gives you cancer I lost my reason that was not why I didn't smoke I didn't smoke because I was a Christian but as soon as I didn't give a word answer I got spiritual Amnesia and then the devil said aha I got him between two opinions he's lost his reason just take a little drag huh a little drag what could a little drag do from a little drag to a cigarette to buming a cigarette to buying my own pack to what else are they smoking in the yard to what are they drinking and just like that when I lost my reason when I lost my purpose I got spiritual amesi and I lost my identity I didn't have all of it because I shouldn't have been there in the first place but whatever identity I had had in justification I had an experience I didn't have the Holy Ghost I wasn't Sanctified yet but I believe God was real and I knew that there was things that I didn't do as a Christian but when I lost my reason I got spiritual Amnesia and just like that I forgot who I was why I didn't do the things that I did and at the age of 15 I got swept out in into a life of drugs and alcohol just like that but I got good news Hallelujah just takes a moment in his presence just takes a moment in his presence one second his presence can undo what the world's done in all your life all the abuse all the oppression all the addictions all the alcoholism all the bad relationships and you feeling abused and misused and all of the scars and all the hatred that you've built up and you feel like nobody can love you I say just one second in his presence can undo the whole thing and wash your white as snow he can pull you out of that field he can wash you and cleanse you and deck you and dress you in his word of righteousness and tell you your bone of my bone and your Flesh of My Flesh you are my bride just takes a moment in his presence worry two opinions will make you lose your reason he says you've lost your mind you don't know who you are and you can't identify yourself now some of us here are in this condition make no mistake about it maybe in your mind you've come to some type of understanding of the Bible you've come to some type of understanding of the message of the hour but the Bible says by your fruits you shall know them look at your life are you living a life of the word are you living a life of consecration are you living a life of prayer are you living a life of overcoming are you seeing the same acts uh that are in the Bible manifest in your life is there an Evidence yes sir of the life of God moving and in action in your life or or is it just some type of mental understanding or maybe you see no fruits and you're bared and something inside you I want something God give me something there has to be something come you can't identify yourself where are you who are you why are you here you are not here to work a 9 to-5 there's just somebody at the nine of5 that needs to hear the gospel if you want a new job get to testifying you'll get one pretty quick but I say if it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen they persecuted him they persecuted the prophets before they persecuted you blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says be of good courage be of good cheer in the world you shall have tribulation but I have overcome the world it's about time you show up to the job site and show up to work and you start testifying look look I'm not here for the 9 to5 the 9 to5 is here for me I'm here to tell you I believe in a god who's more than able do you got people in your family that's sick I know a God that's a Healer you got people that need Deliverance I know a God that's a deliverer oh what are you talking about I know what it was like I once was in bondage I once was in sin but oh then I heard a message I heard a great shout of the Jehovah eagle fly over my Bard say son you don't belong down there in that condition anymore you've lived in the barnyard long enough scratching around in the manure piles of chickens you're an eagle come up here my son come up here how do I get up there Mama Eagle just jump son just jump come on up out of it it's time little eaglets to set your wings and fly you don't belong down there you have an inheritance there's something that belongs to you but you got to know who you are you got to know what it is that belongs to you you know I I I was thinking on this and it was I had a a worker who worked for me in in Arizona and I lived out in Arizona for six years and I had a worker uh had worked for me his name was rapael and and one day he asked for he said hey I I gotta not g to be able to come from work and I might I don't know how long it's going to be uh you know I got to go to court and he starts to tell me why he's going to court and I think that's really interesting what what had happened is he was before he worked for me he was working for a construction company and he he opened up some walls they were doing a remodel and opened up some walls and he found some big old ammunition cans he pulled it out and he opened it up I presume it was nothing but money let's just say $100 bills there was another one he opened it up he said I wonder what else is around here he started checking in all the walls after it was all said and done he counted $500,000 well what would you do with $500,000 now I was thinking brother Raphael you know not brother Raphael you know he was he was uh he had immigrated and I was thinking you know back in your country $500,000 would go a long way go a long way here you know what he did with the money well you obviously know cuz he was working for me he went and told his boss said hey boss I want you to know I found this in the walls he gave it to his boss he did the right thing week goes by two weeks go by and he's cleaning out his boss's truck and he's finding all these money bans he's thinking huh my boss is living good off that money I found he didn't feel right about it so he went and told the homeowners said hey I wanted you to know while we were doing the remodel I found $500 in your walls and I gave it to my boss well they called the authorities the police came in and so now you had the good old court case of Finders Keepers losers weepers so it went to court so the homeowners were saying look we're the homeowners that's how tows that belongs to us and the construction worker in his weak case probably because he had already spent a little bit of the money he says no I found it I get to keep it so it starts to go to court well it just so happened the people who sold the house to the new homeowners found out about it and they're like wait a second it was ours before or it was yours so they filed a lawsuit so now the court has three lawsuits for a sum of money of $500,000 who in the world fought the ruling so it went to appeals and it went to to the appeals court and the appeals court wrote and and I tell you I got tickled about this this happened back in 2008 and I was trying to find details on it and they released another news story on it like last month I thought thank you Lord that's they made a ruling on it and they said the court of appeals however so you have three people laying claims on an inheritance right Finders Keepers losers weepers no it was our house it was on our property it's ours the other people like wait a second we sold you the house it was ours before it was yours no but you had a clause as is best as is Clause ever you sold it as is so now they're going to let the court settle it the court of appeals however maintained in 2012 that legally the money was technically mislaid not abandoned so it rightfully belonged to the span's estate and The Heirs what had happened there was a man who lived there and he hid his inheritance in the walls of the building the daughters didn't know that they had retrieved some of the things but they didn't know they had an inheritance laying in the walls because it was veiled it was hidden behind a partition but then somebody discovered it remember it takes Discovery like that little blanket on the back of the couch remember the story about how they're they're watching the Antique Road Show I like to look at this story another way like the blanket like I'm the blanket on the back of the couch here I'm I'm just a a dirty blanket on the back of a house uh on the back of a couch in a house where a guy from his own testimony saying I've never had nothing I've never had anything in life and and all these things and the only value that you thought you had was just uh laying on the back of a couch but then all of a sudden an expert came along that's right there was a hidden value that that that had to be discovered and all of a sudden Malachi 45 said just take it out now look I want you to spread out the pages of the Bible I want you to look here and look and Malachi 4:5 he said behold I sent unto you Elijah a prophet and all of a sudden you're sitting on the couch like wait a second Hallelujah that looks a lot like me so shall it be in the days of the revealing of the son of man all of a sudden the value changed because there was Discovery there was an inheritance laying in the walls they didn't even know was there but the court made a ruling they said that it was mislaid technically not abandoned so rightfully it belong to the HS I say this bride has mislaid the promises of God long enough technically it's been mislaid you feel like you're not being an overcomer you feel like you haven't had victory in your life you feel like you're in bondage you feel like there's things that you can't can't break away from I say you've mislaid the promises of God long enough that there has been a discovery that is not your condition that is not who you are there is an inheritance that has been open up you you are hes of all things it's about time we pick up the promises of God and believe what he said and believe that there ours thank you just a little further what do you have need of this morning come on we got some mislaid promises around here we got some things that we're hirs to that we might not even know about is somebody here need something is there some needs here does anybody need Deliverance anybody need a change come on lifting your hand won't hurt come on that's it you're Defying Gravity when you do that you're making a move from you when you do that God sees that hand God sees that attitude God sees the need he has an inheritance for you that's been misplaced but now you're coming into a discovery that you are that one he's talking about you have to be the one in the building to say you know what that's me mama that's me the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy this is out to possessing all things I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your

why you've been suffering all these years it's why you've been going in Cycles of Revival and death there's just a mislaid promise you're not an alcoholic that's not your identification you're not a drug addict that's not your identification you're just suffering from spiritual Amnesia there's a mislaid promise that you are a predestinated son of God I say it's time you stand up and tell that old I'm sick and tired of it I'm a Son of God I'm sick and tired of living below my privilege I claim my family I claim my brother I claim my mother I'm going to speak to the mountain in the name of the Lord House of Hell give away you are delivered you are free who the son of man has made free is free indeed oh Hallelujah speak to the mountain [Applause] Hallelujah go ahead it won't hurt you you might as well get in the flesh it's what he gave you thanes brother Matthew you're being carnal yeah you it's all I got it's the veil he gave me so if you're going to see me praise the lord it's going to be in this Veil if you're going to hear me speak to the mountain it's going to be in this Veil but just because you see David mcgi in this Veil that's not who you're really looking at in the natural I'mma chip off the whole block but in the spiritual Hallelujah I'm a chip off the old block I am just like him a matter of fact I got a Vindicated Prophet that said you've got to be Sons and Daughters of God you've got to be born of God and God is the word when I become part of my father I become all my father when you become part of God you become God in full [Applause] the fullness of the godhead is in the bride Hallelujah where is the pillar of fire where is the cloud it's right here right now in the bride body Hallelujah there headstone has come down oh Hallelujah I feel like I'm ready to preach now hallelujah hallelujah oh the Bible said be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he reap I got news for the Devil the devil loves that scripture but there's a people that love it even more oh yes devil I know I know if I sow to the flesh I'll reap a whirlwind but it says whatsoever a man so let it be known unto you by Divine promise the son of man has come and the son of man has sown and he has sown a word and he has sown a seed and according div Divine promise that seed is now taken on flesh and a many membered body prde you can do the Greater Works you are the Invincible Army speak the word speak the word Satan lay it down give it back Hallelujah I'm waiting to hear a voice of waters I'm waiting to hear a people wake up out of the spiritual Amnesia it's like I just called the winning lottery ticket number you're you're air you're the predestinated the mighty Angel has come down to put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea what did he do he called your name oh I wanted to get to it your identity has to be a revelation because spiritual Amnesia has hit the church spiritual Amnesia has hit the age The Whole World's lost their identity they've been groping in darkness but the Bible said in the evening time it shall be light amen gross Darkness upon the people but rise and shine thy light has come it's dark everywhere remember the story in the cave Darkness on every hand little boy with a sister they way down in the cavern in the caves and they wanted to show how dark it was they turned off the light and you can almost practically feel the darkness the girl started crying mom it's dark in here I can't see I can't identify anybody I can't identify the lord I can't can't identify my condition I can't identify anything but her brother said don't worry little sister there's a man here that can turn on the light and his name is Jesus all right and shine thy light has come Hallelujah if the musicians are come oh bless his wonderful name Hallelujah it takes a revelation how are you going to know who you are how are you going to know what did our text say than the mystery of his will how are we going to know what the Mysteries are how are we going to know who he is how are we going to know where we're living how are we going to know all about it if we're living in the age of adoption we're living in the age of the Overcomer if all these things are where we're supposed to how are we ever going to know how are all these things going to happen my Bible tells me in Amos 37 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets to his servants the prophet don't fear little sister Elijah has come Hallelujah don't fear little church Elijah has come and he shall turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children there's a man here that can turn on the light in the breach he says the seven seal holds the mystery of the book until we can see what those Seven Seals has sealed in we're only presuming them things because I've told you this morning in my little message this morning God hiding himself in Simplicity we are sure to miss

God does and you come to his house and the word is preached and something within your heart is pricked as the scripture will say and some will say what can I do to be saved and the formula is right here in the Bible as the Lord has given it to us and as the disciples spoke and they said uh John 2 we read from 37 he says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostle it says men and Brethren what shall we do Peter said unto him repent and be baptized every one of you and it says every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so it's the gift that you receive from God and he says for This Promise is unto you your children's children to all that are far off even as many as our Lord God shall call so the promise continues on even until this day we still bring many to the kingdom you want to say something I want to thank God that he's given me to have
