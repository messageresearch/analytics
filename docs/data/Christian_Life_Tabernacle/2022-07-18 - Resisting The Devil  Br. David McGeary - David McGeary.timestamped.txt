[35:38] [Music]
[35:44] Bible reading tonight
[35:46] I'm gonna read Bible stories I like
[35:51] everybody like a good Bible story
[35:54] amen amen so let's first of all open our
[35:58] Bibles to the gospel of James
[36:03] and we want to read a scripture there
[36:06] in James 7
[36:08] uh
[36:09] James the fourth chapter and the seventh
[36:12] verse
[36:14] and uh
[36:20] I don't know really have a title I guess
[36:22] we could call it resisting the devil or
[36:26] how about tell the devil to take a hike
[36:30] or get behind me Satan
[36:33] and right so any number of those are
[36:37] good titles
[36:40] that's at this simple scripture submit
[36:43] yourselves therefore to God
[36:48] and that a good
[36:49] word of advice
[36:52] amen submit yourselves therefore to God
[36:55] resist the devil and he will flee from
[37:00] you father we ask you to bless your word
[37:02] to us in your precious name we pray amen
[37:06] God bless you may be seated
[37:11] I uh I don't know if you caught it this
[37:14] morning but I certainly did appreciate
[37:17] uh when when brother Tim felt inspired
[37:20] to come back and and share that with us
[37:23] because it was it was just such a
[37:26] perfect match with the word of the Lord
[37:29] you know and you know the the a lot of
[37:32] times when God moves like that a lot of
[37:35] those things are missed you know what I
[37:38] mean because everything's been so
[37:41] sensationalized that the Simplicity of
[37:45] the Gospel sometimes goes unnoticed I'd
[37:48] like to read this statement that
[37:50] uh before we go into what we're we're
[37:54] just going to share
[37:58] um you know
[38:01] brother Graham was taught this morning
[38:03] talking about how the systems of the
[38:05] world they've tried to build everything
[38:07] into a system some way to save the world
[38:10] instead of taking God's way of saving
[38:13] the world which is the word of God then
[38:16] he points this out and he says
[38:20] he says I don't see how it could get any
[38:22] worse than what it is now the whole
[38:26] thing is corrupt our political World
[38:29] man-made systems and the Fashions he
[38:33] says he says we want everything just
[38:36] everything so we can take it easy
[38:41] and retire
[38:44] and and take life easy life was an
[38:48] intended to be easy
[38:51] life is a struggle
[38:54] and anything that's got life is a
[38:57] struggle
[38:58] look at a tree how they struggle look at
[39:02] at everything that's got life
[39:05] it's a struggle and when we try to get
[39:08] some kind of a system and take it easy
[39:12] then we're wrong and we know there's
[39:15] something wrong and I thought you know
[39:18] uh
[39:20] that
[39:21] that seems to be human nature it
[39:24] certainly seems to be my nature you know
[39:27] that we like to take things easy but I'd
[39:30] like to go back and like I said we'll
[39:32] read a little but I want to go to
[39:35] Hebrews
[39:36] are very familiar chapter of Hebrews we
[39:40] all love and it's Hebrews chapter 11.
[39:44] and we we know this uh
[39:50] chapter
[39:52] mainly by two verses that are the ones
[39:56] that we probably all have memorized and
[39:59] it's Hebrews 11 1 says now Faith is the
[40:04] substance of things hoped for the
[40:07] evidence of Things Not Seen so we know
[40:11] that
[40:13] faith is not attached to any of our
[40:17] senses but it's attached to God speaking
[40:22] to our heart and giving us Revelation
[40:24] the other scripture that we so often
[40:27] refer to us but without faith is
[40:30] impossible to please him
[40:33] for he that cometh to God Must Believe
[40:37] that he is and that he is a rewarder
[40:42] of them that diligently seek him
[40:47] and then our
[40:49] chapter goes on and it says by faith
[40:52] Noah being warned of God
[40:55] not
[40:57] uh
[40:58] God of things
[41:00] not seen as yet
[41:03] moved with fear and prepared an ark to
[41:07] save his house so uh no I didn't see
[41:12] rain before he moved but he believed
[41:15] what God said to him and and he acted
[41:18] upon it and it says by faith Abraham
[41:21] when he was called to go out into a
[41:25] place which he should after receiving
[41:28] for inheritance obeyed and and went out
[41:33] not knowing whether he went uh there's
[41:37] another great attribute of faith that he
[41:41] was told here take off you know I'm
[41:44] bringing to a land this land is going to
[41:46] be inheritance but he didn't know where
[41:48] he went he went by faith you know I
[41:51] believe that God's looking for a church
[41:53] that can follow him amen amen that can
[41:56] trust him and looking and I I believe
[41:58] he's building that up in us I believe
[42:00] we're coming to that I honestly do I
[42:04] believe that he's trying to set our
[42:06] minds to where we start looking for the
[42:10] supernatural and and so he talks about
[42:13] Abraham he talks about the faith of
[42:16] Sarah
[42:17] he comes down and he talks about Moses
[42:20] and and by faith how Moses chose the
[42:23] children of Israel uh that appeared to
[42:26] be slaves and mud daubers but he chose
[42:29] them over all the riches of Egypt to be
[42:33] to to make his uh identification with
[42:38] them and he numbered himself among them
[42:40] and and uh it's it's good to be numbered
[42:44] amongst the despised of this world Amen
[42:47] so we know those things about Abraham
[42:49] and these things but I'd like just to
[42:52] jump down here
[42:54] uh as we read in that and
[42:58] um and go uh who talks about Rahab but
[43:02] I'd like to go to the uh
[43:05] um
[43:07] 30-second verse and I'd like to read the
[43:10] rest of the chapter because this is
[43:13] another aspect of faith
[43:15] and I think one of the things that we've
[43:17] got to really start to understand is
[43:19] that that we're not always able to run
[43:24] from the Devil
[43:26] sometimes you just got to stand up and
[43:28] face them you know what I mean sometimes
[43:31] you just gotta call it like it is and
[43:35] stand and make your make your claim your
[43:39] your faith claim you've got to claim the
[43:42] land that's yours you've got to claim
[43:44] your inheritance we a lot of times speak
[43:47] it this way you got to possess the gates
[43:49] of the enemy that you've got to stand
[43:51] there and say enough
[43:54] is enough
[43:55] you know what I mean this is the day I'm
[43:58] standing in the sand this is the day but
[44:01] that I'm not going to be moved this is
[44:04] the day I'm going to call you what you
[44:06] are uh this is the day of my Deliverance
[44:09] this is the time that I'm not going to
[44:12] go any farther I'm going to stand and
[44:15] fight and then we start reading these
[44:17] great stories here that we continue to
[44:22] read
[44:24] and and it says here he said
[44:27] what shall
[44:29] what and what shall I more say
[44:33] for the time would fail me
[44:36] to tell of Gideon
[44:38] and a Barrack and of Samson
[44:43] and of uh
[44:47] of David also and Samuel and of the
[44:52] prophets
[44:53] who by faith subdued kingdoms
[44:57] Roth righteousness
[44:59] obtained promises stop the mouths of
[45:03] lion quench the violence of fire escape
[45:08] the edge of the sword
[45:10] out of the weakness they were out of
[45:13] weakness were made strong wax violent
[45:17] and fight
[45:19] turned to have flight
[45:22] the the armies of the aliens
[45:27] women received their dead race to life
[45:30] again and others were tortured not
[45:33] accepting Deliverance that they might
[45:36] attain a better resurrection and others
[45:39] had Trials of cruelly mockings and and
[45:43] scourging Yea moreover of bonds and
[45:47] imprisonment and they were stoned and
[45:51] they were sought asunder
[45:53] were tempted we're slain with the sword
[45:57] they they wandered about in sheepskins
[46:01] and goat skins
[46:04] at
[46:05] being guested to The Afflicted tormented
[46:09] of whom the world was not worthy
[46:13] they wandered in deserts and in
[46:16] mountains in dens and caves of the Earth
[46:20] and all these
[46:23] having obtained a good report through
[46:26] faith received not the promise God
[46:31] having provided some better thing for us
[46:34] that they without us should not be made
[46:38] perfect I thought you know uh
[46:43] do you think you want every scripture
[46:45] applied to your life
[46:47] you know sometimes when you really take
[46:50] a look at what uh
[46:52] people have gone through and things that
[46:55] have gone through you know it's amazing
[46:58] but the thing that I like about him and
[47:00] as we read just a couple of these great
[47:03] Bible stories here found in the Bible I
[47:06] want you to see that these Great Men of
[47:08] Faith they had to stand up to the devil
[47:12] you know there just comes a time you've
[47:14] just got to tell him to take a hike
[47:17] I mean it's just it she's a he's like a
[47:20] roaring lion he's he goes about he's
[47:23] always there to uh uh to try to make
[47:28] things difficult to withstand us and and
[47:31] we've got to resist him you've got to
[47:33] resist the devil and he will flee
[47:36] because we know one thing about him he's
[47:39] a bluff
[47:41] so let's turn in our Bibles and let's go
[47:44] to this great story as and I'm not a
[47:47] good reader so we'll have them put it on
[47:49] the board found in the Kings the
[47:53] 18th chapter of kings and and uh
[48:03] and as we uh read these uh scriptures
[48:08] uh
[48:10] uh we find out that uh in the 17th verse
[48:14] of the uh
[48:16] 18th chapter and it it says and it came
[48:20] to pass
[48:22] when ahem saw Elijah
[48:25] that Ahab said unto him
[48:28] art thou he that troubleth Israel now I
[48:32] want you to get the story Ahab Elijah
[48:36] told Ahab it's not going to rain till I
[48:38] call for it
[48:40] that's right and so they entered into a
[48:43] Great Famine right
[48:44] and in this time we know that Ahab was
[48:49] married to Jezebel yeah and in this
[48:52] famine Jezebel had turned to the gods of
[48:57] of pagan gods that got the gods of uh
[49:01] Balaam and uh so we find out that uh
[49:06] that they're serving a different God and
[49:09] so and if
[49:13] Eliza begins to answer and he says and
[49:17] he answered and said I have not troubled
[49:19] Israel but doubt in thy father's house
[49:24] in that ye have forsaken the
[49:27] Commandments of the Lord
[49:29] and thou Hast followed Balaam
[49:33] now therefore send and gather
[49:38] to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel and
[49:44] to and the prophets of Baal
[49:49] 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400
[49:53] which eat at Jezebel's table
[49:57] and so Ahab sent all the children of
[50:00] Israel sent to all the children of
[50:03] Israel and gathered the prophets
[50:06] together unto Mount Carmel now you think
[50:09] in reading that you think that he did
[50:12] that by obedience
[50:14] no he did that because he thought his
[50:17] hour had come to put Elijah in his place
[50:24] he was confident
[50:27] in what he believed
[50:30] right he had been deceived
[50:32] now this story has some really
[50:35] tremendous turns to it
[50:38] so
[50:40] and Elijah came unto all the people and
[50:44] said how long halt eat between two
[50:47] opinions
[50:49] if the Lord be God follow him
[50:53] but if Baal then follow him and the
[50:57] people answered him not a word
[51:01] and why wouldn't they answer that that
[51:04] seemed like a simple question he said as
[51:07] me as for me in my house will serve the
[51:10] Lord but what does it mean to be halted
[51:14] between two opinions
[51:17] it means you're not sure
[51:21] right it's like sitting at a table of a
[51:24] used car salesman and he's trying to
[51:26] sell you a car and you don't know
[51:28] whether you should or whether you
[51:30] shouldn't and he's trying to talk you
[51:32] into it and and he's starting to tell
[51:34] you you know this car has been in a
[51:36] garage and it's never went nowhere but
[51:38] to the grocery store you know and it was
[51:41] just a little old granny that had it you
[51:44] know what I mean and and uh and and just
[51:48] drawing on you and pulling on you but
[51:50] you can't pull the trigger
[51:53] I don't mean with a gun on the salesman
[51:56] I mean you you can't you can't you can't
[52:00] go ahead and say I'll take it
[52:03] you know what I mean you're stuck
[52:06] and and they couldn't speak a word
[52:11] because they weren't sure
[52:14] you know and and the devil exists
[52:19] you know you can't say he doesn't exist
[52:22] eases he's as real as you are
[52:27] and you know sometimes you just got to
[52:29] face them
[52:31] sometimes you just gotta look at them
[52:33] and call them what he is and say you
[52:36] know you're the devil
[52:39] I've been called the devil
[52:42] you know at least I thought well at
[52:45] least that she believes there's a devil
[52:47] right right you know what I mean let me
[52:50] say that good about them but so they
[52:54] they couldn't answer right
[52:56] why are you stuck
[52:59] and I think that that's what we need
[53:01] sometimes to do is look at both sides of
[53:04] the picture and I'll tell you choose God
[53:07] right
[53:09] amen that's what he that's what he said
[53:11] he says serve God and resist the devil
[53:15] don't hold don't don't you know that
[53:18] it's a two-edged sword it isn't just
[53:21] serve God
[53:24] you know that that's the trouble we
[53:26] always want to serve God you know you
[53:29] can't be a Christian to the devil
[53:34] I'm sorry
[53:36] he's a liar
[53:38] he's the father of lies and there's no
[53:41] truth in them
[53:43] the only way you can be a Christian to
[53:46] the devil is to speak the truth
[53:49] and the truth is Satan you are a liar
[53:55] you are the lowest thing
[53:58] there is you are going to burn
[54:03] all right
[54:04] you know you know we we tolerate them
[54:10] and I'd like you to look at uh Elijah
[54:13] here because he ain't gonna tolerate it
[54:16] you understand he he's come to the point
[54:18] I ain't gonna tolerate it I ain't gonna
[54:21] put up with this devil I'm not going to
[54:23] put up with this lie
[54:25] you know what I mean it's time that this
[54:27] comes to an end and and because so he he
[54:31] says here and the people answered not a
[54:34] word in other words they weren't
[54:35] convinced they weren't sold out and then
[54:37] Elijah
[54:39] unto then set Elijah unto the people
[54:44] I even I alone remain a prophet of the
[54:48] Lord but Bale's prophets are
[54:52] 450 men
[54:55] let them therefore give us two bullocks
[54:59] and let them choose one Bullock for
[55:02] themselves and cut it in pieces and lay
[55:06] it on wood and put no fire under and I
[55:11] will dress the other Bullock and lay it
[55:14] on wood and put no fire under it and
[55:19] and call ye on the name of your gods and
[55:24] I will call on the name of the Lord God
[55:28] the the Lord God that answereth by fire
[55:33] let him be God and all the people
[55:37] answered and said it is well spoken
[55:42] that's a that's a pretty straightforward
[55:45] thing right if God be God then serve
[55:48] them
[55:49] if Satan be God if God have The Truth
[55:52] Listen to him but if Satan have The
[55:56] Truth Listen to him why would you listen
[55:58] to somebody that's a liar and you know
[56:02] he's a liar
[56:05] there's no truth in them
[56:09] they think someone came one time and
[56:11] said you know brother McGarry pray for
[56:13] me Satan's telling me I'm going to hell
[56:18] that's like a ticket
[56:21] yeah
[56:21] you know what I mean that's like a
[56:24] ticket to Glory
[56:26] you know what I mean Satan says you're
[56:28] lost
[56:29] oh thank you Jesus
[56:32] because he can't tell the truth yes he
[56:35] can't tell the truth he just can't tell
[56:37] the truth he can't even he's so he's so
[56:42] stuck
[56:43] just like these prophets they so
[56:45] believed that they were serving a God
[56:48] but it wasn't a God that could answer
[56:50] that's right
[56:52] Satan can't answer Satan can only
[56:54] pervert
[56:56] and and so the he this sorry goes on he
[57:00] says
[57:01] and and uh that they said you know uh uh
[57:07] well spoken and Elijah said unto the
[57:09] prophets of Baal choose you one bull up
[57:12] for yourselves and dress it first for ye
[57:16] are many and call on the name of your
[57:20] gods but put no fire under
[57:25] so he even let them make the first
[57:27] choice
[57:29] you know you you pick so I don't want
[57:31] you to say that I had anything to do
[57:34] with it I'll take what you leave over
[57:37] you know now I want you to uh
[57:41] you're you're the Elijah's
[57:44] of this day
[57:47] and they took the Bullock which was
[57:49] given to them and they dressed it and
[57:52] they called on the name of Balaam from
[57:55] morning until noon
[57:57] saying oh Baal hear us
[58:01] but there was no voice
[58:04] nor any that answered
[58:06] and they leapt upon the altar which was
[58:10] made I want you to see all the carrying
[58:14] on
[58:15] doesn't move God
[58:19] now I don't have this on
[58:22] tape to
[58:25] um
[58:28] back it up in any way and prove it but
[58:32] my good friend Doug mchughes he sat
[58:35] across from me one day and he said
[58:38] Brother David brother Branham looked me
[58:39] right in the eye
[58:42] and he pointed at me
[58:44] and I'll paraphrase it the best I can
[58:47] he said brother Doug
[58:49] you can holler
[58:52] and scream till you have no voice left
[58:57] he said you can fast tell your skin and
[59:00] bones
[59:02] he says you can pray tell your knees our
[59:07] fullest gaps he says you can cry until
[59:11] you don't have any tears left
[59:14] he says but God's not going to do any
[59:17] more for you than what he said he would
[59:21] do for you
[59:22] there's one thing God can't do and
[59:26] that's lie
[59:27] he keeps every promise
[59:30] we've spent too much time trying to
[59:33] change God's mind
[59:36] and not
[59:37] accepting God's mind and asking God to
[59:41] change our mind I want you to see all
[59:44] that they're doing all could be effort
[59:47] all their leaping on the altar they're
[59:50] going on it even gets worse so they
[59:54] prayed for from morning till noon oh
[59:57] hear us oh bail
[59:59] right and so it says they they
[1:00:04] and
[1:00:05] there there was uh
[1:00:09] and they left upon the altar which was
[1:00:12] made and it came to pass at noon
[1:00:15] Elijah mocked them
[1:00:21] now
[1:00:22] I think we're
[1:00:24] we're afraid of the bluff
[1:00:29] he wasn't afraid to call Satan what he
[1:00:31] is
[1:00:32] he wasn't afraid to look I said this is
[1:00:35] the devil I'm not buying it I'm not
[1:00:37] taking it this is true it's like we we
[1:00:40] become Advocates you know maybe not on
[1:00:45] purpose but we try to justify things
[1:00:47] that don't no other explanation other
[1:00:50] than it's a devil
[1:00:52] we try to find truth for a lie we try to
[1:00:56] justify sometimes people that we love
[1:00:59] and and and and and make excuses for
[1:01:03] them that doesn't help them any the
[1:01:05] truth of the matter is the truth the
[1:01:07] truth
[1:01:10] you know God doesn't lay anything to the
[1:01:12] charge of God's elect we might as well
[1:01:15] speak the truth and go forward see in
[1:01:18] righteousness you know but we you can't
[1:01:21] give Satan any space at all if he can
[1:01:24] get his shoe in the door
[1:01:27] you know what I mean
[1:01:29] he'll be setting up camp
[1:01:33] you know what I mean if you let him in
[1:01:35] he'll you'll have a house guest
[1:01:38] that's the kind of person he is yeah
[1:01:41] he's got he's he he sucks virtue he
[1:01:45] sucks strength he sucks your time he
[1:01:48] sucked your mind he tries to dry up your
[1:01:51] faith there's nothing in it for you he's
[1:01:54] all about himself
[1:01:56] and he he doesn't know what truth is
[1:01:59] and so I like this he says and it came
[1:02:02] to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them
[1:02:05] and said cry aloud
[1:02:10] for he is a God
[1:02:13] either he is talking
[1:02:17] or he is pursuing
[1:02:20] or he is in a journey
[1:02:24] or pre-aventure he's sleepeth
[1:02:27] and must be
[1:02:29] awakened
[1:02:32] I like that
[1:02:34] I mean
[1:02:36] this guy is not
[1:02:38] playing games
[1:02:40] he knows where he stands he knows what
[1:02:43] God told them to do he's not sitting
[1:02:46] here going to try to baby these guys
[1:02:48] along or anything he says all right you
[1:02:51] claim okay cry louder he must be asleep
[1:02:57] and they cried aloud and cut themselves
[1:03:02] after their manner with knives and
[1:03:06] lancets till the blood gushed out upon
[1:03:10] them
[1:03:15] that's how fanatical
[1:03:17] that's how far Satan will go
[1:03:20] he has no limits
[1:03:23] he'll take your children he'll do
[1:03:25] whatever he can you've got to resist the
[1:03:29] devil you've got to fight him you've got
[1:03:32] to stand against him when he creeps up
[1:03:34] in his infancy you can't let him there's
[1:03:37] not a place that that he starts that
[1:03:41] doesn't grow you've got to stop him
[1:03:44] right at the doorway
[1:03:47] in fact when you possess his Gates you
[1:03:51] don't even give him an entrance in you
[1:03:54] fortify yourself behind God's word you
[1:03:57] fortify yourself behind promises you
[1:04:00] build yourself up in the word of God you
[1:04:02] study to show yourself approved yeah you
[1:04:06] know you've got an adversary and you
[1:04:09] know he's a lion and and part of your
[1:04:12] life is a life of knowing you've got to
[1:04:15] defend him because he's coming
[1:04:22] he's coming
[1:04:24] he's gonna come lie to you
[1:04:28] so you got to be ready
[1:04:30] you got a challenge you got to let them
[1:04:32] know you're not afraid of them
[1:04:34] you've got to stand right up against
[1:04:36] them you got to speak to him you've got
[1:04:39] you gotta calm as a liar you gotta say
[1:04:42] that's just a trick of the devil when he
[1:04:45] starts working on your mind you you've
[1:04:47] got to just answer them I remember one
[1:04:49] day in Montana
[1:04:51] uh it was an experience I'll never
[1:04:53] forget I was just writing down the road
[1:04:56] coming up this beautiful Mountain Trails
[1:04:58] going up towards my house and
[1:05:01] and all of a sudden I felt the presence
[1:05:03] in my truck
[1:05:05] and I'm telling you it felt like
[1:05:07] somebody was sitting there
[1:05:09] I'd have reached over and touched it but
[1:05:11] I was too scared
[1:05:14] and all this good and it smoked it just
[1:05:16] sparked on me he said what if this isn't
[1:05:20] true
[1:05:24] what if
[1:05:26] you know what if you left California and
[1:05:29] it was a mistake
[1:05:32] you know and again just started erasing
[1:05:36] the questions just started questioning
[1:05:38] my faith just started questioning my
[1:05:40] decisions it's just you know what if
[1:05:43] it's the right thing then I'm thinking
[1:05:45] here I am a Montana you know I come out
[1:05:47] of California we're facing winter I've
[1:05:50] never lived here before uh I thought you
[1:05:53] know I I I didn't know what I was doing
[1:05:58] you know me and Leslie were just married
[1:06:00] and
[1:06:02] I don't remember if I we were expecting
[1:06:05] Sharon or not and I just remember him
[1:06:08] asking me that
[1:06:10] and I remember
[1:06:12] if I
[1:06:14] start to think that
[1:06:17] if I even consider that
[1:06:20] if I even take that in
[1:06:24] yeah and start looking at it through one
[1:06:27] Speck could have I done something else
[1:06:31] my faith would have been shattered
[1:06:36] I said get out of my truck Satan get out
[1:06:41] of my truck get out of my head get out
[1:06:45] of my life I know this is truth I know
[1:06:48] God spoke to me you're right I I'm
[1:06:52] journeying into a land I never benefit
[1:06:55] to before but I know one thing when I
[1:06:58] listen to that message he said it is I
[1:07:01] be not afraid
[1:07:03] and so I'm committing my life into his
[1:07:06] hand and and I'll tell you you'll
[1:07:09] strengthen yourself
[1:07:12] spiritually
[1:07:13] by not giving the devil any ground
[1:07:16] you'll strengthen Yourself by realizing
[1:07:20] you have a right to mock him
[1:07:26] oh that ain't Christian
[1:07:32] well you you look at I mean what did
[1:07:35] Samson do
[1:07:37] with the King
[1:07:39] in all the spoils that were brought back
[1:07:42] contrary to God's word
[1:07:45] you say well he took the king and tried
[1:07:47] to lead him to Judaism no he didn't
[1:07:50] you know what he did cut his head off
[1:07:53] because God said slay them all
[1:07:55] what did he do he slayed them all
[1:08:00] you say that's not very nice
[1:08:03] what did Jesus do when he went into the
[1:08:05] temple he said oh men and brethren
[1:08:11] it's really not a good idea
[1:08:13] that you sell on the Sabbath and that
[1:08:17] you do these things
[1:08:19] you know no what did he do
[1:08:24] he prayedeth a a rope he he sat down I
[1:08:28] could just imagine him I I played this
[1:08:30] through my mind do you play Bible
[1:08:32] stories through your mind I'm a big
[1:08:34] Daydreamer so I I've watched him raid
[1:08:38] that rope 100 times
[1:08:40] every time it gets bigger
[1:08:43] you know what I mean just tying them
[1:08:45] knots looking at them guys the scorn
[1:08:48] just in his eyes looking at him those
[1:08:51] poor little people coming up and barely
[1:08:54] got a little bit and this guy and
[1:08:56] they're just giving their money and
[1:08:58] these guys selling doves and selling
[1:09:01] offerings and putting the money in there
[1:09:03] and and ripping them off and and and all
[1:09:08] that stuff and and these people just
[1:09:10] wanting to serve God it's a whole lot
[1:09:13] like religion today
[1:09:15] what did he do he prayed it the the cord
[1:09:19] up and he went in there and he started
[1:09:23] kicking their tables over
[1:09:26] you know what I mean he didn't have room
[1:09:29] he didn't have space for the enemy
[1:09:34] he called them all the time use you
[1:09:36] Hypocrites you know what I mean uh come
[1:09:40] here give me a Hypocrites render to
[1:09:42] Caesar what Caesar into God's what's God
[1:09:45] this this idea that that we're a bunch
[1:09:50] of nobody's Christians are rugged
[1:09:55] they you got it to be a Christian you
[1:09:58] got to be rugged
[1:09:59] you got to stand up you got to be as
[1:10:02] wise as a serpent and as harmless as a
[1:10:05] dove and he just beat the fire out of
[1:10:08] him
[1:10:09] that's what he did he kicked their
[1:10:12] tables over and whooped them and beat
[1:10:14] him and drove them out and said you've
[1:10:17] made my father's house a den of Thieves
[1:10:20] it's hard sometimes to stand for the
[1:10:23] truth it's hard sometimes when there's
[1:10:26] people you love involved in things that
[1:10:29] you love that are involved it's hard but
[1:10:32] wrongs wrong and rights right and the
[1:10:34] gospel doesn't need to be handled with
[1:10:37] kid gloves it's the truth it's the truth
[1:10:40] that set you free one day the very truth
[1:10:43] that you speak will come back and bless
[1:10:46] your children
[1:10:49] they will the word of God doesn't return
[1:10:52] void don't give space to the devil
[1:10:56] don't give space to them
[1:10:59] let's go with my story
[1:11:01] it's not my story it's Elijah's story
[1:11:04] but it's mine too
[1:11:06] because I identify with them don't you
[1:11:12] and it came to pass when midday was
[1:11:15] passed and they had prophesied until the
[1:11:19] time of the offering of the evening
[1:11:22] sacrifice that there was neither voice
[1:11:26] nor any answer nor any regard
[1:11:32] you know why because Satan don't regard
[1:11:35] you
[1:11:37] he hates you he despises you
[1:11:43] he has no regard for you or for what you
[1:11:47] believe or for what you stand for
[1:11:50] that's why you gotta fight
[1:11:53] for what you stand for
[1:11:56] when the world wants you to go contrary
[1:12:00] to the word of God don't compromise
[1:12:04] stand up
[1:12:06] and fight
[1:12:08] and Elijah said unto the people come
[1:12:11] near unto me all the people came near
[1:12:14] unto him and he
[1:12:16] he repaired the altar of the Lord that
[1:12:20] was broke down
[1:12:24] what do you think those guys did to that
[1:12:26] altar
[1:12:27] leaping on it and gash in on it and
[1:12:30] carrying on
[1:12:32] don't you think what's what's the Lord
[1:12:34] done in our day he's repaired our altar
[1:12:38] he's repaired it back to the word of God
[1:12:41] he told us that Satan's a bluff
[1:12:45] now look at all that carrying on
[1:12:48] how are the people sitting back waiting
[1:12:51] any minute that the a fire was going to
[1:12:53] fall
[1:12:56] and Elijah took 12 Stones according to
[1:13:00] the number of the tribes
[1:13:03] of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word
[1:13:06] of the Lord came saying Israel shall be
[1:13:10] mine thy name and with those stones he
[1:13:13] built an altar in the name of the Lord
[1:13:16] and he made a trench about the altar as
[1:13:20] great as would contain two measures of
[1:13:23] seed and he and he put the wood in order
[1:13:28] and cut the Bullock in pieces and lay
[1:13:31] and laid it on the wood and and filled
[1:13:36] four barrels of water imported on the
[1:13:39] burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he
[1:13:42] said do it
[1:13:45] the second time and they did it a second
[1:13:48] time and he said to it do it the third
[1:13:52] time and they did it the third time
[1:13:57] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:14:01] the Holy Spirit I mean whatever you
[1:14:04] would like to go first pull second poll
[1:14:08] third pole
[1:14:09] amen and the water ran about the Altar
[1:14:13] and he lifted the
[1:14:15] the trench also and he filled the trench
[1:14:19] also with water and it came to pass at
[1:14:22] the time of the offering of the evening
[1:14:25] sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came
[1:14:30] near and said Lord God of Abraham
[1:14:35] Isaac and of Israel
[1:14:38] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:14:42] God in Israel and that I am thy servant
[1:14:46] and that I have done all these things at
[1:14:51] Thy Word
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:14:57] in that what we we want to start saying
[1:15:01] I've done all the things that I do
[1:15:03] at Thy word Hear Me O Lord hear me that
[1:15:08] these people may know that thou art the
[1:15:12] Lord God and that thou hath turned their
[1:15:15] hearts back
[1:15:17] again amen you think after all that God
[1:15:22] would have been done with Israel God's
[1:15:24] never done with his elect
[1:15:27] I don't care how far they stray
[1:15:30] I don't fear how far they go God will
[1:15:34] have a word he'll have a gospel he'll
[1:15:37] have something that'll find him he'll
[1:15:39] find something that'll reach him don't
[1:15:42] let the devil ever lie to you about your
[1:15:46] children
[1:15:50] refuse
[1:15:52] to accept his reasoning
[1:15:55] there's no reason God saved you
[1:15:59] what good reason have you given God to
[1:16:02] save you
[1:16:05] does any of you have a righteousness now
[1:16:08] that you would like to plead before the
[1:16:12] father
[1:16:13] to get in on
[1:16:15] I don't
[1:16:17] know I want to plead the blood
[1:16:19] I like that story of uh is was it Danny
[1:16:23] Henry was that who it was uh that
[1:16:26] had the dream and he come up before the
[1:16:30] presence of the Lord and he said Lord
[1:16:33] I'm Danny I'm the Evangelist I led
[1:16:36] thousands to the Lord and he started
[1:16:39] reciting all his works and he said the
[1:16:42] closer he got
[1:16:44] he he started to remember every little
[1:16:47] lie
[1:16:48] every little thing he wasn't just a
[1:16:52] hundred percent you know he didn't tell
[1:16:54] the whole story you know he he
[1:16:57] everything came to him
[1:17:00] and he said he was all he was sitting
[1:17:03] there waiting for is a voice to ring out
[1:17:05] depart from me you doer of iniquity
[1:17:08] condemned
[1:17:11] he had no righteousness to offer
[1:17:14] and then the voice rang out didn't it
[1:17:17] father
[1:17:18] he said it was the sweetest voice he
[1:17:21] ever heard father he stood for me and I
[1:17:25] promised if you would stand for me in
[1:17:27] this world that I would stand for you
[1:17:31] and God kept his word God always keeps
[1:17:36] his word there's only one thing you can
[1:17:40] count on
[1:17:41] and that's God keeping his word God
[1:17:44] cannot lie he'll keep his word let's
[1:17:47] just finish this story I I wanted to
[1:17:49] read a whole bunch more but we won't do
[1:17:51] it
[1:17:52] I would do it but we better not do it he
[1:17:55] said
[1:17:58] because
[1:18:00] he he he got and thou hath turned their
[1:18:04] hearts back again
[1:18:06] then the fire of the Lord fell
[1:18:09] and consume the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:18:13] wood and the stone and the dust and
[1:18:17] licked up the water that was in the
[1:18:20] trench and when the people saw it they
[1:18:24] fell on their face and they said
[1:18:28] the Lord
[1:18:30] he is the god
[1:18:33] the Lord he is the god
[1:18:39] that's a good place to end the story
[1:18:42] but there's something else here that
[1:18:45] I I still can't wrap my mind around
[1:18:50] in Elijah said unto them take the
[1:18:54] prophets of Baal
[1:18:56] let not one of them Escape
[1:18:59] and they took them and Elijah brought
[1:19:02] them down to the brook of keyson and
[1:19:06] slew them there
[1:19:08] and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up
[1:19:13] eat and drink
[1:19:15] for there is a sound of abundance
[1:19:19] of rain
[1:19:22] I I think I'd have just condemned Ahab
[1:19:28] I I'm amazed at his attitude
[1:19:32] right he's been
[1:19:35] worshiping
[1:19:36] but yet he said get up so Ahab went up
[1:19:39] and ate and drank and Elijah went on top
[1:19:43] of the of Carmel and he cast himself
[1:19:46] down upon the Earth and put his face
[1:19:49] between his knees
[1:19:51] and said to his servant go up now look
[1:19:54] towards the sea and when he went up he
[1:19:57] looked and said there is nothing
[1:20:00] and he said go again seven times and it
[1:20:04] came to pass at the seventh time he said
[1:20:07] behold there ariseth a little Cloud out
[1:20:11] of the sea like a man's hand and he said
[1:20:15] go up and say to Ahab prepare thy
[1:20:18] Chariot and get thee down that the rain
[1:20:22] stopped thee not
[1:20:24] and it came to pass
[1:20:29] well that that Heavens was black with
[1:20:33] clouds and wind and there was a great
[1:20:36] rain in Ahab Road and went to Jezebel
[1:20:40] and the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah
[1:20:43] and he girdeth up his loins and ran
[1:20:47] before Ahab to the entrance of jeril
[1:20:56] Elijah is rejoicing with them
[1:20:59] because he withstood the devil yeah and
[1:21:03] by withstanding the devil He restored
[1:21:06] back Israel
[1:21:07] I'm telling you you don't realize the
[1:21:10] power that you have in standing against
[1:21:13] the devil let's don't give the devil any
[1:21:16] space
[1:21:17] I wanted to read over in Acts about Paul
[1:21:23] uh
[1:21:25] and over in Samuel about David and and
[1:21:28] Goliath and how that David withstood
[1:21:31] Goliath and Goliath am I a dog that you
[1:21:35] come out here with a sheave in other
[1:21:37] words a little stick and he said I'm
[1:21:39] going to feed you the birds oh David
[1:21:41] didn't say oh please don't do that
[1:21:45] he says no he said you've defied the
[1:21:47] armies of the Living God I'm going to
[1:21:49] cut your head off and the birds and the
[1:21:51] fowls are going to eat you
[1:21:54] they withstood it they withstood okay
[1:21:57] David withstood Goliath and and he
[1:22:00] called them what he is he said you
[1:22:03] uncircumcised Philistine how dare you
[1:22:06] defy the armies of the Living God why he
[1:22:09] believed what his inheritance was
[1:22:12] do you understand what Satan's trying to
[1:22:14] do he's trying to rob you of your
[1:22:17] inheritance he's a thief no man with no
[1:22:21] if he knew the thief was going to come
[1:22:24] in he would protect his Goods
[1:22:28] that that's what you've got to do you've
[1:22:30] got to protect your promises you've got
[1:22:33] to protect your goods you've got to
[1:22:35] protect the things that God said about
[1:22:37] you you can't let him run you down
[1:22:42] destroy your personality destroy your
[1:22:45] self-esteem put labels on you that you
[1:22:48] don't deserve he says well you're a
[1:22:50] sinner you're no good well I'm not
[1:22:52] trusting in my righteousness
[1:22:55] my righteousness is filthy rags but he's
[1:22:59] applied his righteousness to me through
[1:23:01] the blood
[1:23:03] that's what I've got to stand for that's
[1:23:06] when I got to testify to I can't let if
[1:23:09] he was he's a robber he's a thief he
[1:23:12] tries to come in in the night what is
[1:23:14] the night it's Your Darkest Hours
[1:23:18] it's your low esteem it's your low
[1:23:20] points
[1:23:23] he wants to rob you he's got nothing
[1:23:25] good to say about you or to you
[1:23:29] don't listen
[1:23:34] he told me I was ugly now I feel like
[1:23:37] the most handsome guy around
[1:23:41] it's not the outside I'm worried about
[1:23:44] it's a character on the inside
[1:23:48] you know what I mean okay just I can't
[1:23:51] express enough
[1:23:54] serve God
[1:23:56] resist the devil
[1:23:59] resist the devil fight the devil lie
[1:24:02] call him a liar
[1:24:04] doesn't matter
[1:24:06] doesn't matter what the doctor says it
[1:24:09] doesn't matter if he looked at it and
[1:24:10] said oh you know something we've never
[1:24:13] had a reading before with blood pressure
[1:24:15] so low there's no possible way you can
[1:24:18] make it
[1:24:21] and that man believed God's word he
[1:24:23] believed God's prophet he said Doctor he
[1:24:26] wasn't mad at the doctor
[1:24:28] he said Doctor
[1:24:30] you're reading medical charts
[1:24:34] I accept that
[1:24:36] he said but I'm reading the promises of
[1:24:39] God
[1:24:41] and if it comes to me to believe
[1:24:45] the medical chart or the promise of God
[1:24:48] I'm not going to Halt between two
[1:24:51] opinions I'm going to choose God's word
[1:24:55] amen amen that's what I'm going to
[1:24:57] choose
[1:24:58] no wonder Paul said study to show
[1:25:01] yourself approved you brother REM said
[1:25:03] you've got to know what God promised
[1:25:06] you've got to know what his promises are
[1:25:08] go in there he said it's like a fish
[1:25:11] being in the ocean and saying oh I
[1:25:14] better not take a little gulp of this
[1:25:16] ocean I might use it all up
[1:25:19] you can't use it uh
[1:25:22] you say oh what happens if I use up all
[1:25:24] the blessings of God and all the mercy
[1:25:26] of God he'll create more
[1:25:31] he's an abundant Fountain how many times
[1:25:34] will he forgive you 70 times 70 in one
[1:25:37] day
[1:25:39] he practices what he preaches all right
[1:25:43] you know what I mean it just comes time
[1:25:45] that we've got to accept our election we
[1:25:49] got to accept our justification we've
[1:25:51] got to do all that we can to sanctify
[1:25:54] ourselves and in the places we're having
[1:25:56] trouble we ask for help right
[1:26:00] Lord I have a very hard time with this
[1:26:03] help me
[1:26:04] the scripture says in the wise will he
[1:26:07] turn you away he promised he wouldn't
[1:26:09] turn you away I don't care what Satan
[1:26:12] says
[1:26:16] I don't care what he says
[1:26:18] why
[1:26:19] because it ain't true
[1:26:21] it ain't true
[1:26:25] how much could we ever go on to say
[1:26:27] David when he looked at Goliath Goliath
[1:26:31] just started sputing out words the
[1:26:33] scripture said that Goliath cursed him
[1:26:36] and cursed is God and spirit
[1:26:41] he had no regard
[1:26:43] you can't reason with the devil that's
[1:26:46] right
[1:26:48] you can't reason with them you can't
[1:26:51] make a deal with them
[1:26:53] he if you made a deal with him he
[1:26:56] wouldn't keep it
[1:26:59] don't make a deal I'm not suggesting you
[1:27:01] try to make a deal with them don't
[1:27:02] listen to him walk away
[1:27:05] he's no part of your life he's no part
[1:27:08] of your mind he's no part of it he's
[1:27:10] just no part of it and I just wanted to
[1:27:12] talk about David how David withstood
[1:27:14] Goliath he withstood him
[1:27:19] because Daniel wouldn't bend
[1:27:22] his knee
[1:27:23] to a false god
[1:27:25] he wasn't afraid if it came down to it
[1:27:28] he would rather be eaten by lions
[1:27:32] then give the devil one inch of ground
[1:27:40] and then the last story I was going to
[1:27:43] read you could go ahead and read it
[1:27:45] because I loved that story too
[1:27:47] and it's the story I'll just tell the
[1:27:50] story you know the story but it's the
[1:27:52] damsel that began to follow Paul around
[1:27:55] you remember that story
[1:27:58] and she starts calling out and you know
[1:28:00] what she was saying she was saying the
[1:28:01] truth oh these men are men of God that
[1:28:05] they uh
[1:28:06] that that they they're bringing the word
[1:28:09] to Salvation Paul didn't need her
[1:28:11] vindication
[1:28:14] you understand he didn't want anybody to
[1:28:17] believe him because of her
[1:28:22] he didn't want anybody to put their
[1:28:25] faith
[1:28:27] in something that God didn't vindicate
[1:28:29] Paul wanted him to believe him because
[1:28:32] he didn't come with word only but with
[1:28:35] demonstration and power of the spirit of
[1:28:38] God he didn't need this damsel's help
[1:28:42] so he turned around
[1:28:44] and he cast that Spirit out of her
[1:28:48] and she had a master that was making
[1:28:51] lots of money
[1:28:52] you know the story I think it's in Acts
[1:28:55] uh
[1:28:56] 16 if I'm I'm not mistaken
[1:29:00] and so she she's making lots of money
[1:29:03] for this guy so this guy gets mad and he
[1:29:06] grabs Paul and and who is with them and
[1:29:10] and grows up and it throws him before
[1:29:14] the magistrates and and tells them all
[1:29:18] these stories about them and lies and
[1:29:21] and so they they rip their clothes off
[1:29:23] and they beat them and they throw them
[1:29:25] into prison
[1:29:27] and now not only did they throw him in
[1:29:29] the prison they threw him in the inner
[1:29:31] prison
[1:29:33] now my point is I want you to watch Paul
[1:29:37] not take anything from the Devil
[1:29:43] now we might have taken this story a
[1:29:46] whole different way so they throw Paul
[1:29:48] in there and in the middle of the night
[1:29:51] there's an earthquake and the doors open
[1:29:54] and the jailer
[1:29:57] it's going to take a sword and slay
[1:29:59] himself and Paul yells out from the dirt
[1:30:02] do thyself no harm we're still here
[1:30:06] how many other people you think were
[1:30:09] still there
[1:30:11] there's two people left in the jail
[1:30:15] why did Paul stay
[1:30:18] you ever think white balls day
[1:30:21] so the Jailer comes in
[1:30:24] and they're still there
[1:30:26] he knows they could have left
[1:30:29] and he throws himself at his feet and he
[1:30:31] says what must I do to be saved
[1:30:39] and Paul says the scripture says maybe I
[1:30:43] could just find that one little portion
[1:30:46] foreign
[1:30:50] Paul cried with the loud voice saying do
[1:30:53] thyself no harm for we are all here
[1:30:56] and then he called for a light and
[1:31:00] sprang in and came trembling and fell
[1:31:02] down before Paul and Silas and brought
[1:31:05] them out and said sirs what must I do to
[1:31:10] be saved
[1:31:11] and they said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:31:14] and thou shalt be saved in thy house and
[1:31:18] they spoke unto him the word of the Lord
[1:31:21] and to all that were in his house and he
[1:31:26] took them that same hour of the night
[1:31:28] and washed their stripes and was
[1:31:31] baptized he in all his house
[1:31:36] and he brought him them to his house and
[1:31:40] set meat before them and rejoiced
[1:31:42] believing in God and all his house and
[1:31:46] when it was they the magistrate sent the
[1:31:50] surgeon saying let those men go
[1:31:54] now I want you to watch Paul I want you
[1:31:57] to watch his attitude I want you to
[1:31:59] watch his stand I want you to watch the
[1:32:02] kind of guy that he was
[1:32:06] and the and the keeper of the prison
[1:32:09] told this saying to Paul the magistrates
[1:32:13] have have sent to let you go now
[1:32:17] therefore depart and go in peace
[1:32:21] and Paul said to them they have beaten
[1:32:24] us openly
[1:32:26] uncondemned
[1:32:28] being Romans and of cast us into prison
[1:32:33] and now do they trust us thrust us out
[1:32:38] privately nay but let them come
[1:32:42] themselves and fetch us out I like that
[1:32:46] that's that's my kind of guy right there
[1:32:51] you know you did all this to me and you
[1:32:54] want me to tiptoe away no Satan
[1:32:58] you come here
[1:33:02] he wasn't cutting them no slap
[1:33:04] and you think he left town
[1:33:07] no he didn't leave town
[1:33:11] he didn't run
[1:33:13] he didn't hide he wasn't just happy to
[1:33:16] get out of there alive well that's not
[1:33:18] his testimony
[1:33:20] and the and the surgeons
[1:33:23] told these words unto the magistrate and
[1:33:27] they feared when they heard that they
[1:33:30] were Romans and they came and besought
[1:33:32] them and brought them out and desired
[1:33:35] them to depart out of the city and they
[1:33:38] went out of the prison and entered into
[1:33:40] the house of Lydia and when they had
[1:33:44] seen the Brethren they comforted them
[1:33:47] and departed
[1:33:49] yeah
[1:33:50] that's the kind of attitude we need to
[1:33:53] have
[1:33:54] to the devil
[1:33:56] Sorry Devil
[1:33:58] you get no breaks
[1:34:00] you cut no slack I don't say pick a
[1:34:03] fight with them
[1:34:06] but when he comes you fight you resist
[1:34:10] you tell him what he is you tell him
[1:34:13] what you think you tell them what you
[1:34:16] stand for you don't give them a space
[1:34:18] man Satan shows up in a lot of different
[1:34:21] ways he shows up in your friend at
[1:34:24] school
[1:34:25] with some idea he shows up and a
[1:34:28] colleague at work with some story he he
[1:34:32] shows up with some business idea
[1:34:36] I only know my own little stories how
[1:34:39] the Lord blessed me I was working one
[1:34:41] day again back in Montana and I put a
[1:34:44] quarter in a pop machine and quarters
[1:34:46] dumped out of it handfuls of quarters
[1:34:49] just poured out of it you'd have thought
[1:34:51] I was in Las Vegas or something and I
[1:34:54] remember I scooped all those quarters
[1:34:55] and I brought him into the office and
[1:34:58] the guys were begging me
[1:35:01] don't bring those into the office
[1:35:05] you know buy us all Cokes
[1:35:09] Oh I thought man I could become pretty
[1:35:12] popular I could become one of the boys
[1:35:14] no no it was the devil
[1:35:19] it was the devil
[1:35:22] anything that's contrary to the word is
[1:35:24] what
[1:35:25] Antichrist
[1:35:27] it's the devil the devil speaking
[1:35:30] everywhere he's speaking through all
[1:35:33] kinds of things he's trying to get you
[1:35:35] to compromise don't give the devil any
[1:35:38] space let's fight the devil let's make
[1:35:41] him pay
[1:35:43] foreign
[1:35:46] how do you make Satan pay not by
[1:35:48] inflicting harm
[1:35:50] by staying true to God's word
[1:35:52] that's what he hates
[1:35:54] this bride will stay true
[1:35:57] to God's word regardless so that's our
[1:36:01] lesson for tonight the devil's a liar
[1:36:06] I can say that's the word of God there's
[1:36:09] no truth in them we have nothing to do
[1:36:12] with that guy we don't listen to him
[1:36:13] he's a failure and he's going to end up
[1:36:16] in the bad place and he's going to get
[1:36:19] all burned up us
[1:36:22] yeah Alice
[1:36:25] and I
[1:36:27] I don't feel sorry for him
[1:36:30] he's done me a lot of harm
[1:36:33] I have no pity
[1:36:36] you know what I mean
[1:36:39] he

[1:36:41] he's invited to the barbecue that's all
