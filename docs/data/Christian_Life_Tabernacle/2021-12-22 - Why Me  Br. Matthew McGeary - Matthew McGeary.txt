Description:
Why Me?
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Evening Service: December 22, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

continue to play that softly is that your heart's desire tonight that his word would be born in your heart and in your life and it would bear forth the fruits of the word and as we're just approaching this uh christmas time this christmas season where god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life i'm so thankful that i'm a recipient of this great love that god has loved us with and and that i could receive this great gift that god has given let's just go before him in prayer heavenly father how we love you tonight we're so thankful for your grace and your mercy and your love lord the greatest love gift that was ever given to mankind came wrapped in swaddling cloth in a little old manger only fit for animals not fit for a king but lord you humbled yourself and you came to be one of us that you could be the high priest that's touched by the feeling of our infirmities lord so we're encouraged tonight to know or do you know what we're going through you know the pain and you know the suffering you know the sorrows and you're mindful lord and it's that very gift that you gave of your life that if we could just be identified with the sacrifice tonight that we could be forgiven of our sins and we can receive the joy lord for you said who the son is made free is free indeed lord we're thankful tonight that we're a free people that we can come and worship you in spirit and in truth lord we just surrender ourselves and ask that you would come and break the bread of life now as only you can we love you we thank you for each one that's gathered each one that's not able to make it lord we commit them to you now in jesus christ's name we pray amen praise the lord if you have your bibles we'll be reading out of matthew chapter two i mean it's good to be in the house of god tonight amen it's it's it's wonderful to have brother burley with us but it's not wonderful that he's out there and not up here but you know i'm thankful that brother burley's had a chance to have a little rest and spend time with his family and so we just really appreciate uh brother burley and and the short times that i've had with him i've certainly learned from him uh with his words of wisdom and i i look up to him he's a a wonderful brother and minister of the gospel so we're just thankful to have him and his family that's been with us we're just reading out of matthew chapter two um we'll just start with verse one it says now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him i really like that portion of scripture says for we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him they didn't come to worship the star a lot of people want to worship the star they want to see the wonders in the heavens and they they see some big great happening but but i'm not interested in worshiping the star i'm not interested in worshiping the messenger but i'm wanting to to worship what the messenger introduced i want to i want to worship what the star was introducing and that was the birth of the lord jesus christ amen and it goes on to say when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all of the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet now i don't want to preach while you're standing but it's amazing here that these magis have seen the star and had come to worship him and here's all these theologians and all these people who are educated in the word and and the king would even gather him all together and say hey oh where is the king going to be born and they would all say well he's going to be born in bethlehem but right in their midst they were completely blind to the word being manifested in their midst amen because god comes in simplicity he says and and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem and the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah for out of these shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel amen you may have your seats just because of the season i i i just like to keep reading a little bit because this portion of scripture is just so wonderful it might be a little bit different type of service maybe you are usually used to hearing me be a little bit more evangelistical but i don't know if i can not be that but we're maybe going to have a little different uh approach this evening by his grace but if we keep reading there it says and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring word again that i may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures and presented unto him gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh and and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country and went another way amen my we could just we could just keep reading the scripture it's such a beautiful portion of scripture here but i just wanted to read this text here because the prophet of god would preach a message called why little bethlehem and you know if the prophet of god is asking a question or he's phrasing the question why little bethlehem then when the question goes forth something in your heart or in your mind you want to ask the question to yourself why little bethlehem because as you would ponder upon that and start to wonder well why is the prophet asking me why little bethlehem it's because he's going to give you an answer but in the question he's he's trying to to help your minds and help you in a way to to have a certain approach to the scripture so you can start to wonder well why is he even asking the question many times we look into the bible and we take things uh just for granted or or we read over it and we've heard it so many times that if we're not careful we don't actually catch the meaning or the heart meaning or or the purpose or the intent what god is doing when he's doing something so why little bethlehem the prophet of god is asking the question why little bethlehem so in preaching this sermon now he's he's wanting to have you start to take that question in your heart and now he's going to approach the word a certain way and give you the answer why little bethlehem so when the prophet of god would preach why it had to be shepherds well it's just not because oh well well because it says there in the bible that there was there was angels that appeared unto the shepherds god doesn't just do things uh for no reason but god has a purpose in doing it and god has a way in doing it when god does something one way he does it that way every time so if we can catch the revelation behind the word and what the prophet is trying to bring to you why little bethlehem all of a sudden it'll start to unlock a revelation and the scripture will start start to unlock something and your understanding you'll start to see that pattern now unfolding down through the scriptures and down through the word so we want to catch the mind of god behind the question why little bethlehem why it had to be shepherds and i want to title my sermon this evening why me why me typically when you would ask the question why me you know uh uh generally maybe you're you're dealing with something uh maybe some hardship or some trial or or something might be a difficult or you don't see your way through something and so you might ask the question how many have been going through a hard time or going through a hard trial and it just don't seem like things are working out and so you might ask the question why me i'm the only one well i can i can preach to myself tonight that's all right because i've sat there before and i've asked the question why me and this question maybe i could say it's twofold we can we can look at it two different ways by the help of god but but many times we we make decisions and and we wonder why did i do that or why me or why am i having such a hard time with this and maybe you look at other people's lives and if we're not careful we start to compare ourselves one to another and we start to wonder well why me and and many times you know a god has called us to different walks in life and different families and we come different ways and if we're not careful we start weighing our wealth with the things of the world and say well my family we live in a little apartment over here and we don't have a little much and then you start to get discouraged and satan starts to heap it up on you and you start to measure the success in your life and you start to measure where you're at with life and you start to measure your spirituality by looking at maybe the carnal things around you you start to wonder why am i like this why did i have to come this way why do i have to have this hardship why do i have to have this type of oppression why did i have to come this way why couldn't i come this way like this other brother oh because why me well there's an answer the spirit of god is wanting you to ask the question and i believe somebody here has asked the question in your heart you've asked why me and now the spirit of god is wanting to come to you and he's wanting to answer the question so if you can just catch the mind of god tonight and how he's going to walk you through the word you'll catch the revelation of why you why you we want to catch the mind of god now watch this the prophet of god would say we have seen his star and i've come to worship him and when god in any way that he desires to do it reveals to you the question that's in your mind there's no more doubt there's no more question about it it's a revelation and so you've been asking the question in your heart why me you've been asking why you've been going through you've been asking why you're in this season in your life and so if there's a question in your heart now god is coming to you he's going to answer the question in such a way it becomes a revelation to you that you know where you're standing you know why you're in the season you're in you know why you're going through the trials you're going through because god has chosen you you say why me god has a specific work that he wants to do in your life oh you might not be able to understand it but remember when god reveals to you the question in your mind there's no more question it's a revelation i think of paul how he sought the lord three times for this infirmity he said lord i would that this infirmity would depart for me and he prayed over and over how many have prayed for an infirmity that you would you would want to be delivered of and for some reason it just seems like it lingers there but i like now that this is not making a way for you not to stand on the promise of god if you're believing for healing you keep believing for healing you keep taking god's word you keep believing for the promised word that god has given you but in the midst of the trial come on somebody in the midst of going through it and while you're going through this trial and why you're going through this situation you can say like paul would say uh that that lord i sought you three times but god spoke back to him there in second corinthians 12 of verse eight and said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee i want to tell you god's grace is sufficient for you tonight he said my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly will i rather glory in my infirmity hallelujah oh my there should be some people if you got a little infirmity in your life why don't you just go ahead and start glorying in that infirmity and start praising god and giving god glory for paul said that the power of christ might rest upon me oh that i might glory and my infirmity god help me when i'm going through the hard times when i'm going through the trial when i have the infirmity when it seems like i'm down and out that i can have this revelation where i'm saying lord why me why am i going through these things why does it seem so tough why does it seem so high but i can kick right back at that devil and give him a black eye say oh i'm going to glory unto my god and mind infirmity and the things that i'm going through because my god he's more than able to deliver me he is my healer he is my comforter he is my guide he is my redeemer i'm going to praise him i'm going to rejoice i'm going to give him praise and in that infirmity you just go ahead and start praising the lord that the power of god might rest upon you and that in your weakness he will be made strong therefore i take pleasure in mind infirmity oh listen to this oh if there's a question god has a revelation for you tonight therefore i take pleasure in infirmities how many take pleasure and infirmities oh god i need a revelation tonight god give us a little revelation because i tell you i hate the breaks you've heard it a few times it ain't getting easier everybody's uh wanting uh uh all these plagues and viruses and everything to go go away and it looks like we're we're just getting back to norm and all sudden knock knock who's there omnicron omnicron who omnicron i didn't go away right oh you know it's just getting warmed up out there this is what you want to call pre-trib stuff as some would quote it this is just pretty this is nothing compared to what's coming down the pipe oh no you just you might as well dig into the word you might as well come into christ come and do where you're safe it ain't time to be playing around it's going to get a lot worse out there you think it's getting better no things are just getting warmed up oh what kind of doomsday messages christmas message is this brother matthew well it is a christmas message because with the onslaught of the devil and satan's eden god has given the greatest gift that he's ever given his son jesus christ that you would be identified with a sacrifice and you would apply the blood to your life and you could run into that shelter and be saved from the oncoming judgment that's what this message has come for it's come to deliver a people from the oncoming judgment i say that judgment has already come and that's what's striking the world today you're seeing the judgments for rejecting the grace of god therefore will i take pleasure in infirmities well we didn't even get past that one did we now i haven't had too many conversations you know brother andrew i just want to tell you man i mean i've just been taking a lot of pleasure in this infirmity i got i just wanted to tell you about it man this little this little pain i got going on i'll tell you man this thing it's really brought me to my knees and brought me closer to the lord oh oh maybe that ought to be the outlook maybe maybe that'll be the way to start approaching it because i don't know about you when i get desperate when i get in pain many people want to run to the medicine cabinet you want to run to the doctor you want to run the ladies see you but why don't we run to christ why don't we get down on our knees and take a scripture like this and say lord jesus i'm in pain right now but i'm going to take pleasure in my infirmity because it's drawing me closer to you that the power of god might rest upon me that in my weakness oh god you are made strong oh hallelujah therefore i will take pleasure in mine infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distress for christ's sake for when i am weak hallelujah then i am strong oh i look out into the world you see all the gloom and doom and the death and everything that's going on i tell you life can be cruel it can be very hard and those things that you love and hold dear to you as you would grow and you would get older it seems like those that are close they start to die or move away or or your mom and your dad your uncles and then those closest to you and tragedy strikes a home and it just seems like uh it seems like life can be so cruel and you look out there to the world where the scripture right here would say when i am weak but to them there's nothing after that they're just weak there's no hope there's no even hope of a resurrection there's no life after death because when i'm weak i'm really weak and when i'm weak i'm even weaker but oh a saints of god tonight oh why me in your distress in your infirmity in your weakness you can say for when i am weak then i am strong oh why little bethlehem the prophet of god would say god does things in unusual ways and god is so great till he takes the unidentified things of the earth to identify himself by it i want to maybe focus on that for a little bit now as god is so great till he takes the unidentified things of the earth to identify himself by it so in our scripture here in our text as we would read verse 6 it says in thou bethlehem in the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah for out of thee remember now god is so great till he takes something that's unidentified something that doesn't have any identity and god wants to go ahead and take that this something that seems insignificant something that's unrecognized something that's unrecognized by the world something that's unrecognized by the church world something that might be unrecognized by the age that seems like it has no identification but what god wants to do he wants to go ahead and take that individual he wants to go ahead and take that place and what he wants to do is he want to take that thing that is unidentified and that seems insignificant and he wants to identify himself by it oh i don't know about you but i could preach a little writer right there because that gets me excited that that gets me happy because i realize what the plan of god is for my life and what he wants to do in each one of us we ain't some big somebody we ain't got something to offer we're not some big church we're not some big program we didn't make ourselves nothing but what has happened in this age god has come by his grace and his mercy has come the capstone crying grace grace and he has taken a people that is unidentified that seems insignificant but he has taken them because he wants to identify himself by his pride in the end time thank you jesus because out of these shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel and just continuing on and why little bethlehem he says our minds cannot fathom how great he is and yet when he gets ready to reveal himself he makes it so simple takes the simple things to do it the simplicity of it zechariah 4 10 would say for who hath despised the day of small things what is that that's god hiding himself in simplicity the prophet of god would pick that up in the breach after preaching a god hiding himself in simplicity he would take this scripture and say for whoever despise the smaller things small things that's god in simplicity god in simplicity in here the greatest climax of the seventh angels message ministry wasn't uh going around the world it wasn't in a venue of ten thousand or a hundred thousand people but it was in a little constructed building in a little mud bed there in jeffersonville indiana where the revelation of the seven seals would start to break forth god hiding himself in simplicity god taking something that was unrecognized something that was insignificant where people would look out across the landscape and they'd see a little mud bed and wonder what in the world could that ever be worth something that was unidentified but yet god had great plans for that plot of land because it was going to be in that place where the sounding of the seventh angel's message went forth revealing the seven seals to the bride of jesus christ oh god taking something that seems so insignificant but he wanted to identify himself by it for who has despised the day of small things look while we're walking through this just start getting ready to put yourself in the word we ain't giving a history lesson here why little bethlehem it's not well why why did god choose little bethlehem 2000 years ago but god is wanting you to catch a revelation why me why me there's something here for the bride of jesus christ to catch a revelation of for who has despised the day of small things why little bethlehem and when god would rent the kingdom from saul he would tell samuel all right now i want you to go on down to bethlehem and i want you to go down to the house of jesse for i have chosen myself a king but but listen to me now samuel i i don't want you to look on his countenance i don't want you to look at his height and his stature and his build and and how good looking he is because that's what man does man looks on the outside but you see samuel i've actually chosen a king and i haven't chosen this king by the ways of man it's not going to be uh like saul who was who was head and shoulders uh taller than everybody else but i want you to go on down there and i'll tell you which one it is so here the prophet of god would go on down and samuel would come to the house of jesse and say hey i've come here to anoint one of your son's king and he's like all right well i know who that's going to be that would be my firstborn and he brings his firstborn son in there and here he stands before the prophet and by you could just imagine jesse thinking my to think the prophet of god has come down to my house to to anoint my son my firstborn look at him doesn't he look stately doesn't you know look look at how he's he's he's he presents himself well doesn't he doesn't he profit you know he he knows how to carry himself and and he looks pretty good don't he's like no that ain't him oh all right well i bring my second son you know he's he's been a blessing he he really works hard and you know he's really tried to to keep up with his brother and he he he's about the same height and the same building he really knows how to carry himself he's the one right nope and all of a sudden one after one after another after seven sons now think of this i mean the daddy basically said these are the seven sons i got that i mean should be out of these seven one of these should do prophet and the prophet had to look at jesse and say have you got one more now think of it think of it the prophet had to look and say hey do you got one more you you would think that that that jesse after going through seven as we just dramatized a little bit would say well if them seven didn't work hold on real quick i actually got one more but no even jesse himself was like what do you mean these are my seven eldest i mean one of these gotta work and the prophet looked at him said no i'm telling you you must got another one because none of these are written jesse looked back at the prophecy well i mean we i do got one more son he ain't much to look at you know so much so he's just you know he's just a little ruddy kid we just kind of keep them out there on the hillside you know keeping after the sheep and everything i mean he's not much to look at but you you want me to call him yeah that's why i'm here to annoy the king okay so they go in and they bring david on over to david comes in and then the prophet of god takes one look at david and he says that's him that's him and he anoints his head with oil and there david why david why bethlehem why little ruddy david the prophet of god would say well i've got one more perhaps but he wouldn't be nothing he's just a little dried up sort of fellow we got him out there hurting sheep he said go get him and as soon as he fell in the eyes of as soon as he fell in the eyes of the anointed prophet he poured the oil upon his head and run to meet him and said this is the one god chose see it's not tinsel always of the world it's god's choosing now focus on that for a little bit it's not the tinsel it's not the outward appearance it's not the works it's not what you can do for god but it's god's choosing why little ruddy david why little bethlehem the smallest of the cities a little judah because why it's god's choosing that's why it's the place that god had chose to bring his word to manifestation that's why little bethlehem that's why little david because it was god's choosing god had a purpose god had a design god had a word he had something that he was unfolding and if you would ask the question why little bethlehem why david because it was god's choosing now remember we're working towards a thought this evening why me micah 5 2 would say but thou bethlehem ephrata though thou be little among thousands of judah yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that to be a ruler in israel look there was no other place that christ could be born but where the word had prophesied the word to come forth you follow me there was no other place for that word for the word of the lord comes to the prophet and the prophet had spoken but bethlehem infertil although thou be little amongst those in judah oh the littlest city but out of thee so that king that ruler that governor had to come out of that house now i want you to think of this so there was no other place for that word to be born and so now here uh mary is a spouse to joseph and now she's with child and she's nine months pregnant and now they're going to have to now the the king has made a decree in a taxation where everybody has to return back to their homeland because they have to go back and partake in this tax now you could imagine joseph and mary being there nine months pregnant could you imagine the why me if anybody had a why me like joseph i'm nine months pregnant that is a five six day journey back to your home can't we just stay here and i think what's so wonderful is this is this this government mandate that seemed to be such a heavy taxation on the people was actually an instrument that god was using to get his children in position to fulfill the word of the hour oh my think of that saints of god the very laws that were going forth the very mandates that were being made here the devil thought he was doing something in his satani by trying to bring on the pressure trying to make it worse and make it worse but the only thing he was doing was fulfilling prophecy and he can bring it on satan can bring all he wants he can throw every fire and every shot at this bride he can try to drown you out and put you out and put you down but the only thing he is doing is making your character shine like gold because the character that's on the inside of the bride of jesus christ is none other than the lord jesus christ himself so let the trials come oh i can glory and mine infirmity i can glory in mine affliction hallelujah why because there's a character of gold there's jesus christ on the inside that's coming on the outside oh hallelujah well sometimes we don't know how not to get excited but praise god for his word this government mandate this taxation and here mary's wondering why me joseph we got to make this journey back through uh all the way back to bethlehem yes yes honey we better get going everybody's moving that way it's going to be real dangerous uh people are are all traversing back and you know out there that the robbers and the thieves and certain ones we want to try to get out there in the mix of everything because you know maybe a good samaritan will come by in case we need a little bit of help let's let's get going and so here they go nine months pregnant on a donkey going through rough rugged terrain five six day journey boy i can hear it right now why me i don't think any of us maybe some of you have but that sounds like a hard trial right there for mary now as her and uh mary and joseph are heading out that way and they're they're coming in they're getting closer and closer and now think about this here mary she's been impregnated with the word and now she's under this government mandate and maybe they're just having this conversation and she's saying joseph i don't think i can make it i don't i don't think i can make it i don't think i'm gonna be able to make it back and and you can see joseph being a lovely honey well honey if we can just make it there if we could just get get to my hometown i know there's people there that can help we try to make you comfortable uh we we can try at least get a little help for you and as she keeps going along and she keeps saying oh i don't think i can make it i wonder if there's somebody here this evening that you feel like you know what i don't know if i can make it i don't think i'm gonna make it if anybody felt like they weren't gonna be able to make it i can imagine mary as she was there on that donkey and every little bounce and every little motion and every little move she just felt like there was no way her body was just throwing fits on her she didn't know if she was gonna lose her own life maybe she didn't know all the mind battles going through your head and just wondering what's really happening to me why is this what god had in his mind for me to bring forth emmanuel is this really what god had in store for my life lord you called me you elected me you chose me i don't know if i'm going to be able to make it i got good news for you because mary had been impregnated with the word and mary didn't have a choice if she was going to make it or not because there was only one place that that word could be birthed and it was in bethlehem and i want to tell you pride of jesus christ you've been impregnated with the word of god and you keep wondering if you're going to make it i want to tell you you're going to make it because you will bring forth the fruit of this word because you've been predestinated to do it you are the chosen place that god has chosen in the end time to bring this prophesied word by malachi 4 5 into manifestation it's by the bride of jesus christ that's sitting right here in bedford maybe we can ask the question tonight why little bedford because god has called a people god has ordained a people to receive the message of the hour and to be impregnated by the word of god and to bring it into full manifestation why me i don't think i can make it don't worry mary you ain't got a choice there's only one place that son could be born that's in bethlehem why because i chose bethlehem and i'll make sure to let you get there oh you wonder if you don't worry god has predestinated you he's elected you you are now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus oh my so much so the blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin oh you can't miss it you can't fail you can't fall you've been predestinated to make it thou art least among the princes of judah but out of these shall come a governor that shall rule my people the prophet of god would say in this little town this little stable city stable down on the side of the bluff was a cave back in the bluff and out of there came forth through its little doors the prince of peace born in a stable and a little box of straw sitting somewhere manure piled up in the barns and so forth but out of there came the great prince the seed of the woman out of there came the savior of the world out of there came jehovah himself in the form of a man came out of that little humble stable in bethlehem not in some king's palace born in royalty but he came from that humble place to a manure stack down in there and was wrapped in swaddling cloth you asked the question why me because out of thee why me because out of thee god is wanting to manifest his word why me abraham could ask the same question here in genesis chapter 12 you find that that god called abraham and god made an unconditional covenant with abraham and he said abraham i want you to look at the sand of the sea can you number it now i want you to look at the stars in the heavens and he said so shall thy seed be god had made an unconditional covenant with abraham abraham could have asked the question why me because it was god's choosing god chose abraham and made an unconditional covenant with abraham and told him that i will make your seed as the sand of the sea and as the stars of the heavens so shall thy seed be oh my i tell you what it seemed like it was a cakewalk now abraham could have thought well i got this almighty god has come down and and made an unconditional covenant with me so it just seems like now that i got it on easy street no no abraham didn't quite work like that the journey got hard for abraham it got real tough for him and it and it even it even got down to a place where abraham would say how lord how can i be a father of nations seeing that i go childless and he had already made a mistake once or twice even more because he was trying in himself to bring forth a promise but but in abraham's ability he had nothing in himself that he could bring forth the promise but always abraham could say lord i know you made the promise the journey wasn't easy for abraham i don't know about some of you but maybe the journey hasn't been easy for you and abraham got down to that place where they were getting old in age and and they were getting discouraged and now here here a little unrecognized insignificant sarah now her womb has dried up and the milk veins have dried up in here abraham is seeing all how can i even bring forth this promised son oh but i love god's word because god came down god came down that great melchizedek come down to confirm his promise and he came walking out there on the planes of memory and there abraham stood in the door and he recognized it was the lord but you know when melchizedek came who was he looking for he walked up to the tent door he wasn't looking for abraham he said where is thy wife sarah see god had come down and made a visitation to abraham who he made an unconditional promise with and he said look i have come down he said where is your where is your wife sarah she said she's in the tent and he said according to the time of life you shall have a son by your wife sarah or even sarah in her own self said who me have pleasure with my lord even in the doubt in sarah's own mind even in her own ability she knew within herself oh how could i bring forth a promised son in my condition oh god is speaking to somebody tonight maybe you feel like you're past the time you're past the season but god has come down to confirm his covenant and said out of these terror out of you my bride according to the time of life you shall bring forth the promised word that i have given to you oh hallelujah and sarah she seemed maybe a little unrecognized she seemed unsignificant but that word that promised word that unconditional covenant started to have an effect it started to have a change on sarah's body oh i want to tell you a bride of jesus christ this message is having an effect on you it is changing your very body you it might not look like it but i tell you just keep holding on keep holding on to every promised word that god has given you because one step by one step in a moment in a twinkling of an eye one day saints of god we're going to be changed once and for all oh glory to god why because out of thee why me yes the journey looks tough the journey looks hard but it might look impossible but first peter 2 9 would read like this but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light oh my does that identify somebody which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which hath not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy something that was unidentified god has chosen to identify himself by it is there somebody here that could say you know what little old insignificant me i was unidentified but god chose me to identify his love his grace his mercy oh my just as we just break now into the inspiration maybe of what's really on our heart here as i started to think upon these lines of something that is unidentified and maybe something that's unrecognized you know you might drive along the road or you might go out to some places on the the east coast and maybe go into the carolinas and and the virginias and places like that and you might see a historical marker and you know there the historical marker is there because it's marking a place of some type of significant event so maybe a place that would seem unrecognized or would seem insignificant but as you would pull up there you would start to read this historical marker and you'd realize that some famous battle or some civil war battle or something that took in place right upon these grounds and you can maybe just start to in your mind to think my uh this calvary must have come over this region and something that seemed insignificant something that was unrecognized is now has something that's identifying that place a historical marker is letting you know that something of significance happened in this place and as i thought about these things i went in my mind and i was there standing on the the the coast in the countryside there in my mind there in san diego and am i if you were to stand there close to the ocean and the the waves would start to to wash in there and and you would look off of the cliffsides and and maybe it'll be 150 200 feet uh dropping down to the shore and and the ground would just kind of roll over and and maybe roll down and you could walk down and there's the the coastal cypress and the cedar trees and and this land it's just it's just beautiful but maybe compared to the vast countryside and the vast coastal lands and and all over the world this little this little portion of land in san diego would just maybe seem so insignificant it would be so unrecognized if you were to maybe go back in time and you were to stand there maybe some two uh 300 years ago but now if you were to go and you were to stand in that same spot there in rose crane san diego and you'd look upon that same landscape now it's it's no longer unmarked but it's marked by cross after cross and thousands upon thousands of cross of men who laid down their lives in combat and for freedom and you could just look one after another and hear this countryside that once was unrecognized it seemed insignificant but now it's marked by thousands upon thousands of graves of men who laid down their lives on the sacrifice of freedom and oh you could just go into the history and you could read about this young man who was there and got a medal of honor and he was in battle only 20 years old and a grenade came over into the camp and he jumped upon that grenade and he he won a medal of honor because he preserved so 15 or 20 more lives of his comrade because of self-sacrifice and here on this landscape which was unrecognized and insignificant are over a hundred thousand graves of men and women that have gave their life something that was unrecognized something that was insignificant but now it's made significant it's now identified because there's lives after lives that have been laid down and now each cross that is laying there thousands upon thousands now mark a a a hillside that was once unidentified now it's become identified and i can't help in my heart to think states there was once a hill that was unidentified it wasn't marked it seemed insignificant nobody would have thought anything about that hill and here the lord of glory was there in the garden of gethsemane with the weight of the world upon his shoulders and he was in agony he was crying sweats of blood that were crying down his face our lord wouldn't say why me because he knew who he was but he would say oh god if possible but lord nevertheless my will but thy there may be a hill that no one would have ever remembered no one would have ever thought twice about they led the lord of glory up there and on that hill called gilgatha they nailed our lord and our savior the most precious gift that was ever given to mankind hung there on that cross for your sin for my sin he was bruised he was beaten and there on that cross your sins was nailed there and there became the greatest historical marker that the world has ever known the cross of calvary that our lord jesus christ spread forth his arms and said it is finished oh hallelujah it was the chosen place a hill that was insignificant that was unrecognized god had chose to fulfill his word and forgive mankind for their sins i think of job job went through such great trial such great agony and there little did job know that satan had made his way around to the lord and said where have you been up to say i've just been going to and fro seeking who i may devour and god said have you considered my servant job well yeah i put a little hedge around them you put a little hedge around to protect them how can i get at them you put a little hedge around them all right i'll take it away job not even realizing maybe not even privy to what was starting to happen to him now all of a sudden his life starts to unravel his life starts to fall apart he starts to lose all of his lively stock he starts to lose all of his financial gain everything that he's built up all of his life savings everything that he's worked so hard for it seems like everything's been taken away from him oh my i wonder if somebody's ever gone through that you worked so hard you saved all your money and something comes your way and you're asking yourself why me lord why am i going through this it just seems like i can't make ends meet and just one thing after another after another where it came down to the place and now that job and his seven children now even they had been slain under under a winds and under the building when they were gathered and now job is on the ash heap job is so discouraged job might be asking the question why me why me lord why am i going through this he was so discouraged he would start to even curse the day that he was born oh just blotted out from the history books why why would why would i even even come into this world if this was going to be the agony if this was going to be the pain if this was going to be the suffering if this is what i was going to have to go through why would i even be born why me lord if there's a question upon your heart there's an answer if in your heart you're wondering why you're going through the things that you're going through and here even joe you think job didn't have any questions oh my look i'm sure the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind didn't start in ladiesea chardon in the garden of eden started there with eve straight way back there before time even began and no doubt job is on the ashy he's going through this mind battle i wonder why even me lord what did i do and they're oh you're a secret sinner joe this is why you're going through all these things but little little did job know that god had chosen job god had put an attribute god had put a revelation in job hallelujah there was something inside of job that in the midst of the trial in the midst of the anguish in the midst of the agony there was going to come forth a revelation that would come forth out of job's mouth and he would say i know my redeemer liveth and in the last days he'll stand upon the earth and though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i shall see god oh hallelujah was in that trial it was in that time it was in that questioning that this great revelation broke to that prophet job and he spoke those notable words and you know it's from that revelation of job that abraham he would buy a parcel of land for sarah abraham would be buried there isaac would be buried there and jacob would go down into egypt and he said look i tell you what children there ain't no resurrection down here in egypt oh but up there in that promised land i'm telling you once was insignificant it was was unmarked but god had called our father abraham and he said get you out of that sick country that you're in and i'm going to show you forth a country that i'm going to give to you and once there was a land that was unrecognized it seemed insignificant but god had given them a divine promise that it was the promised land and there jacob's down there and he just said look boys take my bones out of here there ain't no resurrection in egypt the resurrection's in palestine take my bones with you joseph when he would die and the children of israel he'd tell her hey don't leave my bones down here because all of them prophets they had knew the word that had been spoken by job that i shall stand in my flesh and i shall see my redeemer there knew there was coming forth the first fruits of the resurrection and though our lord jesus christ hung there on calvary i'm so glad that's not the end of the story because there was some unrecognized insignificant tomb that they just so happened to lay our lord in some insignificant unmarked stone was rolled in front of it oh hallelujah but on the third day the stone was rolled away and that insignificant unrecognized tomb with some unrecognized stone became the greatest recognized tomb that has ever been on the face of the world because out of that tomb came i resurrected lord jesus christ and with him all of those saints of old and the first fruits of the resurrection they came up with him why me job because you're going to bring forth a revelation and a prophecy and by that everyone after you is going to know bury me here because i know that i shall see my redeemer and i want to tell you tonight friends if you have not been buried in jesus christ there's only one place for you to go tonight is to be buried in jesus christ and in the word the greatest gift that has ever been given to man don't bury me and lady will see you don't bury me in the traditions of man don't bury me in creeks and dogs don't bury me with some message of theology and fanaticism bury me in the lord jesus christ and his word and if you bury me in there i know i'll come up in the resurrection oh hallelujah glory hallelujah oh my if the musicians would come oh praise his wonderful name hallelujah oh my oh my there was a room it was unrecognized it was insignificant but the lord told those disciples go tarry ye in jerusalem go into that upper room and tarry there until you be endued with power from on high and no they waited there for the promise and all of a sudden there came a rushing mighty wind that swept into the pillar into the room and like tons of fire started to break up and settle down upon the people just an unrecognized insignificant room maybe you've asked the question in your heart why me maybe you felt that way so many times now we find out why little bethlehem paragraph 69 now we find out this little stable it was there that the first noel was ever saying on earth let's all stand [Music] and it was saying by angels think of it the first noel sung up there with caiaphas not down at some great fine church where a wonderful pastor was but at a stable in bethlehem the least among all of them but the first noel was saying by angelic beings in that little city of bethlehem see what i mean no matter how poor you are how little or insignificant you might be god can use you if you'll just let him do so god wants you now i want to end right here because it's the christmas season and many times we reach out to one another one's in our family and we say what can i get you for christmas [Music] you know and it can be a trying time you know it can be a puzzle you could just wonder what in the world can i get them but you know when you finally when you finally get a good answer and it seems like yeah that's nice you know you're excited right because you're like you know what i'd like to get that for him you know we just read a quote where forgive me for might sound sacrilegious but that's like god's wish list he says if you'll just let him do it god wants you oh they asked the question like i said it might sound sacrilegious but what do you want for christmas you know the only thing god wants is you and maybe you haven't surrendered your heart and here this christmas season you've been saying i want this and i want that and hear the lord of glory [Music] who took an unrecognized hill and placed the greatest landmark the world has ever seen by the cross of calvary and he gave his life that self-sacrifice that you could be set free and delivered and he stands here tonight telling you all i want is you you can take the whole world everything else could go but i want your heart i wonder if there's somebody here with every head bowed maybe it would be this christmas season 2021 that you would say you know what i'm ready now to give my heart to god i know it's a wednesday night i know it's maybe a little bit different but don't be ashamed with every head bow is there somebody that would want to surrender to the call and you'd want to lift their hand up and say lord i want to give you my heart i want to surrender to you god bless you don't be ashamed this is what it's all about he gave the greatest gift he could ever be give and all he's asking is that you surrender your heart to him and he wants to give you joy he wants to give you peace he wants to give you a long suffering and patience and godliness and temperance all the benefits just keep going on and on god bless you anybody else just want to lift your hand to god and say lord forgive me for my sins every head bowed there's many hands that have gone up all around let's just all pray to the lord heavenly father how we love you and thank you for your word lord maybe just a little chopped up broken sermon lord but many times we ask the question why me but to thank god you you wanted to take a people and identify yourself with them and through them or just an insignificant sinner like myself lord who should have died and should have been left out in the cold lord you you saw fit lord to call me and to identify yourself with me lord i just want to tell you i thank you so much lord thank you for calvary or thank you for the gift of your only begotten son lord oh god we take him for granted so often but now lord as a group as a congregation lord we're lifting our hands to you and say lord i want to surrender my life to you here you said that all you want is us lord and we're here to say lord we love you all we want is you lord we surrender our plans we surrender our ambitions we surrender all of our hopes and all of our dreams lord we just say we want you

privilege it is to come to you this evening lord god we realize father that it's no longer just playing church it's no longer just coming in and parking our bodies and you've called us to partake of
