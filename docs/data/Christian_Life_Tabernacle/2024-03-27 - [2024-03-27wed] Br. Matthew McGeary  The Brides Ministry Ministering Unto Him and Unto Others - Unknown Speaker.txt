our fellowship here brothers and sisters just rolling ac across my heart of of things that things that I wanted to just see um in people's lives and uh so this just this the message of this song just really spoke and so I just wanted to uh have this song before we began to minister and I'm looking for the very uh words and message of this song just to start coming forth and each one of our lives and seeing the manifestation of God bringing forth deliverance and healing and manifestations and Revival in our homes and in our families in our lives as we're being caught away and coming into a union with him and uh soon and very soon the change of our bodies so I pray this is a blessing [Music] I speak the name of Jesus over you in your hurting in your sorrow I will ask my God to move I

needed Deliverance Lord and the penalty of our sin was death you looked upon us in our time of need Lord and you were beaten and you were bruised Lord you were chastised and you were mocked and they put a a crown of thorns upon your head and you didn't have to do it but you look down and saw love Lord for your people that we would need a savior and we would need a deliver lord and there would be no hope for Humanity if you didn't come be one of us Lord as the scripture would say you became poverty that we could become rich Lord oh we thank you Father that we could come and we can be identified with the sacrifice and we can be washed by your blood and that the life that was in the blood could come back upon the believer and atone for our sins and we could stand before you tonight justify as though we never did it in the first place what a confidence we have what a boldness we have to be able to approach you now Lord and ask that you would move on behalf of these needs Lord just the Believers and our loved ones that we were thinking of Lord we want the situation to change father Lord we need deliverance we need healing in the body Lord there's ones that aren't with us prodical Sons and Daughters Lord but we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever so father we're agreeing together to see the supernatural to speak the word to speak words of life and deliverance and healing and to see those come back amongst us Lord now father We Just Surrender ourselves to you may you come and break the bread of life for your people as only you can we love you Lord we pray these things now in your most wonderful name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen if you have your Bibles let just turn in John chapter 14 amen just such a wonderful presence here amongst us it's always good to be gathered together uh with the Believers amen John uh chapter 14 and uh Verse 18 amen it says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you we know that this is a scripture that has been fulfilled in the hour uh that we are now living Christ and the bride becoming one an invisible Union if you'll turn to John chapter 20 we'd like to read from there as well there might not be no natural water in this building but I'm not so much interested in those things of the natural but the spiritual and his his presence is here he's moving amongst us I'm so thankful for that in John uh chapter 20 we're just going to read a few verses here 21- 23 then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so I even so send I you just notice that now as the father sent him he's going to send you the same way so peace be unto you as the father hath sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye retain they are retained amen we just pray a blessing on the word you may be seated as the f as my father has sent me even so I send you and then he goes on to say receive ye the Holy Ghost and I just want to bring your attention to a portion of scripture in Luke uh chap 4 and verse 18 now as Jesus is now coming to fulfill his ministry he comes into the temple and there's a book that is handed unto him and he's going going to start take the book and he's now SP to declare he's going to turn into the word he's going to find his identification he's going to find his ministry in the word he's going to open it and he's going to say the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me notice that he hath sent me so the same way come on now the same way the father sent him he said I'm going to send you and now he's making a DEC ation here he's taking the book he's opening up the book and he's saying the spirit of the Lord is upon me so if the spirit of the Lord was upon him the spirit of the Lord is going to be upon you because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind I want to say his ministry has not stopped he's still doing the same thing today he's still preaching the word he's still healing he that has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach to Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to set Liberty to them that are bruised I wasn't going to try to start this fast but it just happens to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him you know your your attention kind of catches that ER where he he takes the book he opens the book and now he's declaring the manifestation of the word telling everybody look this day this scripture is fulfilled and then he closed the book I I'm so glad that the same one has come again but not with a closed book come on but he's come with an open book he's come revealing the seals and the Mysteries and just wanting to bring your attention he said the same way he sent me it's the same way I send you so I just been feeding on the Easter seal the prophet of God would say his uh Messianic anointed ones believe that I believe he's referring to he's the same yesterday today and forever he goes what is the Messiah what is the messiah messiah is Anointed one and now if he was the Messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of God to be the Redeemer and the anointed one and God raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day it's already raised with am in the resurrection because these two are one the resurrection we are now in the resurrection we are setting with him in the resurrection but only those who have life oh I wonder do you have life tonight if you don't have life I say come to the Fountain oh it's flowing rich and free that you can be born again that you can be delivered that you don't have to be stooped in darkness and death and all these things but you can have that same Life coming to you amen yes so now just just moving to build a thought here notice how he says his bride is the anointed one for this day if he was the anointed one of that day to fulfill the scripture he now has anointed ones for this day to fulfill the scripture now I want to just labor on this for a little bit uh tonight and uh the prophet of God would say he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride the work which he left for this specific time catch what the prophet is saying that when he came here first time in his Earthly Ministry there was things he did not fulfill then but now there are things that have been left for this specific time that he's now fulfilling through the bride that he had a Ministry when he first came and he has a Ministry now that he is now fulfilling through the bride of Christ I'd like to speak to you a little bit on the bride's Ministry and maybe as a subject ministering unto him and unto others and and we could you know something that just deeply moved upon my heart over the last couple weeks was in that ministering to him and un to others just just think of the love of God there loving him and loving others because without the love of God it profiteth us nothing so uh just building a thought here and launching out the prophet of God would say in proof of his resurrection he'd say and man in his own mental way of thinking is wrong to begin with he is an alien from God he is cut off without hope without god without mercy and the only thing that he can do is come and accept Christ and then the Holy Spirit comes in and the that was in Christ is in you Jesus said the father that sent me is with me oh my what a declaration what a word the father that sent me come with me listen and as the father sent me so do I send you he don't only send you but he goes with you that makes me happy he didn't just say hey there's a big army out there and there's ladyo and it's just darkness all around I'm just going to go on out there and see if you can pass the test he said no I'm sending you out there but I'm not only sending you but I'm going with you I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world all that was in God was poured out into Christ and all that was in Christ was emptied out into the believer the church God is with you well maybe somebody here feels you feel a little bit lonely you feel like you're fighting all alone and you feel like you're you you just nobody's there to help you I want to tell you you're not alone tonight the same one that called you the same one that sent you the same one is with you yes lo I am with thee always even to the end of the world that's the Declaration of God's word that's what the Bible says that's what I believe oh what a declaration what a declaration just think in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us but who hath declared him the only begotten of the father he has declared him and if he declared him in his first Ministry there is a bride now upon the face of the earth that is declaring that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever look no no man has seen God at any time but as Christ Jesus has declared him he is now living in a many membered body bride of Jesus Christ with a Ministry fulfilling those scriptures which was left for the end time for you to fulfill and now that Ministry is working through you come on you might as well accept it you take ownership tonight you're not here to fulfill a a natural career you have a spiritual career you're here for a purpose you're an attribute of God that he is expressed in the end time that you would fulfill the word of God the prophet of God said if you are born of him and you're filled of him and then he gives this example of like a tree if you take the life out of an apple tree and you put it into a pear tree and he's starting to say look if you've been born again and filled with the Holy Spirit then the same life that was in Jesus Christ is now in you if the life of Beethoven is in you prove it you'll find out real quick I don't have the life of Beethoven in me I can't think like them I can't play like them I I I couldn't even act like them but if the life was in me now I would be able to sit down and demonstrate to you that the same life that was in Beethoven is in me and then my actions and my Works would demonstrate to you that I know what I'm talking about I wish I could start naming things that he you know whatever composed and all that and and start to play all these Symphonies and things and and then you would sit around like my I mean maybe this is Beethoven reincarnated can you hear how he's hitting that just right he's he's hitting every note I want to say this bride of Christ is going to hit every note you might not feel like your life is hitting every note you might not feel like your life is in harmony but I want to say there's a prophetic word that has been spoken out over your life you might not be hitting all the notes right now but in God's economy you're going to hit every right note because he's the great composer he has it all in his control and he elected you and he predestinated you that you would come into the image of perfection in the hour that we are now living that this word would take on flesh and the bride of Christ would be the very Ministry the same Ministry that was on the earth in his first coming is now here once again during his second coming oh that makes me happy yes sir then all of our actions if he declared him then all of our actions should declare him all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the believer amen now I like this scripture here in John 1:12 it says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name now just notice that saying there power to become so then all of the potential is laying there the prophet of God as we've gone through God's transforming power said God put the seed in there with the potential that it would be what he said it would be names that are written on the Lamb's Book of Life all of the potential is there the power to become so then when you're looking at the seed maybe it's not that big great apple tree with its with with it branches spreading out there and providing shelter and fruit and all this but in that seed there is the power to become right so I don't know where you're at in the stage of the journey but I want to say my sheep hear my voice and if God has given you an ear to hear what the spirit is saying to the church Hallelujah then there is power for you to become what he has spoken of you oh nothing can stop it you might as well start rejoicing I mean you you might as well be like a somebody at the starting line in a race and just tell everybody else hey sorry about it sorry about it I'm going to win this thing all the demons are trying to say I'm bigger I'm stronger I've seen so many like you before but you don't understand I got power to become I got power to finish this race I got power to manifest what he spoke of me not in myself but he's the one that spoke it right right let that seed get in the right atmosphere ain't nothing here to stop it you can pour a foundation and you just let the atmosphere just get right and all of a sudden that little seed will say hey I'm watch out I'm coming up you can bury a little Lily Pond thing way down there in the muck and mire way down there where it just seems darkness and filth and no good thing could come out of there but let the atmosphere just get right let the light start calling say come unto me come unto me all ye who for a heavy laden and I will give you rest oh he give you an ear to hear the word if you say Lord I believe you Lord I believe you and all a sudden something's being germinated something's coming to life something's springing forth because there's power in that seed to become what God said it would be the seed has power in itself my the power of transformation power to become exal ly what the word said it would be now I know when you listen to the prophet and he speaks the words concerning the bride something in your heart says amen amen I believe it Lord I believe that you'll have a bride without spot without wrinkle a virtuous bride that can do all things that you shall do the Greater Works well go ahead and start pointing to yourself he's talking about me like the boy in the here you know looking him like man what is that thing over there and then finally he said Mama that's me you have to look into the pages of the Bible and look into the message you got to say mama that's me he's talking about me when you're on that the ra ready to start that race and maybe before they start the race look now the the one that's going to finish is going to be the bride without spot or wrinkle he's talking about me they have eternal life they've always had Eternal hey he's talking about me yes there's no way for them to miss it they were predestinated before the foundation of the world they will ordained to Good Works they shall do the Greater Works hey you hear that he's talking about me but you know the devil's always right there wanting to point to everything else there's somebody else go there oh you made a last race you tripped up you fell you don't have the strength you you've tried over and over and over well who you listen listening to this tonight let's not listen to what the devil's saying not let's not listen to what the pastors is saying but let's listen to what the Lord is saying look light brings Life Light brings life and then if there's power to become the light of this message of the hour will bring forth the life that's in the seed you got to feed on it you got to lay in the presence of the sun if you feel like you're faltering and you're not uhh uh becoming fruitful like you would want to see the message of the hour be in your life you got to you got to make sure you've repented that you've been baptized that you're believing for the holy ghost that you're feeding on the word of God and you're saying like Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word Lord I want to manifest these things I want to see this word in manifestation in my life because as we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all of our sins so just uh laboring to lay a foundation brother Brandon would say this and Jesus keeps all of his appointments he would say that's the way God has brought his church from justification and sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit and now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word that Ministry in the church will have to be just exactly like his just like this when my shadow here of my hand if I never seen my hand seen the shadow it kind of gets pale and gets away but as it gets closer and closer the negative and the positive are coming together until they both become the same thing now he's using a a a easy example to show exactly what is happening with you and the Capstone he's using an example to show exactly what's happening between you and the Capstone that you and the Capstone are coming so close together that you are becoming the same thing now that might sound like tall orders I'm sorry about it but it's just what he said you were and he said I've given you power to become what I've spoken and now this bride is coming into a union with this revealed word of the hour exactly when the church and the word has to be one like Jesus and God was one just exactly God was in Christ Reckless I reconciling the world to himself and so will Christ have to be in the church the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled wow well everybody else might get excited about who's who's uh who's the next big home run hitter or or the the next show coming to town but my that makes me excited you catching that now and so will Christ have to be in the church the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled so Christ in you is making everything fulfilled for the hour that we're now living now are you waking up with this in your mind is this your attitude is this your approach is this your ident is this your spiritual career well you when you wake up I got a job to do I I have to be the anointed of the word to make everything for fill for the hour that I'm now living in you want to try to get somebody off track if if somebody's trying to be the the biggest uh bodyb Builder Fitness guy there ever was well if you try to get him on track well hey eat this eat that no I can't do that you get some of them Health nuts out there boy you can't you can't they won't eat nothing I'm on a peas and seaweed diet what you can't I can only eatat things that are green really yeah man no why didn't you try that no you can't get them off track well man if people can be so on track on the things in the natural you you get these these athletes and things man their their diet is so dialed in they know every gram and every ounce and and they have dieticians and and and they got people that babysit them and they flying chefs to cook their meal and they know it's like a machine man they know every little gram of every little thing that they're putting into that body because they want to get the best results out of their investment I mean think about it some of these guys are signing now 200 million $500 million contracts to play a game amazing I think that's amazing and the whole world looks at that say my wouldn't that be something you start doing the math on side with one time we did it I think some guy gets paid like it's something crazy I like $100,000 each game he plays and you boil it down he gets $50,000 in a bat he goes up there and swings a stick three times thank you for your service here's $50,000 but if you watch their regiment and their routine of what it took to get to that place right the amount of discipline and everything that they put into that and I wonder what about us who God has ordained and predestinated here to fulfill all the scripture that has been left for the bride to fulfill do we wake up or are we just being so easily deterred look at this and look at that and watch this and and some guy wink at you this way or that way and you're so moved and oh he likes me and so you're you're doing all your little post back to him and getting the right filters and everything and puckering up your lips because you you want him to like you is that what's is that what you is that what life is about is is that what what you're living for no you're living to be pleasing un and that's what I want to preach to you a little bit tonight is about ministering unto him because before we can minister to others we must be able to minister unto him you got to be in a relationship with him you got to be in a Oneness with him it got to be husband and wife living together bringing forth fruit of the word because then and only then when you come into that Union then can can you begin to minister to others but until that time it's kind of like hearsay like that story one time when I believe the you know the boy was out there waving the flag and he come home I believe it was the queen and uh he got back oh honey did you see the uh did you see the queen yeah I saw what's wrong that's that's why we went there is so that you can see the parade and you could see the queen why are you crying he's like I saw the queen well what's wrong the queen didn't see me I don't want to just say I see the message I want to know the message sees me I see you son I see you in my word you are exactly what I was talking about yes you are you are my very attribute that I ordained to be in the evening time that that I want to have fellowship and communion with you you're the one that I I want in Tabernacle to be the one that I carry out the last day Ministry [Music] me yes you well I'm sorry but I I got to finish my Netflix series okay I'll wait I'll wait I got a career I I got to go to school I got I got a job sorry Lord I I you know what I I'm not paying I'm not getting the bills quite paid I'm gonna I'm gonna have to work on Sundays now as long as I come to church Sunday morning well that's if that's your desire that's okay I'll wait you imagine you think these athletes that are hey um would you like to sign a um a 10-year contract for $1 billion now I think I'll wait I'm gonna I'm going to go finish this or that no you better take that contract while it's on the table you got to say let me think about it and walk out and bust your ankle Andy that might sound funny in the natural but what about tonight you're being offered eternal life God speaking to your heart will you respond are you going to put it off well I kind of got some Wild Oats that I wanted to kind of feel I kind of I'm kind of liking this person or that person or I kind of you know I'm I'm just comfortable right now I'm not ready to surrender everything I'm not quite ready to minister on I'm not quite ready to love him like that oh we need to come to a place church we we're ready to lay it all I say Lord forgive me I've been selfish I've been thinking about myself I haven't been looking on the needs of others all I've been interested is what you could do for me I've really never been interested in what I could do for you Lord forgive me I I've just been piggybacking I've just been a squatter on your grace I've just been taken advantage of you oh a lot of people do it a lot of people take advantage of our savior there's promises laying in the word there's some people that that that pay ties and do they don't even go to church they just pay ties because they know if they do it there's a blessing in it and then there's ones of us that sit right here in the house of God and we don't even pay 10% we we pay our bills first and then we get down the line and then we we give them an IOU well it's a new year I mean Lord forgive me for last year that ain't no way to live ain't no way to live but when you're in a union with him and you can come to him in reverence and sincerity say Lord I love you thank you for Calvary thank you for what you're doing Lord what can I do for you now you're starting to minister unto him just trying to progress here a little bit just to still laying this Foundation here as the prophet would say and question and answers on the seals would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour see the bride of Christ sure she consists of Apostles and Prophets and teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry a great ministry the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble amen there it is this ministry of this hour in the bride of Christ it will be so humble not some big public display not some big great denominational move but what did he say in this third poll he said I will meet you in there th this is an invisible Union where Christ and the bride are becoming one they're becoming the same thing and this ministry will be so humble that it would be veiled in a people like this gathered together in Bedford Texas on a Wednesday night not some big something fantastic out there but but in the simple common people that love this message and believe it with all of their heart that is where this ministry is being manifested is in each one of you and now the question is is do you want that Ministry to come to its fullness in your life not parttime not just on Sunday or Wednesday but every hour yes of every day your life is a Ministry unto him and unto others and it would be so humble and I love how the prophet of God would start see sir that's what's going on and certainly it's the message of the hour the bride of Christ sure it consists of Apostles and Prophets and teachers evangelists and pastors is right that's the bride of Christ she's got a great ministry the great ministry of the hour I love how the prophet of God starts to tap into Ephesians 4 and he's starting to talk about the five-fold ministry and and pastors and teachers and evangels what are those given for it's for the edifying and the perfecting of the saints that we would come into that unity and that Harmony he would go on to say speaking the truth and love oh if we're going to have a Ministry I say there's a a lot of people out there that speak truth but they lack love a lot of people out there uh preaching the message of the hour and some of them do it like a boast they're they're boasting but I just love how this message was brought as the father sent me so I send you you see the reverence you see the humility you say you see how it was brought in love oh but don't don't mistake that that reverence and humility for weakness cuz that was the greatest Force this world had ever seen is the love of God and that's what we want to come into is that love yes that love to where we're coming into a Unity with with Christ which is love like the scripture would say in 1 John 4:16 he would say and we know and we have known and believed that the love of God ha to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him there's the secret there's the humility there's the ministry it's dwelling in love love since when did we ever get to where all of our doctrines and all of our know how is our boast and we've left we've left off the very life the very character of the message in which way it was brought where we got to lie we got to correct everybody else we got to show everybody else where they're wrong and this church over here and that church over there and well you know this preacher preached that so I'm going to preach this to bring them into B are you kidding me there's one voice to this age and you will be the final voice to this age under yes sir that voice but if you ain't under that voice it's just a bunch of voices and it's just a bunch of conf conf usion right we might as just go back to the Tower of Babel he said he said he said but he said he said he said we want to come to a place where we're speaking the truth in love as a prophet of God would say if you dwell in love you dwell in God for God is love they that dwell in God dwell in love see and love has no hatred love is not jealous love is not puffed up love did not beh misbehave itself love is always gentle sweet forgiving kind oh now we're learning how to speak the truth in Love no matter how bitter the others is Love Remains itself love is the ultimate of Grace love is God's ultimately for us after all other gifts and things has vanished our prophecies our tongues our interpretations all we've ever done and what more When Love Comes in it's the ultimate it's above all it because all of others will fail it's the Supreme Court's decision Hallelujah I like that I like the Supreme Court's decision his Supreme oh turn the picture to the right who is that up there it's the Supreme judge decision yes sir Hallelujah Justified who me who says it's the Supreme judge's decision what is the decision what produced that decision love love as the scripture would say in Ephesian this great love wherein he has loved us oh my have we have have we become so puffed up so educated and so Mesi that we don't have no love just because another group doesn't believe it the way we do they're they're off just because oh my friends if we ever get to that place we've missed it we've totally missed it remember the story about the prophet one day is he was going into the diner and he slipped in there and he saw the woman carrying on with that police officer and he thought my Lord how can you tolerate this I mean this such filth everywhere why don't you just wipe it off the face of the Earth and he kind of felt that feeling come by and he thought maybe I just kind of step off here for a moment and all of a sudden he seen that Vision Break Forth and he saw like a bumper of blood going around the world and he saw his sins coming up and and before it could reach Heaven's throne there was a bumper of blood that was protecting it from ever reaching to the throne and he said and then I seen a little book there I kind of climbed up and I saw a little book there that said uh HH brother brandom and it said I noticed it was all of my sins in there and there he was standing there he was bleeding and he was bloody and he was he was gasping for air and he he looked at that book and he looked at the Lord he said Lord I'm sorry I did that to you will you forgive me and he stuck his hand into his side and he pulled his hand out and he wrote on there pardoned and he threw it in God's sea of forgetfulness and then he said I forgave you and you want to condemn then he said oh I I seen where I was right then it changed my attitude see it brought brought them back into the right channel you got to stay in the right channel right that what the prophet has said you have all the potentials but if you got to stay in the right channel you got to stay in the channel of the word you got to stay under the leading of the holy spirit because it can be so easy for you to get out of your place where all of a sudden you're looking at something and you're judging it and in you wanting to judge it God's wanting to bring Grace and now that the prophet was channeled right he walks in there and walks up where is the love of God how many of you ever walked up to a stranger and wanted to tell them God loves you see something compelled him to do it there was Christ was there to say look you you can't look at him that way let me get you channeled right and then now in the right channel he walks in there says excuse me ma'am can I sit down oh well now that seat's t oh I understand I I I'm not I just I wanted to share something with you and he begins to tell her I was over there judging you but but God come down and has shown Grace and he led her to the Lord there's the ministry he would be so humble that it could be in a restaurant diner he would be so humble that it would be on the job force or it' be in your school it would be in the cafeteria it'd be at a gas it would be be somewhere where you're not walking around with judgment but you're walking around in love in compassion looking out oh have you ever just walked along and seen the people and something in your eyes say oh God if they could only know you if they could only know what you did for me you could do for them you see people in their conditions this lady OA has totally taken advantage of mankind there's kids and children that are born into the just most horrible situations broken homes and abuses and and all kinds of things and and and they didn't even have a chance to start and then we'll look at somebody say look at that crazy nut oh my you think you live looked any different to him you you think you looked any better to him you ain't no different you ain't no different than the drunker you ain't no different than the prostit there's only one thing that made the difference between you and somebody that doesn't come to the knowledge of him is the grace of God oh this great love wherein he loved us when you're channeled right and now you're walking in love now you can begin to minister speaking the truth in love when love is projected what happens Sovereign Grace takes over when he came into the restaurant what was he first doing projecting judgment that's right but When Love Was projected yes sir Sovereign Grace took over you are missg Grace you are the love of God expressed to a dying generation where are people going to find it I love this story we had some fellowship on this story here about a week ago of that brother brandom going hunting with bertke and he's up there on that hunt and and and all of a sudden they're taking a little break there I think they're eating some sandwiches or something and Bert pulls out that little deer call that's going to imitate a baby deer to call a mommy out from hiding that he could shoot it and brother bandam looks at Bert says oh Bert you wouldn't do that he said all with that kind of those lizard eyes and gave him that little grin he's like oh no and he begin to blow on that thing and make that call for a mother deer and all of a sudden just in no time I I from what I understand those deers during during a hunting season they they just hunker down they don't come out especially in the daytime they're like Houdini they they'll they'll get away and escape and hide down and you you hardly ever find them except maybe in the early hours of the day and maybe late at night when they start to move around but here he starts to make this call and up Comes This Mother Dear standing out there and he takes up his gun he begins to aim it at the deer and brother Brand's over there going oh Bert don't do it don't do it he said he was a dead shot he'd blow that mother deer's loyal Heart Plum out of it and he said he he got zeroed in he kind of uh hunkered down there waiting for the shot and he kind of waited there and finally looked up and all of a sudden he saw the rifle going like this all over he threw it down and said brother R lead me to that Jesus of yours what was it he saw love being projected oh it moves my heart if if if love of a natural Mother Dear being projected for its Fawn or for its D or if that if that was enough to convert a man I thought about that story I would have thought it would have been the concerning of the thoughts I thought it would have been brother brandom telling him well bir the way you're this way and that way and and it would have been water bapt it would have been this and that but all it took is him seeing the love of a mother projected something that wasn't fake something that was real standing up in the face of danger saying I love you that was love being projected and Sovereign Grace took over and directed that man to the Lord Jesus Christ if that mother dear could minister to him how much more should our lives be being ministered to those that are around us prophet of God says in God's provided place of worship he says now Jesus himself said at that day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ himself the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals and go right on into to the Perfection of the son of man when husband and wife will be the SE same selfers God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will be both the same they are one now I I I'm thankful to be living in this hour I hope these things aren't becoming so familiar that we can't even rejoice in them and and it's become uh just these four walls and the ministry of the message is just listening to tapes and hanging out with people that recognize Malachi 45 you're missing it all you're missing it all it's Way Beyond Creeds and and dogmas and doctrines there is something in the Supernatural realm and in heaven places that is taking place where things are breaking so fast out there where God is coming into a union with a bride and that he is fulfilling his word that he has left for this bride to do for this specific work it's happening young people it's time you might be so uh focused on school you might be so focused on boys or you might be so focused on this it's time this is bride time yes this is Eagle time this is Rapture time put him first yes he'll take care of all those other things I understand we're in the world but we're not of the world if you I understand we want jobs and we want careers but don't let those things govern your life don't let them rule you don't let them tell you where to live and where to go don't do that you'll miss it you let the Holy Spirit lead you let the holy spirit guide you yes I I would rather you know as brother Brandon would say many times to minister I'd rather be under a bridge uh uh drinking Branch water soda crackers and trespassing the word of the Lord and so many people will sell their Birthright for for a bowl of Stew it's not even good stew comparative you kidding me what does this world have that it can offer that compares tell me tell me why the richest men in the world are still working you ever figure that one out are you kidding me you're worth 40 billion 200 billion and you're still working they're searching for something right that this world can never never satisfy yes sir all your Lear Jets and all your Islands they still working what are what are they working for they're working to die and what's going to be left of them like Elvis Presley a fleet of Cadillacs and some 1950 greatest hits was it worth it like that one that cried just a just a drip of water on my tongue how easily we trade it away but we can't be satisfied with just recognizing oh my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life and I'll get there on we have tonight yes and we have the moment that we are now living in right that Christ might lead us and guide us in the moment that we're living in to minister unto him and to minister unto others that that Christ and the bride are becoming one I don't want belabor the service and take the time but we understand how uh that God when he started to create the world and he he came up to man and he said everything is good but when he looked at Adam there alone he said it is not good that man would dwell alone so he said I will make a help meat for him and he where was that help meat it was within it was part of him and God separated that help meat out of him and brought her unto him and what did Adam do he gave her her identification he told her look you're bone of my bone you you have come from me so therefore I call you woman your bone of my bone and your Flesh of My Flesh you see what God was mirroring there in the beginning he's now come in the end time and he said the same thing to you look you you you came out of my side at Calvary I predestinated you to this age that you would live in that you would fulfill my word but you are part of me you are now bone of my bone you are Flesh of My Flesh you are life of my life you came from me we are one there's this Oneness there's this Unity but what was the purpose of the Bride when God was was mirroring that out and reflecting he said it's not good that man should dwell alone the purpose of Eve was to minister unto Adam that there would be a union there that there would be a Oneness that they could Minister one to the other so then what about us you have a great ministry but it's it's not just limited to trying to to go out and prove to the world you're superhuman I can do all things because I know all things cuz he's revealed all things no no it's it's humble it's it's it's led by the spirit and in order to get to that we must recognize as a prophet of God would say this who is he says he's referring to the scripture in Revelations 5 he came and he came 10,000 times 10,000 that right ministered to him the bride the queen and king who is your little Queen in the home she ministers food to your right when she ministers to you that's what the bride ministers to Christ the word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word see she ministers the word to the king manifesting his promise word in the age that she's living in how do we minister to him oh you see the natural type in the spiritual how much you're Queen of the home when you come home from work and you've been rubbing shoulders with the world all day and and you feel all beat down and you've been trying to overcome all these devils and and things trying to trip you this way and that way and and get on your Everlast nerve and you're doing everything you can it's just all building up and and you finally get home and you smell that Ministry what's your cooking love I hope people still cook CU man it does a lot you come in what's what's the prophet saying you're little Queen of the home she's created an atmosphere you you've come home from the day and now she's going to start ministering unto you you come in honey how was your day oh how did things go and all of a sudden all of those things that were all building up all over what it just starts to wash away because everything you were working for everything you are laboring for it's it's all about the home it's about the family it's about the kids it's about the wife I I finally made it you know what honey how was your day hey you know what it really wasn't that bad I had a good day how was yours but if you had asked the question on the way home why you wouldn't believe this guy over here man wait get out of my way come on oh don't worry about somebody just cut me off I'm gonna lose it out here honey I'm driving I'm going crazy but what is it she comes home she ministers to you oh she just washes those things of the world and what do you do you Minister back right you should Minister back to a Ministry one to another we don't show up home like people show up to church bless me preacher I worked all day worked all week long and I got here on Sunday morning I gave my 10% and now preacher bless me tell me what I want to hear yeah you know you could have heated that up a little bit more preacher I don't I don't like it you know actually I don't like it that hot will you slow down and this ain't quite right will you season it a little better what were you doing all day anyways all you had to do was do the laundry and cook one meal that ain't that hard I had to go out there and work for eight hours you'd be surprised how many women would say get sign me up sign me up man you go out work for8 hours and watch how it is 24/7 at the house with diapers and this and that and kids fussing and fighting hey our our moms and our wives work 24/7 and some of us think we're a king of a castle and come home and say bless me we do the same thing to our Lord we think we think we've done something oh I I I made it through the week I made it to the house of God I'm here now bless me no that ain't the way it's ministering one to another as you come in there there should be a ministering oh how how how how times we I'm just a younger and haven't been married that long but we we we we got to revisit those things we got to work on those things we we got to minister one to another uh if if we're not careful it's so easy to allow the cares and things of the world where we just want somebody else to bless us and we're not ministering to them and I say shame on us forever getting to the place where we fail to minister unto our Lord he's worthy to be ministered to he's worthy of praise and adoration he's worthy of our time he's worthy of us to steal away and get away and say Lord this is now your time I need to talk to you I need to get in your presence Lord Lord I Thank you for answering my prayers thanks for answering my request Lord but but now I just want to tell you I want to tell you thank you thank you for Calvary Lord I I don't know that have been I can't imagine how hard that was under that load of that cross and how they beat you and your flesh tore off of you and you could have called for 10,000 angels at any moment you could have you you didn't have to pray Lord let this cup pass from me but nevertheless thy will Lord you did that for me I thank you so much Lord I just want to worship you a little bit and and tell you how much I thank you for doing that for me and how I want to I want to serve you with all of my heart Lord and I'm sorry where I fail you and how I don't spend time with you like I should and how I don't pray for Revelation and and really cherish this message that you've sent lord it's it's come with great sacrifice and I haven't given it the the the the the reverence I haven't given it the time I I really haven't esteemed it I really haven't been impressed like I should Lord and for that I'm sorry but would you just come now Lord and allow me to minister to you and wash your feet tell you that I love you Lord and that you could have your will and your way in my life Lord where I'm not right forgive me Lord if you'll just show me I do my best to make those things right Lord you give me the strength you get into a Union like that you get into a place to where you're now ministering unto him now you're in a position in a place you're channeled right you're in a Unity you're in a Oneness and now from there you allow the things from the world or you go into that din or you go somewhere and now you're in a place you know what I'm walking with him yes Lord what would you have to do I Love You Lord Lord if this is an opportunity that I could Minister Lord us together Minister Through Me Lord what would your will be done I see that they're in bondage I I I see that they're they're reaching for things of this world Lord is there something I might be able to say that could be a help to him because now you're not not not now are you not only ministering unto him but now you're in that Oneness you're in that Unity you're now walking with him my we just have to close uh we have so many places we' like to get to but not the time to do it the wife ministers to the husband I want I want that to settle in the wife ministers the we're we're in the Supernatural now you Minister unto the Lord when you look into the scripture and he says oh I saw the New Jerusalem coming down out of a heaven as a bride adorned for her husband what was that adorning for what was that preparation for it was for him what is this dress wear for what what are we being dressed in this message for it ain't for the [Music] world we ain't being robed and dressed in this message for we're being robed and dressed with this message for him he's worthy he's worthy of a virtuous bride he's worthy of one that loves them he's worthy of one that say I don't want anything this world has to offer he's worthy of a bride that would would forsake everything that this Satan needen has to offer say Lord whatever it takes for you Lord you're worthy let me minister to you let me be adorned with you let me say no to the Fashions let me say no to the to the the cares of this world let me say no to the entertainments say Lord whatever thy will is for my life yes then when you're staying in that presence when you're ripening in the presence of the son of man you become Bread on his table now you're ministering now you're becoming the word made flesh ministering the word back to the groom we'll just ask for the musicians to come no way to turn this corner and let you out in time for breakfast that's my heart's desire is I want to minister to the Lord I want to serve him I want to be pleasing I want to worship I want to love him with all of my heart and I know these things are Elementary but that's exactly what Malachi 4:5 has done just as God brought Eve un Adam elzer our messenger has brought us under our groom where we find our ident ification where we find out who we are and now church it's time to become what he said we are he said you have to be anointed you must be born again our theology our good works our church our understanding it's not good enough it's not enough the prophet of God said Moses knew a whole lot you can play something softly Moses knew a whole lot about God but when he came into the presence of that Pillar of Fire that's where he found out his mistakes it's where he found his failure sure we come into the presence of this message we realize we're lacking we look into it say oh my I believe I believe this word but the prophet of God said it also had what he needed it had what he lacked so if you're lacking tonight it's laying right here in the word if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's here for you it's the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing but it's the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit in his life [Music] you are the anointed one for this day you believe that you you can't put it off on anybody else there has to be something in the heart of the believer that is saying you know what it's time for me to fulfill the ministry that God has placed me here for I've been ministering to a whole lot of other needs things that are just going to be that are going to pass away but Lord you said heavens and earth will pass away but my word your word will never pass away that's what I want yes I want to just let all of those things fade away and I want to allow the mind that was in Christ Jesus to be in me that I must be about the father's business Lord that this unit that this harmony Lord that you're speaking of would come into [Music] me I'm tired of babying the flesh man I'm tired of catering to the things of the world Lord if you said and if you said I'm supposed to be the anointed word of this day Lord Lord I want to empty out tonight that you could come Lord I've been so filled up with the things of the world I've been so consumed with jobs and bills and and just trying to make in me that I've totally forgot about you Lord and I realize I can never fulfill what you've placed me here to fulfill if I'm not ministering unto [Music] you not if I'm not coming under the presence of your word if I'm not coming into a Unity with you so I say Here I Am Lord I'm here to empty out I want that anointing Lord I want that Holy Spirit to come to come upon my life to make this word live not just on Sunday oh maybe this sounds repetitious I believe what the prophet [Music] spoke I believe that there is now a great ministry taking place in the lives of the Bride that's sitting here and now we need to embrace it where is your ministry where is your Pulpit it's wherever you are it's your school it's your home it's your family but we've forgotten we've forgotten that we are to be the Tabernacle love the Lord that all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into you so then the works that he did you do maybe with every head [Music] bowed maybe there's somebody here that hasn't come into that type of unity that kind of Oneness [Music] and Jesus said Peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you receive ye the Holy Ghost with every head bowed is there somebody [Music] here you want to receive the Holy Ghost and you just want to stand say Lord I want to be Anointed with the Holy Ghost God bless you God bless you that's it why don't you just start ministering to him he made a way for you yes he gave you an ear to hear he gave you a heart to respond to his word that the same way that Jesus Christ came that he could stand there and say the spirit of the Lord is upon me yes he has anointed me to fulfill the word that has been spoken and now he's telling you bride that same spirit that same Holy Ghost anointing is here to anoint you yes you're not too young if there's something in your heart that desires the Lord why don't you receive it say Lord here I am I want the Holy Ghost Lord I I want that same spirit I want that anointing to make this message live let's all [Music] stand let's just sing this [Music] [Music] song their verses [Music] your head Lord I'm long to see your desires reveal in me way I give myself away so you can use me I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me take take my heart take my life as a Living Sacrifice all my PL place them in your hand I give myself away oh I give myself away so you can use me I give myself away I give myself away so you can use [Music] [Music] me I know what it's like be in the presence of the Lord and I know what time it is cuz time Stood [Music] Still we he families [Music] restored because we stayed here in the
