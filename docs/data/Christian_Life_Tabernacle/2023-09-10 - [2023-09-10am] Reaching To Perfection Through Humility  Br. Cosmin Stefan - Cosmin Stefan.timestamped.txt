[32:09] I'm going to sing a song called Jesus is
[32:12] the answer it's a pretty common song If
[32:15] you'll know it feel free to join with me
[32:19] I had a
[32:20] met a gentleman who shared some personal
[32:23] struggles he was going through with him
[32:25] and his wife and I was trying to explain
[32:28] to him that the worldly things he was
[32:31] turning to would not solve the problem
[32:34] we're making it worse
[32:36] and after I had left and I'm praying
[32:39] that the Lord continues to minister to
[32:41] him the thought just came to my mind
[32:43] that really Jesus is the answer to every
[32:46] single thing and it's never changed for
[32:49] more than 2 000 years ago so
[32:52] I hope it's a blessing to you
[33:08] but Jesus is the answer

[47:48] blood you have no part with me let it
[47:51] not just be in the natural but let it
[47:52] also be in the spiritual where our lives
[47:54] are so lined up with the word of God
[47:56] that it's you that speaks to us Lord
[47:59] Lord that I or that the word of God will
[48:01] be on our lips testifying of Jesus
[48:03] Christ

[48:07] in every sickness and every battle that
[48:10] the name of Jesus must be lifted up
[48:12] because you're the same yesterday today
[48:14] and forever
[48:16] so Lord we invite your presence tonight
[48:18] to be with us we love you we Praise You
[48:21] In Jesus Christ's name we pray
[48:26] welcome to the house of the Lord I am
[48:30] we're not going to be long tonight I
[48:31] know it's communion so we just want to
[48:33] share a few things that the Lord put on
[48:34] our heart
[48:35] let's just um open to First John chapter
[48:38] 5.
[48:40] and I'm under expectation that the Lord
[48:43] could speak to me
[48:45] I was telling by the Billy in the back I
[48:46] don't know how this is going to come out
[48:48] but I know that you'll place it properly
[48:50] for even for me to get it because when
[48:52] it's the revealed word of the hour we
[48:54] humble ourselves to it amen
[48:58] and so just pray for me please
[49:03] so John chapter 5 verses 1 to 12 we'll
[49:06] be doing a little bit of reading but
[49:07] that's the word of God Amen
[49:11] let's just let's just be very cautious
[49:13] as we're reading through these
[49:15] scriptures the importance of what we're
[49:16] reading
[49:17] because when we're talking about the
[49:20] word the word has a character the word
[49:23] has an identity that's right
[49:25] and he's given us the opportunity to
[49:28] know his character based upon him being
[49:31] the same
[49:33] brother Brandon brought this into our
[49:36] into our time this message how it is
[49:39] based on the foundation of it is Jesus
[49:42] Christ the same
[49:43] yesterday today and forever
[49:47] he's the same amen amen so
[49:52] verse 1 it says
[49:54] whosoever believeth that Jesus is Christ
[49:57] is born of God
[49:59] and everyone that loveth him that begat
[50:02] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[50:06] by this we know that we love the
[50:09] children of God when we love God and
[50:12] keep his Commandments
[50:15] for this is the love of God
[50:18] that we keep his Commandments and his
[50:22] Commandments are not Grievous
[50:26] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[50:29] the world and this is the victory that
[50:33] overcometh the world even our faith
[50:36] who is seed that overcometh the world
[50:38] but he that believeth that Jesus Christ
[50:41] is the son of God
[50:43] this is he that came by water and blood
[50:47] even Jesus Christ so we understand
[50:51] brother bam takes that and he says that
[50:53] water and blood is the sanctification in
[50:55] the and the it's the justification and
[50:58] sanctification of the Bride
[51:00] when he was on the cross when he was
[51:02] crucified there was water and blood that
[51:04] came out that was already prepared
[51:07] but yet the Holy Ghost had to be
[51:09] Resurrected
[51:11] so she was already cleansed
[51:14] she was already Justified but he took
[51:17] Jesus Christ himself to reveal himself
[51:20] through his word
[51:22] in the spirit
[51:24] amen
[51:25] verse 6.
[51:27] and this is he that came by water and
[51:30] blood even Jesus Christ not by water
[51:32] only but by water and blood and it is
[51:36] the spirit
[51:38] that Barrett witness because the spirit
[51:41] is truth
[51:43] so you can have the truth
[51:46] but not have the spirit
[51:48] but here it says that the spirit is
[51:51] truth
[51:52] amen
[51:54] verse 7 for there are three that bear
[51:56] record in heaven so there's a record
[51:58] that are in heaven
[52:00] the Father the word and the Holy Ghost
[52:02] and these three are one
[52:06] the record that is in heaven
[52:08] and there are three that bear witness in
[52:11] Earth
[52:12] and this is the spirit
[52:14] the water and the blood and these three
[52:18] agree in one
[52:20] so
[52:22] justification sanctification and the
[52:25] spirit Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost
[52:28] himself they agree in one
[52:32] if we receive the witness of man the
[52:35] witness of God is greater
[52:37] for this is the witness of God which he
[52:40] had testified of his son
[52:42] he that believeth on the son had the
[52:44] witness in himself
[52:47] he that believeth not God had not had
[52:50] made him a liar because he believeth not
[52:53] the record that God gave his son
[52:57] and this is the record that God had
[53:00] given to us eternal life and this life
[53:04] isn't his son
[53:06] heed that hat the son had life and he
[53:10] that had not the son had not the life so
[53:14] we realized the spirit
[53:17] has life and that Spirit came with the
[53:21] truth so we have to identify the
[53:23] character of the spirit
[53:26] well let's also turn the Jude chapter
[53:28] one and then we'll we'll take a seat
[53:36] and we'll read from verses 27 that or 17
[53:39] to 25.
[53:43] because I I was really moved by this
[53:47] morning's service how brother Billy was
[53:49] preaching about
[53:50] contending for the faith of the
[53:52] scripture and how even Brother David
[53:54] brought it out within the last few
[53:55] services
[53:57] and we were talking last night and I was
[53:59] telling brother Billy
[54:02] it's good to content
[54:04] to contend
[54:06] but sometimes we could be we become
[54:08] content
[54:10] so when you're content you're not
[54:12] contending for anything
[54:14] when you're satisfied
[54:16] when you're comfortable there's no
[54:18] contending because when you contend you
[54:21] have to have a brother to contend with
[54:23] I mean it's just the spirit of love you
[54:25] have to have a brother to contend with
[54:26] it's not you know and it's it's in love
[54:30] we're contending not contenting right
[54:33] but we're not just satisfied verse 17.
[54:38] but beloved remember ye The Words which
[54:42] were spoken before of the Apostles of
[54:45] our Lord Jesus Christ
[54:47] how that they told you that there would
[54:49] be mockers in the last time who should
[54:52] walk after their own ungodly lust
[54:55] this be they who separate themselves
[54:58] Central having not the spirit
[55:02] so having the truth but not having the
[55:05] spirit
[55:07] but ye beloved building up yourselves on
[55:10] your Most Holy Faith
[55:13] praying in the Holy Ghost
[55:15] keep yourselves in the love of God
[55:18] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[55:22] Christ unto eternal life
[55:25] and of some have compassion making a
[55:28] difference
[55:29] and others saved with fear pulling them
[55:32] out of the fire hating even the Garment
[55:35] spotted by the flesh
[55:38] now think about what James is what Jude
[55:40] is saying here
[55:41] and brother Billy mentioned it this
[55:42] morning this is about 30 years
[55:46] after or 60 years I believe we were
[55:49] talking this was 60 years after the
[55:51] resurrection of Jesus Christ and all of
[55:54] a sudden he's he's letting us know even
[55:56] back then to be cautious of these things
[56:00] because these are spirits
[56:04] and now unto him that is able to keep
[56:07] you from falling and to present you're
[56:09] faultless before the presence of his
[56:10] glory with exceeding Joy
[56:12] to the only wise God our savior be glory
[56:15] and Majesty dominion and power both now
[56:18] and forever amen Lord Jesus we just ask
[56:20] that you does this word to us tonight in
[56:22] Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you
[56:24] you can have your seats
[56:34] so I want to
[56:36] talk a little bit about tonight the Lord
[56:38] put a little bit of a subject out of my
[56:40] heart tonight and
[56:42] it's reaching for Perfection through
[56:44] humility
[56:46] the Lord inspired me because it's it's
[56:48] communion in foot washing tonight and so
[56:50] it's important to know the character of
[56:53] the word
[56:54] and so
[56:57] we see that in the beginning the way
[57:00] that the serpent try to come into
[57:01] Humanity was to this flesh
[57:04] and so brother Banner comes and tells us
[57:06] that the greatest battle ever fought was
[57:08] between the carnal man and the spiritual
[57:10] man it's up here in the mind
[57:13] and so the battle is always going to be
[57:15] with this flesh
[57:17] the battle is always trying to have it
[57:19] come to subjection to something
[57:23] because it always wants to get ahead of
[57:25] God
[57:27] we were here and even the past weekend
[57:29] how the Trello of The Serpent and how he
[57:32] came in through the Flesh and how he
[57:34] desired to do all these things by the
[57:36] flesh trying to accomplish something by
[57:39] The Works of man instead of depending
[57:41] and and and and manifesting what God had
[57:44] allowed him to be
[57:46] and so we understand that the spirit of
[57:50] God
[57:51] is always in the children of God
[57:55] now brother banham says this and this is
[58:00] this is I want this to be a foundation
[58:03] for us because it's simple
[58:06] the Lord is simple God hides himself in
[58:10] simplicity
[58:12] this word is not complicated scent
[58:15] brother bam says this and greater than
[58:18] Solomon is here 63.
[58:21] and he says we've talked about it even
[58:23] this morning brother David even talked
[58:25] about it before and he says it this way
[58:28] he says and time hasn't changed
[58:31] so time hasn't changed
[58:34] God has to remained the same time hasn't
[58:37] changed he says you know
[58:40] he said God takes his man but never his
[58:44] spirit
[58:46] Satan takes his man but never their
[58:50] spirit
[58:52] he comes right back on someone wrong and
[58:54] someone else and goes right on down and
[58:57] now we find that in this generation it
[59:00] says in in every generation about the
[59:03] same
[59:04] so we understand that this flesh
[59:08] is dirt
[59:10] it was it was it came from the ground
[59:12] and it's going back into the ground
[59:14] because it was a creation that God had
[59:17] made in the beginning
[59:19] but because of sin it's no longer
[59:22] righteous because thou it wants to
[59:25] fulfill the lust of the flesh more than
[59:27] it wants to do what the purpose of the
[59:28] creation was it always tries to take you
[59:32] away from the word it always tries to
[59:34] take you away from the truth it always
[59:36] tries to give you an explanation it
[59:39] always tries to give you another road it
[59:41] always tries to give you another view
[59:44] because it's the way of the flesh
[59:47] it's the way that the flesh was always
[59:50] because of sin because of the
[59:53] disobedience in the beginning remember
[59:55] when when the serpent came to Eve he
[59:58] said surely but then he said because if
[1:00:03] you would then you would be like Gods
[1:00:05] but they were already like Gods their
[1:00:07] character was already there
[1:00:09] but he made them question themselves
[1:00:14] he made them question themselves so he
[1:00:17] came to the weaker vessel and he told
[1:00:19] the RICO vessel
[1:00:21] that she wasn't that when she was that
[1:00:26] but what happened was she wasn't
[1:00:27] obedient to her husband
[1:00:31] she wasn't humbled
[1:00:34] she wasn't obedient to her husband
[1:00:37] so we understand that when this
[1:00:40] generation now started civilization
[1:00:42] education it's all of these things that
[1:00:44] come
[1:00:44] now they were more fulfilled by the eyes
[1:00:47] and intelligence of man than really they
[1:00:50] were by the leadership of God because
[1:00:51] the world gotten so bad at one point
[1:00:54] that God sent a flood to destroy them
[1:00:56] all
[1:00:57] and even after that
[1:00:59] even after that
[1:01:02] the generations coming forth they still
[1:01:05] started slipping away from the Lord
[1:01:08] so
[1:01:09] we understand that Jesus Christ is the
[1:01:12] same yesterday today and forever
[1:01:14] we understand that this message of the
[1:01:16] hour brought us access to the opening of
[1:01:19] the seals gave us power
[1:01:21] the third pool these things that we talk
[1:01:24] about these things are just not theories
[1:01:27] they're just not vain words that we're
[1:01:29] just thinking about this is life
[1:01:32] this is God manifesting himself
[1:01:35] and so the character
[1:01:39] is still unfolding God's still training
[1:01:42] and teaching his children
[1:01:44] now I want to I want to just concentrate
[1:01:46] here because brother Branham
[1:01:48] makes a statement I didn't bring the
[1:01:50] quote but he says that people want Power
[1:01:56] so we're living in an age where people
[1:01:59] want Power
[1:02:00] we're living in the age where people
[1:02:02] want influence we're living in an age
[1:02:05] where people always want to have this
[1:02:07] Authority or this power
[1:02:10] because they want to be in control
[1:02:13] because they want to be the ones that
[1:02:15] are is responsible for every decision
[1:02:18] that's made because they think it's
[1:02:19] right and that's this human flesh this
[1:02:22] is the Serpent's
[1:02:24] way of coming in where now he's trying
[1:02:26] to deceive Us by these five senses and
[1:02:29] so we understand that
[1:02:32] the only way to be able to
[1:02:36] bring it under subjection
[1:02:38] is to Humble it to where it was created
[1:02:40] for
[1:02:42] and so
[1:02:43] we're reaching Perfection through
[1:02:46] humility
[1:02:48] so what is the message of the hour
[1:02:51] how do you know the message of the hour
[1:02:55] that's a very good question because
[1:02:56] brother Billy read it this morning he
[1:02:58] says that before the Dreadful day of the
[1:03:01] Lord okay he'll send
[1:03:03] the spirit of Elijah okay and then he
[1:03:07] says before the dead and it says before
[1:03:10] the coming of the Lord
[1:03:13] so we understand that there's something
[1:03:15] that's happening the coming of the Lord
[1:03:17] is here
[1:03:18] the coming of the Lord is something that
[1:03:21] was prophesied about just as much as
[1:03:24] Malachi 4 5 coming into the spirit of
[1:03:27] Elijah
[1:03:28] let's not forget that portion of the
[1:03:30] scripture as well because now it's
[1:03:33] bringing he so so remember
[1:03:37] John the Baptist when he's seen Christ
[1:03:39] on the scene he said I must decrease so
[1:03:43] he can increase now what was he
[1:03:45] decreasing from
[1:03:47] what was he recognizing when he noticed
[1:03:50] the word was on the scene he stepped
[1:03:52] back and he said Lord not my will but
[1:03:54] thine will and if that's the vessel you
[1:03:56] came through I respect that I'm humbling
[1:03:59] myself to that because I notice it it's
[1:04:01] so much that he questioned himself and
[1:04:02] he said the disciples are there is that
[1:04:04] really him yes it is him believe believe
[1:04:09] but he was mature and he caught the
[1:04:12] revelation of what the word was saying
[1:04:14] was to come
[1:04:16] understanding the character of the word
[1:04:19] so
[1:04:21] the message of the hour gives the
[1:04:23] believer the revelation of the coming of
[1:04:26] the Lord
[1:04:28] and it's only through the message of the
[1:04:30] hour
[1:04:31] and that's something that God did not
[1:04:33] man that something that God did
[1:04:36] but we understand that sometimes man
[1:04:39] tries to have an influence on something
[1:04:41] that God's already accomplished and is
[1:04:43] already done
[1:04:45] trying to have an influence upon this
[1:04:47] flesh
[1:04:49] that is trying to
[1:04:51] to to lift itself higher
[1:04:56] than the Creator who is greater the
[1:04:59] Creator or the creation
[1:05:01] brother Branham says that the the
[1:05:04] creation itself is is praising God
[1:05:07] because of what it was made to do
[1:05:11] the flowers
[1:05:13] even the sunflower I was able to
[1:05:16] experience this was while I was in
[1:05:17] Romania and it was just fields and
[1:05:19] Fields of sunflower and me and my wife
[1:05:21] were driving and all of a sudden we were
[1:05:23] just looking and and the farmers were
[1:05:25] telling us that when this when the Sun
[1:05:27] rises the flower turns its face to the
[1:05:31] Sun
[1:05:32] and when the sun sets it actually bows
[1:05:35] its head because it is it is ripened for
[1:05:39] that day
[1:05:40] so he bows his head and humility knowing
[1:05:43] that that's what the sun did now that's
[1:05:45] creation you don't have to tell her what
[1:05:47] to do
[1:05:48] it just obeys God based upon what it was
[1:05:51] created to do
[1:05:53] it's the same
[1:05:55] with the spirit of God Saints
[1:05:59] so I wanted to turn to Genesis
[1:06:02] because brother Branham says everything
[1:06:03] started in Genesis
[1:06:05] and so if we turn to Genesis 11 I just
[1:06:09] wanted to read this this scripture
[1:06:11] verses one through nine
[1:06:15] and just see the character of the Lord
[1:06:18] in every age because we have to identify
[1:06:22] him the same yesterday today and forever
[1:06:24] so this is After the flood
[1:06:28] and now
[1:06:30] this is what's happening
[1:06:32] and the whole earth was of one language
[1:06:34] and and of of one speech
[1:06:37] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[1:06:40] from the East that they found the plane
[1:06:42] in the land of China and they dwelt
[1:06:45] there
[1:06:46] and they said one to another
[1:06:49] go to let us make brick
[1:06:53] and bird them through thoroughly and
[1:06:56] they had brick for stone and slime had
[1:06:59] they for Mortar so realize that they
[1:07:02] took from the very creation
[1:07:06] so they took
[1:07:07] they took dirt to make brick right and
[1:07:11] then they took they to make stone and
[1:07:14] they took slime to make the mortar so
[1:07:16] they took the very the very substance
[1:07:19] from the ground now now look where it's
[1:07:22] going
[1:07:23] verse 4 and they said go to let us build
[1:07:27] us a city and a tower whose top May
[1:07:30] reach into heaven
[1:07:33] and let us make us a name
[1:07:36] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[1:07:40] face of the whole Earth
[1:07:42] and the Lord came down
[1:07:44] to see the city and the tower
[1:07:47] which the children of man building and
[1:07:51] the Lord said behold the people is one
[1:07:55] and they all of one language and this
[1:07:59] they begin to do and now nothing will
[1:08:03] restrain them which they have imagined
[1:08:07] to do
[1:08:11] go to let us go down and therefore
[1:08:15] confound their language that they may
[1:08:17] not understand one another speech so the
[1:08:21] Lord scattered them abroad from thence
[1:08:23] upon the face of the Earth and they left
[1:08:25] off to to build the city
[1:08:29] and therefore the name is so-called
[1:08:32] Babel because the Lord did their
[1:08:34] confound the language of the earth of
[1:08:36] all the Earth and from thence did the
[1:08:38] Lord scattered them abroad upon the face
[1:08:40] of the Earth and so brother Branham
[1:08:42] takes this
[1:08:44] and he said you see Man by the
[1:08:46] intelligence of man took from the
[1:08:49] substance of what God has created build
[1:08:52] that something of themselves calling it
[1:08:55] a city
[1:08:57] wanting to be above God wanting to do
[1:09:00] things that weren't according to the
[1:09:01] word of God and he says you know they
[1:09:04] didn't come to provided way
[1:09:07] they could have reached the city they
[1:09:09] could have reached the heavens but
[1:09:10] brother Branham says it wasn't the
[1:09:12] provided way so God now had created a
[1:09:16] confusion in their language even though
[1:09:18] they were speaking the same thing
[1:09:20] they weren't able to understand each
[1:09:21] other
[1:09:24] even though they were speaking the same
[1:09:25] thing they weren't able to understand
[1:09:27] each other
[1:09:29] brother bam says this and it is the
[1:09:31] rising of the Sun so I'm just wanting to
[1:09:34] point to
[1:09:37] what is what how important it is for a
[1:09:40] Believer for a son and daughter of God
[1:09:42] to always humble themselves to the word
[1:09:46] to always be humbled by the word because
[1:09:49] once God reveals the word to you it
[1:09:53] takes away the fear replaces it with
[1:09:56] love and now it humbles you
[1:09:58] amen it takes away the fear of unbelief
[1:10:00] and he gives you the love of God and
[1:10:03] then that humbles the wife because
[1:10:06] that's what she is she's of himself
[1:10:09] it's who he is
[1:10:12] he came and he was the lowest man on
[1:10:15] this Earth
[1:10:16] to show that it's not about this flesh
[1:10:19] it was never about this flesh and the
[1:10:21] only way to redeem this flesh is through
[1:10:23] humility We Gotta Die daily to ourselves
[1:10:26] we got to let go of this this human
[1:10:28] nature as much as possible because what
[1:10:31] it wants to do always it wants to fight
[1:10:34] back
[1:10:35] it wants to talk back it wants to talk
[1:10:38] him properly it wants to start saying
[1:10:40] well let me put this together I would
[1:10:41] like to do this and I all of a sudden
[1:10:44] now arrogancy and pride and all these
[1:10:46] things the lust of the eyes the lust of
[1:10:48] the flesh all of this the lust of the
[1:10:49] world all these things start coming
[1:10:51] because
[1:10:53] we're not humble in ourselves fully to
[1:10:55] the word of God Lord help me
[1:10:58] help me
[1:11:00] brother Baum says this it says now and
[1:11:02] there isn't it and it is the rising of
[1:11:04] the sun paragraph 30 I believe it says
[1:11:07] now the very essence of the message that
[1:11:09] was sent he that is risen from the dead
[1:11:13] we his beneficiaries we who share the
[1:11:18] resurrection with him draw benefits from
[1:11:21] this by proving to the world that he's
[1:11:25] alive
[1:11:26] we cannot do it by word only
[1:11:30] we cannot do it by some tradition of man
[1:11:33] we can only exactly we can only reflect
[1:11:38] exactly to what we're pointing to
[1:11:41] we can only I'll read that again we can
[1:11:44] only reflect exactly what we're pointing
[1:11:47] to I'm afraid today that many of us are
[1:11:50] not getting people to Christ we're
[1:11:52] getting them to the church to a theory
[1:11:54] but we must get them to Christ he's the
[1:11:57] only one and the only one that has life
[1:12:02] he that has the son hath life
[1:12:06] and this is the life of a man that's
[1:12:08] dead to be projected in you you will
[1:12:10] live the same life he lived
[1:12:13] if the blood of a man was a certain type
[1:12:16] and you took the blood from one man and
[1:12:20] changed it to the blood of uh of what of
[1:12:23] of the one man into another he would
[1:12:27] absolutely be that type of that type
[1:12:30] blood
[1:12:31] and if your spirit that was in you is
[1:12:33] reckoned dead and now it says you are
[1:12:36] anointed with the life that was in
[1:12:40] Christ is upon you Romans 8 11 said if
[1:12:44] the spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:12:46] dead dwells in you it'll also Quicken
[1:12:49] your mortal bodies that same life the
[1:12:52] same powers does them same beneficiaries
[1:12:55] that he had here on Earth from God he
[1:13:00] redeemed you a seed that was foreknown
[1:13:03] by God whose name was put on the Lamb's
[1:13:05] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:13:07] the world and that the Gospel Light of
[1:13:10] the Resurrection the confirmation of the
[1:13:13] word how did we know he was the Christ
[1:13:18] who do you say that I am
[1:13:21] personally
[1:13:24] don't pull somebody else to the picture
[1:13:26] who do you say that I am it's a personal
[1:13:30] question well some say you're the son of
[1:13:33] Jonas some say you're this some say your
[1:13:36] dad but personal who do you say that he
[1:13:39] is because he proved what he talked
[1:13:42] about how will I know the message of the
[1:13:46] hour God proves what he promised and he
[1:13:50] talks about it this is the
[1:13:52] identification identification that we
[1:13:55] are beneficiaries with him in the
[1:13:57] resurrection he proves what he talks
[1:14:01] about
[1:14:02] amen so if he proves what he's talking
[1:14:05] about then our very life should be a
[1:14:08] very proof of what he's talking about
[1:14:10] if my testimony by confession is that
[1:14:13] I'm a Son of God my life must be able to
[1:14:16] be matching to the word of God to be in
[1:14:18] the life of God
[1:14:19] you gotta humble the flesh
[1:14:24] you got to Humble the flesh I have to
[1:14:27] Humble My Flesh
[1:14:30] this is what he did when he came he
[1:14:33] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:14:35] suffered
[1:14:37] he learned obedience by the things he
[1:14:39] suffered he put down this flesh but he
[1:14:43] was so great in the spirit because he
[1:14:44] was dating a character
[1:14:46] the character of the word
[1:14:49] Romans 8 from 8 to 10 says it this way
[1:14:52] it says so then
[1:14:55] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:14:57] God
[1:14:59] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:15:02] spirit
[1:15:04] if so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[1:15:07] you
[1:15:08] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:15:11] Christ he is none of his
[1:15:13] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:15:17] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:15:20] because of righteousness so the spirit
[1:15:23] is life because of righteousness it
[1:15:27] produces righteousness the spirit of God
[1:15:30] produces righteousness
[1:15:34] brother Branham says this in images of
[1:15:38] Christ in 59 May 25th so
[1:15:43] humbling this flesh has been something
[1:15:45] that God has always proved the same
[1:15:49] yesterday today and forever
[1:15:53] because I I I I I I was so blessed when
[1:15:57] even brother
[1:15:59] Billy was talking about Isaac
[1:16:03] you know he was a promised son that was
[1:16:05] given for 25 years
[1:16:07] and then the lord gave him a son
[1:16:11] and then God wanted to prove Abraham
[1:16:14] you know how he wanted to prove him
[1:16:17] to sacrifice the very blessing that he
[1:16:20] gave him
[1:16:22] he said he told them in Genesis 22 he
[1:16:25] said take your son
[1:16:28] and bring him unto me as a sacrifice
[1:16:31] now Abraham humbled himself
[1:16:35] to the word
[1:16:36] even though it had hurt as much as it
[1:16:39] did
[1:16:40] Lord you gave me this promise
[1:16:43] you gave me this son 25 years I've
[1:16:46] prayed and Lord you gave me this son
[1:16:48] this is the promised word that you've
[1:16:50] given me you're giving me the Sun and
[1:16:52] now you want to take it away from me
[1:16:55] now you want me to go sacrifice my own
[1:16:57] son
[1:17:00] Lord if that's your will I'll do it
[1:17:03] if that's your will Lord I'll do it
[1:17:05] because I know that I'm more safe in the
[1:17:08] will of God than I am in the will of man
[1:17:11] if I'm under the will if I'm under his
[1:17:14] blood if I'm under his protection I know
[1:17:16] that I'm safer there than I am in any
[1:17:18] other place any other time in every
[1:17:22] other decision and every other
[1:17:23] circumstance
[1:17:26] and so
[1:17:29] I
[1:17:30] I can I can re I can relate to Isaac
[1:17:33] being a lad
[1:17:38] he told he told his he he told his
[1:17:41] guards he says stay here with the mule
[1:17:43] with the with stay here and some let's
[1:17:47] go I gotta take the lad we're going to
[1:17:48] go up to the mountain and do a sacrifice
[1:17:51] I could only imagine Isaac he knew
[1:17:54] because there was other sacrifices that
[1:17:55] were done in the past why is this one so
[1:17:58] different why don't we have the
[1:17:59] sacrifice
[1:18:00] why don't we have I mean you brought the
[1:18:03] word you brought all the stuff that we
[1:18:05] need to do to put it on the sacrifice
[1:18:07] but where is it at why can't I see it
[1:18:11] and so much that Isaac himself was
[1:18:13] humbled that Abraham had to tie his
[1:18:16] hands around his back and put him on the
[1:18:18] altar
[1:18:20] ain't so much that he tied his hands
[1:18:22] behind his back and he was laying on the
[1:18:24] altar
[1:18:25] and he said okay Lord and he was just
[1:18:28] about to light up the fire and the Lord
[1:18:30] stopped and says oh Abraham now I know
[1:18:34] now I know how much you love me now I
[1:18:38] know how much I mean to you now I
[1:18:41] understand
[1:18:42] I can trust you now with my word
[1:18:47] now I understand that you would do
[1:18:49] anything
[1:18:51] brother banham says it and and in images
[1:18:55] of Christ
[1:18:57] what a difference of so-called
[1:18:59] reflecting Christians today and Saints I
[1:19:02] I want to say this
[1:19:04] we have to be mature
[1:19:07] in everything that we do so if the word
[1:19:09] speak into our hearts we're mature
[1:19:11] enough to understand and we can take it
[1:19:13] because it's for us amen and so it says
[1:19:16] what a difference of so-called
[1:19:18] reflecting Christians today what a
[1:19:20] difference why the so-called Christians
[1:19:22] today wants to be served
[1:19:24] oh he begins to think that he's somebody
[1:19:27] what a difference from what it was when
[1:19:30] it says when reflecting him he never
[1:19:33] came to be Minister too but he came to
[1:19:36] minister and he that is greatest among
[1:19:39] you be the servant of them all
[1:19:42] and we have seen today that are more our
[1:19:45] Modern Trend of Christianity it says is
[1:19:48] I'm somebody of and you're nothing
[1:19:51] oh it's wrong it shouldn't be that way
[1:19:53] we are trying to reflect Christianity in
[1:19:56] the wrong way God doesn't want us to do
[1:19:59] it that way we sing the song to be like
[1:20:02] Jesus but when it comes to Humble our
[1:20:05] pride and to get down like he did then
[1:20:09] we draw the line and in do it so man has
[1:20:12] formed the nominations that that can
[1:20:15] separate themselves seeming not having
[1:20:18] the spirit as the scripture says they
[1:20:22] separate themselves we belong to a
[1:20:24] certain Church our church it says uh
[1:20:27] it's a bigger church it's a it's a
[1:20:29] better Church a denomination is a
[1:20:31] greater denomination that doesn't act
[1:20:33] like Jesus that doesn't reflect his love
[1:20:37] and his personality
[1:20:41] that doesn't reflect this love and his
[1:20:44] personality he came to the lowest he
[1:20:47] came to the street Harlot he came to the
[1:20:50] beggar he came to the bum and got right
[1:20:52] down in the dust of them that's the
[1:20:55] Christian Life that's the way it should
[1:20:57] be to reflect them in that way oh I know
[1:21:01] people say that these days are past
[1:21:03] it isn't
[1:21:05] it if Christ do remains Christ if his
[1:21:08] spirit is still the holy spirit that was
[1:21:11] in him being you it'll make you take
[1:21:14] that position too
[1:21:16] but today we try to think that we're
[1:21:18] different
[1:21:19] how far it is from his prayer when he
[1:21:22] prayed that this would all men know that
[1:21:24] ye that that we were his disciples when
[1:21:27] we have love for one another and instead
[1:21:30] of that we fuss at one another we
[1:21:32] despise one another we don't agree upon
[1:21:34] the certain things and we go out and
[1:21:35] accuse each other see and yet claim to
[1:21:38] be Christians I know people who claim to
[1:21:41] be filled with the Holy Spirit is guilty
[1:21:44] of such things going out and really
[1:21:46] saying evil things about the other
[1:21:48] Christians when they ought not to do
[1:21:50] those things now brother sister when we
[1:21:55] have that kind of spirit we might as
[1:21:57] well get it in our mind that we're not
[1:21:58] Christians yet
[1:22:01] no matter how much we confess it's what
[1:22:04] we possess that counts we cannot be
[1:22:07] Christians and not love all people we
[1:22:11] might differ with people but Jesus
[1:22:13] didn't put it and say well now hear all
[1:22:16] you Pharisees you're going to hell and
[1:22:18] there's no chance for you because of
[1:22:20] this that or the other because you're a
[1:22:22] Pharisee because it says but he went to
[1:22:25] them and he ministered to them and
[1:22:27] helped them and he done everything that
[1:22:29] he could to help them
[1:22:32] but today education and church
[1:22:34] membership and ties of the world has
[1:22:37] brought this church together in such a
[1:22:39] way until the intellectual has taken
[1:22:41] place of the spiritual
[1:22:43] you cannot get to God except by the
[1:22:47] spirit
[1:22:48] that's the only way that you a man can
[1:22:51] come to God and not through the Holy
[1:22:53] Spirit Jesus said no man can come to me
[1:22:56] except of Joy the father draws him first
[1:22:59] that's just as true as can be Christians
[1:23:02] we want to take a little notebook
[1:23:04] tonight in our heart and count up all
[1:23:07] these things
[1:23:08] Lord let me count up all these things
[1:23:13] let's think of this oh some of us claim
[1:23:16] to have all the knowledge we have to say
[1:23:19] now wait thy love it says they love to
[1:23:21] be doctors and holy fathers and so forth
[1:23:24] but knowing it says knowing of all this
[1:23:27] If he if you had all the knowledge it
[1:23:31] wouldn't do you any good except you had
[1:23:33] a spirit in you of love
[1:23:37] the Bible said though I know do I have
[1:23:39] all the knowledge and not have charity
[1:23:41] I'm nothing
[1:23:43] and what God what good does it what good
[1:23:46] does our knowledge do when someone says
[1:23:49] I wouldn't go to a Revival like that
[1:23:51] because those are not educated people I
[1:23:54] wouldn't associate with them no matter
[1:23:55] whether they don't know their ABCs or
[1:23:58] not they can know Christ certainly you
[1:24:02] can never get too low
[1:24:04] you can never he says you never can get
[1:24:07] too low may God always give that spirit
[1:24:10] in me no matter how what he believes
[1:24:14] what he does what Creed what color what
[1:24:16] I want to I want says I want to reach a
[1:24:20] hand and to help me because he says sure
[1:24:23] I want that Spirit In Me
[1:24:26] I will not think I'm better than
[1:24:28] somebody else
[1:24:29] and this is a prophet speaking this
[1:24:32] yes this is this Prophet taking the
[1:24:34] position
[1:24:35] from his from his perspective and how he
[1:24:38] looks at the word
[1:24:40] now
[1:24:42] if
[1:24:43] the First Brethren that was born among
[1:24:46] many brethren in our time
[1:24:49] born in a manger
[1:24:54] came into this world trying to
[1:24:56] understand God
[1:24:58] and by the sufferings of his life he
[1:25:02] learned obedient in the love of God and
[1:25:05] you know one thing that the devil tell
[1:25:06] him told them
[1:25:08] when he was dealing with Sharon Rose and
[1:25:10] he went into that depression he told
[1:25:12] them God don't love you you see
[1:25:14] he went directly to where he could
[1:25:17] attack him
[1:25:19] God don't love you
[1:25:21] but God loves you
[1:25:24] because there's still Mercy there's
[1:25:25] still Grace and if he Reveals His love
[1:25:28] to you then you should be a vessel
[1:25:32] filled with the spirit of God
[1:25:36] Isaiah 57 15 says
[1:25:40] for thus say at the high and lofty one
[1:25:43] that inhabited eternity
[1:25:47] whose name is Holy
[1:25:49] I dwell in the high and the holy place
[1:25:52] with him
[1:25:53] also that is of a contrite and humble
[1:25:57] spirit
[1:25:59] to revive the spirit of the humble
[1:26:02] and to revive the heart of the contract
[1:26:05] ones
[1:26:06] to revive the spirit of the humble and
[1:26:09] to revive the heart of the contract ones
[1:26:12] and so you see how God hides himself in
[1:26:16] humility you know brother Bram says that
[1:26:18] he preaches God hides himself in
[1:26:20] Simplicity in 1963 and as he's preaching
[1:26:23] God hiding himself in Simplicity the
[1:26:25] whole time he's talking about humility
[1:26:28] because it's never so hard to be so
[1:26:31] simple so simple that you don't miss God
[1:26:34] because God is simple
[1:26:36] God is simple
[1:26:40] Luke 6 says it this way and I'm applying
[1:26:43] this to my I'm applying this to my faith
[1:26:46] I'm applying this to to
[1:26:48] understanding that God wants us mature
[1:26:52] God wants us mature in his word
[1:26:55] God wants us to know what we're talking
[1:26:58] about God wants us to understand that if
[1:27:01] something was to come and our foundation
[1:27:03] has been said nothing would move the
[1:27:06] Bride of Jesus Christ because she is not
[1:27:08] like the one that was in the beginning
[1:27:09] because there has been a Ministry that
[1:27:12] has come forward that has perfected her
[1:27:14] that has got her to a point where now
[1:27:16] she could stand for what she is and now
[1:27:18] from the very revelation of the word no
[1:27:21] matter what man say she only hears the
[1:27:25] voice of God
[1:27:27] because it's that that brings her into
[1:27:29] the maturity and the character of the
[1:27:32] firstborn that was among many Brethren
[1:27:34] and if the spirit of a prophet
[1:27:37] if the spirit of a prophet
[1:27:40] as uh you know I I know that sometimes
[1:27:44] um
[1:27:46] it's hard to say even for myself you
[1:27:49] know just being as young as I am that I
[1:27:51] can say that I've seen William Branham
[1:27:53] in the in our days I can't say that but
[1:27:55] you know what I can say
[1:27:58] by the revelation of the message I can
[1:28:00] see what he was going through and how he
[1:28:03] was able to obtain the stature of a
[1:28:05] perfect man because we're going through
[1:28:07] it
[1:28:07] and I can testify and see yes I have
[1:28:10] seen what he's seen because now it's
[1:28:12] fulfilling today in this hour and I can
[1:28:15] testify of the very word that God is
[1:28:17] doing lifting our faith up because
[1:28:20] that's what we need to have
[1:28:23] to be changed in the moment in the
[1:28:25] twinkling of an eye in humility to the
[1:28:27] word it brings us up
[1:28:30] it brings us up
[1:28:32] Luke says Luke says 6 verse 40. the
[1:28:36] disciples it says the disciple is not
[1:28:38] above his master
[1:28:40] but everyone that is perfect shall be as
[1:28:43] his master
[1:28:45] so everyone that is perfect shall be
[1:28:47] like his master
[1:28:49] and why behold it says why behold this
[1:28:51] doubt the moat and thy brother's eye but
[1:28:54] perceive is not the being in thy own eye
[1:28:58] either how can thou no say to thy
[1:29:02] brother brother let me pull out the moat
[1:29:05] that is in thine eye when thou thyself
[1:29:08] behold thus not the beam that is in your
[1:29:10] own eye
[1:29:11] thou hypocrite it says cast out first
[1:29:15] The Beam out of thine own eye and then
[1:29:17] shall thou See Clearly to pull out the
[1:29:20] moat that is in thy brother's eye for a
[1:29:23] good tree
[1:29:24] bring it not for corrupt fruit
[1:29:28] neither there a corrupt tree bring forth
[1:29:32] good fruit for every tree is known by
[1:29:35] its fruit
[1:29:37] four of thorns of man do not gather figs
[1:29:40] or it says nor of of a of a Bramble Bush
[1:29:44] gathered their grapes a good man out of
[1:29:48] the good Treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:29:49] forth that which is good and an evil man
[1:29:52] out of the evil Treasure of his heart
[1:29:55] bringeth forth that which is evil for
[1:29:57] although the it says of the abundance of
[1:30:00] the heart his mouth speaking
[1:30:03] and why call ye Me Lord
[1:30:07] Lord
[1:30:08] and do not the things which I say
[1:30:13] whosoever cometh to me and hear it my
[1:30:16] saying and do with them
[1:30:19] I will show you to whom he is like and
[1:30:23] then he goes
[1:30:24] into
[1:30:26] the subject of having your foundation
[1:30:28] settled
[1:30:30] because if we say we believe the word we
[1:30:33] must also act as the word says we should
[1:30:36] be
[1:30:37] it's a life now that no longer could
[1:30:39] remain on paper because the Bride of
[1:30:41] Jesus Christ she is an epistle that has
[1:30:44] been written and read of all men and she
[1:30:48] is the Bride of Jesus Christ reflecting
[1:30:51] The Same Spirit like Jesus Christ
[1:30:53] there's no difference between them two
[1:30:54] this is what brother Branham says and
[1:30:57] now the spirit of Love which was Jesus
[1:31:00] Christ himself is expressing now I must
[1:31:04] decrease
[1:31:06] so he must increase Perfection by
[1:31:09] humility
[1:31:10] because we want nothing but the word of
[1:31:13] God
[1:31:14] I want nothing but the word of God
[1:31:22] John 13
[1:31:25] and this is going it's just I'll be
[1:31:28] finished here quickly I'm not going to
[1:31:30] be long we have communion
[1:31:33] but this is the scripture of the foot
[1:31:36] washing
[1:31:37] verse 12 it says so after he had washed
[1:31:41] their feet now Jesus Christ himself
[1:31:44] sitting in a room with the son of
[1:31:46] perdition
[1:31:47] Jesus Christ himself sitting in the room
[1:31:50] with Judas the Son of Perdition and he
[1:31:52] humbled himself to wash his feet
[1:31:55] he humbled himself to show the act of
[1:32:00] love
[1:32:01] to no matter what your position is God
[1:32:05] wants us to reflect love all the time
[1:32:09] so he says and he take he had taken His
[1:32:13] Garment and was set down again and he
[1:32:15] said unto them know he what I have done
[1:32:18] to you
[1:32:19] the example
[1:32:21] of Jesus Christ the love of God Jesus
[1:32:26] Christ was the love of God a hundred
[1:32:29] percent man and a hundred percent God
[1:32:31] the prophet says
[1:32:32] and he put his flesh so low that it
[1:32:35] didn't matter what man or a people
[1:32:37] thought of who he was be but he would
[1:32:39] fulfill the very work he sent to be
[1:32:42] because he was to manifest every word
[1:32:45] and every scripture that was prophesied
[1:32:48] of himself
[1:32:49] and so is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:51] supposed to get the very word that is
[1:32:55] prophesied for this hour to be able to
[1:32:58] manifest it it says he called me master
[1:33:01] and Lord and he say well for so I am if
[1:33:04] I then your Lord and Master have washed
[1:33:06] your feet ye are also to wash another's
[1:33:09] feet
[1:33:10] for I have given you an example that you
[1:33:13] should do as I've done to you
[1:33:16] Awakening Jesus brother Benham says this
[1:33:18] in 1963 he says Jesus invited them to do
[1:33:21] it
[1:33:22] he did he says if he didn't meet every
[1:33:25] qualification of Messiah then you tell
[1:33:27] me where I've missed them it says it
[1:33:30] says that's good isn't it tell me where
[1:33:32] I've missed it if I didn't meet the
[1:33:34] qualifications if I did I haven't done
[1:33:37] exactly what the scripture said that I
[1:33:40] would do it says o Christians if we
[1:33:42] would line ourselves up and there do
[1:33:45] what the scripture says that Christians
[1:33:47] should do
[1:33:48] they should have it says they should
[1:33:51] have known he was God of creation and he
[1:33:55] says he was the very one that created
[1:33:58] the water and the wind and they should
[1:34:01] have known that and if they know that he
[1:34:05] was that did they not understand that
[1:34:08] this creation of the Creator would have
[1:34:11] to obey his word
[1:34:14] he says oh my if he created it who's the
[1:34:18] greatest the creation or the Creator
[1:34:20] like Jesus said who is the greatest that
[1:34:24] is is it he that is sent or he that has
[1:34:27] sent him
[1:34:29] which is the greatest the creation or
[1:34:31] the Creator the Creator then they seen
[1:34:35] and he proved and he was the creator and
[1:34:39] then if he was the creator
[1:34:42] would not his creation obey him
[1:34:46] let us remember also that he created our
[1:34:49] bodies when our bodies come obey his
[1:34:52] command
[1:34:53] spirit is to spit out that cancer it
[1:34:57] says he says to the body and away it
[1:35:00] goes you just take that word and plant
[1:35:03] it in there and and see what happens yes
[1:35:05] sir our bodies has to obey his command
[1:35:09] you say you're a Christian I believe you
[1:35:12] are you believe it says what are you
[1:35:15] resting in someday you raise our bodies
[1:35:18] up after they've absolutely completely
[1:35:21] perished if you don't believe that then
[1:35:24] why do you go to church if there's no
[1:35:26] Resurrection are we amongst man most
[1:35:30] miserable but his word is a promise he
[1:35:34] that believeth in me though we were dead
[1:35:36] though he says yeah he shall live amen I
[1:35:39] am the resurrection in life amen he that
[1:35:42] it's my flesh and drinks my blood as it
[1:35:44] has eternal life and I'll raise them up
[1:35:46] at my last day
[1:35:47] it says my it says the body the ashes
[1:35:51] the volcanic ashes that were made out of
[1:35:54] it says obey his command because he's
[1:35:57] the creator of it
[1:35:59] the life that's within us is not only a
[1:36:03] creative life but it's part of his own
[1:36:06] life that's the reason we have the
[1:36:08] authority to speak to a devil because
[1:36:11] it's God's Own created life if you're
[1:36:14] anointed see correct now you it says
[1:36:18] it's not you that speaketh but it's the
[1:36:21] father that dwells in you take no
[1:36:23] thought what you'll say it'll be added
[1:36:26] at that time just go on stay with them I
[1:36:29] love that amen
[1:36:32] amen
[1:36:34] I'll close here I just wanted to read
[1:36:37] this last quote
[1:36:42] brother Bantam reads this and humble
[1:36:43] thyself 1963.
[1:36:47] you know there's there's a point where
[1:36:53] the devil will always try to come and
[1:36:55] influence the flesh
[1:36:57] and it's always deceiving
[1:37:00] it always brings that feeling of
[1:37:02] uncomfortable of being uncomfortable
[1:37:04] always makes you where you're in fear it
[1:37:07] always makes you sit back where you're
[1:37:09] like well now I'm unsettled what
[1:37:11] decision should I make where should I go
[1:37:13] what should I do well the Lord told me
[1:37:15] I'm Healed but why why why why why am I
[1:37:18] not believing why is there not something
[1:37:19] inside of me to believe
[1:37:21] and then and then all of a sudden God
[1:37:24] just comes and he's he strikes his word
[1:37:26] to us and by the revealed word you're
[1:37:28] like oh now I have hope
[1:37:29] Lord You've spoken to me you're giving
[1:37:32] me life you're giving me something that
[1:37:34] I could overcome by now I want to obey
[1:37:37] that word that has been revealed by the
[1:37:40] love of God because as I walk in it I'm
[1:37:43] also walking in the footsteps of his his
[1:37:45] path that he wants me to walk in
[1:37:48] it's obeying and humbling ourselves to
[1:37:51] the word
[1:37:53] because that's what he did
[1:37:55] Jesus Christ came not only to live the
[1:37:59] life in the flesh
[1:38:01] to show the character truly that we can
[1:38:04] identify with
[1:38:05] but he came and resurrected so that same
[1:38:09] spirit that overcame there could also be
[1:38:11] in us to overcome now that's why we
[1:38:13] can't be deceived that's why the Bride
[1:38:15] of Jesus Christ cannot be deceived
[1:38:17] because she is born of his bone and
[1:38:19] flesh of his flesh and spirit of his
[1:38:21] spirit amen
[1:38:24] brother bam says this and says I was
[1:38:25] thinking here
[1:38:27] of a little illustration
[1:38:30] it says to back up what he said he says
[1:38:33] now we look at this watch
[1:38:36] we find out what time it is
[1:38:38] unless that every instrument in that
[1:38:41] watch is coordinating one with another
[1:38:43] will never know the correct time
[1:38:48] is that right
[1:38:49] and it takes all of us together all
[1:38:52] together if we want to see the third
[1:38:55] pool
[1:38:56] really do something for God it's
[1:38:59] coordination with every one of us
[1:39:02] together to Humble ourselves before God
[1:39:05] and confess our wrongs and pray and
[1:39:08] believe God for these things
[1:39:11] he says I truly believe that what
[1:39:14] brother Vale said is the truth that God
[1:39:17] will never put his Spirit into an Unholy
[1:39:20] unrighteous disobedient Temple it says
[1:39:22] no it's got to come in the way of the
[1:39:25] cleansing of our heart from Argyle and
[1:39:27] iniquity that we might be pure before
[1:39:30] God that we might work he's pure Holy
[1:39:32] Spirit through us to bring these things
[1:39:35] to pass I think that when you go home
[1:39:37] tonight if you just read that little
[1:39:39] book of Jude you'll just you'll just
[1:39:42] learn a lot a whole lot now what brother
[1:39:45] Vale has said it says I earnestly
[1:39:48] contend for the faith that was once
[1:39:51] delivered to the Saints they got away
[1:39:53] from it how man of corrupt minds and so
[1:39:56] forth had come in and beguiled them away
[1:39:59] from the word it says from the real
[1:40:02] things of God it says and God can only
[1:40:05] operate as we let him operate and
[1:40:09] there's so many wonderful things he
[1:40:10] always says this it says you know people
[1:40:12] want power and really they don't know
[1:40:16] what power is see they don't really know
[1:40:18] what it is and what goes with it
[1:40:21] the Way Up Is Down always if you want
[1:40:25] Power see how humble you can get just
[1:40:28] get away from all your worldly thinking
[1:40:30] and humble yourself before God and then
[1:40:33] you've got more power than a man runs
[1:40:36] around the whole building and making a
[1:40:38] bunch of noise he says see because you
[1:40:40] have been able to conquer yourself
[1:40:45] because you have been able to conquer
[1:40:47] yourself and commit yourself to Christ
[1:40:50] you see to humble yourself before him
[1:40:53] that's real power
[1:40:56] you show me a church that's humble real
[1:40:59] Humber not an arrogant City not a church
[1:41:01] it says not an arrogancy a church just a
[1:41:04] sweet Humble Church and I'll show you a
[1:41:07] church that has the favor of and power
[1:41:10] of God in it that's right that's the
[1:41:13] thing it takes humility humbling
[1:41:16] ourselves before God letting God just
[1:41:19] work through us don't have to make a lot
[1:41:21] of noise
[1:41:22] let's just bow our heads
[1:41:28] father you're you've been so good to us
[1:41:33] your word has been
[1:41:37] so good to us Lord
[1:41:39] lord it's it's life Lord
[1:41:42] it's not just words that are on a paper
[1:41:45] but Lord the very message of the hour
[1:41:48] that we believe is the is the very
[1:41:50] person of who you are through Jesus
[1:41:53] Christ
[1:41:54] Lord that character
[1:41:56] the one that that didn't even have a
[1:41:59] place to lay his head
[1:42:01] that he was looking more of the needs of
[1:42:03] others than he was looking on the needs
[1:42:04] of himself
[1:42:05] he was more of a servant than he was
[1:42:07] served too he humbled himself in so much
[1:42:10] that he was praying day and night Lord I
[1:42:14] can save and in this generation you've
[1:42:16] shown this Same Spirit revealed to the
[1:42:18] prophet messenger of this age Lord you
[1:42:21] showed us what it's like to live a life
[1:42:24] according to the word in humility and
[1:42:27] love and peace and unity Lord
[1:42:29] Lord I pray tonight that you just grow
[1:42:33] us into the statue of a perfect man and
[1:42:36] as we gain more love that you give us
[1:42:38] more character Lord because we want to
[1:42:40] have the character of the world inside
[1:42:42] of us
[1:42:43] Lord I pray tonight that you just bless
[1:42:45] the remaining of our service Lord are
[1:42:47] you just blessed the bride of Christ
[1:42:49] Lord just the way that she's getting
[1:42:51] ready just the way that she's expecting
[1:42:53] you Lord just the way that she she's
[1:42:55] she's gaining her oil and her
[1:42:57] candlesticks and she's waiting for you
[1:42:59] Lord because you're coming to get us out
[1:43:01] of here Lord we'll be changed in a
[1:43:03] moment in a twinkle of an eye and and
[1:43:05] the prophet says that it'll be so sweet
[1:43:08] it'll be so humble that the people would
[1:43:09] even know
[1:43:11] that it happened
[1:43:13] Lord give us the spirit of Love let us
[1:43:16] unite each other in the spirit of of God
[1:43:19] that's in our meds we love you we just
[1:43:21] commit the rest of the service now into
[1:43:22] your hands in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:43:25] pray amen
[1:43:39] amen
[1:43:41] I really like that
[1:43:43] I really really like that
[1:43:46] I I and I just hope
[1:43:49] when we hear a word like that
[1:43:52] we can make it a collective effort all
[1:43:55] of us together
[1:43:56] to be that that representative of that
[1:43:59] church we just heard I because I I
[1:44:03] believe with all my heart is the desire
[1:44:05] even of our pastor we are not built on
[1:44:09] big and small great shows we we are
[1:44:13] trying we are taught to be built on the
[1:44:17] very Foundation where real people can
[1:44:20] come with real need and be touched by
[1:44:22] God where we are not ashamed to say I
[1:44:26] have a problem I have a need and I need
[1:44:28] God to comment not where you know we get
[1:44:31] the the spiritual on one side and the
[1:44:33] non-spiritual no a group of people that
[1:44:36] can humble themselves by the word that's
[1:44:38] been sent by a messenger and really
[1:44:41] receiving and be molded into the church
[1:44:44] we just heard of that's really my heart
[1:44:47] desire
[1:44:48] no big guys no little use no show off
[1:44:52] not what I know what I don't know but
[1:44:55] God being the leader coming and moving
[1:44:58] in our midst to do according to his
[1:45:00] promise I like that the Way Up Is Down
[1:45:03] you know it's always humble it's always
[1:45:06] looking it's always I believe in I truly
[1:45:09] believe each one here big or small young
[1:45:12] and old God has a place for you a
[1:45:15] position for you to play
[1:45:17] and and I think oftentimes when we say
[1:45:19] that people think it's just maybe coming
[1:45:21] to the front or doing something no it
[1:45:24] could be something behind the scenes it
[1:45:26] could be in your closet on your knees
[1:45:29] you're praying for the body you're
[1:45:31] praying for a need you're praying for
[1:45:32] something each one can play a role where
[1:45:35] we can really become the mighty Army but
[1:45:38] we have to work together not against one
[1:45:41] another we have to support one another
[1:45:43] not criticize one another and I believe
[1:45:46] that's really where God has taken us
[1:45:48] brother Cosman mentioned something that
[1:45:51] it was just you know but one of them
[1:45:53] says God proves his word by believers
[1:45:57] and he makes a statement he said
[1:45:59] wouldn't it be nice for him after the
[1:46:02] resurrection he would have went to
[1:46:04] pilate and said you see what I told you
[1:46:07] was the truth you see I I told you that
[1:46:10] I came and I was gonna die in a but when
[1:46:12] I said even if it did that they wouldn't
[1:46:14] believe him
[1:46:19] why because when he came at the first
[1:46:22] time when he spoke they didn't believe
[1:46:24] they would find another reason not to
[1:46:27] believe even after he showed up oh
[1:46:29] that's a ghost oh that's not really him
[1:46:32] oh he really didn't die isn't that what
[1:46:34] they said but a believer that believed
[1:46:37] the first time he will believe the
[1:46:39] second time you believe the third time
[1:46:41] it is there to always believe and that's
[1:46:44] why God proves his word by Believers and
[1:46:47] I believe we are here for us to be that
[1:46:49] group of people that God can come and
[1:46:52] prove his word by amen if the we'll have
[1:46:55] the brothers just get the communion
[1:46:57] ready let's just open our communion
[1:47:00] scripture at this time
[1:47:17] thank you
[1:47:27] and I sit stand and read it first
[1:47:30] Corinthians chapter the 20 uh sorry the
[1:47:34] 11th chapter the 23rd verse
[1:47:44] he said for I have received of the Lord
[1:47:46] that which I have also deliver unto you
[1:47:48] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:47:50] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:47:53] and when he had given tanks he had taken
[1:47:55] it and said take it this is my body
[1:47:58] which is broken for you
[1:48:01] do this in remembrance of me and after
[1:48:04] the same manner he also took the cup
[1:48:07] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:48:10] the New Testament in my blood do this do
[1:48:13] ye as of as ye drink it in remembrance
[1:48:16] of me
[1:48:18] for as of as ye eat this bread and drink
[1:48:21] this cup you do show the Lord's death
[1:48:24] till he come
[1:48:26] wherefore whatsoever shall eat of this
[1:48:28] bread and drink of this cup
[1:48:31] of the Lord and worthily shall be guilty
[1:48:34] of the blood and the body of the Lord
[1:48:36] but let every man examine himself so let
[1:48:38] him eat of this bread and drink of that
[1:48:41] cup
[1:48:42] it says for he that eateth and drink it
[1:48:45] unworthily eat it and drinking damnation
[1:48:47] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:48:50] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:48:53] sickly among you and many sleep
[1:48:55] he says for if if for if we would be
[1:48:59] judged if we will judge ourselves we
[1:49:02] should not be judged but when we are
[1:49:05] judged
[1:49:06] we are chasing of the Lord that we
[1:49:09] should not be condemned with the world
[1:49:12] wherefore Brethren when ye come together
[1:49:15] to eat
[1:49:17] tarry one for another
[1:49:19] is that humility again
[1:49:22] Terry one for another don't just look
[1:49:24] and you know don't don't have this
[1:49:26] attitude that one shouldn't eat that one
[1:49:29] over there shouldn't eat you don't know
[1:49:31] what's going on with their lives you
[1:49:33] don't know if they ask forgiveness
[1:49:34] before they came you don't know what if
[1:49:37] they made it you don't know anything
[1:49:39] all you have to do is come and tarry one
[1:49:42] for another you know the but it makes it
[1:49:45] I said we we should always we should
[1:49:48] always try to avoid because there's
[1:49:50] things we have to understand but when I
[1:49:52] said it's not the man it's the it's the
[1:49:55] devil even if someone does your wrong
[1:49:58] don't take the man and throw him with
[1:50:00] his hair understand that it's the devil
[1:50:03] that caused him to do that so the goal
[1:50:05] is always to preserve your brother it's
[1:50:08] never to cast them out the goal is
[1:50:10] always to preserve
[1:50:12] it says tarry one for another
[1:50:15] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:50:18] home that ye come not together unto
[1:50:20] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[1:50:22] order where to come
[1:50:24] hey man let's just pray
[1:50:32] our gracious father we're so thankful
