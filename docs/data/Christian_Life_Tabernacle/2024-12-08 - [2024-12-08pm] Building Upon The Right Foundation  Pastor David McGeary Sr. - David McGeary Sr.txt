pring preaching he kind of touched on that subject so I was just like well let me just give it um so this testimony is not just mine but it's my sister's it's my family's testimony sort of to say um so um one of my young sisters was applying to come out to study for school and um so she went for her interviews uh for the viser she went the first time she was denied uh was not given any good reason to why she was denied she was just told she doesn't meet the requirements and so she kind of It kind of it was stressful for her sort of to say so she went back home um we decided to try again she went again the second time but um I think God had worked on her the second time she went cuz she went there they denied her again um didn't give her any reason was basically like okay the first one refused you so the second one I'm going to say no as well um so she went back home and she said well God your plan is bigger than mine and um if this is not the route you want me to take I'll still praise you and so as she was seated home um not too long after she received a phone call and um so she thought I don't know this number so I'm not going to pick it up uh but she had something upon her heart that was like just pick up the phone just pick up the phone so she picks up the phone and um so they asked her is this Miriam uh she was like yes this is she and they were like this is the US Embassy and are you available to come by tomorrow she was like okay I I am so she goes by the next day and uh not knowing what to take or anything she just took everything she had taken to her interviews and this day when she went this was a day of like collections it was not a day for interviews so she was not scheduled for an interview and this does not happen back home so for you to get interviewed you need to schedule that means you need to pay for it she didn't pay for anything she was called by the US Embassy and they don't do that and so she went there um she joined the line she was like yes I'm Miram I was called yesterday they were she was thought well just join the line and the lady who interviewed her on this day was there the next day when she was called so she was like oh I wonder what's happening so people were collecting their um um visas and stuff like that and um I don't know why but the lady in front of her did not collect hers and so here Miriam doesn't know what to think but she goes up she's asked a few questions so she was telling me she said she looked at the lady the lady looked at um the rejected pal and she looked over on the other side she looked at Miriam and she just told her well come back and collect your Visa so I'm just grateful if God saw her here God Prov it away and I'm just going to sing a short chorus uh just to to thank him for

all so there is a saying everything is bigger in Texas right so all you have to do is to take a road trip besides Texas go different states and when we come back to Texas we will find out that yes that is true so we we were able to experience that and I thank God for brother jman he was planning of going to noa's Arc and he thought of our family he extended the invite and we said yes and uh we were able to also go to brother brenham's Tabernacle and uh vgr so that is something that I want to share share something with you um sister has sung such a beautiful song count your blessings and our text testimony is a combination of uh of our um blessings and when we testify to the church and uh I was saying no all the way and then brother jman says no brother you're coming I said okay that settles it so something has happened and that's something I wanted to share with you brother David uh meui I was able to like from the heart I want um I was able to recognize what he does when he plays the cape and uh and the and the respect he has for the word of God there was a time when noa's was NOA was building an ark lot of work was being done at that time and uh there was a time the ark was done midone and there was the time when Ark was completed in Noah's time and Bible says says as it was in the days of NOA so shall be in the day of the son of man and when we went to see Noah's Ark in Kentucky it was like four story high least I know that just by simply taking the trip God was constantly talking to me if the Bible says it will happen like it was the day in NOA I truly believe it will happen when we went to grr this was not Brothers jman's um uh I believe there was his fourth visit to vgr and brother jman testified that brother when we came that vgr it was like a 18 wheer trucks used to be there and there was a there was a material that's been shipped out to the World Church here in United States and brother brisal in Canada so they were doing lot of lot work throughout the globe and we went I testify and I am testifying in front of you if you go to vgr the roads are like there's nothing going on there what I want to tell you is noar Ark is done the time is the door is about to close if we cannot see it as a bride PR and uh uh it is it is a blessing that God has opened our eyes and our ears we can see recognize the message we can hear the message God has given us the opportunity we were able to go to that little little office of brother brunham his table two chairs we talk about humble experience and uh you know like churches today my goodness like millions and billions of dollar of the of the elevated buildings we see and you you blink an eye and you will miss that Brenham Tabernacle that's how tiny humble it is and I just want to encourage you as uh uh and I and uh I want to tell sister Leslie as well and Brother David and and all the congregation here uh that um that we are in such a good space and um you just have to believe it that uh the time is so so near we just have to believe that anytime that door is about to shut and uh it's is literally a time of uh five virgins and five has that extra oil that extra oil is nothing but the Holy Spirit the token that will take us to the eternal life so that was just my humbling experience and I just wanted to share this with God bless you all well thank you thank you let's pray thank you Lord for this beautiful day you have given Lord thank you that you have mercy on us Lord without your the work that you had done for us on the cross of Calvary Lord because of the token under your blood that extra oil needed in our lamp that Holy Spirit Lord thank you for opening our eyes that we can see that the time is so near the world will continue to to do what is doing there will be marriages there will be a food there'll be parties there will be everything and the bride will be gone the the the church will go into the tribulation but the Enoch will be lifted Lord we are the Enoch we are the bride Lord I pray that you would just give us that uh that the faith that uh the the spirit to lift up our wings so when you come Lord we'll be able to take that flight

this generation sending us a Messengers to bring us back to that Foundation Lord we ask this evening that you would bless our service in our effort to evening and that the heart of the believer will be touched and father that they'd ever be fortified in the trust that we can place in you that you'll take care of us and that you will not leave us nor forsake us father we ask you to forgive us our sins and our doubt and help us grow more in your presence that we can be used father For Your Glory we ask these things in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you if you open your Bibles and turn with me uh to Ezekiel and I I I just uh am going to um I can't certainly can't add to any that was said this morning I did uh uh enjoy it and received inspiration uh from it and uh we just like to point out some of the things that stood up out to me and uh and Trust it' be a a blessing to you you love the Lord amen he's he's good to us and uh he's going to stick with us that's the one thing you know I've certainly done a lot of things in my life that I thought would scare him away and uh and sure enough he's comes back every time you know and he finds me and and when I try to hide uh it's no need trying to play hide and seek with the Lord because he knows where you're at and you know when uh it just he just that way and I I appreciate that about him so if you read let's start with U uh um the 10th verse and we're going to try to derive a little something from this and then we'll uh read another scripture found in numbers of of 14 and four but we'll read that later on he says let us read what he says here because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there is no was no peace and one built upon a wall and loow others dabbed it with untempered mortar saying unto them which dab it with untempered mortar that it shall that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye oh great hailstones shall fall and the stormy wind shall rent it and lo when the wall is Fallen shall it not be said unto you where is the dab dabbing wherewith ye dabbed it therefore thus saith the Lord God I will rent it with stormy winds in my Fury and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger and great hailstones in my Fury to consume it so will I break it down the wall that ye have dabbed with untempered mortar and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that I am the Lord God I am the Lord heavenly father bless your word in your precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated you know something that um stood out to me and um and I'm I'm uh just when I read the scriptures and I listen to our messenger preach one of the things that I always search for is principles by which God does things there are certain principles that God has that and and all his principles and all all the decisions he makes are all for his children uh because he's a loving father and that's why he created us in the first place that he could reveal himself and have fellowship and he can do these things so he abides by certain principles of course one of the principles that he abides by is that he's not a respector of persons so his Mercy is extended to who never will accept his Mercy his forgiveness is given to anyone who will repent there he doesn't he doesn't turn his heart against any man because of his upbringing because of the color of his skin because of his education there there's nothing that he holds uh back if a man will meet him on the the provided terms he'll meet that man on those terms every time he he doesn't consider one person above another uh uh he is fair and just to all uh he doesn't he doesn't hold a a grudge you know if he forgives you you're forgiven you you don't have to worry about you're going to get punished for it down the road and and oh you know if you've done something and you've made it right it it's right you don't have to worry about the consequences of that you don't have to sit back and and and worry if there's judgment coming down the road if you accept a pardon it's a pardon you know if the if the prison do has been opened and and you're set free you you don't have to worry that that crime is going to come back and imprison you again that's a principle that uh in life if you begin to understand these principles God's placed them there all for a reason the biggest trouble we of course have is we have an adversary we have a devil he's a liar and he perverts the word of God and he he comes as an angel of Light and and you know all that he's all in your best interest but uh the truth of the matter is when you anchor yourself in the principles of God it's it's good another principle that we know and understand is that God doesn't change his mind if if he he does something one time you can count on it every single time he doesn't he doesn't progress in the way that we would think of progressing uh he doesn't uh say try something and say oh it didn't work I'll I'll try something a little better no he knows exactly what he's doing you can you can actually sit back and and rest on that if he's ever done one thing one way you can just hold on to that that that he'll stay that way the whole time and so we we find out that there's principles that are laid out uh through the word of God and and kind of when I was listening to brother Matthew this morning as he was evangelizing the Gospel to and reaching out and and touching souls and and a lot of people who have have kind of gone astray or went back in the world a little bit it seemed like the Lord was reaching out to them and setting their hearts on fire again to try to come back to God that's what we want we don't want to leave one person behind we don't want to judge somebody and point fingers at somebody we want to hold them up in prayer uh you know because so that our our goal is to leave here and to have every person that it is here waiting for his great coming to be in the best possible condition that they can be in for that day and as was Reas reading this I I I I thought of this principle that kind of stood out to me in the scriptures if you would bear with me in my Folly this evening and and uh and it was what the Lord said here when he began to preach this he said uh uh if I can find it here he said so so will I break down the wall that ye have dabbed with untempered mortar and I don't want to go into all what untempered mortar is I think you're spiritual enough to understand that's things that you put in the building that don't belong there that won't hold up but he says here he says and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered and and I I I realized that that through the preaching of the word of God that a lot of Christians and a lot of people they they've never built on the right foundation so in your life if if if you're you're trying to build a life for the Lord and let's put everything on a positive Viewpoint you're trying to do your best you're trying to build your your life for the Lord you you're you're wanting to live right you're wanting to do right but the Lord understands something he says that if you don't build it on the right foundation when the storm comes and the wind comes it'll blow away and that's why in the gospel he preached about the man that builds his foundation on Sand he said when the storm comes it won't it won't stand but you got to build it on on that Solid Rock and what happens to us a lot of Christians we we we we put untempered mortar in our our walls and we we have things placed within our life and we never were really securely founded in the right thing and and so as as we begin to to go through our lives and and and we go go through our experience as a Christian we we come to to places that we think well I've been a Christian for so long time really is not one of God's principles he really you know he doesn't it it doesn't matter to him he doesn't care how long it takes for him to get to his end because he he's Eternal he has all time he has everything that he ever needs to do what he wants to do with so he can work on you for a long long time he can leave you go for a long long time he can do whatever he wants to do but when he decides to move he moves and so a lot of times in our Christian lives we go for a long long time as a Christian and then we find out that that if if what we have and what we built on won't meet the challenge of the age God in his Mercy will tear that down that the foundation thereof will be exposed and known and that's I think God's trying to get to his church he's trying to get his children back to the foundation back to to Really what it is that they should be built on because you come through life and you hear the gospel and you you know you're a sinner and you know there's a hell and you know there's things that that you you don't want to uh go to the bad place and everything so you you you start building a Christian Life you start building your own walls you start building your own way of believing you start building your own experience you you build your your fellowships you build all these things but if it's not built on really what the church is supposed to be built on it God is going to tear it down it doesn't mean he's against you in the church age the prophet of God said God says sometimes God takes a vessel and he completely breaks it down that he can remold it again that he can fashion it again for his own pleasure he said this is the love of God and another love of God there is not and so part of the love of God we know is chastisement that's part of the love of God he chastises his children it doesn't mean to punish correction isn't punishment it means to alter its way he he he if we could understand this great principle that stood out to me this morning was that God's going to tear something down that's not Eternal if you're Eternal beings and eternal children he's not going to allow things in you that aren't connected to Eternity in fact he's it's like he's going to purge the UN Eternal away from you so if you have a religious Foundation if you are building building your own building if you are pursuing your own Walk of Life God's not against you he's for you and and he's got a plan for your life he's got something that he wanted you to Anchor in a foundation that he wanted you to build on and if you've built on that maybe you've built yourself on an experience you know you you had a a shutter or you you you had a a a a flash of light you know I kind of grew up with hippies you know and every time you turned around somebody had a a god experience you know they they they saw a flashing light or you know they they they they were caught up in the clouds and and you know and he they they'd have these things that they thought were uh uh you know I meant God you know what I mean can the truth of the matter is she took too many drugs you know it wasn't a real genuine thing at all you couldn't build on that and that's what man did had this whole thing of Ezekiel he talks about prophets prophesying to the people telling them things that weren't true telling them gospels teaching them things that weren't true preaching all kinds of of of man's approach to this and man's approach to that and none of it was ever hold you and so if you have those things in your life you've came along in your life and you've heard people tell you things and you you dabbed your wall with teachings that weren't right you dabbed your wall with approaches that weren't his approaches you you martyred your wall with things that were never proven by the word of God maybe you had confidence in the man that told you it but what he told you it it had a portion of Truth can you you join that to your building and maybe you've lived by that and you've thought that way for a long time the grace of God not the punishment of God but the grace of God is going to test that mortar and tear it down he's going to tear those things out of your life he's going to tear those ideas out of your life those fears out of your life all those teachings that we have in our life that aren't really based on the real Foundation of what Christianity is based on and we've heard it over and over again you must be born again well that's been taught for so long by the church it's like an experience outside of Salvation like you get saved and then you're born again that foundation's not right that won't stand you know the whole understanding of being born again is that you've been birthed by him you meant him personally it doesn't matter if you're prayed for if you're prayed for that's wonderful the all they can do is pray that you'll have a meeting pray that you'll come face to face you know like he the prophet of God said many times he told Philip and Nathaniel he said come see come see for yourself meet it for yourself and and it can't be built on something secondhand and so we're coming to a real amazing time in the time of the church and and if you understand the growth of the church and you understand the principle of God and all this we could type it if you know this is Jerusalem and and we could go through all the types of new but that's not what we're here the the principle of understanding that if there's something there not sin you understand I'm not talking about Sin I'm not talking about drunkenness or all this anything of that nature I mean the way that you're approaching the father how that you look at them how that you understand the word how the suspicions you might have the guilts that you might have the the fears that you might have all those things God is fixing to address he's going to tear them out your building he's going to tear anything that not built on the right foundation he's going to take it out oh that's a good thing right because you want something that endures that stands the test you you can't you know uh when you know it's just like so many people they they they had the idea you know that you know Christianity in America were hand in hand with the Bible on the table and the flag upon the wall neighbor that's the answer to it all you know that's you know that's salvation for every nation with the Bible on the table and the flag upon the wall that's how people thought be a good citizen go to church read your Bible and they built on that but that's not what the foundation was the foundation of the church is the revelation of Jesus Christ that that not the knowledge of them but the personal meeting of the believer in Jesus personally I me him I know him I know know what he did for me and that never leaves you that change never leaves you you might go through all kinds of Trials you might go through all kinds of mistakes but whenever you get down before God he'll never fail to bring you back to Calvary and and and that's when you talk about being born again we talk about a nature change but you know what he's taking you from it does you don't need if he paid it and he made the change in you you don't need any more than that except subjecting yourself to the leadership of the word of God but when we we begin to understand that in order to have a bride without spot or wrinkle he's got to start purging all these thinkings all these ideas all these misconceptions and I have to admit that 90% of the problem with all these misconceptions is preachers they they they come up with ideas they come up with ways of living they come up with rules that'll replace law with Grace we could make a law I could have the Deacon stand at the back door and say and look at every heel and have a little ruler there and we could make a rule inch and a half anything above inch and a half is a high heel I mean you can have a law right so everybody lines up with the law but they've never been in the closet in prayer they've never got to the place they've never had the experience of the Lord Jesus bringing to their own personal experience that that heals too long it it makes your body twist or you think it makes you look taller well if you're not tall thank God God made you that way doesn't matter if you're tall or wide or Nothing what matters is that don't matter what ground that seed is in is the seed that's important everybody spends so much time on the soil that the the poor plant's not growing and so he's going to deal with that he's got to get that out of your mind he's got to get that thought process away from you he's got to get your approach right he's got to get your attitude right so how's he going to do that well first of thing he's got to purge out he's got to tear down all the walls he's got to get rid of all the tempered mortar till he gets it down to find out what's the foundation of it and the foundation of it always been man have not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven you say well that's a general scope of all things no it's the principle by which God deals with you on every single item in your life from your job to the car you drive to the food you eat you say oh God's not concerned about that God's concerned about everything that concerns your soul the principle is that the bride does nothing amen till she's heard from the Lord yes it's so individual and it's so real and it's so true that we've almost got to the place where we don't expect it anymore we're not in expectation of a a man or a woman coming face to face with the Lord and the Lord speaking to them and them rising up with the power and the glory of the Resurrection in their life set free and born again that God birthed it in US Satan's trying to replace everything with Doctrine with religion with with uh all kinds of ideas and things but you've got to know that you've meant him and you've got to know that he wants to meet you and and it it's hard when the ministry becomes the confessional a lot of times that's all that prayer lines are Brother David I've been out in the world I've sinned I've I've done all that I need to get back to God tell him let him know and I pray oh God this person wants to come back to you I can't make the I'm not the birthgiver the only form that I can impart eternal life is is in the form of the word Now understand that so if we've got conceptions and ideas that have been planted we've our lives are dabbed up with everything there there comes a a time where he says I'm going to take this church and bring it back to its foundation and really when you look at our messenger what did he start to do he started to shake the walls down of denomination he shook the walls down of their teaching began to break all the dab and all the m and finally he came to the place he said there's only one place that God meets a man and that's under the shed blood of Jesus Christ it's God's provided place of worship and the church is trying to re to worship under anointing they're trying to worship under music you know what you worship God for what he did for you for [Music] you Lord I know what you did for me every bit of my life goes back to that time on that roof when I read those scriptures and he lifted the burden that I was under and I come face to face with them it's like Egypt like Israel if you let's just turn and read that for a moment in numbers 14 and four this is a just read along with the a few moments starting in the first verse and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation saying unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God had died died in this this Wilderness and therefore hath the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children would be bet would be pray were it not better for us to return unto Egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return un Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their face before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Zephaniah which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we passed through to search it was exceedingly good land if the Lord delighteth in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land with floweth with milk and honey now the reason that they got into the condition that they wanted to return back to Egypt was they never left Egypt on the right foundation they only left to get rid of the bondage they only let left to get rid of their taskmasters but they never left with a promise in their heart now Joshua and Caleb did that's why that was the response it's a land flowing with milk and honey it's a land land that was promised to us it's a land of blessing it's a land of prosperity it's a land and it's our land if God be with me he will surely give it to me if I find if I he Delights in us now if you've met him personally and he's forgiven you your sins you know he did that because he Delights in you he loves you the question of his love never comes into the picture ever again if you're in a trial it's for your good all things work together for good he said I shall not leave you I shall not forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end when you know that there's no questions because you have a promise what was your promise I've passed from Death unto life the gift of God is eternal life the wages of sin is death you're on the right foundation it isn't a religious Escape I thought that was brought out beautiful it wasn't just getting rid of your Taskmaster it wasn't just getting rid of and that's what happened to people they realize they're wrong they realize they're on the right wrong road they don't like what they are they don't like who they are so they start building on their own thing and their building is beautiful and it's they're putting a real effort into living right and then when God because he has a principle that he can't let you build a life or a building on a false Foundation he swings by in your life and he starts taking it apart and he's going to drive you back to the right foundation where he brings you back and to where you finally are willing to lay down and say Lord I've really tried to serve you but there's a bunch of stuff in here that's not you and you go back and you reestablish and are built again I'd like to read you this a statement this struck me he's talking about Mexico City listen this is just simple we're going to close very quickly he said Mexico City where we had a great meeting where the little baby was brought back to life and there in that great place where we were having the meetings one of the brothers taken me the next day out to look over this to look the city over which Mexico City is a beautiful place but what did I find when I got out there looking down over the city some of the most modern architecture I'd ever seen oh they went oh they went all together out and what was it they never dug down to find the right foundation the great percent of Mexico City is either pitched forward the buildings are backwards or sideways they never went to the Rock no matter how pretty the building looked it wasn't built on the solid rock now think of that they built Mexico City on a lake now why would you go back and buil another building on the same condition or the same Foundation it it wouldn't work and that's what happened to the children of Israel instead of leaving there with their life based on a promise there's a land for us we're not not leaving this land to escape we're leaving this land to go to a promise land we have a land of promise we have what God Said would be there for us every believer that meets the Lord Jesus Christ every promise in the book is mine every chapter every reverse every line it's all mine it all comes with them it's all part of my inheritance not some of it all of it hallu but if you're experience in your foundation isn't right you start picking which promises fit your building I can believe this but I can't believe that you know our our hearts condemn us and we don't even know why we don't understand the reason I'm not having peace the reason I I can't find joy is it because you're not born again or saved but you started building things in your life not based on the foundation not all the way back to the Rock if you could take everything we did in our life and bring it back to that first day experience and see how it flows and how it lines up and how it fits so now we're finding a lot of the church because the prophet of God says if it can be shaken it will be shaken if it can be torn down it will be torn down and should be be tore down but he'll rebuild again I'll restoreth sayith the Lord if he Shake something out of your life it's not I'm not talking even about Sin today you understand that I'm not talking about doing wrong I'm talking about religious ideas attitudes the way you judge things the way you look at things it it's just not the pure love of God flowing do your heart it's footsteps that aren't ordered by the Lord he he just wants to come back and he says I love you so much there's not going to be one thing in your suitcase that you can't take over to the other side be it done unto me according to thy will we say it take everything out of me but in our mind we're always thinking of sin and of the flesh the flesh is a battle it will rage till the day you're changed but if you me him face to face you know that he'll provide the gra and the mercy to overcome the flesh you don't have to be a fear of it you just have to fight it Life's a constant Warfare the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two are contrary to one another and the carnal mind is imity with God and the spiritual mind is life and freedom and we come to a place we come to a realization that you can't live your life being afraid of death no matter how it comes it's our way out of here this thing is cursed to die I would love if the lord gave me another 10 years that'd be wonderful but that means that I would have I I would have pass by fourth core and how many years that he gives it doesn't matter if I know I'm in the palm of his hand I know that nothing can pluck it out of there Paul finally said oh death where's your Victory oh grave where's your sting I have fought a good fight I've ran a good race I'm looking forward to the crown that's been stored up for me see Israel got their eyes off the promise what did he save you from he didn't save you from your sins he saved you from the world politics education science the whole mental structure the whole social structure he saved you from it all it's all death and what did he give you eternal life you've never come face to face with the Lord Jesus and not Reed the promise of eternal [Music] life and when he put the blood on the doorpost in Egypt it was for them to go free not to go free but to go to a land that was promised them and they brought all kinds of garbage got involved and God had to keep them 40 years until he got every bit of it out of them so we ought to be ready for some dillies some personal life shaking some personal Al mental reconstruction some attitude adjustments we ought to be getting ready to be delivered from fear and start to have for us an assignment of Good Works be not hearers of the word only but do doers of the word you're not doing the word God's going to fix and tear everything down in your life that's keeping you from doing the word of God amen you say that's bad that's good you know why cuz he's not going to lose a one of you nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand but he can't keep nothing in the palm of his hand that's not his he's going to deal with us he's going to take with us so when you come out why why go back if God's dealing with your heart don't go back to an experience that didn't hold you in the first place don't go back to the methods you used that got you where you're at you got to dig deeper just don't go back until you've repented of what you've done you you you made up your mind you're not going to go that way anymore and then you just go back building the same building that you built you might change the paint color you might go add you know patch and crack and put web ta tape on it and put little drywall mud on it and sand it up and and clock the trim and make it look like it's all together but just give it 10 years if the foundation ain't right and I think that's what God's trying to tell us go back and make sure you're built on the right foundation if you're not I'm going to keep tearing down what you build until I find that found foundation and I get you to build on it I think that's wonderful I think that's his grace I think that's his Mercy I think that's his patience listen if I could read this he says now friends it's only one road back I've seen many of them that could dance in the spirit that could speak with tongues and could run all over the building and everything else and still no Fellowship just as miserable as they could be because they built upon the wrong Foundation think of it praising worshiping speaking in Tong moved by in the spirit I'm not saying it wasn't the spirit but they never found the peace they never found the joy they they just you know it's that's what addiction is you you lose the feeling of the of the of the drug you use the and you just got to go get another fix and another fix and another fix we don't want be to the place we need religious fixes we don't want to keep rebuilding our church and rebuilding our life when I mean our own life our our personal church we just don't want to keep going saying oh this all messed up I'm going to go build another one I'm going to start a new life how many new lives do you have we're Eagles we're not cats right we're not trying to work on life seven life eight life nine no dig deeper make it personal get in there so when you get up you say I know Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever his Spirit has made an effect on my life and I have a promise he'll never leave me nor forsake me and he'll lead me and guide me and all truth and righteousness then you never have to worry about being tore down again there's a lot of people that are out there shattered and it was God's Own doing because they built on a round foundation and he had to bring them back to a place that they'll go get it right for themselves many a man is serving God because of his wife many a wife is serving God because of her husband and that'll work for so long but one day God's going to want to make it personal and he'll start tearing all your thinking down he'll start tearing you down it's not God against you it's God for you this is a love of God and another form of God's love is not he will get you back to him and when you meet him face to face and you have his change not your change his change in your life you've been born again you can have anointings they're wonderful you can have leadership you can have inspiration but nothing will ever take that birth from you so think it not strange don't let it shake you he wants you to get built as he says here he says because they built on the wrong Foundation that's right we got to get that right thing the first thing first if you don't your whole starting is wrong you've got to get back to the foundation your whole starting was wrong it's wonderful you started that is to your credit he's glad you started but his eternal connection with you you understand that you're his children his eternal connection with you will not let you build something that's not him that's why he went and tore all the the denominations down to set you free that you could build your life on his word and what he said and if he says you're forgiven you're forgiven if you've never heard those words from him if you've never confessed your sins to him and you've never realized and said to him I was wrong I just fellowship with a brother in Africa he was in six different different denominations I said brother you are in a denomination for every Church age and one day he found the truth he said you know how much repenting I had to do you know how much rebuilding I had to do you realize how many ideas I had to get rid of I said I know brother I I got raised up in this message by a lot of people that claim to know brother brandom that claim to know what he taught I was so uninfluenced by all kinds of quotations and things that brother brandom said and this and that and that one day they got it on a computer I found out 90% of it wasn't on the tapes what was God doing he couldn't let me go on amen you say that's terrible that's wonderful isn't that one of our great principles of what he does to a tree he purges it he prunes it he gets it back to its original I don't want a branch growing out of me that's not producing original Fruit prune it Lord and and and so Church the move the first thing God does and I'll try to get into this more in the future but the first thing God does is he separates unbelief and anything that's not the word of God fruit is in unbelief no matter how spiritual no matter how reasonable able no matter what it makes sense it's just not going to produce the next thing he does is he calls the bride to unite yes to come together in the one spirit and one baptism and then he calls her the duty to perform the works that he called if our lives I'm going to go down the road I didn't want to go to tonight but I'll just say it if we have things in our lives doctrines attitudes teachings judgments if we do a whole list of signs and wonders those signs and wonders are testifying to things that aren't truth and therefore the scripture says they hold the word of God and unrighteous I don't want to be there so we're going to God's going to press us to the place that we become the true representatives of the true Living Word and the true bride of Jesus Christ and that's what his promise is for a church so that's a principle I just wanted to share with you tonight God tearing our walls down until we're built on the foundation and no other Stone can a man lay than the Chief Cornerstone is with Jesus Christ and Paul was preaching this 2,000 years ago and we're returning back to the same gospel Paul preached the same gospel our messenger brought to us back to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever God bless you stand together thank you but that's I'm glad you appreciate the word and I know that you love me and and I I I just got to share with you I was so embarrassed overseas because the first night I preached in Zambia uh after service all the kids that were oh I would say probably from 12 under they all started running up to their parents was that brother branam was that brother brandom and and uh so you know uh you I and I know that I'm Irish just like brother brandham was and and I'm sure there's some resemblance both Billy Paul and Joseph told me that that I look like Daddy you know and you know certain features and things well then it got worse than that because I'm an American and they all were raised up under British influence you know so they all got the queen's English with an accent and so I'm just talking like an American well now they said you you sound just like brother Brandon well then I'm reading quotes and they come to the conclusion that I'm preaching just like brother Brandon and so which you know I mean you that makes you feel good and everything but down in your heart you know you're so far away from what brother brandham was and what he did you don't even want them associating you with that you know what I mean it's like who no you know what I mean because you know somebody's going to take it and just blow it out of the water so then the brother started kidding me you know making fun of me CU they knew it got to me and they'd say good morning brother brandom how are you doing today brother BR they pick me up how how's brother brandom today you know they're just rubbing it in part of me wanted to stay and part of me wanted to get out of Dodge so uh but any anyway I I'll tell you what I'll never know what he knew I'll never have the experiences he have but if I could get a little bit of his nature that would be my heart's desire just to have some of the love that he had in his heart and the sacrifice that he had in his heart that would make the world of difference to me isn't that your heart's desire to Lord tear everything down that isn't right I I I don't care if I put a lot of time into it you know what would you have me to do and I think that what he's looking for us and so if he comes into your life and he's you start to see Things Fall Apart don't fear sit back and say praise God he's getting all the unbelief out of me it's him working on me I'm not what I should be and I'm not what I want to be but I'm not what I was either and if I could just keep pressing that Mark in My Heart Lord I want to be like you his love for you is so great that he won't allow something that's not him to have possession of your heart your mind your actions or your life he will come and bring you into his fold and he'll take everything out that he can't love and wrap his arms around and you say well what about my past forget your past leave those things which are behind behind put yourself in his mercy and his grace I'm glad I don't have to meet the things I've said and the things I've done I'm glad that every time Satan brings it up there's a blood spinning around the world that that action of mine can't get through and I'm trusting in that aren't you don't you love them amen let's just pray together our gracious father we've heard such lovely gospel today and we saw so many come up to be prayed for and want to rededicate their Liv lives and my heart father for them most probably most of them aren't here this evening but father that you you that forgive my vocabulary Lord and my inability to approach you correctly but father my heart's desires they don't build on the same old Foundation that don't work that they don't put a lot of effort into a new Christan Christian Life just to find that it fails down the road father I just pray according to this principle that you won't let any untempered mortar come into your their lives that you'll keep driving them back right from the beginning until they come face to face with you Lord keep knocking at their heart I like how Matthew said it not to run around and get their house all straightened up and cleaned up but they will invite you in just the way you are Lord and that little girl that came [Music] up and she asked for prayer she said I want to be a good child I thought why didn't she want to be a good child cuz she was a child and you meant her right where she was at and if we could know that that you will always meet us right where we are you keep all your appointments Lord you never miss one and Lord I my heart I would just ask that the our assembly that you've put together here in Bedford Texas our Believers coming from all over the Metroplex that their spirit will be a spirit of love and caring one for another and praying one for another that they'll know that they have a source in a storehouse that has every answer for every question in their life if they'll wait on you and that you promised youd never leave them nor forsake them but that you'd be with them even in them till the end and and that you would lead and guide them in all truth and righteousness we just ask that you would grant that in Jesus precious name we pray amen I don't know this song I don't if you help me sing it I remember who I was oh I was I was I was BL I was running out of time [Music] separated the to but the of the you H me in your
