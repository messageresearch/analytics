the word to the need of our heart we ask it tonight in jesus precious him holy name we pray amen amen we have a special guest speaker tonight amen you know i've i felt my heart that brother benoit had a gift in his life for a while and uh kind of listening to him and and then i would hear him say a few things and i would just know the lord was dealing with his heart and part of the reason that i had so much confidence in him is because i know the kind of home he was brought up yeah and you know his his father i've had conversations with him and things he says and the way he looks at things and he perceives a lot of things the way that i see him he's got an understanding for the word and what's the important part and you just know that some of those things are passed on so i was really excited and then we lord really confirmed something i'll let brother benoit share that part of it with you if he was but i i think we're in for a treat i guess this is his first time to to minister and i'm glad to be a part of it aren't you and i know he loves the people and i know the people of him said a real great testimony so we can rest in that so let's sing the song that every preacher should have the first time that he ministers amazing grace amen let's sing it as we ask our brother to come and share the word with us just listen there's something in there for you amen [Music] as [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a year [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we know [Music] [Music] our brother comes amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] praise god [Music] god bless you saints [Music] well ain't that good [Music] well thank you musicians i'm just gonna get right into it you can have your seats for right now before i read this scripture so had this burning desire in my heart to share something for a while i was like if i let me call her brother let's talk let's fellowship about the word of god let's dive into what we've been feeding on and god works in mysterious ways and that desire that i had and then it grew to not just just calling one brother but i wanted to have the youth brothers come together and just fellowship on the ward and what we feed on and little did i know manasseh and daniel had the same thing put on their heart from god to have the youth come together the young men and just speak on what it is we feed because this message knows no age you can be 13 12 10 doesn't matter if you want to serve the lord and you want to speak about god go on ahead and i was sitting in my room two days ago just called brother david to have us get his blessing on that and we talked a little bit and then the next day jules sends me a quote at 9 23 that was before you texted me yeah right before you detect an hour before you texted me so this this is just to let y'all know it's got nothing to do with me everything to do with him uh it says whether brandon preaches i don't know what sermon this is in he says hudson taylor one time you have never heard of hudson taylor the great missionary china there was a young indian boy he got saved said he had a call to ministry he come and said to mr taylor said mr taylor should i take four years of psychology and different things that he should do and how long will it take me to get my bachelor's of art mr taylor said to him said son don't never burn the candle half down before you start no that's what i think too don't wait till the candle is half burnt down in some kind of a schooling knocked into you some kind of embalming fluid don't do that but i say as soon as that candle is lit start i'm not trying to support ignorance but here is what i mean if you don't know nothing else tell him what lit the candle tell them what is burning in there just tell them how it got lit let them get lit they'll take care of it the rest of it certainly and that i was like wow that's good and uh i told him i said man that's powerful and he said yeah man i was thinking about you give me a sec here he said yeah i mean i'm thinking about you and i said well we had a conversation but miami not saying jules we went out to grab a bite to eat and they know it's not a shock i've always felt the call to to minister it's a hunger you can't explain you'd rather be sitting down there but something makes you feel like you're not serving god and how you're supposed to be as long as you're sitting there and we talked about it i said man i've ran my entire life i became an expert at running anytime i feel the desire to come or not i think to myself well i have to have all this knowledge first i have to know what land one foot on the land and what foot on the sea means i have to understand what the seven seals were from beginning to end i have to preach to you the restoration of the bride tree and different things and then that quote just said well that's your thinking but i want you to just say how it got laid i'll take care of the rest and we talked and they told me they said well you prayed you've got your confirmation over and over again yet you keep asking for more confirmation well i i wanted an audible voice but god gave me something that i couldn't refuse and refute and i told them i said if god opens the door i'll step in but david had teased on it a few a few years ago he said uh whenever you feel that you've got to put something in your heart for you to speak just let me know did i ever let you in know anything it goes to tell you i would have waited as long as i possibly could but blessed be the name of the lord so that's why i'm here right now standing before you and some of you know me personally some of you know me as just a brother at the church who loves the lord but when you stand here my heart's desire my entire life is don't look at me if anything it's it's what it is god put on my heart look to him because i've sat in services where a minister preaches a certain a certain title but what it is i have on my heart for god to speak to me is in a different direction and because of the desire i came with god pulls him to my need and speaks to where i'm at and i'm thankful for that let's stand and read the scripture and uh matthew 5 starting from verse 13 so i have the old schofield edition so they have a subtitle similitudes of the believer and that word similitude means the quality or state of being similar to something in other words the similarities or comparison of a believer it says ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted it is then forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and they give it light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven may the lord have a blessing to his word amen you may be seated i want to read a quote from you from the sermon the witness preached in 1953 let's see starting from paragraph 43. prophet of god said now in courts a witness has to know something just anybody can't come in and be a witness it's got to be somebody who knows something and that's the way it is when we are witnessing for the lord it takes somebody who knows something so jesus thought said this that before they could become his witness they had to wait in jerusalem until they were endued with power from on high then they would be the witness all over the world in jerusalem they would be the witness all over the world in jerusalem judea samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth in the courts there is two kind of witnesses that will stand that's eye or ear now if you're sitting in a room look through a glass and see an accident your witness your word is no good because you were looking through a glass you have to be right there close to really know what you're talking about before you can be a witness you have to hear it or you have to see it before you can be a witness on a severe case in courts you can't say miss so-and-so told me or mr so-and-so or reverend so-and-so told me he is a witness but you're not so therefore no man can exactly witness to the resurrection of christ only by the spirit you have to be a personal witness yourself being there knowing something about it knowing what you're talking about and god help us to see the day that when men will be just what they are you know i'ma say this now with all respect it isn't our city full of bootleg joints that's hurting us here is what's hurting us more than ever is people who are professing to be christians and not living like it that's the thing see they are not correct witness they are not a correct witness they can't witness until they have an experience and when they have an experience then they become a witness automatically because they are born again and all of the things of the world all things have passed away and all things have became new then you become a witness unto jesus now the thought that i had this morning that god put on my heart is uh just to share a little bit of my own my own testimony of how my candle got lit but the title he put on my heart was the witness of one in a million so when you read that quote the last sentence says then you become a witness unto jesus that word unto means in our understanding too but the definition of that means expressing motion in the direction of so there is a form of motion and expression that takes place when you were a true witness meaning reading that if you say you're a witness of god that god did something for you yet you go to school you go to work you go out shopping you do different stuff yet people can't see the expression of god in your life you're you're not a true witness there's a life an expression emotion that follows there's actions that show you knew the disciples were witnesses because they did the exact same works that jesus christ did so it's the same thing for us today when we receive the holy spirit of god we must do the same works it's the same life if it produces anything else then you know what's wrong but it has to be the same life it says so you can't say you're a witness if jesus christ isn't seeing your expressions in your everyday walk in other words the experience causes a change in your life to the point that your desire is to please god and he alone you don't want to sin not out of fear of going to hell but because you love god being an effective witness you heard the prophet it requires understanding that isn't second hand you can't go to a court where they're deciding on a murder case and say well this person told me that that person killed that person that's not valid you're just saying hearsay you have to be present for it to be something that can be taken in court so when you testify about what god's done in your life to a sinner or an unbeliever i can't say what my brother may not say in his life well god did this well then brother david god did this then they're asking so what did god do in your life because you're speaking of everybody else but what about yourself where is it that you find yourself in the word because if god if god's still the same yesterday today and forever the same god who did it for them can do the same for you [Music] i was just talk a little bit about myself where i continue came here from africa when i was about six years old my dad came a year before us and just to set up work and get constant flow of income before we came and just us coming here was miracles on miracles the grace of god from the money to getting accepted to come in here and everything like that was all the hand of god and i remember my mom told me since i was a since i was a kid when i was in her womb that uh in africa the way things are done is a lot different from what they are here and when i was in her womb somebody had a desire to kill me and my mom before i was even born but the keeping hand of god protected me and my mom and that's i'm grateful that because of that i'm able to stand here today so i i rest in that because it lets me know there was something that god intended for me to do and i if i'd have gone at that time i wouldn't be here today doing what it is god wants me to do i'm grateful for that and growing up i was if you ask anybody who knew me as a kid i was number one person in the office i was there every other day the principal had my name on her desk she knew my dad's number from heart i was one of those delinquents but you see when i at that age it's it's sort of not fear of getting in trouble but it was more so can i get away with it during that time but with time and through time things got better i would say my parents wouldn't but i would say and but that's all right that's all right fast forward to middle school i started to [Music] have a desire to play sports i wanted to do something my grades weren't looking too great and whatnot so i just knew i wanted to play sports and to have a policy here in texas that says no pass no play so if you don't pass you don't play so i started going to school not to learn but just so i could play sports so all i cared about was if i get the bare minimum then i can play but god wasn't satisfied with me getting the bare minimum so for most of my life in high school in the middle school i was getting a's and b's and playing sports i grew to have a desire and a longing and a heart for basketball that was the sport that i don't know i just it made sense to me to play my height everything i just it made sense i was started playing soccer but mom wanted me to play basketball because i kept growing out of my clothes so she said go on and play basketball i said well that's all right and i started playing i gained the love of basketball probably my freshman year and i remember we came the first time we came here to this church this is right after we went to my my first camp brother david asked me a question before he baptized me he said would you give it up for god if god asked and i said yes but in my heart of hearts i knew i wouldn't i knew all and that i wanted nothing more than to play basketball it wasn't in my mind it wasn't a selfish desire because i wanted to provide for my mom want to provide for my pops and my siblings and family back home in the congo and have them not worrying and if you know the salary of an nba player you're good that's what i had in mind but that's not what god had in mind and as my love for basketball grew and grew i remember sitting right there where i always sit with aaron up here preaching and every time you talk about sports he'd look at me and he'd speak i'm like condemned but it was coming in one year ago not the other all i cared about was how can i be the next lebron james that's what i had in mind and then it happened in 20 2017 i started missing services on sundays and going to basketball tournaments and going to hang out with my friends my athlete friends and whatnot and i started seeing where my heart was at i wasn't yet completely s like sold into the message my heart was more so i knew it was true i couldn't deny it but my heart was more set on sports and the opportunities that sports could bring me and as i went to service after service camps after camp the lord started dealing with me to the point i started missing basketball games and practice and tournaments to come to church and my coach would always say when you come back you got to fight for your spot well i rested in the fact that when i came back it wasn't much of a fight he had no choice but to give me my spot back so every time i will leave and come back in one practice the next practice you're starting again i'm like well thank you coach thank you thank you very much and then it got to the point i got my first scholarship the naia school and um i started desiring and prayed for scholarship i said lord i want that d1 opportunity i want to be able to go next level give me the best chance to make it to the next level and because i asked and because i prayed for it god gave me my heart's desire he gave me the opportunity to go play at a school penn state gave me an offer to go play for them they were going to fly me out to go visit the campus visit the facilities visit the gym and everything and i was ecstatic i called my coach i was in the car with my friend on the way back from eating and i was a coach i'm out of here what you mean i said penn state's offering me he said wow congrats i'm like appreciate it he said more to come more to come i said wow that's good now this coach of mine plays a significant role in my testimony because throughout my entire high school life he was my figure of what it looked like to be a christian but in the world if that you if that makes sense if that makes sense because every single time before we played we'd all hold hands get in a circle our father who are in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom we'd say the lord's prayer every time this guy's a christian christian hold on okay i like that and then every time and then every time we had banquets or whatnot it was always prayer first then eat i'm like man i want to be like that when i grow up then when i told him of what god dealt with my heart because what happened was i don't know exactly what took place but one day i'm 100 miles per hour going to penn state and going to pennsylvania that means in my mind i'd left all of you it was just going to be me ben was gonna do ben and live his life i quickly realized there is no such thing as my life but in that decision i listened to a sermon and then the next day i'm like coach that same coach that i made the the image of a christian worldly person and i told him i said coach i feel like i don't want to continue playing he said what do you mean i said well i'm worried that if i go i'm not going to be a christian and he said son that's crazy i was like what do you mean he said well your parents don't have a substantial amount of money to put you through college which is true you're in a minority that makes it hard for you to succeed according to his standards which according to society it's true and i started to think i said well he has some good solid points that he's making maybe i shouldn't just quit automatically but then that voice started dealing with me more and more and more and i remembered my junior year we went to second round of playoffs regionals and we played against a team southwest and that was by far the worst scoring game i've ever been a part of or seeing the final score was 23 to 14 and nobody could score nobody could shoot anything nothing was falling i was shooting prayers every time i threw the ball up hoping it would go in but no nothing worked it was just god did not want us to win that's how i saw it god didn't want us to win and i come back home and those seniors graduate and i'm at home and i'm kind of depressed because a lot of them were like my big brothers my my people that i considered family that i cared about and they were going on and continuing with their life and here i was by myself with my with my teammates in the same grade as me and i was kind of depressed and sad because we broke the school record had the most wins we beat a team 119 like everything was just amazing that year and for it to end that way and my dad a passing comment he has a way of with words he does it on purpose i think but he's i'm walking and my mom sees me and she my mom she's my biggest supporter yet my biggest hater because if i didn't play good or we lost she'd be like oh you lost you should have played better thanks mom but she was my number one supporter went to every game she could and there she was picking on me and whatnot and i'm here i'm sad and depressed with the tear in my eye and my dad walks and he tells me ben let me tell you something you'll cry for basketball for worldly things but for god you won't shed a tear i said wow we went biblical okay and it was that that moment right there that kept playing in my mind when my coach asked me and i told him i said i want to give it up because i know see i started out saying i don't think but then it became i know i won't be a christian if i go over there and continue playing and this worldly christian says why are you worried about your salvation at such a young age caught me by surprise i said coach hold on we pray we fellowship we talk about the word of god and everything here i'm thinking you got my best interest at heart then he tells me why you're about to salvation said young guy i said coach if i die tomorrow what does that mean that the age means nothing at that point he said yeah but you know give give it a little bit of time you know go to school play sports have fun then start living your life and everything but someone wasn't sitting with with that statement start living your life is it really my life if at any point god forbid somebody would take a gun or something and point it at me and pull the trigger at that point is it my life because they hold it in their hands now is it my life if an accident takes place and i die what separates me from one who makes the accident and one who dies at that point is it my life and i realized this thing that we call my life is a grace from god it's a gift from him it's not my life but it's his so unless i seek his purpose his reason for putting me here thing always rings in my mind i look at my classmates in my classrooms and different stuff and i'm like what makes him different from me why is it i was born in this message why is it i know who the prophet is why is it that i can't do these certain things that they do for a period of my life i was trying to understand what it was it meant to be a christian what it meant to live a life consecrated on god and i quickly realized if he gave me this gift he can take it away just as quick as he gave it to me so let me do my due diligence and leave that life of sports and focus on god see i was never a party person i never went to much parties i went to one party my teammates birthday party that was the only party i ever went to in high school in terms of that was thrown by friends i went to one homecoming my freshman year and then sophomore junior and senior year didn't go to homecoming i didn't go to prom my senior year either i just i didn't see the point some didn't sit right with me they're not playing my kind of music so why would i attend and to me it was just an easy answer not to say that if you win everything that you're wrong you know the way god dealt with me was don't go so i didn't go so i didn't really struggle much with some of the stuff that most youth people struggle with but there were things that i struggled with and i when i compare my testimonies to the others that i know who've had the drug problems who've had those issues and whatnot i look and say what kind of testimony do i have i didn't deal with that stuff but the thing i came to realize is the battle god gave them was to bring a character out of them i can't desire the same character they have god has something he wants to bring out of me that's personal to me and after i decided i said lord you know what i'll serve you and i heard a burning hearts desire on my heart to god put on my heart so i was a kid everybody would always call me preacher minister and i just laugh and joke and say well y'all got it but i quickly realized this desire that i have and this thing that people see i didn't understand it because i i could be in a in a room with a bunch of message brothers and testifying to somebody or speaking to somebody and they say something nobody says anything in terms of always supposed to be a preacher but the moment i open my mouth oh you're supposed to be a preacher that's unfair because he said something in fact his sounded better but i'm the no it i just i couldn't believe it i said no i didn't want that and then i prayed and prayed i said lord if this is your will i remember i went to a camp i said lord this is your world when i go up there for prayer let the minister speak to me and tell me that i'm called i get up there little joe adams goes lord let him know he's a minister i said lord that's not enough so that's one but i needed seven more checks before i knew and then an october meeting is the year after here i am battling with the same thing lord i feel this call the more i run the more sin is near it it was a weird thing i want to serve god i try to live right but as long as i wasn't in my place the devil had a way to get at me and i'm like well guys something's wrong i'm like i know that i know this desire is there but it can't be me please i i know what the life of a minister what they go through and different stuff and whatnot i y'all do y'all see what y'all did to brother david like he had a full set of hair and um you know and i was like well i no i can't be me and then i go to october meetings and i go up there for prayer again i said lord speak to me brother aaron oglesby goes lord confirm it in his heart that he is a minister i said god what are you doing to me i just want to sit in the pew and listen and say amen and praise the lord but you want more from me i'm i don't understand so then it got to the point where i said lord i accept what it is that you're asking me to do if you want me to minister that's fine but lord i don't have the tools necessary to minister and then i just in my own prayers saying that i felt dumb saying i don't have the tools necessary as if i had to get tools myself to preach or to say anything it's got nothing to do with me then then the i heard the brother brother branham say in a sermon and he just started dealing with me just conti every sermon i listened to he would hit the point on being called i listened to a man running from the face of god i felt condemned from beginning to end but brother brennan makes a statement he says god doesn't call the equipped he equips the called and i said wow now i really can't run and i pray that i talk with man i say and she brothers a lot about what it is god put on my heart and it was always one of those that's you not me i'm like wow no support that's crazy but they they weren't wrong if god puts a call on your heart the more you run the harder it gets and the more he pulls eventually when he pulls you into the office that he wants you're finally at peace that mind battle that you had if is this the right places it's not because i was anxious back there and when brother david told me to say something i thought i was gonna die my my heart was just beating quick but as i'm here i'm at peace not because of anything that i did or anything but when i was studying and trying to pull quotes and scriptures together that spoke to what it is that god put on my heart things just started coming by themselves i didn't have to search or anything god just go here go there go there so i'm certain whatever it is that i say is what god intended for me to say and whatever i don't say he didn't want me to say and i leave it at that and i said lord if this is your will then i'll step in and i'll do what it is that you ask of me and i was talking i talked to men asking them i said well if god opens the door then let it be so then brother gary stinky and your mom she pulls me at the wedding she goes you're going to be a preacher boy i said what are you talking about he said i heard your testimony you're going to be a preacher i said um i pray for me she said i'm gonna pray for you i'm gonna pray for you then things just started happening so fast these past two weeks and whatnot where something was just pulling and pushing and pulling and pushing getting me to just consecrate more and more time into feeding and reading and listening and studying and meditating and everything and i said wow i have this desire in me i just want to share everything god put on my heart and just to give a little testimony before i get on the on this subject that god put on my heart but i was uh working with emmanuel we're working a a job my uncle gave me to help people close containers to send to africa and we worked from 4 30 till about 8 30 ish what not intense labor in a container that is hot uh we were almost dying we were hungry we hadn't eaten anything and we were on our way back to drop me off at the house and we stop at the gas station and i've had these moments in my life where the still small voice speaks and i've quieted it for a long time when it tells me to do something but i realize the more you'll quiet it so much to the point where you won't ever hear it again so take heed when that voice talks and tells you to do something because or else you'll have to answer for it and we're at the gas station and we're just sitting there putting gas and a homeless man walks by on emmanuel's window he has a gold chain in his hand and a lighter and he leans over this is an old man had to be over well i would say over 70 but drugs age you like 38 30 years so he could have been 90 or something like that but he was real old hunched back like wrinkly wrinkled just walking over there with the gold chain and the lighter and he goes say son you got i need money and he turns on the lighter he says i this is a real gold chain i need six hundred dollars for if you could just if you could just pay me please and i i looked at emmanuel and he looked at me and i said brother we don't wear chains and he says and he says well that's all right you have a dollar i'm like i wish i did i i have this bad habit i don't hold cash uh everything's always on my card i don't know why i'm the way that i am but i just don't hold cash and emanuel didn't have anything in his wallet either or in his car and the old man said you got nothing it was like nah he said that's all right and he walks by then i heard a voice see this is why i think it's important when your brother brenham talks about a witness a witness is only effective if he gets up there and speaks as long as he doesn't speak everything that took place everything that he saw is of none effect and in that moment right when he walked by a voice spoke to me and said you claim you're a message believer you claim you serve the living god you claim you know the way to heaven yet there was your moment to say something to him and you let it pass by but right before he passed the car i called him sir could you come back could you come back could you come back i said can i pray for you and he said sure i said give me your hand please he gave me his hand and as i was praying the scripture came into my mind silver and gold have i not but that which i have give i unto you see i don't know what god's going to do for him i don't know if god's going to bless him with an abundant amount of money or whatnot but i did my part in terms of lord told me to do something and i did it and we started sitting there in the car and and man i say no and emanuel we were talking and we just started to fellowship about we get so in our own mind in our own state of being with everything we got going on well i got word cut this time i wake up at so and so time got to pick up this person at that time i got this this than the other you can get so busy in life that you don't leave room for god to operate then you realize your life starts to get kind of lukewarm you don't see god in your life you don't see the move of the spirit well maybe if you stood back and stood still maybe you'd hear something or you'd see something but we sat back and we thought we said wow we're so fortunate we hear so many times with people who are poor less needy we don't have the the the best house we don't have access to a substantial amount of money this is meaning manual talking to each other and we said but we have a roof over a head we have clothes on our back we have shoes on our feet we have food that's a homeless man who has nothing if i can't give them anything physical how if i give him the kingdom of god he won't have need of anything else that's that's all he'll ever need and we just started talking and talking talking about how sometimes we're selfish we we go to a store because we have stuff to shop for but we don't stop and think maybe somebody's here for me to speak to we're just so caught up in our mind and what we got going on and the thought that god put on my heart was the witness of one in a million and i want to go to oh god i want to go to i remember one time brother david was preaching and he made a statement he said jesus christ had to be tempted in every way possible and he was because that's the only way he could really say i know what it feels like he couldn't say that as god the spirit he had to become flesh face the same things we face so that when we receive his spirit we have the assurance that we will overcome not by our own power but because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world if he wasn't tempted in every way he would have just been a survivor but no he's an overcomer because he overcame the flesh that's our champion he overcame death hell in the grave not for himself but for us to redeem back his bride that's why the bible says in romans 8 33 34 let's just turn to that it says who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that commandeth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also make it intercession for us why why that for me that hit me hard was because a lot of times especially young people and whatnot we struggle when we see our parents or anybody because we hear the prophet say that as the days go by and the ages go by it's going to be 10 times worse than the age before so we get in the mindset where you think well dad don't understand what i'm going through mom don't get what i'm going through that deacon don't know what i'm going through he doesn't know what i'm going through but god knows but we can't seem to see that god was tempted in every way for that purpose the message he sent is perfect doesn't matter how much longer we have whether it's ten more years or whatever this message will stay the same and produce the same thing it was meant to produce which is a god-centered life and when you receive his spirit you can't help yourself from testifying remember the scripture read in the beginning neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth the light onto all that are in the house now that's man man's capability of the light that he can produce can only turn on a city a house some small but you hear the prophet say it was spoken that in the evening time there shall be light that light is greater than the lights you see here because what that light does it causes a man who sends them schools constantly moving his way towards hell because brother brother branham says god does not send no man to hell man sends himself to hell so you can be at the doorstep of hell knocking but when that light gets a hold of you when just just that voice when you hear it for the first time it pulls you out from where you were it's not i want to say this correct it's not brother branham pulling you out he's not speaking of himself all he wanted to do was point you to christ he's the one that has the power to do it all and i can look back in my condition when i hear testimonies brother matthew give his brother jackson brother cosman there's a theme in that it didn't matter how far they got because they were a seed of god it was already settled nothing they could have done nothing they could have tried to do would have worked because god chose them in this in the sermon christ the mr god revealed brother branham says jesus christ god chose you in christ before eve ever fell so that takes anything you do now out of the equation because you were chosen then not now he made you perfect then so you're telling me i'm i'm living a life of sin i feel like i can't overcome i feel like i can't get the victory i know i'm a billy i know what the message is real i know what the the lord helped me the lord saying he's revealed himself to me but i'm still battling this mind this than the other then you hear the prophet say it's got nothing to do with you the reason why the devil is at war with you is not because you because the name that god placed in you because you are mrs jesus that's why he battles you if it wasn't so you'd have no battle people in the world don't get tempted that they don't know what sin is that's their life the life of an unbeliever is just living they don't call it sin they call it life but when we sin as believers it's called a sin because it's disbelieving what god spoke in his word and acting against it but thank god for the grace of god let's go to christ is the mystery of god revealed paragraph 225 what it means to be saved the prophet of god says but the revelation come through the blood see through jesus christ who was the blood of god creative blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelation that's how we know him today is only that's how we know him today is only the only way you could know him not say i'm methodist that means nothing i'm baptist that means nothing i'm catholic that means nothing but by the revelation what god has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed if it lives itself expresses himself through you once again you see here with rhymes he's literally telling you get out of your own mind it's got nothing to do with you it lives itself and expresses himself through you you're just the vessel that god uses it's got nothing to do with you god just wants to use your hands your feet your eyes your hands that's why paul can sit up there and say it's not me that liveth but christ that liveth in me he said well what do you mean i'm dead but i'm alive i i don't get it okay hold on i'm here but it's not me he's not talking about oh uh something that's if i could say in a word something that's impossible to to understand is just hidden from them that are wise and prudent but then for babies they can see that's why they call those days those people in those days christians because they saw the life of christ living through them and they said that's how christ walked paul was trying to show you when you get a life so censored when you have the holy spirit living in you it's no longer about what benoit wants to do and it's everything to do with what god wants to do his will becomes my will and brother and he goes on in christ the mystery of god revealed in paragraph 297 he says talking about that life it's a personal individual affair with the person that christ has revealed to them and if you say he's been revealed to me and then the life that christ produced here in the bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong revelation if i put a life of a pumpkin into the life of a pear tree it would bear pumpkins by their fruits ye shall know them exactly right and if the first you put out a tree a grapevine and they put out a bunch of grapes the first shoot it put out brought grapes the next one brought out lemons and the next one brought out pears the next one brought out apples and there is some kind of a grafted affair in there that's bearing his its own life every denomination will bear life of itself but if that original vine ever puts out another shoot it will bear grapes like it did the first time and if the life of jesus christ ever puts out another body of believers it'll bear the fruit that the first one did they'll write a book of acts behind it because it'll be the same same life see what i mean you just can't get away from it it's the life of christ in you been injected in you by the holy spirit itself living its life through you and in that in the quote that i read in witness brother branham talks about it he talks about the real problem is not those out in the world it's those who profess to be christians and aren't living the life of christ that's the issue we have and the greatest the greatest deception that the devil has in this day is he'll let you sit in the pew thinking you're saved when you're not i've been there that's why i can say it he let me sit there thinking that i was living right thinking that i was acting right thinking that i was feeding i could amen lord i could shout out to him i'd get up and dance and praise that meant nothing because the life i lived when i got home wasn't a christ-centered life so i what was i reflecting i wasn't reflecting his life because his life isn't reflected here amongst believers but what does the world see of you what do they see when they look at you do they see christ if they don't see christ something is wrong because we read here it says it's the same life that god in the beginning that same life has to be seen again what it produced then must be produced now and i started to ponder that i said i i heard someone say one time have you ever heard a tree grow a tree doesn't make noise when it grows it doesn't have to boast about it growing the life that's in it causes it to grow without the life it doesn't grow but here we are when when we catch an inspiration of something without settling it in the word what happens is you begin to speak like well i'm in the message well i'm a believer i know the prophet of the end time i know the word of god i know what a rapture is i'll make it i'll make it i i i there you are again in a one-man denomination it's not about you it's the grace of god that saved you not for yourself but to go and save somebody else it's your testimony that when you share it somebody says well can is that god real that god that did that for you can you do it for me that's where you rest he'll take care of it all it's his life and i started thinking to myself i said that's amazing and he said one of the best ways to determine if a tree or a plant is dead is the scree scratch test just beneath the dry outer layer of bark in the tree's trunk lies the cambium layer of bark in the living tree this is green in the dead tree it is brown and dry oh if i could only express it exactly the way i'm seeing it lord help me psalms 1 says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stand it in the way of sinners nor sit it in the seat of the scornful if the life of god is inside of you you are not found in the seat of the ungodly you're not sitting where sinners are at you're not where the scornful are at but your delight is in the law of the lord and in his law do you meditate day and night and only then will you be like a tree that is planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf shall not wither and whatsoever he do it shall prosper if the life of christ is in you you have a hunger for the word you have a hunger for more of god you want more and more revelation you want more and more of god you walk into church it's no longer well so-and-so made me mad this morning well so-and-so said this no but i'm walking to hear god speak to me i want god to touch my heart meet me where i'm at in my condition see one of the favorite things that brother branham says is god meets you where you're at it's kind of like a father when he has a child who's a baby he doesn't speak in a language that the baby can't understand but he speaks gugu gaga down to the language but as he grows he changes how he speaks to the child and when he gets that age of maturity now he can start speaking to him in a manner that he can understand so the problem comes is when we receive the spirit of god and we put ourselves in a let me say this in a youthful mindset oh i'm youth i'm only going to live with what i got you know i'm a young person i don't have to live up to a certain standard those are older people god deals with them differently and what not um i i hope i get there no when the life of god comes inside of you it desires for more of god and when you get to that point where your desire for more of god becomes an action and not just a word that spoke well i want more of god in my life but you go home and don't read your bible and pray you don't listen to a tape you don't spend time in feed the burdens of everybody else doesn't bother you do you really want more of god in your life if you really did you do the things that would put more of god in your life that's where they've been on the question how does one know if he's going to go to heaven he answered them and said well i take my life i compare it to the light of the word and where i see faults i make it right and i keep pressing on that should be our hearts desire every day when we walk lord have i done all that i could have done today lord have i given you time have i set aside time for you because we can easily sit there and say well i'm too busy for that i'm too busy for that but you'll make time to watch that show to watch that movie to watch whatever you'll make time for those things get on the phone with so and so for however many hours oh i'm so busy i'm so busy but then you get home and you're in bed sleeping you can you can always find time for god see something that always hit me when the life hit the apostles in the days of old they sold all they had to follow christ they gave everything to follow christ why is it in this day because the word says it'll do the same thing it did then why is it in this day when the word comes to us we want to store stuff well i want this i want that i want this no he said let it all go you're supposed to live a life they didn't know where they were going to sleep what they were going to eat they had no idea they trusted completely in god for it all but we've gone so far from that i started to think every time there's a there's a money issue somebody wants somebody's in need of money or whatnot the first answer that goes get a job oh go do this maybe you'll get some money and whatnot don't get wrong don't get wrong what i'm saying because the bible says if you don't if you don't work you don't eat but when your first answer is always something that you can do yourself and it's not what is it that god wants me to do what if you prayed you wanted to see miracles in your life pray for a miracle what if you needed money you need healing whatever instead of going to medicine or going to get a job what if you prayed and said lord you said you'd provide all my needs you said if i seek you first everything else will be added on to me lord i'm fulfilling your scripture that you said then watch the life that's shown through you you'll see god in every facet of your life it'll no longer be you you'll get to the point you start praying for everything before you drink water lord bless it and you drink it before everything but we've gone to a point we only see us we only want to do what we want to do we only have time for what i want to do but at what point do we go back to that life that was supposed to be manifested in us if we're supposed to write another book of acts how do we expect to write it as long as we're sitting in our room hiding not sharing the word or sitting at work being busy and different stuff without taking the time to share it with somebody else i find it fascinating when people tell me oh yeah i'm a christian there's nothing other whatever whatever i'm a mess of believer in the i asked them a simple question because even for me i was at a point where i was on the other side of it but then god dealt with me i i asked him well have you ever told anybody about what you believe no why and they might ridicule it they might not believe it they might not understand the other it it's not you you can speak to one person who's a sinner one who's a believer unbeliever and unbeliever he has a seed to believe that one doesn't you say the exact same thing he won't believe it because there's nothing in him to believe it but he will all you have to do is open your mouth the word says worry not what to say in that moment for god will give it to you what to say in that moment but so many times when we testify we want to talk about the seven seals they don't understand that they don't get what that is but you get down to where they're at brother are you struggling with something somebody of yours is sick well i i can remember back before i was even saved i had a friend of mine she had cancer i wrote a prayer request here at the church and she had diabetes as well she was going to go through chemo and i felt in my heart i said well i believe in the living god why not bring this before the saints i brought wrote a prayer request and said pray for my friends who has cancer and diabetes and she was about to go start chemo and they prayed she went back to the doctors the condition was getting worse and she told me well ben um it's getting worse i don't know what if i'm going to make it or whatnot and i told her i said see it's in the moment when things start getting worse that you got to have a little bit more faith because god's getting ready to do something in that moment and i said just believe a little bit more a little bit longer you won't do it for yourself do it for me to believe a little bit longer and she went back to doctors the next time and there was no trace of anything left that's not happened chance that's not an accident no it was if i hadn't applied what it is i know that i serve a living god that whatever i ask he'll do if i hadn't put myself in that place there would be no testimony like that but because i fulfill the scripture god is bound by his word to do his part i did my part that's up to him to do his excuse you know just uh because i want just in in closing what god put on my part of my heart he said you can't help it even if you tried because it's no longer you living it's god living through you the problem comes when benoit interferes that's when the issue begins but if benue can only get out of the way and let god have his way they've been all become a true witness reflecting nothing except god because it has to get to a point where you can say where we can say if you have seen me you've seen the father how because he is expressed in you through you why because a equals b and b equals c therefore a equals c ask yourself am i really reflecting a the way i should if not make it right let god take control he knows where he wants to take you just pull from that everlasting fountain of life he will see it through he promised he would let's surrender ourselves to his will less of us more of him so in feeding and just studying the burn desire god put on my heart is if i'm supposed to be a witness there has to be somebody to witness too and as long as i'm just witnessing to my brothers who are in the message or my sisters in the message there's other people out there that don't know this that have the seed of god in them and without me playing my part because there's a part to play nobody ever talked about it once you're saved you're not saved for here you're saved for there in that new world but we want to take all those that are of god's children over there with us but how can we if we keep being silent and quiet with what is god does in our life we have to testify we have to speak i've been random moments of my life god says speak to this person and i speak to them i don't know what god will do i just do what he says when he asks and i leave it in his hands because it's up to him he said he'll take care of everything as long as i put him first and i do his word everything else will be fine god bless you saints [Applause] let's stand together so a little course i wanted to sing i don't better really know the words but i just uh just play sister forrest would you please [Music] i'm wondering tonight if maybe you didn't down inside of your spirit come under a little bit of conviction you know about really how much your life is about his will and not your will and [Music] you know i believe our brother gave his testimony because he could honestly tell you he knows what it is to die you know and it's a hard thing to die but he made a statement that moved me and it it [Music] sunk deep within me he said when somebody's got a gun pointing at you he says is it really your life then you know or you're in a car accident or someone runs into you and you all of a sudden you're in a car accident is it really your life then you might think you have a life but there's only two spirits you know what i'm saying so you're either serving god or you're serving manna you can't serve two kingdoms and that's all the gospel is it's the word of god telling you that the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus and it's a plea to to die and he said if you'll give up your life i'll give you life life more abundant [Music] he could have sat saw the basketball career [Music] how long does that last tell your first injury you know it don't last but this lasts forever you know what would you give for a time of entertainment for one soul what would a man give for a soul what is a soul worth that's worth ten thousand worlds and so as we sing this course i'd like each of us just to [Music] think in our heart and maybe just take a moment to rededicate our focus of our life maybe you might need prayer and you might say i haven't been living for the lord and i i'd like to have prayer tonight i'd like to lift up my hand and say god remember me i i don't i don't have something that i'm living for and this is the age of being lukewarm it's the age of being in a place that you're not living you're just drifting from pillar to post you've never sat down and drove in a tie post into the ground and said this is what i'm going to live for and i'm going to give my life to you lord and i'm going to live for you and i'm going to let your will be done in my life not my will lord but thy will be done you might put your hands up the lord and say lord i'd like to be used of you i'd like to do something i like to have you speak to my heart i i might not have a call to preach i might not be someone that has a musical ability but lord there's something inside of me a calling and [Music] every calling only comes in to existence with the surrender and the death lord i'm going to re surrender to the call that i feel in my heart i'm going to surrender to the pull i feel tonight to serve you more but i'm going to surrender to the spirit that moved in me that said i could live more dedicated tonight lord i'm speaking for myself i in the light of what i've heard lord i feel a shame much is given much is required lord now i want to be more of a faithful christian more of a faithful believer lord i want to serve you with a greater intensity than i've ever served you before i want the love of god shed abroad in my heart by your spirit i want to be that candle that's lit lord i'm asking you to light me tonight i'm asking you to come and stir the waters of my heart [Music] one more time father lord i'm asking for your grace that i can make a commitment [Music] that i'll seek first the kingdom of god and i'll trust that everything else will be added lord was a prophet to man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul or what would he give in exchange for his soul [Music] lord there's nothing like serving you and we pray tonight for more of you oh more of you we just lift your hand tuned tonight [Music] would you be honest with him and just dedicate your heart to is [Music] is [Music] for more [Music] is that what you want tonight would you tell them ask yourself do you really want more of god behold i stand at the [Music] oh

brother said you know about him [Music] you know what the church believes you know what your family believes [Music] but you yourself [Music] you just can't witness that you've really meant him or maybe there was a time you were close to him but you're not as close as you once were [Music] and you'd like to raise your hand not to me my head is bowed but you like to lift your hand to him and say lord i know that [Music] i'm just not right i'm not where i want to be father i'm not what i should be [Music] and i'm not lifting my hand to say i'm guilty i'm lifting my hand father that you will

i couldn't witness to i couldn't say i knew i couldn't say i've heard or i've experienced but i'd like to lift my hand to you lord and say lord i'd like to have that experience i'd like to have that confirmation i'd like to have that leadership i'd like to have that dedication i'm raising my hand father not to say i'm guilty but to say that i'm needy and i need more of you [Music] i just need i
