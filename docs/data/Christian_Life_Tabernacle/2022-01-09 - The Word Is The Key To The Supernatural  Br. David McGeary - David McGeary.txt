Description:
The Word Is The Key To The Supernatural 
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Service Morning: January 9, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

this morning father we'll be committing everything mighty name our lord jesus christ we ask amen amen amen good to be gathered in the house of god this morning amen i know that many are not here but amen we had to worship him amen we're going to invite brother tim salah for so i'm reading this morning god bless you all we'll certainly welcome all our visitors and everyone god bless you good morning welcome to you are you delighted to be in the house of the lord this morning and then we're going to concentrate a little bit on that that word delight i think it appears i'm 15 16 18 times or so in the bible it's delight uh and the dictionary says it's to take or to have great pleasure in or with so uh we we pray the lord will have delight in his in his congregation this morning maybe we have a little more elbow room this morning we can spread our spiritual wings and and set our wings and fly in the wings of faith amen amen david doesn't take very long to uh to to use that word delight uh the first chapter of psalms he said blessed is a man that walking not on the council of the ungodly nor stand it in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scorple but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law that they meditate day and night that's where i want to find myself this morning we're actually going to read from psalm 37 it is a it's a full song and it's rather lengthy so if you don't mind i'll read it and people just follow along but uh i was talking to my dad this week and he said and i asked him how he was doing what was going on he said well son said i'm studying the message and he said you know this is this message is concentrated he said we've got concentrated juice concentrated soap but this message is concentrated i appreciated that because a little bit can go a long ways and before we read this song i'm not excuse me i'm not trying to have a mini sermonette or anything but just to highlight the beauty of holiness and keeping the sabbath you don't have to turn to it if i want to read a portion of isaiah 56 brothers can flash it they'd like said thus saith the lord keep ye judgment or equity and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil and then in 58 13 isaiah if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord honorable and shalt honor him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor seeking thine own words not even using your own words then shalt now delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it amen blessed be the name of the lord we can delight in his presence we can lift up our hands and thank the lord and then when we go our separate ways from here that sustains us for the journey amen and brother brown typed the preaching of the word to the waters of separation you know when the red heifer was taken without the camp we know the purification and exodus he taught is that it had to be burned entirely and the priest eliezer would dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle the tabernacle seven times he typed that to seven ages but the water of separation determined the clean from the unclean you had to be washed by that and that's what the preaching of the word does when brother david comes out it's not his own thoughts he's preaching but it comes from the word of god and it it shows us where we need to make ourselves right and to make ourselves clean by the word of god amen psalm 37 as i said i'll read it and we'll try to get through this it's 40 verses here and fret not thyself because of evil doers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity there's no need to end in this world for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the greener trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and barely thou shalt be fed amen delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart verse three said trust in the lord and do good verse 4 he said delight thyself also in the lord amen i just want to add here you know there's something too saying hey i accept that because that word of the lord applies to me but when you delight in it then you really wrap your arms around and embrace it it's like having a good meal and thinking hey i'm hungry i'm going to eat this meal because it needs i need substances from it but if you get some dish that you really do love then you step up and you really heartily enjoy maybe sister nikki's macaroni cheese for instance you think oh i love that macaroni and cheese then you're really delight in it that's the way i want to be with the word of the lord amen amen commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the new day rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass cease from anger and forsake wrath threaten not thyself in any wise to do evil for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be ye they shall diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight delight themselves in the abundance of peace and what a delight the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teeth the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming the wicked have drawn out the sword and had bent their bow to cast down the poor needy and to slay such as be of upright conversation you can't even hold a good conversation in their presence without them beating you up their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bow shall be broken a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord upholdeth the righteous the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord shall be as a fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away the wicked bar with him path not again but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall be not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand here's one that applies to me i have been young and now i'm old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from evil and do good and dwell forevermore for the lord loveth judgment and forsaken not his saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgment the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off then thou shalt see it i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree yet he passed away in low he was not yea i sought him that he could not be found mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace but the transgressor shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him amen blessed be the name of the lord i'll leave one more scripture with you hebrews 9 28 the bible says in paul speaking he says so christ was once offered for the sins of many okay but

and recently my stepmother had to go to the nursing home with alzheimer's and he said it's very difficult time for them amen to certainly want to remember him this morning amen the scripture says greater the affliction of the righteous but the lord delivered them of all of them there's not one affliction that can stand before him so if you have a need upon your heart just leave your hand up to

just perfectly according to your plan we just ask you to bless us this morning in this time of fellowship it's cold outside lord rainy and dreary but in our hearts we know there's a greater day coming we ask you to be with us today in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated i don't have my um my gun so hey gary could you go get my mic and i'll put it on i forgot to put it on this morning in case i get going different places which i wanted i'm not no baby dedication right so i guess you guys are free to go they look at me like i'm gonna sing all right i ought to do it one day and then um they'll they'll flee off the platform amen a lot of a lot of people out there's the sickness uh uh going around quite a bit uh i guess it's another form of covet and and you know i like information that uh so everybody's got a different story what's going on and and uh so now they think and i don't know who they is but they think that all the people that are getting this new covet have been vaccinated because it's the vaccine that's given them the new the new strain so yeah just pin that on there we don't care how does this thing work that better all right now i can hear myself but anyway so we don't know what's doing it but i got one thing all sicknesses of the devil so that's we know and we know where we're going there won't be any sickness there whatsoever amen so let's just have a good time in the word this morning amen and fellowship around the things that god has for us and and we just have a little simple thought but but i i think that that god's revealed in simplicity and the more complicated that god can satan can make things the less we narrow our perspective on where we find them i remember aaron preached a sermon one time i really enjoyed it was about choices and i think he brought out in that message that there's like 47 different choices of water so in fact they even got water now that's smart now if anybody can scientifically explain to me how water's smart i i'd like to learn that amen but but we want to just fellowship this morning have a good time in the lord and and and just kind of uh stir up our remembrance and and uh of you know what it is that we stand for and and what's the motivating principles that drive us a a person that used to fellowship here not long ago told one of our our members they were fellowshipping with them and they said well i can't believe the message anymore and i thought that's good but then what is it that you do believe okay if you don't believe this that's fine i can i'm all for that if you don't believe it you don't believe it but the question is what is it then that you do believe and so i don't even think people ask themselves what they believe or or they don't even question that what they believe is affecting their decisions and the path that they take now if i believe there was no uh life after even the scriptures tells me if we don't have any hope of eternity we of most men are all miserable i mean we're trying to live right and sustain from the world and and not you know try to do good and if there's no reward well let's uh let's live roudius and and every uh way possible because it's when it's over it's over and but i don't live for this world amen we believe and there's a world to come and and then the next question would have been is that if what you believe if you believe in life after then how do you get there how do you get there and and that kind of brings us to our topic this morning and and if i had a title for this and and we'll just kind of fellowship along these lines the word is the key to the supernatural the word is the key to the supernatural and of course that's uh that's the way an old person talks a key nowadays they would use the word password you know what i mean because nobody uses a key anymore it's what's your code what's your password you know that you don't even go to the lock now you just walk up to the lock and you press buttons and it opens up that's if you're old-fashioned if you're modern you reach and grab your phone and press it and the key would open but so what we want to talk about this morning is that the word is the key to the supernatural so let's go ahead and open our bibles and stand and we'll read three portions of scriptures this morning and we'll just fellowship around the word so let's read in genesis 1 1. now this is the there's a very many people in the world today that does not believe this very first statement they believe that for some reason some molecules or some planets or something bumped into one another or or something happened in the space that just caused things to develop in form so that would be a question is that what you believe but what i believe this morning and i believe you're here fellowshipping this morning because you believe the same thing that in the beginning god created heaven and the earth in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters amen and i'd like to let this portion of that uh thought set with you and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters so we see that if god ever does something he always does it the same so we know that when god wants to do something his spirit moves upon it god moves by his spirit amen and then we'd like to also turn over into the gospel of saint john and read in the first verse here this morning of the gospel of saint john in the first chapter in the first verse in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same in the beginning and the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so a lot of people go through quite a well let's pray our gracious father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated so we see that even john is telling us here that god created all things and there's nothing that was made all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so god is the creator of all things and so as we look at this this morning and and what we're uh pointing to is the word is the key or when you think of a key you think of something that allows you to enter in to some place so you've got to have a key to the door in other words how are how how are you going to get in uh uh you you have a key to your truck you have a key to this or some sort of key uh key nowadays doesn't necessarily have to be a piece of hard steel you know there's it's it's the method by which you enter into something we have what we call key cards i believe that you swipe them we have voice identity now for keys they they have eye identity where you put your eyeball on it and and it reads your eye all those are methods by which that you enter in to a certain place and so we realize that to enter into the supernatural there's got to be a key that allows you to go in to the supernatural and so we we want to place in our minds this morning if we could draw and divide that over here is the supernatural this is a supernatural it's a realm it's a world it's an existence it's a place because just like if you would like to go to a certain place there's a way to get there it might be by boat it might be by plane it might be by submarine or some method by but that's the method by which you arrive at that place and so so the supernatural is something that exists it's real it gets it's not uh what we would ca we would say that it's not something that's carnal or something that's man-made it's not something that has been put together but it's something that is above nature it's supernatural so we realized that in the beginning god created the supernatural because everything that was made by him everything that was made the anything that was made that was made was made by him so everything in our existence comes from the supernatural so in other words there's another governing force there's a power that runs things so along with what we would call the world or something that is natural there's something that is supernatural something that is above nature so we understand that there's a supernatural realm there there's a supernatural existence there's a supernatural place and we we realized that the the supernatural has always been there the supernatural was there before there was anything natural in the beginning was god in the beginning was the word and the word was with god in the beginning was the supernatural and the supernatural was god that's what existed in the beginning it it's absolutely it's always been there and it's always been and it's always been the same it's unchanged uh it remains the same because the word of god is eternal so we understand that that if if you have to get into the supernatural realm this supernatural place so that's important for us we'd like to we'd like to know there's a supernatural because we come into circumstances where there's nothing natural that can help us we've ran out of all the herbs we've ran out of all the formulas we ran out of everything that that we can come up with and and when we've come to our end when we've come to our failure when we've come to our wits end and we just don't have no place to turn there is a place that is supernatural and the powers of god take my coat off thanks billy the powers of the supernatural are identified to us because it's the supernatural that created the heavens and the earth so this supernatural make everything that we perceive as natural or by nature the things we can touch the things we can smell the things that we can feel and hear and see all those uh senses that we have contact the contact the natural realm and in the natural realm there's things like emotions and memories and consciences and all those things and those things have been caused in us by our contact with the natural we've developed the other census in our in our bodies and in our relationships that are based on feelings but the supernatural only has one way to one entrance into this world that we're going to need and that we hope that we're going to is the word of god the word of god is the key to the supernatural so how do i get in there if i need something from there or if i if if i believe that it's there and i believe that my answers lie there i believe that my hope lies there i believe that that that it exists now if you don't believe it exists you're never gonna look for the entrance to it you're never gonna ask yourself how do i get in there is it real is it the same did it create heavens and earth now you came from some place i mean you're you're more than something that that man could just put together look at your intelligence look at your heart look at your love for life okay and john says that the the light shineth in this light was the the life of men because our very life came from a supernatural source so that i think the evidence of of the supernatural is uh it is so important to us now that that the supernatural so when the the the supernatural so this world came from the supernatural so in the beginning was the word and so from that supernatural realm of this supernatural existence there's enough power in this supernatural realm to create the heavens and earth to set the stars in the sky to uh to have all the laws of nature that we call it the laws of gravity and all those things that are placed there let's even for a moment consider how powerful must this supernatural be to create the sun to create the air you breathe we think that we're pretty good off huh how long do you think you can live without water i forget i don't think it's very long some of you might know that are survival three days without water and then you look like a grape no a raisin so supposedly you can you can't make it three days after three days you're gone you're going downhill so i mean we think we're so mighty but we can't live three days without water so somebody something that's supernatural had to be able to create something that you can't live without all right we got three days for water how many days can you live without air how many hours can you live without air who'd like to be my guinea pig i'd like to get me a plastic bag and we want to we uh ever you it's okay but bag around you and you can see how long you can go without breathing i mean here we are subject to the laws that this supernatural put in place and we're reliant on the supernatural just think how long can we go without our heart beating our heart beats why does it beat it beats because the supernatural made it to be it gave it the life and so we we begin if we take a moment and we look we're reliant on the supernatural for our our very life because this supernatural was the life of men it says all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life you see what i'm saying in this supernatural was the very life that you have so if that oh that ought to be just the simplest answer in the world to the very fact that eternal life is a reality because life itself came from eternity so if life itself comes from eternity then we know that there must be eternal life see we only look at sometimes like eternal life like it's a reward but eternal life is in existence it always was it never changed you understand that the supernatural has always always been so if we would look at it like it's always been there because we're looking at supernatural over here on this side that the supernatural has always been there and and so we we know if if this is the uh the scripture tells us that in him was life and the life was the light of men and and so we know that everything that we are comes from this this supernatural and without this life if our heart stops we what perish we don't drink water we perish we don't breathe we perish we can go longer without eating but if we don't eat we perish so none of us possesses life within ourselves so as long as we have water as long as we have food as long as we have air and as long as our heart is beating we live for how long now my mom's 99 years old my dad passed away at 79 years old in the last few years i've seen many of my friends finish their journey here on life very few people one in millions live i think maybe there's a living being somewhere that might be 120 years old but even within everything we have we don't have life can you understand life comes from the supernatural so we know that in order to have eternal life we would have to have life from the supernatural and what is the gift of god the gift of god is eternal life so that's what god that's what god gives as his gift is eternal life so here we are we can't make it if we don't breathe we can't make it up our heart don't beat we can't make it if we don't uh have food we can't make it if we don't have water and if we just keep living and living eventually we'll perish so what reigns in us death death reigns in our mortal bodies we cannot live without the supernatural so we're already relying on the supernatural whether you believe in it or not whether you don't believe in genesis 1 1 whether you don't believe in john you the very looking in the [Music] mirror you should be able to know that you're living by some other source other than yourselves how many people have you talked to they might call it something else they might call it fate or they might call it a mystery or or or something or good luck but how many of you have come across life-threatening circumstances where just just by a miniscule second or or a different turn in events you wouldn't be here i i remember it still so vivid in me a testimony of me and leslie coming up from missoula montana on our our way up to seeley lake montana our first winner there and we didn't understand ice we didn't we didn't understand that where shade is ice doesn't go away and we're driving up on our volkswagen bus and and we're coming up and we come around this corner and we hit this patch of ice and we we go up and how many remember a volkswagen well this is what a volkswagen looks like and you're right here your steering wheel and you can see almost see the front bumper and we hit that ice and we go up over and we're headed towards the rail and we the rail disappears leslie falls on the floor of the of the van i throw my hands up i couldn't fall on the floor i threw my hands up and just cried out jesus help us when we came back to our senses we were around the corner sitting on the side of the road no recollection of driving no recollection of steering my hands weren't on the steering wheel or or anything but in our desperation we cried out to the supernatural but what gave us entrance into that supernatural was a word promise i am the present help in the time of trouble so that word became our entrance into the supernatural not only my mental intellectual part but the part that there was a part of supernatural in me because i was in god's thinking so when god being the creator of all heaven and earth and the creator of the supernatural he had a plan correct he's the creator of it and i was in that thinking from the beginning is that not correct we've been taught this that if we have eternal life we always had eternal life because we were in his thinking in the beginning so he had a plan he had my days he had what he wanted me to do so there there had to be an entrance into that supernatural and the only way into that supernatural the only entrance into that supernatural saint john 14 and 6 says i am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the supernatural but by me so there's only one entrance into the supernatural and and so whatever whatever came then from the supernatural right god said let there be let there be let there be so if there was nothing that existed nothing that was made everything that was made that was made was made by him okay so what existed first the supernatural so if the supernatural which is the creator of all things everything that was made in other words what he spoke or said let there be whatever came from the supernatural now was truth that's what it really is is that right all truth the word is true my word is truth heaven and worth will pass away but my word which is truth will never pass away so when you begin to see that truth came from the supernatural is that right back where truth came from so all if so the truth came from the supernatural so what the supernatural created was truth the word is true and it remains truth because it is truth what was spoken first or created is what the truth is that's where that's what the truth is my word is truth to what he said now there might be facts and there might be pictures drawn and there might be a lot of other things but we know one thing for sure that all truth cometh from the father of light so there's only really one truth and that's the truth that came from the word of god so the only way to enter the supernatural is by the truth right and he said my word is truth so that's true so there's only one way to get to the supernatural so when god created the heavens and earth when he created eden and he put his son and daughter in eden he told them don't eat of that tree of good and knowledge because the day that you eat thereof is the day you die and so the father of lies how many knows the father of lies i've met him a few times and guess what every time i met him he lied to me he's a liar and there's no truth in him he's the father of all lies god had a kingdom he had a truth he had a plan that's the truth it's always been the truth it'll never change and there's only one way that there's only one entrance into the supernatural and that's by the word of god let me read this statement if if it's in the world falling apart and uh see if i have it here make sure i got the right you know this one is in i believe it's god's provided place of worship it's page six paragraph 36 and we'll start with paragraph 35 i don't know if they can find it there or not i'd like you to i think it makes it easier for you to read along with it were they able to find that i don't see anybody back there but oh there is somebody all right this is uh in the message god's provided place of worship of 65 4 25 and brother ben says in paragraph 36 35 he says and this world must soon come to an end well if our life outside of the supernatural comes to an end and there's only one form of eternal life then anything that's outside of eternal life has to come to a what an end because there's only one form of eternal life and that's the supernatural that's why there's no eternal hell because if if if god's gift is eternal life you don't know how many people would rather suffer and live they'll do everything they can to hang on to life people don't want to die i kind of like what what peter and paul in them said to die for me is to gain the grave has no victory death has no sting i go to get a crown that's laid up for me i fought a good fight i've ran a good race i'd be believing it so anything that doesn't that wasn't in the supernatural to begin with it wasn't thought and spoken will come to an end and so he said here he says in this world must soon come to an end it can't go much longer sin is too deep now what is sin sin is unbelief what is it that they don't believe it's not really so complicated they don't believe in the existence of the supernatural and they don't believe that's where life came from neither do they believe that the very life that they have now is being sustained by this supernatural whether they believe it or not so if god's the giver of life and he would take that life away no man can survive on their own no man can survive no matter how smart they think they are how intelligent they think they are that can't survive we're totally reliant why why the lord asks paul why do you kick against the brick paul why do you fight don't you know i have a work for you to do don't you know i'm calling you you're going to be a messenger to the gentile and paul's here trying to to throw in prison and murder the very people that believe in the supernatural because they think it's heresy but god's got a different plan for his life and he's in this great big battle that's why the great prophet told this he says why halt you between two opinions if god be god serve him if baal be god serve him as for me and my house we'll serve the lord so as we we read this here he says he says sins too deep it's beyond hope there is no more hope for the world it's past that i believe the holy spirit is gleaning in the fields finding this one and that one for the hour is far spent the gospel has been preached to every nations isms and thinks has followed it but yet the gospel has went out went on just the same and now at the end time we see the things happening the way they they are there are great warnings amongst the elect people of god to find what is right it behooves us to know that now not somebody's theology but what is the truth so what what is eternal that that's what we should be looking for in other words we say eternal but what's another word for eternal what is super natural we should be looking for something that is super natural that's what we should be looking for this exists right the supernatural exists it's never changed it's always been the same the only way to get into it is through the word of god so it behooves us with the world falling apart don't can't we see the world falling apart people are waiting in lines and lines and lines for hours wouldn't it be wonderful if they were waiting in lines to get into church to have hands laid on them to receive the baptism of the holy spirit wouldn't it be wonderful if they were waiting for hours to come into the contact into the presence of the life-giver himself into the presence of of the supernatural who created heavens and earth who has all power that can do everything wouldn't it be more wonderful to get into that but we've got to come to a place where we believe in that we believe that's our hope my salvation cometh from the lord that's that's where all our confidence is for everything i think that it's by human nature we wait too long to run to the lord we have to exhaust everything else before we go there but that's how we are you know so let's just keep reading here he says it behooves us to know that not some theology but to know what is truth to know what is truth the supernatural is truth amen this supernatural is the only truth the only way to get there into the supernatural is by the word what the bible says is the truth and so we know that right by if we would read in hebrews the first chapter it says this god who at sun-dried times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets have in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds so if we come right back around to this truth to the supernatural now this supernatural is here for you that's what jesus came and preached he came and preached the kingdom of god the supernatural this place that that is truth where everything was made all power has been given to me over all heavens and all the earth i have power to lay down my life down and to take it up again just let this beautiful uh sink in for a second because it'll be too late one of these days for us and this may be the day so let's take real consideration of what god has said so what is what is god what did god say his what his word let us take real consideration of what god has said remember when god speaks a word he can never take it back he has to ever remain the same he can never say something and then say well i didn't exactly mean that see he is infinite he knows the best to begin with we say things that we think is best and after a while we take it back but god can't do that and remain god so he is infinite he does not do that because he is perfect in every word he never utters a word unless it's eternal so here's the supernatural the eternal and he utters a word now that word is what eternal now that becomes the entrance into your world god enters your world whether it's sickness whether it's finance whether it's no matter what troubles no matter whether things are going good or bad he only enters your world by his word so if i could say it this way it's a two-way street i don't have a better vocabulary but he gives his word and his word is the way back to him the only way in and if you believe it you take it if you're not sure then you're going to wait it the doorway we'll try to hurry up a little warm in here i think and people are falling asleep because that's because they were up all night praying for the service and fasting and it finally caught up with them this morning but it's okay brother graham said he preached to a lot of tired people so i guess i can too i'm going to hurry up i'm almost done he says so he said he does not do that because he's perfect in every word he never others a word unless it's eternal all of his all of his eternity was with him at the beginning his thoughts his attributes and they only expressed themselves in the world today all of it was with them the beginning in eternity we won't go there so we're just going to lay that down there and now we're going to switch gears just for a second so we know that we have the supernatural we know the only way under the supernatural is the word of god we know that in sun dried times and by diverse manners god spoke to us by this prophet then he spoke to us by his son is that right and man recorded the things that god said and said and he said it is the bible now where's our problem come well man took this book right so what are they going to do well first of all we have a scientist our brother general come here i call my general we appreciate your service today you are a scientist okay so you come right here mr scientist all right he's he's he's a scientist a scientist does experiments and things to further knowledge all right so we we we have we have a a a scientist all right kit come here you're going to be uh you come up here you're going to be a mathematician all right do you like math oh what can i say a mathematician [Music] lamborghini you come up here you come right here you're a politician have you ever met lamborghini he'll get you to vote for him all righty and now now we need uh let me see here yeah uh john you come up here you be a you're an educator all right john he can play any instruments you know some on the base today and the organ and everything all right so we've got an educator we've got a scientist a mathematician a a politician an educator i need a theologian all right so now all these guys come here here you go here's the book now i'll gather around the book here come up around the book and everything now they're going to read the book right and they're going to start looking a scientist is going to look at it and politicians going to look at it in the mathematician oh god said 7 here in 40 days here and this here and that here and he's going to look at it and now the educator is looking at it how am i going to teach this how am i going to explain it how am i going to make this fit together and and he's here he said hearing he spoke to his father and and i can do nothing unless my father shows me but yeah i haven't done so he's got to come up he's a and then we got the theologian he said how am i going to preach this so they take the word of god and they study on the word of god and they look on the word of god and then they say this is what god must have meant okay there's only one entrance into the supernatural but the only way the supernatural can be understood is by the supernatural it can't be understood by the politician but by the mathematician it can't be understood by uh by by the educator or the theologian it can it can't be understood by that so they look on the word of god they don't look at the word of god as an entrance into the supernatural they look at it as how can i present this to the people so they come up with a system he adds a little he adds a little he adds a lot he adds a little he adds hardly nothing because i don't believe in theologians and they come up with something right but since they can't all agree they create different what different systems for different tastes right and so once they a group of men determine that this is what it means or if i could say it this way this is what god meant when he said this right so they agree now they touch all all realms of society so now they have a gospel or an explanation of the word of god that everybody can swallow because they believe it's what they believe it's true they just can't understand it because it doesn't come by understanding what's it come by by revelation i am the way the truth the life i am the door no man cometh unto me unless the father leads them man can't get there it's impossible for the great minds of our age to be able to look at this word and find the door because the door has to be revealed you can't educate you can't come here and join church it doesn't do you no good if you know where the door is if you don't walk through it so they've come up with this great thing so every time a group of men comes together they put the word of god in certain orders they leave certain parts of it out because they can't make it fit they come up with certain ideas certain things all their ideas is what is called a creed a creed is man's expression or explanation of saying this is what god meant this is what he's saying we have studied the word of god and this is our interpretation of the word of god except our interpretation join yourself to the system that we're providing the system of thought this scripture means this this scripture means this this scripture means that this is what we believe this is our creed and everybody that joins themselves to that creed has now denominated around that creed thank you my great scientists my politicians my mathematicians my educators my spirit-filled brother so what has man provided because not everybody was in god's thinking oh but they've got a gospel for everybody you don't like one taste we've got all kinds of tastes our scientists and our educators in our mathematician has developed a taste that's perfect for you it's a thinking man's filter all your thoughts we've taken upon ourselves to take your thoughts filter them through our education and then feed you a creed that meets your taste how many have heard that message thinking man's filter here brother brahms telling them the supernatural is real there's only one way into the supernatural realm and that's by the word of god there's no other way all these people are doing is supplying you a temporary substitute something that fits your mind now if there's only one truth and there's so many different churches so many different doctrines and so many different creeds that something is wrong is that pretty simple not all the ways oh so they'll say it's like a wheel all spokes lead to the center so the person that created all of heavens and earth said everything in order can't provide a place of worship he can't provide a spokesman for the truth jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away all that cometh unto the father cometh through me and there's anyone that enters into the realm of eternal life which is where everything that you have need of exists your job exists there your food exists there your heartbeat exists there your breath exists there your water exists there everything you have need of comes from the supernatural and there's only one way into the supernatural there's one key to get in there that's his word and now here all these men come along with all these creeds and dogmas and substitutes and and everything and you notice none of them take you into the supernatural in fact some of them will actually deny that the days of miracles are here others will say you don't need that spirit you just confess that your sins are forgiven i don't want nothing i got to settle at the river i want to settle it now i want to know i don't want to substitute but god in in every time and he has spoken to us by his servants and by his prophets and so we have a place that that is supernatural and every promise in the bible is super naturally administrated he said he would not leave us nor forsaken us but he'd be with us even in us till the end so another don't worry what's going on in your minds that's where the battle is but there's a way into the supernatural and that's by his word by these great exceedingly great and precious promises we are partakers of what divine nature by these promises we are partakers of the supernatural who knows what we have need of even before we ask oh how how quicker things would happen in our lives if if we would first of all make entrance into the supernatural where he could speak to us we could lay our petitions before us he could reason together with us and show us why that's not the way to go that's the way to do we can walk from his throne saying yes my child i'll give that to you it's settled forever and and and like what brother tim read in the psalm i don't know if i caught it right but he he made simply it was a don't hasten or don't make a bad decision based on the pressures of your enemies and and the darkness that's coming against you we don't have to rush to quick decisions they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up like the wings of eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint that scriptural word that's an entrance into the supernatural and and so god promises us in this last day we have all this substitutes over here that five of the smartest men in the whole world has come up with none of them agreeing none of them showing any signs and wonders or proof that what they're saying is true they only appeal to one realm and that's the intellectual and the cardinal and reasoning we used to have a saying in montana it said sheep ten thousand coyotes can't be wrong because there's more of them then of you fear not little flock because it's one in a million because they've got multitudes united together against the belief that everything comes from the supernatural god never changed his mind about what his word what he spoke in the beginning is still the same it never changes it's not change in the beginning created he them male and female created he them they're still only males and they're still only females i don't care if the psychiatrist i must have left him out the psychiatrist the politician the educator the physicians feel they can change that you can't change god's word you can't do it that's the last thing satan wants to acknowledge he wants it to be his eden he wants to be the god of this evil age he wants man not to find the entry into the supernatural he doesn't want people to take this word on its own because god interprets his word by bringing it to pass he doesn't want anybody to take this word on their own take a promise of god enter that where and enter into the supernatural by the promise of god's word with nothing else supporting it science doesn't support it education math nothing supports it because it's the truth from the beginning and he opens this up to us that the realm we can enter into that realm and watch the supernatural be made manifested so here comes a man in our day people say why do you believe in a prophet because the system is not keeping the world from falling apart just the way it was said it would come it's coming lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god knowledge increasing men running to and fro every prophecy that the work which spoken is coming to pass but here comes one and his message is simple back to the word back to the scriptures back to the only way into the supernatural back to eternal life now what separates them oh their creed it'll touch all the mathematicians it'll touch all the politicians it'll touch all the educated it'll touch all the science they've got a gospel that's for everybody but the supernatural is only for those that are supernatural my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow because they have something in them that hears that voice it doesn't come by knowledge it comes by revelation he reveals the way i am the way the truth no man cometh unto the father but by me who do men say that i am peter said some say you're this the scientist said you were this the mathematician said you were this the politicians said you were this the civilization said you were that they say but who do you say that i am thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered them flesh and blood all my five or six flesh and bloods up here didn't reveal it to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you do you understand there's too much flesh and blood way too much flesh and blood people that have sowed ideas and sowed definitions and sold meanings but that's why god promised that there would be malachi 4 5. luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 that there would be a ministry that came back and returned the revelation back to the children what revelation did they have they saw that jesus was the son of god the way to the supernatural god's only provided place of worship and he came back to restore that faith in the key so you could get into the supernatural you may be going through a mental battle a physical battle financial battle i don't care what your battle is it's one answer and that's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever never change but you have all these voices you have all these people with their bibles all standing here one here his group is put together this is what he meant this is what he meant this is what he meant no this is what he meant this is what he meant this is what he meant he's three gods this is water baptism over here no speaking in tongues is evidence of that is speaking in tongues this one's over here no you've got to be baptized twice oh oh no you you've got to worship on saturday how many different explanations are there was if there's one eternal source then there has to be one truth because truth didn't originate from any other place but the supernatural so it if a man can't figure it out so god promised in our day the simplicity of this message that he would come and veil himself in flesh do the same signs and wonders that he did when he was here on earth with the jews to the gentiles so the entrance into the supernatural once again would return the hearts of the children to the faith that the word just the way it's spoken just the way it's written is the key to the supernatural you don't i'm not the key i'm not the door i'm not the way christian life tabernacle is not the key or the door william branham as a human being was not the key or the door but the words which he spoke was eternal because his ministry was to tell us what it was that jesus taught in the beginning what came from eternity that's how you know you're in your thinking that's how you know there's a lamb's book of life that's how you know there's water baptism that's how you know there's divine healing that's how you know there's not three gods because you have a voice that's speaking the truth when he comes the spirit of truth he'll lead and guide you and he'll tell you of things to come that's why last week i said you see the trinity because if you have a trinity you've got to make that scripture i think it's john 14 6 wasn't it find this real quick or did i just read john 14 and 6 16 and 16 and 4 right somebody help me 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth so remember we read that if god ever does anything it's by his what his spirit spirit moved upon the water so he says when he the spirit of truth okay what was eternal the truth what is the spirit of truth it's god right because all truth came from eternity is that right so the spirit of truth is what god spoke into existence when he created all things the spirit of a lie is the perversion that followed of man trying to explain and interpret god's word how does god interpret his word by bringing it to pass so when you understand there's only one spirit there's only one god you don't think saint john 1 and make it to people it's the spirit how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever things he shall hear that shall be speak and he will show you things to come when you begin to understand that it all comes from the fountain of truth so brother brahms that scripture fits brother abraham's ministry because it's he the spirit of truth was he who created heavens and earth right it was he that moved upon the waters it was he it was god that's why the messenger said when the holy spirit comes and does these things to speak one word against it in this world or the world to come there shall be no forgiveness for that so god veils himself in flesh come back to the gentile age and points to us back to the entrance into eternal life and none of the theologians the mathematicians the scientists the politicians or none of them can accept it and because they think that they're great in number and in worldly wisdom and they join their forces together they think they have strength and power but yet their world is falling apart and yet we're hid in the cleft of the rock not a real popular young people school age kids you that are here that go to high school you've got a pretty basic understanding of why we understand and know that god sent a prophet and pointed to us the way and restored the faith back in the supernatural the best thing you have going for you this morning is the supernatural do you love the lord this morning amen let's stand together this morning i believe that word is just maybe for someone in particular but it's really wonderful lord bless you will have communion service tonight brother paul will be speaking to us for communion service so if you can come out to the house of the lord for communion and foot washing tonight communion and foot washing will be at five o'clock this evening we're going to baptize have a couple baptisms up right now brother where are you are you here with your there you are you have the kids ready to go why don't you go ahead and take them back and brother chris if you would go help them and i think i need one sister to help with the can amanda help can you help okay go back and they'll get ready for baptism and so we'll pray if you have to go and and you're welcome to be dismissed if you'd like to stay for the baptism you're welcome to come up front and we'll baptize just after but if there's anything i can leave with you this morning it's the supernatural is still here never left never gone away satan's done everything to discredit it to run it down mark it make it a dirty thing try to hide it from us and make the word of god of none effect but the supernatural is still the elect's portion it always will be and it'll never change so let us bow our heads this morning [Music] what do you believe this morning [Music] do you believe there's a supernatural realm do you believe that it was put on display in our generation by the discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart by laying on of hands by inexpression of the divine power of god raising people from the dead and opening blind eyes the lame walking the deaf hearing the great supernatural on display in our day to once again restore the key to the supernatural oh god your word is the key to the supernatural any person that wants to come to the supernatural must come by the way of the word lord i pray that you take the simplicity of this thought this morning and our young people and i know many of them are away at the banquet and father we have those that are suffering with this new form of [Music] virus [Music] lord i know that many will go through a week or so of [Music] being uncomfortable and sickly feeling and weary but lord we have a promise that you bring us out of it all and we pray for them this morning that you can restore us back and we can be a healthy church again father dwelling together and praying one for another we ask you to bless the people [Music] there's anyone that has a special need this morning you'd like to raise your hand before the lord maybe a loved one that you have on your heart or an answer that you're seeking from the lord and you'll take the way of his word this morning heavenly father you see the hands that are raised this morning the petitions that are placed before your throne you said in your word come unto me all ye that are heavy-laden and i'll give you rest you said in your word cast your cares upon him for he careth for you and father they come to the supernatural with that word today to cast their cares at your feet father because they know you care father they bring their petitions before you knowing that you know what they have need of even before they ask but yet you beckoned us to come ask anything in of the father in my name and he'll grant it father it's on that word that we enter into the supernatural to get our answer we ask you to take each one of these petitions though they may not be able to express it though they may not have the words [Music] to make it real in their mind but you know their heart heavenly father you know what their heart is asking for and we ask that you granted in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you if you need to dismiss you are dismissed if you'd like to stay brother billy will lead us in worship while we prepare for the baptism god bless you oh [Music] oh jesus you're the captain try all your praise [Music] all your praises [Music] treasures of my heart [Music] present wrong [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh and all my days on earth [Music] the moment that i see you face to face [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] let your sweet aroma fill my life [Music] how [Music] make me a reflection of your love [Music] oh [Music] anyway open up the door [Music] show me what i never seen [Music] before you can take what's wrong and make

[Music] in your eyes jesus [Music] oh [Music] before [Music] oh lord i want to be a witness oh you can take what's wrong and make is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] this is definitely the cold grave of remission this morning amen sister hope his desire to be baptized she's heard the word of god and she's uh lord's dealt with her heart she's asked that we baptize her in the name of the lord jesus christ this says and this is found in the book of acts the second chapter and the third set seventh verse and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as our lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify
