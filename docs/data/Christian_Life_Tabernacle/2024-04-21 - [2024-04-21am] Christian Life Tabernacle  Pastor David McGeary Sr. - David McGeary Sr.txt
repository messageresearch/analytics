Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Christian Life Tabernacle
April 21, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Ellen with us is uh Adrian OT and the kids it's nice to have them with us this morning too let us bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father your love for us is unmeasurable the scripture and trying to relate it to man they said God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son Lord there's no way that I could eat even imagine sacrificing one of my own children for somebody else it it's inconceivable in my my mind and in my heart but yet you so loved us that you were willing to do that to restore us and to redeem us back [Music] Lord we certainly Express this morning our appreciation Lord and Thanksgiving for that Divine love that you so possessed thank you Lord and this morning Lord we're in certainly in trying times and we ask this morning that you would stir up our hearts and our minds by way of remembrance that we might serve you even more diligently than we have in the past Lord I ask for special overcoming Grace Lord the battle sometimes seems so long but we will endure with patience and run the race that's set before us we ask you to be with us now in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly nice to be in the house of the Lord this morning uh before we stand and read our scriptures we certainly uh um are grateful for everybody and and uh we want to let you know that we are uh still working a little things out here and there um uh we're especially working on the are conditioning that we can try to get it balanced and where everybody's not too cold now we're always going to have hot people and cold people that's scriptural you you know what I mean so the scripture says either be hot or cold so if you're wanting it perfect it's not going to happen CU we're trying to stay with this Bible the best we can so we we found out that maybe on the sides it's a little cooler than the center and uh that back left corner seems to be a little colder and different places but we're working on that okay so uh bring a sweater and uh and if you seem to get chilly we hopefully we'll get it all figured out one of these days and also we're not really supposed to park in the fire lane so that's the driveway kind of the street in uh there now we've named that street bride way that's what we call that in fact we're even going to put a street sign up that says bride way but it's a way it's not a parking spot so uh we're going to have to work on that so maybe some of the younger brothers tell we get the rest of the parking lot uh cleared out could maybe park down the street or or somebody but we're really not supposed to park in there so we want to do that also uh just for those who don't know um if uh the men's bathroom is on my left or your right and the woman's is on is on my right or your left so this is the men's side that's the woman's side um I I heard some brothers got confused the other day you know um I surely don't want that Spirit to end up in our church so um then uh also uh we have uh a nursery and that's because we're we um this year uh we're um expecting to have 10 births this year so we have um uh this on this side is a Nursery if it's if it's for nursing mothers Nursery this over here is the cry room okay so there's a difference okay it's not an overflow okay so you you should never have two parents in the cry room at a time so it's not a place that you're uh um you just automatically go so you're not in church you say well I have a child that's not uh you know doesn't behave well you know bring them into the house of the Lord and pray and maybe an atmosphere will come and the Lord might be able to do something to help uh help them along the way we're here to raise children in church you know what I mean uh I I know in the world system they they have daycare raise their children have uh the school take care of them and feed them but we want to raise our children and and up in the word of the Lord so that's a cry room it's not a it's for you to take your child in there settle him down uh let them know that U that there's uh if he doesn't behave there's worse to come and then get him back into the house of the Lord and act and raise them up so uh also we have a little box in the back it sits on a counter on it it's written tithes and offerings uh but you also May write a suggestion if you have a suggestion just write a suggestion and and put it in there and we will read them that may be all the further it goes but but um but at least you can voice your opinion don't Corner the deacons and and that just write it down you know what you suggest and and uh uh if if there's something we can do about it we certainly will so we just trust the Lord your blessing today we' like to read a few scriptures and and fellowship a little bit with you this morning out of the message called The Rapture and so let us stand and we'll read a few scriptures this morning we'll get right into our our thought this morning won't try to keep you uh too long and that you might uh enjoy the good things of the Lord so we'd like to start by reading in 1 Thessalonians U the 4th chapter and the 13th verse and he's Paul speaking here he says but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so then also which even even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep or shall not hinder them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and then which we we then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord amen therefore Comfort one another with these words amen isn't that a great comfort amen and let's also turn over to a second Thessalonians the 3 chapter and we'll read uh through the fifth verse he says finally Brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not Faith but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil and we have confidence in the Lord touching you that you both do and will do the things which we command you and the Lord direct your hearts in the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ amen and also we just like to read a scripture found in Hebrews the 12th chapter in the first verse wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight of sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before for us Heavenly Father we ask you to uh bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated this morning I think one of the greatest uh victories uh and tools to victory for the believer is to recognize the day and the time that they live in and the message or the word to that age uh so again we say that that it's one of the greatest tools to Victory it it's also is what uh establishes the believer and settles the believer that they they might be able to be steadfast because Satan's the author of confusion that's how that he gains Victory is he makes you unstable and and we know that a man that is tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine then he becomes unstable in all his ways and there's a continual uh uh result of instability uh you're not sure of where you're going you don't send a sure message uh you you don't have a sure testimony uh your light can't shine uh in any specific direction or or or you you fact you you when you're unsure you don't have much backbone you don't you can't stand up and make a stand you you lose the ability to be affirmative and and to hold the position so if if you're not uh if you're not sure and you don't have Clarity then it's very easily to be tossed to and fro and and to be carried about and the the result of that is is it doesn't even uh it doesn't even signify uh any light there's not light that can come uh from an unstable uh uh person or someone that is not stable in their ways you wouldn't look to that person as an example or if I could say it that way you wouldn't follow somebody who didn't know where they're going uh I remember a story that was uh told to me the first time that I I went up into the hills of of West Virginia and and any of you have been in that country it's just hills and everywhere and a fellow got lost so he got behind a fella and so he was following this guy staying right behind him the GU going down Hills and hollers and everything and all of a sudden the guy stopped you know and it was real foggy out you you just hardly could see the the front of your car it was so foggy and the guy stopped and so he got out of his car and walked up to the guy and said why' you stop the guy said I'm in my driveway see he he was following somebody but he didn't even know where the guy was going and I I just say that because it's important that we recognize where that we are and uh and that we have Clarity on on what it is that we recognize the day that we're living in the hour what we're living and and what is the message to us what it is is that God speaking to you what it is that he wants you to hear what it is that he wants you to recognize but everything that God does he does with the purpose so there there's nothing that's happening here and if I could say it this way if if you would allow me to to say it that the the the whole focal point of God and everything he he does is his elect lady a a amen everything is based on you the grace of God the love of God is directed to you so and and he doesn't want you to get caught up a good soldier doesn't entangle themselves in the Affairs of the world uh you know we as we as a human beings we measure uh and compare ourselves one with another and uh you know our countryes at a time where they're going to pick a new leader or the same leader whichever way they decide to go but you know really that's not who's the the lord of the air and the ruler of this Earth You know what I mean so it doesn't matter what they're doing that's not who we want governing in our lives we don't want our lives governed by the government we don't want our lives governed by science we don't want it governed by education our our desire is that the the word of the Lord Reigns in our hearts and that that's what we want we want to have sure Clarity and understanding of what God's message is to us and and and what is our place and our participation uh what what is the thing that we want to do uh we're not trying to straighten out the world but we are trying to manage Our Lives according to the word of God and so uh we we certainly notice I I believe that we're uh we're definitely in perilous times I don't think there's um any question about those things I think that we we notice uh that uh there's definitely wars and rumors of wars it it's striking to me when uh you hear commentators can you hear newspaper headlines and radio flashes that uh our country is closer to world war or the world is than they've been in so many years um that is quite a uh striking thing um no doubt uh many of you have heard that uh that you know they're launching rockets and missiles um at Israel and Israel is retaliating back and and in our country now uh on the streets everywhere just college campuses in the streets all all across the uh the land is a a crying voice death to Israel you know do away with Israel uh and you know whether the world likes it or not that's God's children they're God's people um uh we know that their eyes were blinded uh for our sake the G sake that we might be able to uh hear the gospel uh uh and that he might also have a gentile bride and so we we find ourselves and if I could say it this way uh what do you think right now is going on in the minds of those that are spiritual in uh Israel maybe whether the 144,000 whether we understand where they are or who they are uh uh and that's not the point I'm trying to clarify this morning but I imagine there's people there now that are in deep consideration of the time of Israel what what is happening to our country what is the future of our nation and uh we know that there's a political Israel but we also know that there's a spiritual Israel amen but and you know and we know that not all Israel is Israel if we could say it that way but there's an election and God always deals with the elect people uh other people are there but the God's elected plan for his people that's the reality of what's transpiring it's it's not uh what the newspaper says the New York Times is not the explainer of reality uh radio stations Fox News CNN NBC ABC they are are not the uh uh explainers of reality uh we know is the scripture tells us that to to watch Israel you know what I mean watch the Fig Tree watch what's happening and if if and I I'm trying to talk this about where our place is if they are under the threat of elimination and now people can vocally speak out and divide our nation over the the court or the destruction of Israel so if in the timeline in the time piece that God's put there and you know our messenger told us to look to them and to watch them is that there there's actually an effort to uh take them out and and so if we could say that their clock is ticking you know what I mean it's running out they're in a fight for their survival they're they're actually uh uh there's a measure of war and and and instability that uh people feel that they can strike out and eliminate and what stopped that for so long is the United States of America stood up and said you you you harm Israel you harm us but we're not there anymore you understand that's not a conclusion that our country is United behind anymore another we're not we as a whole and as a nation we're not sure now about our stand for Israel and I'm not trying to go to the politics side of it but I do want to go to the time piece of it the to the recognition that there's something going on over there and I as I see what's politically going on I wonder what that uh Orthodox Jew that uh that believer there that's deep with into the scriptures and and and I've been told that they study the the word of of God Is So their their lives are given to reading the original Scrolls and the Scrolls and knowing the word of God that you could take a book of the Bible and and roll it up and take a needle and press it through the the the rolling of that and they could tell you what words that that needle penetrated in other words they know their scripture they know their prophecies I wonder what they're seeing how that they're determining their prophecy what what what time do they think that they're in then they're sitting there as a nation so not only politically are they going through a great conflict but I wonder where the where the believer is the the the the real devout one that looks to serve God and and to live by God and live by the Commandments and and keep themselves purified and is keeping the law and is doing all that they can to stay true to the to Israel I wonder what the uh I wonder what the uh uh beating of their heart is what their mind is what and reading it and knowing that there's God somewhere in it all in other words there's go Where's God what's he what's going on what's transpiring what's taking place uh uh something's on the move here the spirit of God's moving God fixing to move is it the time of the Messiah uh could you imagine the spiritual questions the trouble with us we sit numb you know we we sit on Church benches not even recognizing that God's moving there there's great events that are taking the place things are coming to pass uh a rapid the the signs are everywhere the fashing Red Lights of the sign of his coming is flashing flashing flashing uh things that are prophesying uh prophecies are coming to pass right and left and and we sit back and and and we be we we're unengaged we just think that all things continue as they are where is the sign of his coming uh where is uh the awareness or uh uh the alertness uh or the self-examination or anything that uh takes place uh it it just you know that's what they said oh we've been here before all things go on the same and in the last 20 years uh the moral decay of of our country is is unspeakable and it ought to be it ought to be sending signals it to say it as easy as I can it uh I believe we call it a wakeup call it ought to be a wakeup call uh to our country that we've seen so many of the things things that our Messenger prophesied to us that he revealed to us in seed form we actually see it growing at to in into strong bushes and plants but not only that now they're putting forth their fruit and people eat the fruit thereof remember the the death you know was the partake of the life of of the of the fruit of the tree of of of Good and Evil and it that partaking of that tree and I'm not going to go into serpy but it bore children it had Offspring and if you don't think the the philosophies and the teachings and and the things that are are transpiring now are bearing children they're they're raising people that think that way they're raising people that stand for those kind of things so you're you're not in your isolated world if I could say this darkness is creeping in all around us until it becomes dark the thinking's dark the actions are dark it becomes a Godless nation and the scripture says not wishing to retain God and their knowledge God has given them over to a reprobate mind and and I hate to say it this way but soon our whole world and our whole country and everything's going to be run by a bunch of reprobates people that don't consider God that are lying all their hope into science and education and they think they're going to fix the future you know uh dig a hole in the ground and escape the atomic bomb you know fly to the moon and live in another place in in in everything there's only one flying away I want to do and it's Way Beyond the moon so we realize that that the our course and our path to Victory is to recognize the day that we're living in to to overcome means to recognize Satan in every one of his tricks the the Overcomer must recognize the two spirits in the framework of the church and withstand the other one and and the we want to withstand if I could say it this way as we just read in Hebrews we we want to withstand the laziness the lukewarmness we want to withstand the Amnesia that that's upon the church we want to with understand the complacency that we we find out in our daily lives that uh our routines uh just keep us at the same path that we are sort of like what we would say treading water or running on a treadmill running and not going anywhere but we've got to we've got to shake ourselves if I could say it that way and bear witness that there's something going on there's something going on we need to recognize what is happening what's happening in our country what's happening in the world what's what's transpiring what what is God's message to us are are do we have the vision uh clear of where we are and what it is that we need to prepare for and are we preparing and and because if I could interject this is along with recognizing the day and its message and recognizing the time that we are living in and and recognizing the circumstances and the spirits that we're fighting along with the recognition of this and the realization of where that we are a and where that we need to be uh presents to us great opportunity great opportunity to rise in spiritual Heights uh so you know that's a uh I don't want us to miss the opportunity that lays before us this morning to obtain the victories that we're so need of and the spiritual growth that we're so need of and the the the the most important event for the believer is the rapture there there's nothing that's more important to the believer than the Rapture now we're living in the age of lady oia so it it's it's a age where people are blind miserable poor wretched naked and don't know it and they they feel that they they don't have need of anything because thou sayth Thou Art rich and clothed in fine riment that we have need of nothing and that is a reality that a lot of us sometimes can't even recognize when we're in that condition ourselves you know when we're self-willed and a way Seth right unto a man but the end of that way is death uh they they uh AR aren't subject to any type of leadership but their own discernment and and so a man sets his course he just he's uh he thinks he's right he thinks he's on the right path and he has no measuring he has no measuring stick whatsoever to uh to view his life he doesn't have a mirror to look at and he doesn't have a yearim thund you know something that uh is uh uh he he he goes to in in the time of uncertainty and and and the time of seeking leadership he doesn't have something that he goes to something that becomes his absolute something that draws a clear picture for him that he can say oh this is where I am it's like in the mall or you'll go and you'll have these signs up and and all of a sudden there's a button that says you are here now do you this morning in your life have a spot in your life that says you are here that's important it's important to morning that you know where you are we've we've discussed for months and years and years preaching to the church who they are who you are who you are who you are but I A lot of times it doesn't matter who you are if you don't know where you are and I I I think it's real important that the church recognizes where are we what is going on where are we where are we in time where are are we what day are we in what's transpiring what's God doing uh how's the spirit moving and man offers all kinds of substitutes man offers Revival we we sat here and we preached through the message of the hour and and talked and and showed it in the scriptures how that there would be a false Revival and and and we've seen those revivals come and go but there's one thing that has not changed is the law of God's word the word is always correct and so even though in a sermon I could never cover it exactly all perfect but I I will just try to uh shed a little bit of light if I could not in the way of explaining but in the way of stirring up our Pure your mind that we ourselves would examine ourselves and take a look at our position uh uh our positioning and our spiritual growth and our spirituality to take a look at our lives to see where our effort is going what are our labors into uh you know have I gained any ground uh if a person's working working working and they're not gaining any ground financially they're not gaining any accomplishment at all it's time that that person sits down and considers the fact you know I might consider doing something else this isn't getting me anywhere you know it might be as simple enough as asking your boss for a raise you know but if you're not going to continually do the same thing over and over again and expect to get different results the results have already proven they've already been Vindicated you do this you do this you do this look at where you are go back five years look at what you were doing well look where you are you know if if you got a ton of credit card uh debt now and you go back five years and you say oh you know I I I I had a bunch of credit card debt I got rid of this I did this I got rid of the credit card debt and now you got a big old bunch of credit card debt it might be a good thought to you that something you're doing ain't right that's on the carnal side that's the natural side and we know a lot of times the natural types the spiritual so we're talking a minut this morning that it behooves us to have a recognition of the time that we're living and what message are we receiving what what are we hearing God speak to us because this is not a staying message this is a leaving message we're not here to preach how to make life easier for you here and how to get along Paul just absolutely taught us in one sentence how to get along he says pray for us that we don't have to contact unreasonable men cuz all men don't have faith pretty simple what you hang around with so let us just take a moment if I could say it this way and we'll go back to Thessalonians here and and read this scripture once again found in first Thessalonians and he says and Paul says for this we say unto you the 15th verse for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep shall not hinder for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we want to just take a moment if I I could to uh uh read a few statements and comment on that because I certainly believe that's where we are we are living in the day of the voice of the shout the voice and the Trump we're living in that time and and and that day and uh there's things that we certainly know for a fact and and one of the things we know for the fact is that the Rapture is only this Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride this Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride so if I consider myself bride then I realize what is for me is for the bride so I I've got I've got to come to that conclusion I'm that bride I'm the bride so therefore if this Rapture is for the bride is for this elect lady is for this chosen people there's an elect people that are going to be raptured or translated or are going to be caught up into the air uh with the Saints to meet the Lord in the air and forever to go be with the Lord so we got to ask ourselves do I number myself among those people that's do I number myself am I one of them and now if if that's the promise for the bride that elected people that is promised this resurrection and we know that's the last event on the horizon for the believer is the catching away of the church and so if that's what is in my future I will use that word because it even though it could be this morning morning then it I I imagine if I believed for certain that I was going to take a trip I would prepare for that trip I would make sure I had my documents I would make sure I had my my ticket I would make sure I had my itinerary now you don't want to travel with me because I just pull into a place and figure we work it out you know Leslie and I we we went to a country to do a wedding so we were very close by so we thought we'd fly over to Ireland so we flew into Dublin and we got to Dublin and we thought man this Dublin hotels everywhere you know well it was the same weekend they had this band I guess they called them YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube or whatever and the national Irish Soccer Championship there wasn't a room in Dublin anywhere and here we are just dragging our bags up and down the road wondering where's the hotel is there a hotel you got room no no rooms so finally some guy said hey I think I know where there's a room now when I say room what do you think you think a room a hotel room right bathroom a bed dresser couch a room right a room no this was a room which most of us in America call a closet so we found a bed in the closet why cuz we didn't have an itinerary we didn't have a reservation not basically we were unprepared for the circumstance that presented ourselves thank God for a good Praying Wife because we would have spent our first night in the park if it wasn't for somebody just coming along and guiding us to a room well this is too great of an issue to take lightly you don't want to miss your departure time you want to be on time you want to be prepared you want to make sure you've got the token You' got to make sure you're going to pass through customs you're your your everything has got to be ready and so we see that these great things and and so we realize that it's only the bride that's going to go in this Rapture and I'd like to read this from paragraph 65 and 66 but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her yes amen so it takes it Beyond just being an event am the Rapture is more than a date on the calendar the Rapture is a revelation or if I could say that a faith it's a condition you've got to be in rapturing condition if the same spirit that that was in Jesus Christ dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal body so it wouldn't matter about the time frame if I could say it's April 15th or it's April 30th or or if I said a time or a date which no man knows that but it still wouldn't matter if you didn't have the spirit in you that quickened you when that time came right so what would be more important knowing the time or having the spirit that quickened you when that time came that's why he didn't care that we knew the time because the importance wasn't on the time the importance was on the condition the condition that you're in that's what's important that that you're ready for the event and God never brings judgment now the Rapture to you might be a great Victorious thing if you're a Believer but it's judgment to the rest of the world that's right cuz the only thing that's holding this place together now is the believer and she's few and far in between and she's got lots of spots and wrinkles in her feast she's invaded with the lukewarm with the Sunday churchgoer with the person that doesn't wash feet and doesn't take communion that that doesn't contribute and and administer to the body lot of Benchwarmers that's not just in this Church such just the world but they've been taught that the Rapture is a time it's going to happen one day and when it happens it happens and alls I have to do is uh be a believer Satan believes the thing that Satan lacks is Resurrection Life a life that can resurrect him now I don't so say those things to condemn anybody body but if I could say this it's to wake them up wake them up who do you think you're fooling you can pray like an angel and live like a devil it just it it there's no way we know by comparing ourselves one to another there's only one thing you can do as an individual is stand up into the face of your own real it and ask yourself the depth of your sincerity how committed am I to the Rapture how committed am I to making it how how well is that everything to me or would I like to schedule it in my time uh book you know whatever you call those books where you write your dates and stuff and say okay the Rapture will fit in for me between July 25th and July 27th other than that I'm pretty packed Lord you should have nothing in the whole world more important to you than making the Rapture it is the most single thing to do now don't fear you don't have to make it he will guide you he will instruct you he will lead you he will provide for you everything that he needs to provide for you and the first thing he wants to provide to you is the recognition of the hour that you're in so you can make preparation the time is at hand it's a revelation that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture Give me a definition of the true bride of Christ one who's waiting for the revelation of the Rapture they're looking for it what's the sign of it what's the sign of his coming wh what what what are the flashing red lights how am I going to know how am I going to know that uh I'm getting close look at the message look at the day look at the events look at the flashing lights that are flashing out in front of you and say wait a minute I just might be at the doorstep of the Rapture amen I might I might take heed to what's important what I'm praying for I might get serious for a moment and I preaching this to me especially now it's a revelation for Revelation is Faith you cannot have Revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what has been revealed to him as though it wasn't so I don't care what goes on out there if I'm fixed on that Rapture I understand what's going on what's taking place how it's unfolding and I can sit right back and say I'm in the midst of the unfolding of the revelation of the Rapture it don't matter what's happening out there I got sing less of heart that's what faith is it's a revelation of God the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body and and we we we follow that down and we understand and one of the greatest Revelations we had but in the book was written but then remember remember it was sealed with Seven Seals and the Seven Seals was not to be opened Revelations 10 until the sounding of the last Earthly angel on Earth Revelations 10:7 and in the day of the sounding of the last Angel's message seventh Angels the mysteries of God should be finished in that age and that's the age we're living in look now we've at least established that we're in the end time and the sign of the end time if I could say this in humility wasn't the pulls that brother renam used to to catch the attention of the people because everybody went out and impersonated that everybody was taking people by the hands everybody had oil everybody's Discerning just made a complete mockery of it but when it came down to it only the word of God through a prophet could reveal what was in those Seven Seals and it would only be revealed to the elect to whom that it was written because it was assigned to her that you're in the the coming of the Lord when the angel descended and took the book in his hand and put his foot on the land in the sea all those beautiful types we've seen in our generation come to pass John was going to write but he said don't write in the days of the voice of this angel he will reveal what was written in here and and man had been probing at it forever always throwing it down in the future and the messenger made this statement he said you'll find out that a lot of what you're looking for has already come to pass and then when we saw the seals open we saw the beauty of God laying out seven Church ages and then coming right back and watching those horse riders move up through those Seven Ages and actually reveal to us that most of it had already taken place and now we're in the last part of it we're in our part of it your part of it this is the part that you're a part of this this is the thing that he's flashing before your eyes that that you can see what's transpiring again we'll read now the Rapture is only the Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride remember the Bible said and the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years this great Rapture is there not a Rapture friends where are we at where are we going what are we going to do what age are we living in listen to these great questions paragraph 81 the these are the questions that he's asking now he's not asking them they're unbelievers these questions are to you cuz you're the only ones reading the message you're the the only one that recognize he's a prophet you're the only ones that's that that heard that voice and were attracted to it so these questions are to you they're your questions these are the things he's wanting you to consider is there not a Rapture friends Jesus said I call you friends because what you know what I'm doing that's right if you're a friend of a prophet you receive what a prophet's reward what does God what's the prophet's reward God does nothing until he first reveals it to a servant the prophet the reward that you have of being a friend of the Prophet is the revelation of what the prophets revealing [Applause] he he said is there not a Rapture friends where are we at where are we at right now this morning what is going around on around us and where's our button that says this is where we're at what are we going to do great question what are you going to do now that you know who you are you know where you're at what are you going to do you ever hear the expression what are you going to do about it you know what are you going to do if you know something's broken you go oh uh the car's broken duh what are you going to do about it are you going to fix it are you going to junk it are you going to buy the part are you going to sell it but you can't do nothing hear me this morning you can't do nothing you've got to get give yourself a good understanding of where you're at and do something what age are we living in what promise do we have there is going to be a Rapture the Bible says there will be and it'll it'll be only for the elect the elect lady the bride in this day that's pulled out the church and and so we we say in this day so we understand one of the first things that's happening is a pulling out we already know the seed separates from the Shu but there's also a pulling out so that's happening within you there's got to be a pulling out away from the world there's got to be a laying down of other goals and other Ambitions and placing the Rapture in its proper place that's what I'm living for that's what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for the rapturing faith I'm waiting for the Revelation now where does faith come from it comes from the word of God and hearing the word so if he wants to give you this Faith he's got to show you what's trans inspiring so you can see it and have eyes have and see and say whoa this is where I'm at I'm in the midst of it right now it's going on and what's my response now as far as I'm concerned I see nothing but Saints and everybody around you can see Saints the most important thing is what do you see in yourself and how do you measure your own self so the a real question would be are you being pulled because that's what this is he says the bride in this days that's pulled out so he's trying to pull us out there's a a a pulling out that's transpiring here the a a a a separation of what's happening now he's going to tell us that three things take place he says three things happen a shout a voice a trump has to happen before the Lord appears now a shout Jesus Does all three of them when he's when he descends descending now man you've got to understand man's problem is is they think literally or they think in a straight line so they think this event's got to happen then this event's got to happen then this event got to Heaven there they've always been taught step one step two step three I talked with my architect today and visiting with him the other day and we were visiting he says the biggest problem people have is they can only see one line they can't visualize in three dimensions but as Architects we got to think dimensionally and that's the way man thinks he thinks this then this than this but we understand that he does all three of these he's a God of all space in all time he can do more than one thing at a time just like he's not three persons he's father son Holy Spirit one person in three offices he can possess and operate all three offic at one time so first it's not oh I see this happening and I'll kind of blow that off but when I see this happening no no he does all of these things when he's descending when he comes forth to take the book when he comes forth he's doing all of these things that the the same time when he makes his move to man all these things are transpiring they're all going on at the same time you can't sit back and say oh there's a shout here and next is this and next is that no it's all happening it's all transpiring it's all going on a perfectly according to his time you say well I thought Israel God's dealing with Israel he's dealing with them more than theyve ever been I imagine there's just think in that country where a country just launched a a a rocket at you and it could have been nuclear and they've got so much hatred that they don't care if they nuke you oh we just living under such a false sense of false security he says he says has to happen before Jesus appeared now a shout Jesus does all three of them when he's descending a shout what is a shout it's the mess message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride hall now God has always God has a way of doing things and he never changes his policy he never Chang he's he's un unchanging God in Amos 3 and 7 he said he would do nothing on Earth until first he revealed it to his servants the prophet and just as certain as he promised it he'll do it now here's the messenger telling the church hey the shouts going on The Voice is going on the Trump is going on he's doing all three of these things but man is caught up in this lineal event AB C D no God's way beyond our timeline that's right or us figuring it out he says he says so he promised he'd do nothing he opened the seals he discerns the thoughts and intents of his heart we don't have to go into the ministry of the son of man but we are trying to did get this morning is to stir stir up our Pure Hearts by way of remembrance he ordained these things to be and he must send this the first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together so if the message is here the descending has has already started it's on its way so you're in the process of it you understand it's it's started it started now if you got a single event in your mind a date and you're lineal and you think oh it's a date it's a time it's a place but when you realize it's a revelation it's a condition that God's going to reveal to his elect lady his bride what is going on and what I'm doing because we're his friends and then we can sit back and look at the picture and by looking at the picture we might take heed and realize it's time to get ready I'm going to try to hurry well I maybe spent too much time trying to lay a foundation but it's said the first thing to come he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together a message comes forth first now it's lamp trimming time rise and TR trim your lamps what watch what watch was that it was the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise in trim your lamp and they did some of them found they didn't have any oil in the lamp see but it's lamp trimming time it's Malachi 4 time when when you come it's Luke 177 it's Isaiah and all those prophecies that it can perfectly set in order for this day in the scriptures we see it living right there see there's see these things happen my dear brother sister when God in heaven knows I could die in this platform right now you just ought to walk around a while it's just tremendous when you see God coming forth from the heaven hallelujah what he saying the walk around is just tremendous when you see God coming forth from the heaven Lord give me isab that I might see he's coming forth from the heaven it's a revelation to the bride but he can't do it until he first reveals it to his servant the prophet and then through the word of God he gives the Revelation to the believer that they too can look up for they know their Redemption draws nigh and they can see him coming from the heaven Glory when you see God coming from the heaven standing for groups of men and standing there declaring himself just as he he ever did and that's the truth and it's the Bible open see we're here now let's just take this in closing and I I'm I I won't I'll just read two more statements and I'll wrap the point up he says so we know that there's a shout a voice and a trump and he he he he goes on to say he says the first thing is the sounding the first thing is the Trump or the voice no a shout and then a voice and then a trump a shout a messenger getting the people together second is the voice of the Resurrection the same voice a loud voice of in St John 11:38 and44 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead to be caught up with it watch the three things take place he's not talking about the future if and he'll say it here in a little bit but it's a voice of the Resurrection yes so you know we were dead in trespass and sin yes we were we were spiritually dead but there was a voice that awakened us up the sleeping bride it awakened her wake up it it it it it's the the the shout contains the voice contains the trumpet it's not oh we're just in this part of it the next part of it coming no there's something big going on here it's the end of time is going on here it it's it's taking place we've arrived we're [Music] here it ought to make a shout or get sincere or go home and apply the token he says now watch the three things take place the next is what was a trump a shout a voice a trump now the third thing is a trump which is always the Feast of the trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper the Lamb's supper with the bride in the sky but what takes place it's a calling an invitation so he's offering the invitation to the wedding supper he he has a shout to get you to gather you up a uniting time and sign it's a voice to call you out of the Dead Slumber of sin and dead religions out of your spiritual grave and it's a trump calling you to the feast so you just don't hear the message and then this is the invitation to the wedding of supper you're not going to get another one it's not going to come another way you know the parable how he sent his servants out and finally he sent his son what do you think came in this generation what do you think the son of man was what do you think he did when he came and he took the book that's why this generation is guilty for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ what was transpiring in this message was the beginning of the Rapture of the church the events were unfolding the shout was the message the voice wak up the sleeping virgin listen what he says see the first things come forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride the one that's dead back in other ages they're caught together and the Trump the feast is in the heavens in the sky what is it that's the thing that's taking place friends am amen amen we're already we're right there ready now the only thing is the church coming come out has got to lay before the sun and ripen the great comine will come by after a while the wheat will be burned the shock but the grain will be gathered into the Garner so you can look at it and if I could say this way our messenger explained it the word of God has a compound meaning so if he ever does one thing he does everything the same way over and over again that's the law of things so so he has his bride so he's going to have a shout for the bride he's going to have a voice for the bride and he's going to have a trumpet for the bride the one TR the trumpet's calling Israel to the Feast of the trumpets but it's calling the bride to the wedding supper that's right it's not only is it calling the Dead the in the church before call calling them to life but it's calling the bride that's alive on the earth it's calling them to life the Resurrection Life the spirit life the Revelation that's going to Rapture not only is it a trump calling them to their feast it's a trump calling us to the Feast of the wedding supper so it's going transpiring in the natural and it's transpiring at the same time in the spiritual to the bride parallel going on compound meaning uh there's not much time left it's all happening and I could let me just put this in here for the what Paul said in Hebrews 121 you know let us run the race before us you know what ripening of the sun is it's it's it's overcoming that's what it means to ripen means to overcome yes sir what does it mean to mature it means to overcome and and I like to just say this to you you know pick one thing and overcome it don't try to overcome the whole world don't try to overcome everything that's wrong with you do it one thing at a time how did he gr go to Richmond I think the quot he took it one City at at a time one thing at a time pick that one thing in your life that you know is not right and deal with it get that put away then go to the next one go to the next one overcome but don't be so caught up with everything that's wrong with you that you don't move it all it's like having so many stuff on your plate that you just go in circles do I do this do I do this do I do this do I do this and then you stop and you go no maybe I do this pick one do it check off the list this is done this is done I did this my most successful days is when I write a list of everything I have to do I check it off I check it off I check it off I get it done but when I don't then I have a bunch of half tackled tasks I got a bunch of undone things the last thing the bride does she sits in the sun she's got her invitation to the wedding supper she's been brought to life by the voice of the Resurrection she's heard the shout that unites her with the bridegroom and they have the invisible Union the prophet of God said the wedding takes place here let us mature sir therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout and the Trump the same morning with a loud voice he screamed out with that shout and the voice and woke Lazarus with a loud voice saying Lazarus come forth see and the voice wakes up the sleeping bride the sleeping dead and the Trump with the sound of the Trump and when it does it always a trump calls Israel to the Feast of the trumpets which was the Pentecostal Feast the great feast in the sky and the Feast of the trumpet and now a trumpet denounces a calling together Calling To The Feast now what is the the Lamb's supper in the sky the assembling together in the bride the Feast of the trumpets the wedding supper and so I'm I'm I made my note this is our call to the supper you've been invited you've been called put on the wieding Garment get ready to go so we we see you know a trump also denotes war and so we see God's dealing with Israel and when we see the Fig leaf fig tree put forth as leaf we know that the Gentile days are number when we see Israel they may have a Palestinian State they may have a border I don't care about that I know one thing there's a spiritual Israel in there that's on their knees before God Amen that search in the prophecy that wants to know where they're at and what the promises are for this day I wouldn't be surprised at all if if the very word of God that God fulfilled brings them all that come across this message yes I don't know I can't prophesy that but I know what contains the truth I know where the Mysteries are I know where the revealed word of God is I know where Jesus Christ is revealed but that's our Victory yes sir is to know who we are where we are what it is we're facing and what's going on the shout the voice and the Trump they're in full swing yes they're in full array they're accomplishing the purpose of each one of them that's right he's doing them all that the the same time they're all at work they're all performing what they were intended to perform and You by the grace of God thank you Lord because God could do nothing unless he first reveals it to the prophet yes sir comes to you elect lady and opens up Hallelujah the whole process of what's going on now it's here we're in it time is in it the world is in it the events are in it they're all coming to pass the question is are you in it have you connected with it have you connected your life with it have you prayed for the revelation of it Lord give me isav that I might see does it have enough effect on us that we're willing to make changes in our lives we're willing to overcome we're willing to grab victories we're not trying we don't need to talk our way out of things you know you can't love your way out of sin it is what it is amen you know if you need help you need help aren't you glad there's a God that can help just like my little woman that washed Jesus's feet prophet of God said she thought in her mind if I go down there and wash his feet he'll know what I do he'll know where I got the money he already knows what you're doing but she knew one thing he was the only person that could help him Lord help me be more sincere help me have a life that reflects the hour and the message that I'm living let my light be a candle that my light so shines among men no man lights a candle and P puts it under a bushel but he lights that candle handle like no man has thus saith the Lord and doesn't tell the world you know what the prophet of God said he said if the God told me thus saith the Lord George Washington would rais from the grave you know what he said he'd do I'd tell the whole world because it's the word of God you don't have to have if you hide it you ain't got it it's the word of God and if we believe if we understand and we believe the Rapture is on okay it started the events have been fold the messengers come the shouts went forth the voice that's going to raise the Dead the same voice that called you out of sin and death and brought you and gathered you together the invites men if you realize all this is going on oh father let the same spirit that was in your son be in me let me

doing this bow hits this morning maybe within yourself you would speak to the inner man that lies within your heart say Lord if I really taken the Rapture and the events that are transpiring in the world and the Fast Flashing red lights of the sign of his coming have I really taken seriously the shout and the voice and the Gathering of the Bride to that wedding supper have I really taken
