[44:53] &gt;&gt; Lord. We exalt you above every name.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Father, above
[45:02] all things, Lord, we place you first in
[45:05] our lives. And Father, we ask your
[45:08] forgiveness when we fail to do that. And
[45:12] we fail to remember that all this earth
[45:16] and everything creation is all spoke to
[45:20] your glory.
[45:22] Father, we just know the enemy tried to
[45:25] switch that glory to him and create an
[45:29] Eden that man loves, Father. But we know
[45:33] there's an original Eden that we're
[45:35] going to return back to. Father, we just
[45:38] hope that sinks so deep in our hearts
[45:41] and our mind,
[45:43] Lord, that you're coming soon for your
[45:45] church. We ask you to be with us and
[45:48] help us this morning. In Jesus precious
[45:51] name we pray.
[45:53] Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you have
[45:56] your Bibles, let's turn to Matthew,
[45:58] the uh
[46:01] fourth chapter of Matthew.
[46:05] And uh
[46:08] and we'll we'll read.
[46:11] Did I I I think I left my glasses,
[46:14] Billy, in the or Gary in the office
[46:16] there.
[46:18] I'm not going to get too far without
[46:21] them. Um I think I in the last few weeks
[46:24] I I kept saying that the uh the family
[46:28] picnic was on the 19th, but it's the
[46:32] 18th. So, uh that's the Saturday. So,
[46:37] uh, we surely encourage you to come out
[46:40] to that. See if I if he's getting them.
[46:43] They're somewhere in there. My office is
[46:46] a mess. I'm re remodeling it. So, well,
[46:51] who's got a pair of glasses?
[46:59] Phillip, you need hands laid on you.
[47:07] So the well
[47:23] make sure Jeff gets back to his seat.
[47:26] All right. Let's read here this morning.
[47:28] So this is a great a great scripture and
[47:32] blessing for us because
[47:36] I think we all go through trials and
[47:38] temptations
[47:40] and then to actually know that the Lord
[47:42] himself went through trials and
[47:44] temptation. It's a blessing to us. It
[47:47] says then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[47:52] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[47:56] devil.
[47:57] Jesus was led by the spirit
[48:01] &gt;&gt; into the wilderness to be tempted by the
[48:05] devil.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; You know, we sometimes we just think the
[48:08] spirit's all peace and joy and fluffy
[48:12] and no troubles. No, I'll tell you,
[48:17] he's tempted. It's it's how we handle
[48:19] the temptation.
[48:21] And this is what you want to see. We
[48:23] won't go into all the the the
[48:27] meat that is in this, but watch how he
[48:30] handled the temptation.
[48:33] It says, "And when he had fasted 40 days
[48:38] and 40 nights, he was afterward and
[48:42] hungered.
[48:44] And when the tempter came to him, he
[48:48] said, "If thou be the son of God,
[48:52] command these stones to be made bread."
[48:57] You know, first of all, if thou be the
[49:00] son of God, you don't have to prove to
[49:03] nobody who you are.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; You are who you are because God made you
[49:07] who you are.
[49:09] And you'll never prove to an unbeliever
[49:12] that you're a Christian.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz he don't believe you.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; No matter what you do,
[49:19] &gt;&gt; he don't believe there's such a thing.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; He doesn't believe there's a bride. He
[49:24] doesn't believe there's a people that
[49:26] are forgiven of their sins. So he he
[49:29] tempted him. And so Jesus never
[49:32] explained to to him, tried to prove to
[49:34] him he was the son of God. He answered
[49:37] and said, "It is written, man shall not
[49:41] live by bread alone, but by every word
[49:46] that proceedth out of the mouth of God."
[49:51] Then the devil taketh him up into the
[49:53] holy city, and set him on the pinnacle
[49:57] of the temple, and said unto him, If
[50:02] thou be the son of God, cast thyself
[50:06] down, for it is written, he shall give
[50:10] his angels charge concerning thee, and
[50:14] in their hands they shall bear thee up,
[50:17] least any time thou shall dash thy foot
[50:22] against the stone.
[50:25] Now, this is Satan quoting scripture.
[50:29] Amen.
[50:31] And Jesus said unto him, it is written
[50:35] again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[50:40] God. And again the devil taketh him up
[50:43] into an exceedingly high mountain and
[50:47] showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[50:50] world and the glory of them. And said
[50:54] unto him, All these things will I give
[50:59] thee if thou will fall down and worship
[51:03] me. And G
[51:06] then Jesus said unto him, "Get thee
[51:09] hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou
[51:13] shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
[51:16] only shalt thou serve." And the devil
[51:21] leaveth him, and behold, angels came and
[51:24] ministered unto him. Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:37] God these give those to Jeff. Amen. God
[51:40] bless you. May be seated this morning.
[51:48] If I I had a little thought
[51:51] um this morning, I would call it your
[51:56] relationship with the word.
[52:00] your relationship
[52:02] with
[52:04] the word
[52:06] and
[52:08] you know a relationship is
[52:11] not a knowledge you know I know a lot of
[52:14] people I have business associates and I
[52:18] have uh friends and I have different uh
[52:25] people that uh you make contact with But
[52:30] you wouldn't say that you have a
[52:31] relationship with those people.
[52:35] You you understand? Because a
[52:37] relationship is something that's
[52:39] interactive.
[52:41] It it it it's not just a one-sided
[52:45] uh affair. You know what I mean? In
[52:48] other words, it relates. It you relate
[52:52] to a person. And you you you communicate
[52:56] and and and they give you and you give
[52:59] them and it's a kind of an interaction
[53:03] something that you understand something
[53:05] that uh you identify with and you
[53:09] connect with and and you so you say well
[53:12] I have a relationship with this person.
[53:14] In other words we connect.
[53:17] You know what I mean? Uh uh we not only
[53:20] connect but we communicate. we we have
[53:24] fellowship. We uh we we we we can share
[53:28] and and I receive from that person.
[53:32] That's why you would say that, you know,
[53:35] I have a relationship uh with Sister
[53:38] Lesie, you know, because uh you you
[53:42] know, she provides for me and and and
[53:46] for her and uh you know, if I start to
[53:50] get a little uh radical in in one area,
[53:54] which I'm prone to do, uh she kind of
[53:57] throws on the brakes, you know, and
[53:59] says, "No, it's not that bad if you know
[54:01] if that's the worst thing that ever
[54:03] happened to you in life. You know,
[54:04] you're doing pretty good. And yeah,
[54:08] you know, she kind of brings me back
[54:10] into balance a little bit because I'm
[54:13] prone to be overbalanced.
[54:16] You know what I mean? Uh I would say
[54:18] that,
[54:20] you know, you you sometimes you have
[54:23] tend to tendencies to be a little
[54:25] fanatical and you need somebody that
[54:27] just holds you back. You know what I
[54:29] mean? and says, "Come on, it's not," you
[54:31] know, or you know, um, uh, you know,
[54:34] she'll always point out to me if I get
[54:36] mad at somebody that has done something,
[54:40] uh, get pulled in front of me, you know,
[54:42] she'll just say, "I bet you did that a
[54:44] bunch of times,
[54:47] you know, and uh, you know, you just
[54:50] kind of have to grin and bear, you know
[54:52] what I mean?" But you have a
[54:54] relationship
[54:56] and it's important to have a
[55:00] relationship with the word. So when we
[55:05] uh we were studying and reading out of
[55:09] the message harvest time
[55:12] and when I sat back and I tried to take
[55:14] a look at the whole message
[55:18] as a whole I thought what is it really
[55:21] what brother Random's trying to say
[55:25] you know and sometimes if you're have a
[55:28] tendency to be critical or you have a
[55:32] tendency to be negative.
[55:34] Uh, and the message attracted a lot of
[55:38] people who were critical and and
[55:41] negative because it called out a lot of
[55:45] things. And and sometimes if we're not
[55:48] careful, we're attracted to the
[55:50] negative. You know, people uh are
[55:53] attracted to things that strike out and
[55:57] things that fight and and things that
[56:00] put down, you know, and call stuff out
[56:03] and and and so, you know, like even in
[56:07] politics, you know, the whoever can
[56:11] sling the most mud on the other person,
[56:14] you know, this guy's good, he's for
[56:16] this, he's terrible, he's terrible. and
[56:18] and you people are attracted to
[56:21] negativity
[56:23] and and uh
[56:27] that's something that we never want to
[56:30] get involved in is having our
[56:33] relationship based on negativity.
[56:36] A a good relationship isn't one that's
[56:39] based because we both hate the same
[56:42] person,
[56:44] you know, or we both hate the same
[56:47] thing, you know, and it's all based on
[56:50] dislike and and you know, and people
[56:54] just join together and they connect
[56:58] together on negativity.
[57:01] And you know opposing something is good
[57:05] but you can't let that be the whole
[57:07] existence of your life. And I thought
[57:10] well so you know it wasn't that the
[57:12] prophet of God was speaking a against so
[57:16] much denominations.
[57:18] It wasn't that he was speaking so much a
[57:22] against the the things that were uh
[57:26] weren't correct in in uh Pentecost and
[57:30] different places. But really what it
[57:32] came down to, what he was speaking the
[57:34] most of, it was speaking the most of the
[57:37] importance of the word of God was the
[57:41] relationship with the word that that
[57:45] people were drawn off to emotions and
[57:48] feelings. They were drawn off to uh uh
[57:53] certain like gifts and things. And he's
[57:56] talking to the Pentecostal church at
[57:58] this time. And he said they were drawn
[58:00] off to these things, but they they left
[58:03] the word.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; So, and and so that's what he wanted to
[58:08] reestablish
[58:09] that it was the word. And I thought,
[58:12] well, why why is this message called
[58:16] harvest time,
[58:18] you know, uh becau, you know, and you
[58:21] know what a harvest is? A harvest is
[58:24] when it's time when the it has become
[58:28] ripe
[58:30] &gt;&gt; and and it's come to a maturity
[58:33] that it's got to be plucked.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; And so he's preaching to a a
[58:38] denominational world who the people have
[58:43] creeds and dogmas. They have certain
[58:47] methods of worship,
[58:49] certain forms of doing things. They've
[58:52] assembled themselves in all kinds of
[58:55] different groups based on all kinds of
[58:58] different doctrines and teachings and
[59:00] ideas. And the the church world laid out
[59:04] separated
[59:06] amongst themselves
[59:08] and and Christianity
[59:11] begin to build themselves and and form
[59:15] themselves on the ideas of man instead
[59:19] of the word of God.
[59:22] Now they use the word of God as we saw
[59:25] Satan use the word of God on Jesus. He
[59:29] says it's written,
[59:32] &gt;&gt; you know, if you do this,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; you know, cast yourself off of here and
[59:39] the angels will come bear you up. At
[59:42] least you dash
[59:44] uh a uh your heel, you know, against a
[59:50] stone, you know, and and he he trying to
[59:53] work on him and trying to force him and
[59:56] and trying to push him in something. But
[59:59] Jesus knew for what cause that he had
[1:00:02] come into the world.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; You understand? He had a revelation of
[1:00:06] who he was. That he was the lamb of God.
[1:00:10] He went and sat with the priest. He went
[1:00:13] and went through the things he had
[1:00:15] studied in the synagogue. So he knew who
[1:00:18] that he knew who that he was.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; You understand? He didn't have to prove
[1:00:25] to Satan who that he was.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; That wasn't what he didn't he didn't
[1:00:30] have to prove that he was a believer. He
[1:00:33] didn't have to prove anything. He just
[1:00:36] said to him, he says, "It's written,
[1:00:37] don't tempt me.
[1:00:39] Don't tempt the Lord thy God.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; There's I'm the lamb of God that's come
[1:00:44] into the world. I'm the sacrifice of the
[1:00:47] sin for my kinsmen.
[1:00:50] It is written of me that the cross lies
[1:00:54] before me. It is written that I'll lay
[1:00:57] down my life for my sheep and that I'll
[1:01:01] take it up again. It is written that I'm
[1:01:04] going to go prepare a place for them
[1:01:06] that where I am they may be also. So he
[1:01:10] understood who that he was. He
[1:01:13] understood what that his calling was. He
[1:01:17] understood what that his purpose was in
[1:01:20] life. And when something came to draw
[1:01:23] him away from that purpose,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; it didn't matter if he tried to use the
[1:01:29] scriptures to draw him away. He was
[1:01:32] misplacing the word of God and he said
[1:01:36] he said don't don't tempt me with that.
[1:01:39] It is written thou shalt not tempt the
[1:01:42] Lord thy God. In other words he was
[1:01:44] saying I am act I am fulfilling
[1:01:48] the word of God. This is God's plan.
[1:01:52] This wasn't God's plan for me to fall
[1:01:54] off a pinnacle. It it it wasn't his plan
[1:01:58] that I create bread to eat. It wasn't
[1:02:01] his plan to do that. So, Satan always
[1:02:05] was offering him something other than
[1:02:09] the word.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; It's what he always does. He always
[1:02:14] offers something other than the word.
[1:02:17] And so the we understood that the that
[1:02:21] in this last day and I think we can
[1:02:24] relate assuredly and a positively this
[1:02:28] morning that the scripture says as it
[1:02:30] was in the days of Noah so shall it be
[1:02:34] in the coming of the son of man. I think
[1:02:37] we can say uh beyond of a shout of as it
[1:02:40] was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:02:44] so shall it be. So when the world got in
[1:02:47] a condition uh uh uh uh like like Noah's
[1:02:51] time and when the world got in a
[1:02:54] condition like the time of Sodom
[1:02:58] when when we could look out and see that
[1:03:02] the season
[1:03:05] you understand of of the world the
[1:03:09] season and the condition in the skies in
[1:03:13] the surroundings of us just like the
[1:03:16] seasons that you come and and you know,
[1:03:19] you plant in the spring and the summer
[1:03:21] and and in the autumn and the fall you
[1:03:24] harvest and in the winter you store up,
[1:03:28] you know, and and so you you you see the
[1:03:32] pattern in the natural and then we look
[1:03:35] back and we can see the pattern in the
[1:03:38] spiritual that when the world gets in
[1:03:41] this condition, it's the time that God
[1:03:45] is going to harvest out his elected.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; So, he's going to harvest them out.
[1:03:54] So, it's the harvest time is the time of
[1:03:58] the harvest. And so, as he sits there
[1:04:01] and he's preaching to a convention, he's
[1:04:05] preaching to people of all different
[1:04:07] faiths. They've assembled together uh in
[1:04:10] like a full gospel businessman setting.
[1:04:13] There's Baptists, Methodists,
[1:04:15] Presbyterians. There's people from all
[1:04:17] kinds of different persuasions,
[1:04:21] and they all have all kinds of different
[1:04:24] interpretations
[1:04:26] of the word of God. And they're all
[1:04:29] pursuing different avenues and different
[1:04:33] viewpoints. They all have they all have
[1:04:36] their emphasis
[1:04:38] on what their program is or or what
[1:04:42] their uh mission is and
[1:04:46] and and what they feel uh it takes to be
[1:04:49] saved and and they're they've moved off
[1:04:55] of the relationship
[1:04:58] with the word of God.
[1:05:02] They they've substituted
[1:05:05] their relationship
[1:05:07] with the word with works,
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; with worship,
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; with advancement.
[1:05:17] They're measuring. They begin to measure
[1:05:21] their success by how large their church
[1:05:25] had become. Uh how many members that
[1:05:28] they had,
[1:05:30] how that the talent had risen up in
[1:05:34] their church and and how what their
[1:05:37] production was. And and as we know
[1:05:40] today, so many of churches are not so
[1:05:45] much uh involved in the word of God as
[1:05:51] they are involved in worship
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; and and worship's good. We just sang
[1:05:58] worship the Lord.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know what I mean?
[1:06:02] But that's that's a result
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; of your relationship with the word of
[1:06:09] God.
[1:06:11] So, you know, to really understand
[1:06:13] sometimes to understand the depth of
[1:06:17] what it meant for God to send Malachi
[1:06:21] 4:5, the fulfillment of that scripture
[1:06:25] in our day, Luke 17:30,
[1:06:28] Revelations 10:7, the scriptures that
[1:06:32] God promised to fulfill in this day. We
[1:06:35] we never can forget to recognize the day
[1:06:40] that we're in.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. To be able to sit back and
[1:06:45] recognize the day. Now, in my day, when
[1:06:49] I grew up in high school, there we we
[1:06:53] never
[1:06:54] ever talked about anything that would
[1:06:58] have to do with gender identity.
[1:07:05] You know what I mean? Or
[1:07:10] uh inner
[1:07:13] uh
[1:07:15] whatever. Yeah. Same gender marriage.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; I mean those were not subjects that that
[1:07:23] would have to cross your path.
[1:07:26] You know what I mean?
[1:07:28] uh uh there was there was a even a moral
[1:07:32] standard that existed even in the
[1:07:36] American culture and in the United
[1:07:38] States and and and what there were there
[1:07:42] was a time that you couldn't say the
[1:07:45] even the smallest swear word
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; on television.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; The the word hell was only used in
[1:07:54] church.
[1:07:58] You know what I mean? You would never
[1:07:59] hear that word. But something has
[1:08:03] decayed
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; our civilization.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; It it it's it's it be begin to unravel
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; and more and more things were being
[1:08:16] accepted. And as things of the world
[1:08:20] were being accepted, the word of God
[1:08:23] began to diminish.
[1:08:26] Because everything that's in the word is
[1:08:30] contrary to what's in the world. And
[1:08:33] everything that's in the world is
[1:08:35] contrary to what's in the word.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And God wanted to return his church back
[1:08:43] to the word of God.
[1:08:48] that could we we can't forget that this
[1:08:51] morning, church, that really what we're
[1:08:54] based upon is not the fulfillment of the
[1:08:58] promise itself, but the relationship of
[1:09:02] that promise in the word of God.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that
[1:09:10] that
[1:09:13] how can I say this? It wasn't the man
[1:09:16] that fulfilled the promise
[1:09:19] that the emphasis was placed on. It was
[1:09:23] the promise that was fulfilled
[1:09:26] that the re the emphasis is placed on.
[1:09:34] In other words, it was the word. God
[1:09:37] said that he would send
[1:09:40] in this last day
[1:09:44] a vindicated prophet
[1:09:47] to restore the hearts of the children
[1:09:50] back to the faith of their fathers.
[1:09:55] What would they going to restore him to?
[1:09:57] Back to the word of God. That's what he
[1:10:01] wanted. That's what his message was to
[1:10:04] the church. You we've got to come back
[1:10:07] to our relationship
[1:10:10] with the word of God.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; That is the most important thing for the
[1:10:17] believer is to be connected with the
[1:10:21] scriptures,
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; to be connected with the word of God, to
[1:10:26] have a relationship with the word of
[1:10:29] God. that every word of man be a lie and
[1:10:33] my word be true.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; He's bringing he he he it wasn't that
[1:10:40] the people didn't love the Lord.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that the people weren't
[1:10:47] worshiping the Lord. They weren't
[1:10:50] praising the Lord. He wasn't he wasn't
[1:10:53] preaching against the gifts moving in
[1:10:56] their midst. But what he wanted to start
[1:10:59] to point out is that some of these gifts
[1:11:02] are are operating but it's not according
[1:11:05] to the word
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; and the the establishment that he really
[1:11:13] wanted to establish back what he was
[1:11:15] trying to harvest.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; You understand? out of the church world,
[1:11:24] out of all these different ideas. He was
[1:11:28] trying to harvest the elected seed that
[1:11:32] God had put there for that age because
[1:11:36] it was time for that seed to come to
[1:11:40] maturity and be harvested.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; So it didn't matter
[1:11:48] where you found yourself in life.
[1:11:51] It didn't matter what your past was.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter what your association
[1:11:56] was. It didn't matter what your
[1:11:58] affiliation is or what your failures
[1:12:01] were. Many of you know my testimony. You
[1:12:03] know, I was a hippie. You knew I grew up
[1:12:05] in California.
[1:12:07] You know, I ran around with motorcycle
[1:12:10] guys and rock musicians and all that.
[1:12:13] But none of that was laid to my charge.
[1:12:16] That's right.
[1:12:18] Because by the word of God,
[1:12:21] my eyes were open to the truth.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; They were open to the word,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; to the fulfilled promise of our age.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Wasn't by anything that I done. It was
[1:12:37] by the grace of God. It was by the Isab
[1:12:41] that he provided this age. And he
[1:12:44] provided his blood to cover my sins. and
[1:12:47] a white garment that I could my go my my
[1:12:50] garments could be white as snow that I
[1:12:52] could become different and I could
[1:12:54] become changed.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't changed just for the sake
[1:13:00] of change. It was changed for a purpose.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; It it was a call
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; in our lives back to the word of God,
[1:13:10] back to the fellowship and the
[1:13:13] relationship with God's word.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] You got to REMEMBER THAT'S THE BATTLES
[1:13:21] in your mind.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; All kinds of thoughts come in. All kinds
[1:13:27] of temptations come in. All kinds of
[1:13:30] ideas come in. All kinds of plans for
[1:13:33] your future come in. You're continually
[1:13:36] battling. What a day we live in. There's
[1:13:39] so much information out there
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; and 99 and n10 of it's a lie.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; It It only feeds one side of the
[1:13:55] picture.
[1:13:59] have to and God wants to harvest
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; of people
[1:14:06] that are going to return back to the
[1:14:10] relationship of the word.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; It wasn't taking the word of God and
[1:14:18] bringing it in to what already existed.
[1:14:25] That's not what it was going to do. it.
[1:14:28] He wanted us to understand that when it
[1:14:31] the time of this age came
[1:14:35] and when the church made its journey
[1:14:38] from Pentecost into the ground and then
[1:14:41] back up again, the very first word began
[1:14:45] to speak out through Luther when he
[1:14:48] said, "The just shall live by faith."
[1:14:52] And he began to preach and and he began
[1:14:55] to say, 'N no, you don't have to give
[1:14:58] dollars to have your sins forgiven. You
[1:15:01] don't have to light candles to have your
[1:15:03] sins forgiven. You don't have to say
[1:15:06] rosaries to have your sins forgiven. He
[1:15:08] said your sins were forgiven on Calvary
[1:15:12] by the blood of Jesus Christ. And if one
[1:15:15] sinned, then one died for all sin.
[1:15:21] JUSTIFICATION. WHAT A MESSAGE in its
[1:15:24] day.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:15:30] People were going into a little box,
[1:15:34] confessing their sins to the priest,
[1:15:37] going out and lighting candles, and
[1:15:39] never could be free from sin.
[1:15:43] Why? Because they never applied the
[1:15:45] blood.
[1:15:47] But once the blood was applied,
[1:15:51] they understood what sin was.
[1:15:55] And when they failed, they understood
[1:15:58] that they could run right back and say,
[1:16:00] "Aba, Father, forgive me."
[1:16:04] And if they were righteous and faithful
[1:16:06] and just to confess their sins, God was
[1:16:09] faithful and just to forgive them.
[1:16:16] And then Wesley came along
[1:16:19] and said that's that is true.
[1:16:23] But not only do we have to accept the
[1:16:27] forgiveness of our sins, we have to
[1:16:29] start living a life that of
[1:16:31] sanctification.
[1:16:35] We can't keep doing the things
[1:16:39] that bring us back into sinful
[1:16:42] condition.
[1:16:45] We've got to separate from those things.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; You know, you can't be free from rock
[1:16:53] and roll and keep listening to rock and
[1:16:55] roll.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, it it don't work. I mean it, you
[1:17:05] know, it I mean I I hate it when I I I
[1:17:10] go into a restaurant and they'll have
[1:17:11] some music playing and I'll get in my
[1:17:14] truck and that crazy songs playing in my
[1:17:17] head.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; You know, I ask, "How did you get in
[1:17:24] there?"
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; And how do I get you out?
[1:17:32] Well, my secret is I just take a good
[1:17:35] old Christian song that I like and I
[1:17:38] replace it.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; I'll just keep singing that Christian
[1:17:43] song.
[1:17:45] You know, I know it was the blood. I
[1:17:48] know it was the blood. I know it was the
[1:17:51] blood for me. One day I was lost and I
[1:17:56] died upon the cross. And I'm just in my
[1:17:58] truck just uh singing it because I'm
[1:18:01] getting that dude out of there.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear no hum diddy do's
[1:18:08] going on in my brain.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; So how he brought us to sanctification,
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; you know, let's let's apply
[1:18:22] sanctification.
[1:18:24] Let's apply the token. You got to
[1:18:27] continually do it because he's
[1:18:29] continually getting in.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; I got a pest control guy.
[1:18:37] He comes and sprays the house, you know
[1:18:39] what I mean? And does all this stuff and
[1:18:43] sure enough, one of them little things
[1:18:45] will show up,
[1:18:48] you know,
[1:18:50] and what do I do? Do I say, "Oh, I've
[1:18:54] treated this house." No. What do you got
[1:18:57] to do? You got to treat it again.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; You got to keep them out.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; You got to keep throwing them out. You
[1:19:06] got to keep cleaning. You don't wash the
[1:19:08] kitchen once, right?
[1:19:11] Or maybe some of you do. You know, maybe
[1:19:14] you got a lot of bugs. I don't know.
[1:19:16] Maybe bugs don't bother me. How many
[1:19:17] sisters love cockroaches?
[1:19:22] Oh,
[1:19:24] you don't keep them in a jar and let
[1:19:26] them live in your cupboards and you
[1:19:29] know, you know what they say? They say
[1:19:34] they don't hurt nobody.
[1:19:36] They always run away from people.
[1:19:40] They only come out at night where they
[1:19:43] don't bother you.
[1:19:45] They're really not so bad,
[1:19:48] but they give you the creepy jebies
[1:19:52] because there's something about them
[1:19:54] that's not clean.
[1:19:59] Well, how about that
[1:20:01] on the spiritual side?
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; All these things are the world's keeps
[1:20:06] trying to put cockroaches in your ex
[1:20:10] experience.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; La cukarachas.
[1:20:17] Right. That's what he's trying to do.
[1:20:20] He's He's trying to get you off path,
[1:20:23] get you distracted,
[1:20:25] you know, get you he just keep he keeps
[1:20:27] coming. Wesley came with sanctification
[1:20:30] and they realize we've we've got to
[1:20:32] start separating from ourselves from the
[1:20:35] things that are damaging our spirit.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:40] Really, what he's talking about is a
[1:20:43] relationship with the word of God.
[1:20:47] We've got to have a relationship
[1:20:50] with the word of God. And then men sat
[1:20:55] at sought after gifts. They read in the
[1:20:58] Bible. They saw where they spoke in
[1:20:59] tongues. They saw where they laid hands
[1:21:02] on the sick. They they saw these great
[1:21:04] things. And and and so they they went
[1:21:07] after those things. They prayed for
[1:21:10] those things.
[1:21:12] And then we know this, the spirit fell
[1:21:15] in in the form of a restoration that
[1:21:18] that people began to speak in tongues
[1:21:21] and and they begin to prophesy and and
[1:21:25] they begin to worship and they they knew
[1:21:29] what it was to be filled and touched
[1:21:31] with the spirit. Not just
[1:21:33] intellectually, but they actually felt
[1:21:36] the presence of God in their lives.
[1:21:42] They knew they were different.
[1:21:45] They they they were filled. The spirit
[1:21:48] was in them. They they they were in a
[1:21:51] cold, dry, formal way of living. They
[1:21:55] just they read their sang their songs
[1:21:57] out of their book. They they read their
[1:22:00] Sunday scriptures. Uh they they live
[1:22:03] moral lives. They went to church on
[1:22:05] Sunday, but that was all the more that
[1:22:08] they looked for.
[1:22:12] That's all that they were hungry for
[1:22:15] because they were told that that's all
[1:22:17] there was.
[1:22:21] And then some people begin to realize
[1:22:23] there's more
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; than
[1:22:29] just
[1:22:31] believing and living right.
[1:22:34] People wanted to do something for God.
[1:22:38] They wanted to feel led of the spirit.
[1:22:42] They wanted to feel the freedom. They
[1:22:44] wanted to feel a personal relationship
[1:22:47] with the Lord. They wanted to know what
[1:22:49] it was like to have the uncction of the
[1:22:52] Holy Spirit to to to
[1:22:55] speak to their hearts and say do this
[1:22:59] and and and and and
[1:23:02] have a burden.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Come on their heart for somebody.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Bake such and such a cake. Bake such and
[1:23:10] such. Pray for such and such. Go visit
[1:23:13] such and such. that uncction of the
[1:23:15] spirit was moving in their lives and and
[1:23:19] they they they felt the leadership and
[1:23:22] the presence of God and they worshiped
[1:23:25] him
[1:23:28] and and that was a desire of their
[1:23:30] heart.
[1:23:32] But the desire of their heart
[1:23:37] began to lead them away from the word of
[1:23:41] God.
[1:23:44] Do you understand that
[1:23:49] they were now feeling an uncction to do
[1:23:53] things
[1:23:55] that were contrary
[1:23:57] to the word
[1:24:01] and we begin to understand that the rain
[1:24:04] falls on the just and the unjust.
[1:24:10] their relationship with God's word
[1:24:15] began to diminish
[1:24:19] and it was based more on what they felt
[1:24:25] than what they received.
[1:24:29] They begin to turn from the word of God
[1:24:32] for leadership
[1:24:34] and they begin to turn to their feeling.
[1:24:38] And our messenger came out and he said,
[1:24:40] "He never asked you if you felt it.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; He asked you if you believed it."
[1:24:51] The anointing became
[1:24:56] a major emphasis.
[1:25:00] I feel anointed.
[1:25:03] I feel the presence of God on me.
[1:25:08] It's like when the high priest,
[1:25:11] he slapped Paul and the guy come out and
[1:25:14] said, "How dare you revile the high
[1:25:18] priest?" You know where did the spirit
[1:25:20] go when it left me? And Paul said, "Oh,
[1:25:25] forgive me.
[1:25:26] I didn't know he was the high priest. I
[1:25:29] would have never reviled the high
[1:25:31] priest." Paul just covered himself with
[1:25:33] the word of God.
[1:25:37] It was the word.
[1:25:40] That's what the important
[1:25:44] part for the believer and especially the
[1:25:48] believer in our day is to get back with
[1:25:53] the word of God.
[1:25:56] The relationship
[1:25:58] with the word of God.
[1:26:01] And so, Brother Bman, of this message,
[1:26:03] he he makes it a a a clear distinction.
[1:26:07] He said Jesus says man shall not live by
[1:26:10] bread alone.
[1:26:12] So he he was simply pointing out there
[1:26:15] was two types of bread.
[1:26:18] There's the bread that feeds us. Big
[1:26:21] category. I just don't mean wonderb
[1:26:24] bread.
[1:26:26] It's a wonder you can live by that
[1:26:27] stuff.
[1:26:30] But it was all the natural
[1:26:33] things of life that we live by.
[1:26:37] He said, "Man can't live on that alone."
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; And you can't
[1:26:47] because if all you do is eat natural,
[1:26:50] whether you eat every health bar, there
[1:26:53] is, every drink,
[1:26:58] I've seen so many advertisements now.
[1:27:00] There's things I can wash my hair with,
[1:27:03] I can eat, and all my hair is going to
[1:27:06] grow back.
[1:27:08] I got another bread that's going to grow
[1:27:11] my hair, Brad.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; So, he pointed out there's two kinds of
[1:27:18] bread. There's the natural bread that we
[1:27:22] live by.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; The we we work, we eat, we do. But no
[1:27:28] matter how well you eat, no matter how
[1:27:32] many hours you spend at the gym, there's
[1:27:35] one certain thing, this body is going to
[1:27:40] run out.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care. You can go all back
[1:27:49] through history.
[1:27:51] You could tell me who crossed the
[1:27:53] Delaware. You can tell me who never told
[1:27:55] a lie. You can tell me all these great
[1:27:59] men and and you know who are the rough
[1:28:02] rider and you know who done this and who
[1:28:05] done that. And every single one of them
[1:28:07] has a monument.
[1:28:10] They have something on this earth
[1:28:15] that reminds you that they were there
[1:28:19] lest they be forgotten.
[1:28:23] There's a rock fella center there.
[1:28:26] There's this guy's name on this law
[1:28:29] school and that law school and that
[1:28:31] place. Everybody is trying to uh put
[1:28:35] their emphasis on on this life.
[1:28:39] in this short period of time that
[1:28:42] they're they'll be immortalized. They
[1:28:45] they what's their legacy? What are they
[1:28:47] going to say about me when I'm gone?
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And and they put all their
[1:28:55] effort into the natural bread.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; George Washington wants you to learn
[1:29:04] about him in school.
[1:29:08] Davy Crockett wants you to and Stephen
[1:29:10] F. Austin and and Buoie and the Alamo.
[1:29:17] While you go to school in Texas, you got
[1:29:19] to take Texas history.
[1:29:22] You got to know about Santa Ana. You got
[1:29:24] to know about San Cedro. You got to know
[1:29:26] about this. You got to know about that.
[1:29:28] You got to know about Longhorns.
[1:29:30] Yippi cay.
[1:29:35] Why man is trying to hang on to this
[1:29:40] life
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; and then there's another bread,
[1:29:52] the bread which cometh down from heaven.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. I am the bread
[1:29:56] that cometh down from heaven.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Any man that eats me shall live.
[1:30:05] Bread is meant to be eaten.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; The word of God is meant to be eaten.
[1:30:15] That's what he was trying to do for the
[1:30:17] church. He was trying to get them back
[1:30:21] to the word, back to the Bible,
[1:30:27] back to the scriptures.
[1:30:32] This is where he wanted us to get back
[1:30:34] to,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; back to the word,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; back to a relationship
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; with the word of God.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Where this becomes
[1:30:46] your leader.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; This becomes your guide. This becomes
[1:30:52] your absolute. What he said is how that
[1:30:56] it is,
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; not how IT APPEARS.
[1:31:01] BECAUSE HE WANTS to have a relationship
[1:31:05] with the word of God,
[1:31:09] the bread of life,
[1:31:13] not the bread of the world, but the
[1:31:15] bread of life.
[1:31:18] He wants to have a relationship
[1:31:20] with the word.
[1:31:23] And what is the word? is the the word is
[1:31:26] God's thoughts
[1:31:29] expressed.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Another it's what he said.
[1:31:39] If I could say it this way, it's what he
[1:31:41] thinks.
[1:31:43] It's what he will do.
[1:31:46] It's his description
[1:31:50] of a world
[1:31:52] different than the world you're in.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; You're living by You're living by
[1:32:03] something different than what the flesh
[1:32:07] is living by.
[1:32:10] You're not living by your job.
[1:32:17] I've had several.
[1:32:20] You don't live by that job.
[1:32:23] What happens when you lose a job?
[1:32:26] You call Indeed.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; You find a head hunter.
[1:32:34] You read the newspaper.
[1:32:36] You look for another job.
[1:32:39] You don't live by that.
[1:32:42] God don't want us to live by that.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; He wants us to live by his word.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; The word of God is meant to be eaten.
[1:32:57] He's He's calling us back to a
[1:33:00] relationship with his word. So the word
[1:33:04] of God is his thoughts expressed.
[1:33:06] His spirit is in his word. Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Now, you can get an anointing outside
[1:33:16] the word.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; You can get a feeling outside the word,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; but the word of God is ever true.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; The word of God is God's vision for you.
[1:33:37] He gave you the word
[1:33:40] so you could be a partaker of that word
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; and you could be a reflection of him
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; in this earth
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; his spirit in his word.
[1:33:59] So when you take the word of God
[1:34:03] and you live that word,
[1:34:07] you take a promise of God. He said in
[1:34:09] Peter that he has given us these great,
[1:34:13] it's Peter 2 Peter 1:4. He's given us
[1:34:17] these great and exceeding precious
[1:34:19] promises that by these promises we might
[1:34:23] be partakers
[1:34:25] of divine nature
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; and escape the lust of the flesh.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Or the bread of life, of natural life.
[1:34:37] and that we might through these promises
[1:34:41] believe God's word,
[1:34:46] live God's word, OBEY God's word, take
[1:34:50] what God said about it, and follow in
[1:34:54] that path. And when you take that word,
[1:34:58] the spirit of that word,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; the obedience to that word produces the
[1:35:05] spirit of that word in your life.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; So you're not LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
[1:35:14] OUTSIDE his word. You're looking for
[1:35:16] something that's in his word.
[1:35:23] Now you want to rejoice.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; The word of God says if we'll confess
[1:35:32] our sins,
[1:35:34] he's faithful and just to forgive them.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Now, if you have the seed of God in you
[1:35:40] and you sin,
[1:35:42] it's a terrible burden.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; It's a ugly feeling.
[1:35:50] You get sick.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; You shake your head. How could I do
[1:35:54] that? How could I fail? How could I have
[1:35:57] done that? Oh,
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; and you can undo it.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; You can't undo it.
[1:36:08] You can go back.
[1:36:10] You can try to cover it up,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; but you can't undo it.
[1:36:17] and he knows you did it
[1:36:22] and the spirit's convicting you of it
[1:36:25] and you feel the burden and the weight
[1:36:27] of that sin. But he said,
[1:36:32] his word said
[1:36:35] if you'll confess that sin
[1:36:39] that he would be faithful and just to
[1:36:43] forgive it.
[1:36:47] And if you've ever sinned and you've
[1:36:50] went
[1:36:51] and you've confessed it sincerely with
[1:36:54] your heart
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; now you've entered into that word.
[1:37:02] You've taken that word
[1:37:04] that now becomes what you're feeding on.
[1:37:08] You say you said if I confess this sin
[1:37:11] you'd be faithful and just to forgive
[1:37:14] it. I'm sorry.
[1:37:16] I didn't mean to do it.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; IT WAS MY FAULT.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; I can't go say, "Oh, Lord, I didn't mean
[1:37:25] to do it. IT'S GREG'S FAULT. IT'S ALL
[1:37:27] YOUR FAULT.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; REPENT.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; I'm guilty."
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; But he said
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; he'd forgive you.
[1:37:46] and throw it in the sea of God's
[1:37:49] forgetfulness to be remembered no more.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And you go there,
[1:37:57] you accept that word.
[1:38:01] Now, your relationship is built on the
[1:38:03] word,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; not built on what anybody else said.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; It's built on what he said. He said
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; he said
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; he didn't say I had to give a history of
[1:38:22] it. He didn't say I had to write it
[1:38:24] down. He already knows. Lord, you know
[1:38:29] what I'm here, what I've done, and what
[1:38:32] I'm confessing.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; I'm taking you at your word.
[1:38:42] Now your relationship is with the word
[1:38:45] and so you say I'm sorry. And then when
[1:38:48] he fulfills
[1:38:52] the promise of that word
[1:38:56] which is
[1:38:58] I'll be faithful and just to forgive it.
[1:39:02] And when he forgives it,
[1:39:04] takes that burden off of you, throws it
[1:39:08] in the sea of his forgetfulness to be
[1:39:10] remembered no more against you,
[1:39:13] and you experience that. YOU TALK ABOUT
[1:39:17] THE JOY BELLS RINGING.
[1:39:21] AMEN.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You know, to see
[1:39:25] the word of God, what you asked,
[1:39:28] what he promised come to pass
[1:39:33] to, you know, to see his hand on your
[1:39:37] life.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; It'll cause you to praise him.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; It'll cause you to rejoice.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Thank him.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; A amen. the spring
[1:39:52] of the well within you begins to bubble
[1:39:55] up again.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; You're back in love.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is with every promise
[1:40:05] of God's word.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; It's by the promises of his word that
[1:40:12] you become a partaker of divine nature.
[1:40:18] They began to want to partake of the
[1:40:20] spirit
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; and in doing so they walked away from
[1:40:29] the word
[1:40:32] and all his whole heart's desire was
[1:40:36] don't get away from the word.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; It's fine the spirit moves in you but
[1:40:42] let it be done according to the word of
[1:40:44] God.
[1:40:49] That's, you know, and I I YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:40:53] read your Bible.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; You've got to go through it page after
[1:41:00] page and line after line and verse after
[1:41:04] verse. You've got to see Jesus in every
[1:41:07] verse of the Bible.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; It's the bread
[1:41:13] by which you live on.
[1:41:19] You don't live on the rain.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; The rain washes you.
[1:41:27] The rain refreshes you. But you live by
[1:41:31] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:41:34] mouth of God.
[1:41:38] You've got to become so singleminded
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; where that you live by the scriptures.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; You become a scriptural word
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; church.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he's looking for. THAT'S
[1:42:00] WHAT HE'S TRYING TO HARVEST.
[1:42:02] That's what he was trying to bring out.
[1:42:04] He says, "I know there's a people here
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; because God planted them.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; It's in their heart
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; to return back
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; to the scripture,
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; to return back to the Bible."
[1:42:27] He knew if they returned back to the
[1:42:29] Bible that the Bible said Malachi would
[1:42:32] be here.
[1:42:35] He knew if they returned back to the
[1:42:37] Bible that they would see this as it was
[1:42:39] in the days of Sodom Gomorrah.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; They would see the ministry in the word.
[1:42:48] God is trying to get our relationship
[1:42:52] back to the word of God, back to where
[1:42:55] we live by the word.
[1:43:01] If the word says no, we say no.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; If the word gives you a promise, you
[1:43:08] believe it.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, you said by your stripes I am
[1:43:13] healed. I believe it.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not I don't have to produce nothing.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; You have your time.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; All things work together for a good
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; who love the Lord.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Everything is in its season. Everything
[1:43:30] has this perfect will. This is what the
[1:43:33] scriptur is telling you.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Back to living by this.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; You can't live by saying, "I believe God
[1:43:41] sent a prophet."
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; He did send a prophet.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire, which that's the
[1:43:50] picture we have, came in this
[1:43:52] generation.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; God revealed that to us.
[1:43:58] But when he revealed to us, he he took
[1:44:01] us on a walk down the road to Emmas.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; When I come to the Lord,
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; he took me for a walk
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; down the road to Emmas.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Isn't it written in Romans
[1:44:18] chapter 1?
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't it written in Romans 8?
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't it written in Corinthians? Isn't
[1:44:26] it written
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; that I'm faithful and just
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; that I'll not leave you nor forsake you.
[1:44:33] What did we do? I went down a road,
[1:44:35] walked down the road to Emmas with him
[1:44:37] where he spoke and he showed himself
[1:44:40] alive in the scriptures. HE SHOWED TO ME
[1:44:43] THAT these scriptures that are written
[1:44:45] here WERE NOW COMING TO PASS IN MY LIFE.
[1:44:49] IT WAS MY DAY OF FORGIVENESS. IT WAS MY
[1:44:52] DAY TO BE BAPTIZED with the HOLY GHOST.
[1:44:54] IT WAS MY DAY TO COME OUT AND BE
[1:44:56] SEPARATE.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; It was the word.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; He didn't do anything in my life outside
[1:45:08] of his word.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; I walked with him a while and then he
[1:45:14] come down. He said, "Let's go a little
[1:45:16] farther."
[1:45:18] I promised in Malachi
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; that I'd restore
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; the faith.
[1:45:26] I promised in Revelations 10:7 that I'd
[1:45:29] open the mysteries.
[1:45:33] I promised in Luke 17:30 that I'd make
[1:45:36] my presence known amongst the Gentiles
[1:45:40] when it got in a sodom condition.
[1:45:46] What was it?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; It was the word.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; I was walking in the word.
[1:45:54] He was showing me his word.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; And as he showed it, I could see it. As
[1:46:00] I saw it,
[1:46:03] it became life
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; and life more abundant.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; That's what he was looking to do.
[1:46:13] He wanted us to believe and live
[1:46:17] the scriptures.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; We look for power
[1:46:24] outside the word and the word is the
[1:46:28] power.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; If God could have given us any other
[1:46:34] weapon besides his word, he would have
[1:46:38] done it.
[1:46:39] And when Satan came to tempt him, what
[1:46:42] did he fight him with? The word.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; This is really what's trying to be
[1:46:52] restored. We're not trying to restore
[1:46:54] Pentecost. Pentecost was a result of
[1:46:57] what he said for them to do. go in the
[1:47:01] upper room
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and wait
[1:47:04] and I'll come again
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; and I'll be with you even in you and I
[1:47:10] will lead you and guide you into all
[1:47:13] truth. I'll send you the spirit of God
[1:47:15] and it will bring you into remembrance
[1:47:19] of all things I've taught.
[1:47:22] The the writer wrote, he said, 'The Holy
[1:47:24] Spirit didn't come to speak of itself,
[1:47:27] but to bring you into remembrance of all
[1:47:29] things THAT I TAUGHT. HE WANTED THE
[1:47:32] CHURCH BUILT ON THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:47:36] AMEN.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; The revealed
[1:47:40] word of God.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Your walk
[1:47:45] on the road to
[1:47:48] he'll walk down that road with any of
[1:47:50] you. No matter how old you are,
[1:47:55] you're down and out, he'll come by.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; You're a sinner, you're rejected, he'll
[1:48:01] come by. And all he could tell you is,
[1:48:06] "I know you sinned.
[1:48:09] But if you'll confess that sin, I'll
[1:48:12] forgive it.
[1:48:16] I know you're broken,
[1:48:18] but I heal the brokenhearted.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; I bind them up."
[1:48:26] I know you got angry.
[1:48:32] Just make it right. And you'll find out
[1:48:36] that it's by these promises that you're
[1:48:39] partakers
[1:48:41] of the word of God. The spirit of God
[1:48:46] moves in his word.
[1:48:51] The key to the spiritual life
[1:48:57] is through the word.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; You pray. You ask,
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; he answers.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; This becomes your northstar.
[1:49:10] This becomes your discernment. This
[1:49:13] becomes every aspect. This is what you
[1:49:15] feed on. This is what you live by. And
[1:49:18] if you live by that word, obedience to
[1:49:22] that word produces the presence of
[1:49:25] almighty God.
[1:49:30] I don't care who you are
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; or what you've done. You take God at his
[1:49:36] word. He'll no wise leave you nor
[1:49:40] forsake you.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; But he'll be with you even in you till
[1:49:45] the end.
[1:49:48] He wanted to build us
[1:49:51] in his word. I just want to read a few
[1:49:53] statements in closing
[1:49:57] this morning.
[1:49:59] See if I can find them
[1:50:02] here.
[1:50:09] Now you talk about a beautiful
[1:50:12] definition of a Christian.
[1:50:16] We as Christians are only reflecting
[1:50:20] him.
[1:50:23] Well, how are you going to reflect him?
[1:50:26] You can only reflect him through what he
[1:50:29] said
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; or what he thought.
[1:50:33] You can't express your own thought and
[1:50:35] be expressing his thought. If you
[1:50:38] express his thought, you're expressing
[1:50:40] what? The word.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; He said we as Christians are only
[1:50:46] reflecting him. The moon only reflects
[1:50:50] the sun in its absence. And the believer
[1:50:54] only reflects the son of God in the
[1:50:57] absence of the son of God. It's the
[1:51:01] light of the Bible.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; It's the light
[1:51:10] of the Bible.
[1:51:12] It's the life of the Bible. Do you
[1:51:16] understand? If
[1:51:19] we can't create a message life
[1:51:23] by our own interpretations of the
[1:51:25] message,
[1:51:26] by the parts of the message we want to
[1:51:29] emphasize.
[1:51:31] We can't create a message spirit apart
[1:51:35] from the Bible.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; They're one.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; It's the Bible life.
[1:51:49] Don't sit down on a few doctrines.
[1:51:53] Feast
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; read
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; every day.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; It'll speak to you.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; It'll lead you. It'll guide you.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Your decisions are scriptural. You're in
[1:52:06] love with the Bible. You're in love with
[1:52:07] the word of God. You You look to for it
[1:52:10] to guidance. You say, "Well, let me tell
[1:52:14] you, there's nothing
[1:52:17] in here that's not in here."
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; There was things that were in here we
[1:52:28] couldn't see.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; So, God sent a message
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; for Isab
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; that we could see.
[1:52:42] It never was a replacement program.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; It was a revelation
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; program.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; It was signs and wonders and miracles
[1:52:55] and seeing the presence of God in our
[1:52:58] midst to attract our attention
[1:53:02] to let us know that this God of this
[1:53:04] Bible is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:53:07] forever. and that we could live by this
[1:53:10] word. We could take every promise in
[1:53:13] this word. Every promise in the book is
[1:53:15] mine. We could believe it, read it,
[1:53:18] accept it. It didn't need to be
[1:53:19] interpreted.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; He was his own interpreter
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; by bringing it to pass.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; You didn't have to be smart.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; You didn't have to be intellectual. You
[1:53:34] didn't have to be educated and be a good
[1:53:36] speaker.
[1:53:38] YOU COULD SIMPLY TAKE him at his word
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; and he would perform that word and you
[1:53:46] would be in his spirit partaking of his
[1:53:49] spirit.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; You got a nasty old temper spirit on
[1:53:55] you.
[1:53:56] Oh God, help me.
[1:53:59] Forgive me. Make me new.
[1:54:03] Cast this off of me.
[1:54:06] put the love of God in my heart.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Watch him.
[1:54:14] Watch him do it.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Then you talk about rejoice.
[1:54:19] You talk about being thankful.
[1:54:22] You're not You're not producing wool.
[1:54:25] You're bearing it.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; You become that word alive.
[1:54:32] him in you, the hope of glory.
[1:54:39] He says it's the light of the Bible, the
[1:54:42] scriptures being vindicated in our
[1:54:45] lives. The word that makes light in
[1:54:50] darkness.
[1:54:53] The word that makes light in darkness.
[1:54:59] I know we got French Bibles, we've got
[1:55:02] Spanish Bibles, we got English Bibles. I
[1:55:05] guess they have Hindi Bibles. They have
[1:55:08] how many other dialects we have here?
[1:55:10] I'm sure there's lots of Bibles.
[1:55:17] Let's read it.
[1:55:20] He said, "You are candles that are set
[1:55:25] upon a hill." That's right. That ain't
[1:55:28] the sun. It's a candle. The candle just
[1:55:32] takes the place of the sun. Just shows a
[1:55:37] certain amount of light. We are God's
[1:55:41] children. We are sons and daughters of
[1:55:44] God.
[1:55:46] Only by the spirit with portion.
[1:55:50] He had it without portion. We are stars
[1:55:54] that shining. All of us together make
[1:55:57] the light to the world. But he is the
[1:56:01] eternal son that reflects the light to
[1:56:04] every star. Hallelujah. I believe him.
[1:56:08] God help my unbelief.
[1:56:12] That's just like the world is always
[1:56:14] trying to compare. Don't compare with
[1:56:17] things of the world. Don't compare with
[1:56:20] churches. Compare with the Bible.
[1:56:27] compare with the Bible.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; I looked at myself, I thought, you know
[1:56:33] something?
[1:56:36] How often do I compare myself with the
[1:56:38] Bible?
[1:56:43] I'm supposed to have a book of Acts
[1:56:46] following me.
[1:56:49] You know what I compare? I compare
[1:56:50] myself with what I believe.
[1:56:54] I believe this doctrine. I believe
[1:56:56] serpent seed. I believe this. I believe
[1:56:58] that.
[1:57:00] And I thought, well, I'm comparing
[1:57:02] myself with myself.
[1:57:06] When you compare yourself with yourself,
[1:57:08] you don't hate yourself. You'll come up
[1:57:11] with an angel every time.
[1:57:15] You'll put a star on your chart. But
[1:57:18] when you go back to the word of God,
[1:57:23] And it asked you, did you turn the other
[1:57:24] cheek?
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Did you go the extra mile? Did you visit
[1:57:28] the widow and the fatherless in their
[1:57:30] affliction?
[1:57:33] Are you a peacemaker?
[1:57:36] Oh,
[1:57:38] really?
[1:57:40] Maybe I'm not doing as all as well as I
[1:57:45] thought I'd do.
[1:57:48] It's like grading your own test.
[1:57:53] You put an answer down, you think it's
[1:57:55] right, so of course you're going to give
[1:57:57] yourself a hundred.
[1:58:01] And and we've we've graded ourselves,
[1:58:04] but we're not comparing ourselves.
[1:58:09] Every believer should be able to compare
[1:58:11] himself with every single person in the
[1:58:14] scriptures.
[1:58:18] You want we want the path forward,
[1:58:20] right? Where is God really wanting to
[1:58:23] take this church?
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just wanting to take us to
[1:58:27] say, I believe what you fulfilled.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; He wanted to see that what he fulfilled
[1:58:36] was to bring us back to his word. that
[1:58:39] that word would live in us
[1:58:43] and then we would become written
[1:58:47] epistles
[1:58:49] read of all men. He said compare with
[1:58:53] the Bible. That's what we're doing
[1:58:56] today. That's what's the matter with us
[1:58:59] Pentecostal church. That's what's the
[1:59:03] matter with our quartets and singers and
[1:59:09] so forth as we have. We're trying to act
[1:59:13] like Hollywood.
[1:59:14] Hollywood glitters. The gospel glows.
[1:59:18] There's a lot of difference between
[1:59:20] glitter and glow. See, Hollywood
[1:59:22] glitters with clothes and rickies and
[1:59:25] ricquettas and rettas. But God's humble
[1:59:31] God humbly glows
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; in humility of the believer. No matter
[1:59:37] how ignorant he is, he glows in
[1:59:40] humility, not shines in Hollywood.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Humility.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Humble yourselves
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; to the word of God.
[1:59:58] But Jesus said, "When he, the Spirit of
[2:00:02] truth, is come," see, he will bring
[2:00:05] these things that I have taught you to
[2:00:08] your memory, the word.
[2:00:14] What's the Spirit of truth going to do
[2:00:16] when he comes? He's going to bring you
[2:00:19] back to the word.
[2:00:22] And he'll also show you things to come.
[2:00:26] There is the real spiritfilled church
[2:00:30] now stays with the word reflects the
[2:00:34] word. God on earth.
[2:00:41] How is God on earth? Because there's a
[2:00:44] people living the word.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; He's the word. You're the word.
[2:00:52] You're living the word.
[2:00:55] We just got to get the world out.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; We've got to get our ideas out. We've
[2:01:02] got to get back.
[2:01:05] All of us need to start reading our
[2:01:08] Bibles.
[2:01:17] God on earth. He doesn't need any
[2:01:19] theologian cuz his word is of no private
[2:01:23] interpretation.
[2:01:25] He interprets his own word by
[2:01:28] vindicating it and proving it. That's
[2:01:31] true.
[2:01:33] He'll vindicate it and prove it
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; to you.
[2:01:44] He says, I'm going to ask you something.
[2:01:47] How can a man or a woman who claims to
[2:01:50] be filled with the Holy Spirit, which is
[2:01:53] the word,
[2:01:56] That's right.
[2:01:58] The Holy Spirit is the word.
[2:02:04] How can you be in the flesh of the Holy
[2:02:08] Spirit
[2:02:10] has made you a part of him to reflect
[2:02:13] the gospel of your age and deny the word
[2:02:18] that he wrote?
[2:02:23] Don't deny it with unbelief.
[2:02:27] Don't deny it by not taking the promise.
[2:02:31] Don't deny it by thinking it won't work.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; It will not fail.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Believe it.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; It won't fail. It'll work for you.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; No matter who you are, how young you
[2:02:46] are. If you can read, read it. It'll
[2:02:49] work.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; It'll work for you.
[2:02:54] And I'd like to read this last little
[2:02:55] statement
[2:02:57] in closing.
[2:03:01] He said, "Look,
[2:03:03] hurrying,
[2:03:05] there must come a true seed.
[2:03:09] There just has got to be because he's
[2:03:13] coming for the bride without spot or
[2:03:16] wrinkle. He's coming for it. A word
[2:03:19] vindicated bride.
[2:03:23] Oh, she'll be such a little bitty group.
[2:03:26] Jesus said, as it was in the days of
[2:03:29] Noah, wherein eight souls were saved. Is
[2:03:32] that right? So shall it be in the coming
[2:03:34] of the son of man. How many? I don't
[2:03:37] know. But see, the bride is going to be
[2:03:41] made up of all down all down through
[2:03:46] that had the word in their age. It's not
[2:03:50] just this last group.
[2:03:53] God is going to take the whole thing out
[2:03:55] of here. Oh my.
[2:03:58] And there's so many other wonderful
[2:04:01] things. But I I just wanted to go back
[2:04:04] and just close with this.
[2:04:09] You've got to have a relationship
[2:04:12] with the word.
[2:04:17] The word is meant to be fed on.
[2:04:22] Man doesn't live by bread alone, but by
[2:04:26] every word that proceeds out of the
[2:04:29] mouth of God.
[2:04:32] You'll find yourself starving.
[2:04:36] You'll find yourself weak. You'll find
[2:04:39] yourself not able to overcome.
[2:04:45] I got dizzy the other day and I just so
[2:04:47] dizzy I couldn't hardly go on. And I
[2:04:50] said, I says, "What's wrong with me?"
[2:04:51] And it dawned on me. I hadn't eaten.
[2:04:58] So I said, "Leslie, would you make me a
[2:05:00] bologn sandwich with two slices of
[2:05:02] baloney?"
[2:05:05] And I ate that sandwich.
[2:05:07] And man, it wasn't no time. I started
[2:05:10] feeling better,
[2:05:13] you know. And then I ate a few things I
[2:05:14] shouldn't have eaten, but that was
[2:05:16] great.
[2:05:17] I justified it.
[2:05:24] We'll starve.
[2:05:29] You want this message to be mean more to
[2:05:32] you.
[2:05:36] You really want this to become more
[2:05:37] alive.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Put it together
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[2:05:48] Things that are in here you don't see,
[2:05:50] he'll show them to you.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; He didn't add to or take away.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; He revealed.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; If you obey this word,
[2:06:04] it'll come to pass.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; You have a wayward child,
[2:06:10] go read the prodical son.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Read about the woman at the well. Read
[2:06:17] about the one caught in adultery.
[2:06:20] You see how he acted? That's how you
[2:06:22] act.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; You're a reflection.
[2:06:26] The We can go forward
[2:06:30] when we come together.
[2:06:33] Every single one of us believing this
[2:06:35] word is true.
[2:06:38] Bringing ourselves subject to the word
[2:06:42] of God. If there was one needy amongst
[2:06:45] us today and they wanted to be prayed
[2:06:47] for and they came up and said, 'You
[2:06:50] know, I'm not doing too good.
[2:06:53] And we join together
[2:06:55] and we ask the father.
[2:07:00] Now, we wouldn't approach him with Lord,
[2:07:02] I think you should.
[2:07:06] Lord, this is what I think you should
[2:07:07] do.
[2:07:09] Uh, has anybody counseledled God lately?
[2:07:13] No. But Lord, you said
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; that you'd in no wise turn them away.
[2:07:23] If someone came with sickness
[2:07:26] and we were to anoint them with oil or
[2:07:28] lay our hands on them, the only thing we
[2:07:32] have is, Father, you said that by your
[2:07:35] stripes this person was healed.
[2:07:38] You said if I ask anything in the
[2:07:41] Father's name that you would do it.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; No, I'm here
[2:07:48] obeying that word and standing on that
[2:07:52] word.
[2:07:54] Your spirit is in that word. So if I
[2:07:57] obey that word that manifests his spirit
[2:08:03] and we see him glorified in his word.
[2:08:08] Not glorified in the laying on of hands,
[2:08:11] not glorified in the faith of the
[2:08:13] preacher,
[2:08:15] but glorified
[2:08:17] in his word.
[2:08:23] We saw the word manifested.
[2:08:26] We saw Malachi 4:5,
[2:08:29] Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7, and many
[2:08:33] other scriptures manifested in the flesh
[2:08:36] in our day. That was the word made flesh
[2:08:41] in our day.
[2:08:43] You have been elected
[2:08:46] become the word made flesh,
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; the bride of Christ,
[2:08:53] the union between the word
[2:08:57] and his bride. And they become word,
[2:09:01] word upon word, line upon line,
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; the word.
[2:09:07] whole church.
[2:09:10] When you start taking God at his
[2:09:12] promises and seeing them fulfilled in
[2:09:15] your life, you will shout.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; You will sing. You will praise God. You
[2:09:21] will give thanksgiving because you know
[2:09:24] he's alive. You know he's with you. You
[2:09:27] know he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:09:29] forever. And if he promised that he's
[2:09:31] coming again to take you,
[2:09:35] that where he is, you may be also, you
[2:09:38] can know that promise is as sure as a a
[2:09:42] rock,
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; and you're looking one day. So leave
[2:09:46] those things which are behind behind
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; and let's press
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; for the higher calling.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand.
[2:10:01] The musicians would come
[2:10:05] play softly
[2:10:07] something.
[2:10:13] [Music]
[2:10:23] We were told many times to look into the
[2:10:26] mirror
[2:10:28] of God's word, our eurum thundum.
[2:10:35] And
[2:10:40] I hope the truth of what was said this
[2:10:44] morning
[2:10:48] might not be able to preach the
[2:10:52] windows out of the walls or make the
[2:10:55] ceiling fall down.
[2:10:58] But if you'd simply
[2:11:02] in your heart ask yourself,
[2:11:07] "Have I been comparing myself
[2:11:11] to the Bible?
[2:11:15] Have I been living the scriptures?"
[2:11:20] And I'll be the first to raise my hand
[2:11:23] and say, 'Lord, I've failed
[2:11:25] so much.
[2:11:31] I've just ran on the gas that was in my
[2:11:34] tank. And
[2:11:37] then I'm surprised when I find myself on
[2:11:39] empty.
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:44] Then I realize, Lord, I've got to eat
[2:11:46] and feed every day spiritually.
[2:11:51] I've got to live by these promises
[2:11:53] that's in this message.
[2:11:57] I've got to read
[2:12:02] and hear from you.
[2:12:06] And I'm promised that if I live that
[2:12:09] word,
[2:12:11] that would be you living in me.
[2:12:15] And the works that you did, I do also,
[2:12:19] but I wouldn't do them by my own
[2:12:21] strength, by my own might, by my own
[2:12:23] spirit,
[2:12:25] but I'd be doing them by the spirit of
[2:12:27] the word
[2:12:30] because the Holy Spirit is the word.
[2:12:34] Jesus is the word.
[2:12:40] And we can partake of divine nature
[2:12:45] by
[2:12:48] believing and accepting
[2:12:51] these great and exceedingly precious
[2:12:56] promises.
[2:12:57] Father, I pray that I can start living
[2:12:59] by the promises of God's word.
[2:13:03] The promise of your soon return.
[2:13:07] The promise
[2:13:08] of you molding me and making me into
[2:13:11] your image.
[2:13:13] The promise of not being conformed to
[2:13:16] this world, but being transformed.
[2:13:21] Father, I ask if there's any in our
[2:13:24] midst this morning
[2:13:27] that really have got separated from
[2:13:30] their scriptures and their Bible.
[2:13:36] They've really
[2:13:39] kind of got caught up in the
[2:13:42] the natural bread of life
[2:13:47] and they've neglected their spiritual
[2:13:50] man, the inner man,
[2:13:53] and they'd like to raise their hand to
[2:13:55] you this morning and say, "Father,
[2:13:58] I want to get back into a greater
[2:14:00] relationship with your word.
[2:14:05] I want to know that this Bible is mine
[2:14:09] and every word in this book
[2:14:12] is given to me to live by.
[2:14:16] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
[2:14:19] word will not pass away.
[2:14:24] Father, I'm called and created to live
[2:14:28] by this word
[2:14:30] and there's no satisfaction without it.
[2:14:34] Father, if you didn't kindle that in our
[2:14:37] hearts,
[2:14:39] the testimonies would start rolling off
[2:14:41] our lips.
[2:14:44] The praises would start moving in our
[2:14:47] heart
[2:14:50] because they're word produced.
[2:14:53] And when they're word produced, they're
[2:14:55] everlasting.
[2:14:59] They're eternal.
[2:15:02] And we become part of that great
[2:15:04] eternal.
[2:15:07] Lord, I pray that you just
[2:15:10] enkindle in me a greater desire
[2:15:14] to connect with every promise in this
[2:15:17] book and live by it. Father, those that
[2:15:21] raised their hands this morning,
[2:15:26] they know in their heart whether they've
[2:15:27] been reading,
[2:15:30] whether they've been listening to your
[2:15:32] spirit,
[2:15:35] whether they've been studying, Father,
[2:15:37] and you're not here to condemn.
[2:15:40] You're here to encourage.
[2:15:43] You're here to speak to them and say,
[2:15:44] "Come back.
[2:15:46] Come back to my word.
[2:15:50] And may you touch the heart and may they
[2:15:53] see the importance.
[2:15:55] May they walk out this morning with the
[2:15:58] determination
[2:16:00] to be more connected with the
[2:16:02] scriptures, more connected with the word
