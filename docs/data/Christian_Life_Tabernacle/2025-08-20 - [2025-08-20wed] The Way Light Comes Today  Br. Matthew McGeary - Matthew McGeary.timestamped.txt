[8:42] [Music]
[8:48] Let's look to the Lord in prayer
[8:49] together. Our precious heavenly father.
[8:54] Lord, how we thank you, God, for life
[8:57] and
[8:59] the breath of life that you promised,
[9:02] Lord, that you'd breathe upon us your
[9:03] own life. Lord, as we come to here
[9:06] tonight, Lord, we
[9:09] Lord, we want to receive what you have
[9:12] for us tonight, Lord.
[9:15] Lord, we believe that you have
[9:16] something, Lord, in store for us today.
[9:19] Cuz Lord, your word said that whether
[9:23] two or three are gathered in my name,
[9:25] I'll be in their midst, Father. And
[9:28] we're
[9:30] desiring food, Lord. And surely we can
[9:33] look to your promises tonight and know
[9:36] that when we leave here, Lord, we'll be
[9:39] nourished by the vitamin of your word.
[9:42] And Lord, we Lord, even as our pastor
[9:45] said this past weekend, Lord, we if
[9:47] we're wrong about something, we want to
[9:49] be corrected, Lord. We want to be right,
[9:52] Lord. We'd rather be right now, Lord, so
[9:54] that we can accept your grace and move
[9:56] forward. So, pray you'd speak to every
[9:59] heart here, Lord. the request that was
[10:02] mentioned, Lord. Sister Glatty, Lord,
[10:05] needing a touch. Pray you bless her and
[10:08] raise her up, Father, that she can be
[10:10] back in fellowship and strengthen,
[10:13] Father. Every request that was made
[10:16] known by the uplifting of the hand,
[10:18] Lord. I pray that it would be a personal
[10:21] answer tonight, Lord, by the preaching
[10:23] of your word. And Lord, as we want to
[10:26] give, Lord, we want to give cheerfully,
[10:28] Lord. and pray that it would be a
[10:30] blessing to people of God and to those
[10:33] who are hungering. Father, as we commit
[10:36] everything to you, Lord, we just want to
[10:38] Lord, forget about ourselves, Lord.
[10:40] Forget about the day, Lord. Forget about
[10:43] the things that are trying to press us
[10:45] from hearing your voice. Lord, we pray
[10:48] that we would look past any humanity,
[10:51] our own thoughts. Lord, let the word
[10:54] speak to us personally tonight. And
[10:56] we'll be careful to praise you and honor
[10:59] you by living whatever you tell us in
[11:01] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[11:06] Amen. God bless you. Welcome everyone in
[11:08] the house of God to turn around and
[11:10] welcome someone tonight. Amen.

[20:48] um I was not expecting to come here and
[20:51] be in front of you because just part of
[20:54] courtesy visit to brother Jeier
[20:58] and uh as I met the pastor brother uh
[21:02] David
[21:04] &gt;&gt; in Manchester
[21:06] that was June um 2018 or 17 when he came
[21:12] to officiate the wedding brother Eric
[21:15] and the sister Marian France. Then I met
[21:18] the pastor and uh he's a real man of
[21:22] God. I love him. I love the way he
[21:25] preached, the way he present the
[21:27] message.
[21:29] Uh
[21:30] God bless you. There's not much to say.
[21:32] I was in West Palm Beach with brother
[21:35] WCO and uh they say you must be careful
[21:39] in America when they introduce you you
[21:42] have to say a few word that exalt
[21:45] I don't do that I just to read something
[21:48] for you it's just to bless you
[21:56] is not from me it's from the prophet
[22:01] and what the prophet says
[22:04] the Holy Spirit is like a suctioning
[22:08] power force. The willpull
[22:12] to attract you to him
[22:14] &gt;&gt; so that he can cast out all the word all
[22:18] the pressure of the world from you out
[22:21] and to let the Holy Spirit to come into
[22:23] you.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; And today is a glorified Jesus Christ.
[22:28] What the prophet say was preached 25th
[22:32] February 55. Cain and Abel both of those
[22:37] boys realized that
[22:40] they were mortal. They were dying and
[22:45] burning down
[22:47] like a candle. And someday must return
[22:52] back.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Back
[22:58] to the dust
[23:01] and to the maker that brought them
[23:07] forth. And they wanted to find favor
[23:11] with God.
[23:13] So they both
[23:16] come
[23:18] to worship.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Dear brethren, we are part of God. Amen.
[23:25] I was just talking with brother John.
[23:28] Church is not a place to play around.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Is to be transformed in the image of the
[23:35] Lord Jesus Christ.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; As you know, God sent a prophet.
[23:41] There's not much to say about how
[23:44] religious you are.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Ken was religious. Maybe more religious
[23:49] than you and I.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; But it have the revelation.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You and I today we do have
[23:57] revelation for the prophet. Let us come
[24:00] down,
[24:01] &gt;&gt; humble ourself
[24:03] &gt;&gt; with the singleness of the heart
[24:06] &gt;&gt; and follow the path of the prophet.

[35:50] There's no mountain to high, no valley
[35:55] too low. There's no fear that I have. He
[35:59] doesn't already know. There's no problem
[36:03] too big. There's no weapon too strong.
[36:07] There is nothing for God that's
[36:11] impossible.
[36:15] So I won't be shen
[36:21] and I won't be moved.

[38:29] faithful to his promises. As long as I
[38:31] keep I keep taking him at his promise,
[38:34] he will lead me to the promised land. If
[38:37] we could just come as the word is being
[38:38] preached tonight and say I will walk in
[38:40] and I'll know that my God is able to
[38:43] take care of all of my needs tonight.

[41:06] gater.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad we serve a a risen
[41:11] savior tonight?
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Let's just go before him. Lord Jesus,
[41:14] how we are so thankful to be gathered
[41:16] together,
[41:18] Lord, under the revelation of the
[41:20] message of the hour that's been brought
[41:22] to us by a vindicated prophet of Malachi
[41:25] 4:5 that we're not in the darkness and
[41:28] the shadows of dark denominations, Lord,
[41:30] but your light has risen upon the bride
[41:32] and called us out of the tombstones of
[41:35] denominations, Lord. And you've set us
[41:37] upon a strong rock of revelation, Lord.
[41:40] What an exciting time to be living in
[41:42] the climax of the hour of the catching
[41:44] away of your bride. Lord, we know this
[41:46] is just one step closer to the great
[41:48] catching away. So Lord, we are just so
[41:50] thankful to be here. We thank you for
[41:52] the songs and the worship and all those
[41:54] that have come. We remember those that
[41:56] aren't able to make it. Lord, pray that
[41:57] you'd be their portion. But now, Father,
[41:59] as we turn to the the word, we just pray
[42:02] that you'd come, Father, and do what
[42:03] only you can do and take your word and
[42:05] break the bread of life and feed your
[42:07] people. I pray we just love you, Lord.
[42:09] We surrender to you the best that we
[42:11] know how. In Jesus Christ's name we
[42:13] pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have
[42:16] your Bibles, let's just turn in Isaiah
[42:18] 60. My just a wonderful atmosphere and
[42:21] presence here. It's just so good to have
[42:23] the opportunity. Amen.
[42:26] You know, I was away uh just preaching
[42:28] at brother uh Matt Morris's church there
[42:30] and and you know, it kind of struck me
[42:33] while we were having church. I said to,
[42:34] you know, why don't we act like this
[42:36] might be the last service we ever have?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; You know, my could you imagine if we
[42:40] came with that kind of expectation and
[42:42] just kind of said, you know what, if if
[42:43] this is going to be it, I'm going to let
[42:45] I'm going to let people know whose side
[42:47] I'm on. I'm going to let my brothers and
[42:48] sisters know that I believe this is the
[42:50] church. Look, if if this is my last
[42:52] opportunity, Amen. I'm going to Amen.
[42:54] I'm going to give it my all. I say,
[42:55] that's how we ought to live for Jesus
[42:57] Christ. You know, uh we ought to be
[42:59] living like he he he's coming right now.
[43:01] you know, he's coming in the morning and
[43:03] and we need to redeem the time. And
[43:05] sometimes it's so easy to get under the
[43:07] load and the pressure of of of the age
[43:09] that we're living in. We kind of lose
[43:10] sight. But it's it's good to be reminded
[43:12] of those things because hey, it could
[43:14] be,
[43:15] &gt;&gt; this could be the night.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow morning could be the the
[43:18] morning.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; I say even so, come Lord Jesus. Isaiah
[43:23] 60 and verse one.
[43:27] Arise,
[43:28] shine,
[43:30] for thy light is come
[43:33] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[43:38] thee.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; The glory of the Lord has risen upon
[43:42] thee. We pray a blessing on the reading
[43:44] of the word. You may have your seats. If
[43:46] you'll also turn on over with me into
[43:48] John
[43:50] chapter 8,
[43:52] maybe we'll just um
[43:56] read the first uh 12 verses here. And I
[44:03] um would be taking a a text also from
[44:05] verse 12. But I I love how this story is
[44:09] the story that's right before that says,
[44:11] "And Jesus went to Mount Olives,
[44:14] and early in the morning he came again
[44:16] into the temple, and all the people came
[44:18] unto him, and he sat down and taught
[44:20] them.
[44:23] And they say unto him, Master, this
[44:25] woman was taken in adultery in the very
[44:28] act." Now if if you know the uh
[44:32] Levitical law and the the law of Moses,
[44:34] this is not a good place to be. Now
[44:37] Moses in the law commanded us that such
[44:41] should be stoned. But what sayest thou?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; This they said, tempting him that they
[44:51] might have to accuse him. But Jesus
[44:54] stooped down with his finger, wrote on
[44:57] the ground as though he heard them not.
[45:00] You know, sometimes that's what you got
[45:01] to do.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; So when they continued asking him, he
[45:05] lifted up and he said unto them, "He
[45:08] that is without sin among you, let him
[45:11] cast
[45:12] &gt;&gt; a stone at her."
[45:15] And again he stooped down and he wrote
[45:16] on the ground. And they which heard it,
[45:18] being convicted
[45:20] by their own conscience,
[45:23] went out one by one, beginning at the
[45:27] eldest, even unto the last. And Jesus
[45:31] was left alone, and the woman standing
[45:35] in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up
[45:38] himself, saw none but the woman.
[45:43] He said unto her,"Woman, where are those
[45:45] thine accusers? Hath no man condemned
[45:48] thee?" She said, "No man, Lord." And
[45:52] Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I
[45:53] condemn thee.
[45:56] Go and sin no more." Then spake Jesus
[46:00] again unto them, saying, I am the light
[46:04] &gt;&gt; of the world. He that followeth me shall
[46:09] not walk in darkness,
[46:11] &gt;&gt; but shall have the light of light.
[46:15] Brother Brandon would say in shalom, he
[46:18] would say that son is the word of God.
[46:20] In the beginning, God said, "Let there
[46:21] be light." When the manifested word of
[46:25] God, when the word of God was
[46:27] manifested, there was light. First, God
[46:29] spoke it. What if it didn't manifest?
[46:32] Then it wasn't light yet. But when he
[46:35] spoke it and then it was manifested,
[46:37] vindicated. His word was a vindicated
[46:40] light come into existence. And that's
[46:42] the only way it can be done now is when
[46:45] the word is vindicated.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Now just just let's don't move through
[46:50] this too quickly. That's the only way it
[46:52] can be done now is when the word is
[46:55] vindicated. God's written word
[46:57] vindicated. Then it shows light. It's a
[47:00] portion is lit or put out of each age.
[47:03] And we find it in the church ages. We
[47:06] find it in the Old Testament church
[47:07] ages. Each time that there come a time
[47:10] for a certain manifestation of the
[47:12] journey. Now we are in a certain
[47:14] manifestation of the journey. And it
[47:17] come time for a certain manifestation of
[47:18] the journey. There was a prophet come to
[47:21] the earth and the word came to the
[47:24] prophet and he made that word live.
[47:28] And when that word was identified, it
[47:32] reflected God. And there was the age.
[47:36] There was the light. And that's the way
[47:38] light comes today. And with the help of
[47:41] God, I'd like to minister to you this
[47:43] evening on the way light comes today.
[47:47] You know, the word came to the prophet
[47:49] and he made that word live
[47:52] &gt;&gt; and it was the light to the age. And I
[47:55] want to say as we receive that word and
[47:57] that word is identified in us, it is
[48:00] light.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; It it illuminates our soul. It it it
[48:04] illuminates our life and our decision
[48:06] and in our path and a and you know once
[48:09] we were groping in darkness and didn't
[48:11] know which way to go. But then when the
[48:13] vindicated word it comes and identifies
[48:16] that seed and and something is quickened
[48:18] and made alive and and now that very
[48:20] word is identified in you. It's taken
[48:23] away the confusion and the darkness.
[48:25] You're not wondering, "Do I need to turn
[48:26] left or right?" But your eyes are set
[48:28] straight on Calvary and and you're
[48:30] walking onward, Christian soldiers, and
[48:33] and you know where you come from and and
[48:34] you know where you're going and even
[48:36] when the enemy would throw trials and
[48:38] tribulations and things would come upon
[48:40] you. You know, there might be
[48:41] discouragement and things, but oh, if
[48:42] there's a revelation down on the soul,
[48:45] we we we know where we're going. We're
[48:46] not confused. We're not wandering in
[48:48] darkness because we've been illuminated
[48:50] that the light has come. It it shined
[48:52] into the darkness and a and we were once
[48:55] alienated from God and and we were in
[48:58] sin and trespasses but now we are
[49:00] quickened. Aren't you thankful for the
[49:02] quickening power of almighty God? Amen.
[49:05] That he would come and quicken the seed.
[49:07] And in Ephesians was saying he hath
[49:09] quickened uh raised us up together and
[49:11] made us sit together in heavenly places
[49:13] in Christ Jesus. And Jesus would say in
[49:17] Matthew 5:14, he'd say, "Ye are the
[49:20] light of the world. A city that is set
[49:23] on a hill cannot be hid." And and I just
[49:26] want to say that you are the new
[49:27] Jerusalem. You are that city. Uh you are
[49:30] that city on Mount Zion. And you have
[49:33] been set on a hill. You have been set on
[49:36] a rock of revelation. God has lifted you
[49:38] up out of the dark denominations and
[49:40] tombstones of Lady Osia. And he has set
[49:43] you upon a strong rock of revelation.
[49:46] And you are that city. You are that city
[49:48] of Zion that is set up on a hill. Oh,
[49:51] let your light shine.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; We've been lifted up. We've been raised
[50:00] up out of the dead. And now I just want
[50:03] to say that we know where we are
[50:05] standing.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; We don't have to presume. We don't have
[50:09] to wonder. We we don't h are we in this
[50:11] age? Are we in that age? Is there coming
[50:13] another message? No. We are right at the
[50:15] final climax. We've received our last
[50:17] sign. We've received the anointed word,
[50:20] our Messiah, and now it's being
[50:22] quickened in the bride. And soon and
[50:24] very soon, we will be changed.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Verse 16 would say, "Let your light so
[50:29] shine before men."
[50:32] &gt;&gt; That they may see your good works and
[50:34] glorify your father which is in heaven.
[50:36] I want to say, don't hide your
[50:38] revelation. Satan's always want to offer
[50:41] a bushel basket or something to occupy
[50:43] you or or or or to keep you tied up and
[50:46] too busy. But I want to say we ought not
[50:48] hide this great revelation that which
[50:50] was freely given. I say freely give.
[50:52] There ought to be something inside of
[50:53] the believer. Oh, that we we're shining
[50:55] forth a light into a dark generation
[50:57] that they might see your good works and
[50:59] glorify God.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to focus on a portion
[51:03] of that quote there. He says, "But when
[51:06] he spoke it
[51:08] and then it was manifested, vindicated,
[51:12] his word was a vindicated light come
[51:15] into existence."
[51:17] And that's the only way it can be done
[51:19] now is when the word is vindicated.
[51:22] God's written word vindicated, then it
[51:25] shows light.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say the word
[51:28] manifested in you is light. Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour in you is the
[51:35] vindication of what was spoken.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; You see, just like it was in the
[51:40] beginning, he said, "Let there be
[51:41] light." But there that no one knew what
[51:44] the what that was going to be until it
[51:46] came into existence. And I want to say a
[51:48] prophet has stood on the earth declaring
[51:50] there's coming a bride. There's coming
[51:52] an invincible army. Uh there's one
[51:54] that's rising up. I can stand here and I
[51:56] can say I'm beholding the very words
[51:58] that was spoken. You are that bride.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Well, that ought to make you excited.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; You ought to rejoice that you are the
[52:08] very vindication of the word. You are
[52:10] the very vindication of the message of
[52:12] the hour. He said there would be a bride
[52:14] and here she is.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; The word manifested in you is light. And
[52:22] it's a v vindication of the word. Look,
[52:24] I I I don't have to I don't have to
[52:27] wonder, you know, if I got a house down
[52:29] the street.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; I know I got a house down the street.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; You want to know how I know I come from
[52:34] there?
[52:36] &gt;&gt; I come from that house.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Look, I I I don't have to wonder where
[52:39] I'm going because I come from there.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; I came from glory and I'm going back to
[52:44] glory. I don't have to wonder if God's a
[52:46] healer because I've been healed. I don't
[52:48] have to wonder if he's a deliverer cuz
[52:49] I've been delivered. I don't have to
[52:51] wonder if he's a savior cuz I've been
[52:53] saved. I don't have to wonder if he
[52:55] quickens because I've been quickened. I
[52:57] don't wonder have to wonder if he
[52:58] changes a lie because I've been changed.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not wondering. I'm not beat down. I
[53:06] I'm not under traditions of man's and
[53:08] and man's ideas. I'm not wondering if
[53:11] I've I've been run over here and I've
[53:12] been run over there. I'm not over here
[53:14] wondering. No, I know whom I believed in
[53:19] &gt;&gt; and I'm persuaded.
[53:25] Let your light so shine before men.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; That they may see your good works.
[53:38] I say, Lord, help us in that department.
[53:41] James 2:20 would say like this, "But
[53:44] wilt thou know, oh vain man, that faith
[53:47] without works is dead?"
[53:50] Brother Brandham said, "If you don't
[53:51] have words with your faith, it shows you
[53:53] haven't got faith. You're just talking
[53:55] from your mouth.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that do a lot of
[53:59] talking.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that run their
[54:01] mouth. There's a lot of people that
[54:03] quote the prophet. They say, "Brother
[54:04] Brandham said, Brother Brandham said,
[54:05] but where is the life? Where is the
[54:07] fruit? Where is that Holy Spirit? Where
[54:09] is that quickening power? Where is that
[54:12] ability to be Christ to an individual
[54:14] that could come to an individual that's
[54:16] in a need? They're in darkness. They
[54:18] need deliverance. They need light to
[54:20] shine into the ground. Where is that
[54:21] light? It ought to be in you. It ought
[54:23] to be in you. It ought to be in you.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, you might fool men.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; But you are not going to fool God.
[54:40] Well, did Isaiah the prophet say, "You
[54:43] honor me with your lips,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; but your heart is far from me?"
[54:51] &gt;&gt; So many want to just say they believe in
[54:53] Jesus Christ. Many want to say they
[54:56] believe the message may be within
[54:57] certain realms. What? Just to take away
[54:59] the approach,
[55:01] &gt;&gt; just to fit in.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; But what about the life? What about your
[55:04] works? What about your private time?
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I just it strikes me
[55:10] that this family one time they had a a
[55:14] several children, you know, and and each
[55:16] one of them kept going into the Navy and
[55:18] and one by one they kept going into the
[55:20] Navy and they couldn't understand it.
[55:22] They said, "There's nobody in our family
[55:23] that was in the Navy. Why has each one
[55:26] of my boys each one gone into the Navy?"
[55:28] And and after researching and doing some
[55:30] study, they realized that every night in
[55:32] their bedroom, they laid on that bed and
[55:34] there on their wall was a picture of a
[55:36] Navy ship. And they started to set their
[55:39] affection on that. Something in them
[55:40] started working and it created a desire,
[55:43] an ability in them. Oh, I say set your
[55:45] affections on things above and not on
[55:48] the earth. If you're looking for a
[55:49] better job and all these things and it's
[55:51] all you ever think about, then sure, you
[55:53] might go right into it. But I say, let's
[55:55] lift up the message of the hour. Let's
[55:57] lift up a message of vindicated word
[56:00] that we have received. Let's set our
[56:01] affections on things that are above.
[56:09] says this further in shalom.
[56:12] The world is one of the most chaotic
[56:14] times of darkness
[56:16] that it's ever stood in
[56:18] and yet is standing in again the most
[56:23] blessed light that ever did shine.
[56:27] And the difference is just like it was
[56:29] in the beginning
[56:32] when there was gross darkness upon the
[56:34] earth
[56:36] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[56:38] face of the water and said let there be
[56:40] light and God separated the light from
[56:43] the darkness. And I believe that we are
[56:45] now living in that hour again
[56:50] &gt;&gt; that when God is separating the light
[56:52] from the darkness
[56:54] &gt;&gt; and he's pressing it to the other side
[56:57] of the world that the light might be
[57:00] made manifest.
[57:02] The prophet said that God took that
[57:04] great chaos and and darkness and and
[57:07] everything that was all over the the
[57:09] world the world and and there was all
[57:11] this just doom and gloom and it it
[57:13] seemed like what is what is this
[57:15] creation? What is this lifeless form
[57:17] just hanging out there in eternity?
[57:20] What's the purpose? But God by his word
[57:22] took that chaos and he transformed it
[57:25] into a garden of Eden.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; And he said, "We're now living in that
[57:31] hour again.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness."
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I want to say that the spirit of
[57:38] God is moving upon your life.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; The the message of the hour is is is
[57:43] bringing light and life upon your life
[57:46] by the spoken word. And and it's driving
[57:49] away the darkness. It's driving away the
[57:52] confusion and all of those things that
[57:54] all the questions and and everything
[57:56] that you had there arise and shine. The
[57:59] glory of the Lord has risen upon you.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Just trying to pace oursel through here
[58:06] our text. It says, "I am the light of
[58:08] the world.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; He that followth me shall not walk in
[58:14] darkness."
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Look, I I say we we have such an
[58:17] opportunity right now. I I don't know
[58:20] where you've been living. I I don't know
[58:21] where you've been and and I don't know
[58:23] how difficult or undeical, but I want to
[58:26] say there is a message. There is a word
[58:28] right now that if you'll follow that
[58:30] word, you can follow it right out of the
[58:32] darkness. You can follow it right out of
[58:33] the unbelief, right out of the
[58:35] confusion, right out of the torment. I
[58:37] don't care what the devils is. I don't
[58:38] care what the darkness is. There is a
[58:40] light that is shining forth right now.
[58:42] And you can walk away from your prison.
[58:44] You can walk away from your bondage. You
[58:46] can walk away from your fear. You can
[58:48] walk away from it all. And I say if you
[58:51] follow the message of the hour,
[58:57] &gt;&gt; oh sure, we can lay hands on you. We can
[58:59] pray for you. We have a divine
[59:01] commission to cast out evil spirits.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; But that spirit will just wander.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; And if you don't get that that Holy
[59:10] Ghost,
[59:12] &gt;&gt; your estate will be worse than the
[59:14] first.
[59:17] Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to pray for deliverance.
[59:20] I've seen a lot of people that wanted to
[59:21] be delivered, but they didn't want to be
[59:23] healed.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Pastor, fix my life. Fix my marriage.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Why are you ready to make a surrender?
[59:31] Well, that's not the problem.
[59:34] I like my entertainment. I I like the
[59:37] way that I'm living. I I like to be a
[59:39] part-time Christian, but take away the
[59:41] reproach. Take away the bondage. Take
[59:43] away the hurt. Oh, there got to come a
[59:46] place where you're ready to to to to die
[59:48] out locked, shock, and barrel and say,
[59:50] "If I lose my friends, if I lose my
[59:52] family, if I lose it all, I don't care.
[59:54] Oh, God, I need deliverance. And if I
[59:56] don't get the Holy Ghost at this altar
[59:58] tonight, you'll find a pile of bones
[1:00:00] right here." And I tell you, when you
[1:00:01] get down to business, God will meet you
[1:00:03] in your time of need.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Let's don't be borderline believers.
[1:00:14] So many people come so far. God sent a
[1:00:16] prophet.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; But what did he send a prophet for?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; So many people recognized that John was
[1:00:21] a prophet.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; But they never recognized his message.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; John was the light of the day. And Jesus
[1:00:30] said, "Oh, John was a burning light and
[1:00:32] you rejoiced in his season."
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; But then came the time, "Hear ye him.
[1:00:43] I say, let's go all the way into the
[1:00:44] promised land.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of the adoption of
[1:00:48] sons.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of manifested sons and
[1:00:53] daughters of God.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; You do not have to stop short. There is
[1:00:58] no man, no bishop, no church that can
[1:01:00] tell you you can only go so high
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; because a vindicated prophet has come
[1:01:05] and taken the limits off.
[1:01:07] that there is no ceiling to this
[1:01:09] message. There is no ceiling to say you
[1:01:11] can only go so high. I want to say if
[1:01:13] you can believe it, you can have it. All
[1:01:16] things are possible to them that
[1:01:17] believe. If you need an arm restored,
[1:01:20] you can have an arm. If you need a baby,
[1:01:22] you can have a baby. If you need your
[1:01:24] health, you can have your health. If you
[1:01:26] need your prodical sons and your
[1:01:28] prodical daughters, I say speak to the
[1:01:30] mountain.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of the fullness of
[1:01:34] dominion.
[1:01:38] Go ahead and point to my faults and
[1:01:40] point to my failures. I'll point to a
[1:01:42] bleeding, bloody sacrifice that hung
[1:01:44] there on Calvary and nailed all of my
[1:01:47] sins and my faults.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; There is therefore now no condemnation.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. There is therefore now
[1:01:56] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:01:59] Christ Jesus.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Let's get the condemnation off of the
[1:02:03] bride.
[1:02:05] You can do the greater works.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; The Psalms say in 119,
[1:02:14] thy word is a lamp
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; unto my feet
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; and a light unto my path.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said it lights the
[1:02:25] path of every believer into his
[1:02:28] presence.
[1:02:32] I say what ought Christians ought we
[1:02:33] ought to be.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; What kind of light should be shining?
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; What kind of work should we have?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Prophet said in the papist vision he
[1:02:42] said everywhere those early believers
[1:02:44] went.
[1:02:46] They went preaching the gospel word and
[1:02:49] God confirmed that word with signs
[1:02:51] following. The sick were healed. The
[1:02:53] devils cast out and they spoke in new
[1:02:55] tongues.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; That was the word in action.
[1:03:01] That word has never failed in the mouths
[1:03:04] of believing Christians and in this last
[1:03:07] stage.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; It is here stronger and greater than it
[1:03:11] ever was
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; in the true word bride.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; that I can say
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; I said I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[1:03:28] one of them. True word believers with
[1:03:32] signs and wonders are following. Why?
[1:03:34] Because we preach the word and the
[1:03:36] believers believe and we get the
[1:03:38] results.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I am a son of God.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; I am the bride of Jesus Christ. I am an
[1:03:46] overcomer. I can do the greater works. I
[1:03:50] am going in a rapture.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know about you, but have
[1:03:56] you ever been called bad names?
[1:03:59] You're a failure. You can't make it. You
[1:04:01] ain't the bride. You ain't got the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You'll never be good enough. You're
[1:04:06] foolish virgin.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; You fell again yesterday. You'll never
[1:04:10] make it. You'll never get total victory.
[1:04:13] Well, I do not want to sound like the
[1:04:15] devil.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Devil, shut up. Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Arise
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; and shine.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; The glory of the Lord is risen upon you.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Why are you listening to all that name
[1:04:33] calling anyways?
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Why you stick around for it?
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Do you like hearing it or does it
[1:04:40] justify your loose living?
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't overcome so I might as
[1:04:44] well smoke. I can't overcome. I might as
[1:04:46] well lust. Maybe I am foolish. I'll
[1:04:49] never get total victory.
[1:04:51] I might as well watch the movies. I
[1:04:53] might as well enjoy the entertainment.
[1:04:54] Well, if I'm predestinated, oh, I say
[1:04:57] you ought to start saying what the word
[1:04:59] said about you. Quit listening to the
[1:05:01] devil. Quit listening to the carnivine
[1:05:04] and listen to a vindicated word. Listen
[1:05:06] to Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30, Revelations
[1:05:10] 10 1-7 who said, "You are justified. You
[1:05:14] never get it in the first place. You are
[1:05:16] standing the virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:05:18] Christ. You are perfect.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That ought to create a faith in you to
[1:05:24] speak a mountain into existence.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; We ain't baby fashion.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; I ain't looking for a funny feeling. I
[1:05:34] ain't looking for some fantastic and oil
[1:05:36] in the hands. I'm looking for the
[1:05:38] manifested word. I'm looking for a first
[1:05:41] one that come into maturity. A son of
[1:05:43] God with all the fruits of the spirit,
[1:05:46] had the humility. He He had the the the
[1:05:49] right attitude. He had the right walk.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; We want all the big stuff.
[1:05:58] We want all the big fantastic.
[1:06:00] But what about down in the valley
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; when the tough gets going?
[1:06:07] Well, if that's just the way it is, I'm
[1:06:10] just going to watch a movie. If that's
[1:06:12] just the way it is, I'll just do this,
[1:06:15] man. Quit babying your flesh.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Look, if music's got a hold of your
[1:06:20] life, why don't you get Why don't you do
[1:06:23] battle?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; You know, we got people that are sitting
[1:06:26] amongst us, good believers, believing
[1:06:30] they've received the Holy Ghost, and
[1:06:31] they're struggling with worldly music.
[1:06:37] Don't keep living like that.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; The light is here to shine into that
[1:06:42] darkness.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Look, if you haven't been able to handle
[1:06:46] yourself, get some help.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Get your pastor. Get a man of God. We
[1:06:50] got a divine commission. Let's do
[1:06:52] battle.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Satan, you've been exposed.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; You've been tormenting a daughter or a
[1:06:58] son of God, and they don't want to
[1:07:00] listen to that Tommy ride anymore. I
[1:07:02] rebuke that devil and that spirit. Come
[1:07:04] away from her.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost come in into that
[1:07:09] place. Fill that heart.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Are you one of them tonight?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe you say, "Well, brother,
[1:07:20] you know, I don't see the word in
[1:07:22] action." Brother Brandham said that the
[1:07:24] evening light,
[1:07:28] he said that the evening light can't be
[1:07:29] anything but back to acts again.
[1:07:35] It was to restore the faith.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; And I maybe maybe we do a little checkup
[1:07:40] tonight and you say, "Well, I don't see
[1:07:42] the word in action in my life." Or, "I
[1:07:45] want the light to shine brighter." Is
[1:07:47] there anybody here that can identify
[1:07:49] with that?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Paul would say this. He would say, "Be
[1:07:54] angry." Ephesians 4:26, he says, "Be
[1:07:57] angry and sin not. Let not the sun go
[1:08:00] down upon your wrath.
[1:08:03] If you have something that has not been
[1:08:04] made right, never lay down and go to bed
[1:08:07] without making that right.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; You are not guaranteed tomorrow. I say
[1:08:11] if there's something I don't know about
[1:08:12] you, but praise God, he made me this
[1:08:14] way, but I I just can't hardly I can't
[1:08:16] stand to have something there nagging. I
[1:08:19] can't stand for there to be something
[1:08:20] left undone. I can't stand there to be
[1:08:22] something ain't there. It's something
[1:08:23] inside me. I just got to make that
[1:08:25] right.
[1:08:26] And there's things in the church and in
[1:08:28] our marriages and our family and with
[1:08:30] our kids and and and and things we got
[1:08:32] to make right, church.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; And God forbid we're taking communion
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; and we got those things laying there. I
[1:08:42] say, "Oh, don't be angry and sin not.
[1:08:44] Let not the sun go down about your upon
[1:08:46] your wrath.
[1:08:48] Neither give place to the devil.
[1:08:51] Give no place.
[1:08:53] Give no room.
[1:08:56] Give no opportunity.
[1:09:02] Give no place to the devil. That's
[1:09:05] usually the problem is we make room for
[1:09:07] him.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; You know, he starts badmouthing you.
[1:09:12] Say, "Well, pull up a chair."
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; You're right. I failed yesterday. Go
[1:09:17] ahead. Tell me how what's what a loser I
[1:09:20] am.
[1:09:21] Do not give any place to that.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Don't give any room to the devil.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; No room.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I say, "Lord, may I just get so
[1:09:34] full of the Holy Ghost?
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Fill my mouth. Fill my heart. Fill F
[1:09:39] feel every fiber of my being where there
[1:09:41] is just no room.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Or do you do you like the world? Do you
[1:09:48] like to have a little room for for for
[1:09:51] the flesh?
[1:09:52] I say give no place to the devil.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hold on to that word. Fill your mouth
[1:09:59] and your heart with it.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; I like how the prophet of God said this.
[1:10:03] He said, "A real way to testify is not
[1:10:07] in the church. It's out in dark places."
[1:10:10] I'll just read this.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; It's out in dark places. Let your light
[1:10:14] shine where it's dark.
[1:10:18] Go to the road houses and different
[1:10:19] places and where sin and things is
[1:10:22] heaping. Then let your light shine.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; There is the place to do it.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Look, this this book isn't going to walk
[1:10:32] off the pulpit and go to your job.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; It's the word.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; But it's in a book.
[1:10:40] It's not going to get up and walk out
[1:10:42] and go to your place of work. What do
[1:10:43] you got to do? You got to take this
[1:10:45] book.
[1:10:46] You got to eat this book
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; and you got to prophesy again.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; And this word that has been spoken has
[1:10:53] to become manifested in you. And then
[1:10:56] you become the light to the world.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; You are epistles written and read of all
[1:11:02] men.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[1:11:09] Peace. The glory of the Lord has risen
[1:11:12] upon you. I don't know if you've looked
[1:11:15] out there, but has anybody looked out
[1:11:16] there in the world? It's pretty dark.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's it's ugly.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; It's terrible. There's insanity
[1:11:23] everywhere.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; But in the midst of all that, there is a
[1:11:27] people.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. The glory of the Lord
[1:11:35] has risen upon you.
[1:11:38] Now Jesus would say this and we're just
[1:11:40] trying to work towards
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; the way life comes today. He said Jesus
[1:11:45] in five Matthew 5:13 he said ye are the
[1:11:47] salt of the earth. But if the salt has
[1:11:50] lost its savor
[1:11:53] if it's lost its testimony if it's lost
[1:11:57] its effect or its ability it can't cure.
[1:12:00] It can't help. It can't heal.
[1:12:03] It can't illuminate.
[1:12:10] Do do you want to be the light of the
[1:12:12] world?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be able to impart eternal
[1:12:15] life?
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be able to go into those
[1:12:18] dark places and let your light shine?
[1:12:21] Brother Brandham said, "Let our lives be
[1:12:22] so salty that others can watch the way
[1:12:25] we act and live that they'll want to
[1:12:27] live that way, too."
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; How are we ever going to do it? We got
[1:12:32] to start setting our affections on
[1:12:33] things that are above. Forgetting those
[1:12:36] things that are in the past,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; good and bad.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; I'm glad you got a good track record and
[1:12:41] I'm glad you gone to church for 30
[1:12:43] years. But I say what? Let's forget
[1:12:45] those things that are in the past and
[1:12:46] let's press toward the mark of the high
[1:12:48] calling of Jesus Christ. Look, it's home
[1:12:50] time. It's time to go in a rapture. It's
[1:12:52] time to go in a body change. I say we
[1:12:54] ought to be like Rahab. Let's get
[1:12:56] everybody we can under the token.
[1:12:58] Judgment is coming. It's all about to be
[1:13:00] tore down. This world is ripe for
[1:13:02] judgment and to be burned up. I say,
[1:13:03] let's get everybody in.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, Paul would say, "Are you so foolish
[1:13:12] having begun in the spirit? Are you now
[1:13:15] made perfect in the flesh?" I think
[1:13:17] that's so many times where we get
[1:13:18] ourselves in trouble. We we get going
[1:13:20] good for a little bit and a while, maybe
[1:13:22] we get a little bit of revelation and we
[1:13:24] feel good. We've done a little bit of
[1:13:25] reading Bible and going to church and
[1:13:26] then we just go on cruise control.
[1:13:29] I'm doing pretty good now, Brother
[1:13:30] Billy. I've been going to church. I've
[1:13:32] been reading my Bible. I'm doing all
[1:13:33] right now. I can just kind of I can just
[1:13:35] update with the news and I can kind of
[1:13:36] just chat with the friends and I can
[1:13:38] update and see where the old friends are
[1:13:40] and everything. And all of a sudden, you
[1:13:41] get walloped right upside the head and
[1:13:43] you get knocked down flat and you wonder
[1:13:44] why how in the world did that ever
[1:13:46] happen? Are you so foolish having begun
[1:13:49] in this in in the spirit? Are you now
[1:13:51] perfected in the flesh? And I'll just
[1:13:53] take that up a notch. Look, it it ain't
[1:13:55] going to be by your good works. You
[1:13:57] ain't going to earn your salvation. You
[1:13:59] ain't going to earn yourself into a
[1:14:00] rapture. No, we need to be led by the
[1:14:03] spirit of God. Those that are the sons
[1:14:05] of God, they are led by the spirit of
[1:14:07] God. We ought to be in fervent prayer.
[1:14:08] We got to have a prayer life. We got to
[1:14:10] be seeking God. We got to be praying for
[1:14:12] revelation. We got to be praying for our
[1:14:13] brothers and sisters. We got to pray for
[1:14:15] our pastor. Pray for the church. Pray
[1:14:16] for our lives. Pray for our jobs. Pray
[1:14:18] for our families.
[1:14:24] Galatians 5:16 says this I say then walk
[1:14:28] in the spirit
[1:14:31] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:14:34] the flesh.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; I say keep the light on.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; You wonder why the darkness is creeping
[1:14:43] in. Have you let the light go out?
[1:14:48] You know, I've been feeding the fire.
[1:14:49] You know how it is. You can build a
[1:14:51] humongous bonfire. I mean, we've done it
[1:14:52] here at the church. My I mean, we we
[1:14:54] we're able to get a lot of wood from
[1:14:56] someplace and there's just no no limit
[1:14:58] to it. And you can stack that thing up
[1:14:59] and build a fire 30t high and 30 feet
[1:15:02] wide. But guess what? If you quit
[1:15:04] throwing wood on it, I don't care how
[1:15:05] fire how bright and big that fire is,
[1:15:08] it's going to get smaller, smaller, and
[1:15:11] smaller until it's just some ambers.
[1:15:15] And you wonder, "Brother David,
[1:15:19] why is my fire going out?"
[1:15:22] Well, I mean, I Well, you've been you've
[1:15:24] been reading. You've been praying.
[1:15:26] When's the last time you listened to a
[1:15:27] tape? Well, the last time you played it
[1:15:29] in church.
[1:15:32] Oh, I don't know about you, a car
[1:15:35] doesn't get very far down the road
[1:15:36] without gas.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; And this bride ain't getting very high
[1:15:39] without the message of the hour.
[1:15:43] You got to take this word and you got to
[1:15:45] eat it up.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Take what the five-fold ministry for the
[1:15:48] edifying and the perfecting of the
[1:15:50] saints and eat it up.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; We are the final voice to the final
[1:15:54] generation under our messenger.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Keep the light on. Do those works that
[1:16:00] you know. I mean we we we give no place
[1:16:02] to the devil.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; If you need to testify, call me. I love
[1:16:05] a good testimony.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Tell somebody.
[1:16:10] I don't know if you if anybody if you
[1:16:12] ever feeling down and out and you feel
[1:16:13] like something's wrong, just testify.
[1:16:15] Just sing a song. Do something.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Give no place to the devil. If you start
[1:16:20] feeling gloomy and everything, look, we
[1:16:22] got to have some spiritual awareness in
[1:16:23] the church. We got to start recognize
[1:16:25] we're in a battle. We're in a fight. Why
[1:16:27] is this little gloom in the house? Why
[1:16:28] are the kids unsettled? Why is the wife
[1:16:30] unsettled? We let's let's get some
[1:16:32] spiritual awareness. Let's get discern
[1:16:34] some discernment in our homes and in our
[1:16:36] lives and in our job and start realizing
[1:16:38] I'm in a battle.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; You know that 200,000,000 demons were
[1:16:44] loosed at the river Euphrates and they
[1:16:46] are attacking those Jews through uh
[1:16:48] through Iikman and Stalin and Hitler.
[1:16:52] But now those spirits have turned what?
[1:16:54] And been loosed on the bride.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; And and you wonder why it's hard to
[1:17:00] pray.
[1:17:03] You wonder why you're having such a hard
[1:17:04] time at work.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; We're in a battle.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this in shalom.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "I've come to the spot. I
[1:17:16] believe that people don't know what
[1:17:18] they're doing."
[1:17:20] It comes to the time to where the human
[1:17:22] being has look like become such a
[1:17:26] subject to evil until it's a pathetic
[1:17:28] thing.
[1:17:29] seems like there's a shadow of darkness
[1:17:31] just over the people that presses them.
[1:17:34] And and you see how this gross darkness
[1:17:36] is pressing people to to drugs and
[1:17:39] alcohol and and substitutes and and
[1:17:42] insanity and and people are losing their
[1:17:44] minds as prophesied 60 years ago that if
[1:17:47] this thing goes another 50 60 years
[1:17:49] there'll be total insanity. We are
[1:17:51] witnessing total insanity upon
[1:17:54] civilization. People have lost their
[1:17:56] mind and they've lost common sense and
[1:17:58] reason and mamas and daddies don't even
[1:18:00] know how to be mamas and daddies
[1:18:02] anymore. They become murderers and and
[1:18:05] and nervous wrecks and and they need
[1:18:07] drugs and hypos and everything to try to
[1:18:09] keep it together. Why? Because there
[1:18:11] there's such a gross darkness pressing
[1:18:13] upon civilization.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; But in the midst, oh my, just like it
[1:18:20] was, what did the prophet say? He said
[1:18:22] it it right now we're standing
[1:18:25] just like it was in the beginning.
[1:18:29] There's this gross darkness upon the
[1:18:31] earth. This this confusion.
[1:18:35] But right in the midst of all the
[1:18:37] confusion,
[1:18:39] there's word seed laying there.
[1:18:42] There's word seed laying in there.
[1:18:46] And the prophet would say it like this.
[1:18:50] He would say,
[1:18:52] I just backing up into a message
[1:18:54] preached just uh right before shalom.
[1:18:56] It's there's a man that can turn on the
[1:18:58] light. He says the seed was already upon
[1:19:01] the earth.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; I believe God had planted the seed and
[1:19:06] just as the sun could get to that seed,
[1:19:12] it began to grow.
[1:19:14] And that's the reason it only taken days
[1:19:16] to bring forth these things.
[1:19:19] Because the seed was already in the
[1:19:21] earth. All it needed was light.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Because in that seed was what?
[1:19:28] Transforming power.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; But no light, no life. No light, no
[1:19:36] power.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; No message, no deliverance.
[1:19:41] No message, no light.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; No message, no quickening power.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Look, this this is not this is not a
[1:19:52] history lesson tonight.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; But that same quickening power was that
[1:19:57] was back there is right here, right now,
[1:20:00] present amongst us.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; He's omnipresent. He's omnipotent.
[1:20:07] The same God that was with Moses is the
[1:20:09] same God that's here right now. The same
[1:20:11] God that was with brother Brandham is
[1:20:13] the same God that's here right now.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; This isn't this isn't a a history lesson
[1:20:17] of saying, "Oh, there was light back
[1:20:19] there." But that light is here right now
[1:20:22] in God's believing bride. It is the
[1:20:24] vindicated word and it's here stronger
[1:20:27] and greater and in more power than it's
[1:20:29] ever been. I say the pillar of fire is
[1:20:31] right here right now tonight. I say,
[1:20:34] "What do you have need of? What are you
[1:20:36] going through? What do you want? I say
[1:20:38] you don't have to put it off in the
[1:20:39] future and you don't have to look back
[1:20:41] 60 years to try to to think something
[1:20:43] up. You can have what you have need of
[1:20:45] right now. Pray for revelation.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see you standing here
[1:20:50] right now amongst us. The same
[1:20:52] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; He goes on and says paragraph 73, and
[1:21:00] that's the way God has today.
[1:21:03] just maybe trying to move towards
[1:21:06] the inspiration of what we're trying to
[1:21:07] bring here. He says and that's the way
[1:21:10] God has today. His seed is already here,
[1:21:14] his word. The only thing it needs is
[1:21:16] light on it.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Now, now I want to just say it goes both
[1:21:21] ways, right? Because it's both it's word
[1:21:24] coming to word.
[1:21:28] The word was there and now God bringing
[1:21:30] a vindicated prophet is going to shine
[1:21:31] light on that word and make that word
[1:21:33] vindicated and alive. We'll just read
[1:21:35] the prophet. He says and that's the way
[1:21:36] God has today. His seed is already
[1:21:38] there, his word. The only thing it needs
[1:21:39] is light on it. And he is that light for
[1:21:43] he is the word.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; The word and the light is the same
[1:21:48] thing.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; The life in there is the light of the
[1:21:53] word. See, it's the life. The germ of
[1:21:56] life lays within the grain. The life is
[1:22:00] what breaks forth and brings forth the
[1:22:02] life out of the grain. That's the way
[1:22:04] that Christ in the word makes the word
[1:22:07] do what it's supposed to do.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Just like the life in the grain of wheat
[1:22:12] or whatever it is, it makes the wheat do
[1:22:16] what it's supposed to do.
[1:22:19] Hallelujah.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; When I'm about to get happy cuz I could
[1:22:21] never do what I was supposed to do
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; until the light of the message of the
[1:22:26] hour shined upon this scene.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; I was put here for a purpose. I was born
[1:22:31] for a purpose. I might have been born to
[1:22:33] my mommy and my daddy, but oh, I have a
[1:22:36] heavenly father. I was predestinated and
[1:22:39] placed in Ladyia for a purpose.
[1:22:43] I tried to fulfill that purpose out in
[1:22:45] the world with drugs and alcohol and
[1:22:47] loose living and jobs and money and all
[1:22:49] those things, but none of those things
[1:22:51] could ever fulfill the purpose of the
[1:22:54] seed.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; You were looking, you were wondering,
[1:22:59] you were trying to figure out why can I
[1:23:01] never be happy? Why do I always need
[1:23:03] more of this and more of that? It's just
[1:23:05] empty substitutes. But when the light of
[1:23:08] the message of the hour strikes that
[1:23:10] seed, it satisfies.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; It's everything that I was ever looking
[1:23:17] for.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; It told me who I was, where I came from,
[1:23:21] where I'm going.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; It revealed to me my purpose.
[1:23:31] There is no greater purpose
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; than to be the word made flesh.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; He chose you
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; to be the message of the hour made
[1:23:44] flesh.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; He chose you to be the vindicated word.
[1:23:52] You were that seed word
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; and there was darkness and chaos.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Just like Christ said, "I got needs to
[1:24:00] go by Samaria." He said, "I got needs to
[1:24:02] send you Elijah.
[1:24:05] I got needs to send you the voice of
[1:24:07] Elijah. I got seed out there.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; It's laid out there, Lady Osia. And all
[1:24:13] the potential is in the seed. But when
[1:24:15] this word becomes vindicated and it
[1:24:17] shines on that seed, there will be a
[1:24:20] transforming power that you might come
[1:24:23] into your purpose.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Your purpose ain't to be a mechanic.
[1:24:29] Your purpose ain't to be a good
[1:24:31] architect. Your purpose ain't to be a
[1:24:33] painter. Your purpose to is to be a Holy
[1:24:36] Ghost filled Jesus Christ light shining,
[1:24:39] victorious bride of Jesus Christ with
[1:24:41] the same acts flowing in you that flowed
[1:24:44] in the apostles.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You might be in disguise as a painter,
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; but you're a peculiar one.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Hey, this this painter, he not only can
[1:24:56] he change the color of the walls, but he
[1:24:58] can cast out evil spirits.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. Jesus was a carpenter
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; by trade, but he was much more than a
[1:25:07] carpenter.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. What about you? If he was the
[1:25:10] light of the world and he said, "You are
[1:25:12] the light of the world." You are so much
[1:25:13] more
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; than what Leia want you to be.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; We don't fit into the mold.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; I don't fit into the mold of Lady Osia.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not happy with just a paycheck.
[1:25:32] I'm not happy with just a fancy car.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not happy with just a good house.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I am happy with the revealed word of the
[1:25:41] hour. I'm happy with Malachi 4:5. I'm
[1:25:44] happy that I heard my name. When the
[1:25:47] seven seals were unveiled and that seven
[1:25:50] seal thundered out, it called my name
[1:25:52] and I'm happy about it.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:01] Well, I might just have a jubilee by
[1:26:02] myself.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Because if it wasn't for that,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; I might be six feet under. If it wasn't
[1:26:10] for that, I'd be in a prison cell. If it
[1:26:12] wasn't for that, I would be serving the
[1:26:15] purpose of the devil. But oh God, rich
[1:26:18] in mercy wherewith in the grace that he
[1:26:20] loved me, he called my name.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; He called me out of you. He said, "Come
[1:26:26] up higher.
[1:26:28] You don't belong down there.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Just like the life in the grain of wheat
[1:26:38] or whatever it is, it makes the wheat do
[1:26:42] what it's supposed to do
[1:26:45] because it is the life that's in it.
[1:26:49] Now, maybe the devil right here's
[1:26:51] fighting against somebody.
[1:26:53] Devil, you're defeated.
[1:26:57] Okay. Yeah, sure. You you've done a lot
[1:26:58] of things you haven't done, but what is
[1:27:00] it in there that's saying, "I believe
[1:27:02] that."
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Something else is saying, "But you could
[1:27:05] never live it." But something in there
[1:27:06] saying, "I believe it."
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Who you going to listen to? I choose a
[1:27:11] vindicated word. I choose the message of
[1:27:14] the hour. I choose the light of the day.
[1:27:16] I'll listen to that.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I get excited. I don't know any
[1:27:20] other way to be
[1:27:23] Cuz
[1:27:25] I know what I was.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; I know what the devil was trying to sell
[1:27:30] me. I know what the devil was trying to
[1:27:32] make me. Make me some salesman with some
[1:27:34] career and some hobbies. And I was
[1:27:36] doomed for a devil's hell. But then the
[1:27:39] message of the hour come crying, "Grace,
[1:27:41] Grace, you don't belong down there in
[1:27:43] that chicken yard. You don't need to
[1:27:45] clock up with all of them. Come up
[1:27:47] higher.
[1:27:54] All life.
[1:27:55] So life
[1:28:00] is only by the word of God made
[1:28:02] manifest.
[1:28:05] Life comes only by the word of God made
[1:28:08] manifest.
[1:28:10] As long as it's just in the book like
[1:28:15] this,
[1:28:18] it can still be questioned.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; But when it's made manifest,
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; then you see the product
[1:28:31] of what it spoke of
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; being manifested.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Then that is light on the word.
[1:28:40] The word said so and then when it comes
[1:28:43] to pass
[1:28:45] that is life
[1:28:47] in light.
[1:28:50] Light bringing life.
[1:28:54] Light
[1:28:55] brings life. Now in our text here this
[1:29:00] woman
[1:29:02] no doubt maybe she tried to resist.
[1:29:05] Maybe she didn't want to go that way.
[1:29:08] But according to the testimony of these
[1:29:10] Jews, they've caught a woman in the very
[1:29:12] act of adultery. And she is subject to
[1:29:15] the law. And I want to say that she was
[1:29:18] in a very bad spot.
[1:29:21] She was doomed to die and she was guilty
[1:29:23] of the act because the law said in the
[1:29:26] mouth of two or three witnesses, let it
[1:29:27] be established.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; So now the witnesses have brought her
[1:29:31] before the word.
[1:29:35] And now they're saying to the word
[1:29:39] according to the law, here is this
[1:29:42] woman. She's in darkness. She's in
[1:29:45] chaos. She's doomed to die. The word
[1:29:48] says to stone her for for for she's
[1:29:51] guilty.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; But now here's the light of the world.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to say they brought her to
[1:30:00] the right place.
[1:30:04] Hey, don't just bring me to church.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Don't just bring me to some theology.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Don't just bring me to a courthouse. If
[1:30:12] you're going to bring me anywhere, bring
[1:30:14] me to the master.
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And here
[1:30:21] in the presence of that light,
[1:30:24] though they were blinded by it,
[1:30:28] he ignores them and tearries and then
[1:30:31] says,
[1:30:32] Oh, I I wonder what that atmosphere
[1:30:35] found felt like. I wonder how exposed
[1:30:39] they felt standing in his presence
[1:30:42] when he said, "He who is without sin."
[1:30:45] I wonder if just a flood of memory and
[1:30:48] law and how many times maybe they should
[1:30:51] have been stoned and all the things that
[1:30:53] they done. And from the eldest
[1:30:56] to the youngest, they all walked away.
[1:31:02] And he asked her, "Where are thine
[1:31:03] accusers?"
[1:31:07] And she said,"None
[1:31:09] but
[1:31:11] thee."
[1:31:14] And what did the word say?
[1:31:17] "Neither do I condemn you.
[1:31:22] Go and sin no more."
[1:31:25] And that light by divine promise has
[1:31:28] been made manifest again in Lady Osia.
[1:31:32] And we're all guilty,
[1:31:34] an adulterous generation, full of
[1:31:38] wickedness and chaos and sin
[1:31:41] ripe for the judgment. But then the
[1:31:44] capstone comes crying grace grace.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I did this and I did that.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; I made a mess of things and and Where
[1:31:55] where are thine accusers?
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:31:59] I guess I'm coming to you, Lord. I don't
[1:32:01] I don't accuse you.
[1:32:03] Go and sin no more. You see the light
[1:32:05] being manifested into the darkness. What
[1:32:07] did it do? It brought forth life.
[1:32:12] That's what the word does is it takes a
[1:32:14] hopeless situation.
[1:32:17] I say somebody out here, you ought to
[1:32:18] open up your heart. Let the light shine.
[1:32:21] You feel like your situation's hopeless,
[1:32:22] but I want to tell you that's what the
[1:32:24] light's here for.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; It's here to shine into the darkness and
[1:32:27] take a hopeless situation and turn it
[1:32:29] around.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says as we'll just work
[1:32:32] quickly towards a close.
[1:32:36] Paul said in Ephesians 5:8, he says,
[1:32:38] "For ye sometimes
[1:32:40] were in darkness,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; but now ye
[1:32:45] are light in the Lord. Walk as children
[1:32:48] of the light."
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; We ought to walk like him, talk like
[1:32:56] him,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; and act like him.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; And you forgive me for maybe being this
[1:33:03] foolish if it would be thought so. If
[1:33:06] it's so hard for you to wonder what it
[1:33:08] would have been like to be Christlike
[1:33:10] 2,000 years ago, then maybe you can just
[1:33:13] think back 50, 60 years ago,
[1:33:16] because I believe that same light was
[1:33:18] made manifested in the prophet,
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; a first one to maturity,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; testifying to the rest of the field.
[1:33:27] This is what this word will produce. And
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; the prophet of God said this in the
[1:33:38] Messiah. He said, "That's the way God's
[1:33:40] church is." His eagllets, his Messiah,
[1:33:42] they look like him. They act like him.
[1:33:45] They preach like him. They do the works
[1:33:47] that he did. The things that I do, he
[1:33:50] also more than this shall you do. Cuz I
[1:33:52] go to the father. These signs follow
[1:33:54] them. My eagllets, they'll do just as I
[1:33:57] do if my spirit is in them. they'll do
[1:34:01] the works that I do. If they don't do
[1:34:03] the works I do, that's because that my
[1:34:07] spirit is not in them.
[1:34:10] Now, friends, don't try to hang on to
[1:34:13] some works or some false vindication as
[1:34:17] an evidence that you got it.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; If you're struggling right there, just
[1:34:22] say, you know what? If I don't got it,
[1:34:25] Lord,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; I want it.
[1:34:29] We are not a religion. We are not a
[1:34:31] denominations. We don't need maracupas.
[1:34:34] We don't need we don't need two weeks of
[1:34:36] good works. And we don't need one year
[1:34:38] of good works. All he wants is a
[1:34:40] repented heart.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; You can't fix your whole world and run
[1:34:45] and make everything right if you've done
[1:34:47] so much wrong. But what you can do is
[1:34:48] come to the master
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; just as those men brought her to Jesus'
[1:34:52] feet and said, "Here's the problem." I
[1:34:55] say you ought to run to the altar, run
[1:34:56] to his feet, say, "Lord, here's the
[1:34:58] problem.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I'm a sinner
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; and I need your grace.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; I need your Holy Spirit.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; I don't see the same works. I don't see
[1:35:11] the same signs, Lord, but here I am."
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Now, just turning this corner here to
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; make this point.
[1:35:22] the message, the word of God is the so
[1:35:26] n.
[1:35:28] And brother Brandon would lay in
[1:35:30] principles through several messages
[1:35:31] where he would show how Moses was the
[1:35:34] anointed word for his day. And he would
[1:35:38] even say it like this. And who do you
[1:35:39] say this is? He say, "So if he was the
[1:35:41] messenger of that hour, he was the
[1:35:43] Messiah of that hour. He was the
[1:35:46] anointed one."
[1:35:48] And brother Brandon would say it like
[1:35:50] this.
[1:35:52] and turn on the light. I'm trying to
[1:35:54] bring this to the hour that we're now
[1:35:56] living. He says this internal light. He
[1:35:58] says, "Here was John on the earth."
[1:36:01] Making that written word live. He was
[1:36:04] the voice of one crying in the
[1:36:05] wilderness. And he also was preparing
[1:36:07] the way before the Messiah. And Jesus
[1:36:09] said, "You love to walk in his light be
[1:36:13] because he was that light, a bright and
[1:36:16] shining light." You know, the scripture
[1:36:17] if we go to it says, "You rejoiced for
[1:36:19] that season. Right? The light that John
[1:36:22] was shining, he he was the manifestation
[1:36:24] of Isaiah 40. Behold, when crying in the
[1:36:27] wilderness, now that written word was
[1:36:30] vindicated in John and it was now light.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; You you follow. And now he says and and
[1:36:38] he says you love to walk in his light
[1:36:41] because he was that light, bright and
[1:36:42] shining light. And John, he said, now I
[1:36:44] must decrease. My light must go out
[1:36:47] because I have served my time that's
[1:36:50] prophesied of me.
[1:36:52] Hear ye him. He is the one. Follow him.
[1:36:56] It's living in that day in in the day.
[1:36:59] So then now what is he pointing to? He's
[1:37:01] pointing to the Messiah. Right? Here
[1:37:03] comes the prophet at one place. Brother
[1:37:05] Brandham says it changed from the
[1:37:06] prophet to his prophecy.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Right? And now now now the word made
[1:37:13] flesh in Christ. We know he was the
[1:37:15] anointed word. The anointed Messiah.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Five to 10 more minutes. He was the
[1:37:20] anointed word. The anointed Messiah.
[1:37:22] Now, now listen to this. This is so
[1:37:24] you're following the principle, right?
[1:37:25] That that Moses was the anointed word.
[1:37:27] So much so that the prophet would say he
[1:37:29] was the Messiah for that hour, right?
[1:37:30] Because it was the light of God's word
[1:37:32] being manifested to the people. If you
[1:37:34] were going to go into an Exodus, it's
[1:37:36] going to be Moses. You're going to if
[1:37:37] you're going to escape the judgment of
[1:37:38] the wrath and the and the evolutionary
[1:37:41] age, it was going to be on the boat with
[1:37:42] Noah. Are you following me? That was the
[1:37:44] light of God's word. And now John, he
[1:37:46] was that burning light. But now he's
[1:37:48] saying, "I must decrease."
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Because now
[1:37:53] Jesus Christ, the Messiah.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; But now watch this. In John 16:7.
[1:38:01] Now here's the Messiah speaking to his
[1:38:02] disciples. He says, "Nevertheless, I
[1:38:04] tell you the truth. It is expedient for
[1:38:07] you that I go away."
[1:38:11] Could you imagine uh uh the disciples
[1:38:13] and how
[1:38:16] how could that be good? I I'm so brother
[1:38:18] Billy I Lord, what do you mean it's good
[1:38:22] that you're going to go away? You're the
[1:38:23] Messiah.
[1:38:25] You're everything that we hope for.
[1:38:27] You're everything that we believe for.
[1:38:28] You're going to restore the kingdom.
[1:38:31] What do you mean it's good that you go
[1:38:32] away?
[1:38:35] For if I go not away,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; the comforter will not come unto you.
[1:38:43] But if I depart,
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I will send them unto you.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; So it's better. It's profitable. Here's
[1:38:53] the Messiah tell. I'm going to go away.
[1:38:55] But if I go away,
[1:38:58] if I could say it like this, this body
[1:39:00] that you now see, this corporal body is
[1:39:04] going to go away.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; But I'm not staying gone. I'm coming
[1:39:08] back.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; And not in 2,000 years. I'm giving you a
[1:39:16] promise. If you go up there and tar in
[1:39:18] Jerusalem,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; you'll be endued with power from on
[1:39:22] high.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:27] So, it's not going to be the corporal
[1:39:28] body that comes back. It's going to be
[1:39:30] the spirit.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Because what is he wanting to do now?
[1:39:36] Just as John was that light.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Just as Jesus is that light, it's
[1:39:42] expedient that I go away because now you
[1:39:45] are going to be that light.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; I want to use your body.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; I want to use your life. I want to use
[1:39:52] your hands. I want to use your feet.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Now, we have received our Messiah,
[1:39:59] Christ, the anointed, vindicated word of
[1:40:01] the hour.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Is that too hard for for
[1:40:04] some people? I don't know about you, but
[1:40:06] Malachi 4:5 introduced me to Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ. The same yesterday, today, and
[1:40:09] forever. The seals that were told torn
[1:40:12] off. Well, the loosing of those seals
[1:40:14] revealed Christ.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled before us. Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I I I you you might see a man.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Many people look up there and see a man.
[1:40:26] Oh, but it's so much more. There is the
[1:40:29] logos, the pillar of fire,
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; a son of man, revealing the son of man.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Now remember what he said. Life
[1:40:42] comes only by the word of God made
[1:40:44] manifest.
[1:40:47] As long as it's in just in the book
[1:40:51] like this, it can still be questioned.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; You can question a lot of things
[1:41:02] and a lot of people have a question
[1:41:04] about the message and a lot of people
[1:41:06] want to ask questions and this and that.
[1:41:08] But I want to tell you, as long as it's
[1:41:11] just in letter form,
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; it could be questioned. as long as it's
[1:41:15] just in the Bible. As long as it's just
[1:41:17] on the tape.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; But when that word that's on the tape
[1:41:23] gets in you,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; hey, you can question a lot of things,
[1:41:28] but one thing you can't question. I once
[1:41:31] was lost,
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; but now I'm found.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; I once was blind,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; but now I see.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Like they wanted to question the blind
[1:41:41] man. Give God praise.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; We know this man is a sinner.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; We know brother Brandham is a false
[1:41:49] prophet.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; You can go ahead and call him whatever
[1:41:52] you want to call him. Alls I know is I
[1:41:55] once was blind.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Hey, I once was lost, but now I see. I
[1:42:02] have seen the light. The sen light has
[1:42:06] shined upon my predestinated seat. And I
[1:42:09] have been quickened. Go ahead and
[1:42:11] question it all you want, but I am free.
[1:42:14] Go ahead and question it all you want.
[1:42:16] You can question whether he's a healer,
[1:42:18] but I've been healed. You can question
[1:42:20] whether he's a deliverer, but I've been
[1:42:22] delivered. You can question whether the
[1:42:23] seals have been opened, but I've been
[1:42:25] opened. It has released the light that
[1:42:28] was in the seed, and I'm going back to
[1:42:31] glory soon and very soon. I know I'm
[1:42:34] going to be changed. If that same spirit
[1:42:36] that raised up Jesus Christ from the
[1:42:38] dead dwell in you, it will quicken.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; There is a quickening power right here
[1:42:45] this evening to quicken your mortal
[1:42:47] body, to quicken your thoughts, to
[1:42:49] quicken your life, to quicken your
[1:42:51] actions.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Let your light shine.
[1:43:03] Light brings life. If the musicians
[1:43:06] would come,
[1:43:13] brother Brandham played his part.
[1:43:16] Go ahead and get on to me all you want.
[1:43:20] Brother Brandham, even he identified it.
[1:43:22] Go study current uh present stage of my
[1:43:25] ministry, September 1962.
[1:43:29] Oh, it's just too clear.
[1:43:34] Brother David Boze, the angel of the
[1:43:37] Lord, told the prophet, "Take David
[1:43:38] Aboose out into the yard." And Joseph,
[1:43:42] Brother Joseph Boz said, "Brother Brand,
[1:43:43] have you ever read the rest of second
[1:43:44] Timothy?"
[1:43:48] And Brother Brandon says, "No, I I I
[1:43:49] guess I haven't."
[1:43:51] And and and Brother Brandham says to the
[1:43:53] congregation, "Go read it when you get
[1:43:55] home." Because brother Brandham was now
[1:43:57] entering into the last stage of his
[1:43:58] ministry. And if you read the rest of
[1:44:00] second Timothy, it says, "My time of
[1:44:01] departure is at hand. I've run a good
[1:44:04] fight.
[1:44:05] I've shined the light with all my
[1:44:07] heart."
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; But he's gone on to his reward.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And now we've received the word. But I
[1:44:18] want to tell you, it can't just stay in
[1:44:20] the book.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; It can't just stay on the tape.
[1:44:25] As long as it's there, it can be
[1:44:27] questioned.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; But when that word is made alive and
[1:44:31] vindicated in you, you are now the
[1:44:33] light.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; You are the light of the world.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Look, God God didn't ordain the the
[1:44:40] gospel to be preached with tracks and
[1:44:42] electronics. He ordained men and women
[1:44:45] to be born again and filled with the
[1:44:48] Holy Spirit.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And now ye are light.
[1:44:53] Now, I'm not discouraging anybody from
[1:44:55] passing out tapes and tracks,
[1:44:58] but I tell you what, they want to see
[1:44:59] somebody that's salty.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God says this
[1:45:06] in the Messiah, he says, "Then when God
[1:45:08] was made flesh
[1:45:11] and became the Messiah,"
[1:45:15] maybe you can just play softly pour your
[1:45:17] spirit out on me.
[1:45:21] Then when God was made flesh and became
[1:45:23] the Messiah,
[1:45:26] then if we
[1:45:28] can yield ourselves
[1:45:32] to be the anointed like he was,
[1:45:37] we become messiahes,
[1:45:40] little lights.
[1:45:42] That's what the church is supposed to
[1:45:44] be, lights,
[1:45:46] little anointed ones.
[1:45:50] But as long as it's just
[1:45:53] in the book,
[1:45:56] as long as it's just on the tape,
[1:45:59] it can be questioned.
[1:46:03] But when it's made manifest,
[1:46:06] the prophet of God said, "Then you see
[1:46:07] the product
[1:46:09] of what it spoke of being manifested."
[1:46:14] Now, the only way we know what Malachi
[1:46:16] 4:5 was going to be is because it's
[1:46:20] come.
[1:46:22] The only way we knew what were under
[1:46:24] those seals because they've been
[1:46:26] revealed.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Now, you might be wondering and
[1:46:31] questioning, "What is that bride going
[1:46:33] to be?
[1:46:34] What is she going to be like?"
[1:46:38] But I want to tell you, you don't have
[1:46:39] to leave here tonight wondering.
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:47] Saints,
[1:46:50] we are not waiting for something to
[1:46:52] come.
[1:46:54] It's already here.
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Like those lepers sat there.
[1:47:05] Why sit we here
[1:47:08] until we die? Brother Billy,
[1:47:12] when we got a storehouse full,
[1:47:15] if you see it in the word, church,
[1:47:18] do not stop short.
[1:47:22] That was just for the apostles. No,
[1:47:23] that's for you. That was just for the
[1:47:25] preachers. That's for you. He said he
[1:47:28] had to have a mighty invincible army.
[1:47:29] That's me.
[1:47:31] Let's start looking into the word and be
[1:47:33] like that little boy, mama. That's me.
[1:47:37] The pro prophet of God said it this way.
[1:47:39] This might give somebody encouragement.
[1:47:41] Don't look at what you used to be.
[1:47:44] Look at what you're going to be.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I might not be all of what he
[1:47:50] said, but I'm going to be it.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Because he said I would.
[1:47:57] So then when we start speaking like that
[1:47:59] devil I might have made the mistake but
[1:48:02] he said
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; he said
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; it is get behind me. He said
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I am the light of the world.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said upon this rock I'll
[1:48:17] build my church. The gates of hell can't
[1:48:20] prevail against it and I give unto them
[1:48:22] the keys. We're talking about being the
[1:48:25] light. I give unto you the keys.
[1:48:29] Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in
[1:48:31] heaven. Whatever you loose on earth,
[1:48:33] that's the divine revelation of the word
[1:48:36] made flesh. If it was flesh in that day
[1:48:39] by the son, the groom, it's the flesh
[1:48:43] today in the bride.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; See, whosoever sins you remit to them,
[1:48:49] they are remitted. Whosoever sins you
[1:48:52] retain to them are retained. Now, the
[1:48:54] Catholic Church picked that up and takes
[1:48:56] it to their priest, but that's carnal.
[1:48:58] Watch. It was the spiritual revealed
[1:49:03] word
[1:49:04] that did it.
[1:49:07] I church, I say, Lord,
[1:49:10] reveal that word to me. Show me who I
[1:49:13] am.
[1:49:15] Lord, give me skill and understanding.
[1:49:18] Lord, I I pray for revelation. Maybe
[1:49:20] with every head bowed.
[1:49:26] Your life declares what you are.
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:32] Maybe you don't look like what you will
[1:49:34] be.
[1:49:36] But is there something in your heart
[1:49:38] saying, "I want to be that word."
[1:49:41] Is there something in you saying, "I
[1:49:42] want to be more like Christ."
[1:49:46] If there's somebody here that
[1:49:50] just wants to draw closer to the Lord or
[1:49:53] maybe get a new refilling of the Holy
[1:49:55] Ghost.
[1:49:57] Maybe you've been bound and
[1:50:00] that's all right if others need to go
[1:50:02] and it's late.
[1:50:04] There might be somebody here that's
[1:50:06] tired of the cycles and the ups and
[1:50:10] downs and
[1:50:12] they haven't really been a light and
[1:50:15] they go out in the highways and byways
[1:50:17] but doesn't seem like maybe they're
[1:50:21] shining that light. Is there somebody
[1:50:22] here that say, "Lord, I want to be a
[1:50:23] better light.
[1:50:25] Lord, I need your Holy Spirit."
[1:50:29] Maybe you are struggling with cutting
[1:50:32] your hair or trimming off the ends
[1:50:35] and you haven't caught the revelation
[1:50:37] that
[1:50:39] that's contrary to the word of God.
[1:50:42] Maybe you need God to give you a better
[1:50:45] revelation on how to dress and carry
[1:50:47] yourself.
[1:50:49] Saints, I say there needs to be a total
[1:50:51] surrender tonight
[1:50:53] that our lives can start declaring that
[1:50:55] he's the same yesterday,
[1:50:58] today,
[1:50:59] and forever. Let's just sing this song.
[1:51:03] Pour your spirit out on me.
[1:51:07] Fall just like the rain.
[1:51:12] Saturate
[1:51:15] my thirsty soul.

[1:52:14] and make me whole.
[1:52:19] I need you now.
[1:52:23] Pour your spirit
[1:52:26] out.
[1:52:28] Lord, I seek you. Let's all stand. And
[1:52:31] Lord, I seek you.
[1:52:35] Help me find you.
[1:52:40] I need your touch.
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, find my tri
[1:52:51] broken places
[1:52:56] for your love.
[1:52:59] [Music]
[1:53:03] And Lord forgive me
[1:53:07] if I wonder
[1:53:10] [Music]
[1:53:11] far away from you.
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:19] You are all I
[1:53:23] ever needed.
[1:53:27] Come and make me new.
[1:53:33] Oh, pour your spirit out on me.
[1:53:38] Full just like the rain.

[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, why don't you just worship now?
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, come and fall aresh on me.
[1:53:54] Oh, fill my cup again.
[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:53:59] Heal my heart.
[1:54:02] Make me whole.
[1:54:07] I need you now.
[1:54:11] Pour your spirit
[1:54:14] out.

[1:54:32] For from you are all
[1:54:37] to you are all things.
[1:54:41] You deserve the glory.
[1:54:47] Oh, you are worthy of it all.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Oh, you are worthy of
[1:54:58] it all.
[1:55:03] Oh, for from you are all things
[1:55:09] to you are all things.
[1:55:13] You deserve the glory
[1:55:17] [Music]
[1:55:21] and all the saints and angels.
[1:55:29] Oh, they bow
[1:55:32] before
[1:55:34] your throne.
[1:55:39] All the heaven
[1:55:42] cries,
[1:55:44] their crowns before the land,
[1:55:48] oh God. Oh, sing it with all your heart
[1:55:51] now. Oh, you are worthy of it, Lord.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:56:00] You are worthy of it, Lord.

[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:56:17] you.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, you are worthy of it, Lord. Oh, he's
[1:56:22] the the lamb slave before the foundation
[1:56:24] of the world. He's worthy.
[1:56:28] Who is worthy to take the book?
[1:56:32] You are worthy of it all.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; That same one is here right now.
[1:56:38] What is your heart's cry?
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; What is your need?
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; You deserve glory.
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:57] What a wonderful name it is.
[1:57:02] What a wonderful name it is.
[1:57:06] The name of Jesus
[1:57:10] Christ our King.
[1:57:14] What a wonderful name it is.
[1:57:18] I think I'm rich.
[1:57:22] What a wonderful name it is. The name of
[1:57:28] Jesus.
[1:57:30] You were the word.
[1:57:33] You were the word in the beginning.
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:39] One with God the
[1:57:43] most high.
[1:57:49] Oh, you're in glory in creation.
[1:57:56] Now reveal in you our Christ.
[1:58:02] What a beautiful name it is.
[1:58:06] What a beautiful name it is.
[1:58:10] The name of Jesus
[1:58:14] Christ my king.
[1:58:18] What a beautiful name it is.
[1:58:22] Nothing compares to me.
[1:58:26] What a beautiful name it is the name of
[1:58:32] Jesus.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; We'll just quickly pray a dismissal. I
[1:58:38] feel maybe some would like to go but
[1:58:40] others just want to remain in his
[1:58:43] presence. Lord Jesus,
[1:58:46] we thank you that you've come by our
[1:58:48] way, Lord. And just pray that maybe a
[1:58:51] broken up message, Lord, but in that was
[1:58:54] your word. And
[1:58:56] I pray it brings light and life to those
[1:58:59] that have need of that light shining
[1:59:02] into their situations and their homes,
[1:59:04] Lord. And
[1:59:06] Lord, you said, "Ye are the light of the
[1:59:08] world." And you've given us such a great
[1:59:09] word and a message none other than Jesus
[1:59:12] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:59:14] forever. And Lord, we want that word to
[1:59:16] be born in us. Lord, as you said, ye are
[1:59:19] the light to the world. We want to
[1:59:22] be what you said we are to be, Lord, and
[1:59:24] go out there and be able to shine that
[1:59:27] light into the dark places and bring
[1:59:30] salvation and healing and deliverance to
[1:59:32] those that are needy. Lord, we want
[1:59:35] those same works to be found in us that
[1:59:37] are always attendant to your word, Lord.
[1:59:39] So, we just thank you for this time.
[1:59:42] Pray that you be with the needs of your
[1:59:43] people. Lord, as some are maybe needing
[1:59:47] to go, may you just bless their travels,
[1:59:49] the others that just want to remain in
[1:59:51] worship, Father. May there just be a
[1:59:53] sweet atmosphere that you can do with
[1:59:55] hearts, Lord. And Lord, maybe there's
[1:59:58] somebody here tonight. They're just like
[2:00:00] that woman.
[2:00:02] They've got caught in a lot of problems
[2:00:04] and
[2:00:06] they don't know how they're going to get
[2:00:07] out of it.
[2:00:10] Lord, you're the answer.
[2:00:13] And may that light just shine in through
[2:00:15] all the confusion and darkness right
[2:00:16] now, Lord, and bring a faith and a
[2:00:19] confidence that everything's going to be
[2:00:21] okay.
[2:00:27] You didn't want heaven without us.
[2:00:32] So Jesus, you brought hell. You are
[2:00:37] dismissed.
[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:42] My sin was greater. Your love was
[2:00:45] greater.
[2:00:49] What could separate
[2:00:53] us now?
[2:00:55] What a wonderful name it is.
[2:00:59] What a wonderful name it is.
[2:01:03] The name of Jesus
[2:01:07] Christ, my king.
[2:01:11] What a wonderful name it is.
[2:01:16] Nothing compares to this.
[2:01:19] What a wonderful name it is. The name of
[2:01:25] Jesus.
[2:01:27] I give myself away.
[2:01:30] [Music]
[2:01:34] Oh, I give myself away
[2:01:39] so you
[2:01:41] can use me. I give myself away.
[2:01:51] I give myself away.
[2:01:55] So are you.
[2:01:57] Can you see? Here I am.
[2:02:04] Here I stand.
[2:02:08] Lord, my life
[2:02:11] is in your hands.
[2:02:16] Lord,
[2:02:17] I long
[2:02:21] to see
[2:02:24] your desire
[2:02:29] in me
[2:02:32] and I give myself away.
[2:02:37] [Music]

[2:02:44] so you can

[2:03:00] so you
[2:03:02] can use me. Take my heart.
[2:03:09] Take my life
[2:03:13] as a living
[2:03:16] sacrifice
[2:03:20] and all my dreams. Yes, Lord.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; All my plans,
[2:03:29] Lord.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, just place it in his hands now.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; In your hands.

[2:03:40] it all to him. Oh,

[2:03:50] can hear me. I give myself away.
