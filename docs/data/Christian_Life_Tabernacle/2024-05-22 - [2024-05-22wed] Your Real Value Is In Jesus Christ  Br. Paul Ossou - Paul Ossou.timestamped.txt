[43:11] seats let's also turn to the Book of
[43:15] [Music]
[43:17] Romans we're going to read uh chapter
[43:23] 8 uh we'll just read the first verse
[43:27] [Music]
[43:28] the Bible says okay there is therefore
[43:32] now no condemnation to them which are in
[43:35] Christ Jesus we walk not after the flesh
[43:39] but after the
[43:41] spirit s Lord
[43:46] Jesus once again we invite you to come
[43:48] and bless this
[43:52] word and to help us say
[43:54] something that will bring us closer to
[43:57] you in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[44:05] amen I believe we still believe that
[44:07] we're happy to be gathered in the house
[44:09] of God
[44:13] tonight as David said that I was happy
[44:15] when they told unto me let's go to the
[44:17] house of the
[44:23] Lord uh from these few scriptures the
[44:25] Lord had put uh subject on my
[44:31] heart uh that I'm going to call your
[44:33] real place is in Jesus
[44:38] Christ or again your real value is in
[44:42] Jesus
[44:47] Christ we know in the society that we
[44:50] are living
[44:53] in and everything that we have in the
[44:55] world
[44:59] the we try to give value to
[45:02] things through
[45:06] everything for everything we encounter
[45:09] we we we we guess or we estimate what
[45:12] the value of that
[45:13] is if I want to get a bottle water
[45:17] there's a value for
[45:18] that I buy a clothing for there's a
[45:22] value for that if I want to buy a house
[45:25] there's a value for that
[45:31] and even up to uh we try to estimate the
[45:34] value of a
[45:38] person they're going to try to evaluate
[45:41] the value of that person according to
[45:43] the history of that
[45:45] person what that person has done in his
[45:50] life we try to give value to that person
[45:57] and the value is like a measure that's
[45:59] attached to
[46:04] something it's it's a value by which you
[46:07] can exchange
[46:11] something so I want to buy a bottle
[46:13] water they'll tell me it's a
[46:17] dollar therefore the value of the bottle
[46:20] water is a
[46:23] dollar and often time we estimate our
[46:26] own own value
[46:29] also based on what we are in
[46:33] society based on what we do at
[46:37] school based on what we are in the
[46:42] family but brother bam is telling
[46:46] us that this body of Flesh has no
[46:52] value has no value
[46:58] but as a man as a human we have to have
[47:02] value but what is our true
[47:08] value because often times is when man
[47:11] cannot recognize his own
[47:14] value that the circumstances of
[47:18] life will bring him to
[47:23] depression there are people that come to
[47:25] committing suicide
[47:29] because they couldn't confront or deal
[47:31] with certain things in
[47:38] life they estimated that the value of
[47:41] their life has gone down to zero that
[47:43] they can even commit
[47:49] suicide but what is our true value as
[47:52] Sons and Daughters of God
[47:57] [Music]
[48:00] I was thinking about it as Brother David
[48:01] was speaking about it in uh his
[48:03] preaching last
[48:05] Sunday even on
[48:10] Wednesday how do we find our
[48:14] identity uh by
[48:16] Prayer by the
[48:24] word and the value of this blanket that
[48:27] this man
[48:29] had that he he he himself never
[48:32] recognized that
[48:38] value until the day where something
[48:40] allow him to recognize the value of what
[48:43] he
[48:46] had and often time it's the same way
[48:49] that we are
[48:51] walking as Sons and Daughters of God
[48:56] sometimes forget that we are Sons and
[48:58] Daughters of
[49:00] God and we walk as simple human
[49:04] beings that have no
[49:07] value where brother Bram
[49:10] said that the soul that lives inside of
[49:14] us it's more than 10,000
[49:19] world so when you recognize you a Son of
[49:23] God that just your soul
[49:28] has a value of 10,000
[49:32] worlds not not not
[49:36] astonishing that when men
[49:40] fall that when committed when man
[49:42] committed
[49:45] sin man had to be bought
[49:48] back man had to be redeemed and to
[49:50] redeem a
[49:53] man God had to identify what value was
[49:57] to be to attribute to
[50:00] him for him to redeem that
[50:03] man so he can redeem
[50:07] me go God didn't find anything that
[50:10] could
[50:12] match than his own
[50:17] blood that the value of a
[50:20] Christian that's the value of a son of
[50:23] God
[50:26] that if I can give a dollar to get this
[50:28] bottle of
[50:33] water it means for me I need this Bott
[50:36] of water more than the dollar that I
[50:40] have that when God spilled his own
[50:43] blood to redeem
[50:47] me it's because he found out that I had
[50:50] more
[50:52] value than the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:59] and sometimes we
[51:01] walk without identifying or recognizing
[51:04] our
[51:07] value and that's some that's why
[51:09] sometimes when we do
[51:12] things that we should not be doing as
[51:14] sons of
[51:17] God is because we don't recognize that
[51:20] value it's like a child three years
[51:24] old if you take a threey old old child
[51:28] or two years
[51:29] old you take a a bill a $100 bill you
[51:35] take it and you fold
[51:37] it or you put it in the uh
[51:43] dirt and you take a a$1
[51:47] bill clean you put the two
[51:52] together a two-year old child will take
[51:55] $1
[51:57] but I don't
[51:58] believe that any of you here that if we
[52:02] do the same thing you're going to take
[52:05] that
[52:05] $1
[52:08] why because this bill a $100
[52:11] bill even if it's
[52:15] folded has not lost its value of
[52:19] $100 means a Son of
[52:22] God even if it's folded up
[52:26] if he was known before by
[52:29] God he doesn't lose his
[52:34] value the only thing that
[52:38] does is to come back
[52:41] clean so he could be used as a $100
[52:46] bill but he's not going to underestimate
[52:51] himself he's not going to tell himself I
[52:53] don't have any more value
[52:56] you cannot be a Son of God
[52:59] today and not be a Son of God
[53:04] tomorrow your value is to remain a Son
[53:07] of
[53:08] God and that's why as a Son of
[53:12] God as David would
[53:15] say I constantly put the Lord before
[53:19] me whereever I
[53:22] go regardless of the circumstance that
[53:25] comes before me
[53:27] I am a Son of
[53:29] God can I do this I'm a I'm a daughter
[53:33] of God is this something I can do this
[53:37] is not for me because I'm a Son of God
[53:41] because I'm a daughter of
[53:44] God and when I was thinking about
[53:49] it I came back to this scripture of the
[53:52] genealogy of Jesus Christ
[53:57] you know when they talk about a a a
[53:58] story of a
[54:02] family they speak they talk about the
[54:05] father and the
[54:07] mother they speak about the man and the
[54:12] woman but mostly when you speak about
[54:14] the
[54:15] genealogy especially in the
[54:18] Bible they only speak about
[54:22] men they say this man beg got that man
[54:26] this man we got that that other
[54:29] man but when you read the genealogy of
[54:32] Jesus
[54:34] Christ they they call about five
[54:40] women and we're going to look at the
[54:42] story of this five
[54:45] women the first woman that the Bible
[54:48] talks about is Tamar
[54:56] the Bible says in verse
[54:58] three MTH of Matthew chapter
[55:14] 1 verse
[55:20] three Tamar that Judah begat feris and
[55:24] Zarah of Tamar
[55:29] and
[55:32] Tamar and the story of Tamar we find it
[55:35] in Genesis chapter uh
[55:41] 38 uh uh Tamar was uh uh judah's
[55:52] daughter-in-law the Tamar was the the
[55:55] the wife of the son of Judah called
[56:00] a and when a was he was evil before
[56:05] God God took
[56:09] him and Judah took
[56:13] Tamar he gave him to his second son who
[56:16] was called
[56:20] Omar your brother has died had not uh uh
[56:24] uh left any uh uh seed
[56:28] take the the the your brother's
[56:32] wife so you can bring up a seed for your
[56:37] brother but when Onan went to to
[56:43] Tamar he didn't want to leave a seed to
[56:47] Tamar and it didn't please
[56:50] God and God took
[56:55] Onan and and Judah and Judah had a
[56:58] younger
[57:02] son and he he he he he he was afraid to
[57:06] give terar to
[57:09] Shannon he was afraid that he was going
[57:11] to
[57:12] die that he may lose all his three
[57:15] sons he asked
[57:18] Tamar he said go back to your the
[57:22] family that this the time that Shen will
[57:25] grow up
[57:27] when shanon will be
[57:30] older he will take you as a
[57:34] wife Tamma went back to his family her
[57:39] family and she waited
[57:41] there sh grow
[57:45] up but they never wanted to give him as
[57:48] a
[57:49] husband and Judah lost his
[57:54] wife and after he lost his
[57:59] wife uh one day he decided to go and
[58:02] take care of his
[58:04] sheep at in a place called
[58:07] timna with one of his
[58:11] friends and people told
[58:16] himar look at your father-in-law he's
[58:18] going to a place called
[58:21] timna and T Tamar took all to she took
[58:25] off her uh widower
[58:29] clothes and she dressed herself as a
[58:35] prostitute and she went on the road by
[58:38] which Judah was going to pass
[58:40] by and when Judah came by
[58:44] there he was attracted by this
[58:47] prostitute and because Tamar was
[58:51] covered he didn't know that this was
[58:54] Tamar and he asked
[58:57] can I go with
[58:59] you the Tamar ask what are you going to
[59:02] give
[59:03] me he said well when I
[59:07] go I will send you a little
[59:14] H lamb
[59:22] okay but Tamar requested and said but
[59:25] what are you going to give me now as a
[59:30] guarantee he said what do you
[59:32] want he said I want you to give me your
[59:35] your steak your the Signet your your
[59:38] your seal
[59:41] yes your
[59:43] Signet I want you to give me either a
[59:47] bracelet and I want you to give me
[59:50] your and Judah went and he left the
[59:53] signant he left the the the the stick
[59:55] that he was was walking
[59:57] with and he went with
[1:00:00] Tamar and he went went his
[1:00:07] way and then the next day he took what
[1:00:10] he promised to Tamar the little animal
[1:00:12] and gave to his friend he said go give
[1:00:15] this to the
[1:00:16] prostitute and when his friend came
[1:00:19] there were no prostitute
[1:00:22] anymore and he asked questions
[1:00:26] oh there's never been a prostitute
[1:00:28] here so he went back to
[1:00:33] Judah J said well we cannot make any
[1:00:36] noise otherwise we're going to be
[1:00:38] ridicu let's just wait let's just keep
[1:00:42] quiet now when Tamar went back to her
[1:00:45] place she realized she was
[1:00:51] pregnant and people realized that Tamar
[1:00:54] was pregnant
[1:00:56] uh uh three months
[1:00:59] later they send a message to
[1:01:03] Judah that behold your daughter-in-law
[1:01:06] is
[1:01:08] pregnant she she was she prostituted
[1:01:12] herself and she became
[1:01:17] pregnant and Judah gave an instruction
[1:01:19] that she may be taken outside of a city
[1:01:21] where she could be
[1:01:23] stoned and they took that prostitute
[1:01:27] so they can go and burn her outside of
[1:01:29] the
[1:01:31] city the Tamar took the
[1:01:33] stick she took the bracelet she took the
[1:01:37] the the the
[1:01:39] stick she said before you can burn
[1:01:44] me I want you to go show these things to
[1:01:47] Judah tell
[1:01:50] him so if he can recognize who does this
[1:01:53] thing belong
[1:01:54] to at that time they can burn me after
[1:02:01] that and when Judah looks at
[1:02:04] it he said I am the one who's
[1:02:07] guilty because after that
[1:02:11] pregnancy they came
[1:02:15] Faris and Zarah and
[1:02:20] Zarah that's what Tamar was that's the
[1:02:23] story of Tamar
[1:02:26] who's in the genealogy of Jesus
[1:02:32] Christ to whom
[1:02:35] God gave
[1:02:38] value to be in the genealogy of Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ a woman who became prostitute to
[1:02:48] go out with his father-in-law
[1:02:56] certainly there were uh uh good women in
[1:02:59] the genealogy of Jesus
[1:03:03] Christ that are not inserted in this
[1:03:06] genealogy but
[1:03:10] Tamar God found out that the value of
[1:03:17] Tamar needed to be inserted in the
[1:03:20] genealogy of Jesus Christ so it means
[1:03:23] regardless of what your story is
[1:03:27] regardless of what your pass
[1:03:29] is regardless of what people are saying
[1:03:32] about
[1:03:34] you regardless of what the devil is
[1:03:37] reminding
[1:03:39] you if God has placed his seed on you in
[1:03:45] you he's giving you
[1:03:48] value he's giving you your value in
[1:03:52] Christ
[1:03:57] from
[1:03:59] Tamar Judah had
[1:04:03] phis and feris five generations
[1:04:09] later he had
[1:04:13] Salon a great General in the army of
[1:04:19] Israel who brought the uh uh the the the
[1:04:22] the the the battle ofan battle to the
[1:04:25] Army of
[1:04:29] Jericho and when they got Jericho
[1:04:35] back from whom did Salomon fall in love
[1:04:41] with
[1:04:43] Ahab the
[1:04:46] prostitute that's what the Bible calls
[1:04:49] her Ahab the
[1:04:53] prostitute and she's in the Gen ology of
[1:05:00] Jesus God gave
[1:05:03] value
[1:05:07] Rahab she was not even of
[1:05:11] Israel she was of
[1:05:16] Jericho Rahab was a
[1:05:22] prostitute rejected from the people of
[1:05:24] Jericho
[1:05:28] but Rahab had an understanding of what
[1:05:31] was happening in
[1:05:34] Israel Rahab believed the god of
[1:05:39] Israel when the spies come came into
[1:05:46] Jericho RAB identified that there were
[1:05:49] people of
[1:05:51] Israel it said it's those people that
[1:05:54] have the truth
[1:05:58] it it's those people that have the true
[1:06:02] God we have heard the testimonies of
[1:06:05] that
[1:06:07] God it's true that I'm a
[1:06:10] prostitute but that
[1:06:12] God and I I I know I have to follow
[1:06:18] him Raab she helped those spies to to
[1:06:23] hide
[1:06:27] and when Rahab helped those spies to
[1:06:31] hide as those spies were about to
[1:06:34] go RAB told
[1:06:37] them I know the testimony of thy
[1:06:41] God I know that your God is
[1:06:44] great I want to follow that
[1:06:47] God uh promise
[1:06:50] me that when you will come into Jericho
[1:06:57] not only you will save me and my
[1:07:02] family but you will make me a part of
[1:07:08] you Raab didn't look at a situation as a
[1:07:12] PR but she
[1:07:15] believed that she could be part of that
[1:07:19] people that was serving a true
[1:07:22] God that was serving a true God
[1:07:27] that was serving a powerful
[1:07:30] God
[1:07:32] RAB the
[1:07:35] prostitute in the genealogy of Jesus
[1:07:39] Christ God gave him value give her
[1:07:43] value
[1:07:46] says in the message uh uh why why the
[1:07:50] little battle Bethlehem
[1:08:03] 49 we find out that it was also become
[1:08:06] the home of the Harlot
[1:08:11] Rahab when Israel had passed over the
[1:08:14] borderline of Jordan
[1:08:18] River into
[1:08:21] Palestine we are acquainted with the
[1:08:23] story of Rahab the hared
[1:08:29] let's picture her this morning for a few
[1:08:32] minutes a young
[1:08:35] lady a beautiful young a beautiful young
[1:08:44] woman who some Misfortune in in life had
[1:08:48] had been
[1:08:51] forced being a pagan
[1:08:57] had been forced into the life that she
[1:08:59] was
[1:09:02] living and many times people are forced
[1:09:05] into the life that they
[1:09:08] live like
[1:09:13] Rahab we are certainly have come across
[1:09:18] things we have certainly find ourselves
[1:09:20] in certain
[1:09:24] circumstances because we were pressed
[1:09:26] and forced into those
[1:09:29] circumstances but
[1:09:39] Rahab um I was in the prison the other
[1:09:42] night to see a man who was uh uh uh
[1:09:44] taking a
[1:09:47] sentence I took him by the hand and I
[1:09:50] talked to him and I
[1:09:52] said why would you do such a thing as
[1:09:55] that
[1:10:01] and holding me by the hand he began to
[1:10:06] speak he was forced into what he was
[1:10:10] doing I
[1:10:14] said because that you permitted that to
[1:10:18] force you to
[1:10:21] that you don't have to do that
[1:10:25] you no man has to
[1:10:32] drink I said I'm nervous myself but
[1:10:35] there's no need of
[1:10:38] that and this young
[1:10:42] woman after she had gotten her first
[1:10:45] hearing of
[1:10:49] Israel it's like many of us that have
[1:10:52] heard talk about the message for the
[1:10:53] first time
[1:10:58] and of a God who was a a God that
[1:11:01] answers prayer that answered
[1:11:05] prayer not only a God to pray to but a
[1:11:09] God that answered
[1:11:15] back when she heard that there was a god
[1:11:18] of
[1:11:20] Miracles who could perform miracles
[1:11:26] who dried up the Seas and Rain bread out
[1:11:29] of out of the
[1:11:31] heavens her heart began to
[1:11:36] tremble and when she got the first
[1:11:39] message from the two preachers that went
[1:11:42] over went
[1:11:46] over quickly she accepted it with all
[1:11:50] her
[1:11:51] heart she was a
[1:11:54] prostitute but when these two
[1:11:58] preachers they began to preach about the
[1:12:00] God of
[1:12:02] Israel she was she accepted it with all
[1:12:05] her
[1:12:07] heart she accepted it with all her
[1:12:12] heart and there was a Scarlet C cord
[1:12:16] bound to her
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:21] window for a protection of her house
[1:12:25] because she had received the
[1:12:31] message and and if God has that made of
[1:12:34] Rahab a
[1:12:38] prostitute as soon as she she had re
[1:12:41] heard the
[1:12:43] message as soon as she had believed the
[1:12:48] message and she read as a son as a a
[1:12:52] daughter of God and the pur Contin ahe
[1:12:55] she can no longer continue to be a
[1:13:00] prostitute she had believed with all her
[1:13:05] heart and we
[1:13:09] know that when you
[1:13:14] repent God doesn't only forgive
[1:13:18] you but he also justifies
[1:13:22] you so when they wrote the genealogy of
[1:13:26] Jesus
[1:13:28] Christ God forgot that Rahab was a
[1:13:34] prostitute as as long as God is
[1:13:37] concerned Rahab was never a
[1:13:41] prostitute God forgot
[1:13:45] it but when I'm told about a
[1:13:52] story uh there was a old man who was a
[1:13:55] uh uh he was
[1:13:57] holy who really like reading his
[1:14:01] Bible and often time when he was reading
[1:14:03] his Bible oh he was getting really happy
[1:14:06] he would scream he he would just scream
[1:14:09] out he would scream
[1:14:14] Allelujah and he went to visit a
[1:14:16] daughter who was living in a
[1:14:19] city where before she was a good
[1:14:24] Christian but because of the environment
[1:14:26] and of the
[1:14:29] friendships the the her friends cause
[1:14:31] her to forget her
[1:14:33] value of a real daughter of
[1:14:37] God to say that your
[1:14:39] value is to be like this in
[1:14:43] society is to do this in
[1:14:48] society and one day her daughter she uh
[1:14:51] the daughter organized a a party with
[1:14:54] her friends
[1:14:57] and she knew that if he if she left the
[1:15:00] dad the dad with the
[1:15:02] Bible he's going to mess up the
[1:15:06] party so he told the the
[1:15:09] dad you know
[1:15:11] Dad it's just a a you know conversation
[1:15:15] between
[1:15:16] friends with a young with between
[1:15:20] girls if you stay there it's not going
[1:15:23] to be comfortable for you
[1:15:25] what I'm
[1:15:26] proposing is for you to go
[1:15:30] upstairs and when we finish you can
[1:15:32] maybe come
[1:15:34] downstairs and when because I know you
[1:15:36] like to

[1:15:42] it she took a a geography book he gave
[1:15:46] it Dad he said you know you know read a
[1:15:49] little bit about
[1:15:52] geography and you kind of know you know
[1:15:54] what's going on in the
[1:15:56] world the dad said okay it's no problem
[1:15:59] uh thank you my
[1:16:01] daughter and he took the book of
[1:16:04] geography and as he was
[1:16:06] upstairs just few moments L Hallelujah
[1:16:10] glory to God hallelujah
[1:16:14] hallelujah the daughter said what Dad
[1:16:17] what's going on it's not the Bible it's
[1:16:21] geography yes he said yes yes my
[1:16:25] daughter he said it's geography he said
[1:16:27] look here in this book of geography they
[1:16:31] say that in the
[1:16:33] ocean there's
[1:16:35] places where they can't even find the
[1:16:38] depths of it and yesterday I was reading
[1:16:42] in the Bible that my
[1:16:44] sins they were sending the sin of
[1:16:48] forgetfulness so my sins they went in
[1:16:53] the place where they cannot find them
[1:16:58] he found God in
[1:17:03] geography
[1:17:06] Rahab so her sins were
[1:17:10] forgiven and she was
[1:17:12] justified and
[1:17:19] says it says I might add here paragraph
[1:17:23] 52
[1:17:30] did you know she was a type of the
[1:17:33] Gentile
[1:17:34] Church she was a
[1:17:37] gentile and she was a type of the
[1:17:40] Gentile
[1:17:42] church when they heard the
[1:17:48] message we were all out in spiritual
[1:17:51] prostitution
[1:17:56] committing spiritual fornication against
[1:17:58] the god of
[1:18:00] Heaven in all kinds of stuff in all
[1:18:04] kinds of denominations and
[1:18:08] religions but when we heard that there
[1:18:11] was a
[1:18:13] god there was a God that still
[1:18:17] lived that could perform
[1:18:21] Miracles quickly we received the message
[1:18:27] there
[1:18:28] was there was a there was it was at that
[1:18:33] time that was applied the blood of the
[1:18:36] Lord
[1:18:39] Jesus when we heard the
[1:18:43] message we took the
[1:18:46] decision when we recognize our
[1:18:50] value regardless of what we were
[1:18:55] we take we make a
[1:18:57] decision we we take the
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:02] engagement to walk according to our
[1:19:06] [Music]
[1:19:07] value if my value says I'm a Son of God
[1:19:11] I cannot
[1:19:13] lie oh God keep me from
[1:19:19] lies if my value says that I'm a Son of
[1:19:22] God and I cannot smoke
[1:19:25] oh Lord I know yesterday I
[1:19:27] smoked but now you're telling me that
[1:19:31] I'm a Son of God forgive me I will not
[1:19:35] do it
[1:19:38] anymore
[1:19:40] Rahab The
[1:19:43] Prostitute
[1:19:44] God allow that she may be in the
[1:19:47] genealogy of
[1:19:51] Jesus but says a lot of things about
[1:19:55] RAB her faith deis her
[1:20:03] decision and salmon had
[1:20:11] Boaz and boas took a a girl or woman in
[1:20:16] this that we call
[1:20:18] ruthu Ruth the
[1:20:22] moabit the just the fact of you being
[1:20:26] called a
[1:20:32] moabit it already means that you came
[1:20:35] from the the incess relationship between
[1:20:37] lot and his children and the daughter
[1:20:40] that those are the
[1:20:43] moabites because it was when lot went in
[1:20:45] with his wife that's when the moabit
[1:20:48] came Ruth the
[1:20:51] moabit ruab Ruth the
[1:20:56] moabit when Naomi went to
[1:21:00] Moab with with the with the the children
[1:21:03] that were
[1:21:05] young I'm sorry and because they were
[1:21:09] young they grew up
[1:21:12] there they they married the the moabit
[1:21:16] daughters and the two boys they marry
[1:21:19] Ora and Ruth
[1:21:25] the the husband of Naomi
[1:21:28] died the two children of of Naomi
[1:21:34] died Naomi makes a decision to go back
[1:21:37] to
[1:21:44] Israel but because these two daughters
[1:21:47] uh uh uh Ruth and orpa were already part
[1:21:51] of the Israel family
[1:21:57] and they knew about the God of
[1:22:00] Israel they knew the
[1:22:04] message they had believed the
[1:22:09] message and when Naomi decides to go
[1:22:13] back he said I'm going
[1:22:18] back I'm going to go back to practice My
[1:22:21] Religion uh uh in peace oh
[1:22:25] orer
[1:22:29] said it says well it's true that I went
[1:22:32] to a church
[1:22:33] message but
[1:22:36] uh but now they're giving me an
[1:22:39] opportunity to do whatever I
[1:22:41] want I I think I will not go on anymore
[1:22:45] no I
[1:22:46] won't but
[1:22:49] Ruth she said what I read about the
[1:22:51] message
[1:22:54] cannot remain here
[1:22:58] myself and believe that you're going to
[1:23:00] go back to a message
[1:23:02] Church wherever you go I will go where
[1:23:07] you will die I will
[1:23:12] die look at this moabit that finds
[1:23:16] herself in
[1:23:18] Israel she was Moab
[1:23:27] one who came from the ancestral
[1:23:30] relationship but she finds herself in
[1:23:34] Israel practicing the religion of
[1:23:38] Israel she came came she came in the
[1:23:44] message and who's taken a decision to
[1:23:47] follow the message in the in its
[1:23:52] entirety and from there
[1:23:57] we understand boas came and exercises
[1:24:00] the law of
[1:24:05] Kingsman to whom even God has allowed
[1:24:08] that the whole
[1:24:11] book may be written about her in the
[1:24:15] Bible a
[1:24:19] moabit God never looked at her past
[1:24:25] God looked at the value of
[1:24:30] Ruth God looked at the decision that
[1:24:33] root
[1:24:35] made God looked at the engagement that
[1:24:38] root
[1:24:42] made God placed the real value of what
[1:24:46] Ruth was in the
[1:24:50] genealogy the next woman in this
[1:24:52] genealogy
[1:24:54] the fourth woman was
[1:24:57] BBA the the the wife of
[1:25:03] Uriah the one that husband she got the
[1:25:06] husband got
[1:25:09] killed adulterous
[1:25:11] woman and she caused the husband to be
[1:25:15] killed but she's in
[1:25:18] genealogy of
[1:25:22] Jesus BBA
[1:25:25] that uh David came and and and and uh
[1:25:29] lasted
[1:25:31] upon David came and committed adultery
[1:25:35] with
[1:25:40] her trying to cover it by calling back
[1:25:43] Uriah and having him to go to his wife
[1:25:45] and because she was already
[1:25:49] pregnant but a true Soldier saying that
[1:25:52] others are dying over there the
[1:25:55] battle I'm not going to go with in my
[1:25:58] house and and and and and with my wife
[1:26:02] my place is over there at the
[1:26:03] battlefield I'm going to go fight for my
[1:26:06] nation and because David had no
[1:26:10] choice he asked the commander of the
[1:26:15] army that you may Place him where the
[1:26:17] battle is really
[1:26:19] raging
[1:26:21] where where there's no place to hide on
[1:26:23] the no place to
[1:26:26] run and that's what was done and Uriah
[1:26:28] was was
[1:26:34] killed and that's how David got
[1:26:38] BBA and from Bela Kim
[1:26:43] Salomon and the last woman in this
[1:26:47] genealogy is
[1:26:50] Mary this young woman
[1:26:55] you know today we can believe the
[1:26:57] history but in the time of
[1:27:00] Jesus a young woman
[1:27:03] comes he said I never touch a man but
[1:27:06] I'm I'm
[1:27:07] pregnant and it's the Holy
[1:27:13] Spirit how she was made fun
[1:27:19] of that she was a liar
[1:27:26] that's the the eye the look of of of of
[1:27:29] of
[1:27:30] man but the value of
[1:27:34] God the angel told
[1:27:36] Mary that you found
[1:27:42] Grace
[1:27:44] says uh in Mary's
[1:27:50] belief paragraph uh paragraph 11
[1:27:58] and as she moved along she raised up her
[1:28:00] head
[1:28:02] again it they stood this great
[1:28:05] light in in before
[1:28:10] her perhaps the same pillow of fire that
[1:28:12] led the children of
[1:28:15] Israel came walking from the light that
[1:28:19] great Archangel Gabriel
[1:28:23] Gabriel and he
[1:28:26] said Hail
[1:28:28] Mary means stop
[1:28:32] blessed blessed are thou among among the
[1:28:40] women how to tell the other woman went
[1:28:42] to the well that
[1:28:46] morning perhaps thinking about the
[1:28:48] washing that they had to
[1:28:50] do or some task
[1:28:55] or some Society some Society in the
[1:28:58] church they had to take care
[1:29:01] of but Mary was thinking on the
[1:29:13] scriptures was not it cleopas and his
[1:29:15] friend on the first Easter morning as
[1:29:18] they were thinking on the scripture when
[1:29:19] Jesus appeared to them
[1:29:25] and as they saw this great Angel it SLE
[1:29:29] this little
[1:29:31] virgin she stopped and she
[1:29:34] stopped and he came closer to her and
[1:29:37] saluted
[1:29:39] her and gave her a
[1:29:43] message that was a hard message to
[1:29:46] believe the hard message for this child
[1:29:50] to
[1:29:52] believe for she was nothing but a
[1:29:57] girl he gave her something to
[1:30:06] believe that was more outstanding and
[1:30:09] hard to believe than anything that's
[1:30:11] ever given to
[1:30:14] anyone it was hard to
[1:30:18] believe this message that was given to
[1:30:21] Mary and explain months
[1:30:26] before God the the the angel came to
[1:30:30] Zachariah he was who was a a a priest or
[1:30:35] a high
[1:30:37] priest who knew the
[1:30:43] scripture the angel gave the same
[1:30:45] message to
[1:30:47] Zachariah that the wife who was a
[1:30:51] Barren was to have a child
[1:30:56] when there've been testimonies in the
[1:30:58] past there was
[1:31:00] Sarah there was
[1:31:02] Elizabeth there was
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:08] Anna
[1:31:10] Zariah ask a question to the
[1:31:14] angel how can that be how can I
[1:31:16] recognize
[1:31:17] that the angel looked at him and says
[1:31:21] unbeliever you're going to become a m
[1:31:26] I will open your
[1:31:29] mouth just so you can go and pronounce
[1:31:31] the name of John that I have given
[1:31:34] you but the same message was given to
[1:31:37] this young
[1:31:38] girl I had no testimony of anything like
[1:31:42] that ever
[1:31:43] happening she said Let It Be according
[1:31:46] to your word
[1:31:49] yes when the message is preached
[1:31:55] God wants us to have the same
[1:31:57] disposition as
[1:31:59] Mary here's your your your
[1:32:03] handmade I'm going to go in the middle
[1:32:05] of the
[1:32:07] paragraph paragraph
[1:32:15] 12 how shall it be my
[1:32:17] Lord the the angel
[1:32:21] said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow
[1:32:27] and the holy thing that be born from you
[1:32:30] will be called The Son of God it says
[1:32:33] watch
[1:32:34] her she didn't question that she
[1:32:38] said behold the handmade of the
[1:32:42] Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[1:32:46] word it says if we could just do
[1:32:50] that that's the only thing that's the
[1:32:53] only thing
[1:32:55] that's what God
[1:32:58] loves that's the only way to get right
[1:33:01] with
[1:33:02] God is take him at his
[1:33:06] word that's the only way that there is
[1:33:09] to please
[1:33:11] God take his
[1:33:14] word don't trust your
[1:33:17] knowledge you will reason your value is
[1:33:20] not in your your knowledge
[1:33:23] your
[1:33:28] reason how can it be done it cannot be
[1:33:32] done when you
[1:33:35] reason then you lose the
[1:33:39] victory we must cast down
[1:33:45] reasoning and believe what God said to
[1:33:48] be the
[1:33:52] truth God said that your value is in
[1:33:55] Jesus
[1:33:57] Christ that you are more valuable than
[1:34:00] his own
[1:34:01] blood that he he spilled his own blood
[1:34:04] so he can redeem
[1:34:06] you that you are son and a daughter of
[1:34:09] God that's what God
[1:34:13] said that's the value that God is
[1:34:16] attributing to
[1:34:19] you don't consider the value that the
[1:34:22] world is giv you
[1:34:27] I'm going to skip some things to go to
[1:34:28] the
[1:34:29] end our
[1:34:34] value
[1:34:36] come like Tamar come like
[1:34:41] Rahab like
[1:34:43] BBA come Ruth like
[1:34:49] Ruth when we come into
[1:34:52] Christ our true
[1:34:55] value is Romans
[1:34:58] 10
[1:35:00] now it's what Roman said now there are
[1:35:03] no longer there's no
[1:35:06] condemnation to them that are in
[1:35:12] Christ now we are recognizing our true
[1:35:18] value there are there is no therefore no
[1:35:21] condemnation
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:27] there is not one thing that's supposed
[1:35:29] to condemn a Son of
[1:35:31] God
[1:35:33] ites that you're going to behave as a
[1:35:37] pagan and say that there are no
[1:35:41] condemnation there's no
[1:35:45] condemnation it means that you are no
[1:35:47] longer living according to the flesh but
[1:35:50] you are living according to the spirit
[1:35:53] and your
[1:35:55] walk it says holy holy holy be the
[1:36:02] Lord and your your walk is now in
[1:36:08] Holiness and you constantly put the word
[1:36:11] before
[1:36:13] you and everything that presents itself
[1:36:16] before
[1:36:18] you so that nothing brings you into
[1:36:21] condemnation
[1:36:24] and you remain a Son of
[1:36:30] God and that's what God wants for each
[1:36:32] one of
[1:36:34] us he says we have the value and our
[1:36:38] value in Christ is in
[1:36:43] Christ that when we we get that we may
[1:36:46] get into
[1:36:49] Christ that we may abide in Christ
[1:36:54] it says if you if you abide in
[1:36:57] me and my words abide in
[1:37:01] you ask what you
[1:37:06] will and when we abide in
[1:37:10] Christ and his word abide in
[1:37:14] us he forgets our
[1:37:17] past he gives us a
[1:37:20] ticket to get into ware in his
[1:37:25] Warehouse where the everything where
[1:37:27] there's
[1:37:29] everything it says you have h h h you
[1:37:32] have a free
[1:37:34] access whatever you
[1:37:39] want whatever the only
[1:37:42] thing remain in Christ remain in
[1:37:46] me abide in me then you have your true
[1:37:52] value and there you can have access to
[1:37:55] everything that you have need
[1:38:01] of many times we we don't recognize our
[1:38:07] value that's when we think our God is
[1:38:11] limited he has never been
[1:38:15] limited he's capable of
[1:38:22] everything and he said says that he
[1:38:24] gives us everything that we
[1:38:28] ask and the scripture says we don't
[1:38:32] receive because we don't
[1:38:34] ask and we don't ask is because we don't
[1:38:40] believe is because we don't recognize
[1:38:43] our
[1:38:46] value we don't recognize that we are
[1:38:48] Sons and Daughters of
[1:38:51] God that everything that belongs to to
[1:38:54] God belongs to
[1:38:58] us he says that we are uh uh uh air with
[1:39:05] Jesus that everything that Jesus
[1:39:09] inherited we have P it's also our
[1:39:12] portion we have a part in
[1:39:14] that and that's our
[1:39:18] value as we we would stand
[1:39:22] tonight my brother my
[1:39:26] sister our value is not in what we
[1:39:29] possess in this
[1:39:32] world it's not what what the world says
[1:39:34] of
[1:39:36] us it's not in what the world think of
[1:39:41] us it's not in what the world says about
[1:39:50] us imagine the testimony that people
[1:39:53] will tell in the days of
[1:39:58] Tamar H imagine the testimony that was
[1:40:01] told of
[1:40:04] Rahab how what to say about
[1:40:10] belba but the true value is in
[1:40:14] Christ look at that
[1:40:18] day Jesus went to
[1:40:21] Simon he was invited at Simon's
[1:40:27] place a a a great high
[1:40:31] priest with the uh the guesses that knew
[1:40:35] what the scriptures
[1:40:38] were but none of them knew the value of
[1:40:41] Jesus
[1:40:43] Christ Jesus got into Simon's
[1:40:46] house nobody washed his
[1:40:49] feet nobody paid attention to him they
[1:40:53] put him at the
[1:40:55] corner and there was a
[1:40:58] prostitute a a woman of a bad life who
[1:41:02] was coming was coming
[1:41:06] by perhaps she saw a lot of horses and a
[1:41:09] lot of Chariot and things
[1:41:12] around he said oh what a great feast
[1:41:15] around here what's going
[1:41:19] on she probably try to look across the
[1:41:22] door
[1:41:26] she saw people that were well
[1:41:29] dressed but at the
[1:41:33] corner they they there was someone who
[1:41:36] looked like it was being
[1:41:38] neglected someone with no
[1:41:41] value she was a
[1:41:43] prostitute but there was a seed in her
[1:41:47] there was something in
[1:41:48] her and that thing told her but that one
[1:41:55] but he the one that John said is the
[1:41:56] Lamb of God that takes away the sins of
[1:41:59] the
[1:42:00] world but how come all these
[1:42:03] people they cannot recognize his
[1:42:06] value how can they leave him in that
[1:42:09] condition oh can I do
[1:42:12] something I know I'm a prostitute
[1:42:16] true but can I give get a possibility
[1:42:19] away for me to get in what can I do
[1:42:25] he said I will try to do
[1:42:28] something I have decided to do
[1:42:34] something I believe that I'll will crost
[1:42:36] all the obstacles so I can get to
[1:42:38] him because his
[1:42:41] value it doesn't Merit what they are
[1:42:44] doing to
[1:42:45] him the value of this
[1:42:49] message it's not what people are
[1:42:51] thinking of this message
[1:42:53] I have to get access to that
[1:42:57] message she
[1:42:59] went she went and bought a per a perfume
[1:43:02] of of a great
[1:43:05] price she came and she fulfilled herself
[1:43:08] and find a way out
[1:43:11] around maybe those that were at their
[1:43:13] door try to stop
[1:43:16] her but when God has placed something in
[1:43:20] you and you have taken the decision to
[1:43:23] go to the
[1:43:26] word God Will Make A Way to create the
[1:43:29] way for
[1:43:31] you so you can get access to the
[1:43:35] word and she came around
[1:43:38] it she found herself at the feet of
[1:43:43] Jesus Oh perhaps when she was going
[1:43:46] around to get to
[1:43:48] Jesus there was probably a God who tried
[1:43:51] to stop her some tell him no don't touch
[1:43:55] him oh because she's a prostitute she's
[1:43:58] going to go to Jesus Let's Go Let Her Go
[1:44:01] and let's see what he's going to do
[1:44:02] let's see what he's going to do he's a
[1:44:05] prostitute you know in every
[1:44:10] way he's there to be
[1:44:13] ridicul so if we give him a
[1:44:16] prostitute there's nothing
[1:44:19] wrong let her
[1:44:21] go she came to the feet of
[1:44:23] Jesus she was no longer a prostitute
[1:44:26] when she got there she went to her
[1:44:29] knees and she started
[1:44:31] repenting she started
[1:44:34] crying she started
[1:44:36] crying with her tears she started
[1:44:40] washing his
[1:44:43] feet she took what she had the most
[1:44:46] precious she took and she started wiping
[1:44:49] the feet to
[1:44:50] Jesus and the Pharisees were looking
[1:44:54] they were saying in their
[1:44:56] heart oh he doesn't know that she's a
[1:44:59] prostitute
[1:45:01] can and in front of
[1:45:03] people and he calls himself a
[1:45:09] prophet Jesus who was Discerning the
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] thoughts he knew what Simon was saying
[1:45:15] in
[1:45:16] himself he said Simon
[1:45:20] Simon there was a man
[1:45:26] a man who had two people that owed
[1:45:31] him there was one who owed him
[1:45:35] $5,000 and there was another one who
[1:45:37] owed him
[1:45:41] $50 because the two didn't have the
[1:45:43] means by which to pay the
[1:45:47] debt he decided to forgive them of their
[1:45:50] debt
[1:45:55] he said which of them you think will
[1:45:57] would have been more
[1:46:03] appreciative they said certainly the one
[1:46:06] who owed
[1:46:09] 5,000 I said I came to your
[1:46:13] house you didn't watch my
[1:46:18] feet you didn't pay attention to
[1:46:21] me but look at this
[1:46:25] woman that you know as you're
[1:46:29] thinking she was a
[1:46:33] prostitute but because of what she had
[1:46:36] done her many
[1:46:38] sins has been
[1:46:45] forgiven and as that woman was leaving
[1:46:48] that
[1:46:50] place as far as Jesus is concerned
[1:46:53] she would never been a prostitute to
[1:46:55] begin with
[1:47:01] never in
[1:47:05] Christ this prostitute came to her True
[1:47:11] Value if we were to tell a testimony
[1:47:15] today we'll never say she's a
[1:47:21] prostitute thank
[1:47:23] let's bow our
[1:47:27] heads God our heavenly
[1:47:34] father with the pressure of this
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:42] world we were in certain things
[1:47:49] horrible forgetting our true value
[1:47:56] but we believe
[1:48:00] Lord that in you we have our true
[1:48:06] value that we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:48:10] God we are you

[1:48:38] each one of your
[1:48:40] children fill each one of your children

[1:53:30] value your your values in your
[1:53:34] identification we want to identify
[1:53:36] oursel by our
[1:53:39] occupation just as you look in the
[1:53:41] scripture well this is what they did for
[1:53:42] a
[1:53:43] living well that wasn't her
[1:53:46] identification she found her
[1:53:48] identification when she came to
[1:53:51] Christ Maybe there's somebody here
[1:53:53] you're still struggling with your
[1:53:54] identification you're still identifying
[1:53:56] with the things of the world
[1:54:00] and you see that you're doing things you
[1:54:03] you still shouldn't do and you're still
[1:54:04] wrestling with
[1:54:07] things I believe you're you're still
[1:54:10] struggling with who you really are in
[1:54:13] Christ don't go don't go from
[1:54:15] [Music]
[1:54:17] here the same let them change
[1:54:20] you let them do with your heart but why
[1:54:23] don't you be like that one that came and
[1:54:25] washed jesus'
[1:54:27] feet you keep looking at your past and
[1:54:29] what you did and all your mistakes and
[1:54:32] all your failures and and that's how you
[1:54:34] impute value to
[1:54:36] yourself you say well I did this and I'm
[1:54:39] not worthy I should have never done that
[1:54:41] and I've already been baptized and I
[1:54:44] I've told people I had the Holy Ghost
[1:54:46] and then I I fail to this sin and and
[1:54:49] and now what what are people going to
[1:54:50] think of me don't worry about what
[1:54:52] people think about you what does he
[1:54:54] think about
[1:54:55] you why don't you just wash his feet
[1:54:58] right take a little time
[1:54:59] tonight say Lord I love you yes because
[1:55:03] you first loved me and done a lot of
[1:55:06] things that I shouldn't have done Lord
[1:55:08] but you're telling me that's my not my
[1:55:10] identification that my identification is
[1:55:12] in
[1:55:14] you you the prophet of God said it's
[1:55:16] like taking a a pocket full of
[1:55:19] coins he grab a a bunch of coins and in
[1:55:22] there you got pennies and nickels and
[1:55:25] dimes and quarters and half
[1:55:28] dollars said that's how the world is
[1:55:31] some people can only give a
[1:55:33] penny God can only use them in a penny
[1:55:35] way some can only use them in a nickel
[1:55:37] way and and there we go with our carnal
[1:55:40] mind well I'm probably just a
[1:55:42] nickel I'm probably just a penny no God
[1:55:45] said lot was a penny but
[1:55:48] Abraham was a silver
[1:55:50] dollar and Paul said Galatians he said
[1:55:54] if ye be in
[1:55:55] Christ then you are Abraham's seed and
[1:55:58] heir to the
[1:56:00] promis that's your
[1:56:04] identification as he was ministering it
[1:56:06] just struck my heart about the prodical
[1:56:09] son his value wasn't The Inheritance he
[1:56:12] was
[1:56:14] given the inheritance was given because
[1:56:17] his value as a
[1:56:20] son because of his
[1:56:22] identification I see how our our pastors
[1:56:25] been ministering on identification
[1:56:26] brother Peterson about the face of God
[1:56:28] you know what gives that coin the value
[1:56:30] is the face of the coin yes and here
[1:56:33] God's telling you you're mine you're my
[1:56:35] Offspring You're my seed that's your
[1:56:41] value why don't we just worship him a
[1:56:43] little
[1:56:46] bit just allow the Lord to deal with
[1:56:48] your heart and that you can come to a
[1:56:51] true identification of who you are
[1:56:57] G why don't you just take a moment
[1:56:59] before we're dismissed pour your spirit
