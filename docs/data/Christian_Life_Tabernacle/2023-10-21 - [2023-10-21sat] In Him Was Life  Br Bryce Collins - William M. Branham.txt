Description:
In Him Was Life
Br Bryce Collins
Saturday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
October 4, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

maybe you haven't even known it but he's been good to you and I say the the fact that you've actually made it to this place tonight is the goodness of God drawing you and calling you and making a way that you could come into His presence and hear what God would have for you amen we're just so thankful for the opportunity to come together tonight and just be gathered into his presence uh we're thankful to have brother Bryce Collins with us from Victory Tabernacle in Claremore Oklahoma uh many of you might not know him but with time maybe little Fellowship afterwards you might get to know him but God God knows you he knows what you're going through brother Bryce doesn't know but the word is still a discerner of the thought and intense of the heart and he certainly can speak to you if there's a desire that you might have just hold that before the Lord if you need an answer if you need Deliverance if you want God to do something for you maybe you've never known God you've never been touched or nothing's really transpired in your life that would be a convincing uh experience for you to even know that God exist well you simply just have to say God if if you're real would you show yourself to me and if you are real I want to know you and God can take a little Ser service like this and do something special for you where you can leave changed and not the same anymore because that's the kind of God we serve there's a quote that reads the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are the bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself self and gaze of us his spirit plac in us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass does he love us yes he loves you how do you know because he said so we'll just invite brother Bryce to come at this time let's all just stand let's sing that second verse as he comes and let's just have an expectation for what God would have for each one of us that gathered I love your voice I love your voice oh you have L me through the fire in the darkest night and you are close like no other I've known you as a father I've known you as a friend and I have in the goodness of God oh in all my [Music] life every bre I I re praise the Lord amen it's good to be with you this evening and amen how many's happy to be in church tonight praise the lord we uh count it as an honor to be with you and as brother Matthew said I don't know a whole lot of you here but I I have met a few and and I've enjoyed fellowship with a few of you but it's it's good to meet you amen and we uh we've been looking forward to being with you in service and uh it's just an honor to be a Christian that's right it's an honor to serve the Lord It's a privilege to serve him and to know him amen don't ever let life teach you something different than that don't let your trials teach you anything different it's an honor to serve the Lord amen we uh we grown to know brother Matthew and and of course brother Aaron's been to the church there uh way back a few uh five six years ago and then brother Matthew come and so we've we've gotten to know him and finally got to meet Brother David and that's been a an honor to to meet him and I I I have great great respect for the elders that have stood the test of time and have persevered through a lot of things and so uh I I have great respect for that that they've been a a real Lighthouse and a a solid anchor and so I say God bless our brother David for his stand in the word and pray God's blessings upon the church here in in all parts and so uh I'm not much for small talk so if you have your bibles if you would like to turn with me to St John chapter 1 and we're going to read the first four verses together St John chapter 1 before we read the word I like to I just like to bow before the author of the word together Heavenly Father Lord as we approach this time together and we come to this portion of the service we realize Lord that this is the most meaningful and most important part and we're all together insufficient in ourselves to to begin to even take this word Lord and to speak it but we look to you God that your anointing would be a on both the speaking and the hearing of your word and help us Lord just to surrender our heart to you and our our thoughts and our lips Lord that God you would come by and Speak Lord to your children and may they hear your voice Above All Else Lord and God that each one would be drawn closer to you and in a deeper love Lord we know that we've been told that when we come to the word we'll either leave better or leave worse and it's our desire Lord that we would leave better Lord I pray God thy blessings upon each one the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray amen St John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men amen God bless you you can be seated so I want to thank you brother I want to take from the fourth verse there in him was life in him was life and so I just I'm not I'm not a uh I'm not a philosophical person but this may sound kind of philosophical for a moment here but the question come to me and the Simplicity of it what is life what is life and if we was to ask you know uh go out on the street and take a survey we'd probably get a quite a variety of of answers to what is life and and so we we believe and we know and we've heard that you know it's it's a gift of life that we've been given in the beginning that we receiv receiv life from somewhere and it's a gift to us but you know if it is a gift it means that somebody gave it to you amen it wasn't something that you achieved or you you will yourself into but you were given life and so in the Simplicity of it you would say say well you know my mom and my dad through a union of marriage and and I came forth as a product of that that love and that Union and here I am life came from my mom and dad and so you would say true that that that is in essence true but where did it come for them it had to start somewhere it had to have an origin somewhere now if you'll just excuse me for a a moment I I I'm going to take a little Divergence here and and then uh talk about science and many scientists you know would would begin to break down where life came from Life originated you know and and they would look at it so we we could go back and they would go back and begin way back in the beginning as far as they see it and what they believe would be the big bang theory that most of them would subscribe to and so I I read a little bit about that because I'm not real familiar with all of that but you know you can find out a lot of things if you just get on our modern day Google and start search and you'll you'll find out a lot of different things and so uh they they were saying that the Universe once was a superheated condensed single point and just bear with me for a moment and that single point at some point in time burst it just the Big Bang occurred right and and so out of that one instant they believed that there was somewhat uh two trillion galaxies that were birthed out of a bang and out of that there was a 100 billion stars within each one of those two trillion galaxies that came in into existence and began to move apart and they the science is going by observation they're looking at observation they're making their conclusion based upon what they observe right so somehow by chance if you'll bear with me there was a certain Galaxy that began to take shape and there was a certain star within that 100 billion stars in that Galaxy that began to take upon it a shape and planets begin to form and by chance they begin to uh orbit these planets began to orbit this one star and one of the planets settled into a a perfect position so that it would be in the right place Hallelujah so that that would be as we go through these by chances by Chance the size of that star would be just right the amount of heat and the amount of radiation from that star would not be too great or too strong and by Chance the orbit would be just far enough but not too far and by chance that the distance would be just perfect that it would hold that that planet in a perfect order to go around that star that is drifting through space in a in a a perfect harmony by chance too slow to be pulled in by the gravity of the star it would have it would have fallen into the into the orbit and went into that star and been dissolved if it's too far away or too high of a speed it would have drifted off into space at the same time there would be a a moon if you've ever looked at this and and you can appreciate the the balance and the Perfection of it that by chance this Moon would Circle this certain planet and as it would Circle this planet it would pull on that planet so that that planet as it went around that star would actually move to and fro on its line of travel around that star now this is all by chance right just the right distance this Moon would be to stay in that Perfect Harmony just the right speed and by all these chance happenings the conditions would end up just right that there would be life would appear in the form of a single cell amoeba or some form of single cell organism would appear and over time eventually begin to multiply into a multi cell creature or organism and and on up it would go and by chance all of this is happening just perfectly to bring forth life yeah and since it would move from these multicell organisms on up into what we know as animal life and it would be that animal life would require oxygen it would just be by chance there would be the right amount of oxygen in the atmosphere to support that life but yet if it was only the oxygen there and animals continue to reproduce the oxygen would not be balanced there would have to be something to make up the lack of oxygen and the the animal life would put off carbon dioxide which would begin to pollute the atmosphere over time so plant life would appear by chance to create a balance to the unbalanced and this plant life would begin to use the carbon dioxide and produce the oxygen to bring the balance that was needed all by chance there would be such a harmonious balance that life would actually continue and so if we'll just go by chance let's just keep going by chance by Chance by chance by chance you know by Chance the life moved on up and moved on up and then finally the chimpanzee and the and the the ape and what have you and then as science would say then there appeared a a missing link somewhere and then man of course we know what the missing link is so without going into all that but also that the atmosphere would by chance also be such that it would bring water inland because that would would be necessary for the Inland species and things to be able to exist so the atmosphere just so happens to carry the water in and dump it out so that it would be Inland as well right you know it's a lot of by chances I I believe it was my when I was in school for a period of time and uh college there was a physics Professor that was actually a Christian and he said that's why I am a believer is because if you take all these astronomical odds that are against it it takes more faith to believe that by chance this is here it actually would require more faith to believe that by chance by chance by chance he said the odds would be Beyond understanding when you multiply these odds against one another yeah it's all by chance and it's a huge by chance you have more chance of you know my goodness we can't even go there it's quite a quite a way to look at it by chance happenings it would take more faith to believe that than realizing according to him that there was one that was a supreme being in the beginning that created all of this in such Perfection and he said when I look at the Perfection of the order of the universe it declares to me there's somebody that's in control there's somebody that has designed this amen and we find in the Bible according to uh Genesis that God in the beginning breathed into Adam the breath of life and he became a living Soul so God gave life to mankind according to the scripture and by the word word of God he is the author of life he is the source of Life there is no other source of Life there is no other place to find life only by God he authorized it he wrote it he orchestrated it and he made it and gave it amen the Supreme Being the the source of life amen gave life yes sir where there was no life amen in the Garden of Eden before came in we know that the life that God gave man was a pure form of life it was pure it was not the life that you and I would say today I know what life is I've lived life I've been here and I've I've lived in this in this body of Flesh and I I know what life is I've experienced life the life that God gave in the beginning was not mixed with sickness with heartache with sorrow with troubles and most of all with sin and death that's right God gave life Only When sin entered through the fall so did all of these and we know that we're born in in this life and what we know is life been passed down to us from generation to generation and our our great great grandparents passed down to us and on down and on down that life that's been passed down to us is such that it includes sorrow and sickness and heartache and trouble and and death amen so we find in Psalms 515 says behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me that's how we were born we come in that condition amen Psalms 58 says as soon as as as one is born they come speaking eyes so we came that way we came under the condition of a fallen nature and a a a a a sin nature was placed upon us by Design I said a big thing there because in the beginning God was not known to Adam like he's known to you true to me right and he had no way to express himself in the fullness of his attributes except there would come a Divine contrast to Perfection and come down into imperfection and come out of Eternity down into time and begin to reveal himself as who he really is Amen in him was the the abundance of of Beauty and the abundance of of mercy and the abundance of of healing and the abundance of of all the good things that he wanted to have fellowship with his son Adam but he could not in that perfect state so by Design God allowed the fall to come to reflect himself and make himself known I was studying here some time back about um refracted light and and looking at at light and we know that when you take a three4 uh prism a a glass object and you put it in the presence of sunlight that that sunlight will pass through that that prism and refract and it curves and it displays on the back side the rainbow colors that are visible to our our eye and I was looking at that and I thought that's that's really interesting and I began to to think I wonder if if that actually slows down that light so I got to reading about it and light passing through that prism actually slows down from eternity because the speed of light is eternity there's no time in the speed of light but when it comes into time and refle refracts itself opens up you see the beauty was hidden in the light God revealing his Sevenfold Beauty to you and I amen so we're born in this condition and born with a sin nature so again we'd say what is life I I again did a little Google search the first thing that come up life what's the definition life is a condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter so it distinguishes what's dead and what's alive including the capacity for growth reproduction functional activity and continual change preceding death now that last part is what we don't we don't equate to life or we don't think about life but it's is just as much a part of life as being born that's right the beginning is birth the end is death but we don't like to think about the end we like to focus on all the the beginning and the good part because nobody's seeking for that end right so we don't think about it we go through life and we we put that in the back closet we don't want to think about that but we know it's just as much apart that's right Hebrews 9:27 tells us as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this is a judgment so it's an appointment yeah right and we're not in control of that appointment God's doing the scheduling he's the one that calls the number and says this is your day and this is your hour now these are sobering thoughts but this is this is reality now I was thinking of different things and I come across this quote uh many years back has done me real good to to share this and I believe it'll be a blessing to you but brother Bram had had shared this and this was a real uh good quote and says I was I was looking at a television picture where they let a man down I think two miles or a mile deep in the ocean and they had rays of light and they went out and showing marine life and there com a fish by horrible looking creatures and it's midnight ink black down there and they had phosphorus on their nose and they had no eyes and they have to be fed so it looked like to find their food they were Guided by another sense not by sight cuz they didn't have eyes and they couldn't use them down there and they were guided with another another sense that they could contact their food and he says and I skipped on down here says but now if that little fish could ever come up here and be me would he ever want to be that little fish again down in that midnight Blackness he'd never want to be a fish no more because he's something so much greater greater than a fish he's a man his senses are greater his understanding is greater his intelligence is supreme then multiply that by 10 million then you get what it is when you pass from this from this into the presence of God Yonder where the human being is so much further than what we are here you'd never want to be human being like this no more down in this pest House of sickness and Corruption now this creature has life it's not dead it has life it's got a form of life and the life it lives in is it is surrounded by Darkness it's surrounded by pressure it's surrounded by the the depth of the sea uh immense pressure down you can imagine thousands of feet down there would be an immense pressure that it lives in but it's unaware of what its condition is all right it's conditioned that this is normal yeah this is life for me this is how life was intended for me and and and it just goes about his life as if this is all life has for it this world has got a a conditioning element to it that conditions you and I to accept that this is all Life Is Life consists of uh you know of getting up and and young people going to school and and and you know the the the married people going to jobs and and and going about life and we live in this cycle of life and we continue and that's what life is and we look forward to the the good times taking a trip or a vacation or or acquiring something that we want but we get in this cycle of life but there's so much more right there's a higher life than that yes there is and it is a trap or a a a trick of the devil to get us wrapped up in that and spend days and weeks and years of our life in a cycle of what is proposed to be life but I submit to you the only source of life is Jesus Christ I submit to you that without Christ you don't even know what life is you don't know until you met the author of life and the source of life until he comes in your heart and Tabernacles in your soul you don't know what life is all about you have never experienced life because there's only one source of life and that's a Pure Life that proceeds from God down to a human being amen and Satan tries to pervert it and twist it and Rob you of what life was all about life is to be wonderful life is to be grand amen life is to be joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's what life God gave to the believer so often we live so low below the standards of what he gives to us his offering to you and me is life and that more abundantly yes amen so I began to think well what if there was a way to communicate with this creature and begin to describe to this creature and you can imagine with me being a creature and that's all that you knew was down in the depths of the sea and ink Blackness around you and the pressure yeah and then somebody come down from above of a higher level of a higher understanding yeah and come down and begin to communicate if you could only go up higher there's something so much more than where you're at there's something so much greater and begin to describe to this creature well you're in darkness and you don't even have eyes you don't NE eyes but there's a thing called sight and when you go up higher there's there's light and that light begins to reflect off of things and and the eyes allow you to actually see and and and if you go up higher and there's different forms of higher life above and and you go up higher well you you can actually Crest that that place between the water and there's a thing called atmosphere and air and when you break through that there's a thing called the Sun and there's there's sunlight that comes down and there's life and plant life and mountains and clouds and and all there's so much more yeah so much more and that creature would say well that's nice but I'm content to just remain here I'm I'm fine with life as I have it right now think about it say good question what is life what's it mean to me more specifically what's the meaning of my life and what's the purpose of my life because I believe that the author of Life gave you life and gave you a purpose so as a kid I was thinking you know life growing up most of us could relate growing up life had a lot to do with growing up wanted to get older so we could have this or do that or can't wait until I'm old enough to have a bike can't wait until I'm old enough to have a cycle and and each time you got to that stage there was something else just ahead that you wanted more I want more of that I want I want this I want that and when I finally get 16 I want my first car and when I get my first car then I want my first job I get my first job I I want my you know I want to meet that right girl and then I I want to you know what we know is life that's what we know is life and there's nothing there's not I'm not saying anything against that but there's so much more than just that amen you get married and start your family and and you need a better job and you need more income because things cost more and the cost of living is going up and so much so much pressure on us right and we get in that routine and that cycle of life just beating around the bush just going around and around and around if we're not careful we begin to dream you know always wanted to have that certain house that certain piece of land and so we work for that and we we get that and you know everything we we we achieve and everything that we gain and everything that we are able to attain to without Christ there's always that emptiness that still persists so true there's always that Hollow feeling to it I was thinking you know just for a good example brother Matthew just got a nice new truck but you you know what it's like you get something new and before you know it it's getting old I thought another five years brother Matthew still got the truck instead of his new truck it's the old truck right it it just it's just life it just time just keeps going and the newness the freshness the appreciation of it just kind of wears off and and then we're looking for the next thing right and so that's that's that's the that again is the cycle of this life that we're in and and time is another effect of the fall and time has its effect on everything and so I I was thinking I I've been pastoring now for just a a few short years in comparison to your pastor here uh it's right at I just had the six years now and uh I begin to think you know I I've in that short time I've I've had several times that I preached funerals um just so happened that when I took took over there was just several Elder ones in the church that was passing and and it was a privilege to to to to bury a saint or to you know it's a privilege uh when a saint crosses over to the reward and so I've been privileged to be able to speak but you know as I I would speak in those there was certain things that that I would like to bring up because sadly we again we don't we don't think about the end of the road until the certain times when we're faced with it a loved one passes or you know something and then we end up in a a place and we begin to think about you know the end of the road and and so the Bible says in Proverbs 4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established so that's a that's a good thing for us even the young people here that you would take time to step back and Ponder the path of your feet where is this step taking me which direction am I headed in life is it going to take me closer to the Lord is it going to take me closer to to to the the most important things we got to we got to establish something in our heart what is the true priority in my life what is the most important thing in life what what matters more than anything else is it a full bank account is it the house we're wanting or or these things or is it God in our life is it God in our home is it God Amen the center of it all amen and your walk with God your walk with God is the most important and crucial thing that you will ever attain to is walking with him so pays to consider where are my steps pointing and where are they taking me and a couple of things that I heard that I held on to uh you know when you he hear certain things it just kind of stands out to you it's like that is so true and one thing that I heard years ago was a radio Christian counselor and he was talking about um or I was on the on the radio and he was a Christian counselor and he was talking to somebody answering questions and this man it was his lot that he would go uh at least more than once and he would be the counselor that the uh I believe was a baseball team it may have been a specific team that hired him but it was a professional baseball team he said if I was to name the names of the the athletes he would readily know them and he said I time after time would come and in counseling sessions and meet up with these professional athletes young people again think about this CU we're talking about life and all life has to offer and these young men would come and they pull up in their you know the topof thee line sports car the top-of-the-line luxury car or whatever and pull up in the parking lot and they'd get out with their beautiful wife and they'd come in to sit down they just left their beautiful mansion and their bank accounts full and they're playing ball for a job and they would come in and he said it has amazed me how many times I've been asked this question by these young men they're they're 22 25 whatever in the prime of Life they're athletes they're famous they're they're they're healthy they're they they're not suffering in their body they they're at the very pinnacle of everything come on nothing lacking if they want something they get it cuz they got the m to do it right and they would one by one come with the same question you know I work so hard to achieve my dreams and I've got to the top and everything seems to be fulfilled what I what I really wanted I I I achieved and here I am in the major leagues and here I am I I I I play my my passion is baseball and that's what I do for a living I've got everything right I've reached the top but one by one they say why do I still feel this emptiness why do I still feel like there's something lacking it's because God by design made a special place in a human heart that none of these things will ever be able to take that place no matter what the world has to offer you it will not feel that void years ago I was just a kid in our home I grew up in a a Baptist home and and they had we had TV I grew up with a TV and so I I remember this stood out to me there was a a an actor and he was in his later years and I'm sure you know he would be known if I knew his name but he was he was in his later years he's been interviewed and and this actor uh the reporter began to ask him said you know you pretty much reached all your dreams and all your goals and said uh if there was anything anything that you could do or if there was something that you could ask for right now you're at the end of life and you've you you're famous you've you've you've succeeded in life ain't that something what the world calls success in life you you reached top you done it all you're successful but at the end of the road you know what his answer was if there's one thing that I would want and desire is a place of peace and contentment and here we sit and we think we don't have much but if you've got Christ in your heart and you know that peace and you know what it is to walk with God you've got what the others would long to have amen and all your searching and all be sure amen that you get Christ in your heart amen hallelujah so these professional athletes these Hollywoods and so many if you would hear look out and see the kind of Life they live the the life that they're they're reaching out for drugs and alcohol and and their big times and they live immorally and all these things it all screams out there's an emptiness there there's something lacking there there's something they want that they can't find and so they're continually reaching out and they get tired of this wife they go to another wife and they're just constantly looking for that satisfaction in that place when all the time if they would just turn and look back Amen to the one amen that gave them life and look up to him and say God I need you in my heart I need to know the Living God I need amen something more than what I have I need Jesus in my soul what a change it would be what a change in their life amen to have amen that very source of life living inside of them oh I remember when I come to the Lord and it changed everything the the the trees looked different the grass looked different everything looked different everything was new everything was alive there was no sadness there was no Gloom it was joy unspeakable and full of Glory cuz I'd met the author of my life amen there's nothing like it amen there's nothing that can satisfy like he does there's that sacred place in your heart money's not going to satisfy big times won't satisfy but there is one that'll satisfy amen yes there's one that'll F that empty chamber there's one amen that brings the satisfaction to you and when you find him Christ said when that man found that pearl of great price what did he do he sold out everything because he'd have found the the thing that mattered more than anything Yes sold out everything he let go of everything right the man that found the treasure in the field he sold out everything to buy the field because he found what was really valuable in life praise the Lord amen the Bible says taste and see the Lord is good and I'm reminded of a story that was shared about the Infidel that was in a a a group setting and he was making his case why he didn't believe in God he didn't believe there was such a thing as God and and he was making his case and there come a man and I believe overalls came walking up just an old country bumpkin he had he had an apple in his hand and a knife and he was he was cutting off pieces of it stick in his mouth and he walked up the center aisle to this Infidel and Infidel said what do you want he said I got a question he said what is it he said this apple is it sweet or is it sour the man said well how should I know and he goes my point exactly turned and walked away taste and see the Lord is good he is wonderful amen he he is the sustainer of our life he is the source of your joy he's the source of peace he's the source of contentment amen he's Everything Jesus said in John John 14:6 he said I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto me unto the father but by me not just a way or one of many ways I am the way life the truth the life I am the life the life you're wanting it's in Christ the life you hunger for is in Christ The Emptiness you need filled is in Christ amen that's right praise the Lord amen amen there's so much life in Christ that one day he passed a funeral as a widow of n whose son had died and he was so full of of Life yes that when he came and he approached that funeral that that funeral was broken up because in him is life that Widow was crying for her only son his heart went to her he went over and touched the beer the Bible said and the man that was dead rose up out of that grave out of that funeral casket amen because life meant death and life's greater than death amen there was another time that jiah's daughter was sick and Christ was on his way and they came and said don't trouble him she's already dead and he said where is she he went and broke up all the mo the morning and all that and all the sadness because life came where there was death and when life Came Death had to leave amen when life showed up death had to know its Master amen life come on the scene and death had to scatter and I say amen that's what life does here amen when you find the Life of Christ amen and death has to scatter sin has to scatter de has to scatter turmoil has to scatter because he is a source of Life Pure Life not mixed up life not compromised life not perverted life not Twisted life but pure life the essence of life amen Lazarus family was mourning they lost their the precious brother 4 days he said it's too late it's too late he's gone if you'd only been here it's never too late for the Lord that's say it again it's never too late for the Lord whatever you have in life it's never too late for the Lord right and so when Christ came he spoke these words and said he said unto I believe it was Martha he said I am the res resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live now that's a great that's a great statement a man making a great statement but he was life that's true he was not making some claim that he couldn't back up so when he come to that that grave and he said roll away the stone they said no no you can't do that it's too late it's too bad it's stinks by now it's it's it's such a horrible mess if you'd only come sooner maybe we'd had a chance he said roll away the stone did not I say that you would see the glory of God and when he spoke I love it when he speaks when he spoke his word takes preeminence over everything and death had to give way to a man that was dead carried away four days journey and that Soul had to come back to that body and he came out of that grave amen that was more than just a man standing there that was almighty God that was a source of life that was the eternal power of almighty God Amen tabernacled in flesh amen amen had to give way and him was life he's the very Fountain of Life Jesus told in John 3 said verily verily I say unto you you must be born again yes the very first doctrine of the Bible is you must be born again and later he would say except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of God it's a mystery but when you're born again by the spirit of God what was hidden to you and the creature that's down there in the ink Blackness and the Darkness and the pressure amen when that creature would submit itself and surrender itself and allow that Higher One to take it up out of that ink Blackness and in darkness it would find that there's a reality that's so much greater and so much higher and so much more amen than what you know amen if you'd only amen surrender it all to God if you'd only amen find a place and say Lord I got to know you I got to have you for myself I don't want just a a Bible I just don't want amen somebody talking about God to me I got to have God myself I got to know God myself it's not worth amen religion doesn't satisfy but a personal revelation and a personal experience with God Satan can't oppose that he said you must be born again not perhaps or you really ought to but you must the life that Mom and Daddy give you death has a claim on it there it is death has a claim on that life that's why we got an appointment that's why we talk about death because it's a part of life but when Christ came when the spirit of God when the angel came to a virgin called Mary and spoke to Mary and by the word spoke to her and she accepted that word from that angel and said be it unto me according to that word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the word was made flesh this is Christ being made flesh dwelt Among Us right in him was life yes in him so life came to her and she accepted life in the form of the logos the word coming to her she embraced it and said be it unto me according to Thy word yeah and in her from that moment forward things began to happen and change and it was never through any natural process of bringing forth life because this life had to be Pure Life not the perverted kind for Mom and Daddy but God himself creating within her a Pure Life that death had no claim on it that he came forth in a pure birth in a pure away he didn't come for speaking lies he didn't come for shaping iniquity he was not conceived in iniquity he was conceived by the almighty death had no claim on him when he walked through life and he lived a life unreachable no sin no no no no hold at all on him no sin at all he was not he didn't have sin nature he was perfect he had to be so death had no claim on him there come a day when the Passover was going on there in Jerusalem Israel was keeping the the Commandment that was given to them from the days of Moses and they were bringing their lambs to bring for the sacrifice each each Daddy had for his family for his household had to bring a lamb we know the scripture brought this lamb and the priest would take that lamb and began to look at that lamb and begin to examine that lamb he wasn't looking at the worshipper he wasn't looking at the daddy he wasn't looking at the mama they were they were they were spotted there's no mystery they were condemned no need to examine the worshipper all attention was upon the sacrifice examined it was there a spot was there a blemish was it worthy to be offered for this family not examining but at the same time in Pilot's judgment Hall Christ was there standing the examination he was been examined and scrutinized looked from head to toe is there any fault in him is there something wrong with this sacrifice they weren't looking at it that way but our sacrifice was being scrutinized judged and at the end the conclusion was I find no fault in him I find no fault in him now I want to submit to you that every man that approaches God he comes with some form of offering anytime that man come like the Rich Young Ruler that come he had something to offer he come and said good Master what can I do to inherit eternal life which was something different than the life Mom and Daddy give me what can I have what can I do to inherit that he said thou knowest the scripture keep the Commandments and and all these he said I've done that from my youth up I've been a good boy that was his offering but it wasn't good enough right he said but one thing thou lackest go and sell out yeah go and sell out now that's the point where Humanity gets in the way yeah the selling out part is a part that becomes the challenge to completely sell out I'm talking about selling out your wishes your dreams your future your past your present everything about you everywhere you're going to go whatever you're going to do in life you sell it all out and say Lord yes I give it all to you I'm yours to do whatever you want to do with me I give it all to you and if you ever come to that point with God you're going to find out there is a God to come down and meet you that's right thank you Lord so they took the Lord Jesus we know and crucified him and the third day he rose up because death can't stop Life Death can't hold life death has no claim on the life God gives we're talking about life the purest essence of life what is life is not what you have experienced down here in the form of our existence you think that's life but that's not life but the life that he gives it says in the Bible I came to give you life and that more abundantly more abundantly a greater level of living amen that's what Christ offers to us his offering today is life the Bible says he came not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved we we many of us know this we've been in church but I'm telling you amen that you've got to surrender everything to him you must surrender everything to him to have that life come and dwell inside of you so death couldn't stop life and he told the disciple he said you go up to Jerusalem and you T there until you be endued with power from on high and we know the day of Pentecost come and the Holy Ghost was given Peter stepped forth with the Keys of the Kingdom on that day when the men and Brethren said what men and Brethren what shall we do and we know in Acts 23839 said then Peter said unto them repent repent turn from your ways to God yes be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is to you to your children and to them a far off even down into 2000 and 23 the promise still lives them a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the very life that Christ lived he said you go and te in Jerusalem and that life when I go up and Ascend I'm going to send back that life that token life that life is going to come back into you and live in you because God was descending we know the story how how God was above in the beginning he was above mankind then he came down in the form of Flesh and dwelt with mankind but that's not good enough he wants to be in you he wants to live in you he wants to walk walking you and talking you and have fellowship with you he wants to be your God and you be his people that's the whole essence of the Gospel that's a good news amen God wants to offer you life he wants to give you all the fullness of life amen praise the Lord thank you Lord 2 Corinthians 5:9 says to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation to reconcile us to bring them back into the same standing or the right standing that they lost in the beginning so Christ came to bring us back so that we could have fellowship with him again with no hindrances with no holding back with nothing there between right now amen if you are here and you're filled with the Holy Ghost there's nothing between you and the Lord there's nothing praise the Lord amen there's no hindrance to you there's nothing amen that Fellowship amen that he purchased at Calvary that is bought and paid for and that is for us Amen to walk with him and to talk with him and to dwell with him and to have that restored walk and fellowship with the Lord that's what it's all about is to be able to walk with him and live in that presence praise the Lord brother Braham shares this story about Daniel Curry and he was a well-known Minister and I'm sure many of you are familiar about 150 years ago in the middle eastern part of the United States he was a sainted man one day he had a vision that he had died and he went up to the gate and he knocked at the gate and the man come out to the gate takes care of Heaven this is all a dreamer you know and he said I'm Daniel Curry Reverend Daniel Curry I'm the Evangel IST I've I've one lost thousands of souls to Christ said may I come in today my life is finished on earth and the man said just a moment he looked around what's your name and he said Reverend Daniel Curry and he looked and he said I don't even see your name nowhere he said sir you must be mistaken you must be I won thousands of souls he said I'm an evangelist he said sir here's the book I have no record of you being here said you might appeal your case to the white Throne judgment and he said sir he said he said that's the only thing that I can tell you and he said do you want to appeal your case he said I have I have no choice I I have to you have not my name I H I must appeal and he said he was taken through space and it seemed like about an hour and for finally he come into a light and he said that light got lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter until he was a a million times brighter than the Sun and and he was trembling right in the midst of that no certain object but just in that light and he heard a voice say Daniel Curry was you a minister and he said yes I was and he said did you ever do anything wrong in in the earth he said I thought I was pretty good man until then he said I I done wrong he said did you ever tell a line he said he knowed he said some things that was shady and he said yes yes sir I'm guilty of lying he said did you ever take anything that didn't belong to you and he's no and he yes yes sir I have he said Daniel Curry was you perfect on Earth he said no Lord I wasn't perfect I wasn't perfect and he said I was just listening for that that voice that moment that voice would burst and say depart from me he said he heard a voice sweeter than any mother's voice that ever spoke and he said he turned to and to to look to his side and he saw a face a sweetest face he'd ever seen in his life he said that person standing there said father Daniel Curry wasn't perfect on Earth but on Earth Daniel Curry stood for me and now up here I'll stand for him you take all his iniquity and put it on my account and I'll stand for him here hallelujah because he stood for me on Earth it's a sobering thought very sobering because in all of our goodness when you talk to somebody about you know the Lord and and what they you know well i' I've been good I've done I've done nice things I've helped here and I've done this and and they start reminiscing over the good things that they've done because man wants to have an offering he wants to bring an offering Cain was the first one Cain and Abel and Cain he brought an offering he felt like was worthy in himself he felt it was worthy he he wasn't playing games he wanted to worship God he came and brought he built his altar just so and he he made it just so he was sincere he seriously wanted to worship God he wanted to bring an offering before the Lord but the Bible tells tells us that he had no regard he had no respect unto his offering because it's what came it's what he could do God's not looking for what we can do right so Abel in the back part of his mind he remembered that Mom and Dad told me that when the fall happened and they were taken out of the garden that the Lord slew a an animal a lamb and placed those skins upon mom and dad so that they would be covered from their nakedness and he had a Revelation that that must have been pleasing to God so while Cain was decorating his Altar and making his offering to God and saying but I've been a I've been a good guy and I've done this and I've I've helped the poor and I've done this over here and I've done I I I tried to treat everybody just right then I'm hoping for the best that's how people approach the end of life I'm hoping for the best I've been pretty good I've done good deeds I'm really not that bad of a guy a lot of people like me but when it comes to that time that offering is refused there's only one offering only one offering that will be accepted on that day and that's the blood that Christ shed at Calvary no other offering will be accepted there's no other offering in the sight of God that will make it all man's righteousness are as filthy rags in the eyes of God that sinless life that Christ so Abel's there hacking away and making a mess of his altar but he had a revelation it's not what I can do but it's this blood is a covering in my place in my stad I deserve to be this I deserve it by my actions I deserve this but it took my place and that was only a four type of Christ taking our place at Calvary and it tells us that no matter what we do and how good we are it's never going to be good enough until we recognize in US dwells no good thing true nothing nothing to offer no goodness I've been a pretty good guy that's wonderful but that won't work in the presence of the almighty these are sobering thoughts we must and I I'm going to I'm going to try to just bring this down to a finality right here you got to identify with that sacrifice brother Andrew uh Bann and we were visiting earlier and he didn't know it but he he referred to something that stood out to him and I thought that was already on my heart when we identify with our sacrifice I don't know if you've ever watched but in the Old Testament when they brought their lamb the worshipper would take that that that lamb and he would look it right in the eye and he'd put his head to forehead looking in the eye y believing that his sins were being transferred onto that animal all his guilt would be upon that animal yeah that that animal had to die in his place until you identify with the Death Christ paid at Calvary until you look him in the eye until you put your head to his head until you feel the pain that your sins brought to him until you identify to the depths of the agony that you caused him yeah I tell you when you really identify with what he did for you oh my there ain't enough that you could do to express your love there's not enough that you could give back an expression of a return of love when people get the wrong impression about serving God and they think well it's a dos and a don'ts and this no sir it's a love affair with him it's only based out of love and what God did for you and if it's based on anything else that ain't worth nothing but when it's a response to what Christ gave you and what he did you amen that amen is your motivation amen that's what motivates a Believer Amen to be faithful to the house of God to be there and be accountable to be the one amen that stands up and says I believe God I'm praising the Lord no matter what anybody else does I know what God did for me I know how real he is to me I know the life I lived and I know the life he gave me I know amen for me amen I am going to serve the Lord because he's worthy what he did for me I could never repay it all I can never give him enough praise I could never rejoice in his presence enough there's not enough Praise In My Soul worthy to the king amen I can never give him enough my faithfulness amen I could never be faithful enough to express it I could never sacrifice enough to to to begin to express when you really know when you really identify with what Christ done for you that day at Calvary when you really take him in your hands look at in the eye yeah and realize that was for me that's what he did for me thank you Lord and if he had not done that for me I would have nothing at the end of the road it would all be empty just like these people said there's nothing I'm empty I have nothing life is but a vape it's here today and gone tomorrow it's like grass that Withers up and is is withered it Springs up and withered overnight it's here today and gone tomorrow tomorrow just yesterday I was a a teenage boy sitting in church and trying to pay attention and today I'm going almost 52 how'd I get here I'm Grandpa how'd that happen seemed like overnight I don't feel like I'm that old I still feel like I I ought to be a a youngster my body tells me different My Mind fails me time's having its effect time's having its effect on all of us we're moving towards that day if the Lord should not return we're going to go by the way of the Grave we're all we've all got that appointment and it's something that we've all got to deal with it's between you and the Lord yes that's right let's just stand to our feet let's just bow our hearts before him bow your heads I know there's visitors here and appreciate each one of you coming I just want to ask each one as we just bow our hearts what is life yes what is the purpose of life what's it all about why are we here are we here just to as we said to go through the motions and the cycles of Life come down to the end of the road an old man old woman all we have left is to to look back at all the good times that we had and that's all there is that I submit to you there's so much more there's so much more Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life I I'm the door to the Sheepfold any man that tries to enter some other way is a thief and a robber there's only one way Christ is that door he's the only door that leads to life but I tell you I tell you friend if you will if you'll lay down your heart heart before him lay down your life look up to him and say I I want you Lord I I want to know you I want a real God I don't want to just hear about you I want to just be told that you're real I need a God that has skin on it I need a God that's real that can speak back to me I tell you from my own heart he's been that kind of God to me many in here could testify he is that kind of God he's not a God to remain in in the Bible and in imaginary form and just a thought but he's a real living being and if you desire let's just pray if you're Desiring him reach out to him right now if you have a need in your life reach out to him right now he's here he's here right now Heavenly Father oh God lord we as just mortal beings Lord talk talking about the awesomeness lord of what

question what is Life As We Begin our lives and we start to live the world wants to present a picture of what living is all about you get the image set before you and now in the age we live in through technology and through TV and television and fashion and entertainment we start to have a perception of what life is all about and we're constantly wanting to make more money and get a better job and have a nicer car [Music] and but is that really Liv Liv is that really life then maybe you come to a place where you say you're a Christian and you believe in God and you believe in Jesus Christ and and you've made a decision that I'm a Christian well I want to ask you then then why why do you still run after the things that the world has to offer you still need entertainment you still need cigarettes you still need alcohol there's things that you're still running after because really there's an emptiness that you're trying to feel there's a void and maybe you've you've tried to make an effort you've tried to make a decision and I am a Christian I believe in God but yet you still have you still have things that you you got to run to for your peace and when when when things get hard and and you you get under that stress and that tension you're tempted to smoke or I I just want to have a drink or you know I don't want to forget about everything I just want to watch a movie but I say what about Christ yes amen amen that's that emptiness because I want to tell you you could make all the money in the world you you could have the the greatest job that that there could ever be as we we so uh uh uh well heard of it put forth of people of wealth and financial success they would always come to the place why do I feel so empty and you know you can come to a place in your life where you can be born again and filled with a whole Holy Ghost and yet you go through some trials and you go through some heartache and you go through some pain and you say why do I feel so empty that's the time you turn to the Lord say Lord maybe I've I've gotten a little away from you I I maybe thought I was I was doing pretty good but I feel empty inside before we sing this song I just want to ask you maybe maybe the reason you're living the way you're living and doing the things that you're doing and you're constantly looking for an outlet or a release or something to take away the stress and and it's just uh you're having uh your ups and your Downs maybe it's because you've never known them you believe in him you you know God is real you believe in Jesus Christ but do you know him have you ever come to the place the scripture says I become a new creature amen old things pass away and All Things become new oh I invite you tonight to come to that place where you don't need a

to Fellowship around the things of God as we dismiss but there's something there's something greater than than what we could feed our natural bodies what is life in him is life if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's no other name under heaven where by which men would be saved Peter said repent if you realize the way you're living is wrong and in your heart you you truly are sorry for living that way you want to repent and plead the blood of Jesus Christ he said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that

somebody here that would just want to lift their hand and say Lord I need you I realize I haven't been living right God bless you is there somebody else God bless you this is just between you and the Lord God sees that hand and you're Defying Gravity and you're making a move for him and I promise you if you make a move for him he'll make a move for you man somebody here that knows that they need the Holy Ghost and you just want to lift your hands say Lord I want the Holy Ghost is there somebody else God bless you Lord Jesus thank you for your love we're certainly undeserving we're certainly not [Music] worthy but Lord we love you because you first loved us we certainly were fit to die [Music] and a burning hell would be a Fitting Place for [Music] me my sin and my iniquity is too great Lord for me to think of but it wasn't too great for you to carry to Calvary because your love conquers all Lord we just want to tell you we thank you for your love tonight when we were unlovable Lord you loved us and you made a way for us Lord you brought us to the house of God tonight Lord where if it wasn't for your love we would be somewhere out in the world somewhere out in some bar somewhere out in some Club maybe in a prison jail or in the grave but Lord you're you're God of mercy and compassion and Grace and your love reached down and you pulled us up out of the muck and the mire Lord we were that creature down in the darkness and the depths of darkness and pressure Lord and you are that higher being that come down and said you're my son you're my daughter you don't have to live like this anymore I paid the price for your sin and I've made a way that you can come out of that pressure and that condition down there in the darkness you took us by the hand Lord you started to walk us out of that darkness and little by little Lord you're leading us into that great light until that day we're caught away into a Rapture how we thank you and love you for that Lord you see the hands that were lifted up Lord they they want to serve you Lord and they recognize that there's an emptiness inside they recognize that there's a pool and Lord we know that pool come from you therefore it's God working in their life so Lord they've wanted to repent and I pray that they know that there's a a pool here that they can be baptized in to fulfill your word that they can be filled with the Holy Ghost and others lifting their hand that maybe they've been obedient to that word but they're still Desiring to be filled Lord you saw that lifting of that hand so now God we're going to go in faith knowing that you gave the promise heavens and earth will pass away but your word will never pass away so Lord we rebuke the enemy that tries to cause doubt knowing when we go from these doors the enem is going to try to pluck that seed out that been sown but Lord we're we're mindful of that we're going to water this seed with our praise and water in faith and in your word Lord knowing that it has to bring forth of its kind and we thank you for that now Lord bless each one as we go our separate ways Lord may you restore under brother Bryce all that he's poured out Lord and we're in expectation for the morning for what you have for us coming forth we love you now Lord we just pray a a blessing upon the food in the fellowship in your name the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
