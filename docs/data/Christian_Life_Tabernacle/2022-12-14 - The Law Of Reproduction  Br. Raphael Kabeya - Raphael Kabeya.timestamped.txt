[12:34] that the whole class even those that

[12:42] their eyes and then I was like God
[12:45] you are in control of everything and
[12:49] then after that I just felt an arms
[12:52] wrapped around me my spirit felt so safe
[12:55] and then once they set all clear I said

[34:53] foreign
[34:58] who is the pastor of this church
[35:06] to the opportunity for the opportunities
[35:09] given me once again to take its place
[35:11] and speak for uh to his congregation
[35:19] honestly speaking I'm very happy to be
[35:22] among you in this church just please see
[35:25] the frame David magary I appreciate
[35:27] Brother David McGarry
[35:33] there's a lot of things we share in
[35:36] common in the approach of the end time
[35:38] message is
[35:45] as much time as I spend here with with
[35:48] him and I see the the approach of the
[35:52] message I could say there's a lot of
[35:53] common things that we have in the world
[35:57] as
[35:59] auxiliaries of Malachi 4
[36:01] Fidelity
[36:04] his Fidelity or his trust to the prophet
[36:15] places every individual
[36:18] uh in front of the message of the hour
[36:20] which is the word of God
[36:23] and Prophet God sent us a prophet and
[36:27] prophet salallah and the prophet is the
[36:30] word of God
[36:35] when the prophet is constantly being
[36:38] presented to you it's the the will of
[36:41] God that's being presented to you
[36:45] and we know that all that we have need
[36:47] of
[36:50] from the the new birth to the glory
[36:55] for us all of it is found in this
[36:58] message
[37:02] the testimonies that we hear many times
[37:05] in this place
[37:07] is
[37:11] it shows that God is in this place and I
[37:16] I invite you to come and support the
[37:18] work that that so to support the work
[37:23] with an honest heart
[37:28] because the testimony show that God is
[37:31] here is not a man who's working
[37:35] even though testimonies are not often
[37:37] what we are looking for
[37:40] we can have testimonies and not have God
[37:46] many signs and wonders doesn't mean
[37:48] you're walking with God
[37:51] and I believe preaching the word
[37:55] it's to bring the good news
[38:00] the Gospel of Jesus Christ resurrected
[38:07] and living among the people that have a
[38:10] need like we are the problem is
[38:19] people having situations and needs that
[38:22] need help that they want to see the
[38:24] presence of the Lord in
[38:30] that's why we preach the word so that
[38:32] people who have problems may find
[38:34] Solutions
[38:37] because we say all is possible to them
[38:40] that believe who believe what the word
[38:42] of God
[38:44] someone showed me
[38:47] because
[38:55] that that today the gospel has become a
[39:00] business where the personal interest is
[39:02] at heart first
[39:04] and I'm thinking I'm imagining
[39:12] that if Jesus was to preach the gospel
[39:15] that's preaches that's been preached in
[39:17] churches today
[39:18] um
[39:20] in order to receive acclamation and
[39:24] people like clapping
[39:26] handsome
[39:27] I believe you it will it would have
[39:30] never been crucified
[39:33] everybody would have wanted to be his
[39:35] friend
[39:38] you hear oftentimes did you like my
[39:41] message
[39:42] how did you hear the message
[39:44] it was really good
[40:00] in this evil age
[40:04] the message of the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:11] it was it was speaking to everybody
[40:13] without an exception
[40:17] to bring everyone to examine themselves
[40:24] I can give some examples but I don't
[40:27] really have a lot of time I can look in
[40:29] John chapter five
[40:31] it's it's it's evening service I'm gonna
[40:34] try to be fast
[40:38] in John chapter 5 verse 39 to 40. the
[40:43] Bible says
[40:44] it says search the scriptures
[40:48] because in them you think you have life
[40:52] but they are the ones who testify of me
[40:56] but you don't want to come to me
[40:59] he was talking to ministers
[41:08] the educated ones that were fully
[41:11] emerged in the scriptures
[41:16] they were happy with the knowledge that
[41:18] they were gathering and exposing it to
[41:21] people and speaking women
[41:27] but the very word that they were
[41:29] exposing to people was they in flesh and
[41:32] they wouldn't recognize it
[41:34] I have not gotten to my message
[41:41] when you go in all the the chapter
[41:44] Matthew 20 the 23rd chapter Jesus
[41:51] Jesus is Calling the the Pharisees and
[41:54] the scrub is calling them Hypocrites
[41:57] not just them the leaders
[42:01] but even those that were followers
[42:05] because if the the leader is blind
[42:10] he will even leave the ones that is
[42:12] leading uh in that in the in into fall
[42:15] message
[42:21] it was a message without compromise it
[42:24] was a message that was uh speaking to
[42:27] everybody without leaving anybody out
[42:29] the message
[42:31] the message of Paul and Peter to shiji's
[42:35] it was touching the hearts of people
[42:39] to have them change directions
[42:44] you can read in the book of Acts chapter
[42:47] 4 verse 12 at the same verse 7th for
[42:50] Acts chapter 5 verse 29.
[42:54] Galatians chapter verse chapter 1 verse
[42:57] 10. the Apostle Paul is speaking
[43:04] am I looking for favor with man oh God
[43:07] commission may change you see when I'm
[43:09] standing here come say if you tell the
[43:10] Jew as a servant of God
[43:13] I'm not looking to please man this is
[43:18] I'm seeking to please the one who called
[43:21] me to preach
[43:23] so that I can help those that are in
[43:26] need
[43:29] I'm not preaching to look at people and
[43:31] see how much they will appreciate the
[43:34] Apostle Paul is saying
[43:38] am I looking for favor with man or God
[43:43] am I trying to please man
[43:47] if I was still pleasing to men
[43:50] I will not be a servant to Christ
[43:57] that's the Apostle Paul and Peter and
[44:00] all the other Apostles
[44:08] it was a message that was directed to
[44:11] people so it could take down them out of
[44:13] Judaism and bring them into the word of
[44:16] the hour
[44:19] when we say that uh but Branham preached
[44:22] like Paul is
[44:27] a very type of Christ in this evil age
[44:31] I believe that with all my heart that
[44:34] William Branham is
[44:37] the true example of of Christ in this
[44:41] age is
[44:45] without compromise
[44:51] knowing that he was talking to a
[44:53] perverted generation like the one in the
[44:55] time of lot don't sit down in this age
[44:59] in this country and in all over the
[45:02] world lumos actually
[45:05] homosexuality is being proclaimed
[45:08] everywhere
[45:09] the lesbianism
[45:13] the changing and and choices of sex
[45:18] they teach to the kids the swazil
[45:23] pictures
[45:25] that they have the choice to make about
[45:27] what sex they want to be that they
[45:29] cannot say the boy or girl they have to
[45:31] make a choice
[45:34] the introduction of Satanism
[45:37] through kindergarten
[45:41] the kids that are being adopted by gay
[45:44] couples
[45:46] who finds themselves in complete
[45:49] confusions
[45:51] when his dad and mom come to find him at
[45:54] school foreign
[46:40] Spirits they hear in our churches
[46:45] how can we keep quiet
[46:48] or keep people in peace and
[46:54] tend to serve the god of William Branham
[46:58] when you hear William Branham you'll
[47:01] hear him say often times
[47:04] I don't have the intention to hurt you
[47:09] I'm not trying to to hurt your feelings
[47:14] I just want to be sincere as a servant
[47:18] of Christ
[47:22] it's going to say I'm gonna hurt you a
[47:24] little bit
[47:26] but what I desire in my heart is
[47:29] to just tell you the truth
[47:33] and I believe a servant of Christ
[47:37] the message of the end time corresponds
[47:45] and if we take it correctly
[47:52] the world will know that God sent a
[47:55] different message than what that which
[47:56] is being preaching to churches
[47:59] says in uh
[48:02] invent good and the unveiling of God
[48:06] paragraph 22.
[48:08] I will leave I will read it fully
[48:12] um
[48:18] now on my subject this morning I I put
[48:22] my confidence in God that he will reveal
[48:24] what he wants
[48:26] I've not I've not yet given the title of
[48:29] my sermon
[48:34] and every time when you take the tape
[48:36] and you listen to it
[48:39] I hope and I believe because
[48:46] that you that you have received a
[48:49] spiritual understanding of what god of
[48:52] what God has been trying to get over to
[48:55] the church
[48:56] without saying it out right out
[49:01] it's a thing
[49:06] sometimes we have to say things in such
[49:10] a way that he might thin down
[49:13] in our churches today
[49:16] we want to gather no do you know
[49:20] God is not there to just gather anything
[49:24] at this person
[49:30] Ally it might be in a way to bring some
[49:35] to go out
[49:36] some to leave certain a reflection some
[49:41] to ponder over
[49:51] you believe that
[49:54] the moment no
[49:56] matter if you may allow me now
[50:01] do you take the words of Barbara
[50:06] is
[50:10] in a message testimony
[50:14] um preach it's a July 7th
[50:17] 1953 paragraph 36.
[50:22] says
[50:26] we didn't come here for money
[50:30] we come here to help you
[50:35] and everywhere that we go man of God
[50:38] knows this
[50:40] we don't go for money we don't look for
[50:44] money because
[50:47] God blesses people one way or the other
[50:50] day but we come here to help you
[50:54] foreign
[51:01] I pray God to help me
[51:24] to bring somebody to look on themselves
[51:28] not just to be happy with the group it
[51:31] is
[51:34] just to help but there's one thing
[51:39] I kept my meetings pure para because of
[51:43] the love of God
[51:47] it's never we have to repeat the prophet
[51:51] okay
[51:53] it's never yeah I stopped let's like he
[51:57] stopped okay
[52:00] an organizator if if I meet an organizer
[52:06] who was trying to uh to to get to ask
[52:10] for money
[52:13] organization
[52:14] that was the last day for that organizer
[52:17] to be with me
[52:28] I didn't have this in my head
[52:32] supportive African casualties I want you
[52:35] to be patient with you Africans that I
[52:38] may say
[52:40] the first Africans who started coming to
[52:42] United States
[52:44] they were coming to ask for money
[52:46] Elizabeth
[52:48] and Americans had good faith
[52:51] to give them a lot of money
[52:54] or either to build churches
[52:57] and when they were going with that money
[52:59] is
[53:02] they were growing and doing businesses
[53:05] and they will eat all of that money and
[53:07] nobody will see that money is three
[53:09] decisions but to be having learned from
[53:13] those things
[53:17] I cannot travel without having the
[53:20] ability to support my travels
[53:24] I
[53:29] call my church
[53:38] even though everything works goes with
[53:41] money even so
[53:45] um
[53:51] it was the last day
[53:54] if God doesn't Supply the needs
[53:59] then it's time for me to go back
[54:02] you see that's exact there's nothing
[54:05] else
[54:08] I'm just here to help you
[54:12] and I believe by the grace of God
[54:18] that my little gift can help somebody
[54:21] tonight
[54:23] and I do all my best sister I ask you
[54:27] tonight
[54:29] that that for your support of faith
[54:36] and and your prayer as I'm serving the
[54:40] people
[54:41] I believe that William Branham Avenue
[54:44] he had the vision the same vision as
[54:47] power he used to put a delicious
[54:50] just to help people win the most of the
[54:54] the souls
[55:00] without asking for uh anything according
[55:04] to First Corinthians 9 and 9 and 7 7 to
[55:09] 19.
[55:11] and he knows
[55:14] that is the blessings of of the Lord
[55:17] that enriches
[55:19] and he doesn't follow it with any hurts
[55:24] that's how we try to walk in this world
[55:27] president to know that those that went
[55:29] before us
[55:33] they gave a wrong image of those that
[55:36] came from Africa
[55:39] and we want to walk with with balance
[55:44] I believe with all my heart because
[55:49] that the grace of God keeps the believer
[55:52] so they can remain with god
[55:55] without your personal efforts
[55:59] I believe in the eternal security of the
[56:03] church
[56:04] as long as you are in the church
[56:09] you are in you are under the security
[56:12] and you have to remain there
[56:16] remain in Christ Jesus
[56:24] God predestinated the church so she can
[56:27] appear before him without any read or
[56:30] anything
[56:32] the church will be without reproach
[56:36] without any read with no uh no wrinkles
[56:41] regardless of what happened
[56:45] God will have a church without a blemish
[56:49] or without any wrinkle me but
[56:52] I also believe
[56:56] you see all of those that gather into a
[57:00] tabernacle like the church here
[57:02] they are not in the church
[57:05] when we speak of the church it's not a
[57:09] gathering the church
[57:11] it's the body of Christ
[57:36] in all the categories of Believers in
[57:40] the church you see your trusted here
[57:43] there's three types of Believers
[57:49] and God knows what is feeding for each
[57:52] category this one now this category
[57:56] category and that same God speaks to all
[57:59] three categories
[58:01] [Music]
[58:04] and every single one of us we have to
[58:06] work our salvation with fear and
[58:08] trembling
[58:10] don't be airing
[58:13] oh God they're driven aside by all kinds
[58:17] of things
[58:21] that's why the gifts of God Work
[58:24] differently to a category and fast
[58:28] so it could put on the street three
[58:31] categories of Believers with in front of
[58:34] the the will of God which is the word of
[58:36] God
[58:41] I I don't want to speak of myself but in
[58:44] my in my work as I'm preaching I want to
[58:47] speak a little bit about me
[58:49] in my walk
[58:51] is
[58:54] I don't want to be an Armenian or a
[58:57] calvinist
[59:00] is
[59:02] I don't want to I belong to one group I
[59:05] want to be in communion with everybody
[59:08] because our Prophet is
[59:18] speaking with them with respect and and
[59:21] he was speaking about them
[59:24] that's what rejoices
[59:28] because I don't believe I'm the best
[59:30] preacher pedicated God has best
[59:34] preachers in all the groups
[59:38] this message is the entire word of God
[59:43] I believe it's the Full Gospel
[59:47] I believe I I I I believe with my
[1:00:00] and I'm just going forward interesting
[1:00:03] in his grace
[1:00:05] may God help us brothers and sisters
[1:00:09] that we may have respect for one another
[1:00:13] and to know
[1:00:16] that God is using us differently
[1:00:20] that we may remain each one in his own
[1:00:24] way of seeing things
[1:00:27] and remaining with our convictions
[1:00:32] a Christian has to have conviction and
[1:00:36] particularly a man of God
[1:00:40] it doesn't uh it doesn't hinder him from
[1:00:43] respecting the convictions
[1:01:40] that's not a word
[1:01:49] and the seed is not air with the shark
[1:01:52] bacovances paragraph 26.
[1:02:01] it says this is 30 years later later and
[1:02:05] I'm here still tonight
[1:02:08] proclaiming that message
[1:02:12] and around the world it went is
[1:02:18] and I'm glad to be back in my hometown
[1:02:22] where where I grew up
[1:02:28] to represent this Lord Jesus that I
[1:02:31] still love with all my heart
[1:02:35] each day he grows still sweeter than he
[1:02:39] was the day before
[1:02:40] listen closely
[1:02:46] I've never changed one iota in my
[1:02:50] Doctrine
[1:02:52] the first thing I started
[1:02:57] I still believe the same thing tonight
[1:03:01] it's the same yesterday today and
[1:03:04] forever
[1:03:11] he believed the same thing since he
[1:03:14] started and the Revelation grew and he
[1:03:17] never rejected what he began with so
[1:03:19] massage
[1:03:20] this message is divine foreign
[1:03:34] foreign
[1:04:21] poem is saying that he's he he's not he
[1:04:24] our brother who speaks at the pulpit he
[1:04:27] said so it's not
[1:04:33] I I think you understand
[1:04:39] because
[1:04:42] he says it's not he's not the one who
[1:04:45] speaks when he stands at the pulpit
[1:04:50] it says it's the light that was above
[1:04:53] his cradle when he was a baby
[1:04:56] this is in 1958.
[1:05:02] we have to doubt our doubt in the
[1:05:05] message of William Branham
[1:05:08] because this message is the finest God
[1:05:11] speaking
[1:05:13] in the message conference paragraph dues
[1:05:16] paragraph 12. the prophet says
[1:05:25] we find out that there's a lot of
[1:05:27] gathering as there were even more than
[1:05:31] before
[1:05:36] and I believe it's time for the people
[1:05:38] of God to be gathering even more
[1:05:43] I come and let us let us reason together
[1:05:46] God said you see Japanese
[1:05:51] I believe is the time for the church to
[1:05:53] gather together
[1:05:58] that that are little uh uh differences
[1:06:02] and all of it may be taken aside
[1:06:07] we are gathering to become one
[1:06:12] Jesus prayed that we may be one uh
[1:06:18] and this all shall know that you are my
[1:06:40] but in reality we don't pay attention to
[1:06:43] it
[1:06:44] okay
[1:06:45] simple
[1:06:48] in these people we shall know that you
[1:06:50] are my disciples when you have loved one
[1:06:53] for another is
[1:07:01] that in that we have to gather even more
[1:07:04] so that we may become one
[1:07:07] because we are not divided
[1:07:11] in reality we are not divided
[1:07:15] it's the devil who's dividing us in our
[1:07:18] thinking
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:45] together
[1:08:02] you have to be like me no no
[1:08:05] something we are together Equity listen
[1:08:09] ERS
[1:08:12] the the appetite is not the same um we
[1:08:17] can all be hungry
[1:08:18] but they put food here
[1:08:21] this one has
[1:08:23] I'm hungry but I'm not I don't have
[1:08:26] really have an appetite foreign
[1:08:38] [Music]
[1:08:41] okay
[1:08:52] that's what happened in Christianity
[1:08:54] Christianity Christianity
[1:09:01] regardless of the differences in our
[1:09:04] organizations
[1:09:05] we are one no some um
[1:09:10] we are one because we are all children
[1:09:13] of God
[1:09:15] we are born by his Spirit
[1:09:18] Washed by his blood to clock you believe
[1:09:22] you are a son of God he believes is the
[1:09:25] Son of God
[1:09:26] and she believes she's a Son of God
[1:09:30] you you want to be believed that you are
[1:09:33] a son
[1:09:34] you also have to believe
[1:09:36] each one has its own experience
[1:09:44] that we are all tied to
[1:09:55] it was preached uh uh the the March 3rd
[1:09:59] March 13 1960.
[1:10:02] paragraph 40.
[1:10:08] do you know that God never made two men
[1:10:12] the same
[1:10:13] ground you that's why we'll find out
[1:10:15] that our God is a great God
[1:10:19] and to not believe God I can have been
[1:10:21] expected
[1:10:28] that there's no two people the same okay
[1:10:32] how a great God that we have
[1:10:43] there is not two of you in the whole
[1:10:46] world
[1:10:47] or it has never been members
[1:10:51] that's got the same thumbprint
[1:10:54] that's why today with science God was on
[1:10:57] plant with your fingerprint over the
[1:10:59] truth they can find it because you are
[1:11:02] unique
[1:11:03] cloud has made us each one unique
[1:11:09] oh don't try for me to be like you or
[1:11:12] you to be like
[1:11:15] imitation is of the devil
[1:11:20] God makes men different
[1:11:23] Ayla
[1:11:24] diverdo and he has diversity of gifts he
[1:11:28] lives and sends them to his church
[1:11:31] men are different
[1:11:33] gifts are different
[1:11:36] God sends them to his church listen to
[1:11:40] this carefully
[1:11:44] but we just cramped down on one and
[1:11:48] there you go dear what they don't
[1:11:50] different God sends different games
[1:11:53] oh I just like when that other one
[1:11:55] prayer you don't understand anything
[1:11:58] you understand that it's a prophet
[1:12:01] speaking
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:04] we just cramped down on one and there
[1:12:07] you go you see
[1:12:10] you don't get the wisdom of the spirits
[1:12:19] that's the reason God can place us into
[1:12:22] the position where we should be in his
[1:12:25] body
[1:12:26] for to one is
[1:12:30] given this sort of get of a gift and no
[1:12:34] to another tell yourself to the doctor
[1:12:36] this sort of a gift I ain't no to
[1:12:38] another tell us
[1:12:40] another sword of gifts and see the
[1:12:42] sweetness and so forth
[1:12:45] but all the same body
[1:12:52] there is not one finger that can wash
[1:12:55] the whole face
[1:13:21] you see young ministers when they start
[1:13:23] preaching Pastor he has a his Idol
[1:13:27] passage
[1:13:29] they try to preach like him and and then
[1:13:33] movements like him we are different
[1:13:36] you cannot get there
[1:13:40] you must use the wisdom of the word
[1:13:44] the Bible's words of blueprint is
[1:13:49] I have Ministries in my church
[1:13:52] I tell each one to be uh free the
[1:13:55] Precision
[1:14:27] to make it big so they can find out that
[1:14:30] they can show that they found something
[1:14:32] I said it's going to bring you to to to
[1:14:35] their pride
[1:14:39] we don't want to build the doctrine on
[1:14:42] one one paragraph We believe all the
[1:14:45] whole world
[1:14:47] we don't break up the word
[1:14:54] God made us different
[1:14:56] do you know that is no particularity God
[1:14:59] receives us with our differences
[1:15:02] that's the prophet speaking
[1:15:06] we have to accept one another
[1:15:10] sentence
[1:15:15] God gave you the Holy Ghost with the Way
[1:15:18] You Are
[1:15:35] who obeyed him
[1:15:38] I believe you you're following me
[1:15:41] for particularly he gave you the Holy
[1:15:44] Ghost with the way you are you believe
[1:15:47] you have it he gave us the way he is
[1:15:53] but you are fighting yes there's
[1:15:56] something that's not right
[1:16:00] no now
[1:16:02] excuse me
[1:16:03] forgive me
[1:16:08] okay
[1:16:38] we have to come to to recognize one
[1:16:41] another as brothers and sisters
[1:16:48] we are all working together for a great
[1:16:51] purpose
[1:16:52] it means for his kingdom
[1:16:55] particularity and our differences
[1:17:02] God is not paying attention to that
[1:17:08] a little downtrend and those little
[1:17:10] things that means nothing is
[1:17:17] then let's stay away from
[1:17:21] um
[1:17:22] the objectives that are
[1:17:25] um
[1:17:30] help him selfish motives and and things
[1:17:36] I'm going to continue on the uh the
[1:17:39] seventh Church the uh
[1:17:42] the seven Church ages
[1:17:44] event
[1:17:57] s
[1:18:00] Christianity has become like a maze
[1:18:07] with divided faith in little pieces
[1:18:12] if you don't see like me no
[1:18:15] no yes there's something that's not
[1:18:18] right
[1:18:22] and if you if you reject one of these
[1:18:25] parts would it considering come analytic
[1:18:27] you are considered as a heretic
[1:18:30] what should we do La Salle shows
[1:18:32] necessary the only thing that's
[1:18:35] important
[1:18:36] is to return to Christ
[1:18:40] look to Christ as the only Chief
[1:18:45] and walk in the footprint or in his face
[1:18:51] to live all other ways
[1:18:57] until the day that we will all come to
[1:19:00] the same objectives
[1:19:03] having realized the unity of the faith
[1:19:10] the same way that our Master Built
[1:19:12] everything on the foundation of the
[1:19:14] scriptures
[1:19:16] the message is built on the foundation
[1:19:24] and we have to be founded on the
[1:19:27] scriptures
[1:19:34] then we have to abandon all of this
[1:19:37] little things that are are bringing out
[1:19:39] in our confessions
[1:19:43] and to be satisfied with the revealed
[1:19:46] word
[1:19:47] and this revealed word
[1:19:52] none of us will process possesses all of
[1:19:55] it himself
[1:20:00] no one can say he has all of it and he
[1:20:04] knows how to just preach it and see then
[1:20:09] I will come back excuse me for a moment
[1:20:19] and then we have to abandon all our
[1:20:22] little differences in our confessions
[1:20:26] and to be satisfied with the revealed
[1:20:29] word
[1:20:31] that belongs to us all so massage this
[1:20:35] message
[1:20:36] it's not your message
[1:20:38] it's not the message
[1:20:40] it's a message of God and it belongs to
[1:20:44] all of us
[1:20:48] Bible in the hands
[1:20:51] we have to be crying out
[1:20:56] I believe what God has revealed in this
[1:20:59] book
[1:21:02] I will obey to his commandment in the
[1:21:06] submissive Spirit
[1:21:07] on Supremacy I put my hope in his
[1:21:11] promises
[1:21:20] there is only one life and life and and
[1:21:23] death comes upon us in many different
[1:21:25] ways there is only one life it's a word
[1:21:33] in thousand different ways
[1:21:41] there is only one Christ
[1:21:44] but the millions of an antichrists do
[1:21:49] you know all Christians
[1:21:51] what is the only necessary thing
[1:21:55] or you come back to Christ who's the
[1:21:58] world or you go to a destruction like
[1:22:02] the Antichrist situations if you are
[1:22:05] wise if you want to live
[1:22:09] follow the master of life
[1:22:12] that's my brother my sister said it's a
[1:22:17] little introduction
[1:22:20] I believe it's useful to each one of
[1:22:28] usage my message
[1:22:39] I I told my wife I said what he preached
[1:22:42] he said I remember I preached something
[1:22:43] like that in in 2011.
[1:22:47] I started looking at my notes
[1:22:52] because
[1:22:59] we'll only bring death
[1:23:09] I will speak a little bit on the law of
[1:23:12] reproduction
[1:23:13] I don't know if I'll have time the time
[1:23:16] passing the time is gone
[1:23:19] I'm sorry I was asking me for my County
[1:23:23] ministers
[1:23:25] I need about 30 minutes
[1:23:27] I'll say this in finishings
[1:23:31] I didn't bring what I had in mind
[1:23:36] I tell you my brother my sister because
[1:23:40] each one of us is different
[1:23:43] particularly taking the difference we
[1:23:46] have different uh we have different we
[1:23:50] have differences or things that makes us
[1:23:51] different from one another
[1:23:53] particularly God accepted you with the
[1:23:56] way you are
[1:23:58] accepted the other the way he is
[1:24:03] mindfulness
[1:24:05] and walk hand in hand
[1:24:08] because we are all saved by grace let's
[1:24:11] bow ahead
[1:24:13] foreign
[1:24:15] father
[1:24:19] is
[1:24:21] I believe it's what you wanted me to say
[1:24:25] I didn't even touch my message
[1:24:28] may your name be lifted up for that
[1:24:31] because
[1:24:33] that these things that were said in a
[1:24:35] manner where it was scattered out
[1:24:38] that you may place it in each heart of
[1:24:41] your children
[1:24:42] that you may have that we may have the
[1:24:44] right position
[1:24:46] and that we may have a consideration for
[1:24:48] one another bless our pastors bless the
[1:24:52] one that works with him bless this
[1:24:55] church
[1:24:56] there may be firmed in the scriptures
[1:25:00] they are constantly reading the prophet
[1:25:03] bless this church
[1:25:05] and give to each one of us
[1:25:08] a good Christian spirit
[1:25:12] that will bring us to love one another
[1:25:14] prove it to prove that we are your
[1:25:18] disciples if there is a need
[1:25:22] there's a situation in somewhere in the
[1:25:25] hearts of someone
[1:25:28] extend your hand over them bless them
[1:25:31] Benny lay bless them
[1:25:34] don't forget Billy who's trying to make
[1:25:37] an effort
[1:25:38] then we got called recovered that we may
[1:25:42] strengthen him in the name of Jesus
[1:25:44] Christ amen amen
[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:26:00] foreign
[1:26:09] I don't have my notes from last Sunday
[1:26:13] so God certainly makes us different
[1:26:16] you know but we have something that
[1:26:18] holds us together
[1:26:20] and that's an absolute
[1:26:22] kind Paul explained it like this he says
[1:26:25] if
[1:26:26] one be you know if all be the eye where
[1:26:29] would be the hearing or one would where
[1:26:31] would it all be but we're we're each
[1:26:34] members in particular fitted and joined
[1:26:37] together
[1:26:38] and and the the blood that runs through
[1:26:41] the body is the love of God
[1:26:44] and that love shed abroad in our hearts
[1:26:47] one for another
[1:26:49] and I I just feel that it's it's such a
[1:26:52] marvelous approach
[1:26:54] because when you think about it he
[1:26:57] called us different he called us from
[1:26:59] different places he called us from
[1:27:02] different walks of life so it lets us
[1:27:04] know how mindful he is of each of us
[1:27:09] and he tailored the gospel each one of
[1:27:12] us so we have a message
[1:27:16] but we each have a message
[1:27:19] and that's beautiful
[1:27:21] I love that I can go to this word and it
[1:27:24] speaks to me individually
[1:27:27] I love I can put on a tape
[1:27:29] and it talks to me individually
[1:27:32] I'm glad that I have a spirit that leads
[1:27:35] me in the walk
[1:27:37] that is set before me
[1:27:40] and it's not given to me to judge
[1:27:42] Another Man's Walk I thought of the
[1:27:46] scriptures when they asked the Lord you
[1:27:49] know what's going to be about him
[1:27:51] he said well what difference does it
[1:27:53] make if he tarries till I come you
[1:27:56] follow me
[1:27:57] amen it's a good attitude to have it's a
[1:28:00] good approach to have because you don't
[1:28:02] burden yourself down with all the false
[1:28:05] doctrines with all the false teachings
[1:28:07] with you don't have to carry that load
[1:28:10] you can love him
[1:28:13] you can walk with him you know who lives
[1:28:16] in your heart
[1:28:17] you know the book you read you know the
[1:28:20] voice that God sent you you stay true to
[1:28:23] that individually he'll play you like a
[1:28:27] great instrument and we'll all be
[1:28:29] playing the same song though we might be
[1:28:32] playing this different instruments but
[1:28:35] he's the great Orchestra and it'll all
[1:28:37] come together
[1:28:38] amen I think if we could keep that
[1:28:41] approach then we'll we'll never develop
[1:28:44] hatred or bitterness one to another
[1:28:46] because bitterness
[1:28:49] defiles the whole lump so let us know
[1:28:52] that God's been gifted his word and his
[1:28:56] son to each of us and let's great have
[1:28:58] that great respect let's stand together
[1:29:01] brother Cosman if you come and
[1:29:04] amen once again I want to encourage the
[1:29:07] Brethren to come out to the uh uh
[1:29:11] brother's breakfast and if you could all
[1:29:14] come out and I'm not saying that just
[1:29:16] because I have some work to do after it
[1:29:19] I I I do want you just to be there for
[1:29:22] the brothers breakfast and enjoy the
[1:29:25] Great Fellowship that we have together
