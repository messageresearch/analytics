but father i can look at the cross [Music] and i can read of what was accomplished there the greatest accomplishment in the world but lord we can say we know you what a great privilege to say that we know the person behind the name we know who he is and what he's done father we ask you to bless us this evening in your word in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles in return with me forgive me tonight you i'm a little not well but it's been so long since i've ministered here that someone asked me if i'd retired and i do i get retired every day but we've got a wonderful gospel and if you don't mind me just reading statements and and just going through the word of god with you i'm certainly not an evangelist and or a teacher but i i just love god's word and and we've been taking a journey through the sermons um uh wherever we started at and we've come upon this sermon and this sermon came upon my heart and i was reading uh out of it and then come to find out that it is the next sermon in line so we're going to study here for a little while and we're not going to really study the book or try to repreach brother banham's sermon but we're going to go through it and glean out if i could use that word not that we're capable but see and spend some time in the mighty riches that are hidden in the scripture how many of you my brother spoke of having a bible i like having a bible and you know you start marking it out and then you start using blue and then you start using red and yellow and pretty soon your pages are falling out and you read it and it's like you've never read it before and i feel that way with the word of god you grow up a little bit you know and i like taste of things now that i hated when i was a child but i loved to grow this scripture had a tremendous effect on me and i'd like to share it with you this evening and it's found in 2 thessalonians the 3rd chapter and the 5th verse and and so i won't be able to preach but i i'd just like to testify i was going to try to get brother bill uh zlad off to come and testify but then i got to thinking he'd tell so many stories about me that he might ruin my ministries but anyway it's again it's so nice to have brother wade and sister heidi and bill and marcy with us and i see my other friend there it's so good to see them and so lord bless you i'd like to just read this scripture and then fellowship with you on it and the lord direct your heart into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ father we ask you to bless your word in jesus precious name we pray amen you may be seated i read this scripture and it touched my heart and then i went to a different bible and and they i think they call it the new king james and the new american standard and they took this scripture and they changed it in a way that i thought that they missed really what was being spoken and i realized that they missed it because they it they don't have the key that we have to understand the scriptures that came to us through the word of god of our generation and they reworded it in a way that it said this and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god or god's love and into the patience of christ and they put the emphasis on the patience and not the waiting and so he said that and so he says may the lord direct your heart so this is something that uh paul is telling us that we need to be led to okay it is a not an attribute but it's a place or a position it's a it's something that that we've got to have so he's not talking about having patience he's talking about something completely different and as we begin to read this place i'd like this to start and maybe you could pull this up along and we could read it together um i i feel it's very important to when you talk about the word of god to be established in the word of god because the word of god is not letter the word of god is the present tense voice of jesus christ speaking to you to where you are at at the moment so you can never look at the word of god as letter because the letter killeth but when you look at it as spirit then it brings life and so now you have something that you can read and it it's not trying to set forth an order of doctrine or to set forth some sort of moral code but it's something that now it can speak to you move you and direct you so the word of god doesn't become a study it becomes a living leadership and that's why through the ages it could lead you through the ages and it doesn't matter you can get away from the word of god you can change your lifestyle situations can change you can get into all these different places but the minute that you come back into contact with the word of god it's going to start directing you to the love of god because it's living and that's what he is he's a shepherd so he's going out to find you and if you get away what does he do he leaves the 99 he comes back and he finds you and now he's going to start directing you so you've got to understand even when we come to church to fellowship we're not coming to study we're coming to be directed we're coming to have the holy spirit leadership in our life guide us into all truth and righteousness i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again and i'll be with you and i'll lead you and guide you and direct you into all truth and righteousness now he's saying may god direct you and lead you into the love of god why is that important to us because we know that's the final part of the church of the living god is the capstone of love i got to cut my inspiration because i'm going to fall over so he wants to direct us someplace so god is trying to direct his church to a place so all the attributes that we have the spirit the fruits of the spirit of of joy peace patience love all the attributes all the fruits of the spirit we're not talking about those we're talking about having those and then taking those to a place or a position so you i'm trying to make a distinction because he's not talking about having patience he's talking about leading us to the to into the patient waiting so the patient waiting is a place it's a position it's some place we have to go so let's just look at it here as the title of my sermon to deceiving is called the condemnation test the test of condemnation not a negative thing but the positive things that god has given uh given to us uh so uh as as we uh look at this this evening if we could turn we we will see that we want to turn to this place this message here it's called god's provided place of worship so i want you to look at that as it's a place just like this is a place or spring creek is a place it's a place that you can go and dwell it's actually an existence okay and now there's things that we can that we can determine whether we're in that existence or not whether we're there and i want to make sure i'm there i don't want a religious uh deception i i don't want the foolishness of man i don't want to join a church i don't want to join a cult i don't want to join a denomination but i want to know that i'm sitting at the table and supping with him because he said in this day behold i stand at the door and knock and any man that opens up i will come in and i will sup with him that is a place it's a position it's something that's not real that's real so let us read this if you could find this it's paragraph 27 and he's talking here when he reads this message he's reading out of deuteronomy where he talks about that the place that i put my name and we will go through that portion of it another day but we're laying the foundation for the study or the furtherance of the word of god and how the scripture moved on me he said deuteronomy this is the 24th a paragraph says deuteronomy being a greek word that means two laws the word deuteronomy god has two laws and one of them is the law of death to to disobedience to his word we find that when eve disobeyed his word it brought death that's one of the laws the day that you eat thereof that day you die and when he and then he has another law which is the law of life to obedience if you do if you don't do such a thing like keeping his word you'll live so it boils down to two things in my way of thinking that's either keeping his word or disobeying his word you can't create an option around that it's two things keep his word is life disobey his word is death you can't scheme with god and paul said would we sin that grace might abound god forgive so we're we're talking as we're moving through this word we're trying to come to this understanding today that god has given us a place and he wants to get us all there it's like all going to the same restaurant together and sitting down and feasting on the word together so it's not us one being here and one being there but he's saying there's a place i provided a place that you can all gather and all be won and all be fed and we want to find that place so he says here he says one of these laws was given at mount sinai and the other law that's the law of death and the other law was given at mount calvary and the law of life was given through christ jesus he also had two covenants he had a covenant with adam the first man on earth and that covenant was on condition if you do so and so i will do so and so adam would had something to do in order to keep this covenant alive before god he had to walk in god's way keeping all of his word and not breaking one word so adam's existence in the garden was based on if he stayed this and didn't break one word well we know that didn't happen right he said how do i know that didn't happen because here i is he did but then he made another covenant and that was with abraham so we're talking about this place you understand now the first thing that god has got to deal with before he can get you to this place is your mind because that's where the battle is so basically we need to get out of our mind when someone says you're out of your mind you ought to say praise god that's what i've been trying to do i've been trying to lose my mind [Applause] it's where the battle is you create your own enemy in your mind you create in your mind something that you are not and then you let it torment you i want the mind of christ i want what he thinks about me that's what i want i only want to dwell on what he has done for me because that's truth and what sets you free it's truth that sets you free i'm sorry i might get going preaching a long time i don't preach so long this feels so good he said he said he said but he made another covenant and that was with abraham and this covenant was not on condition but was unconditional god gave the covenant to err abraham no strings tied to it at all unconditional not i will but i have it's already done it that's what he said here i've already done it he was now sharing the covenant with abraham thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy i've already finished it he said now listen to this verse 31 and that's the law that christians must live by now we're talking about a place a position a place that you live by this law it's what governs your life a law is a governing force that governs your life because of sin we're under the law of gravity but when you get from this eden which is satan's eden over into the original eden there's a whole other set of laws that governs it and you'll be able to travel in a thought you'll be able to speak worlds into existence and go live on them whole glory even so come quickly lord jesus he said now that's the law christian must live by it's not what we do ourselves but what he has done for us christ has already been sacrificed not he will be but has been and we're not looking for him to do a work it's already done we're not looking for him to come down and bring us heaven we're already sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus we're already possessing the gates of the enemy we're already possessing eternal life in other words if you've have eternal life you've always had it so he wants to get to the believer to the place where they can live knowing that they possess eternal life and it's not something that's a will be but it's a something that is we need to move past the will be i don't want to be a willaby and i don't want to be a wannabe i want to be a has been right the old man has passed away i'm a new creature in christ jesus there's a place that we're talking about he says that's the law of christ it is it's been he he said it's not will be it has been it's a finished product he lived died and rose again ascended into heaven and has come back in the form of the holy ghost so it's a finished work with god christ knowing no sin became my sin that i might stand in his place he took my place that i might stand in his place so where he was standing sinless right where he was standing knowing that he come from god and went to god where he was standing the father hath given all things into my hands where that place that he was he became us that we might become him that we might stand in that place in that position now why i don't know why we doubt you know why we doubt because there's a line snail devil that one day we've got to con get the courage to say get behind me satan well you were yet sinners he died for you because he had to pay for what you're going to be not what you were he said if it's a finished work god finished work with god it's a finished work with god so he already knows right christ knowing no sin became my sin that i might stand in his place he took my place i was in him at calvary and when he died there i must die with him to live because the law of sin and death is in my body we have to die to be reconciled to him beautiful thing so what do you have to die to you have to die to the covenant of i have to do this it's hard to accept the gift now let's just turn quickly over to paragraph 35. there's a whole lot in between that but i'm just trying to get to my thought to lay this down just this evening about this place that we're invited to we have the ticket so we just got to get on the journey that's right it says now this is this 35 and this world must soon come to an end it can't go much longer sin is too deep it's beyond hope there is no more hope for the world it's past that now i know we sit here and we read that and say this is 65 why are we here we're going to talk about that just in a moment i believe the holy spirit is gleaning in the field finding this one and that one for the hour is far spent the gospel has been preached to every nation and things has followed it but yet the gospel has went on just the same there's only one true gospel it was the gospel that was preached with the promise of the baptism of the holy spirit with the promise of a place and a position that the believer could live in and serve god there's been all kinds of bogus denominations all kinds of bogus teachings all kinds of men rising up to share the glory of god there's been all kinds of schemes that says if you do this if you do that you do this you live by this you follow me you give one of the biggest lies that's ever been preached is the prosperity gospel give me money i will bless you and make you love the world more you can drive a better car live in a better house my goodness i'm tired of this house i'm tired of this house he said but the gospels went on just the same and now at the end time we see the things happening the way they are there's a great warning amongst the elect people of god to find what is right there's a great warning amongst the people of god to find what's right that's what's going on in your heart what's right we don't want to accept this message in any alternative form or motive or objective this message is not to give us something to follow it's to give us eternal life and the revelation of jesus christ and what he was in the beginning the true word of god he says and it behooves us to know that so there's we're at the end and there's some we see things happening the way they are because there's a great warning amongst the elect people of god define what's right that's why we see the things happening that are happening it's supposed to be a warning to us to get right now get right i'm not talking about cleaning up your life i'm talking about getting to the right place the right position the right relationship with god in his word john said no man can love the world in the things of the world and still love god the love of god is not in them so we're not talking about quitting smoking drinking the temptations of the flesh we're talking about god has provided a place for us a position of rest come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i'll give you rest i'll give you joy unspeakable i'll give you peace that surpasses understanding so we're talking about a place and here he says that god that the lord direct your hearts into the love of god into the patient waiting for christ so he's telling us there's a place there's a position there's a land that we've been invited to be in because that's the launch place that's where we want to find ourselves so what we're talking about is that place he says and it behooves us to know that so it behooves us to know that god has trained you to direct us to a place a peace of mind a piece of spirit a patient waiting he said but he said he behooves us to know that now not somebody's theory but to know what is truth what the bible says is the truth because it will be too late one of these days for us and this may be the day so let's take real consideration of what god has said boy we really i think we ought to take real consideration about what this message is and what's in it and what he's trying to tell us in other words it's it's not a theory oh i believe everything brother branham said i believe this quote i believe that quote wait a minute that's not what he's talking about he's talking about a place a position a condition a reality a possession that the believer must find and the reason he gave the message was so that the message was the only thing that could lead us to that place because satan got this book and told millions of lies from it so people got the book but now somebody's come to reveal the author [Applause] so that you can know the author of the book and when you have a re-personal relation with the author of the book he will reveal to you what it is he meant when he wrote the book amen do you love god's word remember he said and so one of these days be too late for us and this may be the day so let's take real consideration of what god has said remember when god speaks a word he can never take it back it has to ever remain the same he can never say something and say well i didn't exactly mean that that's why he's got to bring to pass what he said that's what makes him the own interpreter of his word aren't you glad you're a part of that well don't you understand that god is going to interpret you [Music] oh god would you please reveal what you had in mind when you made me because i look in the mirror and i think you didn't even know what you're doing come on but he said i'll bring you into obedience and i'll show you who you are you'll learn of me by obedience and by the things you suffer that's what god wants he don't want church members he wants sons and daughters well i didn't exactly mean that see he's infinite he knows the best to begin with we say things that we think is best then after a while we take it back man that cut me to a car someone told me they i listened to a sermon that you preached in 2014 i just sat there and shuddered i'd hate to listen to something i preached in 2014. i sure hope i moved on but god can't do that and remain god so if he's infinite he does not do that because he is perfect in every word we utter he never utters a word unless it's eternal all of his eternal all of his eternals was with him at the beginning his thoughts his attributes and there's only one expressing and they're only expressing themselves in the world today hello expression of god now remember he has a provided place one place alone where he'll meet the believing children anywhere else won't work now think of this place okay so are you am i are we making ourselves clear that we're talking about a place that exists call it a state of mind i don't care call it a a realm that's fine it's hard to come up with words but it's an eternal existence where we become part of eternity and it's not where we're going it's where we are we get there before we get there so we're there and one day it becomes a reality and then we step from this mind and this body right into that place but he's given us a foretaste of glory divine he starts to share that place with us am i out of my mind it's wonderful [Music] it hasn't even entered into the thoughts of man the things that god's prepared for them that love them that's why he said we're already sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus it exists now but we need the word of god to i save to cleanse our minds and of our unbelief and bring us to the realization of the position and the place that we're in in christ jesus let me get my breath so this place this place is the lord jesus christ i am the way the truth the life no man cometh to the father but by being in me i will not leave you without me but i will come again and i'll be with you even in you [Music] now you might not feel that you're in this that place but you are in that place because he's already spoke it but what's the word of god for to give us i sav that we might see to give us gold that's tried in fire a christ-like character and to give us clothing that we will not be ashamed so that we can see we can be clothed and we can have character because without that character we can't live in that place so he's trying to get us to where we can comfortably live in that place without condemnation so another so this place is jesus christ now it's not a belief i believe in the godhead i believe in this i believe in that i believe in the baptism the holy spirit those are all biblical facts in other words jesus is more real to me than george washington [Music] i never saw the cherry tree stump but i saw that i meant the man that hung there who's the guy that's supposed to throw the dollar across the river or something well yeah might as well have he's as good as anybody else just one more lie was it abraham lincoln that never told a lie now who in the face of the bible when the bible says all men come into the world speaking lies would try to have the testimony he never told the lie lie that's a lie right there he's the father of lies and there's no truth in him so let we we're trying to establish this place because it's not religion religion is teachings about this place you can be religious without ever being in the place so it's like looking at pictures of food on the internet and licking your chops well that's a good restaurant well that looks good but you never tasted it you never been there come on i went to some of them places got the best reputation in the world and i wouldn't feed it to my dog praise god i don't got a dog because he wouldn't live long so it's it's it's not a belief or a history a historical acknowledgement it's not acknowledging that jesus was or what he did if i confess that i'm a sinner and i acknowledge that jesus christ did something in the past you're saved what a lie no you're saved when you enter in to his rest i will give you rest i'll provide for you a place that you can rest i will provide a place for you i will direct direct you to a place to a position where you can patiently wait amen for christ not only in his returning but in his patient revelation of himself to you waiting for his time lord direct me to the place that i can wait on you to reveal yourself i can wait for you to transform me i can wait for the seed in me to grow through its growing process and bring forth the fruit oh god hallelujah that place exists i believe he's revealing it he said not a historical acknowledgement not a moral code or a religious culture that's what we've got in this message today not the true message but the idea of the message has become a religious culture the message is an experience it was a prophet that had an experience the real experience of the revealed word for our day because he had come into contact with deity and that deity came and dwelt in him and therefore he was the first fruit of someone that had come into that place and it was waved out over the people so that we could look and live so it's not a religious culture culture is something that is taught it's not inherited so we don't want the culture of having long hair and the culture of having long dresses and the culture of not wearing makeup and the culture of doing this and the culture of doing that amen but we want it to be the fruit of whom that we've meant because you can do all those things and not be in this place but so we want to talk about this place so what is that place but it's a present tense union with his indwelling presence and person it's a union an invisible union it's a union you have total confidence total rest so it's it's a presence with this person it's a place or a position okay now so he wants to bring us to that place and we'll talk about that more but we sit here and we say he said that in 65 why are we still here because we're a memorial to what that he did on calvary he came to redeem a bride is that correct and that bride is a memorial to what that he did if the bride never comes into existence free from sin and dwelling in this place then calvary didn't work if he never sent the comforter or returned into the holy spirit so the holy spirit is in some place you go the holy spirit came to direct you and lead you into all truth and righteousness he came to direct you and to lead you to the place that was already in you in his thoughts in his word from beginning to the eternal life that was already in you he's got to lead you through the jungle of your mind he's got to lead you through the harvest fields of your flesh and the things that you've sowed and you've reaped he's got to lead you through all the confusion of the lying devil and the deceit of this world and the deception of the eye and the deception of the census and the deception of the realms of emotion until he can bring you to that created place of inward peace that's in you the place where you can worship him it's a a place that he wants us to go and so we're a memorial that that place exists the works that i do you shall do also there's a place not attributes you take all these attributes to that place silver and gold have i none but that which i possess i give to you and we just want to know am i there it behooves us to know what's right it behooves us to take into consideration it behooves us to quit looking at circumstances and what our loved ones has done and look at the possibility that god has for them in his mind so in order for something to be a memorial it has to be tested it's got to be proved so it can't be just a claim it can't be a claim my peace i give to you my joy i give to you it can't remain on paper he can't leave it on paper you understand he can't fail he can't promise an elect lady because he can't take that word back he can't take it back he can't say oh i'm going to make it different that's when he wiped out the world he had to carry that seat over oh she wouldn't be here he can't take it back he can't take it back my sheep will hear my voice he can't take it back they'll enter into my rest he can't take it back they'll have gold tried in fire he can't take it back that behold i knock and if they open i'll come in and sup with them none of it can be taken back how does he prove his word by predestinating a people to be there that will receive it but a memorial must be tested it's got to be a time-tested memorial prophet of god in time tested memorial a guy said well if this be the truth then let snakes come out of my grave what do you think happened just like the tree falling on the truck there's snakes that come out of the grave so why do we have to endure these 50 years because abraham had to endure noah had to endure they became time-tested memorials the children of israel had to endure every person that has received what god has promised has to endure the memorial of the test of time now and into the patient waiting for christ that to the the place if i could say it this way so it's not the attribute of patience but a position a place a position of rest a place where you know you are where god wants you to be it's where i he wants me to be i'm about my father's business i'm not worried that's right whether i'm right or wrong a place where you're happy and content and at peace to wait on this soon return it's like being in the station with the ticket in your hand knowing the train is going to arrive any minute my wife wants me to get to that place because i say do you have my wallet do you have my phone you have the ticket do you have the passport you have my global entry card yes dear yes dear yes dear we get out of the car do you have our tickets do you have our plan yes dear well how long do you think i'm going to take yes dear finally give it to me and i take it in my hand i have my ticket i have my passport i have my global entry i have my seat with my name on it and i make sure she has hers because i want to take her with me i don't want it second hand and i trust her never giving me a reason to doubt her but i still like to know it for my self i want to know that i've come to that place so it's it's a place where we're happy paul said in philippians 4 11 i've learned no matter whatever state i am to be content and so we come to that place that position and now i'm going to just preach my sermon for 10 minutes and then we'll have a long communion night and then you can catch that four o'clock fight in the morning you'll be able to sleep the whole way because all things work together for good to them that love the lord so there's let's talk about something that goes on in that place how can we test whether we're in that place or not how can we be at peace that we're in that place and that's why we call this the condemnation test so if you're not there there's something going on in your life the very life you're living is condemning you and you feel that tension and that knot at peace but he says now when you come into this place and that place is christ and first corinthians 12 says by one spirit we are all baptized into one body paragraph 100 of the same message now after you're in this body in this place in this position when you're in this body romans 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus that are in this place think of it if you have to you're in this restaurant you're in this building you're in this existence once you get in there there's total peace there's no condemnation there's no way trying to figure a way out or in or to leave it and try to figure a way you can get back in there's no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there is the place where there is no condemnation there is a place where there's no condemnation where you're not hating yourself where you know how to deal with your flesh there is a place you hear them there is a place that there's no condemnation whether you go to a methodist baptist presbyterian church wherever it is if you are in christ you are a new creature and there is no condemnation in you nowhere at all boy i start to think about all the things that are bugging me could it be that they're bugging me because they don't belong in that place the test of condemnation condemnation is not a bad thing it's it's a a good thing mark i think it's 16 or so talks of it he says there there's and there is no condemnation in you nowhere at all that's god's meeting place that's the place he wants to be that's the place he wants to meet you that's where god meets the worshiper there is where you you are accounted a new creature for they're dead to the things of the world they're alive in him the living presence of god is with them day by day may the spirit direct you your hearts into the love of god amen what he's trying to get us to do get us to where we love god above all the things of the world above our own families above our own friends jesus said i have not come to you and i but i've come to divide if you don't love father mother home place more than me you have no part in me now don't take this negative because condemnation is not condemnation you understand there's a difference between being condemned and being convicted he says he lives in them through every age every age he comes along down through the bible and when man meets god's requirement comes into the place to where he provided in his written word for that day god makes that person to be a new creature and he has no condemnation look at job so he's he's trying to direct our hearts to a place where we can wait for his soon coming and for his revelation and for his further revealing in us but how can we test that what comes along because if anything comes along and gives us condemnation or an uneasy feeling or that voice speaks within us this isn't right praise god that's the test that we're leaving that place for where there's condemnation we're not walking in the spirit for there's no condemnation for them that walk in the spirit and not after the flesh so the minute we start walking after the flesh the test of condemnation comes condemnation tests that place you know while we said oh oh i don't this don't feel right to me you take that drink you feel that condemnation then we know that's not the place you smoke that cigarette you feel that condemnation you know that's a place thank god for condemnation because what's the holy spirit come to do it's come to convict men of unbelief amen it's come to give you condemnation when something is taking you outside the word of god it's the test of condemnation condemnation has been given to us yes as a testing tool to know whether we're in the spirit or not whether you're going to take what he said or not i know what it's like to be on a fishing boat and be the only guy there and a pair of pants why don't you have a pair of bermudas you need a pair of bermudas i got a knife i can cut those off for you if i cut those things off i would leave my place you think i'm going to leave my place for a bunch of bullies i say no the lord wants me to wear these and i'm not ashamed because blessed is he who is not ashamed in me blessed is he who is not offended i'm not offended of the place that god wants me to be and if i start to leave that place there is a spirit of condemnation that meets me there and i know there's no condemnation to them who are in christ praise god for the test look at job but look job regardless of how many people tried to condemn him how many said he was wrong he was keeping the commandments of god by that burn offering he knowed he was justified because he was keeping the commandments of god that's how he was justified because he was doing the things that god wanted him to do just think of that can you imagine being in a place where that spirit can't nag you or bug you or there's no doubt there's rest may god direct your heart into the love of god amen into the patient waiting waiting for him to reveal himself in you and to live in you and to come soon to you and thank god there's condemnation in our heart because if god condemns us he's greater than our heart we could i guess we could read that if we wanted to first john the third chapter and the 20th verse let's just read that as we close this evening first john what was it i i just had it here if i could yeah first john 3 and and 20. my little 18th verse my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth may god lead you into the love of god may god direct your hearts to the love of god and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our hearts condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards god the test of condemnation what couldn't eve do right we're talking about being led into the place where we can wait for christ wait for him to do his word wait for it to unfold knowing we're where he wants us to be at perfect rest and peace where we are now you see the seed this is eve now you see the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of god through the spoken word she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait you don't think there's something to being directed to the patient waiting place notice in this bride what did she do then her first child come forth it was a bastard child and he was full of death and caused death this is from the spoken word as the original seed and caused death and everyone since then is dead now you see it it had to be sex why you dying if it wasn't sex when god gave a commission which cannot perish god's word is eternal it cannot fail and when he said multiply and replenish the earth that was god's eternal purpose to carry that out you could not die because it's his word you have to live and if a child had been brought forth right there had been no death but she couldn't wait that's what's the matter today you want some kind of phony makeup with screaming jumping speaking in tongues or something instead of waiting for the real word of god to be made manifest through the bride wow that's why satan could get to her because there was something in there that was true now you know why cell phones are of the devil well you all got one sure think of where all our lives would be if we all chucked them amen amen how free we would be only living in the place no condemnation that's how satan could get to her because there was something in there that wanted to come forth and that's why we need the spirit to direct us to the patient waiting we need to understand that condemnation is there to protect us and to keep us in that place and if we ever step into that realm of condemnation we can give life the condemnation test does this condemn me do i feel that holy unction of the spirit can i get away from the place where i make excuses and make decisions or can i accept the condemnation test i thank god that the spirit condemns sin when it comes in our life and i know when i feel that condemnation i feel that failure that failure doesn't tell me i'm lost it tells me there's a place where there is no condemnation that i can live life and life more abundant the wonderful holy spirit amen god bless you let's stand and open our bibles the brothers we go prepare communion amen cosmic why don't you come here and read the scriptures so would you come and read here from corinthians 11th chapter and the 23rd verse and read those scriptures the brothers if you would get the communion together and read those for i received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eat it and drink it damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with this world wherefore my brethren when he come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come do you see it there's no condemnation in this place examine yourself if there's condemnation get that place out of your life and come into the place where you can have communion with the lord god bless you heavenly father we ask you to bless this bread that represents the body that was broken for us that we could enter into a place where there's no condemnation because you took sin upon you and you've provided us this place that we can worship that's what we're communing father we're communing in the place where we're free because of calvary lord we ask you to bless this wine which represents the blood that was shed on our behalf and that the life that was in that blood could return back onto the believer and stimulate them and lead them into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ we asked that this evening father that we would enjoy this communion and fellowship in our freedom and liberty that we have in christ jesus yes in your name we pray amen amen aren't you glad to take communion with other believers of light prayer
