[30:56] father
[31:00] Lord the enemy spends all his time and
[31:03] his effort to discredit the word of
[31:08] God to give us some alternative or some
[31:12] other
[31:15] way to draw a picture
[31:19] that is the one that he wants us to
[31:23] see but by your grace and your Spirit we
[31:27] see you standing in your
[31:30] word all powerful and
[31:33] true never
[31:37] failing always there on our
[31:40] behalf we're so grateful for that this
[31:43] evening father we've come to have
[31:45] communion and foot washing this evening
[31:51] to Fellowship one with another bear one
[31:54] another's
[31:56] burdens to serve one another and
[31:59] encourage us along the
[32:01] way father we ask that you be with us
[32:04] tonight as we
[32:06] partake in this time of Fellowship
[32:09] together we ask you to forgive us our
[32:11] trespasses Lord forgive us the sins that
[32:15] so easily beset us father forgive us our
[32:19] unbelief father and all that you've
[32:21] showed us yet so many times we're
[32:25] hesitant and we're filled with doubt
[32:28] father we ask that you not lay it to our
[32:31] charge tonight father but look on our
[32:34] hearts that we here this evening father
[32:37] to worship and praise you we ask you to
[32:41] bless us this evening in this great time
[32:43] of Fellowship in Jesus precious and
[32:47] wonderful name we pray amen and amen
[32:52] hallelujah Lord richly bless you you may
[32:54] be seated for a moment this evening uh
[32:57] we're going to go uh right into
[33:00] communion here uh pretty quick uh uh uh
[33:05] it it never seems to um uh fail that
[33:12] every time that we quote that statement
[33:15] or uh we listen to it on tape where the
[33:18] prophet of God says you can have the
[33:21] Holy Spirit every day of your life and
[33:24] still go to hell that it doesn't raise a
[33:27] lot of questions so I I was going to
[33:30] talk a little bit about it this evening
[33:32] but I thought maybe that I would address
[33:35] it um maybe a little more in detail but
[33:41] uh um but you know it's
[33:44] also when you begin to think of it that
[33:47] God died for all the sins of the world
[33:50] everybody sins are
[33:52] forgiven but not everybody accepts it
[33:56] and you know when you just realize you
[33:59] see people all through life they'll take
[34:01] a portion of God's word and they'll
[34:04] believe that portion and the blessings
[34:07] that are with that portion of the word
[34:10] will be upon them because the word of
[34:12] God carries an anointing and so people
[34:16] that believe a portion of the word they
[34:18] reap that portion 40
[34:21] 6080
[34:23] 100% and uh but yet um we don't compare
[34:28] ourselves to the world or the rest of
[34:30] the world we understand that we're
[34:32] called for a special purpose amen we're
[34:35] called for the full
[34:37] manifestation of the Bride word in this
[34:40] day to to line up to it all by his grace
[34:44] and by his spirit so uh we do that you
[34:49] know communion is a special time too
[34:52] because it it uh gives us a chance to
[34:57] identify with Calvary and and what that
[35:01] he did and the fact that his word is is
[35:05] food for our soul and his blood has life
[35:10] and it and that blood was shed for us
[35:13] that that life that was in that blood
[35:15] could return back upon us we before the
[35:19] blood of go bulls and goats they would
[35:21] just act as a covering that's right but
[35:24] actually the blood of the Lord Jesus
[35:26] Christ takes that completely off our
[35:28] record amen not to not be remembered
[35:32] anymore and sometimes we remember it but
[35:36] he doesn't amen amen and and that's why
[35:41] he died but we were yet sinners amen he
[35:44] died for us so it that's the Great
[35:46] Fellowship that we have tonight in him
[35:50] is that that uh even though we still
[35:55] carry a lot of our human
[35:57] uh uh traits that he's covered all of it
[36:03] amen and that's what he says and if we
[36:06] are faithful and just to confess our
[36:08] sins he's faithful and just to forgive
[36:11] them and and the prophet of God put it
[36:14] this way he said if you put red through
[36:17] red there's nothing nothing remains
[36:21] there's nothing that comes through that
[36:23] so uh this evening you could maybe think
[36:26] of all the
[36:27] reasons um why we shouldn't take
[36:31] communion why we shouldn't have foot
[36:33] watching you know I can list a a a ton
[36:37] of reasons why I'm unworthy to go to
[36:40] heaven I'm not worthy to go to heaven
[36:44] but I didn't earn my way to
[36:46] heaven I'm not presenting every anything
[36:50] to him saying Lord I did this let me in
[36:55] no I I'm it's by his Mercy Lord I'm here
[36:59] you called me you tugged on my heart
[37:03] you've uh you've let me see it I was
[37:05] ordained to see it I I I looked at it I
[37:09] saw it it was there I couldn't I
[37:13] couldn't deny what I've seen something
[37:16] inside of my heart believes it I didn't
[37:19] come to that conclusion you put it there
[37:22] you know if you wanted to go for
[37:24] reasoning nobody in their right mind
[37:27] would believe that God sent Elijah the
[37:31] prophet in this day I mean they read the
[37:33] scripture many will come and do this and
[37:36] that and they they write it off no it's
[37:39] not logical to believe in Divine Healing
[37:42] it's not logical to believe that that
[37:45] God would choose
[37:46] you but he did and and we're based on
[37:51] faith we're not based on reasoning I I
[37:55] read quite a little article
[37:57] about
[37:58] evidence there's there's in the legal
[38:02] field there's two types of evidence
[38:05] there's
[38:06] factual evidence and then there's uh uh
[38:11] spoken evidence in other words if
[38:13] someone gives a
[38:15] testimony and then and they say well I
[38:18] saw this I saw that that that's a form
[38:21] of evidence that's not factual evidence
[38:24] but if someone would present some
[38:26] factual evidence that but maybe I said
[38:29] you know I saw brother Tommy uh Rob that
[38:33] 7-Eleven the other day you know what I
[38:36] mean I know it was him and I I saw him
[38:41] well and I'm presenting that as evidence
[38:44] well that's evidence well you know
[38:46] somebody would have to come up with
[38:48] factual evidence to prove that wasn't
[38:51] true you know what I mean and then a
[38:54] couple of the brothers stand up and say
[38:55] no Brother D baby you didn't see Tommy
[38:58] uh we were out camping with Tommy and he
[39:00] freezing cold out there and raining and
[39:03] miserable and we are all out camping
[39:06] with him well now you got
[39:08] facts right to disprove the other
[39:11] evidence they're both presented as
[39:14] evidence but one's not factual evidence
[39:16] so you've got to
[39:18] disprove evidence that's not
[39:21] factual with the facts with factual
[39:25] evidence it's you
[39:27] it is what it is well for us the gospel
[39:30] is factual evidence amen it's not here
[39:34] say it's fact amen and we believe it
[39:37] just the way it is and we've seen it
[39:40] come to pass we've seen it do it how
[39:42] many knows God's A Healer all right so
[39:45] so many of you believe that God's A
[39:47] Healer how many know it by experience
[39:51] hallelujah amen now who can take that
[39:54] away from you
[39:57] amen how many knows what it's like to
[40:00] have the burden of sin lifted off your
[40:03] life amen now a lot of people believe it
[40:08] but they they don't possess it right the
[40:11] evidence of it and and so it's it's just
[40:16] like to me
[40:18] someone I I I don't care whether they
[40:21] believe that God sent a prophet or not I
[40:23] know he did I mean I've seen it I I put
[40:26] a quote up there where he actually talks
[40:29] about men wanting to be women
[40:31] 1964 and now we look around it and see
[40:34] that black cloud and we see they're
[40:36] helpless they can't help themselves they
[40:38] make statements that are absolutely
[40:42] idiotic it comes out of their mouth and
[40:45] you think what are you what are you
[40:47] doing how can you say such a thing as
[40:50] that you know what I mean and can you
[40:53] look at them and you realize they can't
[40:55] help themselves
[40:57] because the word was spoken and the one
[41:00] thing about the word of God is it will
[41:02] never come back void you can count on it
[41:06] Hallelujah you can count on it no matter
[41:09] how Satan tries to draw a different
[41:12] picture no matter how he tries to rob it
[41:15] from you you can anchor in that word
[41:18] that's how it is going to be it might
[41:22] not be that way tomorrow but we know
[41:25] it'll be that way and it's because God
[41:27] said so and that settles it and that's
[41:31] what the church is built on it's built
[41:33] on the word of God and by experience and
[41:36] the more that you go along in life the
[41:39] more you find out you save yourself a
[41:42] lot of trouble if you just stay with the
[41:46] Simplicity of God's word you don't have
[41:50] to understand it all but I'll tell you
[41:53] it really counts to believe it all so I
[41:57] I just trust that you love the the Lord
[41:59] tonight uh we're just going to go right
[42:02] into our communion service tonight and
[42:05] ask the Lord to bless us so if you have
[42:08] your Bibles let us stand together if the
[42:10] brothers would go uh prepare the
[42:15] communion and we'll take our communion
[42:18] service at this time you know this is a
[42:21] good time
[42:22] that that you can purpose in your your
[42:26] heart to make something right if
[42:29] something comes on your mind or on your
[42:32] heart as you come up maybe something
[42:35] that you remember the scripture teaches
[42:37] us that you that you you purpose it in
[42:40] your heart and then that you're going to
[42:43] take care of that thing he said then let
[42:45] them come eat of of that table if you've
[42:48] offended somebody and and uh uh then you
[42:53] just purpose in your heart I'm going to
[42:55] go make that right I'm going to ask that
[42:57] person to forgive me and and you go
[43:00] ahead and and and do that but it's a
[43:03] good time to communion is a good time
[43:06] and foot washing is is a good time of
[43:10] rededication of your life to the Lord
[43:13] I'm going to going to dedicate my life
[43:16] I'm going to get back on track I'm I'm
[43:19] going to apply the token I'm going to
[43:22] get rid of some of the things I'm
[43:24] doing I'm going to do better foot
[43:27] washing is a good time to purpose in
[43:29] your heart
[43:30] to expand the Realms of your fellowship
[43:34] maybe somebody that you haven't spent
[43:36] any time with say I'm going to call that
[43:38] person I'm going to go I'm going to
[43:39] spend some time with them I'm going to
[43:42] try to get to know them better uh you
[43:45] know it maybe a opportunity you to wash
[43:48] somebody else's feet that you've never
[43:50] wash before you know not just get
[43:53] somebody that already knows what your
[43:54] feet look like you know what I mean but
[43:58] uh somebody that you don't mind showing
[44:00] your ugly feet too and uh
[44:04] uh have them washed so anyway well let
[44:08] let us just let us just read here now as
[44:12] we read in of 1 Corinthians the 11th
[44:17] chapter starting at the
[44:20] 203d
[44:23] verse he said for I have received of the
[44:27] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[44:30] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[44:34] in which he was betrayed took
[44:36] bread and when he had given thanks he
[44:39] break it and said take eat this is my
[44:41] body which is broken for you this do in
[44:46] remembrance of
[44:47] me and after the same manner also he
[44:51] took the cup when he had SED saying this
[44:55] cup is is the New Testament in my
[44:58] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[45:02] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[45:07] you eat this bread and drink this cup ye
[45:10] do show the Lord's death till he comes
[45:15] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[45:19] and drink this cup of the Lord
[45:21] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[45:24] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[45:28] examine
[45:30] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[45:35] and drink of that cup so that's what you
[45:38] want to do you want to examine yourself
[45:40] you want to purpose in your heart to
[45:43] make things right you want a purpose in
[45:45] your heart to do better sincerely in
[45:48] your heart and then come into communion
[45:51] and and eat for he that eateth and
[45:53] drinketh um unworthily eateth and
[45:57] drinketh Damnation to himself not
[46:00] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[46:03] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[46:06] and many sleep for if we would judge
[46:09] ourselves we should not be judged but
[46:13] when we are judged we are chastened of
[46:16] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[46:20] with the world therefore my breth when
[46:23] you come together to eat terries one for
[46:26] another If any man hunger let him eat at
[46:29] home that you come not together un come
