[41:36] amen amen what kind of man is this
[41:40] amen the sister rebecca has a testimony
[41:43] how many if you could come with us now
[42:08] i'm a little nervous so y'all just pray
[42:10] for me
[42:13] i can speak in front of crowds as long
[42:14] as it's not at church
[42:18] i had something happen this week and
[42:28] it wasn't a big thing it was a little
[42:31] thing
[42:31] but to me it was a big thing and satan
[42:35] has been
[42:36] he's been fighting me all week about it
[42:37] telling me that it really didn't happen
[42:41] it wasn't that big of a deal nobody was
[42:43] going to believe me
[42:45] you know how satan likes to fight you he
[42:47] fought me all night
[42:49] so i learned that when he fights me like
[42:51] that it's
[42:52] something i probably should do so um
[42:57] just want to tell you what happened a
[42:59] couple of months ago
[43:00] i have a photography studio i'm sure you
[43:01] all know that a couple of months ago i
[43:03] had a client call
[43:05] and they wanted to do corporate
[43:06] headshots for a bank for all the
[43:09] officers of the bank
[43:10] so we talked i took her information she
[43:13] said she would call me back
[43:14] i saved her number and my notes in the
[43:17] phone so i would remember
[43:20] if she called back how much i priced her
[43:22] and all that
[43:23] so a couple weeks ago she called back
[43:26] they set up time they came they did the
[43:27] head shots
[43:28] um
[43:32] when i shoot in the studio i always
[43:33] shoot tethered it's where you have a
[43:34] line going from your camera to your
[43:36] computer
[43:38] and um that's so that they can see the
[43:40] images
[43:41] as we take them and they can choose
[43:43] which one they like the best
[43:46] um when i do this
[43:49] the images do not save to my camera they
[43:52] save to my hard drive
[43:57] so there's no backup it's all on my hard
[44:00] drive so
[44:01] that's what i did we did the session
[44:04] and i went back to work at my other
[44:08] office
[44:10] a few days later i went in the studio i
[44:11] had to get these pictures together
[44:13] and i was getting ready to work on the
[44:15] images and i got an email from
[44:18] the bank's corporate office asking me
[44:19] when they would be getting them
[44:22] um and i told them i was working on them
[44:24] right then and i'd be emailing them to
[44:26] them later that evening and
[44:29] i sent the email and let her know that
[44:31] and when i went to pull up the images
[44:33] the folders were blank
[44:36] my heart sank completely sank
[44:40] the images were gone and this was
[44:42] officers of a bank
[44:43] and you don't just call them up and have
[44:45] them come back in because
[44:47] they're busy and all of that and
[44:50] it wasn't a big thing to anybody else
[44:52] but to me i was going to have to call
[44:54] them and have them come back in
[44:55] and i spent about two hours just
[44:57] searching back and forth back and forth
[45:00] in every place i could imagine for these
[45:02] images and they were not there
[45:05] so i was going to call them and tell
[45:07] them
[45:08] basically what had happened and i was
[45:10] going to have to have them come back in
[45:11] and
[45:13] when i went to pull up the number in my
[45:16] phone it wasn't in my phone the number
[45:17] was
[45:18] gone so i'm really feeling desperate at
[45:21] this point
[45:24] and
[45:29] i didn't i didn't know what had happened
[45:30] i just i just knew they weren't there
[45:33] and so i googled the bank's phone number
[45:37] and i called and it rang and rang i
[45:39] looked it was after four o'clock
[45:41] so they were closed and gone so i i
[45:44] texted the
[45:45] the lady who had referred them to me and
[45:47] asked her
[45:48] to please call me that i needed
[45:50] somebody's cell number so i could
[45:53] call them and she didn't reply um
[45:56] so this went back and forth for about
[45:58] two hours and i
[46:00] couldn't find them they were not there
[46:02] so
[46:05] at this point i just stopped and i put
[46:07] my head down on the table
[46:10] and i just prayed to god and i told him
[46:12] that he knew where those images were
[46:14] and that i didn't i told him i knew he
[46:18] could put him back in those folders
[46:21] and i just asked him if he could please
[46:22] take those images from where they were
[46:24] and put them back where i needed them to
[46:27] be that i would just be so grateful
[46:32] so i meant he's just helped me too many
[46:35] times
[46:37] for me to not know that he could help me
[46:39] now um
[46:42] when i finished praying i just sat up i
[46:44] took a deep breath and i just went
[46:46] okay one more time lord and i opened the
[46:50] folder and
[46:50] all of the images were in the folder
[46:59] and that's that's i kind of kind of lost
[47:02] it at this point and had to stop and
[47:03] walk around and
[47:04] thank god for a minute and call david
[47:07] and tell david what had happened and he
[47:09] thought
[47:10] i'd hurt myself or something but um
[47:15] i just knew that god had confirmed to me
[47:17] that whatever our needs are
[47:19] no matter how small they are or seem to
[47:21] be
[47:22] he's there to help if we just call on
[47:24] him
[47:26] i thought about what brother kyle said
[47:27] when he got up gave his testimony a few
[47:30] weeks ago and he said i've done my part

[52:01] for us to be here but we've got a great
[52:05] hope
[52:07] and if this life was our only hope
[52:11] then we of all people would be most
[52:13] miserable
[52:15] but to know that we have hope of eternal
[52:18] life is
[52:19] a great wonderful thing so let's
[52:21] approach him this morning
[52:24] heavenly father our hearts are
[52:27] thrilled that
[52:29] [Music]
[52:31] we are approaching your throne
[52:36] that you've sent forth grace and mercy
[52:43] that you've invited us to your
[52:46] great chamber that we could lay our
[52:50] petitions at your feet
[52:52] and make requests of you
[52:56] and father they you laid a blood
[52:59] sacrifice
[53:01] for all our unrighteousness lord that
[53:05] you look at us through the shed blood
[53:09] of the scripture says we have a mediator
[53:13] the lord jesus that
[53:16] makes petition on our behalf
[53:19] and lord we're so grateful for that this
[53:22] morning
[53:23] lord no doubt that we think that we have
[53:26] certain needs and certain things that
[53:32] we feel that we would like to
[53:36] come to pass but lord we have a
[53:39] confidence that you know what we have
[53:42] need of
[53:43] even before we ask and father that
[53:46] you'll supply that need
[53:49] we pray father that you bring to us the
[53:52] understanding
[53:54] and the revelation when we
[53:56] [Music]

[54:00] happening
[54:02] but then you come along and show us you
[54:05] had
[54:06] us on your heart all the time that you
[54:09] did what was best for us and our eternal
[54:13] existence we asked this morning that you

[55:05] but it was it was
[55:08] the brother of jesus
[55:11] and because mary went on to have other
[55:14] children and so
[55:15] he i would say he was very connected
[55:19] and we always know this is probably one
[55:22] of the
[55:24] most known and
[55:28] compelling things of
[55:31] james that he wrote he said beloved when
[55:35] i gave all diligence to write unto you
[55:37] of common salvation it was needful for
[55:41] me to write unto you
[55:43] and exhort you that ye should
[55:46] earnestly contend for the faith
[55:50] which was once delivered unto the saints
[55:54] and don't we find ourselves in that
[55:56] place

[56:01] for the faith that was once delivered
[56:04] to the saints and and we wanted to

[1:00:58] and uh we're just going to
[1:01:02] just look a little bit more into the
[1:01:06] message who is this melchizedek and
[1:01:09] the first uh last sunday
[1:01:12] we preached on malkiesa that
[1:01:15] dak the beginning of our existence so
[1:01:19] that was the title of last week's sermon
[1:01:22] and i'll give you the title of this
[1:01:25] sermon at the end of it
[1:01:29] and you know to do that so let's stand
[1:01:34] this morning and
[1:01:38] uh and we'll we'll
[1:01:42] turn in in the
[1:01:47] gospel of saint john and we know the
[1:01:51] scriptures that brother random read
[1:01:53] are in the book of uh hebrews but we're
[1:01:57] just
[1:01:57] want to read this again uh this morning
[1:02:02] it says in the beginning was the word
[1:02:06] and the word was
[1:02:10] with god and the word was
[1:02:13] god and the same was in the beginning
[1:02:18] with god
[1:02:21] all things were made by him
[1:02:25] and without him was not anything
[1:02:28] made that was made in
[1:02:32] him was life and
[1:02:35] the life was the light of men
[1:02:38] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:02:41] darkness
[1:02:42] comprehendeth it not father we ask you
[1:02:45] to bless your word to us this morning in
[1:02:48] jesus precious name we pray
[1:02:50] amen god bless you amen
[1:02:54] we've at the building on
[1:02:57] what that we preached
[1:03:00] or we studied if we could this is just
[1:03:04] bible study we've just came to uh
[1:03:07] a young people's uh revival
[1:03:10] and uh and and that was the purpose we
[1:03:13] want to
[1:03:14] as as our young people come up we want
[1:03:18] to
[1:03:18] introduce them to the baptism of the
[1:03:21] holy spirit
[1:03:23] introduce them to the movement of the
[1:03:25] lord
[1:03:26] and and have them become front-line
[1:03:29] soldiers
[1:03:31] amen helping in in this great battle
[1:03:34] but i thought the other night i i was
[1:03:37] driving i was over here at the church
[1:03:39] just studying and
[1:03:41] and i was driving home and i i said in
[1:03:44] my heart i said lord
[1:03:46] i don't want just to have a young
[1:03:48] people's revival
[1:03:50] i want to have a revival that makes me a
[1:03:53] young person
[1:03:55] amen i want to have a revival
[1:03:58] that's going to change this body amen
[1:04:01] so we want to do that and and we know we
[1:04:05] wouldn't be gathered here this morning
[1:04:07] if we all hadn't heard the great
[1:04:11] eagle cry we've had people
[1:04:14] through the years uh come visit uh i
[1:04:17] gotta
[1:04:18] introduce my friend brother dan back
[1:04:20] there make sure everybody knows he's
[1:04:22] here with us god bless your
[1:04:23] dan it's lindsey's dad so anyway we're
[1:04:26] happy that he's with us this morning
[1:04:28] but i've seen people come over the years
[1:04:31] and
[1:04:32] and they'll walk into the household of
[1:04:34] the lord and they'll feel the presence
[1:04:36] of god and
[1:04:37] and they'll see the people worshiping
[1:04:40] and they they want to enter into that
[1:04:43] right away they feel that but then
[1:04:46] they might see the picture of the pillar
[1:04:48] of fire
[1:04:49] up here and then they they wonder well
[1:04:52] maybe these people
[1:04:54] are a little strange well uh
[1:04:57] hallelujah i mean we are
[1:05:00] uh we're oddballs we know that but
[1:05:04] but uh when it comes to the fact
[1:05:07] that there that god had sent
[1:05:10] us a message
[1:05:14] there's a reluctance there to
[1:05:17] receive that and of course we always
[1:05:20] would encourage them to
[1:05:22] study it out see if it's in the word of
[1:05:24] god see if it's solid
[1:05:26] and it's it's steadfast in the word of
[1:05:29] god
[1:05:30] and many times they can't over
[1:05:33] come that thought that that god could
[1:05:37] use a man in our day
[1:05:39] and they want to stop the work of god
[1:05:42] at jesus and
[1:05:46] but jesus had a work to do and
[1:05:50] so but we're here this morning because
[1:05:54] we all have this one thing in common
[1:05:57] that we've heard the scream of the eagle
[1:06:00] that we've heard his voice
[1:06:03] we've seen that it's true and
[1:06:06] so we have found that it's in god's word
[1:06:10] that he nourishes his people
[1:06:13] and and that's what we want to do we
[1:06:16] want to grow up
[1:06:17] as not every service has to be
[1:06:20] a service that
[1:06:25] would i would say would be exciting you
[1:06:27] know there's a lot of things
[1:06:28] even in school many of you have
[1:06:30] graduated this year
[1:06:32] there's classes and subjects and things
[1:06:34] you've got to go through
[1:06:37] that are just boring yeah you know what
[1:06:40] i mean
[1:06:41] i i got a lot of amens on that
[1:06:45] that that's true and you know
[1:06:48] and like when you take a degree in in
[1:06:52] in school and i didn't get a degree i uh
[1:06:55] i didn't even graduate from high school
[1:07:00] but that's okay i went to another school
[1:07:03] called hard knocks and but if you can go
[1:07:07] to school i think that's a
[1:07:09] a wonderful thing but
[1:07:13] i would find out that they would teach
[1:07:15] things that i never thought was
[1:07:16] necessary
[1:07:19] you know why do i want to know this and
[1:07:21] why do i need to know that
[1:07:23] and why do i need to know that but later
[1:07:25] on you find out that the pieces of the
[1:07:28] puzzle come together so
[1:07:31] this morning we want to approach this
[1:07:34] like a bible study this morning okay
[1:07:37] we have the message that our prophet
[1:07:39] brought us
[1:07:41] and and he was bringing things
[1:07:44] out to us because there
[1:07:48] will come a time when we will need to
[1:07:51] hold on
[1:07:52] to these foundations of the scripture
[1:07:56] no other foundation can a man lay than
[1:07:59] that which has been laid
[1:08:01] which is christ jesus and now you have
[1:08:04] to
[1:08:04] understand that we
[1:08:08] the church begin to fight
[1:08:12] the enemy right from the beginning
[1:08:15] when the lord jesus showed up
[1:08:18] on the scene he was born of a virgin
[1:08:21] as prophesied many people never believed
[1:08:25] that
[1:08:25] but yet it came to pass the angels
[1:08:29] testified in the sky to the shepherds
[1:08:31] three wise men came seeking his sign
[1:08:35] there was the slaughter of the infant's
[1:08:37] to fulfill the scriptures
[1:08:40] he fled into egypt all this great things
[1:08:43] begin
[1:08:44] to come to pass and we begin to see
[1:08:48] that that god had a great
[1:08:51] plan in his mind
[1:08:54] and so we begin to talk about this
[1:08:57] as it comes down to our day
[1:09:01] and so we we took the book of maltese
[1:09:04] deck and
[1:09:05] it when i begin i thought of this
[1:09:07] message i thought well brother branham
[1:09:09] just began to preach this message and
[1:09:12] and he had just got done preaching the
[1:09:15] great
[1:09:16] subject of marriage and divorce and
[1:09:20] and then so this message was uh
[1:09:24] maybe not so significant you know
[1:09:27] an evening message and then
[1:09:31] i i i realized that
[1:09:34] something fantastic
[1:09:37] had happened in marriage and divorce
[1:09:41] that in in the message marriage and
[1:09:44] divorce
[1:09:45] spiritually what had taken place
[1:09:49] is that any claim that
[1:09:53] the enemy had to the bride
[1:09:56] was annulled
[1:10:00] okay so now the bride
[1:10:03] steps out completely
[1:10:06] free from the old man
[1:10:10] husband and you know that's what brother
[1:10:13] branham taught
[1:10:14] in marriage and divorce i'm talking to
[1:10:17] you
[1:10:18] today like uh uh your college students
[1:10:22] i'm not a college professor but in the
[1:10:25] lord
[1:10:26] you're mature so that that's what
[1:10:28] marriage in divorce
[1:10:30] taught us it wasn't about life's
[1:10:32] circumstances
[1:10:33] of marriage and divorce and who married
[1:10:35] who and and all that
[1:10:37] it was a greater thing that went all the
[1:10:39] way back
[1:10:40] to the garden of eden and so
[1:10:43] it was decreed that the records were
[1:10:47] clean
[1:10:48] and now this bride
[1:10:52] being a marriage and divorce being
[1:10:55] preached
[1:10:56] this great message comes forth and it's
[1:11:00] really a tremendous message
[1:11:03] and so we begin to do it so we're just
[1:11:06] going to go back through
[1:11:07] real quick and and
[1:11:11] read a few statements as they place them
[1:11:14] on the board
[1:11:15] and so we saw in paragraph 31
[1:11:19] and if you want to pull this up on your
[1:11:21] phones and
[1:11:23] and do that you can this morning turn
[1:11:26] your ringers off if it's possible
[1:11:29] and and so
[1:11:33] we we saw here he said there's much
[1:11:36] dispute
[1:11:37] about this person and this subject
[1:11:42] he says i think it behooves us
[1:11:45] to break into it
[1:11:48] and find out who this is
[1:11:52] and so i i like that it behooves us to
[1:11:55] break into it
[1:11:56] so another he's saying we're going to
[1:11:59] break into something
[1:12:01] and and so that excites me
[1:12:05] right there it's just not a message he's
[1:12:07] trying to kill time with
[1:12:08] he he says we need to
[1:12:12] break into us it it behooves us
[1:12:15] and then we saw again in the 32nd verse
[1:12:18] the description of this person
[1:12:21] and the this the person is eternal
[1:12:26] so we read in the beginning was god
[1:12:29] right so really first john
[1:12:33] where we read there those first few
[1:12:35] verses
[1:12:36] is the description of melchizedek
[1:12:39] amen okay and so he says
[1:12:44] he says he had no father
[1:12:47] he had no mother he had no time
[1:12:52] he ever began he had no time
[1:12:55] he ever ended and
[1:12:58] ever who it was is still alive tonight
[1:13:02] because the bible said here that he had
[1:13:05] neither father nor mother beginning of
[1:13:07] days
[1:13:08] ending of life so it would have to be
[1:13:12] an eternal person is that right
[1:13:16] amen and eternal person so
[1:13:19] it could only be one person
[1:13:23] that's god because he's the only one
[1:13:28] that's eternal and so now we begin to
[1:13:32] see
[1:13:33] this great unfolding here he says
[1:13:36] now the thing that i contend
[1:13:40] is that he was god
[1:13:43] because he's the only person that can be
[1:13:46] immortal now god changing himself
[1:13:52] into person
[1:13:55] that's what he was no father no mother
[1:13:58] no beginning of days
[1:14:00] no ending of days now
[1:14:03] we we know that god
[1:14:06] hath never given anybody
[1:14:09] a revelation of the trinity
[1:14:17] no because you can't
[1:14:21] even worship god for something that he's
[1:14:25] not
[1:14:27] okay so if you're going to really
[1:14:29] worship the true god you've got to
[1:14:31] worship him
[1:14:32] for what he really is
[1:14:36] and so god never gave a revelation
[1:14:39] of the trinity to anybody
[1:14:43] the trinity is a man made
[1:14:46] a man-made
[1:14:50] conception of them
[1:14:53] trying to perceive this
[1:14:56] person so
[1:15:00] command looked at it from this
[1:15:02] standpoint
[1:15:04] trying to figure it out well they took
[1:15:08] this book
[1:15:12] that was sealed
[1:15:17] the mysteries were sealed in it so they
[1:15:20] took
[1:15:21] this book without the key
[1:15:25] or or the revelation
[1:15:29] of the mystery and they try to
[1:15:33] look at this person and figure it out by
[1:15:38] reading these scriptures
[1:15:41] and so they read over here and then they
[1:15:43] read over here and they
[1:15:46] they come up with this and they they saw
[1:15:48] spirit
[1:15:49] and they saw man and they're just trying
[1:15:53] to put it all together
[1:15:55] and so they they they come up with it
[1:15:58] and they they in their thinking they
[1:16:00] said well there's got to be god the
[1:16:03] father
[1:16:04] god the son and god the holy ghost
[1:16:08] there's there's got to be there's three
[1:16:11] people that
[1:16:14] did this and but they never
[1:16:17] understood god amorphy
[1:16:21] now brother branham said it was god
[1:16:25] amorphy in other words the same
[1:16:28] person changing
[1:16:32] his mask or changing
[1:16:36] his form and so we
[1:16:39] we we we went through these things and
[1:16:41] we're just
[1:16:43] uh going we're gonna just take this so
[1:16:46] he said it was the same person
[1:16:50] all the time so if we
[1:16:54] looked at paragraph 40 we would read it
[1:16:56] like this
[1:16:57] and he says that's what god did it's the
[1:17:00] same god
[1:17:01] all the time god in the form of the
[1:17:06] father
[1:17:07] the spirit the pillar of fire
[1:17:10] the same god was made flesh and dwelt
[1:17:13] among us
[1:17:14] e morphe brought out
[1:17:17] so he could be seen and now
[1:17:21] that same god is the holy ghost
[1:17:24] the father son holy ghost not three gods
[1:17:28] three offices three acts one
[1:17:32] god so we see that
[1:17:36] that that was what it was so it's this
[1:17:39] one
[1:17:40] person now so we go
[1:17:43] drop back down again and we'll we'll
[1:17:45] just walk through this
[1:17:46] he says it in the 42nd paragraph
[1:17:50] he said it's like a sculpture that has
[1:17:53] created a work
[1:17:55] but he doesn't want to show it yet
[1:17:58] so like if you commissioned a painting
[1:18:01] or
[1:18:02] and and you've seen it and you've seen
[1:18:05] uh
[1:18:05] where uh somebody had commissioned an
[1:18:08] artist to do a painting
[1:18:10] they paint our president and so he'll
[1:18:13] get his presidential
[1:18:14] portrait made and they cover it up
[1:18:18] and then when uh
[1:18:21] it comes time to unveil it for the
[1:18:24] public
[1:18:25] they go there and they have it on a
[1:18:27] stand and everybody gives speeches you
[1:18:29] know what i mean
[1:18:31] and then they pull the
[1:18:34] blanket off of it the cover off of it
[1:18:36] and everybody can see
[1:18:38] the painting for the first time well
[1:18:41] i'll guarantee you the subject of that
[1:18:43] painting had already seen it
[1:18:52] okay but it's unveiled to the public
[1:18:56] for the first time and so he's trying to
[1:18:59] he
[1:18:59] he's pointing something out to us he
[1:19:02] says so we're talking about delving into
[1:19:04] who is this malchester at
[1:19:06] well what brother brahm's doing he's
[1:19:07] laying it out here and he's saying to us
[1:19:10] who this melchizedek is has been covered
[1:19:14] up
[1:19:16] but i'm in this service brother branham
[1:19:19] speaking
[1:19:19] if you give me the liberty to play that
[1:19:23] part he says i'm going to pull the cover
[1:19:26] off of it today
[1:19:28] and let you see who he is
[1:19:32] i'm going to unveil this mystery
[1:19:36] to all that would desire
[1:19:40] to see it or to whomever he'll
[1:19:44] show it to and reveal it to
[1:19:48] it and so he goes to pull the cover off
[1:19:52] he says
[1:19:52] that's what the bible has been
[1:19:55] this is uh right up below
[1:19:59] a little paragraph 42 sculpture mask it
[1:20:01] over
[1:20:03] and that's what god has done in this age
[1:20:05] it's been hid
[1:20:06] all these things has been hid and is
[1:20:09] supposed to be revealed
[1:20:11] in this age now the bible says that
[1:20:14] there will be
[1:20:15] re revealed in the latter times
[1:20:18] it's like the sculpture that keeps his
[1:20:20] piece of work covered
[1:20:22] over until the time he takes
[1:20:26] the mask off of it and there it is
[1:20:29] that's what what the bible has been
[1:20:32] it's been the work of god's
[1:20:36] been covered up and it's been hid
[1:20:40] since the foundation of the world
[1:20:43] and its seven-fold mysteries
[1:20:47] and god promised in this day the age of
[1:20:51] this lady will see a church age that he
[1:20:53] would take the mask
[1:20:54] off the whole thing and we could see it
[1:20:59] what a glorious thing
[1:21:02] god amorphy what a glorious thing
[1:21:06] every time you read this book and you
[1:21:08] hear
[1:21:09] a morphe don't read it in more faith
[1:21:12] because that word keeps throwing you so
[1:21:15] put the definition of the word in there
[1:21:19] god changing form god
[1:21:23] changing mass in the pillar of fire
[1:21:26] god changing in a man called jesus
[1:21:30] god changing in his church
[1:21:33] god above us god with us god in us
[1:21:37] the condescending of god
[1:21:40] amen so we see that it's been covered up
[1:21:44] so one of the things that we know
[1:21:48] that that we've been taught is that
[1:21:51] in the beginning we know
[1:21:54] that that this great person
[1:21:59] god if we could go over to paragraph
[1:22:03] 46 that
[1:22:06] now in the beginning god
[1:22:09] dwelt alone now so
[1:22:12] we we understand this that god dwelt
[1:22:16] alone so to this
[1:22:17] that's in our minds if you could use
[1:22:20] your imagination thinking of god
[1:22:24] dwelling alone so in other words
[1:22:28] god is all time
[1:22:31] and all space there's nothing but him
[1:22:36] so he can't be seen
[1:22:40] he can't be handled he can't be touched
[1:22:44] amen can you see this air that's in
[1:22:46] between here
[1:22:49] no he it's he's invisible
[1:22:53] he's beyond comprehension
[1:22:56] he's he he's just god out there
[1:23:01] all by himself so the the first thing
[1:23:04] that
[1:23:04] he is he he's alone and
[1:23:08] and and what he has in him he he's alone
[1:23:12] with his attributes as i spoke to
[1:23:15] mourning
[1:23:16] is his thoughts there was nothing just
[1:23:19] god alone and he had thoughts there was
[1:23:22] nothing but god alone
[1:23:25] and he had thoughts right and so as we
[1:23:29] we studied this out a little bit and if
[1:23:31] we
[1:23:32] we jumped ahead a little bit
[1:23:36] and we saw that that god was a god and
[1:23:39] that he wanted
[1:23:41] fellowship so that's what god did we we
[1:23:44] we read up there in the paragraph right
[1:23:46] before that paragraph 44
[1:23:50] and he said god came down and became
[1:23:52] flesh and died
[1:23:53] the death in christ so that he could
[1:23:56] clean the church in order to get into it
[1:23:59] for fellowship so but we cut we take
[1:24:02] this we're not going to
[1:24:03] talk about that part of it but we're
[1:24:05] going to say god loves fellowship
[1:24:08] that's what he made the man
[1:24:12] at the first time
[1:24:15] was for fellowship
[1:24:18] god dwelt alone
[1:24:21] so god dwelt alone but he wasn't even
[1:24:24] god
[1:24:26] because god's an object of worship so
[1:24:28] just
[1:24:29] picture this god dwelling alone and
[1:24:32] first thing he had to do is become god
[1:24:37] so he created seraphims
[1:24:42] angels to worship him that made him an
[1:24:45] object of worship now i'm just trying to
[1:24:49] make this transition
[1:24:52] to what that i want to say or
[1:24:55] what we want to talk about so god
[1:24:59] had thoughts so in his thoughts he
[1:25:03] wanted to have fellowship
[1:25:05] so he had to he had to
[1:25:08] in his thoughts say how am i
[1:25:12] going to move and
[1:25:16] and make something that i can have
[1:25:20] fellowship with
[1:25:25] okay so he wants to have fellowship
[1:25:29] so in his plan he's going to
[1:25:32] have this fellowship so the first thing
[1:25:35] that god does
[1:25:37] is he creates the stage
[1:25:43] that his act
[1:25:46] is going to unfold so brother brown said
[1:25:50] god was emorphy
[1:25:52] like somebody in a play
[1:25:55] changing his mass so god
[1:25:58] is going to unfold himself
[1:26:01] so the play that god is writing
[1:26:06] in this great place it's called the
[1:26:09] revealing of self
[1:26:11] or the revealing of god or
[1:26:14] god creating fellowship whatever you
[1:26:17] want to title
[1:26:19] the great play the place got to have a
[1:26:22] stage
[1:26:24] so god begins to create the stage
[1:26:27] he says first of all let there be light
[1:26:31] and then he creates the heavens and he
[1:26:33] creates the earth
[1:26:34] and and what does paul come back and
[1:26:37] says he says the invisible things of god
[1:26:40] are clearly seen in the visible things
[1:26:43] around us
[1:26:45] our messenger comes up and other bible
[1:26:47] writers have said the same thing
[1:26:50] you know don't ever get yourself so
[1:26:53] narrow-minded to think that brother
[1:26:56] branham was the only
[1:26:57] person in the world that brought out any
[1:27:01] bible truth
[1:27:04] you'll miss you'll miss his ministry
[1:27:07] completely
[1:27:09] you know other men wrote about
[1:27:12] the bible being in the stars
[1:27:17] branham accepted everything that was
[1:27:21] truth
[1:27:25] you understand that he read the same
[1:27:28] bible
[1:27:29] that we read but there was
[1:27:32] things that were hid is that right
[1:27:36] so you know so like the church ages
[1:27:39] people get
[1:27:40] all upset because they go get charles
[1:27:43] larkin's book
[1:27:44] and charles larkin historically laid out
[1:27:47] the church ages
[1:27:49] well that never threw me
[1:27:53] that was history
[1:27:57] you know what i mean he looked at it and
[1:27:58] he saw the ages he saw history
[1:28:01] he laid it out and he said that's true
[1:28:04] i can use this foundation
[1:28:09] to show the church age messengers comes
[1:28:12] out
[1:28:13] this is an acceptable thought pattern
[1:28:16] of man but when you want to make
[1:28:18] everything
[1:28:19] exclusive to brother branham
[1:28:23] then you're bestowing honor upon him
[1:28:27] that and that's what he said he says a
[1:28:30] messenger needs
[1:28:31] no greater honor bestowed upon him
[1:28:34] than that which god bestowed
[1:28:38] upon him can we know
[1:28:41] the honor that god bestowed upon him
[1:28:44] the honor that god stole on this
[1:28:47] messenger
[1:28:48] was to open the seals
[1:28:52] and reveal the hidden mysteries
[1:28:56] this paul even says that these things
[1:28:59] were made known
[1:29:00] by god and man wished not to retain
[1:29:04] god in his knowledge and was given over
[1:29:07] to a reprobate mind
[1:29:08] god's given men opportunity to see him
[1:29:12] all down to the ages but man chose man
[1:29:16] over choosing god
[1:29:19] so it doesn't shake me
[1:29:24] that other people have
[1:29:28] uh have brought out truths and brother
[1:29:30] branham read their books and took some
[1:29:32] of the things that they said
[1:29:34] saw that they were true saw that they
[1:29:36] were a vehicle
[1:29:38] from which he could deliver his message
[1:29:41] but the thing about it is his message
[1:29:44] is only to an elect people
[1:29:49] so a lot of people have read this
[1:29:51] message and won't even ever see what
[1:29:53] we're talking about
[1:29:55] this morning okay so you don't
[1:29:58] you don't have to say
[1:30:02] you know if he reads somebody else or
[1:30:05] somebody else says something
[1:30:06] you don't have to keep saying oh that's
[1:30:08] exclusively
[1:30:09] brother branham you understand
[1:30:13] what's exclusive to brother branham is
[1:30:16] exclusive to you
[1:30:21] you're the only one that sees it you're
[1:30:24] the only one that hears it
[1:30:28] amen that's where the exclusivity
[1:30:31] lies so he creates the stage
[1:30:36] you understand now he's going to unfold
[1:30:38] this act
[1:30:40] in in the great stage that he
[1:30:43] he he's forming so the first thing
[1:30:48] that we realize that god did
[1:30:51] that he dwelt alone with his attributes
[1:30:55] and and we we saw him do this
[1:30:58] was that he formed himself
[1:31:02] towards a person
[1:31:08] i want to hold that there so if you come
[1:31:10] look
[1:31:11] here maybe we could just we we've read
[1:31:14] this to you before
[1:31:15] 46 that he dwelt alone
[1:31:19] with his attributes and and he he wanted
[1:31:23] to
[1:31:24] express himself so paragraph 55
[1:31:28] we could go read this he says now notice
[1:31:30] his attributes
[1:31:32] then the attribute was first god
[1:31:36] the thought the attribute itself
[1:31:40] all in one without being
[1:31:44] expressed
[1:31:47] so that was just this great eternal
[1:31:52] unseeable untouchable
[1:31:56] unknowable god
[1:31:59] yes sir okay that's what he was
[1:32:03] we didn't even know he was god nobody
[1:32:05] knew he was god
[1:32:09] nobody could even think about him
[1:32:12] because if they could think about him
[1:32:14] they would have been god
[1:32:16] so it's just this god secondly
[1:32:20] he says all in one without being
[1:32:22] expressed
[1:32:24] and then when he expressed
[1:32:27] secondly he became then
[1:32:31] the word and
[1:32:34] and then he goes on to thirdly he says
[1:32:37] and then the word was made flesh and
[1:32:40] dwelt among us
[1:32:41] look i just want to take a moment this
[1:32:43] morning
[1:32:44] to talk about why that god
[1:32:49] formed himself into a person
[1:32:56] okay why did he
[1:32:59] become a person
[1:33:04] he could have become something else
[1:33:07] but he became a person because
[1:33:10] he was going to create persons
[1:33:18] yeah i i know that might be so simple
[1:33:22] but to bear with me you know remember i
[1:33:24] have no education
[1:33:26] so i've got to explain stuff so i can
[1:33:29] think about it
[1:33:31] in other words we weren't
[1:33:34] we we were created
[1:33:37] in his image
[1:33:40] but the image that we were created in
[1:33:44] was not a fleshly image
[1:33:48] like we think god became
[1:33:51] a person in other words he had a
[1:33:54] personality
[1:33:56] he had attributes he became a person
[1:34:00] because he was going to create persons
[1:34:05] so he wanted fellowship so he became
[1:34:09] something you understand
[1:34:13] that that he could fellowship
[1:34:16] with so he knew he was going to create
[1:34:21] persons
[1:34:22] so in the in his plan he says i'm in i
[1:34:26] i'm going to create persons people that
[1:34:29] i can talk to
[1:34:30] people that i can become one with
[1:34:34] you you understand so that that's what
[1:34:37] it is so he wanted somebody he could
[1:34:39] talk to
[1:34:39] somebody could express them to somebody
[1:34:42] that could exceed
[1:34:43] receive his expressions can somebody
[1:34:46] that
[1:34:47] that that what was uh
[1:34:51] that he could unite with if i could use
[1:34:54] the word
[1:34:55] and connect with so he became a person
[1:34:59] because he was going to create persons
[1:35:02] so he made us in the image
[1:35:06] of the the person he made us
[1:35:09] persons so that's what we're made in the
[1:35:12] image of we're made in the image of the
[1:35:14] person
[1:35:16] that's my prophet of god come and said
[1:35:17] jesus had the personality
[1:35:20] of god the hardest thing for
[1:35:23] us to do this morning is
[1:35:26] to take this earthly body
[1:35:29] out of the picture
[1:35:35] because every time you start thinking
[1:35:39] you're always you always are looking
[1:35:42] at yourself through this flesh
[1:35:49] okay it's hard for us to comprehend
[1:35:52] our existence before this flesh
[1:36:00] so everything we have everything that we
[1:36:03] deal with
[1:36:04] is based on these five senses and these
[1:36:08] emotions
[1:36:09] that's what we call our person
[1:36:13] but there's another part of our person
[1:36:16] right and that's an
[1:36:19] inward man if we could say it that way
[1:36:22] we
[1:36:23] we trying to describe it it
[1:36:26] it's so important for us to create the
[1:36:30] separation between
[1:36:31] our flesh and our emotions and the part
[1:36:34] of us
[1:36:35] that's god and so we we refer to that
[1:36:38] as as the word seed
[1:36:42] the seed of god that's in us because
[1:36:45] we call it seed because it hasn't
[1:36:48] grown into any form of maturity
[1:36:52] so we can't comprehend it
[1:36:56] as christ in us the hope of glory
[1:36:59] we just keep wanting to leave it seed
[1:37:02] and i'm saying
[1:37:03] it's time that it moves from seed form
[1:37:07] to fruit form
[1:37:12] it can't remain a seed forever
[1:37:21] there's got to be something
[1:37:24] that sets us free
[1:37:28] from ourselves and the only thing that
[1:37:31] can set us free from ourselves
[1:37:34] is divine revelation
[1:37:38] now may i say this early pentecost
[1:37:43] thought that the anointing of the spirit
[1:37:47] and the restoration of gifts was the
[1:37:50] freedom
[1:37:51] from the flesh and it wasn't
[1:37:57] it was an outpouring of the blessings of
[1:38:00] god
[1:38:01] the restoration of gifts it was rain
[1:38:07] okay and that fell on the what the
[1:38:10] justin the unjust
[1:38:12] and so they rejoiced and they shouted
[1:38:15] and it moved men to live right and to
[1:38:18] live holy
[1:38:19] i wish that we could all
[1:38:22] live as a holy and dedicated life
[1:38:26] as our early pentecostal
[1:38:30] fathers of our age
[1:38:34] they fasted they prayed
[1:38:37] they sought god
[1:38:40] they hungered and they thirst
[1:38:44] they didn't know what they were
[1:38:46] hungering for
[1:38:48] they didn't know what they were
[1:38:49] thirsting for there was a
[1:38:51] call in their heart we want more of god
[1:38:54] now they thought
[1:38:57] that the outpouring of azusa street
[1:39:00] was the answer to that prayer
[1:39:04] he said but it wasn't the rain that they
[1:39:07] were praying for
[1:39:08] he says really it became an unrighteous
[1:39:11] partaking of god by
[1:39:14] men that work didn't have the right
[1:39:18] motives didn't have the right objectives
[1:39:21] took the spirit of god the move of god
[1:39:23] the gifts of god
[1:39:25] used it for merchandise and it it simply
[1:39:28] became
[1:39:29] infected with humanism and
[1:39:32] eventually showed its true color by
[1:39:35] denominating
[1:39:39] so the answer
[1:39:43] to what the true cry was was
[1:39:47] not a an anointing rain
[1:39:50] but it was a teaching reign
[1:39:55] care was an unveiling
[1:39:59] and a revealing of
[1:40:02] the truth of the word of god
[1:40:06] it was going to take the false evidences
[1:40:09] out
[1:40:09] it was going to take the the ideas that
[1:40:13] man had of the godhead
[1:40:16] of what salvation was the book of life
[1:40:19] so in other words there were so many
[1:40:21] things
[1:40:22] that had to be taught
[1:40:26] okay and another word for
[1:40:29] taught is what revealed
[1:40:32] and accepted
[1:40:36] can then put the revelation and and
[1:40:40] the acceptance of it
[1:40:43] in your heart it allows you
[1:40:46] to now separate yourself from your flesh
[1:40:51] and start to make contact with that
[1:40:54] inner man and not spend your whole life
[1:40:58] trying to govern this flesh
[1:41:05] paul said i set up my body he said i
[1:41:09] bring it under subjection that i might
[1:41:13] move higher into the higher
[1:41:16] calling leaving those things which are
[1:41:19] behind behind
[1:41:20] pressing for a higher calling
[1:41:25] so this message was not just something
[1:41:28] to bring your your mortal bodies into
[1:41:31] subjection
[1:41:33] he gave us his spirit
[1:41:36] to do that but then he wanted to quicken
[1:41:40] to you
[1:41:41] the revelation of himself or he wanted
[1:41:45] to reveal to
[1:41:46] us or uncover for us
[1:41:49] or pull the blanket off the whole plan
[1:41:53] of god
[1:41:56] so we could see where
[1:41:59] he was so he dwelt with himself
[1:42:04] alone right so what did he want he
[1:42:08] he so he was going to create a person
[1:42:11] you know and so he wanted to create this
[1:42:14] person and we won't go
[1:42:15] into uh excuse me we could go into so
[1:42:18] much about
[1:42:20] about uh the attributes and but we've
[1:42:23] we've covered that so many times
[1:42:25] so he created a person so he could
[1:42:28] become
[1:42:29] one with this person
[1:42:33] right he wanted somebody that he could
[1:42:36] that was worthy
[1:42:39] to justify
[1:42:46] i know that probably went
[1:42:50] okay so he is not going to send
[1:42:54] his son right
[1:42:57] and if i hope some of you have went back
[1:43:01] and and and read over
[1:43:04] some of the statements in here you know
[1:43:07] what he where he said before there you
[1:43:10] you ever were born he said that he sent
[1:43:13] jesus
[1:43:14] uh his son down to die for you
[1:43:18] you know what i mean so that right
[1:43:22] that in his that's what he did he's
[1:43:25] going to send his son to redeem
[1:43:27] we won't go into that that outside of
[1:43:30] that unfolding
[1:43:31] but another if he's going to send
[1:43:33] somebody to justify
[1:43:35] then this person has to be worthy
[1:43:39] to die for
[1:43:42] so you were worthy to die for because
[1:43:46] your name
[1:43:47] was written on the lamb's book of life
[1:43:50] so he gave you a credential
[1:43:54] you're not going to pay top dollar
[1:43:57] for something that's bogus
[1:44:04] has anybody ever done that
[1:44:10] well i have
[1:44:14] you know you buy a coke tray or
[1:44:16] something or
[1:44:17] a coke bottle you know what i mean and
[1:44:19] you think man this
[1:44:20] original 1909 coke bottle and you go
[1:44:24] there and you get home find out they
[1:44:25] didn't make coke till 1912.
[1:44:27] you know what i mean so you understand
[1:44:30] god's not going to die for something
[1:44:33] that's
[1:44:35] bogus
[1:44:38] okay he's only going to die for
[1:44:41] something that's
[1:44:46] his
[1:44:48] okay so we i i'm trying to
[1:44:52] bring this without just jumping up and
[1:44:54] getting
[1:44:55] too excited so i'm gonna stay calm
[1:44:59] so he you know so it had to be
[1:45:02] somebody that was worthy to die for
[1:45:06] worthy to justify in other words
[1:45:09] justify was what like you never did it
[1:45:12] in the first place you have to
[1:45:15] understand that
[1:45:16] you already had to be worthy
[1:45:23] else he wouldn't have justified you
[1:45:28] and and uh
[1:45:31] you know and i keep looking through here
[1:45:33] because there's so many places
[1:45:35] he said he said here and this is in
[1:45:37] paragraph 69
[1:45:39] it says but you look and clearly makes
[1:45:43] it
[1:45:44] clear you will never be the word
[1:45:47] unless you was a thought at the
[1:45:50] beginning
[1:45:51] that proves the predestination of god
[1:45:55] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:45:58] thought
[1:45:59] now i know a lot of us are got
[1:46:02] all predestinations pushed down in the
[1:46:05] future
[1:46:06] let me say this we do not understand
[1:46:10] predestination
[1:46:14] we are breaking into predestination
[1:46:17] we we understand
[1:46:20] the benefits of predestination
[1:46:25] we understand the security
[1:46:28] of predestination
[1:46:31] but we do not fully
[1:46:34] comprehend our pre-existence
[1:46:43] because that would empower you
[1:46:48] jesus understood his pre-existence
[1:46:52] he said i came from god i go to god
[1:46:59] he says he says that proves the
[1:47:02] predestiny of god
[1:47:03] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:47:05] thought you had to be
[1:47:07] in the thinking first but you see
[1:47:10] in order to stam temptation we went
[1:47:13] through this you had to bypass
[1:47:15] the theophany anyway see he said see you
[1:47:18] had to be first
[1:47:21] you had to be something so
[1:47:25] you bypassed that theophany does
[1:47:28] everybody understand
[1:47:34] theophany
[1:47:37] should i stop one moment and try to
[1:47:40] explain
[1:47:42] the theophany body
[1:47:47] all right that's it
[1:47:50] it's not very complicated
[1:47:55] in fact it's a little simple
[1:47:58] and i think that why that we miss it
[1:48:02] so let's go over to
[1:48:06] uh
[1:48:09] paragraph 89.
[1:48:16] we'll just read here so you kind of
[1:48:19] get the idea
[1:48:22] of theophany
[1:48:28] if this gets long please feel free to
[1:48:31] leave
[1:48:32] without without regret you know what i
[1:48:35] mean or anything
[1:48:37] he says there was a prophet 89 there was
[1:48:40] a prophet named moses
[1:48:43] and one day called him
[1:48:46] and one day god called him
[1:48:51] and wouldn't let him go over the land
[1:48:55] and he died on the rock and the angels
[1:48:59] took him away and buried him
[1:49:03] there was another man an eagle didn't
[1:49:06] even
[1:49:06] have to die he just walked across
[1:49:10] jordan and god sent chariots down and
[1:49:14] this
[1:49:14] robe of flesh he dropped
[1:49:19] and raised and caught the everlasting
[1:49:23] prize
[1:49:26] all right we're talking about this
[1:49:28] theophany
[1:49:30] 800 years later
[1:49:33] 800 years later on mount transfiguration
[1:49:38] here stood those two man
[1:49:42] moses's body had been rotten for
[1:49:45] hundreds of years
[1:49:47] but there he was in such a
[1:49:50] form till even peter
[1:49:53] james and john recognized him
[1:49:57] amen if this earthly
[1:50:00] tabernacle be dissolved if
[1:50:04] you're an attribute of god
[1:50:07] expressed here on earth
[1:50:12] you've got a body waiting
[1:50:15] after you leave this world
[1:50:20] there they was standing on mount
[1:50:25] transfiguration in
[1:50:28] their theophany
[1:50:35] okay there they were
[1:50:38] standing there in their theophany
[1:50:42] for they were prophets to whom the word
[1:50:45] of the lord came to
[1:50:47] so he goes down he says now let's notice
[1:50:49] another
[1:50:50] prophet one time by
[1:50:54] the name of samuel he was a great man he
[1:50:57] had taught
[1:50:58] israel told them they shouldn't
[1:51:02] have a king and and have i ever said one
[1:51:05] thing to
[1:51:06] you in the name of the lord but that it
[1:51:08] hadn't come to pass
[1:51:10] that to know everything you always said
[1:51:12] in the name of the lord come to pass he
[1:51:14] was a prophet
[1:51:16] so three or four hundred years later or
[1:51:18] whatever
[1:51:19] that time frame was on the internal side
[1:51:21] it was different than on the natural
[1:51:23] side
[1:51:24] the king got i i said that part it's on
[1:51:27] the board
[1:51:28] brother ben said the king got in trouble
[1:51:32] that was before the blood of jesus
[1:51:33] christ was ever shed
[1:51:35] he was in paradise and the witch of
[1:51:38] endor
[1:51:38] called for somebody to come and console
[1:51:41] saul
[1:51:42] and when the witch saw him standing she
[1:51:45] said
[1:51:46] i see god rising up out of the earth
[1:51:50] and after the man had been dead
[1:51:53] buried and rotten in the grave
[1:51:57] kerry was standing there in that cave
[1:52:01] with his prophet robon he was still a
[1:52:05] prophet
[1:52:06] amen why did
[1:52:10] you call me out of my rest see you
[1:52:13] become an enemy of god
[1:52:15] watch him prophesy tomorrow by this time
[1:52:18] you will be with me he still was a
[1:52:21] prophet though he was gone
[1:52:23] from this body see
[1:52:26] he had become here and was part of the
[1:52:30] word
[1:52:31] and he entered from the flesh body
[1:52:35] life back into the body
[1:52:39] that had been prepared
[1:52:42] for him before the foundation of the
[1:52:46] world
[1:52:47] he entered into the theophany
[1:52:57] okay which was the word you did it
[1:53:01] there's where all believers
[1:53:04] go when they turn
[1:53:08] from here
[1:53:12] well i'm off track now
[1:53:16] okay so god
[1:53:19] in his great plan right he had
[1:53:23] a body for you
[1:53:29] is that right okay so that's the body we
[1:53:33] didn't know that body
[1:53:34] remember we bypassed that body
[1:53:37] we didn't come in contact with that body
[1:53:41] we didn't know that body even
[1:53:45] existed
[1:53:49] remember he said oh i just thought we
[1:53:51] went and played on the harp
[1:53:53] nobody knew
[1:53:57] okay and and you know brother graham
[1:54:00] talks about the man remember that got
[1:54:01] hit by the car he was still there
[1:54:03] you don't die when you die okay he
[1:54:07] talked to the body
[1:54:09] and explained the body like tv
[1:54:12] waves he's trying to get he's using
[1:54:16] these things
[1:54:17] you understand he's trying to use
[1:54:19] earthly things
[1:54:21] to express something that
[1:54:25] that's eternal trying to express
[1:54:29] a dimension that doesn't have the
[1:54:32] limitations
[1:54:34] express that dimension but trying to
[1:54:38] use something for us to be able to grasp
[1:54:42] it with
[1:54:43] so he says it's like tv waves they're
[1:54:46] going
[1:54:47] through the room right now there's
[1:54:49] people
[1:54:50] here images that are right here if you
[1:54:55] if you had the receiver
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:55:01] you could see them
[1:55:04] now brother branham had that receiver
[1:55:08] remember he was sitting on the couch in
[1:55:11] the vision
[1:55:12] ken his wife told him don't worry he got
[1:55:14] picked up and
[1:55:15] and lifted her over the log and and all
[1:55:19] all those times so he said there's right
[1:55:21] that's why the prophet could go back
[1:55:23] and look when he prayed for that little
[1:55:26] girl and raised her from the dead
[1:55:28] he said how could he raise her up from
[1:55:30] the dead he said because he
[1:55:32] knew her name was on the lamb's
[1:55:35] book of life
[1:55:40] we can stay in this book for months
[1:55:47] and so he's trying to express it to you
[1:55:50] it's not something fleshly
[1:55:58] we just can't separate man
[1:56:02] cannot loves this flesh so much
[1:56:05] that they didn't even want to accept the
[1:56:07] fact that
[1:56:08] this isn't the body you're going to get
[1:56:15] and he all through this book he says
[1:56:17] that over again
[1:56:18] if this body be dissolved if this body
[1:56:20] be dissolved if this body be dissolved
[1:56:22] we have a theophany
[1:56:27] okay we have the body
[1:56:32] that god had in his mind
[1:56:35] in the beginning that we would
[1:56:39] live in
[1:56:45] but we didn't get that body
[1:56:49] you understand we bypass that body
[1:56:54] adam bypassed that body
[1:57:01] now i know you're going to ask the
[1:57:02] question well i thought he was male and
[1:57:04] female
[1:57:06] he was and
[1:57:09] and god had adam in his mind
[1:57:13] and in adam he had both of those
[1:57:16] attributes
[1:57:17] in one okay but
[1:57:20] god didn't create adam from his
[1:57:23] thinking to a theophany body
[1:57:29] you understand he went from god's
[1:57:32] thinking
[1:57:33] into a earthly body
[1:57:38] he bypassed that and he went into an
[1:57:41] earthly body okay because so that
[1:57:45] earthly body could be what
[1:57:50] tempted and that's what god told them
[1:57:54] as long as you don't partake
[1:57:57] of sin this earthly body will do you
[1:58:04] but god knew adam would fall
[1:58:08] and i mean these are all things we've
[1:58:10] gone over but
[1:58:11] i just hope they can start growing in us
[1:58:14] he said god
[1:58:15] created eve to fail
[1:58:20] because adam couldn't fail because he
[1:58:23] was a part of the original creation
[1:58:27] now i'm just going to close this up
[1:58:31] this morning because like i said i
[1:58:33] realize right now it's going to take a
[1:58:35] long time
[1:58:37] to preach this but as long as you want
[1:58:40] to hang in there
[1:58:42] we will grow with it
[1:58:45] you hear that we'll grow with it
[1:58:49] so it so hit that he
[1:58:52] adam bypassed that and that's what he
[1:58:55] said he said
[1:58:57] but we we we we had come first he said
[1:59:01] and so we read we read down here in
[1:59:04] paragraph
[1:59:05] 69 he said but
[1:59:09] you see in order to stem temptation
[1:59:13] you had to bypass the theophany
[1:59:17] so you bypass the body
[1:59:21] that he had prepared for you
[1:59:25] before the foundation of
[1:59:28] the world
[1:59:33] okay that body is
[1:59:36] and where does that body
[1:59:39] lie it's in the
[1:59:42] thinking of god it's in
[1:59:46] the plan of god
[1:59:51] it's there because
[1:59:55] he thought it it
[1:59:59] exists because that body exists
[2:00:02] in him right
[2:00:06] let's go back to first john
[2:00:11] in the beginning was the word
[2:00:15] the thoughts of god right
[2:00:18] the the uh the
[2:00:21] attributes of god and
[2:00:24] the word was with
[2:00:27] god and the word
[2:00:31] was god and the same was
[2:00:34] in the beginning with god
[2:00:37] another word that is the
[2:00:40] person that the
[2:00:45] all-encompassing
[2:00:47] alone god did he
[2:00:50] formed himself into a
[2:00:53] person the word
[2:00:59] not two one
[2:01:02] the untouchable unseen
[2:01:06] unknowing invisible
[2:01:09] no way to even even know he is god
[2:01:13] covering all things a fountain of many
[2:01:16] color
[2:01:17] uh this great invisible
[2:01:21] i am the i am
[2:01:24] all of a sudden conforms himself
[2:01:28] into a person the
[2:01:32] word word
[2:01:35] person that person
[2:01:38] was god that person
[2:01:42] was with god
[2:01:45] that person was in the beginning
[2:01:50] in the beginning was the word the first
[2:01:52] works in the bible are as in the
[2:01:54] beginning god
[2:01:55] now the revelation comes farther because
[2:01:58] they've seen jesus christ
[2:02:00] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:02:02] word was with
[2:02:04] god and the word was god and this game
[2:02:08] was in the beginning with god
[2:02:10] that was the word that person
[2:02:14] was god in theophany or
[2:02:18] body form not
[2:02:21] flesh form
[2:02:26] body form how many wants your same body
[2:02:30] back
[2:02:32] no i'm going to be a lot better looking
[2:02:35] over there
[2:02:42] i don't want this body bat praise god
[2:02:47] right so all right now listen he says
[2:02:51] all things were made by
[2:02:55] him and without him
[2:02:59] was not anything made that was
[2:03:02] made
[2:03:06] you understand that that theophany
[2:03:10] was made by him that's the body so when
[2:03:14] moses showed up
[2:03:15] it wasn't in this fleshly body it died
[2:03:18] it was in the body
[2:03:20] that was made for him in the beginning
[2:03:25] before the foundation of the world
[2:03:28] so what they did is that they didn't
[2:03:31] get a fleshly body they were standing
[2:03:34] there
[2:03:35] like a projected picture
[2:03:39] into this fleshly dimension
[2:03:43] so that they could sit there and they
[2:03:45] could recognize them
[2:03:47] they could see them they had bodies
[2:03:50] but they weren't fleshly bodies they
[2:03:53] were
[2:03:53] theophany bodies
[2:03:58] you couldn't kill them again
[2:04:04] i hope that kind of gives you a little
[2:04:08] touch of of of
[2:04:11] what that uh of of what that uh
[2:04:17] of what that he was right because you
[2:04:20] couldn't kill this person
[2:04:22] he said the true revelation of matt this
[2:04:25] paragraph 95
[2:04:27] now the true revelation of malchezadet
[2:04:29] comes into view
[2:04:31] what he was god the word
[2:04:39] before he became flesh god
[2:04:43] the word god the
[2:04:46] person melchised because he had
[2:04:53] to be no one else could be immortal like
[2:04:55] him
[2:04:56] see he had father and mother
[2:04:59] he see see i had
[2:05:03] father and mother you did too jesus had
[2:05:07] father
[2:05:08] and mother but this man had no father
[2:05:12] he had no mother jesus had a time
[2:05:16] he started
[2:05:21] this man didn't jesus gave his life
[2:05:26] this man couldn't because
[2:05:30] he was life
[2:05:36] and in him was life
[2:05:39] and the life was the light of men
[2:05:43] this man couldn't because he was life
[2:05:48] and it's the same self same
[2:05:51] man all the time i hope god reveals it
[2:05:55] to
[2:05:56] the self same person
[2:06:01] we're going to finish now if
[2:06:06] if i can bring myself to do it
[2:06:13] so let's go now back to paragraph
[2:06:16] 55 he says now notice
[2:06:20] his attributes and then we talked about
[2:06:22] that he says
[2:06:24] he says saint john the first
[2:06:27] chapter and the first verse
[2:06:30] notice this right so we just did that
[2:06:35] okay in the beginning
[2:06:39] but before the eternal notice in the
[2:06:42] beginning was the word
[2:06:44] and when the time began it was
[2:06:47] word but before it was word
[2:06:51] it was attribute a thought then it was
[2:06:55] expressed
[2:06:56] in the beginning was the expression
[2:06:59] the word now we're getting
[2:07:03] to where melchizedek is
[2:07:06] that th that's this mysterious person
[2:07:11] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:07:14] word
[2:07:15] was with god you understand
[2:07:18] there's melchizedek they're that
[2:07:22] mysterious person the empty s
[2:07:25] all eternal space god forming himself
[2:07:28] into a person that person was his
[2:07:32] thought express
[2:07:33] the name of that person was melkisha dad
[2:07:43] he was the prince of salem we'll get
[2:07:46] into that
[2:07:47] tonight there's that great person
[2:07:51] this one person the god
[2:07:54] became the person why
[2:07:57] because he wanted to express himself
[2:08:01] the word is an expression before he
[2:08:04] expressed himself
[2:08:05] he became a person because he was going
[2:08:09] to create
[2:08:10] people people that were worthy
[2:08:13] to be justified people that could be
[2:08:17] cleansed people that could receive his
[2:08:20] word
[2:08:20] they were created to be justified they
[2:08:23] were created
[2:08:24] they were worthy in the beginning
[2:08:29] oh i'm getting to it hallelujah
[2:08:33] okay so he says that's where he was
[2:08:37] and and he said that was before he
[2:08:40] became flesh
[2:08:44] right but he became he came
[2:08:48] became flesh
[2:08:52] because we were in a fleshly condition
[2:09:00] so he had to wipe our flesh record clean
[2:09:04] and we just read that remember he came
[2:09:06] into the church so he could clean it up
[2:09:09] and dwell in it he said
[2:09:13] his first being he said
[2:09:16] now we're getting where melchizedek is
[2:09:18] this mysterious person
[2:09:20] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:09:22] words was with god
[2:09:23] and the word was god and the word was
[2:09:25] made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:09:27] hold that there for notice now we're
[2:09:30] talking about melchizedek before he
[2:09:33] became
[2:09:34] jesus he said you don't hear about
[2:09:37] melchizedek
[2:09:38] anymore because he became jesus
[2:09:42] but we we've got to know this
[2:09:46] person ever to really understand
[2:09:50] what it was that was done for us
[2:09:55] he said he says first spirit
[2:09:59] he says god supernatural all right
[2:10:03] the great eternal that's the god we
[2:10:06] couldn't touch or feel or
[2:10:07] anything secondly he began to form
[2:10:11] himself towards flesh in a theophany
[2:10:15] called the word
[2:10:18] a body a person
[2:10:22] god created himself a person
[2:10:26] with bringing us all his attributes in
[2:10:28] one
[2:10:29] in the word in a theophany
[2:10:32] form a body form a
[2:10:36] person god became a person
[2:10:41] because he was going to create persons
[2:10:46] so he became something
[2:10:50] that he could fellowship with you
[2:10:53] he created you a person god can't
[2:10:56] fellowship with a dog
[2:10:58] he can't fellowship with a horse now we
[2:11:01] call it fellowship
[2:11:03] but you can't become one with them
[2:11:08] you can't unite with them they'll obey
[2:11:10] you they'll respect you
[2:11:12] you can train them but there wasn't
[2:11:14] something you could have a union with
[2:11:17] so god became a person because he was
[2:11:20] going to create
[2:11:21] persons that he could become one with
[2:11:24] they had to be worthy enough for him to
[2:11:27] give his life for
[2:11:29] they had to be where he could cleanse
[2:11:31] them
[2:11:33] he could fill them he could unite with
[2:11:35] them
[2:11:37] he he said we're about this is the state
[2:11:42] this is paragraph 57
[2:11:46] then this is the state he was in
[2:11:49] when he meant abraham was called
[2:11:53] melchizedek he was in the form of a
[2:11:57] theophany
[2:12:01] that's what the theophany is it's
[2:12:04] the body
[2:12:07] that the word took form in
[2:12:12] so when abraham appeared he was in that
[2:12:16] body
[2:12:16] that god had in his mind when
[2:12:20] when uh samuel was there
[2:12:23] he was in that body because this earthly
[2:12:26] body to be dissolved
[2:12:28] you have one waiting for you
[2:12:31] and so so now we go back to paragraph
[2:12:33] 64. now we're going to
[2:12:35] wrap around the corner and
[2:12:38] we're going to um
[2:12:42] close this thought up he says
[2:12:46] now god in this stage
[2:12:50] in its stage of creation
[2:12:53] later formed into flesh jesus
[2:12:57] he says from what from the great
[2:13:01] beginning
[2:13:02] spirit then came down
[2:13:05] to be in the word bringing
[2:13:08] itself out the word
[2:13:12] doesn't yet make it
[2:13:15] itself it's just spoke out
[2:13:18] amorphy just spoke out god
[2:13:21] changing so the first
[2:13:24] what the the great all
[2:13:28] world all eternal
[2:13:32] god changes himself into a
[2:13:35] person
[2:13:39] that he takes on the theophany
[2:13:42] form in other words the body
[2:13:46] that he prepared him for himself
[2:13:52] he takes on this great
[2:13:55] form so he out the word doesn't yet make
[2:13:59] itself it's just spoken out
[2:14:02] changing god changing from an eternal
[2:14:06] into a person the word
[2:14:09] something that can speak talk
[2:14:13] touch don't think of the word as
[2:14:16] text
[2:14:22] can you get that out of your mind it's
[2:14:24] not text
[2:14:26] the bible is not the word
[2:14:33] it's a record
[2:14:37] of the word but without revelation the
[2:14:42] record
[2:14:42] kills but with the spirit
[2:14:45] the record gives life
[2:14:52] so we automatically say word we think
[2:14:55] what
[2:14:56] bible
[2:15:02] oh we've made this sacred
[2:15:08] so sacred that we let it cut us off
[2:15:16] from the revelation that
[2:15:20] the person hid himself
[2:15:24] in text form but
[2:15:27] man can't see it it has to be what
[2:15:34] revealed
[2:15:36] so you have to be able to see the person
[2:15:39] that was in the beginning with god
[2:15:43] they wrote all about that and then he
[2:15:46] became
[2:15:46] flesh and they wrote all about that
[2:15:50] and everybody drew their conclusions
[2:15:54] from what man wrote and they were never
[2:15:57] able to come and meet the person
[2:16:05] and they created all kinds of schools of
[2:16:08] thought
[2:16:08] called denomination and man would have
[2:16:11] never figured it out
[2:16:13] and they never will figure it out
[2:16:16] because god does not give
[2:16:18] revelation for something that he's not
[2:16:22] but he promised in the last days
[2:16:25] that this same word spirit would return
[2:16:29] in this day and reveal himself
[2:16:33] [Applause]
[2:16:36] but when he came to abraham
[2:16:40] he wasn't in a fleshly body
[2:16:43] he was in a recognizable form
[2:16:47] because god created that in the
[2:16:49] beginning
[2:16:50] to be a person
[2:16:54] because he wanted to have fellowship
[2:16:56] let's close up
[2:16:59] he says abraham when abraham met
[2:17:03] him he was melchizedek
[2:17:06] okay he says he said
[2:17:10] let's go back to the 64th verse
[2:17:13] later in the form of bless you jesus
[2:17:15] what from the great beginning spirit
[2:17:19] he came down the word a person
[2:17:24] the theophany the word
[2:17:27] bringing itself out the word doesn't yet
[2:17:31] make itself it's just spoke out amorphy
[2:17:34] later he becomes flesh
[2:17:38] jesus mortal to test
[2:17:41] taste death for all of us sinners
[2:17:48] it's hard to go past the flesh
[2:17:51] isn't it and to understand
[2:17:55] there was a realm before that
[2:17:59] where we existed right
[2:18:04] your name was on the book he knew you
[2:18:06] then a realm
[2:18:07] that you bypassed
[2:18:12] but is still there
[2:18:15] for you
[2:18:20] i i got to close because i'm just it's
[2:18:22] starting to get
[2:18:23] blow up he says when abraham meant
[2:18:26] him he was melchizedek here
[2:18:30] he unfolds here
[2:18:33] what all the attributes will do
[2:18:36] in the final end
[2:18:40] right every son of god
[2:18:44] son of abraham every son
[2:18:47] of faith right we're the children of
[2:18:49] abraham
[2:18:50] not the fleshly seed but the what seed
[2:18:54] the faith seed all the children of faith
[2:19:01] will absolutely do the same thing
[2:19:04] but i want you to watch how we have to
[2:19:08] come
[2:19:09] so we talked about that why we bypass
[2:19:12] this
[2:19:14] this is where i want you to catch this
[2:19:17] morning
[2:19:18] the beauty of this he he says
[2:19:22] so we see him revealed here
[2:19:26] in ruth and boaz as kinsmen redeemer
[2:19:32] how ha how he had to come
[2:19:36] in flesh now here he
[2:19:39] is revealed in kinsmen
[2:19:42] redeemer so he says here he appears to
[2:19:46] abraham
[2:19:48] he says abraham see me
[2:19:52] this is what you're going to become
[2:19:56] okay this this is what
[2:20:00] the body that i really had in mind for
[2:20:04] you
[2:20:04] so here is revealing of the kinsmen
[2:20:09] so who was melchizedek the title of this
[2:20:13] message is
[2:20:14] melchizedek kinsman
[2:20:17] redeemer he wasn't redeeming this flesh
[2:20:21] he was our nearest kin to our theophany
[2:20:30] that's where we were in him that's where
[2:20:33] our word body was
[2:20:35] that's where abraham's body was samuel's
[2:20:38] body was
[2:20:39] that's where the body was he wasn't
[2:20:42] redeeming this flesh he was the kinsmen
[2:20:45] redeemer
[2:20:46] of that body the word body from the
[2:20:49] beginning
[2:20:50] the other body we have he came to redeem
[2:20:54] us back
[2:20:55] to that body not redeem
[2:20:58] this body oh hallelujah
[2:21:24] jesus
[2:21:50] that's where the redeemer was that's
[2:21:52] where our kinsman was
[2:21:54] so the kinsmen had to be the nearest
[2:21:58] kin
[2:22:02] okay he was the nearest kin
[2:22:06] because he was the only one that was
[2:22:10] in that theophany form
[2:22:13] he was the first kin he was the first
[2:22:16] kin to abraham
[2:22:18] that's why abraham was able to go to
[2:22:20] that body
[2:22:21] jesus not yet being born that's why
[2:22:24] samuel was able to go to that body
[2:22:26] because melchizedek was the kinsmen
[2:22:30] redeemer
[2:22:31] the word is what redeemed you before the
[2:22:34] foundation of the world
[2:22:36] that person
[2:22:41] that one person
[2:22:44] that's our redeemer that's our kinsmen
[2:22:51] jesus was the lamb he took on the form
[2:22:54] of sin
[2:22:55] that person our kinsmen
[2:22:59] took on the form of sin offered himself
[2:23:03] as a
[2:23:04] sacrifice from our sin he says i have
[2:23:07] power
[2:23:07] to lay my life down and take it up again
[2:23:12] i do nothing unless the father
[2:23:17] who is in me melchizedek
[2:23:21] who is in me this person
[2:23:24] that is in my form
[2:23:27] this union
[2:23:34] who was it
[2:23:38] i don't want this body back
[2:23:42] i don't want this body redeemed
[2:23:45] you say well we take on a fleshly form
[2:23:47] again yes
[2:23:50] it'll be a glorified body
[2:23:54] that this word body
[2:23:58] can dwell in
[2:24:02] no sin no death
[2:24:05] no sickness but we keep thinking
[2:24:10] in our mind that he's here to redeem
[2:24:14] all the sin that's in this flesh and
[2:24:17] all the sorrow that's in this flesh and
[2:24:20] all the stuff in this flesh and one day
[2:24:22] i'm going to be free
[2:24:23] from all this and still have this
[2:24:28] no we're our minds
[2:24:32] are blocked by our bodies
[2:24:37] that's why he said the kingdom of god is
[2:24:39] within you
[2:24:40] that you can't comprehend the beginning
[2:24:43] or the end
[2:24:44] but he knew there would be a time
[2:24:47] amen when this would be opened up to us
[2:24:52] and we'd be able to see it yeah
[2:24:56] we'll be able to go back
[2:25:00] and begin to understand this plan of god
[2:25:03] unfolding the stage of the church ages
[2:25:07] the the acts of the apostles the act of
[2:25:11] the first age
[2:25:12] the second play act the second church
[2:25:15] age
[2:25:16] the third act the third church age all
[2:25:18] the way down to
[2:25:19] the final act where he comes down and
[2:25:24] it's it's like these theaters they have
[2:25:26] what do they call them living life
[2:25:28] theaters or
[2:25:29] something like that you go to branson
[2:25:31] and see and they show the great
[2:25:33] performance
[2:25:34] the mighty angel coming down hallelujah
[2:25:39] you know here he comes the mighty angel
[2:25:44] setting his foot on the land and sea the
[2:25:47] axe unfolding
[2:25:49] unfolding the seventh messenger angel
[2:25:52] coming up starting to reveal
[2:25:55] who the real kinsmen is the real kinsman
[2:25:59] redeemer was the word
[2:26:02] that you heard from and
[2:26:07] i know i didn't get into hearing from
[2:26:09] your theophany
[2:26:10] but maybe we'll touch on that a little
[2:26:13] bit tonight
[2:26:14] but the things begin to to come to pass
[2:26:17] now we all understand wait a minute it's
[2:26:20] never been about this body
[2:26:22] this is just the hickey in time this is
[2:26:25] just the bypass
[2:26:27] i bypassed that
[2:26:31] so if i bypassed it what does redeemer
[2:26:35] mean
[2:26:37] to bring back
[2:26:41] so the kinsman was to bring us back
[2:26:46] melchizedek was the nearest kin
[2:26:50] to the body that
[2:26:53] came from him
[2:26:57] he was the nearest king to our real body
[2:27:00] he was the nearest kin to what what
[2:27:04] was really in god's thinking and only
[2:27:08] the nearest kin
[2:27:09] could be the redeemer that's right and
[2:27:12] so melchizedek
[2:27:14] was our kinsman redeemer
[2:27:18] he showed abraham this is the body
[2:27:21] you'll have
[2:27:23] i'm going to go redeem you
[2:27:27] back to this body
[2:27:33] and how many uh i
[2:27:36] i know we sit back in and paul says
[2:27:41] if this earthly body be dissolved paul's
[2:27:44] caught up into the third heaven
[2:27:47] he said if this earthly body be
[2:27:49] dissolved
[2:27:50] oh we've got one waiting for us
[2:27:53] that's the one he came to redeem for us
[2:27:57] melchizedek was our kinsmen
[2:28:01] redeemer why was he our kinsmen
[2:28:05] because if we ever had eternal life we
[2:28:08] always had to turn off
[2:28:10] if you were in his thinking you had to
[2:28:13] be in his thinking
[2:28:14] so what is he redeeming us back to
[2:28:18] he's redeeming us back to god's
[2:28:21] original thinking amen oh
[2:28:24] it's a beautiful book it's a beautiful
[2:28:27] love story
[2:28:28] melchizedek our kinsmen
[2:28:32] redeemer he says here comes the full
[2:28:35] view
[2:28:36] of boaz and ruth
[2:28:40] our kinsmen redeemer
[2:28:43] i know it might take a while to set in
[2:28:47] but get the book we'll read some more
[2:28:49] quotes
[2:28:50] this evening as we uh fellowship
[2:28:54] on some more things that and just go
[2:28:57] through and read some more statements
[2:28:59] but i just wanted to bring that out
[2:29:03] this morning that you
[2:29:06] you see where we were
[2:29:10] how we were in the beginning how we were
[2:29:12] in our thinking
[2:29:13] we see how god made himself a person how
[2:29:16] he made a body
[2:29:17] this is the body that we could
[2:29:19] fellowship with god in
[2:29:20] how we unfold this plan so his
[2:29:23] attributes could come
[2:29:24] and now he's back
[2:29:28] redeeming the word melchizedek
[2:29:32] the person made flesh
[2:29:36] melchizedek made flesh
[2:29:40] the word melchizedek made flesh
[2:29:44] god becoming
[2:29:49] now a person deck the word becoming
[2:29:52] flesh
[2:29:52] veiling himself in a person to be our
[2:29:56] redeemer to bring us back
[2:29:59] to the word that we were
[2:30:02] in the beginning melchizedek our kinsmen
[2:30:07] redeemer so you understand all that a
[2:30:09] theophany body is
[2:30:11] is that god didn't create this body
[2:30:16] this body was born in sin shaped in
[2:30:20] iniquity
[2:30:21] came into the world speaking lies
[2:30:25] this body was the product of sin
[2:30:28] get over it
[2:30:34] amen
[2:30:37] you don't want to be this ugly shell of
[2:30:39] a person you are anyway
[2:30:42] it's subject to everything
[2:30:46] i want to be what he wants me
[2:30:50] and billy covered that wednesday night
[2:30:52] all about god had a plan for your
[2:30:54] existence and he
[2:30:56] he he had a plan i don't i don't need to
[2:30:58] go
[2:30:59] over all that again with you
[2:31:04] but if you could understand
[2:31:08] that this is just a
[2:31:11] just a little space of time
[2:31:14] so he can manifest his attributes of
[2:31:18] healing
[2:31:19] and and you were created so he could do
[2:31:22] that
[2:31:23] but he's not redeeming you back
[2:31:26] to this he's redeeming you
[2:31:29] back to that original
[2:31:33] theophany body
[2:31:37] the body that was prepared for you
[2:31:40] before the foundation of the world
[2:31:45] the body that moses was in the body that
[2:31:48] samuel was in
[2:31:49] the body that elijah was in the body
[2:31:53] that peter
[2:31:53] in them saw there with melchizedek
[2:31:57] when he was glorified
[2:32:01] on mount transfiguration
[2:32:04] that's what our kinsmen redeemed us back
[2:32:07] to
[2:32:08] our kinsmen was dwelling
[2:32:11] in jesus christ the great theophany
[2:32:16] person of god oh i just hope it thrilled
[2:32:20] you
[2:32:21] the way it thrills me this morning
[2:32:24] anyway it's late so go get some lunch
[2:32:28] and
[2:32:29] and grab your who is this melchizedek
[2:32:31] book or put it on your tablet
[2:32:34] and then we'll come back at five o'clock
[2:32:36] and read a few more
[2:32:38] pages in a few more chapters so our
[2:32:42] first
[2:32:42] sermon was melchizedek the beginning of
[2:32:46] our existence
[2:32:48] our second sermon and then we touched a
[2:32:51] little bit on what we bypassed
[2:32:53] and then our second sermon is
[2:32:55] melchizedek
[2:32:56] kinsmen redeemer and if we can start
[2:33:01] moving and let me say this
[2:33:04] in closing i believe with all my heart
[2:33:08] that god is trying to move our minds
[2:33:11] to the supernatural
[2:33:17] do you understand that we're too
[2:33:21] carnally bound and the carnal mind
[2:33:24] is enmity with god but the spiritual
[2:33:28] mind
[2:33:28] is life he's trying to move us
[2:33:32] to more of a spiritual understanding
[2:33:36] and more into the supernatural realm
[2:33:39] amen not just for a taste and glimpse
[2:33:43] of miracles but the understanding of the
[2:33:48] true existence
[2:33:49] and true spiritual realm of the true
[2:33:53] spiritual believer let's stand together
[2:33:56] this morning brother billy will dismiss
[2:33:58] us in
[2:33:59] prayer oh i like the sound of it
[2:34:03] melchizedek kinsman redeemer amen let us
[2:34:08] pray
[2:34:09] amen we'll let everybody that has to run
[2:34:11] to the restroom
[2:34:13] uh hurry up and do that and then as
[2:34:16] soon as it's still we'll say a prayer
[2:34:19] okay let us pray our gracious heavenly
[2:34:23] father
[2:34:25] lord i'm too frail of a human being
[2:34:28] without the vocabulary
[2:34:31] but father i'm glad that you didn't make
[2:34:33] it enticing words
[2:34:36] but father you made it revelation
[2:34:39] and i pray father i know we've got high
[2:34:41] school students and
[2:34:44] and in so many different
[2:34:48] levels of thought and
[2:34:51] spiritual growth and
[2:34:54] some people are in such battles with the
[2:34:57] flesh
[2:34:59] others are in a great battle trying to
[2:35:02] find
[2:35:02] peace and where they belong
[2:35:05] and father
[2:35:10] where they should settle in and
[2:35:14] what their purpose is and they
[2:35:17] are tossed about and
[2:35:19] [Music]
[2:35:21] and by nature we go to and fro lord
[2:35:26] because this is in our home
[2:35:30] and just the fact that we're eternal
[2:35:32] beings creates
[2:35:36] such a such a confusion for us in this
[2:35:40] dimension
[2:35:42] but lord to have it revealed to us that
[2:35:44] you've
[2:35:46] already performed the kinsmen sacrifice
[2:35:50] to bring us back to the theophany that
[2:35:55] we really were created to dwell in
[2:35:59] that gives me such comfort
[2:36:02] to know that the great high priest
[2:36:08] of our salvation as he's described
[2:36:15] the king of righteousness the king of
[2:36:18] peace
[2:36:20] the high priest melchizedek
[2:36:24] [Music]
[2:36:26] was our kinsman
[2:36:30] to bring us back to that original state
[2:36:34] he came here veiled in flesh
[2:36:40] he became jesus in the form of jesus
[2:36:45] to be our kinsman redeemer
[2:36:50] lord it's it's beyond comprehension
[2:36:55] [Music]
[2:36:57] that you would do that for us father we
[2:37:00] can't even
[2:37:01] get the understanding that we have a
[2:37:03] whole another body
[2:37:04] waiting for it
[2:37:08] oh death where's your victory oh grave
[2:37:11] where's your stain
[2:37:13] i have a crown of righteousness laid up
[2:37:16] for me
[2:37:19] i fought a good fight i ran a good race
[2:37:23] now i'm gonna go get the body
[2:37:27] that i've longed to live in the one i
[2:37:30] saw when i was caught up into the third
[2:37:32] heaven
[2:37:36] the one i saw you in lord
[2:37:39] in that great pillar of fire
[2:37:41] [Music]
[2:37:43] lord i i trust it can just open deeper
[2:37:46] to us
[2:37:47] forgive us of our weakness
[2:37:50] the lord i trust that every person in
[2:37:55] this

[2:38:02] will realize how much you love them
[2:38:07] how that you long to give them their
[2:38:11] hearts desire

[2:50:50] read
[2:50:51] in the
[2:50:55] 37th verse
[2:50:57] of the scripture it says
[2:51:01] now when they heard this they were
[2:51:04] pricked in their heart
[2:51:07] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[2:51:10] apostles
[2:51:11] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:51:16] now peter had the keys to the kingdom
[2:51:18] remember
[2:51:19] he said and peter said unto repent and
[2:51:22] be baptized
[2:51:23] every one of you in the name of jesus
[2:51:26] christ for the remission of sins
[2:51:29] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:51:31] holy ghost
[2:51:33] for the promise is unto you
[2:51:36] to your children and to all that are
[2:51:39] far off even as many as the lord our god
[2:51:42] shall call
[2:51:44] and with many other words did he testify
[2:51:48] and exhort
[2:51:49] saying save yourself from this up
[2:51:51] towards
[2:51:52] generation amen we're
[2:51:55] we're thrilled when our children are
[2:51:58] baptized my grand daughter
[2:52:02] kaylee being baptized it's always good
[2:52:06] to see young people that want to
[2:52:08] participate in the law there may be
[2:52:11] challenges ahead in life is we know
[2:52:14] our children grow up from teenagers and
[2:52:16] then teenagers to young adults and
[2:52:19] they begin to fight the fight of life
[2:52:22] but just this little act today god said
[2:52:26] that
[2:52:26] she had a promise and we believe that
[2:52:29] one day that promise will meet up
[2:52:32] and it'll become a reality in her life
[2:52:35] so we're happy that she's doing this
[2:52:37] today amen according to the word of god
[2:52:41] and the scriptures this that told us to
[2:52:44] go into all the world
[2:52:46] baptizing them in the name of the father
[2:52:49] the son
[2:52:50] and the holy ghost peter with the keys
[2:52:53] to the heaven
[2:52:54] and a divine revelation carried out that
[2:52:57] commission by baptizing in the name of
[2:53:00] the lord jesus christ
[2:53:02] so according to the revelation brought
[2:53:04] to us in our age
[2:53:05] and the word of god we baptize you
[2:53:08] kaylee in the name of the lord jesus

[2:53:53] to me the other day and he said
[2:53:55] brother david he said i thought about
[2:53:57] that five minutes
[2:54:00] you know the five minutes on
[2:54:03] before after the rapture
[2:54:07] on the one side and then the five
[2:54:10] minutes on the other side
[2:54:13] and he had tears running down his cheek
[2:54:15] he says i want to be on the five minutes
[2:54:18] on the other side
[2:54:21] [Applause]
[2:54:26] in in life they say that people
[2:54:31] become most successful when they have a
[2:54:34] a goal to reach
[2:54:38] in sales training when they have new
[2:54:42] people they say picture
[2:54:45] something in your mind that you want to
[2:54:48] buy
[2:54:50] if someone was selling pots and pans or
[2:54:54] vacuum cleaners whatever they said if
[2:54:57] they knew they were working towards
[2:54:59] something
[2:55:00] they were always more successful
[2:55:03] and i remember matthew
[2:55:06] started his business because
[2:55:10] he wanted to buy an airplane ticket to
[2:55:13] go to a
[2:55:14] see a friend i don't know if it was his
[2:55:16] friend's wedding or what
[2:55:18] but he had a goal and i thought now
[2:55:20] here's a man that has a goal
[2:55:24] you understand he wants to live because
[2:55:26] he wants to be on the other five minutes
[2:55:29] amen are we living for the resurrection

[2:55:36] hearts on fire
[2:55:38] we're just not living because it's right
[2:55:41] we're living because there's a reward
[2:55:43] for them it hasn't even entered into the
