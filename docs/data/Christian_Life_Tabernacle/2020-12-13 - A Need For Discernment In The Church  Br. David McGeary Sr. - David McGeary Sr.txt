Description:
A Need For Discernment In The Church
Br. David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service: December 13,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

our hearts lord let us lay aside every thought of the world lord outside and lord just ask you to help us lord just to receive this morning lord glory to you lord just guide us and direct us lord and speak to our hearts today lord we ask in jesus name amen amen happy to be god in his presence this morning and certainly want to welcome amen everyone who's braved the weather to be here amen i know we we oftentimes think about sunday is one of the days with the west worst weather amen certainly thankfully we could be gathering his presence he may like to invite brother mike this morning for our psalm reading amen god bless you morning you know um one thing that's so encouraging to me about the scriptures is no longer no matter how long ago they were written they're still as relevant today as they were the day they were written amen you know what's even more amazing is as you read the scriptures you know about the events or the circumstances or the people that happened is how nothing has changed you know when we read in psalm 73 which is what we're going to read this morning this is written perhaps 3 000 years ago this could easily be the cry of any believer in 2020. you know and for all of our learning and all of our advancements in technology how cultured we think we are how sophisticated we think we've become how civilized or fashionable we think we've become this is still the same old world with the same old human race that still acts the same way still pursues the same interests still pursues the same frivolous pursuits no matter how well they think they're covering it up nothing has changed in three thousand years it's the way of man in fact man cannot change unless there's a supernatural encounter you know they can try to modernize it they can try to educate their way they can try to cover it up with religion and politics and civilization but they're still the same old corrupt human beings that frankly we've all been since the beginning of time outside of a supernatural intervention you know and as david is you know crying out to the lord in psalm 73 and he looks at how all the world around him behaves and how they're acting you know how they're perc with all their pursuits all their interests all their behaviors all the way that they act how they seem to enjoy themselves the things that they focus on and he you know is expressing his frustration and how they seem to continue to just endure success and to prosper and to grow and to just continue to to carry on and meanwhile he finds himself struggling just to get just to make it through you know he describes how he's barely able to hold it together in verse 2 it says but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nice slipped for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked he says in verse 12 behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency you know at this moment of weakness you know david is beginning to question am i uh am i a fool for not pursuing the same interests the same pursuits focusing on the same thing that everyone else around me is they seem to be achieving such success and such prosperity while i struggle this is david a man after god's own heart three thousand years ago and this could just as easily be a discouraged believer in 2020. nothing's really changed this book isn't so obsolete after all but then he says in verse 16 when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their end surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou cast them down into destruction this is also just as true today as it was 3 000 years ago there's there's your answer to get to the sanctuary of god you know david found his answer in the sanctuary not in a temple not in a tabernacle not in a building but being able to find that place where god is and he walked out with a new perspective nothing's changed in three thousand years man is still the same way they always were and that sanctuary is still there for entering into and finding an escape david finally says in verse 25 whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever so i just want to encourage you today nothing has changed you know when you look around and you see those around us that seemingly are you know trying to tell you that you should be as a human being pursuing this this thing or that this should be your priority these should be in your interests these should be your pursuits whether it's to educate or to be successful or to make a name for yourself or put skins on the wall or whatever it is and at the end of the day there's a sanctuary where you can get perspective that that's just a slippery path to destruction so encourage you to spend time in that sanctuary that you can you know learn that these pursuits are are nothing compared to the pursuit of him so you know i'm reminded as we start to read psalm 73 of what it says in hebrews concerning moses esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt he had respect and to the recompense of the reward just as true today as it was three thousand years ago let's read psalm 73 together it says this truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my step said well i slipped for i was envious of the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked for there are no bans in their death but their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore pride compasses them about as a chain violence covert them as a garment their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are rung out to them and they say how does god know and is there knowledge in the most high behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i therein surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castest them down into destruction how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors as a dream when one awakens so o lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reigns so foolish was i and ignorant i was as a beast before thee nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast hold in me by my right hand thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee my flesh and my heart fail it but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou has destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all thy works amen god bless you and have your seats [Music] yep have you been to jesus [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh and will your soul be ready [Music]

[Applause] [Music] amen aren't you glad for his power amen amen but mark david as a special if it could come at this time uh last sunday i guess pastor's a sermon kind of hit you know he hit a a call in me i have family members who you know questioned the message and at a point in time they walked out of it and i could sit down at that moment and also think okay i have questions too but there is something within me that said there's no way i could go and hear something like this you know i grew up in it but i have my questions and then when i did question it i couldn't go nowhere i was like if i didn't do everything right and if i found myself in hell it wasn't because the message was wrong it was because maybe i just didn't live up to the expectation and every day i prayed to god i said just i just want to leave up to the expectation that's what i want i fall short every day but that's just to say please lord this is nothing but the truth absolutely the truth you could go everywhere in the world you can't find nothing like this nothing you know it just brings me joy i drive on the road i was like oh my goodness a lot of people don't know what they're missing um and uh i was just thinking and the song came to my my mind and said uh we have an encore that keeps the soul and that's what i'll be singing this morning will your hand cold in the storms of life when the clouds unfold

can express the wonder of his glory and and the goodness that he has for us amen before we go to prayer this morning just i'd like to let you know that brother cosman and some of the musicians uh went into a recording studio and picked some of the songs that you've all enjoyed and some of our special singers and they put it on a little cd and it's in the back of the church for for you to take it's just a present to you all and i don't know if our calendars have got here yet but we'll have our calendars for you again this year so you love the lord this morning you know the best thing about it he loves you whether you love him or not and he died for you whether you accept it or not and he cares for you so let's approach him this morning trusting that he'll be our portion our heavenly father we come to you this morning or we're grateful this morning father that we're going to have a baptism on [Music] father that's so wonderful it's what life's about father i pray this morning that your word would come to our hearts this morning and that we would receive from it that which we have need of that from your word father that we would receive the spirit to create the atmosphere that you so desired your church to have we ask you to bless us this morning father may we all realize that we play an important part one with another there's no big eyes or little use there's not one part of the body that says they don't have need of the other part father but the unity of the word and the unity of you and your bride is what your heart so longs for we ask you to be with us this morning as we endeavor to just serve you we ask you to bless us now in jesus name we pray amen amen amen god bless you this morning let's open our bibles and and read a scripture found in hebrews in the first three verses of the first chapter of hebrews and um we want to play a small portion of the message this morning we want to talk a little bit before it and then play it and try to express to you what we're trying to achieve by doing this part and playing this part of the sermon so in hebrews the first chapter and the first three verses it says god who at sun dried times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets cath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds and being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the majesty on high father bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated you know i think it's very important as christians and i i it's kind of redundant to say this but we should never lose focus that really what everything is about is about the lord jesus and it and the reason that it's all about him is because that was the way that god chose to express himself so in the beginning was god in the beginning god everything started with our great father which is in heaven and it was by his will and his choosing that he chose for things to unfold the way that they unfold he's in control we don't think a lot of times he's in control we don't realize a lot of things that everything's right on time that everything's been planned that we know he has a permissive will that he will allow he'll allow man to go down his own road he'll allow man to make his own choices but all the time he has a plan to return you back to his perfect will and many times it's just because everything collapses around us other times he just gently makes little moves in our life and just kind of does this and does that and we don't even know it and we're back to where that he would have us to be because he's a good shepherd and the shepherd knows his sheep and he knows his sheep by name and it goes out before them and he leadeth them to still waters he leadeth them to green pastures it is so as difficult as things seem and and it seems in a way that it's hard for us to find our course a lot of times in these times but we always want to remember that it's always been based on what the intentions of the father was and god had intentions i'd like to read this uh statement from the church age book and kind of could just move towards what it is that i want us to become conscious of this morning and i think if we can become conscious of this it takes a lot of burden off of us and i think it's important for a christian to be burden-free because the world is is just uh they're so tall and and and just uh so unsure of themselves and there's one thing that we should be anchored in and secure about is that we have been purchased with a price we our names were written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world that we are secure in him and and we are we're secure in him because of his ability to keep us his ability to transform us his ability to intervene in our lives and and like i've always had this definition of grace because we know that we live by grace and to me grace is a decision that was made from the throne of god a decision grace isn't just by happenstance grace isn't something that you stumble in on grace is a decision made by god to intervene in your life and change the inevitable result of your choice or actions so like you're on your way for destruction because of the choice you've made grace sits back on the throne and says this guy's gonna wreck but i'm gonna intervene and change the outcome and you know what happens you get a blow out it keeps you from an accident we get out of the car all upset about the blowout and we don't even realize it could have been the grace of god amen i think he goes so unrecognized in our lives and and his real presence that he has with his children and the real way he watches over him and the real way he cares for him he goes so unnoticed but that undying love he doesn't even need recognition because that's the essence of what he is is that love and i know that that's what our desire to enter into is that capstone the thing that caps off the church the the final crowning of his achievement on earth that's what a capstone is it's the final crowning it's the final achievement it's the final thing that marks and puts the mark on the work of the of the building and of the church is when he taps it off and and we know that the has to have the right cornerstone but the same that was the cornerstone becomes the capstone it was the love of god that sent his son to the earth to redeem his children back he could have made a whole brand new batch better than this batch but he chose to love us he chose to forgive us he chose to pray pay the price for us and he so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that's the foundation that we're built on is the love of god that god so loved the world and no other foundation can a man lay than that which is laid which is christ jesus that's what we're built on we're built on the lord we're built on what that he is that he as hebrews said that he was the brightness and the glory of god that's that he was the expressed image of god that's what we're built on we're built on the express image of god and his will for his church is that the church be capped off with that that finally that what was in the foundation is now expressed in the capstone so both expressions become one and it's back to husband and wife that same love joined together in unity it it becomes something that uh is is so beautifully uh uh orchestrated and and what he wanted to achieve and that's what he's trying to achieve is is to have a a church that's like him that's like him not a bunch of know-it-alls but the church that's like him that that he can express himself through for the last expression of god to the world is his word living in a redeemed people not just left in a book to be read and for a man to make his own choices because we know that this killeth but this with the spirit of god is life and truth and and and to see that union and that expression that that the world can look and see because there's so many voices now but you are a shining light you are the salt of the earth you are the living beings that are making contact with the world around you and there's nobody can take your place the prophet of god expressed it one time he said it's like looking out over a great vast dark plane if you could just picture a great blanket of darkness out there and then little specks of light sitting all on that like looking at us black sky at night and you see these little stars up there and that's the christian life that's the spirit-filled believer shining light in in the world that's around them you are more important out in your life if i express it this way in the world than you are in this building this morning i hope that's not misunderstood but the the value of your purpose the value of your creation the the plan of god was to transfer his life in you so you could transfer that life to others that was his plan from the beginning he transferred his life into christ that christ could transfer his life into us and so that's what that's what we've got to get become more conscious of that's that we've gotta kind of let the reality of that set in that that we have a mission if an another word for a mission is a commission we have a commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel that doesn't mean be a preacher you understand that means to to by your life to to bring bring present and make known the life of christ that that's what we're supposed to do the world is make known the life of christ not what we believe but what possesses us that we are purchased with a price we are possessed by a spirit i like what brother mike said in his exhortation this morning is all of us are the same without divine intervention there would be no change in us amen we're born in sin we're shaped in iniquity we come into the world speaking lies if there's not an outside intervention to change our nature well what changes our nature it takes another nature to change in nature so the only way for our nature to be changed is for another nature to come in now that can be us evil spirit but if it's the nature of christ that's changed and the nature of christ that's come in us then we'd be christ light and that's something that we've got to continue to achieve and bring our flesh under subjection and so as we read this it says this is in the church age book and it's in the i believe it's the uh uh uh the i think it's the thigh tyra church age and uh so uh let me just make sure that that's where it is so yeah okay yeah uh yeah i know maybe it's the summoning church age let me just check i can find it here i didn't mark the church age that it was in uh down well maybe that's not important yeah well this this statement yes i think it's that church age so it says now we can see his association with the word he is the word yeah it just get when you you understand what he said here in hebrews at when when we read it in hebrews he says he who being the brightness this is hebrews 1 and 3. i don't know if you can put it up or not who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person so jesus was the expressed image of his person or if we could say it this way jesus had the personality of god that's what jesus had he had the personality of god but he learned obedience by the things he suffered so in other words he was tempted in every manner wherein we are tempted but yet that there was no sin found in him so he overcame and that's what he said i will give you grace i will i will send my spirit that you can overcome as i have overcame so he wants to transform transfer to us the power by which he overcame and our vain selves that we are we keep trying to overcome ourselves we get all bowed up and we get all headstrong and we're gonna overcome this and we're gonna get this victory and i'm gonna win this time and you finally are going to come to the place where you're just going to have to fall down and say i can not do it without you help me i want to be better i want to have a better spirit i want to win the victory so we see that he's the expressed image of the person and upholds all things by his word of his power so everything's done by his word and we can see his association with the word the word that is who he is the word in his name john 1 1 where it says in the beginning was the word the root form which we have our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concept that's on page 162 of the regular church age book which means the thought or concept it has a double meaning of thought and speech now a thought expressed is a word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful john says the concept of god was expressed in jesus think of that the concept of god was expressed in jesus in other words god had a concept i used to like to go to car shows until they got so expensive they we're not going to buy one but i like to look at the concept cars and that's what someone has in their mind what might be a car of the future or or what they what was expressed well what god had in his mind was expressed in the lord jesus so what and that was the word so that was what his what jesus was he was the concept of god expressed he was what god had in his mind what was expressed now remember all this time that god had a thought of what he wanted you to express the part that he wanted you to play in all that and so this is on page 108 in the this church age book it says god's intention for his create for his creation man is to express his words so that was his intention for his creation was to express his words now that's why it's so beautiful when it was shared with us that he said to us god's will is his word we wonder what god want me to do what's his will for my life his will is his word and and what god's uh uh intention was his his intention for his creation man is to express his words or to express his thought or to be a continuation of himself because that's what he wanted he wanted to have fellowship he wanted to see himself duplicated he wanted to he wanted to see people that were expressing his words expressing his thoughts if it being an expression of himself that he could sit down and say my children they live after me not only do they live after me but they live by me they're my offspring they're they're my creation how can we say that we're his creation and then be something that's totally opposite of anything that he is you know i mean we're a result of the creation process that he placed in in in the carnal being of being able to create children and have living souls but his own are like him that's why he said you know that you are my disciples by your love one for another he never identified the church by their doctrinal argument but their identification was the same love that he had in him was in them and then that expression paul said what good does it do me if i have all these gifts and all these things and i and i can do all these things and i don't have love uh from within my heart it becomes profitless and we're not going to profit anything in this world we're not going to move forward we can grow in doctrine we can grow and intellect we can grow in understanding of the mysteries in those things but it's not going to profit anything until the love of god is shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit it's got to come down to that he says god's intention for his creation man is to express his words in genesis adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed and that's the foundation this morning for the message that i would like to place before us this morning and that is the great need for discernment in the church and a real understanding of what discernment is if you don't have a a clear understanding of your purpose if you don't have a clear understanding of what god why god created you and why he called you and why he elected you if you if you can't settle that clear vision in your mind and in your heart that you understand what you're about when you wake up in the morning and what lies before you in your day and what it is that you're supposed to accomplish for that day at the end and if you don't have that vision that i'm going to walk out my door this morning and i'm going to show that christ jesus lives and he's not up there he's not hid in here but this is revealed in me a life lived by the word is an expression of the word and that was god's intention for man was to live by that word if we fail to see that you you might get up and think i've got to work today because i've got a bill to pay and i've got my house payment due and echo and i and i might get fired and you carry all that load out the door you know but if you could walk out that door and say you know i've never seen a righteous man big bread today i'm going out into the world to let my light shine and he's the one that'll take care of me he's the one that got me this job if i lose this job i got another job waiting for me he's the one that runs my life the footsteps of the righteous are led by the lord if i put him first he'll take care of the rest now that's what we can walk out the door with we don't forget that now we're going to be settled in our heart i'm not going to let anything that comes my way change my vision or change my mission and that's satan's job is to throw a snare before us to catch us off guard to make us react a certain way he's always battling us and working against us it's just because that's what he wants to do he wants to make the word of god which is you of none effect that's why a root of bitterness defiles many so we could keep that vision if we could keep that so straight in front of us if we could understand that we have a purpose we have something that god intended to live by to express jesus christ to express the love of god in the world and if we have that vision and we have that understanding of the purpose of our life now we have the foundation for discernment and discernment is a very important part of christianity not the kind of discernment that the prophet of god had that that that we mixed what regular discernment is the regular discernment is to tell the the motive and the objective and the purpose and and the result of something it takes discernment to understand you stick your finger in the fire you get burned you can learn discernment when you see the same things come up or someone comes up and and and it's like it's like my my good friend danny fair he was that he was out at the truck stop and the guy came up to him and said you know i'd like to go to such-and-such place and and you could if you could buy me a ticket and all this stuff and he gave his spiel to danny and all of a sudden it dawned on danny i heard this before and then he looked at the guy a little closer and the guy had grown a beer he said hey how did you get back from the last time i bought you a ticket and the guy walked away me and leslie got called up to come to church and help somebody so we got in the car and we came over here a lady in the parking lot and she was asking money and we walked up and toured me looked down at her and we'd already helped this lady unless he said we helped you last time she said oh i'm sorry wrong church after a while you understand you learn to discern and discernment i want you to understand discernment's a very important part of you being able to carry out your mission okay i hope that we can do this so in hebrews put up hebrews um i i believe it's hebrews 5 and 14. let's just start with the 11th verse and i i make some of these statements because of the claims that we many times make about ourselves as being so us steeped in the mysteries of god and so learned in the things of the word of god and it says here it says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teacheth you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god which become the first principles of the oracles of god can you imagine when the church loses the very first principles of being one that speaks for god okay this is important because my heart's desire for us as the church is that we move forward in the things of god that the power of the lord can move in our midst that things are done decently in order that the love of god is shed abroad in our heart by the spirit and that god has the preeminence and he's pleased with us now i know he's not always pleased with me and i know that and i've got to work on that but he said being the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as having need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness for he is obeyed but strong meat belongeth to them which are full of age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil very important let's turn over to corinthians first corinthians the second chapter starting in the ninth verse and we'll read finish that chapter and then we'll move into our our lesson and be done here in in about 35 minutes hebrews this i mean excuse me first corinthians the second chapter and the ninth verse but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have it entered into the hearts of men the things which god hath prepared for them that love him oh my think of that the reward that's given just like our our our young candidate for baptism today she's making a choice for i'm going to serve god i know it's right again and she says the first step is repent and be baptized then i'm trusting that god will place his spirit in my life and help me lead and live a good life oh i wish i could express to her the reward that she's going to receive for that but we it hasn't been entered into our hearts what god's got it's so great it's so beyond any senses or reality that we have that for those that choose just think the first gift of god is eternal life then living that life for eternity in the most sublime thing that you could ever imagine you can't imagine you don't even have the ability to imagine what god's got prepared for you but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god so he gave us his spirit so we could know the things of god you can't know him in a carnal mind i believe the statement was made you can't even know god without the baptism of the holy spirit so that's why if you seek anything in your life ask god for his spirit lord i need more of your spirit ask him for spiritual discernment to discern and this is what we're talking about this morning the need for discernment so we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man whisman teacheth not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual it's a losing battle to try to mix spirit and carnality there are two different realms there are two different worlds they don't care you can't even know the things of god with the carnal mind the carnal mind of his enmity with god but the spiritual mind is life to think like god that's a challenge now as we but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolish under him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned we're talking about the need for discernment but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ so if we have his spirit we have his mind now i want to play as we close and then right after this tape we will go into the baptism i want to play what time is it now anybody have a time it says one o'clock 11 25 good this we we should be be baptizing by noon by the grace of god i want to play 30 minutes of discernment discerning of spirits but in this i want you to feel what it is that brother abraham is saying true discernment is true discernment is when a man looks at the situations he looks at the things around them and he discerns them in relationship to what his vision is in other words if something is going to take me away from what it is that i'm called to do i need to discern that all things are profitable but all things aren't edifying so and as he expresses this he's an express an attitude and a life and the thought process that the mind of christ has and how that one with the mind of christ looks at the world discerns the world and treats those that are around him and and i don't know maybe i'll play the rest of it tonight maybe not i don't know yet but let's listen to this i hope it's a blessing to you he's going to start by reading out of the psalm it's some i believe it's 105. yes it's psalm 105 and and he says so anyway and then we'll just read there so we'll start he says i wish to read this morning and then we'll listen to this little portion of this sermon this morning and remember we're talking about the importance of each of us to have discernment have an understanding of what our life is about what our vision is and how that we need to have discernment i hope it's a blessing to you i hope that the lord understands that our goal is to let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus that every man look on the needs of others above himself amen god bless you just 35 minutes i believe or 30 minutes god bless you this morning i wish to read this morning [Music] a portion of scripture found in the psalms the uh hundred and fifth psalm i wish to read just a potion you that keeps down these scripture readings i see many of them and we're ministers and so forth it's good to read the word and now what time do they usually leave by 12 o'clock why say thank you psalms 105 oh give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make knowing his deeds among the people saying unto him saying psalms unto him talky of all his wondrous works glory in his holy name let the hearts of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face evermore remember his marvelous works that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth o ye seed of abraham his servants ye children of jacob is chosen he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth he has remembered his covenant forever the words which he commanded to a thousand generations which covet he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for our law and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few man in number yay very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sake saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm may the lord bless the reading of his words i have a few scriptures written out here somewhere that i was going to refer to perhaps along the road i wonder today who's going to be the next president the election is coming up you know who's going to be president this next term what if i knew there's only one that does know and that's god and what if god would reveal to me who's going to be the next president and i stood here in phoenix and made a prediction that such and such a man would be the next president of the united states and they would place that in papers and so forth and i would hit it right on the dot it would be perfect and it would be all that i had said would come to pass but what good would it do what good is it anyhow if i if i should do such a thing the papers would advertise it and it would go out maybe if such a person could make such a prediction and it would be true all the newspapers and magazines would would pass on it but you know that god doesn't do things like that god doesn't use his power and his gifts for foolishness it's going to be whatever is president it will be president and to know now which would be president wouldn't help us one penny it wouldn't do us one bit of good to know who's going to be president so therefore god doesn't do those things like that and then if i made such a prediction as that and it come to pass and the newspapers packed it and the magazines then it would be to my glory people would say look what a great prophet brother branham is he told us long before it happened just who would be president and that would be to my glory but god doesn't want he's not interested in working things to my glory or to to any other man's glory he's interested to work things to his glory something that will profit like paul said if we speak with tongues and do not have an interpreter what good does it do we only glorify ourselves and that's uh edify ourselves that's uh kind of out of the line for god god wants to be edified himself and we're to not seek self edification but to edify god with all we do so therefore i believe this morning if i knew who he would be and exactly when he would be elected and all how many votes he'd be over under or whatever it might be it wouldn't do one bit of good to tell it it'd be best for me just to keep it still if i did know it not try to publish it because there would be there would be no reason for me to do it because it's going to be anyhow and it doesn't make us that much difference uh who's going to be president but god when he uses his gifts he uses them for his own glory and for the glory of his people for the glory of his church for the edifying of the body of christ and for the glory of the kingdom of god that's why he gives these things in his church yes teachers prophets evangelists pastors they are for the edification of the church and for the glory of god the prophet is not to get out and mingle with the world and try to take a gift like balaam did and make havoc or our money out of it or something if he's a prophet he's supposed to reveal god to the church and stay out of the things of the world it's all for the glory of god now we do have and i think it's a good thing for us as ministers to follow our order when we see such things in the world as we see today and we have an order from god is for the discerning of spirits trying the spirit i believe that that is a very great lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything have discernment of the spirit i do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by the denomination they belong to are by the group that they are assembled with whether they be methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostal or whatever they are we should never judge the man by the denomination that he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has see the spirit whether he's a a latter rain or farmer rain or inner outer rain or no rain or whatever it might be we should never judge him by that but by his spirit we are to discern spirits watch what the man has in mind what he has what he's trying to achieve if the man by a gift no matter how great the gift is now i want to get this to the church this morning which into the different denominations you are still the church of the living god together and this is the thing i want to get to you see that we are really not divided we are the stones that's cut in different forms all to the glory of god now there is so much in the day that we live in pertaining to gifts so many people judge people by gifts that they have well i believe that these things are gifts i believe that what we see take place is gifts and they're god-given gifts but we if we do not use them in the right way that god intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have the gifts other night i made a statement at the pulpit saying this that i would rather see brotherly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else we must know what these things are for now if a man comes and he has a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination don't judge him by what denomination he come from how he dresses but what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it i'd have discernment of spirit enough to know that's wrong no matter how great her teacher he is how powerful he is how intellectual he is or how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of christ your own spiritual discernment would tell you that that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of jesus christ to achieve something maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with a great intellectual or a spiritual power that he could draw people together and maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so he'll have a big name so that other brethren will look up to him as some big person then that's wrong amen maybe he's trying to to edify a certain thing here that he wants everybody else to get out of the picture and let him and his group be the picture that's still wrong but if he has a gift of god and he's trying to edify the body of christ then i don't care what he belongs to you're not discerning the man you're discerning the spirit the life that's in the man and that's what god told us to do not one time was we ever commissioned to discern that uh the man's group but we was uh constrained and commanded by god to discern the spirit in the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to and then if we can find out that he's trying to lead the people not to break them up but to bring them together and to bring the church of the living god not all to one denomination but to an understanding of fellowship a unity of spirit then if he is former rain or lateran or whatever it is his spirit and his purpose is right and the spirit that's in him no matter what move he belongs to the spirit that's in him is trying to part the people to calvary away from himself or away from anything else but his only achievement he has is to point them to calvary he doesn't care whether he's even knowed or not he doesn't care whether he's even his own movement which is fine see it's good if he is a methodist or a presbyterian or a roman catholic or whatever he wants to be by denomination but what is he trying to do the purpose of his heart that he's trying to get then you can see what's in the man's life whether his motives as far as his denomination whether it's for his self whether it's for worldly fame whether it's for big names to say i predicted that come just exactly to pass now i see that's wrong right there to begin with but if he's trying to use what god's given as a teacher as a prophet as a seer a new testament prophet is a preacher we all know that just any minister that's a preacher is a prophet a new testament prophet if he's prophesying preaching not to try to edify himself to make a big name or to edify his organization which he should be in an organization here i am without one but yet preaching you should be that's right every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithes and somewhere that you help support the cause take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group see discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you've got fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of christ i think that is absolutely true now if we will notice the motives and objectives of the old testament prophets damn man had one objective that was jesus christ they had one thing that their whole theme of the old testament was built around the coming messiah they they did not go out and do things just for money or for fame they had one thing they were anointed with the spirit of god and they predicted the coming messiah and those men were so anointed with the spirit until they sometimes acted like the spirit that was within them they spoke seemingly of themselves watch how the spirit of god made that man act we'll take for instance moses the great prophet how that that man had no selfish objectives at all he could have been the king of egypt he could have had the world under his feet but because that he was a prophet at heart he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the persecution and the trials of christ esteeming the treasures of heaven greater treasures than them of egypt he forsook and denied himself of the worldly thing of the luxury and the the things that life offers he had to look beyond that see he could have been that just take the minister today if he has the baptism of the holy spirit and he knows that if he preaches that word it's going to cut his fame down it's going to put him in a little bitty church somewhere or maybe out on the street but he knows that something in his heart is burning he sees the coming of the lord he doesn't care whether that he has a big church our little church he doesn't care whether he has uh today's food or not no food he doesn't care whether he has good clothes or doesn't have good clothes he's only mindful of one thing and that's the very life within him crying out he's trying to achieve something for the glory of god and that man in doing so will act the very life of the spirit that's in him do you follow me he'll act it out look at moses when he come to a time that he displayed all his life was the spirit of christ for christ was in him christ was in moses by measure now if we notice he was born in the time of persecution the children was killed to try to get him just exactly like they did uh jesus and we find out that when it come to a place that the children of israel had disobeyed in such a way until god was angry with them and he said to moses step aside and i'll destroy the whole group of them and i'll take of you and raise up another generation moses chew himself in the path of god's judgment and said take me before you take them in other words before you can get them you'll have to come over me that's exactly what jesus christ did when god would have wiped the whole face of the earth off with these sinners you and i but christ threw yourself in the path god could not do it he couldn't come over his own son and when god seen that spirit in moses hanging in the judgment like a cross there you can't come to him you'll have to take me first see the spirit of god in moses when he could have been king of egypt when he could have had every luxury in the world to be popular when he could have been the great king of the world at that time but he chose to suffer the persecutions and the affliction for he has steamed the reproach of christ greater treasures and that of egypt you see he threw his self in a way why it was god in moses did that the normal thinking intellectual man would never do that he would take the easy road so no matter how much a fanatic moses seemed to be he was trying you see he was a true prophet of god because he was trying to achieve something for the kingdom of god now with his great gift of prophecy he might have been a wise man could have stood up in egypt and said now wait i'll prophesy so and so i'll say so and so and as with his prophecy but in in all he had been world famous but that wasn't in his heart it couldn't be in his heart so if you see a person with a great gift trying to do something to glorify themselves your own discernment of the spirit tells you that's wrong moses was trying to achieve something for the glory of god no matter how bad it was how evil it looked how much it was talked about the spirit in moses directed him straight to the line of duty the spirit in him look at joseph joseph was when he was born he was loved of the father and hated by his brethren perfect type of christ and the only he was a blood brother to them the same father but the reason his brethren hated him was about a cause because god had made him a prophet spiritual a seer and they hated him for that very purpose but joseph could not help it because god had made him that way and what's the spirit of god in joseph watch what he did he even acted the part of christ he was hated of his brethren loved of his father because of the spirit made the difference he was a spiritual man he saw visions he interpreted dreams he did not do it for his own glory he did it because there was something in him the spirit of god he wouldn't have went out there by his own self and have been thrown into a ditch and have his poor old father to grieve all those years sold for nearly 30 pieces of silver taken up from the ditch and became the right-hand man of pharaoh the king of earth at that time and in his prison house there was a butler and a baker and one was lost and the other was saved by his prediction in the prison house and did you notice jesus when he came he was loved of the father and the father gave joseph a coat of many colors the rainbow a covenant and the father god gave his son jesus the covenant and then the jewish brother hated him without a cause he had no reason to hate him he was spiritual and he was god's word made manifest he come to do the will of the father he come to fulfill the scriptures he came to bring them peace but they misunderstood him and hated him without a cause they didn't stop to try to see what he was trying to achieve they just judged him because he didn't agree with them they may he makes himself so and so he makes himself god he was god god was in him the bible said god was in christ manifesting himself to the world he was the god of glory manifesting the glory of god amen look at moses he couldn't help throwing himself there he didn't do that hypocritically he did it because god was in him neither could joseph help being what he was because it was god in him working or displaying himself through the man never did he do it for self glory any man that if those priests would only have the discernment of spirit as i'm speaking to you this morning regardless of how much the world talked about him they still would have known amen if they'd look to the word if they were seeing his purpose he was always doing that to glorify the father he said they said oh this man's a great healer he does these things like that he said i can do nothing till the father shows me it is not me that doeth the works it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the words he never took the glory neither would any servant of god take glory neither would any servant or god take a gift of god and try to glorify himself or anything else but his right achievement is to do something to the glory of god that's ways see the same thing today we must have discernment of spirit to see a person what they're trying to do are they trying to glorify god are they trying to glorify themselves now the spirit of god working in man makes man act like god no wonder jesus said is not it written ye are gods and if they call them gods to whom the spirit of god came to how can you condemn me that when i am the son of god if you could see the spirit of god in moses which he was god moses was a god joseph was a god the prophets were gods the bible said they were yes they were gods because they had completely surrendered themselves to the spirit of god that they were working for the glory of god and when a man is so anointed with the spirit i let this go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side when a man is anointed of the spirit of god his habits his actions and everything is god moving in him sometimes he's misjudged look at david in the 23rd psalm he cried my god my god why has thou forsaken me as if he was if david was the man all they that passed me by shoot their lip out at me he was so anointed with god he was so perfectly surrendered to god and the anointing was on him in such a way and when he cried by the spirit of god if somebody been standing there saying well look he thinks somebody shoot their lip out at him why has god forsaken him it wasn't david it was a spirit crying out through david amen my god my god why has i forsaken me my bones all stare at me they have pierced my hands and my feet well somebody said listen that hypocrite up there whose hands is pierced whose feet is pierced that's the intellectual but one who had discernment of spirit knew that that was the spirit of god in him crying out when a man is anointed of the spirit of god he's got the action of god and the action of god is never to break us up the action of god is to draw us together for we are one in christ jesus and god's purpose is to bring us together love one another that'll make you want to go back and finish on it but don't miss the underlying thing that he was saying look at when you discern look at what it's achieving look at your own actions what is it achieving is it achieving for christ does it glorify god is it for the purpose that that and you notice he emphasized this how important it is to discern that's why he says if a man's trying to do something that's good for the kingdom of god and you discern he's got the spirit of christ praise god you have fellowship in that and so we'll just leave it there this morning but i think you could get a lot from that this morning a lot about the attitude a lot about how you approach things how you look at things how important it is to discern things a man so if kaley if you're ready and and i guess nikki you'll go help her and jonathan you'll come and and help me and we'll turn the service back over to brother ability to clean this stand together as we're gonna go pray to get ready for the baptism we'd also like to greet everybody who's out on line watching and and and uh just greet you and and hope that uh the dale comes soon that uh we can have you back in our midst i i trust that everybody will come back we won't know that i guess for another month or two i get a lot of questions about the vaccine whether or not i would take the vaccine i probably would take the vaccine i'm not afraid of it if it kills me praise god as one sister told me well i'm going to see how many people it kills before i take it you know we take up a deadly thing you know it will not harm us somebody said well they're going to inject a chip in you so they can keep track of you well if you're afraid of that throw your cell phone away because they know where you are i went mcdonald's the other day by the time i got back in my truck there's a little sign said how did you enjoy mcdonald's i said how did you know i was at mcdonald's so you know we've got to go on serving god we've got to go on shedding the love of god abroad in our heart we've got to go on letting the world know like prophet of god said they're pointing to calvary if their spirit's right well let us have the right spirit let us have the right motive and objective let us have the reflect if the spirit of god is in a man he'll act out the word of god a word lived by the life lived by the word is an expression of the word let's don't forget that this morning this power heads and maybe this morning [Music] you would ask the lord say father i'd like more discernment lord i like the understanding and the purpose of discernment that i can make the right choices for the glory of god and you'd like to raise your hand and say father i'd like to be in a greater fellowship with you have that spirit working in me having strong meat discerning between good and evil [Music] father being able to discern spiritual things and just have a more abundant life in christ jesus and if that's your heart's desire this morning just invite him closer to your life [Music] maybe he'd like to make a vow to him this morning [Music] and you just might ask him father i'd like to read my bible more i'm asking that you would help me lord i'd like to pray more i'm asking that you'd help me like to have a better attitude a better nature a better spirit i would like christ and the love of god to be shed abroad from my heart that my good works might glorify my father which is in heaven i don't want to miss the purpose of christianity you'd like to raise your hand to him this morning and say father granted i pray in the wonderful and beautiful name of jesus amen amen god bless you if you have to go this morning uh to feel free to to go if you have to go to work or you have to be somewhere if you'd like to stay for the baptism feel free to stay god bless you lord peace lord be with you thank you i am right [Music] sir [Music] oh [Music] lord will consecrate me now

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh how i love jesus how i love jesus love me praise the lord amen it's so nice to be here you know to come into this water you have to really want to be baptized amen but we're grateful sister kaylee's going to get gave her heart to the lord and she wants to serve god and you know you don't start out perfect you know what i mean you start to run the race that's set before you and you make decisions and you you uh you add things to your life you take things out of your life you're tempted you're tried you're tested but with his help you overcome all things and that's why the gift of giving your life to christ and being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ is that you shall receive the holy spirit and that's the spirit that leads you and guides you into all truth and righteousness so that's what you do you just give yourself to him you bury yourself in water baptism and then when you come up he sends his spirit to help you make the journey aren't you glad for that i certainly don't want to try to do it myself amen do you want to say anything with this she doesn't want to say anything i don't blame you amen so let us turn in our bibles to the second chapter of acts we know the setting the disciples had just come out of the upper room the sound of a mighty rushing wind and the the glory of god poured out on them that attracted the people and they came out of the upper room and and the the people thought they were drunk and peter went to preaching and the disciples went to preaching and and everybody heard them in their own tongue and then after the conclusion their hearts are pricked and this is where we pick up the story and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the
