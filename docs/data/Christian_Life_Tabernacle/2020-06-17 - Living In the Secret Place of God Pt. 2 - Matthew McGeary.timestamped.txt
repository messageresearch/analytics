[35:54] Lord I believe that's each one of our
[35:57] hearts cry tonight Lord is that we could
[35:59] be hid away in you Lord we see you the
[36:04] world is in such chaos and despair the
[36:11] Lord were so privileged to know you in
[36:13] the power of your resurrection to know
[36:16] Lord that you've prepared a place for
[36:18] your bride that we can come and we can
[36:20] rest Lord now we can enter in behind the
[36:23] veil Lord and there the enemy cannot get
[36:25] to us or then that's our hearts cry
[36:28] tonight Lord is with you just take us in
[36:30] behind available father forgive us of
[36:34] our sins Lord forgive us for our
[36:37] iniquities Lord forgive us for the lust
[36:40] of the eye and the pride of life and the
[36:42] lust of the flesh law
[36:43] where we get our eyes back on you we get
[36:46] our eyes on Calvary Lord Lord we believe
[36:50] that the time is closer than it's ever
[36:52] been or do we want to be in our
[36:54] positions we want to be doing and saying
[36:58] the right things order to live in a life
[36:59] that's pleasing to you Lord we believe
[37:02] it's moments like this that you've
[37:04] ordained that we would come as simple
[37:06] ourselves together and we could sing
[37:09] some songs of praise and or they'd be
[37:12] pleasing to you and you just pass by our
[37:14] way Lord administer to our hearts for
[37:16] father we ask that you'd come and break
[37:18] the bread of life now as only as you can
[37:20] we commit every one to you we surrender
[37:23] ourselves to thy presence the Holy
[37:25] Spirit we pray the name of Jesus Christ
[37:27] to be back hallelujah man praise the
[37:32] Lord
[37:33] we'll be reading out of Psalms 27
[37:56] Psalms 27 we we just want to continue on
[37:59] a thought of living in the secret place
[38:01] of God living in the secret place of God
[38:05] but as a as a subject we want to just
[38:10] speak on a hidden life just reading in
[38:13] Psalms 27 for says one thing have I
[38:18] desired of the Lord that will I seek
[38:21] after that I may dwell in the house of
[38:23] the Lord all the days of my life to
[38:26] behold the beauty of the Lord and
[38:27] enquire and his temple for in the time
[38:30] of trouble he shall hide me in his
[38:32] pavilion and the secret of his
[38:34] Tabernacle shall you hide me he shall
[38:37] set me up upon a rock and also we just
[38:41] want to read out of Hebrews 10 me
[38:44] reading verse 19 through 23 Hebrews
[39:00] 10:19 through 23 says
[39:09] having therefore brethren boldness to
[39:12] enter and to the holiest by the blood of
[39:16] Jesus I mean this is actually the text
[39:20] brother branham takes to preach this
[39:22] sermon a hidden life in 1955 in October
[39:27] by a new and living way which he hath
[39:30] consecrated for us through the veil that
[39:32] is to say his flesh and having an High
[39:35] Priest over the house of God let us draw
[39:37] near or the true heart in full assurance
[39:39] of faith having our hearts sprinkled
[39:41] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[39:43] washed with pure water let us hold fast
[39:46] the profession of our faith without
[39:47] wavering for he is faithful that
[39:50] promised a man you may be seated a man
[39:56] just in speaking on living in the secret
[40:00] place of God or living at living in a
[40:03] hidden life and Jesus Christ I believe
[40:05] there's there's a deep hunger in the
[40:07] bride of Jesus Christ and a craving
[40:10] that's in you as the scripture says seek
[40:12] ye first the kingdom of God in His
[40:15] righteousness that word seek is a
[40:17] craving and last time we spoke we
[40:20] ministered on this and we were just
[40:23] drawing from spiritual food and due
[40:25] season where the Prophet talks about how
[40:27] dear in the time of drought and during
[40:29] the time of famine that God had a
[40:30] special prepared place for Elijah to go
[40:33] there he was able to go that God had
[40:36] ordained a place that he could go during
[40:38] the time of the famine and it was a it
[40:40] was a provided place that Elijah had
[40:43] entered in it was a secret place that
[40:45] that God had provided no one knew about
[40:47] it and the Prophet said that that's a
[40:49] perfect type of the day that we're
[40:51] living in that God has prepared a secret
[40:54] place for the bride to enter in and he
[40:57] said the way that Elijah entered into
[41:00] this was by the plan of God by the call
[41:02] of God and by the word of God and that's
[41:05] how we enter into that secret place in
[41:07] Christ and he said and that is he says
[41:10] he references all the scriptures
[41:13] pertaining to this day Malachi 4 Luke 17
[41:16] 13 says John 14:12 and Joel 2:28 he says
[41:20] all these scriptures that point
[41:22] last day he says and that is Christ if
[41:25] you can hide away in that now in that
[41:28] secret place you can eat and see the
[41:30] goodness and mercy of God and we know
[41:32] what he says that's in Christ Christ is
[41:35] an anointing so if you can hide away in
[41:38] Christ in that secret place that Christ
[41:41] is anointing that's the Shekinah of
[41:42] glory that's the Holy Ghost that that's
[41:45] where the power comes forth and that's
[41:47] where the Holy Ghost and the gospel
[41:49] comes forth and power and demonstration
[41:51] is when you can enter in behind the veil
[41:53] where the you're living in the Shekinah
[41:55] glory and in his presence and that's
[41:58] what we're wanting to speak on is it is
[42:00] is moving into that place and as I
[42:03] thought about that I was thinking about
[42:05] how David you know David was anointed to
[42:08] be king he was elected and he was chosen
[42:11] to be king and the scripture says that
[42:14] when Samuel anointed him to be king the
[42:16] Spirit of the Lord came upon him and
[42:18] it's so as our postures been pointed out
[42:21] that what David being anointed in the
[42:23] spirit Lord came upon him it wasn't that
[42:26] he would have power when he came into
[42:27] the throne but no David when he was
[42:30] anointed that power came unto David then
[42:32] and David had access to that power and
[42:35] maybe I should say it like this look
[42:37] that I Justin fellowship with our pastor
[42:39] not necessarily that we have access to
[42:41] the power like it's something somewhere
[42:43] else but we possess the power that's why
[42:46] David could come out there and stand in
[42:48] front of Goliath Goliath had no chance
[42:50] because David had been anointed he had
[42:53] been elected and he had been chosen to
[42:55] take the throne so nothing was going to
[42:57] get in his way or stop him from moving
[42:59] to an into his position and that's the
[43:01] same thing with the bride of Jesus
[43:03] Christ we have been elected we have been
[43:05] chosen he's given us a spirit and
[43:07] there's nothing that's going to stop you
[43:09] from coming into that position in Jesus
[43:11] Christ we just want to read this quote
[43:21] here out of a hidden life it says has
[43:23] Christ meant more to you than all the
[43:26] world I don't mean from an emotional or
[43:29] mental workup I mean from the depths of
[43:32] your heart that something settled in
[43:34] there
[43:35] and something's taken place that you
[43:38] don't know how it come but you're hit
[43:40] away and your whole motive is to serve
[43:43] Jesus Christ have you entered into that
[43:46] place my dear brother that's a sincere
[43:49] question tonight have you entered into
[43:52] that place
[43:53] my dear brother it's okay if you have it
[43:57] it's an invitation
[44:00] it's an invitation you don't have to to
[44:04] work it up and make an intellectual
[44:06] conception you know you know if you're
[44:09] living and overcoming life you know if
[44:12] the Spirit of God is present moving and
[44:15] working through you just let God deal
[44:18] with your heart respond to the
[44:20] invitation have you come into that place
[44:23] where you don't care what anyone says
[44:25] not to go out and get smart but till the
[44:28] love of God is so anchored into you that
[44:31] you can't see nothing else your whole
[44:34] motive is to do the will of God love for
[44:38] everybody
[44:38] flowing free from everywhere what a
[44:42] place to live that's the hidden place
[44:45] that's the place where we go we got to
[44:49] come to my brethren that's the place
[44:52] where God reveals his secret things
[44:55] that's the place where God does the
[44:57] placing and the calling Oh David said in
[45:01] the secret of us Tabernacle in that
[45:04] hidden place look when you're in there
[45:06] that affects all of your decisions that
[45:09] affects your your-your-your risings and
[45:11] your goings and your comings that that
[45:13] is something that has full sway over
[45:15] your body it's controlling your thoughts
[45:16] thinking on these things whatsoever
[45:19] things are pure whatsoever things are
[45:20] lovely think on these things we want to
[45:22] be we want to come into a place where
[45:24] the Holy Spirit has such a reign in our
[45:27] lives that it's it's influencing our
[45:29] very thoughts because the way we go
[45:32] through this allow do you see an age oh
[45:34] we're so bombarded with so many things
[45:36] but we want to have that same mind of
[45:39] Christ that we do nothing but what the
[45:41] father shows us that we're only thinking
[45:43] upon the things that are true only
[45:45] thinking upon the things of his word
[45:49] that's the place where God speaks back
[45:52] that's the place where that seed faith
[45:55] that our pastor has been talking about I
[45:57] want to say that's the place where that
[45:59] seed faith blossoms but the random said
[46:02] that mustard seed faith will perform a
[46:04] miracle but he said just hold on to it
[46:07] he said you just hold on to that faith
[46:10] that God has given you just like Abraham
[46:12] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[46:15] God and he held on to that faith that he
[46:18] had and when it when it seemed like the
[46:21] situation got more impossible the
[46:25] scripture says all his faith got strong
[46:27] or giving praise unto God and I want to
[46:30] say to my brothers and sisters oh yes it
[46:33] seems we've been going a long time it
[46:35] seems like the rapture should have
[46:37] already taken place seems like we should
[46:39] have already went into a body change and
[46:41] now we're seeing a veterans and men of
[46:43] God who have packed this gospel and had
[46:46] preached it without wavering believing
[46:48] that that they would they would step
[46:49] into that new body now we're seeing some
[46:51] of them I'll be planted in the ground
[46:53] like a time capsule until that great a
[46:56] resurrection day and and oh it just
[46:58] seems that time just moves on a little
[47:00] bit more and a little bit more but oh we
[47:02] want to enter in and go further than
[47:04] just the seed faith we're going beyond
[47:07] that as our pastor has been talking
[47:08] about we want to enter in and behind the
[47:10] veil we want to go into the holiest of
[47:13] Holies and my just what did the prophet
[47:16] say how do we enter in there by his plan
[47:18] by his call and by his word and by just
[47:21] look at this picture here what a
[47:24] beautiful picture we have in type of God
[47:26] leading his people by a pillar of fire
[47:29] by the word of his prophet just look at
[47:33] the order of the camp set out there
[47:35] around the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[47:37] there God bringing his people out of
[47:39] bondage leading them by a pillar of fire
[47:45] standing there with a vindicated prophet
[47:48] in that in that a sight to behold I was
[47:52] just looking at that and I certainly
[47:55] would have been like rehab be like yeah
[47:58] I've heard I've heard about y'all
[48:01] and we are shaken we are terrified I
[48:05] mean some of our guys went outside the
[48:06] city and we saw that you know what what
[48:11] an amazing display of the order of God
[48:14] in his ways there look at such order
[48:17] such power out there in the middle of
[48:19] the wilderness
[48:24] such a beautiful type when we look at
[48:29] that
[48:33] there's types and shadows we want to
[48:36] draw from just as we move for this
[48:38] message of a hidden life my it's just so
[48:41] packed the Prophet says now God has made
[48:45] it so wonderful that in the Old
[48:46] Testament were usually I go to for a
[48:49] refuge for a text once in a while he's
[48:51] made the Old Testament in parables and
[48:53] in symbolic forms to express himself in
[48:55] his doings that the simple-minded might
[48:59] be able to have a conception of his will
[49:02] and what he has done
[49:04] praise the Lord and I just pray that
[49:07] even in going through this that it would
[49:10] encourage you because sometimes the Old
[49:13] Testament in certain places can be maybe
[49:18] a little overwhelming or just a lot of
[49:20] information but I really want to
[49:22] encourage you to to really dig into that
[49:24] and take heed of what the prophets
[49:26] saying because he's saying he made the
[49:29] Old Testament in parables and in
[49:31] symbolic form to express himself and is
[49:34] doing that the simple-minded might be
[49:36] able to have a conception I was will and
[49:39] what he's done so we can look back in
[49:41] the Old Testament and get a greater
[49:43] understanding of the ways of God he says
[49:45] many times in the Old Testament how I
[49:47] went back to find the old typing the new
[49:50] always God did and what he's doing now
[49:53] in the New Testament he foreshadowed it
[49:55] in the Old Testament now for instance in
[49:59] the Old Testament how God gave all of
[50:02] his parable back there and set forth his
[50:04] things that would be a shadow of today
[50:06] then that's the only way that I can
[50:08] teach the Bible they talk about big
[50:11] Greek words and so forth they just tie
[50:12] me in all kind of play
[50:14] but if I look back and see what God did
[50:16] back there as a foreshadow then I have
[50:19] some general conception of what he's
[50:21] doing today because that was a shadow if
[50:24] I'm going west and the sun's rising in
[50:26] the east and my shadow is before me and
[50:28] I've never seen myself or never knowed
[50:30] what I look like or a human being I'd
[50:32] have some conception of my form when I
[50:35] seen my shadow now if you can pull from
[50:39] that and maybe look in there you can
[50:44] look into the Bible and see a little of
[50:47] yourself you can look into the Old
[50:50] Testament and you can look into a New
[50:51] Testament and you can see maybe what was
[50:53] of a shadow now coming into
[50:55] manifestation and the Old Testament is a
[50:58] shadow of the coming of Christ and
[51:00] everything foreshadowed the cross and in
[51:03] Christ all God's Redemption all of his
[51:06] plans all of the plan of salvation all
[51:10] was met at Calvary and just looking at
[51:17] the pattern of the tabernacle we could
[51:20] see many types and symbols and just to
[51:23] reference back to what we just read he
[51:25] says and the Old Testament is the shadow
[51:28] of the coming of Christ and everything
[51:31] foreshadowed the cross so when we look
[51:33] at the pattern of the tabernacle and the
[51:35] wilderness might there's so many things
[51:38] that can be drawled from the order and
[51:40] the way that this was set up that
[51:43] brother Branham he would always say
[51:44] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[51:46] and forever and he said if you don't see
[51:48] Jesus Christ in every line go back and
[51:51] read it again now as we look at this
[51:53] pattern of the tabernacle we should be
[51:56] able to see Jesus Christ in the pattern
[51:58] of his house and in the tabernacle and
[52:00] in the outer courts and in the inner
[52:02] courts and in the holiest of all ways we
[52:04] can actually see the whole plan of
[52:05] redemption we can actually see it what
[52:07] God was forecasting his very heart's
[52:09] desire was laying in that pattern there
[52:12] in the tabernacle a prophet says in
[52:18] things that are to be he says now we
[52:21] know that Moses in building the
[52:23] Tabernacle in the wilderness or
[52:24] preparing it he said he made all
[52:27] after the order of what he saw in heaven
[52:30] see
[52:31] so the earthly flings only express what
[52:34] the eternal things are so when you look
[52:37] at the pattern of the tabernacle you're
[52:39] not looking at necessarily a something
[52:41] temporal though that was done away with
[52:43] but it was in type or or in a pattern of
[52:47] something that he saw in heaven
[52:49] something that was eternal and so when
[52:51] we look at the natural it's giving us a
[52:55] foresight or something that we know is
[52:57] eternal in the heavens
[52:58] and so as we as we go through here if if
[53:03] that was a pattern we can look at the
[53:06] Old Testament to better understand the
[53:09] New Testament so the earthly things only
[53:12] express what the eternal things are and
[53:14] if this earth that we live in today
[53:16] being so great as we love it and love to
[53:20] live and breathe the air and see the
[53:21] flowers and things if this here is the
[53:24] expression one that's dying is only
[53:27] expressing one that's eternal when you
[53:29] see a tree struggling pulling trying to
[53:31] live that means there's a tree somewhere
[53:33] that doesn't have to do it the earthly
[53:36] Tabernacle is only expressing the
[53:39] eternal and that's what we're going back
[53:41] to he's taking us back to Eden and as
[53:45] you as you start to study and look
[53:47] through the order of the Tabernacle you
[53:49] can actually see how God even in that
[53:52] pattern is taking us back to Eden back
[53:55] to the Tree of Life and in study in the
[53:57] tabernacle we can actually understand
[54:00] the pattern in the plan of God more than
[54:02] ever before because the seals are open
[54:07] so what is the purpose of the tabernacle
[54:15] in Exodus 20:5 it says and let them make
[54:21] me a sanctuary that I may dwell among
[54:24] them now you're seeing God's heart's
[54:27] desire of what his purpose was and he
[54:31] says in verse 22 and there I will meet
[54:37] with thee and I will commune with thee
[54:38] from above the mercy seat from between
[54:41] the
[54:41] cherubims which are upon the ark of the
[54:43] testimony of all things which I give
[54:45] thee a commandment under the children of
[54:48] Israel so if you just start to look at
[54:53] it you know David was a man after God's
[54:55] own heart when Israel was wanting a king
[54:58] and and Saul had transgressed the word
[55:02] of the Lord what did God tell Sam he
[55:04] said look don't look on the outside man
[55:05] looks on the outside but God looks at
[55:08] the heart and the scripture says that
[55:09] that God desired desired one after his
[55:13] heart we know that David was a man after
[55:16] God's own heart and as I thought about
[55:18] that you know if anybody knew how to
[55:20] praise and worship God it was David
[55:23] David knew how to praise and worship the
[55:25] Lord and God was seeking a man after his
[55:28] own heart and we know the scripture says
[55:29] that they've got God as a spirit and
[55:31] they that worship Him worship Him in
[55:34] spirit and in truth and as we looked at
[55:38] our text there in Psalms 27 David there
[55:42] is reflecting the very desire of God
[55:45] that he's wanting to dwell in the house
[55:49] of the Lord he's all of the days of his
[55:51] life he he wanted to be in that secret
[55:53] place he's he's here expressing God's
[55:57] very heart purpose in the reason why he
[55:59] even designed and and and built the
[56:02] tabernacle because the scripture says he
[56:05] wanted them to make a sanctuary that he
[56:06] could dwell amongst his people that he
[56:08] could have communion with them David
[56:12] just didn't want to enter into part of
[56:14] it but David wanted to go all the way
[56:15] into that secret place that's where the
[56:18] Ark of the Covenant is if you just you
[56:21] just look at that there and and kind of
[56:23] you have that as you come into that east
[56:25] gate there on the bottom right and you
[56:27] move into the outer courts there you see
[56:30] the altar you go a little further and
[56:33] there's the ladder where the priests
[56:34] would wash and then you have to go in
[56:36] through the first veil and through that
[56:38] first veil you come into the holy place
[56:39] and there you see the the lampstand and
[56:43] the table of showbread
[56:44] you see the altar of incense right
[56:48] before the veil but David wanted to go
[56:50] through that second veil he wanted to go
[56:53] in there into that Shekinah
[56:55] Laurey
[57:14] just going back to that picture of
[57:17] looking at that Tabernacle and thinking
[57:20] about the Shekinah glory and the
[57:21] presence of the Lord
[57:23] imagine what it would have been like to
[57:25] be there where God was veiling himself
[57:28] behind badger skins talk about a
[57:30] peculiar people look at the order look
[57:34] at the leadership
[57:36] I'd love to been there I would love to
[57:39] seen that what a reverence I think it
[57:43] would have would have maybe brought from
[57:45] our hearts
[57:47] thinking that you could actually go down
[57:50] to that place and you could actually
[57:53] enter into a building there and know
[57:56] that God was veiling himself behind
[57:59] badger skins what kind of reverence
[58:01] would you have for that think of what
[58:04] would happen if maybe we could take a
[58:06] journey right now down through that
[58:08] aisle and we could come down there and
[58:10] there was the east gate and we had our
[58:12] sacrifice and now we could just enter in
[58:15] through that east gate there and there
[58:17] the priest would be there to receive the
[58:19] sacrifice and there would be that the
[58:21] brass altar there and to know that just
[58:26] behind the veil there was that one that
[58:29] was up there on Mount Sinai there was
[58:31] the one that framed the world there was
[58:33] the creator of heavens were not not that
[58:35] far away oh my what a reverence what
[58:38] would oh what a humility would that
[58:40] would that cost within you but know ye
[58:48] not that ye are the temple of God and
[58:52] that the Spirit of God dwell in you well
[58:58] it's so easy to maybe in the natural put
[59:01] so much reverence on something we can
[59:03] see touch taste hear feel smell and all
[59:08] would be so easy to maybe worship and be
[59:10] so easy to enter in but yet what is the
[59:14] Lord telling us know ye not this is 1st
[59:17] Corinthians 3:16 he says know ye not
[59:19] that ye are the temple of God and that
[59:22] the Spirit
[59:23] of God dwelleth in you If any man defile
[59:27] the temple of God him shall God destroy
[59:30] for the temple of God is holy which
[59:32] temple ye are look this illustration
[59:35] brings a great sobriety just being able
[59:38] to look at it and think of what God has
[59:40] entrusted you with a sacred trust ye are
[59:44] the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[59:46] you are the dwelling place of God and I
[59:51] think we take it for granted I think we
[59:54] fail to to really realize and reverence
[59:57] the calling and the position and the
[1:00:00] place that God has given to his bride
[1:00:03] because all as God was dealing with my
[1:00:06] heart I I sitting on I look at this but
[1:00:11] then as you look into Hebrews I believe
[1:00:12] it is as Paul starts to Mohnish he goes
[1:00:15] if if those things were glorious if the
[1:00:19] things that were temporal we're glorious
[1:00:22] and we're going to be done away with
[1:00:24] how much more glory are those things
[1:00:27] which are eternal how much more glorious
[1:00:31] are these things that that God desired
[1:00:34] to integrin Akal himself in your skin oh
[1:00:37] and this is a tabernacle that he's not
[1:00:40] gonna do away with but this is a
[1:00:42] communion and a fellowship this is
[1:00:44] something that's this is his desire that
[1:00:46] he's had in his heart all along and now
[1:00:51] we just look in the wilderness and we
[1:00:52] see maybe a type-o we see a little bit
[1:00:55] of a shadow and we think of how how just
[1:00:58] maybe all struck it would been had been
[1:01:00] to be in that order but to think as Paul
[1:01:03] is admonishing us here see know ye not
[1:01:05] that ye are the temple of God look when
[1:01:10] Moses came into the presence of the
[1:01:12] burning bush Moses take off your shoes
[1:01:15] for your unholy ground
[1:01:17] Joshua one time in the heat of the
[1:01:19] battle it came against the captain of
[1:01:21] the the armies of the Lord and and and
[1:01:24] already four surfer against us I'm the
[1:01:26] captain of the host of the armies the
[1:01:27] Lord take off my shoes for you that
[1:01:29] where thou standest is holy ground he
[1:01:31] took off his shoes I was I'm wondering
[1:01:34] maybe have we got so busy how
[1:01:37] have we gotten so busy with life and
[1:01:39] that we forgot to even reverence the
[1:01:43] temple of God do we just kind of feed on
[1:01:46] anything kind of entertained just
[1:01:49] anything kind of just get by with
[1:01:51] anything but no as you as you maybe you
[1:01:56] look at this pattern in the Old
[1:01:57] Testament I play God would deal with our
[1:02:00] hearts tonight as I look at this pattern
[1:02:03] in the Old Testament it's helping God
[1:02:05] bring a greater reverence to the
[1:02:08] tabernacle that he wants to dwell in oh
[1:02:12] just believe it it's the word I know
[1:02:15] it's hard but ye are the Temple of the
[1:02:19] Lord it matters how you dress it matters
[1:02:25] how you live it matters how you act and
[1:02:30] so as the prophets Dornish you could
[1:02:31] look at the Old Testament to better
[1:02:34] understand the New Testament and how
[1:02:37] people my goodness how people how they
[1:02:40] can be deceived that God doesn't care
[1:02:42] how you dress what's God just wasting
[1:02:44] his time for 4,000 years Moses do all
[1:02:47] this and do all that but it really
[1:02:49] doesn't matter
[1:02:50] no God cares he cares about his dress I
[1:02:55] would encourage you maybe task the Lord
[1:02:58] Lord are you pleased with the way that
[1:03:01] I'm dressed nor the high priest had to
[1:03:04] dress in such a perfect way when he
[1:03:08] would come into your presence everything
[1:03:10] had to be an order because if he didn't
[1:03:12] he would die or maybe as the bride of
[1:03:15] Jesus Christ and miss Jesus Christ we
[1:03:17] ought to start coming to our husband
[1:03:18] saying Lord do you like this shirt are
[1:03:23] you pleased with this Lord if you're not
[1:03:25] why don't you convict me Lord and if I
[1:03:27] can't hear from you maybe you can use
[1:03:28] one of the older sisters or maybe one of
[1:03:30] the brothers Lord can can speak to me Oh
[1:03:33] does are we open for correction are we
[1:03:38] open for accountability
[1:03:39] are we ready to come into our position
[1:03:42] in Jesus Christ what did our pastor say
[1:03:45] look in order to be adopted you have to
[1:03:48] be obedient
[1:03:51] you can't be adopted if you're not
[1:03:54] obedient and we're going to keep living
[1:03:56] the way we're living and dressing the
[1:03:58] way we're living and halfway coming to
[1:04:01] church and think we're going to be
[1:04:02] adopted and going a body change I say
[1:04:06] lord help me to catch a revelation help
[1:04:11] me to be obedient to your word help me
[1:04:14] to get that revelation that this is the
[1:04:16] temple of the Lord and may all of my
[1:04:18] thoughts may all of my actions may all
[1:04:20] of my works may all of my thinking may
[1:04:23] when I get up may when I go to bed may
[1:04:25] when I speak to my wife may when I speak
[1:04:27] to my children when I discipline them
[1:04:29] and work and talking to the brothers and
[1:04:31] talking to the sisters and going to the
[1:04:33] grocery store and when I go out to eat
[1:04:34] may it be you Lord living through me and
[1:04:37] may be a sweet savour offer it up to
[1:04:39] your life that's a pleasing sacrifice
[1:04:41] unto you just continuing on in this
[1:04:50] message a hidden life can y'all read
[1:04:55] that okay now I believe that this is the
[1:05:01] time that the church has arrived at
[1:05:03] today that the next great move in the
[1:05:05] church is for God after we've seen the
[1:05:08] false alarms but now God will place in
[1:05:10] his church correctly apostles prophets
[1:05:13] teachers evangelists not made man
[1:05:16] cinamon seminaries boughten but God will
[1:05:19] place in the church not theology run
[1:05:22] overs and overnights
[1:05:23] but God will place in the church as God
[1:05:26] has chosen as the Holy Ghost has tutored
[1:05:29] this church and raised it up and in
[1:05:32] their God will adopt into his into the
[1:05:35] position his sons they're already his
[1:05:38] sons but whether they are worthy of the
[1:05:42] position that he has for them now not
[1:05:46] that they're not worthy to be a son you
[1:05:49] always were a son you always were an
[1:05:52] eagle but are you an obedient son those
[1:05:59] I love I chastise I correct
[1:06:01] sometimes it struck me years ago that
[1:06:04] some people think that the trials
[1:06:07] they're going through are just part of
[1:06:10] the Christian life and being afflicted
[1:06:12] of the devil but maybe it's the
[1:06:14] correction of God trying to get your
[1:06:16] attention and to show you you're not
[1:06:18] living right and you keep chalking it up
[1:06:21] that oh my it's just I'm a Christian and
[1:06:24] it's hard to be the bride of Jesus
[1:06:25] Christ when the reason you keep going
[1:06:28] through cycles over and over and over is
[1:06:30] because you're not being obedient to the
[1:06:32] Word of God look we're talking about
[1:06:35] being tutored we're talking about being
[1:06:37] positionally placed that means the old
[1:06:41] chisel gots to come off and some of us
[1:06:43] you know we need the big old chisel
[1:06:44] hammer Lord just I need you to take like
[1:06:48] a 250 pound chip off this side and big
[1:06:52] old chip off that side I mean I need
[1:06:54] blocks falling off you know just talk
[1:06:56] and some people you know he got up a
[1:06:58] little fine little file but it's all
[1:07:02] part of it we got to start somewhere
[1:07:05] if you'll notice in a perfect type God
[1:07:12] did his own son the same way he taken
[1:07:14] three witnesses where the mouth of two
[1:07:16] or three witnesses every word be
[1:07:18] established Peter James and John love
[1:07:20] faith and hope are we all together here
[1:07:28] believe we are and he taken them up the
[1:07:34] mountain apart from the rest of the
[1:07:37] world and there before official
[1:07:39] witnesses God adopted his own son he was
[1:07:41] transfigured before them and his raiment
[1:07:43] did shine as the Sun and a voice out of
[1:07:47] a cloud said this is my beloved son hear
[1:07:51] ye him set him up upon the mountain put
[1:07:54] the witnesses there to see it clothed
[1:07:58] him in a robe and a bright as the sun
[1:07:59] shining even shine like the Sun and his
[1:08:01] strength and God spoke out this is my
[1:08:04] beloved son hear him
[1:08:06] God adopted his own child into the
[1:08:08] family hear me no longer but this is my
[1:08:13] son who takes over from here
[1:08:15] in that adoption is near the time in
[1:08:18] parable of the church it's time for that
[1:08:22] this is 1955 and it's time for that
[1:08:30] that's what our pastors been going
[1:08:32] through why cry speak hear ye him I love
[1:08:36] what what other David pointed out at the
[1:08:40] end of service he said that God was
[1:08:41] wanting to take it from God doing it to
[1:08:44] Moses doing it he was in the line of
[1:08:48] duty Church you're in the line of duty
[1:08:51] why cry speak I so moves upon my heart
[1:08:56] of brother Chris Harris's testimony he
[1:08:58] come down he was he was doing the best
[1:09:00] he knew to do coming down a once a month
[1:09:02] for service you know one day were
[1:09:04] sitting around fellowshiping and
[1:09:06] something struck him you know what I
[1:09:09] want to be in church every time he was
[1:09:13] in the line of duty so you know what he
[1:09:15] did he drove right back home walked into
[1:09:17] his bosses off and said I'm moving to
[1:09:18] Dallas been with the company 12 13 years
[1:09:21] with that status and position and this
[1:09:25] boss is like are you crazy you're just
[1:09:28] going to let lose everything I'm in the
[1:09:31] line of duty why cry speak I don't got
[1:09:33] to come beg I don't come to hey you know
[1:09:36] boss will you let me go to church maybe
[1:09:38] kind of you know I'm trying to go in a
[1:09:39] rapture and and I need to be obedient
[1:09:42] and I was just hoping if you maybe
[1:09:44] couldn't get salt with the god of this
[1:09:46] evil age and see if he might want to
[1:09:49] give me Sundays off
[1:09:50] look church you don't have to do it you
[1:09:54] don't have to do it now you do it you
[1:09:57] enter and behind the veil and let God
[1:09:59] speak to you okay don't don't take this
[1:10:02] the wrong way what I'm wanting to say by
[1:10:04] the Holy Spirit of Lord that you can
[1:10:08] enter into a place in a hidden life
[1:10:10] where God can so orchestrate your life
[1:10:13] that you can move into a situation like
[1:10:15] that and the outcome will be according
[1:10:17] to the desire of your heart to serve the
[1:10:19] Lord because you're in the line of duty
[1:10:22] and I believe a testimony like that of
[1:10:25] what brother Chris did can encourage you
[1:10:27] that if the desires there for you look
[1:10:30] if the desires not there you're not
[1:10:31] going to be there
[1:10:32] you don't desire to be a communion yeah
[1:10:34] you're not going to be there but I want
[1:10:36] to encourage you that if the desires
[1:10:38] there and it's according to the word
[1:10:40] then it's a promise that you can receive
[1:10:50] now the Prophet just moving progressing
[1:10:53] through the message here he says now
[1:10:54] let's drop back to the hidden life and
[1:10:58] find out what this is going to require
[1:11:00] to get into this place of adoption a
[1:11:03] hidden life we realized that in the Old
[1:11:06] Testament under the Mosaic law as we
[1:11:08] found out and there any reader knows
[1:11:10] that there were two veils two
[1:11:14] compartments and a congregation in the
[1:11:17] setup of God's Tabernacle in the
[1:11:18] wilderness the first was the
[1:11:21] congregation then the holy place then
[1:11:25] the holiest of Holies
[1:11:26] that's God's house that's God's dwelling
[1:11:29] place that's your dwelling place now you
[1:11:32] only live in a three-room house remember
[1:11:35] you may have two bedrooms you may have
[1:11:37] three kitchens but you only live in a
[1:11:40] three-room house now if you follow that
[1:11:43] out brother branham talks about how you
[1:11:45] have a place you eat a parlor where you
[1:11:47] would hang out in a place that you would
[1:11:49] sleep so if you have 10 of each he's
[1:11:51] saying that there's really only three
[1:11:53] rooms functional rooms that comprise the
[1:11:55] house and he goes on to say God lived in
[1:11:58] a three room house when God was on earth
[1:12:02] he occupied a three room house the sole
[1:12:06] body and spirit of Jesus Christ so you
[1:12:12] can start to see how in the tabernacle
[1:12:15] was even a type of the body it was God's
[1:12:19] dwelling place
[1:12:20] remember we said know ye not that ye are
[1:12:22] the temple of the Lord and you just
[1:12:25] start to look at the outer court here
[1:12:27] and and you can see the first pool body
[1:12:33] five senses justification
[1:12:35] all of these things are types and as you
[1:12:39] would come into the outer court there if
[1:12:42] you look at that you have the bronze
[1:12:45] altar there and so you would come in
[1:12:48] from the congregation you would move in
[1:12:51] to the outer court there and that's
[1:12:54] where you would come and offer your
[1:12:56] sacrifice that's where you would come
[1:12:59] and bring your your sheep or your lamb
[1:13:01] or whatever if it was a sacrifice of
[1:13:04] repentance or of worship that's where
[1:13:07] you would come and the Prophet is
[1:13:09] showing how that even the tabernacle is
[1:13:11] the wilderness was a type of the very
[1:13:14] bodies that we live in and such an
[1:13:17] amazing thing to behold and to see and a
[1:13:21] scripture says I don't know if we have
[1:13:23] it in here but in 2nd Corinthians 5:21
[1:13:27] it says for he F made him to be sin for
[1:13:30] us who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:13:34] the righteousness of God in him when you
[1:13:37] came into this outer Court you brought a
[1:13:39] sacrifice that was the only way to come
[1:13:42] in and approach God the first thing you
[1:13:44] had to do is that altar there had to be
[1:13:46] a sacrifice given the blood had to be
[1:13:49] applied and once the blood had been been
[1:13:52] applied oh then you could have boldness
[1:13:55] therefore we can come boldly to the
[1:13:57] throne of grace asking for mercy for
[1:14:00] grace to come to us in a time of need
[1:14:04] once the the blood has been applied once
[1:14:07] we believe so first justification you're
[1:14:11] seeing that here in the inner court Maya
[1:14:15] the time is just running away wow we're
[1:14:19] going to just have to finish this
[1:14:21] another time
[1:14:22] praise the Lord because if we finish
[1:14:25] this tonight would be a lock in praise
[1:14:33] the Lord
[1:14:34] so as you as you would come and approach
[1:14:36] the first thing you had to do was you
[1:14:39] the blood had to be applied but then as
[1:14:42] you follow on the pattern from there
[1:14:44] then what had to happen the priest would
[1:14:47] come to the bronze LaBrie there and then
[1:14:49] they would
[1:14:49] and there they would wash being cleansed
[1:14:53] unto the Lord and then as you would
[1:14:56] progress you would come into the holy
[1:14:58] place which is the inner Court which in
[1:15:01] type you can see the second pool we have
[1:15:05] the spirit now remember the prophet
[1:15:07] showed us that the tabernacle was a type
[1:15:10] of the body so you have the outer Court
[1:15:13] now you're coming into the inner court
[1:15:15] and here's where the spirit the
[1:15:17] imaginations conscience memory reason
[1:15:19] affection and this is a type of
[1:15:23] sanctification and when sanctification
[1:15:27] is being wrought in your life you're
[1:15:30] being cleansed and you're being
[1:15:32] sanctified and you're being set aside
[1:15:34] for service so we have to go through a
[1:15:37] cleansing we have to go through a
[1:15:38] process of where our life is being
[1:15:41] sanctified and if you just look at the
[1:15:45] the the the inner court there you can
[1:15:48] see the table of showbread and the
[1:15:50] lampstand and the altar of incense and
[1:15:52] my just even in this wind maybe if the
[1:15:56] Lord would lead another time you can
[1:15:57] actually see as when John writes
[1:15:59] revelation everything he is writing is
[1:16:02] in symbols and he's referring to the Old
[1:16:05] Testament and that's what he talks about
[1:16:07] the the the golden lampstands and that's
[1:16:09] being the seven churches you can see all
[1:16:11] of those types later right there in in
[1:16:16] the church in the church ages and
[1:16:18] brother Branham even later in this
[1:16:20] sermon I don't think we'll get to there
[1:16:21] but he's talking about the inner court
[1:16:23] and these things in the furniture of the
[1:16:24] inner court and showing that how you can
[1:16:26] perfectly see in the setting of the
[1:16:28] tabernacle you can see a justification
[1:16:30] sanctification and the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:33] see those steps of restoration coming
[1:16:36] down you can see this progression what
[1:16:38] you come into into the tabernacle there
[1:16:42] at the altar now it's justification and
[1:16:45] now you're we're washing in the in the
[1:16:47] lab or there now you're entering in into
[1:16:49] justification and where do you move on
[1:16:52] from justification now you keep
[1:16:54] progressing you've been sanctified
[1:16:56] you've been set aside for service
[1:17:02] and then we enter into the holiest of
[1:17:04] Holies and that's where oh my that's
[1:17:08] where my heart's crying that the Church
[1:17:12] of the Living God would be living and
[1:17:14] abiding and hidden away in there and
[1:17:19] it's not no mystery on how to get there
[1:17:22] Church for by one spirit are we all
[1:17:25] baptized into the body jesus said in
[1:17:30] John 6:63
[1:17:31] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:17:33] flesh profiteth nothing the words that I
[1:17:37] speak unto you they are spirit and
[1:17:39] they're and I look brother branham said
[1:17:42] you don't have to beg you don't have to
[1:17:44] plead and you don't have to tarry
[1:17:47] he said that's over they had to tarry
[1:17:50] for fifty days there at Pentecost but he
[1:17:53] said that's over when Peter yet spake
[1:17:55] these words they received the Holy Ghost
[1:17:58] there's no more waiting after that the
[1:18:01] prophecies right now you can receive it
[1:18:04] just have a willing heart reach right up
[1:18:07] to God believe it and accept it we see
[1:18:16] the type there in the holiest of Holies
[1:18:21] there the third pull the soul the
[1:18:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost we just find a
[1:18:32] place
[1:18:41] all right we're having some technical
[1:18:46] difficulties that's right we're almost
[1:18:52] we're almost over so in the temple he's
[1:19:00] in a congregation a holy place and the
[1:19:03] holiest of Holies each one of them was
[1:19:07] separated one from the other and each
[1:19:09] one had different furniture in it to
[1:19:11] show the dwelling place a very beautiful
[1:19:13] type of the church the center first
[1:19:16] comes into the kitchen as it was the
[1:19:19] kitchen is where you eat the living room
[1:19:20] is where you communion in the bedroom is
[1:19:22] where you rest
[1:19:23] Oh God see see the sinner comes in I'll
[1:19:32] just read this to you I'm not sure this
[1:19:35] is all progressing just right see the
[1:19:36] sinner comes in faith cometh by hearing
[1:19:38] hearing the word he comes and eats the
[1:19:41] word then he's baptized into the faith
[1:19:43] and accepts Christ as his personal
[1:19:45] Savior brings him in then to commune
[1:19:48] with God but then he moves on into the
[1:19:51] bedroom the steal quietness with God
[1:19:54] were all things of the world is shut out
[1:19:56] and he's alone in the stillness with God
[1:20:00] brethren sisters that's the place this
[1:20:03] Pentecostal move ought to be today not
[1:20:06] so much babbling word Trinity we're
[1:20:07] Methodists were Assemblies we're Church
[1:20:10] of God we ought to be alone in that
[1:20:12] quiet stillness with God don't you
[1:20:14] believe that certainly we ought to be
[1:20:17] there many people claim to be the
[1:20:21] tabernacle to be the dwelling place of
[1:20:24] God but the question is does he have
[1:20:26] three minutes in your life in Christ the
[1:20:33] mystery brother Branham says if ye abide
[1:20:34] in me and my word my word abide in you
[1:20:37] then ask what you will because you in
[1:20:40] the word are the same he has the
[1:20:43] preeminence he's got the rulership
[1:20:44] you're a prisoner to him the world is
[1:20:48] dead you see the rest of the people
[1:20:50] living the way they do
[1:20:51] but yet you do not do it you're a
[1:20:53] prisoner you're yoked with him my yoke
[1:20:55] is easy
[1:20:56] yoke twith Christ his word I do that
[1:20:59] only which pleases the father why
[1:21:01] because you're living a hidden life in
[1:21:03] Jesus Christ you have now entered in
[1:21:06] behind the veil all the prophets says he
[1:21:09] says oh that perfect rest to come from
[1:21:12] the congregation to the altar and from
[1:21:15] the altar to the bosom of Christ the bed
[1:21:20] the night the secret place the resting
[1:21:24] place maybe if the musicians would come
[1:21:30] we'll find a place just to finish here
[1:21:34] just reading out a second Corinthians
[1:21:37] will still be progressing a little
[1:21:39] further in these slides so if we could
[1:21:42] leave those up that would be great
[1:21:48] second Corinthians 3:6 says and such
[1:21:51] trusts have we through Christ to God
[1:21:53] word not that we are sufficient of
[1:21:56] ourselves to think anything as ourselves
[1:21:58] but our sufficiency is of God who also
[1:22:02] hath made us able ministers of the New
[1:22:04] Testament not of the letter but of the
[1:22:07] spirit for the letter killeth but the
[1:22:09] spirit giveth life but if the
[1:22:11] ministration of death written engraven
[1:22:13] in stones was glorious so that the
[1:22:15] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[1:22:18] behold the face of Moses for the glory
[1:22:20] of his countenance which glory was to be
[1:22:22] done away how shall not the ministration
[1:22:24] of the Spirit be rather glorious for if
[1:22:28] the ministration of condemnation be
[1:22:31] glory now think of this if the
[1:22:34] ministration of condemnation be glory
[1:22:36] why because the letter killeth if the
[1:22:39] ministration of combination be glory
[1:22:40] much more dull administration of
[1:22:42] righteousness exceed and glory for even
[1:22:46] that which was made glorious had no
[1:22:48] glory in this respect oh we're looking
[1:22:51] at that pillar of fire well we're
[1:22:53] looking at that Tabernacle
[1:22:55] we're looking at the order of the temple
[1:22:58] and the people are capped all the way
[1:22:59] around it for even that which was made
[1:23:04] glorious had no glory in this respect by
[1:23:05] reason of the glory that Excel ahthe for
[1:23:09] if that which was done away was glorious
[1:23:13] much more that which remaineth is
[1:23:17] glorious ye are the temple of the Lord
[1:23:21] you realize how glorious that is that's
[1:23:26] a pillar of fire would want to settle
[1:23:29] down upon this congregation how many
[1:23:32] little it's a fire the holy ghost and
[1:23:35] dwelling in you and in you and in you
[1:23:37] and at you until those nine spiritual
[1:23:40] gifts that are were gained to operate in
[1:23:42] the local body to start working in
[1:23:44] harmony and unity we all start stepping
[1:23:48] into our positions in the door places
[1:23:50] and having a books of Acts all of it if
[1:23:53] that ever puts forth another branch
[1:23:55] oh brother Matthew they're taking away
[1:24:00] from the power of God in this church
[1:24:01] today and the healings and the signs
[1:24:03] that are that are happening no I'm not
[1:24:05] doing that
[1:24:06] but I'm saying there's more there's more
[1:24:09] I want adoption I want to be in my place
[1:24:12] I want to be in my position I don't want
[1:24:15] to be holding up the show I want to be
[1:24:17] behind the veil living in the secret
[1:24:21] place
[1:24:25] maybe next time if the Lord would lead
[1:24:29] this is just kind of a setting of the
[1:24:33] tabernacle you can seek just the names
[1:24:35] of the camps of Israel around the
[1:24:39] tabernacle and my I would feel like I
[1:24:42] was shortchanged if I just didn't read
[1:24:44] this I want to read this because brother
[1:24:47] Branham here and preaching revelations
[1:24:49] chapter 4 he's on the blackboard and
[1:24:52] he's drawing all this out and oh I wish
[1:24:54] I could have seen it but he's actually
[1:24:56] showing how you can see the pattern of
[1:24:59] the Garden of Eden and you can see the
[1:25:00] pattern of the tabernacle and you can
[1:25:02] see the pattern of the things in heaven
[1:25:03] and all as as Adam and Eve were were
[1:25:06] driven out to the east and there was
[1:25:12] cherubims guarding the Tree of Life
[1:25:14] there at the east gate brother Brent
[1:25:16] says that's where Cain and Abel came and
[1:25:17] they were all kurds offer a sacrifice he
[1:25:20] said why was it there because the altar
[1:25:22] had moved there to the east gate so they
[1:25:25] had to come to the east gate when God
[1:25:27] patterned the tabernacle he showed
[1:25:28] what's through the way back to the Tree
[1:25:30] of Life you got to come right through
[1:25:31] that east gate you got to come through
[1:25:34] the east gate there and you got to come
[1:25:36] to the altar of sacrifice and then into
[1:25:39] the holiest of Holies and then go in
[1:25:42] behind the veil I believe we have this
[1:25:47] so we can read this
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:51] just as we maybe let's just stand we're
[1:25:54] not gonna be labor but I just want you
[1:25:58] all to listen to read this this is
[1:25:59] beautiful
[1:26:00] therefore the Lord sent him forth from
[1:26:03] the Garden of Eden to till the ground
[1:26:04] from whence he was taken so he drove out
[1:26:07] the man and placed them at the east of
[1:26:09] the Garden of Eden cherubims flaming
[1:26:12] swords which turns every way see those
[1:26:15] four beasts there's only four ways you
[1:26:18] can go see east north west and south
[1:26:21] these Chairman's had flaming swords at
[1:26:23] the gate of the garden to keep the way
[1:26:24] of the Tree of Life
[1:26:26] because if man ever got ahold of the
[1:26:28] Tree of Life then he could live forever
[1:26:30] and these cherubims first mentioned was
[1:26:32] placed at the east gate of the garden
[1:26:35] going four ways I should have made it a
[1:26:38] little different from that I can't do it
[1:26:40] justly to God's orders and things like
[1:26:42] that just so y'all know what I mean so
[1:26:44] he's referring to the blackboard there
[1:26:49] there's the Garden of Eden and this is
[1:26:52] the gate right here opens up here and
[1:26:54] swings out and at this gate there was
[1:26:58] cherubims cherubims a remember doesn't
[1:27:00] say a cherubim it says cherubims
[1:27:02] Cheerios was placed there to guard what
[1:27:05] the Tree of Life that's that's what they
[1:27:10] was to guard the way of the Tree of Life
[1:27:12] who is the way where is it reflected
[1:27:15] from here is the holy place here are the
[1:27:18] cherubim sees he's making this whole
[1:27:22] diagram and layout here now watch put it
[1:27:25] all down here is the holiest of Holies
[1:27:28] here's the holiest of holies this is the
[1:27:31] holy place and here's the see there and
[1:27:34] watch the light the candles the seven
[1:27:35] that reflects the light from here and
[1:27:37] here and here and here see what do they
[1:27:39] reflect they are guarding and reflecting
[1:27:42] with the fire of God the way to the Tree
[1:27:46] of Life now I pray that I'm just peeking
[1:27:49] your intrest right now we don't have
[1:27:50] time to go through this but maybe you
[1:27:52] can go dig in and start looking into it
[1:27:54] study the message and you could see this
[1:27:55] how beautiful this type is of what God
[1:27:59] was showing there in the Tabernacle in
[1:28:01] the wilderness see
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:11] see it can't come from over here
[1:28:14] Presbyterian seminary or Pentecostal
[1:28:16] isn't sitting there it's got to come
[1:28:18] from here reflecting that light you
[1:28:20] notice these cherub loans that John saw
[1:28:22] here must have been interested in
[1:28:24] keeping the Tree of Life so there must
[1:28:26] be interested in human beings
[1:28:28] Regenesis getting back to Genesis they
[1:28:30] kept the Tree of Life guarded it the way
[1:28:33] of the Tree of Life how is the way Jesus
[1:28:35] said I am the way I am the bread that
[1:28:38] cometh from God out of heaven if a man
[1:28:40] eats this bread he'll live forever
[1:28:42] now there is the way back to that tree
[1:28:44] of life you get it now this is what I
[1:28:46] want to show show it now and make this
[1:28:49] shirt it's an altar now this must have
[1:28:52] been an altar at the Garden of Eden and
[1:28:54] I'll tell you why do you remember both
[1:28:58] Cain and Abel come up here to worship so
[1:29:02] that showed that God's altar was moved
[1:29:04] and set here at the Garden of Eden and
[1:29:07] the only way back to Eden is by the
[1:29:10] altar here you go again see back to Eden
[1:29:13] through the altar and they were to keep
[1:29:15] that way they're guarded that they
[1:29:18] couldn't get back there until this altar
[1:29:20] was covered with blood Oh God can't
[1:29:22] people see it see it's nothing but the
[1:29:25] blood there has to be an atonement a
[1:29:27] mercy seat there this altar of judgment
[1:29:30] must become a mercy seat when this altar
[1:29:32] if the blood is lifted there will stand
[1:29:35] on that Judgment Day the fire of God's
[1:29:37] wrath to guard the tree of tree again
[1:29:39] only one thing will enter into the gate
[1:29:42] to eat McGinn will be through the blood
[1:29:44] of Jesus Christ you see it oh what a
[1:29:47] beautiful beautiful type we're looking
[1:29:49] about you can see if you look coming to
[1:29:51] that east gate there it's the way back
[1:29:54] to the Tree of Life and he said the most
[1:29:57] peculiar thing is that the altar had
[1:29:59] moved you know so many people get tied
[1:30:02] up when brother Branham preaches the
[1:30:04] breech and says the lamb had to leave
[1:30:06] the mercy seat to come and take the book
[1:30:10] and the scripture say I'm a hippie who'd
[1:30:12] be filthy be filthy still but all of you
[1:30:14] follow the blood trail
[1:30:17] this message is Grace
[1:30:20] to reject it as judgment this is the
[1:30:24] Word of God there's an altar there it's
[1:30:27] the way back while everybody was
[1:30:30] standing out in denominationalism all
[1:30:32] that outer darkness and chaos but he
[1:30:35] said come out from amongst her my people
[1:30:38] come back to the word that's where grace
[1:30:41] is Oh hallelujah
[1:30:45] just beyond
