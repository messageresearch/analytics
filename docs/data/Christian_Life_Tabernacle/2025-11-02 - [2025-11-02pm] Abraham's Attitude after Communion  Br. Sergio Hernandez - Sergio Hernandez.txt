Description:
Abraham's Attitude after Communion
Br. Sergio Hernandez
Sunday Evening Communion Service
November 2nd, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

We're happy to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's [clears throat] open our Bibles in uh a book of Psalms uh uh Psalm uh 103. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Psalm 103, we're going to start on verse uh 8. Verse 8. The word of the Lord says, "The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and plenches in mercy. He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever. He had not dealt with us after our our sins, nor to water us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. [snorts] &gt;&gt; As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. Like like as a father peerth his children, so the Lord peerth them that fear him. For he knows our frame. He remembers that we are dust. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for uh this opportunity that you give us to come back and worship your name, Lord. Father God, certainly our bodies are tired, Lord. Our minds are tired, Lord, but we want to please you, Lord. And father, come and speak to us, Lord. And help us, Lord. Help me to put myself aside, Lord, that you may come and speak through my lips, Lord. Close my mouth to anything that is contrary to your word, Lord. And open my mouth to all truth and righteousness. And Father, that your people may be helped, Lord. Father, for that's that's the purpose of the preaching, Lord, to bring your children closer to you. Father, we [snorts] ask you for everything that you've done for us. We we thank you for everything you've done for us. We thank you for Calvary, Lord. We thank you for that sacrifice because without that sacrifice, we would be completely lost eternally, Lord. But now there is a bridge between this earth and heaven. Thank you for everything that you've done for us, Lord. And help us, Lord. Reveal your word to us one more time, Father. For we ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pray for me. Too many eyes looking this way. God bless you. So, uh I I uh I appreciate brother uh David giving me the opportunity to speak. It's an honor to speak before the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. It's not like you are a politician and you're trying to somebody to vote for you. He already voted for me. [laughter] So I don't have to convince anyone because he voted for me. &gt;&gt; He said, "I chose you before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; And this morning we learned that we are children of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; What he has spoke of us, that's what we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we just we just marching onto Zion. &gt;&gt; And the victory belongs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this um uh I I would like to speak a little bit about the mercy of the Lord and his grace. And I I would like to speak a little bit about um Abraham's attitude after communion. So uh we we find Abraham having communion with God in Genesis chapter 14 after Abraham went into battle, &gt;&gt; right? Abraham, you know the story. &gt;&gt; Uh Abraham had a nephew and and both of them received blessings. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Ram says sometimes blessings do not mean you get closer to God. Lot got very much blessed, &gt;&gt; but because of those blessings that he received, he went into the world. &gt;&gt; He set his tent towards Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; He did not get there right away, &gt;&gt; but slowly and surely he got there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then and then the enemy came and of course you think the enemy is is trying to destroy you. Well, wait until you are grafted by him. &gt;&gt; You know, cuz we have a great enemy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Without Jesus, we're nothing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And Satan will destroy our lives. &gt;&gt; So, so uh uh you know, Lot was in Sodom and Gomorrah. Some kings came in and and and took over the city and then they took Lot captive with them &gt;&gt; with a with a kids &gt;&gt; with a wife with everything &gt;&gt; and and somebody escaped and went and told uh Abraham or Abraham and said, "Abraham, your nephew has been captured with the rest of the people." And you know, Abraham had the attitude of his father because if you if you read the the Bible, it says that God was his father. &gt;&gt; You know, right? If you go back go back, his father was Adam and then it says and and Adam was a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So So Abraham had the attitude of his father, an attitude of mercy. When when when Lot was lost, &gt;&gt; Abraham did not say, "Well, good for him. He deserved what he No, &gt;&gt; he had a he had a different attitude. &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm going to go and get my family." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to go and get what God gave to me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, the blessing the blessing came Brother teaches us that we have to separate ourselves from everybody, right? to receive a blessing from the Lord. &gt;&gt; But yet God is merciful. &gt;&gt; And even when people get away from the Lord, &gt;&gt; you know, Abraham was a son of prophecy. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM HAD A PROPHECY ABOUT HIS SON. Isaac was that son of prophecy that that that Elohim spoke to Abraham about. And and Abraham and Abraham believed for 25 years about that prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we we have here Lot. Lot is a relative of Abraham. &gt;&gt; But Lot decided not to follow the message. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. &gt;&gt; You know what? Abraham had a big pencil. &gt;&gt; You know what pencils are for? &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, but you to make circles. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, we we are too fast to pull to put people out. &gt;&gt; We message believers are &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. This is my first time. Probably we my last. BUT WE ARE WE ARE TOO FAST TO PUT PEOPLE OUT, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; You know, we're like, "Oh, well, you don't believe like I do. You don't do this the way I do." YOU'RE OUT. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU'RE NOBODY to put anybody out. I'm nobody to put anybody out. &gt;&gt; The only one that can put me out is God. The only one that can put anybody out of the blood is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am under the blood and you are under the blood. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says even the prostitutes on the street are under the blood. &gt;&gt; When brother Bram was in that in that uh little place, you know, little restaurant, he thought it was a restaurant, but turned out it wasn't. [laughter] Right. And that old lady tried to try to, you know, flirt with him and he's like, "Ma'am, I'm a preacher. Have you heard of William Abraham?" She's like, "Yes, well, I'm him." And you know the story before he went to that lady, he was condemning her &gt;&gt; know and and God told him, "Look, look, Billy, &gt;&gt; get behind the door. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you something." &gt;&gt; And the Lord showed him how merciful God is. You know there is a blood that is covering as long as the bride of Jesus Christ is here there is mercy &gt;&gt; there is a mercy seat &gt;&gt; and that mercy seat is in the heart of the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So do not be TOO FAST TO PUT ANYBODY OUT [laughter] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MY God is rich in mercy &gt;&gt; and you have the same God that I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's one something that our God is not poor on is mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. His His mercies &gt;&gt; are new &gt;&gt; every morning. &gt;&gt; See, this is Sunday night already, &gt;&gt; but don't worry, tomorrow morning, &gt;&gt; his mercies are going to be brand new. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we have Abraham here. He goes, he fights for his nephew. Imagine that. He goes and fights for his nephew. And after he fights for his nephew, brother Ram says in in in in the message, "Who is this?" Mechisedc preach in 1965 paragraph 105 says, "Notice after the battle was over, Mechisedc served his victorious child communion. &gt;&gt; Communion. &gt;&gt; Think of that &gt;&gt; part of himself." Now we want to see here in type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave himself because the communion is part of Christ &gt;&gt; and after the struggle is over after you've done got after you you've done got yourself wipe out then is when you partake of Christ &gt;&gt; become part of his being. You get it? &gt;&gt; So if you have a battle if you're struggling with something you fight it. &gt;&gt; Don't don't give up. Amen. Because when you fight, &gt;&gt; God is with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ himself promised, "I will not leave you. &gt;&gt; I will not forsake you. I be I will be with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until when? &gt;&gt; Until next Sunday. &gt;&gt; Until the next revival? No. Until the end? &gt;&gt; So, you're fighting A BATTLE. &gt;&gt; KEEP FIGHTING THAT BATTLE. THERE WAS a a a prophecy spoken about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in that prophecy says that you are the overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I know that sometimes we feel like we're losers, but we're not. &gt;&gt; We're overcomers. &gt;&gt; When we are rich, we're overcomers. When we're poor, we're overcomers. When we're healthy, we're overcomers. WHEN WE ARE NOT FEELING TOO WELL IN OUR HEALTH, WE'RE OVERCOMERS. AMEN. When things are going great, we're overcomers. WHEN WE HAVE PROBLEMS AT HOME, WE ARE OVERCOMERS. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL THROWS AT YOU, YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER BECAUSE A PROPHECY WAS ALREADY WRITTEN ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; AND THERE IS NOTHING THE DEVIL CAN DO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE IS NO DEMON IN HELL THAT CAN STOP THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU WANT TO HAVE COMMUNION WITH GOD, YOU GOT TO STRUGGLE IT. YOU GOT TO FIGHT IT. YOU CANNOT GIVE UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother says, "Jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn his and wouldn't turn him loose until he bless him." Amen. So sometimes the problem with with us in in this age is that we give up too fast. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We give up too fast. Oh, YOU ARE ASKING GOD FOR a blessing. YOU ARE ASKING GOD TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING. Don't give up. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want the baptism of the Holy Ghost. DON'T GIVE UP TOO FAST. &gt;&gt; You're looking at your situation. You're looking at your troubles. Well, now it's time to start looking at the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Battle for life. Battle for life. And after the battle is over, then God gives you out. Then God gives you of himself. &gt;&gt; That is his true communion. Amen. &gt;&gt; The little bread and wafer just represents it. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't take it unless you've wrestled it out and become part of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you are going through a wrestling time and and most of the time, you know who we wrestle against, &gt;&gt; that's the person that we wrestle the most. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brham says the one that always gets on the way &gt;&gt; is William Branham. The one that is always trying to disbelieve the word is William Branham. &gt;&gt; So the one that's always on the way is Sergio. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; The one that's always struggling to believe it's me. &gt;&gt; So I have to battle with myself and I have to tell the devil, you know what, devil? There was something written about me. Brother Abraham says the THE THING ABOUT JESUS IS THAT HE BELIEVED the word. WHEN JESUS WAS GOING DOWN, YOU KNOW, WHEN JESUS DIED, HE WENT TO THE DEEPEST part of hell, right? WE WAS GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN. HE WAS NOT A SINNER, BUT HE WAS SIN &gt;&gt; AND NOTHING THAT WITH SIN CAN ENTER INTO GOD'S PRESENCE. SO, HE COULDN'T GO UP. &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOING DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN. BUT THEN THE BIBLE SAYS, BUT THEN HE REMEMBER &gt;&gt; HE REMEMBER IN THE BOOK IT'S WRITTEN ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It doesn't matter how low you are. It doesn't matter how low YOU'RE GETTING INTO. WHAT HELL YOU'RE GETTING IN. &gt;&gt; Remember this &gt;&gt; in the book &gt;&gt; in the book &gt;&gt; is written about me. &gt;&gt; So he stopped &gt;&gt; and he's like [clears throat] the keys are mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The keys are mine. That's why when brother Ram had that that that brother had that dream about those people that were in in jail, right? Huh? There was nothing that could that could get get him out. &gt;&gt; But brother Rama spoke the word. &gt;&gt; Spoke the word &gt;&gt; and and and and and and THE BARS OF HELL HAD TO GET LOOSE. &gt;&gt; Had to break UP SO THAT GOD'S CHILDREN CAN GO FREE. &gt;&gt; NOW THAT WORD WAS ALREADY SPOKEN. THE JAIL IS ALREADY OPEN. AMEN. The earthquake already came. AMEN. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Don't be like Johnny Crow. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember, at this time, the communion had never been instituted. Not until before the death of Jesus Christ, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of year later. But MelkiseDC after his child Abraham had had won the victory, Melkisedc met him and gave him wine and bread, showing that after this earthly battle is over, we will meet him in the heavens and take the communion again. &gt;&gt; It'll be the wedding supper. I will not drink no more of the wine or eat of the fruit until I eat and drink it with you a new in my father's kingdom. Is that right? Amen. Notice again, MelkiseDC went to meet Abraham before he got back home. What a beautiful type. Here we have Melkisedc meeting Abraham before he got back home after the battle. &gt;&gt; So you going through a battle is a good sign. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Said, "Oh, brother, I'm I I'm going through some battles." &gt;&gt; Well, don't give up. &gt;&gt; Don't give up. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; Shake yourself a little bit. &gt;&gt; Huh? Maybe slap yourself a little bit. &gt;&gt; You know what I MEAN? BUT GET UP, &gt;&gt; DUST YOURSELF OFF, AND KEEP GOING and keep GOING BECAUSE IN THE BOOK IS WRITTEN ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's the type of communion THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; WE DO NOT REALIZE SOMETIMES THAT WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US IS THE REVEALED WORD OF GOD, THE BLEEDING WORD. OH, WHEN I HEARD that this morning, I was like, "Oh, man." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE BLEEDING WORD OF GOD, THAT WORD IS STILL BLEEDING. THAT BLOOD [screaming] STILL HAS POWER TO SAVE THE LOWEST OF SINNER. THAT BLOOD STILL [screaming] HAS POWER TO TRANSFORM ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SATAN HAS PLACED IN YOUR BRAINS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SATAN PUTS IN YOUR HEAD, IN THE BOOK. STILL WRITTEN ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I I get emotional. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for getting emotional. &gt;&gt; Or maybe I should forgive you for not getting emotional. It works both ways. You know, &gt;&gt; it works both ways. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, we can all be like, "Oh, I don't know what I'm going to do." You know what you're going to do. &gt;&gt; You know what you're going to do &gt;&gt; when we meet Jesus. When I see him face to face. Oh, brother. &gt;&gt; I don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm going to do something. I'M GOING TO BE LIKE, "HEY, I'M [screaming] HERE. HEY, &gt;&gt; you know, I'm loud. &gt;&gt; So, if anybody's going to see him, brother." &gt;&gt; He's like, "Oh, well, the brother want to see him. That's fine with you. I'm going to scream cuz I want him to hear me. &gt;&gt; Like that little girl that was waving her flag, right? Remember the king was passing by AND SHE WAS, "HEY, KING, I'M HERE." AND THEN THEN the the little girl stayed behind from the class and she was crying and the teacher couldn't find her. And the teacher WENT BACK AND SHE WAS HIDING THERE ALL SAD. SHE SAID LIKE, "WHY YOU CRYING? DID YOU FLAG YOU WAVE YOUR FLAG?" "YES." "Did you say the words?" "Yes." "So why you crying?" He's like, "Because I saw the king, but he didn't see me." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. My word, the word of God says that he saw me. &gt;&gt; That he saw me even before I was formed in my mother's womb. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then we we find a we find Abraham once again in Genesis 18. &gt;&gt; And then when we find him in Genesis 18, now Abraham is 99 years old. &gt;&gt; Mechisedc who is God. Amen. and the the great the the the great shepherd uh the high priest, &gt;&gt; the king of kings, the king of peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He met him first when he fought the first battle. But now Abraham is fighting another battle. Now Abraham is fighting a battle within himself because this time Abraham is 99 YEARS OLD. HIS WIFE WERE 100 YEARS OLD. HIS WIFE or or his wife is what 10 years younger than him. &gt;&gt; So both of them are very old. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; There was no hope for Sarah to have children. &gt;&gt; But yet, if you read the the previous chapters, the Lord told that the LORD TELLS ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM, YOUR WIFE SARAH, WHO is 89 years old, is going to have a kid from you. &gt;&gt; And what did Abraham do? He laughed. &gt;&gt; Why did Sarah laugh? Because she was part of Abraham. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you haven't read your Bible, go back and read it. Maybe I'm lying to you. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; You know, put me to the test. &gt;&gt; Put the word to the test. Brother says, "Give it the word test." &gt;&gt; If it doesn't pass the word test, I don't care if it pass the Pentecostal test or the Baptist test or the Lutheran test or the Catholic test. It has to pass the word test. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Abraham laughed. But the Lord said, "YOU KNOW WHAT, ABRAHAM? NO MATTER WHAT YOU believe or not is what I say &gt;&gt; because Abraham was a child of the prophecy." &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but that preaching this morning, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; It got in my head, brother. &gt;&gt; But you know what else it got in my heart? &gt;&gt; Because I was like, "Hey, that's me. &gt;&gt; The one in the mirror is me." You know what I mean? When you look at that mirror, &gt;&gt; when I look at that mirror, I cannot see Sergio. &gt;&gt; Cuz he said, Brother said, God has no feet. God has no hands now. But you are his feet. You're his hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are Jesus. &gt;&gt; Miss Jesus Christ. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we have we find Abra Abraham here in in in uh in memory. And now he is in the evening time just waiting, chilling, thinking &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden there comes three figures &gt;&gt; from far away but somehow he recognizes one. [snorts] you. It reminds me always always reminds me of the story of the story of uh Peter in in in the in uh the the book of Fox's book of martyrs. It it reminds me when when Peter when Peter uh was about to be caught, the the the saints uh deliver him through a window and he was about to escape the city and and and when he was about to get to the gates of the city, he he sees a figure coming his way and he kind of recognizes that figure. &gt;&gt; He's like, I know him. I've known, you know, you know how you like you see somebody from away like I think that's my dad. I think the way he walks, you know, just the way he's like this or I don't know. He recognized like if you're a child, you recognize him. Like the closer he got, you figure out, well, that's Jesus. He said, Lord, where are you going? And and and it says in the book and Jesus answered him, I am going back to be crucified again. Peter said, "Okay, Lord, if you're going to be crucified again, I'm going to be crucified with you." &gt;&gt; But he recognized him. Isn't it amazing? John in the island of Patmas when he sees that great vision, &gt;&gt; he sees that great man coming from the light that was in the midst of the church age the church you know the the candlesticks when he is looking at that picture and that great vision that he describes he's describing Jehovah &gt;&gt; you know what I mean the one that that that Jeremiah saw Ezekiel the great light He's describing the great Jehovah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But as this person character walks closer to him, &gt;&gt; he begins to recognize him. &gt;&gt; He's like, "Wait a second. Wait." &gt;&gt; But Jehovah, [snorts] &gt;&gt; but he's getting closer to me. I was I rested on your bosom. Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I s with you. &gt;&gt; I slept with you &gt;&gt; on the streets of Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; He recognized that wasn't just Jehovah. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus. &gt;&gt; And he fainted. &gt;&gt; When you recognize who he is, &gt;&gt; that's when you recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; That's when you recognize who you are. Right. &gt;&gt; The angel told brother Arab, brother, the angel told him, William Brham, &gt;&gt; Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; But you need you need to have fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Communion with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Abraham was having. Communion. He sees this this character. He recognizes this character and then he invites him to come and eat with him. He has fellowship with him. And as he's having fellowship with him, this this this uh uh character Elohim does the work of the son of man, a prophet. He begins to discern the thoughts and intentions of their hearts. He even discerns the thoughts and intentions of the lady that was in in the other on the other room, &gt;&gt; Sarah. She laughed. He said, "Why did she laugh?" So, I didn't laugh. See, God wasn't kill going to kill her because she laughed, but he was going to kill her because she said, "You're lying." &gt;&gt; You know, that's the difference. &gt;&gt; You may you may doubt the word, but don't tell God that he's lying cuz he doesn't lie. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and and and as he having he's having communion and then you see the two the two angels walking away but Abraham stays with Elohim &gt;&gt; and as Elohim is walking away Elohim says my son Abraham is going to teach his children and his grandchildren to walk after me. &gt;&gt; He's going to teach them my commandments, my statutes. &gt;&gt; Can I hide anything from Abraham? Oh brother. &gt;&gt; And he did it. He revealed the word to him. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Are we Abraham's seed &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; We have the revelation. &gt;&gt; We can boast about it. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Like, well, we have to be humble. Well, humbly boasting about it. We have the revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil make you feel sorry for yourself because you believe this message. &gt;&gt; Sister, don't let the devil MAKE YOU SORRY BECAUSE YOU have long skirts and long hair and no makeup odd. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother, don't make the devil MAKE YOU FEEL SORRY. ESPECIALLY IF YOU YOUNG MEN, DON'T make the devil make you feel sorry because you you never had a girlfriend yet. &gt;&gt; No. No. Don't worry. God has somebody for you. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? He spoke it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, look at me. I'm not that great looking and I have a beautiful wife. &gt;&gt; Blessed be in the name of the Lord. So, believe the word. &gt;&gt; He said, "Wow." What? To many to the old people doesn't mean much, but to young people that means a lot. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean, sister? You don't have to be showing yourself to anybody over there. God has something somebody very special for you. &gt;&gt; You know brothers, you don't have to be looking outside anywhere. There is nothing good outside. &gt;&gt; There is nothing good outside the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to be looking at anybody over there. As a matter of fact, if you have a little girlfriend over there, caught up with her because that is not God's will. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's going to get me in troubles, but that's all right. Let me get in troubles a little bit for the word of God and save you from a life of pain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, let let me go back here if I can. Hallelujah. And and and and then we find we see Abraham, he's he's talking to Elohim. And as he's talking to Elohim and Elohim tells him what he's going to do in Sodom and Gomorrah. Then what does Abraham do? What is the attitude of Abraham? &gt;&gt; An attitude of mercy. &gt;&gt; Imagine that. &gt;&gt; It is an attitude of mercy. I hope I hope we we get the same attitude. &gt;&gt; I hope we have the same attitude. The attitude of mercy, &gt;&gt; not an attitude of of well, if you're out there, well, that's good for you and you know, if the rapture comes and you stay behind, well, I'm sorry. No, no, that's not the attitude of a believer. The attitude of a believer is I'm going to ask mercy. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to ask God to save them. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask God to bring them &gt;&gt; in. &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham did. &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, you mean to tell me you're going to destroy the United States of America?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. You mean to tell me you don't pray for America anymore? No. But I pray for the saints in America. Said, "What if there's 50 50 uh righteous men? Would you destroy them?" And and he he he begins to make business with God. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Make a bit with God. &gt;&gt; 50 50. Give me 50. Well, what if I don't find 50? Well, 45. Give me 45. Can you give me 45? &gt;&gt; 25. 30. 30. Can you give me 30? &gt;&gt; He's been with God. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we supposed to be doing, brother. Save my family, Lord. Say save my cousins. Say, "My grandma, my my my grandpa, my son, my daughter, my brother, my sister. Bring them in, Lord. Bring them in, Lord. If you don't want to bring the whole family, at least bring half of them." Amen. &gt;&gt; Just bring them in, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, it sounds like it sounds, you know, but we lack that. &gt;&gt; We lack that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when people don't say amen, you know, you're saying what is right. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not really sorry. &gt;&gt; It's me. I cannot be another person. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You you you have to be yourself. &gt;&gt; Because God created you that way. &gt;&gt; You know, if if you if you can sing, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if you cannot sing but you love to sing, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God made you that way. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; So So just praise God no matter what. Say, "Lord, I brother, I don't have a voice to sing." Well, just praise him. &gt;&gt; Praise him with everything that you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the only thing you can do is whistle, well, whistle for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just brother says here in in in the message, uh, hearing, recognizing, and acting on the word of God. I'm going to try to finish, brother. [snorts] Watch what happened in in the days of Lot. There was lot down there in Sodom. will well settle down intellectually become the one of the big men of the city. The judge setting gates and judged the people. His wife belonged to all societies there was in the city and his daughters and all of them married among the celebrity, intellectual, highly educated, smart, witty and Abraham lived in a tent under an oak tree. But one day they both got a visitation. &gt;&gt; You know that both groups got a visitation. We got a visitation from the angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; you know what I mean? Through the seventh angel messenger, &gt;&gt; you know, and over there they got their visitation. And they've got two great revivals. One great revival of the Baptist church and another great revival of the Pentecostal church. Billy Graham preaching to the Baptist people. Oral Roberts preaching to the Pentecostals. One got very intellectual. The other one gave got very powerful and emotional. &gt;&gt; We got the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? SO EVERYBODY GOT their visitation. &gt;&gt; Everybody got their visitation. &gt;&gt; You have family. I have family who got THEIR VISITATION BUT THEY REFUSED THEIR VISITATION. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that God cannot save them because my God is rich in mercy &gt;&gt; and is slow to anger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there was an intellectual preacher went down and preached and called him out. Look, look at the message. Come out, he said to Lot. And he would never been called out if he had not been for the mercy of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Do you have mercy? &gt;&gt; Do I have mercy? &gt;&gt; If we are Abraham's seed, &gt;&gt; we got to have mercy. &gt;&gt; Stop putting people out. That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus never asked you put people out. &gt;&gt; Did he tell you to do that? &gt;&gt; No. He tell you, He told us this morning, preach the revealed word of God, and the revealed word of God will forgive the sins of the people. &gt;&gt; That's what we were told this morning. &gt;&gt; At least that's what I understood. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Amen. &gt;&gt; So I need to preach the word that came from the seventh messenger, the seventh angel messenger, &gt;&gt; right? And that revealed word when is when people hear it, sooner or later they will come in. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's in God's time. Here is Lot. If if if if uh really quick if you go with me to uh Genesis 18, [snorts] blessed be the name of the Lord. Genesis 19 verse 15. And when the and when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters which are there, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. And while he lingered, the man laid hold upon his hand. That's very interesting. When I read that, I I never paid attention to that until I heard brother Graham. But I'll tell you what what I heard brother Graham said. Then I was like, "Oh, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, the Lord being merciful unto him." Why was the Lord merciful unto him? He was in Sodom and Gomorrah. He deserved no mercy. &gt;&gt; He deserved to die with the rest of the people. &gt;&gt; But there was a little man, &gt;&gt; huh? Out there, &gt;&gt; that he that Lot did not want to have anything to do with his father because Abraham was his father. He raised him. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM WAS LOT'S DAD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND LIKE ANY SPOILED CHILD, HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO do with you." WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU GET AWAY FROM MOM AND DAD, THERE IS A PRAYER THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO REACH YOU. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ABRAHAM DID. HE PRAYED AND PRAYED AND PRAYED AND BEGGED AND BEGGED. AND EVEN THOUGH HE never mentioned LOT'S NAME, GOD KNEW THAT THAT WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT WAS IN IN ABRAHAM'S MIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND GOD SAID TO THE ANGELS, "LOOK, LOOK GUYS, WHEN YOU GO DOWN THERE, I mean, this is me, okay? Not don't like what quote." No, no. This is me thinking out loud, OKAY? GOD SAID TO THE ANGELS, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN YOU GO DOWN THERE, you you guys make sure of something. &gt;&gt; Do not touch anything. Do not destroy anything until Lot is up. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. That's after communion. &gt;&gt; That's the attitude of communion. When you have communion with God, when you realize who you are, you realize that you can go before the throne of mercy and beg for mercy, not for yourself. Because in the book is already WRITTEN ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW YOU MADE [screaming] IT. &gt;&gt; YOU ALREADY MADE IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOU. JUST KEEP GOING. KEEP ASKING FOR MERCY FOR YOUR LOVED ONES. THE THE ONES THAT YOU DON'T SEE HERE, the ones that you know they're away FROM THE LORD, ASK for them. BEG THE LORD FOR THEM TO BRING THEM IN. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and verse 16. And while he linger, the men laid hold upon him, his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, the Lord being merciful unto him, and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. Hallelujah. And it came to pass when they had brought him them for abroad that he said, "Escape for thy life. Look no behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain. Escape to the mountains lest thou be consumed. Amen. Why? Hallelujah. He said, you you you you go, you run. Run for your life. Run for your life. Why? Why? The angel said, because I can do nothing. If you keep reading, the angel said, I cannot do anything until you get out of here. and and uh just to to finish brother says uh says and the angel said that morning to Lord after he had given the message he said hasten come he hither for I can do nothing till you has come hither. I want you to notice this because we have cut short here on account of the prayer line. Do you notice what the angel said? I can't do nothing till you come hither. What was it? It was a message of deliverance. And before one speck of fire could fall from heaven, Lot had to get out of Sodom. And I hear that and then I then places Lot in a different level. And I'm like when I heard the the I think there's a message I I don't know if I have the quote right here. Yes. Is the church will the church go before tribulation? Preaching 58. When I heard these one the first time, I stopped the tape because I was like, what did brother Ara just said? You know what I mean? Cuz I was like, brother Ram is placing replacing Lot with Noah and the bride. My God can do anything. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? He he doesn't ask for my opinion, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; He he he saves anybody he wants to save. &gt;&gt; He saves the holiest men &gt;&gt; and the vilest of sinners &gt;&gt; cuz that's my God. &gt;&gt; He's rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And before one drop of rain fell from heaven, Noah went into the ark. And before the atom bomb can strike this nation, the church will go in the rapture to meet the Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The angels are ready. He says, &gt;&gt; "The angels are ready for you and for me. &gt;&gt; There's a homecoming party waiting for us. &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know if you want to make it there, but I want to make it there &gt;&gt; cuz I love parties. I love cake. &gt;&gt; I I love to have communion. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love to have communion with the brothers and talk about Jesus and talk about this glorious message and talk about my Lord cuz brother Brown says he likes us to boast about him. &gt;&gt; When you speak about him, he makes himself present. &gt;&gt; When you speak about him, he shows up. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? So do not give up. &gt;&gt; Do not give up. Do not give up. &gt;&gt; Number one. Number two, &gt;&gt; do not give up for your children. &gt;&gt; Pray for your children. It doesn't matter if they're away. It doesn't matter if they're in drugs, if they're out there in an alley. God can bring them FROM ANYWHERE. CUZ GOD SENT his angels to bring LOT OUT OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH. He can do anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says God had a need to go to Samaria. &gt;&gt; Jesus had a need to GO TO SAMARIA. WHY? Because there was a little woman there waiting for him. Nobody wanted to have anything to do with that woman because she had an ill fame. &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew that in THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN ABOUT HER. [laughter] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IN THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN ABOUT HER. And he had a NEED TO GO INTO THAT LITTLE TOWN. WHY? BECAUSE THERE WAS A predestinated seed that WAS GOING TO SPRING UP ONCE THE RIVERS OF ETERNAL LIFE FLOW THROUGH HER. AND BROTHER and sister, THE RIVERS OF ETERNAL LIFE [screaming] ARE FLOWING THROUGH US. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; MAYBE MAYBE RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU SEE ME, you don't really see any any leaves on me. You know what I mean? Maybe I'm just you see just the the little branches there and they look like they're dried up. But don't worry, they're not dried up. The waters of life are PASSING THROUGH. THE SAP IS ABOUT TO COME UP. I'M ABOUT TO GIVE FRUIT. Every believer is ABOUT TO GIVE FRUIT BECAUSE THE WAR OF GOD spoke about it. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter what the devil tells you. It doesn't matter what THE DEVIL TELLS ME. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SERGIO SAYS. ONLY MATTERS WHAT HIS word says. &gt;&gt; Let us stand up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am an emotional person. &gt;&gt; Some people are not emotional. That's all right. That's the way God made you. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? [snorts] Some people never leave lift their hands, &gt;&gt; never clap. It's all right. Don't worry. One of these days, you're going to raise your hands &gt;&gt; and you're going to clap &gt;&gt; and you're going to cry. &gt;&gt; You don't know why, but all of a sudden, you're going to feel a fire in your belly, and your chest, &gt;&gt; and you're going to be like, "Oh, what is this? Oh, I don't know what is it, brother, but it feels good." And you're going to feel forgiven. And you're going to feel a load lift up from you. And brother, that day, that day, you're going to scream and shout. That day, the brother's going to be like, "Calm down. What's wrong with you?" NO. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going on in here. &gt;&gt; I was lost. I WAS HEAVY LADEN. I COULDN'T EVEN RAISE MY HAND. BUT NOW I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN FORGIVEN. I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN PREDESTINATED. I KNOW THAT IN THE BOOK IS WRITTEN ABOUT ME. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I KNOW THAT I WILL MAKE IT. &gt;&gt; Father God, we thank you for your word, Lord. We thank you for your presence among us, Lord. Father God, Father, if I said anything contrary to your word, Lord, may not be placed in in the believer's hearts, Lord. Father God, but my my my my uh I like to encourage them, Lord, to to to for them to continue to move forward, Father God. Father, we are your children. We were predestinated before the foundation of the world, Father. The blood of Jesus Christ bought us. We were purchased with a with a payment of blood, Father God. And we thank you for that, Lord. Father, bless each one of your children this place, Lord. If anyone is was thinking about giving up, Lord, help them not to give up. Help them to continue to move forward, Lord. Father God, if anyone is praying for their children, Lord, praying for their loved ones, praying for their wife, their husband, praying, Father God, for their parents, for their siblings, Lord, Father God, I pray that you help them to believe. I pray that they be like Abraham and keep asking for mercy, for mercy, for mercy until until that manifestation comes, Lord, and their children and their loved ones and their spouses and their siblings come to you, Lord, because there is nothing impossible with you, Father God. And you gave us a word, a word of salvation, Lord. And we are the bride of Jesus Christ, Father God. If there is a queen in heaven, Lord, it's the bride of Jesus Christ. And that queen can speak to the king and the king will grant her desires for she only speaks while the king speaks. The spirit and the bride say come. They speak the same thing. Lord help us father God and bless us Lord. Bless us tonight Lord. We thank you for everything you've done for us in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. My my man, I didn't know brother Serg was a ball of fire, &gt;&gt; but I certainly appreciate that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's what the word does to you. You know, when God moves in your heart, you can't help but express it. You know what I mean? Amen. I so appreciate that. He he said one thing that really touched me tonight and and I just want to say before we move to communion. You know it's it's when you have fellowship that you have the ability to intercede for others. &gt;&gt; It it's within the fellowship the communion you can sit there. It was after the communion that Abraham could sit there and start talking about Lot. And I believe us that are gathered here we we have that communion with him. And I believe we can uh uh look out to those that of of your family members and of the church bodies and we can certainly inc I I realize if you don't have relationship it's hard for you to ask but if you know you can come and in the sea then you know father I I I know you love me like Jesus would say I know you hear me but I'm not asking for myself but I'm asking for these that are standing here. Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles to our uh scripture of uh communion tonight. Certainly, God bless brother Sergio. I certainly enjoy that. Amen. uh communion scripture uh 1 Corinthians 11:23 [snorts] said for I have received of the Lord that which I have delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you Please do in remembrance of me. And after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testimony in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till it comes. Wherefore whatsoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup uh this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let every man examine himself, so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For eat for he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sick among you and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. When we are judged, we are chasteed enough the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tar one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation, and the the rest will I said in order when I come. Amen. Let's just pray over the bread and the wine. Our gracious father, we can certainly sir within our hearts that this has been a special day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Father, you you spoke to us. You open our hearts and our mind, Lord, to see your word that what we do even in communion, Father, the true forgiving and the true communion are happen with the revelation that you've given us. And father we pray even as we pray for this bread and this wine which is just a symbolism of what you have done father as we eat of this body your prophet said that there's healing and communion lord and father we would remember our pastor and sister Leslie even right now and say father that you would touch the bodies and heal them oh god &gt;&gt; father we understand that it's within the communion that we have with you that we can even intercede for others the word was not given for us to keep it for ourselves, but to share it with those that are lost. And I need you, Lord. Take this bread, Lord, and let it become a word, Father, part of us, that we may become one with you in taking it, Lord. And and of the wine, Father, let it be the representation of that stimulation of revelation, Lord. And which is the very bloodline of what we heard today that Father, you took away our sins and everything that we had done, all the wrong that you have we had done. Lord, you washed it away. You gave us a clean slate and you brought us right back into the beginning in the image of what you had worked on. [snorts] We're so privileged people, Lord. And we ask that as we take it, Lord, Father, let our revelation grow in you, Lord. And let us be renewed, Father, in you to know that everything is done, oh God. We remember those that couldn't be here, Father. Remember to be with them where they are, Father. May you give them the opportunities, Lord God, that they may be assembled with us the next time. We commit everything to you and we pray one for another. Father, if we've done anything that's not pleasing to you, let the blood of your son wash us of all uncleanness. Father, like the scripture says that we may not come together for condemnation, but we may come to rejoice and be one with you for what you have done. We love you and we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. May have your seats. Amen. And you may come when you're ready.

John chapter 13 says, "Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come and that he should depart out of this world unto the father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end." And supper being ended, the devil having put into the heart of Judas his Scariot Simon's son to betray him. Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things unto his hand, and that he was come from God, and went to God, he raised from supper, and laid aside his garment, and took a towel, and girded himself. And after he had poured water into the basin, he began to wash his disciples feet, and wiped them with the towel which wherewith it was gathered with. went. Then he came to Simon Peter, and Peter said unto him, Lord, thou thou wash my feet. Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter said unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, that has no part with me. Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but my hands and my head. Jesus said to him, "He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is cleaned every width. And ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore he said, Ye are not all clean." So after he had washed the disciples feet, and taken his garment, and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you, ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also are to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example that you should also do as I have done unto you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than he than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than him that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the gospel was given for. Whatever is given to us that we may go and share with others. Amen. God bless you as the sisters go to the place and we'll meet after the footwashing. Amen.
