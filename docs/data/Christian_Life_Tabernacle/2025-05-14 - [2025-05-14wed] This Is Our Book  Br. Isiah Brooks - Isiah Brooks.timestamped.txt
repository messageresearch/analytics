[6:05] Man, it's all standing in there.
[6:11] [Music]
[6:14] When I look into your
[6:17] [Music]
[6:20] holyness, when I gaz into your
[6:27] loveliness, when all things that
[6:31] surround, become shadows in the light of
[6:37] you.
[6:42] When I found the joy of reaching your
[6:49] heart, when my will becomes enthroned in
[6:53] your
[6:55] love, and when all things pass around,
[7:00] become shadows in the
[7:04] light of you.
[7:09] Oh, I worship
[7:14] [Music]
[7:17] you. I worship

[7:45] you. I worship
[7:54] you. The reason I
[7:59] live is to
[8:01] worship you. Just sing it again tonight.
[8:07] Oh, when I look into your
[8:15] holiness, when I gaze into your
[8:22] loveliness, and when all things that
[8:26] surround, become shadows in the light of
[8:31] you.
[8:35] Oh, when I found the joy of reaching
[8:41] your
[8:44] heart, when my will becomes enthroned in
[8:49] your
[8:51] love, and when all things that
[8:55] surround become shadows in the light of
[9:00] you.
[9:05] Oh, and I worship
[9:12] you. I worship
[9:20] you. The reason I
[9:24] live, oh, and is to

[9:40] you. I worship
[9:49] you. The reason I
[9:53] live, oh, and is to
[9:56] worship
[9:58] you. Amen.
[10:01] Amen. Amen. I trust that's a very even
[10:05] the motive where we gather here. Amen.
[10:07] Is to worship him with our lives with
[10:10] everything that we are that he may
[10:12] receive all the worship. But Jeromy, if
[10:14] we could just come and open our service
[10:16] in prayer.
[10:24] Amen.
[10:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. I was just
[10:28] sitting there praying. And I said, "Hope
[10:29] Brother Billy don't call
[10:31] me." But I had one of those days, you
[10:34] know, when you wake up and everything
[10:37] goes wrong. But I'm here. And GI Joe
[10:42] said, "Being here is half the battle,
[10:44] right?" Amen. Let's look to God in
[10:46] prayer. Heavenly Father, we praise you
[10:48] and we magnify your name. Lord God, we
[10:51] thank you for today, Lord God, and for
[10:55] all that we go through, the trials and
[10:56] the tribulations of this life, Lord God.
[10:59] But we know that in you, in this place,
[11:04] there is a resting place, Lord God. That
[11:07] we can hide ourselves in the cleft of
[11:09] the rock, Lord God, and you would give
[11:11] us comfort and peace, Lord God. We pray
[11:15] tonight, Lord God, for that still small
[11:17] voice, Lord God, that you would speak a
[11:20] word through the man of God that would
[11:22] encourage us and lift up our spirits and
[11:25] give us the ability to face another day,
[11:28] Lord God. Our souls are thirsty, Lord
[11:31] God. We've been beaten down by the cares
[11:33] of this world, Lord God. But we know
[11:35] that in you there is hope and there is
[11:39] freedom and there is life and there is
[11:41] liberty, Lord God. Even when we drove on
[11:45] the parking lot, Lord God, it just
[11:47] seemed like things began to change. Lord
[11:50] God, you said wherever two or three are
[11:52] gathered in your name that you would be
[11:53] found in the midst. We continue to
[11:56] praise you and to magnify your name. We
[11:58] lift you up. We exalt you and we expect
[12:01] to hear a word from heaven tonight. Lord
[12:03] God, we pray that you would lift every
[12:06] heavy burden. Lord God, you told us in
[12:08] your word to cast all of our cares upon
[12:11] you for you carth for us. For it's in
[12:14] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[12:19] Amen. Amen. So good to be gather in the
[12:22] house of God. And we want to welcome all
[12:24] of our visitors. Everyone you could turn
[12:26] around and welcome someone tonight in
[12:28] the presence of the Lord. Amen.
[12:39] Amen. May I have your seats? A
[12:43] flat. Oh, G
[12:49] G. Some folks are building hopes down
[12:53] here. The
[12:55] planet. Hey, so busy with her fortunes.
[12:59] They forgot what Jesus
[13:03] said about the walls of earthquakes and
[13:07] the fig tree lives. Oh, but there's a
[13:11] group of people getting

[25:44] saving
[25:46] grace, when we stand before the
[25:51] throne, when we finally made it
[25:55] home, all the pieces will fall into
[26:03] place. All my questions will be gone.
[26:08] As my sorrow turns to

[32:23] what the Lord does for

[32:30] heads. Lord, we do thank you for all
[32:33] that you've done,
[32:35] Lord. and all that you're doing, all
[32:37] that you're going to do. Lord, we see
[32:40] the the sign of the
[32:43] times. Lord, it's like the curtain has
[32:46] been drawn
[32:48] back on the final act of
[32:51] mankind. Lord, all the pieces are in
[32:54] place. The bride is making herself
[32:58] ready. You've adorned her, Lord, in a in
[33:01] a way
[33:03] that she's never been before.
[33:06] So we pray Lord that there be anything
[33:09] in our lives
[33:10] that's unfitting Lord that you'd make it
[33:15] right. Lord the many needs have been
[33:17] read the blessings and answered prayer
[33:21] that have been spoken. Lord these will
[33:24] continue to go on as these old vile
[33:27] bodies are on this
[33:30] side. Lord we thank you for meeting all
[33:33] these needs. Lord, we place the needs
[33:35] upon the altar tonight and have faith
[33:37] believe that you're more than able,
[33:40] Lord, to answer each request, Lord, to
[33:42] our hearts content, to the fullest
[33:45] extent, Lord, beyond our even
[33:50] expectations. But Lord, we have a deeper
[33:54] desire, as Paul taught the Corinthians
[33:57] that there's a body celestial and
[34:01] there's a body terrestrial.
[34:07] Lord, we we live in these walls of
[34:10] flesh, but we want to exhibit, Lord, the
[34:13] celestial. We want the
[34:15] glory, Lord, as you said, as Paul said
[34:19] again, that you would change these old
[34:21] vile bodies unto your glorious body.
[34:25] Grant it, Lord, even as we live here on
[34:26] this side, Lord, that we can we can show
[34:29] this dying world that truly you're still
[34:32] alive, Lord. For you inhabit these
[34:35] little frail bodies, these human beings,
[34:37] Lord. You've seen fit to clean us up,
[34:40] come down in a way, Lord, that we can
[34:43] walk up right before you. We can bring
[34:45] our needs before you. We can gather
[34:47] together and be blessed by the presence
[34:50] of the Lord in our midst. Because as
[34:52] we've been taught, Lord, we bring you
[34:53] with us. We grant, Lord, that as we
[34:56] fellowship tonight, Lord, as we gather
[34:58] together, hear the preaching of the
[34:59] word, that Lord, as we lift up our
[35:03] voices in song and praise, adoration,
[35:06] and
[35:08] amens, Lord, that you just give us a
[35:11] warmth and overcoming blessing, Lord,
[35:13] for having been in the house of the Lord
[35:15] tonight. that when we leave here, we can
[35:17] say
[35:18] truly we're different when we leave this
[35:20] place. Grant it to us now. Pray, Lord,
[35:24] as we lift you up. And we ask all these
[35:26] things in the lovely name of the Lord
[35:28] Jesus Christ.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:38] Amen. Oh, and you don't have to worry.
[35:46] And don't you be
[35:52] afraid. Joy comes in the
[35:57] morning.
[35:59] Troules don't pass our
[36:02] [Music]
[36:03] way. Oh for there's a friend in Jesus.
[36:11] Oh, wipe your tears
[36:16] away. Oh, and if your heart is
[36:22] broken, just lift your hands and
[36:28] sing. Oh, and I know that I can make it.
[36:35] Oh, and I know that I can
[36:41] stand no matter what may come my
[36:48] way. My life is in your
[36:53] hand. Oh, and with Jesus I can take it.
[37:00] Oh, and with him I know I can
[37:06] stand. No matter what may come my
[37:13] way, my life is in your
[37:18] hands. Oh, and so when you're
[37:22] tested
[37:24] trial, oh, and they seem to care to
[37:31] them. And all your friends and
[37:36] love, we
[37:39] are. Hallelujah.
[37:43] Oh, and remember there's a friend. He's
[37:48] always present. Oh, and he will hide.
[37:55] Hallelujah. Oh, and if your heart is
[38:01] broken, oh, and just lift your hand and
[38:07] say, "Oh, and I know that I can make it.

[42:32] Amen. Heavenly
[42:34] Father, they're not words in a
[42:36] vocabulary
[42:38] to
[42:39] express your greatness.
[42:43] There's not minds on the earth to
[42:45] comprehend
[42:46] it. Father, you placed a portion of the
[42:50] kingdom within us so we couldn't even
[42:52] find the beginning or the end of
[42:55] it. But Father, we're thankful that you
[42:58] choose to incline our ears to hear your
[43:02] word. that you tugged on our hearts,
[43:06] Father,
[43:08] and beckoned us to
[43:11] come and that you promised that if you
[43:15] started a work in us that you would
[43:17] finish it and that nothing could pluck
[43:20] us out of the palm of your
[43:23] hand. That your sheep would hear your
[43:26] voice and another they would not follow.
[43:30] Father, we've heard your voice in this
[43:33] day. be vindicated and
[43:35] clear. And we responded, Father, like
[43:38] the little eagllet in the chicken pin.
[43:42] And now, Father, we ask that you would
[43:44] allow us this evening to set our wings
[43:48] and even rise higher than we've ever had
[43:51] the opportunity to rise before. Father,
[43:55] we want to leave those things which are
[43:57] behind behind and press for a higher
[44:00] calling. We ask it this evening in Jesus
[44:04] precious name we pray. Amen. And amen.
[44:08] God bless. You may be seated this
[44:09] evening. Certainly nice to be in the
[44:12] house of the Lord and you guys just need
[44:15] to stay for a little bit because we'll
[44:18] probably sing some more. Anyway, I I
[44:21] want to make a couple announcements. Um
[44:24] if it would be all right. Uh, next
[44:26] Sunday morning after service, I'd like
[44:30] to meet with all the
[44:33] musicians. So, if you play an
[44:35] instrument, piano, organ,
[44:38] guitar, anything but a drum
[44:41] set, we'd like to meet you. We'd like to
[44:45] get to know you, and we'd like to use
[44:47] you. So, this isn't a meeting for
[44:51] uh people that are are our musicians.
[44:55] It's a meeting for if you are a
[44:59] musician. So like if I was to have a
[45:02] meeting for
[45:04] Christians, I would expect you all to be
[45:08] there. So if you're a musician, I don't
[45:10] know that you are. You you may be one of
[45:14] the greatest. I heard a brother the
[45:16] other day playing for uh on a special
[45:19] and I thought, well, who's that brother?
[45:20] He really plays wonderful. And so we we
[45:24] want to uh get to know you, use you, and
[45:28] place you in. So uh and also I want to
[45:31] have a breakfast uh this in a month or
[45:34] so uh with all the brothers that feel
[45:38] that they have a call in their life uh
[45:42] to preach or feel like they have a call
[45:45] or have a call. And whether you preach
[45:48] for us here or not, uh the scripture
[45:51] says to know those that labor among you.
[45:54] I think that's first
[45:56] Thessalonians 5 and12. And uh so we want
[46:00] to do that. And so uh we just, you know,
[46:06] uh want you to come together. We'll have
[46:09] a breakfast and we'd like all that are a
[46:11] minister, even if you feel you got a
[46:13] call. I don't care how old you are. you
[46:16] say, you know, I just feel I got in my
[46:17] life. I want to serve God. Uh we really
[46:20] want to meet with you and because we
[46:22] want to work together. Uh we don't have
[46:26] any big eyes or little U's. Uh we just
[46:30] want the word of God even if it comes
[46:33] from a donkey, right? We want the word
[46:34] of God. And uh so if if you've got a
[46:38] call, we just we want you to know that
[46:41] we're not closed. Uh, we're open for
[46:44] whatever the Lord will have. I I know
[46:49] it's Becky and I I know you, brother. I
[46:51] forgot your first name. Mark. Mark.
[46:54] Okay. I should have known that. One of
[46:56] the great writers of the Bible sitting
[46:58] right here, brother Mark. So, we're
[47:02] happy and to have you with us uh
[47:06] tonight. So, Lord, richly bless you. We
[47:09] also have a special treat tonight uh
[47:11] with us, Brother Isaiah Brooks, uh
[47:14] passing through town. And uh I didn't
[47:16] ask him to sing. I said, I'm not going
[47:18] to ask Brother Isaiah to sing because,
[47:21] you know, I want him to be identified as
[47:24] a minister, not as a singer. You know
[47:27] what I mean? So I said, I'm not going to
[47:29] touch with his identity, but if he wants
[47:32] to sing, that's up to him. You You know
[47:35] what I mean? Now I want to sing, but I
[47:39] can't. But you know, so you know how I
[47:42] feel about preachers that can preach and
[47:44] sing. You you know what I mean? I I
[47:47] think they have a lower place in heaven
[47:50] than us who have to labor on our
[47:53] preaching alone. So I don't have two
[47:55] ways to bless, you know, but some people
[47:58] just got two ways to bless your soul.
[48:00] And so, uh, I I told Brother Isaiah
[48:03] Brooks, you know, he's kind of he kind
[48:06] of went off the scene a little bit. And
[48:08] I said, "Well, I just feel maybe this is
[48:10] your emergence back into back into the
[48:14] the life and battle of us here on the
[48:18] field." So, we're happy you're waring
[48:20] with us here this evening. So, why don't
[48:22] you come, Brother Isaiah, and and uh
[48:28] uh and we'd like to welcome you and and
[48:32] uh here to our place. Brother Isaiah's
[48:34] preached for us before, but he told me
[48:37] the other day, uh it's been 15 years
[48:40] since he's been in the pulpit. You know,
[48:43] he doesn't look a day younger in 15
[48:45] years. So, it it's really it's really
[48:48] nice to have you. Glad to be here. So we
[48:50] have a saying without fear without
[48:53] favor. Amen. All right. God bless you my
[48:55] brother. You too. Thank you sir. Feel
[48:58] glad as you do.
[49:00] Amen. Well I always bring my tambourine
[49:03] wherever I go just in case. Uh by God's
[49:08] grace
[49:09] um if we need it we'll use it. But if
[49:13] you could just give me a key of C. I
[49:14] think that's the key. ing
[49:18] it.
[49:19] Pictures and
[49:23] photographs,
[49:24] memories of
[49:29] old,
[49:30] stories of every kind that have never
[49:36] yet been
[49:37] told. And there's a picture in my
[49:43] kitchen that displays the supper
[49:49] scene. A picture that's been hanging
[49:55] that until now I had never seen.
[50:00] [Music]
[50:02] How can he
[50:05] desire to have
[50:08] fellowship with
[50:10] me? There must be something more within
[50:17] that only he can
[50:21] see. I pray dear Lord please take my
[50:26] life. I give it all to thee.
[50:33] Granted
[50:34] every
[50:37] day you come in with
[50:43] [Music]
[50:45] me on the road to
[50:50] Emus. Three men walk that
[50:55] way. As they reached their
[50:59] destination, the two men beg the third
[51:03] to
[51:05] stay. And as they talk
[51:10] together, breaking bread and pouring
[51:15] wine, I
[51:17] finally now
[51:20] realize the simplicity of his eyes.
[51:27] How can he
[51:29] desire to have
[51:32] fellowship with me? There must be
[51:37] something more within that only he can
[51:44] see. I pray Lord please take my life. I

[52:17] There must be something more within that
[52:23] only he can see. I prayed, Lord, please
[52:31] take my life. I give it all to thee.
[52:41] Grant that
[52:42] every
[52:45] day you commune with me. Tell me how can
[52:51] he
[52:54] desire to have
[52:56] fellowship with me. There must be some
[53:03] more within that only he can see. I pray
[53:11] Lord please take my life I give it all
[53:17] to
[53:21] thee. Grant that every
[53:26] day you
[53:29] come with me.

[53:37] day you

[59:23] in me. He's in my heart.
[59:27] Hallelujah. As we stand, we want to give
[59:30] honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus
[59:33] Christ.
[59:34] And we thank God for uh Pastor McGary. I
[59:39] had no idea it had been 15 years ago
[59:42] since I last been here, but uh I was
[59:46] reminded that it had been so so long or
[59:50] such a long time uh by his wife, which I
[59:54] appreciate, and I was kind of on the
[59:55] shock side, but when you get
[59:59] busy, you know, that's the way it is.
[1:00:03] And by the grace of God, those of you
[1:00:04] who don't know me, I'm Isaiah Brooks. By
[1:00:07] the grace of God, I brought my lovely
[1:00:10] wife with me,
[1:00:11] Ruby. She's in the back. My grandson,
[1:00:16] Judah, so he is with us as
[1:00:19] well. And we just thank the
[1:00:22] Lord for
[1:00:24] all he's doing and has done.
[1:00:28] As we stand, let us turn to Revelations
[1:00:36] 22 19-
[1:00:54] 21. Hallelujah.
[1:00:57] are you there?
[1:01:00] We just thank God for the McGary family
[1:01:03] as a whole. They have
[1:01:05] always loved me and I appreciate that.
[1:01:08] Even the family here, those of you who
[1:01:10] remember me, we thank God for your
[1:01:13] prayers and uh your ever support in
[1:01:17] prayer. Amen. So, let's read Revelations
[1:01:20] 22:19-21.
[1:01:23] And if it man shall take away from the
[1:01:25] words of the book of this prophecy, God
[1:01:29] shall take away his part out of the book
[1:01:31] of life, and out of the holy city, and
[1:01:34] from the things which are written in
[1:01:36] this book. He which testify these
[1:01:39] things, say, Surely I come quickly.
[1:01:42] Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. The
[1:01:47] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[1:01:50] you all.
[1:01:53] Amen. One more scripture and then I have
[1:01:56] you
[1:01:58] seated. God is so good to
[1:02:01] us. Second
[1:02:03] Corinthians the third
[1:02:07] chapter. I'm not a deep preacher. I just
[1:02:10] preach what he wants me to
[1:02:14] preach. Many people aim for the head. I
[1:02:17] aim for your heart.
[1:02:21] 2 Corinthians
[1:02:23] 3
[1:02:25] 2-3. Ye are our
[1:02:29] epistles written in our hearts, known
[1:02:33] and read of all men. For as much as ye
[1:02:37] are manifestly declared to be the
[1:02:40] epistles of
[1:02:41] Christ, ministered by us, written not
[1:02:45] with ink, but with the spirit of the
[1:02:48] living God, not in tables of stone, but
[1:02:52] in fleshly tables of the heart. Amen. I
[1:02:56] I did say one more, but let me give you
[1:02:58] one more scripture, please. Revelations
[1:03:00] 19:7-10.
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:17] Let us be glad and
[1:03:19] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:03:21] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[1:03:25] wife hath made herself
[1:03:27] ready. And to her was
[1:03:30] granted that she would be arrayed. in
[1:03:33] fine linen clinging and white for the
[1:03:36] fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:03:39] saints. And he said that to me, write,
[1:03:43] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:03:45] the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he
[1:03:48] said unto me, these are the true sayings
[1:03:50] of God. And I fell at his feet to
[1:03:53] worship him. And he said unto me, See,
[1:03:56] thou doeth not. I am thy fellow servant
[1:04:00] of thy brethren that have the testimony
[1:04:02] of Jesus Christ. Worship God for the
[1:04:06] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:04:09] prophecy. Let us
[1:04:11] pray. Our heavenly father God, we come
[1:04:13] before you Lord as humbly as we know
[1:04:15] how. We thank you for being so good to
[1:04:18] us. We thank you father for all that
[1:04:21] you've done for us. Lord, we surrender
[1:04:23] to you tonight. We submit our lives to
[1:04:26] you. We submit our thoughts. We submit
[1:04:29] our being to you. My body, soul, and
[1:04:31] spirit. And Lord, tonight, I don't
[1:04:34] believe in chance. I believe in that
[1:04:37] everything is controlled by you,
[1:04:40] predestinated by you. And Father, I pray
[1:04:43] Lord God that you'll bless the people.
[1:04:46] You know what they need. I do not. But I
[1:04:50] pray that you would minister to the
[1:04:51] hearts of the people that when we leave
[1:04:54] this place, our faith would have would
[1:04:56] have increased in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:04:59] Bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:05:02] pray. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:05:10] By the grace of God, I am here to
[1:05:14] uh not only be a testimony but a witness
[1:05:17] of God's divine
[1:05:22] love. I was telling my church, you know,
[1:05:25] before leaving, I wasn't always this
[1:05:29] way. I was a
[1:05:31] sinner, very wretched.
[1:05:35] I'm not going to go into details, but my
[1:05:37] my whole point is if there be a change
[1:05:40] in
[1:05:41] me, it's because he made the change.
[1:05:46] In the course of my life, I have
[1:05:49] seen the world
[1:05:52] change, the church
[1:05:55] change, and I have seen people who
[1:05:58] have
[1:06:01] developed a systematic
[1:06:05] worship and they think that's the Holy
[1:06:07] Ghost.
[1:06:11] But as I hear brother Brandham
[1:06:14] teachings, when a man received the Holy
[1:06:17] Ghost, he also dece receive divine love
[1:06:22] and
[1:06:24] power. I know for certain this is not
[1:06:27] the hour to be distracted.
[1:06:32] We have
[1:06:33] seen how many
[1:06:37] people are losing sight of who they
[1:06:40] really
[1:06:40] are. This is a time to
[1:06:44] focus. But I told my church, I said, "If
[1:06:47] you don't understand
[1:06:49] grace, you'll never come to the
[1:06:51] perfection God wants you to come to.
[1:06:55] It's not him that willth, nor he that
[1:06:58] runth, but it's God that shows mercy.
[1:07:04] I would entitle this message,
[1:07:09] this is our book.
[1:07:14] The world has all kinds of books.
[1:07:18] But this one,
[1:07:20] God designed it, fashioned it for us.
[1:07:27] It is the thing that we become.
[1:07:31] Oh, come on. Don't Don't be shy.
[1:07:35] Did not John,
[1:07:39] the angel told John eat the book?
[1:07:43] And we had a prophet
[1:07:47] that did not start in just the middle of
[1:07:50] the book,
[1:07:52] but he took us from the alpha
[1:07:56] and brought us to the omega.
[1:07:59] Right.
[1:08:01] And it's amazing cuz like I was in my
[1:08:06] kitchen and I don't know whether God
[1:08:09] talks to you but he does to
[1:08:11] me. All I know is that I heard a voice
[1:08:14] said this book. You are this book. Now
[1:08:18] that was some heavy meat. But I was in
[1:08:20] the
[1:08:22] kitchen and that was the proper place to
[1:08:24] talk to me with too. So let me say it
[1:08:28] like this. When God said that to me, I'm
[1:08:30] talking about believers.
[1:08:33] But is it not true?
[1:08:35] Whatever he is,
[1:08:38] you are.
[1:08:40] That's right.
[1:08:42] We
[1:08:44] are the only generation. Can I say it
[1:08:48] like this? Brother Brandham said it like
[1:08:49] this. This bride
[1:08:52] will not fall.
[1:08:55] All of the others have failed,
[1:08:59] but this bride is riding on grace. Oh,
[1:09:04] somebody help me here.
[1:09:07] Think about it. The devil has done
[1:09:10] everything he could can
[1:09:13] do to strip us of the reverence
[1:09:18] of this Bible.
[1:09:20] I remember a time you couldn't even
[1:09:23] catch a
[1:09:24] Christian without a Bible.
[1:09:28] Oo. Especially when it comes to church.
[1:09:34] It's amazing in a time
[1:09:37] where technology is booming.
[1:09:42] But you and I, we're in a different
[1:09:44] dimension. If I could say like, can I
[1:09:46] say it that way?
[1:09:48] The message, the
[1:09:49] word has placed us in a place what we
[1:09:53] call heavenly places
[1:09:56] in Christ Jesus.
[1:09:59] It's nothing that we have done.
[1:10:02] It's all about him.
[1:10:07] I can't tell you how many
[1:10:10] years I tried perfecting myself.
[1:10:15] Can I get a witness?
[1:10:19] And you fall every time
[1:10:23] and every time you think you got it all
[1:10:25] together,
[1:10:28] the devil sidekick you.
[1:10:31] Y'all hear me? But thank God cuz there
[1:10:35] was something God gave me
[1:10:38] that would pick me up
[1:10:41] every time I fall. Did y'all hear me? I
[1:10:45] didn't pick myself up. He picked me up.
[1:10:50] Hallelujah.
[1:10:52] When you know that you know that you
[1:10:54] know
[1:10:56] that you're the seed of God,
[1:10:58] you can't explain it, but you know that
[1:11:02] you are. Hallelujah. I was telling a
[1:11:05] brother the other day, I said, you know,
[1:11:07] something about us that is different
[1:11:09] from the church
[1:11:11] world. Brother Random talks about
[1:11:13] vibrations.
[1:11:15] I call it a frequency.
[1:11:18] You understand me? Because we are on a
[1:11:21] different frequency.
[1:11:24] And and and and we can hear him.
[1:11:27] Did y'all hear me? We can hear his voice
[1:11:32] when nobody else can hear it.
[1:11:34] Hallelujah. So when you are in tune with
[1:11:38] God, uh put it this way, when you have
[1:11:40] connected with the very source. Now, I I
[1:11:43] was talking with your pastor, and I'm
[1:11:44] agree with him on this for sure. You and
[1:11:47] I would have never known the channel
[1:11:50] had it not been for Malachi 4.
[1:11:54] We would have never known
[1:11:57] that God of the Old Testament
[1:12:01] is Jesus Christ of the New. And when I
[1:12:04] say these things, I'm not I'm not trying
[1:12:06] to tickle your ear. I'm talking about
[1:12:07] this is a reality
[1:12:10] that you must know. Cuz see, you become
[1:12:13] invincible.
[1:12:18] When we think
[1:12:20] about this
[1:12:22] book called the Bible, I'll say it like
[1:12:25] this is
[1:12:27] sacred. Every
[1:12:29] word is sacred.
[1:12:32] And sacred it means to is consecrated
[1:12:36] for a specific purpose. We're the only
[1:12:40] age
[1:12:42] that have had the full book.
[1:12:45] The whole book,
[1:12:47] not some part of the letter. Oh my God.
[1:12:50] But the whole book,
[1:12:54] and
[1:12:55] therefore, this book is going to bring
[1:12:58] forth such a creation
[1:13:02] that has never been before.
[1:13:04] Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:13:06] I I try to tell people I said listen you
[1:13:09] can't get this message earthbound
[1:13:13] God told John come up
[1:13:17] you got to go up sir hallelujah in order
[1:13:22] to understand what Jesus is saying what
[1:13:25] he's trying to get us to see
[1:13:29] it's a
[1:13:30] daily humbling yourself
[1:13:34] I don't care what it takes
[1:13:38] Perfection has been appointed to me.
[1:13:42] Perfection
[1:13:44] has been appointed to you.
[1:13:47] Now, we look at this and I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:13:49] trying to say
[1:13:51] something because until we get back to
[1:13:54] the reverence,
[1:13:56] y'all understand me? When we first came
[1:13:59] to this message, we'd listen to those
[1:14:01] tapes day in and day out. Come on,
[1:14:03] brother.
[1:14:05] We would talk about it for hours.
[1:14:08] Anybody know what I'm talking about?
[1:14:11] Now, when you go into a believer's home,
[1:14:13] you can't hardly hear it anymore.
[1:14:16] I'm not trying to rebuke you. I'm just
[1:14:19] trying to make sure make you see Satan
[1:14:22] is slow walking some of us.
[1:14:26] Hallelujah. And you and I must
[1:14:28] understand Jesus uh we understood that
[1:14:32] this is his
[1:14:33] prayer. Give us this
[1:14:37] day our monthly bread.
[1:14:42] Our daily bread. It is a it is a
[1:14:45] communion. That that's why I always say
[1:14:47] how can he desire
[1:14:50] to have fellowship with me? Anybody else
[1:14:53] feel that way? We know what this is, but
[1:14:58] he looks beyond your faults and he see
[1:15:01] all of your needs.
[1:15:03] Hallelujah. Glory to God. It must become
[1:15:07] reverent to you again. Nobody should
[1:15:10] have ever had to tell us that you need
[1:15:14] to play your tapes.
[1:15:17] I never
[1:15:19] stopped. Y'all understand me? I never
[1:15:22] stopped reading my Bible.
[1:15:25] I never stopped praying. Y'all hear what
[1:15:28] I'm saying?
[1:15:30] This is
[1:15:31] not how can I say it? This book is more
[1:15:35] than you can imagine.
[1:15:39] Hallelujah. The word is God.
[1:15:43] I'm coming to something. Just bear with
[1:15:45] me. By the grace of God, we look and we
[1:15:49] know now that if you click into AI and
[1:15:52] tell them tell AI to give you a message
[1:15:55] for by brother Brandham, it could really
[1:15:57] give you a good
[1:15:58] one. That's what I
[1:16:01] heard. But you you think, "Oh, that's
[1:16:03] crazy."
[1:16:05] No. People without the Holy Ghost, they
[1:16:09] need AI.
[1:16:13] You better hear what I'm saying. It's
[1:16:15] the truth.
[1:16:17] But when God speaks,
[1:16:21] when God speaks to you, you become crazy
[1:16:25] if I would say it.
[1:16:28] I could remember the time when a sister
[1:16:30] would say, you know, the Lord told me
[1:16:32] this and it would be true. Or a brother
[1:16:35] would say, the Lord showed me this and
[1:16:38] it would be true. Hallelujah. The reason
[1:16:41] being we had such a union
[1:16:46] and Jesus even said it in that day
[1:16:51] you'll know that I am in the father the
[1:16:53] father is in me and I am in you. I don't
[1:16:57] know whether we have visitors out there
[1:16:59] but let me tell you something. Being a
[1:17:02] Christian is the greatest thing you
[1:17:04] could ever be.
[1:17:07] Hallelujah. It is something that's given
[1:17:10] to you freely. You don't have to pay for
[1:17:13] it. You don't have to work for it. All
[1:17:16] you got to do is believe it and receive
[1:17:18] it.
[1:17:21] Oh, I'm happy tonight. And I hope you
[1:17:24] are, too. But let me move on by the
[1:17:26] grace of God. Think about how Israel
[1:17:29] once, you know, they they they still do.
[1:17:33] They reverence their scrolls.
[1:17:36] And they don't even have the whole book.
[1:17:41] But we have the whole book, the entire
[1:17:44] word of God. And and let me say it like
[1:17:47] this. We always use that scripture. Let
[1:17:50] this mind be in you that was also in
[1:17:53] Christ Jesus. The mind of God is the
[1:17:57] word of God.
[1:18:00] Hallelujah. In order to have the mind of
[1:18:03] God, you must know his word.
[1:18:07] Oh my God. Yes, sir. Overcomers.
[1:18:12] I don't know when y'all overcame,
[1:18:15] but I'mma tell you my story. I overcame
[1:18:19] before the foundation of the world.
[1:18:23] I'm not struggling.
[1:18:25] I'm not worried. Am I going to make a
[1:18:28] rapture? I'm part of it right now.
[1:18:31] You're part of it right now. If you have
[1:18:35] the Holy Ghost, this thing, we ought to
[1:18:38] be praising God. Coming in church all
[1:18:41] slow and all unhappy. What's wrong with
[1:18:44] you?
[1:18:45] God has given you everything you need.
[1:18:48] Hallelujah.
[1:18:50] And you either believe it or you don't.
[1:18:54] Hallelujah. I believe this. And I love
[1:18:58] the Lord because he he said, "Don't you
[1:19:01] take one thing away from it."
[1:19:04] That means I got full benefits
[1:19:08] of everything he promised me.
[1:19:13] Hallelujah.
[1:19:14] People say, "Well, I've never seen the
[1:19:16] pillar of fire." Well, where's your
[1:19:18] pillar of fire? All right.
[1:19:21] If you if God is in you and he's working
[1:19:24] through you, that is the pillar of fire
[1:19:28] manifesting himself in you. In that day,
[1:19:32] you'll know. Come on. We're the book.
[1:19:36] Hallelujah. It's just not on the pages
[1:19:39] anymore. It's behind that badger skin.
[1:19:43] It's behind human flesh all over again.
[1:19:47] God intend for us to be the walking,
[1:19:50] talking, living Bible
[1:19:54] in our day. I told my church, I said,
[1:19:57] "We need an uprising."
[1:20:02] Yeah. Message
[1:20:04] believers, sitting in your
[1:20:06] corner,
[1:20:08] afraid of wrong.
[1:20:11] Kind of like on the day of Pentecost,
[1:20:13] you know,
[1:20:15] they were hiding.
[1:20:16] But what we need is an uprising.
[1:20:19] We need a refilling
[1:20:22] of the Holy Spirit. Come on, somebody.
[1:20:25] Anybody here is all I won't say as young
[1:20:27] as I young as I
[1:20:31] am. When you when a Christian became a
[1:20:34] Christian, you couldn't shut them up.
[1:20:39] It's the truth. I got young preachers. I
[1:20:42] said, "Hey, I need to see some signs."
[1:20:45] What signs? I need to see some
[1:20:47] witnessing. I need to see some souls
[1:20:49] saved. No, you can't save them, but you
[1:20:53] can at least try.
[1:20:56] Where is the burden for the soul? Oh my
[1:20:58] God. Somebody help me here. We're the
[1:21:02] bride of Christ. And the Bible said the
[1:21:04] spirit and the bride say come.
[1:21:07] Hallelujah. We might as well wake up.
[1:21:14] I look at people and I'm I'm I'm I wear
[1:21:18] myself out, but it's a good wear out. I
[1:21:22] rather, like the brother say, I'd rather
[1:21:23] wear out than rust out.
[1:21:26] But one thing I know, he's still worthy.
[1:21:30] I told you I wasn't deep, but he's
[1:21:33] worthy of our praise.
[1:21:37] And I feel so sorry for the song leader.
[1:21:39] I used to be
[1:21:41] one. You know what I'm saying? Because
[1:21:45] people when it comes to worship, the
[1:21:48] song leader should get one
[1:21:50] song and you shouldn't even let it go
[1:21:52] until the anointing anointing of God
[1:21:54] come down.
[1:21:56] Now y'all looking at me crazy.
[1:21:59] You know, sometime we as song leaders,
[1:22:01] we get the word, we get the songs from
[1:22:02] God. I don't mean I'm going this way cuz
[1:22:04] he's telling me this not my notes. But
[1:22:07] we go this way and and and and we're
[1:22:09] like, you know, you you look like a we
[1:22:13] it's some I remember you you you you
[1:22:16] make the song leader feel like he's a
[1:22:17] failing cheerleader.
[1:22:22] Y'all ever went to the games? Come on
[1:22:25] y'all.
[1:22:32] And no matter what he does,
[1:22:35] some people will never move.
[1:22:40] Hallelujah.
[1:22:42] No. When I was a sinner,
[1:22:45] I was a guy that brought the party.
[1:22:49] Oh yes. And you think I was going to go
[1:22:52] to a club and be a wall? Oh no. If the
[1:22:55] club
[1:22:57] listen, I brought my juice with me.
[1:23:01] Now, I know this sound funny, but I'm
[1:23:02] just I'm not trying to be funny. Look at
[1:23:05] Look, just look around. And every one of
[1:23:08] you should have a lick of fire.
[1:23:12] And what a fire this would be if you
[1:23:15] would release yourself.
[1:23:18] Hallelujah. See, you're caught with
[1:23:20] religion. This ain't about religion.
[1:23:22] This is about salvation.
[1:23:26] Hallelujah. And when you allow God, See,
[1:23:29] that's one thing I love about David.
[1:23:32] He didn't care.
[1:23:35] When the ark of the covenant came back,
[1:23:38] he started dancing.
[1:23:40] Now, it ain't all in the dancing. What
[1:23:43] David had was deeper
[1:23:45] than his religion because he squashed,
[1:23:49] he smashed every part of that Jewish
[1:23:53] Jewish religion
[1:23:55] just by worship.
[1:24:00] Hey, Lord. I got in trouble one time
[1:24:04] because I was at a big gathering and and
[1:24:09] and and and and the the conductor said,
[1:24:13] "Uh, you you can stand up uh you can
[1:24:17] stand up and and and and relax or
[1:24:21] however you say
[1:24:22] it." My righteous ignant
[1:24:25] nation, it got a hold of me. And I got
[1:24:29] up and I got in trouble cuz I said, you
[1:24:33] know, we are the message and now you got
[1:24:36] to tell people when to stand
[1:24:39] up. There's a time you would have to say
[1:24:42] you can be seated.
[1:24:47] Something's
[1:24:48] wrong. Hallelujah. See, I get all
[1:24:51] stirred up. Listen, and yes, people,
[1:24:54] they provoke me.
[1:24:58] Yes, sir. They provoke me to worship.
[1:25:01] When I see people not doing anything, it
[1:25:04] makes me want to move.
[1:25:08] Yeah. I'm not ashamed.
[1:25:10] See, I know what I got is free.
[1:25:14] Y'all know what I'm saying? It's free. I
[1:25:17] don't have to worry about what I did
[1:25:19] before I got here. Hallelujah. I'm free
[1:25:22] and so are you.
[1:25:25] God want to see freedom. Amen. He said,
[1:25:28] "You know that Holy Ghost is like a wind
[1:25:31] when it comes. You don't know where it's
[1:25:34] going and where it come from. But let me
[1:25:37] ask you, h have you ever seen a tree
[1:25:40] that stood still when the wind was
[1:25:43] blowing?
[1:25:45] You couldn't see the wind, but that tree
[1:25:48] was sway. Somebody help me." And
[1:25:51] sometime those little leaves would clap
[1:25:53] their hands.
[1:25:56] Hallelujah. That's the power of the Holy
[1:25:59] Ghost. Yes, it is about the life.
[1:26:03] But my you ought to enjoy it.
[1:26:07] This is not a
[1:26:08] burden. This is liberty.
[1:26:11] Somebody help me here. Oh my. Let me
[1:26:14] share you. I'll share something with you
[1:26:17] coming from the message faith of Abraham
[1:26:20] 1959 0415E.
[1:26:24] uh uh paragraph 72. Now, this may not do
[1:26:28] anything for you, but it would it would
[1:26:31] kill all these religious
[1:26:35] doctrines that say if you don't believe
[1:26:37] when we're here, you're not part of the
[1:26:41] rapture. Y don't get quiet.
[1:26:48] It says, you know, brother B talked
[1:26:50] about that
[1:26:52] donkey. Brother was in bad
[1:26:55] shape. Crosey, not need, you know, he
[1:26:59] was in bad shape and he to concede that
[1:27:02] God would want him. Maybe that's how
[1:27:05] some of you feel tonight.
[1:27:07] Maybe a sinner, somebody out there, you
[1:27:09] feel like may, you know, one of my
[1:27:11] sisters, my natural sister thought she
[1:27:13] had sinned so much she couldn't be
[1:27:15] saved. I told her, "You're the one God's
[1:27:17] looking for." Hallelujah. Is there
[1:27:20] anything too high for God? No sir. No
[1:27:25] sir. Anyway, let me read it. He said
[1:27:28] that that's just about like every one of
[1:27:31] us. But his mother well instructed to
[1:27:35] the word of God. She would say, "Wait a
[1:27:38] minute, honey. I like that. No, no, you
[1:27:42] are born under a birthright.
[1:27:46] When the man of the house comes out, he
[1:27:49] will go to the pastor and hunt the most
[1:27:52] perfect lamb that he's got.
[1:27:55] The high priest will never see you.
[1:27:58] Y'all understand me?
[1:28:02] He will see the lamb. He won't examine
[1:28:05] you. But why do you examine you?
[1:28:11] Let's come up higher here. He whom the
[1:28:14] son is set free is free indeed.
[1:28:18] Hallelujah. I'm free.
[1:28:21] You're free, too. But you got to
[1:28:24] recognize it. Is that right?
[1:28:29] He will see the lamb. He won't examine
[1:28:32] you. He will examine the lamb because
[1:28:35] you are born under a birthright. The
[1:28:38] lamb has to die for you.
[1:28:41] Now my thing is
[1:28:43] why why when John said and and that
[1:28:48] angel they they they they they were
[1:28:50] corresponding and and and and and and
[1:28:53] some man worthy
[1:28:57] not the bishop not the pope not the
[1:28:59] presbyter not Mary
[1:29:04] no man was worthy
[1:29:07] don't weep John
[1:29:10] Why you worried?
[1:29:14] Oh, the the Antichrist is on the scene.
[1:29:18] So is the bride.
[1:29:21] Hallelujah. Why should I worry? Why
[1:29:24] should I fret? Oh, I'm coming to
[1:29:26] something. Because we failed to see the
[1:29:30] power, the authority that's invested in
[1:29:34] us.
[1:29:36] And the only reason is that we fail to
[1:29:41] connect.
[1:29:43] Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[1:29:44] Brother Brandon the connector showed us
[1:29:47] how to connect.
[1:29:49] Hallelujah. And without that connection,
[1:29:52] oh, come on, somebody. I don't care if
[1:29:54] you got the most powerful radio or
[1:29:56] television there is.
[1:29:59] You got to plug that baby up.
[1:30:03] Right. There is a power
[1:30:07] that we're not tapping into. And the
[1:30:10] devil knows because he's made us so
[1:30:12] busy.
[1:30:14] We're too busy for Jesus. But I hope God
[1:30:17] never gets too busy for me.
[1:30:21] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. He says, "Now you
[1:30:25] look at Jesus and find any fault in
[1:30:31] him." Can you find any fault?
[1:30:34] Come on, somebody. Let me tell you
[1:30:37] something. I don't care how rough you
[1:30:39] lived, there's always somebody who's
[1:30:42] lived rougher.
[1:30:44] You think you got it bad, there's always
[1:30:46] somebody who's had it worse.
[1:30:49] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Let me move on. by
[1:30:51] the grace of
[1:30:53] God. He says, "Don't look who don't look
[1:30:57] who you are. Look who he is."
[1:31:03] Then you'll get you you'll be getting
[1:31:06] closer to divine healing.
[1:31:09] Search your sacrifice over. If you can
[1:31:12] find any fault in that,
[1:31:17] come on, somebody.
[1:31:19] Paul couldn't find no fault.
[1:31:22] Hallelujah.
[1:31:24] Amen. And you say, "Well, wait a minute,
[1:31:27] brother. Listen. The lamb, if Jesus
[1:31:30] wasn't God, there would not have been a
[1:31:33] lamb to show up.
[1:31:36] He showed up."
[1:31:39] When John had searched everywhere,
[1:31:43] there was no man worthy but Jesus. You
[1:31:48] know why he had to be worthy? In order
[1:31:50] to make you worthy. Hallelujah. He
[1:31:54] became us. Oh, we say that all the time.
[1:31:57] That we might become him. And I don't
[1:31:59] know about you. I believe that.
[1:32:02] Hallelujah. Like people say, "Whoa,
[1:32:04] brother Brooks, do you let me say, do
[1:32:06] you really believe?" Hallelujah. That
[1:32:08] old devil, Amen, tried to give me cancer
[1:32:11] one time. Uhhuh.
[1:32:14] I said tried.
[1:32:18] If God don't tell me and show me I I
[1:32:20] need I that's mine. I ain't taking it.
[1:32:24] And that old devil, you know the devil
[1:32:25] the those doctors can be real mean.
[1:32:30] And they give you the worst scenario.
[1:32:33] Oh, it done move all into your
[1:32:36] bones. Prostrate
[1:32:38] cancer. My wife and I, we start eating
[1:32:41] all that nasty
[1:32:43] food. Y'all know it's nasty.
[1:32:46] all that health stuff. But you have to
[1:32:48] do it sometime. You know what I mean?
[1:32:51] But the Lord showed my wife I didn't
[1:32:52] have it no more. Whatever it was, she
[1:32:54] told me, she said, "You don't have C." I
[1:32:56] guess what I said, what? I'm taking your
[1:32:58] report.
[1:33:03] Amen. And folks, when we when she told
[1:33:07] me that and that revelation struck me,
[1:33:10] we went by Popeyes.
[1:33:13] I'm telling you the truth.
[1:33:16] been eating it ever since.
[1:33:20] I got proof. I got a letter at home
[1:33:22] showing I had it and I got a letter from
[1:33:24] the doctor saying I have it no more.
[1:33:26] Hallelujah. But that's
[1:33:29] because we are the book. There's healing
[1:33:33] in the book. Yes. Deliverance in the
[1:33:36] book. Shelter in the book. Everything we
[1:33:41] need is in the book. But where is that
[1:33:43] book now? is in you. Come on, somebody.
[1:33:47] Take it to the next level. Take it to
[1:33:50] the next level.
[1:33:54] Hallelujah. Don't be afraid of the
[1:33:56] devil. He's just your servant.
[1:34:00] Oh my. See, I could hear it. But it's
[1:34:03] true. The devil can't do nothing to you
[1:34:07] unless unless Jesus say, "Okay."
[1:34:11] Hallelujah. And then we sing, "Why me
[1:34:14] Lord?
[1:34:17] Why not you?"
[1:34:20] When you realize that God has chosen you
[1:34:22] out of billions of people to be his
[1:34:25] bride, I'm not going to let him down.
[1:34:28] Y'all hear what I'm saying? I'm
[1:34:30] determined to make a hundred. You say,
[1:34:32] "Well, what do you mean, Brother Brooks?
[1:34:34] It's in me."
[1:34:37] Y'all understand me? That's why when I
[1:34:39] fall, something picks me up. When I
[1:34:42] stumble, something straighten my foot.
[1:34:45] Y'all know what I'm saying? It's not me.
[1:34:48] When I'm really down and low, all of a
[1:34:50] sudden, a sweet song comes.
[1:34:53] Mercy.
[1:34:55] Rewrote my life. You know it ain't the
[1:34:58] devil talking to you.
[1:35:02] We got to know you're free.
[1:35:05] Oh, brother Brooks. See, I can tell you
[1:35:08] this. When that faith struck me, it was
[1:35:12] beyond anything that I could imagine. I
[1:35:15] can't even explain it. All I know if
[1:35:19] when somebody would say if but what but
[1:35:22] if I shut them down. I wouldn't let one
[1:35:26] crack of unbelief penetrate
[1:35:30] what was going on with me. There were
[1:35:32] even times I had to raise my voice
[1:35:38] cuz some people don't get it.
[1:35:40] I had to raise my voice. It's no if God
[1:35:44] has already healed me. I don't want that
[1:35:47] unbelief around my atmosphere.
[1:35:50] Somebody help me here. That's the way it
[1:35:53] goes. That's the way it go. It's my
[1:35:55] inheritance. is your inheritance in this
[1:35:59] book is this is all you need once this
[1:36:02] book is quickened.
[1:36:06] Hallelujah. No wonder brother Brandham
[1:36:08] said it like this. Once that those seals
[1:36:10] were open he said this Bible became a
[1:36:12] new book. Hallelujah. He even said if
[1:36:16] you're going through something find you
[1:36:18] a character
[1:36:19] in the Bible.
[1:36:22] Is that right? You say well how could
[1:36:24] that help me? Just illustrate when David
[1:36:28] was about to slay Goliath. You hear that
[1:36:31] story, right? You can imagine it. You
[1:36:34] see it in your mind. You're not Goliath.
[1:36:37] You're David.
[1:36:39] Hallelujah. You identify with the
[1:36:41] character of the book. When you hear
[1:36:45] about Esther,
[1:36:48] Hallelujah. You know you're not Vasti.
[1:36:51] Hallelujah. You work with Esther.
[1:36:55] Y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:36:58] That's the way it works. You enter into
[1:37:00] the book and the book enter into you and
[1:37:03] then you got victory.
[1:37:06] Hallelujah.
[1:37:07] Listen, somebody said, "Well, oh, I
[1:37:09] don't know how long it's going to take."
[1:37:12] It doesn't matter.
[1:37:15] Job said, "I'll wait till my change
[1:37:17] come, but I refuse to doubt him."
[1:37:22] Y'all hear me? But the pain, well,
[1:37:25] you've never suffered like Jesus.
[1:37:28] These little things we go through and we
[1:37:30] look at God like he's being unfair.
[1:37:33] Hallelujah. Somebody need to go to
[1:37:35] Calvary.
[1:37:36] I preached that one time. You know, they
[1:37:38] said he they beat him so bad he didn't
[1:37:42] even look human no more. Think about it.
[1:37:46] And a few of those links were yours.
[1:37:50] We put him in that shape, but he became
[1:37:53] sin that we might become his
[1:37:56] righteousness.
[1:37:57] Y'all hear what I'm saying? I'm not
[1:37:59] saying this like a cliche. It's a
[1:38:02] reality. This message is a reality. And
[1:38:05] the devil knows it. And he knows when
[1:38:08] you believe it and when you don't.
[1:38:10] That's right.
[1:38:13] Ecclesiastes 3:11. You don't have to
[1:38:15] turn there. He have made everything
[1:38:18] beautiful in his time. That's one of my
[1:38:22] favorite scriptures. In his time, not my
[1:38:26] time. His time. Hallelujah. You You love
[1:38:30] the Lord. You know, God can't lie. The
[1:38:34] Holy Ghost according to John 14, I'm not
[1:38:36] going to read the whole thing, but he
[1:38:38] said Jesus Christ is what? The spirit of
[1:38:41] truth.
[1:38:43] God will tell you who you are, but you
[1:38:45] got to believe what he's telling you.
[1:38:49] I don't know. It just seem like people
[1:38:51] are waiting on something.
[1:38:53] But you say you got the Holy Ghost, but
[1:38:55] you're waiting on what?
[1:38:58] God is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:39:00] forever.
[1:39:02] Is that right? Remember the Mexican baby
[1:39:05] was swollen and had cancer in the mouth,
[1:39:08] and brother Brandon was waiting on God
[1:39:10] to do something. And then God told
[1:39:12] Brother Brandham, "I'm waiting on you."
[1:39:17] See, we can't be Pentecostal in this.
[1:39:20] You got to feel an anointing. The
[1:39:22] authority is already given.
[1:39:25] You hear what I'm saying? It's the
[1:39:27] authority in you, not the way you feel.
[1:39:30] You're not going to feel good every day.
[1:39:32] There might be times you won't feel like
[1:39:34] pride, but there's something on the
[1:39:36] inside that declare that you are.
[1:39:40] Hallelujah.
[1:39:42] Oh, he said, "And at that day you'll
[1:39:44] know that I'm in the Father and the
[1:39:46] Father in my Father and ye in me and I
[1:39:49] in you." How many of y'all know that?
[1:39:52] It ain't no guesswork. You got to know
[1:39:55] it.
[1:39:57] Hallelujah. It's like knowing you got a
[1:39:59] real big brother that's going to back
[1:40:00] you up. Hallelujah. You got You must
[1:40:03] know because it's just a little bit of
[1:40:07] doubt will hybrid it. Come on, y'all.
[1:40:10] getting quiet. But at least you ought to
[1:40:12] cover yourself and say, "Lord, help thou
[1:40:14] my unbelief.
[1:40:17] Let's move on." The Bible talks about
[1:40:19] these signs shall
[1:40:21] follow. And I'm going to tell you
[1:40:22] something. I've seen so many things in
[1:40:24] my life, you know, and then I find out
[1:40:27] that some people won't they're not
[1:40:28] living it. You see what I'm saying? I I
[1:40:31] I don't I'm the greatest miracle that
[1:40:34] has ever happened in my life, in this
[1:40:37] life. And I'm not talking about the
[1:40:39] cancer deliverance. I'm talking the
[1:40:41] salvation of my soul.
[1:40:44] Nobody could have changed me. I couldn't
[1:40:46] change me. He changed me. He changed
[1:40:50] you. You got to re remember those
[1:40:53] things. Sometimes you got to go back to
[1:40:56] go forward in your thoughts. You got to
[1:40:58] remember what you were. I'm I'm on a
[1:41:02] journey. No, he's not through with me
[1:41:04] yet.
[1:41:06] But I've already you, you and I, we the
[1:41:09] only generation that have seen our
[1:41:11] future.
[1:41:15] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Everybody
[1:41:17] else had to work with hope. We work with
[1:41:21] faith and our love for him will carry us
[1:41:24] there. You say, "Well, what do you
[1:41:26] mean?" That's why he told the prophet,
[1:41:28] "This is the victory of the love
[1:41:30] divine."
[1:41:32] higher. Y'all understand me? Our love
[1:41:35] for him will take us there.
[1:41:40] Hallelujah. He already has proven that
[1:41:42] he loves us. We need to show him how
[1:41:45] much we love him.
[1:41:47] Oh my God.
[1:41:50] Now the believer today coming from the
[1:41:54] message who is God 1950
[1:41:59] 08:1523. Now, as a believer today, most
[1:42:02] people say he's a good
[1:42:04] man. He pays tithing to the church. He's
[1:42:08] a good member. That's very fine. That's
[1:42:12] a moral
[1:42:14] life. Now, no one could speak evil of
[1:42:17] that. But that's not what I'm talking
[1:42:20] about. Jesus judged a man Jesus judge a
[1:42:24] man, a believer, a different type of a
[1:42:26] character.
[1:42:28] Jesus, the last words that he said when
[1:42:30] he left the world was, "Go ye into the
[1:42:33] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:42:34] creature." Is that right? He that
[1:42:37] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:42:38] saved. He that believeth not shall be
[1:42:40] damned. Is that right? Now, God can't go
[1:42:44] back off of his
[1:42:46] word. God never even asked
[1:42:49] Nicodemus what sect you belong to.
[1:42:54] He said to Nicodemus, "You must be born
[1:42:57] again."
[1:43:00] Somebody, somebody better hear what I'm
[1:43:02] saying. You know, I'm looking at this
[1:43:04] thing and I'm said, you know, we we if
[1:43:07] we're not careful,
[1:43:09] we
[1:43:10] ourselves will become the Pharisee.
[1:43:16] It's more than religion.
[1:43:21] Now, every church will come that far.
[1:43:23] Brother Bham said it like that. But what
[1:43:25] about the rest of it? He says, "These
[1:43:28] signs shall follow them that believe."
[1:43:30] Do you believe it? These signs shall
[1:43:33] follow them that believe in my name.
[1:43:36] Shall they cast out devils, speak with
[1:43:38] new tongues, take up a serpent, or drink
[1:43:41] deadly things? Shall not harm them.
[1:43:44] Right? If they lay their hands on the
[1:43:46] sick, they shall recover. And he was
[1:43:48] taken up from the midst of them. And the
[1:43:52] disciples returned with great joy and
[1:43:55] preached the word great joy. Didn't even
[1:43:57] say joy. Great joy.
[1:44:02] And sometime we can't even get great joy
[1:44:05] until we get a great song.
[1:44:11] The word is what bring great joy.
[1:44:16] Hallelujah.
[1:44:18] Hallelujah.
[1:44:19] Yes, sir. We look at this thing, right?
[1:44:24] And and and and he said, "These signs
[1:44:25] shall follow them." Do the Do you
[1:44:26] believe? These signs shall follow them.
[1:44:28] The name shall they cast out devils,
[1:44:30] speak with new tongues, take up
[1:44:32] serpents, drink deadly things, shall not
[1:44:34] harm them. If they lay hands on the
[1:44:36] sick, they shall recover. And he was
[1:44:38] taken up from the midst of them. And the
[1:44:40] disciples returned with great joy and
[1:44:42] preached the word everywhere. the Lord
[1:44:46] working with them confirming the
[1:44:48] confirming the word which s is your
[1:44:53] attitude it's the
[1:44:55] attitude if this Bible if this word can
[1:44:58] bring joy to you you've become fearless
[1:45:02] no devil would stand before you you see
[1:45:05] but we in this day we want a quick fix
[1:45:08] it it doesn't happen that way all the
[1:45:10] time but one thing for sure like the
[1:45:13] prophet of God said it like this uh
[1:45:15] in in summation. If I pray for so many
[1:45:18] and they would die, I'll continue to
[1:45:20] pray. Why? I know the word is right.
[1:45:25] I don't doubt the word is right.
[1:45:29] Hallelujah. And if it's in me now, I
[1:45:32] don't know about you, but I'm changing.
[1:45:36] Something's changed in me. I'm not even
[1:45:38] the same man I was 15 years ago.
[1:45:42] You understand me? And I'm not talking
[1:45:44] about my gray hair and all that stuff.
[1:45:45] I'm talking about the real thing inside.
[1:45:48] There's a love that I cannot explain.
[1:45:51] There's something that has changed in me
[1:45:53] that I cannot I don't understand it. I
[1:45:55] know it's God. Come on, somebody.
[1:46:00] It corrects me
[1:46:02] all during the day.
[1:46:07] Y'all hear me? And I know it ain't the
[1:46:09] devil cuz he want me to mess up. But God
[1:46:12] always, he's always there. And I'm
[1:46:15] saying, "Yes, Lord." And I'm repenting,
[1:46:17] "Yes, Lord." And I'm saying, "Make me
[1:46:19] perfect, Lord. I want your virtues. I
[1:46:22] want everything you offered. We're the
[1:46:25] only generation that walks out here
[1:46:28] perfect."
[1:46:30] And you know what? It's by the grace of
[1:46:32] God.
[1:46:34] You need to stop beating yourself up.
[1:46:39] You need to stop. you you won't go far.
[1:46:41] Oh, look at me. Look at me. God looked
[1:46:43] at you before he brought you here.
[1:46:47] It didn't hinder him.
[1:46:50] He still loved you. The Bible said in
[1:46:52] that while you were yet a sinner, Christ
[1:46:54] died for you. Hallelujah.
[1:46:58] I was telling a brother and I'm almost
[1:47:00] in a place where I want you to
[1:47:02] understand because many of us have been
[1:47:03] hurt and maybe disappointed and
[1:47:04] everything else. I don't know. But you
[1:47:07] know, maybe a friend did something wrong
[1:47:08] and you say, you know, you know how we
[1:47:10] do. Oh, I forgive
[1:47:12] you. But that friend is always down here
[1:47:15] from now on.
[1:47:18] That's not forgiveness.
[1:47:22] To forgive means to also redeem.
[1:47:26] You know Jesus when he redeemed us, he
[1:47:28] took us even higher.
[1:47:31] Y'all understand me? And until you bring
[1:47:34] that situation at least to this plane
[1:47:37] where your enemy fail, you'll never
[1:47:40] forget it. But you'll love him or her
[1:47:43] like they never failed you before.
[1:47:46] Oh y a lot of y'all saying all right.
[1:47:49] I like to hear that. Amen. So you got to
[1:47:52] understand by the grace of God. Amen.
[1:47:55] God watches everything you do and
[1:47:57] everything is a test.
[1:48:02] I want to be like Jesus.
[1:48:06] Okay, he's bringing it.
[1:48:10] And don't get it wrong. If he's in you,
[1:48:13] you can't help but to be like him.
[1:48:17] It's a win-win. Get the Holy Ghost. Get
[1:48:21] God in you. He'll bring you to
[1:48:23] perfection. Oh, come on, somebody. He
[1:48:26] that begun the good work in you is
[1:48:29] faithful to complete it.
[1:48:33] He's faithful. Not us. He is. Let me
[1:48:37] move on. It wasn't for
[1:48:40] Jesus, right? Let me let me I'm sorry.
[1:48:42] Now, that was to be preached until Jesus
[1:48:45] returned. Till Jesus
[1:48:47] returned. Oh God, give us men and women
[1:48:50] of courage. Somebody who will stand and
[1:48:53] call right and right and wrong wrong.
[1:48:56] Right. Right. And wrong, wrong. Excuse
[1:48:57] me. It's either right or wrong.
[1:49:01] Ain't no in between.
[1:49:04] Right. And if that isn't I read that
[1:49:06] Mark 16. If that isn't the truth, I
[1:49:09] don't believe the Bible. And if I don't
[1:49:11] believe the Bible, see, if I w if I was
[1:49:13] or wasn't for Jesus, I'd be here against
[1:49:17] him. God grant the day when men and
[1:49:20] women will be what they say they are.
[1:49:26] It's the truth.
[1:49:29] People People say, "Uh, you
[1:49:33] know, I'm in the
[1:49:37] message." What message?
[1:49:43] My wife and I, we went to a a a yard
[1:49:47] sale. I don't know whether these women
[1:49:49] were Pentecostals or what they were.
[1:49:51] They had everything in order but their
[1:49:53] face.
[1:49:54] and they look like they were
[1:49:56] miserable. Long hair, long dresses, and
[1:50:00] they look so sad. And I'm like, I don't
[1:50:03] want none of that.
[1:50:06] It's the truth. You let people see you
[1:50:09] happy being a Christian and won't you
[1:50:12] and people will draw to you. Oh, young
[1:50:14] sisters, I know what you're going
[1:50:16] through. You're in that
[1:50:17] time and your flesh getting the best of
[1:50:20] you, but God still love you.
[1:50:27] Oh, rebellious. We've all been
[1:50:30] there. Come on, somebody. All of us has
[1:50:33] never been like we are now.
[1:50:36] There is a season of rebellion. But
[1:50:39] listen, if the seed of God is in there,
[1:50:43] you'll make your way way way back home.
[1:50:46] Hallelujah. You might have some bruises.
[1:50:48] You might have some scrapes.
[1:50:51] You going to have some wounds perhaps,
[1:50:53] but God will never forsake you.
[1:50:57] Hallelujah. I know what I'm talking
[1:50:59] about. Amen. And you know, it it's just
[1:51:02] it it's at a time now where, you know,
[1:51:05] the world is so busy and it's just, you
[1:51:07] know, all of the phones and I don't
[1:51:09] think a person should have a phone if
[1:51:10] they don't have the Holy Ghost. But
[1:51:12] that's my doctrine.
[1:51:19] It's hard for us who got the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:21] Y'all know that.
[1:51:24] Yes. Lord have mercy. Yeah. I know y'all
[1:51:27] y'all young people said, "Don't believe
[1:51:30] him. Don't listen to that
[1:51:32] man." But y'all know what those phones
[1:51:38] do. They ain't got the Holy Ghost. But
[1:51:41] you I just want them to be safe. Safe
[1:51:43] from what? You just gave them the devil.
[1:51:52] Oh, I know my daughter ain't going to do
[1:51:54] that. And I know my
[1:51:56] son, as long as they in that flesh,
[1:52:01] you know what we say? I don't know where
[1:52:03] they got that from. You need to stop
[1:52:06] lying. The apple don't fall far fall far
[1:52:08] fall far fall far fall far fall far fall
[1:52:08] far fall far fall far fall far fall far
[1:52:09] from the tree.
[1:52:12] Now that's the truth. You done been so
[1:52:15] saved you done forgot what it was and
[1:52:16] what it used to be. Oh yeah. They are
[1:52:19] reflection of you without the Holy
[1:52:20] Ghost. Oh, come on. Let me move on. I'm
[1:52:24] just saying cuz I've seen it in my own.
[1:52:26] I'm not just telling you something.
[1:52:29] Eight, nine, eight children, right? And
[1:52:33] some of them reflect my brother, my
[1:52:35] sister, my aunt,
[1:52:38] my Y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:52:40] You see those characteristics coming up
[1:52:43] in your children that that just
[1:52:45] relatives
[1:52:47] only because they don't have it.
[1:52:53] I thank God for brother Brandham. I I
[1:52:55] really do because he told us it wasn't
[1:52:58] all the shouting and the dancing and all
[1:53:00] of the crying. They can all do that. I
[1:53:02] some of my kids they they played me real
[1:53:06] well. 2 Corinthians 3 2-3. I'm not going
[1:53:09] to be so much
[1:53:11] longer, people. The
[1:53:13] book I'm
[1:53:17] learning. God God will let things come
[1:53:20] your way and and and and you the Holy
[1:53:22] Spirit said, "Don't say
[1:53:25] nothing, but because you're raised a
[1:53:28] certain way,
[1:53:30] Lord, help me.
[1:53:32] I got to say something." The Holy Ghost
[1:53:35] say, "Don't say anything.
[1:53:38] But that law says I got to correct them
[1:53:40] now. Oh, come on, somebody. As soon as
[1:53:44] you put the law on them, you just made
[1:53:47] them worse. And guess what? It's your
[1:53:50] fault.
[1:53:54] Is that right?
[1:53:56] Longsuffering.
[1:53:59] That means you got to suffer
[1:54:03] long. Wait till you hear the voice of
[1:54:05] God. Y'all know what I'm saying? It's
[1:54:07] the truth.
[1:54:10] I did a lot of things that I wish I
[1:54:12] could undo.
[1:54:13] But one thing about me, I will make
[1:54:16] right. If I find myself wrong, I will
[1:54:19] make right. My children will tell you
[1:54:20] that. My wife will tell you that. I'm
[1:54:23] not too big. I can't say forgive me.
[1:54:26] Forgive me and mean it.
[1:54:30] Y'all love the Lord. Okay. Give me Give
[1:54:32] me Second Corinthians, please.
[1:54:36] I know this is Wednesday
[1:54:39] night and uh I just wanted to bless you
[1:54:42] with something. I'm trying to get to
[1:54:44] where I'm going, but I'm not there yet.
[1:54:48] But I want you to understand that who
[1:54:49] you are. If the Holy Ghost is in you,
[1:54:53] you are the walking Bible. But you got
[1:54:56] to let go and let God, you got to let
[1:54:59] him do it.
[1:55:02] You'll never overcome until you let him
[1:55:05] do it. But you have to have a will to
[1:55:08] overcome.
[1:55:10] And he will work with your will.
[1:55:13] Oh yes. He might he Listen, if you got
[1:55:16] to overcome peanut butter, he may let
[1:55:18] you taste a few fingers or whatever of
[1:55:21] it for a little while, but he heard your
[1:55:25] prayer.
[1:55:26] Y'all understand me? You say, "Well, God
[1:55:29] didn't hear my Yes, he did. But he makes
[1:55:31] all things beautiful
[1:55:34] in his time.
[1:55:36] It ain't your time. It's his time. And
[1:55:39] the devil say God didn't hear you. He
[1:55:41] did hear you.
[1:55:43] If the blood of Jesus Christ is covering
[1:55:45] you, how can he not hear you?
[1:55:50] But you got to wait on God and wait for
[1:55:53] God and he will give you total
[1:55:56] deliverance.
[1:55:58] Am I preaching a fable? No, I'm a
[1:56:01] witness
[1:56:02] of what God can do.
[1:56:05] Hallelujah. 2 Corinthians 3 2-3. Ye are
[1:56:09] our epistles, written in our hearts,
[1:56:13] known and read of all men. For as much
[1:56:16] as ye are manifestly declared to be the
[1:56:19] epistles of Christ, ministered by us,
[1:56:22] written not with ink, but with the
[1:56:24] spirit of the living God.
[1:56:30] You need to go listen to that message,
[1:56:31] brother. Say, who is
[1:56:35] God? Now, we're not talking about a a
[1:56:38] second or third person. We're talking
[1:56:40] about God.
[1:56:42] And that God is in you,
[1:56:46] right? That God is in you, but God
[1:56:50] won't. He won't force you.
[1:56:53] Whosoever
[1:56:55] will. And you got to be willing to
[1:56:57] suffer, too. A lot of us don't want to
[1:57:00] suffer, but suffering comes with it.
[1:57:02] There's no such thing as I'm gonna carry
[1:57:04] a cross and not suffer. My point is
[1:57:06] this. You got to understand my suffering
[1:57:09] is different from yours. Yours is
[1:57:11] different from mine. But we have been we
[1:57:13] have been, how can I say it? It's been
[1:57:16] uh
[1:57:17] predestinated that that whatever we must
[1:57:19] suffer, we suffer. And at the end of the
[1:57:22] day, we receive glory.
[1:57:26] Father, I would that they have the
[1:57:28] glory. Give them the glory that we had
[1:57:31] before the world began. We have no idea.
[1:57:39] But one thing for sure sure is
[1:57:43] ours that
[1:57:45] God Can you
[1:57:48] imagine? None of us
[1:57:50] can. But one thing for certain, you get
[1:57:53] a little something. Brother Brandham
[1:57:55] said, "It's a place you can't even
[1:57:59] describe it." He said, "But I tell you
[1:58:02] what, don't miss it. Whatever you do,
[1:58:06] don't miss it. Word cannot explain
[1:58:10] explain it." Not even the word sublime
[1:58:12] could ever come to equal is beyond the
[1:58:16] human language, the human mind. And let
[1:58:18] me tell you something. Why would you
[1:58:20] fear man?
[1:58:24] Huh? David says, "No, you're not going
[1:58:26] to stop me from praising the Lord. I'm
[1:58:28] going to praise him." Now, I'm not
[1:58:30] saying you being stopped from praising
[1:58:31] the Lord here, but my goodness, you
[1:58:34] know, all I got to do, can I say this?
[1:58:37] We're having a dinner tomorrow.
[1:58:43] Everybody going to show up.
[1:58:45] Have you ever seen anybody show up at a
[1:58:47] dinner with a sad face?
[1:58:51] Oh my. They come in talking. You know,
[1:58:54] sister so and so cooked the best fried
[1:58:55] chicken. I hope there's some left for
[1:58:57] me.
[1:58:59] Don't we talk about it. My point is the
[1:59:02] word of God
[1:59:05] is
[1:59:06] far above that. You say, "Well, I don't
[1:59:09] like the way he says it. I don't care
[1:59:11] how he says it. If he stutter, stutter,
[1:59:14] stutter, stutter. Hallelujah. I'm gonna
[1:59:16] listen, listen, listen, and I'm gonna
[1:59:18] get what I want.
[1:59:20] Hallelujah.
[1:59:23] Amen. I had a sister. She gone on with
[1:59:25] the Lord. She was a big girl. When she
[1:59:28] go to the ice cream store, she said,
[1:59:31] "Don't give me a little bit. Give me a
[1:59:33] big girl
[1:59:37] portion." Right? So, when I come to
[1:59:39] church, I don't want a little bit.
[1:59:42] I want a big boy potion.
[1:59:45] Hallelujah. I want something that's
[1:59:47] going to feed my soul. Get me to
[1:59:49] thinking about where I am and where I'm
[1:59:52] headed.
[1:59:54] Hallelujah. Oh, I know one thing. A lot
[1:59:57] of times we waste time. Let me tell you
[1:59:59] something. Many people be healed if they
[2:00:01] praise him.
[2:00:04] Hallelujah. I think sometime we miss the
[2:00:07] power of praise. You understand me? But
[2:00:10] I listen. You say, "Oh Lord, I don't
[2:00:12] feel good." Stand up and praise the
[2:00:14] Lord.
[2:00:18] Is that what brother? He did. Sister,
[2:00:20] you can't get out of that wheel. Stand
[2:00:22] up and run.
[2:00:25] He instructed them. And if they did what
[2:00:27] he said, do they were healed.
[2:00:33] See, and the Bible is telling you, you
[2:00:35] in the presence of the Lord. How many of
[2:00:36] y'all believe that?
[2:00:38] And the Bible said when you're in the
[2:00:40] presence of the Lord, there's fullness
[2:00:41] of joy. So if you don't have fullness of
[2:00:43] joy, you're not in the presence.
[2:00:46] It brings something. It gives something.
[2:00:49] Hallelujah. And and I love this message.
[2:00:52] I love this word because listen, you
[2:00:55] become the word
[2:00:57] without any effort.
[2:01:02] Once the Lord quickens you,
[2:01:06] it's out of your hands for sure.
[2:01:09] You understand me? Every tree, you know,
[2:01:12] people say, "Well, I um, you know,
[2:01:14] you've never seen an apple tree grow in
[2:01:15] one day, but everybody want to grow in
[2:01:18] one day." No, you got seasons to go
[2:01:21] through.
[2:01:23] Hallelujah. But I want you to
[2:01:25] understand, if you are the word, your
[2:01:28] day brings you to perfection.
[2:01:31] I I don't I can't even say it like I
[2:01:33] want to, but by the grace of God, we
[2:01:36] were awarded. Amen. Uh white linen and
[2:01:39] all of that. Let me move on. By the
[2:01:41] grace of God, faith is our victory.
[2:01:45] And I'm getting I'm I'm coming to
[2:01:46] something because a lot of time people
[2:01:48] say,
[2:01:50] "Well, I had a sister say this. Well, if
[2:01:53] I'm the elect bride of Jesus Christ,
[2:01:55] Jesus will do it."
[2:01:59] Well, that's true,
[2:02:01] but there's something you got to
[2:02:05] do. We listen and we hear that deep call
[2:02:08] to the deep. How many time we preached
[2:02:10] it? There's a deep to respond.
[2:02:15] But that deep got to go beyond your
[2:02:17] throat.
[2:02:21] It said deep.
[2:02:23] Deep
[2:02:24] call in the soul. There must be a call
[2:02:28] for God.
[2:02:30] And God will respond to the call of your
[2:02:33] soul. Y'all understand me? It ain't how
[2:02:37] loud you get. Somebody think, well, if I
[2:02:40] if I get loud. No, it ain't how loud you
[2:02:43] get. It's how deep you go.
[2:02:48] That's it. I I've seen them cry. I've
[2:02:51] seen them shout. I've seen them run and
[2:02:53] still come up void because they didn't
[2:02:56] go deep enough.
[2:02:59] You got to go deep.
[2:03:04] Hallelujah. You love the Lord.
[2:03:08] Hey, in the days of of of Noah, there
[2:03:10] had to be somebody crying
[2:03:12] out. And there was one man
[2:03:14] Noah. Think about it. It had to go deep.
[2:03:19] There was a there was a cry of
[2:03:21] Moses, right? And you think it was all
[2:03:24] the people. No, they may have, but they
[2:03:26] didn't go deep enough cuz only two got
[2:03:29] saved out of that
[2:03:30] generation. I I'm trying to tell y'all
[2:03:32] something. The devil got you so busy,
[2:03:35] you don't have time to go deep.
[2:03:38] And every time people, oh, I want to
[2:03:40] hear a deep message. What good is going
[2:03:41] to do you if you don't take the message
[2:03:44] and go deep with it?
[2:03:47] Huh? When you leave here tonight, this
[2:03:50] may sound like a shallow message, but
[2:03:53] something was said
[2:03:58] and you need to wake up and and I say
[2:04:00] you, I'm talking about all of us. We
[2:04:02] need a a good shaking.
[2:04:06] God help us. What is this?
[2:04:12] Everything's supposed to get greater.
[2:04:15] But you find out things are
[2:04:17] diminishing. Oh, maybe that's only in my
[2:04:21] church, but I'll say it like this. By
[2:04:23] the grace of God, you're not going to go
[2:04:26] to sleep on
[2:04:30] me. You understand what I'm saying? If I
[2:04:33] see you going to sleep, oh yeah,
[2:04:35] sometime they think I'm crazy. I'll say
[2:04:37] something, they'll wake up. They're not
[2:04:40] even sleep. They got their eyes open.
[2:04:41] They just look like they
[2:04:44] in their spirit. They're sleeping.
[2:04:45] They're not hearing. So, you got to say
[2:04:48] something.
[2:04:52] Sometimes I have them outside the talk a
[2:04:55] church talking about me.
[2:04:59] I get so
[2:05:01] happy. I say they ain't going to forget
[2:05:03] what I just
[2:05:05] said. you know, because God be talking
[2:05:08] and sometimes, you know, you gotta do
[2:05:11] something to to to get them to see.
[2:05:14] Anyway, let's move on. I'm I'm almost
[2:05:19] done. I love this scripture and how
[2:05:22] Jesus, the word of God, talks about in
[2:05:24] Isaiah 50 and 7, and I'm coming down to
[2:05:26] a close. I don't want to wear you out,
[2:05:28] but I did want to give you something by
[2:05:30] the name of the Lord, uh, that would
[2:05:32] help
[2:05:33] you, you know.
[2:05:36] Um, one thing I do believe in praying
[2:05:39] for people even in my church and stuff,
[2:05:42] you know, but I like for people to
[2:05:45] ask. I remember the time the brother,
[2:05:48] you know, he said, "B brothers, I want
[2:05:50] you to pray for me to get the Holy
[2:05:52] Ghost." I said, "Okay,
[2:05:53] anytime." We went to the church and I
[2:05:56] found out I was praying harder than he
[2:05:59] was. And the Holy Spirit say, "Get up.
[2:06:02] Go to the restroom. If he's real, he'll
[2:06:05] he if he's real, he'll still be praying.
[2:06:08] If he's not, he'll be waiting on you."
[2:06:11] When I got from the restroom, he was
[2:06:13] waiting on me. And basically, I told
[2:06:15] him, I said, "No, I can't pray for you.
[2:06:18] Pray with you. It's got to be something
[2:06:21] in you.
[2:06:26] in you that want God more than anything.
[2:06:31] You got to empty out in order for him to
[2:06:33] fill it up.
[2:06:35] So listen what he says. Set a faith face
[2:06:38] like a
[2:06:39] flint. And I believe by the grace of God
[2:06:42] this went totally different, but I I
[2:06:45] believe God spoke to somebody. I came to
[2:06:48] encourage you, not to bring you down.
[2:06:52] You understand me? I want you to
[2:06:54] understand it's a serious time.
[2:06:57] And if you don't set your fla face like
[2:06:59] a flint, if you don't put your face and
[2:07:02] look in the eyes of God,
[2:07:05] Satan will cause you to be distracted.
[2:07:08] Not that God won't save you because he
[2:07:10] did Jesus. I mean, he did Peter, excuse
[2:07:12] me. But my point is, it is so late in
[2:07:16] the evening, you can't count on your
[2:07:19] religion.
[2:07:22] I made a
[2:07:24] statement and I hope you understand the
[2:07:26] statement to my
[2:07:27] church. I said there'd be a lot of
[2:07:30] people in
[2:07:32] hell that call themselves following this
[2:07:38] message. Am I right?
[2:07:42] You see the only way you can if you
[2:07:44] really following it, brother Bren call
[2:07:46] this message his holy ghost message.
[2:07:49] And this Holy Ghost message will cause
[2:07:51] you to love your enemy. Oh, come on.
[2:07:55] That's a Yeah. Love your enemy. Love
[2:07:58] those who who despitefully use you.
[2:08:00] Yeah. Pray for them. You know the word.
[2:08:03] That's the word. And the bride is
[2:08:05] clothed in the what? Word.
[2:08:10] You say, "I can't do it." Well, I know
[2:08:12] that. He knows that. But we have not
[2:08:15] because we ask not.
[2:08:19] Set your face like a flint. Sisters, I
[2:08:23] don't care if your best friend ain't
[2:08:24] going. Uh-uh. I ain't going nowhere with
[2:08:29] nobody. If you want to go the wrong way,
[2:08:31] go the wrong way. Ah, fair you. But my
[2:08:35] point is, you're living in the last
[2:08:38] days, last moments. You can see it,
[2:08:41] right? Don't be foolish like a lot of
[2:08:44] those people in those foreign country
[2:08:46] when when the tidal wave struck, they
[2:08:48] out there looking at it.
[2:08:52] You don't look at it. Oh, when this
[2:08:55] happened, the rapture going to take. Oh,
[2:08:57] when this happened, the rapture going to
[2:08:59] take place. My question is, have you
[2:09:01] made yourself ready?
[2:09:06] That's the big question. Have you made
[2:09:10] yourself ready?
[2:09:12] And you and I must You got to believe
[2:09:14] it. And I'm I'mma close this because it
[2:09:17] it did God I mean just my point is this.
[2:09:21] If you truly believe the
[2:09:23] Bible, it will not only work for you,
[2:09:27] it'll work through you.
[2:09:31] The one thing I loved about the ministry
[2:09:34] of
[2:09:35] Joshua, he included everybody.
[2:09:40] And he said, "We will all walk around
[2:09:42] Jordan." I mean Jericho, excuse me. He
[2:09:46] included everybody.
[2:09:48] And this ministry is the ministry of the
[2:09:50] Holy Spirit. Who is Joshua?
[2:09:54] Amen. So he includes everybody. You say,
[2:09:57] "Well, Brother Brooks, I I don't have no
[2:09:59] gift. I don't have no calling." But one
[2:10:02] thing Brother Brandham did give us.
[2:10:05] Everybody in this church has a ministry.
[2:10:10] Can I say it like this? And he said,
[2:10:12] "Come to church a half hour early."
[2:10:17] That's your ministry. If you don't have
[2:10:20] nothing else, but if you're faithful,
[2:10:23] now some of us can't do it because we
[2:10:24] got to work. But if you're
[2:10:28] faithful, God will give you something
[2:10:30] more.
[2:10:32] I know I I I just I I said this by the
[2:10:35] grace of
[2:10:37] God. When it all boils down to it, is
[2:10:41] you and God.
[2:10:43] Brother Random theme was only
[2:10:45] believe all things are possible.
[2:10:49] If you really believe it, people, you
[2:10:51] understand me? When hard times come, you
[2:10:54] still can
[2:10:55] smile. You still can shout. You still
[2:10:58] can dance. You still can praise God. You
[2:11:00] got to show God his your gratitude
[2:11:02] toward what he's doing. And I tell you
[2:11:04] what, I've heard the prophet of God
[2:11:06] basically say this. If you maybe it was
[2:11:09] someone else. I'm sorry. I don't want to
[2:11:10] cause him to say, but I'll tell you
[2:11:11] what's
[2:11:13] truth. A lot of times demons would
[2:11:16] trouble
[2:11:18] you. And it's all because you have you
[2:11:22] because of lack of worship.
[2:11:27] You got a troubled mind. Some the devil
[2:11:29] fight in your mind. Start praising God.
[2:11:34] You make him worship. The devil ain't
[2:11:36] going to stay with you.
[2:11:40] That's the truth. He ain't going to stay
[2:11:42] with you. As long as you worshiping the
[2:11:44] Lord, he's going to leave you.
[2:11:48] Right. People say, "Well, I can't get I
[2:11:50] can't get over smoking." Stop it.
[2:11:54] Just just just just don't do it.
[2:11:58] And the devil will leave you. You say,
[2:12:01] "I don't believe that." I'mma tell you
[2:12:02] why. He's a showoff. He like to He like
[2:12:06] people to see him. Y'all understand me?
[2:12:09] I'm closing. Right. Cuz you seen them
[2:12:13] all in the winter. Y'all don't have them
[2:12:16] like we do. 40 below and they out there
[2:12:19] in the
[2:12:23] snow. He like to be seen. The Holy Ghost
[2:12:27] likes to be seen. Oh, come on, folks.
[2:12:31] You say, "I don't believe that." Then
[2:12:32] why on the day of Pentecost, he had them
[2:12:35] jumping out of windows?
[2:12:40] It was an uprising,
[2:12:44] right? God, the Holy Ghost want to be
[2:12:47] seen.
[2:12:51] Some of us, we so afraid to get so happy
[2:12:53] we might speak in
[2:12:58] tongue. Oh my
[2:13:02] goodness. Anyway, the Holy Ghost want to
[2:13:05] be seen through you. Living word
[2:13:09] in living people. I people listen
[2:13:13] everywhere I go. I don't care where I
[2:13:14] go. People know I who I am. I let them
[2:13:18] know. I do not want the world to
[2:13:20] say have have to wonder about me. But
[2:13:23] you don't have to tell them I'm you're a
[2:13:25] Christian. I
[2:13:27] do. I tell them I'm a Christian cuz I
[2:13:29] want them to look at me as a Christian.
[2:13:32] Hallelujah. And if you don't tell them
[2:13:34] you're a Christian, they're going to
[2:13:35] disrespect you.
[2:13:39] Yes, sir. I've had them do that more
[2:13:41] than once. I say, "Hold uph. Not not
[2:13:44] only am I a Christian, but I'm a pastor.
[2:13:46] You ought to see them demons then.
[2:13:50] You got to stand up for Jesus.
[2:13:55] They're going to call you crazy anyway,
[2:13:57] but you ought to at least give them a
[2:13:59] reason to.
[2:14:02] I'm closing. I'm trying to close, but
[2:14:04] but my my thought is this people. You
[2:14:06] got a great pastor.
[2:14:10] None of us are perfect within ourselves.
[2:14:14] But when you see a man doing his best,
[2:14:17] right, give him honor
[2:14:20] cuz all of us fall short.
[2:14:23] But one thing for certain, I I I say it
[2:14:25] to myself, my wife, she's in the
[2:14:28] back. My wife has stayed with me for 47
[2:14:33] years. Don't ask me why.
[2:14:37] I'm
[2:14:39] just But she had she hadn't had an easy
[2:14:42] road. Come
[2:14:45] on. And only love can make you do that.
[2:14:51] My wife does never has never said,
[2:14:53] "Well, see, has thrown up the past in my
[2:14:56] face." And neither have
[2:14:58] I. She's shaking her head. That's
[2:15:02] right. We have a testimony. And I'm
[2:15:04] closing.
[2:15:06] And I said that about five times, but I
[2:15:09] really I'm trying
[2:15:10] to. My wife and I has never screamed and
[2:15:14] yelled at each other in all the years
[2:15:16] that we've been married.
[2:15:21] I've never called her names. She's never
[2:15:23] called me names. I've never abused her
[2:15:26] uh you know, physically or
[2:15:28] anything. Why?
[2:15:31] cuz she's
[2:15:33] sacred and we're sacred. Y'all don't
[2:15:37] know that
[2:15:38] you're sacred. The word is
[2:15:42] sacred. And God has chosen you. And you
[2:15:45] are
[2:15:49] sacred. And if you've been doing that,
[2:15:51] you need to repent and ask God to help
[2:15:53] you.
[2:15:55] Come on.
[2:16:02] I've had brothers fighting. Ah, what are
[2:16:04] you
[2:16:05] doing? I don't know why I'm saying this,
[2:16:08] pastor, but I got to say
[2:16:10] it. I told those brothers the other
[2:16:12] Sunday, I said, "Oh my, you better be
[2:16:16] glad I don't have a law that would give
[2:16:18] me
[2:16:21] permission. You hit your
[2:16:24] wife, I don't like that." I told him
[2:16:28] straight up. I said, 'You might be
[2:16:29] bigger than I
[2:16:33] am. I hope I'm saying this in the right
[2:16:36] spirit, but my point is
[2:16:38] this. I don't understand that my Lord
[2:16:42] has never beat
[2:16:45] me. He chasens me. He loves me. He
[2:16:50] corrects me. But he has never abused me.
[2:16:54] And I'll say this by the grace of God.
[2:16:56] We we talk about the rapure but it must
[2:17:00] first start at home.
[2:17:05] Right. Brother Ren say if a house is
[2:17:07] holy
[2:17:08] an angel will visit.
[2:17:12] That's what we want by the grace of God.
[2:17:15] Let's stand. Forgive me.
[2:17:29] I love you,
[2:17:32] Lord, for your mercy never fails
[2:17:37] me. All of my
[2:17:40] day, I've been held in your
[2:17:45] hand. From the moment that I wake
[2:17:50] up until I lay my
[2:17:54] head. Oh, I will
[2:17:57] sing of the
[2:17:59] goodness of
[2:18:02] God.
[2:18:05] Oh, all my life you have been
[2:18:12] faithful. Yes. All my life you have been
[2:18:18] so so
[2:18:22] good. With every breath that I am
[2:18:28] able. Oh, I will
[2:18:30] sing of the
[2:18:33] goodness of
[2:18:36] God. I love your voice.
[2:18:42] You have led me through the
[2:18:44] [Music]
[2:18:46] fire in the darkest
[2:18:49] night. You are close like no
[2:18:55] other. I've known you as a father.
[2:18:59] Oh, I've known you as a
[2:19:03] friend and I have
[2:19:06] lived in the
[2:19:08] goodness of
[2:19:11] God. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. All my life you
[2:19:17] have been.
[2:19:22] Oh, all my life you have been so
[2:19:31] Every breath that I
[2:19:36] am, oh, I will
[2:19:39] sing of the
[2:19:41] goodness of
[2:19:45] God. Yes. All my life you have been
[2:19:53] faithful. Yes.
[2:19:56] All my life you have been so so
[2:20:03] good. With every breath that I am
[2:20:09] able. Oh, I will
[2:20:11] sing in the
[2:20:14] goodness of
[2:20:17] God. I will
[2:20:20] sing of the
[2:20:23] goodness of God.
[2:20:26] [Music]
[2:20:32] We said a few things at the end there. I
[2:20:35] hope it wasn't
[2:20:39] offensive, but I know by the grace of
[2:20:43] God, if you truly love
[2:20:46] God, your love for your husband and wife
[2:20:50] will be unconditional. Amen.
[2:20:55] And I believe
[2:20:56] that exactly right. You're one
[2:21:02] and there's no way I I would
[2:21:03] deliberately
[2:21:05] hurt my wife. Now we grew. We've grown.
[2:21:09] But when you
[2:21:10] mature, you
[2:21:12] understand you don't do
[2:21:15] that. And I'm not accusing anybody. I
[2:21:17] don't know you like
[2:21:19] that. But think about it. Each and every
[2:21:22] one of us are sacred before the Lord
[2:21:25] because of the Holy Spirit that's in us.
[2:21:28] And therefore, we ought to treat each
[2:21:30] other
[2:21:32] sacredly.
[2:21:35] That's the way I see it. You love the
[2:21:38] Lord. We give it over to the pastor by
[2:21:40] the grace of God.
[2:21:45] [Applause]
[2:22:01] Hallelujah. Isn't that wonderful?
[2:22:04] You know, I thought as our brother
[2:22:06] preached, you know, one thing a
[2:22:09] Christian can do is control the
[2:22:11] atmosphere.
[2:22:13] Yes, he
[2:22:15] creates the atmosphere.
[2:22:19] You know, if you had a
[2:22:21] wreck and you're sitting on the side of
[2:22:23] the road and your car is totally wrecked
[2:22:26] and it's all smashed in and everything
[2:22:30] and you're
[2:22:31] alive, you thank God.
[2:22:36] And you just don't sit in the wreck the
[2:22:38] rest of your life.
[2:22:41] you get on and you get up and you keep
[2:22:44] going.
[2:22:46] You know, the brother mentioned our
[2:22:48] wives and and those things and you know,
[2:22:52] I I feel Leslie and I have the same
[2:22:54] testimony, but that's the way we ought
[2:22:56] to treat one another,
[2:22:59] you know, and I I really thought tonight
[2:23:02] was a message about the path forward,
[2:23:07] where God wants us to be. Your past is
[2:23:10] not gonna do anything for you.
[2:23:14] It's history.
[2:23:16] You know what I mean? There there's no
[2:23:19] need having regrets if you made a
[2:23:22] mistake. You can undo it.
[2:23:26] That's right. But you can leave it right
[2:23:28] there and leave those things which are
[2:23:30] behind and press for a higher calling.
[2:23:37] You can't undo it.
[2:23:39] [Music]
[2:23:40] But you can put it under the blood,
[2:23:46] you know. And if if someone's been in in
[2:23:48] a wreck in their life, you don't keep
[2:23:50] taking them back to the wreck. See,
[2:23:53] you're in this wreck. You don't keep
[2:23:55] putting the fear in them that they're
[2:23:56] going to get in another wreck.
[2:24:00] You know, you talk about a God that
[2:24:02] saved you from the wreck. And he'll keep
[2:24:05] you from the next wreck. and
[2:24:08] everything's good. I I love this
[2:24:10] scripture. This scripture as our brother
[2:24:13] talked
[2:24:15] about
[2:24:16] this you becoming this book cuz this
[2:24:20] book is you. It's the prophecy of what
[2:24:25] you are to be.
[2:24:28] It's it's the first
[2:24:30] fruit that came to
[2:24:32] maturity, the word of God made flesh.
[2:24:36] and and brother James Hayes, a dear
[2:24:38] friend of mine, uh
[2:24:41] uh shared the scripture with me one day,
[2:24:44] and it's it's always been a part of me
[2:24:46] ever since. And he says, "And we have
[2:24:50] known and believed the love that God
[2:24:55] hath to
[2:24:58] us." We have known and believe the love
[2:25:02] that God has to us.
[2:25:06] The first word that was ever really
[2:25:08] spoke to
[2:25:09] me, if you want to say in the form of a
[2:25:12] prophecy or a
[2:25:15] Christian speaking to
[2:25:18] me and the believers, they looked at me
[2:25:21] and they said, "God really loves
[2:25:26] you." And they said, "No, you don't
[2:25:29] understand. God really loves you."
[2:25:33] They wanted they they recognized it.
[2:25:36] They wanted me to understand
[2:25:39] it. I know there was a reason for it.
[2:25:44] But that that
[2:25:45] became the foundation of
[2:25:49] everything, my survival,
[2:25:52] my getting through everything that I got
[2:25:56] through was the fact that he loved me.
[2:26:01] We love him. Amen. Because he first
[2:26:05] loved us. And our brother said it
[2:26:07] tonight. Everything you're going to do
[2:26:09] to go forward, you've got to go back to
[2:26:13] the fact that he loved you. Our
[2:26:16] messenger put it this way. There's only
[2:26:18] one place that God meets the believer.
[2:26:21] That's under the shed blood. And it
[2:26:23] ain't the like the shed blood like you
[2:26:25] think. It's the love that caused him to
[2:26:29] lay down his life. That's where he meets
[2:26:32] you is under the love of that shed
[2:26:35] blood. And what is this all about? It's
[2:26:38] all about us going into that capstone
[2:26:41] and having that love one for another. He
[2:26:43] says, "And we have known and believed
[2:26:47] the love that God hath to us." God is
[2:26:52] love, and he that dwelleth in love
[2:26:56] dwelleth in God. And God
[2:27:00] in
[2:27:04] him. And herein is our love made
[2:27:08] perfect that we may have
[2:27:15] boldness in the day of judgment.
[2:27:19] Hallelujah.
[2:27:21] That we may have boldness. Our brother
[2:27:23] said that tonight. That we may have
[2:27:25] boldness in the day of judgment. Because
[2:27:29] as he is,
[2:27:33] so are we in this world.
[2:27:37] Hallelujah.
[2:27:40] You want to go forward.
[2:27:44] People are wanting this and wanting that
[2:27:46] and produce this. You put the love of
[2:27:49] God in your heart, it'll do more than
[2:27:51] you can ever imagine.
[2:27:55] It'll it'll even allow you to forgive
[2:27:58] yourself.
[2:28:01] And I'll tell you, there's nothing in in
[2:28:04] looking back. I appreciated tonight's
[2:28:08] message. Amen.
[2:28:10] For a lots and lots of different reasons
[2:28:13] that I could
[2:28:15] never
[2:28:17] express. But I believe the whole
[2:28:20] church
[2:28:22] world, the bride, when I say the church,
[2:28:26] I believe the whole bride is turning
[2:28:28] that corner. Amen. Into that divine
[2:28:31] love. And the people aren't going to be
[2:28:34] divided by the ministry anymore.
[2:28:39] They have an absolute
[2:28:41] [Music]
[2:28:44] And not only did they have the book, but
[2:28:49] God gave them the divine interpretation
[2:28:51] of the book. And he gave them the
[2:28:54] example of the life that follows the
[2:28:57] word when you take it. And if we would
[2:29:01] all focus our eyes on that
[2:29:04] and
[2:29:05] just everything's church, you'll get
[2:29:09] well just coming into church, having
[2:29:12] someone hug you.
[2:29:17] You know, I was talking to brother and
[2:29:21] Joseph
[2:29:22] and and Sister Sarah and and and I I
[2:29:28] hope this doesn't sound wrong, but I
[2:29:30] know Sister Sarah's got a deep godly
[2:29:32] Christian love for me. She looked over
[2:29:35] at her husband says, "Go pray for
[2:29:37] him." You know, and I wanted to look
[2:29:40] back and said, "Sarah, you can lay your
[2:29:42] hand on me, too.
[2:29:46] And and that's the spirit, church. We
[2:29:48] can walk in this. Yes, sir.
[2:29:52] Everybody wonders what the Holy Spirit
[2:29:54] is. The Holy Spirit's God. Amen. And God
[2:29:58] is love.
[2:30:01] He that walketh in love walketh in God.
[2:30:06] And you'll only know the love when you
[2:30:09] start knowing how much he loved you and
[2:30:11] where he's taken you from. And so I I
[2:30:15] just thought it was great. And and
[2:30:19] uh so I don't know if there's anybody in
[2:30:22] here that has a need
[2:30:25] tonight. Maybe you've had bitterness in
[2:30:28] your
[2:30:30] heart and you just like
[2:30:33] that bitterness to go
[2:30:36] away. Maybe there's been something
[2:30:38] terrible happened in your life and
[2:30:41] you're tired of it having a
[2:30:44] shackle on
[2:30:46] you and you don't want it to. You want
[2:30:49] to go
[2:30:50] free. There's nobody here tonight going
[2:30:53] to judge
[2:30:56] you. But don't don't
[2:30:59] don't stay
[2:31:02] there. I always love the story of the
[2:31:05] prodal
[2:31:06] son because that's what I feel I've
[2:31:09] always been all my life.
[2:31:12] And then I finally dig myself out of the
[2:31:14] hole and I'm so ashamed of all the
[2:31:17] places I've been and I run to him and
[2:31:20] and I think I got to start at the
[2:31:23] bottom and I got to start all over again
[2:31:26] and I've got to work my way back up and
[2:31:29] and I got to prove to everybody
[2:31:31] everything I done wrong. You know what
[2:31:33] he does? He comes and slaughters the
[2:31:36] calf. That's right. In other words, he
[2:31:38] brings me back to the land.
[2:31:42] And then he puts the coat on me and
[2:31:45] he he gets the garment
[2:31:49] and brings me back and restores
[2:31:53] me as a
[2:31:56] son. There had to be a reason this was
[2:31:58] the age of
[2:32:01] restoration. So I hope your heart's
[2:32:03] tender tonight.
[2:32:05] I hope
[2:32:07] you realize
[2:32:11] that this isn't our
[2:32:15] home. And so no matter what failures
[2:32:18] that you've had in this life, I hope
[2:32:21] that you say tonight in your
[2:32:23] heart, I'm leaving that behind. I'm
[2:32:26] going to press for that higher
[2:32:29] mark. I'm going to make it. He said I
[2:32:33] could. He paid a price for me. I have
[2:32:36] the ticket. And as our brother said, he
[2:32:38] put the ticket in this heart. And that
[2:32:41] heart calls for the
[2:32:44] train. It wants to run to that station
[2:32:46] and get on
[2:32:47] board. So I want you to know you're my
[2:32:50] brothers and sisters. I don't care what
[2:32:53] you've done, where you've been, what you
[2:32:56] said. I want to be there with you.
[2:32:59] That's right. I don't want to have
[2:33:00] nobody that's not there.
[2:33:03] And I hope that this is the spirit that
[2:33:06] God sees in our
[2:33:08] heart. And like Paul said, though I
[2:33:11] understand all the mysteries and I
[2:33:14] speak with the tongues of men and angels
[2:33:17] and I understand all prophecy and I have
[2:33:20] not charity. I'm
[2:33:23] nothing. And I think tonight's message
[2:33:26] was God hid. People say it's simple, but
[2:33:30] that's where God's always been. Do you
[2:33:33] love him tonight? I don't know if
[2:33:35] there's anybody here that needs prayer.
[2:33:38] I want to pray because the
[2:33:40] atmosphere's here. If you're sick or you
[2:33:43] need healing, it's fine. If you don't,
[2:33:47] I'm I'm glad that you don't. You know, I
[2:33:50] would rather have a healthy church than
[2:33:52] a sick church that needed prayer.
[2:33:56] It means we had a good communion
[2:33:59] service. Amen. So everybody's good. Our
[2:34:02] brother wants prayer. So
[2:34:06] uh you're going to don't worry about
[2:34:09] that calling all the time, brother. You
[2:34:11] just got to do it. Anyway, we just pray
[2:34:14] for you. Anybody else needs prayer?
[2:34:18] Amen. Brother Isaiah, would you come and
[2:34:20] pray with me for our prayers?
[2:34:28] in his
[2:34:34] time. In his
[2:34:38] [Music]
[2:34:40] time, he makes all
[2:34:45] things
[2:34:47] beautiful in his style.
[2:34:54] Oh, and Lord, please show
[2:34:59] me every
[2:35:01] day as you're
[2:35:05] teaching me your
[2:35:08] way. Oh, that you'll do just what you
[2:35:16] say in your time.
[2:35:20] Oh, and in your
[2:35:22] time. In your
[2:35:28] time. Oh, in your
[2:35:34] time. Oh, and you make all
[2:35:41] things
[2:35:43] beautiful in your time.

[2:35:57] bring
[2:35:59] each song I have to sing. Oh, be to you
[2:36:08] a
[2:36:09] lovely
[2:36:11] thing in your time.
[2:36:16] Oh, in your time.
[2:36:19] In your
[2:36:23] time. Oh, and in your time.
[2:36:31] Oh, and you make all
[2:36:36] things
[2:36:38] beautiful in your
[2:36:42] [Music]
[2:36:44] time. Oh, and Lord, my life to you. I
[2:36:53] bring each song I have to sing.
[2:37:01] to our lovely.
[2:37:06] [Music]

[2:37:17] wretch. I remember who I
[2:37:21] was. I was lost.

[3:01:51] Thank you so much
[3:01:54] for standing there praying with each
[3:01:57] need that came up. And you know, it
[3:02:01] takes us all. You never know. I You
[3:02:05] never know. you're just sitting there
[3:02:07] praying. But you know, so when that lady
[3:02:10] came up to brother Brandham, he looked
[3:02:11] at her and he says, "Oh, you're already
[3:02:13] healed."
[3:02:15] That lady way up there in the
[3:02:18] balcony when she prayed for you was all
[3:02:22] over. So, you know, we might have stood
[3:02:26] here, but it was your love
[3:02:30] that called him on the scene.
[3:02:34] And we can't share that glory. We can't
[3:02:38] go around and say, "I laid my hands on
[3:02:40] this person. I laid my hand when the
[3:02:43] work was already done 2,000 years ago
[3:02:46] and the price was already paid." So may
[3:02:51] he
[3:02:52] receive all the glory tonight. God bless
[3:02:55] you. We ask you to pray for Sunday
[3:02:58] service and and
[3:03:01] uh and keep brother Isaiah in your heart
[3:03:05] for whatever road the the Lord has in
[3:03:10] front of him
[3:03:12] and and the simplicity of God's word.
[3:03:16] There's always the victory. And pray for
[3:03:20] one another. Amen. And pray that
[3:03:23] every person
[3:03:25] that comes into our fellowship has the
[3:03:30] opportunity to have the spirit of
[3:03:32] God fill their heart with his
[3:03:36] love. And so we just pray that. So let's
[3:03:41] pray together as we're dismissed
[3:03:42] tonight. our gracious
[3:03:47] father. Lord, we need so many
[3:03:50] victories in our life
[3:03:53] that we could line up our problems and
[3:03:58] every time we found one problem, we'd
[3:04:02] find two
[3:04:04] more. And pretty soon, Lord, we'd have a
[3:04:07] stack of problems
[3:04:10] and a list of things that we need to fix
[3:04:15] about ourselves.
[3:04:18] And we start going back through time and
[3:04:21] we'd have so much to make
[3:04:26] right that we could bury
[3:04:30] ourselves in our inadequacies.
[3:04:37] the history book of our mistakes would
[3:04:39] become
[3:04:43] unreadable. But Lord, if when we just
[3:04:46] sit
[3:04:48] and we gaze upon you for a
[3:04:52] moment and we think about how much you
[3:04:55] loved
[3:04:57] us and that while we were yet a
[3:05:01] sinner, you died for us.
[3:05:05] knowing the beginning and the end of the
[3:05:13] book and you said, "Father, forgive
[3:05:19] them." Lord, and I pray that each of us
[3:05:23] tonight would accept that
[3:05:25] pardon and we would leave this building
[3:05:28] tonight different.
[3:05:32] And Lord, as I've tried to preach the
[3:05:35] the best of my ability and I'm so
[3:05:38] insufficient,
[3:05:40] Father, but this is an hour of change.
[3:05:44] And all you're looking for is us to
[3:05:47] change. And may every person walk out of
[3:05:52] here
[3:05:53] tonight changed
[3:05:56] for the
[3:05:57] better. And may we continue to walk in
[3:06:02] the spirit as you are in the
[3:06:05] spirit. And I just pray, Father, that
[3:06:08] the words that were speaking tonight
[3:06:10] become life. They become
[3:06:14] habit. They become
[3:06:16] reality. And I ask it in the most
[3:06:19] wonderful name that's ever been spoken
[3:06:21] in this
[3:06:22] earth. The precious name of our Lord and
[3:06:25] Savior Jesus Christ. bless us now as we
[3:06:30] go in Jesus name. Amen. Do you love him
[3:06:34] tonight?
[3:06:36] Amen. Amen. Let's just sing that song. I
[3:06:39] like so many time that if you're walking
[3:06:43] right. Amen. We'll sing that as our
[3:06:46] dismissal song.
[3:06:52] [Music]
[3:06:59] If you're
[3:07:01] walking through the
[3:07:04] valley and there's
[3:07:06] shadows all
[3:07:10] around, do not
[3:07:13] fear. He will guide
[3:07:16] you. He will keep you safe.
[3:07:21] Now listen because he
[3:07:25] promised to ever leave
[3:07:28] you nor forsake
[3:07:31] you and his word is true. God is
[3:07:37] good all the time.
[3:07:41] You put a song of praise in this part of
[3:07:46] life. God is
[3:07:49] good all the
[3:07:52] time. Through the
[3:07:55] darkness, his light will shine. God is
[3:08:01] good. God is
[3:08:04] good all the
[3:08:07] time. We will sing.
[3:08:10] Amen. So
[3:08:13] unworthy. So for us
[3:08:16] [Music]
[3:08:19] it fail
[3:08:22] with his holy
[3:08:25] spirit. Now we can stand and testify.
[3:08:30] Amen. For that his
[3:08:34] love, his
[3:08:37] everlasting and his
[3:08:40] mercy they will never end. God is
[3:08:49] good. They put us
[3:08:53] on
[3:08:55] my God is
[3:08:58] good all the time.
[3:09:02] The darkest night and light will shine.
[3:09:08] God is
[3:09:10] good. God
[3:09:13] is all
[3:09:16] [Music]
[3:10:08] Oh,
[3:10:14] [Music]
