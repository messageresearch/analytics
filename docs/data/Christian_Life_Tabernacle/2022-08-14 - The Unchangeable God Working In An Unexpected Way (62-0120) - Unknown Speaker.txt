come forth in our heart Lord we just ask you to bless us this evening in your precious and most wonderful name we pray amen amen let's just read that scripture that we read this morning real quick and then uh the any Ephesians the fifth chapter and and that and it says that 25th verse husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious Church to not have any spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word and your precious name amen God bless you may be seated we were talking this morning just for a little bit and I just want to make this one little statement before that we go into what we're going to listen to this evening and so you we know that a prophet of God many times used the the bearing of children of of the seed being in the father then going to bedding ground of mother and then coming forth and then God could have Fellowship because the seed of God came forth and then this is what the prophet of God said he says now then now now you can have fellowship with him you couldn't back there because you were just a word in him a seed so at one time you were a word in God right but now he has manifested you that's right and now he wants you to fellowship with him then he came down and was made flesh so he could perfectly Fellowship with you see the perfect Fellowship oh my them deep mysteries of God how wonderful see how that God could not Fellowship in the spirit so God became flesh with man now I looked at that and I thought I I it's just when I begin to to see all that God is going to do for his church because he spoke it you know you we know we talk about sowing a field right or a farmer goes out there and he looks out there and it's all planted and he says look at my Field of Corn because he knows by the laws of nature right right that with the water in the sun that's going to come up and produce corn well God looked at you the same way he knew you were there he planted you and he knows that you're going to come up to exactly what he planted with watering and the son which is the what the word through spirit and word God will make you and so he's manifesting you now so this evening I'd just like to listen with you and then I want to read something at the end to you just a small portion of a message called the unchangeable god working in unexpected ways now this is full of nuggets it's one of those sermons where brother Graham's just giving out little uh how could I say it procedural nuggets a little secrets and sayings to get the job done and we'll just listen to a small portion we'll do and so uh it's 5 30 now we should be done by 6 30. okay Lord willing so I think you'll enjoy this we won't stand for the reading because brother bam just quotes just a few uh seconds so uh yeah I don't know if you can pull that up on your phones your devices just put them in airplane mode all right that's I'm getting technical you notice that I'm becoming a scientific preacher you know you laugh at me but I used to go down and print out what we were going to read and bring it to church and then someone looked at me said Dad they all have smartphones they can just pull it up well now we can read it on the board and and you can look at it so let's just listen to this next few minutes the unchangeable God but he works in unexpected ways so we and you say why are you playing this because we know that God has got to change us right he's got to prepare us for the Rapture he's got to bring us in rapturing condition there's only one thing that could do that and that was the word of God but he's got power to make that word come alive in you you can beat yourself on the head trying to make the word to come alive a sheep doesn't manufacture wool it Bears wool God changes your nature your nature does the work so let's just listen for a few minutes I believe you'll be best listen close grab every little secret that he says and I think that your art you'll be blessed so God bless you let's just listen for the next few moments Malachi the third chapter and the first phase of the sixth verse I want to take a reading for I am the Lord I change not I want to take a little subject if it be pleasing to the Lord call the unchangeable god Works in an unexpected way the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way now we are living in a changing time everything is changing just everything that you can look at and see with your eyes come out of the Earth in its material and it starts changing a few days ago when I first come to Phoenix I my first visit to Phoenix was 35 years ago this coming September and I lived out on the desert on 16th and Henshaw and I went down there and the the house is gone there's a filling station in the city sets there and also the road had been changed from Hinshaw to the Buckeye Road well there'd be nowhere ever finding it if it just wouldn't happen to asked around and that's happened in 35 years everything is so different and I remember of going out where the big Salt River Valley Project is a young fellow and I owned horses chasing some Burrows now it's a park down there so Phoenix has grown from Mountain to Mountain it's filled over the country and it's uh it's had a quite a change you'd hardly know your way around I got here I think the population is around 35 or 40 000 people today it's a half a million how that this place has changed it goes as short goes right with the times it changes just as time changes Phoenix changes other places change and then we also know that roads I noticed that chains the roads you used to come in on they don't they're not there no more they've gone some other way you try to follow the trail you once come in you get lost ran out into the desert somewhere so the roads has changed the cities changed and politics has changed they're constantly changing year after year politics uh changed and nations are changing the Nations year by year change they change your attitude they change their program and I noticed the scenes change as the places they cut out the timber they pulled down the mountain and the uh down in Florida they go out you go down and go along the coast and first time you go down there there's not a thing as Coastal water the next time they've done made an island out there somewhere and got a new big homes built on it making man-made Islands putting a big pump down in the sea and pulling up the waters spraying it up and then leveling it out with bulldozers and things and planting a city on top of it and some homes making Islands blasting off the top of the mountains out here war look like hardly a rabbit could go and they got they got houses up on there it's worth a hundred thousand dollars scenes change and we notice people change it's got so that people today are not friendly like they used to be I don't know whether you notice that you're not but we sure notice it back in the south and east people are changing year by year they're too much of a hurry they just got to hurry up and get this done and run down the road 90 miles an hour Bumper to Bumper and stopping a beer joint drink a couple hours before they go home it's in a hurry where are they going you notice most of the women today has wash machines and electric irons and push button dishwashers and everything like that and yet they got less time to pray than they ever had right you know Suzanne Wesley had 17 children and she with them 17 children packing the water from a spring and washing on her hands and yet she could find two or three hours a day to pray with her children with 17 little fellas and out of there come a John and a Charles that's what's the matter today reason our schools are letting down no ministers coming in young men interested we I won't need some more praying fathers and mothers it's what we need to make our schools fill up young man's heart burning with Zeal to take the gospel it's what we need but things are changing we could go a little farther to people and bring in the church church is changing we find it and our churches are changing we are really more or less I'm talking universally now that we are more seen to be more interested in getting numbers then we are getting people saved this looks like that everybody wants to get the biggest number or have the biggest church or the biggest building or make the biggest denomination or or something instead of thinking of the poor lost soul that's too bad but there's too many of us are doing that I heard the noted evangelist brother Billy Graham when he was at Louisville Kentucky I was invited with Dr martikai Ham a personal friend of mine that Billy was saved under his preaching and I was invited to set at the breakfast with him and Mr Graham and he's a forceful speaking said I go into a city and I'll have stayed there six weeks said I'll have maybe 20 000 people that'll make their their confession and said I'll get all their tickets and so forth and give them to the ministers and so then another year coming back said I'll go around and where I had 20 000 converts when I was there that year the next year I can't even find 20. I said what's the matter and he I were different just a little bit not to be different with that great evangelist Mr Graham certainly not but the way that he approached it by saying what's the matter and he pointed his finger out and said too many lazy preachers he said sit around with your feet on the desk of a daytime and night and don't take these cards and follow up he said when Paul was here he went into the City and had one convert and come back to next year you had 30 or 40 by that one the egg great great great great grandchildren over to see and he said I have thirty thousand and come back or Twenty Thousand come back can't find 20. well it might have been because of I'm Pentecostal and but I wanted to say this so bad that a Harley could hold my peace but I thought what lazy preacher put his feet up on the bench when Paul got him saved see it was that convert himself that was led deep enough into God until he got a hope and if a man really gets a hold of God God gets into the man's heart don't worry Sparks will be flying from every side because he's deep enough in God in his whole life is rooted and grounded in Christ therefore we know that it isn't just lazy preachers it's because that the the convert doesn't go deep enough till he loses the side of the world in the things of the world if he ever gets close enough to God he doesn't do that but we find out that the churches change and the people changes the roads changes the scenes changes the politics changes but there's one thing that does not change that's God Amen he Remains the Same I am God and I change not no matter how long it is God has never changed one bit and he can not change what a place the reason he cannot change is because God is infinite and anything that's infinite cannot change and then let us study this just for a moment before approaching on into the scriptures infinite is infinite there's there's no beginning or no end he is Almighty omnipotent omnipresent omnit Mission knows all things all places all times all powerful he's God and he cannot change now I can make a decision and say it's going to be this way and I'm finite I'll have to change because things come up that I I'll have to say well I was wrong but God can't do that because his one decision is that far ever he cannot change his decisions it cannot change it therefore if God's attitude towards one Sinner and wanted to repent Adam and Eve and God made a way for them to repent and he forgave that sinner and the next sinner comes God's got to do the same thing to that sinner or he did wrong when he acted with the first sinner and if a man was sick and God healed one man and then if ever another man comes to God he's got to do the same thing or he did wrong when he healed the first one if he comes on the same ground what a resting place then for the soul that seeking Refuge now in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God now we wonder how the the world ever got here see the the word of God created the world Hebrews 11 tells us that the world was made out of things this does not appear see God spoke it into existence because he was God he just said let there be and it was so therefore if in the beginning was the word and the word spoken was a creative word and every word that's spoken cannot be taken back for a mistake then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us which is Christ and now the word of God written in the Bible is his word to us in every promise has the same power of creation behind it that God's word did at the beginning if we believe it to be the word of God depends on where the seed Falls if it falls into ground a ground that can create a moisture or a nourishment around the promise of God will bring forth every promise the Bible made it's just this why the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass right if you just look at it and take care of the word just right because the infinite God spoke it God's word Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away oh how we ought to rest upon that Divine promise of the son of God who said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away there is a resting place for the soul now Jesus said in the word Jesus said uh if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it but sometimes when God performs something it does something that we ask for and yet we don't it comes in an unexpected way and sometimes in an unexpected place and at an unexpected time but God will answer in his own way if you just believe it you must believe it accept it and then don't take it back hold on to it lay hold of it and say this is it amen God said it that settles it if God said so that's finished no matter how long there might not have been one molecule uh come into existence when he says Let There be for a world buddy he's eternal and after a while become molecules and atoms and it come up because he said it to be that way and here's a promise to that we can think if he the one that said that has brought every word to pass then he's going to have a church to appear before him without spot or wrinkles amen and it's going to behoove us brother sister well to really be sure that we are right with God and then because there's going to be a church and we want to be part of that church no matter what this is you're on Earth we are looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God and we can't afford to lose that whatever you do don't forget that no matter what the neighbor does what the other fella does what your schoolmate does or watch your husband or your wife or anyone else it's a a personal affair with you and God you must you just must seek out that salvation your father might have been a great man your mother a great man but what about you see see it's you you must have it your own self all right now when Jesus said if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it now that's just right straight down off of the shoulder I will do it and he was now its own conditions if you'll believe when you ask now Mark 11 22 we find out that Jesus said if you say to this mountain be thou plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you've said okay now now the thing you just couldn't get out here and say Mountain moved down you've got to have a motive and objective to that right and that's you got to find out first if it's the will of God and then your emotive and objective to the will of God and then speak to it and stand there it'll come down yeah you see if you get the conditions right but you've got to have the conditions right now you must remember also that when God answers sometime it's in an unexpected way he's unchangeable but he does things in unexpected ways now let's just call up a case or two before we proceed let's think of Moses I like to study Moses he was such a gallant man and he gave us the Old Testament through the power of God and many times a skeptic say now Moses wrote that and um how do we know it's right well you can go back and prove that it's right and if he who could say what has been and or what will be and what was to take place after him and that come to pass and I believe that that was right also is here amen see there's like a if we can stand here on uh in the church I am the Holy Spirit can go back down to your life and tell you what was and you know where that's truth or not well if you know and know it that's the truth then surely you could believe what he tells you will come to pass we'll be there because this Bears record for that and that's true and so we see as a Witnesses of Hebrews 11 and many places in the Bible that The Heroes of Faith are those who stayed with God's promise just stay right there no matter what anyone else said and God will grant it to you in his own good time now Moses went down into Egypt or was in Egypt rather he was born down there proper child his parents see he was a scene that he was and there was afraid of the king's commandment a man when Moses taught by his mother what a good teacher or his own mother and kept telling them stories Moses you are my son but you were born for a purpose and God will use you someday to deliver Israel now to the death of of uh his precious mother then I suppose Moses become a great ruler are next to Pharaoh there was heir to the throne then one day he felt for his brethren and a feeling sometime for something yet even if we feel we've got to act in God's ways to rightly get the job done certainly now I believe that God has mercy upon all the hungry and suffering and and we have all kinds of of uh organizations to feed the hungry and things I believe that's a wonderful thing but yet the real job is the gospel that's the real job is the gospel taking the gospel now we find out that after he found himself of failure in his own works because he was a smart man a military man and he was he had found a failure then he he run from the job went out into the Wilderness and was out there for 40 years and he had a a wife and so forth and his children or his child rather gershom now the strange thing is with a call of God on his life I'd imagine Moses was never able to get away from that that's right never able and there may be people here tonight listening right to us that down to your life somewhere you felt there was a call in your life and you've just never heeded to it you'll be miserable as long as you live till you heed to that mind and there's no doubt there's people here tonight that's been seeking for the Holy Ghost for years and you just say well I I don't know how I should receive it uh well you'll never never be satisfied until you do see because you were cut out for that and now you must make that the first thing in your life whether you eat again or whether you drink again or whether you sleep again or whatever you do you must find that that's right that must be the first thing just stay right with God's promise he promised it to you so you stay right with it see and God will bring it to pass now and he might do it at an unexpected time you say well brother Brandon I've been working hard today and I'm a little tired and I haven't felt good for three four days that might be just the time you never know when it's going to happen how many times could I stop in for days to tell the experience want to go to the woods to seek the Lord that the the Briar scratch me and the birds oh no I mean the mosquitoes bite me that's just when God's fixing to do something right then this one um just when something seems all unexpected thank God takes place takes hold now look at Moses Moses this great old sheep heard her now he was already 80 years old he was 40. before he took his sand for God and then he hurried sheep out there and I guess he was 40 years in the desert and he's uh getting to be an old man perhaps great whiskers and long flowing gray hair and Yuri was not in church he was under Mount Horeb and God never come down to a sermon but in a burning bush see an unexpected time an unexpected place and in an unexpected way why he thought God would meet him out there with this stick in his hand or sword or whatever he kill the Egyptian with but God met him not even in church under the mountain God made him not in the hymns but in a burning bush and not when he was a young man but when he was an old man God called him after he was 80 years old think of it so sometimes we think because we're 35 or 40 whatever you are you're never too old you got a soul it's got to live forever so just remember it's always that way a God the unchangeable god in an unexpected time and unexpected way in an unexpected Place let's take Jacob Jacob was running he got caught between two fires now he was going home and Lebanon his father-in-law was coming this way after him because his wife had stole their gods and then he finds out Esau's coming this way after him his brother who he had cheated now that was quite an unexpected time for God to visit him but he was here come Lebanon this way and here come Elena coming this way and he saw this way but Jacob crossed the Little Brook and then he got down to business and maybe for the first time in his life he got a hold of something that was real and he was able to hold on until the blessing comes that would be a great lesson for all of us when you once get a hold of something that's real hold to it amen don't turn it loose Hallelujah no matter how many times the Sun Passes over or whatever takes place how many hungry pains comes whatever more hold on to it until you are blessed of it until you have the promise of it back hold on he put his wife and all the way from him and separated himself and held on because he was caught between two fires and God met him in an unexpected way in an unexpected time in an unexpected place that's where God met him Isaiah the prophet a young fellow had leaned upon the good King's arm and he was a good man and he had had things easy but one day the king died in Isaiah the prophet went down to the altar in the house of God and while he was praying there he was caught between his own sins and Division and he screamed out whoa is me when he seen the angels with wings over their faces Wings over their feet and flying crying holy holy holy unto the Lord he cried wow is me for I'm a man of unclean lips he was caught in an unexpected time an unexpected place he thought I'd go down and say my prayers and get up and go on because people believe I'm a good preacher or Pastor or something everybody was caught there Not only was he caught in this condition with a vision but he was caught with unclean lips In The House of the Living God oh brother if that would search out through this city tonight and tomorrow morning of ministers who would stand and tell you that there is no such a thing as Divine Healing and there's no such a thing as the baptism the Holy Spirit there'd be some more crying out worries me with unclean lips true yes very much so the Hebrew children now they were caught in quite a predicament too they were caught in an unexpected place where they met God for God to come to him in a fiery furnace unexpected time an unexpected way but God is the inchangeable God unchangeable God and he does things that way any unexpectable place unexpectable time and so forth Israel asked for a mighty king they wanted a King to deliver them that's what they expected God to send to them was a King to deliver them a mighty king that would March like David the son of David would rise up come down the corners of Heaven walk down to the Earth the full Angel salute and the father will look out of the heaven and say I'm sending down to you now the Messiah and uh they had it all fixed up but that's the way he was supposed to come but what did they get they got a baby instead of a mighty king a baby born in a a little stable the side of a hillside a little cave stable with straw and the manure from the animals and a a baby but it was the answer of their prayer he was exactly what they needed amen but they wanted it in their own way yeah look they want it the way they they thought was best but God knows how to set it in the way that he knows his best because he's an infinite God and he knows just how to send it he knows your needs he knows how to bring it to you but the trouble of it is because it don't come the way you think it ought to come then you're all discouraged and you hand it back to him let's ask him and believe that he'll send it just the way he wants it and accepts it upon the bases right if you ask him don't make him a liar he can't lie he promises to Father anything in my name I'll do it man God can't lie I assuming it it shall be done man seek ye shall find knock it'll be open we believe that certainly we do they got a major so what did they do had this little baby in the manger is that the mighty king they refused thee yes sir why he didn't come the way they expected him to come and friends you might think that was a horrible thing it was but you know we're guilty of the same thing we are guilty of the same thing we ask God for things and then we walk around and if you don't just pour something on us and give us something that uh we think we ought to have then we just hand it back see don't do that ask him stay right with it hold on to it if you know it's real and then what's more real than the word of God and the word of God is made flesh and dwelt Among Us Christ and now Christ sent the Holy Spirit and he is God in spirit so then hold on to it if the holy spirit's here and give us that promise stay with it with us Pentecostal people who profess to have the Holy Ghost and afraid to trust God anywhere we expect it in some other way I think that what we're doing I'll tell you the truth I think we're expecting it God to come in and Bloom us out in a great big organization of this type and that time and when you do you build complex against the other fella the thing we ought to do brother is forget about that your organizations are fine but what we want is born-again Christians with salvation their heart and the power of the Holy Ghost in that and I have feelings for one another glorious feelings hopes of feelings and brotherly affections that binds us together that's what God wants us to have he's the infinite God and he cannot change his words he cannot change them now watch so they refused him because he didn't come the way that he they expected it to be and we noticed that he did come in the scriptural form he come exactly according to the the scriptural plan in each one of these did also at the right place at the right time and in the right way God always does it in his way and it's the right way now Moses why would he doubt he was called at Birth he was a baby when God called him he was born in this world for a purpose he is Born the prophet ought not to be no hard thing for Moses to think that be unexpected because you ought to be expecting God to call him Jacob God just spoke to him and said Jacob return home I'll be with you and multiply you I will make your seeds like this Sands of the sea why was he so so unexpected then for God to come to him that night when Laban was coming one way and he saw another yet God promised him time amen amen hallelujah there you are friends when God makes a promise in the opposition rise that's only their test whether you really got the word or not the man that's got good gold don't mind going to the touching Stone thing that's true see it's only a Peter said I believe it was that these trials are come to test us Trust see what we'll do with it right when you get the Holy Ghost and and husbands go run you out of the house or or mother's gonna make you leave home them things don't give up go back into the world that's only a testing time Jacob he ought to know better than that but he had kind of wasted a lot of his life away and running around and so forth from here to there and he I like what he said there I crossed this Jordan with only a staff and now I'll come back in two armies come back so multiplied and he said here's Esau my brother coming this way and my father-in-law is over here after me and that when he got in that kind of a condition but he went to the right place and began to unexpectingly I guess to get the answer but God came down and he had a wrestling match and stayed with God and held on until a blessing God I like Jacob in this way when he actually seen something that was right when he got his hand on something that was true he held on to it until he got results yeah oh if we would do that if the church would only do that if you'd only be convinced that it's right I know it's God's promise and it cannot fail you just it cannot fail someone talk you out of it say it's a for some other generation it wasn't for us and that that is a scripture Jesus said in Mark 60 going into all the world preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them that believe see for high for all the world every creature these signs shall follow in all the world to every creature that believes Peter said on the day of Pentecost father promise isn't to you and to your children and to them it's far off even as men is the Lord Our God shall call amen how you going to do it the gospel must be preached and it's all all the world beginning at Jerusalem Luke 24 49 he said Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you're due with power from on high after the Holy Ghost acts I want a holy ghost has come upon you then you'll be Witnesses of me in Judea Samara and to the uttermost parts of the earth everywhere the Holy Spirit bearing record with signs and wonders how are we going to get away from it it's God's promise don't let the devily Slick tongue as he can be in a very seemingly a scriptural red person but he twists it to make it say something that it doesn't say and yet the Bible said it's so plain that even a fool shouldn't Airy in the way right just take a hold of God's promise and hold on to it hold on to that one until you get a hold of another when you see this an answer then get a hold of this one then hold on to that until you get another one then just keep on climbing is that juare was singing last night down to the other Church the brother Outlaws Church saying uh first round was regeneration and he kept on another and got somewhere else and yeah after his while he went past the Mars Jupiter and hit the milky white wind just kept on going I like that see just keep climbing round by round take a hold of God's promise say God you promised to save me hold on to it stay right there until you're saved God you promise to fill me with the Holy Ghost stay right there till you feel what the Holy Ghost if you're sick say you promised to heal me I'm staying right here till you heal me there you are that's the way to do it stay with us God is infinite he's unchangeable he cannot change and he does it in unexpected ways but hold on until time don't tell God watch how you want him to do it he'll do it the way he wants to do it don't tell him how to do it now what now we find out that Isaiah was born the prophet now he was in the line of duty when he was down there at the altar he was no strange thing for a prophet to see a vision so he ought to remember he was right in the line of duty so he wasn't out of the scripture he was right in the scripture God said if there be one among you spiritual the prophet all the Lord God will make myself known unto him what this Prophet says comes to pass then hear him if it don't refuse him so see Jacob is in the line of the scripture Moses in the line of the scripture and um Elijah let's take Elijah here I'd like to say to him now he got out there in the wilderness and got Moody and God sent him fed him with an angel and put him in the wilderness and he wandered for 40 days a night and the first thing you know what happened he'd come up back in the cave and the prophet back there he heard the Russian wind splashing blowing you heard the rocks are roaring everything he thought well that's that's all right I've been up on Mount Carmel I know he answers the Thunder and the lightning and the rain I know it but what got the prophet was that unexpected still Small Voice there's work makes so many of us Pentecostal people jump see we are expecting something some other way when God brings it in his own way see we think that it uh we are coming the way we expect it but God sends it in his own way the way he wants to do it do it now Jesus when they asked for a king Isaiah 9 6 he said unto us a child is born the son is given his government should be upon his shoulders uh virgins shall conceive and bring forth a child you'll be called Emmanuel and while he come exactly in the line of the scriptures man did he just exactly what the scripture said Moses was lined up but it didn't come the way he thought it would he thought I would kill that Egyptian ah that'll be it then all the children of Israel say so and so he see he's our conqueror but it didn't come that way but he was still in his line of the scriptures Jacob all the rest of them was in line of the scriptures when God worked and if we get ourselves lined up with the word of God and hold on to it yes what can us brother Branham what can I do to be lined up with the word of God just take it in your heart and believe it amen every promise is yours it's yours you can have it it belongs to you every promise in the book you sing is mine every chapter ever verse amen I'm trusting in his love divine forever promised in the book of God no matter what the promise is it's yours anyhow because God gave it to you whosoever will let him come and drink from The Fountains of Water of Life freely it's yours it belongs to you any promise belongs to you if you have faith to appropriate it and it'll do it if you'll just believe it I hope you gleaned all the nuggets out of that that were in there I mean but that's some real things right there those things are the things that will help you those are the things you can't run from your call you'll never be happy until you take you you get a hold of it that just so many notes I wrote you know I was real worried about playing playing this and you know the enemies always talking to me about when sister Laurie sang that song I knew that this is exactly what that was what we needed I think it's what we needed uh and uh there's just so many things that he said about holding on to it uh you could just go back and read it but I just wanted to close this evening in reading this testimony because God works in unexpected ways at unexpected times um I got this email from Brother Rob rippath and and uh you know I can say that when I first contacted Rob and Rob made contact with me a few years back he um I could I guess I could just say it the way that it was is he was a pretty hurt and broken man but he got back with God and he started believing God and I just would like to read this to you in closing this evening this is brother to brother McGarry brother McGarry thank you for answering my request and in writing this it's to give the Lord Jesus Christ Glory and his edification so I wrote him and he wrote back and he says I'm writing this for this purpose to give God originally my plan was to attend church and share the wonderful news of what the Lord has done for my co-worker's wife of course things changed a week ago past Monday at my home and I needed to come home for my wife our youngest daughter had moved to Amarillo about three weeks ago and she had no local support keep the testimony accurate I asked Javier in his words to write a brief summary due to the various dates and doctors report this is Rob writing to me I've been witnessing to Jarvis on and off for the past few months as he works directly with me he is a converted Catholic and his wife is Catholic discussing baptism Revelations 10 Luke 17 30 predestination and even touching on serpency my brief summary my co-worker the day before had just returned from vacation in helping with his wife's medical needs in Edmond and I could see he was under a lot of stress as he had kept me abreast of some of that of the details originally suggesting he take another week off to before returning to Waco on the 19th I let him know that I had kept his family in prayer and would continue to do so and offered to pray with him at that moment he asked if I would and we United in prayer as I entered into his burden and took the Lord at his word approaching him according to his word through the shed blood of calvary two or three agree in his name we laid hands of faith upon his wife 350 miles away binding that demon spirit in demanding it to leave in Jesus name asking the great physician to appear that the doctors wouldn't find anything that Jarvis would have a great testimony from the Lord healing of his family and friends thank the Lord for his healing when we were done Jarvis mentioned that he had never heard such a prayer and feeling the presence of the Lord I let him know it wasn't me it was him pointing upward the god I believe in and have found favor to have access to him as I believe in the serving a living God it that there's a difference in approach this was was just another normal work day and I was only doing as led to do at that moment unexpected place unexpected time normal work day I am so grateful to know and to serve the Lord Jesus not anything I've done but for what he has done for me even in this life's difficulties and attacks by the enemy the Lord is leading his people in spite of what the enemy Whispers in our ears praise God another anchor is driven down God bless you and sister Leslie thank you headlines testimony regarding my wife Monica bayoa D Gonzalez health to honor our Lord God Jesus Christ This is a testimony regarding his wife's health to honor the Lord Jesus Christ my name is Javier s Gonzalez my phone number is 405-831-0099 on June 17th my white my my wife went for medical regular checkup during a trip to Columbia South America where she has gone to visit her parents and to ensure our youngest son's language skills develop well to take advantage of his summer vacation during that medical visit her doctor found some unnormal test results in her breast on June 19th further tests were conducted to uh eliminate pitfalls on results on June 23rd she was informed that she had stage two cancer diagnosis on June 27th she received a medical intervention to remove any bad tissue on June 20 9th she went back to the doctor to follow up and to ensure she was okay she was not feeling well during several weeks therefore my family traveled back to the States and on the 10th of July once she thought she was doing a little better and to receive further medical involvement here in the states if needed during all the time our family and I was going through a very difficult trial as understood she is everything to my kids and to me on July 15th she visited a doctor in Oklahoma and received further tests to ensure not bad tissue to ensure not bad tissue was still present to our precise the results to our surprise the results came back positive therefore she was going to have to go through another surgery on July 19th Rob and I got together and Rob prayed to God I felt an amazing touch and a huge relief once he finished asking God for his Healing Hand I was in tears a couple days later once my wife called me to let me know her test results indicated she was cancer-free subsequently she has been tested again twice in the same negative result she is still recovering from those turbulent times and is doing much better I hope I am understood as I am grateful writing this note to testify of the power of the prayer and especially to the power of God I have told Rob that he is a very special human but he humbly replied it is not me it's all the glory to him thank you for taking time to read this testimony thank you days of Miracles aren't over they're just not coming or I should say they are coming in unexpected ways at unexpected times in unexpected places it was just a normal day at work and a brother felt led to pray with another brother and he said I followed all the points all the things that were laid down were ever two are great together he built the foundation on the word and and I know this brother he he struggles with importance he struggles with calm you know but yet God manifested and took his prayer and this man testified that that brother's prayer God honored that prayer and my wife is healed and so I could go back through this book and read quote to you after quotes we don't give up don't let down hold to the word keep climbing all the things that were said in there how much they apply how he talked about what the church should be and and and and that's what we're the voice to so you you never know when God could come on the scene but just line up with the word line your spirit up line your nature up when the spirit moves on your heart I like what he said if you've been seeped in the Holy Ghost I don't know how long he said it don't matter believe you'll get it hold on to it it's your promise don't take the substitute take something that's genuine we believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit we believe that God can change your nature can deliver you can come live in you and give you the power to hold on and to believe his word you don't have to have any sensation to hang on to there's only one thing you hang on to as he said so that settles it the Holy Ghost is mine I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he promised I would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he'll take care of it amen amen he'll bring it to pass it might be an unexpected time it might be an unexpected place it might be an unexpected way it might not be the way that you think so that's why you don't look at anything you don't plan anything you just believe God for what he said and I believe if you you'll do those things if if there's so many secrets and little nuggets there then just anchor yourself in that this evening so I just trust it was a blessing to you and I thought here's what brother random talked about and then here and here it is manifested in flesh remember every promise of God will be manifested in flesh he'll never leave it floating in the sky it'll come to pass when I say flesh not only human flesh but physical things Natural Things spiritual things it is he's changed not he's still a Healer he's still a savior he'll still work with your children he'll still do it exceedingly abundantly above which you can ask or think he's still God don't you love him let's stand together to see them maybe in your heart you would like to ask the Lord baby you want a refilling of the spirit of God you you want to read confirmation you you you just want the Lord to touch you and do something for you you have a prayer request on your heart that you'd like to raise to the Lord and
