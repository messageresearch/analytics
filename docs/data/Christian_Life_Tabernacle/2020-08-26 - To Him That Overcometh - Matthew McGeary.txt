Description:
To Him That Overcometh
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Service: August 26,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

to come together just to be able to worship him and not just worship him but worship him in spirit and in truth it's nice to talk to people when they know what they're talking about you know sometimes you talk to people and you realize they don't know what they're talking about but oh my somebody's ever experienced the grace of god you've ever been set free from sin if you ever were down in that muck in that mire and you were lost in trespasses and sin and you've been set free and you're talking to somebody who's experienced it you can tell they know what they're talking about and it's good to be gathered into a house of believers who know what they're talking about not anything that we've done because of what he's done that's why we worship him that's why we've given praise because we've experienced it we know firsthand firsthand revelation amen let's just read in our bibles we're going to be reading revelations chapter 2. we'll be reading verse 17 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it heavenly father we just approach you now as we've read your word we're certainly looking to you lord the author of this word and the finisher of our faith lord that you would come amongst us lord that you would have the preeminence in your people or that you would have the preeminence in this vessel and the ears of the here lord we know how satan would want to disrupt the service we know how easy it is to be distracted but lord you're worthy of our attention lord you're worthy of this time so lord may we all just agree in unity together to look to the supernatural to look to the unseen to come and manifest itself in the scene lord that you would just speak words of life speak words of deliverance lord that you would answer questions lord you would bring forth manifested promises lord healing in the body lord we we we know lord and have seen and can testify that you have done these things in the past lord and by expectation and by divine promise lord we stand looking for you to do it again we just love you lord we ask these things in your name the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated man i just uh in in using this uh text here out of revelations 2 um just something that kind of struck my heart here as i was i was reading the bible that says he that happened here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches it says to him that overcome will i give to eat of the hidden manna and it just struck me in my heart as i was thinking upon that it says to him that overcometh and of course we know that we can only come overcome because christ has already overcome for us but in saying that we're all on the same basis that he put adam and eve on and that's free moral agency and so we all have a choice to make we all have decisions that we must make every single day and as i was just thinking on this and it says to him that overcometh the lord just started dealing with my heart in in the part that i play in that you know because um we have choices to make every single day and we must walk in the spirit that we don't give in to the things of the flesh and the lust of the flesh and there's something that the individual has to do every single day to commit his ways unto the lord to overcome we can't just wake up and say well god you know you said i was an overcomer and i'm just going to wait for that to happen and then we don't have any part in it you know the prophet said god's not just going to put us in a pipe and stuff us through there and pull us out on the other side and say hey good job you're an overcomer but no to him that overcometh that means we're going to have some tests we're going to have some trials we're going to have some adversities we're going to face some things in our everyday life where we're going to have to make some hard decisions we're going to have to make some hard choices and we're going to have to overcome look how many times have you have you come down to a decision or it seems like satan's buffeting against your flesh you know it doesn't feel like you're all anointed with the fire of god and you're just on the mountaintop saying bring it on devil but no it comes at the times where you've been worn down and the kids have gotten on your last nerve and and somebody at work was just was which you know get just getting to the last uh a part of you where you just felt like you're at a snapping place and my you're just doing your best and then you come home and and you think you think you're finally going to get home into a haven of rest and you're going to put your feet up and relax and you get home and it just seems like the wife's been having a hard time with the kids and people are fussing and oh my everything's uh just going on that you know it's in those times where you start to find out your characters being molded in those little things where satan will come in and and try to cause thoughts and reactions you know those are times that we got overcome and that's a decision look when the prophet gives that most beautiful example of how he he came home and it seemed like the house was the atmosphere there wasn't so nice and brother brandon put on an apron uh on an apron he started helping uh sister mita there with the dishes and asking about her day and and what did he do he changed the atmosphere he changed the situation what was it he was being an overcomer that was something he had to do that was a choice he had to make and just what god really just was which just uh really struck my heart as i looked at this to him that overcometh will i give the eat of the hidden manna look there's deeper things in in the word of god that i want i want more revelation i don't got it all figured out this word it's so deep it's so vast it's so wonderful it seems like the more revelation you get the more you realize you don't know it seems like when god opens up something to you you just see him how vast it is and you're like my that's right and i say i want to know these things lord i want to know your person i want i want to to know everything about your kingdom lord that you would have for me i want to know it by revelation lord i don't i don't want to know it just by intellect i want the deep things lord i want all that you have for me and the lord's saying okay what are you doing to get that you know when you think of a couple and and sometimes you know couples have some have more uh adversity to overcome to to maybe uh be together some by long distance you know i i mean some one of our precious brothers here's married and his wife hasn't been able to join them from overseas and you just you imagine uh uh the effort that has to be put in uh to maintain long-distance relationships and maybe when you're courting somebody might you carve out time it's the only thing that matters nothing else matters i just want to talk uh to to the love of my life and and you sacrifice things why isn't that amazing how when something has the first place in your life you make sacrifices you're like man i i that that just doesn't mean as much as it used to mean too many me anymore because i want to take the time because i want to talk to my bride i want to talk to my wife you know i went through the day working today you know and and i haven't talked to her in a little bit a while and and maybe i had this little plan or maybe this little thing's pulling on me but you know what that can wait but i wonder if if we've allowed or walk with the lord to get to such a place or where we don't carve out time for the lord anymore we're not overcoming on a daily basis to eat the hidden manna look there's a table spread full oh my there's never been a table spread with supernatural food like this ever before in the history of man where the seals have been revealed and christ the mystery of god revealed has come and unveil himself to his bride oh what do you want to know in the scriptures do you have questions the bridegroom's standing saying what what what what do you want to know sweetheart what what what do you want to talk about today what's important to you whatever's important to you so we are that's important to me i want to know i want to know do you do do you want to know uh do you want to know more about the seals and the seventh seal yes sir you know i preached it was in a threefold manner and i i mentioned a preaching on a fold oven it's a threefold man do you want to know more do you even care do you care that the word is my person it's who i am it's my way of expressing myself and revealing myself to you do you want to know more of my person and who i am no no lord i'm a little busy i got to pay my rent i got to pay the bills well i'll take care of that for you just just carve out a little time for me you're the apple of my eye i want to whisper love secrets into your ear i want to tell you about the plan i had in my mind before the world ever formed oh this great achievement that i was wanting to achieve oh don't you realize i was alone with my own thoughts but i was thinking about you you were in my mind and i've been unfolding this great plan down through the ages all through time all the believers oh don't you realize moses was just a type joseph was just the type david was just a type esther was a type ruth was just a type oh my was just a type of what i was wanting to come and manifest in the last days oh and what i do i came and paid the price of redemption i redeemed a man but that wasn't the end of my plan i wanted to do more oh adam and eve was just a pre-figure don't you know when i formed adam and i put them there and that body don't you realize eve was in there but i had to bring eve out of adam's side that was just a prefigure don't you realize that when i became a new creation you were in me don't you realize that that's my great achievement that i've wanted to be achieved you realize when i climbed up to calvary and i took that a spear into my side oh and blood and water poured out for me oh i was paying the price of redemption but oh do you realize that life that came out was you and you are that lies being expressed in the last days oh do you realize that's what i wanted to achieve i wanted to have a bride in the end time and the most wicked of age we're sins on every front it's so weak it is so vile but i wanted to have a bride who would would carve out time for me who wouldn't be like that eve that would say no to the devil's lies that wouldn't wouldn't substitute my word out for education and reason and and the devil's lies but she would stand upon that word do you realize you're the bride that i was wanting to achieve oh and so much so more that i even predestinated you to this great glorious stand in the end time that you can't even fall you can't even miss it why because i love you you're struggling in your mind with the things of ladies and you keep thinking that you're not an overcomer and you keep doubting your calling but i'm here to tell you you're the apple of my eye you're my great achievement i know you feel like you you're you're under the gun i know you feel like you're not able to pay your bills i know you like you feel like your family life's not where it needs to be but i want to tell you i'm interested i care in you and i have everything that you've ever had and needed i actually wanted somebody living in lady osea in your exact situation that would take me at my word and i could point to you and show the devil there's an overcomer who will stand upon the word of god no matter what comes their way oh hallelujah you're my great achievement you're my bride you're the apple of my eyes do you want to know more about my love secrets you want to know more about the mysteries you want to know more about what i had in the back part of my mind before the world was ever formed yes lord this is just expressing my heart of what god was speaking to me yes lord i want to know more what are you doing what are you doing to find out more well i realized maybe lord i'm not making the right decision many times and i realize i want to start carving out more time for prayer i want to start carving out more time for your word i want to start letting you have the first place i want to start letting you have the preeminence lord i realize in my life that as much as you've done for me and you filled me with your holy spirit and i've just been on fire and i've been running and i love your gospel but i realized you get down the road a little bit and you realize i haven't prayed as much as i should have prayed i haven't gotten that secret place into the shekinah glory where i speak to you and you speak back oh have you ever gotten to that place have you ever entered in where it seems like it's eternal oh my lord and you're in the shekinah glory in the world's faded away and nothing else matters oh you're in a place that could stay and sustain you for all eternity or read about the prophet talking about kneeling in the woods these aren't clean uninfested insect free woods but the mosquitoes fighting the chiggers the ticks the noise the snakes the bugs picking away at the flesh but the flesh didn't matter anymore i must hear from god have we gotten to that place where the flesh doesn't matter anymore but the only thing that matters is hearing from god well i believe that what god is wanting his bride to do is come to a place where all this little bag of bulls just doesn't matter anymore oh you look at the sin and the condition of the world my it's getting worse it's getting worse now now mobs of people are actually forcing by force other people to agree with them if you don't make the gesture and if you don't agree with our cause and they're getting all up in their faces and they're intimidating with fear and many people are just giving in just to let it go do you realize what's setting up do you realize how easy this can switch to where state and and religion unites once again and they're right there in your face challenging you on your doctrine and saying if you don't agree with me we'll kill you are we gonna wait for that are we gonna wait until it gets worse and worse and worse then we finally go well okay the flesh doesn't matter anymore i think i'll get down to business and and pray you might find out it's too late noah didn't wait for it to start raining to build an ark and he didn't wait for it to start raining to get on the ark and i think a lot of us if we're not careful we're waiting for things to happen to fulfill prophecy before we get our house in order before we start getting serious until we start praying we're starting to wait for that ecumenical move to to match up and we're we're waiting for the squeeze to come down and we're waiting for certain manifestations and then we're going to get our house in order and then we're going to really get down and study out the seals and see what it's all about and then we're going to really try to get all of our ducks in a row sale i'm going in a body change you better watch out oh the prophet preached the message warning of that you've got a choice to make what are you waiting for are we going to wait till this just gets so bad so miserable until the atomic bomb is on its way you know wait for a news report like well it's on the way let's let's get down and pray honey oh god forbid let's do it now church let's get down to business to him that overcometh will i give the eat of the hidden manna oh that's christ the word the secret things of god that's been hid up before the foundation of the world but now has made manifest to the elect oh i want to feed on those things lord reveal your person to me the prophet says jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god is that right so then if man is to live and they are the flock of god the church then they are to thrive upon the word and manna of god this is his manna in the bible we just come through it over there in the church ages jesus is the hidden manner christ is the church's manna what is manna man in the old testament was that what come down from heaven fresh every night to sustain the church in its journey is that right now in the new testament what is the hidden manna a little while and the world seeth me no more hidden yet ye shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and christ is that hidden manna that comes from god out of heaven afresh every day every day we can't say well two weeks ago i had a great experience with god what about right now what about tonight every day fresh a new blessing a new something coming from god the hidden man are coming down from god out of heaven christ and we feast upon this manna which is christ and he sustains us through the journey till we reach the land on the other side what about right now what about tonight i say lord jesus may we have an experience tonight may your holy ghost and power come to where i'm sitting may you come to my heart lord may your word open up to me lord i'm an expectation i'm listening to the call lord i want this manna i want this hidden manner i'm wanting to know what it's all about lord i don't want to be looking back to an experience two weeks ago hey this this preaches to all of us and i mean i think the fact that he says two weeks ago might be a little bit of a rebuke i think some of us go two weeks two months two years now if you've been praying and seeking the lord through those two years you don't be discouraged but if you're not doing anything about it look we go through dry times where you're you're you're crying out to god you feel like your prayer is not going through the ceiling you're doing everything you can you're praying you're reading you go to church you're testifying and you just feel like you can't get an answer you feel like god won't talk to you well you keep believing because you're doing what the word said do you're just going through a test and you know what you're actually doing you're overcoming that's overcoming when you don't feel it when you don't feel like praying when you don't feel like going to church when you don't feel like testing testifying and you do it anyways now you're talking about an overcomer well it's easy to go on down to the camp services and get everybody together in a pep rally and those things are wonderful and the power of god comes around and everybody gets stirred up oh it's good to come to the special services but how many of us are living camp to camp how many of us are living service to service is sunday or the only time that you get into the presence of god oh god help us you realize that you can enter in to the presence of god and receive fresh manna every single day it's a promise to you you can have it if you desire and if you overcome to get it to him that overcometh i will give to eat of the hidden manna oh christ the word [Music] to him prophet points out when it says to him not to the church to him the individual that overcometh look you were created to be an overcomer you were created to be overcomer i love what our pastor was talking about the evidence of election look that's it's not something you do he made you an overcomer and if god creates something you're going to be an attribute of the creator when god made adam adam was a god son if god has a son it's going to be like god and god has sons and daughters in the last days who have his attributes who have his life who has his characteristics you were born an overcomer you were created an overcomer that's what the scripture says you were created in christ jesus oh my so if if you were created in christ jesus so then that means whatever jesus christ was you were in christ it was in christ that you were created and you came out from christ oh you are the anointed messiah for this day you are the bride you're his great achievement you are his body where is the life of god oh what did the prophet say he said all that was in god he poured into christ the godhead bodily and all that was in christ the god had bodily he poured into the church i want to ask you where's the life of god at where's the power of his resurrection where's the healing virtue where's the spoken word where's the manifested power in the end time it's in you you were created that way oh but you bypassed your theophany you came up in sinful flesh all part of his plan but he placed a little life on the inside of you the prophet talks about when you when you believe in god and and you become saved and you start believing on him he said it's like a little button little button in there that the light of god's word has come to life and it's there inside of you and that little button starts to grow and as you get rid of all the malice and all the strife and all the envy it keeps growing bigger and bigger and bigger that's all you have to do just just keep drinking and pushing out this ain't complicated you were created this way you wonder why you hunger you wonder why you thirst it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom it's that gene attribute of god inside of you calling for expression saying i am a creator i can do all things i'm more than an overcomer i am a conqueror in christ jesus and then we look in the mirror like well i don't see how it doesn't don't stop stop looking at the flesh keep looking at the word keep believing the word keep walking in the word and little by little you'll find out that all those little bits of of the flesh are being chipped away and you're coming into the stature of a perfect man therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation all things have passed away behold all things are become new well can anybody read that scripture know what they're talking about hey i i've been there don't get me started i'll talk your ear off oh oh therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things have passed away behold all things have become let me tell you a little bit about that i was an old creature once upon a time oh my i fought different i acted different i look different but all of a sudden something happened the transforming power of the holy ghost came into my life and it quickened something in me oh and it changed me old things passed away all things became new all things i didn't think the same i didn't talk the same i didn't dress the same i didn't like the same things i didn't even i'll go to the same places to end anymore why because old things that passed away all things have become new oh my to know the love of god to know what it's like to be quickened from dead unbelief in his word to a resurrected power of the living god living on the inside of you that when satan tries to come and buff it against you in the flesh you actually know what you're talking about i got a resurrected savior living inside of me he conquered you he has the death he has the keys to death hell and the grave and that same life devil that conquered you there he's living inside of me oh that's the kind of power you have you have a resurrection power life on the inside of you you were created in christ jesus that way you're just in a little journey as you're feeding on the hit of manna that's bringing you into the fullness of that expression this flesh isn't the real you love how brother brandon would always talk about the little pond lily you know down there in the muck in the mire well that sun kept pulling on it one day one day you know other things like you know what i'm tired of being around here anymore i think it's i think it's time to turn northward i think it's time to go up and what happens that little button if you would like that little light struck that seed and something started to happen it started to be germatized and it started to sprout but look if you're comfortable with where you're at if you're comfortable living the way you're living it's going to be really hard to get you to change your circumstance it's going to be really hard to get you out of the mess you're in but oh when you start hungering for change and oh when you start realizing you know i don't want to live this way anymore i've tried over and over and over and i i've tried to kick this habit and i've tried to overcome this problem but i just i can't seem to get over do you realize that's the seed of god inside of you that is crying out for deliverance it's crying out to me set free from the sin of bondage oh because why god is calling for you he's he's crying out his word and saying come out of her my people i'll come out of the sin and the bondage that you're in i want to bring you into higher heights in a deeper depth in my word i want to set you free from all of the sin and unbelief and you just turn and you start looking to the word you start taking god at his word and say you know what i i i i'm sure i can only i can only say what the word says i i know i ain't i know i ain't overcoming the devil at every stop but you know what the bible says the bible said he's made me more than a conqueror in jesus christ he said i was predestinated he had chosen me before the foundation of the world that i should be holy and without blame before him in love i am his workmanship created in christ jesus oh you start standing upon the promises of god yes yes this message how can i overcome just a great inspiration to me it says so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ see because if it don't because if it don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the bible said he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin now it necessarily doesn't mean that look if you know that god is dealing with your heart to do something and you don't do it it's sin now it might not appear on the outside to be sin but we must be obedient to the word of god we must be obedient to the call of god in our life then he says he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin then you become dodie rotten when you're separated from the life of god it says so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you would be fruit bearing strive with all that you mean i you mean i have to do something yes you need to strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you would be fruit bearing and as i looked at this i started to think about how the prophet would always say uh uh you know wanting brother brandon maybe to or to go into the deep things or or stuff like that he goes how how in the world am i ever going to teach them algebra if they don't know their abcs well i think i think sometimes we're struggling a lot with our abcs i think a lot of us reason why we can't go on and do algebra we haven't gotten our abcs down always believe christ but there used to be something to a consecrated holy life of prayer there used to be something to a life that would abstain from the appearance of evil there used to be something to the life that wouldn't give in to all the little uh flirt flirting temptations that the devil whips around in all of these devices that he's created in this day but oh we just entertain it all i think i think some of us we need to check up and start to realize the reason why we can't do algebra is because we don't even know our abcs and this is where we start this is where it starts coming down to it's faithful in the little things we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages the lady will see a church age is the the grandest of all church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been and the powers of satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any other age see here back there in early ages a christian could for his profession of being being a belonging to christ could be beheaded for it he could be killed and put out of his misery and go to meet god quickly but now the enemy has come in in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception when christ said so two spirits would be so close in the last days till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible c see remember christ spoke of an elected people for the last days see it would deceive the very elect if it was possible so close the people so close the people so live now i want you to really take heed to this the people so that people can live a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers or drinkers and liars and gamblers they can live above that and still not with him well this is the greatest age of deception that you could be living a holy life you could be abstaining from all the things that the devil is trying to throw at you and you can actually be missing it he says not with it but you say by believers oh not me brother yes you me all of us if we're not careful we get caught up into thinking just because we're abstaining we're relying on works but no we want to go past works we want to overcome and come into a place where we're feeding on the hidden man of god and we're not relying on some experience from the past but we're having a fresh experience every single day i say oh god i want that lord jesus help me god to die out every single day and be a true real overcomer of god that i can have that in my life let people be able to just see a change let them be able to see the evidence of that type of life lord that they can be hungry for the things of god people are deceived thinking that their works is enough but oh there there's more there's more for you look i i i i think we need to preach you must be born again the gospel is you must be born again you got to go to calvary look cavalry ain't old it ain't an old story you must be born again in an old gospel we got people amongst us and in our body that need to be born again and i feel that the way somehow the devil's been able to to spin it is that if somebody's hungering and thirsting and they want to be born again they feel like an outcast like god forbid i let somebody know that i'm praying and hungering to be filled with the holy ghost my if i let my youth group know that oh my i i wouldn't have the badge of honor oh we're supposed to work out our salvation with fear and trembling before god oh we need we need some folks to get hungry and get sincere and get down to business and realize you know what i've been going to church a little while i've been listening to the message i've gone to some cats but you know what this this born again this new change this new creature old things passing away all things become a new i maybe i haven't experienced it like i i should have come on oh this is between life and death i had a a friend of mine an acquaintance in business a really nice man who's been a great blessing to me uh he has a a a a he's a contractor that does uh drainage work and landscaping and he he refers a lot of work to me he's a great blessing he's a christian man and uh he's god's done some great miracles in his life where he's been delivered from stage four cancer and he had another bout with something here not too long ago and and god's just uh kept him kept him alive and so he he was out in florida on vacation and uh they they were there on the beach and there was a really bad rip tide that was coming through and they started hearing some people uh call for help and they could tell it was a bad riptide and well he had a young 18 year old son he was a little bit more savvy knowing that riptide's it's you get out matt you're just as helpless as they are and uh but his son said no i gotta go help and he runs off into the water and and line's like oh my goodness so he started to just to make his way out there was going to try to stay up on the sandbar and before he knew it he got swept out there in the sun and they're in this riptide and he said he he got spun around and twirled around and and uh he said you know it's like things came into slow motion and i just got real calm and i and i and i just kind of turned over on my back and i was i wasn't going to struggle anymore and i made peace i knew my son had been taken from me and i was there and i'm like well i guess this is it and he said out of nowhere out of nowhere all of a sudden somebody pulled him up onto a board and and got him to shore and they got his son out too and they had they'd got three or four more but unfortunately i believe it was an 11 year old boy they they made it out of the water and they they were trying to resuscitate him but he didn't make it he passed away and he was a part of that uh ceremony but when i when i got back and was talking to lawn he was he was he was full of a completely different perspective he had a new perspective on life he's like man it's good to be alive oh i'm thankful to be alive you know the things that i thought mattered they really don't matter as much anymore why because he had come into a situation that was between life or death and i want to know you look you're between a situation of life or death you must be born again and i tell you what if a man who was just uh coming to terms with potentially dying in the natural i tell you what when you've been set free from spiritual death oh you want to talk about a joy you want to talk about a house on fire nothing can put that fire out the devil can throw this trial on you he can throw that trial on you he can throw that temptation on you he'll bring everything he want to do to discourage you but you are a conqueror through jesus christ you are more than a conqueror why because it's not your life it's his life that's living in you brother brandon makes a comment about self-will says self-will is the veil to the shekinah glory self-will is the veil to go into the holy place and as we've just said here in the outset of being an overcomer the prophet says you know the greatest enemy that i have is william brennan william branham's always getting in the way of god well i think the prophet's trying to let us know something the greatest enemy we got the greatest enemy i got is matthew mcgeary always getting in the way of what god is trying to do we always allowing ourself will to get in the way but it's through that self will if we can die out to that and we can be an overcomer to enter in into that secret place and live there in the shekinah glory where what the man is fresh every single day you know what was back there in the shekinah glory back during the holiest the holy there was the aaron's rod was back there the ten commandments and there was a bowl of manna that the new high priest when they come in there they would get a hand of fresh manna it never went old in the presence of god and that's what god is inviting you to is to live in that presence where you're eating that hidden manna where you're feeding on christ the word every single day of your life if we can just die out to self-will and enter into that and quit getting in god's way every overcomer has to be put to the test what what did the prophet say it means to overcome to recognize the devil in every single one of his tricks i say god give me some discernment lord i want to be an overcomer i want to recognize if you said i can recognize every single one of the devil's tricks and you created me and i'm an overcomer then lord i'm looking for it i know that you're giving me the ability by your holy ghost that i can recognize the devil and every single one of his tricks and if the prophet says you got to recognize him real he says but once you've recognized that he's real he said to overcome you must recognize that god in you is greater and mightier than he is and he said and by his grace you are more than a match for the devil oh hallelujah you're more than a match for the devil why because it's christ that's living in you oh you were predestinated to that first john 4 4 says year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen it's not me that liveth but it's christ that liveth in you it's god working in you both to will and to do his good pleasure by just picking up on that quote we read we got to strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you are fruit bearing and we just maybe by god's grace just turn a corner and we'll just we won't be much longer but in overcoming he says to the overcomer i will give to eat the hidden manna that's that's kind of what i'm wanting to drive to tonight is that lord may i get all the abc's may i get the self-will out of the way may i be carving out time for you lord may i may i be giving you the first place that you might have the preeminence lord that that that i can receive and feed on this hidden manner feed on the secret things of god the prophet says he's in mentioning in the church age book he says now uh referencing malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 he says the messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals he says and it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers it'll be these divine revealed mystery truths what what are you talking about these divine mystery truths that were sealed away in the seven seals that now by divine promise in the very end time this hidden secret that god has had in his mind all along according to revelations 10 7 at the sounding of the seventh angel messenger he would begin to sound and all of the mysteries of god would be finished oh what make it away so you could feed on all of the hidden manner of god now i want maybe just in here around on a sobering note a little bit and this really cause us to think the prophet of god said that when the seals came open he said the bible became a new book to him is that right now if we're if we just think about this maybe a little soberly and you think of the prophet and his understanding of the word for the prophet oh what humility oh so many men they're so puffed up they would never they would never belittle themselves hey man after preaching the gospel for 30 years plus said the bible became a new book to me oh that's chief wave and humility saying you know what now that the seals are open the bible's become a brand new book something to my eyes said lord if it became a new book for the prophet lord let it become a new book to me lord let these mysteries open up i want all of it lord i want the hidden manna oh i dare to even think i had the understanding the prophet had pre-63 and the bible became a new book to him say lord reveal the deep things to me when i'm ready to be an overcomer not in myself lord but i'm ready to take you at your word the musicians would come we'll just find a place to end here you don't have to start playing just yet but we just want to tie a couple scriptures together here i want this message to be alive in me i don't want to have to go match quote to this quote to that quote and try to follow this and chase it down and what what did the prophet say about this oh but if the message is alive in you if the message is in you if the message is alive you have the devil's answer oh it's alive it's living in you your bone of his bone and flesh of his lust you've received the revelation it's in you and i say lord i want more i want more and more and more reveal the deep things oh god the hidden manner john 6 51 says i am the living bread which come down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give in my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat that's a reasonable question i mean don't look at these guys like man they just don't know what's going on reasonable question then jesus said unto verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you he wasn't stopping he's going to keep going too whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my gonna be the day you witness to somebody and told him to come to church like oh my goodness yeah you know i mean that's our pastor that's what we believe hey we might not understand everything but watch what watch what he comes on down and says here he says for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him you you could see that these people would be like what is he talking about but you know what the prophet of god said he said he said it to stumble them he said actually what jesus was doing was separating the sheeps from the goats oh because the elect my sheep know my voice they're not going to hear another they're going to be just like peter say lord where else will we go no i don't understand all the mysteries no i don't understand all the message no i can't make it all add up and everything the lord where else am i going to go this is the words of eternal life this is the hidden manner that i want to feed on oh god knew exactly how this message would come forth you think that brother branham you know not making it through i guess a seventh grade education brother god was up there going man i was hoping to at least get out of 12th grade god god orchestrated the steps so beautifully to manifest his word in the last days that the word would come forth in such humility in such simplicity that it would separate the sheeps from the goats oh some people just couldn't stand to be identified with a man breaking the bread of life and not having an lld and this and that i want to just move down he says oh my oh those are comfortable no we we will try to finish lord forgive me i just we have a lot here but we want to try to summarize this we didn't want to keep you too long but just remember to be an overcomer you gotta you gotta go through test every son and daughter that comes to god must be tested and we're gonna have tests in our every day of life i think of the story of that woman whose daughter was vexed with the devil and she finally gets to the lord and the lord doesn't even respond to her and then she comes again and he says it's not meat to give the children's bread to dogs well you know what jesus was doing separating sheep from goats because if that would have been a goat that goat would have been gone but there was something in that woman she was a predestinated seed i believe something in her soul i have nowhere else to go lord you alone have the words of eternal life and even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table i say oh god if i'm not understanding all the rich deep things of your word lord oh just give me a few crumbs lord a few crumbs from your table tonight will satisfy my hungry soul now in john 4 32 so what i'm just tying here together is he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part with me that's still a very mysterious statement but we know that he's speaking in a spiritual sense and a spiritual partaking of his word but i like this scene here in john 4 where it's setting up this is the scene of the woman at the well and we won't take the time to go through such a beautiful story that i believe each one of us can identify with that predestinated seed responding to the word made flesh and her saying lord we we know that when messiah comes he'll show us these things when he says i am he oh we can all see that identification but i want to look at the last part of the story here as the disciples now are coming up on this on this unfolding and this happening and they come up and you know jesus has sent him away to get food so now they're coming back with food and and uh they're wanting to give him food he goes but he said unto them i have meat to eat that you know not of therefore said the disciples one to another half any man brought him something to eat jesus said in him my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work my meat my food is to do the will of him that sent me and his will is his word luke 24 42 he says saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will be done but your will be done look if this was the very life that was evident in christ jesus it's now the same life that is evident in the bride of jesus christ the bride is saying lord not my will but thy will be done oh god needs prisoners today prisoners of his word that regardless of what's going on in the world they'll stay right there with that word like moses they'll stay right there with the word like the prophet look brother branham was a prisoner to the word he couldn't do his own will when he wanted to do his own will the spirit of god would come and check him and say no we got we got work to do he's trying to go down to the post office and mail something off and go back up and catch an airplane ride nope oh god help me to get in a place of sensitivity to your holy spirit where i can be so sensitive to the still small voice look we make it so big and so supernatural way off in the uh the yonder that god can't do those things in our life he can he wants to that was a sheaf wave of a whole wheat field coming up behind it to manifest the same signs and wonders to have the same type of leadership and and jesus said in uh luke 16 10 he said he who is faithful and little will be faithful much oh god help us to start overcoming in the little things that the big things might start coming in a manifestation if you can start playing something let's stand [Music] now oh if we can just be prisoners died out to self-will a prophet in the seventh seal makes a statement that really just resonated in my heart he said you know people in the last days are living on a hangover from another age that people of these last days is living on a hangover from the pentecostal age do you know the pentecostal age was under the intelligence of man that was the anointing this and the accomplish of man was so incredible with the compiling of notes and the compiling of encyclopedias and and all mapping out bibles and scriptures and everything but he said that won't work anymore that won't do we've come into a higher age we've come into the eagle age i said oh god may i not be trapped by the devil into a hangover from another age where i'm just trying to garner through the message for knowledge i'm just trying to comb through the message and tie this quote into that quote well may it be a revelation and then if the word is a revelation then you're feeding on the hidden matter because you are performing his will what did jesus say he says my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and his will is his word and the prophet of god said those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through his bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left off for a specific time all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he poured into you the believer oh just ending on a scripture colossians we've been fellowshipping on this colossians 1 25 even the mystery which has been hid from the ages and from generations but now is made manifest to a saint to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory brother branham says in christ the mystery of god revealed he says christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing my christ in you makes you the revelation of the whole thing everything that god was wanting to achieve was first to express himself in jesus christ and now express himself in a bride out of the preeminence what for to take us back to eden oh hallelujah let's just go before the lord if somebody would have a something on their heart and just want to lift up their hand and say lord i realize that i can live a better consecrated life lord i realize that i can do more for you lord sometimes i i put it all off on you lord like you're the one that has to make me kneel down to pray and you're the one that has to make me open my bible and lord i don't know why i do it i'm i'm hungry and thirsting for more of you and for some reason lord in the simple things just in the little simple abcs of getting on my knees and praying and opening up my bible and pray lord i'm not doing those little things that i know i need to be doing lord i just lift up my hands but i believe your children are lifting up their hands say lord i'm going to do better not because it's something in myself and it's going to be some work and just my own effort lord but i realize your life and me is crying out for more it's hungry for more lord and i'm just going to die out to myself for it i'm going to start making an effort to give you the time that you deserve and give you the first place lord and i know in just doing the little things lord that these big things these desires that i've had in my heart lord maybe you've been letting them linger around because i haven't been doing the small things lord so by your grace i'm going to be faithful and little lord as you promised that i could be faithful and much lord we just love you lord we
