[39:17] you went to Calvary and you die in a
[39:19] horrible death and
[39:21] we all should have died but
[39:24] your love was so great

[39:38] to know that we've been forgiven that
[39:40] we've been set free and Lord we've heard
[39:43] the greatest message that's ever hit the
[39:45] face of the Earth to know you and the
[39:47] power of your Resurrection
[39:48] when the whole world is groping in
[39:51] darkness and even the religious leaders
[39:53] of the day are so blind that they don't
[39:55] know what the truth is but you Lord

[41:33] chapter one
[41:39] man praise the Lord
[41:42] just enjoy the Psalms and the worship
[41:44] and the song specials
[41:48] good to have our visitors brother Amos
[41:50] and his wife and with us
[41:52] and also
[41:54] really a privilege to have brother
[41:56] Norbert
[41:58] I mean I would have what a privilege to
[42:00] have him where are you at how can I miss
[42:02] you where are you at brother
[42:03] there he is you're trying to hide
[42:06] well it's good he you know we just had
[42:09] such a wonderful time in the Lord there
[42:10] in Romania and uh as we're just
[42:13] ministering to the youth
[42:15] um you know I can't I I I'm not in a
[42:19] position where I can interpret so I'm
[42:21] thankful for that
[42:22] but my you know the the the inter the
[42:25] one that does the interpreting you
[42:27] should pray for them like you do the
[42:28] minister because you know there's an
[42:30] anointing and there's a gift that comes
[42:32] behind that and there was just such a
[42:34] Unity between me and brother Norbert
[42:36] um and such a flow of the Holy Ghost
[42:38] it's just a privilege to have my brother
[42:40] in service with us but reading in our
[42:41] Bibles Revelations chapter one
[42:45] it says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:48] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[42:50] servants things which must shortly come
[42:53] to pass
[42:55] and he sent and signified it by his
[42:57] Angel into his servant John
[43:00] who bear record of the word of God and
[43:02] of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[43:05] all things that he saw blessed is he
[43:08] that readeth and they that hear the
[43:11] words of this prophecy and keep those
[43:14] things which are written therein for the
[43:16] time is at hand
[43:18] John to the seven churches which are in
[43:21] Asia Grace be unto you in peace from him
[43:22] which is and which was and which is to
[43:24] come and from the seven spirits which
[43:26] are before and his throne and from Jesus
[43:29] Christ who is the faithful witness the
[43:31] first begotten of the dead and the
[43:33] prince of the kingdom of the earth unto
[43:36] him that loved us and washed us from all
[43:39] from our sins
[43:42] in his own blood amen you may be seated
[43:45] as we'll just continue to read a little
[43:48] further just trusting that God will come
[43:51] and
[43:51] bring a word of encouragement to you and
[43:55] hath made us Kings and Priests you know
[43:58] I like that right there
[44:00] he has made us Kings and Priests he's
[44:03] done something that you could not do
[44:05] he's done something that the world could
[44:08] not do oh sure that the world might be
[44:10] able to make you a worldly king or a
[44:13] worldly priest but but here this he's
[44:15] made us Kings and Priests by the washing
[44:18] of the water of the word by the shedding
[44:21] of his blood he's done something that no
[44:23] man could do he's made us both Kings and
[44:26] Priests unto God his father for him be
[44:28] glory and Dominion forever and ever amen
[44:31] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[44:33] eye shall see him and they also which
[44:35] pierced him in all kenjons of the Earth
[44:37] shall wail because of him even so amen I
[44:40] am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[44:43] ending saith the Lord which is and which
[44:45] was and which is to come the Almighty
[44:49] I just want to maybe
[44:51] focus a little on this verse here he
[44:53] says I John who am your brother
[44:56] and companion in Tribulation
[45:00] and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[45:03] Christ was in the aisle that is called
[45:04] Patmos for the word of God and for the
[45:07] testimony of Jesus Christ now just for a
[45:11] little uh Foundation I love to read a
[45:15] quote of the prophet he says this and
[45:17] presume and he says let's presume
[45:19] nothing
[45:20] stay with that word
[45:22] and God is obligated that word is a seed
[45:26] and that word will bring forth
[45:28] everything it promised to bring forth
[45:31] now I know we hear that many times but
[45:34] the word is a seed and it will bring
[45:37] forth everything that it's promised to
[45:39] bring forth the prophet would even say
[45:41] look the word is a seed and if you're
[45:43] believing for salvation then it's a seed
[45:45] you you place into your heart and you go
[45:48] believing for the manifestation of it if
[45:50] you're believing for healing he said by
[45:52] your stripes you are healed and then you
[45:55] take that word which is a seed into your
[45:58] heart and you go believing if you're
[46:00] weary if you're downtrodden if if you
[46:02] don't feel like you're worth anything he
[46:04] said come unto me all ye who are heavy
[46:06] laid and I will give you rest that word
[46:09] is a seed and if you take that word that
[46:12] seed into your heart and you believe it
[46:14] by faith then that word will produce
[46:16] exactly what it said it would produce he
[46:20] said it'll do it it'll take the world
[46:23] out of you now I think that's maybe a
[46:25] word that some of us need tonight we
[46:27] need a faith that'll take the word out
[46:29] of us amen we need something that will
[46:31] get a whole hold of us and change our
[46:34] lives and I tell you if you're feeding
[46:35] on the message of the hour if you're
[46:38] feeding on the word of God if you're
[46:39] getting down into prayer and you're
[46:41] really listening to the tapes and you're
[46:43] going into the word of God I'm telling
[46:45] you you take that word into your heart
[46:47] and it will change you it will change
[46:50] the way you think it'll change the way
[46:52] you talk it'll change job situations
[46:54] it'll change family situations this word
[46:57] of God has a power and this word of God
[46:59] is a seed and the spoken word is the
[47:02] Original Seed and Christ is that seed
[47:04] and that is the seed that is coming to
[47:06] the heart of the believer that will
[47:08] produce every promise of God it is yea
[47:11] and amen I want to preach to you a
[47:13] little bit tonight oh Hallelujah I love
[47:15] the word of God because he has given you
[47:17] an ear to hear he said my sheep know my
[47:20] voice they will follow after me and if
[47:22] you know the voice of this message if
[47:24] your ear has been tuned in oh if there's
[47:27] a faith Crystal on the inside of your
[47:29] heart then whenever you hear the
[47:30] prophetic message of Malachi far
[47:32] whatever it's speaking oh if you can
[47:34] believe it then you can hide what you're
[47:36] hearing it's for you
[47:40] oh my we we've heard something the
[47:42] world's never heard before
[47:44] it tore the seals off the book we have
[47:47] an open book The Prophet said it became
[47:49] a brand new book
[47:51] has it become a new book to you
[47:54] I think maybe it's just become Theology
[47:56] and it's just become a man's opinion
[47:58] it's just become something that maybe
[48:00] we've we've found ourselves able to
[48:03] agree with in clicks you know and and
[48:05] old men have have studied the message
[48:07] and they they maybe say it this way and
[48:09] they speak about his peering and they
[48:11] speak about the the coming of the son of
[48:13] man and the revealing of the son of man
[48:15] and we come to a denominational way of
[48:17] thinking where we accept man's
[48:19] interpretation of the word but I wonder
[48:21] if you've ever got down into prayer and
[48:23] you say oh God I need a revelation of
[48:25] the seventh seal Lord your Prophet said
[48:28] it's the coming of the lord it's the end
[48:30] of all things it's the end of the
[48:31] trumpets it's the end of the vials I
[48:33] know something happened out there on the
[48:35] mountains in 1963. I might not know
[48:38] exactly what it is Lord but my heart's
[48:39] on fire my heart is stirring Lord I need
[48:42] a revelation Lord would you come down in
[48:44] the room I want to tell you if God would
[48:46] come down in the room and reveal the
[48:48] Seven Seals to the prophet he wants to
[48:50] reveal those Seven Seals to you
[48:53] oh but if we're not careful just because
[48:55] it's on the tapes just because it's on
[48:58] the books we we imagine that we know
[49:00] what the prophet's talking about
[49:02] but it's by revelation
[49:04] look this is not a denomination
[49:07] we haven't gathered around a man's
[49:09] thinking
[49:10] man's words were fail
[49:13] but we what have we gathered around
[49:14] we've gathered around the unfailing body
[49:16] word of the son of man
[49:19] that's what you're feeding on
[49:21] or are you fading on it
[49:24] that's what you if you're feeding on it
[49:26] then you're becoming it if you're eating
[49:28] it if you're listening to it then you're
[49:30] going to manifest it because that word
[49:32] is a seed
[49:35] and if you take that message into your
[49:38] heart
[49:40] what's going to happen
[49:42] you're going to start to see the fruits
[49:44] of the message
[49:45] you're going to start to see the fruits
[49:47] of the life
[49:48] you're going to start to see the word in
[49:51] action in you
[49:54] have we settled for something less are
[49:57] we living below our privileges Have We
[50:00] Become to a place where we're complacent
[50:02] and and and and we found that you know
[50:04] what I really can never live a total
[50:07] overcoming life
[50:10] that I find myself subject to worldly
[50:13] pleasures uh maybe not so much sinful
[50:16] but is there a progression
[50:19] is there something in your heart that's
[50:21] moving and stirring with your feeding on
[50:24] this message in such a way that there's
[50:26] an expectation and something inside you
[50:29] crying out and Desiring for more of this
[50:32] word to be made alive in you
[50:35] look I don't know about you but I'm not
[50:38] satisfied with where I'm at
[50:40] I I I can listen to I can listen to what
[50:44] one message or read a read a few quotes
[50:46] and you realize how little you really
[50:49] are
[50:50] when you hear the voice of God speaking
[50:52] tool oh I'm thankful for it
[50:56] there was a time
[50:58] there was a time there that God come
[51:00] down on the mountain and his presence
[51:03] were there and it's so fearful and he
[51:05] spoke unto him and he said oh don't
[51:07] speak to us or let Moses speak to us
[51:09] lest we die
[51:12] and God said you've spoken well I'll
[51:15] raise up a prophet amongst you and I'll
[51:16] put my words in his mouth and he'll be a
[51:18] God to you
[51:21] look David if you have the revelation of
[51:24] what a real Prophet is a word Prophet if
[51:27] you have a real revelation of what
[51:28] Malachi 4 5 was then you're not just
[51:31] hearing the words of a man
[51:36] how can we get to a place where when we
[51:39] would question the words of God
[51:43] well did he really mean that
[51:46] well I just know he said it
[51:49] and that's good enough for me
[51:51] that's where we get ourselves in trouble
[51:53] is when we try to figure out what the
[51:56] prophet meant and we try to run with our
[51:58] intellectual idea and run over here what
[52:00] did this brother say about it and what
[52:02] did this brother say about it and we got
[52:04] our little quote books and we jump into
[52:06] here into one quote and jump over here
[52:08] into one quote and before you know it we
[52:10] just got our own little sermon all
[52:13] worked up on speaking in tongues and
[52:15] just how it should be we got our own
[52:16] little sermon all cooked up about the
[52:18] son of man we got our own sermon cooked
[52:20] up about the coming of the Lord and all
[52:22] you're doing is pulling a quote here
[52:23] pulling a quote there pulling a
[52:25] scripture there and you're just cooking
[52:27] it up you're playing Chef in the kitchen
[52:29] oh I'm gonna whoop to something that's
[52:31] going to wow the people or wow my
[52:32] brothers I'm just gonna throw this all
[52:34] in and add a little spice and something
[52:36] nice and say how you like it well and
[52:38] everybody will jump and everybody will
[52:39] holler and everybody will say Amen but
[52:42] if you take what the preacher is
[52:43] preaching you take it back to the word
[52:45] of God and find out of what the man's
[52:47] preaching is in line with the prophet
[52:49] then you'll know if it's the word of the
[52:50] Lord or not
[52:52] I'm reminded in the scriptures that
[52:54] Jonah he had a call upon his life and
[52:56] God told John he said Jonah I want you
[52:59] to go
[53:00] I want you to go go to Nineveh
[53:03] he didn't say I want you to go to
[53:04] Nineveh and make up some good sermon
[53:07] he said I want you to go to Nineveh I
[53:09] want you to preach the preaching that I
[53:11] bid you to preach
[53:12] that's the kind of prophet I want
[53:15] that's the kind of Pastor I want that's
[53:17] the kind of preacher I want give me a
[53:20] man of God that'll stand behind the
[53:21] pulpit and you'll preach the preaching
[53:23] that God bid him to preach
[53:26] that's the kind of preaching that'll
[53:28] bring results
[53:30] he could have went in there to Nineveh
[53:31] oh may he I didn't want to go in the
[53:33] first place why am I even here I'm just
[53:35] going to come here and I'm going to
[53:36] preach a feel-good sermon and I'm going
[53:38] to give them a little history lesson and
[53:40] you know maybe some people will see it
[53:41] and maybe some people won't that won't
[53:43] bring results the word is a seed and if
[53:46] you preach the word the word will bring
[53:49] the results
[53:52] and what happened when he preached the
[53:53] preaching that God bid him to preach it
[53:55] brought the whole town to repentance
[53:58] don't you realize we're supposed to be
[54:00] preaching a message
[54:02] well I need I need help tonight
[54:05] y'all are the ones that are going to
[54:06] preach tonight and we ain't gonna preach
[54:07] at all
[54:11] your life is me your life is preaching
[54:14] the message
[54:15] look just as Jonah was commissioned a go
[54:18] to Nineveh and preach the preaching that
[54:20] I bid you to preach there is a people a
[54:22] bride of Jesus Christ that has been
[54:24] called by God their eyes have been
[54:26] opened unto the unfailing word of God in
[54:29] that word that you take into your heart
[54:31] it's supposed to birth forth the fruits
[54:33] of Christ and you are walking living
[54:35] epistle written and red of all men that
[54:38] they might see your good works and
[54:40] glorify God
[54:43] oh God granted
[54:46] let me be that written epistle Lord
[54:48] let me really live this message let me
[54:50] get down to business
[54:53] oh my I've played Church way too long
[54:56] Lord forgive me I I realize that if I'm
[54:59] going to start doing something for God I
[55:01] better start doing it now
[55:06] the word is a seed and that word will
[55:09] bring forth everything it promised to
[55:11] bring forth
[55:13] it'll do it
[55:18] well I didn't start my timer so y'all
[55:20] might be in trouble
[55:22] we got that was a bonus right there
[55:24] however long that was
[55:27] I found out that that little that that
[55:29] really helps you know you don't Tire the
[55:31] people because if you turn a corner and
[55:32] then you know we can be here till 10.
[55:37] though that word is a seed
[55:41] it'll bring forth the thing that it
[55:43] promised it'll take the world out of you
[55:45] it'll sanctify you it'll make you live
[55:48] diff a different life it'll make you do
[55:50] things that you thought you couldn't do
[55:52] oh Hallelujah can anybody say Amen to
[55:55] the word has the has this message or the
[55:58] hour made you do things that you thought
[56:00] you couldn't do you thought you couldn't
[56:02] live an overcoming life you thought you
[56:04] couldn't live a Victorious Life you
[56:06] thought you couldn't have a hunger for
[56:07] the things of God you thought you
[56:08] couldn't do without your drugs you
[56:10] thought you couldn't do without the
[56:11] alcohol you thought you couldn't do
[56:12] without your internet programs you
[56:14] thought you couldn't do without of all
[56:15] those things but what happened Faith
[56:17] received a seed of the message into your
[56:20] heart and you started to walk according
[56:23] to that word seed that you had received
[56:25] not even seeing any change in your life
[56:27] does somebody know what I'm talking
[56:28] about that you heard the message of the
[56:31] hour you heard the preacher preach the
[56:33] word and something in your heart said
[56:35] amen to the word and Satan came behind
[56:37] that remember the parable of the Soul or
[56:40] the the good Sowers the son of man who
[56:42] went forth and sowed good seed
[56:45] but then Satan the wicked what comes by
[56:47] that he wants to sow them tears into
[56:49] your mind
[56:51] and you hear the word of God you haven't
[56:52] experienced something great happens in
[56:54] the church service and you go forth
[56:56] praising God rejoicing in the word that
[56:59] you've heard and you say Amen to the
[57:01] word now I'm looking for change in my
[57:03] life but then the devil will come right
[57:04] behind us say that's not for you you've
[57:06] tried this so many times you've come to
[57:08] the altar so many times you've been to
[57:10] camps and camps and after camps you're
[57:12] just that same one the preachers always
[57:14] talk about you just got another cap
[57:15] experience
[57:19] he'll try to rob that seed right out of
[57:22] your heart
[57:23] but you have a choice
[57:26] you have a choice to either take God in
[57:28] his word or take the devil at his word
[57:31] you have the same choice that Eve had
[57:33] you know that's exactly where we've come
[57:35] back to in the end time again that we
[57:37] are back to the same place where we have
[57:40] the fullness of the word made available
[57:42] to us the full word of God and it's up
[57:45] to you to believe every single word that
[57:47] God has revealed by Malachi 4 5 or you
[57:51] can doubt that word and bring forth
[57:52] death
[57:55] but something in my heart when all of
[57:57] those things coming you just need to
[57:58] tell that Old Devil to shut up
[58:01] just tell that Old Devil to shut up
[58:05] tell them he ain't got no right to be
[58:08] there
[58:09] that I've heard the word of God and that
[58:12] word is a seed and I've heard that word
[58:15] in my heart and it's going to bring
[58:17] forth what it said it would why because
[58:19] he said it would bring forth what he
[58:21] said it would bring
[58:22] then that settles it
[58:24] oh if we could just have that childlike
[58:27] Faith to know if God said it I'll
[58:29] believe it I'm going to walk forth and
[58:31] I'm going to keep believing it it'll do
[58:33] what it said it would do it'll take the
[58:35] world out of you it'll make you do
[58:37] things that you thought you couldn't do
[58:38] because it's the word in you oh I like
[58:41] that because it's the word in you it's
[58:44] not your efforts it's not your ability
[58:46] it's not something you worked up it's
[58:48] not some man's opinion no it's none of
[58:50] those things what it is it's the word
[58:52] that's found fertile ground in your
[58:54] heart and by faith you believe that word
[58:56] and now that you're walking according to
[58:58] that word with faith in that word it
[59:00] will bring forth what it's intended to
[59:01] bring
[59:05] hey man
[59:15] because it's the word in you
[59:18] don't presume you have it
[59:20] watch your life and measure up and see
[59:24] what your life is
[59:26] see the way
[59:27] that you're living
[59:29] see the way that you're living
[59:32] see the way that you're sleeping in
[59:34] church and you're falling asleep and the
[59:36] preacher's preaching really doesn't mean
[59:37] that much to you see how you sit there
[59:39] in the seat of the scornful and say oh
[59:41] this is kind of the way it goes every
[59:43] single time Lord knows your thoughts he
[59:45] knows the intents of your heart he knows
[59:46] that your attitude towards the word and
[59:48] you find out it's not your attitude
[59:50] towards a man it's an attitude towards
[59:52] God's Vindicated way of bringing forth
[59:54] the message of the hour and we can get
[59:56] so carnal where we start to doubt our
[59:58] pastor and just look at the backside of
[1:00:01] Israel and think oh my goodness we could
[1:00:03] do it all this way in that way just
[1:00:05] because Satan wants to give you a little
[1:00:07] A View from this way and see the
[1:00:09] humanity oh yeah we all got Humanity
[1:00:12] but it's this Humanity it's this Badger
[1:00:15] skin that God has chosen to Veil himself
[1:00:18] in in the end time to continue on the
[1:00:21] ministry of the son of man in the
[1:00:23] bride's body don't you realize that's
[1:00:25] what's taking place today is the very
[1:00:27] logos of God that was split up on the
[1:00:30] day of Pentecost and poured out upon the
[1:00:32] people it's that same Holy Spirit that's
[1:00:34] living now in you and in you and in you
[1:00:37] and if you speak against that word watch
[1:00:40] out
[1:00:42] I say God may I never have the wrong
[1:00:45] attitude towards my brother may I never
[1:00:47] have the wrong attitude towards the man
[1:00:49] of God may I never sit in in in the seat
[1:00:52] of the scornful and think that I got it
[1:00:54] all figured out and I studied it out
[1:00:55] better and and this is rudimentary and
[1:00:58] this is elementary and and we've been
[1:01:00] down this road before and we're just
[1:01:01] going down that road again can you say
[1:01:03] something that'll help me preacher
[1:01:05] well I might not be able to
[1:01:08] that depends on your faith
[1:01:11] that depends on your attitude matter of
[1:01:13] fact your attitude we've been taught can
[1:01:15] knock somebody else out of their
[1:01:16] blessing but I wonder if we could all
[1:01:18] get together and get in one mind and one
[1:01:20] Accord and have the unity of the word
[1:01:23] and believe in the Supernatural and the
[1:01:25] spirit of God and say you know what we
[1:01:27] might have a we might have a young one
[1:01:28] amongst us we might have a new convert
[1:01:30] amongst us somebody might have come in
[1:01:32] off the street and all of a sudden we
[1:01:34] all get together in one mind and one
[1:01:35] Accord start praying oh God would you
[1:01:37] deliver them would you heal them would
[1:01:39] you bring forth your power in the
[1:01:40] service anoint the man of God anoint my
[1:01:42] ears Lord I'm expecting the supernatural
[1:01:45] tonight I'm expecting our young people
[1:01:47] to be filled with the Holy Ghost just
[1:01:48] like the Bible said while Peter yet
[1:01:50] spank these words the only ghost fell
[1:01:52] upon all them that believed I believe
[1:01:54] there ought to be an expectation in the
[1:01:56] house of God where people come together
[1:01:57] and we look for the supernatural have we
[1:02:00] gotten so churchified that we don't
[1:02:02] either come on a Wednesday night and we
[1:02:04] don't even expect the power of God to
[1:02:06] sweep through the building and we just
[1:02:07] become good old denominational
[1:02:09] Christians and all we do is we want to
[1:02:11] listen for a good word or have we come
[1:02:13] here to look for the presence of
[1:02:15] almighty God to come and change life
[1:02:17] Christ to deliver people to cast demons
[1:02:20] out of the sanctuary to change Hearts to
[1:02:22] change attitudes
[1:02:24] oh Hallelujah that's what I'm looking
[1:02:27] for the prophet of God said it takes
[1:02:29] atmosphere to do things where we ought
[1:02:31] to start creating an atmosphere there
[1:02:33] ought to be a heart of expectation there
[1:02:35] ought to be a heart of praise
[1:02:37] that ought to be something inside of you
[1:02:39] oh if you if you're preaching something
[1:02:41] you heard before why did you just start
[1:02:43] thinking about those love Secrets oh
[1:02:45] Lord I remember when you saved me
[1:02:47] I remember when you delivered me oh God
[1:02:49] I remember when you came to me and my
[1:02:52] pit of despair oh he's a savior oh he's
[1:02:55] a Healer oh he's the Mighty God I
[1:02:59] remembered I didn't know which way was
[1:03:00] up which way was town which way was
[1:03:03] right which way was left I didn't know
[1:03:05] where to go but oh I heard somebody call
[1:03:07] my name oh the sweetest voice you ever
[1:03:10] did here is when Jesus Christ calls you
[1:03:13] to repentance that you realize that
[1:03:15] you're a sinner that all have sinned and
[1:03:17] come short of the glory of God and you
[1:03:19] can call on the name of the Lord and by
[1:03:20] Divine promise he said You shall be
[1:03:23] saved
[1:03:25] look friends I don't want to get people
[1:03:27] to a church I want to get them to
[1:03:29] Calvary
[1:03:30] I want to get them under that bleach
[1:03:32] blood of Jesus Christ that'll set them
[1:03:35] free from all of their complexes and all
[1:03:37] of their sins I think that's what we
[1:03:39] need tonight we need to be set free we
[1:03:41] need to be washed we need to be cleansed
[1:03:43] by the word of God
[1:03:46] I'm tired of church Hannity I'm tired of
[1:03:49] looking for man's acceptance I'm tired
[1:03:51] of thinking about man's opinion I got
[1:03:53] one duty that's to preach the word of
[1:03:55] God I got one duty that's to live the
[1:03:57] word of God I got one duty that is to
[1:03:59] manifest the message of the hour and the
[1:04:02] most wicked age that has ever been in
[1:04:04] all of the humanity I am that chosen
[1:04:06] vessel you've been chosen for this
[1:04:08] you've been ordained to Manifest this
[1:04:10] message
[1:04:12] there ought to be a praise coming forth
[1:04:14] out of your mouth an expectation for the
[1:04:16] supernatural why not why can't we hear a
[1:04:19] sound of a Russian Mighty Wind drop down
[1:04:21] into the building
[1:04:24] why can't we see our young ones fall out
[1:04:26] in the presence of God and give their
[1:04:28] heart to God
[1:04:30] why can't we be like Hattie Wright
[1:04:35] that's nothing but the truth
[1:04:38] you get that kind of attitude oh
[1:04:40] Hallelujah
[1:04:41] things will start happening
[1:04:44] when you just start saying that's
[1:04:45] nothing but the truth

[1:04:51] that's nothing but the truth oh you get
[1:04:54] a whole people

[1:05:12] all of a sudden give them oh why because
[1:05:14] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:05:17] and forever if you see the pattern in
[1:05:19] the word why don't you look for the
[1:05:21] pattern in your own life
[1:05:23] oh I feel good
[1:05:25] Oh Glory to God when I see God do
[1:05:28] something in his word that means he can
[1:05:30] do it in my life
[1:05:32] that means he can change me Lord if you

[1:05:52] start looking for it start believing for
[1:05:55] it start expecting it start saying hey
[1:05:57] that's nothing but the truth
[1:06:00] oh Hallelujah
[1:06:02] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:06:06] see the way you're living
[1:06:09] yeah well
[1:06:11] how are you living
[1:06:14] I mean do you see the fruits of Christ
[1:06:16] in your life
[1:06:20] do you see that same
[1:06:22] spirit
[1:06:24] well you know this just has to be more
[1:06:25] of a revelation because
[1:06:27] I don't know how let's explain it but
[1:06:30] even though I've never met the prophet
[1:06:33] and I've only listened to his voice
[1:06:36] I know his character
[1:06:40] because his character was a word
[1:06:42] character
[1:06:43] his character was the same character of
[1:06:46] Our Lord because it was the Lord Jesus
[1:06:49] the spirit of the Lord that was moving
[1:06:52] in his life
[1:06:53] well that's not too fanatical for you I
[1:06:56] hope not because I believe that's the
[1:06:57] same thing that's happened to each one
[1:06:58] of us
[1:06:59] is that the spirit of the Lord by the
[1:07:02] word of God what did Jesus say he said
[1:07:04] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:07:06] spirit and they are life therefore the
[1:07:09] spirit and life of the word comes into
[1:07:12] the believer and then it produces the
[1:07:15] Life of Christ not just on Sunday not
[1:07:18] just on Wednesday this ain't a workup
[1:07:20] this is some not something that you
[1:07:22] imagine this isn't just just something
[1:07:24] some feel-good thing I got at some
[1:07:27] special meetings that wears off on me
[1:07:28] after two or three weeks if it wears off
[1:07:31] then you aren't changed but if you can
[1:07:33] ever be changed if you can ever become a
[1:07:35] new creature and Jesus Christ where old
[1:07:38] things pass away and All Things become
[1:07:40] new and you've been birthed by the Holy
[1:07:42] Spirit and the fire of God is coming to
[1:07:45] your heart and it's burned out all the
[1:07:47] things of the world and you've been
[1:07:48] changed you no longer think the same you
[1:07:51] no longer dress the same because it's
[1:07:53] not you living
[1:07:57] it's Christ Living
[1:08:01] then if it's Christ Living how does
[1:08:03] Christ talk
[1:08:06] how does Christ troubleshoot
[1:08:09] how does Christ pay the bills
[1:08:12] how does Christ go to the job how does
[1:08:15] Christ respond look at your life
[1:08:22] we can be changed tomorrow
[1:08:25] there's going to be a lot of
[1:08:25] disappointed people
[1:08:28] foreign
[1:08:31] there's going to be some people
[1:08:33] who miss it
[1:08:36] I don't want to be one of them
[1:08:39] Lord as soon as you get the attitude
[1:08:43] you look at the life
[1:08:45] you look at the attitude as soon as you
[1:08:47] get the attitude to use the word for an
[1:08:50] excuse you know you have the wrong
[1:08:52] spirit
[1:08:54] well I'm predestinated I can't miss it
[1:08:58] Paul said do weep do we sin because God
[1:09:01] forbid do we sin because grace abound
[1:09:03] is it something along those no
[1:09:06] and if if you find yourself where you're
[1:09:08] using the word as an excuse
[1:09:10] for your condition then you have the
[1:09:12] wrong spirit
[1:09:15] I would rather be be living wrong
[1:09:20] and have a spirit of repentance and say
[1:09:23] Lord I don't want to be this way then to
[1:09:26] be some heady high-minded puffed up
[1:09:28] so-called message believer I'm going in
[1:09:31] a Rapture and if you don't come to my
[1:09:34] degree in my education and my church
[1:09:36] you're just all going to hell bless God
[1:09:38] we made it we're in the message of the
[1:09:41] hour and my goodness we're all going if
[1:09:43] you come under our roof

[1:09:48] it the prophet of God said how many near
[1:09:50] as the Holy Ghost

[1:10:36] give me your spirit when you look into
[1:10:37] the word if you have the right Spirit
[1:10:39] what's the evidence that it's the Lord
[1:10:41] working in your life is that you say
[1:10:43] Amen to the word
[1:10:45] it's that ability to receive the word
[1:10:47] that when it comes forth there's
[1:10:49] something in your heart that says Lord I
[1:10:51] believe it I Want to Be Right Lord help

[1:13:28] we've received such a great revelation
[1:13:31] such a great gift from God
[1:13:36] I'm reminded of how Paul would have been
[1:13:39] delivered but yet it was because this
[1:13:41] abundance of Revelation that was given
[1:13:43] unto Paul he had a thorn in his flesh
[1:13:48] you feel you get so religious and lifted
[1:13:51] up God will allow something to come into
[1:13:53] your life I'm not saying Paul was
[1:13:55] but God will allow something to come in
[1:13:56] your life and humble you
[1:13:58] and get you back to where you're calling

[1:14:18] see if everything is going just right
[1:14:20] see if the world still has got love so
[1:14:23] much

[1:14:39] box of rattlesnakes he's trying to give
[1:14:41] you some some uh uh um app or some
[1:14:44] program or some uh membership to
[1:14:47] something to steal away your time
[1:14:50] well just receive the word if it's for
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:54] and it's time to clean house it's time
[1:14:56] to get down to business and I just love
[1:14:58] here as we read in our opening scripture
[1:15:00] is how John right in here in the in the
[1:15:03] he's writing the revelation of Jesus
[1:15:04] Christ and he says the reason that he
[1:15:07] was on the Isle of Patmos why was he
[1:15:09] there
[1:15:10] he was there for the word of God and the
[1:15:13] testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:15:16] I like that
[1:15:18] if I'm going to be in a condition if I'm
[1:15:20] going to be going through something let
[1:15:22] me let it be for the word of God and for
[1:15:23] the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:15:26] he said I am your brother and companion
[1:15:28] and tribulation you know I like that I
[1:15:31] am your brother and companion in
[1:15:33] Tribulation we're in this together
[1:15:36] if anybody could have said well you
[1:15:38] don't know you don't know you none of
[1:15:40] y'all have gone through what I've gone
[1:15:41] through I mean
[1:15:42] you know I was there with the Lord and
[1:15:44] and I was there after he was crucified
[1:15:46] and and if you only knew all the turmoil
[1:15:49] and torment that I've been through even
[1:15:50] before they've made me a Castaway out
[1:15:52] here on the aisle but yeah look at this
[1:15:54] look at what what John is saying I am
[1:15:56] your companion and tribulation he's not
[1:15:58] acting like I've done something more
[1:16:01] than anybody else but he's saying look
[1:16:03] we're in this together
[1:16:05] we're going through this together did
[1:16:07] Paul not say look when one member
[1:16:08] suffers we all suffer when one rejoices
[1:16:11] we all Rejoice I I like that that uh
[1:16:14] John writing that that Spirit of Christ
[1:16:16] say look I'm your fellow companion in
[1:16:19] Tribulation look we're going through
[1:16:21] this together church I want to know
[1:16:22] we're going through this together none
[1:16:24] of you are doing this alone if the devil
[1:16:26] has made you feel like you're all alone
[1:16:28] and you're going through this all alone
[1:16:30] in your family problems and your family
[1:16:32] history and what you're going through in
[1:16:34] your medical problems You Are Not Alone
[1:16:37] you have a group of Believers standing
[1:16:39] with you in prayer why don't you bring
[1:16:41] that need to the Lord and I we will see
[1:16:43] you get the victory
[1:16:45] but the devil wants to make you feel
[1:16:47] like you're all alone and that you're
[1:16:49] going through it all by yourself but oh
[1:16:51] if you can hear the words of the Lord
[1:16:52] say look I am your companion and
[1:16:55] tribulation oh he is the high priest
[1:16:57] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:16:59] your infirmities
[1:17:02] John was in a bad place
[1:17:05] they're on the Isle of Patmos
[1:17:08] you know our pastor was preaching about
[1:17:10] spiritual environment
[1:17:12] John was in a bad place
[1:17:15] I like what our our Pastor said he said
[1:17:17] the one place that Satan can't Thrive or
[1:17:19] grow is in a holy spirit environment
[1:17:25] I say God I want to produce a holy
[1:17:27] spirit environment
[1:17:30] that where the things of this world and
[1:17:33] this Satan's Eden don't so easily trip
[1:17:36] me up and be setting sins or so right
[1:17:39] there at the door that it seems like
[1:17:40] every time I peek my head out I'm just
[1:17:42] getting hit every single time but no
[1:17:44] I've got my guard up I'm in prayer I've
[1:17:47] created such an atmosphere of prayer
[1:17:49] such an atmosphere of faith that I'm in
[1:17:52] that Holy Ghost anointing that I'm able
[1:17:54] to live that Victorious life but see
[1:17:56] when you start to let down the bar and
[1:17:58] you start to let down your prayer life
[1:18:00] and you start to stop listening to the
[1:18:01] word and you start to take the wrong
[1:18:03] attitude all of a sudden you find
[1:18:05] yourself stepping out behind the word
[1:18:07] and that's where that punch comes
[1:18:12] but I just want to uh
[1:18:16] bring this out because it here John is
[1:18:19] on the Isle of Patmos there
[1:18:21] he's been a Castaway he's been in prison
[1:18:23] and it was in this environment where no
[1:18:26] doubt you got the Scorpions and the
[1:18:28] snakes and the rocks and it's it the
[1:18:30] miserable living conditions but it's
[1:18:33] here on the Isle of Pat Mission opatmus
[1:18:35] means my killing
[1:18:36] because they had tried to kill John John
[1:18:39] was writing the Epistles and then now
[1:18:40] they tried to kill John and now they
[1:18:43] they made him a Castaway they cast him
[1:18:45] out on the Isle of Patmos which Patmos
[1:18:47] means my killing me uh my killing
[1:18:50] and just think now the enemy is trying
[1:18:52] to kill John they're trying to do away
[1:18:54] with him
[1:18:56] This was meant for John's destruction
[1:18:58] like get rid of this guy
[1:19:02] the enemy don't you know the enemy's
[1:19:04] trying to kill you he's trying to
[1:19:05] destroy you
[1:19:06] trying to do the same thing but I like I
[1:19:09] like how how Joseph had the Revelation
[1:19:11] when his brothers oh they were repented
[1:19:13] to him and said oh you know we we should
[1:19:15] have done this thing and he had the
[1:19:16] Revelation look what you meant for evil
[1:19:19] God has met for my good oh I tell you
[1:19:22] what if you're going through a trial
[1:19:24] right now and maybe you're just sick and
[1:19:26] tired of going through that trial just
[1:19:28] tell that Old Devil what you meant for
[1:19:30] evil
[1:19:31] God has intended for my good you just
[1:19:34] give that Old Devil a black eye
[1:19:37] tell that Old Devil he ain't one no
[1:19:39] victories he ain't done nothing he don't
[1:19:41] amount to nothing I might be suffering
[1:19:43] in my body I might be in pain I might be
[1:19:46] out there on the Isle of Patmos just to
[1:19:48] Cast Away and I might be out here in all
[1:19:50] of my misery and all of my pain but Old
[1:19:53] Devil all the what you can throw at me
[1:19:55] God's intended it for my good because
[1:19:57] it's bringing forth a character of gold
[1:20:00] tried and Fire
[1:20:02] well it's time we start take the word
[1:20:04] what the word and whoop the devil
[1:20:08] I don't know about you but I I like to
[1:20:10] take the word and whoop the devil
[1:20:14] what the devil means
[1:20:17] to destroy you look no weapon formed
[1:20:19] against you is going to prosper
[1:20:22] sickness death
[1:20:24] no weapon formed against you can prosper
[1:20:27] so just looking at this here John is
[1:20:29] he's banished to the island a Castaway
[1:20:31] he's in this horrible condition and I
[1:20:34] just think it's amazing how when you you
[1:20:36] even look at the history and you try to
[1:20:37] study it out you don't find John
[1:20:39] complaining about his condition
[1:20:42] you don't find John writing about how
[1:20:44] bad it was and writing about his
[1:20:46] infirmities you don't hear
[1:20:49] any of those things John talking about
[1:20:51] it
[1:20:52] look up the history even try to find
[1:20:54] things about the Alabama's look into all
[1:20:56] those things and try to fight it you
[1:20:58] don't hear John talking about that and I
[1:21:00] just want to say that it might look
[1:21:01] really bad for you might have been sick
[1:21:03] a long time
[1:21:04] the odds might be stacked up against you
[1:21:08] the doctors are saying look we've done
[1:21:10] all that we can do and I just don't know
[1:21:12] how you're going to be healed
[1:21:14] sorry this is the case we we we we've
[1:21:17] tried our best we've done all that we
[1:21:18] can do and you feel like all the odds
[1:21:20] are against me now
[1:21:22] you know it reminds me in scripture how
[1:21:24] one day that Jonathan was with his armor
[1:21:26] Bearer I believe Jonathan wanted to get
[1:21:28] something done his daddy was you know uh
[1:21:30] Saul was just
[1:21:32] something back and they weren't going to
[1:21:33] battle he said you know what come on
[1:21:35] Armor bear
[1:21:37] why don't we go over to the uh
[1:21:38] Philistines camp and put a whooping on
[1:21:41] him
[1:21:42] he said what is it to God
[1:21:45] that he would deliver us by many or by a
[1:21:47] few
[1:21:48] I said praise God I like that kind of
[1:21:51] Faith that's a man that knew what he was
[1:21:53] talking about he knew the victory wasn't
[1:21:55] because of their Spears he knew the
[1:21:57] victory wasn't because of their might he
[1:21:59] knew the victory wasn't because of their
[1:22:00] strategy their victory was because they
[1:22:03] were the sons of God and I want to tell
[1:22:05] you that's the same thing for you
[1:22:06] tonight your Victory isn't by your might
[1:22:08] your Victory isn't about how good you
[1:22:10] can quote the Bible your Victory doesn't
[1:22:12] know about how good you know the message
[1:22:14] your Victory is Jesus Christ your
[1:22:18] Victory is the word of God and faith is
[1:22:21] the victory that overcometh the world it
[1:22:23] ain't about what you did it's about what
[1:22:25] God's already done
[1:22:27] Faith looks past the odds
[1:22:31] Faith looks past the circumstance Faith
[1:22:33] looks at the Unseen
[1:22:37] Faith looks to the promise
[1:22:41] Faith doesn't know any defeat
[1:22:44] Faith creates
[1:22:48] Faith makes things come where no things
[1:22:50] could be brought
[1:22:53] faith is Victorious
[1:22:57] faith is that Sixth Sense
[1:23:00] I love the story but brother Branham
[1:23:02] tells about
[1:23:03] a couple had come to
[1:23:06] ask brother Branham for prayer
[1:23:09] for their son he had diphtheria I
[1:23:11] believe it's called
[1:23:14] and they had to dress them all up like a
[1:23:15] priest just to get him into the hospital
[1:23:18] and he came in there and brother Branham
[1:23:20] says I just prayed a little simple
[1:23:23] common prayer
[1:23:27] just bowed my head I just prayed a
[1:23:30] little simple common prayer
[1:23:33] and said amen
[1:23:35] and the couple they're in the hospital
[1:23:37] room
[1:23:39] the doctors have given them up it's
[1:23:41] gotten to the heart
[1:23:42] worst case they've seen
[1:23:44] he's gone
[1:23:46] the machines and all the the diagrams
[1:23:49] and everything impossible for them to
[1:23:51] come back he's in a coma he's gone
[1:23:55] a little
[1:23:56] simple common prayer
[1:24:00] I'm the couple upon that prayer
[1:24:03] when he said amen they got up
[1:24:07] said oh thank you Lord Jesus
[1:24:10] for healing our son
[1:24:12] isn't that wonderful sweetie
[1:24:15] and he started to hug each other and
[1:24:17] they started to rejoice
[1:24:21] what was it it was faith
[1:24:24] in the promise
[1:24:26] it was faith in the word
[1:24:29] it was faith in the prayer
[1:24:32] and faith is the substance
[1:24:36] not a hope so
[1:24:38] maybe so but faith is a substance of
[1:24:41] things hoped for it's the evidence of
[1:24:43] Things Not Seen
[1:24:46] so in the face of all the medical
[1:24:49] reports in the face of all the
[1:24:51] opposition the prophet of God with Saint
[1:24:53] Lucas he said oh I'll never forget it
[1:24:57] there was another nurse in there says I
[1:24:59] don't think you understand
[1:25:01] we've never seen a case this bad before
[1:25:05] he's gone what do you mean he's healed
[1:25:07] you see you can't talk like that
[1:25:11] Prophet said I I I'll never forget it
[1:25:14] the man went over and said put his hand
[1:25:16] on her shoulder said
[1:25:18] now dear
[1:25:19] you're trained
[1:25:21] to look at all those machines
[1:25:24] you're trained to look at all the
[1:25:26] instruments because that's all that you
[1:25:28] know to do
[1:25:31] but see we're not looking at an
[1:25:33] instrument
[1:25:34] we're not looking at machines
[1:25:38] we're looking at the promise
[1:25:41] oh Hallelujah I'm not looking at
[1:25:45] instruments tonight I'm not looking at
[1:25:47] my own ability I'm not looking up my
[1:25:50] flesh I'm not looking at my faults I'm
[1:25:53] not looking at my failures I am looking
[1:25:55] at a Divine promise
[1:25:58] he said I have perfected forever them I
[1:26:02] have sanctified
[1:26:05] that's what he did
[1:26:08] he said that he might present himself a
[1:26:10] glorious Church
[1:26:12] without spot or wrinkle now what are you
[1:26:15] looking at
[1:26:17] come on some Satan's been trying to beat
[1:26:19] some of you up
[1:26:21] if you're in this fight
[1:26:23] Satan's been trying to beat some of you
[1:26:25] up and point to your past and point to
[1:26:26] your failures and try to tell you you
[1:26:28] ain't good enough and you just failed
[1:26:30] again and you went back on that website
[1:26:31] and you just ain't no good and you're
[1:26:33] giving all your time over to these video
[1:26:34] games and all of these things and as
[1:26:36] long as you keep living under that
[1:26:38] condemnation you'll never come out from
[1:26:41] the bondage that Satan's trying to keep
[1:26:42] you in but if you'll finally just say
[1:26:44] devil shut your mouth I am a Son of God
[1:26:47] I have been made free and who the Son of
[1:26:50] God has made free is free indeed get
[1:26:52] your hands off of me you dirty rotten
[1:26:54] devil I'm gonna serve God
[1:26:58] I'm gonna walk in my healing I'm gonna
[1:27:00] walk in my Deliverance I'm in a walking
[1:27:02] Victory why because I'm looking at a
[1:27:04] promise
[1:27:07] oh Hallelujah that's the faith we're
[1:27:09] talking about
[1:27:10] that's the type of Faith that's the
[1:27:12] victory that's the kind of faith that
[1:27:14] produces an atmosphere that's the kind
[1:27:16] of faith that produces a holy ghost
[1:27:18] environment
[1:27:21] that's the kind of faith I want to have
[1:27:26] brother Branham says this in the
[1:27:28] masterpiece
[1:27:31] he says when we see Saint Paul Peter
[1:27:34] James
[1:27:38] John and all those who wrote the word
[1:27:46] and they wrote the word they wrote
[1:27:48] became become alive and lived
[1:27:52] and they wrote the word they wrote
[1:27:53] become alive and it lived and it lived
[1:27:56] and when we find
[1:27:58] after it began to get ripe
[1:28:00] John began to write in Epistles he was
[1:28:04] thrown on the Isle of Patmos after being
[1:28:06] burnt in oil
[1:28:07] for 24 hours
[1:28:13] maybe I should read that again
[1:28:18] he was thrown on the Isle of Patmos
[1:28:20] after being burnt in oil
[1:28:24] for 24 hours
[1:28:27] but the word must come forth
[1:28:31] it's got to be wrote
[1:28:33] they couldn't boil the holy ghost out of
[1:28:36] him with oil
[1:28:38] so he come forth his work wasn't
[1:28:41] finished he died a natural death now
[1:28:44] think about it in that condition and
[1:28:47] that trial they tried to stop him but
[1:28:50] God had to work for him to do
[1:28:52] I don't want to say right now in the
[1:28:55] midst of Satan's Eden
[1:28:57] where Satan is the God of this evil age
[1:28:59] he's the god of fashion he's the god of
[1:29:02] sports he's the god of entertainment
[1:29:04] he's the god of the internet he he's the
[1:29:07] God of all of these uh uh uh seducing
[1:29:10] spirits that are trying to seduce your
[1:29:12] mind and seduce your life and seduce you
[1:29:14] for your time he's the God of this evil
[1:29:17] age and everything is designed to stop
[1:29:19] the Bride of Jesus Christ but he cannot
[1:29:22] stop you because you have a job to do
[1:29:26] there is a work for the Bride of Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ to do
[1:29:30] I like how Jesus told Simon he's looking
[1:29:34] Simon
[1:29:36] the devil would sift you like wheat
[1:29:39] but I have prayed for you
[1:29:42] that your faith would not fail
[1:29:44] oh thank you Lord Jesus you know Jesus
[1:29:47] Christ prayed for you
[1:29:49] not only did he pray for you he
[1:29:51] prophesied over your life even over that
[1:29:53] you know the prophet of God said he
[1:29:55] spoke you into existence
[1:29:58] that means you're the word of God
[1:30:00] then if you're the word of God that
[1:30:02] means you can't fail
[1:30:04] that means you can't miss it
[1:30:07] oh that gets me I can't hear enough I
[1:30:09] tell me all day long who I am in Jesus
[1:30:12] Christ I don't get tired of it I don't
[1:30:14] get tired I'm sorry
[1:30:16] call me prideful I don't care
[1:30:18] well and my Lord tells me you're an
[1:30:20] overcomer you can do all things through
[1:30:22] Jesus Christ that strengthens you
[1:30:24] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:30:26] that is in the world according as he
[1:30:28] hath chosen you in him before the
[1:30:30] foundation of the world that you should
[1:30:32] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:30:35] love blessed is the man whom the Lord
[1:30:37] will not impuce in there is therefore
[1:30:39] now no condemnation to them that are in
[1:30:42] Christ Jesus oh this is the secret the
[1:30:45] word is in the bride as it was in Mary
[1:30:47] she has the mind of Christ she knows
[1:30:50] what to do with the word or she stands
[1:30:52] still because I can't I can't hear it
[1:30:54] enough just keep telling me over and
[1:30:56] over because I love hearing love secrets
[1:30:58] from my Grooms but my my bridegroom oh
[1:31:01] just tell me more just like the song
[1:31:03] would say Elise or tell me more oh
[1:31:05] Rebecca I imagine she couldn't just get
[1:31:08] enough of it why don't you tell another
[1:31:09] story about my savior why don't you tell
[1:31:12] me another story about my redeemer why
[1:31:14] don't you tell me another story about my
[1:31:16] bridegroom I just can't hear enough
[1:31:18] because could you imagine when she
[1:31:20] finally got to her bride room oh Behold
[1:31:22] the Lamb of God the Lamb of God started
[1:31:24] to say your bone of my bone you are
[1:31:27] Flesh of My Flesh you are life of my
[1:31:29] life you are power of my power you are
[1:31:32] my pride everything that I am you are
[1:31:35] she is him you cannot fail I
[1:31:38] predestinated you not to fall I've
[1:31:40] called you in the most wicked age that
[1:31:42] has ever been on the face of the Earth
[1:31:43] but I'm proud of you you're going to
[1:31:45] make it why because I've predestinated
[1:31:47] you you cannot fall
[1:31:49] oh I can't hear enough of it it makes me
[1:31:53] excited it makes me want to shout
[1:31:55] because it's who I am
[1:32:00] go on keep telling me I ain't gonna stop
[1:32:02] you
[1:32:04] you ever had somebody give you a
[1:32:05] compliment
[1:32:08] why'd you stop
[1:32:12] go on a little bit longer
[1:32:14] it's like the prophet of God said one
[1:32:16] time
[1:32:17] somebody gave a compliment
[1:32:19] the brothers the the man said I don't
[1:32:21] like compliments
[1:32:23] brother Brandon said I do
[1:32:25] the difference between me and you
[1:32:28] as I'm telling the truth
[1:32:32] well I want to tell you
[1:32:34] go on I love to hear the words of my
[1:32:38] Lord telling me who I am telling me that
[1:32:40] I can make it telling me I can do all
[1:32:42] things tell me go eat all the world
[1:32:44] these signs shall follow them that
[1:32:46] believe why because there's something
[1:32:48] inside of me that says Amen to the word
[1:32:50] and I want to see that word coming to
[1:32:53] materialization and see the fruits of
[1:32:55] that word on display
[1:32:58] not to make me somebody no
[1:33:02] no
[1:33:04] that ain't it
[1:33:05] but there's a deep calling to a deep
[1:33:09] to see that word come into manifestation
[1:33:14] we heard this Wednesday I mean we heard
[1:33:16] this Sunday night
[1:33:19] God of this evil age we find now this
[1:33:21] evil age is to prove to Satan
[1:33:25] she is not like Eve
[1:33:28] that she is not that type of woman
[1:33:32] and she will be Tried by his word
[1:33:35] the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by
[1:33:38] the word
[1:33:39] and Adam's bride believed every bit of
[1:33:41] the word all but confused
[1:33:43] on one promise
[1:33:45] that is the same yesterday today and
[1:33:47] forever
[1:33:48] today see but failed on One Promise
[1:33:51] under the temptation of the enemy face
[1:33:55] to face
[1:33:58] and now the people that's called for his
[1:34:00] name of course is his bride
[1:34:03] she is to come in contact Again by the
[1:34:06] same thing
[1:34:07] not by just denominational truth or
[1:34:10] something but
[1:34:12] every
[1:34:13] word
[1:34:16] where did he fall
[1:34:19] by disbelieving one word
[1:34:22] under the temptation of the enemy
[1:34:26] face to face
[1:34:28] now
[1:34:30] I can't say
[1:34:31] I can't interpret that
[1:34:34] under the interpretation of the enemy
[1:34:35] face to face only other than
[1:34:37] looking back and knowing what the
[1:34:40] original sin was in the Garden of Eden
[1:34:42] and how Satan incarnated The Serpent and
[1:34:45] beguiled Eve
[1:34:47] and preached another gospel face to face
[1:34:50] and got her to believe a lie
[1:34:54] if we've ever been face to face with
[1:34:57] demons and Devils before and Satan's
[1:35:00] Eden
[1:35:01] to beguile you on your I mean on your
[1:35:04] phone and on the internet and face to
[1:35:06] face you can't even walk out the door
[1:35:08] anymore about about being defiled by
[1:35:11] people stripped down and undressed if
[1:35:13] sin has ever been right in your face
[1:35:15] under Temptation again look we're right
[1:35:19] back
[1:35:20] we've come right back to the end to
[1:35:22] where we're face to face with sin again
[1:35:25] that same Temptation that Eve was faced
[1:35:28] with now it's right in our face
[1:35:31] the prophet of God said what is it the
[1:35:33] world is heading to a climax why the
[1:35:36] spirit of lawlessness moral Decay
[1:35:38] scientific religion has led to the cage
[1:35:40] of every hateful and unclean birds as
[1:35:43] the Bible said
[1:35:45] the prophet pointed out that Eve did not
[1:35:47] willfully just walk away and say I don't
[1:35:49] believe believe in God
[1:35:52] but he said it was the spirit of air
[1:35:57] we're not exempt from this church
[1:36:00] if we're not careful we will give over
[1:36:03] to a spirit of air that will make us
[1:36:06] think that we're okay in the condition
[1:36:08] but we must come back to the word of God
[1:36:12] we must come back to the urum thumam we
[1:36:15] must look into the message we must
[1:36:16] listen to the voice of Malachi 4 that
[1:36:19] says check up in your life
[1:36:21] look at your everyday life and see if
[1:36:24] you're bearing the fruits of the word
[1:36:26] it's time for a checkup if we're not
[1:36:28] careful what happens you're given over
[1:36:31] to a spirit of error you start to allow
[1:36:33] yourself to drift off the word of God
[1:36:35] and then oh
[1:36:37] oh what does the word say and then you
[1:36:39] believe a lie and you be damned for it
[1:36:40] and what happens then a strong delusion
[1:36:43] comes upon you and we have seen men that
[1:36:46] have believed this message and preached
[1:36:48] this message for 20 or 30 years come
[1:36:52] under a strong delusion
[1:36:55] because they they came face to face
[1:36:58] within well we just call it like it is
[1:37:01] they came face to face with the serpent
[1:37:04] again they came face to face with the
[1:37:07] devil's lies they came face to face with
[1:37:10] all of that nonsense and they didn't
[1:37:12] have the ability to take sides with the
[1:37:14] word
[1:37:16] they started to reason against it found
[1:37:19] themselves in a spirit of air and
[1:37:21] watched some of them how they walked
[1:37:23] they're with the message
[1:37:25] then they're
[1:37:28] I'm message-ish
[1:37:30] he's a man of God and literally walk
[1:37:33] them walk out from underneath the
[1:37:35] message
[1:37:36] oh I believe you know oh we're all
[1:37:38] Brothers we're all sisters he was a man
[1:37:40] of God he just got off at the end and
[1:37:42] they come right under that Antichrist
[1:37:44] murdering spirit
[1:37:46] it's not long until their their brother
[1:37:49] their sister well we just don't see it
[1:37:52] that way until all of a sudden that
[1:37:54] Spirit of air takes them into a strong
[1:37:55] delusion and an antichrist Spirit where
[1:37:58] they're now enemies to the faith
[1:38:01] and those Brothers you should not put
[1:38:03] your feet under the same table with
[1:38:05] according to the word
[1:38:07] unless it's to rebuke them and call them
[1:38:09] to repentance
[1:38:11] it's an antichrist spirit I say I pray
[1:38:14] oh God may I stay behind that word may I
[1:38:16] take sides with every word
[1:38:19] or if you look young people if you
[1:38:21] haven't been met with it yet the devil
[1:38:23] will try to get you to doubt this
[1:38:25] message
[1:38:28] and if he has it
[1:38:31] what are you doing
[1:38:33] maybe you haven't immersed yourself in
[1:38:35] it maybe you haven't made a declaration
[1:38:37] that you believe it maybe it hasn't had
[1:38:38] an effect on your life but when this
[1:38:40] message starts to have an effect and
[1:38:42] claim on your life and you start to walk
[1:38:45] in the truth of it the devil will be
[1:38:48] right there to challenge you on your
[1:38:50] faith and challenge if you really
[1:38:52] believe this message and you'll start to
[1:38:54] try to show The Faults he'll start to
[1:38:56] try to show the failures which there are
[1:38:59] none
[1:39:01] none
[1:39:03] no it's perfect it's a perfect message
[1:39:07] oh go ahead and dig in there and show me
[1:39:10] something
[1:39:13] okay fine that's what made it the
[1:39:15] masterpiece
[1:39:18] show your little blip on the radar it
[1:39:20] doesn't know it ain't a thing to me
[1:39:23] the only thing it means to me that oh if
[1:39:26] God could bring that kind of message
[1:39:28] through a man
[1:39:29] if God could bring the revelation of
[1:39:31] Jesus Christ through a man
[1:39:34] if God could catch a man
[1:39:37] up into the heavens into a constellation
[1:39:40] of angels and say go back and preach the
[1:39:42] revelation of the Seven Seals oh and to
[1:39:45] know he was a brother in Christ that he
[1:39:47] needed God just as much as I needed God
[1:39:50] if it wasn't for the grace of God you
[1:39:52] realize the prophet would have took his
[1:39:53] own life he would have been the murderer
[1:39:56] he tried to kill them boys I think he
[1:39:58] tried to kill a sheriff for his dog he
[1:40:00] tried to take his own life because of
[1:40:02] the despair if it wasn't for the grace
[1:40:05] of God but he had a work to do and just
[1:40:10] as they couldn't take John's life they
[1:40:12] tried to boil him for 24 hours they
[1:40:15] tried to take the life out of him even
[1:40:17] brother Branham tried to take his own
[1:40:19] life but there was something inside of
[1:40:21] him that said not even you brother
[1:40:22] Brandon could take your own life because
[1:40:24] I got a work for you to do and I want to
[1:40:27] tell you pride of Jesus Christ the devil
[1:40:29] and this Satan's in he's trying to Snuff
[1:40:31] you out he's trying to stop you he's
[1:40:33] trying to kill you but the word must
[1:40:36] come forth just as John was
[1:40:38] predestinated to bring forth the written
[1:40:40] revelation of the revelation of Jesus
[1:40:43] Christ the bride has been called in the
[1:40:45] end time to manifest the revelation of
[1:40:48] Jesus Christ and to bring forth every
[1:40:51] word and to manifest it
[1:40:54] Oh Glory to God what can stop you
[1:40:59] what can separate you from the love of
[1:41:01] God
[1:41:02] can famine sickness
[1:41:05] come on
[1:41:07] musicians might as well come
[1:41:10] what can stop you from manifesting this
[1:41:13] message
[1:41:14] what can separate you from the word of
[1:41:16] God
[1:41:17] can your faults can your failures
[1:41:22] no nothing
[1:41:24] nothing can stop why because God has
[1:41:27] predestinated you that you have a work
[1:41:30] to do and that's to believe every single
[1:41:32] word of this message
[1:41:34] you confide it you can kick and scream
[1:41:37] you can try to doubt it but oh just as
[1:41:40] they couldn't boil it out of John
[1:41:43] they said we don't know what to do with
[1:41:45] you I'll go put you on an island all by
[1:41:47] yourself and just think
[1:41:50] oh I love this
[1:41:52] just think John now he's on the Isle of
[1:41:55] Patmos
[1:41:56] seems like the worst place to be
[1:42:00] and it's there in that condition now I
[1:42:03] think about your condition
[1:42:04] your trial Satan's Eden your struggles
[1:42:08] it was in like it was in that condition
[1:42:11] John says
[1:42:13] and I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:42:15] Day
[1:42:18] chapter 4 he says oh and I looked and
[1:42:21] behold there was an entrance opened in
[1:42:22] heaven
[1:42:24] and I heard a voice of a trump saying
[1:42:26] come up hither John
[1:42:28] don't you realize it's in this Condition
[1:42:30] it's in this age that an entrance has
[1:42:34] been opened up into heaven to you though
[1:42:36] there's chaos and lewdness and seducing
[1:42:39] spirits and spirits of lawlessness and
[1:42:42] everything all around you in the worst
[1:42:44] condition there ever was John was caught
[1:42:47] up in the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:42:49] in Satan thing there's a bride who's
[1:42:51] been caught up in the revelation of
[1:42:53] Jesus Christ in an invisible Union
[1:42:55] together with him oh glory to God that
[1:42:59] makes me happy
[1:43:01] to think what we've become a part of you
[1:43:03] can play something please
[1:43:06] Oh Praise His wonderful name
[1:43:15] that's why you're here
[1:43:18] to prove
[1:43:20] to prove to Satan
[1:43:22] yeah you
[1:43:24] you
[1:43:27] that's why you're here
[1:43:30] this ain't by chance
[1:43:33] you don't believe this message by chance
[1:43:37] you are predestinated for it
[1:43:40] you were born for it
[1:43:45] pilate stood there
[1:43:49] he looked at our Lord and said
[1:43:52] are you a king
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:56] he said thou sayest
[1:43:59] to this end I was born
[1:44:02] and for this purpose
[1:44:05] I have come into the world
[1:44:07] are you the bride
[1:44:11] are you the bride
[1:44:13] I want to hear the prophet say
[1:44:16] want to hear the Bible say
[1:44:17] Lord you say it
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:21] can't we stand
[1:44:23] with the same faith that Jesus had and
[1:44:25] who he was
[1:44:27] say I am in the bride
[1:44:29] it's for this purpose
[1:44:32] that I was born it's for this purpose I
[1:44:36] came into the world
[1:44:38] for this purpose
[1:44:41] that I could prove
[1:44:44] God's word would not fail
[1:44:47] to prove that this bride
[1:44:49] is not like that Eve
[1:44:54] to prove I'm not going to sell my time
[1:44:58] not going to sell my efforts
[1:45:01] to spoil my Scourge to the things of the
[1:45:04] world
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:06] because I got a job to do
[1:45:09] and Satan's trying to take my joy
[1:45:12] trying to take my peace
[1:45:14] trying to take my health
[1:45:18] she's trying to take the joy of my
[1:45:20] salvation
[1:45:24] but I'm going to be like John
[1:45:27] out on the Isle of Patmos
[1:45:30] and they're in the face
[1:45:32] of all my infirmities
[1:45:35] having been boiled for over 24 hours or
[1:45:38] not Cast Away on an island with without
[1:45:40] any good food or water and and here I am
[1:45:44] in all of my infirmities I'm not gonna
[1:45:46] I'm not gonna speak of any of those
[1:45:48] things
[1:45:51] foreign
[1:45:54] of Jesus Christ
[1:45:56] I'm going to speak the words of God I'm
[1:46:00] going to speak the word that has been
[1:46:01] spoken of me
[1:46:04] and see that word be manifest let's all
[1:46:06] stand
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:14] prophet of God said when they signed the
[1:46:16] Constitution of the United States
[1:46:19] they put God in everything they did
[1:46:24] now they don't even have a meeting and
[1:46:27] they never even name his name
[1:46:29] that's right
[1:46:31] they depend on their loftiness of their
[1:46:33] science
[1:46:35] their cunniness of their science at the
[1:46:37] loot Bunch that's exactly right the
[1:46:40] whole world is swallowed up in ignorance
[1:46:41] of the Bible
[1:46:43] the whole world has turned from God
[1:46:46] but just think
[1:46:48] right out of the midst of all of that
[1:46:51] and all the church denominations and all
[1:46:54] their Seminary lewdness and everything
[1:46:57] God has took his prophet's word
[1:47:01] and chopped out a bride that will
[1:47:03] believe
[1:47:05] said he would do it
[1:47:08] he's hewed from that thing what he
[1:47:11] promised
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:16] that was speaking of you
[1:47:20] the whole world has turned from God
[1:47:23] but just think right out in the midst of
[1:47:25] all of that
[1:47:27] he's taking the prophet's word
[1:47:30] you out of the world
[1:47:32] he's hewed you out of the denominations
[1:47:33] he's hewed you out of sin he chose you
[1:47:37] and elected you that you would be that
[1:47:39] manifestation oh that does me so good
[1:47:41] let's sing this song
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:48] you alone
[1:47:49] are all I need
[1:47:54] foreign
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:48:15] you alone are all I need
[1:48:18] you alone
[1:48:20] are you alone
[1:48:25] I need

[1:48:48] [Applause]
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:49:07] foreign
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:35] [Applause]
[1:49:48] like the presence
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:50:23] I change
[1:50:26] forever are you afraid to sing it again
[1:50:29] to him or I am free
[1:50:34] his prison
[1:50:38] I am here
[1:50:42] in his presence
[1:50:50] [Music]
[1:51:01] pour your spirit out on me
[1:51:06] we fall just like the rain
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:13] saturate
[1:51:14] my thirsty Storm
[1:51:18] come and fall fresh on me
[1:51:23] feel my confidence
[1:51:28] heal my heart and make me
[1:51:34] Lord
[1:51:36] I
[1:51:38] need you now
[1:51:40] for your spirit now Lord I Seek You
[1:51:46] foreign
[1:51:51] [Applause]
[1:51:52] [Music]
[1:52:19] foreign
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:53:25] foreign
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:44] I think that
[1:53:46] that's what we all need
[1:53:51] to find time to
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:55] let the Holy Spirit be our portion
[1:53:58] and
[1:54:00] you know when we stand in the face of
[1:54:04] God's word we
[1:54:06] so many times feel short
[1:54:09] you know and
[1:54:11] and we feel that
[1:54:14] you know I'm just not making it
[1:54:17] but that's when my heart always goes to
[1:54:20] that great word called Grace
[1:54:25] you know that's what makes a difference
[1:54:28] is his grace
[1:54:31] it's his intervention
[1:54:34] in our lives
[1:54:36] to change the inevitable outcome
[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:42] something is said on a course of
[1:54:44] catastrophe
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:47] you've sowed so much
[1:54:50] that you know that you got to reap what
[1:54:53] you sow
[1:54:54] and everything looks impossible and the
[1:54:57] painting
[1:54:58] has you hanging over
[1:55:02] Hell by a thread
[1:55:04] then there's something that comes down
[1:55:06] from above
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:09] it's him
[1:55:12] and it's called Grace
[1:55:14] he comes and intervenes
[1:55:17] and changes
[1:55:20] what was inevitable
[1:55:22] and we can never forget that
[1:55:25] that Grace will work in our lives
[1:55:29] it'll work in our children's lives
[1:55:32] it'll work on our behalf for our
[1:55:35] problems
[1:55:37] that's how God does what he does
[1:55:40] he does it by grace
[1:55:42] and when you're undeserving
[1:55:45] he precedes that Grace with Mercy
[1:55:50] and it's by Mercy and Grace
[1:55:53] that we survive
[1:55:56] not by power
[1:55:58] not by might
[1:56:00] but by your spirit
[1:56:02] saith the Lord
[1:56:04] and I think the greatest call is we
[1:56:07] heard the word denied
[1:56:08] is where's our heart at
[1:56:11] [Music]
[1:56:13] you know where's our heart at and I
[1:56:15] think that's the real challenge
[1:56:17] that we face today is every man looking
[1:56:21] to find out where his heart is
[1:56:24] and I hope our hearts can slowly turn to
[1:56:27] the things that are above
[1:56:30] and I'd like you to pray for me I'd like
[1:56:34] to bring a little
[1:56:36] sermon if I could
[1:56:40] Sunday morning about the body
[1:56:43] and
[1:56:45] and so if you would want to study and
[1:56:48] look up some quotes or scriptures
[1:56:51] you could be well fortified
[1:56:54] but I think there's something that God's
[1:56:56] doing
[1:56:57] and the way that he's moving
[1:57:00] and the direction that he wants us to go
[1:57:05] in
[1:57:07] and it's always hid in such a simple way
[1:57:12] and it's on my heart and uh
[1:57:15] I would like to your prayer for me that
[1:57:20] I could bring it out through the message
[1:57:22] of the hour that you could see that
[1:57:24] that's exactly what our messenger
[1:57:28] said because then we can anchor in it
[1:57:31] and his brother Matthew said tonight
[1:57:33] we know if it's the word we know it'll
[1:57:36] come to pass
[1:57:37] so let's continue to have that faith
[1:57:41] we need faith
[1:57:45] faith by grace
[1:57:47] it's our victory
[1:57:49] and if we just keep that humble spirit
[1:57:52] that feeding on God's word
[1:57:56] that gentleness about us that peace
[1:58:00] about us and that total reliance
[1:58:04] on him to get us through all this
[1:58:07] we'll make it through don't you believe
[1:58:09] that I believe with all my heart don't
[1:58:11] give up on any prayer request that you
[1:58:14] have
[1:58:16] don't give up on anything that you're
[1:58:18] holding on to
[1:58:20] don't give up on yourself
[1:58:23] because he hasn't given up
[1:58:25] and we're going to make it Church
[1:58:28] amen
[1:58:29] like the young man said when he stood in
[1:58:33] front of the Lord
[1:58:35] he said Lord help my unbelief
[1:58:38] and that's what I trust tonight
[1:58:40] so just before we go that's once again
[1:58:43] if you have a request on your art
[1:58:46] if you have somebody
[1:58:49] on your heart
[1:58:51] I know brother Otis is back home now
[1:58:54] resting they gave him a bypass let's
[1:58:58] keep him in prayer
[1:58:59] I saw the most
[1:59:02] beautiful grandbaby
[1:59:05] here the other day sister Hannah had
[1:59:07] just want to keep Josh and Hannah in
[1:59:10] prayer they had a beautiful baby where
[1:59:13] she had her child Caesarean so we want
[1:59:16] to keep her in special prayer I really
[1:59:18] believe God's doing a great work there
[1:59:20] so I'm thankful so let's believe are all
[1:59:24] things possible
[1:59:25] all things are possible so let us pray
[1:59:28] go ahead lift your heart once again to
[1:59:30] the Lord

[2:01:56] given me a place that
[2:01:59] I can intercede on behalf of the people
[2:02:03] not because of Personality father or
[2:02:06] knowledge or ability but because the
[2:02:09] office that you created
[2:02:12] and father I would make intercession for
[2:02:16] our congregation
[2:02:18] Lord that we become more sensitive to
[2:02:21] your Holy Spirit
[2:02:24] that we
[2:02:26] when we come together
[2:02:29] we wait on your spirit
[2:02:34] father that we give ourselves over to
[2:02:37] your spirit
[2:02:39] and allow it to move freely
[2:02:43] in our midst
[2:02:46] doing exceedingly and abundantly above
[2:02:49] what we could ever even ask or think
[2:02:53] Lord I pray that you would
[2:02:57] allow all of us to have your preeminence
[2:03:01] in our lives
[2:03:04] father for without you
[2:03:07] we will surely fail
