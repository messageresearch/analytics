maybe to sing that key of f [Music] we certainly are such a blessed people to walk in the light that God has revealed in this last day [Music] but without Calvary without the cross it wouldn't do you any good but it's because of that price that he paid for our sins that we could be forgiven I'm reminded Paul said look let me let me know Jesus and him crucified I said that's what I want to know Lord I never want to be puffed up like I know it all if I can just identify with you at Calvary and that price that you pay that you're you're beaten Lord you were sweating you were one of our peace with this was my with the sacrifice than that life and that blood can come back upon the believer it doesn't make you know it all makes you humble and sincere and thankful to know God and the power of

Lord Our God it's our prayer to abide near The Cross because at the cross you got everything for us at the cross you got the victory for us at the cross you told us that it's all finished father through the cross we can realize that the enemy has nothing to claim because this world there's nothing to claim on us that all our thinking can only be turned towards you that's why tonight oh God we invite you on the scene that only you yourself can speak to us in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen It's a Long Point of View let's open a Tech arrivals I believe this morning we were blessed [Music] nuts it's the true word that attracts us to God [Music] it shows us that it's the God who knew us before the foundation of the world he elected us he already prepared everything for us so we can be what he wants us to be so we can get to where he wants us to get to is this morning I'm saying Brother David preached part of what I had to in mind to preach it was something that was in my heart for a while that I'm going to share with you tonight there are things that you know because that's the only thing that brings us together tonight I'll be speaking on the the end time message we'll take the scriptures that we know too well Malachi chapter 4 we will see uh verse one to six thank you remember behold the day cometh shall be shall burned as an oven and all the proud yea and all the wicked are all that do wickedly shall be shall be stubble and the day cometh shall burn them up and the Lord of hosts that shall shall it be will leave them neither Roots nor branches unto them that fear the name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in its wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of their stall and ye shall thread down the wicked for they shall be as ashes under the soul of your feet in the day that shall I shall do this thing saith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servants which are commended unto him in horrible for all Israel which with the statute and judgment behold I will send unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the Heart of the children through the father bless our commence might the Earth with the current we'll also take Luke 17 18. 3 Luke 17. we'll start with the 18th verse I don't think 18. this week then treat okay 28 to 30. it says likewise also itself it was in the day of lot they eat and they drink and they they bought and they sold and they planted and they built but the same day that Lord went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even that shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed we'll take it Revelation chapter 10 and verse 7. this outside so Revelation chapter 10 we'll just read seven he says but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets foreign after what we heard this morning as I was saying a while ago when we come to church every day when God gives us the strength to come to church it's because we have an objective it's because we have a goal is it's because God has certainly spoken to us because it's like this young Eagle like we heard this morning we heard a voice [Music] that we have recognized that we have recognized as the voice of Our Lord that's why that voice out of all the denominations that voice got out out of everything else that we were doing [Music] to bring us to attract us to something and that thing is the message on foreign and when we see all of those things come to pass we know we are at the end time Timothy chapter three the Bible is given as a description of what men will be at the end time it was said it will be uh ungrateful it will be unrighteous it will be a cruel it will be uh there will be enemies of those that do good they will love more pleasure than they will do God and that's what we see today when we go out in the street the the the heart is bleeding conditions when we see the condition of the world today when we see where Humanity has gotten to today but God sent us a message [Music] to take us out of that world to help us to be a a trampoline or somewhere someone that can take someone else out of it we're seen in the Bible that says what happened in the time of Noah will also happen again what happened in the time of Noah will also happen again in this end time when we go back in the Book of Genesis and we consider what happens in the time of Noah the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter 6. that it was a time where people were multiplying themselves on the first of the Earth the children were born that the sons of men begin to look and they were they being begin to be attracted to the daughters of the world and they took them as women the scripture says that the heart of men only turned towards the wrong and God repented for making having made a man and that's what we see today when we see the condition of humanity we realize what the grace of God is it says that said that for you behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet that the children were ten times uh more uh tempted with things than in that time than they than the race in this time what can we say about our children today that's why this message [Music] it has to help us to impact our children to be impacted ourselves to be outside of this world because the Temptation is great conditions the world is in the disgrace condition but God has given us his grace that God helped us to understand that this message is the unmerited grace of God that it's the the only way that God has brought forth so he can get us out of these things when the heart of man was continually evil in the time of Noah federal dollars even though the daughters of men became so beautiful to the point that they were only there to seduce the sons of God Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and I believe we're just of the great Temptation in our time that every one of us here tonight concerned us on the election his conscience of his election that God knew you before the foundation of the world you can say tonight that have found Grace in the eyes of God God show Noah the way by which he could escape the the flood that was coming we are in the same condition today and God has shown us the way by which we can escape when we read what happens in the time of lot when I was still a student in in in a medical field I was towards the end of my studies it's about 20 years ago in Psychiatry Lobo sexuality the the uh almost sexual homosexuality was written down as a disease as a psychiatrist the psychiatrist would call it a disease it was a a mental trouble that was written by the psychiatrist but today the devil is so much perverted everything but even preachers they don't get to where they can denounce those type of stuff because they're saying it's an homophobia um that because of that if God doesn't destroy this world he's obligated to raise up against Sodom and Gomorrah we are not against people in that condition we are not homophobians but we know it's an evil spirit that is in those people we condemn that spirit so you can bring those people to come to God foreign how can children be part of this but when we realize the condition of the world tonight even in the the kids the children primary schools they start to teach the children that you can have in the house your dad and your mom of the same sex okay what a destruction the Jew but God he provided away he provided a way foreign to help men come out of that condition God is given the same way was to escaping the time of the waters the way of Salvation tonight the way of Salvation in the end time it's the message of the end time when I was thinking about this message I was so comforted this morning when Brother David was reading this uh uh uh uh that God needs people that are going to condemn Hollywood tonight sometimes people get in easily but foreign sometimes people they they abide in there easily that's good because no one is calling it out because she's starting to teach that it's normal in society but what's normal in society and it's not in accordance with the word it doesn't matter to us what concerns us it's what is in accordance with the word and God in this same time of course they said the conditions because of the condition that we are seeing he says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet God described who this Elijah will be and we are all certain that we have met this Elijah the prophet no we can say to our neighbors come like Philip could tell Nathaniel here we have found him to him the prophet has talked about that's right in the Christian walk says we go through uh three stages justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and after those three sages it's God himself who comes and he abides in US Le Mondo see the world also it's also going through three stages the Bible tells us in uh First Peter chapter three First Peter chapter three uh first uh 18 to 21 okay it says for Christ had once suffered for sin has once Christ suffered for sin the just for the young for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by by the Spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prisons it says which sometimes were disobedient were once uh were once the long-suffering of God waited in the day of Noah while the ark was a preparing it says wherein wearing few that is eight Souls were saved by water it says like the figure where unto even the Baptist the baptism do also now save uh as not not to put away of the filth of the Flesh of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ here's the Bible showing us it was a symbolism of baptism it was a time where the world received its baptism the baptism of water it says it's an engagement of a good conscience of a person it's like we have heard the word when we have realized that the the way that we were taking was not the right way we repent it was the first preaching of Peter repent that your sins may be forgiven ESS the the Earth receive its baptism by water calls that the justification God made us in the condition of sin when the word is preached the people of Jesus when the scripture says in the book of Acts chapter 2. it strikes our heart new look on this circle conditions we recognize that our condition is not a good one when the word is and our hearts are broken send it back it doesn't mean that God wants us to remain in the condemnation Condition it's true that the word will condemn us the word will call out the things that we are doing it's not for us to remain under that condemnation but that we may repent that we may be sorry for what we have done it's not the question of just turning a page it's to repent sincerely that you may take the decision to change directions who has shown you that what you did is wrong he continues to show you here is what you can do that's right because the Gulf of God it's not to condemn you it's to attract you to himself that you can attract people by by the preaching of the word or by teaching but mostly that the Sinners are attracted by the preaching of the word that will break his heart and then he receives the teachings so he can be positioned that God knew him before the foundation of the world that God predestined to him predestined in him for the glory and the justification when God justifies you but when I'm says you repented you confessed your sins God takes the sins he puts it in the sea of God forgetfulness journeyman God himself who forgets it but you did those sins then when you present yourself before God when God is looking at you he says you have never sinned that sister did such and such to me even if I don't have a bad sentiment towards you like yes don't but that remains in my memory but when God has Justified you he forgives you and he forgets it that you had done it and that's when you come to him with all your heart when you repent sincerely when you decide to change directions he's faithful he won't condemn you regardless look when God came in the human flesh Jesus Christ they they they they brought to him a woman who was caught in adultery the law was clear you would you arrest once in such condition you're going to have to Stone her before God in the human flesh Jesus looked at the woman and he knew that the woman had done wrong just God knew that you done something wrong I may not know the pastor may not know it but you and God knows what's going on but God is Not condemning you when this woman I don't condemn you just go and sing no more and when Jesus it means he took the past of that woman he puts it in no sea of forgetfulness if you come back to Jesus and you say that before yesterday she was caught in adultery Jesus is looking she never done it but go and sin no more and when you receive this baptism you come by the sanctification the sanctification is the word of God that sanctifies you it's this message that sanctifies it's this message that shows you what your position what is God wanting out of you after too much how do does God want you to walk that you may be Holy Father says the sanctification it's to wash it means and to set aside for service when God washes you and they set you aside for service but it comes that God washes you come the Devil Comes the next day the Temptation is great and you give up but God doesn't want you to remain in that state sometimes the preacher May point exactly at what's happening in your condition when that happens to you be happy because God knows you and it's because he knows you that is interested in you that he's talking about you that is calling your attention so you can remain Sanctified because he has something that he wants to do with you it's when you are sanctified that you will realize that when you do something wrong your heart is broken you said oh Lord forgive me says that the just and in your heart you know you're a son of God that God knew you right before the foundation of the world that even if the enemy tries to block you on the way my heart tells me that this is not my place I Repent I go forward until God do baptist will baptize you and sail you with the Holy Ghost and that's what I'm says that when Paul preached to the Ephesians when Paul began to preach the predestination and he said it's not for Sinners it's not for unbelievers it's not for those that cannot believe this message is something but it's for those that are in Christ and it's those that are sure of the elections you to realize yet you're still on the other side that you're still a sinner Grace is still flowing when they talk to you about predestination don't just say it's me and then the next day your nature your life it just doesn't come to meet the world because we first have to reject the word it means the word will come first into our heart and then we forget that we are elected that we are sons of God we're going to behave like something like a contrary but God wants that we may be assured of who we are this is of what God has called us to be when I was thinking about justification something happened something came came to my heart my little sister to me for my sisters may forgive me foreign God shows that God has given to a woman a circuit virtue says that paragraph 76 if you could put it up you did a family it says a woman was not even in the beginning of the creation [Music] because God knew that she was gonna she would fall all other females could not commit adultery she's the only one that could commit adultery if she had been made like like the the original that would have been this com this this complementary to God's great wisdom she was made a byproduct of a man [Music] but because she was cast over in that side she has also received she also be given a sacred charge from God for Redemption she's got characters that she may she must not defile see if she would murder them she's defiled for for a lifetime no matter how much she's forgiven she can't be justified got a scripture on that in few minutes in a few minutes she can be forgiven for that defilement but she cannot be justified in this life it's always with her notice now she's been given this she may be forgiven but not justified it's to say that our young sisters that may God give you Grace to get you to keep the circuit virtue but we because we see that God forgives us of all things and he justifies us when it comes to this sacred charge that is given God will forgive you it has nothing to do with your salvation you are a daughter of God but God keeps studying your fire that God may help us with a current condition of the world that God may help us uh keep our young sisters our young sisters to walk in the fear of God the message of the end time God sent us a wonderful message that the messenger of the end time he has two things the first thing according to Malachi chapter four is to bring us right back into the faith of the Apostles [Music] to bring us right back into the worship of the Apostles [Music] to bring us right back into the preaching of the Apostles to bring us right back into the faith of the Apostles where we can have the home and if the full manifestation of our god of God where we can have the manifestations of God in our own lives and that gives us faith that we may receive all that we have need of yes end time messenger apocalypse according to uh Revelation 10 7 and was to take all the Hidden Mysteries and to reveal them to us the revealing of those Mysteries the revealing of that word will help us to get into the complete Plan of Redemption of God will help us to know [Music] that one day the gravity will not be able to hold us anymore and it's in the revealing of the word that says that is the rapturing faith in it that oh if the denomination they can take a part of the word they can have faith to move mountains God can give them that but when it comes to rapturing Faith they have to come into the complete revelation of the word and that's where the rapturing faith is because they sent a message has been sent to us it's for our transformation that one day do not records for me all our being may be transformed that we may go to the meeting of the Lord in the air that's why this message was sent to us and this message the evening messenger a paragraph 189. you didn't lose it says here we are in the end time red light down flashing coming of the Lord is at hand we miss you yes sir listen um the end time message should meet the end time conditions it says wait they've gotten off the message ought to bring them bring it right back always the end time message meets the end time conditions all the way throughout the Scriptures it will have to do with this time a call back to the original word like the other messenger did it in the day so massage this message will have to be the same we are promised for me we are promised God promised it in his word in malachite 4. they said it would happen a restored faith of the children back to the father promise it and we are living in that day oh it's been always each time a group of leaders that gets people are all mixed up it's not so much to people it's the leaders that get them mixed up now you say let's say now just a minute we got to make this scriptural see if it isn't scriptural then it's not good by the words of wisdom the Lord in the uninspired leadership words of worldly wisdom says it says in some of these great genius can set that together you'll see two yeah well approach uh did he not well approach Jesus and give him a reason and even quoted him the scripture to him he did it he's a genius Jesus never argued with him he said he led to see it's written also get behind me Satan we you know yes an uninspired leadership God has given us all the message but sometimes we take just a part of a part of the message oh just the side of the message and we hang on to it we treat the others on the other side oh they don't they don't have inspirations God wants us to abide it to remain in the message what is he said behold thou send you Elijah the prophet [Music] gave us all the advice of God [Music] that we may be assured that before the foundation of the world he knew us he predestinated us and this message is sended it's for you that if you were not here God was not going to send this message when we read the message like as we were in the office Brother David was telling us that he wants to be positive with this message that this message was sent for me God said something hard in this message in my regard I'll say Amen that may God say something that encourages me I'll say amen and I'll go forward and that's what this message is calling us to the flashlight denominations this message will not become a religious form at because God is working with us in individual manner each one of us knows what experience they have with God knows what expression he can express toward God system not a system I cannot tell birdability like look at how you should worship God that if you don't worship like me then you are on the side but according to the inspiration that he has foreign [Music] okay and when the Builder laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord they set the priest in the uh apparel with trumpets and with um with the levite the sons of ASAP with uh symbols to praise the Lord after the after after the ordinance of David the king of Israel and they sang together and they sang together by course in praise and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever towards Israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid it says but many of the priests and the Levites and the chief and the chiefs of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid Before Their Eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for Joy so that the people could not could not discern the noise of the of of the shout of Joy from the noise of the shout of the Weeping of the people for the people shouted with the war with a loud voice and the noise was a was it was heard afar off you will notice that when the foundation was laid there was two contracts uh contrasted reactions it was based on the experience that each one had the Bible says that the the ancient or the older people the cried they cried Legend the the whipped and they were young they were they were shouting for Joy no one told them that you all have to whip oh you all have to shout according to what God had done for them they had a reaction to it to Worship the Lord to glorify the Lord this message of the end time something precious that God help us as a musician will come to realize that Rapture is at hand the Bible tells us in first Thessalonians chapter 4. that are leaving who are alive until the coming of the Lord will be changed will all be changed but in order for us to be changed [Music] we have to stay with a message we have to keep the message we have to work with a message because it's the only thing that will bring us to that transformation and the Bible says it says Comfort yourself one another with these things if there's a word of consolation that we can pronounce tonight is to say my brother the Lord is coming Jesus is coming soon but you and I will be changed you and I will be changed we'll go to the meaning of the Lord that in Christ will resurrect first and all together we'll go together to the meeting of the through the meeting of the Lord in the air that's the word of consolation that this message is brought to us let's pray god of loveth yeah certainly this word were put together perhaps not well enough but you know what you have put in my heart this message that he may attract us even more conditions when I realized the condition of the world I pray oh God may you be merciful to us I commit to young people I know the Temptation is great because you said it through your prophet may you help them oh Lord I have to positive to be positive [Music] to know that you didn't bring them into this message for nothing it's because you you have known them since the foundation of the world it's because you elected them since the foundation of the world that you bring them into this message that you want to expose them to the son of this message that they may come to the maturity my prayer oh Lord like you pronounce it through Jesus and it said it's not for that I'll take you out of this world but it's to protect us from this world may be blessed Lord I commit Brother David into your hands the pastor that you have placed here oh Lord bless him for all that he does for the vision and the way that he's directing his people that it may always be a blessing thank you for this people merciful thank you for this message thank you for my brothers and my sisters Lord our beloved we know that you are God that you hold on to your promises that you hold to your word but this message or keeping the plastic sure I don't okay that it may have a place a first place in our heart help us that we may not go outside of it help us that we may look to it in everything that we are

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] can't you see here [Music] [Applause] oh that I've accepted [Music] [Music] my mind [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I am nothing [Music] amen you know the privilege of hearing this message is so wonderful I was sharing with the brothers this afternoon that some of the young men came over and they said let's look at this book the seed is not here with the shuck and we got to talking about the church natural and he said there's a church spiritual and there's a church natural I said now you think about all the other churches that are all around all they could do was look back [Music] at the writings of Peter and Paul and it recorded Epistles from Matthew Mark Luke and John and and all they did is they they looked back and they read them and each man came up with his own idea each person came up with his own conclusion and then they took it and they they built a way of worship upon it and then somebody went and they took something else and something else but they were always looking back and that's why it became a carnal Church because it was all built on the things that man read because there was no allotted word all they had was the word that was allotted then and they did the best they could with it they they built denominations and interpretations all with pure hearts but God elected to a lot in the word for this day a new word a fresh word a Living Word that would take all the Mysteries and all the things that were written all the things that were misunderstood and bring them to an elect people an allotted word the prophet of God said you know why there was no Prophet from the time of of Malachi to the time of John he said because there was no allotted word you know why there was no Prophet from the time of Jesus to this time because there was no allotted word but now God had a fresh allotted word to give to an elected chosen people and he brought it in the form of a message because the word can only come to a prophet you've received fresh man that's what this message is is the allotted word for our time and that's why our brothers saying you've got to stay with it you've got to understand this is a different people this is a different Covenant this is a different time you are not living under the Covenant of the church ages you're living under the Covenant of predestination and election all what a message brother praise the Lord I appreciate it stay with the message amen that's why he throws that book buries it I like what the prophet said right at the end of the tape he said don't dig it up foreign you've been called to follow this message leave those things which are behind behind and press for the higher calling amen forget the mistakes leave yesterday yesterday's over you got fresh food amen if you're being starved out all your life you're just skinny you haven't eaten for months amen you don't go in and sit at the table and start talking about all you didn't have but you dig in
