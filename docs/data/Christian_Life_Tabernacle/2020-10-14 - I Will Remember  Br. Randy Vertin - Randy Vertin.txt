Description:
I Will Remember
Br. Randy Vertin
Wednesday Evening Service: October 14,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

many of you heard from your theophany amen amen we're on that next turn in the road yes sir amen we're just coming further and further into that revelation of who we are and just exactly what the lord's already done for us amen if we we're not going to hold you along this evening i just have a short thought you never know where the lord's going to go but it seems like a short thought at least on the surface but we're just really inspired by everything that's been ministered lately and we're going to turn to psalm 77 just grateful for all those that have pressed their way out to the house of the lord in the middle of the week certainly uh the lord jesus is a shelter in the storm amen our refuge and he's our strong rock and the place where we have our foundation and that revelation that he's given unto us in this hour and we're gonna just do a little bit of reading we're gonna read this whole chapter and then we're gonna turn to second peter chapter one it says i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted i remembered god and was troubled i complained and my spirit was overwhelmed salah thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot speak i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times i called to remembrance my song in the night i commune with my own my own heart and my spirit made diligent search will the lord cast off forever and will he be favorable no more is his mercy clean gone forever doth his promise fail forevermore hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he and anger shut up his tender mercies salah and i said this isn't my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high i remem remember the works of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god is our god thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the people thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph salah the water saw thee oh god the waters saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubled the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound then arrows also went abroad the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known thou let us thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron and let's just turn to second peter chapter 1 and we're just going to read verses 8 through 15. wait for the pages to stop turning verse 8 says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so in entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath showed me moreover i will endeavor that you may be able after my deceased to have these things always in remembrance amen let's just bow our heads in the word of prayer heavenly father we just ask right now oh god that you would just get me out of the way lord let your perfect will be done this evening lord jesus we just come here to worship you and to hear from your word oh god i just pray that lord you would have preeminence in the service lord have preeminence in in the speaker lord pyramids and the the ones that would hear o god and we just ask that you're perfect we'll be done now we just love you lord and ask you bless the reading of your word in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated so my my thought for this evening i guess just really simply would be i will remember and i guess just being inspired of hearing the sermons this last weekend and kind of going on what we maybe spoke on last time about the different channels that we're trying to to open up unto the lord jesus it seems like in this day one of the biggest things that we deal with is memories you know it as technology has gotten greater and greater it's amazing how the world is so quick to bring up the past about every little thing you know i we're in that political season now and have been for a while and it's amazing how the you know one both you know one side or the other they always do it they someone says something and then what they'll dig back in their twitter history or their facebook posts or what it is and try to find what did you do in the past and now that it's all catalog they can go back and find all these different things and always try to throw it in the face of an individual and say oh you said this or oh i gotcha you know there's always that they call it the gotcha moment that they're trying to get on each other and i feel like that's that's just really just a natural example of what we're really seeing in our lives in this day of what the devil tries to do to the children of god you see the devil we know he's the accuser of the brethren his job as it were was to present himself before the lord and to accuse you and i the the the children of god of unbelief of sin of of these problems that we find in our lives i i so thank the lord we have a real revelation that it was never us in the first place that did it but nevertheless we find that it's the struggle that we all face every single day that we have to wake up every single day with a reminder of the life of sin that has followed us from the time we were born this flesh that we're attached to in this natural body is a daily reminder of the life that we once lived of the the lusts that we once had because sin was condemned in the flesh and as we've been talking about so many times and how that that sin nature trying to express itself and god's nature through the holy ghost trying to express itself through you so we find that one of the greatest things as we heard our pastor minister on this this weekend in the services was on that amnesia that strikes the people and amnesia we understand it's a forgetting of who you are it's it's it's a lack of understanding of who you are what your identification is and and even though we've come to a place even here now this evening on a wednesday night to see the people of god gathering to hear the word of god there's there's a measure of grace that god has given us to overcome that amnesia to recognize i'm a child of god i'm a member of the bride of jesus christ my desire is to the word of god i desire the things of god so i'm going to go to where the things of god are being ministered by the grace of the lord and here we are but every day we struggle with those the the memories in the in the past things that try to creep up and the devil always trying to remind us of those things in our past our our our shortcomings and our failures and so many times even though we don't even know it we fall victim to to succumbing to those ideas because we don't live freely in jesus christ the way we ought to there's so many times such a a measure of guilt that the devil tries to put on the people because we understand the the brother branham told us that if the people of god could get a true revelation of the true church and who she is and the spirits working in the framework of the church should be an invincible army and we have the word of god for the hour that would bring that revelation and i believe even now that revelation is inside each and every one of the children of god the bride of jesus christ and yet it seems such that there's like maybe just a little hindrance there remember we talked the devil can't stop the work of god but his desire is to hinder it as much as he can and just and just to buffet you and to try to hold you back from becoming what the lord has desired for you and one of the greatest ways he does that is with your memories see he loves the devil loves to take away the knowledge of who you are in jesus christ and replace it with a a remembrance of things of god days gone by every day you wake up like i said there's a there's a there's a reminder a flesh that you dwell in that is a reminder to yourself that that you're dying that that if the lord tarries we're we're not long for this world right if the lord were to tarry you get older and the body the physical nature breaks down you know you live by dead substance now but as we've heard the prophet explain it how was it that when i was younger i would eat the same foods drink the same water and i would get stronger and stronger and then i find them now i'm getting weaker and weaker and we understand it this day it's even worse because now we got the hybrid food and we got the all the the atmosphere around us that's just killing the flesh even more just uh just a natural typing the spiritual of the atmosphere that the the devil and the food that satan has fed the people the perversion hybrid word and yet there's something in the believer that knows that there's more beyond what we're seeing right now that there that there is an overcoming power within you that is destined and designed and in fact placed in you by god to overcome this world greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world placed in you designed specifically for overcoming power but what is it we're people we're children we're people of flesh i was born in sin i was shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies and so many times that amnesia that we heard about this last weekend strikes us when we least expect it and it may not be in the big waves that you can see right away but over time it's it's like it's an overcoming force just trying to chip away and chip away and chip away and many times it's only because we fail to remember and keep before our eyes always the works of the lord it's very easy to become short-sighted in this hour and only look at the present circumstances everything before you is is in the natural is just crying out that of death and destruction and and chaos and tumult and yet there's something in you that knows that that there's peace and safety in the word of god we read in psalm 77 just the the you can almost feel i feel like you can really feel the the anguish that the man of god is going through writing this says in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my soul ran in the night and cease not my soul refused to be comforted how many of you ever felt like that how many of you ever felt just such a grieve a grieving in your in your spirit in your soul and it's just it's like a pressing you know it's gross darkness in the world in this hour there's a pressing darkness that is that is trying to overcome the believer thank the lord that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard but many times what what is it it's that that amnesia sensation of you you don't even know because the man with amnesia doesn't even know that they have amnesia they've forgotten who they were they forgotten where they came from they've forgotten the the authority if i could say like that that they have and that's what the devil now see we've come to a place we've come too far for the devil to get us on on so many things that would seem obvious to us now all the you know these the adulteries and and the living in what we call obvious sin and all these things it it's it's those are just scarecrows to us now we see we see those things are far off but it's the little fox is spoiling the vine it's the little things that are creeping in that just even though you don't know it steal away your enemy steal away the memories of what the lord has been showing you what he's been restoring into your life and revealing to you and the only way that you can get it back is by the word of god the only way that you can be restored in this place is by a remembrance of the things of the word of god like peter said he's talking how many times in those scriptures he says i'm gonna stir i'm gonna bring you back by way of remembrance he said though you know these things i'm gonna bring you back by way of remembrance i'm gonna i'm gonna keep you always in remembrance of these things so that even after i leave you'll have these things always in your remembrance we've even had a prophet in this day who stored up food why so that we could have these things always in our remembrance so we've got these storehouses we've got the word of god we've got we've got the the word of a prophet that has revealed the word of god in this hour and what is it to do it's to stir us up in remembrance you know somebody i think we we ought to i think we really one of our things is we ought to be testifying more and i don't even just mean testifying to the to the world and although we should be doing that but we ought to be testifying one to another we are we ought to be remembering the things of god in our life we ought to be restoring these memories of the things even like david said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation i want to i want to bring into remembrance the things that god has done for me you see it's not it's not that we live by that painted fire it's not that we live in a time gone by but so many times when the devil tries to get us down when he tries to bury you under all the things and all the iniquities that no doubt we struggle with sometimes and it seems so great and the things that we know because we know better we know better we've got we've got the word in our hearts we've got the holy ghost there to prick your heart and then the devil well you know the devil said oh you can't pray for that person because of this and this this this what is he doing he's trying to put amnesia upon you trying to make you forget as peter told us that you were purged from these sins trying to make you forget the power of the atonement and that's what really it comes down to is he tries to make us forget the power of the blood of jesus christ because the blood of jesus christ will cleanse you from all of that and it it'll it'll wash your mind with pure water of the word it'll bring you to a place where there's now no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus who don't live according to the flesh anymore but the devil is always there to accuse and it's around every corner he's there to bring up things in your past he's there to bring up things that other people have done he's there to bring up things that you had done he's there to remind you oh you had this trouble and you had that trouble and you did this and you did that and all the while trying to replace you know there's a reason if you go back into the old testament how after they even crossed the river jordan he said erect i want you to erect these stones why it's a memorial of the things that god has done in this place how they would build an altar and sacrifice and they were called upon the name of the lord why it was a memorial to the people of what god had done and each one of us is a memorial unto god of what he's done how many of you can testify god took me out of the mary clay i was maybe you weren't even searching for god but yet he took you out [Applause] and how many times does the devil try to make us forget and give us amnesia about that oh you can't make a rapture like devil you tell me i can't make a rapture i never even thought about a rapture until god called me and gave me a promise that i would make a rapture [Applause] so how can the devil take away a promise that he didn't even give me he can't do it but what if the devil tree tries to twist he tries to turn it he tries to flip the script and put the onus on you to make it as though you're going to accomplish something in yourself no it's going to be to the glory of the lord jesus christ and him alone there's no man going to get glory out of this thing when you when you say farewell to this world and that body change happens in the moment in the twinkling of an eye there ain't nobody going to be around saying well praise god praise the lord i did it no sir it's going to be thank you lord jesus your promises are yeah and amen [Applause] hallelujah every one of us is struggling with different things why because this christian life is a battle and it doesn't stop it's a day you weren't even fighting till you came to the knowledge of this message you weren't even fighting till the holy ghost came into your life and that's when you became an enemy to the devil because at that moment when the holy ghost sealed you in that's when you chose signs actually it showed what side you chose before the foundation of the where it just you finally started to take your position and now the devil knows oh that's one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them but he tries to make you forget he tries to make you forget see there's nothing wrong necessarily with remembering where you came from why because that that can be a driving force to the believer i remember the time when i was in such depression i just wanted to i didn't want to talk to nobody i just if i had the courage i would have killed myself but i had too much knowledge of the truth to kill myself i was too scared to do that so i just shut myself up and just didn't want to talk to anybody for like three and a half four years just depressed just didn't care about nothing and then god came along my path and just like a like a father spanking a child said wake up it wasn't anything i did because i didn't even care about god anymore at that point there was something in me that still did don't get me wrong there was a seed still there but in my mind i had already written myself off but thank the lord jesus he didn't write me off and i'm here to tell you that you're part of this pride of jesus christ don't write yourself off because in this hour you're standing for the truth right now i just want to encourage you tonight because this is such an hour look at the look at the world around you everybody accusing everybody else of something everybody but why because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold and if we're not careful that starts to creep into the body of christ why could you rub his shoulders with the world a little too much we we see why because we have knowledge of this word we see when things aren't necessarily right and if we're not careful if the charity is not there charity covereth the sins charity will pray for the brother or sister but if we're not careful because iniquity is shallow bound the love of many shall acts cold and what happens the devil starts to make us forget that you were once in that situation that's you or what's purged from your old sins but thank to the lord jesus his blood covers it all his blood was enough the blood of jesus christ was enough and that's what i'm resting in is i'm resting in the blood of the lord jesus christ i'm resting in the atonement of calvary it's so easy to get caught up in our own shortcomings with much knowledge comes a lot of much sorrow and we got to know we have so much knowledge spirit good knowledge spiritual knowledge worldly knowledge but when we're not careful what does it do he starts to turn it into a law and as soon as that happens you start condemning yourself and as soon as that happens you've lost what the blood came here to do which was to free you from the law of sin and death and make you alive unto the unto god by the blood of jesus christ but the devil is out there throwing guilt around like candy make you feel guilty for this and feel guilty for that if you'll get you know what that there's nothing wrong with with uh with a conviction but it but the devil will steal away faith in that blood to cover that sin that's why you see people that just can't get over something in their past they just they're stuck on it because there's something there's somewhere the devil has lied to them that the blood will work for everything except that that they just we use the term forgive ourselves well we didn't forgive ourselves to begin with but we have to have enough faith to allow god to forgive us we've heard the story a pardon is not a pardon except that we received as a pardon if that be the case then lord just let me let me rest in your grace let me rest in his mercy you can look all through the scriptures and see there are so many people in the scriptures that had reason to count themselves out that could have just sat there and dwelt on all the failures we're not going to be long but i'm just going to go through a few of these think about think about this adam and eve think about the guilt that the devil could have held over their heads eve knowing that what she did caused the entire fall of humanity adam knowing willingly now he did it willingly but knowing that he caused it for himself could you imagine the conversations the great-great-grandchildren had with adam and eve oh it was like this before in the garden yeah but grandma eve what happened and then she'd have to tell them what happened what how we fell how we disobeyed the word of god how i allowed how i allowed the serpent to beguile me and tricked me into something think about that think about moses all the memories of his own mistakes that he had to have he grew up with the knowledge being a proper child a deliverer raised with that knowledge in the house of pharaoh and yet all he had to show for it was a dead egyptian and running away from his commission out in the wilderness for 40 years from from a man who who would wage war for pharaoh and consider one of the greatest of the kingdom if not the greatest next to pharaoh to a man just hurting some sheep on the back side of the desert with a with a bounty on his head one one day he had thought i'm gonna be the deliverer sure of his calling but he didn't wait upon his ministry he didn't do it the way god had called him to do it and he fell flat on his face could you imagine the guilt and the shame knowing that i thought i thought i was going to be this great one i thought i was called to this purpose i was raised to know he could look back and hear the testimonies of his mother about the the in the in the reed bushes and how he was found as a babe and and raised up in the house of pharaoh even though he was even though he was a hebrew the miracles that happened around his life and yet he'd look and say but where am i how many of you ever felt like that think about joseph and all the trials he had to go through a prophet he knows his dreams are are true he sees these things favored living a good life and yet now he's sold into slavery oh it seems like things are on the upswing we're going good we're raised up into potiphar's house now and then chop down again what you and you know how the devil does even though he didn't do anything wrong you know the devil's right there and accuse him oh they were you did something you're a pride he you know he probably heard is the words of his his brothers you're just a prideful lifted up with all your dreams and stuff those are the kind of complexes the devil tries to put on us oh you're just you're just prideful you think you're something special because god called you his bride i can't i could imagine you know the roller coaster of emotions he would have had to have felt favored of his father coat of many colors down into a pit into it into a prison then raged up into potiphar's house and then cast back into prison and then rage back come up to the right hand of pharaoh think about david and his transgressions and his problems that he had called of god had the miracles that followed him with the slaying of goliath the slang of the lion the slaying of the bear these different things that happened the mighty works that he did and then he falls with bathsheba killed uriah and now he now he's being called out by his own prophet nathan he says you're the man the guilt that he had psalm 51 he talks about he says my sin was ever before my my face no doubt after god had called him he said i called you from the sheepfold i let i raised you up and you did this thing isn't that the devil what he does to us when we make our mistakes we've been called to this great calling and then we make a mistake and the devil's right there see one thing the devil's faithful at is to be of the accuser he'll he'll he'll let i remember i remember talking to brother david one time brother david junior and we were talking about how the lord will do things for you and it and you've been praying for something and the lord will even do a miracle yeah and as soon as the miracle's done the devil fought you the whole time there's no way god can do it there's no way god could do it and god does it and then as soon as it happens he flips right around and god didn't actually do that you didn't even see that that wasn't even real he's faithful as an accuser and he's faithful as a liar because he's the father of it you can trust that he's lying think about peter's failures i mean zealous for the lord no doubt but how many mistakes did he make it's cutting ears off lord lord jesus has to put it back on how many how many of us could have stood up to the lord jesus to our faith saying get thee behind me satan thou savor it's not the things that be of god i mean i know i know i'm a child of god so i would have gotten through it but that would have been rough and and i don't say that as a joke but if could you really put yourself in those shoes how he said lord you know i love you i'll i'll go wherever you go i'll die where you die says you'll betray me three times and then he does it and he knows he did it the shame that he had to feel do you you how much did he have to press to go to pentecost knowing that not only now i'm gonna you i mean i'm just tell i'm just being honest look at the way things are you don't think there are whispers going around amongst different disciples you know peter betrayed peter betrayed jesus ran away you know i heard him like i heard right before that jesus called him satan no revelation of what was really happening but that's how that's how the devil does it you could all testify that that's the truth but imagine the pressing that he had to do to go to just to go to pentecost oh my goodness think about paul and his persecution of the church raised up knew where he stood according to what he knew at the time according to the law dragging those in to be persecuted and then standing there at the stoning of stephen just yeah that's exactly what we need to do is stone that man imagine the guilt imagine and how many of us have been in those situations struggling with problems struggling with issues in your life it they may even be minor but see that that's that's what i love about the people of god is even the minor things to the people of god are important because when when a person's really been filled with the holy ghost every word of god matters every desire of jesus christ matters to the believer every jot and tittle means something to the believer not just like the denominational world that'll go out there and say well i'll accept this half of the word but i can get away with all the rest of it it doesn't matter about holiness that doesn't mean god doesn't care when the word says he does see but the people of god and the devil uses that against the people of god because we care and we desire perfection brother branham said it he said he said there's something in a believer that always desired perfection you can go look up that quote there's something in you that when you came to a knowledge of god of jesus christ and what he did for you and who you were that your desire in your heart is lord i want to live i want to live what you told abraham walk before me and be thou perfect that's the desire of the believer and the devil that trickster slicker that he is is right there to turn it around against you because we make mistakes because we fail abraham no doubt he had to look at it he even asked the lord he said lord you made me this promise but what about my child i still haven't had a child and one board of my house is eliezers gonna take it all he looked at ishmael said i tried that's what i got was a wild man how the devil would would attack the people of god yes sir that's the life that we're living that's the life that's the amnesia that the devil is trying to pull over your eyes the wool he's trying to put over your eyes is to make you forget but i could go through all these ones and i could just i can just imagine adam and eve telling that story to their great great grandchildren yeah grandma eve she messed it up but you know what god i will remember that god made a promise to us in that garden that my seed would step on the head of that serpent and then you know what he did he made us coats of skins and no doubt that revelation stirred up in him and said that there is coming a deliverer there's coming a savior that's going to bring us back to what we lost yes this is my infirmity but i will remember the days of the right arm of the most high what about moses walking back with that stick in his hand after the burning bush and the devil's right that you you know that dead egyptians here you know that bounty's still on your head they ain't forgot about it you know you failed it's 40 years too late moses he says yeah you know what i did mess up but i will remember i will remember what my mom taught me when i was younger yeah i may have messed it up i tried to fulfill it by my own desires but my own thoughts i tried to make it happen but there's a burning bush experience that i've had i will remember the voice that spoke to me out of the bush and said i am that i am i have heard the cries of my people and i have come down and i sent you joseph when no doubt he's in those trials thinking about what have i done to deserve this what have i done what did i do i i i just tried you know but there's something in him that said i will remember i will remember the dream that i was given that i was raised up for a purpose that might that my parents and my my brothers will come down and bow down to me one day and he had a revelation of it at the end god did this to preserve life god did this for a purpose the devil can't get anything over on a true believer because they can go back and say yes this is my infirmity these are my problems you could be honest with yourself but we got to get back to the word and say you know what devil that's right i got this problem i got financial issues i got health issues i got family issues i got all these problems the rapture looks a million miles off but i will remember the promise that god gave me when he sealed me with the holy ghost and he gave me a revelation of who he was that's the memorial that god has raised in your heart when he put that seal there and he put that memorial in your heart don't let the devil make you forget it don't let the devil draw you away from it what about david he says nathan says you're the man. psalm 51. i'll just read it real quick it's not a long one says have mercy upon me oh god according to that loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly for mine iniquities and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee the only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest and be clear without judges behold i was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirous truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities created me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit in me how many of you felt like that say lord sometimes i just need i need i need to renewal of that spirit in me amen i know that i'm in need of that all the time lord renew a right spirit of me bring me closer into your presence bring me more in love with you renew a right spirit in me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me he said he'd never leave you nor forsake you restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit amen no doubt david going through all these trials he had been cast out even by his son absalom had to had to reap what he sowed had to go through some struggles and some trials but no doubt he could come back and say this is these are my problems this is my infirmity is psalm 77 says it says verse 10 and psalm 77 and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high you know who the right hand is right that's jesus christ that's gene i will remember the years of jesus christ i will remember what jesus christ has done for me no doubt david could go back into maybe some of the psalms he had written and said i will remember that thy mercy endureth forever i will remember that though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i won't fear any evil i will remember how you delivered me out of the hand of the lion how you delivered me out of the hand of the bear and out of the hand of goliath and out of the hand of saul and all of these things and he could go forth with confidence what about peter peter could go out and say yeah these this is what i done i did all these things it's true i denied him he rebuked me to my face all these things happened no doubt but i could remember when he told me that day you're simon son of jonas i can remember when he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock i shall build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it i could remember when he said when thou art converted strengthen your brethren and he could press to the day of pentecost and then he could come back and second peter and tell you even though you know these things i'm gonna keep you always in remembrance of them i'm going to renew your minds i'm going to stir up your minds my way of remembrance i'm not going to let the devil put that veil over your eyes to make you forget what he's done for you and then paul paul could just even you could even read in the scriptures how he never quite forgot he didn't let it stop him but he didn't forget he said i'm the least of the apostles that persecuted the church he let it drive him he let it be something behind him that said lord i know what i was and i know what you made me amen and i thank you lord jesus because you took me from that i'm never stopping i press towards the mark of the high colony i'm going to keep going no doubt he can say yeah i persecuted the church i was there at the stoning of stephen but i was also there on the road to damascus when he cried out from the light and say paul paul so so why persecute us thou me i was there when i was prayed over and the scales fell from my eyes and i received the holy ghost that you've also received and the blood of jesus christ was so powerful that the brethren in jerusalem just reached out their hands and gave him and barnabas the right hands of fellowship and say you're just one of us too that's what the blood of jesus christ will do think it just says well we'll just close here in a minute and then i think about samson i'll just go back to that because he's such a powerful character think about grinding in the mill thinking about the failures that he done i delivered i delivered israel i put the gates of the gates of the enemy on my back and carried them up the mountain i i with the jawbone of a a mew-i'd slain a thousand philistines and now here i'm grinding in the middle and the devil's right there yeah you're a complete failure you're just going around in circles now we've all been there at some points no doubt just like israel around that mountain around that mountain around that mountain but there's a time that came for samson brother braham said he could feel those locks growing back there was a reminder of the covenant that he had we've had a reminder in this day we've had a reminder in this day of the covenant that we have amen from the foundation of the world a covenant that an unbreakable covenant that was given unto the bride of jesus christ he knows them that are his and samson can say yes this is my infirmity i can't see i i don't i don't have maybe the abilities that i thought i had before but i'll remember the covenant that god gave to me i can remember my mom my mother and father telling me of the covenant that was made i can remember the the victories that were won and just like we all need to do we need to be like samson and say hey if i have to die with my enemies we got to die if you want to get that victory you got to die your desires have to die your will has to die and sampson said you know what let me die with my enemy and he slew more in his death than he did in his life and so is it with the children of god you'll slay more once you're dead to yourself you will do more for god when you're finally dead to yourself than you ever could have done on your own strength just in an instant too it just took an instant just one push now i want you to think brother branham tells the story just as we close here of the the one with amnesia and how he got off got off the the train and just started walking around and what does he see he sees just this path that just seems kind of familiar can't put your finger on it but there's something that i know this that's what the believer is if you found yourself in a place where you just don't seem to know that you know or maybe the devil's tried to put a little blackness on there to try to give you some amnesia you know what you got to do because where was the where was that boy coming off the train where he was going he was home we got to go home we got to go back to the word when you find yourself in that amnesia just go back to the word go back into prayer go back into the word go back to your home and you'll find that all of a sudden it'll start to feel real familiar to you he said wow that was that's me i i i've had those struggles and god delivered me just like you delivered them and pretty soon you're going to find yourself walking see that water tower oh i remember that and you just keep going and going and before you know it there's your heavenly father right at the end of the line saying i knew you were coming back i knew you were there i saw that's why we just sang that song at the beginning it said around that next turn in the road i see king jesus and that's just what that boy did he walked around that next turn he saw that house and saw his father on the stoop and his father was just waiting for him he said around that next turn of the road i see king jesus coming for me i know i knew you were coming back and that's what the lord that's all the lord's doing right now he just come back to the word just come back and keep pressing into it and the scales will fall off see there's no problem with admitting the infirmity but go to the end of it say i will remember as we'd all stand i will remember my lord jesus christ and what he did for me you know the devil he's got us so he's got a so he's so good at preaching to us about our past i think it's time that the children of god started preaching to him about his future about where he is right now even he's under your feet you got to preach to that devil preach them the word say i will remember thus saith the lord i will never leave you nor forsake you i am the god that healeth all thy diseases amen let's just power hands in the word of prayer lord jesus we just love you so much oh god we just thank you for your love and your mercy lord your lord your mercies and earth forever oh god lord in your word said you were faithful and just lord if we would confess our sins you're faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness lord lord in so many times the devil is just right there to try to show us all of our mistakes and our shortcomings lord but your word said though a righteous man falls seven times he gets up lord and we're just gonna press forward lord in your promises lord we're not gonna look at ourselves lord but we're gonna look towards the promise oh god just as our our father abraham did lord just as the different ones that we even spoke about this evening oh god that that surely they could see their own faults and failures but lord they were looking to a promise lord we're looking to your promises right now god may you just draw us closer into your presence oh lord may you just if they're lord i believe that lord even now we've come here lord you've already lifted the amnesia off of us oh god but if there be any fog left over if there be any any missed lord that would try to come and try to try to block out the light of this gospel to us oh god may you just lord by your power just lift it lord maybe just take away all the blinders all the doubts and frustrations that the world tries to keep on us lord and may we just rest in your promises right now oh god we thank you lord for your love and your mercy we thank you for the promises lord because they're yea and amen lord and we accept them right now lord jesus and we're trusting in that atonement in your blood lord we're trusting in that lord we thank you for the word that you've given to us in this hour lord we're resting upon that lord and we're just pressing forward in it we thank you lord now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and i just have brother billy come and i'm never really good at coming up with a song right off the bat when i at the end of service but [Music] what does that brother billy come and you know the devil's so quick to remind you of your failures you just turn right around and remind them of god's promises because because the devil can't take that away from the believer that's given that's the children's bread that's only for that's only for for you the devil can't partake of those things if he if he could then he'd be your brother but he can't i hope brother come god bless you all you know that's that's a weapon to always have the word in our mind amen to constantly think on those things which which that which is done what it's we just promised the things of god you know branham talks about how mary they were thinking on those things they put those things back in their memory that's how they get back to
