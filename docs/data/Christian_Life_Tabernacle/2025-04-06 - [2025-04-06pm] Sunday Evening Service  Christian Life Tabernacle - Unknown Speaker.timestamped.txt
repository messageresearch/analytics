[8:21] we're so grateful. Lord, we're praying
[8:24] that your presence would come down this
[8:26] evening in a mighty powerful way, Lord,
[8:28] and just touch each heart, Lord, if
[8:31] there be any needs or anything that
[8:33] anyone would be battling, Lord, that you
[8:37] would help them overcome that or that
[8:39] that need would be met, Lord. Lord,
[8:42] we're so grateful, Lord, to be in your
[8:44] presence, Lord, each day, Lord, and to
[8:46] have the opportunity to know you and
[8:49] walk with you every day, Lord. It's such
[8:51] a pleasure, Lord, and an honor. Lord, we
[8:54] pray your blessings upon the service and
[8:56] upon each one who's made their way to
[8:59] your house today, Lord. Lord, may we
[9:01] receive what you've placed upon the
[9:05] heart of the minister, Lord. And may you

[26:39] of. I wanted to praise him for his
[26:42] faithfulness." Amen. That's our God.
[26:50] You know, it's always sometimes he
[26:52] answers in 24 hours, sometimes 25 years,
[26:56] but he always answers. Hallelujah.
[26:59] Brother Tommy writes, "Please pray for
[27:01] his wife, Sister Liz. She had her tooth
[27:03] removed and she's in some
[27:05] pain. Appreciate seeing you here. We
[27:09] know what you're going through. If
[27:10] you've ever had teeth pain, you you
[27:13] understand it's a different world. So I
[27:17] my prayers go out to you. We ask brother
[27:20] Benji to come and pray for these and the
[27:22] brothers come take tithes and offerings
[27:25] and we want to remember the
[27:26] announcements that we made this morning
[27:28] with the 39 and under banquet that's
[27:31] coming in habiting this Friday. We want
[27:34] you to make sure that you're all signed
[27:35] up and then for our
[27:38] pavilion dedication that we're doing on
[27:40] Sunday.
[27:48] Let's pray. Almighty God, we thank you
[27:51] once more, Lord, for having brought us
[27:53] back into your house this evening, Lord.
[27:57] Lord, we have heard the testimony, Lord,
[27:59] that you are the God that answers
[28:00] prayer, Lord. Lord, we thank you for
[28:02] that once more, Lord. We do not want to
[28:04] forget, Lord, to give time to set time
[28:07] aside to just thank thank you, Lord.
[28:10] Lord, if there's one thing that we
[28:11] should do more, Lord, is to thank you,
[28:12] Lord, for everything that you do for us,
[28:14] Lord, that you do for us, Lord, even
[28:16] that we do not know, Lord, each day as
[28:18] the day goes by, as the years goes by,
[28:20] Lord, you have done so much for us,
[28:22] Lord, that we do not know, Lord. And we
[28:24] know there's one thing, Lord, even as we
[28:26] walk through this path, Lord, as our
[28:28] pastor has been laying down, laboring
[28:30] down,
[28:31] Lord, preaching us to about the path.
[28:33] What is the path forward, Lord, for us,
[28:35] Lord? And we know as as human being Lord
[28:37] sometimes Lord we like to get ahead of
[28:39] our guide Lord and to not listen to that
[28:41] guide Lord instead of paying attention
[28:43] and keeping us as our prophet told us to
[28:46] look look up to Christ Lord but we we
[28:48] try to look to what you mean does Lord
[28:51] we try to put ourself ahead of you Lord
[28:53] we ask for forgiveness Lord we ask Lord
[28:56] that you may grant us your may grace
[28:59] find us Lord where we at Lord if there
[29:01] is anybody that's Lord that needs
[29:04] answers Lord to the questions Lord, I
[29:06] believe that this morning, Lord, through
[29:08] the preaching of the word, Lord, that we
[29:10] may have received those answers, Lord.
[29:12] And tonight, Lord, we are back here,
[29:13] Lord, once more, Lord. We know that you
[29:15] have more for us in store for us, Lord.
[29:17] I pray for all the uplift of hand, Lord.
[29:19] You know the heart desire of each and
[29:22] everybody here, Lord. People are here,
[29:24] Lord. We have desires, Lord. But we
[29:27] know, Lord, these desires are not here
[29:29] to to not be without an answer, Lord,
[29:31] because you are the God that answers,
[29:32] Lord. You are the God that's there,
[29:34] Lord. You you are the great Lord. You
[29:37] knew exactly what each of each each and
[29:39] everyone here goes through Lord cuz
[29:40] you've gone through it yourself Lord.
[29:42] You came here as as a human Lord in
[29:44] human flesh to suffer like us Lord. So
[29:46] you may know that you may say Lord I
[29:48] know the pain that you are going through
[29:49] my son Lord. I know the pain that you
[29:51] are going through my daughter Lord. So
[29:54] come to me Lord with your burden Lord
[29:55] and I'll give you rest cuz I know what
[29:57] you're going through and I know what it
[29:59] is that you need Lord that that you need
[30:02] and that's the word of God Lord. So we
[30:03] pray that Lord that you may give us the
[30:05] word Lord that we may walk Lord in the
[30:08] word of God in this path this path is
[30:10] not easy Lord but we know if we are with
[30:12] you Lord who can stand against us Lord
[30:15] so Lord as we're turning our hearts at
[30:17] this moment Lord as we're turning our
[30:19] this service around to Lord preparing
[30:22] for the world to come forward Lord bless
[30:24] our brother Matthew Lord as as he's
[30:26] preparing to come here with the word of
[30:27] God may you may you anoint his lip to
[30:30] speak only what the desire of each and
[30:32] everyone here has in their heart that
[30:34] when we walk out these doors, we do not
[30:35] walk out the same, but we walk out of
[30:37] here with something that you have that
[30:39] you that that you have in store for us
[30:41] for for this evening, Lord. In the
[30:43] season that each and everyone is going
[30:45] through, Lord, you know, Lord, Lord,
[30:47] bless those that are able to give this
[30:49] evening. Bless those that are not able
[30:50] to give. May you give them, Lord, so
[30:53] next time they are able to give, Lord,
[30:55] bless those that are streaming, Lord.
[30:56] Bless those that are not able to make
[30:58] it. Bless those that are sick. Lord, may
[31:00] you provide healing in their body. Yes.
[31:02] Bless those that are weak in their body.
[31:04] Give them strength. Those that need
[31:06] deliverance, Lord, I pray that you
[31:07] deliver them, Lord. It may not be quick.
[31:09] It may not be as 24 hours, Lord. It may
[31:12] be a season of suffering and pain, but
[31:14] we know throughout at the end of all,
[31:15] Lord, that we will have our answer and
[31:18] our deliverance will come. Our healing
[31:20] will come, Lord. Our questions shall be
[31:22] answered, Lord, because you are the God
[31:23] that keep his promise, Lord. You you
[31:25] kept a covenant with Israel, Lord. You
[31:27] shall keep it with your bride, Lord. So
[31:29] we we give everything back unto you
[31:32] Lord. We pray all this in the name of
[31:33] Jesus Christ. Amen.

[41:42] to our hearts, Lord. May we be blessed
[41:45] and be blessed to be together and
[41:46] fulfill your ordinances. Lord, we love
[41:48] you. We commit the service to you in
[41:50] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. We'll just
[41:53] have a few comments before communion. If
[41:55] you want to turn in your Bibles, uh
[41:57] we're just going to read uh 1
[41:59] Corinthians chapter 10 before we go into
[42:01] uh
[42:02] communion. Um but for context, you know,
[42:06] anytime you jump into the word, you you
[42:09] want some context so then you back up
[42:11] and before you know it, you're all the
[42:13] way back to in the beginning, God gone.
[42:15] you know, but uh I want to just um to
[42:19] catch a little context of Paul writing
[42:21] in 1 Corinthians, we'll just start with
[42:23] chapter 9 and verse 24. If you'll you'll
[42:26] turn
[42:29] there and we'll let you be seated.
[42:33] 1 Corinthians 9 and 24 says, "Know ye
[42:38] not that they which run in a race run
[42:41] all, but one receiveth the prize, so run
[42:46] that you may obtain." Amen. You may be
[42:48] seated. Amen. We'll just walk a little
[42:50] through the scripture here just for a
[42:52] few moments. Try not to uh be long. Um,
[42:56] I'm going to try to stay focused and
[43:00] uh I just move through here. So, I
[43:03] believe that just by reading the Bible,
[43:05] we can be blessed. Amen. It is the it is
[43:09] the word of God. It's the inspired word
[43:11] of God and it's the word that we feed
[43:13] on. And as um I was letting my dad know,
[43:17] I said, "We're we're just going to uh
[43:20] just maybe do a little
[43:22] uh just have a little study." And he
[43:24] said, "Yeah, you know, anything you
[43:26] know, the prophet said, and I said,
[43:27] "Well, I'm going to read a little bit of
[43:28] Paul." And he said, "Well, Brother
[43:30] Brandon preached what Paul preached." I
[43:31] said, "Amen." I said, "That's the
[43:33] truth." I I know if I started pulling in
[43:35] all the quotes to, "Well, then we would
[43:38] just need eternity, wouldn't we?" That's
[43:39] how the word of God is. But if you
[43:41] continue reading your Bibles, just keep
[43:43] them handy. We're just going to move
[43:44] right through if that would be okay. I
[43:46] pray it'll be a blessing. Um, we'll just
[43:49] continue to read right there. Um because
[43:52] like I said, I'm going to try to stay
[43:53] really focused because any uh the word
[43:55] of God is is so uh it's eternal. So you
[43:58] you read right there. So run that you
[44:00] may obtain. And if you could just go on
[44:03] that and just just go and go and go, but
[44:05] we want to try to come down and channel
[44:07] and just follow through the word. And he
[44:08] goes, "And every man that striveth for
[44:10] the mastery is temperant in all things."
[44:12] No. Now they do it to obtain a
[44:15] corruptible crown, but we an
[44:18] incorruptible and uh my every verse you
[44:21] could just preach uh forever on. You see
[44:24] how the world they they invest so much
[44:26] into things that are going to waste away
[44:29] and are corruptible. But we and
[44:30] incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[44:35] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[44:38] beatth the air but I keep under my body
[44:40] and bring it into subjection lest by any
[44:43] means when I've preached to others I
[44:45] myself should be a castway. So you know
[44:48] we're we're in the book of Corinthians
[44:50] and and you know uh you know it's it's a
[44:53] it's a book of correction. It's a great
[44:54] book of teaching. You know, brother
[44:56] Brandham would speak of the Corinthian
[44:58] church and he said the Corinthians, they
[44:59] could they could believe anything. They
[45:01] just wouldn't believe the right
[45:03] thing, you know, and and and he said and
[45:05] he said he couldn't he said Paul
[45:07] couldn't teach the Corinthians deep
[45:09] things because they were baby fashion.
[45:11] But but you know, that doesn't mean we
[45:13] all a sudden uh discount the book of
[45:16] Corinthians. Oh, I'm too mature for
[45:18] that. I'm an Ephesians believer. No,
[45:20] this is this is needful to teach us and
[45:24] instruct us the ways of the Lord because
[45:27] we we we you can't you can't just go on
[45:30] and and and think that you you you can
[45:32] discount any of the word of go. No, it's
[45:33] it all comes together and a mature
[45:35] believer can pick up the the book of
[45:37] Corinthians and God can continue to
[45:39] instruct and to and to teach. And and so
[45:42] I just this just come on my heart as we
[45:44] we're going to go into communion. I
[45:45] thought, well, maybe the Lord would have
[45:47] us know a little bit about this. So,
[45:48] let's just move right into um uh chapter
[45:51] 10. He says, "Moreover, brethren, I
[45:53] would not that ye should be ignorant how
[45:56] that all our fathers were under the
[45:58] cloud, and all passed to the sea, and
[46:00] were all baptized unto Moses in the
[46:02] cloud and in the sea, and did eat all
[46:04] the same spiritual meat, and did all
[46:06] drink the same spiritual drink. For they
[46:08] drank of that spiritual rock that
[46:10] followed them." And that rock was
[46:12] Christ. But with many of them, God was
[46:15] not well pleased. For they were
[46:17] overthrown in the wilderness. You know,
[46:20] the devil's still trying to overthrow
[46:21] God's believers and those that are
[46:23] following a vindicated prophet, right?
[46:24] He's he's trying to overthrow you. He
[46:26] says, "Now these things were our
[46:28] examples to the intent we should not
[46:30] lust after evil things as they also
[46:33] lusted. Neither be idolattors as were
[46:35] some of them. As it is written, the
[46:37] people sat down to eat and drink and
[46:39] rose up and play. Neither let us commit
[46:41] fornication as some of them committed
[46:43] and fell in one day three and 20,000.
[46:45] Neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[46:47] them also tempted and were destroyed of
[46:50] serpents. Neither murmur ye as some of
[46:53] them also murmured and were destroyed of
[46:55] the destroyer. Now all these things
[46:58] happened unto them for in samples and
[47:01] they are written for our admonition upon
[47:04] whom the ends of the world are come. So
[47:06] when we read these things, it's and it's
[47:09] an example or a warning of what we
[47:12] should do and what we shouldn't do. It
[47:14] shows a a pattern or a direction or
[47:17] results of decisions. Right? That's he's
[47:20] saying these things are deci an examples
[47:22] to us. So when we look into the word and
[47:24] we see decisions or or that people have
[47:27] made and we see the result of it, it's
[47:29] instruction to us of what to do and what
[47:32] not to do. And I was just thinking of
[47:33] that. If you'll turn in Numbers 21,
[47:35] we'll just we'll just catch an example
[47:37] real quick of what one of those things
[47:40] were in Numbers chapter 21 and verse
[47:45] 1-6. Uh this is one of the examples that
[47:48] Paul uh was referring
[47:52] to. And just kind of picking up there,
[47:54] he says, "And when the king Ahad the
[47:57] Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
[47:59] heard tell that Israel came by the way
[48:01] of the spies, then he fought against
[48:03] Israel and took some
[48:06] prisoners." And Israel vowed a vow unto
[48:08] the Lord, and said, "If thou wil indeed
[48:11] deliver this people into my hand, then I
[48:14] will utterly destroy their cities." And
[48:15] the Lord hearkened to the voice of
[48:17] Israel and delivered up the Canaanites,
[48:19] and they utterly destroyed them in their
[48:21] cities. And he called the name of the
[48:22] place Horma. And they journeyed from
[48:25] Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea to
[48:27] compass the land of Edom. And the soul
[48:29] of the people was much discouraged
[48:32] because of the way. And the people spake
[48:35] against God and against Moses. Wherefore
[48:37] have ye brought us up out of Egypt to
[48:42] die in the wilderness? For there is no
[48:44] bread, neither is there any water. And
[48:46] our soul loa this light bread. And the
[48:50] Lord sent fiery serpents among the
[48:52] people and they bit the people. And much
[48:55] people of Israel died. Ain't that just
[48:59] like man to serve God in the good times?
[49:02] You know, Lord, if you'll give me this
[49:04] and that, you know, we we'll follow you.
[49:06] We'll serve you. And then God comes with
[49:08] a mighty hand and hey, and delivers them
[49:10] what they asked for and and makes a way
[49:12] for them. And then he's leading them.
[49:15] and the way that he was leading him, the
[49:17] people started to get uh uh
[49:19] discontented.
[49:21] I thought it was amazing to me that a
[49:22] vindicated prophet and a pillar of fire
[49:24] by day and a cloud by night wasn't
[49:26] enough for them.
[49:29] Think about it. They're del having their
[49:31] task masters, every single one of them
[49:33] dead in the Red Sea. It wasn't enough
[49:36] for them and they got discouraged in the
[49:39] way
[49:40] because they forgot.
[49:45] They forgot where they come from. They
[49:47] forgot, you know what? This is God's
[49:48] provided way. We are being led by a
[49:52] vindicated prophet. We are being led by
[49:55] a pillar of fire and and if the way gets
[49:57] hard, you we would say we as believers,
[50:00] we want to say, you know what, Lord, if
[50:02] this is the way you want to go, if this
[50:03] is the way the prophets's taken, if this
[50:05] if this is the way where the pillar of
[50:06] fire is taken, I don't want to go any
[50:08] other way.
[50:11] Right?
[50:12] You know, just because the way might
[50:14] seem better, if the pillar of fire ain't
[50:16] there, I don't want to go if the prophet
[50:19] didn't teach it, I don't want to learn
[50:20] it
[50:22] because it it's it I don't need it. You
[50:24] see, why why study things? You know,
[50:28] when you fellowship around the word, um
[50:31] I I I realized as a as a as a young
[50:33] Christian, hypotheticals do you no good?
[50:37] you know, you you start to you start to
[50:39] uh uh uh look into the word and you
[50:41] start to wonder, well, what happens? But
[50:43] if this didn't or that, you know, well,
[50:44] what would that have been? And and I
[50:47] remember year years ago I I I learned a
[50:49] a valuable lesson. I I called up brother
[50:52] Tim Puit and one time I was on a road
[50:54] trip and we were just fellowshipping and
[50:56] and one of these ideas popped into my
[50:57] head and I was like, "Oh yeah, you know,
[50:59] well, I was just thinking, you know,
[51:00] what happens if if Adam and Eve never
[51:02] fail and and and so here's the serpent.
[51:05] How would how would if God had done and
[51:08] you know and all of a sudden I was like
[51:09] you know what I mean brother Tim he's
[51:10] like you he was like nope I don't I
[51:13] don't know what you mean at all cuz
[51:15] that's not what happened that's not what
[51:18] what and then he started and I and he
[51:20] started to just say what the word said
[51:21] and I'm like kind of like well yeah you
[51:23] know I mean that was okay yes that's
[51:24] right it doesn't matter the the
[51:26] hypothetical the only thing that matters
[51:28] is what he said right and and and it's
[51:32] so easy to get discouraged in the way
[51:33] you know just stay with what He said if
[51:36] you can't understand it, hey, we're
[51:37] being led. Let's not let's not do we
[51:41] have an example, right? That that how
[51:43] they started to get discouraged in the
[51:44] way and God was supernaturally bringing
[51:47] in that way. I mean, their shoes weren't
[51:49] wearing out. They had fresh mana every
[51:51] day, but it's it's just like man to get
[51:54] discouraged and serve God in the good
[51:56] times, but they start to murmur and
[51:58] complain. And I just think, where is the
[52:00] trust? Where is the faithfulness? You
[52:03] know, it's amazing. It's amazing how uh
[52:06] uh
[52:06] uh the word wasn't enough. What God
[52:09] provided wasn't enough. And that's in
[52:11] the flesh realm. If you're not careful,
[52:13] you allow that serpent nature to start
[52:16] to to think and dwell on things that you
[52:18] shouldn't. And that's how you'll get
[52:20] discouraged in the way. But these things
[52:22] are written for our instruction to
[52:24] admonish us and make us aware. Going on
[52:26] to verse 12, it says, "Wherefore let him
[52:28] that thinkketh he standeth take heed
[52:30] lest he fall." That's right. Take heed
[52:34] lest you fall. So we we we have examples
[52:37] in the scriptures.
[52:39] We have examples in the church ages.
[52:42] We have examples in our church. We have
[52:45] examples in our families. In our
[52:48] marriages, in our children. That's
[52:49] right. I mean, if if you're not
[52:51] learning, let's start learning.
[52:55] you know, if you're not getting the
[52:56] right result at home and you wonder why
[52:58] you always have a bad atmosphere,
[53:00] you know, let let's fix it. We we have
[53:03] examples and things to do and how to
[53:05] change the atmosphere. And we look into
[53:07] the message. If if if there's a bad
[53:09] atmosphere in the home, it's time to put
[53:10] on the apron. It's time to get to work.
[53:13] That's right. But we're so far above
[53:16] everything and so
[53:17] spiritual, we don't know how to get
[53:19] dirty.
[53:21] You You got to get dirty. You got to get
[53:22] to cleaning. You got to get to work. You
[53:24] got to take responsibility. Ain't that
[53:26] what the prophet did and come home and
[53:27] the house was all a wreck? He didn't
[53:30] say, "I've been out on the mission field
[53:31] preaching the gospel, winning souls, and
[53:33] when I come home, I should have a hot
[53:35] dinner on the table. Why are the kids
[53:36] fussing and fighting and and and you
[53:38] should have an atmosphere here that I
[53:40] can come to? What's wrong with you?" You
[53:42] know, he come home and said, "Oh my
[53:43] Lord." And he just thought, "Oh, honey,
[53:45] dear." And he put on that apron a little
[53:47] he he'd be praying for her and what was
[53:49] he doing? He was a he was a creator,
[53:53] right? Yeah. Creating an atmosphere. G.
[53:55] He put the apron on. He started washing.
[53:57] He started helping out. And he said
[53:58] before you know it, the atmosphere came
[54:01] on and the kids were now playing and
[54:03] everything was all right. We have
[54:04] examples.
[54:06] I if you're discouraged in the way it's
[54:09] it say Lord Lord why am I discouraged?
[54:11] Why is this bothering me? What are you
[54:13] trying to show me? Is something wrong?
[54:15] Lord if something's wrong I want to make
[54:16] it right. I I I I have these examples. I
[54:19] see how these things happen and and all
[54:20] these things and and so we don't just
[54:23] have what's written in the scripture,
[54:25] but we we also have a a vindicated
[54:29] prophet whose life was an open book, an
[54:32] example of a shewave in our day of of
[54:35] how uh uh to to to in the times of
[54:37] discouragement. Yes, sir. Come on. We
[54:40] get discouraged.
[54:42] But one thing we should never be
[54:44] discouraged in is in the provided way.
[54:47] That's right. Cuz that's the only way to
[54:49] make it through.
[54:51] I mean, or you'll just keep going in
[54:53] circles. That's right. Until one day you
[54:56] finally say, "Have I compassed this
[54:59] mountain long enough?" Yes, sir. The
[55:01] message is right, Lord. Let me go on.
[55:03] Let's go on into all the promises of
[55:05] God. May I just submit? May I surrender?
[55:07] Lord, I realize my ways are not your
[55:11] ways, and I'm done trying to make it.
[55:13] Lord, I'm going to take heed lest I
[55:16] fall. Verse 13 says, "There hath no
[55:19] temptation taken you, but such as is
[55:21] common to man, but God is faithful, who
[55:24] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[55:25] that you are able, but will with the
[55:27] temptation also make a way to escape
[55:31] that you may be able to bear it." So,
[55:33] there's a there's a a way of escape, a
[55:36] provided way. You know, the prophet
[55:38] would talk about how men with their
[55:40] science and education, they're always
[55:42] trying to find a way. And said, even
[55:43] right now, they're trying to dig down be
[55:45] in into the bottoms of the earth to to
[55:48] to escape the the atomic bombs that are
[55:51] coming. And he was saying that way back
[55:53] in 50s and 60s. And I'm surely he
[55:56] probably even saw what they were trying
[55:59] to do because now you can buy one if you
[56:02] if you want to go look at they have them
[56:04] for for sale. They have these silos that
[56:07] are thousands of feet in the earth and
[56:09] you can go down and live in that thing
[56:11] for a long time. And you know, it
[56:14] wouldn't bother humans today because
[56:15] they're basically cut off from the world
[56:17] anyways. Like do do we get cell service
[56:19] down there? You know, put me in a little
[56:22] cubicle. I'm fine.
[56:25] But they're they're they're trying. Man
[56:26] has a provided way, but God has a
[56:30] provided way. And and that is the only
[56:32] way of escape is the provided way. And
[56:35] we know that is the word of God. It's
[56:38] the message of the hour that has been
[56:40] delivered to this bride. Verse 14.
[56:42] Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from
[56:45] idolatry. I speak as to wise men, judge
[56:47] ye that I say, the cup of blessing which
[56:50] we bless. Is it not the communion of the
[56:53] blood of Christ? The bread which we
[56:55] break, is it not the communion of the
[56:58] body of Christ? For we being many are
[57:01] one bread and one body. For we are all
[57:03] partakers of that one bread. You you
[57:07] talk about fellowship. Fellowship by the
[57:10] blood. Fellowship by redemption.
[57:12] Fellowship by reconciliation. That's
[57:14] that's the fellowship of the body of
[57:16] Christ. For by one spirit we're all
[57:18] baptized into that body. We're partakers
[57:21] of one bread. That's right. Not many
[57:24] bread, not many. It's one bread.
[57:28] I am the bread
[57:30] that came down out of heaven. Except you
[57:34] eat the flesh of the son of man and
[57:36] drink his blood, you have no life of
[57:38] you. Think about it now, what Paul's
[57:39] talking about this
[57:41] communion. Really, if there's anybody on
[57:43] the face of the earth that can have
[57:45] communion, it's the provided way that
[57:47] God has given the bride that we have
[57:50] communion with him.
[57:52] Unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[57:53] blood. He said, "My my flesh is meat
[57:55] indeed. My my blood is drink indeed."
[57:58] Well, they couldn't understand it.
[58:01] Oh, but
[58:03] we we we have that bread. I am the bread
[58:08] that cometh down out of heaven. That's
[58:10] what if you just turn in your Bibles
[58:11] real quick to John 6:56, we'll read it.
[58:14] I mean, everything I tell you what, you
[58:17] ought to listen to a a message.
[58:20] uh and brother Brandham and actually
[58:22] start writing down every scriptural
[58:24] reference. You'll find out I it's it's
[58:26] it's the spirit of prophecy. It's just
[58:29] Bible Bible word word. And a lot of
[58:32] times we take it for granted and we we
[58:34] don't realize that um brother Brandon
[58:37] preached the Bible. This isn't something
[58:39] new and made up and and even so where
[58:41] the Lord had to come back around and say
[58:42] it's not on the back side of the book.
[58:44] Everything's in there.
[58:46] The seals just had to be taken off that
[58:49] we would be able to see it in there
[58:50] because without look without Malachi
[58:52] 45:5 this is a closed book
[58:55] you're presuming and probing but John
[58:58] 6:56 let me get
[59:01] there all familiar things but I think
[59:04] it's good to go through the Bible and
[59:06] and uh revisit these things because
[59:09] these are our foundations right uh John
[59:13] 6:56 he says says, "He that eateth my
[59:16] flesh and drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth
[59:18] in me and I in him. As the living father
[59:22] has sent me, and I live by the Father,
[59:24] so he that eateth me, even he shall live
[59:27] by me. This is the bread that came down
[59:30] from heaven. Not as your father did eat
[59:33] mana and are dead. He that eateth of
[59:35] this bread shall live forever."
[59:40] I am the bread that cometh down out of
[59:43] heaven. What is it? That's that's
[59:44] Revelations 10. The mighty angel coming
[59:48] down, the prophet of God said only
[59:50] Christ that could be
[59:53] right. So then, and I I stuck this quote
[59:56] in here because I wanted to read it.
[59:58] Sometimes we we run through these
[1:00:00] things, but in in in anointed ones at
[1:00:02] the end time, the prophet said, "The son
[1:00:04] of man is Christ. He is the one that
[1:00:07] you're feeding on." That's right. You're
[1:00:09] not feeding on a man. and a man, his
[1:00:11] words will fail. But you're feeding on
[1:00:15] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:00:19] man.
[1:00:20] We are fulfilling the very scripture
[1:00:23] that Jesus spoke of. Unless you eat my
[1:00:26] flesh and drink my blood, you have no
[1:00:28] life in you. But oh, if you eat if you
[1:00:31] eat this word, you become one with me.
[1:00:34] what what the whole Christian world is
[1:00:36] searching for. We have we have the way
[1:00:40] of escape. We we have the bread of life,
[1:00:42] not a portion of the word. We have the
[1:00:44] fullness of the word. We don't have
[1:00:46] something that has mold on it and it's
[1:00:48] it's it's decaying away and and you're
[1:00:50] just trying to get by. No, this is life
[1:00:53] sustaining word. Amen.
[1:00:56] He said, "If you haven't fed fully on
[1:00:58] every word to give you strength to fly
[1:01:00] above all these denominations and things
[1:01:02] of the world, will you at this time do
[1:01:04] it while we pray?" I say we ought to
[1:01:07] approach communion this way because we
[1:01:09] are feeding on the body word, son of
[1:01:11] man. Just continuing on in our study
[1:01:13] here in in Corinthians 10. Just go back
[1:01:16] there uh now into verse 18. He says,
[1:01:18] "Behold, Israel after the
[1:01:21] flesh? Are not they which eat of the
[1:01:24] sacrifices partakers of the altar? What
[1:01:27] say I then that the idol is anything? Or
[1:01:29] that which is offered and sacrificed to
[1:01:31] idols is anything? But I say that these
[1:01:34] that the things which the Gentiles
[1:01:35] sacrifice, they are sacrificed to devils
[1:01:38] and not to God. And I would not that ye
[1:01:40] should have fellowship with devils. You
[1:01:42] cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the
[1:01:45] cup of devils. You cannot be partakers
[1:01:48] of the Lord's table and of the tables of
[1:01:50] devils. Do we provoke the Lord to
[1:01:53] jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All
[1:01:55] things are lawful for me, but all things
[1:01:58] are not expedient. All things are lawful
[1:02:01] for me, but all things edify not. Now,
[1:02:03] this let's just take some time because I
[1:02:05] I want to get some context. Jump over to
[1:02:07] uh 1 Corinthians 6 real quick. Just turn
[1:02:10] back there. 1 Corinthians 6.
[1:02:14] Because if if we really meditate on this
[1:02:18] and and really pray for revelation,
[1:02:21] uh this is something wonderful. But but
[1:02:24] Paul has already stated this to the
[1:02:26] Corinthians in in uh chapter 6 and verse
[1:02:30] 12. If you turn
[1:02:32] there, he says it like this. He says,
[1:02:36] "All things are lawful unto me, but all
[1:02:38] things are not expedient." All things
[1:02:40] are lawful for me, but I will not be
[1:02:42] brought under the power of any. So he's
[1:02:46] saying, even if it's lawful, That's
[1:02:47] right. I'm not going to be brought under
[1:02:49] the power of something, even if it's
[1:02:51] lawful for me to do it. He says meats
[1:02:54] for the belly and belly for the
[1:02:56] meats, but God shall destroy both it and
[1:03:00] them. Now the body is not for
[1:03:02] fornication, but for the Lord, and the
[1:03:05] Lord for the body.
[1:03:08] And we so we we know fornication is
[1:03:10] unclean living. And the prophet of God
[1:03:12] said the same spirit that's in
[1:03:14] fornication is the same spirit that's in
[1:03:16] organization.
[1:03:18] And if we're not careful, we we so
[1:03:19] quickly
[1:03:21] um absolve ourselves, right? Like, well,
[1:03:25] that's not me.
[1:03:27] But but we have a perfect word and we
[1:03:29] are called to go on to perfection. We we
[1:03:32] have a provided way. And the prophet of
[1:03:35] God in in is your life worthy of the
[1:03:37] gospel. He said if you don't follow
[1:03:39] Jesus every day, every step of the way,
[1:03:44] you take on an organizational life
[1:03:48] and that's a life that's not worthy of
[1:03:50] the gospel.
[1:03:52] So I say, Lord, Lord, help me. I I I
[1:03:56] want to be led every step of the every
[1:03:58] day. the these things are are not laid
[1:04:00] in there for us to just think it's some
[1:04:02] pie in the sky. But it's a promise to
[1:04:04] the believer that that's what he wants
[1:04:06] to produce in your life. And so, you
[1:04:09] know, we should seek that. Say, Lord, I
[1:04:12] want to see this in my life. I I believe
[1:04:15] that this could become a a reality,
[1:04:17] Lord, that where I can follow you every
[1:04:19] step of the way. And and Paul would go
[1:04:21] on here in in Corinthians um 6 showing
[1:04:24] how our body is a temple of the Lord.
[1:04:27] And in verse 20 he would say that for we
[1:04:29] are bought with a price. Therefore
[1:04:32] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:04:35] spirit which are gods. So we can clearly
[1:04:39] see that Paul is showing that there are
[1:04:42] things that are lawful.
[1:04:45] But we do not let those things control
[1:04:47] us.
[1:04:49] Everything you do in word or deed do all
[1:04:52] in the name of Jesus Christ. If you
[1:04:54] can't do it in Jesus name,
[1:04:57] Leave it alone. And if you can't leave
[1:05:00] it
[1:05:01] alone, it has control over you.
[1:05:05] Right. Look, we're talking about growing
[1:05:08] up. I mean, if if you if you can't
[1:05:09] handle your cell
[1:05:11] phone, it's a real problem.
[1:05:16] If you can't handle certain music, it
[1:05:18] it's controlling you. And that's not to
[1:05:22] beat you up and to try to say you're
[1:05:24] less of a Christian. No, we're being
[1:05:26] taught and instructed in a more
[1:05:28] excellent way that we could that Paul is
[1:05:31] showing us, look, just because
[1:05:32] something's lawful. Um, I I don't I
[1:05:35] don't I don't come under the control of
[1:05:36] that because I I'm a temple of the Lord.
[1:05:39] I want to be available to him in all
[1:05:41] things. No room for the de, no room for
[1:05:43] me. I'm last place. Right? So that he's
[1:05:47] showing that more excellent way that
[1:05:49] we're not brought under the power of
[1:05:51] any. So, so no job, no game, no
[1:05:53] politics, no trial, no situation will
[1:05:56] govern or control my body because it is
[1:06:00] the
[1:06:01] temple of the Lord. And and I I like
[1:06:05] this this this will take um just a
[1:06:09] moment here in as we we move to uh verse
[1:06:12] 23 in our study here of uh 1 Corinthians
[1:06:15] chapter 10. It's where he says, "All
[1:06:18] things are lawful for me, but all things
[1:06:20] are not expedient." All things are
[1:06:22] lawful for me, but all things edify not.
[1:06:26] And I I was just pondering um this
[1:06:29] scripture here
[1:06:32] um because and and looking into
[1:06:36] it. And I thought it profound how
[1:06:39] brother Brandon would would reference
[1:06:40] this scripture in in in in a few places.
[1:06:44] He would use the scripture when he would
[1:06:46] be talking about traveling overseas and
[1:06:49] he'd say, "You know what happens? I went
[1:06:50] overseas and I got and I got lonely and
[1:06:53] I went with a girl." And he said, "You
[1:06:55] know, I I she would never
[1:06:58] know." This is that voice of reason,
[1:07:01] right? Talking and saying, "Oh, if you
[1:07:03] went over and you got if if you got uh
[1:07:05] lonely and and and you and you you went
[1:07:07] with a girl, oh, she would never know."
[1:07:10] He said, "But I would know."
[1:07:13] And and as I was looking at this, I was
[1:07:15] just pondering on that and and I
[1:07:16] remember what brother Brandham said in
[1:07:19] perfect faith. And I and I just wanted
[1:07:20] to read that. He said, "Notice St. John
[1:07:22] means in 1 John 3:20, he said, "If our
[1:07:24] heart condemn us not, then we have
[1:07:26] confidence towards God. But as long as
[1:07:28] you're doing things that's wrong, you
[1:07:30] can't have confidence towards God." He
[1:07:33] said, he said, "I love her too much. I
[1:07:34] couldn't even face her in that." And and
[1:07:37] a lot of times where we're at in our
[1:07:40] lives, we feel so much condemnation
[1:07:42] because of of maybe things that we've
[1:07:44] done, we feel like we can't even face
[1:07:47] God. But as long as you're doing things
[1:07:50] that's wrong, you can't have confidence
[1:07:51] towards God. So you see, you you'll
[1:07:53] automatically know that you're wrong.
[1:07:55] You automatically put your yourself back
[1:07:57] there as a sinner by knowing that you're
[1:07:59] wrong. But when your heart don't condemn
[1:08:01] you and you know you are a believer and
[1:08:04] there's nothing between you and God, you
[1:08:06] can ask what you will and know that
[1:08:08] it'll be given because it's the word
[1:08:10] that's given to you just like it was to
[1:08:13] those disciples. Now the only thing you
[1:08:15] have to do then is have faith in what
[1:08:18] you are. Have faith in what the word
[1:08:20] says you are. And and Jesus had faith in
[1:08:22] the word of God that said he was it is
[1:08:26] written of me. Didn't David in the
[1:08:27] Psalms and the prophets and all them
[1:08:28] speak of him? I am the bread of life
[1:08:30] that come down out of heaven. Amen. I am
[1:08:32] the tree of life from the garden of
[1:08:33] Eden. I am all these things. I am that I
[1:08:35] am. And he knew with that perfect faith
[1:08:37] that he was the anointed Messiah that
[1:08:40] the spirit of God was upon him. He said,
[1:08:42] "Now I myself do nothing, but it's my
[1:08:44] faith in God." And God was in him and
[1:08:47] the word manifest. And when the word of
[1:08:49] God comes in
[1:08:50] you, it's made manifest for you are a
[1:08:54] believer. See, and a believer is the
[1:08:56] faith of God that moves in you. And and
[1:09:00] I and I I I believe that this very word
[1:09:03] that that Paul is preaching, I it can
[1:09:06] move in us where may the word have such
[1:09:10] preeminence in our lives moving in us
[1:09:12] that we are prisoners of Christ, a love
[1:09:14] slave to him where brother Brand would
[1:09:16] say, "And if I love my wife that much,
[1:09:18] what about my Lord?"
[1:09:20] And and he he he gives this scenario and
[1:09:23] then he says, "And if I love my wife
[1:09:25] that much, what about my Lord?" Paul
[1:09:27] said, "All things are lawful, not
[1:09:28] expedient." And it struck me that
[1:09:31] whether it be some great sin or even
[1:09:33] something that's lawful but not
[1:09:34] expedient.
[1:09:36] Oh, you talk about a honing down,
[1:09:38] church.
[1:09:41] You talk about a honing down to where we
[1:09:43] we want to get to a place where we're so
[1:09:45] sensitive. Yes, sir. Look, look, the
[1:09:48] prophet was was was
[1:09:50] crushed a and his will uh just totally,
[1:09:54] if I could say it that way, but but he
[1:09:56] he was he was so
[1:10:00] surrendered that he was so depending on
[1:10:02] him
[1:10:05] where to go and to turn left or to right
[1:10:07] when the wind would blow maybe a he
[1:10:08] said, "Lord, is that you?" A
[1:10:11] sensitivity. We're so set in our ways
[1:10:14] and we got our nineto-5
[1:10:17] Are are we are have we been brought
[1:10:19] under control of things that are
[1:10:23] lawful to where we're just in such
[1:10:27] control by Lady Oia? Oh no, I I I can't
[1:10:30] be late to work. Oh, I I can't miss work
[1:10:34] for the word. I can't do this or that.
[1:10:36] What power are we under? What are you
[1:10:38] putting your trust in? What are you
[1:10:40] putting your confidence in? And and it
[1:10:42] just struck me how my I I I want to be
[1:10:45] so in love with God that that that I'm
[1:10:48] such a love slave to him that when maybe
[1:10:51] something might be
[1:10:53] lawful, but I say,
[1:10:55] "Lord, maybe this isn't furthering your
[1:10:57] kingdom,
[1:11:01] we're talking about a maturity,
[1:11:05] a furthering the kingdom of God to where
[1:11:08] I ain't saying that you you you can't
[1:11:10] play games and you can't do certain
[1:11:13] things, that's
[1:11:16] lawful. But when it starts to take
[1:11:19] away from a real leading and to where
[1:11:22] you're hungering for those things and
[1:11:24] you have a thirst for things besides the
[1:11:26] leadership and will of God and things
[1:11:28] you can't do in his name, where you
[1:11:30] can't uh uh uh you know, have a little
[1:11:32] prayer and Lord, I want you to be a part
[1:11:34] of this. That's something you need to
[1:11:36] move away from. So if we move on to
[1:11:39] verse 24, he says, "Let no man seek his
[1:11:41] own, but every man another's wealth."
[1:11:43] Well, there's a hard
[1:11:45] one. We We all want to make ourselves
[1:11:48] better, but we don't want to make
[1:11:49] anybody else
[1:11:51] better. We can just let that one go, but
[1:11:55] we ought to be looking on
[1:11:58] others. We're so busy taking care of
[1:12:00] ourselves that we have no time for
[1:12:02] anybody else. Verse 25. Whatsoever is
[1:12:06] sold in the shambles that eat asking no
[1:12:09] question for conscience
[1:12:10] sake. Now, just to help you with that a
[1:12:13] little bit, shambles is a meat market or
[1:12:15] a grocery store. And so, um, to give
[1:12:18] some context to that, I was just
[1:12:20] thinking on this that, you know, um,
[1:12:22] he's he just went through speaking
[1:12:24] about, you know, food and things,
[1:12:26] sacrifices offered to devils. And he's
[1:12:29] he's and he's talking to a people who
[1:12:32] are coming out of law into grace because
[1:12:34] I mean we've seen legalism within the
[1:12:37] frameworks of the message of the hour
[1:12:39] and it's it's
[1:12:43] bondage not
[1:12:46] liberty. And people look at the message
[1:12:48] and would think that you're in bondage.
[1:12:51] They see maybe a wall and they see uh uh
[1:12:54] rules and regulations and all these
[1:12:57] things around and say, "Well, you can't
[1:12:58] go and do anything." It's they have the
[1:13:00] wrong perception. I It's the walls and
[1:13:03] the fences and everything is keeping all
[1:13:05] the nonsense out.
[1:13:07] It's protection.
[1:13:09] It's liberty. It's freedom. You're
[1:13:13] covered in the blood. You're covered by
[1:13:14] the word. Free to worship. Free to
[1:13:17] praise. Amen. Amen. Unencumbered by the
[1:13:20] things of the world. You're protected. I
[1:13:23] it's it's a liberty. But and so if if I
[1:13:27] could say what I see in this, he's
[1:13:29] saying that I it's you don't have to you
[1:13:33] don't have to be nervous and anxious and
[1:13:34] be like, I I I bought hamburger meat at
[1:13:37] the store. I wonder if I wonder if the
[1:13:39] farm it came from if if they're
[1:13:41] unbelievers and maybe they offered it to
[1:13:43] to uh to devils and and now we got to
[1:13:47] research everything and you know you
[1:13:49] know how you get it and it's like 40%
[1:13:51] 60% or 80% they're like well you know
[1:13:53] 30%'s offered to devils but you know hey
[1:13:55] I think we're good. He's saying look
[1:13:58] don't worry about for your conscience
[1:13:59] sake just he he says he says whatsoever
[1:14:02] sold in that shambles that eat asking no
[1:14:04] questions for conscience
[1:14:06] sake for the earth is the Lord and the
[1:14:09] fullness thereof if any of them that
[1:14:11] believe not bid you to feast and you be
[1:14:15] disposed to go whatsoever is set before
[1:14:17] you eat asking no questions for your
[1:14:20] conscience's
[1:14:22] sake that's some of our problems you
[1:14:24] just always have a question
[1:14:26] we We need to be certain of God. Lord, I
[1:14:30] I I I I this person invited me over and
[1:14:33] and you know, I'm going to go over
[1:14:34] there, Father, maybe I can say something
[1:14:36] and lead them to you. But Satan will get
[1:14:39] you so nervous. Oh, the token's not
[1:14:41] applied and maybe this and that. No, you
[1:14:44] you you you you if you get all anxious
[1:14:46] and worried and and I was just and I was
[1:14:49] just sharing this and talking to my
[1:14:50] family about it, how how you know uh
[1:14:54] music is a big gray area and and and I
[1:14:56] say I I I I the believers that get up
[1:15:00] and and uh uh sing songs unto the Lord
[1:15:03] and they worship with their heart, I I
[1:15:05] don't ask questions for conscience
[1:15:08] sake, you know, and and because if you
[1:15:11] go back and you find out where some of
[1:15:12] those things came from, you know, you
[1:15:14] find out that's a little, you know,
[1:15:15] that's a that's a little questionable
[1:15:17] there. And so I teach my family, you
[1:15:19] know, if if I I like for my family's
[1:15:22] sake just to maybe look into it. That
[1:15:24] way, um, if we're the ones to present
[1:15:26] it, that if somebody looks up where it
[1:15:28] came from, they might not think that's
[1:15:29] something we would promote. But but I I
[1:15:32] let you know right now, I I I'm not ever
[1:15:34] going to be in the seat of the critic.
[1:15:36] If somebody gets up and sings a song of
[1:15:38] the Lord, I I'm all for it. Praise God.
[1:15:41] God bless them. I'm not going to sit
[1:15:42] over there and be like with a question
[1:15:44] in my mind, well, let me see if I can
[1:15:46] worship to that
[1:15:48] song. Wait a second. Let me let me Okay,
[1:15:51] yeah, we're good. I've seen people under
[1:15:55] that bondage.
[1:15:57] They they they've been taught it in such
[1:15:58] a way to question everything that
[1:16:00] they're sitting in service. Praise the
[1:16:02] Lord. And the song service goes to the
[1:16:04] next one. Oh, I know where that one come
[1:16:07] from. Can't can't worship to that one.
[1:16:10] Hallelujah. Oh, sorry. They don't know
[1:16:13] what to do. And and I feel that this is
[1:16:16] great teaching from Paul. Look for if
[1:16:18] it's set before you, just just enter in.
[1:16:20] You know, partake of it. You don't have
[1:16:22] to question everything and be legalism.
[1:16:24] Where did that come from? Where did that
[1:16:25] come from? Can I do this? Can I do that?
[1:16:27] Have liberty.
[1:16:29] That's right. The Lord loves you. And if
[1:16:32] you're doing something ain't right,
[1:16:33] he'll tell you. You'll feel something in
[1:16:36] your spirit and you'll be like, you
[1:16:37] know, maybe I maybe I ought to check
[1:16:39] into that. But when we get into a place
[1:16:41] where we're questioning everything and
[1:16:43] forcing this conviction on them and they
[1:16:45] ought to dress like this, they shouldn't
[1:16:46] sing that, they shouldn't do that, we we
[1:16:47] we've got we we're missing it.
[1:16:50] Now, a pastor has the right to stand in
[1:16:52] the pulpit and tell you exactly which
[1:16:54] way and what not to where to go. And
[1:16:56] that's his position and he's ordained by
[1:16:58] God to lead you through. That's right.
[1:17:00] So, so you listen to that, but you
[1:17:02] understand what I'm saying and what
[1:17:04] Paul's teaching here. You don't if it's
[1:17:05] set before you and you just, you know
[1:17:07] what, I'm trusting the Lord here. You
[1:17:10] don't have to ask all these questions.
[1:17:11] Are are you are are you seeing that what
[1:17:13] what's being said here in the scripture?
[1:17:16] Are you with me? Okay. If any of them
[1:17:19] that believe not bid you to feast and
[1:17:21] you be disposed to go, whatsoever is set
[1:17:23] before you, eat, ask no questions for
[1:17:25] the conscience's sake. But if a man say
[1:17:28] unto you, this is offered in sacrifice
[1:17:30] unto
[1:17:31] idols, eat not for his sake that showed
[1:17:35] it.
[1:17:38] Look, would I have family?
[1:17:41] Um, I'm going to stay focused.
[1:17:46] But eat not for his sake that showed it
[1:17:49] and for a conscious sake. For the earth
[1:17:51] is the Lord and the fullness of thereof.
[1:17:53] I I'll just say it like this. It said
[1:17:55] for their sake because you're testifying
[1:17:58] to them. I I don't partake of those
[1:18:00] things. And when I have family come into
[1:18:03] town, you know what I do? I testify to
[1:18:05] them. I go to church.
[1:18:08] You want to come visit me between 10 and
[1:18:11] 1 o'clock on Sunday, I'm gonna be here
[1:18:15] or in another church somewhere
[1:18:19] traveling and between five and right
[1:18:23] because I'm testifying to them that
[1:18:25] that's what I do. And I I think there's
[1:18:28] something to gather from it. It says, it
[1:18:30] says if they say what what this is for,
[1:18:32] eat it not for their sake. Letting them
[1:18:35] know, no, I don't believe like that. And
[1:18:38] then they know, okay, that offends you.
[1:18:39] I I I I won't I won't offer that to you.
[1:18:43] You know, you have a lot of friends you
[1:18:44] come in contact. I I I have friends I'll
[1:18:46] come in contact, you know, and and
[1:18:47] they're kind and they they they you
[1:18:49] know, they clean up their talk and
[1:18:51] everything and sometimes every once in a
[1:18:53] while a word will slip out. They say,
[1:18:54] "Oh, I'm sorry, brother. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:18:56] sorry I said that." They don't say
[1:18:57] brother, but I'm sorry I said that
[1:19:00] because they have respect for me and you
[1:19:01] have respect for one another and I and I
[1:19:03] believe that the these things are
[1:19:05] wonderful. He he doesn't say right here,
[1:19:08] this is offered uh is sacrifice unto
[1:19:11] idols, eating not for his sake that it
[1:19:13] showed and for conscious sake and then
[1:19:15] go on and say you should really read him
[1:19:17] the rights act. No, but it's an
[1:19:19] opportunity say, "Oh, you know, I'm
[1:19:21] sorry. you know, I I can't partake of
[1:19:23] that because of of what it's being
[1:19:24] offered to, but I' I'd be happy if if
[1:19:27] maybe we we we did this. We I can I can
[1:19:30] share in this together. And you know
[1:19:31] what? A lot of times you'll find out
[1:19:32] people are just they're just interested
[1:19:34] in having fellowship, too. Find
[1:19:36] something common. Find something that
[1:19:39] you can do in common. But don't go on
[1:19:41] their grounds.
[1:19:43] Then you're partaking. There's certain
[1:19:46] things we don't do because we're
[1:19:47] testifying to them there's a better way.
[1:19:50] Moving on here. just
[1:19:52] um 29 conscience I say not thine own but
[1:19:56] of the other for why is my liberty
[1:19:58] judged of another man's conscience it's
[1:20:01] the very thing that we were moving in
[1:20:03] through this my we get to such a place
[1:20:05] where our own liberty is being judged by
[1:20:08] somebody else's conviction and we feel
[1:20:10] like we have no
[1:20:11] freedom we must get past allowing what
[1:20:14] other people think to rob us of our
[1:20:16] liberty our liberty is in the Holy Ghost
[1:20:19] our liberty is in Christ, the anointed
[1:20:21] word of the hour. Not what a man thinks
[1:20:23] we should do with the word, but what he
[1:20:26] wants us to do with the word. That's
[1:20:28] right. Ain't that what he said in the
[1:20:30] church age book that this is the secret?
[1:20:31] The word is in the bride as it was in
[1:20:34] Mary. She has the mind of Christ and she
[1:20:36] knows what he wants done with the word.
[1:20:39] Verse
[1:20:40] 30. Where did my phone
[1:20:44] go? Oh my. Just even reading the Bible
[1:20:46] verse starts to get long. I apologize. I
[1:20:48] thought it'd be just 30 minutes. 39.
[1:20:51] We're just coming to a close
[1:20:53] here. For uh in verse 30 now, he says,
[1:20:57] "For if by grace be a partaker, why am I
[1:21:00] evil spoken of? For that which I give
[1:21:04] thanks, whether therefore ye eat or
[1:21:06] drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
[1:21:10] the glory of God. Give none offense,
[1:21:13] neither to the Jews, nor to the
[1:21:14] Gentiles, nor to the church of God, even
[1:21:16] as I please all men in all things, not
[1:21:18] seeking my own profit, but the profit of
[1:21:21] many, that they may be saved. Oh, now
[1:21:25] we're that's profitable.
[1:21:28] That's expedient to seek and save that
[1:21:31] which is lost. Not living for ourselves,
[1:21:33] but living for others. Not not coming
[1:21:36] under the power and control. A and if I
[1:21:38] can say it like this, you you have a
[1:21:40] nineto-5. That's your witnessing field.
[1:21:44] Your occupation I is is not a doctor, a
[1:21:48] masonary, uh uh you you know a a an
[1:21:52] architect, a tree cutter, a tile layer
[1:21:55] that your occupation is a believer.
[1:22:00] I mean
[1:22:02] Jesus was a carpenter. Oh my. But he had
[1:22:06] a much greater mission.
[1:22:09] and
[1:22:10] you, oh, you might be this or that, but
[1:22:13] you have a much greater mission. I must
[1:22:16] be about my father's business. So, as we
[1:22:19] approach the communion table, may we
[1:22:21] have confidence towards
[1:22:23] God, making our wrongs right,
[1:22:27] if we're doing things that are lawful,
[1:22:29] but it has power over
[1:22:30] us, let's let's repent. Let's if we're
[1:22:33] being if it's robbing us of our time and
[1:22:35] robbing us of our prayer
[1:22:38] life, we realize that we need to be
[1:22:40] correction and have some correction.
[1:22:42] Say, Lord, may I be given into things
[1:22:45] that are
[1:22:46] expedient, having the mind of Christ
[1:22:49] that we can say as as Paul just said
[1:22:52] here in verse
[1:22:55] 31, whatsoever ye do, do all to the
[1:22:59] glory of God. God bless you.
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:16] I love the scriptures, don't you? Amen.
[1:23:21] You know, I just
[1:23:23] uh I just feel such a
[1:23:27] u theme that's just been running through
[1:23:32] uh the services, you know, we've been
[1:23:34] we've placed it under a general theme of
[1:23:37] a a path forward, but of the brothers
[1:23:41] even that have come to minister, our
[1:23:43] brother this morning, brother Bill Ivy,
[1:23:46] of the different ones that have have
[1:23:48] spoken, it just seems like there's a
[1:23:51] call for a higher ground. You know what
[1:23:55] I mean? Look at that. uh just kind of a
[1:23:58] pull to to to move up and to uh to bring
[1:24:05] the the
[1:24:06] realities of the gospel and the
[1:24:10] testimonies that the Lord has set before
[1:24:14] us and the witness the the cloud of
[1:24:16] witness that's so strong around us to
[1:24:20] encourage us to understand that we can
[1:24:25] partake of the goodness of God. And you
[1:24:29] know, uh, God has grace and mercy and
[1:24:33] power to supply a more dedicated life to
[1:24:37] us if that's what we're hungering and
[1:24:40] thirsting for.
[1:24:42] So if if if you and uh we've heard
[1:24:46] wonderful examples, our brother said
[1:24:48] this morning about the apple. You've got
[1:24:50] to eat of the apple. Well, that's what
[1:24:53] God does. He gives you a taste through
[1:24:56] the word of God, through testimony and
[1:24:59] through Isaav. He He lets you get a
[1:25:03] glimpse into seeing there's more power
[1:25:06] of God. There's there's more God. I I
[1:25:09] can be free to from the sin that so
[1:25:13] easily but sets me. I can overcome the
[1:25:16] lust of my eyes and the lust of the
[1:25:19] flesh. I I can get deliverance from my
[1:25:22] temper. Right? I I can be free from my
[1:25:26] anxieties and my depressions and my
[1:25:29] fears and and the word of God is
[1:25:33] preached out to us through the
[1:25:35] scriptures that we might begin to have
[1:25:38] hope. And then he reveals to us that
[1:25:42] those things are possible in him. Yes.
[1:25:46] And like our brother preached this
[1:25:47] morning, he said, "You you've got to
[1:25:50] contact him because that's the only
[1:25:52] thing that endures. It's the only thing
[1:25:55] that lasts." And and I believe that the
[1:25:58] call I is is uh going out to us in in
[1:26:04] such a kind and gentle way to step up,
[1:26:08] you know, to move up because time's
[1:26:10] running out.
[1:26:14] you know, time's running out. Every
[1:26:16] everybody everybody uh
[1:26:20] uh the things that are going on. I know
[1:26:23] that, you know, we probably don't spend
[1:26:26] as much time in the news and in politics
[1:26:29] as as a lot of the people do and and so
[1:26:33] our world's sheltered. But there's some
[1:26:36] amazing things going on in the and the
[1:26:39] world and things that are moving towards
[1:26:43] the closing of churches and the and the
[1:26:46] uh shutting down of religious freedoms
[1:26:49] and the things that you can say and you
[1:26:53] you can't say and and they're they're
[1:26:56] starting to press in. And we've been
[1:26:58] told by a prophet that there come a
[1:27:00] squeeze.
[1:27:03] Amen. And he said there there'll come a
[1:27:04] time where they'll turn this in uh
[1:27:06] they'll try to turn your churches into a
[1:27:09] a just a storehouse. And and I thought,
[1:27:13] you know, we look at that in the natural
[1:27:16] and the carnal, but what happens if if
[1:27:19] if it it was actually was also like a
[1:27:23] spiritual condition
[1:27:26] we got in where we've just be we just
[1:27:29] throw up the word, right? We know it,
[1:27:32] but it's not taking us anywhere. And and
[1:27:35] I I I want to be lifted up, don't you? I
[1:27:39] want to be lifted up. And And we find
[1:27:43] out that and I I believe Brother Matthew
[1:27:45] just brought that out so beautifully.
[1:27:49] when when we get condemned
[1:27:52] uh and we get convicted and we get beat
[1:27:56] down and and then we lose our joy and
[1:28:00] and the prophet of God uh said something
[1:28:03] let in and I believe it's in the message
[1:28:06] of what do we plant and where do we
[1:28:09] plant it? It's a it's one of those
[1:28:12] messages that'll just slip you by. But
[1:28:14] if you listen to it, he says it's the
[1:28:17] lack of joy
[1:28:19] keeps us from growing.
[1:28:25] And he spends quite a bit of time about
[1:28:27] talking about the believer, how they've
[1:28:30] lost their joy of salvation, how they've
[1:28:32] lost the joy of their revelation, how
[1:28:35] they've lost the joy of hearing this
[1:28:38] message, how they've lost the joy of
[1:28:41] what it means to be elected. and what it
[1:28:44] means to be chosen. And they've lost
[1:28:47] their joy of
[1:28:49] changing, of of moving up, growing,
[1:28:53] maturing, uh being in the sun, uh having
[1:28:57] the virtue and life start to take hold.
[1:29:01] And and I thought as Matthew went
[1:29:03] through these uh beautiful scriptures to
[1:29:05] us, it it's just like a call. Get get
[1:29:09] these things in your life. Amen. where
[1:29:12] you're not tossed to and fro. Get these
[1:29:15] things in your life where you know where
[1:29:17] you stand. Get these things in your life
[1:29:19] where you're not questioning your
[1:29:22] experience. And if if you if you have
[1:29:24] things in your life that are pressing
[1:29:26] you, those are the things you want to
[1:29:28] talk over God with. Amen. Those are the
[1:29:32] things you want. You don't want to run
[1:29:34] and hide. Right. And and I always
[1:29:37] thought of uh what what I heard and I
[1:29:42] always thought about you know what if I
[1:29:44] would have went up in front of the
[1:29:47] messenger of the hour after everybody
[1:29:49] said oh I wish I could have went up in
[1:29:51] front of brother Brandham. I I I don't
[1:29:54] know
[1:29:54] if you know I mean you might say that
[1:29:58] but when you think about it nothing's
[1:30:00] hid then
[1:30:03] you know what I mean really what the the
[1:30:06] real secret of your heart and really
[1:30:10] what's in your heart would would would
[1:30:13] be exposed
[1:30:15] you know I mean and really what it is
[1:30:18] that that you
[1:30:21] desire he would he would have known that
[1:30:25] and and I think that if that's what
[1:30:27] really uh what it what the real desire
[1:30:31] of our our heart is is that we we we do
[1:30:35] want to come up to higher ground. And
[1:30:38] so, uh, he told the story, the messenger
[1:30:41] told the story about the the woman that
[1:30:44] went and bought the, uh,
[1:30:47] oil and, uh, the alabaster to anoint
[1:30:52] Jesus's feet. And he she when she got
[1:30:56] there, she looked out and she said, "If
[1:30:59] I go there and anoint his
[1:31:03] feet and wipe his feet with my tears, he
[1:31:08] will know where I got the
[1:31:15] money." And I thought,
[1:31:18] "Wow, that would have stopped me.
[1:31:23] he would know what I've been doing.
[1:31:26] But he she said but she knew he was the
[1:31:31] only one that could help her.
[1:31:38] Just think of
[1:31:40] that. And that's why she went down
[1:31:42] there. It didn't matter if he
[1:31:45] knew what she was doing. It didn't
[1:31:49] matter if she
[1:31:51] knew the problems that she had in her
[1:31:54] life. It didn't matter if she knew the
[1:31:59] failures, but she knew Lord He had the
[1:32:03] grace, the power, and the mercy to help
[1:32:07] her.
[1:32:10] And that's some of the higher ground
[1:32:13] that we've got to start pressing to.
[1:32:16] That's part of the higher ground that
[1:32:17] Matthew as we read through Corinthians,
[1:32:20] Paul was telling us,
[1:32:23] overcome. It's given to the
[1:32:25] overcomer. It's given to the overcomer.
[1:32:29] Let us press to be better Christians.
[1:32:32] Let us press to apply the token. Let us
[1:32:35] press to to to leave, as uh Matt, you
[1:32:39] said, those things that are lawful for
[1:32:42] us, but they're not helping us. Let us
[1:32:46] have the courage and the strength to
[1:32:49] bring our lives more and more and more
[1:32:52] into the example that we've had in our
[1:32:56] day. And as I can say for our messenger,
[1:33:01] as they said for theirs, Paul said, "Be
[1:33:03] ye followers of me as I am of Christ." I
[1:33:06] believe we have an example in our day
[1:33:09] that we can follow. So let us be
[1:33:12] encouraged. Let us be lifted up. And let
[1:33:14] us press for the higher calling, the
[1:33:18] mark of the higher calling. Let us leave
[1:33:21] those things which are behind behind and
[1:33:24] press for the mark of the higher
[1:33:26] calling. So go I just I just trust that
[1:33:31] you'll ask the Lord for
[1:33:34] Isa and reign them and ask God for those
[1:33:38] things. Lord, show me. And believe
[1:33:43] me, you say, "Well, I've sinned. I've
[1:33:46] done things wrong." He knew it when he
[1:33:48] went to
[1:33:50] Calvary. Amen. Well, we are yet a
[1:33:53] sinner. He died for us. So, let it and
[1:33:58] and I tell
[1:34:00] you, when you do something that's right
[1:34:03] and good, you will feel the joy That's
[1:34:07] right. of the Lord come around
[1:34:10] you. Amen. You'll feel good about
[1:34:14] yourself. You'll feel the joy. You'll
[1:34:16] you'll feel the happiness. You'll feel
[1:34:19] his hand. And you feel his touch. And
[1:34:22] and and he loves you.
[1:34:25] And I know he loves me because I would
[1:34:29] have given up on myself a long time
[1:34:32] ago. You know what I mean? I've I've
[1:34:35] done so many things wrong before the
[1:34:38] Lord that
[1:34:40] I you know I I I can't even explain
[1:34:45] why he stays with me and helps me and
[1:34:50] blesses me. There is
[1:34:54] no reason for it other than he's just
[1:34:58] got perfect divine love and he's not
[1:35:01] going to lose one of us. And so you say,
[1:35:06] "Well, I I've made mistakes." You know
[1:35:08] what? You got a choice of living under a
[1:35:12] mistake all your life or just going to
[1:35:15] the one that can help you with your
[1:35:17] mistake. Lord, I made a mistake. make my
[1:35:21] life go better from now. You've got
[1:35:24] involved in things you shouldn't be
[1:35:26] involved in. Don't let that rule your
[1:35:29] life. As Matthew said, don't don't be
[1:35:31] stuck under bondage all your life. Don't
[1:35:35] don't be ruled by those things when
[1:35:38] you've got an invitation. And that's
[1:35:41] what communion is. Communion's that
[1:35:45] invitation for you to come talk it over
[1:35:50] with
[1:35:51] him. It's an invitation for you to say,
[1:35:54] "Lord, I'm weak in this. I've searched
[1:35:57] my heart. I'm coming to you to lay this
[1:36:00] at your feet to get deliverance to to
[1:36:05] get healed because there's healing in
[1:36:09] communion and to get to to to I I'm here
[1:36:12] because I want to go up higher. I know
[1:36:15] it's real. I know this power is real. I
[1:36:18] know the ability to overcome is real. I
[1:36:22] know the ability to have power over the
[1:36:24] enemy is real. Uh, I know the ability to
[1:36:27] bring my flesh into subjection is real.
[1:36:30] I know it's real because I've heard it
[1:36:33] and your spirits bore witness of it to
[1:36:36] my spirit. Now, I want that to be a
[1:36:39] reality in my life. And and for
[1:36:43] communion
[1:36:44] tonight, that's what our desire is. that
[1:36:48] that this life that the prophet of God
[1:36:53] presented because he wanted to restore
[1:36:55] the faith back to the church, this
[1:36:59] restoration of faith that's coming back
[1:37:03] to the church, a restoration of love and
[1:37:06] dedication that we can be partakers of
[1:37:12] that through the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:14] Christ. And that's what our desire is.
[1:37:17] So don't condemn yourself. Look up your
[1:37:20] redemption's nigh. Don't Don't rule
[1:37:24] yourself
[1:37:26] unworthy. Rule that he has grace and
[1:37:30] mercy to receive you. And let us just
[1:37:34] step farther up into the things of the
[1:37:38] Lord. Let us turn in our Bibles if we
[1:37:42] would over to uh uh 1 Corinthians
[1:37:48] uh the 11th chapter and the
[1:37:53] uh 23rd verse. And I thought of brother
[1:37:57] Raphael this morning. He said, "Well, I
[1:38:00] just kept putting my glasses down and I
[1:38:02] can read." And and I thought, "Well, I
[1:38:04] can read it without my glasses, too."
[1:38:07] Amen. I can do that now. But it does
[1:38:10] make it
[1:38:14] easier. So, uh, that's good. I I
[1:38:19] remember a fella was he told me he said
[1:38:22] that uh he he grew up in Pentecost and
[1:38:26] he said he he was at a meeting one time.
[1:38:28] He said brother Ram pulled out his
[1:38:30] glasses. He said he gave him a
[1:38:33] deliverance like he never had, you know,
[1:38:37] and so
[1:38:39] uh but uh but anyway, so but I can read
[1:38:45] it without it. So I want to join in your
[1:38:47] testimony.
[1:38:49] Amen. But by 75 years makes this a
[1:38:52] little bit
[1:38:54] easier. Oh, I'm happy. Aren't you?
[1:38:57] I'm telling you, think of what the
[1:38:59] prophet said. You can't grow without
[1:39:02] joy. That's right.
[1:39:04] Amen. I want to grow. For I have
[1:39:07] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:39:10] delivered unto
[1:39:12] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:39:16] in which he was betrayed, took
[1:39:19] bread. And when he had given thanks, he
[1:39:23] broke it and said, "Take eat. For this
[1:39:27] is my body which is broken for you. This
[1:39:31] do in remembrance of
[1:39:34] me. For after the same manner also he
[1:39:38] took the cup when he had sucked, saying,
[1:39:42] "This cup is the new testament in my
[1:39:46] blood. This do ye as often as ye drink
[1:39:50] it in remembrance of me. For as often as
[1:39:54] ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye
[1:39:59] do show the Lord's death till he
[1:40:03] comes. Wherefore, whosoever shall eateth
[1:40:07] this bread and drinkkeeth this cup of
[1:40:10] the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of
[1:40:14] the body and blood of the Lord.
[1:40:17] But let a man examine
[1:40:20] himself, and so let him eat of that
[1:40:23] bread, and drink of that
[1:40:27] cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:40:30] unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:40:32] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[1:40:35] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[1:40:38] weak and sickly among you, and many
[1:40:41] sleep. For if we would judge ourselves,
[1:40:45] we should not be
[1:40:47] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:40:51] chasened of the Lord, that we should not
[1:40:55] be condemned with the world. Wherefore,
[1:40:59] my brethren, when you come together to
[1:41:01] eat, carry one for another, and if any
[1:41:05] man hunger, let him eat at home. For you
[1:41:09] come not together unto condemnation and
[1:41:12] the rest will I set in order when I
[1:41:15] come. It isn't that wonderful. This is a
[1:41:18] time uh God bless you. The brothers will
[1:41:21] come. You may be seated.
[1:41:26] This is a time that you can sit there
[1:41:29] and you can judge
[1:41:31] yourself and if there's something in
[1:41:33] your
[1:41:34] life,
[1:41:36] purpose to surrender that to the
[1:41:41] Lord. Remember our messenger said, he
[1:41:44] said, "Don't try to figure it out. Don't
[1:41:47] try to f find your way back. Just
[1:41:51] surrender and he'll lead you back. So
[1:41:54] communion tonight is for you to
[1:41:57] surrender. I don't know if there would
[1:41:59] be anybody streaming at home tonight
[1:42:04] that uh would stream and not want to be
[1:42:08] here, but but uh purpose in your heart
[1:42:12] that the next time there's a communion
[1:42:15] that you'll be here. Let us
[1:42:17] all bow
[1:42:19] together as we pray. Our gracious
[1:42:23] heavenly father, the bread of
[1:42:28] life, you are that bread which came down
[1:42:32] from heaven. Father, and we take this
[1:42:35] communion to
[1:42:37] remember that the sin that kept us from
[1:42:42] you, that you paid the price for that.
[1:42:46] that you could be with us and even in us
[1:42:49] till the
[1:42:50] end. And we partake of this
[1:42:53] bread knowing that your spirit is life
[1:42:58] and your words are
[1:43:00] truth. And Father, we can eat the words
[1:43:03] of your
[1:43:04] gospel into our life and they'll produce
[1:43:08] life and life more abundant.
[1:43:12] We take this broken bread, Father, in
[1:43:15] remembrance of your price that you paid,
[1:43:19] the love that you had for
[1:43:22] us, and we ask you to bless it to us.
[1:43:25] And Father, the wine that you said
[1:43:27] represents the
[1:43:29] blood that was shed on our
[1:43:33] behalf, that the life and the spirit
[1:43:35] that was in that blood could come and
[1:43:38] dwell in the believer. Father, we do
[1:43:41] these
[1:43:43] things in in
[1:43:46] remembrance that you commanded us to do
[1:43:49] this when we came together.
[1:43:52] Father, tonight we've assembled here to
[1:43:54] partake of
[1:43:56] communion, to commune with
[1:43:58] you, to remember your mercies and your
[1:44:02] kindness towards us, to remember the
[1:44:05] power that you have to change and
[1:44:09] forgive and
[1:44:12] deliver. Father,
[1:44:14] you're have
[1:44:18] overcome. And by that overcoming power,
[1:44:21] Father, we believe that we can
[1:44:24] overcome. Father, each of us this
[1:44:27] evening has certainly things in our life
[1:44:30] that we need to do
[1:44:33] better. Certainly, we have things in our
[1:44:36] life
[1:44:37] that so easily besets
[1:44:41] us. Many of us are ashamed of some of
[1:44:44] the
[1:44:45] weaknesses that we have.
[1:44:49] But Father, we come to you
[1:44:52] because there's no other place we can go
[1:44:56] for you alone have the words of eternal
[1:44:59] life. And Lord, we're trusting this
[1:45:02] evening as we examine
[1:45:05] ourselves. We don't come to eat, Father,
[1:45:09] because there's no fault in us.
[1:45:12] We come to eat because we believe that
[1:45:15] you've got power to overcome our faults
[1:45:19] and that through you we can be an
[1:45:23] overcomer. I ask you to bless each
[1:45:26] heart father and as our word was
[1:45:30] ministered to us
[1:45:32] tonight that the
[1:45:35] judgments and our judgments would be
[1:45:37] pure.
[1:45:40] Father, that we hold no malice or no
[1:45:44] envy or no strife to any
[1:45:48] believer. Father, we wouldn't judge
[1:45:50] people by the way that they worship, but
[1:45:53] by the spirit within their heart.
[1:45:57] Father, help us rise up to be the kind
[1:46:00] of Christians that we should be.
[1:46:03] We take communion tonight with those
[1:46:06] hopes, Father, with those desires that
[1:46:10] through your grace, we can be an
[1:46:12] overcomer and rise to higher heights. We
[1:46:16] ask you to bless this bread and wine
[1:46:18] now. Bless the receiver, Father. May
[1:46:22] they receive the healing of their
[1:46:23] spirits, their
[1:46:25] bodies, and their souls. In Jesus
[1:46:29] precious and wonderful name we pray.
[1:46:32] Amen. Musicians, God bless you.
[1:47:17] each side. Go to the the aisle and then
[1:47:20] go back to your aisle on your side. God
[1:47:22] bless you. You may come to communion as
[1:47:24] you feel led.

[1:57:47] I have a
[1:57:51] longing in my

[1:57:56] for him. Can you sing it with

[1:58:10] longing for Jesus.
[1:58:16] I have a

[1:58:29] me. Just feel
[1:58:32] [Music]
[1:58:37] his feel.
[1:58:42] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:58:44] I am
[1:58:46] the
[1:58:47] lonely in my
[1:58:52] [Music]
[1:58:55] heart. Let us stand
[1:58:58] and turn in our Bibles to the Gospel of
[1:59:02] St. John the
[1:59:05] 13th chapter.
[1:59:21] And now before the feast of the
[1:59:24] Passover, when Jesus knew that his
[1:59:28] hour was come, that he should depart out
[1:59:33] of this world unto the Father, having
[1:59:38] loved his own which were in the world.
[1:59:42] He loved them until the
[1:59:45] end. And
[1:59:47] supper being ended, the devil having now
[1:59:52] put it into the heart of Judas's
[1:59:55] Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him.
[1:59:59] Jesus knowing that the Father had given
[2:00:03] all things unto his hands and that he
[2:00:08] was come from God and went to God. He
[2:00:12] raveth from
[2:00:14] supper and laid aside his garment and
[2:00:18] took a towel and gertth himself.
[2:00:22] And after that he pou water into a basin
[2:00:26] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[2:00:30] to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[2:00:34] was
[2:00:35] girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter.
[2:00:39] And Peter said unto him, Lord, dust thou
[2:00:43] wash my feet? And Jesus answered and
[2:00:47] said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest
[2:00:51] not now, but thou shalt know
[2:00:55] hereafter." Peter said unto him, "Thou
[2:00:58] shalt never wash my feet." Jesus
[2:01:03] answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou
[2:01:07] hast no part with me."
[2:01:10] Simon Peter said unto him,"Lord, not my
[2:01:13] feet only, but also my hands and my
[2:01:17] head." Jesus said to him, "He that is
[2:01:21] washed needeth not saved to wash his
[2:01:24] feet, but is clean every wit, and ye are
[2:01:28] clean, but not all. For he knew who
[2:01:32] should betray him. Therefore said he, Ye
[2:01:36] are not all clean." So after he had
[2:01:40] washed their feet, and had taken his
[2:01:43] garments, and was set down again, he
[2:01:47] said unto them, "Know ye what I have
[2:01:51] done to
[2:01:52] you? Ye call me master and lord, and ye
[2:01:57] say well, for so I am."
[2:02:00] If I then, your Lord and Master, have
[2:02:04] washed your feet, ye also ought to wash
[2:02:09] one another's feet. For I have given you
[2:02:13] an example that ye should do as I have
[2:02:17] done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto
[2:02:21] you, the servant is not greater than his
[2:02:25] Lord, neither he that is sent greater
[2:02:29] than he that sent him. If you know these
[2:02:33] things, happy are ye if you do them.
[2:02:38] Amen. Aren't you happy to wash one
[2:02:40] another's feet? God bless you, sisters,
[2:02:42] to your place, brothers. God bless you.
