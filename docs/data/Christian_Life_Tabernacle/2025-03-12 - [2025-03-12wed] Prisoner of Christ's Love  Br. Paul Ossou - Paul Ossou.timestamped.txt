[51:13] Rejoice or to say something so you can
[51:16] show that you know you have
[51:22] knowledge but most times the things that
[51:24] God places upon your heart
[51:29] or things that you yourself are going
[51:35] through and often times I know I don't
[51:38] like to talk about
[51:42] myself because I don't find it
[51:48] important but what the Lord placed on my
[51:51] heart
[51:55] tonight it's something that the Lord is
[51:57] dealing with my own
[52:04] heart experience and I believe it could
[52:06] be uh useful or helpful for someone
[52:09] who's also going through the same
[52:16] experience I was listening to a sermon
[52:19] that preached a prisoner
[52:22] [Music]
[52:27] and I believe it's the one preached uh
[52:29] uh uh July 17 1963
[52:37] prisoner I even wanted to just play the
[52:40] tape so we can listen to brother
[52:46] [Music]
[52:47] Bram so certainly tonight I'll try to
[52:50] read some uh uh passage in this message
[52:53] uh as we go along
[53:01] you know the Lord will lead you in
[53:02] things that you you yourself you don't
[53:07] know you know it's been about five
[53:10] [Music]
[53:12] years that my family has been
[53:16] here and for the first three
[53:20] years I was not here most of the time
[53:26] was mostly in Africa and I would come
[53:28] every once in a
[53:30] [Music]
[53:33] while because the Lord had given me
[53:43] favor that in the social uh things I I I
[53:47] was able to get to a certain level uh
[53:51] accept a good level if I could say that
[53:55] [Music]
[53:58] like in my country in
[54:01] Congo until
[54:06] now I was the only one with the highest
[54:09] level uh um of Education in my in what I
[54:19] [Music]
[54:20] do so in if you speak about neurology as
[54:24] far as Congo is concerned if there has
[54:27] to be any references it's going to be me
[54:29] the Prof the
[54:31] professor and when I came
[54:36] here it was very difficult to try to
[54:39] make things
[54:48] work they asked they had asked for me uh
[54:52] to send the document so it could be
[54:54] validated and sent back so I can take
[54:57] the test and and and so they can
[55:01] compare they send the document to Congo
[55:04] Congo refused to to
[55:06] respond so which means I couldn't I
[55:09] can't do the
[55:12] test and then some days I prayed and I
[55:14] asked I said Lord why did you bring me
[55:17] here why
[55:21] why and one day as I was praying like
[55:25] that a voice spoke to
[55:29] me and I the voice said to me do you
[55:32] think you lost more than
[55:37] Moses Moses who had the Throne of
[55:43] Egypt who could have been the the the
[55:46] like the king of the
[55:49] Earth but who found him he found he find
[55:53] himself in the desert
[55:58] behind some sheeps that belong to his uh
[56:00] uh uh
[56:05] father-in-law so you didn't lose more
[56:08] than Moses
[56:10] did and the most important thing for
[56:14] you it's not your
[56:18] Ambitions it's the it's the will of
[56:21] God then tonight
[56:25] [Music]
[56:27] I'm going to speak about uh my title is
[56:30] prisoners of uh the love of Christ of
[56:33] Christ love
[56:35] yes a prisoner of of the love of
[56:41] Christ you know as Adam and
[56:45] Eve uh in our
[56:48] lives God God gives us choices he lets
[56:51] us make
[56:53] choices he elected us before the
[56:56] foundation of the world he he loved
[56:59] us but he he lets us make
[57:03] choices before different
[57:07] circumstances we have to
[57:10] choose we have to make a
[57:13] decision and we have to go
[57:17] forward and in those
[57:22] decisions and we have to know which is
[57:25] the best decision
[57:27] which is the best
[57:31] decision and when we come to the house
[57:33] of
[57:35] God is so that the Lord may speak to
[57:39] us that the Lord May guide
[57:43] us may the Lord show us his perfect
[57:48] will and I believe everyone of you will
[57:50] pray for
[57:54] me because all I need right
[58:01] now is so is what God wants me to do and
[58:04] what God wants me to
[58:06] be not what I want to
[58:09] be not what I wanted to be but what he
[58:16] wants and brother Bram will
[58:25] say PR like I said I'll read some
[58:27] portions in this message of prisoner
[58:29] that really comforted me and that really
[58:32] spoke to
[58:35] me parag paragraph 47 brother Bram
[58:42] says now we are all born a free moral
[58:47] agent to make any decision we would we
[58:51] wished
[58:52] [Music]
[58:54] to God just justly does
[59:01] that because he must put every man on
[59:04] the same
[59:06] [Music]
[59:13] basis or put the wrong man he put the
[59:16] first man on the wrong basis he put on
[59:19] free moral agency
[59:26] we are just exactly tonight like Adam
[59:29] and
[59:31] Eve there's no
[59:34] [Music]
[59:36] difference right and wrong sets
[59:39] before either of
[59:44] us life and
[59:47] death we can make our
[59:50] choice it's up to you to make it
[59:54] see it's for us has to make
[1:00:01] it that's the way Adam and Eve
[1:00:05] did and see they made the wrong
[1:00:14] choice and it says by that put the whole
[1:00:19] race a human race under death the
[1:00:21] penalty of death
[1:00:28] and God came down in the form of man and
[1:00:31] took that
[1:00:33] death and PID the penalty of
[1:00:38] [Music]
[1:00:41] death that the his subject that desired
[1:00:45] to be free could go
[1:00:50] free so Adam and Eve led us to death
[1:00:56] before the freem moral agency that they
[1:00:59] had but
[1:01:01] God he came
[1:01:04] down so he can pay for the penalty of
[1:01:09] death so that those that have the
[1:01:13] desire those that will
[1:01:15] choose those that
[1:01:18] want those that make a
[1:01:20] decision to be
[1:01:22] free could go free
[1:01:26] he already paid the
[1:01:27] price he already paid the
[1:01:32] penalty but it's for each one of us to
[1:01:35] accept the penalty that was
[1:01:38] paid and each one is free or or or free
[1:01:42] to accept that penalty or to reject
[1:01:52] it now if he if he took us without the
[1:01:56] same way that he did Adam and
[1:02:01] Eve just pull us through something and
[1:02:04] said I'll save
[1:02:07] you whether you want you want save or
[1:02:12] not then he put Adam and Eve on the
[1:02:15] wrong basis you
[1:02:22] see but each one of us
[1:02:26] has to choose this day between death and
[1:02:30] life we can do
[1:02:34] it and as I just
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:44] expressed if your light will prove your
[1:02:47] life will prove exactly what side you
[1:02:50] are
[1:02:52] on I don't care what side you say you
[1:02:55] are on
[1:02:58] what you do every
[1:03:01] day proves what you
[1:03:04] are you've heard this old
[1:03:09] saying your life is so loud I can't hear
[1:03:12] your
[1:03:16] testimony your action is so
[1:03:20] loud it says I've always believed in
[1:03:22] shouting and jumping
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:31] but I've always said don't jump higher
[1:03:33] than you
[1:03:36] live because the world is going to watch
[1:03:39] that
[1:03:43] see you must you must you must just jump
[1:03:47] as high as you
[1:03:49] live so
[1:03:52] because because somebody is watching you
[1:03:58] and that
[1:04:00] life is
[1:04:04] free it's by choice we make that by the
[1:04:07] choice we
[1:04:08] make that we walk in our
[1:04:12] life it's not the
[1:04:15] forcing it's not something that somebody
[1:04:18] is imposing upon
[1:04:22] you that's why I spoke about the
[1:04:24] prisoner of love
[1:04:28] love because when we speak about a
[1:04:32] prisoner it's somebody who lost the
[1:04:36] freedom it's someone who can do
[1:04:41] nothing and when we are prisoners of
[1:04:47] Christ it's not the same as you are
[1:04:50] prisoner of a
[1:04:52] man or prisoner of a system
[1:04:59] but today when we look at our
[1:05:03] Lives Many Times many of us will find
[1:05:07] out that you are prisoner of
[1:05:12] something today in the
[1:05:16] world we have many people that are
[1:05:19] prisoners of social
[1:05:21] media pris telephone prisoners of uh
[1:05:28] phones maybe you are crossing some
[1:05:30] dangerous
[1:05:37] areas there's people that are prisoners
[1:05:39] of the
[1:05:42] fashion prisoners of
[1:05:48] Television but what we need tonight
[1:05:55] not of whom or or or what are you
[1:05:58] prisoner
[1:06:03] of and the one who wants us to be his
[1:06:07] prisoner he said that in
[1:06:11] Matthew that if you are
[1:06:16] burdened if you are prisoner of
[1:06:20] something if you are
[1:06:22] tired F if you are loaded
[1:06:27] come unto
[1:06:30] me he said when you come to
[1:06:33] me he's going to give you a
[1:06:40] yoke you you have to
[1:06:44] sorry you have to leave a a
[1:06:47] yoke so you can come to another
[1:06:50] yoke but the Yoke that he is giving
[1:06:54] you is
[1:06:56] light is
[1:06:58] light it's filled with
[1:07:01] love it's filled with good
[1:07:07] things he's filled with the goodness of
[1:07:10] of divine
[1:07:12] goodness every all that he's asking
[1:07:15] you is
[1:07:18] today I realized that I was Prisoner of
[1:07:24] something I have this burden that I
[1:07:26] cannot get rid
[1:07:29] of that I have this thing that's
[1:07:31] Weighing on
[1:07:33] me but look at he's calling
[1:07:37] me ye that are
[1:07:39] tired ye that are heavy laden come unto
[1:07:44] me I will give you
[1:07:48] rest he's not just giving you the rest
[1:07:52] for your
[1:07:53] body but he's giving you the rest for
[1:07:55] your soul
[1:07:59] also you become a
[1:08:02] prisoner but a prisoner who's
[1:08:05] resting a prisoner who's
[1:08:08] free because he
[1:08:10] said that the spirit of truth will make
[1:08:14] you
[1:08:16] free when you become his
[1:08:19] prisoner he fills you with his holy
[1:08:23] spirit you only follow follow his
[1:08:27] will but you are the most free person
[1:08:30] there is on the
[1:08:32] planet prisoner of the love of
[1:08:35] Christ is the most free person there is
[1:08:38] on
[1:08:42] Earth because all that he
[1:08:45] does he's committing
[1:08:47] himself he commit
[1:08:51] himself he's at rest
[1:08:55] he follows the the will of the
[1:08:59] master and Paul is
[1:09:04] speaking and when when writing to
[1:09:12] filon we saw that some of the epistle
[1:09:14] that Paul was
[1:09:15] writing it was say Paul Apostle of Jesus
[1:09:19] Christ Paul Servants of Jesus
[1:09:22] Christ not according to the will of man
[1:09:26] but according to the will of God but
[1:09:28] then it comes to filon he says Paul a
[1:09:33] prison of Jesus
[1:09:36] Christ yes's
[1:09:40] Paul this young man who was filled with
[1:09:46] ambitions taught by
[1:09:49] Gia fill withal
[1:09:56] I'm sure he told himself that he was
[1:09:57] going to be among the the the the
[1:09:59] highest priest that there was the most
[1:10:01] educated
[1:10:03] ones that he was going to be the the
[1:10:05] even the high
[1:10:07] priest he was full of ambition full of
[1:10:12] zeal it was well studied in the
[1:10:15] scriptures well
[1:10:20] taught he he couldn't let somebody come
[1:10:23] and break the scriptures
[1:10:27] to where when he saw a bunch of people
[1:10:29] following
[1:10:31] Jesus with a with a uh um U St Steven
[1:10:38] yeah he he participated to his
[1:10:43] death because for
[1:10:47] him it consider them it was people that
[1:10:51] were bringing a bad name upon the word
[1:10:56] on the religion that he
[1:10:59] believed he was a great
[1:11:05] preacher and in his
[1:11:08] Zeal he takes letters and on his way to
[1:11:13] Damascus he says I'm going to go to
[1:11:18] Damascus everywhere I hear about this
[1:11:21] doctrine of these
[1:11:22] people I'm going to go fight them
[1:11:26] and here he is on the way to
[1:11:29] Damascus this young man filled with
[1:11:32] ambition and on the way to
[1:11:35] Damascus something
[1:11:39] changes he sees a light just hit
[1:11:44] him and when the light hit
[1:11:47] him he
[1:11:50] falls and he hears a
[1:11:53] voice Saul
[1:11:56] Soul why persecute
[1:12:03] me he knew when when it was a light he
[1:12:07] knew that the light was
[1:12:12] speaking he knew that there was nothing
[1:12:14] else that could do that except
[1:12:19] God and as one who knew the
[1:12:23] scriptures he knew that the same
[1:12:28] light was the same light that led the
[1:12:30] children of Israel in the
[1:12:33] wilderness and then when that
[1:12:37] light was was the light that I'm of the
[1:12:39] god that I'm
[1:12:42] serving and this light Knows My
[1:12:47] Name he called me by my
[1:12:51] name why persecute thou me
[1:12:56] who are you
[1:13:00] Lord he could have
[1:13:02] said but Lord I'm at your
[1:13:06] work I'm I'm serving
[1:13:09] you I'm actually going to fulfill your
[1:13:16] work It said who are
[1:13:19] you it says I'm
[1:13:23] Jesus and it's going to be
[1:13:26] hard to kick against the
[1:13:32] prick yes is this young man filled with
[1:13:38] ambition who was in a
[1:13:42] career who had an
[1:13:45] experience that changed his life
[1:13:51] completely he that takes all his
[1:13:54] ambition
[1:13:56] all his
[1:13:58] careers and he puts it in
[1:14:02] Brackets it said go to ananas
[1:14:06] ananas here's the new career that's
[1:14:11] starting here's what I want for
[1:14:14] you a
[1:14:17] prisoner
[1:14:20] says uh paragraph 69
[1:14:26] and Paul had been a great scholar in his
[1:14:29] days he had great
[1:14:34] Ambitions he was a man that had been
[1:14:36] trained with by people by fellow by name
[1:14:39] of
[1:14:41] Gia which was a great teacher in his
[1:14:44] day one of the greatest schools that he
[1:14:47] had been that that he could have been
[1:14:49] went to
[1:14:55] like we say Whit or Bob
[1:14:58] Jones or some great fundamental
[1:15:04] schools he had been taught as a minister
[1:15:06] of the
[1:15:07] word he was well educated and
[1:15:11] smart an intelligent
[1:15:20] Bo with a great ambition of maybe
[1:15:23] someday becoming a a priest or high
[1:15:26] priest of his
[1:15:27] people he had an
[1:15:33] ambition then find that this great
[1:15:36] ambition that he had been trained
[1:15:39] for and spent all his
[1:15:43] life maybe uh maybe the age of about
[1:15:47] eight and or
[1:15:49] 10 up to 35 30 or
[1:15:53] 35 when had finished college and
[1:15:57] graduated he had all this diplomas and
[1:16:01] everything and stood in good and stood
[1:16:04] in good uh with well the with with all
[1:16:07] the
[1:16:10] clergies high priest at
[1:16:16] Jerusalem he had orders by him personal
[1:16:19] ers
[1:16:26] written usted with this great soul to go
[1:16:29] down to
[1:16:36] Damascus and find those and find those
[1:16:40] down there that that worship the god
[1:16:42] contrary to that was
[1:16:45] said and to B them and put them in jail
[1:16:59] if necessary he had also to put them to
[1:17:02] death if he wanted
[1:17:04] to he had great
[1:17:07] Ambitions and then and
[1:17:14] now all that he had that he had trained
[1:17:17] for God had took
[1:17:20] all out of him
[1:17:23] see and what and what his objective
[1:17:28] was and what his father has spent his
[1:17:31] money
[1:17:32] for and the ambition of his father and
[1:17:40] mother was all was all had taken away
[1:17:45] from him because God had something
[1:17:49] else therefore he was a prisoner
[1:17:55] that he had in in
[1:17:58] life he had become a prisoner to Jesus
[1:18:01] Christ who was the
[1:18:06] word and God is dealing with each one of
[1:18:11] us to show
[1:18:14] us that when we have
[1:18:16] Ambitions that when we have a
[1:18:20] trajectory if our
[1:18:22] ambition and our trajectory
[1:18:26] is the same way as the
[1:18:28] word the same the same uh uh way as the
[1:18:32] word of God or the will of
[1:18:35] God it's
[1:18:39] good sometimes our
[1:18:41] Ambitions are not contrary to the
[1:18:44] word it's something
[1:18:46] good but sometimes God will decide but
[1:18:52] now I don't want to see you here anymore
[1:18:55] I don't want to see you over
[1:19:00] there it's nothing wrong that you're
[1:19:03] doing but God
[1:19:05] decides in his goodness Divine goodness
[1:19:08] in his
[1:19:09] grace
[1:19:11] now here's where I want you to
[1:19:14] be here's the way that I want you to
[1:19:18] take and when we are
[1:19:21] prisoners we don't have questions to ask
[1:19:25] we cannot ask
[1:19:27] him but what I do here there's nothing
[1:19:30] wrong with it why are you taking
[1:19:34] me in in another situation that's a lot
[1:19:37] more
[1:19:39] difficult those condition may look
[1:19:42] harder to your
[1:19:43] eyes but he knows the end before the
[1:19:48] beginning he knows what he's taking you
[1:19:52] through look he look he show
[1:19:55] Joseph that there was 11
[1:19:58] stars there was a moon and there was a
[1:20:01] sun that was worshiping
[1:20:04] him Joseph had that
[1:20:06] dream he was waiting maybe one day that
[1:20:10] he was going to be a great
[1:20:12] king but before Joseph could get to
[1:20:15] where he was he didn't
[1:20:18] know that he was going to find himself
[1:20:21] in a in a uh uh in a ditch
[1:20:25] that was he was going to be a slave that
[1:20:27] he had to be in
[1:20:29] prison all of those things he didn't
[1:20:33] know but as long as it was God guiding
[1:20:39] him you you may not even have committed
[1:20:42] any
[1:20:43] crime and by conclusion by
[1:20:47] confusion they accuse you and they take
[1:20:50] you to
[1:20:52] jail maybe just because there's a soul
[1:20:54] in
[1:20:55] prison that God wants you so you can go
[1:20:58] witness to that Soul so you can save him
[1:21:02] and then he will get you
[1:21:03] out and then after that you'll
[1:21:06] say oh he was
[1:21:14] innocent it's a god of
[1:21:20] paradox he does things that we don't
[1:21:22] understand
[1:21:28] sometimes as
[1:21:29] prisoners on our
[1:21:32] way we are objects of mockery
[1:21:37] sometimes they looked at us without
[1:21:40] value oh look at him he
[1:21:43] was oh now he's asso associating himself
[1:21:47] with he becomes now his
[1:21:55] and
[1:21:56] says it says regardless of the
[1:22:00] mockery in the message uh
[1:22:06] um where is
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:14] it yeah impersonation of
[1:22:19] Christianity paragraph
[1:22:22] 138 he says
[1:22:25] even if they're
[1:22:32] mockers paragraph 138 but if the main
[1:22:35] spring is doing take is
[1:22:41] ticking if it's controlling every
[1:22:46] emotion then the Yoke becomes
[1:22:53] easy they can say you know
[1:22:57] what there she was there she
[1:23:01] goes she used to be a
[1:23:04] doll but but look look at her
[1:23:08] now her hair is straight
[1:23:11] back her makeup is
[1:23:15] gone she wear these uh uh modest
[1:23:21] looking I don't mean to be now like
[1:23:24] something thing coming out of the
[1:23:26] [Music]
[1:23:30] Ark I but I mean this this that you
[1:23:34] should dress
[1:23:38] decently why she used to be uh the
[1:23:40] cutest little
[1:23:46] thing we'll see her laying out in the
[1:23:50] yard with a short on taking a sunbath
[1:23:54] but she don't do it
[1:23:56] anymore something
[1:24:01] happened the main spring has got in the
[1:24:05] place where it ought to
[1:24:08] be that's right
[1:24:12] oh he used to come down
[1:24:16] and he was a p
[1:24:19] shark he he could play card he could
[1:24:22] play cards
[1:24:24] he had of
[1:24:28] these and he could direct the chip uh
[1:24:31] from
[1:24:32] here and so
[1:24:34] forth he was but he don't do it no
[1:24:37] more the main
[1:24:40] spring oh he's a roll he's a Holy
[1:24:44] Roller but the yoke is
[1:24:49] easy because we are prisoners of his
[1:24:52] love
[1:24:54] we are contemplating his
[1:24:57] love we are beneficiary of his
[1:25:01] love but the yoke is
[1:25:05] easy you know what you do with
[1:25:09] it you just like to Bear
[1:25:13] it it's just like
[1:25:16] Samson when he took the Brazen gate of G
[1:25:21] Gaza the big gate brass gate
[1:25:26] he just picked it up on his
[1:25:28] shoulder and and bore it away right
[1:25:31] that's
[1:25:33] right when the yoke is in line with the
[1:25:37] joy and peace and sweetness of Christ in
[1:25:41] your heart in your
[1:25:46] heart then you just pick up all the
[1:25:49] burdens of the world
[1:25:55] the World cast on you and Buri them on a
[1:25:57] certain Hill called
[1:26:00] Calvary and there you kneel
[1:26:04] down and pray for that for that one that
[1:26:07] was persecuting
[1:26:09] you not not rain fire out of
[1:26:14] heaven and tear up the
[1:26:17] church but you bring peace to them God
[1:26:22] be merciful to them
[1:26:28] they mocking
[1:26:29] you but because of the love of
[1:26:32] Christ this yoke is
[1:26:35] easy is is is
[1:26:38] peace is filled with love is filled with
[1:26:44] joy and when they are mocking
[1:26:47] you and when they are persecuting
[1:26:50] you I love what brother says here
[1:26:55] in go back to the message
[1:26:57] prisoner paragraph
[1:27:02] 75
[1:27:07] says and another little quotation we
[1:27:10] might drop
[1:27:11] here you
[1:27:14] see as they make fun of the
[1:27:18] church you are the
[1:27:20] church the church is not this building
[1:27:25] when it says and they make fun of the
[1:27:28] church they are really they are not
[1:27:31] really making fun of the church they are
[1:27:33] making fun of
[1:27:36] Jesus why persecute thou
[1:27:40] me that's how we said to
[1:27:43] Paul Paul was persecuting the church
[1:27:57] how could Paul then with all his
[1:28:00] intellect believe that this was this
[1:28:03] this group that he was persecuting was
[1:28:05] the very God that he claimed to be
[1:28:09] serving when you are prison of
[1:28:12] Christ when you are in the love of
[1:28:15] Christ when somebody is mocking you or
[1:28:17] Mak of you when somebody's persecuting
[1:28:20] you he's persecuting Jesus Christ
[1:28:25] is mocking Jesus
[1:28:29] Christ and say
[1:28:32] somewhere he said that like it's saying
[1:28:34] in the
[1:28:39] beatitude happy is he that is uh
[1:28:42] persecuted because of
[1:28:45] me says that
[1:28:49] means that every time somebody persecute
[1:28:52] you
[1:28:54] he's bringing is's calling the blessing
[1:28:57] of God upon
[1:29:00] you because he says
[1:29:03] Happy happy is he that is persecuted
[1:29:06] because
[1:29:07] of every time somebody is persecuting
[1:29:10] you because of
[1:29:12] Jesus he's attracting the blessing of
[1:29:15] Jesus Christ upon
[1:29:17] you so when we are prison prisoners of
[1:29:21] Christ prisoners of his will
[1:29:24] regardless of what the world is
[1:29:28] saying we are subject and and we are
[1:29:31] exposed to that
[1:29:37] blessing I'm just going to try to read
[1:29:39] some more before I
[1:29:43] finish
[1:29:49] says paragraph 94
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:56] oh
[1:29:58] God make us prisoners like
[1:30:04] that from our own selfish
[1:30:07] ambition and from our own
[1:30:11] judgments a better way of
[1:30:15] thinking to be a prisoner of Jesus
[1:30:20] Christ I think that was a great
[1:30:23] statement
[1:30:25] that I'm that I'm a prisoner of Jesus
[1:30:28] Christ and remember he is the word
[1:30:35] see no matter what anyone else
[1:30:39] thinks it's the word it's the word
[1:30:45] see if you are prisoner to the
[1:30:49] word no denomination can sway you from
[1:30:53] it
[1:30:54] it's the word you it's the
[1:30:58] word you
[1:31:00] just you are a prisoner to it that's
[1:31:06] all you must act the way it
[1:31:17] acts now he could not go certain places
[1:31:20] that he wanted because why the spirit
[1:31:23] forbid
[1:31:25] him you you want to go but the spirit
[1:31:28] tells you don't go
[1:31:31] there
[1:31:35] prisoner you want to do something the
[1:31:38] spirit
[1:31:39] says not
[1:31:59] you remember many times that Paul was
[1:32:02] trying to go someplace thinking uh
[1:32:05] there's where I could I could have a
[1:32:07] great meeting but the spirit would
[1:32:09] forbid
[1:32:14] him now does that clearly State and
[1:32:17] prove that Paul was a
[1:32:21] prisoner prisoner a prisoner of Jesus
[1:32:25] Christ harnessed to his word by the
[1:32:29] spirit oh I like that
[1:32:33] yes he was
[1:32:36] bound he was bound by a
[1:32:40] chain it's
[1:32:45] chains and by feathers of
[1:32:47] Love they are chained but they are love
[1:32:55] I love
[1:32:57] that to do the will of
[1:33:00] God and that
[1:33:03] only he was a
[1:33:07] prisoner he was in the feathers of
[1:33:13] love he was in the Yoke of
[1:33:18] Christ he could he could yoke up in
[1:33:22] nothing uh with nothing
[1:33:26] else he was yoke up with
[1:33:30] him he was led he was led where he were
[1:33:41] LED and where the the lead
[1:33:45] went that's where he had to
[1:33:52] go regardless of how green the pasture
[1:33:55] was here on this side or the or or that
[1:34:02] side he had to go the way the leader and
[1:34:07] the Yoke
[1:34:10] went oh
[1:34:13] tonight if we as the Bram
[1:34:17] Tabernacle could only become
[1:34:21] prisoners to our own selfish
[1:34:25] being to our own
[1:34:30] ambition that we could we could
[1:34:32] completely surrender ourselves to be
[1:34:34] yolked to
[1:34:37] him no matter what the rest of the world
[1:34:40] think what the rest of the world
[1:34:43] does we are yoked with the feds of
[1:34:49] love we are prisoners
[1:34:56] my feet are so yolked with to Christ
[1:34:59] that I won't
[1:35:07] dance my eyes are so yolked with to
[1:35:10] Christ till I When I See This Modern uh
[1:35:14] uh strip teas on the streets it turns my
[1:35:18] head
[1:35:25] my heart is so yolked in love with him
[1:35:27] till I can't have love for this world
[1:35:33] anymore we are committing ourselves to
[1:35:37] him we are just choosing to be his
[1:35:41] prisoners and because of that
[1:35:44] love and of his yoke that is
[1:35:48] easy of his yoke that
[1:35:52] is joke that is filled with
[1:35:55] love he will turn us
[1:35:58] away of all the things that are of the
[1:36:02] world is that my will is so yolked to
[1:36:07] him till I don't even know what my
[1:36:10] ambitions
[1:36:13] are I don't even know what my ambitions
[1:36:16] are my ambitions are in Christ
[1:36:27] till I don't even know what my ambitions
[1:36:31] are just whatever you wherever you lead
[1:36:34] I'll follow
[1:36:36] Lord Lord I'll be a
[1:36:38] prisoner
[1:36:41] see it continues
[1:36:43] on paragraph
[1:36:49] 114 I'm trying my best not to to go past
[1:36:52] uh 8:30
[1:36:56] yeah I believe the musicians could
[1:36:59] come paragraph
[1:37:04] 114 he wanted to talk about
[1:37:07] Moses as a
[1:37:09] prisoner the the the this hope of
[1:37:13] Moses who became a
[1:37:16] prisoner
[1:37:19] Moses who had received instructions from
[1:37:21] his mother that he was a to be a
[1:37:25] a a
[1:37:28] liberator that he was called to to to to
[1:37:31] free
[1:37:33] Israel that he had the
[1:37:39] opportunity to go to school in Great
[1:37:41] Schools of uh military schools and and
[1:37:44] get the
[1:37:46] education and he learned everything that
[1:37:49] he
[1:37:50] needed so he could be a good uh
[1:37:52] liberator
[1:37:55] with great
[1:37:58] Ambitions when he learned all of
[1:38:01] that he tried to go and Liberate the
[1:38:05] people he killed one
[1:38:10] Egyptian and what did did
[1:38:12] do he ran away he ran away in the
[1:38:16] wilderness just killing one
[1:38:20] Egyptian with everything that he had as
[1:38:22] knowledge
[1:38:24] like everything that he has an
[1:38:27] aptitude God takes him through the
[1:38:30] Wilderness four 40 Years of emptying
[1:38:37] out and when he comes back 40 years
[1:38:42] later look at this great intellectual
[1:38:45] Moses what is it telling God I don't
[1:38:48] know how to speak
[1:38:54] God said I'll send
[1:38:56] you I don't know how to
[1:38:59] speak 40 Years of emptying
[1:39:04] out he took even away his
[1:39:11] speech says
[1:39:13] here but before I say about
[1:39:17] Moses I'd like to make this statement
[1:39:25] that God always has to take any man that
[1:39:28] will serve him truly to be his
[1:39:32] prisoner
[1:39:37] always a man has to surrender every
[1:39:41] Ambitions is God
[1:39:44] everything that he he is everything his
[1:39:48] life his soul his body will ambition
[1:39:53] and everything
[1:39:58] else and and and become a and become
[1:40:02] completely uh complete a prison of
[1:40:04] Christ who is the word to serve him to
[1:40:08] serve
[1:40:14] God you might you might have to walk
[1:40:17] contrary to your better judgment
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:32] maybe in certain organization you might
[1:40:34] think that they could uh uh lift you up
[1:40:37] and give you some uh something great
[1:40:40] that you might that you might
[1:40:43] flash but what it says but what what do
[1:40:47] you find
[1:40:51] yourself and find yourself
[1:40:58] defeated defeated after while until God
[1:41:02] can get a man that's willing to become a
[1:41:04] prisoner to
[1:41:07] him God is looking for
[1:41:11] prisoners tonight God is looking for
[1:41:15] prisoners he's always done
[1:41:18] it you might search you might search
[1:41:22] it through the
[1:41:25] scriptures a man has to be a prisoner to
[1:41:30] Christ against
[1:41:36] anything therefore you cannot be
[1:41:38] connected with anything but
[1:41:42] Christ even your father your mother your
[1:41:46] brother your sister your husband your
[1:41:50] wife anybody
[1:41:53] you are only connected with Christ and
[1:41:57] him alone
[1:41:59] only then God can use
[1:42:04] you until
[1:42:06] then you
[1:42:10] can't let's
[1:42:15] stand I know I have three more pages
[1:42:20] but I believe that we understand that
[1:42:22] God meets
[1:42:24] us as
[1:42:28] prisoners each one of us knows what
[1:42:31] you're going
[1:42:34] through you know what you are what what
[1:42:37] what is it that you are prisoner
[1:42:41] to what is it that occupies you the most
[1:42:45] than
[1:42:50] God what is stopping you to be more
[1:42:52] close closer to
[1:42:55] God what is stopping you to be more
[1:42:58] concentrated consecrated to
[1:43:02] God but God
[1:43:04] tonight he's looking for
[1:43:08] prisoners like I said in the
[1:43:12] beginning brother Beno in the office
[1:43:15] when we were back
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:18] there I pray that when you're going to
[1:43:21] preach that you're going to preach
[1:43:23] something that will you know talk to
[1:43:25] me I said oh my
[1:43:28] brother I said I'm going to preach for
[1:43:30] myself
[1:43:32] first I want to be his
[1:43:35] prisoner and I believe it's the will of
[1:43:37] each one of us
[1:43:39] tonight may God help us
[1:43:43] tonight to have one principal uh OB
[1:43:47] objective one principal
[1:43:50] thought to be prisoners of Christ
[1:43:55] what is he want out of
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:43:58] us what is his will concerning
[1:44:02] us sometimes you
[1:44:04] pray he some he seem to be
[1:44:09] quiet he may seem
[1:44:12] quiet that shouldn't discourage
[1:44:16] us that shouldn't stop us from
[1:44:20] believing it's just him he knows
[1:44:25] that during that
[1:44:29] period where he seemed to be
[1:44:32] quiet he's working on your patience
[1:44:38] maybe he wants to teach you to be
[1:44:42] patient and he's never
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:47] late even even if it decides to answer
[1:44:51] your prayer 20 years later
[1:44:57] maybe he will answer your prayers two
[1:44:59] days before you
[1:45:01] die but he will hear
[1:45:09] it and it doesn't mean that everything
[1:45:12] that you went through During the period
[1:45:14] where you thought it was
[1:45:16] silent that you were in the wrong
[1:45:19] direction
[1:45:23] as long as you commit yourself to
[1:45:25] him oh Lord I commit myself to
[1:45:29] you it's your word that I want to
[1:45:32] follow Lord I'm I'm a
[1:45:35] prisoner what you
[1:45:37] say I want to conform to your
[1:45:40] word I want to follow your
[1:45:49] word whether he hears my prayer answers
[1:45:52] my prayer on a certain topic or
[1:45:56] not as long as I know I'm I'm his
[1:46:00] prisoner you know Paul
[1:46:03] knew he had a
[1:46:06] burden he said he prayed the Lord he
[1:46:09] said he

[1:46:14] Gospel this great
[1:46:16] Apostle who is Healing The
[1:46:18] Sick who is fulfilling great things but
[1:46:22] he himself
[1:46:25] that he had something that he prayed the
[1:46:27] Lord many times and God didn't answer to
[1:46:31] his
[1:46:31] prayers and when he insisted the Lord
[1:46:35] tells him my grace is
[1:46:40] sufficient that's how God heard his
[1:46:42] prayer my grace is sufficient for
[1:46:46] you he told
[1:46:50] us seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:46:53] its
[1:46:54] righteousness and all other
[1:46:58] things and then he didn't say Seek first

[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:29] I I claim that seeing me well
[2:01:31] part amen We Know by Stripes we're
[2:01:34] healed amen Lord Jesus we just thank you
[2:01:38] that we're able to come together and
[2:01:40] hear your
[2:01:41] word Lord there's many other places
[2:01:44] where the Believers don't have this
[2:01:45] privilege and opportunity because of the
[2:01:48] climate of the countries they live in
[2:01:50] there's
[2:01:52] uh anti-conversion laws and communism
[2:01:56] Lord that fights against this very word
[2:01:59] that we believe
[2:02:01] and Lord forgive us when we take it for
[2:02:04] granted to come and be with our brothers
[2:02:07] and sisters of precious like Faith it's
[2:02:10] certainly a great privilege and
[2:02:12] honor Lord what a wonderful word we
[2:02:14] heard tonight that we want to be your
[2:02:17] prisoner and Lord when we think of that
[2:02:20] thought so many times we think naturally
[2:02:23] of a prison and what a prison in the
[2:02:26] natural does is it it locks you in and
[2:02:30] it doesn't let you leave but really Lord
[2:02:33] what a prisoner of you does is it keeps
[2:02:35] everything out yes we see all the bars
[2:02:39] and all the bar wire and everything that
[2:02:41] it looks like it's keeping everybody in
[2:02:43] but Lord when we're your prisoner It's
[2:02:45] Your Love keeping everything out Lord
[2:02:47] that when the enemy would try to assel
[2:02:49] us he'd have to come through the blood
[2:02:52] and but we're your prisoner Lord there's
[2:02:55] nothing that can cross that bloodline
[2:02:57] and oh we just want to be so in love
[2:03:00] with you Lord Jesus that as our brother
[2:03:03] pointed out yes that there is a we're
[2:03:06] trading a yoke for a yoke but oh your
[2:03:09] yoke it's easy Lord the enemy wants to
[2:03:12] make us a a great have a great
[2:03:15] Taskmaster and run us so far down in the
[2:03:18] muck and Meer of sin but oh God you lift
[2:03:20] us up you Place us upon a strong Rock of
[2:03:23] Revelation Lord and and then we take
[2:03:26] your yoke and it's easy Lord It's
[2:03:28] leading us into the promised land it's
[2:03:30] leading us to a body change it's leading
[2:03:32] Us in joy and truth and righteousness
[2:03:35] Lord where all things are new father and
[2:03:38] when we wake up tomorrow Lord your
[2:03:40] mercies will be new once again father
[2:03:43] Lord we thank you for your healing touch
[2:03:45] Lord in our bodies Lord we we know that
[2:03:49] you heal us Lord and on this side we'll
[2:03:52] get sick again and but one of these days
[2:03:55] Lord we'll be
[2:03:57] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[2:04:00] eye Hallelujah Lord and soon and very
[2:04:03] soon we'll see our loved ones
[2:04:05] just coming into this Dimension and
[2:04:08] telling us it's
[2:04:10] time it's time to go home and then it
[2:04:14] all be over lord we'll all be gathered
[2:04:17] together with the messenger of the age
[2:04:20] and there will come that that great
[2:04:22] climatic
[2:04:24] moment where we look upon your
[2:04:27] face what a day that will be
[2:04:31] Lord it'll all be worth it
[2:04:34] then all the all the hardship all the
[2:04:38] heartache all the hurt all the
[2:04:41] pain oh it's just a moment Lord on this
[2:04:46] side but one of these days we'll have
