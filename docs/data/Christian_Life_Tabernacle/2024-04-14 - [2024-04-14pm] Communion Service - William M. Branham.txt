Description:
Sunday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
April 14, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

voice of our Messengers father dedicating this place to worship along with dedicating ourselves father we thank you for your goodness to us we ask you to bless us this evening in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen let's turn in our Bibles today this morning to um Isaiah 53 and read in the scriptures found there amen now this is more like it you know I like being assembled with the real believer amen well you say well how can you say that Brother David well the prophet of God said you won't be there if you don't take communion and foot washing I can't change that you know I wish I could uh I think if the word of God wasn't so plain I would be a Universalist you know what that is don't you where God's so good he's saving everybody in the universe at one time it's called universalism and uh it it it's a uh good maybe Doctrine to live by but it's a bad Doctrine to die by you know so uh we we we certainly don't want to be that but we we we trying to encourage people uh maybe in a little different approach but to just examine ourselves and I think the terminology I think they use uh amongst the young people and everything and athletes is to step up your game and I think that's what they say right you got to step it up you got to move it to a higher level you know and that's what we're wanting the Lord to do we're want his Spirit to stimulate us to move us to a higher level I noticed in the uh tape this morning that brother Ram talked about young people and every thing passing notes well don't say no I don't pass notes I send text you know what I mean or I snapshot or uh Zip Zap and whatever you call it you know uh it's all the same you know the bottom line was pay attention right so and and we'll grow in the Lord so uh uh there's a lot of adjusting going on and I think the bigger adjustment is for us on this hand I think that all of a sudden you can't even see everybody in the back and and you're tying trying to focus and uh so it's pretty overwhelming plus it was uh I don't know how to say it but when they started setting out folding chairs I thought oh my you know what have we done you know and so I I mentioned to somebody I said I'm just going to have to start really preaching hard he said the harder you preach the more they'll come so one brother come up to me and he said oh I can't wait till you get that over there ready because we're going to fill that up by the end of the year and uh I was looking at Billy and I saying are you ready to pass her yet or you know any anybody want this job uh uh because you just can't you know the hardest part is you just can't know everybody you know and I've always been a person because I grew up with so many complexes that I always had a tight circle of friends I knew everybody I hung around with you know and if I didn't like somebody I didn't just didn't have nothing to do with them well that's hard to do as a pastor you know you can't you can't pick your sheep you know what I mean whoever and God changed my heart you know and uh and now I want to know everybody you know and I don't have the ability and and plus I could go into all my uh weaknesses you know that I have facial recognition disorder and I've got Ada you know attention deficit disorder and I got all these disord ERS so and all God just says you can't use your excuses so you can't use your excuses and you can't use anything that ability you have so I guess we're just and we'll talk about that here in a minute I guess we're just stuck with the word of God Amen that's a good thing to be stuck with is it let's read this uh scripture here you know this is um this is a very good scripture and we want to read it just a few verses maybe down uh through the uh sixth verse and and then maybe you could read it later most of you probably know the rest of it it says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed amen for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrow yet we did not but yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed we all like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all and let's turn over to Matthew and we and I'd like to read uh and then it says here in the 16th verse it says but wherefore shall I liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the market and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and and ye have not danced we have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented for John came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil the son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a man gluttonous and a wine bibber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is Justified of her children now we'll skip to the um 25th verse and it said and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hath revealed them unto babes even so father for it seeth good in thy sight Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word your precious name we pray amen you may be seated this morning evening thank you very much just a small excuse me just a small thought before uh communion uh tonight that uh we'd like to speak on I I think I probably ran off and left my notes in my office but we won't worry about it um we're not going to be long anyway I'd like to read something that the prophet God said he used these scriptures in God hidden Simplicity and uh he said God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same and you know Isaiah is such a beautiful scripture uh that expresses that here it's absolutely prophesied and if you continue reading the Scripture it talks about whom he was numbered with and whom he was buried and it it describes uh in great detail the uh the crucifixion and the unfolding of the ministry of the Lord yet it totally went unrecognized and the scripture said like who would believe report you know whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and I love this scripture here when Isaiah says this a great thing he he it says he says he says uh surely he hath borne our grief in so here he was he was a a appeared to be a a a man that carried a great burden and a great great load um no doubt he found himself in the scriptures how many believe the Lord found himself in the scriptures in other words even at 12 years old as think of him as a child uh and we many times we take the scripture uh he learned obedience you know by the things he suffered but it it was wasn't that he was a bad boy and mommy and daddy were spanking him that's our natural Trend but here's a young man born of God the spirit of God's in him in fact he is the word of God made flesh at very young age he goes and begins to sit in the temple and he begins to hear the psalm readings and they're talking about the Messiah they're talking about the sacrificial lamb the word of God is being open to him as he sits there and and the more that he hears it the more he knows for this cause I have come into the world in other words he knew what laid ahead of him he could read in the scripture and his parents would no doubt shared with him maybe they had something in their home and and and he as a young boy he'd asked what was this and and they would say well that's when your father and I uh fled to Egypt and he would think about the scripture about how the children were slaughtered and Rachel wept for her children and that was a part of him and and and he bore that you understand he he understood it he the those scriptures resignated with him you say oh I I don't think he he did that at 12 years old he's sitting in the temple with the scribes and the scholars of the teachers and he's confounding them with the scripture so even at that age he could go out and look in the word of God and the word of God was unfolding to him it was unfolding his future to him and and and what what do you think that when he he realized who that he was and the part that he had to play think of the burden that he was under under think of what Revelation was really doing to him and yet when man looked at them they they they they spoke a truth in a way but not from their understanding they they thought he was afflicted he was stricken of God in other words this man's cursed you know what did they say he's got a what he's got a devil it's be elab I mean they're totally missing they're they're blind totally blind to the fact that this man not even 33 years old he he isn't he's not that he do he's not happy but he knows that he's carrying the sins of the world he's got discernment you know beyond the measure that we could even perceive that he knew what the thoughts and intents of their heart were you might think oh I'd like to have that no you don't how would you like to know what people really think of you you know you'd probably go jump off a bridge or something you know what I mean I maybe I shouldn't have said that but but what I'm trying to point out is how man misses it how he misses it so every time he heard he heard the scriptures and they were unfolding to him he was now learning The Obedience that he was going to have to obey to carry out the will of the father and that's why he would could easily turn and say I do nothing till the father reveals it to me I believe the father spoke to him through the scriptures I believe that he he he he read because he was able to say it is written it is written when he was tempted by Satan he he didn't act like he had some other sword or some other weapon against Satan he had the same weapon that God gave you he used the word he used the word so this this sorrow and this stricken that we that we laid upon him the the the grief that he had was for our behalf it it it was for it was for us that that they've seen it and here's the word of God uh uh coming to pass right before their eyes and they missed it and that's what he said who has believed our report who has believed what what that I've been preaching and what that I've been saying in other words they should have been able to recognize them by the very things that they believed but we know that they were blinded for our sake that's what they were they were blinded for so we as Gentiles could receive this gospel if if it would have unfolded and Israel would have believed and all God's people would have came back to him he could have taken re leadership right then and the Millennium would have been on right him Lord of Lord King of Kings Israel restored tell me that wouldn't have been something no it wouldn't have been something cuz we wouldn't be here but he did it for us cuz he knew he had a gentile bride amen and he was doing so when when you see these scriptures and you begin to see them unfold you also begin to see here's man looking at something totally wrong totally missing it because he hid himself in in such a humble man such a a young boy such a uh something that had no Beauty in him that would be desired his personality his nature wasn't one that was uh full of so much Charisma that uh people were just drawn to him he very humbly uh sat back he was Meek you know he was likeing UN MOS he's a Meek man he was a he he he was a a softspoken man but when he did speak the world Stood Still never was there a man that spoke like this man in fact he even told his mother at the Feast of Canaan he said they they've ran out of wine and and you you know he looks at her and he says woman what's that to me you know what do what do I care they ran out of wne you know I don't you know it's it's nothing to me you wouldn't uh you you know I I don't know how that you think he might have said it but he kind of tell then he look he say it's not my time my time hasn't come yet you know what I mean but here's the mother that raised him and she says do whatever he says to do you know something was fixing to happen there was a Creator sitting in their midst and it was completely gone unnoticed and he went and filled the the they did as they said and they filled the the vases full of water and they brought water in there and then he tells them go take it to the steward and and have them draw from the water and I can just see the guys now taking this big old bucket of water this big clay thing of water over there they know it's water and they said Mary told us to bring you this water her son did you know Jesus over there you know my cousin or my my you know friend or whatever and they didn't wer expecting nothing to happen and the Stewart goes in there and he drinks it he says what's this how come they save the best wine to last I'll guarant a man has never tasted wine like that never again but we will again amen are you looking forward to that time amen and so yeah so what is transpiring there's something transpiring but it's totally hid it's it's going on but it it it's totally hid uh from all all the wise and and all the prudent and all the people that should have known the word of God and should have known what was going to take place it it's it's totally bypassing them here's a man in their midst that just turned water uh into wine and it it's absolutely going to be explained away the first thing is oh they just saved the best last because we know everybody has taken their fill this is in the scripture right normally you bring out the good wine first and then after everybody's taken their fill then you give them the bad wine because they're not going to notice now they're saying this oh they saved the good wine to last so we wouldn't drink as much and they'd have a bunch that's that's the way our minds work it's hid from the wise and The Prudent and it's revealed unto babes if it's hid and so our messenger makes this statement I thought it was pretty tremendous he says it's strange to think how that God does such a thing as that God will hide himself in something so simple that will cause the wise to miss it millions of miles and then turn right back around some simple thing in the Simplicity of his way of working and reveal him self right out again it it it it's hid it's it it's so revealed it's like let's just compare tonight to this morning everybody think wow the building's packed out you know we got 400 and some people we're packing chairs everywhere wow this is God no this is God the Simplicity of obeying the word of God man's always looking for God in great things and big numbers and big movements and some way that he can measure it in some way that he can see it but even even the Lord taught the prophet he heard the Thunder roaring and then he and the lightning flashing and he said God wasn't in that and he wasn't in the blowing but he was in that still small boid that's still still Small Voice that brought you back to the house of God to have communion I mean that's greatness to God you know you never measure a church you never you never measure a a a church by their crowd measure a church by communion service that's the best way to measure a church that's the best way to to see those that are willing to stand up it communion and take the communion test he who eateth of this cup unworthily and drinketh of eth this bread and drink of this cup unworthy drinketh damnation to themselves now now you're talking you know what I mean now you're standing up in the presence of the word of God and measuring yourself to the scriptures and examine yourself and if and the scripture tells us if if a man has so done wrong he said then then let him repent of that and then let him take communion let him make himself right in his heart and and and make the decisions and the dedication to uh uh to have a transformation in his life uh to to do better and to reach out higher and to serve God greater and and that's what communion does for you it brings you to a place it's a measuring post it's a place that you can sit and commune with him and talk it over with you and he can talk it over with you you know I always thought of that uh of that a wife that could married a boy and our messenger tells us the story and he says to uh they get married and she says to her husband I think in the story he might use the the name John he says John I know that you have a problem with drinking he said if you ever go out for some reason and stumble and fall he said you don't stay away you come right back here and we'll pray through it I love you and I'm here to battle that enemy with you that's the kind of God we serve he doesn't want us to stay away you you know what I mean and and uh it's just like the uh I don't remember the message that our uh brother Brandon brought this out in but it's always stuck with me the thing that he said it may have been Jesus with dirty feet or or or or one of those sermons he said but when that woman The Prostitute that that had uh seen Jesus at the feast and she took noticed that nobody had washed his feet and so she went and she bought some oil and and and anointing to anoint him with and to wash his feet with and the messenger said that she stood back and she watched and in her mind she thought well he'll know where I got the money to buy this and and he and and and uh what's he going to say what happens if he rejects me can you imagine the Mind battle that she went through but brother R said she finally came to the place where she knew he was the only one that could help her that's finally what drove her down there and she fell at her feet feet and begin to weep and and uh expressing sorrow for the life she lived it's not the way that she wanted to be she wanted to be free and he washed her his feet with her tears and wiped his his feet with her hair and and and he he he sat and and everybody else was missing what's going on here's God revealing his nature to Fallen man right in front of their eyes and here's such a simple woman of no regard of no respect uh of no prominence whatsoever and here's the church world all around and they're and they're pointing a finger at him and he says Simon he says nobody washed my feet nobody met me here nobody gave me any respect because they wanted to mock them and then he just speaks these great words daughter your sins which are many are all forgiven go and sin no more I mean what greater words could be SP spoken can you imagine how free she leapt and walked from that place you think she cared what anybody thought no she was different and I'll guarantee you the rest of her life was a testimony that she was different many believe that she continued to follow the lord and Minister uh to the ministry but a great thing was put on display right before their eyes and they couldn't catch it they couldn't catch the reality of it and I think that's so important the word of God is coming to pass all around us by the minute like like I say the world is falling apart there's Wars there's rumors of wars there's there's all kind of things happening and and the greatest thing that can happen for us is that we could have a revelation of the reality of what is transpiring in our generation and in the time that we're living not a long time ago not in the future but now not last week but this week today that's right what is is God showing what is he uh what is he trying to unfold what is he trying to say to the church how is his Spirit moving what what is in that Storehouse that God is uh uh speaking out to us that he wants us to to uh put the isav on of God's word that we might see that we could take the word of God and closee that our nakedness wouldn't appear that we could by gold tried and fire the the character of The Gospel that's the reality that we want to catch that's what communions about communions about catching the reality of the spirit of God and the unfolding of God's word in its present tense not theology not Doctrine not Bible teaching but the reality of the word of God coming to [Applause] pass he said and he he talks if I could go say on and he was he makes a statement about the Seven Seals it's pretty tremendous he says he says God he says now man has their own idea of what God ought to be and what God is going to do and I have have made the old statement many times that man Still Remains man man is always giving God praise for what he he did do and always looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he is doing so you say what is it that we need to catch more than anything what's he doing what's God doing what's his intent what's his purpose what is it that he's trying to do with us excuse me what kind of maturity is he trying to bring us to what kind of greenness is he trying to bake out of us what what what's he trying to do to our minds that the mind of Christ might be in us that that we might be uh Washed by the washing of the water of the word and and and our our whole uh uh continents might uh change that we might change the atmosphere around us we we we get into that same stuper does everybody know what a stuper is right okay I don't know if everybody knows that but you know a state of stupidity I made that definition but that that things you know that we we don't we just we we just think that everything's fine and everything's going to just happen what's happening and and and there there's no part that we play and one day God's going to do what he can do no we don't want to be there so he goes on to say this he says that's the way they miss it they look back and see what great things he done but they failed to see what a simple thing he used to do it with and then they look forward and see a great thing coming that's going to happen and nine times out of 10 it's already happened right around them and it's so simple that they don't know it and and so you if if if if if the messengers has it on his heart to bring that out to us he's trying to make us aware that that's our tendency it's our tendency to myth what he's doing now and certainly that's what the isav is for amen it it's not for Doctrine by no means you know what I mean it it's it's it's for present tense Revelation and then he makes this statement I'd like to read this also because if you look at the days of Jesus what a political turmoil that was there was a great political turmoil wh why do you think Herod and the scribes and the Pharisees rose up against Jesus you think it was because of of of maybe his Doctrine they might have said it was blasphemed but they knew everything he said was true it was a power struggle they had they they were lording over God's people they they sat in the Feast of of uh uh at at prominent table they they singled themselves out above men they they claimed to be the teachers of of of the word of God they they they wanted to have the preeminence amongst the people and here comes this Carpenter guy from Nazareth no Beauty in him you know what I mean he's he he's got the burden of the world upon him and and and yet everywhere he goes demons are being cast out and people are being delivered and the lame is walking they've never seen nothing about it they they they don't have that power and you know what they're enraged dri or enraged with nothing but pure jealousy they got to put an end to this guy else they're going to lose their position because the buzz of the people was not praise God the messiah's here no they believed that there was one there that was going to deliver them from the Romans and restore back the glory of Israel and we find that on the road to EMAs they said oh what are you such a a stranger in these parts not to recognize what's happened and he's looking at them and saying you fools what what happened to you isn't it written in the scriptures that the Messiah should come he should be despised and and he he took him through the scriptures and laid out to them the reality of what was really taking place and here man was looking down the road and looking back and we thought this was this and we thought this was going to happen and what did they do they missed God sitting right in their mid they missed that their stripes that the chastisement of their peace was upon them they missed that he bore their iniquity he missed that they took their shame everything that he was doing at that time the Deliverance of man from Death the deliverance from sin the paying of their price the washing of their souls the absolutely the taking the curse of death off of them they totally missed it could you imagine how many's looking for a resurrection and a rapture how many has got an idea in your mind how it's going to happen well you might as well count on one thing is probably wrong if you want to catch the Rapture you've got to catch what he's doing today you got to ask God to be unveiled not not in this building not in this ministry but what God's doing in his word you've got to find him in the assembly you got to find them in the gospel you got to find them in your brothers and sisters you you've got to know him and I say it over again in his present tense reality that's what you need I have I have that you might see see him open it up to me Lord let me let me come in contact I I don't want to be led like the blind leads the Blind and through all that great political turmoil that was going on here he was freeing man ending the grave for his children and for all his kin all those that were kin to him from before and in the presence there he was the great kinsman redeemer standing there in the form of sin appearing to be shaped in iniquity no Beauty no nothing but yet the chosen Lamb of God every man everybody else would have chose a general they would have chose something big something that appeared to be happening somebody that had uh some sort of command over the English language but yet God chose it not to be that way Paul even had to say I didn't come to you with great enticing speech you know I didn't come to you in the wisdom of men with Excellence of speech and and great big sermons he said I came to you in the power and the demonstration of the Resurrection I came to you to that you might recognize that he's real and he's alive I've came not to build something I've came to put you into contact with him personally that you might know him the scripture says in the power of his resurrection that that's the knowledge that you might know him not know about him not know what he did not know what he's going to do but you might know him in his present tense power that he has the power now and is present now to change things I'm going to close with this statement before [Music] communion and it's a striking statement now remember God hides himself in simple things you you might never know why God ever chooses somebody but the choosing is his you know there will be people that are more qualified uh more knowledgeable they have everything about them they seem like they have all the uh qualities and education and abilities and God never chooses that guy man chose Saul God chose David David was a Shepherd as we heard this morning God told him I raised you up you were a Shepherd I made you King who did that God did that that's the kind of God that we serve and he says this in in closing this is I don't have paragraphs here brothers and I'm sorry for that he says a man was made to rely completely upon God now I want you to see how simple this is but yet how hard it is to grab a hold of man was made to rely completely upon God that's the reason we're likened unto Lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has got to have a leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed to lead us so man is made that way and God made all of his works so simple that the simple could understand it and God makes himself so simple with the simple in order to be understood by the simple let's be simpletons in your life let's see how simple can you make things you know there just might be a reason behind everything that's happening to you if we'd stop a moment and not be presumptuous in any way but just stop and say Lord give me eyes set where are you maybe it's it's okay that this happened or that happened I'm in your hands nothing can pluck me out of your hands what what what happens if the world comes to the end I go to heaven you say oh brother mcar you're making it so simple I can't make it simple enough salvation's a gift of God L any man should boast we didn't even earn it well we were yet a sinner he died for us he didn't wait for us to clean up he cleaned us up he cleaned us up before we got cleaned up he threw it in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more amen I mean I'm the worst of getting frustrated at this world and it it's maybe it's Pride maybe it's ego you you you know what I mean sometimes you get to the place you think how could this world run with so many incompetent people you know you you get waited on and and you just you don't get it you think what going on in your mind you know could I have a water with no ice so I get a glass of ice with no water I think did I say that you know but why not just stop and say you know something there's a reason I got this glass with ice maybe somebody needs that glass that's simple but the simpler you make your life the more un complicated you get it the problems that you make so big really aren't very big at all you say I don't know what I'm going to do I can't pay my rent well you know what big deal God said he won't see the righteous beg bread you think well how how would you approach that then well I might look like if I'm not paying my bills and I'm not uh you know making my things right maybe I'm lacking righteousness always bring it home always make it simple because that's where God is he speaks in simple things he the our problems are simple they're Satan's making this big outrageous thing you know how simple is we're made to rely on him if we rely on him and he made us that way don't you think that he made us that way so he could take care of us that's pretty simple he can do it and you say well what happens if I lose my life wait a minute if I lose my life I go to heaven that's pretty good Paul finally said death or Peter I forget which one right now in my mind but he said death where's your string grave where's your Victory I've ran a good race I fought a good fight I I go to receive the crown that's laid up for me you the the simpler you keep it the simpler it is the the more you bring it back home the more you'll find out God's a lot more around us than we really you say how is that true because he said he would be he said wherever two or three gather together I'll be there in his midst wouldn't that be fabulous if you could look around this evening and see him standing in our midst but he'd be so simple we'd be so simple I was moved this morning when when Enrique came up for prayer and he knows that God dealt with him to get baptized and he put it off and then he came up to the front and he says I want to thank God for sparing my life and giving me a chance to serve him I'd like him to heal me so I can get baptized simple but that was God that was God moving right in our midst and it goes completely unnoticed how many times when somebody comes up for prayer it's just another person coming up for prayer your antennas ought to go up your spiritual antennas your eyes ought to get filled with IAB and you start looking for the spirit of God moving God's here be tender to the presence of the Lord somebody's come for prayer the word of God says in no wise will he cast them out the word of God says ask the Elders of the church to pray for you anoint you with oil and you shall be healed so many things have got so common to us that we've fallen into that trap one day we're going to go to heaven that's not what we're promised you say oh yeah we are no we're promised to sit in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus now could you imagine let me put it this way to you just to share a little light around you maybe to stimulate our thinking if you're sitting in the presence of Jesus now right you're you're sitting in high places in Christ Jesus right if the same spirit's in him wouldn't it be amazing if you stayed where you are and the world fell away from you we always think oh we're going to out of this world how about if all the world around you just dissipated and there you were sitting in his presence with none of else of this around oh that seems like heaven to me it's a Time Church to wash our minds the renewing of our minds by the washing of the water of the word and examine and how we're thinking what's attracting us what's important to us and I tell you if you do those things you'll find out this life is not as difficult as the devil tries to make it out to be amen and we have victory over that roaring lion amen do you believe that amen God bless you let's Stand Together just turn in the book of any I thought that was Corinthians [Music] 11 what scripture say I thought it was 11 I'm in 11 okay all right there we are thank you let just uh read our communion scripture and sisters we prepared a place uh for you to wash feet where you always wash feet so we're trying to get more buckets and brand new towels for you that you can maybe try to do it in one setting and then the brothers and maybe we can shorten our our foot washing time for your sake it says those for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he Breo it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come who wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together un condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen God bless you brother and Ne and we'll just do communion the way we always do it just right here in the front Okay let's pray together our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have this bread that represents your body father and we know it's the word of God father the body word of the Lord is food indeed and Lord It's what that we live by it's our life and our light and we ask you to bless it to us this evening father as we remember the promises Lord and remember the day of our visitation father we remember the day of our deliverance we remember the day that the price was paid for us Lord when your love was so expressed that you so loved us that you laid down your life for us father that we might have life Eternal Father we're remembering that at this time that that it's not religion that God is there it's not theology that God is there it's not our works that God is there it was Calvary that God is there the sacrificed lamb giving his life that our sins would be upon him and the punishment of our sins would be upon him that we could go free we remember that this evening father in this wine Lord which represents the stimulation of Revelation father that you can reveal the purchased possession to each believer that you can reveal their pardon to them Father that they might accept that pardon that you can fill them with a life father that keeps them free from the bondage of sin and death father we remember that we remember you doing all these things for us father and we take this in remembrance of you Lord knowing that you're present here with us in this building right now to carry out every promise in your word for them that believe we're grateful
