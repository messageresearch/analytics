Description:
Don't Forget Titus
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service
December 29th, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

want to have God give him strength this is beautiful scriptures and let's just read the first six verses together just have a time of Fellowship this morning uh it says God who at sundried times and in diverse manner spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things but whom also he had made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he hath by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which of the Angels For unto which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the firstborn into the world he said let all the angels of God worship him our gracious father we ask you to bless our service this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated we want to look at uh this scripture and it says who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and I I want to just to Fellowship a little bit this morning I I received uh uh some quotes and and uh they inspired me and uh looking at the sermon uh with the passing of brother Mariam expressions and uh the uh brother BR made this statement he says there is so much of life that's Expressions expressing and the definition of expression is to convey a thought or a feeling or to show what you think or what you feel and so uh life is an expression we we don't uh realize it but uh we're we're always expressing something you know uh we we even know that the the whole beauty of of the Lord Jesus being the expressed love of God that God so loved the world he expressed that Love To Us by giving us his only begotten son and so we we says that Jesus was was you know God's expression of love but what was that what was he expressing he came down and he identified himself as one of us and and the purpose of doing that is so that he could express to us that he knows what we feel he knows what we're going through we have an identity with him that that he was tempted in every way that I was tempted so when you feel weak he he knows what you're going through he knows what the failures is he he knows when you feel broken and that's why he came to bind up the Brokenhearted he he knows when you're discouraged you know what I mean I I always I always chuckle uh when I hear that song about Santa Claus you know he knows what you're thinking he knows when you're asleep he knows if you've been good or bad you know and like like he knows everything I I I thought you know isn't that just what the devil tried to do with Christmas is take it off the Lord and and give all those attributes to some guy that in a red suit that goes down a chimney and that it just expresses to you how ignorant man really can be you know what I mean that they'd want to Pedal that to their children and pedal that to the world when the truth is so much better you know I would rather know that there's someone that's really real and really alive that knows what I feel that suffered sickness like I suffered sickness that was weary like I I was weary that was tempted the way that I was tempted so somebody that that could put his arm around me and say I know what you're going through I I know what what trials you have uh so it's been an expression he was the expression of God's love he was the expression of of the uh expressed image of God in other words he was the expression of God's feelings and and and and love for us and knowing what we're going through he Express that identity to us he he's he's he's not our enemy he's our friend you know Satan's always trying to make God our enemy boy you better be right you know else you know he's going to get you no he's there for you he's always there for us he he's there to do for us exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask or think so you when you begin to to to approach it it it it's an expression and and you know our Our Lives Express things God's always been trying to express to man he expressed to been trying to show men there's life after death that that that there there's this is not the whole substance of everything that God is our little 80 90 70 whatever years are allotted to us that's not the whole sum and substance what God is this portion of our life is not the full substance of what we are we were before here we were before here we we we were in his thinkings we were in his plan we were we were part of his expression then there became came a time when he spoke it there became a time and this is just a a a a small uh time frame and then we know that that there's life after this life so the the we we get caught up so many times in the 50 60 70 years uh some people haven't even been given that time on life many a young child has passed away many a baby only had a few days on this Earth just a a short time of expression but this is not the whole picture right and God tries to express that to us but he did it in the sun rising and coming up and the whole pattern of life is just expressed right before us and it sets and it rises again it does it with the trees it it it does it in nature we can see it all around around the day and the night the the the winter and the representing this the spring of Life the seed and leaves falling off going in the ground the tree springing up again that it's all an expression it it's God relaying to us or conveying his thoughts and feelings that's what to express means is to convey your thoughts a and feelings you you can't express something unless there's something behind it to express you know maybe sometimes you express your disappointment sometime you express uh your frustration sometime you express different feelings that you have we're we're very proned in our weaknesses to express our our feelings and and it it's a great challenge in life to bring that under subjection and to control you know some of us are a little more hot-headed than others and and and you know we got short fuses you know and our Expressions come a lot quicker and a lot faster and a lot harder you know what I mean but nevertheless if you if we can begin to understand that everything about God was expressing God had thoughts thoughts right and then to express those thoughts a word is a thought expressed so he expressed what he was thinking and he put it in word form so he said what he was going to do he said let there be so he had a thought in his mind of what light was and so he said let there be and and then when light appeared then we knew what the interpret ation of that was because the expression now became manifested and we can see it and so what we do is we have a thought we have a feeling and that's within us and all of a sudden we express that and so that expression is conveying or telling everybody around us what we think what we feel and that what life is and and so I I realize that we're all here for a purpose and Jesus had a purpose and it was to express God's thoughts and feelings that he had in his heart to express them to us so he became the expressed image of God he became the feelings of God the thoughts of God God so loved us that he gave his son God wanted to forgive us of our sins so he paid the price for us he everything he wanted to share his life with us so he sent his spirit it's hard to believe that men would reject that that they would reject the love of God that they'd reject the spirit of God that that they would that they wouldn't want to come into fellowship with him that that they wouldn't want to have the joy unspeakable full of Glory it's amazing that people would take a substitute you know they're they're searching for it they're hungering for it you know why do you think you go by a liquor store and they call it Spirits we they might as well put the sign up there substitute for the Holy Spirit you can get in this bottle peace you can get deliverance from depression you can you can feel good for a a a few hours you you know what I mean why don't they put it on a drugstore you know substitute for the word of God here take a pill you know that'll take care of the word of God God has given us he he's expressed to us that I love you amen I know how you feel I want to walk with you I won't leave you or forsake you I'll be with you even to the end I'm going to take this journey with you uh when when you're down I'll be there you know when you're going through good times I'll Rejoice with you when you're going through sad times I'll suffer with you it the the whole thing is a great expression uh of what it is now can you imagine just sitting back and and putting your your head in the sand and say God's not expressing nothing that's what Peter said you everybody says oh where's the signs of is coming everything goes on the way he said now just remember God's not slack concerning his promises the time will come CU not on our time but man will disease this world to death he'll blow this world to death he'll drive people insane I mean think what's going on in our country uh just the there there's something else that's being expressed how does a man go light somebody on fire in a subway car what if that doesn't tell you demons are now expressing themselves they're coming out of the woodwork people are killing one another stealing robbing gangs are going through apartment complexes you know you can sit back and say oh you know I'm going to live in my bubble but you're missing the expression the Satan and the world is expressing what's really going on we knew these Expressions would be here we knew the thoughts and the feelings of what Satan had in mind would one day manifest themselves he told us as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of Noah when they were married and given into marriage we we see these things we see the same Spirits at work what that's an expression on that if I could use the saying that's an expression on this side of the fence people doing things to people that are totally unjust without without any real process they'll do it it it's because their their minds have been taken over because they they they haven't connected with the understanding that their lives are expressing something and the question comes to us what is it that we want to express I'm not interested in expressing a certain political agenda I I I don't want to express woke you know but I'm I'm not I don't want to express you know I I I don't want to express you know make America great again why am I going to want to express make America great again when a prophet full of the spirit of God none other than deity dwelling in them said that this place is gone I'm not interested in expressing America that's but I've got to come to Consciousness what is it that I'm expressing am I expressing the American dream you know I'm going to go out and get a house I'm going to get a car I'm going to get a good job I'm going to get a big retirement I'm G to have a a program I'm going to take vacations uh what is it what is it that my life is conveying and expressing what I feel is is if if my life is full of depression if my life is is full of discouragement then I'm expressing I don't believe there's any hope amen it becomes an expression of a of a hope if I if I don't like where I'm living I don't like what my job is I don't like this I don't like that you know may maybe it's expression that that you haven't found something that makes you happy but if you knew you were going to heaven and you knew any day now you knew you you had the mansion that everybody's looking for you say how big's your Mansion my Mansion is 15,000 miles across 1,500 wide 15 this way 15 that way 15 this way 15 up 15 down you figure out how many square feet it is that's my mansion that's the one I possess now am I expressing that so I I if if if I could just lay that down to you and then I would like to give you the the uh my sermon title and it's called don't forget Titus and you know Titus is quite a book little three chapter book of a letter that he wrote to Titus but Paul when he writes this letter to Titus he's reminding Titus why that he sent Titus I believe to cre is is where that he he he sent him and uh and and so he he goes through there uh yeah cre c r e te I think that's cre he says for this cause left IV in cre so he's reminding Paul of the purpose that he was sent to cre and what it was that he wanted Titus to express what it was what Titus why are you here what are the purpose that you're in cre the purpose that I have left you in De creete is to he wanted to ordain Elders he wanted to spread the gospel he wanted to to pick things so he had a purpose in expressing to cre through the people of God the things that God was and is and if I could take that we won't be long this morning but I'd like to go and pick up Paul letter to Titus and start reading in the second chapter and then we will bring this down now we're talking about expression so Paul is going to start writing to Timothy things that are important in our life because they express so how many of we've heard this saying our actions speak louder than our words our life choices you understand Express and there's if you keep let's say you had opportunity and and you kept it at choosing work over church now sometimes you you have to choose work over church I'm not going to try to go through scenarios sometimes your Ox is in the ditch but if all you do is is is work on that Ox then you're expressing to me that Ox is more valuable to you and it's more important to you to get that Ox out of the ditch than anything which tells me your first love is that Ox that's what you want to preserve that's what you want to take care of that's your nest egg that's your hope that's what your life's depending on you could call that Ox anything you want to do a lot of times it's a job a lot of times it's a possession but it doesn't matter but you no matter what you say I love God praise God Ox time your your real feeling and your real thoughts are expressed in your action if if you're afraid some people have Financial fear they if they don't have enough money in the bank if they don't have that cushion if they can't make that car payment if they can't make that rent they they they they they they're they're driven they'll make the choices that cover those bases because they don't trust they don't they don't they don't they're expressing I don't think that if I make a different choice that God will cover this they they don't realize it but but we we become an expression God put all of nature around us to express his glory that's right the the scriptures written in the skies the invisible things of God are clearly seen by the visible things around us so it's all became a great big expression that we're living in like the little boy and the fishing with the man on the boat he said you know Granda can you show me God and and he he said look around you he said I see God everywhere well if you saw God everywhere there would be part of your life part of your experience part of your atmosphere part of your nature that would express it you know everything's okay you might get weary but you're not going to quit you might fall down but but you're going to get up cuz your expression is I'm going to keep running this race I I've got to finish this race I know there's a a goal at the end I want to run I I want to succeed I I want to be a Christian but if it's lukewarm you know what lukewarm is is is equal cold and is equal hot you know 5050 God 5050 the world and it becomes a big beautiful blend that's nickol lism that's lady oan ISM and that's what we've got to overcome we've got to overcome lady oia we've got to overcome the natural expression of our human nature in our life as John said herein is the love of God made perfect that he as he is so are we in this world so now Titus Paul's telling Titus to start to instruct the people and why is he instructing the people because what the people's actions are are an expression and we we'd like just to bring this out if if you you get a chance to read him he's talking to him avoid the crans avoid their their this they're that they're lazy they're they're all these things he's warning them what do he War don't let their attitude their way of life their complacency the spirit in which they do things don't let that spirit get on you because if it does you will not express the true reality of what it means to be born again and you know something a Christian never has to worry there's no virtue in worry there's no strength in worry if you got sick what what are you going to do worry you're going to die to die is gain it's victory we pass from this life to another it it it it it it's not the end of it it's a change death isn't the finish of anything is the change of One Life to another brother Mary just changed from the life he had here the years allotted him here to the rest of time that was allotted to him he was in he was where where were you when the sons of God rejoiced before the foundation of the world it's hard for you to believe that you were it that you were rejoicing you were there because when if God thought it it's real but you didn't know it just like you were in the loins of your father you were in your mother you you were in your father but you didn't know it until you showed up now you showed up in this little space of time but this little space of time is not what you are you're more than that you're bigger than that you have a bigger expression than that amen we don't have to just Express the the carnal side of Our Lives why don't we express the Eternal side of Our Lives the Eternal reality that we possess all we do is Express this dumb flesh 50 years ago you think that would be hard for me to put on my socks I could stand my socks up and jump out of bed and land right in my socks and now my arms have got short and my feet have got far away and I bend over and I'm groaning get my back stiff and my knee won't come up I got something SC stuck in between my knee and my foot and and andless he'll get so upset she says you want me to put help put your socks I'm for you she got such sympathy for me I don't you think this is what I want to express uh I got a new man coming I got a new body hallelujah hallelujah this ain't me this Old Rag is is gone but I've got one waiting for me he's young and handsome well maybe I'm old and ugly but one day I'm going to be young and handsome praise God so let's just take our lesson this morning and and grow because our Messengers taught us so many of these things he's thought he's saying now he said let's re read 1 and 16 as we go through they Pro they profess that they know God but in works and but in Works they deny him being abominable and disobedient unto every good work reprobate so right now he's saying that even though they profess they know God their their expression proves otherwise you can say you're saved but if you're miserable you ain't saved when you're saved you can say life is miserable my body is miserable but inside the joy Bells Are Ringing Hallelujah even so come quickly Lord Jesus if if when you know him he's all your glory so you you don't have to prove the man you're wealthy you don't have to prove the man you're successful you you know what I mean I always thought in my day there was a guy called the I guess he was the the the M Sha of Aran or whatever he was he he had a hospital he every place he flew he he brought a complete hospital he had a 747 I guess was the biggest plane in that day full surgical operating room with every medicine full team of heart specialists internal Med down special every place he went he had a score of doctors and nurses where do you think he is today he's dead as a door now you think he's going to change that he wanted to stay we don't want to stay we want to go but we need to express to the world there's a place to go to if if you're living miserable then it just shows you that you don't believe there's something better coming so what we're talking about is becoming conscious of our expression don't forget Titus let us read but speak thou the things which becometh sound Doctrine speak those things which becometh sound Doctrine he's talking about expression that the Aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience because if they do these things they're expressing something the Aged woman likewise that they be in Behavior as becoming becometh Holiness not false accusers not given too much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young woman to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet ch Cas keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed do you see lacking these things was an expression and really what they were expressing is blasphemed to God you know we we preach these things like law oh you sisters you better be obedient to your husbands well you know sometimes your husbands you know you're just plain smarter than they are oh I hope that didn't offend any of you gorillas that's not why they're obedient they they they want to express that they have a greater head head it's an expression of not blaspheming God they're chased they're obedient they're keepers of home they do their Duty why because they're expressing something they're expressing their Revelation they're expressing their position they're expressing their place it's beautiful expression but if you're not doing these things it doesn't matter what you're professing your expression is greater than your profession he says young men likewise exhort to be sober minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of Good Works in Doctrine showing uncorrupt gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you wow this is this what I'm saying don't forget Titus these are all Paul telling Titus what to tell the people that they might Express really what Christianity is about I just love that sound speech that cannot that that's the Titus himself sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you so you don't tangle with them exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not pering but showing all good Fidelity that they may adore Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things I'm going to return back to that scripture in just a moment for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that they deny ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ everybody should know that we're looking for that appearing we're not looking for our payche we're not looking for our retirement we're not looking for our social security we're looking looking for that soon return of our great Lord and Savior it expresses out of you if you have it Satan might knock you down but you'll that expression will rise back up and it'll it'll take hold in your life who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works so these are all this is this again is is Paul speaking to Titus letting him know what the true expression is what a real believer should be feeling what he should be thinking what what's important to him to be on H EST not to be caught up in the things of the world not not not to you know a good soldier doesn't entangle himself in the things of the world so his whole life becomes an expression of the fact that he's looking for that great and glorious appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ you should be able they should be able to read that Amen in fact so much so the scripture tells us that men should inquire of us what is the hope that you have I mean if you you sit down with somebody and boy you know oh I don't have enough money in my retirement and uh you know man you leave that place depressed really wouldn't you like to sit down with a guy says man one day Hallelujah I'm going to be caught out of here this body's going to be changed I got a mansion waiting on the hillside I've Got a Mansion Just Over the hillt in that bright City where I'll never grow old man you look at that guy and you say that guy's Rich the guy looks at you that guy don't have a dime well he's got something don't God besides he came to the poor of this world rich in faith he came to the poor of this world rich in faith think of it rich in the knowledge of the things of God and what God thinks see this is what's happened to us is we've got a doctrinal message with all truths and all doctrines but our very atmosphere and our very attitude and the way we take on our daily challenges speaks louder than what we're professing when When We complain and we we we get grumpy and and everything bothers us then then it it doesn't matter what we believe we're not expressing we're not conveying what we really feel what's really in our heart we're not really conveying what God's done for us and and when the message M loses that the whole point of this message was that God opened things to us that should have a profound effect on us that we were predestinated that's a that that we were in his thinking that it was by his election he choosing those aren't doctrinal issues that we want to sit down and argue the church with the Church of Christ or or the Baptist or the Methodist those are things that were revealed to us that we can express the love of God because that's what the Holy Spirit does it expresses the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit it it it becomes glorious that's what it done it's it allows you despite the religious persecution despite the political pressure Des despite the financial atmosphere it allows you to stand up and say praise God I'm going home I'm elected my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life he's called me to be his bride I've got the wedding band of predestin on me [Music] Hallelujah without that expression this message is dead it's word only it's a doctrinal fight I'm better than you that's why I said we ought to put a sign out front it says this we're right in everybody else's wrong Tabernacle they should be drawn by the hope you have they should be affected by the expression that's coming out of your heart and your life and I'm preaching to myself this morning not like I'm some beautiful angel Paul says I'm the chiefest of all Sinners and need the greatest to overcome but it doesn't change the word of God just like brother Stefan that preacher from abene you know he brother stepan sits down they're they're eating a brother comes over he visits with brother Stephan just for a little bit he's so moved that he reaches all the way out from abalene to talk to me why because there was something expressed he could see it in the clothing he could see it in the manner of eating he could see it when his head was bowed to pray he knew that but when he went and he made contact with the hope when he went contact with the excitement of the revelation of God's word he knew he didn't possess that he knew what he was in and what he belonged to and what he was a part of lacked the Eternal expression of God's love and we'll never draw anybody cuz what you'll get is you'll get intellect and if somebody could change their thinking to put them in here somebody else could change their thinking to take them out and alls it is is a that's what the scripture says they go from Pillar To Post they're like ships without anchor they're driven hither by this wind or that wind or by every wind of Doctrine because they don't have anything to express you ever argue with somebody do you ever me an arguer I've me arguers you they'll take a side and you start giving your side and they give their side if you switch they'll switch to your side there's no they don't want to accomplish anything there's no there's no goal I just want to have a big old discussion like me calling up Billy hey Billy let's meet for breakfast let's argue a little while what do you want to argue about today well what side do you want to take CU I'm an arguer I'll take the other side and they just go at it people go at it in their life their whole life is going at it they're arguing with life they're arguing with this situation they're arguing with that situation they're arguing with this atmosphere they're arguing about the restaurant I've been to restaurants where the waitresses are are absolutely trying to think of a nice word they are so unqualified so inapp they can't even make the smallest decision they can't remember your request two feet from the table you going to what are you going to do you going to argue with it you going to chew them out you going to get into a big conflict what does that express it expresses that you're unhappy with life and you're so unhappy that they make you unhappy you don't be nice start off being nice say something nice Hi how are you today doing good today everything's good you know you might get them to serve you better you can have effect what verse were we on all right all right then then we'll we'll just go there these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee and I I was going to continue reading but I want to stop there because I want to drop back just for a moment here to the 10th verse in closing this morning this is the end we've come to the end of our year and this has been quite a year it's been the year we moved into this building we've had baptisms and uh we've had marriages and and there there comes a time that that we look back we're about to finish I don't know if we'll finish this year it was my goal but to finish the Pavilion and and our storage and and E and then we'll it'll go from building to maintaining and uh then you know my life changes significantly and uh so I've been longing for the end of this year been fiveyear journey two years to get it through the city April 1st when we had our first Sunday meeting here in the church that was one year from the day we poured concrete and you know we'd walk through it and and and you know and you You' seen it transformed and Matthew did a beautiful job on the Landscaping which I apologized for him for tearing up but and and now we're going to have a nice place back there and pretty soon for you to sit under we have picnic tables we can put out and store and and a lot of things that they're all here to make life we've got Sunday school rooms that we didn't have before and we got places for young people and facilities and and and different things it's it's been a long journey but you know when you comes time that your expression changes your life changes and you move forward and and as a church I this is my heart's desire is that all of our lives lives start expressing the hope that we have and this is Paul's instruction here in the 10th verse he starts he says exort servants to be obedient to their own masters is don't we call ourselves Servants of the Lord and to please them well in all things not answering again you know that that's gain saying you know gain saying is where you always answer back you know you know you ever you ever be with people that you want to do a certain thing a certain way and it ain't two seconds they've got their their way of doing it well I think we ought to do it this way and then the other guy he thinks he ought to do it that way you know and pretty soon you're sitting back you guys think I'm a dummy you might do it that way I know how to do it cheaper and faster but you can't get involved in gain saying you say okay do it the way you want to do it just get it done right he's telling the servants don't gainsay you know don't fuss don't argue with everything don't argue with life Life Church don't argue with Life Is Life Fair no but we're not part of this life this is not our life you understand our purpose is to do something and Paul and Titus now expresses this so beautifully in this verse he says not pining purloining is I'm I'm probably not pronouncing that right that is to take away from something it it's it's it it it is attached to stealing but you know you take away from something if somebody does something and they maybe they they decorate and you come in and you look at they say oh you could have done this or they could have done that or why didn't they do this why did they use this color why didn't they use that color you know someone puts on a new suit and and and you don't like their Turtle tie well I like my turtle tie if you want to argue about me with my turtle tie you know what I mean that's okay but they they they they prolong you know they always tear it down they always drop it to a lower level they they they're they're they're they're stuck in taking away so he's telling the servants don't take away from things don't run your master down don't take away he's also saying don't steal from them don't take advantage of them you know don't don't do that that that that is that that don't prolong he said he says so listen to what he says this is beautiful and he says but show good Fidelity you know when you Fidelity means good service good works good do a good job go the extra mile because there's something that is taking place whether you know it or not whether you're aware of it or not when you don't PR does somebody know how to pronounce that word correctly am I okay with it okay so when when you don't don't do that it's not part of your nature to always find the fault to always take away from something to to always add your two cents you you know what I mean oh she plays the piano good but she just misses that sea huh you know or or it's just too loud it's it's not this it's not that and you you you be you become you're absolutely you you change the direction and the focus of what's transpiring and and Titus is pointing this out he Paul's pointing these things out to Titus Titus say went decree to build a Church to Adorn El Elders to have the purpose of the Believers expressing that they're looking for the Glorious appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ don't forget Titus the book of expression and then he says this not poining but showing all facility that they may Adorn the do of God our savior in all things you know what adorn means and I thought of that Christmas you said this a Christmas message yeah it's a Christmas message because this is the time that we Adorn we Adorn our houses right we put lights on them we put we put Reefs on them we We Lay Garland on and we Adorn our homes and and and you drive down the street and everybody's live what are they trying to do they're trying to make their house more attractive trying to make it stand out more because it's Christmas we we Adorn our trees and and put lights in our trees some people have Christmas trees some people have nativity scenes but but they Adorn it they they're they're trying to add attraction to make it more attractive to make it more beautiful to attract people to the season to the message they're they're trying to Adorn it it it it's it's to uh make it uh more beautiful or more attractive more lifted up and and so this is the season that everybody adorns everything you get a package somebody gave me a gift now I know inside that gift there's a box and if they would have just given me the box I would have got the gift just the same but they adorned it they wrapped it in paper and they put a bow on it and they made it look more attractive and More Beautiful they they had let they made it appear as a present as a gift they were expressing a Feeling or a thought I hope it's not deodorant but but uh uh but you know what I'm saying it's that now so he's telling us He's listed all these things tell the fathers to do this tell the mothers to do this tell the young men to do this tell the young ladies do this he's giving a whole list of behavior because he knows that that expression is going to make God more attractive to make the doctrines of God more beautiful because they can see the expression of what they believe being made manifest number one purpose of Christianity is to bring glory to the Lord Jesus Christ in in all things to the doctrine of God in all things and we've used the doctrines of William brandham as a substitute for real pure Christianity and you know I believe in the prophet of God and I'm not going to run him down I'm not going to say he made mistakes I believe everything was a purpose as a man he may have done things I don't know about I'm sure he's repented of many things but when when it comes to the word of God it was the unadulterated gospel but but we've lost what it is we're expressing the message is in war this group's blasting this group and that group's blasting that group I don't care what somebody wants to preach preach if they want to preach the raptures the cow sitting on the moon and the people want to sit there and listen to it praise God there my brothers and sister as for me and my house we want to serve the Lord we want to express the Lord Jesus Christ we want our actions our attitudes our motives our objections the words that come out of our mouth to Adorn the doctrine of our father to make it more attractive to make it more beautiful but when you prong and you are infidelity and and can you you you have a half attitude and a terrible approach and and you're miserable boy someone just wants what you got how did you get so miserable I've just been wanting to be be that miserable all my life no you know why I'm happy because one day the Lord showed me a pillar of fire came and that the Lord Jesus himself veiled himself in a man that in our generation the Gentile age Jesus came and put on a different robe imor a different appearance there was no difference between this ministry and the ministry of Jesus Christ except for the Corporal body and he used this man to express his love Amen to express his power to express his wisdom to express the hour we live in the time the expression that brother brandom expressed was eternal so it doesn't matter what the calendar says the expression was eternal so it'll be the same for ages to come if this world lasts 300 years the expression that God expressed through William Brandon will remain the same because it came from the beginning of the world it is Alpha and Omega it's the beginning and the end you can never take the light out of it and alls we're trying to do is take the flesh out of it and I hate to say it but too many men are trying to put the flesh back in it you can't take the deity out of this message because then you got a human expression and a human expression leads to misery you know why they're fighting beating down prolonging one another arguing with one another fighting for influence trying to start movements in the church trying to get people to go the way they are you know what we need to return we need to return back to the prayer closet we need to get back and let the love of God and the baptism of the Holy Spirit fill our beings again it's your way it's not the whole church World waking up in the morning it's you waking up in the morning it's your day it's your hour this is the day of your salvation this is the day you praise God this is the day you share what's in your heart with the rest of the world to Adorn to make more attractive to make more beneficial to make more beautiful the doctrine of God our savior in all things the doctrine of God our savior our Doctrine is Jesus Christ and when we go forward I preached last week we got weaknesses and I I had pages of human weaknesses but Jesus was God's gift to every weakness and how beautiful if we could go to go forward in the beauty of his likeness and the beauty of his Glory you say brother McGary I want more Doctrine though you understand all Mysteries and you speak with tongues of men and angels and have not a love in your heart that can be expressed then we are nothing so you say what's our clothes we've had had a tough year toughest year I've probably been in lost my mom uh uh uh a tough year but you know what I don't want to let a tough here ruin my expression I want to go back and in my heart make a rededication of saying Lord I'm going to reexamine what my life is expressing does my life Express that I'm displeased with my children or I'm displeased with my station in life I'm displeased with lesie can you imagine me walking through oh I wish lesie was a better cook I wish lesie didn't spend so much money I wish lesie wouldn't do this and I wish lesie wouldn't do that oh wouldn't you just want to get married that'd be terrible of course I don't have a right to do it I I would be lying but what what is it is that we want to express they'll know that you are Christians by your love one for another they'll know you are my disciples but how you express your feelings and thoughts one to another I want to Adorn this message I want to Adorn this message I want to make the doctrines of this message beautiful I want to make the doctrines and this life of this word more attractive how can I do that by examining and becoming aware of what it is that I'm expressing and my deepest apologies if through my weariness in my human flesh I've ever expressed to you anything other than the fact that I'm a sinner saved by grace and God's goodness shared a portion of his spirit with me and I love you and I want to say to you and help express to you the things that'll help you get to the kingdom of heaven so this year this week this going forward let's realize that we're put here like the tree like the seed to express the life that God put in that seed and let's let's have a year of expression getting rid of the bad expressions and letting the good Expressions come into our heart God bless you we've had a wonderful year a hard year we've accomplished much we've done a lot of great things and and so just remember if you want a fellowship just don't wait don't stand in the forer a lot but you can just move right down the hall and go visit in the fellowship hall of course it's beautiful outside
