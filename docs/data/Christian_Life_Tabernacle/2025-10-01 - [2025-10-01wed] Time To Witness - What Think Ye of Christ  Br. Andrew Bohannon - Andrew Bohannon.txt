It's not going to fade away. And Lord, we can look to it to have confidence, Father, in times that are uncertain, Lord. And where man's hearts are failing and there's things that just would confound this mind, Father. We're more sure than any other people, Lord, where we're standing and the hour we're in and the day and age that we're in. And Father, we're thankful for that tonight. And Lord, as we're gathered, Lord, we're not just going to let this be another service, Father, but we're pressing, Lord, into you, Lord. There's needs we have in our hearts, Father. And we're inviting your presence. And Lord, where you are, there's good things, Father. And Lord, Satan can't stand against us. Lord, as two or three, we come and Father, we agree on any one thing we could have, what we would ask for, Father. And we're asking that you'd move in a mighty way in this service, Lord. That you'd start now just to take us beyond these carnal realms, Father. And Lord, draw us and make us aware we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Father, our position as sons and daughters of God to have your favor, Lord, to know that you love us. And Lord, you're mindful of the needs that we have. And Lord, this could be the last opportunity that we could even have to gather together. And Lord, we want to take full advantage of it, Lord. And Lord, I'm asking, Lord, that you'd forgive me, Father, of anything that would hinder, Lord. And Lord, each one, we plead the blood of Jesus Christ. And Lord, we ask, God, that you would just come and be pleased to move amongst your people. Lord, we've set this place aside for you. And Lord, we've dedicated it unto you. And Lord, there's many who've made an effort to be here tonight. And Father, we know you're going to be faithful. Lord, we can't outgive you. So come, Lord, have your will and way in this service.

We certainly thank the Lord for that. Amen. Brother David Kanku has a uh he has a special tonight. Right after that, Sister Sarah will bring hers. Amen. God bless you, man. I um help me God. I just wanted to share a testimony. Uh I've been going through some transition at work and you know I've met quite a lot of smart people you know in the field that I work in you meet them and you meet people that says you know I've passed this many tests I have this many certification to make it wherever I am at but I'm not one of those people you know because probably not as smart as they are and you know it has been just a blessing to be in the journey that I'm in but the testimony is as of the last two weeks we've been trying to deploy some changes and I haven't been able to sleep I've just been under stress because I work in a team that I'm just me myself in the position I was working in the company as a contractor and then it got to a time where It was last week to the very brink the weekend. So right after that weekend the contract ended and I have to get back in the job market or I have to apply somewhere else to work at a McDonald or whatever. You know I'm not that big for McDonald's. I will apply and work. But I was crying in my heart with my wife. We were just praying you know that the Lord open a way. Up until that last week, believe we had uh we had one of our moms at home. My wife was doing her hair and the manager calls me and says, "David, we didn't have a position. We don't even have a position for you in the company. We didn't have this position, but we're going to create one just for you." Uh I don't I don't I don't know you know when you share it sounds so good but you know going through that process it's very you know the strain the stress and he just looks at me says no we just created it for you and they gave me exactly the offer that me and my wife prayed for &gt;&gt; before leaving North Dakota from the beginning I was like from for this amount we'll pack everything right to the numbers. I tried to debate a little bit. Can you you know just be a little selfish but it was like this is really we just this is a miracle. It's even have to be approved. I was just like, I'll take it, you know. And then I I didn't want to show like it was too much, but it was. [Applause] And then as of the last two weeks in that very position, I ran into a roadblock. Something that I didn't understand how to do. Neither did my boss or anybody. They didn't think it was possible. So, they just give it to me so I can spend these two weeks in Spain. And you know we were praying one night we were supposed to go to the the house where we go minister and one night they asked me to work overnight all the way. So from the morning all the way from 8 to 6:00 a.m. in the morning to maintain you know things that are going in production and I just was crying. My wife was praying for me. It's going to be okay. God will help you. And one day just messing around with the code, I just put things that I didn't even know where I got it from. And then it worked. My manager came by. I was like, because I've spoken to him about the prophet. He knows the prophet, but he just believes what he saw online about him. I was like, "Hey, look, I know you know about God, but David didn't do it. God did this one." you know, and I've been I was trying to sing the song, you know, hold to God's unchanging hands, but we sing it already, so I have to find another one. Um, just to say thank you. This song, I I wrote it when I was going through a lot of hard time, you know, a few years back. Just reminds me of the grace of God. [Music] [Music] Gio Gio down [Music] Giovan [Music] Gio. Gio, you the Lord, you're my provider. Jehovah Shalom. Jehovah Shalom. Jehovah Shalom. Blow. You are my peace [Music] in time of need. [Music] Gio [Music] in time of need.

Jehovah Shalom. The Lord [Music] who is my peace. Amen. God bless you. [Music] Oh. all want their lives to count for something to leave them more. Life is through, but vain pursuit [Music] will count for nothing. Time will grace [Music] whatever we do. And I want my life to count for Jesus. [Music] For earthly things will quickly fade. [Music] No need to bow to worldly treasures. [Music] God only see [Music] eternal gain. [Music] Inside my heart [Music] there burns a question. What was I placed on earth? here for. He truly wants to build a kingdom not of my own but of the Lord. And I want my life to count for Jesus. For earthly things will quickly fade. No need to [Music] to worldly riches, but only [Music] seek [Music] eternal gain. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Praise the Lord. Enjoy the special and the testimony. Amen. Want to put him first. Amen. I want to say this. It's good to say that he's a Lord, but it's wonderful when you can say he's my Lord. It's good to say he's a provider, but it's good to say he's my provider. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's nothing wrong with say that he's a provider, but we want that relationship to grow to each one of us can see here tonight and say, "He's my provider and he's my Lord." Amen. That's our heart's desire, man. Sister Sarah writes a testimony here. I'd like to thank the Lord for healing Isabelle. And they said she uh she had a accident riding a bicycle and her face hit the concrete. Her mouth and the gum and the teeth were hurt. Uh but we prayed the Lord stopped the bleeding and all is well now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Want to continue to remember the Tokco family. It's a family in Colorado. They were here last uh this year, I believe, for uh youth meeting and uh the brother at lost a son. It was mentioned last Sunday. Uh brother Andrew will be going this weekend to minister to them and we just pray that the Lord will comfort the heart. It was a young man uh just a teenager. We pray that the Lord will certainly uh touch their hearts. Amen. They're really going through a difficult time. Amen. If you have a need upon your heart tonight, did you just lift your hand up to him and and your need? Amen. We we we just heard the testimonies of what he's done and we believe that he's here to do the same. Amen. His desire is that each one of us will come to the knowledge of him the same way that we'll know who the riches and the greatness of what he can do in our lives. The brothers that are taking the offerings, if you could come, brother Serge, if you could just come and take the needs before the church. Amen. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we are thankful Lord for your grace, your mercy, Lord. Father, we certainly know that you are our provider Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes.

And we believe every promise in your word, Lord. Father, we pray that whatever the needs of your people are that you may provide them, Lord. Father God, if anybody needs healing, Lord, give them healing, Lord. If anybody needs peace, give them peace, Lord.

And if anyone needs a job, Lord, provide it for them. If anyone needs a home, a house, provide it for them, Lord. If if anybody needs a car, provide it for them, Lord.

There is a in times of need. Oh, and that gives me hope. Oh, that brings me pain. Oh, in every trial, through every test. Oh, and my Savior stands in my face. Oh, and when the Lord ted, all your strength is lost. And your heart feels so [Music] th is greater than the soul. Take courage. Your battle is alone. Oh, and when the waters run, oh, he calls my name. Oh [Music] my go [Music] and he makes me stand out on the water. [Music] Hallelujah. God [Music] is remember God is greater than your soul.

[Music] When the waters rise, he's cross [Applause] and he [Music] holds my hand [Music] Yes, I should alter and it makes me stand out on the water. You are you tire [Music] and your heart is strong. He's gone. Take her. The battle is the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you take courage knowing that the battle is the Lord's? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's does something good to my heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because we're definitely in a battle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, there's some battles, some traps laid before you this even tonight &gt;&gt; to keep you from coming here &gt;&gt; because God wanted to meet you here. God has something special for you tonight. &gt;&gt; And God is a living God. He's not some historical something, &gt;&gt; but he knows your need. &gt;&gt; He knows where you're at. He knows the season. And he's provided a way &gt;&gt; for you to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord. How many are happy to be here &gt;&gt; in his presence there's fullness of joy. We can just shake off the heavy bands. Just realize one of these days and one of these days soon, we're going to be out of here. No more struggle, no more sorrow, no more heartache, no more devil trying to ruin us, trying to discourage us, trying to keep our head down. But oh my, let's lift up our heads tonight. &gt;&gt; Let's let our hearts be encouraged. &gt;&gt; It's not because I'm trying to work you up. It's a reality to the believer. It's a pulsation. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; He certainly loves us. Amen. And if you have a special need, why don't we just go to him in prayer? And oh, I just, you know, I'm longing for Lord to touch our sister Joy that she can be back here playing violin. And we know that our sisters, you know, overcoming that blood pressure. And you just remember those that you know have a need, our brother John's mom and the different ones. If if you don't have a need that you know of, why don't we just lift up these these requests before the Lord and say, "God, will you touch my heart? Will you touch these needs?" Let's pray together. Precious heavenly father. Lord, it's it's an honor and a privilege to be able to stand by your grace in your presence, Lord, and be able to talk it over with you, Lord, and say how much we appreciate, Lord, the life you gave, Lord. Thank you for Calvary, Lord. Thank you for your goodness upon our lives, Lord. We, oh God, we don't see many times how we would deserve a love like this, but Lord, in our hearts, we just say thank you, Lord. Lord, and we're lifting up, oh God, your people, Lord, our pastor, the needs of your people, Lord. You see the hands lifted, Lord. You see the secret need, Lord. Let your word come, oh God, and give revelation, Lord. Lord, it's been taught by your prophet. There's nothing that gives more prevailing power over the devil than revelation. So, we're asking God, you'd give us revelation tonight as we commit your people, Lord, take these words and the simple thought, Lord, and may it be multiplied. And Lord, may we draw closer to you, Lord. And may we get closer to you, Lord, to do what's pleasing, Father. We're committing it all to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Well, I have something the Lord's put on my heart and by the help of the Lord, we'll deliver our burden and we'll go rejoicing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh if you have your Bibles, we can go right to the word of God. Thank you for the songs. Wonderful testimony and uh uh what what a wonderful atmosphere that has been created. You know, God, he heals by music. Amen. &gt;&gt; God heals by his word. God heals by promise. &gt;&gt; God heals. &gt;&gt; God's a healer. Amen. We're thankful for that. So, in First Corinthians, we're going to read a familiar scripture. And maybe I'll just uh maybe tell you a little bit of what's on my heart, but I just believe that it's time to witness, you know, and that's that's the title of my thought this evening is time to witness. You know, we heard our brother testify, and you know, in this world, you know, there's there's a treasure that's in earthn vessels, and it's in each one of you. When you've contacted the Lord Jesus, and the spirit of truth has come on to you, you have a treasure that's hidden within your vessel. And so, we want to witness to the world. And I say it's time to witness. Amen. And I'm drawing inspiration from a message called What You Think of Christ. I listened to it a number of times this uh week. And uh it just inspired me and I I feel in many ways I'm I'm just having a revival because of Calvary. And uh and that's what we all desire for each one of you and for each other. And so there in 1 Corinthians chapter 2, we're going to read verse one. The scripture reading says this. I and I brethren when I came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God. Amen. You may have your seat. You know, I think this is a wonderful thought that our prophet Paul, you know, though he could have come with with the wisdom of man being raised up uh under Galia, he was taught all of the law and different things. But yet he said this that when I come to you, I come not with excellency of speech or wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. You know, Paul gave a witness and a testimony of God. And you know, I I just feel in my heart as our pastor's been, you know, going down this line about the path forward. And part of the the path forward is is the commission. And, you know, God has given us a power and he's given us a new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's to carry out the commission. And so, part of the burden uh that we want to come behind is what's on our pastor's heart. And so I just think about, you know, the great revelations of the message of the hour, the serpent seed, the seals, the church ages, seeing the horse riders come through and all that. You know, a lot of that can be so fundamental in its its teaching. And and we can get where when we're witnessing to people, it's a lot of knowledge to people. But I just want uh to focus here and just maybe um just say this. There's a way to witness. Amen. And I believe that God wants to reveal it more and more by this end time message. And so, you know, I just I'm saying this from a personal experience. And so, when I preach the word, please, if the shoe fits, you can wear it, too. But I've already put it on and I've already seen the way the Lord's dealing with me. And um a lot of times you just feel so short when God opens something up. But you know, hey, we got the grace of God. And if you don't have a well man in front of you that you're walking towards a perfect man, then I say call upon God for revelation. &gt;&gt; We need revelation because where we're at, God's calling us higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so don't take this personal, but take it that you can take it to heart, &gt;&gt; right? So, so if it starts getting scratchy on your flesh, well, then that's okay. You know what? That's the way that God deals with his children. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, "For I have determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified." &gt;&gt; Well, I'm telling you, there's so many things that we could know. &gt;&gt; There's so much knowledge in the world. We can know about Facebook. We can know about the AI. We can know about schools and all of this stuff, right? But I believe what Paul was getting at is that once you receive a revelation of who Jesus Christ is and who he is in you, you make a determination like he said, "I am determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified." You know, when we start knowing about certain people's problems or problems in the church, problems in in politics, all of these problems, we start knowing and then we start testifying of those things. We start talking about those things. And Paul's saying here, I believe, he says, "I'm determined not to know nothing. I don't want to know none of that." &gt;&gt; I want to know what Christ has for me. I want to know what Christ has for you. And I know when he died on the cross of Calvary, he came to loose you of sin. He's came to heal you. He's came to bring deliverance. He's came to give you comfort. He came to give you counsel. He came to give you instruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what our prophet Paul did for us. &gt;&gt; He started recognizing. He's saying, "Look, I'm determined. I'm, you know, I'm a witness of this." &gt;&gt; He can know a bunch of things about religion and about church order and about, you know, a lot of things. But hey, you know what? I've come in contact with somebody who turned my world around. &gt;&gt; I was on my high horse and I was going one way, but when I met him, he turned my whole world around. &gt;&gt; And it's because Jesus Christ was crucified. He never met him in the flesh. It was after he went to the cross. He was buried and rose again. &gt;&gt; And then he knew him when he returned back to the pillar of fire. But he made contact. And when he had that personal contact, then he's given this revelation &gt;&gt; to the church. Oh, I love that so much. He said, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling." I can identify with that right now. &gt;&gt; Knowing that every word that I say, I'll have to give an account. You know, that's that's the same thing that you as just going to work, just going to school, the people that you talk to, &gt;&gt; God is going to he's he's given a record. &gt;&gt; We every time we do something or say something, it's going on a record. But it doesn't have to be the negative. If we become that yielded vessel that the spirit of God is moving and it's the spirit of truth that's guiding us. Amen. Oh, I'm so thankful for that. He says, "My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." Well, don't put your faith in man. &gt;&gt; Man, if you put your faith in man, God will cause that man to do something in your eyes that makes you stumble. &gt;&gt; You don't want to put people in the church offices or even your neighbor or your boss in a position that you're elevating them above Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Christ of God in your heart. Let's exalt Christ. &gt;&gt; Glorify the God in you. The one who's made the difference. The one who's broke the shackles. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to lift up my sickness. I'm going to lift up my God who by his stripes I'm healed. He laid his life down. No man take my life from me. I lay it down because he knew you were going to need that. He was going to be a comfort to you in your time of distress. &gt;&gt; When you were weary, he came and he comforted you. I I'm with you &gt;&gt; even in you till the very end. &gt;&gt; Oh my my well in 16 it says this for we for who hath the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, this is a great comfort to know Paul's given the revelation. You have the mind of Christ. The mind of Christ has been revealed in all of the secrets of God's plan of redemption, restoration has all been made known. You know, in the three-fold mystery of God revealed, God was going to reveal himself in Christ and then Christ was going to restore the Eden. But he had to get preeminence first. So that threefold mystery plan of God is unfolding right before our eyes. You are a partaker of that. God is wanting so much to reveal himself who he is. Not just who he is in the past, but who he is in the present. &gt;&gt; You know, we could see the manifestation of Malachi 4. We can see the manifestation of Luke 17. We can see the cloud, the witness. But what about the witness for you and me? &gt;&gt; This is a time to witness. &gt;&gt; What God has done for you? &gt;&gt; It's so powerful. &gt;&gt; Even if you feel like it's just this big, if God did it, it's huge. &gt;&gt; If God did a work in your life, tell somebody. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. You talk about getting the joy bells ringing in your life. The moment that you start testifying and telling of what God did for you, all of a sudden you get lighter in your feet. &gt;&gt; All of the sudden that you possess that ground twice. You're like, man, I'm taking it back. You know, &gt;&gt; my praise the Lord. Maybe in Matthew, we'll read in Matthew 22, and this is the uh scripture that brother Brandham reads when he preached this message. What ye what think ye of Christ? But in Matthew 22 says this in verse 41 and 42. He says, "While the Pharisees gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying, what think ye of Christ, whose son is he?" They they say unto him, "The son of David?" You know, and and uh I was listening to that message and I tell you, it was so wonderful the different uh witnesses that came through in that message. But you know, I I desire that our church prosper. I desire that our church, every single member of this church, people who call this their church home, would be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and they they would feel the joy bells of the resurrection. Now, &gt;&gt; I I you know, I don't want anybody to fall short of what God's provided in this end time to have the hope of the resurrection and a soon rapture. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not going to beat around the bush. I'm asking for big things tonight. &gt;&gt; I desire and I it's my earnest expectation. &gt;&gt; So, if you feel like you're kind of on the the sidelines, get ready &gt;&gt; because I've been praying and I've been seeking the Lord. I'm I'm desiring this because we need you. We need you on the the battlefront. &gt;&gt; We have to come into the unity of the faith so we can get out of here. &gt;&gt; This is um preached in 1957 on March 3rd. He says, and this is maybe paragraph two. I'm not exactly sure. But he says, "While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying, "What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he?" And they said unto him, "The son of David?" He said, now in this paragraph, he says, "Today I was trying to get this afternoon about a watch." So, brother Brandon was preaching a previous service talking about a watch. And I love how just in the simplicity of just an interaction with something in his life, he's able to take spiritual types. You know, I think that if you and I will be observant, God is trying to speak to us in this kind of way in our everyday life. if we'll just be mindful because God wants to speak and he wants to reveal, &gt;&gt; right, where we're at, the season of life that we're at. Not just in our homes, not just in business, not just in work, but where we're at in a church and where we're at as a world, &gt;&gt; right? We don't want just the days to click on and not be a part of what God's doing. Amen. We want to be in on the inside, &gt;&gt; you know, looking out, not on the outside looking in. Right? And that takes a new birth. that takes personal contact. Amen. But he was talking about that main spring, you know, and that main spring that that you know, we got some a watch maker in here, maybe two, and so they can tell you about or he could tell you about all of the parts that go into a watch, &gt;&gt; right? But within that watch, it will not tell time if that main spring is not working. And and we won't know where we're at in time if we're not feeding on this word. If we don't get filled with the Holy Ghost. If we don't get down on our knees and pray for our loved ones, for our our children and believe this word. &gt;&gt; We're not going to be able to tell time. &gt;&gt; We want that main spring on the inside &gt;&gt; to be active, living, and moving. &gt;&gt; That's right. We can't make it happen, but we can ask &gt;&gt; and we can tell God he promised it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, now he said that little mainspring in the watch, which makes all of the watches what it is. I I don't mean to be rude. They only meant to show a picture of the condition of the church. We're trying to show the people of this fine case that it's got the watch 14 karat. Some of them are unbreakable face. &gt;&gt; Now he's just telling the details of a watch, you know, 14 karat unbreakable face. It's all jeweled up. It's got different parts of it. A watch, right? And so we might be able to show the people what fine face it has on it, what fine hands it has on it, and even the little jewels on the inside. But with all of the fine mechanic mechanics of the watch, it is no value to you for time except it has a main spring that makes all of those things work together to keep time. Today the church is trying to show their big fine buildings, their 14 karat cases and such of them and some of them an unbreakable face. And many times they're trying to tell of the rubies that they have, the gifts of the church. They're all right. There's nothing wrong with them things. And when I'm trying to explain or speak of the different gifts in the church and how yet everybody seems, not everybody, pardon me, but many seem to be defeated while they have these gifts. &gt;&gt; It isn't because the gifts no good. It's because the main springs isn't moving in the right way. &gt;&gt; So the gifts is not the problem. &gt;&gt; It's the main spring. We want to be right in our heart with God. &gt;&gt; If there's things that are wrong, let's make them right. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I really believe that if the love of God is in your heart and your heart is right with God, the mainspring will work. But the devil is putting little snares and traps and he's very tricky and he tries to snare us &gt;&gt; to make that impurity to where it doesn't work right. &gt;&gt; But we have the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; He says you might shake it and make it tick a little times, but the main spring keeps it ticking all the time and makes it operate perfectly. You know there's a perfection that a believer can to obtain to in his heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A perfect man &gt;&gt; says now many times you can say I can't do much about it. The condition condition today I I already feel like maybe most of us was feeling like that when I was reading that quote because I feel it. But I I want to encourage you with the rest of the quote. Now many times you could say I can't do very much about that the condition today but just one kind word to someone &gt;&gt; an invitation a little testimony a little kind smile &gt;&gt; or a greeting to a passer by might mean more than you think it does. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's little &gt;&gt; my take courage, saints. &gt;&gt; It's time to be bold with our faith. &gt;&gt; It's time to go in action. It's time to witness what God has done for you. There's people and I'm I'm kind of feeling like I'm running long because I wanted to get somewhere and now I'm taking a lot of time doing but I'm thankful for the Lord's presence and and I feel good. So I I did want to play about 20 minutes of a tape and then maybe make a comment. But I feel to lay this in here as we're listening to this portion of tape. It's about 22 minutes. I want you to recognize what brother Brandham is talking about this question within this question holds a decision for every single one of us and you cannot bypass it. It's something that every single human being in this building at the sound of his voice and now my voice, &gt;&gt; you are going to be responsible for a decision &gt;&gt; over this scripture. &gt;&gt; What think ye of Christ? &gt;&gt; And it's liberating to the believer when he has the answer from God. &gt;&gt; And and and I'm not here to scare you. I'm here to tell you this is God wanting to empower you. Because then that's when you can really know that your witness is going to be effective. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That when you speak, that's deity speaking. &gt;&gt; Says now your decision on what the scripture asks. The question will seal your eternal destination. It might mean the healing tonight physically. Your concept of what this question is determined whether you walk out of a chair that chair tonight sir or it may mean whether you rise out of that wheelchair. It may mean the difference between death and life to many of you and sinner friend it may mean your eternal destination what you think of it. Now in paragraph 10 it says now no matter how much I emphasize I would try to put it how much emphasis I would try to put on it still it is of no effect unless you receive it accept it for yourself not apply it for some organization or some denomination or to mommy or to pop papa but it has to be applied to you p your personal case what your thought is of Christ, what you think him to be. Do you think him to be a dead person that died 1900 years ago? Do you think him to be just like another Muhammad or Buddha or some great philosopher or teacher or some prophet or a poet? Or do you believe him to be the infallible son of the living God who raised from the dead and is here tonight to present to give you the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. My in 13 it says this little age old question has been risen in the minds of the people through the centuries who Jesus was even this day among many of the Pentecostal ranks it is believed and taught that he is not virgin born son of God you know and I'll just say this you know when we listen to it just think of it and think about because I want to ask the question and and you answer it in your own time and maybe let it just kind of as you're hearing the tape but you know what is the message &gt;&gt; you know people always going to ask you what is the message and then once you start telling them however you decide to tell them what does the message mean to you because I think that before we start telling them what the message is I think if You tell them what the message means to you. I think that that actually will identify with people who are in the world hurting, longing for deliverance, longing for salvation, longing for healing. Like we have to be a partaker first. &gt;&gt; People have already been inundated with information. We don't need to be reporters. &gt;&gt; We don't need to just tell people thus and thus just like court reporting or news reporting. We want the life of Christ to be excited about what God's done for us. &gt;&gt; What God promised me, I might not have it now, but my faith is speaking. Amen. Isn't that your desire? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if the brothers don't mind and uh we can play this 22 minutes. Um it begins there in paragraph 14 and we'll end on paragraph 28. But like I say, it's probably about 22 minutes. Um, and we'll listen to that and then we'll make a few comments at the end and we trust we won't be too long. So, brothers, if you can go ahead and play that now. &gt;&gt; Now, that knocks every foundation out from under Christianity. He was either the son of God's virgin burned or his blood was no more than my blood or your blood. Sex had nothing to do with it. Almighty God overshadowed the Virgin Mary and she brought forth the son Christ Jesus by the great mine conception by the power of the Holy Spirit to form a blood cell in the womb of a girl who knew no man. And through that holy unadulterated blood, my faith rests solemnly upon that tonight and nothing else. For my forgiveness of sin and the reason my faith is stayed there because I truly believe it was the blood of God. That's why it has a resting place. But it's so scattered today. What about it? Let's just call a few witnesses for a few minutes and find out what would be said of someone who's passed on. What if we tonight could call his arch enemy Judas Iser? The very name Judas just makes us shiver. Now the word Judas is not such a bad name. Not up to that time. Perhaps many little Jewish boys was named Judas. I don't know but perhaps come from the name of Judah the tribe. But it was what Judas did that makes people fear and shake at the name of Judas. What makes the name of Jesus so sacred? There was many little boys named Jesus. But it was what Jesus did and what he was that makes his name so reverent tonight that all the family in heaven is named after him. Not so much of what your name is, but what you are with your name. Judas, if we could go down to the regions of the lost and the damned, if we could go to that wearome place called hell and could call that deceiving spirit of Judas is character to this platform tonight, it would say, Judas, what's Thank ye of Christ. Whose son is he? I could imagine you could hear 30 pieces of silver rattled across the platform and you'd say, "I have betrayed innocent blood." What if I could go to the smuggling regions of loss and call the Roman soldiers who took the spirit pushed it into his heart? I would say what think ye of Christ who son is he? You'd say, "Truly, that is the son of God." What if I could go to Pilate, that great emperor of Rome, go down to the regions of the lost, honest, fragile man and call him here tonight before this audience. Remember, I'm calling his enemies. If I could call Pontius Pilot tonight and say, Pilate, you've been gone for 2,000 years. Wherever you have been, I want to ask you a question that you might answer this audience tonight. What's your opinion of Christ? What kind of an answer do you think he would give when Christ was placed before Pontius Pilate to make his decision of what he thought of him? And my brother, sister, Christ is placed before you tonight to give your opinion and to make your decision. What do you think of him? &gt;&gt; And your action will speak much louder than your words. &gt;&gt; Let's look at Pontius of Pilate as they dug him out one morning to sit on the dead seat. to be favorable to the Jews and to the Romans when they dug Jesus up before him with the thorns on his head as a crown and his hands tied behind him. I could imagine that great emperor as he sat on his throne all discouraged because he'd been gotten up a little early and with his hipper all up as he swing his hair back and look into the face and say they can't be much to that. You say, "What a horrible person." But oh my decrepit sinner friend, you do less than that &gt;&gt; by rejecting him and say with his hands tied behind him, how could a king with his hands down? That's the king of heaven. as Pilate was judging him, looking at him up and down, that if you are the Christ, why don't you say something about it? And Jesus never opened his mouth. I can imagine Pilate saying, "Well, he's a scared because he's standing before me, the emperor of Rome. Then all of a sudden I can hear a horse come galloping at full speed coming from the palace and a young handsome soldier jumped from the saddle into the street up through by the guard and they seen he was a palace guard so they let him in. He was carrying a piece of paper in his hand and I can see him as he walked up before Pilate, bows himself to the floor and say, "Your majesty, sir, I have a letter from your wife." She said it was urgent for you to receive this at once. That's why I broke in like the way I did. I see Pilate open up the letter with his head back. And as I begin to watch his eyes under his great brow, the frown and the long eyelashes and eyebrows, his eyes goes to a cold stare. As he reads this letter, he looks around to Jesus and he looks back. His face becomes white. His lips doesn't seem to have any blood. His knees begin to knock together. What's so important about that letter from his pagan wife? Let's look over his shoulder and read and see what it says. My dear husband, don't you have anything to do with that just man? heart this day. I've suffered many things in a dream because of him. &gt;&gt; That's what he would say happened. What did he do instead of releasing him as he had power? Instead of embracing him in saying, "Yes, Jesus, I've been wrong. I judge you, but this morning I receive you as my savior, as the son of the living God. I bow before you. But instead of that, he tried to justify himself like many sinners of this world today. I just won't go to the meeting that bring me a pan of clean water and he washed his hands of him but I just won't accept him but I just won't have anything else to do with it. Did that clean his hands? &gt;&gt; No. And neither will it clean your hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's before you. &gt;&gt; You've got to make a choice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God compels you to make a choice. &gt;&gt; You can't leave that door tonight without some sort of a choice. &gt;&gt; It's impossible. As the old legend says, Pilate many years later where in the northern countries in the mountains, he was finally dethroned and he weary and he walked and finally committed suicide by plunging himself into a great hole of water and drowned. And it said as a legend that every year just about the time that he washed his hands of the Lord Jesus [Music] and accepted his great dignity instead of humbling himself to the Lord. The legend says that that blue water bubbles up for hours to show him that blue clean water won't wash the blood of Jesus Christ off of the hands of any person. &gt;&gt; Neither will a name or a church boat. &gt;&gt; Neither will anything else ever wash the blood of Jesus Christ off of a man or woman's hands who's heard the gospel. You've got to make your decision. &gt;&gt; There's no other way for you to do. &gt;&gt; You either accept him or you deny him. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; He is on your hands and there's nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; Only make your decision. You say, "Brother Brandham, you've been talking to his enemies." Now, what about some of his friends? That's what his enemies had to say. Let's see some of his friends. Let's call the Hebrew children to the platform tonight. Oh, you beloved friends of God, what think ye of Christ? You live many hundred years before he ever was manifested in the flesh. I can hear Shadrach say, "I'll speak far of the three of us." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not divided. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, one doctrine. We one in hope and charity. I'll speak for the rest. It was on a gloomy morning when we were cast into a big pit of fire of a furnace at seven times hotter than it ever was. &gt;&gt; And we wondered what was taking place. We never felt any fire on us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Neither did we feel or hear any hair tingion, but it seemed to be very comfortable down there. And when we turned to look, there stood one that looked like to me, the son of God. [Music] That's what we think of him. Ezekiel, the prophet that we spoke of today. What think ye of Christ? Ezekiel, whose son is he? One day Ezekiel while the spirit of God was upon me, I looked up into the heavens. I saw him coming and the clouds were like dust under his feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I saw a wheel in the middle of the wheel turning way up in the middle of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Daniel, will you testify tonight? Most surely will I testify. I stood one day while the spirit was upon me and I saw the gentile world all together. And I beheld until there was a stone cut out of a mountain without hand rolled into the image and smashed it. I saw all nations come to the ancient of days whose hair was as white as a snow. That's what I think of him. What a marvel. Just asked his mama. If anybody ought to know whose son it was, his mama ought to know. Mary, will you testify? Most surely will I testify. Mary, you are his mother. He laid the first nine months under your heart. What think of Christ? Mary, who son is he? She said, "I knew not a man." &gt;&gt; But one day on the road down, the great angel Gable stood before me and said, "You're going to bear a child, and that holy thing will be called the son of the living God." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe I think the final notice the final word that ought to stand it before all nations both heaven and earth. Let's ask God about it. See what he says about it. One day up on the mount transfiguration there come a great cloud from heaven &gt;&gt; and overshadowed them &gt;&gt; and Jesus was set out to one side and his raignment did shine as a sun God. What about this man that the Jews turned down? What about this that the Gentiles love pleasure more than they love? Who is this? Listen to God's own word. This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Dare ye him? That should settle it once forever. Every man or woman that's ever mounted to anything has believed that. Let's call a poet on a scene. Eddie Puit, he his writing was rejected and he was a man cast out, but he loved the Lord and he did not go to the arm of flesh, but he went to the God who answers prayer and sitting in his office one day under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, Eddie picked picked up the pen and wrote the inauguration song. All hail the power of Jesus name. Let every angel's prostrate fall. Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him lord of all. blind Fanny Crosby who was tortured through her life by scornful hands and making fun of her because she wouldn't write whirly songs. What saint Banny Crosby that's called you here? And what do you think of him? Whose son is he? What does he mean to you Fanny Crosby? And when she picked up the pen, she wrote, "Past me not, oh gentle savior, &gt;&gt; there my humble cry, while on others thou art calling, do not pass me by. Thou the stream of all my comfort, more than life to thee. Whom have I on earth beside thee? Or whom in heaven but me? Another note living, he loved me. Dying, he saved me. Buried, he carried my sins far away. Rising, he justifies freely forever. Someday he's coming. Oh, glorious day. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; And whose son is he? &gt;&gt; What's your opinion of him? What do you think about him? William Brandon, what's your opinion? Oh my You know, I think at the end of that, um, he said, "What manner of people ought we to be?" And I think it's one of those things, like I said, it's time to witness. You know, we all have an experience with the Lord. And I got to thinking, you know, I was fellowshipping with my family and I just started telling them, you know, I was asking the question because you want it to be personal, right? You know, without what God's done for you and what you've received from God, the love of God is actually the difference maker. It's the unseen force that will change someone else's life. And so without love, the love of God in our heart, our faith will be unaffectual, right? We want to contact. And so I got to thinking and as I was asking him, I was like, you know what? What does the message mean to you? You know, what is the message? And I got to thinking, I was talking with brother David about something and all of a sudden it was like one of these reminders of what the message, you know, I I I came through a denominational or they were non-denominational, but for years I was under uh teaching from a pastor and I didn't know about the message, but you know, I gave my heart to the Lord and the burden of sin left, but there was things in my life that I just couldn't get victory over. I just didn't realize that there was more. I didn't realize there was a a way to break the chains because it wasn't taught to me, right? Oh, you you were going to be like that in those conditions and that's why he died. Not knowing that there's a a promised land, a land of inheritance to walk into. And when I started coming to the message, it taught me who Christ is, the revealed word of the hour. You know, brother Brandham is not my savior. Jesus Christ, the virginborn lamb of God. He He He was our redeemer. And I got to thinking about what the message means to me. &gt;&gt; And I'll witness to you a little bit tonight. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; And maybe you can identify with my testimony. And I won't be much longer, maybe about five or 10 minutes. But I just want to tell you, you know, maybe one of my oldest friends in here, Brother Tommy, he's known me since 2001 or maybe 2000, somewhere around that time. But by the time I met him, I already gave my heart to the Lord. But see, I was under that denominational teaching, which there was non-denominational, but but so we were doing things that you would just think that a next worldly person would be doing. But whenever I came into the message, you know, I I was in debt. I was broken physically. I was in bondage emotionally, relationally. There was things in my life I could not fix. And the moment that I started praying with sincerity, once I came in contact with brother David and he gave me the message on CD, I started feeding on the message. And I want to tell you what what this message has done for me. It's brought restoration. &gt;&gt; I was a complete insane person when I remember there was a time when I was 11 years old. I I I didn't know how to deal with frustrations in life. I didn't grow up in church. And so disappointments, regrets, certain frustr I just didn't know how to deal with the pressures and the challenges, right? So when when someone would come against me, the best way I knew is it's time to show some fist, you know? And sometimes uh you know you you're outnumbered or outgunned. And there was a couple of times if it just wasn't the grace of God and the call of God on my life and it was more than one instance I would have been a murderer. &gt;&gt; You know just like you you think about the testimony of brother Brandon when he got in that fit of rage and he went to pull that trigger on those boys that beat him. &gt;&gt; You know it was the grace of God. this message, what Christ has done for me has restored me to the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; You know, I can tell somebody, you know, I'm not what I want to be. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not what I used to be, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; but there's there's been a change made. &gt;&gt; There's been a transformation because I've met him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the difference is Christ. It's the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; You know, I was in a bunch of nonsense. And the Lord, I I'm praying in the depths of my heart, Lord, I want to do things the right way. I want to live right. I want to know you. I'm praying, God, I want to walk in your way. If you'll show me the right way, I'll walk in it. &gt;&gt; Then I get my wife comes, my beautiful wife. I have children. I was a wreck. I was a mess. But that's what Christ does for a person. You know, I was I was going through it with finances. God completely dealt with it. Within three years, all my debts were settled because I wanted to do the right thing because I was feeding on the word of God because I was under the tutorship of a pastor and feeding personally on the message, praying and believing, you know, God healed me of menitis. I told him, I said, you know, if if you'll heal me, I'll serve you. You know, you got to have a reason. &gt;&gt; You know, like I want to be pleasing to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just go live my own life and do my own thing like a maverick. I'm I'm to be here and be a part of a work of God with each one of you. That's the same for you, for each one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged. Be encouraged. &gt;&gt; You know, it's our God that's wanting to do so much more for us. But I, you know, I got to thinking about how, you know, uh, just the insanity that's in the world. And if we'll just witness what God has done for us. &gt;&gt; I believe that lives can be transformed. You've seen the hand of God in your life. You've seen it in others. And I'm not saying you don't do it, but I want to see more of it. &gt;&gt; Because really, I believe that what we're desiring and what we're longing for is going to happen as we witness. Amen. Because I believe we'll draw strength as we testify as we accept Christ and as we receive revelation every day is producing the very life of the bridegroom in the bride. Amen. Why don't we all stand as we prepare to turn this over to our pastor? And I just wanted to read this because it was something and uh you know I was fellowshipping with a brother and um a man made a comment and he's in the world with like like denominational world and he had mentioned one of the things that you know is going on in the churches is you know like with all of the things the politics that are going not outside but you could see it outside also but in the church and there's such a parallel know what's happening in the world, what's happening in the church, right? But the things that people are doing in the the adult minds like people who should be able to be mature and to have a testimony and things like that because of the things that they're doing, it's causing the children to be neglected. It's causing the young people to go out into the world and seek out uh knowledge of the world. And so when I was thinking about that, I realized that even our our prophet taught us in third Exodus, you know, the the devil is such a shrewd bird and he would attack. He he what and I'll just read the quote, but brother Brown says this in third Exodus. He says in paragraph 213, he says, "Notice the king, that new king that raised up. They didn't know Joseph." What was his first scheme? to destroy the power of Israel was with their children. &gt;&gt; That's right. They tried to destroy their children. Now listen close. The same devil in a different form of kingship tried to destroy God's only son to get rid of the children first before they ever get started. The devil is a real shrewd bird. He knows how to hit the thing before it gets started. He knows it. See, and the only thing you can do that you can ever do to beat him is to rely on Christ, humble yourself, and let him lead you. &gt;&gt; See, you'll never do it any other way. Your intellectual powers will never do it. You've got to believe it and rely on him. &gt;&gt; He's the shepherd. He ain't the sheep. It ain't the sheep's business to keep the wolves away. It's the shepherd's business, but the the sheep must stay with the shepherd in order to stay safe. And that's my safety zone is Christ in Christ. The word is Christ. That's the safety zone. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I want to say to you tonight, you know, let's it's time to witness. It's time to lay aside every other weight. And it's time to have the vision that, you know, the devil's trying to attack our children. The devil's trying to disrupt them before they ever get a start. But let's let's let's dedicate ourselves to praying for our young people. Let's dedicate ourselves to to lay everything little things that that maybe uh uh just, you know, in our hearts maybe try to hinder our prayer. &gt;&gt; Let's just go to God. Let's say, God, will you just, oh God, do in me a work that I can just I want to be effectual. I want to witness. Amen. Why don't we bow our hearts together? If Lord's put something on your heart and you just want to lift your hands and say, "Lord, I I've heard you speak to me tonight." And Lord, I want to witness to you and what you've done for me. And I want to tell others what I think of Christ and how he's changed me and how he's tried to will God bring the inheritance, the the transformation into the promised land to being raptured into Christ. If you feel that God's moved on your heart in this way and you just want to lift your hand or lift your heart with every head bowed and you just want God to take that burden in your heart and make the difference and make the change, I believe you'll do it. Let us pray. Merciful God, Lord, we thank you God for Calvary. We thank you for the blood that divine blood that Lord, it's a blood that will never lose its power. And Lord, it's here tonight, Lord, to to cleanse the vilest sinner. Lord, it's here to Lord take us out of the conditions, Lord, to make us new and to give us, oh God, another start, Lord, to oh God, lay things that maybe try to hinder this witness that your spirit wants to declare out of us, Lord. And we just want, oh God, you to move on these hearts and those that have raised their hand that desired, Lord, your word said that you draw nigh unto me and I'll draw nigh unto you. Father, I pray you touch each one and may when they leave here, Lord, they can know you in a better way. And by the words of your prophet, Lord, may it anchor deep, Lord, as we commit them all to you. We thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Maybe uh you know, I just think that the Lord's so wonderful. You know, as you go and uh you think about this week, just be sensitive. I know the Lord will make a way for you to testify to somebody and witness what God has done for you, what your faith speaks out. Amen. What are we going to sing here? Sounds good. [Music] God sent his son. They called in Jesus. [Music] He came to your love. [Music] He for you [Music] and [Music] you are my [Music] gra is there to prove my savior. Yes, sir. [Music] I can face you [Music] because he &gt;&gt; Yes. Because he lives [Music] here. [Music] I know. Yes, I know. I hear [Music] his word. [Music] Let's sing that chorus again. Just think of it. He's alive and here Tonight [Music] I can praise you Oh, be [Music] [Music] I know Behold my future. [Music] The living. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only does he live, but he's coming back. That's right. You know, I I thought as brother Andrew was talking and and what brother Brandham said and he talked about testifying. You know, the scripture says that you should testify to yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; You need to You need to tell yourself what God's done for you and what he done to you. &gt;&gt; You need to tell yourself that you're not what you used to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan's whole thing is negativity. &gt;&gt; That's his whole thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's his kingdom. &gt;&gt; It's his world. &gt;&gt; He thinks he's in control. &gt;&gt; But you you know what you need to tell him, Satan? This is your world. &gt;&gt; But I'm not of this world. &gt;&gt; I'm not of this place. &gt;&gt; And that's what the Lord came for. He said, "I'll not leave you powerless, &gt;&gt; but I personal pronoun will come again." &gt;&gt; That where I am, you may be also. &gt;&gt; He gave us power to overcome. &gt;&gt; Not just power to heal and cast out devils. &gt;&gt; But first power we have is to overcome &gt;&gt; the sin that so easily besets us. the doubts that he's always put in our minds, the complexes that he's trying to give us, the fear. That's all he is is is fear. He's a liar. &gt;&gt; He's not going to say one good thing about you. &gt;&gt; He's got he's got the biggest book of remembrance there ever is. He remembers everything you've ever done. &gt;&gt; And he's the accuser of the brethren. But I'm glad there's a sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that he chose the place to meet every believer is under the shed blood. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that the blood of God cleanses us from all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad because of that blood, he can put his spirit in us to help us &gt;&gt; overcome the devil. Remember, he that is in you is greater &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; And remember, where does he battle you at? Right here. &gt;&gt; He gets you thinking. He gets you looking. He gets talking to you. He'll have you look at everything in the world but at him. &gt;&gt; I know there's a song that that in the light he said of him, everything else grows dim. I mean, we we can't forget that &gt;&gt; we're his and we just didn't choose him. Do you know he chose us? &gt;&gt; He said, "You didn't choose me. I chose you. I picked you. &gt;&gt; And not only did I pick you, but I purchased you. &gt;&gt; And and I'll not leave you. I'll be with you and I'll be all the way." That's is wonderful. And I think that what sometimes we just get given the devil too much credit. &gt;&gt; We just let him become too big &gt;&gt; in our lives, &gt;&gt; too much fear. &gt;&gt; And he's a bluff. &gt;&gt; I like how the prophet said he's a big alley oop. He's just a big big old gigantic bluff &gt;&gt; and you're his and he knew you. I thought when brother Andrew was testifying what he was when I first met Andrew he had he had just broke his back and he couldn't pick up a pencil but somebody loved him first. He loves him because he loved him first. &gt;&gt; And don't ever forget that. If you're struggling or you're going through a challenge or life gets too heavy, &gt;&gt; just stop a moment. &gt;&gt; Shut out the world. &gt;&gt; And think about him. &gt;&gt; Think about who he is. &gt;&gt; Who do you say he is, Noah? &gt;&gt; Who do you say he is, Moses? Who do you say is Brian Fanny Crosby? Who do you say he is? Just ask yourself, who do you say he is? &gt;&gt; And I think when you come to the conclusion, he's king of kings, &gt;&gt; lord of lords. &gt;&gt; He's all in all. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he wants to give me the same spirit that raised him from the dead. God wants to give every single person in here the same spirit that quickened him. The same spirit that he overcame by. He'll give you that spirit that you too can overcome. All you have to do somewhere sometime just say, "Lord, I need that spirit. I need that life that was in you in me. I need that spirit that was in you was a holy spirit. It was the spirit of the father. It was the spirit of God. Was God above us? God with us. Now God in us. And we can take that spirit, if we'll have faith, that spirit will bear witness with our spirit and we can overcome any obstacle, any sickness. I was told that a lady stopped by the church. I don't know if she's here or not, but she said she asked us to pray because there there was a a a woman and three children missing. &gt;&gt; I don't know the circumstance, but I know one who does. &gt;&gt; And he's given us authority by his son &gt;&gt; to approach the throne of grace boldly &gt;&gt; and make our petitions known. You have that right tonight by the blood of Jesus Christ. You say, "But brother McGary, I've sinned. I've done some terrible things." You still have the right to to approach that throne, confess your sins, and he'll be faithful and just to forgive them &gt;&gt; and throw him in the sea of God forgetfulness. And you know, God throws him in the sea of God's forgetfulness. Satan puts him in his book of his remembrance and he'll take the charge and the punishment for everything in that book. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight, as brother Andrew always asks us to pray, let's remember this circumstance. And if you have a personal circumstance, I know of some family circumstances that I believe that God can uh uh uh really do some outstanding things in. God's got a way to make things right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You think the walls of Jericho are too thick and too big. They had chariot races. &gt;&gt; Just a little prayer &gt;&gt; and the wall come tumbling down. The Red Sea looked like it was inc uncrossable, but one little prayer and the sea open. &gt;&gt; Make your petitions known. Have faith. So, we're I'm going to pray for this lady. You pray for one another. You make your petition known. And we just trust the Lord. I I I got a phone call this week and a man on the other vent, he said he he said, "Hello." And uh he talked to Lesie and he said, "I I heard a I heard a story about you being in a in a clothes hamper and popping your head up." That's in my testimony. He said, "It rang true with me. I'd like to stop by your church." I said, 'Brother, I said, "If you're hungering and thirsting after the Lord, the Lord will satisfy you." I said, 'You wanted to get closer to God, read your Bible and pray. &gt;&gt; He's the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let let's just approach him one more time. And and I think brother Andrew implored us. I know I need more leadership and more of the Holy Spirit. I know we need to to encourage our young people to get the power that'll help them &gt;&gt; overcome. &gt;&gt; We got to let them know we understand they can't do it on their own. We understand that Satan is greater and and and shrewder and and more deceptive than we can ever matter. But he did not forsake us. I don't care what it is. All things are possible. Only believe. Our gracious heavenly father, a lady stopped, maybe a stranger [Music] in desperation. Father, come into our building and her heart is burdened for a mother and three children who are missing. Father, I don't need to know the circumstance, but I do know that she asked us, your children, to approach the throne of grace on her behalf. And Father, I ask that you'd protect that mother and those children, Father, and wherever she needs to be reunited, that you'd send your grace and mercy upon that circumstance and that she would recognize that it was your hand and your grace and your mercy. mercy and she would give you the praise that you so worthily deserve. And father, us in this building who are facing challenges and a spirit that is always running us down and always degrading us and always feeding us negativity and doubt. Father, we stand and say that we know who you are. The creator of heaven and earth. The one whom all power is in your hands. The one that promised that we could ask what we will of the father in your name and you would grant it. Heavenly Father, we turn our hearts this evening to that promise. &gt;&gt; Father, laying it right before you. Even the worst parts of our nature, our failures and our doubts and our fears, we bring them boldly to the throne of grace, knowing that you'll accept us just the way that we are. And we ask you, Father, for the power that allows us to overcome. And we commit it to your altar. And we leave it there. And we don't walk out with fear, but we stand in faith knowing that you said that you would hear our petitions because we come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, bless our upcoming services. Father, our October family day. Heavenly Father, may that be just such a wonderful day. And Father, our young people, Lord, in a world that we don't even know where it's going, but we're so glad we have a guide. Reach your tender finger down and lift their spirits and lift their hearts and whisper to them that you love them and show your love. Father, and kindle us a flame for more of you, a greater awareness of your soon coming. and be with us, Father. We pray in this great hour. For we ask it in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. And amen. Hallelujah. Do you love them? you know, I I I was trying to get this little pavilion done back here for our our meeting and and so I had the roofers show up. Well, they were supposed to show up at 2:00 and they showed up at 5. So, but by and they not supposed to work after 7:00 by city ordinance, but they're I guess 10 of them come, but they got it done. So, I I want to thank the Lord for that. So, now now that that's done, you know, we can uh we can continue to go forward. So, uh love one another, the troops. Love one another. Ask brother Billy to come and we'll start singing this song and he'll close with a few songs of worship. Pray for Sunday morning. Pray that everybody comes out. Thank you all for coming out tonight. I hope you noticed a little difference in the air conditioning. You didn't? Well, it doesn't blow straight down on you anymore. We changed every grill in here. So, every seat's just as good as any other seat. Now, the best seats are up front. &gt;&gt; The the the anointing starts up here and it just keeps getting weaker.
