father we the clay are becoming the vessel that he so desires us to be it is spoken in your church age book that sometimes the love of God will take a vessel and completely tear it down that he he can rebuild it just the way that he would want it he does it with nailed scarred hands and he said this is the love of God and another way of Love there is not your love is chastising it's forming father may we never doubt your love for us you so loved us that you gave your life for us father may we end that forever in our hearts and become settled father that that you are in control and we'll just rest in that this morning we ask you to bless each one this morning be with us we pray in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles this morning uh sister lesie sends her greetings uh she's watching this morning um in San Diego um helping watch my my mother and my mother's doing good she was um really low at one point and we became super concerned and and uh she's just seem to have a perk up so we're grateful for that um um we don't know I mean my mom's not sick she's just old you know what I mean and and uh um I look at her and of course I can't complain too much about the way that I feel because uh she does so well but uh we're grateful for the touch of the Lord in her life so uh we just be with that um am I still good on the uh height and everything we're still working out the sound a little bit we still have some speakers coming uh which should eventually get everybody listening to the same that we trust that God will be your portion let's turn in our Bibles to the book of Hebrews and we want to read a couple of scriptures first found in Hebrews 1 and then we'll turn to Hebrews 13 so the first chapter of Hebrews and the last chapter of Hebrews and then uh everything in between is real good too so if you get a chance to read everything in between that' be wonderful amen so let us read this uh this morning it says God who at sundried times and in diverse manners spake in times passed unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son who whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world who being in the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person now that's what Jesus was he was the expressed image of the person of God the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he hath by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high amen he by himself purged us of our sins oh if the church could ever get that issue settled in their hearts and their minds what a difference it would make and that Hebrews the 13th chapter uh starting with the the fifth verse it says let your conversations be without coveted and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me gracious father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated I'm prac practicing on trying to preach a little bit shorter so uh in order to do that you've got to help me you know what I mean so you you have to reach out and if a thought strikes you you grab a hold of it and then you pull to uh push us down the road you know so if you're kind of lagging behind then we got to drag you along and and that just takes longer so I'm getting too old to drag people so now you've got to push me so that's what we're hoping this morning that the word of God will uh uh just encourage your heart uh I I shared with you last Wednesday night how that I was fellowshipping with Matthew and we got to talk and and I I I got inspired um by uh this event that took place that uh he showed me and it it was on YouTube and we were talking about discovering to discover something and so when you discover something it's already in existence you understand so you didn't create it you didn't invent it but you you happened to fall upon it now you may have fallen upon it inadvertently or you may have fallen upon it in a search or you may have been searching for something else and come across something I do that quite often you know I'm not a a good bookkeeper so bookkeeping is a box with papers in it to me and Leslie for the last uh 50 years has been trying to find envelopes and files for everything that I throw in a box and but I many times I'll go through the box uh looking for something and when I get in there I discover something else oh i' been I've been looking for this and it it was there all the time I I love that song he was there all the time but it just so happened you discovered him if you could understand that and and we Tred to use that to separate that a little bit from the word revelation though they're synomous that that you come across something but it was more in discovering as the the fact of of of the part that we play and so we were preaching a little bit on the subject of why we read why we listen and why we pray so why do we read and and why do we listen and why do we pray and and part of that reason is that we might discover something we read uh uh to uh uh in trusting and hoping that something will rise to the surface and speak to us that we'll discover a truth we'll discover a revelation that will discover an understanding that will discover an answer that will discover a teaching uh a principle that now can become a part of the way that we live and and and it becomes mean meaning meaningful to us and therefore we we do that we read that we discover we listen because faith comes by hearing a a lot of times I I like to put on that great Bible reader I think his name's uh Alexander scorby I think is how you pronounce his name and by listening to him read many times I hear the scriptures in a different light than I heard him before and it causes me to pause a little bit and think about what he said and uh uh and and listening and and you you pick up things by listening uh uh by by hearing faith comes by hearing understanding it's one of the methods by which God talks to our heart and through hearing we can discover things we could uh I I I've been places and and and just overheard a conversation you know oh I just passed a wreck coming down the highway and sure enough that was exactly the way I was going to go and so now I by hearing that I discovered that that's not the path I want to go down a lot of times testimonies will uh become Discovery to you you can hear a testimony and find yourself I was in that same situation and and here's somebody that suffered what I suffered and you could discover that God did something for them and that he'll understand then that he can do the same thing for you okay and so and that's why and that's why we we we pray uh we pray so we can work our ways through our own feelings our own emotions our own doubts our own mental battle we call it praying through you know where you pray through and you know how it is when you sit down and pray the first thing that comes up is oh you know I I I got a nail in my tire and I've been putting air in it for a couple weeks now I've got to go get that fixed you know and oh I sure wish my boat had a new set of batteries and you know I think my and you're praying you know all this stuff's going through your mind you know what I mean do I got dog food do I got this if and you and and you got to you got to stay there right because why you're praying is you're trying to discover the presence of the Lord you you want that Spirit to come into your heart you want God to start speaking back to you and so you pour out for a while and and you settle yourself down and you get through all the pieces of the puzzle and and and your phone rings and the someone knocks on the door and and and if you don't stay with it you will never discover any benefits of prayer and and prayer is a tremendous beneficial thing to the believer amen it puts you in balance it lets you know that God still loves you it gives you uh excuse the expression my vocabulary is not very big but it gives you a chance to vent and I'll tell you I'd rather vent on somebody that understands then vent on somebody who don't cuz then they look at you crosseyed and they think that you're a little different you know what are you getting on me for you know I didn't do nothing you know and many times you hear the expression I'm just venting wouldn't it be good if you could get all rid of all those frustrations at the throne you could let the Lord know I'm Lord I'm frustrated I'm fighting through life I my I'm hurting I'm I'm going through this I'm full of uncertainties I have all these things and if you just stay there a while and you pray and pretty soon his presence starts coming down and you know that he hears me that's the scripture says he hears us and and you know after you've talked a little bit you might just sit there long enough to start listening and then he speaks to your heart and you discover his will you discover your answer you discover so many things that God has for you and and we miss a lot of things because we don't use prayer as a means of Discovery and so uh we we were talking about that Wednesday night the the need uh to discover and and and we want to be discoverers okay so we're not looking for something that doesn't exist but you you long for a person to discover the peace of God that's her path is understanding how many knows the peace of God exists you know there's a lot of people that have never discovered the peace of God Paul says it right here he he says we we can we can know this one thing we can boldly say that that he's my keeper and and I will not fear what man can do to me what has happened you've entered into the peace of God you've discovered the comfort that comes with knowing that you're in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck you out that that's important to a Believer to discover that it's important for the believer to discover that their sins are forgiven and they're that they're thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more you've got to come to that place there's there's certain things you've got to discover before you can go any further you know Benjamin Franklin discovered you shouldn't fly a kite in a thunderstorm you know or or whoever that you want to say that they invented things most people never invented anything because there's no new thing under the sun they just discovered it and so if we could discover all the riches and the blessings that God's got for his church wouldn't it be something but we just don't want to be content and think oh I've come as far as I can go why that's discouraging here I am this is it take it or leave it I'm going to hear the same old sermon Sunday the same old style the same old bald dead big nose it's all the same nothing there for me I just can't wait I hope you preach short I want to visit with a few people and I always like going out to eat you know somebody usually buys my dinner so that's what I'm here for well you can sure get out of balance that way you can sure miss things but when you can get to a place that you come into the spirit of Discovery I'm here today to discover the presence of God I'm here today to discover uh Revelation I'm here today to discover if I have any faults I'm here today that God does something for me exceedingly and abundantly even above that which I can ask her thing now you're you're you're in a the spirit of moving forward you got to go forward to discover you know I don't know who discovered America first some people say Leaf Ericson discovered it some people say that Columbus discovered it well I think the people that were living here all the time had discovered it long before any of those people they discovered it the people that come just ruined it you know that that's why it's so important for the believer to discover the word of God and and I thought brother Ben the other night did such a wonderful thing when he was preaching a little bit about customs and things and civilization you know that that uh that culture is taught do you understand if if if if any of you in this church was born into our family you know you would eat tacos the way we eat tacos you know you would have goulash the way we have goulash you know and goulash isn't made with macaroni it's made with potatoes I don't know what you call goulash but if it's got noodles in it it ain't goulash you know what I mean goulash is Hamburg is hamburger meat with all the grease and potatoes and that'll feed an Irishman real well and you'd grow up with that that you would actually be that way because you're taught things well you understand that's why we're a people we're not a religion we are not a religion we are not a a a uh uh we're not belonging to a religion a bunch of doctrines and a bunch of teachings and a bunch of Creeds that's not what we're belonging to we're a culture we're a people that are being taught by our Lord and we're discovering something we're discovering our culture our way of doing things our way of thinking not this way this way this country that country but a born again Spirit-filled way of living and that's what we're here for this morning to do is we're here to discover that way of life and to discover if there's parts of our life that aren't lining up to it and I I I told the story so we're that's I want to build on that for a few moments this morning but the story of Discovery was and we were talking about Wednesday night it takes somebody uh some method or some means or something to take place for you to discover something and you can look this up on the YouTube I guess they call it it was shown to me there this man and his wife were sitting in their home and he had recently lost one of his legs he was destitute he was broke and in his own words I never had nothing never had anything and they would watch the Antique Road Show that is a a show where people bring items that they have that they don't know what it's worth and they bring them to appraisers and the appraisers look at it and they say oh this is a picture of such and such by such and I would say today on today's market it would go for $225,000 and they go $25,000 you know and then you know oh my grandmother gave me this and who gave it to your grandmother well her grandmother gave it to her and and this is a a Voss and it's uh Chanel Voss and it's worth $155,000 ooh I didn't know that I just discovered it's worth I just discovered what I had or somebody to say oh I bought it at a garage sale so this guy sitting there in his chair him and his wife on the couch and this guy brings in a blanket a blanket everybody know what a blanket is okay so a guy brings in a blanket why you bringing a blanket and the guy looks at it he they fold open the blanket and the guy looks at the blanket and he's impressed the appraiser he says wow this is a blanket this is a Navajo blanket it looks like the original Navajo type of blanket he says I believe today on the market that you could get 10 to $25,000 for this blanket and the guy's looking at that and says wow and he looks back and laying on the back of his couch he says you know my blanket looks similar to that blanket so him and his wife are standing there with this blanket she's got one in and they're staring at the the TV and they're saying the $10,000 that's right so they just say well we we better go find out so they bring it down to a guy and he says yeah this looks pretty good he said I would put it up for auction somebody might give you $10,000 for it so they went to auction a blanket their grandmother had given them so they they sit there and they go to the auction and they're sitting in the auction and that blanket comes up and they're sitting there who give me 5,000 5,000 somebody says another guy has out 25,000 50,000 guy's going 50,000 tears are running down his face someone else yells out 75,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 do I 300 400,000 I have 400,000 do I hear 500,000 500,000 750,000 do I said 1 million I hear 1 million I've got 1 million $1,250,000 I think it ended up somewhere around between 1,250,000 and $1,500,000 1,500,000 an original Navajo blanket with the original dyes from the original flowers and whatever else they used he was lying on a million 500,000 over the back of his couch wow he discovered what he had and what it was worth and I want to talk to you this morning because I think a lot of us haven't discovered something and you know and I'm I'm not going to take it down to the routes of discovering the baptism of the holy spirit because you probably wouldn't be here if the Holy Spirit wasn't dealing in your life some way you say well I don't want to be here my mom made me come here that's the holy spirit so I'd like to read this statement and I want you to understand that as we go forward this is established so this is not what we're exactly trying to discover or what I want to talk to you about this morning but I want you to have this understanding because this is part about what we want to do you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God remember a couple of Sundays ago what we wanted to start be able to say that's me that's me you are The Virtuous sinless Perfect Bride of Jesus Christ he said that I believe it I don't understand it but I believe it that's me now you might have a lot of doubts that's because you couldn't make me that and you can see all my faults but he don't see any of them thank Lord now listen close he says every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned in the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ how can you if a man if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took my place do you understand if they charge somebody with a crime and they put that person in jail for that crime they paid your price you don't have to go to jail for that crime somebody took your crime for you and if if someone took your place for all your sins and paid the price for all your sins you can't pay that price again that's the fallacy of the Catholic church and that was the whole Foundation of justification Luther said wait a minute there can't be two prices paid for the same sin if Jesus died for my sins then why do I have to say hell Mar's Glory bees light candles and and and and do all those things I've already been Justified when will we come to the place where we K quit paying the price for our sins we keep keep beating ourselves up you know what I mean if it's not even laid to your charge who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect right because the blood of Jesus Christ freees us from all sin so many people sit under Ministries that just beat them down and beat them down and keep them in captivity oh if you miss Wednesday night you're going to hell if you don't pay your tithe you're going to hell if you when I come in you don't bow down to me as Pastor you're going to hell well God got good news for you I ain't going to hell that was settled a long time ago my name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life I don't have to prove to you that I'm going to Heaven by what you think I ought to do and you don't need no honor bestowed upon any man other than the honor that God gave him and let me tell you what he gave the honor he gave the great honor to the ministry as being servants not Lord over God's Heritage servants they're here to serve well who's greater the master or the servant the master you're part of The Who you're part of the master you're the master you're not the servant too many people got things backwards let me I got to move on CU I'm going to be long so I'm going to hurry so I hope you just can gobble it up as quick as I can say it you are perfect cuz somebody paid your price and Jesus the word took my place he he became me that a sinner that I might become him the word amen let me hold true to it not the church the word now that's something because if we're not careful and I I I see it happening all around the country is that we're starting to get Church identity and you know what comes with church identity Church politics each church is starting to develop their Doctrine on this their Doctrine on the Holy Ghost their Doctrine on the gifts they're Doctrine on that they're Doctrine on that we stand for this and it it's falling back into the same mass confusion that we all were hoping we come out of right it ain't the church it's the word and the word has never changed we're reading the same gospel that Paul wrote you know the same the the same Bible the same thing so that that's what it is so we just read it says and the spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh right so the word became flesh now our flesh is becoming word so it's happening both right so when one comes from one way and one comes from another way so for example if you had a car coming this way 100 miles an hour and a a car coming this way 100 miles an hour and they're going to meet what are you going to have have those two are going to become one yeah well that's what's happening we're going one way and he's coming this way and we're going to meet and when we meet it's going to be in a union you believe that he said manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day so just what the Bible said is happening is happening day by day you understand that everything that's happening out there is happening day by day but it's just what the Bible said would happen there's nothing new going on here everything's according to the word of God everything's according to the plan of God it it's exactly on tune the thing that we want to get to is where our place is in it he said and then he makes this statement why it's accumulating so fast out there in those deserts you know everybody takes that quote and they make it one event in a desert he says out there so fast in those deserts I don't know what he was seeing I don't know how many deserts I don't we need even know what the definition he meant was desert in those dry places in those backsides of the desert where people get alone with God where you go out on the back side of the desert you know what what's on the back side of the desert nothing when you get alone with God you can't take nothing you finally at you and him out on the backside of the desert in the in those places that that I've been alone with God there's so many things have happened there in those places that I I've been alone with God in those backside places where I didn't bring anything with me not my troubles not my worries I prayed through them all till I got in his presence and he spoke to me things happen things ought to be happening in our lives God ought to be alive and moving and and and if you got enemies you need to pull your sword and start fighting them and driving them out and take possession of the gates of the enemy gra grab back your inheritance in your land don't live below your privilege so he said he said in those deserts taking place that it couldn't even keep up with it we're near the coming of Jesus to be United with his Church where the word becomes the word call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts the call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts that's really what should be happening here this morning the call of the Holy Spirit searching our heart because why something will be discovered you might have an ability that you don't even know you have you may have a spiritual blanket in your life instead of having a a terrible feeling about yourself instead of comparing yourself to everybody instead of thinking you want to be in a different mindset a different body type a different uh uh you know I always think to myself you know I think well you think what it's going to be like what you're going to body type is going to look like when you've been sitting at a table eating for a thousand years you might as well get this flesh out of your picture we spend way too much time way too much money on something that dying he said he he he said now listen what he said you stand completely you never sinned at at the first place God don't even know no I you I don't I I can't understand that I thought God knows everything everything came from him if he didn't think it it didn't exist so if he said it don't exist it don't exist who's making it exist then not God the devil the devil's making you exist as a sinner the devil's making you exist is a failure the devil's giving you complexes the devil's making you fear all those things are of the devil right the devil is not part of our culture we don't have room for the devil how many of you got a bedroom in your house for the devil we normally call that the TV room but maybe you might call it something else you go there what this is my master bedroom and this is our kitchen hope this is our dining room and up here and this is the devil's room yeah the we we have the devil living with with us no sorry devil you know what I mean you don't live here now you may come in but when you come in you're a burglar how many knows the scripture says that a thief a liar right and what do you do with him you cast him out you throw them out what prophet of God called that applying the token if if you find a devil you apply the token you cast them out sometimes if you read you'll find some sometimes if you listen You'll find some sometimes if you pray you'll find some because what's the purpose of the word of God is to expose the devil how many wants a hidden devil nobody wants to have a couple hidden Devils around where you get alone with somebody and say this is my devil how are you doing today fine my demons a little upset but everything else is good we don't got to live like this I don't care what your past is I just read you that God don't even know your path you're the only person keeping it alive trouble is we keep other people's past alive he he doesn't even know it it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God so the only thing that remains in the mind of God is what came from the mind of God in the beginning anything that didn't come from the mind of God that Satan tricked you into right by your old sinful nature he paid for that thanes right and now by preaching of the word of God he's wanting you to discover something to become aware of something he said you're The Virtuous bride washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated word bride and he Washed by the washing of his own blood that became flesh manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bo of the father before the beginning the same as he was and he was the great attribute of God now so if we can understand that we're not trying to discover our forgiveness now we need to but we need to move past that there's got to be something else he even says in the scriptures he says let's not lay again the foundation of laying on the hands of speaking in tongues but let us move on to Perfection so this sermon go a lot of ways but I want to just keep it in one little train of thought this morning and I want to call it discovering your characteristics or knowing your characteristics I want our desire is to make it personal uh not just uh personal to you but also uh personal uh to me and so I'm I'm saying that this is where I'm at I'm realizing that I have got to come to some conclusions I've got to answer some questions I've got to put the end to some issues that I I'm not going to be able to continue on in the mindset that I am the life pattern that I am that if if there's a a higher spiritual Mountain de climb and there's a deep that's calling me to a deeper place that I I'm not going to get there until that I discover the answer to issues now I I'm a Believer I believe I'm a believer I'm not happy with the way I live all the time no but I'm thankful that if I sin I have a petitionary before the father and I can cry ABA father and he's faithful and just to forgive me of all sins but if I can move a step higher that's what my heart's desire is and so I I I looked and I began to notice some uh things that were uh quite uh see if I can find where it is that I would like to uh read to you first and what I realized is that what I really got to find is my identity now we could look at somebody and today I went to put money in my own bank account at my bank and this bank's on the second floor of this building I had to walk through the parking lot climb up the stairs take the elevator got in there I said this is my name this is my account number I want to put this money in this account they said do you have an ID I said you misunderstood me I'm not taking money out I'm putting money in oh we need your ID I said well if somebody else comes in here wanting to put money in my account don't you stop them cuz they cuz they ain't me well well think of it I wonder if you don't know who you are then they can't nothing can get put in your account God can't deposit in your spiritual account if you can't identify yourself am I yelling usually when I preach at myself I yell so my conver conviction don't stop me from preaching he says I want to take the subject this afternoon identification this is from the message identification around paragraph 14 and you can just listen he says now anyone that must be you're living in the days when identification is required you can't unless you know you're known at the bank you can't cash your check unless you have something to identify yourself I know my wife she can't cash a check I didn't hear a bunch of amens from the brothers he said she can't cash a check yet when we get our check we put it in the bank but she don't cash it because she doesn't drive she has no social security number or anything to identify herself so therefore it's hard anything for her to cash a check you've got to be some official identification and I think it's just what time that we're living in now so we're living in a time that identification is required okay so you have got to have a personal identification so we're not just talking we're not going to the Natural Bank we're going to the spiritual bank and if you're going to go to the spiritual bank and cash a promise right which the prophet of God typed to us a check right remember he said one group has the checks but they don't have no money he said the other group's got the money but they don't got no checks well I got the checks I got the money what am I lacking the identification I'm lacking the ability to go to that teller and prove to them who I am now think of it if the Rapture train pulled here you'd have to have a ticket you'd have to have some identification that that ticket belongs to you now I could and I don't want to get off track here but the tickets are so close it would deceive the very elect if possible so identification we're we're we're just talking about this because this is what we're talking about this morning discovering our identification let's move on he said if you notice if we go into a certain denominational Church like a Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran or something you have to have something to identify yourself if you're going to speak you have to have a credential or a card or a fellowship card or something to identify yourself as where they know where you come from and what you're going to say at that platform you have to be identified and it's the the identifying age it's the identifying age so you understand the spirit of God is here for us to discover our identity because this this is the identifying age now I'm not talking about discovering what we believe we've already been through that right the first thing we discovered that God sent a prophet Malachi 4:5 the second thing we discovered we discovered uh uh what we believe we got a prophet then we found out we didn't cut our hair then we found out that we we wore dresses then we found out that we didn't wear high heels some some of us haven't found that out yet keep reading keep listening you'll get out of those weener tight dresses and you'll get off of those high heels right that okay did I say that with love you'll Discover it no reason to condemn you if you don't know but when you know when you hear it just do it fly the token so th this is the identifying age now all that happens in the natural only types what's going on in the spiritual we also the Christian Church itself which is no denomination but of a nature it's the mystical Body of Christ and it's identified also so we know when this age that this body is going to be identified and she's going to have an identification now we can't go farther until we solve this issue that's why there's the confusion today the church is some are trying to say the church is identified by gifts sometimes the church is trying to say it's identified by knowledge some people think the church is identified by order no the church is identified by him you get you you get lost in the politics forget the politics it's an individual Affair not only do you got to know who you are right but there's a difference in knowing who you are and to be able to identify yourself this is who I am well give me your identification card they take it and they look at it and they look at you and they look at oh this looks like you duh it's my identification I wonder if we look like Christians it's only a type of the spiritual so I want you to understand that this is a happening that is transpiring within the church I I want to try to move I'll just try to do the best I can so it Bears identification Jesus identifies himself so the the church is identified by him and he said we're going to speak on that tomorrow after afternoon okay and so we we see that that identification is so perfect and God and then see it comes down and the character of God was Christ and he was a reflection he he was God made visible notice God made Vis visible so that Jesus was identity was God made visible he was the identification of God he was the personality we read reread that he was the person of God he was the attributes of God that's what he was he was God made tangible now you know a lot of times we say the Bible is the word of God well that is true he said but the Bible is just a recording of the thoughts of God that's what the Bible is it's a recording of the thoughts of God and and it's the testimony of those thoughts manifested so that's what it is it's the it's the thoughts of God we say well this is the word of God no this is a recorded word of God look it was spoken before it was written and before it was spoken spoken it was thought and that's where you were you were in the thoughts of God and so in one Essence this becomes your identity because you're the thoughts of God expressed and this book is the testimony or the recording of the thoughts of God and it's a history and and a testimony of those thoughts coming to pass so we can see it so therefore it became what tangible you are the a tangible identity of God we got to move it out of our minds into our flesh where I can say I handled I touched I felt the Living Word of God oh my if I ever grab you one day and just hold on to you you see what you doing brother because I'm feeling the word of God I'm touching it it's tangible it's right here it's in you Christ the hope of glory Christ in you the hope of glory the same spirit that was in him is in you and it's going to Quicken your mortal bodies oh we we got an identity we're starting to search and find out who we are he says in the beginning was God and he wasn't even God then he just an object of mercury only thing was he was eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed the words and the Word was made manifest so that's that's what I just quoted you in my interpretation of that what is it it's all God being tangible and you are a part of God it's all God being tangible now our our identity is starting to change from what we believe to what we are we are the tangible part of God for our age for our time this is God in our time the tangible living bride of Jesus Christ tangible not setting apart here in a book not setting apart in a tape remember a while back I preached that church had no book Bible no tape without book or without Bible why because they had an identity they were the tangible am word made manifested in their age so we're we're trying to to get away from everything being philosophical and being mental to where it comes and becomes flesh and reality and that's not a preacher thing okay it's not me here talking in elegant words that you can't understand there's no big eyes or little 's I might be a voice piece this morning or or speaking from my heart to you but you are the reality of the spoken word of God for this age you've got to come to your identification of what you are not only who you are but what's your identity you got to be able to position yourself and place yourself and say this is now now now I know my identity now if I understand that I'm the tangible word I was what was in his thoughts I was predestinated to become flesh I here in this day I am that word I believe that word and that's settled in your heart then you can walk to the bank who are you I'm the Son of God what yeah what's your identification he identified me in his word he gave me a word to believe and I believe it once once that settled you're not struggling with I'm a sinner I'm a saint I'm a sinner I'm a saint I'm a Sinner and I'm a saint in and out up and down in and out up and down you say well what do I do with the sin that's in my life if you can get your identity then you have power over him you can say get behind me Satan but as long as you're in the battle of the claim right Satan say You're Mine Jesus say in your mind and and one day you do a little wrong and you you I belong to Satan today and then you don't like belonging to Satan so you go repent and everything and now you belong to Jesus no he don't even know he already threw all that stuff Satan's getting you do in the sea of forgetfulness the only reason you don't don't shut them off is you don't think you have the identity to do it that's right he's got you convinced that you're not one of them and if you don't settle that issue he'll be bothering you and having an effect on you but once that issue is settled he will bother you but he'll have no effect I I want to I hope I can do it my inability to just draw such that difference he says he says what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you're a part of God Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem and them as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there that's another sermon in itself but if the life isn't there then what can they do see they don't see it they'll never see it it the whole thing as Jesus said as it at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father in me and I in you and you in me the whole thing is God becoming material like a husband and wife becoming one together God and his church becoming one so that's the whole purpose here that's what he's trying to identify we're not here living we're not here living and trying to get enough works to get to the throne and plead our case that's not our identification that's not what we're about that's not who we are that's not the program we're in I'm not in the reprogram of repent repent repent repent I'm a sinner I'm a sinner I'm a sinner I'm a Son of God and if sin Reigns in this body I will overcome because I'm an [Applause] overcomer but I got to lay my claim to my identity before I can lay claim to my possession Hallelujah [Applause] and if we're going to struggle with that we're going to struggle whether we have a right to be healed or why am I sick you know why you're sick because there's a devil you know why you're sick so God can manifest his attribute you know why you're sick so God cont test you and prove you it don't mean nothing oh if you weren't sick if you didn't have to struggle with your blood if you didn't have this oh what would you be you know what I'd be I'd be maybe a way too proud maybe way too arrogant Paul said he put this Thorn In My Flesh to Buffet me that I wouldn't exalt myself above measure oh that word has got to become real to us to think that the man was made in the image of his creator and was given a wall to stand behind that that word could never fail that's the Christian's hope it's his shield it's his armor it's the Rock today is to stay behind the word every believer now you must never get from behind that when you do you open the door to the enemy when they say oh well you can do a little of this and a little of that God wants you to separate yourself from everything that's called sin completely set aside for him and for him alone now that's a hard thing sin is unbelief sin is to know to do the will of God and not to do it it's not all based on the sin in the garden the fleshly desires there's a lot of sins in the mind that are a lot worse than the sins in the body when you stay back and God speaks to you and speaks to you and speaks to you and you won't go further than God you won't try to become any more spiritual you won't try to change your character you won't try to move up that's worse than in God's sight this you sat on a bar stool with a woman just to turn his spet off to to to deny the transforming power of God and God's ability to transform you you say are you transformed I don't care if I'm transformed if I can know for a fact that I'm identified as a transplant recipient then God will put that take that Stony heart out of me and put in a fleshly heart if I know the seeds there and I can identify that seeds in me then I know that that seed has the power to transform me I'm not going to transform myself and then look back and discover the seed the whole journey is the characteristic that might have went over some heads but that's okay maybe that was for me now you might you must never get from behind that okay he says he has a purpose in your life each individual that no one else on the face of the Earth can take your place okay that's why it's not a group thing that's why the prophet of God said there's two types of spirit there's the church spirit and there's the spirit of God the church spirit is we're going to do it as a group the spirit of God is Christ in me the hope of glory amen God has got something for you you're made like that you're made like that you're made to get what God's got for you what God's got for you becomes your identity that's right amen not a great big blanket thing out here okay it's personal it's individual God's got something for you you've you're made like that you you was did that way for a purpose God is Sovereign in his Works things differ we differ one from another we notice animals we find out that animal life there's one animal and one's a beast of burden horses does work cows sacrifice Lions the great Tigers roam without any labor or anything he made the great big animals like elephants he made a little bitty fellow like a mouse and you know there's they tell God what to do and how to do it he does it his own way he makes mountains he makes deserts and everything okay you are as equal in creation as a mountain he makes men different he gives us each one a different place a palm tree can never be a hickory a hickory tree can never be a palm nobody can take your place you shouldn't try to take anybody else's place because you are an individual to God and God has a purpose for you he made you thus you say why did he do it he's Sovereign he's got a reason for it being that way he made you the Way You Are your weaknesses your struggles your mind battles he knows all about it he's trying to get you to discover something to discover yeah I go through all this stuff all of it's got a purpose but yet he's got something for me he's got something for me to do he's got something that I'm supposed to be that's what I I need to discover I need to discover my identity in him to be known in his word the same way I'm known on my driver's license but we find out that we'll all we he said but we find out that we're all guarded by the word in heaven we have celestial bodies the Bible says that every one star differs from another there's a Cyrus and the different ones and Mars and Jupiter and all those different ones they differ one from another the sun differs from the Moon and the moon from the stars there is Angels such as there is sarapin and chapins and angels and great angels in the in degrees and even in the New World world to come the king of Earth will bring their honor into the city just think they're they're different right but but what's their honor their honor is their identity that's their honor that God made me thus that's my crown this is the way God made me Christianity's got off on this this whole journey of they have a clone idea of Christianity and you're all supposed to be beaten into this mold by preachers it's never that way it's an individual Affair it's got to be working in you you got to oh I don't have the words to express how perfect you are in his sight and how that he wants to get each one of us and have us find and discover what he put us here he started it with the age he started it with the churches and he's bringing it down he opened the seals and now it's coming down to you finding your Eternal identity in him where you were in in his mind in the beginning he's starting to reveal that if you're interested if you're not interested he says we're always going to be that way because God is not a Sears and robok Harmony House he is a god of variety he makes one one way and one another but we must serve him in the way that God made us and be glad and stay behind his word and that's the way God did it wow okay you you know what people try to do they try to take the gifts and take the personality out of it that's what Pentecost did we all speak in tongues we all got the Holy Ghost it ain't we all it's you all but not we all it's you you're a Mystic living in a world of your own power beyond all things and I want to close with this last statement I now identified in the baptism of the Holy Ghost not something out here on the street something 40 years ago I have it right now the glory and power of God of the Forgiveness of sins I see him heal the sick open the blind eyes see him foretell things read the hearts of the people I'm identified with him in his ministry at this day glory to God I'm identified with him for deliverance in this last days I trust to be a part of that great bride that's coming some of these days he is making a bride yes sir he's hewing and chipping now chopping off the world oh Church joining and Creeds and denominations and dogmas all has to be cut away from the church their formal ideas their indifferences their do doctrines and things come back and let the master pick up the bow let the master pick you up in his hands and strike the word say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever say Amen Lord Make Me mold me make me Lord what I should be and then there will be a different thing give me my identity you know the story about the violin that came up for auction and they put the violin up for auction and some guy offered $10 $15 probably a strat of ear or something that nobody even knew about and then somebody came up and took that violin and started playing it its identity was there but it was undiscovered they didn't know what it was they had no way of doing it but when the master got a hold of it and he started playing it and he started running that up and down the strings people couldn't help it they they started to cry I know that feeling I I heard one of the greatest uh cello players play and he made that cello cry I mean emotionally it actually seemed to penetrate my feelings and I believe in Emotion I believe in being happy in the Lord I believe in rejoicing in the power of the spirit but a man can't play that only he can play that man can't conduct that only he can conduct it if that guy didn't have the ability to make that violin sound like what it was really made to sound like nobody would ever heard it for what it is and if God don't play you the world will never know the gospel the way that it's really meant to be known men and women set apart living righteously with the love of God spread AB abroad in their heart by the holy Spirit I'm not condemning you this morning if you're sin I'm not condemning you if you're smoking I'm not condemning if you're lusting I there's no condemnation in this message I'm just telling you that the master can get your life and play you [Applause] different you don't have to keep playing that same score on discover there's a different music sheet discover he's got something different for you to live you're not living for judgment you won't even come into the Judgment then why live below our privilege why don't we grab and find out and discover what's God got for me to do he's got something for me to do he's got some way for me to be we don't need Pulpit preachers we got too many of them we need life preachers we need people that are shining lights out in the world filled with the power of the Holy Ghost crying out for lost souls being played by the master what we need yes sir this is just a tradition any anyway whole thing's a tradition that's why the prop of God put it in order but he never wanted us to live this is no oh never mind say Amen Lord Make Me mold me make me Lord what I should be then there will be a different thing then if I be lifted up from the earth I'll draw all men unto me yes sir he's cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only cutting off Creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get you back to be a bride for the son another Masterpiece part of the word the word Jesus couldn't take the place you remember when they read in the day in the book he read just the part of the prophecy let the rest of it for the last day were supposed to take that part oh my you understand we're not not our identity isn't I believe Malachi 45 my identity is there's a part in the word of God that I'm to play I've got to discover that for me I've got to know what my identifying characteristics are it's for you no either you're going to walk out here today another sermon great liked it or you're going to get serious and say what am I what am I doing what does God want me to do and if I maybe he wants you to sit on a church bench I'd walk in there and sit in that church bench and just take possession of that spot I'm here to hear the word of God I'm here to praise God I'm here to shout amen I'm here to worship and raise my hands I'm going to create an atmosphere around me that that sinner is either going to go out the back door to the altar one or the other something's fixtion to happen he's here he's in me if nobody else brought him I brought enough for everybody Hallelujah that's what we want to be we want to be what we say we are we're Christians we're Believers of the Divine word of God we're not afraid of what man can do to us God is my keeper he's cutting he wants a church out just like he did the son like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him not part of a Creed not part of a church not part of an anation but the part of him hewed out of any other kind of form won't work he's got to be hewed from the word the world cut off of you and just leave the word only living in you the great sculpture is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires in the last days I'll pour out my Spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters they shall prophesy Christ is the identified Masterpiece of the word made flesh you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the Masterpiece for the bride now Brethren God had a masterpiece then to present present to the world now he wants a masterpiece today are you willing are you ready my Christian friend are you really sure that your life is so reflective for Christ no matter what the world says they say you lost your mind you're crazy you went and joining that bunch of Holy Rollers now don't you pay no attention to that yeah I lost my mind let this mind that was in Christ be in us if you're not ready truly saved in the body and the word of God in you and reflecting itself and the life of Christ reflecting out of you brother sister don't take that chance I don't care what you are what kind of experience you have let that word reflect through through you each day because God in this last day is taking a bride for his son Jesus [Applause] Christ that may need funding right if you have an idea or you've got got something but you don't have no money to fund it it'll never go nowhere you got to go borrow money and then they want a percentage of it so you share your idea you share your investment yes it'll it'll remain yours alone a lot of people have taken a lot of good ideas to the Grave with them because they were too proud PR to get the funding necessary well God's got a bride that needs funding but he provides the funding no interest free and he doesn't just fund you your idea he funds his idea of you and it's his spirit it's his word talking to you and you have access to that Spirit nobody can say this is the evidence of it or that's the evidence of it the evidence of the spirit in you is Jesus Christ the word coming to life in the way that he made it to come to pass in you there's no clone here there's no lookalikes there's no actal likes there's no identification for you can carry of anybody else you must carry your own Christian identity and we'll leave it here this morning and I I I trust that I maybe went a lot longer than I wanted to but it became more important to me that you understand your characteristics and your identity in Christ Jesus our brother from South AFA is going to preach for us tonight so I look forward to that Christians come to the house of the Lord so if you you can't make it back to the house of the Lord I understand that but wherever you are ask yourself
