easily beset us lord and to just commit this time to you lord we want you to have your perfect will and your perfect way lord above all things may your word rule and reign in this service may have the freedom to walk among the isles and deal with hearts lord to answer questions to lords to address needs to heal sickness lord whatever it is whatever burden that has come in this door i pray that it would be left here lord that you would lord that everyone in here as you promised in your word would not go away the same as they came we commit the service to you we welcome your presence we ask for you to have your way and lord we pray that you speak to us may our worship be pleasing to you and lord i pray that you just use each and every one of us according to your will we pray in jesus name amen amen good morning we're going to go ahead and read psalm 118 this morning and uh you know i was reading this and was struck by a statement that david makes in the psalm in verse 5 he says i called upon the lord in distress the lord answered me and set me in a large place he set me in a large place david makes this statement again in psalm 18 19 which is also second samuel 22 20 after defeating all those giants that sought to destroy him he says he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me you know that's an unusual statement a large setting them and setting him in a large place that's an unusual statement you know it isn't really used very often in scripture except for very specific cases what does it mean to be set in a large place by the lord david says it again in psalm 31 and this time he gives us a little bit of a clue about what this means it's in psalm 31 7-8 it says i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered my trouble thou hast known my soul in adversities and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set my foot in a large room so instead of being shut up to the hand of the enemy being contained with a limited set of options or no options caught between a rock and a hard place he has set him in a large room in a large space you know think about that how many times do we find ourselves in situations or in circumstances maybe where it seems like we're between a rock and a hard place you know we have two options ugly and uglier limited and more limited you know and sometimes we forget we allow ourselves to believe that we have to choose between those two limited options but we have an example in the scripture that there's one that can set us in a large place you know when the lord was dealing with the children of israel he often referred to the land of promise as a large land a large place just to give you an example in exodus 3 8 as god is speaking to moses and giving him his commission the lord says this i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large a land flowing with milk and honey the very work of the lord was to take this people out of one land a land of limited options it was a land where you built treasure cities for pharaoh or you starved to a large land where there were more options than that where there was any option available to them not just option a or b but unlimited options i love the way that the tribe of dan speaks of this large land when they are making a claim on their inheritance in judges chapter 18 you know as they move to 1810 if you want to look it up but as they move to lay hold of what was committed to them by promise you know and they're encouraging one another they make this statement when ye go ye shall come into a people secure into a large land for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth you want a scriptural definition of what a large place is it's a place where there is no want of anything in the earth or it could be said another way all things are possible in a large place you know first chronicles 4 10 is maybe a familiar scripture to some of you there was a period of time where it was very popular out in nominal christianity but it's about the prayer of jabez it was a book written about it and just some random guy just some guy and you know i want to highlight one thing about this large place as we read the prayer of jabez in first chronicles 4 10. it says and jabez called on the god of israel saying o that thou wouldest bless me indeed. and enlarge my coast and that then a hand might be with me and that thou would keep me from evil that it may not grieve me and the lord granted him that which he requested notice among all the things that jabez prayed for he prayed that the lord would enlarge his coasts would make his room make his space larger and the lord granted him that request why because it was in accordance to the word you know as the lord was leading the children of israel into the promised land several times he referred to the statement enlarging their borders you can look it up it's in exodus 34 24 deuteronomy 12 20 deuteronomy 19 8 all of them examples of enlarging their borders the children of israel were each given an inheritance in the land but we read in joshua 13 that though everyone got an inheritance there was a lot that was left unclaimed right you know and as far as we know jabez is the only one who prayed and asked that the lord would enlarge what he had take the options he was given and make them greater make them more enlarge his coasts and the lord granted him his request all that stood between the children of israel accepting what they were given as options and enlarging their coasts was asking for it that's it you know how many times do we find ourselves in situations where we have a difficult decision to make it's either option a or option b how many times do we pray that the lord just gives us more options enlarge our coasts enlarge our borders all things are possible when you're caught between the armies of egypt and the red sea you know that the lord would open a third door or a fourth option or a fifth a large place where you're not limited to just a few but where any option is available to you all things are possible so as we read that this morning you know i hope each of us can remember i hope i can remember that you're not necessarily limited to the two options you have in front of you there's one who can put you in a large place where any option no limit all things are possible if you can only believe so as we read psalm 118 this morning that's what stuck out to me i hope it was a blessing to you but we'll read that together oh give thanks sent to the lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever let israel now say that his mercy endureth forever let the house of aaron now say that his mercy endureth forever let them now that fear the lord say that his mercy endureth forever i called upon the lord in distress the lord answered me and set me in a large place the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me the lord taketh my part with them that help me therefore shall i see my desire upon them that hate me it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in princess all nations compass me about but in the name of the lord will i destroy them they compass me about yea they compass me about but in the name of the lord i will destroy them they can pass me about like bees they are quenched as the fire of thorns for in the name of the lord i will destroy them thou hast thrust sore at me that i might fall but the lord helped me the lord is my strength and song and has become my salvation the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly the right hand of the lord is exalted the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord the lord hath chastened me sore but he hath not given me over unto death open to me the gates of righteousness i will go into them and i will praise the lord this gate of the lord into which the righteous shall enter i will praise thee for thou hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become the headstone of the corner this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now i beseech thee o lord o lord i beseech thee send now prosperity blessed be he that cometh in the name of the lord we have blessed you out of the house of the lord god is the lord which hath showed us light bind the sacrifice with cords even unto the horns of the altar thou art my god and i will praise thee thou art my god i will exalt thee o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen amen god bless you you may be seated [Music] i'm

god would bless their efforts amen so just uh want to bring you those greetings and it's good to be back in the house of god brother orlando it's good to see you our condolences to you and the family amen may god be your portion let's just read in deuteronomy chapter 16 how's everybody feeling praise god i'm going to read the first six verses here it says observe the month of abib and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of abid the lord thy god brought thee out of egypt by night thou shalt sacr thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there now notice the emphasis there in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there thou shalt eat no leavened bread within it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou that thou mayest remember the day when thou came us forth out of the land of egypt all the days of our life and we know that seven days of unleavened bread is a type of the seven church ages and he says that there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days neither shall there any thing of the flesh which thou sacrifices the first day and even remain all night until the morning thou mayest not sacrifice the passover with any of thy gates which the lord god give thee now notice this thou mayest not sacrifice the passover with any of thy gates which the lord god giveth thee but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou came us forth out of egypt amen heavenly father we just approach you now at the reading of your word we commit ourselves and this congregation into thy hands lord that you would just come and break the bread of life as only you can speak to your children anoint our lips anoint the ears lord that they would hear from you i pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen you may have your seats and just in uh the lord placed a little a thought upon my heart and as i just went to um find the direction and the leading of the lord when god might speak to my heart a certain many times he he might deal with ministers different and many times he'll deal with myself in different ways uh something that'll be quickened to me or sometimes it'll just be a a thought that he speaks to my heart and as i start to meditate upon that i like i like to look into the message and find uh a message that would that that could be a foundation or something that i can draw from and so as i was uh looking into this thought uh the lord brought me to the message god's provided place of worship and the prophet of god would preach this in 1965 november 28th and i tell you god knows how to encourage you um you know uh uh i i just um as our pastor um was was leaving out of town i was i was struck in my body and i went to the doctor and and they had diagnosed me with a sickness and i wasn't feeling good and and my voice was was my throat and everything was just kind of of heaping up against me and and i thought to myself well i don't i'm not going to tell the pastor you know i don't i want him to be able to go in his joy's trip and i just want to depend on god so we asked some of the brothers to pray for us and and as i started to look into this service and i started reading it i noticed i'm like you know what this is this is the same day today is the same day that the prophet preached this message 56 years ago and and i you know you like things like that it encourages you and i say god knows how to encourage you and i started to to read it and and as i started to read it the prophet said i'm a little bit hoarse so bear with me if you will in speaking you know there's little things like that we're believers right i'm thankful that we just don't have to believe things are by chance you know but but we're people of god that that we can believe that you know god is speaking god is moving and little things like this mean something to us you know so so i was encouraged i thought well you know what i can say the same thing and and i thought if if the prophet stood on this same day 56 years ago and said bear with me my my voice is a little hoarse i'm in good company so bear with me a little bit uh my voice might might be a little hoarse but um we uh we just want to deliver uh god's message to you and so i just thought it would be um fitting to open uh and reading the the prayer that the prophet would um say right before going into this service and and i do want to say uh that i'm not trying to um this is a wonderful message and i actually believe the one that brother branham preached in april the 25th will be the next service that our pastor is going into and i'm really looking forward to that because it's just so packed and it's so unending and and we're not necessarily trying to to gather from this whole message but just take a a quote here or there to support the thought that that god had dropped on my heart but i did think that this a prayer at the very beginning was fitting and just to read it now is maybe in your own heart you'll pray as we read it he says be real sincere now we're approaching the word of god which is god in letter form he says great author of this book bear with me we're a little hoarse might be a little struggle this morning but hey god is more than able i might need to keep a water bottle in hand great author of this book it's a seed we are taught that a sower sowed so said the author now we do realize that a seed will grow if it's in the right kind of ground so father will you this morning take all the briars and thistles and unbelief and skeptic thoughts out of our hearts that the word of god might grow freely watered by the spirit in our hearts that we might become the people of god granite father that's our hearts not only do we have recognized this but may there be others throughout the country each one the heart burning with love and tenderness will go to try to win the lost brother the lost sister grant it today god we're looking holy to you for you are our guide and our lord so we pray that you'll direct us in your word today and give us of thy blessing through thy grace and in thy name we ask it amen isn't that a wonderful prayer i believe i'll try to switch to a handheld that give me a little bit more control and maybe we can take it away if we have to cough but i just thought that was so neat there he he says take all the briars and thistles and unbelief and skeptic thoughts out of a heart that that the word of god might grow freely and be watered by the spirit in our hearts and i say you know that's where the seed takes hold it's in the good ground is there any good ground here this morning that's where the seed of god and you're not good ground by your own choosing or your own ability but god has predestinated you to be the good ground this morning that the seed of the word would take root in and it would start to grow and it would start to manifest and so we're praying that god would take out all the briars and all of the thistles and all of the unbelief lord any of the the skeptic thoughts that would be in your heart my i don't want to be playing church this morning but maybe we can move past uh the person that's sitting next to us and we can move past the building and maybe we can move past the things that we're thinking about what we're going to do after the service and maybe the things that happened on the way to service we we know how satan will buff it at your flesh and he'll try to to distract you and he'll try to come against you but i pray that right now that every thought can come subject to the word of god this morning and that the holy ghost can come in his power and demonstration and he could speak to a people where the seed of god has been placed that all of the the the thoughts that are not of god and all the bristles and all the briar and all the unbelieving things that would try to keep you from recognizing the presence of the lord jesus christ in our midst that we would move away from all the unbelief and we'd find ourselves sitting in a place where jesus christ is in our midst he's present amongst us so we want to look to the unseen this morning and to know that the resurrected savior is standing here in our midst so whatever we have need of whatever the questions are that are upon your heart that there's a people that have come to the house of god david said i was happy when they said unto me let us go into the house of god i didn't come here to be seen of man this morning i didn't come here to just sing some songs and fulfill some religious duty but i came here this morning to be in the presence of the almighty god that as i would sit in his presence that he would come by my way and he would speak to my heart and as i'm in his presence i know i'm sitting in the seat where all things are possible i pray oh god move me past man's thinking move me past the ways of man move me past my flesh this morning may i look past the veil may i open up my heart may i see a resurrected lord jesus here in our midst friends we are the the chosen elected bride of jesus christ to manifest every word that was spoken and just as jesus christ manifested every word that was spoken in the old testament god has raised up a people in the end time to manifest every word that was spoken in the new testament and those two have become one flesh in the end time jesus christ dwelling in a people the word has been made flesh in a people in this hour oh praise god for his word may god move us into a place this morning where all things are possible amen oh jesus said let not your heart be troubled is there anybody here that's troubled this morning we're living in troubled times let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me what i want to ask you what he's saying you believe in god believe also in me don't make that a past tense make that a present tense this morning let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me the one that is standing before you this morning not a man speaking but i am the same yesterday today and forever i'm living in my word i said i will be with you in a five-fold ministry and by that five-fold ministry for the edifying and the perfecting of the pride of jesus christ that means there's a people that have gathered themselves together in bedford texas they're being edified they're being perfected not by what man is doing but what by god is doing by the revealed word of the hour if you can by faith reach up to heaven and pull down the strongholds and receive what god has for you there is something here for you this morning friends what do you have need of what do you have need of well i'm wanting to preach to you this morning on the place of manifestation when moses was called unto the mountain he said i'll turn away and i'll look and i'll see what this great sight is there moses he came nigh there what did he see he saw the pillar of fire caught up in a bush and it was there as he came and what did what did god speak to him said moses the ground wherein you are standing is holy ground take off thy shoes but i want to tell you this morning it wasn't the mountain that was holy it was the god that was on the mountain that made where moses was standing holy and i want to tell you this morning oh the place where you are standing pride of jesus christ you are standing on holy ground not because of a church building not because of man that's seated here but because jesus christ is here in your midst you are on holy crown oh why don't you just serve him why don't you worship him why don't you open up your heart and receive them that jesus christ is here the ground where in which you are standing it's holy ground not by what you could see with your eyes but by a faith that god has put in you by a sixth sense that jesus christ is here hallelujah oh do you believe it this morning wasn't the mountain that was holy wasn't the campground that was holy it's not the church services that are holy but it's a holy god that's at the church service a holy god that's at the campground and i just don't want to be living from camp to camp this morning i don't want to be living from service to service this morning but the holy god i'm experiencing in the tabernacle this morning i pray oh god go with me be with me every single day but i'll only be with me be in me and that's a divine promise he said i'll be with you i'll be in you until the end of the world i'm asking is there somebody that is packing the revelation that jesus christ is living in you oh it's not i that liveth but christ that liveth in me oh let not your heart be troubled when i speak a little bit on the place of manifestation praise god you know as i kind of thought about these things and you know the place of manifestation you know uh there's a prepared place for the believer this morning and i i pray everybody had a good thanksgiving a lot of times we were able to spend time with friends and family and you pick a location you set a time and you show up and that's where everything is happening oh my the sides and the turkey and the cranberry and the stuffing and the green bean casserole and sweet potatoes you brother matthew you're talking american stuff well i don't know what y'all eat we come from many different cultures many different countries represented among us but it's a thanksgiving time it's a great a time of thanksgiving where we give thanks unto god and you know you have to come to that place because that's the place where everything is happening many times you pick a place in a location where you want to settle something or you want to do something you know i was kind of reminded as i thought on these things i remember it being in sixth grade and and you know i i was this was my first year in the school bell manor which is uh just right down here uh down the road we currently were going to um christian temple and uh they decided that they didn't need anybody of my caliber at their school anymore my parents were doing the best they could to put us uh in a in a private school and they had elected that it would be beneficial if me and my brother since i'm not alone in this matter didn't return and so i found myself in my first year it's in sixth grade which was in the way they do our school system here that would be the last grade they do kindergarten through six at the public school here and you know i found myself coming to this public school and you know they didn't have a dress code kind of like the the the private school did i was like you can wear sweatpants to school i'm like i can wear sweatpants and just a little you know a t-shirt and just go comfy so you know i kind of like that so i started showing up to school you know i mean i probably didn't look like the best dressed i probably probably didn't look like the cool kid at school but but you know i was comfortable and i was kind of an oddball a little bit of a misfit there but you know i remembered i was there and there was this uh a friend of mine named jordan you know we played ball together and and we had known him but we had gotten into dispute one day and the whole the whole class was they were kind of watching you know and uh words were starting to be exchanged but we had a saying around there meet me at the flagpole when you get to that point and everybody hears meet me at the flagpole well that's the place where things are going down that's the things where things are gonna happen you know and so i think maybe i got a little excited you know and and i said well meet me at the flagpole you know and i was just a little bitty shrimp and jordan he was he was athletic he was fast he was bigger than me and and you know so the school got out you know and i started to think i was like well you know what it's time to go to the flagpole you know what i i remember as i i remember in my mind i pray i have it right but but i remember i i think i let a little bit more time lapse but i went there and there you know everybody was gone and there was jordan he was there at the flagpole and i showed up he goes i'm surprised you came and i was like well i'm here he's like what do you want to do about it i was like well you know i'm here he's like yeah i didn't think you'd show up i was like well i didn't know if you'd show up either you know what but we we ended up doing is we just we shook hands and i remember we actually just walked home that day and and we were friends and i thought you know yeah you know meet me at the flagpole and i started to think about that you know about how we have differences with people and and and maybe the in the church maybe you have ought in your heart for a brother or sister or maybe things are are going just like you think they should be going and and many times if we're not careful we develop an attitude or we we we develop a frame of thinking of maybe a couple in the way that they conduct themselves and maybe when they come to church and maybe the way that we're dressed and all of a sudden we start looking through the eyes of a critic and we leave the blood at the door and we start to look at somebody through eyes that are casting judgment and many times we'll find ourselves in the devil trying to cause a root of bitterness and we'll find ourselves in a place if we're not careful where we have ought with our brother or sister but i i thought of this you know what we ought to say in our heart as in the world as i would be there at school and maybe you would be excited about something and you say jackson meet me at the flagpole everybody knew what that meant but i wonder if the bride of jesus christ in your heart you could look at that brother and that sister and say meet me at calvary why don't you you meet me at the cross when you come to that place when you come to calvary oh to think that there was a wounded lamb that bled and died for your sins how could you come to that place how could you hold any animosity how could you hold any bitterness how could you hold any malice how could you hold any judgment how could you look down on your brother and sister when a wounded bloody lamb that was beaten that was shame that is dripping that was wounded was now there to that cross to take away all of your sins to take away all your brother and your sister says oh when was he wounded for your transgression before you ever committed one sin he was bruised before you ever did it why we were living in sin but god so loved you that he went and paid the price for you i wonder if in your heart right now you could be repent of and you can say you know what i'll meet you at the cross it's at the cross where things happen it's at the cross it's a place of manifestation where you can experience the love of god oh hallelujah there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains oh i tell you if i want to meet you anywhere i want to meet you at the cross let you let me meet you under the shed blood of jesus christ as we just move into verse six here and just kind of continuing through our thoughts a little bit but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there notice that now but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at evening at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt and the prophet would point out how you know deuteronomy means two laws two laws you can obey god's word and live or you can disobey god's word and die and god gave his law on mount sinai and by that condemned the human race because no man was able to fulfill that law but then god gave another law on mount calvary i said god gave another law on mount calvary that by that law every man can live if you're identified with the shed blood of jesus christ and i'm so thankful this morning that god has a provided place for the believer a provided place for his word to manifest i say that's the place that i want to be this morning i want to say that's the place where things are happening you know i remember being out there in the world and and uh you know you they would they would have these big parties and these big scenes and you know you would go to it and there'd just be all this hoopla and to do and and you know that that the you know they'd put a lot of money into these things but there would come a time where that appointed time of that party would come to an end you know everybody would would have to go home but you know there was actually something called an after party and then if you if you made it to the after party maybe you you were thought of as somebody you know my if you got the invite to the after party because the party you know that that just hey you know they get started 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 but my you know there's the after party and they set the time and the appointed place and and you know so because the people don't they don't want the music to stop they don't want the dancing to stop it it's never enough there's this hunger and there's this craving and and now you've been out there uh uh uh blowing your brains away for four hours already it's like oh there's an after party where are we gonna go and then you go to the after party and you know but i want to say eventually the music stops and the and the dancing stops and you find yourself all of a sudden you're empty and what are you doing you're just looking for the next party you're looking for the next high but but maybe you can't relate to that maybe you've been raised in church and maybe you've never got out into the things of the world and by god's grace that is true but i want to say that maybe you can't relate to to being out in the world and looking for the next event and looking for the next venue and looking for the next rush and looking for the next high and looking for the next thing that'll that'll that'll lift you up and and looking for the next excitement only to be let back down and and then it sounds like you go higher and then you go even lower you go even higher you're going even lower and you just feel like you're constantly craving you're constantly seeking there's something you're trying to fill a void inside and maybe you can't relate to that but maybe you've been certain that sitting in a church pew and you go from church service to church service and you go from camp to camp and when the music stops at camp when the dancing stops in the church service when the preacher stops in the pre-and then the church house when the music stops at the end of service and you go out the door and you go back to living your own life that doesn't stop because you find yourself when you're together with god's people and you're in the house of god and maybe in your camp and the cat means you feel like that's where everything is happening that's where the music is that's where the atmosphere is but i want to invite you this morning i want to invite you this morning to come to calvary i want to invite you this morning to be identified with your sacrifice that your sins might be forgiven revelations 3 19 would say as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent i say there ought to be a zealous repenting in the house of god this morning for our sins and for our iniquity for the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life oh we get so lifted up as if we have no sin but if you say that you have no sin you are a liar and you will remain in your sin and you are blind but if you recognize that you are a sinner and that you need the grace of god and you need to be identified with a sacrifice that was nailed to calvary and you'll be zealous this morning and you repent for your evil deeds you'll repent for your iniquity and you'll ask god to come oh hallelujah oh you say brother matthew you don't know my past if you knew what i've done and where i've been if you knew the condition i was in well i'm glad you mentioned it i'm glad you you mentioned it you know that the devil's trying to pour it on you right now but i want to ask you is there anything too hard for god is there anything too hard for god for we are living in the hour of great trial we're living in a great hour of suffering well we're living in an hour where the world is pressing in all around us but ii timothy 2 12 would say if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself i'm so thankful that there is a part of god that is on the inside of me that when i had denied him when i had walked away from him there was a predestinated seed that was part of him and he could look past my condition he could look past my sin and he would say though you've walked away son though you're living in sin there is a part of myself that i have placed in you by the wedding band of predestination and i cannot deny myself no matter what you've done no matter how far you've gone no matter how lost you feel you are i don't care what you've done you are a son you are a daughter of almighty god and satan is out to sift you like we but jesus has prayed for you and he had your name put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and you are part of jesus christ there is a portion of you that god cannot deny oh hallelujah oh we just need to come to that place of a repenting heart but we go through trials we go through sufferings you know believers are always put to the test every son that cometh to god must be tested must be chasing must be child trained now i want you to think about this a little bit because we're many of us are in different stages of our life and and i i tell you for us that i've been at it a little bit a while we need to be careful that pride doesn't uh puff us up and we start to think we're somebody because you know you look at abraham abraham in genesis 12 god had called him and said hey get the out of my country i'll show thee a place that i've given unto you his name was abram he comes out you'll be a father of many nations he shows them the land he changes his name he changes his body he gives them the promised son but then we find out in our bible here that in genesis chapter 22 verse 1 it says and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham so here abraham he is he has been walking and believing god by faith so much so that he's his name has been changed he's actually met god and and he's his body has been changed they've actually received the promised son but you find that abraham even in this place in his walk with god that god is going to tempt he's going to test abraham you would wonder in yourself why would god be doing this here's a mature a son of god who stood the test who stood the trial he stood the adversity he stood the markers and the scorners and he believed there being his wife being barren and there being no life within him he stood there upon the promised lord saying i know that we're going to have a baby and he stood there by faith and god rewarded his faith and there he changed his body he received the promised son and now does that mean it's all over no no every every believer is tested because there's an attribute there's a quality there's a word there's a life that god has placed in you and there is a purpose of the father to bring that into manifestation and he says and it came to pass after these things that god did tipped abraham and said to him abraham and he said behold here i am he said take now thy son thy only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of mori and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of so now god has called abraham and he's saying look there's a there's a specific place that i want to take your son your only son that you love us and there's a place that i want you to take them and actually offer him up for a sacrifice get you up into the mountains and i'll show you where that place is see there was a place that was ordained for abraham to meet god and take him at his word and you just think about this what was happening you say that brother matthew what are you what are you what are you wanting to point out i want to say that god was proving his word through abraham god was proving his word through abraham now and i think about it when satan came up before god and he said what have you been up to i've been going to and fro through the earth and i'm seeking like a lion whom i might devour and what does god do he says have you considered my servant job well you know if i was sitting on the sideline and i happened to be job i'd be like wait a second hold him up you know i've been things have been going okay but you see god said have you considered my servant job and what did he say he said there is none like him an upright man perfect in his generation and what did he do he left the trials he let the adversity come because it was in the trials it was in that adversity that there was a there was a part of god that was in job look it wasn't abraham holding on it was god in abraham holding on it wasn't god in job holding and it wasn't job holding on it was god in job that was holding on so when he said have you considered my servant job watch what he said now listen he said he is he is a perfect man he's he said have you considered there's none like him well god's not a liar i said god is not a liar when he says something he means and so when he said have you considered my servant job there is none like him in all the earth he is a perfect man and he's upright in his generation that was the word of god so no matter what satan could throw at job there was nothing that could destroy the word of god nothing could change what the judge had already spoken regardless of what job did regardless of his faults regardless of his failures the king of kings the lord of lords god almighty had already spoken have you considered my servant job a perfect man there is none like him oh i got some good news for you did you know he's already spoken on your behalf he's already spoken i want to tell you here in satan's eden oh he's come before the father and he says what have you been up to building your satan's eden and your kingdom and all this nonsense and tommy rock and hate and evil and your kingdom that's what you've been building what have you been doing and he could look at that devil say have you considered my bride [Applause] there is none like her she is perfect she is upright in her generation no matter what you throw at her no matter what you do she will not deny me she will not back down she will not stand down why because i have spoken on her behalf she is perfect oh hallelujah what did the prophet of god say in the god of this eagle age he said the purpose of this evil age is to prove to satan come on somebody he said the purpose of lady isaiah and the wickedness that you see around is to prove to satan that you're not like that eve you're not going to go spoil your skirts you're not going to go sell yourself to unbelief why because you're perfect you are the perfect unadulterated bride of jesus christ not because of what you said not because of what i said but because the king of kings the lord of glory has descended with an open book in our generation and he has called your name he said you're sinless you're spotless you're my bride you're perfect there's none like you in all of the earth oh hallelujah why don't you praise the lord why don't you give him glory god has already spoken on your behalf oh hallelujah why because you are the place of the manifestation of the word that has been spoken in our generation and now it's coming into materialization and a people that have gathered themselves together under the revealed word of the hour oh i tell you what yeah i get a little excited i start to shout a little bit i might scream i might stop and i might snort but at least i'm snoring for god at least i'm snorting for jesus at least if i can make a breath if i can make a snort if i can make a stop if i can lift my hand if i can shout i'm going to do it for his glory oh and everything you do in word or deed do all in that name the only name the name that's above all names the name of the lord jesus christ the place that he put his name oh praise the wonderful name of the lord what is god doing he's proving his word in you have you considered job have you considered abraham have you considered my bride oh hallelujah because there is a a predestinated place that god wants to manifest his word and that is in the bride of jesus christ oh hallelujah i'm not going to give up church i'm not going to back down why i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ that liveth in me it's not to him that that runeth or to him that will but it's unto him that god has shown his mercy oh what great mercy what great love he has shown unto us in this day that we would be called his bride oh praise his wonderful name so here in our our little setting here here abraham you know he's passed the test he's been doing good but god says hey abraham i got another test for you i got another trial you know i mean if i was thinking if i was abraham i'd be like really haven't i done pretty good so far but god has more that he want to manifest in your life i don't care where you are at right now young people to the youngest to the oldest there is more word that god want to manifest in your life and we could take an example here in the scripture now because here god is telling abraham who's come through all these trials and he's believed and he's actually he's actually been with with god and his name has been changed and he's received a body change he's received the promised son and now he say hey abraham take your promised son now i want you to go into a a prepared place that i'm going to meet you the way you're going to sacrifice your son i'll show you that place so now there he goes and here he says in in verse 7 it says in isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father. he said here i am my son he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering daddy we've done this before this ain't the first time we've offered a sacrifice but there's one thing that's missing they've been going around and gathering all the wood they've been gathering all the stones there ain't no lamb in sight there ain't no sacrifice in sight the prophet would dramatize how during that time there wouldn't be nothing no nothing around on that mountain there's no water there at that time i mean they've been picking up rocks and building fires every little uh living creature that had been around them guys out there in the wilderness they were gone and now here isaac is saying hey dad we got the altar we got the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him of notice he came to the place which god had told him you know many times we want to make our own place we want to make our own way we want to take our reasoning we want to take the scriptures and the quotes we want to mold it together we want to we want to make our career and we want to make our decisions we want to make where we're going to live and where we're going to go and the way we're going to do things but you know maybe god has a provided place for you maybe god has a certain plan and a certain route that he wants you to go in life but you keep trying to make your own way and you keep wondering why it's so hard and every door keeps getting shut on you and you keep trying to push down the door and maybe you fight you push your way in there and it only lasts for for a few months maybe it'll last for six months you find out well that's not where you want to be and then you go over here and that doesn't work out and these doors are constantly closing maybe you ought to find out that you're trying to make your own way but god has a provided place for you that if you would just get past your own ideas and get into the word of god and start seeking the holy spirit to lead you and guide you into all truth and all righteousness you'll find yourself walking in the perfect will of the lord with a liberty to know that god is with you he's the one that's opening the doors he's the one that's closing the doors why because you're walking with him and you know that you're doing everything that he told you according to the word that you can stand there like abraham say god i've come to the place you told me to come and here i am lord i've put the altar up i broaden the word lord and i've brought my only son and i'm standing now lord i'm standing now lord waiting for your next command with everything he'd believed for the very vindication of his faith god has wanted him to lay it on the altar god even reciting back to abraham letting abraham know i know i know how much this means to you abraham i know you love isaac i know you love me take your only son and they came to the place which god had told him and abraham built an altar and laid the wooden order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood here abraham a father of many nations here isaac the promised son maybe if we're to be spectators this morning you know there goes abraham and isaac there they are they're saying they're hearing god talk to them again what are they doing this time you know the amount of insanity think of it now this isn't a fairy tale this happened the same god that's called you the same god that has spoken to you it's the same god that spoke to abraham the same god that provided him his son and now he's standing there there's isaac laying on the altar and i i would think what do you think is going through isaac's mind as he's laying there on the altar and i was thinking i know that isaac being a perfect type of the lamb i speculate he didn't even say anything but imagine in his mind him saying father you said god's able to provide himself a sacrifice said me lord why why am i here i i don't understand i don't understand the trial i don't understand this isn't how i i thought it was going to go i my daddy told me how you how you met him lord you come down and lord how you changed his name and you changed his body and you brought forth the very promised son and i'm i'm i am the very manifestation of your promised word lord why am i on the altar of sacrifice i don't understand lord why i'm going through this trial i don't understand why i'm going through this situation i want you to know it's because god is wanting to prove his word through you there is a place of manifestation that god is wanting to show you who he was and it was there in that place of impossibility it was there in that hour of despair it was that place of manifestation if i could say it like this it was in that place of revelation that all of a sudden abraham had reached back his hand and he was going through with the camp commandment of the lord and he said abraham stay thy hand oh and there as abraham oh he was being obedient to the word of god he'd come to the place that god had showed him he was going through with the word of god and there he took his hand back to to follow through on the commandment of god he said abraham oh if god would have waited one more second if god would have made it five more seconds but i want to tell you god is always on time he's right on time in your hour of despair and your hour of calamity i don't care what it is it was in that place of manifestation that abraham knew him as jehovah jairo my provider god is more than able to provide you a sacrifice this morning no matter what you're going through no matter what your trial is i want to tell you he's still jehovah jireh what are you talking about brother matthew the same jehovah jireh that provided abraham a ram is the same jehovah gyre that spoke squirrels into existence it's the same jehovah joy that descended with an open book in hand and called your name by the spoken word of god it's the same jehovah chirag that is here this morning jehovah chara speaking words of life into the pride of jesus christ that you are an invincible army you are perfect you are upright there is none like you in all the earth oh hallelujah why don't you receive it oh glory to god why don't you receive it this morning i say oh what a thanksgiving oh my what are you so cast down about bride what are you being so reserved about why don't you shake off those heavy pans and lift up holy hands what's holding you back this morning you got something to praise him for you got something to rejoice about oh the mighty talker the mighty god where is he he's right here in the building what do you have need of what is your hour of despair what altar are you laying on oh glory to god i don't know about you but i can identify with isaac a little bit no not that part of being a perfect sacrifice not the part of being a type of christ but i can identify with a part of being tied up i'm being bound and laid on an altar to die there in my sin and if it wasn't effective god oh hallelujah i was wrapped up i was tied up and i was bound in sin i was bound by spirits i was bound by lust i was bound by drugs i was bound by all the things of the world and i was tied up oh i was going to die it just seemed like at no time that sin and the penalty of sin was going to come down and take my life but jehovah jireh he said i am gone i have provided a sacrifice you don't have to die i will take your place oh what a savior what a redeemer oh hallelujah that's what i'm talking about this morning why don't you give him praise why don't you give him glory that's what we're here for what happened when them seals were open everything in heaven everything under the earth heard i john scream in his hand blessing and honor and glory oh let the world take record there's a pride of jesus christ that is echoing john the beloved insane blessings and honor and glory forever to the king of kings to the lord of lords blessing and honor being glory unto him forever and ever i just want to praise him i just want to worship him i just want to give him glory let me do it in the church house let me do it in the pulpit let me do it in my car let me do it in my house let me do it at my job let me do it when i walk down the street let me do it when i go to the supermarket i don't care because whom the son has made free it's free indeed and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty i got a liberty church don't try to take my liberty from me i have been set free well if you don't like it get next to me i can't help it i've been redeemed i said i've been redeemed does anybody know what it means oh he came to the pawn shop and he brought me out i was sold into sin by my first father adam the whole human race doomed to die but jehovah oh hallelujah jehovah jireh abraham the father of our faith he said son my god he's able my god is able to provide himself a sacrifice the only thing i know to do there's two laws there's two laws and if i disobey him it's death anyways did you hear me you're so worried about preserving yourself you're so worried about preserving your job you're so worried about trying to preserve your relationships i'm talking to somebody now but if you hear what god is telling you to disobey the word is death anyways but to obey him is life here there was two laws that was set before abraham the law of disobeying the word and certain death come into the household or the law of life and the prophet of god said oh hallelujah he would pick that up and say when when he came to mary and martha he would say to themself oh jesus if you would have been here if you would have been here my brother lazarus wouldn't have died he said i'm glad i wasn't here for your sake oh they started to say father if you would have been here now watch her approach she didn't come there with an attitude she didn't come there and say why didn't you come when we called you i thought you loved us why didn't you heal me when we were sick i thought you loved us i thought you were jehovah jireh i thought you were i alma i was healed by your stripes why am i going through that lord why did i lose my job why am i going through all this family i thought you loved me i called for you god and you didn't come but no she came with sweetness and reverence to the lord if you'd have been here my brother wouldn't have died he said don't worry he'll rise she said oh god i know i know in the generation general resurrection that he arise he said i am i am the resurrection i am the resurrection and she approached him with sweetness and humility said yes lord and when she had that right approach to him when she had that right respect unto the word that's when he said where'd you lay him the prophet of god said things were ready to spark then things were set in order it was nothing but drama then where'd you lay them i am the resurrection where's the place of manifestation that i'm going to call forth the dead and they're going to be made living where is the place of manifestation i am the resurrection the i am the resurrection is standing here this morning and his voice is going forth to call those which were dead unto life you were in dead denomination and dead unbelief in his word you were dead in sins and trespasses but god oh hallelujah by the divine promise have manifested his word in the end time and the voice of the seventh angel which was none other than the mighty angel coming down and putting one foot on the land and one foot on the sea i am the bread of life that cometh down out of heaven man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god this is the shout of thessalonians 4 17 i shall descend with a shout what is the shout oh it's the bread of life i am the bread that cometh down out of heaven this is the rapture the mighty angel has descended with an open book and he has called your name i am the resurrection pride come forth come out of denomination come out of your sin come out of your unbelief come out of your complexes oh does somebody identify with the word of the hour oh praise his wonderful name jehovah jireh my provider oh my praise his name hallelujah look you ain't got to go looking for it somewhere out there i'll start running around and trying to find something more everything you have need of is right here this morning jesus christ is here do you believe it jesus christ is here by faith he's just as here as if the prophet was here or what do you need to see a corporal body that's not how you see him because the word was made flesh and stood there in front of the sadducees and pharisees and they were blind oh but if you can just surrender to the law of faith and reach out and touch the lord oh praise the lord we'll just continue on by his grace so in the second verse here he says thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flocks of thy heard in the place which the lord shall choose to put his name there he says now you you can't you your sincerity and all that you want to confess you just can't take it to a methodist altar to a baptist author or to a pentecostal altar but there is an altar somewhere that he has chose to put his name in it and he would meet you in that place now if you get everything running just right it's going to run everything's set in order if there's a short in that wire the light won't come on because it's been grounded and then when you take one of god's word or on on one of his places and in your heart have selfish motives it'll ground the power of god right there you're the prophet now if you have your own if your own heart have selfish motives it'll ground the power of god right there if you do it it's because you want to be smart you want to be different from somebody else or something right there it's grounded it'll blow the fuse you're wrong you've got to come with sincerity with all your heart your motives and your objectives placed right on god he says then search for his place find where he said and bring it there if we confess our sins first john 1 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness search for the place find where he said it and bring it there there's a provided place for you this morning you ain't got to do this on your own job didn't have to do it on his own abraham didn't have to do it on his own isaac didn't have to do it on his own but there was a word that was spoken concerning him and if you could just search and find that place where he said it and just take it there oh isaiah 53 said he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed look take your burdens unto the lord and leave it there he said come unto me all ye who are heavy laden and i will give you rest you know that word means come unto me oh you are heavy laden with your spiritual obligations with your rituals and this routines of you trying to manifest the message on your own come unto me oh you are heavy laden and you're burdened by trying not to cut your hair you're trying to dress holy you're trying to match up you're trying to make yourself look like a believer and you're constantly struggling but he's saying come unto me all you who are struggling all you and come unto me and i will give you rest because when you surrender with some sincerity unto me i will come into you i will deliver you and it will no more be you living but it will be myself living in you and through you manifesting my word because you are the place that i have chosen to manifest my word oh hallelujah oh search for the place where he said it bring it there the prophet of god would say this he'd say i'll meet them in one place the place i put my name that's in jesus christ that's where god put his name that's the only place he'll meet you and it's christ it's the word it's growed from the feet the thighs and now it's in the head fixing to go manifesting in full measure the bride as same as the groom maybe i should read that again it's now in the head fixing to go manifesting in full measure the bride as same as the groom look christ the word is manifesting his full measure in you the same as the groom that's the place of manifestation not another place the place where he put his name in his name is his word now we'll end going down this line here the prophet isaiah said in isaiah 7 14 he said therefore the lord shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel so that mary was the place of manifestation because the word was found in her the prophet said a virgin shall conceive and she did the word said god said through the prophet a virgin shall conceive and she did and mary was found conceived by the holy ghost and that was a sign that the word had now taken on flesh and was being manifested the portion of that word that mary was to play in it which was the portion of a virgin shall conceive and she did it was a sign and in the face of all the critics and in the face of all the scoffers look the bible even says joseph being a just man he was like man i mean i mean come on all of us know that there's there's only one way this works mary i know you got some crazy story okay you you you got pregnant by an angel i mean that's that's a hard one especially if you're the guy that's supposed to marry her and she's pregnant with another man's baby that's a hard one it's one thing to have somebody ask for forgiveness and repent and say i'm sorry this happened that happened but they're sticking to their story no joseph no i'm telling you i went out i was going down to the wash and i was going down there and an angel appeared under me and said hail mary thou are highly favored amongst women and you are going to that which is going to conceive in you is going to be of the holy ghost and she said i said joseph i even told the angel how can these things be and he said the holy ghost will overshadow you and his name will be called emmanuel i mean you talk about a a hard spot for joseph to be in but joseph being a just man he was as he thought upon these things god came to him by a vision and said fear not joseph to take mary to be thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and you shall call his name jesus oh it was a divine revelation that came unto joseph and a divine revelation that came unto mary and it was a sign that prophecy was being fulfilled just kind of getting close to where we maybe need to end the prophet goes on to say in paragraph 210 and god's provided place we're trying to bring this down to the place where you're living down to the place and manifestation of the word in you that you can see yourself in the message that you can see yourself in the bible just like uh god visited abraham just like god visited mary just as god visited joseph god has visited you god has visited the bride and this generation and god has spoken to you he says but we must find where he put his name for in his it is his only provided gate amen glory watch where did he put his name in his son so now here's joseph and mary and the very thing that has been conceived in them is the word made flesh where god is putting his name and in paragraph 2 13 he says jesus said i came in my father's name and you received me not you want the scripture on that saint john 5 43 he said i came in my father's name and you received me not then the father put his own name which is jesus in the son notice that the father put his own name and jesus which was the son and and that and he's the way he's the door he's the house he's where god chose to put his name god never put his name in me he never put his it in the church he never put it in the methodist baptist catholic but he put it in christ the anointed emmanuel and the name is the word because he is the word amen what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god i want to say the word interpreted is the name of the lord jesus christ that's god's chosen place of worship under the revealed word of the hour oh jesus said this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and they honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me why because they were blind to the manifestation of the word among them i said they were blind to the manifestation of the word among them the place that god had chosen the place of manifestation was in jesus christ the place that he chose to place his name and that was the interpretation of his word a virgin shall conceive and she did and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and he did oh my but second corinthians 3 14 would say but their minds were blinded for unto this day remain at the same veil and taken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ watch this but even unto this day when moses is red the veil is upon their heart when the new testament is read the veil is upon their heart when the voice of the sound if seventh angel goes forth the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away i want to notice you now what speaks to my heart he says but unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn the lord i want you to oh my goodness praise god what was malachi 4 5 it was the turning of the heart he said behold i will send you elijah and what was he to do he was to turn the heart it was to take away the veil even so as it was in the days of the revealing of the son of man what was it it was the taking away of the veil the mighty god unveiled before us the word interpreted is the manifestation of the lord jesus christ oh hallelujah what did he say what was it when they took the picture out there on february 28th when the prophet picked that up he said what is it he said turn it to the right that's our lord up there this day this scripture is fulfilled and finishing out the quote the prophet would say flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which in heaven has revealed this to you who i am and upon this rock watch this now and upon this rock i will build my place of worship upon this rock i will build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down oh hallelujah he that believeth in me the works that i do shall you do also where is the manifestation of the word greater works shall you do because i go unto the father where is the word now being manifested the word is being manifested in the bride oh if the musicians would come we'll finish down this line oh hallelujah praise his wonderful name flesh and blood have not revealed this to you it's a revelation you can try to walk people through it you can try to show it you can tie the scriptures you can tie the quote you can show them the pictures you can tell them about 1933 you can tell them about 1950 you can tell them about february 28th you can tell them about march you can tell them about the seals you can tell them what god did for you but if the veil remaineth upon their heart but if that veil oh if god would ever take it away and god had a provided way by the seventh angel messenger that by the sounding of the seventh angel message that was what god had prophesied that was the manifestation of the word to take the veil away from your heart if we can just focus on this last quote here [Music] oh hallelujah just if we can just give our attention real quick as they play softly god had a certain place he met abraham and there abraham worshipped [Music] oh we got so much to be thankful for [Music] all down through the testament and its promised word [Music] will be interpreted in you by him and his promised word will be interpreted in you by him have

is in shambles and you're disappointed in your decisions and your you can't even understand how you got to where you are [Music] quit listening to those things god knew you would be sitting here this morning he knew the decisions you would have made so now let's not look in the past let's look to right now because god is able to provide a sacrifice god is jehovah jireh [Music] and his promised word will be interpreted in you by him did you get that the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in you will be a written epistle of god right of all men not what you claim but what god does through you will speak out louder than anything you could claim god said these shines shall follow them that believe that speaks through you oh we have our scoffers we have our critics we have many people that claim to believe the message but what god does through you will speak out louder than anything you can claim let's all stand the place of manifestation for the spoken word of the hour is in you you are that place oh we could have took a time to go all the way back to genesis and how the earth was the provided place for the spoken word seed to be planted there and

trial it was in the storm it was the flashing and the lightning we're in the face of the trial there was that word in there that said though he slay me yet i will trust him at his darkest hour there was a revelation he said though the skin worms eat my flesh i know i will stand on the earth and see my redeemer you might have been serving god for a while you might have been going at a while you've
