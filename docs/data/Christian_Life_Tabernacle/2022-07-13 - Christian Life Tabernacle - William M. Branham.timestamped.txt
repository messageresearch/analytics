[3:58] god bless you everybody
[4:00] i'm talking to an invisible
[4:03] audience uh this evening but i
[4:06] trust you're there so let's just take a
[4:08] moment and bow our heads in prayer and
[4:11] ask the lord to bless us our gracious
[4:13] heavenly father
[4:14] we've just taken a moment this evening
[4:17] to
[4:19] fellowship with the people
[4:22] to give a little building report
[4:24] a little
[4:26] financial update
[4:29] lord and just have a time to use this
[4:32] time
[4:34] to
[4:36] just draw us closer father inspire us
[4:38] and
[4:39] let us all feel connected we ask that
[4:42] you bless us and those that have taken
[4:45] the opportunity to tune in
[4:47] may their hearts be lifted may they keep
[4:50] us in prayer
[4:51] and we just ask for your grace to be our
[4:53] portion this evening
[4:55] in jesus precious and
[4:58] holy name we pray amen
[5:01] amen as we get started tonight i'd like
[5:03] to
[5:04] read a scripture found over in
[5:08] philippians and
[5:11] i'd like to
[5:12] read the first
[5:16] 13 verses of the
[5:18] book of
[5:20] philippians and
[5:23] first philippians 2 1-13
[5:26] and the scripture reads like this i hope
[5:29] you have your bible or you pull it up on
[5:31] whatever
[5:32] instrument that you have
[5:35] but it says if there therefore be any
[5:37] consolation in christ
[5:41] if any comfort of love
[5:44] if any fellowship of the spirit
[5:48] if any vows
[5:50] and
[5:50] mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be
[5:55] like-minded
[5:56] having the same love
[5:59] being of one accord
[6:01] and of one mind
[6:04] let nothing be done through
[6:07] strife or vain glory
[6:10] but in lowliness
[6:12] of mind
[6:13] letting each esteem
[6:17] the other
[6:18] better than themselves
[6:21] not
[6:22] look not every man on his own things
[6:26] but every man also on the things of
[6:29] others
[6:31] let this mind being you
[6:34] which was
[6:36] also in christ jesus
[6:39] who being in the form of god
[6:42] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[6:44] god
[6:45] but made himself of no reputation
[6:49] and took upon him the form of a servant
[6:53] and was made in the likeness of men
[6:57] i like that he took on the form
[7:01] of a servant
[7:02] and being found in the fashion
[7:07] as a man
[7:08] he humbled himself
[7:11] and became obedient unto death
[7:14] even the death of the cross
[7:17] wherefore god also have highly exalted
[7:20] him
[7:21] and given him a name which is above
[7:24] every name
[7:25] that at the name of jesus
[7:28] every knee should bow
[7:30] of things in heaven
[7:32] and things in earth
[7:34] and things under the earth
[7:36] and that every tongue should confess
[7:39] that jesus christ is lord
[7:41] to the glory of god the father
[7:44] wherefore my beloved
[7:46] as ye all
[7:47] as ye
[7:48] have always obeyed
[7:51] not as in my presence only
[7:54] but now much more in my absence
[7:58] work out your own salvation with fear
[8:01] and trembling
[8:02] for it is god which worketh in you both
[8:06] to will
[8:07] and to do
[8:09] of his good
[8:10] pleasure amen we just asked the lord to
[8:14] bless his word i thought i'd take just a
[8:16] moment
[8:17] to
[8:19] share
[8:21] with you
[8:22] if i could say my vision
[8:25] and my hope for the church
[8:28] and to
[8:31] share with you the direction that i feel
[8:35] led to go in
[8:37] and i believe that starts with
[8:42] my feeling
[8:43] towards the word of god and the message
[8:46] of the hour
[8:48] and i believe that
[8:50] the message that's been given that we've
[8:53] been able to capture
[8:55] in the form of tapes
[8:57] and in the form of
[9:00] booklets and
[9:01] other means
[9:03] is the revealed word of god for our hour
[9:07] and i believe that through a messenger
[9:11] that god
[9:12] in his infinite wisdom
[9:15] had a device
[9:18] created that could or invented could i
[9:22] say it that way
[9:23] that captured that voice
[9:26] that uh
[9:27] that it wouldn't be secondhand
[9:30] that we could hear that voice ourselves
[9:33] directly ourselves and by hearing that
[9:37] voice each of us individually
[9:40] we could work out our own salvation with
[9:43] fear and trembling
[9:45] it caused us to have a great uniqueness
[9:48] to have something that's individual
[9:52] because we're all hearing the gospel
[9:54] that's preached
[9:56] but the spirit of god is breaking it to
[9:58] each of us and feeding it to each of us
[10:01] as we have need of
[10:03] i don't believe that this message should
[10:06] be
[10:07] placed in the form of doctrines
[10:09] or creeds
[10:11] or have periods put on it
[10:14] or have it explained or interpreted
[10:18] or
[10:19] to have
[10:21] it become
[10:23] something that has now has to have
[10:26] the authority of men ruling over it
[10:30] between the people and the voice itself
[10:33] i believe that every believer has direct
[10:37] access to the voice of the prophet of
[10:39] god
[10:40] and that the holy spirit from that voice
[10:43] can get each individual revelation
[10:48] and
[10:49] uh the scripture here that we spoke said
[10:51] let this mind be in you
[10:53] that was in
[10:55] the lord jesus
[10:56] and we know that
[10:59] a word is a thought expressed
[11:02] so when someone speaks something you've
[11:04] heard the expression i'm going to speak
[11:07] what's on my mind
[11:08] well we find out that what jesus spoke
[11:12] was the mind of god what god had on his
[11:15] mind is what the lord spoke
[11:19] and so by the word of god we know what
[11:22] god thinks
[11:24] and
[11:25] our desire is that through the preaching
[11:29] of the gospel
[11:30] and the sharing of the message of now
[11:32] the hour that this mind would now come
[11:36] in us
[11:37] that we would have the mind of the lord
[11:41] and
[11:42] act and
[11:44] for that
[11:45] great
[11:46] ministry that has come
[11:49] there had to be an absolute voice
[11:52] somewhere
[11:53] someone that was the true voice
[11:56] of the word of god the divine
[11:58] interpreter of god's word so without
[12:02] question
[12:04] we could identify it as being the
[12:06] thoughts of god
[12:08] not many men have different doctrines
[12:10] and different ideas
[12:12] but we have been built on something
[12:14] that's been totally vindicated
[12:16] and totally true
[12:18] and totally proven
[12:21] not to waver
[12:22] so my approach
[12:25] to the message is that
[12:29] there's still life
[12:31] in the message
[12:33] and still stored up food
[12:36] and still revelations that are hid
[12:40] and and
[12:41] there to be brought out by his spirit in
[12:45] season
[12:46] and each time these revelations are
[12:49] brought out whether to you individually
[12:52] in your own prayer life
[12:54] through the ministry of the local church
[12:57] through your prayer life through
[12:59] whichever way that god would choose to
[13:01] speak you
[13:03] the revelations of god's mind brings you
[13:06] more into his image
[13:09] and that's what that
[13:12] our
[13:13] goal is in all of our goal is and the
[13:17] love of god was summed up in this manner
[13:21] that
[13:23] as he was in this world
[13:26] as he is
[13:28] so are we in this world
[13:31] and
[13:32] so the word of god
[13:34] this great message of the hour that we
[13:37] have
[13:38] has been brought to show us what that he
[13:41] is
[13:42] so as we have a revelation of what he is
[13:46] then we know what we can become
[13:50] and he said let this mind be in you
[13:53] that he thought it not robbery
[13:56] to be equal with god
[13:58] and we shouldn't think that robbery to
[14:00] feel that we can become obedient to the
[14:03] word of god and that jesus christ can
[14:06] express himself out through us
[14:09] i know there's many different
[14:12] approaches to the message of the hour
[14:16] i know there's some that
[14:18] believe that the message we've got the
[14:21] message now
[14:22] we understand the teachings in the
[14:24] message
[14:25] that
[14:26] that we know what brother branham taught
[14:29] and now we're waiting for a spiritual
[14:32] outpouring or a spiritual movement
[14:36] to move the church
[14:37] and that manifestation is
[14:41] manifested in
[14:44] in the expression of uh worship or the
[14:48] expression of of great joy and a
[14:52] jubilance and
[14:54] and of great works being done in our
[14:56] midst and and i believe that i believe
[14:59] every believer should have that not just
[15:02] in the church building
[15:04] it's like the little brook
[15:06] they came up and asked the little brook
[15:09] why are you so bubbly why are you so
[15:12] full of joy and
[15:13] and
[15:14] they asked the book he said is it
[15:16] because the deer come drink from you
[15:19] because there's blessings and signs and
[15:22] and wonders and flowers and butterflies
[15:25] and all those things and all the things
[15:26] around him he said no
[15:28] really why i'm so happy because there's
[15:31] something on the inside of me bubbling
[15:34] and pushing up
[15:35] and that's our goal is to
[15:38] is to come such in love with this
[15:42] message
[15:43] and such in love with the word of god
[15:46] having such confidence
[15:48] that it's the truth that it becomes a
[15:51] living fountain bubbling up in us and
[15:55] it brings us closer into the image of
[15:59] god and closer into the mind of god and
[16:02] the way that god thinks
[16:05] and so i i'd like to read this statement
[16:09] that what it comes from
[16:12] just a few paragraphs
[16:14] out of uh convinced
[16:17] and concerned
[16:19] and uh
[16:21] and i hope i i have it right
[16:24] and he's he's he's talking about what
[16:27] he's preached
[16:29] and he says
[16:31] he says there's something wrong
[16:33] somewhere
[16:34] still doing the same thing
[16:36] still the same gospel
[16:39] i've never changed
[16:41] a bit since i started
[16:44] i just started with the naked bear word
[16:48] of god
[16:49] and i stayed right on it ever since
[16:53] 32 years i've been behind the pulpit
[16:57] and never taking it
[16:59] never taken anything back
[17:02] or changed any thing
[17:05] stated it's just the way i started
[17:09] i can't take it back
[17:11] it's god's word
[17:14] and if
[17:16] this is convinced and concerned
[17:19] uh paragraph 70
[17:21] uh preached in uh
[17:25] on june 10th
[17:27] in 1962
[17:30] he says he he says
[17:34] he says
[17:36] but and i can't
[17:38] take it back
[17:39] it's god's word
[17:41] and if i stay
[17:43] say
[17:45] it just like it's said here
[17:50] the next time
[17:51] i have to say the same thing
[17:54] because here is
[17:56] the way it's wrote here see
[18:00] so
[18:01] just can't do anything else about it
[18:05] it's the holy spirit
[18:07] is still doing
[18:09] the same thing so what's the holy spirit
[18:12] doing it's saying the same thing this
[18:14] word does and it can't be back it can't
[18:17] be changed it's the same because it's
[18:19] the word of god
[18:21] and so as we just finish up on this it
[18:24] says
[18:26] so but it looks like there's not enough
[18:29] concern
[18:32] now i'm wondering why
[18:34] why isn't there
[18:36] a concern like there used to be
[18:40] it's i believe the reason
[18:43] that
[18:44] if there's not
[18:46] so much concern
[18:48] as there
[18:49] used to be
[18:52] they're not as convinced as they used to
[18:56] be
[18:56] you have to be convinced before you're
[18:59] concerned
[19:01] and
[19:01] and
[19:02] i think that's an important thing
[19:05] that we don't fade away from being
[19:08] totally convinced
[19:10] that this message is god's provided way
[19:14] for his bride to escape this world
[19:17] i would hate to feel that
[19:20] that people aren't as convinced
[19:23] anymore
[19:24] that there's truths in this message and
[19:27] there's revelation in this message and
[19:30] there's leadership in this message
[19:33] and there's things there that god can
[19:35] still speak to us
[19:37] that we that we would
[19:39] lose confidence in the message or feel
[19:42] that the message has had its day it's
[19:44] had its time
[19:46] uh that that that god's now wanting us
[19:50] to forge
[19:51] forward without it that he's wanting us
[19:54] to go
[19:55] in the realms in places that
[19:59] we haven't been before and i believe
[20:02] there's places that we haven't been
[20:04] before but i believe it's the word of
[20:06] god that's going to lead us into those
[20:08] places because i believe that god's got
[20:11] a creative will
[20:13] and and that we don't have to produce it
[20:16] that if we follow the word of god and we
[20:19] become have our revelation increased
[20:22] from the revealed word of god as our
[20:24] revelations increases and as the word of
[20:27] god increases in our knowledge of the
[20:29] word of god and our knowledge and
[20:32] understanding of what that he is that
[20:34] that produces something in you that is
[20:38] actually his nature
[20:41] and he did the works that he did because
[20:44] of his nature
[20:46] because he what he was
[20:48] and so we're looking for
[20:50] a great uh
[20:54] desire in our heart
[20:56] to have his mind
[20:59] and that's what
[21:01] this message of the hour does
[21:04] it puts the mind of god in you
[21:07] because his mind is his word
[21:11] they're one and the same thing
[21:13] what is a word it's a thought expressed
[21:16] what is the word of god it's the
[21:18] thoughts expressed what is the message
[21:20] of the hour it's god's thoughts
[21:22] expressed to us that we can take on the
[21:26] mind of christ
[21:28] and then when you take on the mind of
[21:30] christ it changes the way that you see
[21:33] things it changes the way that you look
[21:35] at things it changes it the way that you
[21:37] perceive things
[21:39] how would you like when you could become
[21:41] such to a place
[21:43] that you looked out at the people and
[21:45] they say they look like
[21:47] sheep
[21:48] without a shepherd
[21:51] oh how i would long to gather you up how
[21:54] i would long to brood over you
[21:57] okay such such a love
[21:59] and
[22:00] and
[22:01] in such a concern
[22:03] of for the lost in the dying the prophet
[22:06] god said that you can't even be
[22:08] spiritual
[22:11] until you have a real design desire
[22:14] for the sick for for the needy for the
[22:18] lost
[22:20] he says
[22:22] he says you have to be convinced
[22:24] convinced before you can be concerned
[22:28] not concerned
[22:29] you take the time now instead of
[22:32] evangelizing and trying to do something
[22:35] everybody wants a great big school
[22:38] or a great big something that they can
[22:41] teach or make ministers or have better
[22:45] pulpit manners and so forth
[22:48] you know what i believe i believe that
[22:50] the people is not convinced that jesus
[22:54] is coming soon
[22:56] i don't believe that they're convinced
[22:59] that he's coming in this age
[23:01] and i believe that's the reason that
[23:04] they're not concerned because they're
[23:06] not
[23:08] fully convinced right they're not
[23:12] convinced
[23:13] that he's with them
[23:16] if they were they would come back to the
[23:18] word that's right and now many people
[23:22] not
[23:23] people might
[23:25] misunderstand it
[23:26] but
[23:28] and and i thought that if if they're
[23:29] convinced they said they would come back
[23:32] to the word
[23:34] back to the word back to what's going to
[23:37] transform them but they're not convinced
[23:40] the word's going to transform them
[23:42] they're not
[23:43] so they've developed they feel that that
[23:46] that there's a spirit that's been a
[23:48] transformer but the holy spirit never
[23:50] came to speak of itself and the holy
[23:53] spirit is not
[23:55] it is not a different anointing the holy
[23:58] spirit is the word anointing the holy
[24:01] spirit is the revelation of the word of
[24:04] god the holy spirit is what quickens
[24:07] that word to you and makes that word
[24:10] real to you and alive to you that you
[24:12] can see it
[24:14] that's the holy spirit it didn't come to
[24:16] speed of itself it didn't come it didn't
[24:20] come to to have a ministry of its own
[24:23] the ministry of the
[24:25] spirit of god lies within the word
[24:28] because the spirit only testifies to the
[24:30] word the spirit only bears witness to
[24:33] the word
[24:35] now there's anointing
[24:38] it falls on the just and the unjust
[24:41] that the the the believer the true
[24:44] believer is convinced
[24:47] that the word message that's been given
[24:49] us the peering of the pillar of fire the
[24:52] opening of the seals that within that
[24:55] framework is the revelation that's going
[24:58] to cause the rapture
[25:01] and that's where we want to feed from
[25:05] and we want to be convinced
[25:09] that we don't feel it's robbery
[25:12] to bring this word
[25:15] to a lost and
[25:17] dying generation
[25:19] so i i believe there's so many things
[25:22] and as the word is revealed to us
[25:26] and as
[25:28] we we are more convinced and more
[25:31] concerned
[25:33] what we will find out is that and i'll
[25:35] maybe speak on this sunday morning we
[25:38] will start seeing him appear
[25:44] in our lives
[25:46] we'll see him manifesting himself
[25:50] through us
[25:51] in situation after situation we will
[25:54] actually see him uniting himself with
[25:58] his word believers performing
[26:02] wonders through their ministries
[26:07] each of our lives is a ministry
[26:10] we'll see him people will testify of him
[26:13] being on the scene
[26:15] in so many circumstances so many places
[26:21] that it it it's phenomenal i i'm eating

[27:22] pews we we don't want to just sit back
[27:25] and absorb knowledge and absorb
[27:28] sermons and absorb revelations we want
[27:31] them to be able to go out into the world
[27:34] in their lives
[27:35] and take a stand on god's word and see
[27:38] jesus actually appear
[27:40] on the scene
[27:42] doing what they can't do
[27:45] and that's what his appearance proves
[27:48] that he can do what man can't do
[27:52] oh i'm excited
[27:54] for what's coming
[27:56] and so i just wanted to share with you
[27:59] that that's my my heart's desire is that
[28:02] each believer will know that the
[28:05] presence of the lord is with them and
[28:08] they'll be testifying of his appearing
[28:11] in their lives performing this word in
[28:16] every situation
[28:18] and circumstance
[28:20] and that my heart's desire
[28:22] is to move for
[28:24] that and so i just wanted to
[28:27] share that with you tonight now
[28:30] in our process of reaching this goal and
[28:34] wanting to go forward and
[28:37] and share the gospel
[28:39] uh we found out that we're gonna have to
[28:42] provide
[28:43] some
[28:45] facilities
[28:46] and we our desire is to provide some
[28:49] facilities for
[28:52] our our children our sunday school
[28:56] our young people
[28:58] and in order to do that
[29:01] we felt that we would need to have a
[29:04] sanctuary
[29:05] at least big enough to hold our
[29:08] congregation
[29:10] and
[29:11] right now
[29:12] our services are running
[29:15] between 320
[29:18] to 340 people
[29:20] and that includes some people sitting in
[29:23] their cars it doesn't include
[29:26] the people sitting in their cars
[29:29] nor the people that are at home
[29:31] streaming
[29:32] so we're not really sure we don't spend
[29:35] a lot of time counting the people that
[29:37] attend here
[29:39] but on and off we usually run 320 to 340
[29:43] people with different people gone
[29:47] every time sometimes 20 to 15
[29:51] or more people so i would imagine if we
[29:55] gathered everybody together we'd
[29:57] probably
[29:58] be
[29:59] somewhere
[30:00] in the range of
[30:03] uh 300 and
[30:05] maybe 80
[30:06] 70 to 380 people so we're trying to
[30:09] build a church that will seat
[30:12] comfortably very comfortably
[30:15] of 420 people
[30:18] and that would include
[30:21] a spacing of about three feet between
[30:24] pews
[30:26] so that means the end of the pew would
[30:28] be here
[30:29] and the next few would start here
[30:33] so you'd have to this much space to the
[30:36] back of the pew from your knees right
[30:38] here
[30:39] about three feet you can walk without
[30:42] fitting up so that's our goal if we
[30:44] outgrow the 420 we'll just start
[30:47] squeezing
[30:49] and you know how much we can squeeze
[30:52] and then we'll have nice wide aisles
[30:55] and so i'll we'll show you some photos
[30:57] of that but let's just talk for a moment
[31:00] about this building
[31:02] what's going to happen to this building
[31:06] well what's going to happen to this
[31:07] building to about the center
[31:10] of the
[31:12] can you follow me with the camera
[31:14] caleb
[31:15] okay so
[31:18] what's going to happen is the baptistry
[31:20] is going to go
[31:22] and there's going to be a hallway
[31:25] here now
[31:27] and from this hallway
[31:29] you'll be able to go in a little hall
[31:32] and go into
[31:34] a bathroom that used to be my bathroom
[31:36] it'll now become a little bathroom for
[31:39] the sunday school teachers and for the
[31:41] children
[31:42] that they can
[31:45] that they can uh
[31:47] use a restroom there without going far
[31:51] am i okay
[31:54] pardon
[31:56] oh you want me to hold the mic
[31:58] okay i don't didn't know if you heard
[32:00] all that but
[32:01] um anyway it's about what we're doing
[32:04] back here
[32:07] okay
[32:08] all righty so we're gonna so my office
[32:11] is gonna become
[32:13] now a
[32:14] sunday school teacher work room
[32:18] where they can have a copy machine
[32:20] all their sunday school supplies
[32:23] and a little place to get together some
[32:25] tables to prepare
[32:27] a message
[32:29] their sunday school lesson
[32:31] and then from
[32:33] right about where
[32:36] this little
[32:38] spot is here
[32:40] just a little bit on the other side now
[32:42] this will become a classroom
[32:45] so there will be two large classrooms
[32:48] on this side of the church
[32:51] and then on this side of the church
[32:54] there will be three
[32:56] not as large
[32:58] but large classrooms
[33:00] and that would allow
[33:04] us to have five sunday school classrooms
[33:07] and then the rest of the
[33:10] of the sanctuary which will no longer be
[33:13] a sanctuary
[33:15] going all the way back these the
[33:18] interpretation walls will be taken out
[33:21] the walls where the sound booth will be
[33:23] taken out
[33:25] the sunday little sunday school
[33:28] room will be done away with and all this
[33:30] will become one open hallway
[33:33] after the sunday school rooms as a
[33:35] fellowship area and there will still be
[33:41] the two bathrooms back there
[33:43] so if they were to follow me down
[33:46] here
[33:48] i could just give you a general idea of
[33:51] what's going on
[33:55] so
[33:56] right right about here
[33:58] somewhere would be the end of the sunday
[34:01] school area
[34:03] right here
[34:04] the last two classrooms there will be a
[34:06] hall right down the middle
[34:08] and then this will all be classroom
[34:11] and that'll all be classroom
[34:13] the last two classrooms
[34:16] will have an accordion
[34:19] wall on it so they can be opened up and
[34:22] that classroom space can be used
[34:25] for more seating if we had a vin event
[34:29] the ceiling now will come straight
[34:31] across
[34:32] from
[34:33] the corners there it'll be a flat
[34:36] ceiling
[34:37] above it'll be storage
[34:38] sprinkler lines air conditioning and
[34:41] everything the rest of this will all be
[34:43] an open
[34:45] fellowship hall
[34:47] and we'll convert our kitchen into a
[34:49] full kitchen
[34:51] that's phase two of our building
[34:54] right here in this space between these
[34:57] two windows right here
[34:59] yeah i i hope they're following me
[35:02] and you can hear me
[35:06] this right here will become the hallway
[35:11] do you have me there bill
[35:16] all right
[35:18] tell me when i when they got me again
[35:21] i'm in right
[35:22] okay right here
[35:24] is where the hallway is going to connect
[35:27] this building with the other building
[35:30] so our children don't have to go outside
[35:33] they'll go into a hall
[35:35] when people come in if our bathrooms got
[35:37] too crowded they would have overflow
[35:40] access
[35:41] to these things so that's the plan for
[35:44] this building after we move over
[35:47] into the other
[35:49] building
[35:51] we will
[35:54] convert this building
[35:56] into
[35:58] excuse me for turning my back to
[36:01] everybody
[36:08] so that's our plans uh
[36:11] for this building
[36:13] and then um
[36:16] and then so
[36:17] now we want to talk about um
[36:21] where we are
[36:23] on our
[36:25] existing building and
[36:27] so we have a little some little video
[36:30] clips and some
[36:31] pictures
[36:33] and some um
[36:34] things like that we'll show you
[36:37] just to give you a little background on
[36:40] the whole history here
[36:42] is that
[36:43] um
[36:45] we're in our church and
[36:47] and
[36:50] you know we little thoughts begin to
[36:52] sprinkle into our mind about maybe
[36:54] building something bigger
[36:56] or having something else
[36:58] and i don't know maybe it was about
[37:00] seven years maybe
[37:02] ago that the property next door
[37:05] came up for sale
[37:10] was that that long ago okay i don't know
[37:12] how long ago i purchased it
[37:15] so anyway in about 2011 the property
[37:19] next door came for sale there was a
[37:22] great big sign put on it
[37:25] that the city of euless was selling the
[37:28] property
[37:30] now that's
[37:32] a
[37:34] 2.75 acres
[37:37] right in
[37:39] the middle of bedford
[37:41] i don't know if you've been looked
[37:42] around but every nook and cranny in this
[37:45] town is getting a little housing
[37:47] development
[37:48] put on it
[37:50] it stayed there for
[37:52] about four or five months
[37:55] and nobody said anything about it
[37:59] so the mayor
[38:01] told the
[38:02] city
[38:03] worker i know of the city manager to go
[38:05] put
[38:06] the card in my mailbox
[38:10] and ask me if i would be interested
[38:14] in purchasing that property
[38:18] so
[38:20] it just so happened at that time there
[38:22] was a little bit of internal fighting
[38:24] going on between the city of euless and
[38:26] the city of medford
[38:28] and the city of ulis owned that property
[38:31] so i contacted the gentleman and and he
[38:34] said well what would you give us for
[38:36] that property
[38:37] i said about fifty thousand dollars he
[38:40] said fine perfect
[38:43] and we bought that property next door
[38:46] for fifty thousand dollars
[38:49] at that time
[38:50] there was a great big water tower on the
[38:52] prop property and many many metal
[38:55] buildings
[38:57] well so we hired we took down the metal
[39:00] buildings and sold all the scrap metal
[39:03] we took down the power
[39:05] the
[39:06] water tower and sold all that and
[39:09] everything that we sold came up to about
[39:11] a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars
[39:14] for the scrap metal
[39:16] it cost us about fifty five thousand
[39:18] dollars to take it down
[39:20] so we ended up with that
[39:23] property
[39:24] basically paid
[39:26] for and a few years ago
[39:29] at that time the church couldn't afford
[39:32] to buy the property
[39:34] so i personally financed it and after it
[39:36] was paid for i donated it back
[39:39] to the church
[39:40] so that's how we got to where we had we
[39:43] had this property
[39:45] so we decided that
[39:48] we would build on it so our next project
[39:51] was to plant the property and make it
[39:53] all one property
[39:55] so
[39:56] um that's the
[39:58] that
[39:59] has all been done
[40:01] except for the
[40:03] the final city stamp
[40:05] took of approval and we have to have the
[40:08] fire
[40:10] lanes in
[40:11] and the fire hydrants and all those
[40:14] things in that's where we are now
[40:16] we're at the stage now
[40:20] if you've been by the church
[40:22] you've seen when you look outside it
[40:24] looks like a popsicle stick farm
[40:28] with all the popsicle sticks coming out
[40:31] of the ground
[40:32] that's because we're getting ready to
[40:35] start the work on the parking lots
[40:38] so i don't know ben maybe if we could
[40:40] just
[40:42] show a few clips
[40:44] of some photographs some clips
[40:47] that's where we are now we're putting in
[40:49] the water main water line
[40:51] is coming in for all the fire hydrants
[40:56] and we're getting ready to
[41:00] clear
[41:01] all those things can they see that
[41:03] photograph that i see
[41:06] all right that's the piles of dirt
[41:10] that we had trucks
[41:12] bring in
[41:13] and so this is what the
[41:16] land
[41:17] been looking like we've brought lots of
[41:19] dirt in
[41:20] and now
[41:22] uh you can see the dirt everywhere
[41:24] and now
[41:26] we've leveled all that dirt out
[41:31] okay
[41:33] so these are just different photographs
[41:36] of
[41:37] the different projects that's the
[41:39] construction entrance
[41:41] that's the piles of dirt again that we
[41:44] have to all flatten out
[41:46] and we've been flattening out so this is
[41:49] what our project looks like
[41:51] from the air
[41:54] and a little video
[42:00] going over
[42:02] yeah orlando uh
[42:05] brother orlando took these videos with
[42:07] his little
[42:08] uh drone so
[42:11] um
[42:15] and though
[42:16] we've had all this uh
[42:20] going on and so
[42:22] we've changed quite a bit of this now
[42:25] but uh
[42:28] that's
[42:29] where we're at
[42:30] and now you notice that that parking lot
[42:33] that he just flew over most of that's
[42:36] taken up now
[42:38] and um
[42:39] so let's just go to some
[42:42] just play everything you have and
[42:45] and
[42:48] just photographs of
[42:50] different aspects of the construction
[42:56] that's our new roof i guess we put a new
[42:58] roof on the church building
[43:11] there i am probably trying to figure out
[43:13] what in the world i'm doing
[43:15] all right this happens to be a
[43:17] photograph of
[43:19] a phone line
[43:20] that is outside of the easement that we
[43:23] have to get the phone company to move
[43:26] so with david junior's help we've
[43:28] contacted
[43:30] att and they're in the process of
[43:33] getting that cable move for us
[43:36] we don't even know if it's alive
[43:40] and
[43:41] so this is just an overview of
[43:45] now you can see that all the piles of
[43:47] the dirt are now flattened out
[43:50] and we're getting ready to
[43:52] do the final grade and start building
[43:54] the parking lot
[44:03] and so they
[44:05] you can see those all there
[44:12] and and that's kind of a good
[44:15] video
[44:16] of where we are
[44:18] and then
[44:23] good video of the corner over there so
[44:26] um
[44:28] now this is uh
[44:29] the street up
[44:32] that they've shut down the lanes of the
[44:34] street now it's only two lanes out there
[44:38] and uh
[44:39] this is a video
[44:42] of the uh
[44:43] guys
[44:44] fixing to make the tap on the water line
[44:48] so that water lines about seven feet
[44:51] below the surface
[45:04] now
[45:05] this is our utility crew and that's the
[45:07] main 20-inch main water line
[45:10] and we're tapping it
[45:12] i believe with a
[45:14] 8 inch or 10 inch
[45:17] so
[45:21] so you can see the street there the
[45:23] construction in the street the hole in
[45:25] the street
[45:26] and just two lanes of uh
[45:29] traffic and we hope that they'll be done
[45:32] by sunday
[45:34] with the street so
[45:39] and then again just different
[45:41] photographs of the work that's going on
[45:44] today so
[45:48] is that um
[45:51] okay the other
[45:53] pictures that you took of the
[45:57] um
[45:58] we just okay um i don't know how many
[46:01] have seen it but this is a
[46:03] a drawing of what the
[46:07] new church is uh
[46:10] going to look like
[46:13] you can see the other church next door
[46:15] to it which is a 5 000 square foot
[46:18] church
[46:19] our new church is uh
[46:21] 10 000 square feet
[46:23] it's twice the size of the church that
[46:26] we have now and
[46:29] so that's how they'll look connected
[46:31] together just to
[46:33] give you an idea i don't know how many
[46:35] of you have
[46:38] seen this maybe for the first time but i
[46:40] i just hope it gets you involved in what
[46:44] we feel the lord's doing
[46:46] we're not just building this church for
[46:49] us
[46:49] we're building it for the people that
[46:51] we're going to share this message with
[46:54] amen so i'll show the other next one um
[46:58] okay that now this is
[47:01] um i don't know if that can be zoomed in
[47:03] on or brought any bigger or not
[47:06] but i hope you can see it yes this is
[47:09] the
[47:10] uh
[47:11] the floor plan of the new church
[47:15] and what those arrows that you see are
[47:18] that's the
[47:19] the egress plan or in other words that's
[47:22] how you
[47:23] you exit the building that shows you all
[47:25] the different ways to exit
[47:28] you can see the three offices at the
[47:30] bottom of the screen
[47:32] the platform you can see that we have
[47:35] four aisles
[47:37] uh four
[47:39] aisles or
[47:40] rows of seating
[47:42] the center rows are 13 feet apiece
[47:45] the same size we have now
[47:48] on each
[47:50] outside is a nine foot
[47:52] row
[47:53] and then we have aisles in between them
[47:58] i believe a five foot center aisle of
[48:00] four foot
[48:02] side aisles and three foot outside
[48:04] aisles and then you can notice we have a
[48:07] larger fourier
[48:09] with three doors to exit
[48:11] and then you can see the hallway
[48:14] connecting to the new church
[48:17] so that kind of gives you a a little
[48:21] idea of where that we are
[48:24] and
[48:25] what that we have
[48:27] going on so where are we right now
[48:30] we're finishing up the grade
[48:33] we're putting in the utilities
[48:35] we're building the storm drain detention
[48:38] pond
[48:39] and we're building the sidewalk
[48:42] so our goal is
[48:44] in
[48:45] three weeks time
[48:48] to have obtained our
[48:51] building permit
[48:53] we're doing our work now under our
[48:55] public works permit
[48:57] and we hope to be
[48:58] getting our building permit
[49:01] in about
[49:05] three to
[49:07] weeks time
[49:08] i hope to start pouring the parking lot
[49:11] so if we can get the parking lot poured
[49:14] by the middle of august or the end of
[49:16] august
[49:17] then we'll be able to
[49:19] park on our new parking lot
[49:21] take up the parking lot
[49:23] that we're parking on now and start
[49:26] putting the building foundation in
[49:30] so that's where
[49:32] we are there
[49:34] now just a little uh kind of
[49:37] understanding of how that
[49:40] our our finances are
[49:43] are going this isn't any way an official
[49:47] financial report
[49:49] uh
[49:50] tawanda
[49:51] hasn't uh would you get me a bottle of
[49:54] water darium
[49:57] towanda our church uh the
[50:01] treasurer
[50:02] and our
[50:03] church finance officer
[50:06] has not put his seal of approval on this
[50:09] financial report
[50:11] neither
[50:12] have the trustees
[50:14] so any heirs that are in this financial
[50:17] report are theirs
[50:21] no they're mine
[50:22] so
[50:23] um
[50:24] i we can get a much better um
[50:28] uh
[50:31] and i will have them prepare for you a
[50:34] much better
[50:35] financial report
[50:37] but just to let you know where we stand
[50:42] we have what we do with our offering
[50:45] is
[50:46] we have two offering accounts
[50:50] one is what we call our operation
[50:52] account
[50:53] and that takes our
[50:54] our ongoing expenses
[50:58] our lights our bills and all that we
[51:00] keep money set aside
[51:03] in an account to pay our bills
[51:06] their excess money
[51:09] that we have
[51:10] that we don't use
[51:13] goes into a building fund
[51:16] and along with the people that have
[51:18] written checks specifically for the
[51:21] building fund
[51:23] and in that building fund now
[51:26] we have a little probably a little over
[51:30] 580 000
[51:33] that is in our building fund
[51:36] all the work that you see going on now
[51:41] all the grading
[51:43] all the concrete removal
[51:46] all this
[51:47] sewer and a water work
[51:50] that is all being taken out of
[51:55] money that i set aside from our tithing
[51:58] my tithing account
[52:00] and set it aside
[52:03] that was a little over
[52:05] about four hundred thousand dollars
[52:08] so we're using the four hundred thousand
[52:10] dollars that's been set aside
[52:13] on all the site work
[52:16] and that and as soon as we get done with
[52:19] the site work
[52:20] and
[52:21] that's done
[52:22] then we'll move over to the building
[52:25] fund
[52:26] and start using our building fund money
[52:29] and also
[52:31] the money that we've
[52:32] received from a loan
[52:35] that we're getting so the church is
[52:37] borrowing a million three hundred
[52:40] thousand dollars
[52:41] with anticipation we're only going to
[52:44] use 600 000 of it
[52:48] and when we're all said and done we will
[52:50] only have a 600 000 mortgage
[52:53] so that's uh what's going on
[52:57] so as far as our offerings are go we
[53:01] know that
[53:03] there's a lot of inflation going on
[53:06] prices are higher than there ever have
[53:08] been gas is higher food is higher
[53:11] i guess inflation's almost up to nine
[53:14] percent
[53:15] well that's
[53:16] just about the difference
[53:19] in percentage
[53:20] between what our offering was last year
[53:23] at this time
[53:24] and this year
[53:26] at this time so
[53:28] right now um
[53:30] uh
[53:32] we've we've collected just around sixty
[53:35] thousand dollars
[53:37] uh
[53:38] um
[53:39] worth of uh offering last year
[53:42] we were
[53:43] right around 73 000 but we're still in
[53:47] good shape
[53:48] so
[53:49] we're not hurting
[53:51] we're not where we were last year
[53:54] but our economy is not where
[53:56] was last year expenses are where they
[53:59] were
[54:00] last year so the difference in the two
[54:02] is just about
[54:04] what inflation is
[54:06] so we know it's been hard on everybody
[54:10] the job market the inflation market
[54:12] gasoline expenses
[54:14] utilities travel food
[54:16] everything but we've done a good job
[54:18] absorbing that
[54:20] and the church is doing
[54:22] well
[54:23] so um
[54:25] you know so that's kind of where we are
[54:27] if you want to call me personally and
[54:30] get some more information i'm not real
[54:32] good with numbers we'll give you a more
[54:35] updated
[54:36] uh access to the building
[54:39] fund but
[54:42] so we just wanted to share that with you
[54:45] so you could have an understanding so
[54:48] during the construction process this
[54:50] week they're going to close the two
[54:54] accesses
[54:56] that we have for parking
[54:58] and we're only going to be down to one
[55:02] way to get into our property
[55:05] and that's the
[55:08] street access right here
[55:10] where the mailbox is so brother chris is
[55:13] going to come and just take a couple
[55:14] moments and
[55:16] give everybody an outlook
[55:19] on the parking
[55:21] uh for the next couple weeks
[55:24] and give us some ideas of where to park
[55:27] how to park and
[55:29] what to look for so
[55:31] lord bless you for those of you that are
[55:33] watching
[55:35] the one or two of you
[55:36] it's nice and that you've got it
[55:39] you can share your information brother
[55:41] chris go ahead and share
[55:43] with everybody
[55:46] god bless you just quick quick update as
[55:48] brother david said we're going to have
[55:50] one
[55:50] entrance in
[55:52] therefore we're going to have one exit
[55:55] so as he mentioned we're going to have
[55:56] the main
[55:57] entrance that's the original entrance of
[56:00] the building so as you come in there'll
[56:02] be somebody standing there to guide you
[56:04] through the parking lot
[56:06] you'll come all the way through the
[56:07] parking lot back to where brother david
[56:09] parks there's a thorough way back there
[56:12] you'll swing around and then we'll have
[56:14] people in the overflow parking lot that
[56:16] will help assist line the cars out and
[56:18] park them
[56:20] with that being said one entrance we
[56:22] have one exit so
[56:24] if we could get your help
[56:26] parents with children and really
[56:28] everybody if we could just be alert
[56:30] because we're going to have a lot of
[56:32] traffic coming through and exiting at
[56:34] the same time so let's all just kind of
[56:35] work together to help keep an eye on
[56:37] everybody
[56:39] same thing in exiting we're going to
[56:41] have people stationed out there to
[56:42] really kind of flag us
[56:44] on our way out so that way we can be on
[56:46] the lookout
[56:48] other than that
[56:50] okay that's it
[56:51] thank you
[56:52] that's the parking so
[56:54] uh my architect looked at me and he said
[56:57] brother david you're in the ugly phase
[57:00] of your project well
[57:02] we're going to go forward
[57:04] so things are going good god's moving on
[57:06] us
[57:07] and
[57:08] providing for us
[57:12] working on our behalf
[57:14] and he just seems to be appearing on the
[57:16] scene every day
[57:18] and so we're going to have great
[57:19] progress so remember the purpose that
[57:22] we're going is not for our own personal
[57:24] comfort but to find that last one
[57:29] to share this message everybody should
[57:31] have a right
[57:32] and when you're convinced it's the truth
[57:36] and you're convinced that this message
[57:38] will produce the character of christ in
[57:41] you
[57:41] and when the character of christ is in
[57:43] you you'll do the works that he did when
[57:46] his spirit is in you you'll have the
[57:49] concerns that he have
[57:51] you'll have the
[57:52] desire that he had that
[57:55] all men would be saved
[57:57] and that's what he is and
[57:59] and um
[58:00] i'm i'm anxious to get the building
[58:04] project behind us
[58:05] that
[58:06] we've take like i've said we've used
[58:08] four hundred thousand dollars of the
[58:11] tithing for the building for the get the
[58:13] ministry established to get the outreach
[58:16] established and then i'm anxious to
[58:19] start having that money freed up for the
[58:22] ministry and the missions
[58:24] the local ministry the outreach ministry
[58:28] and just to have us grow
[58:30] in the unity of love so um that's uh
[58:34] just a little update uh
[58:37] maybe it could have been put together
[58:39] but
[58:40] um better but we what we realized was
[58:43] that
[58:44] uh we realized with the construction it
[58:46] was
[58:47] not a good idea to have service tonight
[58:51] so someone said why don't you just give
[58:53] a report let everybody know
[58:55] well i'm not good at technology or
[58:58] reports but kayla bill did what he could
[59:01] thank you for chris and
[59:03] um on all
[59:05] six of seven eight of us that are here
[59:08] tonight

[59:14] god will get us through this night so
[59:16] god bless everybody we love you and we
[59:19] just trust that
[59:20] this little bit of information would
[59:23] help you and let you know where we're
[59:25] headed and we'll try to put together a
[59:28] little more
[59:29] sophisticated reports in the near future
[59:33] so
[59:33] god bless you so much let's bow our
[59:35] heads in prayer

[59:42] if you have a special prayer request or
[59:44] need tonight if the lord knows that if
[59:47] you'll just bow your heart to the lord
[59:50] you'll lift your hand to the lord

[1:01:03] ourselves for your appearing in our
[1:01:05] lives that you have a vessel set aside
[1:01:09] that you can manifest yourself through
