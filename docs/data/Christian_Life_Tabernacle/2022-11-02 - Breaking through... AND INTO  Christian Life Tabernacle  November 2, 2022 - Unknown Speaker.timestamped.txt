[37:00] prayer Heavenly Father
[37:02] you are the god that fights for us

[37:08] Lord that while we were yet sinners you
[37:12] died for us

[37:18] another Lord
[37:20] not only did you do that Lord you took
[37:21] our sin upon your back
[37:25] and you climb that Hill called gagafa
[37:29] they put you to an open shame
[37:32] you were beaten you were spitting your
[37:36] body it was tore open
[37:38] you were in such Agony of a broken heart
[37:40] that your your blood and
[37:43] the water separated within you
[37:48] to think that you did that for me Lord
[37:52] you did that for each one that's
[37:53] gathered together here tonight that we
[37:56] could be forgiven
[37:58] oh God I don't want that Christ to go
[38:01] paid in vain Lord I want to take full
[38:03] benefit tonight Lord
[38:05] I plead the precious shed blood of Jesus
[38:08] Christ tonight Lord for all of our sins
[38:11] and all of our iniquity Lord
[38:13] not only Lord that but there's power in
[38:15] the blood there's power to be changed
[38:18] there's power to be healed there's power
[38:21] to be delivered Lord so we're asking
[38:23] that you would come in a mighty way
[38:25] tonight Lord and that you would take
[38:26] control
[38:27] father may you just take
[38:29] this vessel Lord I Surrender it to you
[38:32] Lord that your Holy Spirit would come
[38:34] and rightly divide the word of Truth
[38:37] now you would break the bread of life to
[38:39] your children and as only you can we
[38:40] love you Lord
[38:41] we're thankful to you and ask all these
[38:43] things in your name the Lord Jesus
[38:45] Christ
[38:45] [Music]
[38:46] and praise His wonderful name
[38:49] if you have your Bibles we'll be reading
[38:50] out of Isaiah
[38:52] 42 verse 5.
[38:56] can y'all hear me okay
[38:59] I don't know if I can hear myself as
[39:01] well if they can just give me a touch
[39:02] more on the monitor
[39:05] if it gets a little too
[39:07] much we can let you know but Isaiah 42
[39:11] Amanda did Annie make it in I believe I
[39:14] heard that she was able to make it we
[39:15] had a visitor coming and just wanted to
[39:17] make her welcome just glad you could
[39:19] make it out to the house of God just
[39:21] pray the Lord would be your portion
[39:22] where are you at her there you are God
[39:24] bless you we're happy you're you're here
[39:25] may God be your portion it's just
[39:27] wonderful to see people still hungering
[39:29] and thirsting for God
[39:31] and I'm just thankful that if there's
[39:33] something in you that is hungering and
[39:34] thirsting for more that means there's
[39:36] more for you amen and that's what we're
[39:38] praying tonight that God would be your
[39:40] portion just reading out of Isaiah
[39:43] chapter 42 verse 5.
[39:49] it would read like this
[39:51] thus saith God the Lord he that created
[39:54] the heavens and stretched them out
[39:57] he that spread forth the Earth
[40:00] and that which cometh out of it he that
[40:03] giveth breath unto the people upon it
[40:06] and the spirit to them that walk therein
[40:09] I the Lord have called thee in
[40:11] righteousness and will hold thine hand
[40:14] and will keep thee and give thee for a
[40:16] covenant of the people for a light of
[40:19] the Gentiles you can take that down just
[40:21] a little bit there but I sure like it
[40:25] and as we just continue to read there
[40:29] to open the blind eyes to bring out the
[40:32] prisoners from the prison and them that
[40:35] sit in darkness out of the prison house
[40:38] I am the Lord that is my name I like
[40:42] that right there if there's any question
[40:43] what the name of the Lord is I am the
[40:46] Lord that is my name and my glory will I
[40:48] not give to another neither am I praise
[40:51] to engraven images amen we just ask a
[40:54] blessing upon the word you may have your
[40:56] seats just like to read this quote to
[40:59] lay a foundation here the prophet of God
[41:02] would say this there is a man here that
[41:04] can turn on the light
[41:09] he would say now I believe that the son
[41:11] and so forth was already in existence I
[41:13] believe the moon as it goes on Genesis 3
[41:16] to explain it but I believe that what
[41:18] was here that the world was going was
[41:21] going to use it and therefore and it
[41:23] moved in and there was a fog and a Mist
[41:25] all over the Earth making it dark and
[41:28] God said let there be light so notice
[41:31] what the prophet is saying he say look
[41:33] the Sun and the Moon and everything was
[41:34] in existence but there was something
[41:36] that was covering over the Earth and now
[41:38] God said let there be light and the
[41:40] Darkness faded away and there was a
[41:42] cloudless sky and I believe that's God's
[41:45] way of doing things in the Bible the
[41:48] next verse says and he separated the
[41:50] light from the darkness and the light he
[41:52] called day in the darkness he called
[41:54] night and God's word always separates
[41:57] light from Darkness see it's the word
[42:01] that does the separating see light from
[42:03] Darkness see if you want to if there's
[42:06] going to be a separation in the hour
[42:07] that we're living and it's going to have
[42:09] to come by the word of God it's not
[42:12] going to come through Creed it's not
[42:13] going to come through denominations it's
[42:14] not going to come through man's way of
[42:16] thinking because all of those things
[42:17] will be mixed with the darkness but God
[42:20] sent a word a true word to separate the
[42:23] light from the darkness he says that God
[42:24] ever does the same thing when he gets
[42:27] ready to use anything I like that when
[42:29] he gets ready to use anything that means
[42:31] anybody any person anything when God
[42:34] ever does the same thing when he gets
[42:36] ready to use anything like he God got
[42:38] ready to use this old star or whatever
[42:40] it was this world he had to separate the
[42:43] light from the darkness when he gets
[42:46] ready to to use a group of people he has
[42:50] to separate the light from the darkness
[42:52] when he gets ready to use an individual
[42:54] he separates light from the darkness so
[42:57] you might wonder what's going on in your
[42:59] life and you might wonder what why it
[43:01] just seems like things maybe are going
[43:02] haywire and why why your life seems so
[43:05] hectic maybe it's because God is
[43:07] separating the light from the dark
[43:08] Darkness as a child of God when God gets
[43:11] ready to use you if there's things that
[43:13] in your life that shouldn't be there if
[43:15] you're if you're paying attention to
[43:17] things and you're caught up with some
[43:18] boy or you're caught up with some girl
[43:19] or you're in some career or something
[43:21] that's that's not the will of God for
[43:23] your life you'll find out that the word
[43:25] is going to come forth and it's going to
[43:27] start to cause a separation in your life
[43:29] and at the first you might not be aware
[43:31] of what's going on but God is wanting to
[43:34] use you God is calling to you he's
[43:36] wanting to call you away from the
[43:38] darkness because you're not of the
[43:40] darkness you're of the light and so his
[43:42] word is coming to you look I want you to
[43:43] come out of there come away from those
[43:45] things you don't belong there that's not
[43:47] what you're a part of you aren't called
[43:48] to that but I've called you to something
[43:50] great or I've called you to something
[43:52] more and the scripture says he that half
[43:54] an ear let him hear what the spirit said
[43:56] to the churches praise God that God had
[43:58] given you something to be able to hear
[44:01] that word of God that is being spoken it
[44:03] might not be a be for you to be able to
[44:05] articulate that ate it that way you
[44:07] might not even know it is the word of
[44:08] God out that something is calling upon
[44:11] your life and it's moving you in a
[44:13] certain way it's moving you in a certain
[44:14] direction where maybe your friends and
[44:16] your colleagues they are comfortable
[44:18] doing the things that they do and they
[44:20] call themselves Christians and they go
[44:21] to this church over here and and they go
[44:23] to this over there and they're fine with
[44:25] their lives and you look at their life
[44:26] and say how can they call themselves a
[44:28] Christian but they go to the movie house
[44:29] and they dress the way they do and
[44:31] something in your heart is saying God
[44:33] there has to be a better way there has
[44:34] to be something more that is God working
[44:37] in your life because he's showing look
[44:38] there's something better there's another
[44:40] way and I'm going to separate you out
[44:42] from amongst those things and the word
[44:44] comes to you to separate you from the
[44:46] darkness
[44:48] he says light comes by God remember the
[44:51] light come by his spoken word the word
[44:54] of God said let there be light
[44:56] when there was no light and he sent the
[44:59] light to separate the darkness from the
[45:00] light
[45:03] this word of command cleared the sky
[45:06] so the sun could shine
[45:09] and his word today is what clears back
[45:12] all of the atmosphere of unbelief
[45:16] and his word today is what clears back
[45:19] all the atmosphere of unbelief well does
[45:23] anybody want the atmosphere of unbelief
[45:25] cleared back I say oh God I want the
[45:28] atmosphere of unbelief cleared away from
[45:31] my life well what is it going to come by
[45:33] it's going to come by the word of God
[45:35] not by what you think the word of God is
[45:38] Not By You interpreting the word of God
[45:40] but it's going to come by the
[45:41] unadulterated word of God and God has a
[45:44] provided way in the end time an end-time
[45:47] message that God has sent to clear away
[45:49] all of the unbelief and to separate you
[45:52] which is the light right he's the father
[45:54] of lights and ye are the light of the
[45:56] world so God has sent a word to separate
[45:59] you from the darkness so you can be the
[46:02] light of the world
[46:04] and his word today is what clears back
[46:07] all the atmospheres of unbelief you know
[46:10] as you think about the atmosphere as you
[46:12] think of unbelief and how brother
[46:13] Branham here he's speaking about how
[46:15] there was the sun it was shining but
[46:17] there was something that was in between
[46:19] the earth there was a fog or there was
[46:22] this Haze the world was in a chaotic
[46:24] time and there was something blocking
[46:25] the Sun from shining upon the Earth you
[46:28] know if you you tried to imagine maybe
[46:29] what that looked like I don't know maybe
[46:31] some of you have ever been on an
[46:32] airplane ride and
[46:34] you know you're coming into your final
[46:36] destination and maybe you're cruising at
[46:38] 30 000 35
[46:40] 000 feet man it's just well the sky is
[46:42] clear blue and the sun is shining like
[46:45] man it's gonna be a beautiful day
[46:48] and that Captain comes on and says
[46:50] please uh fasten your seat belts uh
[46:52] flight attendants prepare to land and
[46:55] all of a sudden they start to lower
[46:56] their altitude and you start to come
[46:58] down and the further you come down all
[47:01] of a sudden you start to ascend and all
[47:02] sudden there's you're coming into the
[47:04] clouds and you're like okay maybe it's
[47:06] not a clear blue sky like I thought it
[47:08] was and you start to lower down in just
[47:11] in just a few seconds time all of a
[47:13] sudden you're down and all of a sudden
[47:15] it's dark and it's gloomy and it's
[47:19] raining and you get lower down and you
[47:20] start to think what just happened
[47:23] I I thought I was cruising in for a a
[47:26] great vacation with sunshine and and no
[47:29] clouds in the air but just in a moment
[47:31] your Vantage Point and what you
[47:32] perceived there where the Sun was
[47:34] shining in all of its Glory there was a
[47:36] clear blue sky but as you descended
[47:39] through the clouds all of a sudden as
[47:41] you come down for landing there is
[47:43] something that is blocking the sun it's
[47:46] no longer shining and you come into an
[47:48] atmosphere or into a condition where
[47:49] it's cold and it's raining and the sun
[47:52] isn't shining you get down and you're
[47:54] like my
[47:55] whatever happened to the sunshine
[47:58] but I just want to say that if if you
[48:00] could ever get back and mount up with
[48:02] wings like an eagle if you could say if
[48:04] you could ever get back in the airplane
[48:06] I want to say that the sun is still up
[48:08] there it's still shining in all of its
[48:12] Glory but there's just something that
[48:14] has gotten in the way of the sunshine
[48:16] there's something that has gotten
[48:18] between you and the sun it doesn't mean
[48:20] that the sun's gone it doesn't mean
[48:22] God's gone it doesn't mean that God
[48:23] doesn't love you but you've come into a
[48:25] situation you've come into an atmosphere
[48:28] something has taken place that's gotten
[48:30] in the way and it's caused a storm in
[48:32] your life and if you could ever just
[48:33] break through those clouds if you could
[48:36] just ever break back through that
[48:38] atmosphere you'll find the sun is
[48:39] shining just the same as it always has
[48:43] and maybe that's what I want to speak to
[48:45] you a little bit tonight on is breaking
[48:47] through and into
[48:50] breaking through and into you know it's
[48:53] one thing to break through
[48:55] it's one thing to break out but you want
[48:57] to have a reason why you're doing it or
[48:59] once you've accomplished it there needs
[49:01] to be a next step or a next phase to
[49:03] what you're doing
[49:05] you know a breakthrough is an instance
[49:08] of passing through a barrier
[49:10] it's an act of moving through or Beyond
[49:14] an obstacle
[49:15] so just in speaking to you a little bit
[49:17] about breaking through and then two it's
[49:19] an instance of passing through a barrier
[49:22] this is the definition by Webster
[49:25] an instance of passing through a barrier
[49:28] an act of moving through or Beyond an
[49:31] obstacle
[49:32] now as I was just thinking about this it
[49:34] reminded me of we had a little gathering
[49:36] at our house over the weekend
[49:39] and uh something we we do for the The
[49:41] Homeschool families and the homeschool
[49:43] uh moms and the kids and and my wife
[49:46] worked really hard on putting together
[49:48] what they call an escape room
[49:50] how many people in here have ever done
[49:52] an escape room
[49:54] well I'm missing some hands that should
[49:56] be up how many have you ever done an
[49:57] escape room
[49:58] yeah a few people have done it they've
[50:00] they're it's called an escape room where
[50:02] where they they have a like a story line
[50:05] and and your objection is your objective
[50:08] is as you go into this room or this
[50:10] building and there's going to be a theme
[50:12] or a story for you and and you and you
[50:15] go in there and they're going to give
[50:16] you uh uh you're gonna have to get out
[50:18] of this room and there's you got to find
[50:20] Clues and you got to find uh the answers
[50:22] to these these Clues and these questions
[50:24] and those answers will give you how to
[50:27] unlock the the lock on the box and you
[50:29] unlock the box and then you look in
[50:31] there and you find it's another clue and
[50:32] it points you to go over uh to this side
[50:35] of the room and and you're looking over
[50:37] here and the whole goal of of the escape
[50:40] room is you're trying to find all of the
[50:43] clues and you're trying to find all of
[50:45] the things to escape out of the room but
[50:47] but I want to tell you that that when
[50:50] you go into this there has to be some
[50:52] type of intelligence to help you get out
[50:54] of the escape room
[50:56] if there isn't an intelligence there to
[50:58] give you Clues if there isn't something
[51:00] there to guide you in a certain
[51:02] direction then you would sit there and
[51:04] wonder what am I supposed to do next I
[51:06] tell you good thing it's a group effort
[51:08] because I would never make it out
[51:10] you know but but but but but I want to
[51:13] say man you're not on your own this is a
[51:14] group effort
[51:16] you know if you can't solve the problem
[51:18] or I tell you God gots the problem
[51:19] solved
[51:21] and God will use your brothers and
[51:23] sisters if you're in a time of need and
[51:24] you've got a situation that you feel
[51:26] like you can't get out and you've gotten
[51:28] on your knees and you've prayed and you
[51:30] just don't know what to do why don't you
[51:31] go and call on some of your brothers and
[51:33] sisters and say you know what I'm in a
[51:35] situation I feel like I can't get out I
[51:37] want to tell you there's power in prayer
[51:39] and there's power in the body of Christ
[51:41] that if you'll come together with your
[51:43] brothers and sisters and you'll start to
[51:45] pray and you'll come in a Unity of faith
[51:47] and say you know what this might be a
[51:48] problem but my God's bigger than the
[51:50] problem my God can solve this problem
[51:52] and you find you rally yourself together
[51:55] and you start to call on God and watch
[51:57] the power of God come down in the room
[51:58] and you'll break you out of that
[52:00] situation oh I want to tell you he's the
[52:02] same yesterday today and forever the
[52:05] Saints what were they doing they were
[52:06] praying for Peter one day
[52:08] he was locked up and he was Shackled up
[52:11] and they were praying praying for him
[52:13] praying for him and also what happened
[52:14] their prayers were answered and also
[52:16] there's a
[52:18] they were so amazed that God answered
[52:20] their prayer they thought it was a ghost
[52:21] at the door but he's the same God today
[52:24] I don't care what you're going through
[52:25] if it's healing you need God's here to
[52:28] heal you if there's the baptism of the
[52:30] Holy Ghost he's here to heal you
[52:33] but you would never be able to escape
[52:35] out of that room unless there was an
[52:37] intelligence that's there dropping Clues
[52:39] to you
[52:41] if there was somebody there yeah here
[52:43] you got a problem in front of you but
[52:45] then there's like a riddle it says
[52:47] you'll never be left behind but look up
[52:51] the answer is always right don't look
[52:53] down
[52:54] but just look up and all of a sudden you
[52:56] realize what is that talking about and
[52:58] then you realize it's a directional lock
[53:00] okay
[53:01] that's what it's saying if I'm baptized
[53:04] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:08] if I Repent of my sins right it's a clue
[53:11] it's a hit hey if you want to get out of
[53:14] the condition you're I'm dropping a clue
[53:16] and it hits along the way that if you'll
[53:18] just follow the intelligence that's in
[53:20] the room
[53:22] oh it reminds me of that time that
[53:24] brother Brandon was with brother woods
[53:25] and and they were wanting to go hunting
[53:27] and he said oh he told brother Ben well
[53:29] you know the guy's an Infidel but but he
[53:31] got so tired he gots a lot of land out
[53:32] there and we'll go on down there and

[54:02] that you've got to carry around a
[54:03] preacher with you anymore

[55:24] there wasn't a boast there wasn't this
[55:26] approach yeah yeah yeah yeah oh is that
[55:28] right

[55:39] to eat the apples and goes you know I
[55:41] want to ask you a question
[55:43] the apples have started falling off the
[55:45] tree
[55:46] you know and we haven't even had a cool
[55:48] spell
[55:49] why is that he said oh you know the only
[55:51] Infidel said well I will you know if if
[55:54] if if if the sap you know the life of
[55:56] the tree doesn't go it's gone down in
[55:58] The Roots if it stays in the trail die

[56:11] the fence post
[56:12] it ain't gonna run down the fence post
[56:13] and come back up in the springtime
[56:17] and he started to point the old Infidel
[56:19] to an intelligence and he started to say
[56:22] look there's an intelligence
[56:25] Hallelujah there's an intelligence that
[56:28] tells the life
[56:29] that's in the apple tree when to go down
[56:33] into the roots and you start running
[56:35] that intelligence through nature what
[56:37] tells that old duck that's out there on
[56:39] that pond in the North Country just out
[56:42] of nowhere all of a sudden one specific
[56:43] duck all of a sudden he rises up and he
[56:46] starts to to go around in a circle and
[56:49] he starts to call to the rest of the
[56:51] duck and say it's time to head south for
[56:54] the winter there's an intelligence that
[56:57] is telling that duck what to do the
[56:59] salmon they have spawning grounds and
[57:02] then they go out for years and then
[57:03] there's an intelligence that tells that
[57:05] salmon that has never been where it's
[57:07] going
[57:09] could you imagine navigating the the
[57:11] lakes and the rivers and going Upstream
[57:15] through all of the effort and all the
[57:17] time and it has to go right back to the
[57:19] place that it was born because there's
[57:21] an intelligence telling that salmon
[57:23] you're gonna go back to the same place
[57:25] that you were birthed
[57:28] and the prophet could stand there and
[57:29] say I want to tell you something
[57:32] you said you want to ask that preacher a
[57:34] question how that he knew about that
[57:37] woman's life the same intelligence that
[57:40] tells that the life and that apple tree
[57:42] to go down in The Roots is the same
[57:44] intelligence that told me to go lay a
[57:46] handkerchief on that woman and she would
[57:49] be healed he said you're that preacher
[57:52] he said yes I'm that preacher and he led
[57:55] that old Infidel right there under that
[57:57] apple tree to the Lord I want to tell
[57:59] you that's the same intelligence that's
[58:01] brought you to the house of God tonight
[58:03] on a Wednesday night it's the same
[58:06] intelligence that's been dropping you
[58:08] Clues your whole life and in your
[58:10] problems and your situations you thought
[58:12] there was no way out but God he was the
[58:15] intelligence looking out over your life

[58:18] there he's the one that stopped you from
[58:20] being killed he's the one that stopped
[58:22] you from being imprisoned your whole
[58:23] life he's the one that stopped you from
[58:25] oding on drugs he's the one that brought
[58:27] you out of the prison house why because
[58:29] he's the intelligence that's been

[58:46] free I want to say Lord God why did you
[58:48] set me free I don't just want to be
[58:51] Sanctified I want to be filled with the
[58:53] Holy Ghost and if I've been filled with
[58:55] the Holy Ghost Lord what do you want me
[58:57] to do with the Holy Ghost
[59:00] yeah the devil's here he wants to
[59:02] challenge you and
[59:05] he wants to try to tell you there's
[59:06] nothing to the message and there's
[59:08] nothing to the word of God
[59:10] well since we're on the subject of
[59:12] infidel I like this other one
[59:14] you know this old Infidel he was
[59:16] challenging the Church of God
[59:18] he was saying well you say God's A
[59:20] Healer
[59:22] you say God's word is true I challenge
[59:24] any of you to come up here
[59:26] and drink this boric acid
[59:29] the Bible says if you drink any deadly
[59:31] thing it will not harm you
[59:34] so who of you will come up
[59:37] and drink this boric acid
[59:41] well they said well the Bible says you
[59:43] shouldn't tempt the Lord thy God the old
[59:45] Infidel would sit there and say okay
[59:47] yeah I guess I shouldn't tempt and ask
[59:48] him for anything then and just kind of
[59:50] was making fun of them Christians and
[59:52] this this all uh uh uh uh oh hit boy
[59:55] just from the back there he had cover
[59:57] overalls on and his hair all in his face
[1:00:00] and it was kind of long and shagging
[1:00:01] down his neck and he walked up there to
[1:00:03] the front in his little overalls and
[1:00:06] that only if it says what do you want
[1:00:09] he reached in his pocket and he pulled
[1:00:12] out an apple
[1:00:13] pulled out a knife and he started to
[1:00:15] carve the Apple
[1:00:17] he said I said old sap what do you want
[1:00:20] he said well
[1:00:22] I want to ask you a question he goes
[1:00:24] well hurry up
[1:00:25] he said hold on I got time
[1:00:28] he was carving that good old Apple and
[1:00:30] he got it all down and poured out
[1:00:32] and he popped that old Apple into his
[1:00:35] mouth
[1:00:35] is chewing on and he said well I got a
[1:00:37] question for you he goes well hurry it
[1:00:39] up he goes is this apple
[1:00:41] sweet or sour
[1:00:43] is that lying got a clue I'm not the one
[1:00:46] eating it
[1:00:47] and he said that's what I thought and he
[1:00:49] turned around and went and sat down I
[1:00:51] don't care other people can tell you
[1:00:53] that God's not real but they're not the
[1:00:54] ones eating it I've tasted and I see
[1:00:57] that the Lord is good my sins have been
[1:00:59] forgiven I've been washed in the blood
[1:01:01] of the Lamb I've been filled with the
[1:01:03] Holy Ghost you come way too late to tell
[1:01:05] me that my God is not real so are you
[1:01:07] going to let the devil try to rob you
[1:01:09] from the promises of God why are you
[1:01:11] going to let them tell you that you're
[1:01:12] going to come short of the message of
[1:01:14] the hour why are you just going to come
[1:01:15] up so far and then settle for that and
[1:01:17] say I'm not good enough no God has
[1:01:19] there's been an intelligence that has
[1:01:21] been guiding you your whole life to
[1:01:23] bring you into the revealed word of the
[1:01:25] hour not to just break you out of
[1:01:27] denominational unbelief not to just
[1:01:29] break you out of sin but to break you
[1:01:31] into the very intelligence and the mind
[1:01:34] of God to bring you into the fullness of
[1:01:36] the stature of a perfect man that you
[1:01:38] might come in a union with a Capstone
[1:01:40] that is descended in the end times
[1:01:42] saying Christ Grace Grace
[1:01:45] I'm talking about breaking out and in
[1:01:47] two breaking breaking through and in two
[1:01:54] look we know we're living in in one of
[1:01:56] the worst ages that man has ever known
[1:02:00] you know it's Timothy he would write
[1:02:02] about it and say in the last days there
[1:02:03] will be perilous times man will be
[1:02:05] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:02:07] God do you see it
[1:02:09] children will be disobedient to pass
[1:02:12] they'll be a truce Breakers despising
[1:02:15] doers of good
[1:02:17] they're they're they're they're lovers
[1:02:19] of evil
[1:02:20] it's it's a world that of wickedness but
[1:02:23] then God what has he done he sent a word
[1:02:26] there had to be something that would
[1:02:28] come and separate the light from the
[1:02:31] darkness and if you are the light of the
[1:02:33] world then God has sent something to
[1:02:35] separate you away from the darkness
[1:02:38] just like the scripture would read there
[1:02:40] in Isaiah would say for behold Darkness
[1:02:42] shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness
[1:02:44] to people
[1:02:45] but the Lord shall arise upon thee in
[1:02:48] his glory shall be seen upon you look we
[1:02:50] know the world is one of the most
[1:02:52] chaotic times it's ever seen
[1:02:54] and we can mention these things every
[1:02:56] every service and no doubt it just seems
[1:02:59] as the world keeps getting worse and
[1:03:01] worse but we know that we're not not
[1:03:03] only are we living in one of the most
[1:03:04] chaotic times of Darkness we're standing
[1:03:06] in the Most Blessed light that we ever
[1:03:08] did Shine
[1:03:17] sure we can see the weakness wickedness
[1:03:19] all around us
[1:03:21] it doesn't take you long to realize that
[1:03:23] mankind has sunk into a loathe that has
[1:03:25] never been seen before
[1:03:27] and they've been given over to a
[1:03:28] reprobate mind they've believed a strong
[1:03:30] delusion and now a common sense has
[1:03:33] escaped them to where you know maybe
[1:03:35] it's not good to say this over the
[1:03:37] pulpit but you know I've been I heard I
[1:03:39] heard a statement said you know it's
[1:03:41] impossible to to to it says it's hard to
[1:03:44] win an argument with a smart person
[1:03:47] but it well I'll substitute a word a bit
[1:03:50] but it's impossible to to win an
[1:03:51] argument with somebody that's ignorant
[1:03:54] they have no ability to reason
[1:03:56] you can tell somebody facts but they're
[1:03:58] so in such a strong delusion to politics
[1:04:01] and the things of the world that they
[1:04:03] deny basic biology they deny two plus
[1:04:06] two equals four and so you realize that
[1:04:08] this is the product of the age that
[1:04:10] we're living in but while we're living
[1:04:12] in a time that's so chaotic we're living
[1:04:14] in a time where the most blessed life
[1:04:16] ever did Shine remember his word is what
[1:04:19] clears back all the atmospheres of
[1:04:21] unbelief so we're talking about breaking
[1:04:23] through the unbelief breaking through
[1:04:26] the sin that so easily besets us
[1:04:30] that we can break through into every
[1:04:32] single promise that God has for you
[1:04:35] I don't know about you but I believe we
[1:04:37] are living below our privileges as a
[1:04:40] believer that there has been a
[1:04:42] storehouse that has been opened up to us
[1:04:44] there's Promises of God that's been made
[1:04:46] available to us and if we don't allow
[1:04:49] the message of the hour to separate the
[1:04:52] darkness oh yes brothers and sisters we
[1:04:55] still need the message of the hour to
[1:04:58] separate the darkness and unbelief out
[1:05:01] of our lives this has to be a daily
[1:05:03] feeding this has to be a daily washing
[1:05:06] and it comes by the water of the word it
[1:05:10] comes by the word that God has given us
[1:05:12] in the age that we're living in not an
[1:05:15] age gone by not a message gone by but
[1:05:18] God has sent a Vindicated word by a
[1:05:21] Vindicated prophet and it's by that word
[1:05:24] that the darkness is separated out of
[1:05:26] your life and if you don't stay under
[1:05:28] the messenger for the age then that
[1:05:30] Darkness will enter back into your life
[1:05:33] or don't tell me I'm crazy if you don't
[1:05:36] stay under the gods provided way of the
[1:05:39] hour and if you get so puffed up and you
[1:05:41] think you got it all figured and that's
[1:05:42] what's happened to men they've got a
[1:05:44] hold of the message and they've ran it
[1:05:46] and tried to tie all these quotes
[1:05:47] together and say this is what the
[1:05:49] prophet said this here and they've run
[1:05:51] out of the lamb and before they knew it
[1:05:53] the devil cut that limb off and they
[1:05:55] found themselves attached away away from
[1:05:57] the message and now they're not even
[1:05:58] Christians denying the very power of God
[1:06:02] Pat don't get Me puffed up that says oh
[1:06:05] God never take your hand off my life
[1:06:07] Lord let me stay true to you if I'm
[1:06:10] going to be the final voice to the final
[1:06:12] age let me stay right under the message
[1:06:13] of the hour Lord let me be taught let me
[1:06:16] be trained let me be tutored Lord let me
[1:06:18] stay with your provided way of the age
[1:06:22] because it's by that way we get out of
[1:06:24] here
[1:06:27] we have promises whosoever that in Mark
[1:06:31] 11 23 that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:06:33] mountain
[1:06:35] I'm talking about breaking through and
[1:06:37] into
[1:06:39] God has more for you
[1:06:42] that whosoever shall say to unto this
[1:06:44] mouth and be thou removed
[1:06:47] and be cast into the sea and shall not
[1:06:50] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:06:51] that those things which he saith shall
[1:06:54] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:06:57] saith
[1:06:58] if you say to this mountain
[1:07:03] what did the prophet of God said he said
[1:07:04] if you say to this off to this mountain
[1:07:07] he said I often wondered about that but
[1:07:09] if if you say he said that puts you back
[1:07:11] in the word
[1:07:13] this is something not to Pawn off to
[1:07:15] your neighbor this isn't something to
[1:07:16] Pawn off on the Prophet this isn't
[1:07:18] something to Pawn off on the days gone
[1:07:20] by but this is something for the
[1:07:22] believer to know that God has sent a
[1:07:24] word to break you out of a
[1:07:27] denominational way of thinking to break
[1:07:28] you out of the intelligence of a man to
[1:07:31] bring you into a place and a position to
[1:07:34] where under the word of the hour you can
[1:07:36] come into the promises of God where you
[1:07:39] can take that word and speak that word
[1:07:42] and watch it materialize before you
[1:07:45] I'm not talking about fanaticism I'm
[1:07:48] talking about the word of God that has
[1:07:50] been delivered to the Believers in the
[1:07:52] age that we're living in
[1:07:54] now I'm just foolish enough to believe
[1:07:56] what I've heard the prophet say is for
[1:07:58] me
[1:08:02] now remember what a forerunner is
[1:08:06] we spoke a little bit about what a
[1:08:07] forerunner is it's one who comes in
[1:08:09] advance
[1:08:10] to a place the rest are to follow
[1:08:15] so just like the sheath wave
[1:08:17] remember what the waving of the sheath
[1:08:19] was it was the first fruits of what was
[1:08:22] to come
[1:08:23] the waving of the Sheaf was taking the
[1:08:26] first fruit
[1:08:29] and it was way before the priest to say
[1:08:32] look this is what the rest of the seed
[1:08:36] in the field are going to be it was an
[1:08:40] Evidence it was a fruit to show what the
[1:08:44] word was going to produce and now here's
[1:08:46] a fullness of that word in the day that
[1:08:50] we're living in taking the promises of
[1:08:53] God and speaking squirrels into
[1:08:55] existence speaking to the storm taking
[1:08:58] the promised word if you say to this
[1:09:01] mountain and you believe and shall not
[1:09:04] doubt you shall have what you asked for
[1:09:06] and then what does God do he takes a
[1:09:09] forerunner he takes a first fruit to
[1:09:12] come to maturity and takes the very Word
[1:09:15] of Promise and brings it into
[1:09:16] manifestation so the rest of the wheat
[1:09:19] field can look and say that's what I'm
[1:09:22] going to be
[1:09:23] and you will not stop short of it
[1:09:26] because you are that seed word that God
[1:09:29] has planted in the field and nothing can
[1:09:32] stop you from coming to maturity
[1:09:35] nothing can stop you from coming to the
[1:09:38] maturity of the power that God placed
[1:09:41] inside the seed the only thing we need
[1:09:44] to do is lay in the presence of the Sun
[1:09:48] but I think that's the problem is some
[1:09:50] of us are not laying in the presence of
[1:09:52] the Sun
[1:09:53] we're laying in the presence of this
[1:09:55] ministry over here we're laying in the
[1:09:57] presence of this ministry over there
[1:09:58] we're looking for some Revival we're
[1:10:01] looking for something out there when God
[1:10:03] has given you the very thing to change
[1:10:05] your body
[1:10:07] and that is the message of the hour
[1:10:10] preached through the ministry of William
[1:10:11] Branham
[1:10:14] you can stand up here you can debate it
[1:10:17] you can tell me I'm in heretic but
[1:10:19] you're not the one eating the Apple
[1:10:24] I'm the one eating this Apple so don't
[1:10:26] tell me how it tastes because it tastes
[1:10:28] real good
[1:10:30] this message tastes better than anything
[1:10:33] I've ever come in contact with you want
[1:10:35] to give me some Baptist ideas some
[1:10:38] Methodist ideas give me some
[1:10:39] Pentecostalism so I can run around and
[1:10:42] shout and jump up and down and holler
[1:10:44] with no substance give me the revealed
[1:10:46] word of the hour introduce me to Jesus
[1:10:49] Christ then I'll run then I shall then
[1:10:52] I'll dance because I've been United with
[1:10:55] the bridegroom
[1:10:56] oh Hallelujah taste and see that the
[1:11:00] Lord is good
[1:11:01] Hallelujah
[1:11:03] glory to God
[1:11:05] we've seen one come into maturity
[1:11:08] that should excite you Church
[1:11:11] that's not a challenge it's a testimony
[1:11:14] of what you are
[1:11:19] it ain't for you to look up and say
[1:11:21] when we look at our heavenly father and
[1:11:24] say
[1:11:24] I can never be that
[1:11:26] he's looking back and saying no you're
[1:11:28] my son
[1:11:29] you're my daughter and all I am you are
[1:11:34] you are my very seed Gene word that I've
[1:11:38] planted and laid us here and I've given
[1:11:40] you everything that you have need of to
[1:11:42] come into the potentials that I placed
[1:11:44] inside of you
[1:11:46] or if that don't make you want to shout
[1:11:48] this apple tastes really good
[1:11:50] I think I want to take another bite of
[1:11:52] it
[1:11:54] don't tell me this message ain't good
[1:11:57] don't tell me this message ain't for me
[1:11:59] it changed my life
[1:12:01] what are you talking about brother
[1:12:03] Matthew you were born in the message no
[1:12:05] no look I wasn't born in the message
[1:12:07] there's only one way you can be bored in
[1:12:09] the message and that joy that we ain't
[1:12:11] like Nicodemus oh you know do I got to
[1:12:13] enter back into no sir there's only one
[1:12:15] way you can be born into the message is
[1:12:17] you got to be born again by the Holy
[1:12:20] Ghost you can't just say I'll I believe
[1:12:22] God's in a prophet that won't do you no
[1:12:24] good the Devils believe God that's in a
[1:12:27] prophet
[1:12:28] why because they met him on a number of
[1:12:30] occasions and they had to do what the
[1:12:31] man said
[1:12:35] but that's a testimony of what God is
[1:12:38] showing you that you're coming in to be
[1:12:41] don't tell me this message ain't really
[1:12:43] it's done too much for me it took me out
[1:12:45] of drugs it took me out of alcohol oh
[1:12:47] brother Matthew that was just a prayer
[1:12:49] of your parents well praise God there's
[1:12:51] a promise to our parents
[1:12:53] that's for sure I'll give them all the
[1:12:55] credit in the world I'm here
[1:12:58] you want to talk to a drug addict or
[1:13:00] talk to somebody that's broken through
[1:13:01] and come out of something you want to
[1:13:02] talk about somebody who's won the
[1:13:03] lottery are they going to be like oh you
[1:13:05] know
[1:13:06] my neighbor bought me the lottery ticket
[1:13:09] bummer
[1:13:11] look I'm just thankful that God chose me
[1:13:14] I'm thankful that God elected me I'm
[1:13:17] thankful God gave me believe in Paris
[1:13:18] I'm thankful he put me in the house of
[1:13:20] God with believing brothers and says I'm
[1:13:22] thankful for what the message of the
[1:13:24] hour has produced because it's life to
[1:13:26] me it's keeping me it's leading me it's
[1:13:29] guy to me and when I fall down oh thank
[1:13:32] God it picks me back up
[1:13:34] if you ever feel like you're down and
[1:13:36] out why don't you just turn on a tape
[1:13:38] why don't you just open up your Bible
[1:13:40] why don't you just get on your knees and
[1:13:41] pray because the devil wants to keep you
[1:13:43] away from the very thing that's ordained
[1:13:45] to pick you back up and put you into the
[1:13:47] position that you're called to be
[1:13:55] we have seen a star and have come to
[1:13:56] worship Him
[1:14:00] would you deny what Jesus said himself
[1:14:03] what the Bible itself speaks out
[1:14:06] which is Christ
[1:14:08] the anointed word
[1:14:10] question mark
[1:14:14] would you deny what Jesus said himself
[1:14:16] with the Bible itself speaks out which
[1:14:18] is Christ the anointed word
[1:14:20] and if the word abides in you
[1:14:24] then your
[1:14:25] the anointed person with the word
[1:14:29] he abide in me and my words in you then
[1:14:32] ask what you will
[1:14:34] it'll be done for you
[1:14:36] that's Christ in you
[1:14:39] anointing the word for this age
[1:14:43] whatever age they lived in God divided
[1:14:47] his word to ages
[1:14:50] and every time it come to that time the
[1:14:54] churches are all scrupled up and God
[1:14:56] anoints somebody
[1:14:58] sends it down and makes that word act
[1:15:01] just exactly the way he said it did that
[1:15:05] was a forerunner a sheath wave exactly
[1:15:08] and there's a word prophesied for this
[1:15:11] day God is waiting to find somebody it's
[1:15:14] not too unusual to that they can be
[1:15:16] Anointed with the Holy Ghost to prove
[1:15:18] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:15:20] today and forever to be a Shining Light
[1:15:22] to Blind the eyes of the unbeliever
[1:15:26] then you're the anointed person with the
[1:15:29] word
[1:15:31] I say unto you
[1:15:33] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:15:35] do shall he do also and Greater Works
[1:15:37] than these how he do because I go into
[1:15:39] the father
[1:15:40] that word is alive in a people I'm
[1:15:44] looking at a people that that promised
[1:15:46] word is alive and living in you because
[1:15:49] you are the anointed person of the word
[1:15:53] look this is your calling
[1:15:56] you are predestinated to it
[1:16:00] this ain't a time to back up
[1:16:02] this ain't a time to doubt you've heard
[1:16:05] the word that's been coming over the
[1:16:06] pulpit the pastor laboring on the two
[1:16:08] books and saying look that old life that
[1:16:11] was the The Book of Life that was a
[1:16:13] record of all your deeds and the things
[1:16:14] that you've done wrong you are now by
[1:16:16] the blood of Jesus Christ you have now
[1:16:19] been forgiven and you're Justified your
[1:16:21] name has been written on the Lamb's Book
[1:16:23] of Life you never did that in the first
[1:16:25] place
[1:16:26] you received an end-time message see why
[1:16:29] because how could you ever be able to
[1:16:33] come into the fullness of what God has
[1:16:35] promised for this age with your past
[1:16:37] hanging on your back you would never
[1:16:39] feel you had a chance or a capability
[1:16:42] but you see you got this mind up here
[1:16:44] that always wants to remind you of where
[1:16:46] you came from but you see God has no
[1:16:49] record of your sin here on Earth he has
[1:16:51] record where you were before the
[1:16:53] foundation of the world and that is his
[1:16:55] record to the church is he says I am the
[1:16:58] lamb that was slain before the
[1:17:00] foundation of the world and I put your
[1:17:02] name in the Lamb's Book of Life that is
[1:17:04] the record concerning you
[1:17:07] and you are predestinated
[1:17:10] to fulfill the message of the hour
[1:17:12] you're the chosen one you're the wheat
[1:17:14] field you're the one that got placed
[1:17:16] here to do it
[1:17:18] Oh Glory to God
[1:17:21] I'm so thankful that he chose me and he
[1:17:24] elected me and he called me he called my
[1:17:28] name what was it there was an
[1:17:30] intelligence over your life
[1:17:33] there was an intelligence keeping you
[1:17:35] you thought you were off somewhere there
[1:17:37] in Africa back in the bush never to be
[1:17:40] found but God was looking for you there
[1:17:42] was an intelligence over your life
[1:17:45] Hallelujah
[1:17:47] and if the word abides in you
[1:17:50] glory to God
[1:17:52] why can you not sin
[1:17:54] because the seed of God remaineth in you
[1:17:59] blessed is the man whom the Lord will
[1:18:02] not impute sin Oh Glory to God you're
[1:18:06] blessed tonight you're blessed tonight
[1:18:08] the seed of God remains in you you
[1:18:10] cannot sin why because you're
[1:18:12] predestinated
[1:18:14] hallelujah oh brother Matthew you're
[1:18:17] getting off the word the word says yeah
[1:18:19] the word says I'm so glad I don't have
[1:18:21] to reason about it I'm just going to
[1:18:23] keep eating my Apple
[1:18:25] you can tell me it's sorry you can tell
[1:18:27] me it don't taste good you can keep
[1:18:28] challenging me I'm just going to keep
[1:18:30] enjoying it
[1:18:31] Hallelujah I'm going to keep listening
[1:18:34] I was fellowship with my brother the
[1:18:36] other day we were talking about some
[1:18:38] people they come around the message they
[1:18:40] feed on the message they know all about
[1:18:41] the prophet they they they they know
[1:18:44] things and then they try to bring up
[1:18:46] quote or this or that and I told my
[1:18:48] brother David look I said all my eggs
[1:18:50] are in this basket
[1:18:52] I'll go where this message takes me
[1:18:55] there ain't nothing out there that I
[1:18:57] want there ain't nothing out there the
[1:18:59] world got and if on the day of judgment
[1:19:01] I had to come down and say Lord
[1:19:04] I was trusting in the message of the
[1:19:06] hour to bring me safely through if
[1:19:09] that's going to be my hindrance if
[1:19:11] that's going to be the only fault that
[1:19:12] God has on me I'll take it
[1:19:15] because see that's not a fault it's a
[1:19:18] revelation
[1:19:19] that it's God's provided way in the end
[1:19:22] time just so much so just like the
[1:19:26] message that Noah brought there is only
[1:19:28] one way and it was to get on that boat
[1:19:30] and I don't want one foot in and one
[1:19:33] foot out I'm not a I'm not waiting to
[1:19:35] break out of this message oh just in
[1:19:37] case it doesn't work I want to go all
[1:19:39] the way in Noah show me the porch show
[1:19:42] me the depths show me the left side show
[1:19:44] me the bow take me up in the top note
[1:19:47] show me everything about this boat
[1:19:49] because I ain't getting off of this boat
[1:19:50] until the Lord tells me to and it's the
[1:19:53] same thing with this message God has put
[1:19:56] me on this boat and he's going to take
[1:19:58] me safely through until the body change
[1:20:00] and I ain't getting off
[1:20:02] you got to be sold out Church Lock Stock
[1:20:05] and Barrel but I think that's the
[1:20:06] problem some of us uh I'm not not in a
[1:20:09] not in a way to belittle but if I can
[1:20:11] say like this God give us a greater
[1:20:13] revelation of what this message is
[1:20:17] give us a greater revelation of what the
[1:20:19] son of man Ministry is
[1:20:23] I had a pastor tell me he wouldn't have
[1:20:25] made a mistake
[1:20:26] a pastor I have confidence in it
[1:20:29] wonderful man of God
[1:20:31] and I I believe God allows you to have
[1:20:34] experiences to really help train you and
[1:20:36] tutor you he said I would have never
[1:20:38] done it if I'd have really known who
[1:20:41] William Branham was
[1:20:43] and it stuck with me
[1:20:45] because I thought how
[1:20:49] all I could say is Lord
[1:20:52] reveal more to me
[1:20:55] reveal more to me I never want to come
[1:20:57] to the place where I got it figured out
[1:20:58] because when we do that we're in trouble
[1:21:01] but you are the anointed word that God
[1:21:03] has placed here we're breaking through
[1:21:06] and into the fullness of what God has
[1:21:08] promised to you in this age
[1:21:10] so we move a little further the prophet
[1:21:12] of God would say this and looking at the
[1:21:13] Unseen he says and they say that the
[1:21:15] plane struggles and shakes so we're
[1:21:17] we're trying to preach a little bit
[1:21:18] about breaking through and in two so we
[1:21:21] got to come to a place where we're
[1:21:22] breaking through something
[1:21:25] some of us were breaking through
[1:21:26] different things
[1:21:27] we're breaking through different
[1:21:28] struggles
[1:21:30] we're we're in different seasons in our
[1:21:32] life
[1:21:33] and they say that the plane struggles
[1:21:35] and Shakes and struggles and shakes
[1:21:36] while it's trying to get through that
[1:21:38] sound barrier until it seemed like the
[1:21:40] wings will tear off of it and the bolts
[1:21:42] will rip out of while it's going through
[1:21:43] that sound barrier
[1:21:45] but when once it gets beyond the sound
[1:21:47] barrier
[1:21:49] the sound barrier then its speed is
[1:21:51] unlimited it can just fly free and the
[1:21:54] church and you sitting here tonight oh
[1:21:56] you're struggling and struggling
[1:21:59] and God's pulling to you and showing you
[1:22:02] things if you can ever get past that sin
[1:22:07] barrier of unbelief
[1:22:09] then unlimited Revival will break out
[1:22:12] through the United States and everywhere
[1:22:13] if you can go beyond that sound barrier
[1:22:16] that sin barrier of unbelief oh is it
[1:22:19] true does it mean me could I be healed
[1:22:22] could I be saved could I be filled with
[1:22:24] the Holy Ghost get beyond that just keep
[1:22:28] struggling
[1:22:29] the struggle's okay
[1:22:32] as some would say the struggle's real
[1:22:38] you're struggling that's okay
[1:22:40] struggling struggling until you break
[1:22:42] through and the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:22:44] you I'm telling you you're beyond it
[1:22:47] then and there's 50 miles of Elbow Room
[1:22:50] Oh Glory to God I want to say It's Time
[1:22:53] church that we break through you break
[1:22:55] through your complexes you break through
[1:22:57] your fears you break through your
[1:22:59] disappointments look God didn't save you
[1:23:02] to lose you
[1:23:04] he didn't bring you out to leave you out
[1:23:07] he didn't bring you out of all of that
[1:23:09] nonsense just to leave you sitting there
[1:23:11] you say preacher what are you talking
[1:23:12] about 15 miles of elbow you know I was
[1:23:15] thinking about that a little bit of what
[1:23:16] is 50 miles an hour you know I was
[1:23:18] thinking about the woman at the whale
[1:23:20] which she came in contact with the son
[1:23:22] of man and at first he looked and she
[1:23:25] saw a Jew but then when her heart was
[1:23:27] discerned Wendy when the Discerning of
[1:23:30] the thoughts of the tits of the heart
[1:23:31] came and then that seed was quickened it
[1:23:34] was and it was germinated she realized
[1:23:36] she was standing in the presence of the
[1:23:38] Messiah and I want to tell you she had
[1:23:41] 15 miles of Elbow Room her past didn't
[1:23:44] matter anymore her complexes didn't
[1:23:46] matter anymore her five husbands didn't
[1:23:49] matter anymore the man she was with
[1:23:51] didn't matter anymore all the people in
[1:23:53] the town didn't matter anymore she just
[1:23:55] went back said come see a man who's told
[1:23:57] me all the things that I've done I got

[1:24:13] the burden of sin has been lifted off of
[1:24:15] you and you've been changed and you've
[1:24:17] been filled with the Holy Ghost and you
[1:24:18] become a new creature and Jesus Christ

[1:24:45] what it is
[1:24:46] not to have one guilty feeling
[1:24:49] not to wonder where you're going when
[1:24:52] you die not afraid of the past not
[1:24:55] afraid of what tomorrow holds in store
[1:24:57] and know the reason why
[1:25:00] well that's just how it is
[1:25:02] when you go down in the water oh praise
[1:25:04] God you got 15 miles of Elbow Room
[1:25:08] to tell that Old Devil to shut up
[1:25:11] I know what I'm talking about it's a
[1:25:13] good apple

[1:25:27] what's holding you back
[1:25:29] our Tech said he's here to open the
[1:25:31] blind eyes to bring you out the
[1:25:33] prisoners out of the prison
[1:25:35] and them that sit in darkness
[1:25:37] out of the prison house
[1:25:41] I want to say if you've ever been
[1:25:42] brought out of the prison house
[1:25:46] I want to tell you
[1:25:49] it feels good
[1:25:52] to come out behind them bars

[1:25:56] you're talking about let me just tell
[1:25:57] you
[1:25:58] it feels good
[1:26:01] to come out from being incarcerated
[1:26:04] because what's behind those bars
[1:26:08] is not a soft pillow
[1:26:11] it's not a soft mattress
[1:26:14] a bunch of stuff that you don't want to
[1:26:16] be a part of
[1:26:18] but when it comes your time and you
[1:26:19] finally come out on the other side
[1:26:22] you just don't come outside of those
[1:26:24] bars you know you you get out and you
[1:26:26] get on the on the outside you say

[1:27:00] The Prodigal son's returning
[1:27:03] see when you've come out
[1:27:05] he didn't bring you out just so you
[1:27:07] could be on the outside

[1:27:10] come on home son
[1:27:12] come on home Dad I got a home-cooked
[1:27:13] meal for you

[1:27:29] bringing you into something else
[1:27:33] I want to tell you if you want more of
[1:27:35] God there's more of God for you
[1:27:38] I like this quote we've used it a few
[1:27:40] times as we work towards the clothes and
[1:27:42] greater than Solomon is here he says if
[1:27:44] you that's just accepted Christ by
[1:27:45] justification accept him by
[1:27:47] sanctification and clean up your life
[1:27:49] and you're still smoking Watch What
[1:27:51] Happens
[1:27:52] how much different
[1:27:54] you look back to justification you who's
[1:27:56] just stand and Justified and never
[1:27:59] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:00] step up into that sphere
[1:28:04] then look back down
[1:28:06] at the rest of it see just keep walking
[1:28:11] until after a while you get so light
[1:28:14] you just could walk on up in a rapture
[1:28:19] Oh Glory to God
[1:28:21] till after a while you get so light you
[1:28:23] could just walk on up in a Rapture talk
[1:28:27] about a breakthrough
[1:28:28] just keep walking Church

[1:28:45] walking right into the change of your
[1:28:47] body
[1:28:49] you know the prophet of God said it'll
[1:28:50] be the regular routine of following
[1:28:52] scriptures that brings on the rapture
[1:28:55] it'll be the regular routine of you just
[1:28:57] listening to a message tape it'll be the
[1:28:59] regular routine of you going to the
[1:29:00] church sisters one day it'll be the
[1:29:02] regular teen of you just getting your
[1:29:03] kids ready for church bringing your kids
[1:29:05] to school it'll be the regular routine
[1:29:07] one day you'll be cooking supper and
[1:29:09] you'll turn around to say to say
[1:29:11] supper's writing all of a sudden whoa
[1:29:14] maybe mama is that you you're young
[1:29:17] again all of a sudden I'm telling you
[1:29:19] for it just keep walking just take
[1:29:22] another step I don't care where you're
[1:29:24] living maybe the devil's trying to say
[1:29:25] you're you're only living in a Justified
[1:29:27] State you're only living in a saint I
[1:29:29] don't care just take another step
[1:29:30] tonight if you know they that you're not
[1:29:32] living right then repent of your sins if
[1:29:34] you have not been baptized in the name
[1:29:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ there's water
[1:29:38] right back your way just take another
[1:29:40] step because of one more step is going
[1:29:43] to be the change of your body
[1:29:45] Hallelujah in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:29:48] an eye we're going to be gone
[1:29:53] God wants to take your life
[1:29:56] he wants to take your body he wants to
[1:29:58] take your season of life
[1:30:01] and he wants to take the message of the
[1:30:03] hour
[1:30:04] and bring it into your circumstance
[1:30:07] so that the word becomes a reality with
[1:30:09] where you're living
[1:30:11] so many people want to clean their life
[1:30:13] up to come to God
[1:30:15] I've ran into it all the time
[1:30:19] people say well I'm not ready yet to
[1:30:21] meet God
[1:30:22] well what are you going to do
[1:30:24] you want to take a bath
[1:30:27] I'm clean now God
[1:30:30] some of them it's just an excuse
[1:30:33] because they're not ready
[1:30:36] to walk away from their sinful way of
[1:30:38] living
[1:30:39] they know there's still sin in their
[1:30:41] heart and they're still things in the
[1:30:43] world that they're attracted to
[1:30:45] and it doesn't have to be evil things
[1:30:47] like the Rich Young Ruler
[1:30:49] one thing now lackest
[1:30:51] sell all they have you say you've kept
[1:30:54] all the Commandments sell all I have and
[1:30:56] follow me see some of us aren't willing
[1:30:58] to sell out
[1:31:01] some of us like some of the things some
[1:31:04] of our entertainments and some of our
[1:31:05] apps and some of our social medias and
[1:31:07] some of our Comforts of of when we come
[1:31:10] home from a hard days of work and and
[1:31:12] and maybe when we're when the pressure's
[1:31:14] coming on there's a few things that we
[1:31:15] kind of just use for for to to take off
[1:31:18] the pressure but I'm wanting to tell you
[1:31:21] God wants to be that one
[1:31:23] if you let him Church Christ wants to be
[1:31:26] the one
[1:31:27] if you give them the first place I'm
[1:31:30] telling you you can break through and
[1:31:32] into all the blessings of God
[1:31:38] don't allow your weaknesses in your
[1:31:41] your situations to be the very thing
[1:31:43] that hinders you from going on with God
[1:31:46] to use your excuses and to use
[1:31:49] your past we've dealt with that in the
[1:31:51] pastor and the Ministries dealt with
[1:31:52] that on several occasions for you just
[1:31:54] to take God at his word
[1:31:57] what is in your hand I don't care what
[1:31:59] it is
[1:32:01] Moses yeah Moses you're going to go take
[1:32:03] over Egypt
[1:32:04] he didn't give him an artillery he
[1:32:06] didn't give him an army you know what he
[1:32:08] gave him hey Moses
[1:32:10] what's in your hand
[1:32:12] um um um
[1:32:15] stick
[1:32:16] okay we'll use that
[1:32:20] what's in your life what's in your hand
[1:32:21] brother
[1:32:23] oh well
[1:32:25] it's a broken family it's it's this it's
[1:32:28] that it's it's an illness it's a complex
[1:32:31] God says I'll take it
[1:32:34] whatever your problem whatever your
[1:32:36] situation whatever's in your hand I want
[1:32:39] to take your life I want to take your
[1:32:41] circumstances I want to take your
[1:32:43] problems and I want to prove to the
[1:32:45] world that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:32:47] yesterday today and forever and if you
[1:32:50] say to this mountain I'm breaking you
[1:32:52] through and into the fullness of the
[1:32:55] word of God in your life
[1:32:58] not just in the prophet's life not just
[1:33:00] in a forerunner's life but in your life
[1:33:02] God wants to bring the past every single
[1:33:04] promise of God
[1:33:06] oh Church lay aside every weight if the
[1:33:09] musicians would come
[1:33:12] let us lay aside every weight in the Sin
[1:33:14] which so easily besets us
[1:33:16] let us run with patience the race that's
[1:33:19] set before us
[1:33:21] oh my
[1:33:25] musicians give me a few minutes
[1:33:27] I I want to work through this
[1:33:31] by God's grace maybe we'll just have
[1:33:33] five minutes before the musicians Strike
[1:33:35] Up This is narrow down I believe it's
[1:33:38] going to bless somebody
[1:33:41] well what is it that keeps us from
[1:33:43] walking in this Liberty
[1:33:46] what is it that keeps us from living a
[1:33:48] Victorious Life
[1:33:50] why do you keep going through cycles of
[1:33:52] ups and downs and feel like you can
[1:33:54] never break all the way through or why
[1:33:56] do you come and have breakthroughs and
[1:33:58] breakthroughs
[1:34:00] why do you have to come up for prayer
[1:34:02] and come up for prayer and go through a
[1:34:03] prayer line and go through a prayer line
[1:34:06] for the same thing over and over and
[1:34:07] over maybe you have a breakthrough but
[1:34:10] then you got to go for another
[1:34:10] breakthrough but I'm telling you there's
[1:34:12] a break there's a breakthrough where you
[1:34:14] can break through and then two you can
[1:34:16] go beyond you can go higher you can go
[1:34:19] deeper into something a perfect Faith a
[1:34:21] perfect word a word that's separating
[1:34:24] all the darkness out of your life why
[1:34:26] why do you keep struggling like that why
[1:34:28] why because Satan has access to your
[1:34:30] mind he has access to your thinking he
[1:34:32] has access to your pasting and he knows
[1:34:34] how to take these things and weave it
[1:34:36] into your mind and keep you from taking
[1:34:38] God at his word
[1:34:40] question brother Branham what shall we
[1:34:42] do
[1:34:44] something has settled over me that I
[1:34:46] cannot break through
[1:34:48] last fall I dreamed I was lost in white
[1:34:50] sand it was getting dark I couldn't find
[1:34:53] my way
[1:34:54] this dream has stayed with me since last
[1:34:56] fall
[1:34:57] now I am as one groping
[1:35:00] and it's getting dark
[1:35:02] I couldn't find my way this dream has
[1:35:04] stayed with me since last fall now okay
[1:35:06] now I miss one grope in the dark I
[1:35:08] couldn't find my way he says uh my son
[1:35:11] Irvin and and wife
[1:35:15] uh my son Irvin and his wife are
[1:35:18] included in the dream now they are also
[1:35:20] in darkness we are in desperation I
[1:35:24] believe God will show you what it is and
[1:35:26] what is in our hearts now
[1:35:30] if we are wrong or have sinning places
[1:35:32] tell us
[1:35:33] we want to be right
[1:35:36] brother Randall says I don't know the
[1:35:38] lady
[1:35:41] but I just feel if if you're here lady
[1:35:44] that here is your trouble
[1:35:47] foreign
[1:35:49] Hallelujah
[1:35:51] you have let something happen to you
[1:35:53] that's made you nervous
[1:35:55] because you being in White Sands
[1:35:56] represents Purity and righteousness and
[1:35:58] you're just letting Satan pull one over
[1:36:00] on you
[1:36:03] now look the word of God is sharper than
[1:36:05] any two-edged sword person even to the
[1:36:07] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit in
[1:36:09] the joints and marrows it's a discerner
[1:36:11] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:36:12] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:36:14] and forever
[1:36:16] the word of God is the answer
[1:36:20] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:36:22] spirit and they are life
[1:36:25] and as we work through this quote that's
[1:36:27] what I'm wanting is the quickening power
[1:36:28] of God
[1:36:29] I want the Holy Ghost to come upon our
[1:36:31] lives and make this word live
[1:36:34] you know in the Bible that there was I
[1:36:36] believe a king he was he was going to go
[1:36:38] out and ask some some suse or something
[1:36:40] like that and the prophet had to say is
[1:36:42] there no bomb in Gilead
[1:36:44] why are you running to the things of the
[1:36:46] world why are you running to to these
[1:36:48] programs into all these situations and
[1:36:50] these doctors and these strings why why
[1:36:52] are you looking to the things of the
[1:36:54] world to to be the thing that gives you
[1:36:56] answers when when we have a storehouse
[1:36:58] full of the word of God that has every
[1:37:00] answer that you ever had need of that if
[1:37:03] you would just kneel in prayer and
[1:37:05] consult God there's a word that is a
[1:37:07] discerner of the thoughts and I say try
[1:37:09] God
[1:37:11] said oh God speak to me today put on a
[1:37:14] tape read your Bible press play call a
[1:37:16] brother I'll tell you God will speak to
[1:37:18] you
[1:37:22] she said something that settled over me
[1:37:24] that I just can't break through
[1:37:28] I don't know about you but is there
[1:37:29] somebody here
[1:37:31] who's ever felt they've come to a place
[1:37:33] where there's something that settled
[1:37:34] over you and you just feel like you
[1:37:36] can't break through
[1:37:40] yeah struggles with family or struggles
[1:37:42] in the church or struggles in your life
[1:37:43] listen to this now as we move through
[1:37:46] this quickly your dream proved that
[1:37:47] there's nothing wrong
[1:37:49] you're only nervous and by doing this
[1:37:51] and thinking this you're making the rest
[1:37:54] of your family nervous stop doing it
[1:37:56] claim your god-given right your dream
[1:37:59] proves by the interpretation that you
[1:38:02] are in White Sands everything is all
[1:38:04] right
[1:38:05] now if somebody can just take this from
[1:38:07] the Lord
[1:38:09] everything's all right it's you yourself
[1:38:11] nervous and you let one member of the
[1:38:13] family get nervous it goes to the next
[1:38:15] and the next member and the first thing
[1:38:16] you're all fussing and going on and one
[1:38:18] member of the family gets kind of upset
[1:38:20] about something and upsets the other and
[1:38:22] the other and the other and the first
[1:38:23] thing you know the whole family is upset
[1:38:25] it's Satan
[1:38:27] stop doing that claim your god-given
[1:38:30] rights he says then if one member of the
[1:38:32] family rejoices you can go ahead and
[1:38:34] play something that way we'll close
[1:38:37] then if one member of the family
[1:38:38] rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice
[1:38:40] with it so every one of the family tried
[1:38:43] to do that try each one of you children
[1:38:45] to help your papa and your mama mama
[1:38:47] helped Papa try to help your children
[1:38:49] don't let that gloomy
[1:38:51] unbelieving Spirit get around you you
[1:38:54] are Christians you are born of the
[1:38:57] spirit of God
[1:39:00] you're the salt of the earth you have
[1:39:02] god-given rights and the Bible said if
[1:39:05] there be any praise if there be any
[1:39:07] virtue think on these things don't think
[1:39:10] the wrong thing
[1:39:13] now I want to say we've received more
[1:39:15] than this just the interpretation of a
[1:39:16] dream
[1:39:20] now that was Deliverance for that lady
[1:39:23] but I want to say we've received more
[1:39:25] than just an interpretation of a dream
[1:39:27] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:39:30] in Christ Jesus
[1:39:32] what do you say the quickening power has
[1:39:34] come to us to open the Seven Seals
[1:39:36] you've received more than just the
[1:39:38] interpretation of a dream it shall be
[1:39:40] light in the evening time look there's a
[1:39:43] man here
[1:39:44] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:39:47] light
[1:39:48] and his name is Jesus

[1:39:52] by his name is Jesus
[1:39:54] [Music]

[1:40:05] breaking out of denominational ways of
[1:40:07] thinking we're breaking out of the
[1:40:08] intelligence of men we're breaking out
[1:40:10] of false expectations we're breaking
[1:40:13] into
[1:40:14] the very Mind Of God we're breaking into
[1:40:17] the very Capstone
[1:40:19] this is an invisible Union between you
[1:40:23] and the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:40:29] we're breaking through into an
[1:40:30] atmosphere
[1:40:32] where all things are possible
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:36] I love the story of Rahab you know she
[1:40:38] was a type of the Bride
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:41] her situation was bad
[1:40:46] here she is a prostitute on the city
[1:40:48] wall
[1:40:50] and here comes a mighty Armory to
[1:40:52] destroy every inhabitant of the city
[1:40:56] [Music]
[1:40:58] but I just look upon that story and see
[1:41:00] God smiling down
[1:41:03] saying oh Joshua
[1:41:06] there's one of mine in there
[1:41:09] You Can't Kill Them All
[1:41:11] give them a token

[1:41:31] there was that Scarlet thread hanging
[1:41:34] out of the window
[1:41:37] Rahab was just happy to be delivered
[1:41:41] Ray I was happy to be saved
[1:41:45] she could say thank God for saving me
[1:41:48] thank you God for sparing me and my
[1:41:51] family
[1:41:53] God looked at it right happens at Old
[1:41:55] Rahab
[1:41:57] if you only knew what I had planned for
[1:41:59] your life
[1:42:01] I got more than justification for you
[1:42:05] I got more than sanctification for you
[1:42:08] come on Rahab

[1:42:12] Army

[1:42:55] Holy Ghost but I came to pray have you
[1:42:58] make you have a breakthrough and into
[1:43:00] all the promises of God that if you say
[1:43:03] to this mountain

[1:56:10] Victory is
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:14] already gone
[1:56:19] [Music]
[1:56:25] without
[1:56:27] giving me
[1:56:33] feel that that prayer would help you
[1:56:36] [Music]
[1:56:39] pray with you but
[1:56:42] coming for prayer
[1:56:45] isn't
[1:56:46] coming to confess your faults or to
[1:56:50] confess your guilt
[1:56:52] you know what I mean we're all guilty
[1:56:56] and we've all sinned and come short of
[1:56:59] the glory of God
[1:57:02] but it's our faith joining with your
[1:57:06] faith
[1:57:07] that you can accept
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:11] whatever it is that you're talking
[1:57:14] and seeking
[1:57:16] Matthew preached tonight about a
[1:57:18] breakthrough
[1:57:21] talked about God having something more
[1:57:24] for you
[1:57:26] and I think all our hearts are burning
[1:57:28] that way don't you feel that
[1:57:31] that he wants to take us to
[1:57:34] higher Heights and
[1:57:36] and glorious places
[1:57:39] but I I thought one of the things he
[1:57:42] said that was so
[1:57:44] oh set my heart on fire was that you've
[1:57:48] got to be all in
[1:57:52] you know what I mean you got to be sold
[1:57:53] out
[1:57:54] you've got to be all in
[1:57:57] and I hope that
[1:58:00] there's so many wonderful statements
[1:58:02] that were made but
[1:58:07] you're predestinated to it
[1:58:11] and I think that's one of the things
[1:58:13] that we don't
[1:58:16] really have been able to grasp is the
[1:58:19] benefits and the authority
[1:58:22] that comes with predestination
[1:58:24] [Music]
[1:58:26] amen if you could
[1:58:29] totally understand
[1:58:31] I mean Matthew labored on it
[1:58:34] that God's
[1:58:36] chosen you
[1:58:38] if he's chosen you for something higher
[1:58:43] he'll provide the grace
[1:58:46] he'll provide the the love
[1:58:50] the mercy and forgiveness
[1:58:53] to unshackle any chains or any
[1:58:58] weaknesses in your flesh or any
[1:59:01] complexes
[1:59:04] it's got to step up and accept it
[1:59:09] and tell that close that book
[1:59:13] and say Lord I really want it
[1:59:16] amen play us something else
[1:59:18] [Music]
[1:59:22] let me just sing this and we'll just
[1:59:26] give an opportunity and you don't have
[1:59:28] to come for prayer
[1:59:31] but if you feel prayer would help you
[1:59:35] maybe it's just
[1:59:37] a token that you want to stand before
[1:59:39] the Lord and say Lord I'm coming before
[1:59:43] you and I'm going to have the brothers
[1:59:45] pray for me and and
[1:59:48] because I I'm gonna I'm gonna break
[1:59:50] through tonight I'm going to accept the
[1:59:54] word that you've given me yes and I'm
[1:59:57] gonna let it Minister you might want the
[1:59:59] holy skulls you might want to be born
[2:00:01] again

[2:00:06] the feeling of his presence
[2:00:09] dwelling in your heart and living
[2:00:12] with you day by day

[2:00:19] [Music]

[2:00:27] again

[2:00:35] things which are behind behind

[2:00:51] them for everything we'll just sing this
[2:00:54] song and if anyone would be need prayer
