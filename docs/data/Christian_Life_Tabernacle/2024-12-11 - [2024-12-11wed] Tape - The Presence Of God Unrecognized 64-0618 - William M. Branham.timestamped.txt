[17:22] come praise the Lord I wanted to give a
[17:26] a short testimony tonight about
[17:29] uh the goodness of God and and how good
[17:31] he's been um I won't go into a lot of
[17:35] details because I I want you to think
[17:37] that I'm a really nice person um
[17:42] um over the last six years um how I got
[17:47] here uh I was at brother I I attended
[17:50] brother Bill's ivish church and uh and
[17:54] the youth would come up every year for
[17:56] the uh the camp meeting and I I met a
[17:59] guy in the parking lot and we we begin
[18:02] to talk and fellowship and he said
[18:05] something to me and I can't tell you
[18:08] what he said but he said something to me
[18:11] and we shook hands and left I don't know
[18:14] his name I don't know his face I've been
[18:17] looking for him ever since I've been
[18:18] here I guess he doesn't go here anymore
[18:21] but anyway um I went back to work and I
[18:25] started praying I started praying about
[18:28] uh just coming here and I and I told the
[18:32] Lord I said um well send a witness so uh
[18:37] so I went about my job and and and God
[18:39] sent a witness uh my good friend who's
[18:42] not saved at the job uh you know uh we
[18:47] were working one day in the warehouse
[18:49] and she said well Jer why don't you bid
[18:51] on that job in Dallas and I could have
[18:53] fell out on the floor and um and I felt
[18:57] that that was God and that's all that I
[18:59] needed so I began to uh go through the
[19:03] process of of trying to come here and I
[19:06] I beid it on that job and I for a year
[19:10] and a half they kept turning me down I
[19:12] was over qualified for the job they just
[19:14] wouldn't give it to me for some reason I
[19:16] just didn't like me or something about
[19:19] me uh if you spend time with me you may
[19:22] get that way too but anyway
[19:26] um um so I went to work one day and I
[19:31] decided to quit and I decided to retire
[19:35] I saidwell I'm not going to I'm not
[19:37] coming here so I'll just retire and so
[19:41] you know I got a coffee in my hand and I
[19:43] I just decided to quit so I called my
[19:44] boss and I told him I'mma slide my ID
[19:47] under your door and I'mma quit today my
[19:49] last day turning in my retirement papers
[19:52] cuz I'm old enough to retire and I'm
[19:54] just going
[19:55] to hunt and fish every day so I did that
[20:00] and I got in my car in the middle of the
[20:02] day and I left and I was on my way home
[20:05] well on the way home my boss called me
[20:09] and he said what are you doing I said
[20:11] I'm retiring I I had enough of fedexes
[20:14] and I'm I'm just going to you know do it
[20:18] anyway he refused to take my um
[20:22] retirement and which I didn't understand
[20:26] so I quit my job and before I got home
[20:28] home I had my job
[20:30] back he made a phone call to the hiring
[20:34] manager here and she said
[20:39] um he called me back and said you still
[20:42] want that job is yours I don't know what
[20:44] he told her
[20:47] uh but anyway she gave me the job and
[20:50] that led the process for me coming here
[20:54] uh in the process now you got to think
[20:56] that I'm really dumb because I I I
[20:59] transferred in the middle of Co that was
[21:01] really bright right and so anyway so in
[21:06] in the mid of coming here I I uh uh I
[21:10] got covid really bad and and I'm over
[21:15] I'm over the age you know they said on
[21:17] the television you know if you're over
[21:19] 60 don't even come to the we're crosing
[21:22] everybody so you don't even need to come
[21:24] to the hospital so I'm at home dying
[21:26] because I can't go to the emergency room
[21:30] and and um it got really bad and it got
[21:33] so bad that I I literally thought I was
[21:37] going to die so at that particular day I
[21:41] decided Well uh I'm going to die at work
[21:46] you know what I'm saying because no no
[21:49] no no no I'm thinking right so I go to
[21:52] work because see you there's Double
[21:55] Indemnity if I if I die on the job
[21:57] they'll pay me double my life and
[21:59] so that would take care of my family
[22:01] right so I don't know how I made it to
[22:06] work now they have this little thing you
[22:08] know where they uh do your temperature
[22:11] when you come in I'm sick I'm sick I
[22:15] don't know how I got to the job I don't
[22:17] know how I got to streaming but anyway
[22:21] they put this little thing on my head
[22:23] and it's green they let me
[22:26] in I'm knowing a going to turn me around
[22:29] right so it's green so I go to work I go
[22:32] in the job and then I go back in the
[22:34] warehouse in a quiet place and I pray
[22:37] and I said Lord U they're going to find
[22:40] me back here you know so I lifted my
[22:43] hands up to God and I did the sentence
[22:45] prayer to make sure I was okay and and
[22:49] and uh at that particular point I was so
[22:53] weak I couldn't even stand up and I was
[22:55] starting to fall and I figured I was
[22:58] just going to fall fall on the floor and
[22:59] somebody would find me
[23:01] eventually now before I hit the
[23:06] floor I got
[23:08] strength I don't know where it came from
[23:11] I went down and I came back up I looked
[23:15] around I said well I guess God don't
[23:17] want me either so
[23:20] uh I went on back to work so that was
[23:23] the end I'm I'm feeling good I'm eating
[23:26] you know I I can't remember I remember
[23:28] walking in my dog and I was so weak that
[23:32] I just laid on the ground I'm sitting
[23:34] there holding the lease I'm looking up
[23:37] and the dog is licking me and he's just
[23:39] walking all around but I couldn't even
[23:40] get up because I was just that was where
[23:44] I was but anyway to make a long story
[23:46] short and I'm I'm trying to make it
[23:48] short um I ended up here and and me and
[23:53] my boss we don't get along at all and
[23:58] so I couldn't come to Wednesday nights
[24:01] because uh I'm the low man on the totem
[24:05] pole so I have to everybody bids and
[24:07] whatever they have left but that's what
[24:10] I get so I could never be able to come
[24:13] to church on Wednesday night because
[24:15] that so for the last four years I
[24:18] haven't been here
[24:20] and but miraculously in the last six
[24:24] months God has moved three people for
[24:27] one reason or another another and I'm
[24:29] here on Wednesday night because that's
[24:31] my schedule I'm off on Wednesday night
[24:34] and I thank and praise God I don't know
[24:36] what
[24:38] God is
[24:40] doing I know why I'm here and I can't
[24:43] tell you that um but I know God is going
[24:46] to do it because I've gone through so
[24:48] many obstacles in order to be here and
[24:52] the most important thing that that I can
[24:55] share with you is the importance of
[24:57] family if you I have a son that has
[25:01] taught me how to pray I only have one
[25:04] kid and I thank God he didn't give me
[25:07] more than one because Jasper is um um
[25:13] he's my best friend and he's my biggest
[25:15] enemy and and then I don't understand
[25:18] people that have children and their
[25:20] hearts AR burdened for their children
[25:23] the children are out there doing
[25:25] whatever they doing it and they seem to
[25:27] be content and there's no burden or
[25:29] there's no passion in your heart for
[25:31] your children that you brought into this
[25:35] world but my greatest desire is to see
[25:38] uh uh God do something for the Clayton
[25:41] family uh and for some reason he's going
[25:45] to do it here and I don't understand
[25:48] that but just like Abraham sometimes God
[25:51] has to take you away from your family
[25:54] and bring you to a place that you don't
[25:57] know anybody
[25:58] you know cuz I first met with Brother
[26:00] David I told him I've never heard you
[26:03] preach I'm sorry I've never seen your
[26:06] church I just met one of your members
[26:09] and they said something that kind of
[26:11] pricked me in my heart and based on the
[26:14] testimony uh I'm here but so when you
[26:19] hear me praying crying out for Jasper uh
[26:22] he's the love of my life um
[26:26] U and I don't want to leave
[26:30] here until Jasper's
[26:33] okay you know I can't leave here till
[26:37] he's okay and if you have children you
[26:40] should be the same way you shouldn't
[26:42] want to go to heaven and leave your
[26:44] children in a mess cuz my my boy's in a
[26:48] mess but I but he's mine he's my mess
[26:53] and I thank and praise God for it let's
[26:55] look to God In Prayer Heavenly Father we
[26:58] we come Lord God tonight in the precious
[27:00] name of Jesus always Lord God we're
[27:03] reaching out to families Lord
[27:08] God
[27:13] Jesus Lord God we have children Lord God
[27:16] that don't know you and the pardon of
[27:19] their sins Lord
[27:22] God there are none another mouth to feed
[27:25] but you have given us a soul to lead
[27:27] Lord Lord God and I pray and ask in the
[27:30] name of Jesus that you would continue to
[27:33] minister and move by your Mighty power
[27:37] Lord God Heavenly Father we praise you
[27:39] and we magnify your name we believe that
[27:42] this day this hour was ordained by you
[27:46] that it was for a purpose that through
[27:49] our suffering Lord God that someone else
[27:52] might find Hope Lord God as we assemble
[27:56] together with those of light precious
[27:59] Faith Lord God we continue to trust you
[28:02] and praise you and magnify your name we
[28:06] are so grateful and so thankful for your
[28:08] word Lord God how you ministered and
[28:10] moved in such a mighty way we know that
[28:14] you are a Healer and a deliverer Lord
[28:16] God for the brother with cancer Lord God
[28:19] the same God that Lifted Me Up he can
[28:21] lift you up Lord God if only we would
[28:24] believe and Reach Out And Touch the hymn
[28:27] of your God
[28:28] those who are families have been torn
[28:30] apart because because we have not done
[28:34] what we are supposed to do as
[28:36] men oh if we would only confess our
[28:40] faults he is faithful and just to
[28:42] forgive us of our fault and to cleanse
[28:44] us from all
[28:46] righteousness I remember when Cosman was
[28:49] preaching his sermon Lord
[28:51] God of how Lord God being a good Hunter
[28:54] brother briman was but he was lost Lord
[28:57] God
[28:59] so many times we're lost Lord God we
[29:03] we've lost our families and we don't
[29:05] know how to reach out but the Bible says
[29:08] if we would be faithful and just and

[34:23] amen man we're going to be listening to
[34:25] a tape the Pres presence of God
[34:28] unrecognized Amen we'll start from uh I
[34:32] believe paragraph 6 that's where the
[34:34] text is read and and right after the
[34:37] text is read we'll uh go on and and and
[34:40] sit down amen the brothers if you could
[34:42] just play that
[34:50] amen tonight is the presence of God
[34:56] unrecognized
[34:58] last night we were talking of Jesus
[35:01] being the same yesterday today and
[35:02] forever and see that he was the same
[35:05] yesterday day forever now his presence
[35:07] if he is the same is
[35:09] unrecognized let us read then certain of
[35:13] the scribes and of the Pharisees
[35:15] answered saying Master we would see a
[35:19] sign from thee but he answered and said
[35:22] unto them an evil and adulterous
[35:24] generation seek after a
[35:26] sign and there shall be no sign given
[35:29] unto it but the sign of the Prophet
[35:33] Jonas for as Jonas was three days and
[35:37] three nights in the whale's belly so
[35:40] shall the son of man be three days and
[35:42] three nights in the heart of the Earth
[35:44] the man of Nineveh shall rise in the
[35:47] Judgment with this generation and shall
[35:49] condemn it because they repented at the
[35:52] preaching of
[35:54] Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is
[35:57] this
[35:58] year and the queen of the South shall
[36:01] rise up in the Judgment with this
[36:02] generation and shall condemn it or she
[36:05] came from the uttermost parts of the
[36:07] Earth the year the wisdom of
[36:09] Solomon and behold greater than Solomon
[36:12] is
[36:16] here the unrecognized presence what
[36:20] could these people be thinking
[36:22] of God has always it's been that way
[36:26] every time he comes
[36:28] when Jesus was here the first time he
[36:30] said uh you you whiten and you garnish
[36:34] the walls in the tombs of the prophets
[36:37] and you put them in there see something
[36:40] happens and it passes by and God hides
[36:43] it from the eyes of wise and prudent and
[36:45] reveals it to Bab such as will learn
[36:48] Jesus thanked the father for doing such
[36:51] see it goes right by the people and they
[36:53] don't know it for instance you Catholic
[36:55] people here tonight do you remember a
[36:57] few years ago Jon of Arc in France the
[37:01] little lady that was really she led the
[37:04] Revolutionary in France but she was
[37:07] really a a servant of Christ what did
[37:10] your church do to her burner at the
[37:13] stake as a witch because she seen
[37:15] visions and was spiritual the Catholic
[37:18] church burned her as a witch at the
[37:21] state because she was spiritual in seen
[37:24] Visions a few years afterwards they
[37:26] found out that that woman was a saint so
[37:29] of course you done great Penance you dug
[37:32] up those priest body that condemned her
[37:34] and burned her and thr him into the
[37:36] river of course that you done great
[37:37] pentant for that for digging up this
[37:39] priest's body now in the days of the
[37:43] prophets what
[37:45] happened they did the same thing they
[37:47] didn't recognize them till they had done
[37:49] come Ministry had finished took out of
[37:52] that the elected and
[37:54] then after they were gone they recogniz
[37:58] that they had been a prophet among them
[38:00] Jesus he came to the Earth that endowed
[38:04] within him was the father God I am my
[38:08] father a one my father dwelleth in me
[38:11] it's not me that doeth the works but my
[38:12] father and if I do not the works of my
[38:15] father believe me not now if you notice
[38:19] when he came about one one 90th of the
[38:25] world knew that he is even on Earth
[38:27] Earth at that time and yet the savior of
[38:29] the
[38:30] world and then they never recognized who
[38:33] he was even the church or no one else
[38:35] heart until they crucified him buried
[38:38] and rose on the third day before they
[38:41] ever knowed who he was it comes in and
[38:44] goes out and people does not recognize
[38:47] it until it's
[38:49] passed and they because that it never
[38:52] fits their theology it never fits the
[38:55] time of the day you see what it is
[38:57] they're always living in a glare of
[38:59] another
[39:01] age
[39:02] always the reason they didn't accept
[39:05] Jesus because they were living in the
[39:06] glare of the
[39:07] law and when Jesus came was not contrary
[39:11] to the law but come to fulfill the law
[39:14] well they couldn't accept him because
[39:15] his message wasn't exactly the way they
[39:17] had it all created out and it was called
[39:19] then
[39:20] traditions and they he didn't come
[39:22] according to the Traditions he didn't
[39:24] keep their traditions and really he up
[39:27] set it and tore it up and and done
[39:29] things that was contrary to it in so
[39:31] much as they thought he was breaking up
[39:32] the churches and they couldn't receive
[39:34] him because of his message and we all
[39:37] know today that he come exactly in the
[39:40] line of God's prophecy amen but they
[39:42] didn't know it then and it could happen
[39:45] again and we wouldn't know it I imagine
[39:47] if he had actually appeared tonight it
[39:49] would be so contrary to what we got all
[39:52] figured up on our charts and in our
[39:54] schools and things that be very few
[39:56] would recognize what was going on
[39:58] he said it would be how he come now
[40:01] Jesus being there so scripturally
[40:04] identified by the scriptures and the
[40:06] scribes and Pharisees of that day could
[40:09] not recognize him why didn't they why
[40:12] didn't they do it because they had it
[40:15] figured out some other way that's where
[40:18] Jesus told him search the scriptures for
[40:20] in them you think you have eternal life
[40:23] and they are they that testify of me see
[40:26] now he come exactly with the scriptures
[40:29] but they had to figured out maybe that
[40:31] if he would come uh uh the Messiah would
[40:34] probably do what Moses did or what an
[40:36] Noah did Bill him an arc or something
[40:38] else but we reason he come the way he
[40:41] did they hadn't figured out in the
[40:43] scriptures with their traditions did not
[40:45] teach them so the people were so
[40:47] confused they didn't know what was going
[40:49] on wonder if that could happen today I
[40:52] wonder if it could be different than
[40:54] what our Traditions has taught us and it
[40:56] could come and something had passed
[40:58] through and we never even know until
[40:59] it's already passed and then it's over
[41:02] that's just about the way it'll come do
[41:04] you know when John the Baptist came on
[41:06] the scene that have been predicted all
[41:08] the way from the book of Isaiah hundreds
[41:10] of years about 800 years Isaiah
[41:12] prophesied a think before the coming of
[41:14] Christ did you know John came exactly
[41:17] the way Isaiah said he would come he
[41:19] come exactly the way Malachi said he
[41:21] would come and even the apostles didn't
[41:24] recognize it one day in Matthew 11 John
[41:28] was in prison and the apostles uh some
[41:31] of his disciples went over to ask Jesus
[41:33] was he the one or or should they look
[41:36] for another now notice Jesus did not uh
[41:39] give them a book of how to behave
[41:41] themselves how to behave himself in jail
[41:44] or how to conduct his character he said
[41:46] stay around and watch what happens and
[41:49] go show John the things that you seen
[41:51] happened that was the evidence that the
[41:55] he was that word
[41:57] and I remember the word always comes to
[42:00] a prophet we all know that God does
[42:03] nothing without showing it to His
[42:04] prophets that's the reason the book of
[42:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ is the
[42:09] full fullness of Christ right here
[42:11] before it's the book now he'll have to
[42:14] send one someone to confirm that book
[42:17] reveal it open the seals and so forth
[42:19] but as far as any farther revelation of
[42:21] Christ is already recognized right here
[42:23] he's the fullness of this of the
[42:25] Revelation I know no never does it fail
[42:29] but the word comes to the prophet look
[42:32] at John standing in the water predicting
[42:35] the prophet that the Messiah was right
[42:37] then among them he said there's one
[42:38] standing among you now that you don't
[42:41] know he'll baptize you with the Holy
[42:44] Ghost and Fire now remember he was
[42:46] standing right among them the Bible said
[42:48] so and they didn't recognize it one day
[42:51] when Jesus came walking down John
[42:54] recognized him he said Behold the Lamb
[42:56] of God the takes away the sin of the
[42:58] world now watch before he was recognized
[43:01] by anybody he came to the prophet he was
[43:05] the
[43:06] word John was a prophet I remember my
[43:10] old Baptist teacher told me said you
[43:12] know what happened said Jesus baptized
[43:14] John I said I don't think so he said
[43:17] sure John was never baptized he come
[43:19] preaching baptizing nobody was worthy to
[43:21] baptize him Jesus baptized him I said I
[43:24] don't know him one day while in studyed
[43:26] the Holy Spirit revealed it like this
[43:28] see watch he walked out of the water he
[43:30] said why comest thou unto me I have need
[43:33] to be baptized to thee Jesus said suffer
[43:35] that to be so watch but thus it is
[43:39] becoming to us behooving us that we
[43:41] fulfill all righteousness John being a
[43:45] prophet knowing the word the sacrifice
[43:47] he was must be washed before presented
[43:50] then he was baptized John baptized him
[43:53] because it's becoming to us that we
[43:54] fulfill all righteousness yes the word
[43:58] came to the prophet in the water and
[44:01] then when he was baptized still the
[44:03] people and the Holy Spirit came down not
[44:06] everybody saw it John saw it the angel
[44:09] of the Lord can be right here tonight
[44:11] and maybe one person see it no one
[44:14] else that light that star that come over
[44:17] every Observatory where they the wise
[44:20] man followed no Observatory knows
[44:23] anything about it no one else saw it at
[44:25] all but those wise men because it was
[44:27] far them to see it amen they saw it it
[44:30] was real to them when the light the
[44:32] pillar of fire smokee Paul down on the
[44:34] road to Damascus he recognized that he
[44:37] was in the presence of God now that
[44:39] Hebrew would have never called any other
[44:42] Spirit Lord besides he know it that was
[44:44] the same Pillar of Fire that led his
[44:45] people out of the Wilderness he said
[44:47] Lord who are you Saul Saul while
[44:50] persecutest thou me he said I'm
[44:52] Jesus Jesus said I come from God and I
[44:55] return to God he was that that fire that
[44:58] was in the burning bush that led Moses
[45:00] through the Wilderness and he returned
[45:02] back to that and now here he was on the
[45:05] road down to Damascus it was stricken
[45:06] down and all the man was with him they
[45:09] never saw that pillar of far and it was
[45:10] so so real to Paul to put his eyes out
[45:14] and he had to be led down to the street
[45:16] called straight in Damascus he was blind
[45:20] ananas a prophet down there saw in a
[45:22] vision went laid hands on him and he
[45:25] received the Holy Ghost and the scales
[45:26] fell from his eyes and he could see
[45:28] again it was so real to him to put his
[45:31] eyes out and yet none of the rest of
[45:34] them recognized it being there could see
[45:36] it so so is it tonight there's somebody
[45:40] sitting right there can bring God on the
[45:43] scene when the other don't know nothing
[45:44] about it
[45:46] amen recognizing God Jesus when he was
[45:50] here on Earth and had fully perform the
[45:53] sign that the Bible said that he would
[45:56] do but they didn't recognize it because
[45:59] it wasn't according to their tradition
[46:02] for that age he wasn't to come and do
[46:05] what Moses did he was to come and be
[46:07] born of a virgin and he according to
[46:09] Deuteronomy 18:15 he was to be a prophet
[46:13] and exactly he did those works and
[46:16] signs the Jews always sought signs they
[46:20] were taught to never to depend on
[46:23] intellectual
[46:24] speeches the Jews know better than than
[46:27] that the Greeks taught that but not
[46:30] intellectual speeches but upon signs
[46:32] show us a sign these people want said
[46:36] Rabbi or master show us a sign they want
[46:39] to know and he had already showed them
[46:41] the sign and they wanted a different
[46:43] kind of sign but he could only do the
[46:45] sign of that age so does he today this
[46:49] pouring out of the Holy Ghost is a sign
[46:51] of his appearing amen even in this age
[46:55] as he promised they want a sign and he
[46:59] had given the scriptural sign but they
[47:01] wanted a different sign that's where so
[47:04] many people today is going to be
[47:06] confused you know the Rapture might take
[47:08] place and just think of the sadness of
[47:11] it let me go back to word Jesus or John
[47:14] sent his disciples over to see Jesus if
[47:17] he was the Messiah or not that hour he
[47:21] done many things when he returned back
[47:23] the disciples to tell John what they had
[47:25] seen Jesus Jesus said to those sitting
[47:28] there said what went you out to see in
[47:30] the wilderness what went you out to see
[47:32] when John was preaching did you go out
[47:34] and see a man clothed in white Raymond
[47:36] and so forth or or soft raymen said they
[47:39] are the in King's palaces they bury the
[47:42] dead and kiss the babies and marry the
[47:45] young and so forth that they don't know
[47:47] the handling of a two-handed sword said
[47:49] what did you go out to see then a reed
[47:52] shaking with any wind somebody some
[47:54] group will offer him a little more money
[47:55] and he'll go over to this one and
[47:56] instead of going in the calling of the
[47:57] Lord not John somebody could twist him
[48:00] around and say we'll give you more if
[48:01] you'll uh deny this and take this not
[48:04] John he said what did you go out to see
[48:07] than a prophet he said I say unto you
[48:10] more than a prophet and if you can
[48:13] receive it this is who who the prophet
[48:15] said behold I send my messenger before
[48:17] my face which will prepare the way and
[48:19] that was Malachi 3 where he did it one
[48:22] day the disciples asked and said why did
[48:23] the scribes say that Elias must first
[48:26] come Jesus said he's already coming you
[48:29] didn't know
[48:30] it and they understood that it was John
[48:33] the Baptist those elected Apostles still
[48:36] couldn't see who he was that was the
[48:39] Elijah amen now look you know the the
[48:42] coming of the Lord is going to be a
[48:44] secret coming he said there'll be two in
[48:46] the bed and I'll take one and leave one
[48:48] that's where the the night is two in a
[48:51] field I'll take one and leave on you
[48:53] know there's so many people disappear
[48:55] every day off the face of the Earth and
[48:56] nobody can account for one of these days
[48:59] it might be that people might say well
[49:02] you mean the tribulation of things on us
[49:03] now I thought the church used to go
[49:05] before the
[49:06] tribulation they don't realize and
[49:09] understand that the Rapture could take
[49:11] place and they know nothing about it
[49:13] it's a secret going of the church amen
[49:16] and think people go right on preaching
[49:17] saying they believe they're getting
[49:19] saved and adding in the church and
[49:21] building churches and going on just like
[49:22] they did in the days of Noah and so
[49:24] forth and not know it and the rapture
[49:26] done
[49:28] past it's already happened and you
[49:30] didn't know it there hundreds of people
[49:33] disappear from the earth and people know
[49:34] nothing about where they went through
[49:35] they can't account for it somebody was
[49:37] going somewhere they never hear from
[49:38] them no more and that could be the
[49:41] Rapture I tell you friends just because
[49:44] that we are members of the church or
[49:46] something like that that doesn't mean
[49:48] too much to us you better buckle up that
[49:52] armor amen you better take that whole
[49:54] word of God and hold on to it and quit
[49:57] this Hollywood acting around here it's
[50:00] got right into the church and it's a
[50:02] shame but Hollywood glows just makes a
[50:07] bright light and the church today is
[50:09] trying to compare with Hollywood Christ
[50:11] is not in
[50:12] Hollywood Christ is in the
[50:15] individual Hollywood glow Hollywood
[50:18] glares while the gospel glows with
[50:21] humility God in in these great fine
[50:23] fancy places and all this stuff that we
[50:25] see he comes in in humility in form of
[50:29] meekness and gentleness pass right
[50:31] through and if you're acquainted with
[50:33] the word you'll see
[50:35] it he that has an eye to hear Let Him
[50:38] hear what the spirit sayth to the
[50:39] churches thing now now today which was
[50:43] identified he identified himself
[50:46] properly to the Believers that they them
[50:48] who were looking for it look at Peter
[50:51] and Andrew look at Nathaniel no question
[50:54] in his mind look at the woman at the
[50:56] well there was no question but these
[50:59] Pharisees a few days before where our
[51:01] textes tonight saw him do that and then
[51:04] called him be Alba a devil The Works
[51:08] have been done they had to answer their
[51:10] congregation so the only thing they
[51:12] could do would call it a evil spirit be
[51:14] elah was a devil like a fortune teller
[51:17] or something and anyone knows that
[51:19] fortune telling is of the
[51:21] devil and they was comparing where he
[51:23] was the word that know the secret of the
[51:26] heart and and proving he was that
[51:28] Prophet that was to be raised up to us
[51:31] in this day the Redeemer prophet and
[51:34] when he did that the church in that day
[51:37] declared him to be be elub you see what
[51:40] he was he said you're blind leading the
[51:42] blind amen they won't come in neither
[51:45] will they let them it's under him come
[51:47] in what we want to do today is find out
[51:50] the
[51:51] truth we've got to know the truth is he
[51:54] the same is he here fulfill what he
[51:57] promised to fulfill amen search the
[52:00] scriptures and find what he's supposed
[52:01] to do
[52:02] today that's the reason that John Wesley
[52:05] or Martin Luther couldn't go on with
[52:06] Wesley's message they organized it
[52:09] that's as far as he could go along come
[52:11] Luther out a Catholic church and he they
[52:14] is a crank to them but he had the
[52:16] message of justification because it was
[52:18] a word of God a promise then they after
[52:22] his death they organized the Luther
[52:24] organization then what happened it got
[52:26] all cuddled up again and according to
[52:28] the scripture there's got to be another
[52:30] church age raise and when it did the
[52:32] Philadelphia Church age raise John
[52:34] Wesley what it happened kept coming
[52:36] Westward all the time and when it
[52:39] happened there was the church age and
[52:42] John Wesley raised up but Luther could
[52:44] not receive it because his already
[52:46] organized to justification he could not
[52:48] accept sanctification then when the
[52:50] wesle organized the way they did and the
[52:53] little branches went off which did Along
[52:55] come the Pentecost message of the
[52:57] restoration of the gifts none of them
[52:59] can move there's already organized now
[53:02] the pitiful part of it is the
[53:04] Pentecostal so
[53:07] organized look at the day we're living
[53:09] in what's promised for this day where
[53:11] are we we've moved on up the pillar of
[53:14] fire moves and the children of Israel
[53:16] move with the pillar of fire or they
[53:18] went back to Egypt we've got to move
[53:21] with the
[53:23] word and today we're getting so slothful
[53:25] the church is getting so whirly and so
[53:28] indifferent and so their mind so muddled
[53:30] up with television and we love Susi and
[53:33] some of these old things and staying
[53:34] home that shows where the people's
[53:36] hearts
[53:37] are you can tell them these things are
[53:39] wrong and they think you're
[53:41] crazy what is it lovers of pleasure more
[53:45] than lovers of
[53:47] God oh the greatest pleasure I know of
[53:50] is to be to pray until I can realize
[53:53] that I'm in the presence of God and
[53:55] recognize it I think that ought to be
[53:57] the thrill of the
[53:59] church is the presence of the Holy
[54:02] Spirit seeing the god that made the
[54:04] promise standing among
[54:06] us feel his presence and see his word
[54:09] and see it Vindicated it ought to give
[54:12] Faith to make cripples walk blind see
[54:14] death here dumb
[54:16] [Music]
[54:17] speak I stood in South Africa where had
[54:20] some 200,000 people at the Durban
[54:23] Racetrack and when they seen one time
[54:25] that happened like that after explained
[54:27] it to them just a little a mile farm and
[54:30] they seen one thing take place of that
[54:33] revealed and
[54:36] 25,000 people was instantly healed at
[54:39] once they had taken seven van loads
[54:43] trucks as long as mere six and 18
[54:44] wheelers like that and piled them full
[54:46] of old crutches and things heathens that
[54:49] didn't know which is right and left hand
[54:52] the next day Mr Sydney Smith the mayor
[54:54] of Durban called me and said go to your
[54:56] window out towards the Indian Ocean
[54:58] you'll see something you never seen
[55:00] there was the police escort coming down
[55:02] with seven of those big b loads with
[55:05] hundreds of people walking behind it the
[55:07] day before was in the stretchers and Cs
[55:10] and carriers that they had singing only
[55:13] believe all things are
[55:15] possible a week before that they were in
[55:18] war with one another native war and
[55:20] there they was walking arm in arm hand
[55:23] in hand hallah why they recognize the
[55:27] god of Heaven had appeared before them
[55:29] in the form of his
[55:31] word we inter lectual Americans set
[55:35] they'll raise in the day of the judgment
[55:37] and condemn this generation for what
[55:39] we've
[55:40] seen reminds me of a woman in Louisville
[55:43] Kentucky not long ago had a little baby
[55:45] walking around in the 10 cent store and
[55:47] she was doing little things trying to
[55:49] get it to notice a little baby kept
[55:50] staring straight out and finally she
[55:53] picked up a little bell anything that
[55:54] would ought to track the atten of a
[55:56] little fell about that size and she
[55:58] shook the Bell and the little fell just
[56:00] stared right straight in front and she
[56:02] begins screaming and fell over and some
[56:03] of the people come to help her she said
[56:05] oh no it can't be it can't be said
[56:08] what's the matter said the doctor said
[56:09] the baby was better said what's the
[56:11] matter with the baby lady said well it
[56:13] took a spell about 6 months ago that
[56:16] just sits and stares no matter what it
[56:19] is ought to attract attention of that
[56:21] baby it won't attract its attention it
[56:23] just set some stairs the doctor told me
[56:25] he thought it was better and I brought
[56:27] it down here to pick up little gadgets
[56:29] that ought to attract that child and it
[56:31] doesn't he still sits and stares that's
[56:33] the way the church is getting yes God
[56:36] shook every promise in the Bible before
[56:39] them still we just sat and stare looking
[56:42] what show me his time and it's going on
[56:45] all the time right around
[56:47] us bringing the presence of God it ought
[56:51] to illuminate us God made a promise he
[56:54] stands by that promise
[56:56] yes
[56:58] sir after Jesus had so proven his
[57:01] Messiah sign that he was that Messiah
[57:04] yet face of all that show us a sign see
[57:09] they didn't recognize they were staring
[57:11] Straight Ahead them it wasn't in them to
[57:13] believe you as my old southern mother
[57:15] used to say you can't get blood out of a
[57:17] turnup because there's none there still
[57:20] didn't recognize him so blinded by their
[57:22] Creeds and and and so forth that they
[57:25] had that they they never knew the
[57:27] scriptures of the promise because the
[57:30] Creeds had covered it
[57:32] up their Creeds and traditions of that
[57:35] day had covered up the scripture promise
[57:38] if they had been taught according to the
[57:39] scripture that that was supposed to be
[57:41] the sign that followed the Messiah how
[57:44] many believe that he come in his right
[57:46] sign sure he did he come according to
[57:49] the promise but they have been taught a
[57:51] Creed we believe in this and we believe
[57:53] in that all of them believe in God all
[57:55] of them the today we Americans
[57:57] especially we think that we're going to
[57:59] be excused because we build big churches
[58:01] and have fine pastors and things
[58:03] remember if that was so God's unjust if
[58:06] he takes us in like that for Cain and
[58:09] Abel the two first worshippers outside
[58:11] of Eden they built an altar to the Lord
[58:14] both of them made sacrifice both of them
[58:16] offered gifts both of them prayed but
[58:18] one was right and the other was
[58:21] wrong notice we must have the truth and
[58:24] the truth is God's word all always now
[58:28] the same today people become so blinded
[58:30] to say I say are you are you a Christian
[58:33] or I belong to certain certain things
[58:35] see that don't have nothing to do with
[58:36] it I ain't got nothing against that but
[58:38] that's not what I'm trying to tell you
[58:41] belong to any church you want to your
[58:43] brand don't make any difference I was
[58:44] telling a pastor this morning up in
[58:46] Colorado used to ride around up and so
[58:49] forth and I used to sit there with my
[58:51] leg across the saddle like that and the
[58:53] troubles River uh her Association grazes
[58:57] of troubles from River Valley then you
[58:59] got up the top of the valley you got the
[59:01] the East and West F all the cattle from
[59:03] here up and the association grazes the
[59:05] West Fark and and the group that I was
[59:08] with Graz the East Fark then they had
[59:10] the drift fence there to keep the cattle
[59:12] off the private property and up into the
[59:14] mountains to the summer and we'd round
[59:16] the cattle up four or five different
[59:18] brands eight or 10 different brands on
[59:19] the river would round up her cattle in
[59:21] the spring take them up there and I used
[59:23] to sit there my leg across a horn of the
[59:25] satellite we got all the cattle is all
[59:27] branded and everything starting to back
[59:28] up on the pasture and the ranger stood
[59:31] there he was counting them as he went
[59:32] through and I noticed there's all kinds
[59:35] of Brands Mr Grimes had a the uh the the
[59:40] Diamond Bar and just above us had the
[59:42] turkey TR we had the old tripod and his
[59:45] different brands went through there but
[59:47] the the ranger didn't notice the
[59:49] brand he noticed a blood tag in the ear
[59:53] there was nothing could go on that
[59:54] pasture to keep the breeding ass
[59:56] Association they their cattle true to
[59:58] the breed nothing could go on there but
[1:00:00] a third Brad Herford it had to be tagged
[1:00:03] in the ear by the blood Mark that's the
[1:00:05] way it'll be at the Judgment he's not
[1:00:07] going to ask me if I was a a Methodist
[1:00:09] Baptist Presbyterian what brand I have
[1:00:11] won't mean nothing to him it's nothing
[1:00:13] but a born again bloodborn Christian of
[1:00:16] the blood of Jesus
[1:00:18] Christ that'll be what will go in
[1:00:20] nothing less than that will go in now we
[1:00:23] want to remember remember that now now
[1:00:27] when he's not recognized his power is
[1:00:29] all is always not revealed when he's not
[1:00:33] recognized no matter how much God
[1:00:35] standing present you've got to believe
[1:00:36] it that's all like the woman with the
[1:00:39] blood
[1:00:39] issue all them people passing mind all
[1:00:42] them stand up saying there goes the
[1:00:44] rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a
[1:00:45] Prophet this is the fanatic and all such
[1:00:48] as that but what happened this little
[1:00:50] woman had an issue of blood and she had
[1:00:53] heard about him and when she come down
[1:00:54] there regardless of what anybody said
[1:00:57] she recognized who he was and she said
[1:01:00] if I can only touch His
[1:01:03] Garment see and when that genuine faith
[1:01:07] in God became a positive thing to her
[1:01:11] what did it release it released his
[1:01:13] power to heal her it touched him in such
[1:01:16] a way he turned around and told her what
[1:01:18] was wrong with her and said your faith
[1:01:20] has saved you what did Faith other stand
[1:01:24] there might been sicker than she but you
[1:01:26] see she recognized his presence she know
[1:01:30] that was her opportunity if we could
[1:01:32] only do that tonight people if we could
[1:01:35] only realize that he's appearing to us
[1:01:38] in these meetings for one purpose that's
[1:01:41] to release our desires that we have in
[1:01:45] him to us but we've got to recognize his
[1:01:48] presence and now how you recognize his
[1:01:51] presence is when the promised word for
[1:01:53] this age is made manifest
[1:01:56] not the promised word of Moses age or
[1:01:59] any other ages the promise of the word
[1:02:01] for this age now we find out he went
[1:02:04] right on in j a little fell up there
[1:02:06] with a dead daughter she he believed
[1:02:10] what he said was the truth now remember
[1:02:12] he was a priest and he was forbidden
[1:02:14] because it' been strictly told anybody
[1:02:16] that associated with him would be put
[1:02:17] out of the synagogue well whether he was
[1:02:19] put out or where he wasn't he was
[1:02:22] satisfied that God was present in Christ
[1:02:25] and that was the word amen what did it
[1:02:28] do it released to him the resurrection
[1:02:30] power that was in him
[1:02:33] amen forth a girl that was dead and laid
[1:02:37] out because he recognized that God was
[1:02:40] in Christ and his presence was in his
[1:02:44] house but in the city where he was
[1:02:47] brought up at that same power was ining
[1:02:50] in the city where he was brought up at
[1:02:53] but they never recognized him his
[1:02:56] presence to them didn't mean nothing
[1:02:58] maybe some fanatic where is these things
[1:03:01] they tell me that you do so and so let
[1:03:03] me see you do them here haven't you
[1:03:06] heard that if there you bunch of
[1:03:08] Pentecostals and you people if you
[1:03:10] believe in Divine Healing here's some so
[1:03:12] over here let me see you heal him that's
[1:03:14] that same old Evel the same one said if
[1:03:17] thou be the Son of God command these
[1:03:19] stones to be made bread the same old
[1:03:22] devil when he had his eyes covered up he
[1:03:24] hit him on the head with a stick and
[1:03:25] said now passor stick one to the other
[1:03:27] and said tell us who hits you and we'll
[1:03:28] believe you if you're a prophet you
[1:03:30] never you don't clown for anybody amen
[1:03:33] same one when he was on the cross said
[1:03:35] if thou be the Son of God come off the
[1:03:37] cross and prove that you're the Son of
[1:03:39] God he could have done it they paid him
[1:03:42] the greatest tribute he ever had there
[1:03:43] but they didn't know it they said he
[1:03:45] saved others himself he can't save if he
[1:03:47] would have saved himself he couldn't
[1:03:49] have saved others he gave himself so he
[1:03:51] could save others they didn't recognize
[1:03:54] the presence of God that s now it
[1:03:58] releases the power to heal and what
[1:04:00] it'll release the power to open your
[1:04:02] eyes to recognize him or blind your eyes
[1:04:04] so you'll never recognize it what opens
[1:04:06] the eyes of one close the eyes of the
[1:04:08] unbeliever but the city they didn't have
[1:04:11] no confidence in him at the Pharisees
[1:04:13] house he invited him down at Simon a
[1:04:16] Pharisee and he made a great supper and
[1:04:18] Pharisee wanted to proed to him he was
[1:04:20] no Prophet so he was back there toasting
[1:04:23] with his glasses and his goblets and all
[1:04:25] the fine perfumes in the house and Jesus
[1:04:27] had got in past the foot wash flunky and
[1:04:30] had sat down here and dirty the stink of
[1:04:33] the the field on him where the animals
[1:04:35] have been along the path and his
[1:04:37] garments that's the reason they wash
[1:04:38] feet in them days and you see the first
[1:04:41] thing when you're invited to a to a h
[1:04:43] home there in Palestine when they wore
[1:04:45] those sandals the first thing they did
[1:04:47] was to wash your feet and then give you
[1:04:49] something to walk on their carpets the
[1:04:51] great Persian rugs and things was
[1:04:53] beautiful the next thing they done they
[1:04:54] they give you some in your hand and it
[1:04:57] it's got out of a little apple it's
[1:04:58] found way in the mountain a rose Apple
[1:05:00] after the rose is gone it leavs the
[1:05:02] apple and fine perfumes and they they
[1:05:04] rub it over their face and that direct
[1:05:06] raise of the Palestinian sun is horrible
[1:05:10] and you see that cre an older and and
[1:05:13] then when you do then the host comes to
[1:05:15] the door and he kisses them on the neck
[1:05:17] and makes him welcome how did them
[1:05:21] flunkies ever let Jesus get by without
[1:05:23] washing his feet or or giving him oil to
[1:05:26] anoint himself or even kiss him welcome
[1:05:29] but there's a little prostitute out on
[1:05:31] the street all them religiousness there
[1:05:34] now the whole company did not recognize
[1:05:36] him and a little woman of ill Fame she
[1:05:39] looked in through the perhaps the gate
[1:05:41] and she seen him sitting like a
[1:05:42] Wallflower that's the way he is today
[1:05:44] amongst a bunch of religionist too a
[1:05:46] Wallflower unwelcome unwanted filth
[1:05:49] dirty Holy Roller they call him some
[1:05:52] kind of a a person that is in the right
[1:05:54] mind a fortune tell or mental telepathy
[1:05:58] or some kind of an evil name but Jesus
[1:05:59] I'll get to it in a few minutes said
[1:06:01] speak a word against the son of man it
[1:06:02] shall be forgiven you but when the Holy
[1:06:04] Ghost has come to do the same thing one
[1:06:06] word will never be forgiven you but
[1:06:08] there that little woman seing needed
[1:06:10] service and she rushed in real quickly
[1:06:13] went and got an albaster box full of oil
[1:06:16] probably bought it with the money from
[1:06:18] her prostitution well what was it she
[1:06:20] might have thought he is a he is a
[1:06:22] prophet but I remember another woman in
[1:06:24] my fix or another character like mine
[1:06:27] she had the opportunity she recognized
[1:06:29] him and she was
[1:06:30] forgiven up there at the well of SAR
[1:06:33] last night we talked of it and if I can
[1:06:35] only get to him I know who he is I'll do
[1:06:38] him a service if the rest of them I
[1:06:40] don't care what they do I'll do him a
[1:06:43] service I'll recognize he's the son of
[1:06:45] God she running she got real close to
[1:06:48] him and she felt so guilty that's a way
[1:06:50] a real penitent sinner feels in his
[1:06:52] presence guilty and the tears begin to
[1:06:55] fall and she trying to hide him it
[1:06:56] dropped on his feet she was go to anoint
[1:06:57] him but the tears dropped on his feet
[1:07:00] and she began to wipe him and and crying
[1:07:02] and and with her hands and and his feet
[1:07:06] was all getting mused up with the dirt
[1:07:09] that was on it and and if you want to
[1:07:11] really believe it with the stink of the
[1:07:13] animals off the trail every one walked
[1:07:15] the same Trail and there it was the
[1:07:16] stink on him sitting there and her tears
[1:07:19] was dropped on his feet and she was
[1:07:20] trying to wipe him off and she had an
[1:07:22] old towel what is a woman's Beauty and
[1:07:25] honor is her hair that's the reason many
[1:07:28] of you women today cut it all off that's
[1:07:30] wrong she she tuck her hair and begin to
[1:07:34] wash the his feet and wipe him her the
[1:07:37] her pretty hair taking the stink off of
[1:07:40] him upon herself bearing his reproach oh
[1:07:44] my that's when you recognize who's in
[1:07:45] your presence our sisters would have to
[1:07:48] almost stand on their head to get enough
[1:07:50] hair to do that so we there she washed
[1:07:53] his feet and wiped him with the hairs of
[1:07:55] her head and she kissed his feet and
[1:07:57] there old Simon standing back there said
[1:08:01] oh I can just see him blow up he didn't
[1:08:03] recognize who he was said I told you he
[1:08:05] wasn't a prophet if he was a prophet he'
[1:08:08] recognize what kind of a woman that is
[1:08:09] around him Jesus never moved a foot he
[1:08:12] just watched her and she was scared then
[1:08:15] after he got through she doing this
[1:08:16] service to him he looked over said Simon
[1:08:21] I've got something to say to
[1:08:23] you you invite ided me here you brought
[1:08:27] me here in other words a trump up his
[1:08:29] sleeve you want to show me off you want
[1:08:32] to prove that I wasn't what I
[1:08:35] am and you when you brought me here you
[1:08:38] should have had my feet washed but you
[1:08:39] never you should give me oil to anoint
[1:08:42] my head but you didn't you never kiss me
[1:08:44] welcome and this woman ever since I've
[1:08:47] been here has washed my feet with her
[1:08:49] tears and wiped him with a with her hair
[1:08:53] and constantly has kissed my feet since
[1:08:56] I've been
[1:08:57] here I have something against you Simon
[1:09:00] then he turns to her I can just imagine
[1:09:02] seeing her stand there in her big pretty
[1:09:04] eyes all stained up in her face wor that
[1:09:06] grease and and dust off the road on her
[1:09:09] face and she thinks now have I done
[1:09:11] wrong have I done wrong he said and I
[1:09:14] say unto her her sins which are many are
[1:09:16] all forgiven amen hallelujah
[1:09:20] hallelujah God what was it she
[1:09:23] recognized she recognized her
[1:09:26] opportunity see she did it she did him a
[1:09:29] service the Pharisees didn't do it she
[1:09:32] saw it and she recognized his presence
[1:09:36] and what did it do it washed what did it
[1:09:39] release to her
[1:09:41] forgiveness released to her forgiveness
[1:09:44] of her sins what did it do also it also
[1:09:47] released the power of God to show to
[1:09:49] them unbelievers that he was a prophet
[1:09:51] he know who she was amen it also
[1:09:54] released joy and power and eternal life
[1:09:59] it released that but the one who calls a
[1:10:03] great huge nail to be droven them
[1:10:05] precious
[1:10:07] feet he never recognized the presence of
[1:10:11] God in him he also wanted to do some
[1:10:13] cheap trick for him some entertainment
[1:10:16] that's what the world wants today is a
[1:10:17] bunch of
[1:10:18] entertainment don't want the gospel they
[1:10:21] want to be
[1:10:22] entertained and S pilate said uh I'd
[1:10:25] like to desire some miracle from him or
[1:10:27] something like that bring him up here
[1:10:29] right in the presence of
[1:10:31] God and turned it down
[1:10:35] because what that he appreciated the the
[1:10:40] opinion of the public more than he
[1:10:42] appreciated having the opportunity to be
[1:10:45] in the presence of God what
[1:10:48] happened the woman was forgiven and
[1:10:50] given eternal life but he lost his mind
[1:10:53] and went insan and committed suicide
[1:10:55] by Drowning himself up in Switzerland
[1:10:59] now car so carried away with the popular
[1:11:02] opinion of that day that he was a BL
[1:11:05] just a make belief it wasn't really
[1:11:07] nothing to him he what did he do he
[1:11:09] forfeited it he fored his opportunity in
[1:11:13] the presence of God he could have been
[1:11:16] forgiven yes he said I have power to
[1:11:19] crucify you I have power to release you
[1:11:22] he said you have no powerless it comes
[1:11:24] from my father he ought to have known if
[1:11:26] he had know the scripture and him being
[1:11:28] a Jew should have known that but you see
[1:11:31] the Traditions had got him taught down
[1:11:33] that's way it is today if he had only
[1:11:35] been taught right if a man had would
[1:11:37] have believed what the scriptures had
[1:11:39] said but his tradition got him off of it
[1:11:42] same as it is today people will take the
[1:11:44] real gospel where the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:46] coming in the power and glory of God
[1:11:48] releasing sinners from sin and making
[1:11:50] them free and baptizing them in the Holy
[1:11:52] Ghost and Healing The Sick and showing
[1:11:54] signs and wonders and people walk away H
[1:11:57] you know what my church please that's
[1:11:58] nonsense see you're forfeiting you're
[1:12:01] selling your birth rights amen another
[1:12:04] Esau so many get the same opportunity
[1:12:08] today to stand in his presence as they
[1:12:10] did then and still because of popular
[1:12:13] opinion they turn it down standing in
[1:12:16] the presence of God I wonder friend
[1:12:20] tonight if we people who are Christians
[1:12:23] in his presence and are sick if we don't
[1:12:27] turn down the opportunity to be
[1:12:30] healed but just believing him will you
[1:12:33] claim to believe him don't recognize
[1:12:36] really his presence what he promised to
[1:12:38] do today Vindicated by the promise for
[1:12:41] the day Jesus was rebuking that
[1:12:44] generation for not believing his Messiah
[1:12:46] sign we see here he was rebuking him
[1:12:49] calling him a be Ela they wanted him to
[1:12:52] do the sign of Moses maybe open the Red
[1:12:54] Sea they did want him to do the sign of
[1:12:56] David take the throne in the government
[1:12:58] but the no scripture said that he would
[1:12:59] do that he was to be a
[1:13:02] prophet he's coming the kingen he was to
[1:13:06] be Prophet then and he done the sign
[1:13:08] that God said he would do in them days
[1:13:10] and they still was wanting him to do
[1:13:12] some sign that please
[1:13:14] them and I just wonder if we're not
[1:13:17] looking too farward ahead for something
[1:13:19] that's right by us wonder if it could be
[1:13:21] the same way if we could pass by our
[1:13:24] opportunity remember as the old types
[1:13:27] the types can never break the last sign
[1:13:30] According To Jesus he said as it was in
[1:13:33] the days of
[1:13:35] Sodom so shall it be in the days when
[1:13:38] the son of man not Son of God now when
[1:13:41] the son of man is being revealed look at
[1:13:45] here where it's setting today friends I
[1:13:47] could tell you some things here it's not
[1:13:49] right for me to tell you but it would
[1:13:50] startle you I want to ask you a little
[1:13:52] question while we stop before we
[1:13:54] continue on with this service just a few
[1:13:56] minutes I wonder if I could ask you this
[1:13:58] anyone knows that the world positionally
[1:14:02] everything's setting in order for his
[1:14:04] coming earthquakes in diverse places the
[1:14:07] moon spitting out red blood or red
[1:14:09] volcanic all over covering it as Jesus
[1:14:11] said watch for that sign in the last
[1:14:13] days see a roar man's heart failing for
[1:14:16] fear and perplexed of time distress
[1:14:18] between the Nations look at the
[1:14:20] perversion on the move today look at it
[1:14:24] a far 30% increase in California of
[1:14:28] homosexuals natural affections already
[1:14:42] lost amen amen if the musician could
[1:14:48] come and what a sobering thought then am
[1:14:53] is right by yes and we don't see it
[1:14:57] because the expectation is different
[1:15:00] because they're not looking for him
[1:15:03] according to the promise that he's made
[1:15:07] you know I love it how that he starts in
[1:15:09] from the beginning it will even tell you
[1:15:11] how even those that were the very
[1:15:14] elected one they missed
[1:15:18] it but the word always comes to the
[1:15:21] prophet so if you want to that's why
[1:15:23] when they ask Jesus a question he send
[1:15:26] them back to John he said go tell John
[1:15:29] all that you saw and everything and then
[1:15:32] come back with the conclusion why but
[1:15:34] bam says the word always comes to the
[1:15:37] prophet first if you want to know what
[1:15:39] God wants for your life what God wants
[1:15:42] to do what's happening in your time
[1:15:44] consult the prophet of your day because
[1:15:47] that's God's way of doing things and I
[1:15:49] love this when he said that the word
[1:15:51] always comes to the prophet and not only
[1:15:54] that that he only comes to those that
[1:15:58] are looking for
[1:16:00] him that's why we we we just can't play
[1:16:03] church we just can't come and and just
[1:16:05] say it's another Wednesday but is our
[1:16:08] heart beating for something are we
[1:16:10] looking are we in expectation to see God
[1:16:13] do something in our lives are we in
[1:16:15] expectation to see the promises that
[1:16:17] we've been made the promise of the
[1:16:19] Rapture remember he just said here not
[1:16:21] long ago he said there'll be those that
[1:16:24] are going to miss it they will come to
[1:16:26] church thinking they're being saved
[1:16:27] thinking everything is going on because
[1:16:29] it would happen and they wouldn't even
[1:16:32] know it why because they didn't
[1:16:35] understand what the coming was all about
[1:16:37] they didn't understand what the promise
[1:16:39] of their time was and they failed to
[1:16:42] realize because they failed to realize
[1:16:44] then when the promise is made known they
[1:16:47] couldn't see the Promise
[1:16:48] coming but those that were under the
[1:16:51] expectation those that received the
[1:16:53] whole word of God
[1:16:55] says it brought healing it brought
[1:16:57] Deliverance it brought peace it brought
[1:17:00] everything that we have need of if we
[1:17:03] can only receive him and the promise
[1:17:06] that he's made us he promised to give us
[1:17:09] everything that we have need of Amen

[1:24:28] do when we go in his name and so I just

[1:24:32] with the man on the job uh just before I
[1:24:34] came to church today you know it's been
[1:24:37] told us that if you would give someone

[1:24:43] something that can be reckoned to them
[1:24:45] what about a presence that is in each
[1:24:47] one of us we don't want to let that go
[1:24:49] unrecognized in our lives in our
[1:24:51] difficulties in the different things
