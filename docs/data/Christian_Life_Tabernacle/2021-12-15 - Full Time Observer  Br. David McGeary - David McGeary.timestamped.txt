[34:26] i believe
[34:32] [Music]
[34:43] amen
[34:45] lord certainly
[34:48] we could use a great
[34:51] stirring and revelation of that very
[34:54] fact that you're all
[34:56] that we have need of
[35:00] because father we have a promise that we
[35:02] would never bake bread
[35:04] that you would never leave us nor
[35:06] forsake us
[35:08] that you are jehovah jirei that you
[35:10] provide for us
[35:13] lord we ask you that
[35:16] forgive us our unbelief father
[35:20] strengthen our faith
[35:23] that we may please you
[35:25] for without faith it's impossible to
[35:28] please you
[35:29] for we must believe that you are
[35:33] and a rewarder of them that diligently
[35:36] seek you
[35:38] so father we seek you tonight
[35:40] knowing that you'll keep your word we
[35:43] ask you to bless each of those that have
[35:45] come out tonight
[35:46] for this time of fellowship we're very
[35:49] thankful in jesus name we pray
[35:52] amen amen god bless you tonight if you
[35:56] have your bibles let's turn over to
[36:00] matthew the third chapter
[36:02] and we want to read a little portion and
[36:05] read some statements tonight on our
[36:08] just fellowshipping out of the message
[36:11] god's provided place of worship so
[36:14] mike and ellen are here with us let's do
[36:16] all that we can to keep them here
[36:20] and uh maybe we could rent them a little
[36:21] cottage they could spend
[36:23] some time over here with us but
[36:26] amen we're certainly glad to have him
[36:29] a lot of the reason that we're in the
[36:31] building we are in is because of brother
[36:34] mike and his
[36:36] diligence helping us get this building
[36:39] built so we're always eternally grateful
[36:41] for that
[36:43] if i was to title my
[36:46] message tonight
[36:48] i want to call it the full-time observer
[36:53] the full-time observer
[36:55] and uh
[36:56] i i thought that the
[37:01] story
[37:02] in
[37:03] matthew
[37:04] was a pretty good
[37:07] example of it i've been doing a little
[37:10] study on the
[37:11] life of john the baptist and
[37:14] one of the things that came to
[37:17] my uh
[37:21] remembrance or knowledge was that john
[37:24] had followers
[37:26] and these followers were scattered about
[37:29] everywhere but let's just
[37:32] read this little story here i think it's
[37:34] a great
[37:35] bible story
[37:37] and in those days came john the baptist
[37:40] preaching in the wilderness of judea
[37:45] and saying repent ye
[37:48] for the kingdom of god
[37:50] is at hand
[37:52] for this is he
[37:54] that was spoken of
[37:57] by the prophet isaiah saying
[38:00] the voice of one crying in the
[38:02] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[38:06] lord
[38:07] making his path straight now this was a
[38:11] scripture
[38:12] being fulfilled
[38:14] right in their midst
[38:17] and it said
[38:19] and
[38:20] and it
[38:21] and the same john
[38:24] had his reignment of camel's hair
[38:27] and of leather and girded about his
[38:30] loins
[38:31] and his meat was locus and wild honey
[38:36] and
[38:37] then
[38:38] went out to him
[38:40] jerusalem
[38:42] and all of judea
[38:44] and all the regions round about jordan
[38:48] and another thing about john's ministry
[38:51] is they came to where he was
[38:54] he didn't go around he stayed in this
[38:56] one place
[38:58] preaching and baptizing and they came
[39:01] out from all the regions to him
[39:04] and were baptized of him
[39:07] in jordan confessing their sins
[39:11] but when he saw many of the pharisees
[39:15] and sadducees come
[39:17] to his baptism
[39:20] he said unto them o generation of vipers
[39:24] who hath warned you to flee
[39:27] from the wrath to come
[39:29] bring forth therefore fruit meant for
[39:31] repentance
[39:33] and think not to say within yourselves
[39:37] we have abraham our fathers for i say
[39:40] unto you that god
[39:42] is able of these stones to raise up
[39:45] children unto abraham
[39:47] and now also the axe is laid to the root
[39:51] of the tree therefore every tree which
[39:54] bringeth
[39:55] not forth good fruit is hewed down and
[39:59] cast into the fire i indeed baptize you
[40:02] with water unto repentance
[40:05] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[40:08] than i
[40:09] whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he
[40:12] shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[40:16] and with fire god bless you lord add his
[40:19] blessings to his word you may be seated
[40:26] i think that you see
[40:28] here
[40:30] two groups
[40:31] that showed up
[40:34] one group was full-time
[40:36] observers and the people that weren't
[40:39] observers were those that were baptized
[40:43] of john
[40:44] but those that came to observe the
[40:46] scripture simply said that they came to
[40:49] his
[40:50] baptisms so
[40:52] you can just picture the
[40:55] setting
[40:56] there they were sitting there they were
[40:58] listening to john preach
[41:01] john
[41:03] wasn't
[41:05] one that you might say was afraid to
[41:07] speak what the lord told them to speak
[41:10] he called it out just like it was he was
[41:14] in a politician his purpose was was to
[41:17] make straight
[41:19] the way
[41:20] or in other words to leave no doubt in
[41:23] which path
[41:25] that a person has to take
[41:28] and what he preached was repentance of
[41:31] sin
[41:32] and that was what his message was that
[41:35] there's one coming who is greater than i
[41:38] so repent of your sins you notice that
[41:42] the formula didn't change
[41:45] that even when it was said those who
[41:48] repent of their sins men and brethren
[41:50] what shall we do repent
[41:53] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[41:56] christ and you shall receive the gift of
[41:59] the holy ghost
[42:00] so it just showed that that john's
[42:04] gospel
[42:05] was in the will and the plan of god
[42:09] and along with it there was observers
[42:13] now
[42:14] an observer is a person who follows the
[42:19] events
[42:21] so the opposite of an observer is a
[42:24] participant
[42:27] many of us
[42:29] people who enjoy sports or
[42:32] enjoy
[42:33] things
[42:34] i have a great love for the symphony
[42:38] not that i can play an instrument or not
[42:41] that i know a a from a b or or anything
[42:45] but
[42:46] i i enjoy observing
[42:49] i i look out and i watch the string
[42:52] section you know and i i love it when
[42:54] the violins will go
[42:56] you know and and they're all moving
[42:58] their hands together you know and then
[43:01] you'll look over and
[43:03] they're playing the base and and you'll
[43:06] notice that four five seven eight groups
[43:08] of them all are kind of doing the same
[43:11] thing when their part comes and and so i
[43:14] i'm an observer
[43:16] and as an observer
[43:18] i
[43:19] participate
[43:20] in the music and in the spirit but i'm
[43:24] an observer and not a participant
[43:28] and so we found out there was a group of
[43:30] people
[43:31] that were observers
[43:34] and i i think it's a a wonderful
[43:38] but
[43:39] we don't want to be observers
[43:42] because that's not the place
[43:46] that we want to be in
[43:48] and if you go let's just turn in our
[43:51] scripture as we
[43:53] we uh
[43:56] to
[43:59] acts uh
[44:01] 19
[44:02] and uh we just read this spot
[44:05] found here in in acts 19 uh
[44:10] and it it's a it's kind of a great
[44:13] uh
[44:14] place in the scripture because it it
[44:17] it's such a uh it it fortifies so much
[44:23] of john's ministry
[44:25] and the difference between the observer
[44:28] and the
[44:32] and the participant
[44:34] so you have to understand when they came
[44:36] out to see john
[44:38] there were those that heard his message
[44:41] and what did they do
[44:43] they repented
[44:44] and were baptized
[44:46] so
[44:47] they they were participating so the the
[44:51] very sign
[44:53] that they received the message
[44:56] was their participation in what john's
[45:00] message called for
[45:03] so the observer came out too
[45:24] have you heard what i've been preaching
[45:27] and you've come out to acknowledge it
[45:29] and to accept it will you two also be
[45:34] baptized uh
[45:36] in in in
[45:38] acknowledgement
[45:40] that what i'm saying is the truth
[45:44] but they were followers of the event
[45:48] so we want to draw a clear picture
[45:51] of the difference between
[45:54] an observer and a
[45:57] participator because we're talking about
[46:00] this provided place of worship
[46:04] and so those that went out to see john
[46:09] that weren't just observers
[46:12] they found the place
[46:15] of his message
[46:16] what his message was calling for they
[46:19] were convicted in their heart and their
[46:22] spirit the words that he spoke they
[46:26] they uh they
[46:28] they moved them
[46:32] you know
[46:33] they come under the influence of it
[46:36] and we're moved by it
[46:38] now without being moved by it without it
[46:42] having an effect on it the effect that
[46:46] it had on them
[46:49] is what made them participants
[46:56] you know they i i read an article i've
[47:00] read and studied
[47:02] a lot about
[47:04] the effects
[47:05] of the media and
[47:08] television
[47:09] and movies
[47:11] on
[47:12] the emotional effect
[47:14] that they have
[47:16] on uh society
[47:19] and there became a great time in this
[47:22] period of this country where
[47:25] uh
[47:26] the people that are attracted
[47:28] to what they call horror movies you know
[47:31] scary movies are usually uh teenagers
[47:36] and
[47:37] a tremendous effect on teenage girls
[47:41] between the ages of 13 and i think it's
[47:44] like 17
[47:46] or 18
[47:48] and uh
[47:50] and they make these movies and they go
[47:52] there and they enjoy this uh of fear
[47:56] and what happens is is they get sucked
[47:58] in
[47:59] and participating
[48:02] in the emotion and fear
[48:05] that's going on and it's all imaginary
[48:12] i mean you're sitting in a safe place
[48:18] you know what i mean there's
[48:20] there's no such thing
[48:23] as what's being
[48:24] presented the blob or the tingler
[48:27] or to any of those things
[48:30] you know what i mean the giant ant or
[48:33] the thing or or whatever there's none of
[48:36] you old enough in here to know the
[48:38] tingling
[48:39] or the blob
[48:41] but anyway
[48:43] but you you understand they they get
[48:45] they get caught up in it and they they
[48:50] participate in it
[48:52] and what it's prepping them for
[48:55] is to accept things based on emotion
[49:01] and not the
[49:02] not the ability to accept
[49:06] and and analyze the reality of what's
[49:11] transpiring
[49:14] and so it can then it make the articles
[49:17] go on and the study goes on
[49:19] to see what the acceptance is
[49:23] of
[49:24] violence
[49:26] and the acceptance of
[49:28] of the mistreatment of their fellow man
[49:32] because they've been conditioned by
[49:35] these emotions that normally you would
[49:38] be horrified to see some evil come upon
[49:42] somebody but now
[49:44] if someone falls or someone gets
[49:48] in an accident or somebody
[49:51] some misfortune
[49:53] befalls somebody their numbness to it
[49:56] has been there they've been numb to such
[49:59] things because they've seen such hideous
[50:02] things
[50:03] and they felt such hideous emotions that
[50:06] it's it's not as moving to them
[50:09] and therefore
[50:11] it affects in the long run their
[50:13] affection and their ability to love and
[50:16] their ability to be warm and and those
[50:19] things and you say well why do you say
[50:21] that because we just listened to it
[50:24] where the prophet of god said all these
[50:26] hideous things that they are seeing are
[50:28] going to visit them again
[50:30] and they're they're going to imagine
[50:32] these things actually
[50:34] happening so if we see this great
[50:37] difference between the participant so
[50:40] those that received john's message and
[50:43] participated in it
[50:45] they were
[50:46] baptized by john so let's read here in
[50:50] the
[50:51] in acts
[50:52] and
[50:54] 19
[50:55] and we're going to find another group of
[50:58] participants
[51:01] okay
[51:02] and it came to pass
[51:04] that while apollos was in corinth
[51:07] paul having passed through
[51:09] the upper coast
[51:11] came to ephesus
[51:13] and finding certain disciples
[51:17] and he said unto them
[51:20] have ye received the holy ghost since ye
[51:24] believed
[51:25] and they said unto him we have not
[51:29] so much as heard
[51:31] whether there be any holy ghost
[51:35] and he said unto them unto what then
[51:38] were ye baptized
[51:41] and they said
[51:42] un to john's baptism
[51:46] so we find out here's people that were
[51:48] baptized by john
[51:51] and because they weren't observers
[51:54] but they were participants paul finds
[51:57] them in the upper coast
[52:00] of ephesus
[52:01] and finds that their disciples
[52:05] still
[52:07] following
[52:08] what
[52:09] john said and participating
[52:12] in what john said
[52:14] now because they weren't
[52:16] observers
[52:18] but they were
[52:20] they were participants
[52:23] we find that
[52:25] the spirit of god and the word of god
[52:28] finds them
[52:31] because they're involved in something
[52:34] they're participating in something
[52:36] they've received the message of john
[52:40] and the message was
[52:42] john was follow him that's to come after
[52:45] me because he's going to baptize you
[52:47] with fire
[52:49] so now paul comes along and says to him
[52:51] he says have you received the holy ghost
[52:54] he said we didn't know there were such
[52:55] things i would have liked to have been
[52:58] there for that teaching of paul to them
[53:05] as he told them about the that of i can
[53:08] just imagine him telling them their
[53:10] testimony how he got struck down on the
[53:13] road to the mathematician and how
[53:16] ananias came from him and prayed for him
[53:19] and he received his sight and he
[53:20] received the holy ghost
[53:22] and how the lord spoke to him
[53:25] so here they were
[53:27] participating
[53:29] in what john preached still
[53:33] and because they were participants
[53:36] and not observers i'm telling you a lot
[53:39] of people drop into the
[53:42] observation mode
[53:46] they quit being participants but these
[53:49] disciples remained
[53:53] participants
[53:54] and the promise of god found them
[53:58] and then paul
[54:00] they said
[54:02] paul said
[54:03] to them
[54:06] john barely baptized with the baptism of
[54:09] repentance
[54:11] saying unto the people
[54:13] that they should believe on him what
[54:16] should come after him
[54:18] that is on jesus christ and when they
[54:21] heard this they were baptized
[54:24] in the name of the lord jesus
[54:27] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[54:30] them the holy ghost came
[54:34] on them and they spake with tongues and
[54:37] prophesied and all the men were about
[54:41] 12.
[54:43] so i don't know how many sisters were
[54:45] there
[54:46] and children were there but there was 12
[54:49] good strong men to start the church
[54:53] of ephesus
[54:55] with
[54:56] so we're talking about
[54:58] this
[55:00] place
[55:01] this provided place of worship
[55:05] and we want to talk about this place
[55:07] because we want to approach this place
[55:10] from either the standpoint of an
[55:12] observer
[55:14] or a participant all right now i don't
[55:17] want to be a
[55:18] full-time observer
[55:24] you know what i mean
[55:26] i want to be a
[55:29] i want to be
[55:32] led if i could say
[55:34] uh
[55:35] or another word might be as as john
[55:39] preached his message every repentance i
[55:42] want to be convicted
[55:46] into action
[55:48] i want to be convicted in from moving
[55:52] from an observer
[55:54] to a participant
[55:56] we come as observers
[55:58] but i don't want to remain a full-time
[56:01] observer
[56:02] i want something to prick my heart
[56:06] i want something to give me isab that i
[56:09] might see i want to have something
[56:12] happen to me that's going to cry out in
[56:16] my spirit
[56:19] excuse me what must i do
[56:22] or let's put it this way what can i do
[56:27] lord i want to participate
[56:30] what works would you have me to do what
[56:34] what prayers would you have me say what
[56:37] burdens would you want me to take upon
[56:40] my heart
[56:41] so an observer he can talk about
[56:44] something
[56:47] some of the greatest sports people have
[56:50] never played the game
[56:55] what do they call them commentators
[56:59] they have their opinion about this and
[57:01] their opinion about that we have a lot
[57:04] of political
[57:05] commentators and observers who have
[57:08] never run for office they've never
[57:11] participated but they've got a mountain
[57:13] of words
[57:15] at a mountain of observation and they
[57:18] can become
[57:20] almost a
[57:21] a
[57:22] a professional
[57:26] or someone that has i'm looking for the
[57:28] word
[57:29] uh for in my vocabulary but someone
[57:33] who's an expert
[57:35] on something that they've never done
[57:40] have you ever watched a cooking show
[57:44] well it's like walking watching cooking
[57:47] shows
[57:49] and
[57:50] you know when they you mix the butter
[57:52] and you do this and you preheat the oven
[57:56] and you chop this up and you just take a
[58:00] pinch of this and
[58:01] you know bam and all this stuff
[58:04] and
[58:06] are you all watching the cooking shows
[58:12] but you've never cooked it in your life
[58:15] you can talk about it
[58:17] you've become an expert
[58:19] on cooking
[58:23] you know
[58:24] so
[58:25] we've got and
[58:27] we've got to understand
[58:28] that
[58:29] in order to enter into this god's
[58:33] provided place
[58:35] you can only enter in
[58:37] as a participant
[58:39] not of an observer
[58:42] that's what the lady will see as
[58:43] churches behold i stand at the door and
[58:46] knock
[58:48] and that would be like someone sitting
[58:50] there there's somebody knocking at the
[58:52] door jesus is knocking at the door
[58:55] and they can tell you all about what
[58:57] jesus is but they never open the door
[59:01] that he can come in and sup with them
[59:04] and make them a participant
[59:07] in what he's doing
[59:10] so
[59:11] if if we find this place
[59:14] if
[59:16] if it is a place
[59:20] then it can be found
[59:23] so if god has provided a place of
[59:27] worship
[59:29] so he's provided a place and it's the
[59:32] only place that he'll receive worship
[59:37] now he's not going to receive worship
[59:41] from an observer
[59:44] the worship comes
[59:46] by the participation
[59:49] if you love me keep my commandments
[59:53] so remember the observer he knows it's
[59:57] there
[1:00:01] but he's an observer of it
[1:00:04] but he's never brought himself into
[1:00:08] the act of participation
[1:00:12] and so you can have fellowship in
[1:00:15] observation
[1:00:21] we we can all have fellowship
[1:00:25] observing
[1:00:26] the message that has come
[1:00:32] you understand the message has come
[1:00:35] it's not going to be
[1:00:37] added to
[1:00:39] and it's not going to be taken from
[1:00:44] it'll be disbelieved
[1:00:47] and most people that disbelieve it
[1:00:50] are because they observed
[1:00:54] and they were observers
[1:00:57] and the more they observed the more they
[1:00:59] looked and the more it was easy to find
[1:01:03] fault
[1:01:05] but if they were participating
[1:01:09] and they were
[1:01:10] participating in what that it spoke of
[1:01:14] the people that were baptized by john
[1:01:18] for the remission of their sins they had
[1:01:21] something that could never be taken from
[1:01:23] them
[1:01:24] because they didn't stand on the bank
[1:01:29] telling everything that john did
[1:01:32] telling stories about the people that
[1:01:35] came down to the water but never coming
[1:01:38] into the water themselves
[1:01:41] so you can be a full-time observer and
[1:01:45] be in fellowship
[1:01:50] right
[1:01:51] but
[1:01:52] you've got to examine
[1:01:54] your own self
[1:01:57] by way of participation
[1:02:01] and uh
[1:02:02] so if it's a place it can be found
[1:02:07] and there's it'll have landmarks
[1:02:10] john's was baptizing in the wilderness
[1:02:13] on the river jordan
[1:02:15] it was a place that could be found it
[1:02:18] had landmarks and so it has landmarks or
[1:02:22] in other words it has identifying
[1:02:24] characteristics
[1:02:28] wherever two or three are gathered in
[1:02:31] my name there i will be
[1:02:34] so there's landmarks there's there's
[1:02:37] grace it'll have
[1:02:39] identifiable
[1:02:40] activity
[1:02:43] so there's certain things that are going
[1:02:45] to go on in this place
[1:02:49] so that you know it's the place
[1:02:53] so it can be found now we've already
[1:02:56] know that the place is jesus christ
[1:03:00] but it's not jesus christ 2000 years ago
[1:03:10] there's a monument to george washington
[1:03:14] but george washington isn't there
[1:03:19] now we can have a monument
[1:03:22] to jesus
[1:03:24] but jesus isn't there and we know he's
[1:03:27] not there because he's risen from the
[1:03:30] dead
[1:03:32] so if he was the place of worship
[1:03:36] he didn't stay still
[1:03:41] you understand he moved through the
[1:03:43] church ages
[1:03:48] and people could find him in every age
[1:03:52] he was able to be found
[1:03:56] but men were observers
[1:04:00] and being observers they built
[1:04:04] monuments to what they observed
[1:04:10] but they remained observers
[1:04:13] and they built their monuments
[1:04:16] and their doctrines and their creeds
[1:04:18] based upon
[1:04:20] their observation
[1:04:23] but if they would have been
[1:04:25] participants
[1:04:27] they would have had a complete different
[1:04:29] viewpoint
[1:04:36] i mean the person that standing in the
[1:04:39] batter's box
[1:04:41] and having that pitcher throw the ball
[1:04:44] at him at 105 miles an hour has a whole
[1:04:48] lot of different perspective of the
[1:04:50] person sitting in the stands
[1:04:55] i've sat in the stands and heard that
[1:04:58] ball whistle
[1:05:01] and 90 feet isn't very far at all
[1:05:07] it's like
[1:05:08] close
[1:05:12] and i don't know who can do the math
[1:05:15] but 105 miles an hour 90 feet goes by in
[1:05:18] about two seconds
[1:05:24] and it's a great observer but when that
[1:05:26] great big uh
[1:05:29] linebacker
[1:05:30] smacks into that guy and slams him onto
[1:05:34] the ground oh
[1:05:36] the participant
[1:05:38] has a different viewpoint
[1:05:41] than the observer
[1:05:44] he knows what's transpiring in the
[1:05:47] experience
[1:05:49] so he understands the place
[1:05:53] he understands the activity
[1:05:57] he knows what the landmarks are
[1:06:01] you know one of the landmark for a
[1:06:03] believer right is the fiery darts of the
[1:06:05] enemy
[1:06:07] amen you know you're in that place when
[1:06:10] the devil's shooting arrows at you
[1:06:13] you know you're in that place when all
[1:06:15] men don't speak well of you
[1:06:19] you know you you you know you're in that
[1:06:22] place
[1:06:27] you know here in that place when you
[1:06:29] need
[1:06:29] character
[1:06:31] gold tried in fire
[1:06:33] so there's there's landmarks with that
[1:06:35] place but there's also activity
[1:06:38] in that place so let's turn to saint
[1:06:40] john the 14th chapter and
[1:06:43] and uh the 12th verse
[1:06:49] we just want to talk now just a little
[1:06:51] bit
[1:06:52] about
[1:06:53] the activity
[1:06:55] in the place
[1:06:59] so if you find the place
[1:07:01] there's going to be an activity that
[1:07:04] participates in that place
[1:07:09] every
[1:07:10] game
[1:07:11] has
[1:07:13] rules i liked as a kid in my family
[1:07:16] we would play basketball or play a game
[1:07:20] but as we go along the rules would
[1:07:22] change
[1:07:24] we would add a rule
[1:07:27] or we'd take a rule away or we'd
[1:07:29] interpret it
[1:07:31] and something like that we used to play
[1:07:33] pick up basketball at in pickup
[1:07:36] basketball you could call a foul
[1:07:39] so if a guy missed a shot he would claim
[1:07:42] foul
[1:07:43] and he'd get the ball so that guy called
[1:07:45] foul to her three times me wait me nick
[1:07:47] we made up a brand new rule only two
[1:07:50] fouls you can only call two thousand
[1:07:56] you make up rules as you go
[1:07:58] and but this identified place
[1:08:03] you understand
[1:08:05] doesn't have
[1:08:07] changing rules
[1:08:11] because it's a provided place
[1:08:15] so the participant
[1:08:18] is moved upon
[1:08:20] and enters into the
[1:08:22] commandments of that place so let's just
[1:08:26] read
[1:08:27] as we're just doing this little bible
[1:08:28] study tonight
[1:08:31] saint john 14 i always loved the first
[1:08:34] verse
[1:08:35] let not your hearts be troubled if you
[1:08:38] believe in god believe also in me
[1:08:42] and then he goes over here in the 12th
[1:08:44] verse it says verily verily
[1:08:47] i say unto you
[1:08:48] he that believeth on me
[1:08:56] the works
[1:08:58] that i do
[1:08:59] shall
[1:09:01] he do also
[1:09:03] and even greater works than these shall
[1:09:07] he do because i go unto my father
[1:09:12] now so now we know now that there is a
[1:09:16] description
[1:09:18] of the participant
[1:09:24] what if the people that believed john's
[1:09:27] message what did they do
[1:09:29] they were baptized
[1:09:32] they entered in to the activity
[1:09:37] that was described
[1:09:40] by john receiving john's message
[1:09:46] so now jesus says if you believe on me
[1:09:51] i am going to describe to you
[1:09:54] the activity that follows
[1:09:57] your belief
[1:10:02] that's ready that's what he said
[1:10:05] the works that i do you shall do alls if
[1:10:08] you believe on me
[1:10:10] if you hear my message
[1:10:12] if you hear what i'm saying
[1:10:15] if you receive the baptism in which i
[1:10:17] baptize
[1:10:19] you shall do these works also and
[1:10:21] greater works than shall you do more
[1:10:24] because i go to my father
[1:10:26] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[1:10:31] that
[1:10:32] will i do
[1:10:34] that the father me may be glorified in
[1:10:38] the son
[1:10:39] if ye shall ask anything in
[1:10:43] my name
[1:10:45] i will do it
[1:10:47] another description
[1:10:49] of a participant
[1:10:53] now
[1:10:54] the scripture said as the disciples went
[1:10:57] out and teaching in and paul and james
[1:11:00] and them they they had something they
[1:11:02] said they said you have not because you
[1:11:06] ask not right
[1:11:08] in other words you are not participating
[1:11:12] you're observing but you're not
[1:11:14] participating
[1:11:16] so personally there's fellowship
[1:11:19] in observation
[1:11:22] but if you're a participant
[1:11:25] you're going to ask
[1:11:29] and he will do
[1:11:32] if you're a participant there are works
[1:11:36] and greater works
[1:11:37] that follow you
[1:11:39] so there's got to there's a line
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:43] allows us to understand if we found that
[1:11:47] place
[1:11:48] because he said in that place
[1:11:51] there will be people that are asking and
[1:11:55] receiving
[1:11:57] so i know i found the place when i come
[1:12:01] to a place wherever two or three are
[1:12:03] there are gathered and he is in their
[1:12:06] midst and they're asking him and
[1:12:09] receiving
[1:12:12] we don't need to observe the history
[1:12:18] of the lord jesus
[1:12:21] and observe the history
[1:12:24] of this message
[1:12:26] we need to be participants
[1:12:29] in its
[1:12:30] identifying activity
[1:12:35] and its landmarks
[1:12:38] and so we we go on to read
[1:12:41] as he said
[1:12:43] if ye love me keep my commandments
[1:12:46] so there's rules
[1:12:50] and i don't want to call them laws
[1:12:54] but
[1:12:55] there
[1:12:56] there is
[1:13:00] uh
[1:13:02] there's guidelines and there's
[1:13:05] there's
[1:13:06] uh
[1:13:07] things that the believer does that
[1:13:10] allows him to stay in that place
[1:13:14] so i would say this that a place has
[1:13:18] boundaries
[1:13:22] that's what makes a country a country
[1:13:25] is its borders
[1:13:27] well the borders of the place
[1:13:30] is its commandments that's its border
[1:13:33] lines when you cross those commandments
[1:13:36] you've stepped out of the activity
[1:13:42] and out of the place
[1:13:45] that things happen
[1:13:48] though this place has boundaries
[1:13:51] it's not a freelance thing
[1:13:54] it's not something that can be adjusted
[1:13:57] and moved and and then it's a set
[1:14:02] dimension
[1:14:03] it's a place it's got boundaries and the
[1:14:06] boundaries are the commandments and the
[1:14:09] spirit that runs this place and the
[1:14:12] spirit that exists in this place is love
[1:14:18] that's a capstone
[1:14:20] of this place is the love of god shed
[1:14:23] abroad in your heart by the holy spirit
[1:14:26] it's done by love
[1:14:28] and he said if you love me you keep my
[1:14:30] commandments and i will pray the father
[1:14:33] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:14:37] that he may abide with you
[1:14:40] forever even the spirit of truth
[1:14:46] whom the world cannot receive
[1:14:49] because it seeth him not
[1:14:52] neither knoweth him
[1:14:54] but ye know him
[1:14:58] for he dwelleth with you
[1:15:01] and shall
[1:15:02] be
[1:15:04] in you
[1:15:06] so this beautiful
[1:15:08] place that we found to be the lord jesus
[1:15:13] is not a place that can't be found
[1:15:16] it's not a place that doesn't have
[1:15:18] borders
[1:15:21] it's a real
[1:15:22] place it's a real existence
[1:15:26] and it has identifying characteristics
[1:15:29] and landmarks that tell it's a place
[1:15:33] peace that's her bath is understanding
[1:15:35] joy
[1:15:36] unspeakable rest
[1:15:39] come unto me all year heavily laden i'll
[1:15:42] give rest it's got landmark
[1:15:44] identifications
[1:15:46] and it's got
[1:15:48] it's got identifiable
[1:15:50] activities
[1:15:52] they shall lay their hands on the sick
[1:15:55] and they shall recover they shall cast
[1:15:57] out devils they shall comfort one
[1:15:59] another
[1:16:01] they'll visit the widow and the
[1:16:02] fatherless in their reflection
[1:16:05] of the afflictions
[1:16:08] there's so many
[1:16:10] identifying activities
[1:16:14] that separate the observer
[1:16:17] from the participant very
[1:16:20] now let's just read in closing
[1:16:23] a few statements
[1:16:25] out of god's provided place
[1:16:28] of worship
[1:16:30] and we'll start over
[1:16:32] if the brothers want to put it up at
[1:16:34] paragraph
[1:16:35] 106 and we're just going to read a few
[1:16:39] uh
[1:16:40] um
[1:16:45] statements that allow us to understand
[1:16:49] that there is a provided place
[1:16:53] for every age
[1:16:57] in luther's age there was a provided
[1:16:59] place
[1:17:02] of justification i've been to the walls
[1:17:04] of the reformer and i've been over to
[1:17:06] the church and
[1:17:08] and i saw those great man there that
[1:17:11] were preaching reformation but coming
[1:17:14] out of the catholic church the
[1:17:16] justification
[1:17:18] by calvary and the grace of god and the
[1:17:22] no longer the need to buy penance
[1:17:26] that was a great stand that those men
[1:17:28] took
[1:17:29] and their gospel still stands today
[1:17:33] the thing was is that the lord moved on
[1:17:38] so when they don't move with the lord
[1:17:43] they set up camp on their observations
[1:17:47] and now they stick to what they've
[1:17:50] observed
[1:17:54] it's like an observatory
[1:17:58] the lutheran church is an observatory to
[1:18:01] the reformers
[1:18:04] but the lord's moved on because there's
[1:18:07] activity
[1:18:09] going on
[1:18:10] with the participant
[1:18:12] and there's boundaries and there's
[1:18:15] landmarks
[1:18:17] i hope that my words are
[1:18:20] capable of expressing that
[1:18:23] paragraph 106.
[1:18:26] now we find out
[1:18:28] that when we start with christ
[1:18:31] we grow
[1:18:33] the same way
[1:18:35] because we grow in grace and in
[1:18:38] admonition
[1:18:40] of god
[1:18:42] so what is one of the characteristics is
[1:18:45] growth
[1:18:49] so
[1:18:50] if you're not growing you've done what
[1:18:54] you've reached the top of your potential
[1:18:57] i am not going to grow any
[1:18:59] higher
[1:19:01] i may grow out
[1:19:05] but i'm not going to grow up
[1:19:09] well i don't want to be that as a
[1:19:10] christian
[1:19:12] i want higher ground don't you
[1:19:15] so it says here
[1:19:16] so
[1:19:18] god's only provided plan
[1:19:21] for any age
[1:19:23] is his word
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] so for any age it's his word
[1:19:30] that's the provided plan for every age
[1:19:34] but it's like in every age how come
[1:19:37] luther didn't see the baptism of the
[1:19:39] holy ghost
[1:19:42] it's hard to believe
[1:19:46] because he was led just that far
[1:19:51] so every ages is his word
[1:19:54] his son came and manifested every
[1:19:57] promise
[1:19:59] that was promised for his age
[1:20:02] all the prophets came in just exactly on
[1:20:07] time
[1:20:08] they was god's word living on earth
[1:20:11] they was the word jesus said that they
[1:20:15] were gods jesus called the prophet's
[1:20:18] gods
[1:20:20] and so let's just turn
[1:20:22] or you won't have to turn go to
[1:20:24] paragraph
[1:20:26] 110.
[1:20:29] it says we find
[1:20:31] that in each age
[1:20:33] when god said a
[1:20:35] a certain thing would happen
[1:20:38] here comes that man along that manifest
[1:20:43] that
[1:20:44] here come their people along and live
[1:20:48] that
[1:20:51] so every age that god every time god
[1:20:54] moves there's somebody that's going to
[1:20:56] manifest that place
[1:21:00] that the people can live it
[1:21:05] because the people that are in that
[1:21:07] place are active
[1:21:09] they're not observers
[1:21:12] many people looked at this message
[1:21:15] they believed brother branham was a
[1:21:16] prophet and they they speak of their
[1:21:20] observation of his ministry
[1:21:26] but that's one thing totally different
[1:21:30] than those that received what he was
[1:21:32] saying
[1:21:34] because what he was saying was there was
[1:21:36] going to be a people that received that
[1:21:39] spirit and we're going to do the same
[1:21:42] works that he did with the same motive
[1:21:45] the same objective and the same love
[1:21:49] not of manifest power
[1:21:51] but to manifest compassion and sympathy
[1:21:55] and defiance
[1:21:57] of the devil
[1:22:01] claiming
[1:22:03] those that are in the bondage to the
[1:22:05] enemy claiming them and fighting a
[1:22:08] battle for them to bring them into the
[1:22:10] presence of a savior and a delivering
[1:22:13] god
[1:22:17] he said manifest that and here come
[1:22:20] their people along and live that that
[1:22:24] was god himself living in the people
[1:22:28] because it was an answer of his word
[1:22:35] you can
[1:22:36] talk about
[1:22:38] the messenger
[1:22:40] you can talk about
[1:22:43] all that he did
[1:22:46] all the works he did all the vindication
[1:22:49] he had
[1:22:51] but that was not his message
[1:22:55] his message was the same god that you
[1:22:58] saw on display is the same god that can
[1:23:02] live in you
[1:23:03] and if he lives in you
[1:23:06] the love of god will be shed abroad in
[1:23:10] your heart by the holy spirit and you
[1:23:13] will be motivated
[1:23:16] to do the works by the motivation and
[1:23:19] compassion that he did the works by
[1:23:24] therefore it becomes a manifestation of
[1:23:27] him
[1:23:28] not a proof
[1:23:30] of your observation
[1:23:33] but a life
[1:23:34] of participation
[1:23:37] you've heard the message and you're
[1:23:40] participating in it because you
[1:23:42] understood what the message was john's
[1:23:46] believers understood
[1:23:48] what john was saying the messiah is
[1:23:51] coming
[1:23:53] get your life right
[1:23:55] so that you can receive them
[1:23:58] when he comes
[1:24:01] that was his message
[1:24:04] those that heard it gladly went into the
[1:24:07] water
[1:24:08] and did the works
[1:24:10] those that really and gladly received
[1:24:13] this message
[1:24:16] i want to be
[1:24:17] participators
[1:24:19] and bring the life of christ and bring
[1:24:22] the word of god and bring the promises
[1:24:25] of god's word to those that are needy of
[1:24:29] receiving them
[1:24:33] it's fine if we do it in here
[1:24:36] that's patting one another on the back
[1:24:40] but when you get an opportunity and
[1:24:42] someone calls you to be to
[1:24:45] pray for somebody it's going into that
[1:24:47] hospital and being able to tell that
[1:24:50] person that might be facing the last
[1:24:52] days of their life and be able to tell
[1:24:55] them about a god that can forgive them
[1:24:57] of their sins and if they have faith can
[1:24:59] raise them up
[1:25:05] i'm afraid our churches are becoming
[1:25:07] full-time observers
[1:25:11] observing the history of william branham
[1:25:14] instead of accepting the spiritual life
[1:25:20] that he put on betray put on display
[1:25:23] that every believer would have
[1:25:27] jesus said the works that i do
[1:25:31] you shall do also
[1:25:36] but you've got remember the tape we just
[1:25:39] listened to
[1:25:40] he said god gave the land
[1:25:43] but you had to do the house cleaning
[1:25:48] he said there's the land
[1:25:51] the
[1:25:52] observer went into the land
[1:25:55] and said
[1:25:58] that's too big of a devil
[1:26:00] to cast out
[1:26:03] if i go lay my hands on the sick and
[1:26:04] that person don't get well everybody's
[1:26:07] going to mock me
[1:26:11] the fear of failure
[1:26:15] so they sat back
[1:26:18] they went in there
[1:26:20] and they said it's the land
[1:26:23] that he said it was
[1:26:26] full of milk and honey
[1:26:29] it's got all the landmarks
[1:26:34] but man there's a lot of big things to
[1:26:36] overcome
[1:26:38] they were observers
[1:26:42] they testified to the land it was
[1:26:44] exactly the land that was described
[1:26:47] but there was
[1:26:48] two participants amen
[1:26:54] they said we i can do this
[1:26:58] i can do this
[1:27:01] i'm gonna participate
[1:27:03] i'm going to testify
[1:27:06] i'm going to talk about it i'm going to
[1:27:08] tell them about saving grace i'm going
[1:27:10] to tell them about
[1:27:12] he's a healer
[1:27:13] i'm going to ask them if they've
[1:27:15] received the holy ghost since they
[1:27:17] believed because they now are
[1:27:19] participants of the message because they
[1:27:22] heard the message
[1:27:24] and if they heard it in our participants
[1:27:26] then they're going to do what the
[1:27:28] message said if they're observers
[1:27:31] they're going to come out with their own
[1:27:34] ideas
[1:27:36] that's why we have 900 different
[1:27:38] denominations the church of jesus christ
[1:27:41] has never changed since the day of
[1:27:44] pentecost
[1:27:49] we were in paragraph
[1:27:53] he says now god only provide
[1:27:56] now god's only provided and only plan
[1:28:00] today is his son
[1:28:02] through his word for this age
[1:28:05] quickened by the spirit of his life
[1:28:09] quickened
[1:28:11] so the plan of this place
[1:28:15] is the spirit of god
[1:28:18] quickening
[1:28:19] the word
[1:28:22] that was spoken
[1:28:27] a quickening life
[1:28:29] that quickens what quick and mean made
[1:28:32] alive in other words when you're in this
[1:28:35] place there's a spirit
[1:28:37] the spirit of god that quickens what
[1:28:41] you've heard and makes it live in you
[1:28:46] we don't want to be observers
[1:28:48] i'm telling you not everybody's a
[1:28:50] preacher
[1:28:52] i understand that
[1:28:54] but but you know when that life comes on
[1:28:57] you whether it's a schoolmate
[1:28:59] whether it's a work companion
[1:29:02] whether it's a friend with whether it's
[1:29:05] someone you come in contact with you
[1:29:08] know that there's a quickening spirit in
[1:29:10] you that wants to make that message
[1:29:13] that's living in you alive to them
[1:29:17] now you know you're in that place
[1:29:21] because there's something that's moving
[1:29:23] in you quickening you
[1:29:29] now we have great schools of theology
[1:29:31] and many times
[1:29:33] nothing against it certainly not
[1:29:35] but you see
[1:29:36] when you got a school
[1:29:38] of theology
[1:29:40] jesus said
[1:29:41] in saint john 4
[1:29:44] the time has come
[1:29:46] and now is
[1:29:48] when god being a spirit will be
[1:29:51] worshiped in spirit and in truth
[1:29:55] now some people have spirit but no truth
[1:29:58] others truth but no spirit
[1:30:03] spirit and truth
[1:30:07] you know there's a lot of things that
[1:30:08] come up
[1:30:10] that you wore against
[1:30:13] i had them the
[1:30:16] baptist minister
[1:30:18] down the street he just took over
[1:30:21] he took over his
[1:30:24] the church down the street and
[1:30:27] and i went down there to see him and
[1:30:30] because i i knew that if the lord allows
[1:30:32] us to build our building we'll need
[1:30:34] parking and he said we could use his
[1:30:36] parking lot
[1:30:38] and and that's a great blessing
[1:30:40] and in the meantime
[1:30:44] he thought well you know
[1:30:47] maybe we could do something and he
[1:30:49] wanted to know if he could use my
[1:30:51] baptistry
[1:30:53] and i thought about that
[1:30:56] and i thought about it and i thought do
[1:30:58] i want him to use our baptistery him
[1:31:02] and we don't baptize the way they do we
[1:31:04] don't
[1:31:05] believe
[1:31:07] that's way and then i thought well you
[1:31:09] know
[1:31:11] he wants to do something
[1:31:13] there's some people that
[1:31:15] that
[1:31:17] want to be baptized
[1:31:19] and it's not their fault and i just
[1:31:22] prayed about it and i thought it through
[1:31:24] and so i finally told them i said you
[1:31:26] know
[1:31:28] brother young i said
[1:31:30] you know we have a moral standard at our
[1:31:33] church
[1:31:34] you know and a dress code
[1:31:37] and uh
[1:31:38] and
[1:31:40] we you know our our
[1:31:42] church we we don't wear pants
[1:31:46] and i said now if a visitor comes and
[1:31:49] they come in we're happy to let them in
[1:31:52] and hear the gospel i said but this is
[1:31:54] past that
[1:31:57] and he said okay i understand that he
[1:32:00] says what about me i said well you know
[1:32:02] i i wear slacks in a
[1:32:05] shirt when i baptized he said i can do
[1:32:07] that but he said i'll go get a
[1:32:11] robe
[1:32:13] i'll borrow some baptismal clothes from
[1:32:16] the
[1:32:17] and i told them
[1:32:18] how we did it
[1:32:20] and i thought you know i could take the
[1:32:22] stance no we don't baptize in this way
[1:32:25] but you know there's someone that wants
[1:32:26] to be baptized
[1:32:28] and i waited out
[1:32:30] and i thought my heart i thought you
[1:32:32] know that's a good thing
[1:32:37] you know and
[1:32:39] and and
[1:32:40] uh it's not i thought well is it this
[1:32:42] sunday says it's no it's down the road
[1:32:45] and i thought well you know i've made my
[1:32:48] the waters
[1:32:50] open
[1:32:51] he wants to come baptized it's not going
[1:32:52] to hurt us we know that's not right but
[1:32:55] it might give him an opportunity for me
[1:32:57] to explain to him
[1:32:59] the right way to baptize
[1:33:01] the biblical way
[1:33:03] to baptize but i'd rather that that man
[1:33:07] or that woman and that child
[1:33:09] that wants to get baptized is wanting to
[1:33:11] turn their life around
[1:33:13] and if they're getting a genuine
[1:33:15] turnaround in life where do you think
[1:33:18] the spirit of god's going to lead them
[1:33:20] it's going to lead them to god's
[1:33:22] provided place of worship
[1:33:28] if you can tell somebody this gospel
[1:33:32] from a participating standpoint
[1:33:35] and not an observa
[1:33:38] observation
[1:33:39] standpoint
[1:33:42] you'll be effective
[1:33:45] but if you're just talking if you're
[1:33:47] just observing
[1:33:49] brother branham did this and brother
[1:33:51] branham did that and brother branham did
[1:33:53] this and brother and you can't tell them
[1:33:57] what
[1:33:59] the prophet
[1:34:00] described
[1:34:02] the place of worship being
[1:34:05] and the spirit that's there and the
[1:34:08] activity that's there and the testimony
[1:34:11] that's there and the peace that's there
[1:34:14] and the joy that's there
[1:34:17] if you can't share it
[1:34:21] from a participation
[1:34:23] painting standpoint
[1:34:27] then you're really not telling them
[1:34:29] anything you're telling them what
[1:34:31] they've all
[1:34:32] ready
[1:34:33] got
[1:34:37] too many people's gospel has just been
[1:34:40] observation
[1:34:41] and when they examined themselves they
[1:34:43] weren't participants
[1:34:49] so they thought their observation was
[1:34:51] wrong
[1:34:53] you can't live
[1:34:56] on observation
[1:34:58] let's not be full-time observation
[1:35:02] now let's let's just finish up right now
[1:35:06] paragraph 117
[1:35:09] no matter how well
[1:35:12] you've taught
[1:35:15] how well
[1:35:17] you'll believe
[1:35:19] and how much of the bible
[1:35:22] that we say is truth
[1:35:25] and we believe it all true
[1:35:28] it's got to be a dynamic
[1:35:32] has got to be there the spark
[1:35:35] to set the word of fire
[1:35:38] and make it start
[1:35:41] rolling
[1:35:44] that's the activity
[1:35:48] the mechanics is the observation
[1:35:52] the dynamics
[1:35:54] is the participation
[1:35:56] it's got to have that
[1:35:59] if you don't the church sits still
[1:36:03] the car
[1:36:04] sits still
[1:36:06] you'll sit still
[1:36:09] but no matter how much you say i
[1:36:12] sympathize i believe every word of that
[1:36:16] you've got to have something to spark
[1:36:19] that off
[1:36:20] to make
[1:36:21] that 100 octane go to firing and that
[1:36:26] big church of god
[1:36:28] got to move on it's got to take the
[1:36:32] dynamics with the mechanics nothing
[1:36:35] wrong with the
[1:36:37] mechanics but it lacks
[1:36:40] the dynamics
[1:36:41] it lacks the participation
[1:36:46] and i couldn't say this
[1:36:48] i think if
[1:36:50] it's
[1:36:51] a problem i think that we could find in
[1:36:54] every church
[1:36:57] we've got observers
[1:36:58] and not participators
[1:37:02] it's not for me to call them out
[1:37:05] but we got those who are doing
[1:37:08] and carrying on
[1:37:10] and producing the power of god
[1:37:13] and we've got those that believe it i
[1:37:15] believe every bit of that but they've
[1:37:17] never been sparked
[1:37:19] into action
[1:37:21] to make the gospel roll
[1:37:23] and when it rolls it moves
[1:37:27] towards the unbeliever
[1:37:32] it really does
[1:37:34] the spirit of god will lead you into all
[1:37:38] the world
[1:37:39] to preach the gospel
[1:37:42] and then we'll close with this paragraph
[1:37:45] paragraph 1
[1:37:48] 26
[1:37:49] then notice
[1:37:51] not only does he come in
[1:37:54] by the spirit
[1:37:56] with the learning
[1:37:58] of his word
[1:38:01] malachi 4 5.
[1:38:03] revelations 10 7
[1:38:05] malachi 4 5 the seven seals the evidence
[1:38:09] a whole list
[1:38:11] this place also produces the learning of
[1:38:15] his word
[1:38:16] he manifests that word now remember the
[1:38:20] prophets believed the word
[1:38:22] they received the word of god
[1:38:24] and god the holy spirit
[1:38:27] came
[1:38:28] into them and fired that promise out and
[1:38:32] made it come to pass
[1:38:34] oh my
[1:38:35] who's going to condemn that
[1:38:39] in that paragraph we just read this
[1:38:42] last two little statements i
[1:38:44] hope it makes it
[1:38:46] clear
[1:38:48] it says
[1:38:49] it says why the dynamics was there to
[1:38:52] fire off the mechanics
[1:38:55] he was the mechanics the son himself and
[1:38:58] the father was the dynamics it's not me
[1:39:02] that does the works it's my father that
[1:39:05] dwelleth in me he's
[1:39:08] splattered forth
[1:39:10] the dynamics and makes the thing move on
[1:39:14] and bring it to pass
[1:39:16] paragraph 137
[1:39:18] no notice
[1:39:20] when the great moving power of god
[1:39:23] comes into a son of god it quickens him
[1:39:27] the spirit of life enters into him
[1:39:31] then what does it do
[1:39:34] it sets them in heavenly places
[1:39:38] right now
[1:39:41] not they will
[1:39:44] we are now
[1:39:45] we've already resurrected
[1:39:48] the dynamics and the mechanics is gone
[1:39:51] to work
[1:39:53] quickened us
[1:39:54] and we're quickened up
[1:39:56] into the presence of god
[1:39:58] where his spirit is
[1:40:01] and now we are seated together in
[1:40:04] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:40:07] in christ jesus sitting in there
[1:40:11] the great seat that's already fired up
[1:40:15] been raised from the dead
[1:40:17] or a part of it
[1:40:19] if you're a part of the
[1:40:22] bride
[1:40:23] you are
[1:40:24] because the bride is part of the groom
[1:40:27] you know
[1:40:29] so we find out that it's the same thing
[1:40:33] and she'll do exactly what it's
[1:40:36] predicted
[1:40:37] for her to do
[1:40:39] in this day
[1:40:41] she won't be a lady osea
[1:40:44] not by no means a lukewarm
[1:40:47] but she'll be on fire for god shall be
[1:40:50] moving
[1:40:52] on in the spirit
[1:40:54] of god
[1:40:56] amen
[1:40:57] the participator
[1:40:59] versus the full-time
[1:41:02] observer
[1:41:03] amen
[1:41:04] i think it's a challenge
[1:41:07] that each of us need to
[1:41:09] sit back
[1:41:10] in your life
[1:41:11] and move from what do i believe
[1:41:15] to what do i do
[1:41:17] amen god richly bless you let's stand
[1:41:19] together
[1:41:20] this evening just god's place of worship
[1:41:24] we know it because of the activity
[1:41:26] that's there
[1:41:28] and the activity of the believer so if
[1:41:30] you find a place
[1:41:32] that that's not happening you're not in
[1:41:34] the place
[1:41:38] a good start
[1:41:40] is to really know what we're looking for
[1:41:42] what is it
[1:41:44] that we're doing do we know what we're
[1:41:46] doing
[1:41:47] we're not here to give testimony
[1:41:51] to the prophet alone
[1:41:53] but we're here to give testimony to what
[1:41:56] he said the church
[1:41:58] would be
[1:41:59] let's pray
[1:42:01] our heavenly father
[1:42:03] i i hope tonight these words are
[1:42:05] encouragement
[1:42:07] because father that's a promise
[1:42:11] and we grow into the promise
[1:42:14] and faith comes by hearing and
[1:42:17] hearing the word of god
[1:42:19] and may each person that heard it not
[1:42:21] judge themselves outside
[1:42:24] but father may the judgment of their
[1:42:26] heart be i want in
[1:42:30] a command may it be like the little
[1:42:32] eagle
[1:42:33] in the barnyard
[1:42:35] not looking around and saying oh i'm
[1:42:37] here
[1:42:38] but the cry of their heart oh i want to
[1:42:40] go there father may i cry of our heart
[1:42:43] is i want to be a participant
[1:42:46] i want to move from the stands onto the
[1:42:49] field
[1:42:50] i want to move from the pew
[1:42:54] out into life's action
[1:42:56] i want to work
[1:42:58] move from
[1:42:59] inward faith
[1:43:02] to outward spoken faith
[1:43:06] i want my light to shine
[1:43:08] i want to remove the basket father that
[1:43:11] i've kept my life under
[1:43:13] and i want to set it on a hill
[1:43:16] that my good works might glorify my
[1:43:18] father in heaven
[1:43:21] that whatever place i am in life
[1:43:23] whatever pathway you talk take me down
[1:43:28] whatever people
[1:43:29] you bring me in contact with
[1:43:34] that i'm participating
[1:43:38] in the living
[1:43:41] manifested gospel
[1:43:44] that was preached to this stage
[1:43:47] the restoration of the faith
[1:43:50] that our fathers had
[1:43:53] when they went out across the land
[1:43:57] telling people of a risen savior
[1:44:02] father the great enemy has
[1:44:05] put observation towers on every corner
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:11] and yet you're walking right in our
[1:44:12] midst
[1:44:14] may each of us find you
[1:44:16] in our lives
[1:44:18] and follow you
[1:44:20] and keep your commandments
[1:44:22] and manifest the life
[1:44:25] that you've placed in us to manifest
[1:44:28] we ask it
[1:44:30] in jesus precious
