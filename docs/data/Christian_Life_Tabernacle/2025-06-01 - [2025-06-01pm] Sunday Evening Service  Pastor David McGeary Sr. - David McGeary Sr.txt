Description:
Sunday Evening Service
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Christian Life Tabernacle
June 1st, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Lord, help me to see what you see in me. [Music] and help me to [Music] know that you're in control. And when my eyes can't [Music] see my [Music] victory, I will believe you'll finish the work in me. [Music] Someday soon you'll look for me and I'll be gone.

I will believe you'll finish the work in me. [Applause] Amen. Just want to say that's the revelation of Jesus Christ to you. Amen. It's him opening your eyes to show you the work that he's done on your behalf and that you could just step in and accept it and know that he's not just the author, he's the finisher also. the what he started. He's never started anything that he didn't finish. Once he starts, he's already got a finishing point in mind and we're certainly thankful for that. We don't have any new written requests. We want to continue to remember our brother uh sister Raquel and brother Jose and pray for sister Raquel's and um speedy recovery and that the Lord will be with them and bring them back safe home as sister Rebecca has to be remembered. I want to remember her. And I know there's many traveling as this traveling season. Our brother Matthew was out preaching. We pray that the Lord will bring him back safe home. And we had this this morning to remember Caitlyn. Uh she was uh rushed to the ER with severe panic attack. And this morning and uh she need deliverance from depression and anxiety. Also, sister Sandy writes, um, "Please pray on my left foot healing and for my left foot healing and the right eye healing of uh, aneurysm." Amen. We know he's the healer of all our diseases. I am the Lord that health thee. If you have a need upon your heart, just lift your hand up to him. Brother Benjamin Cabay, if I could just come and take these needs before the Lord and Amen. We can certainly come with confidence before the throne of grace to know that it was all that's where it was all made available for us. [Music] Amen. Let's pray. God Almighty, we thank you once more, Lord, for invite us back into your house, Lord, with the song that just being sang, Lord, matching with what was preached this morning. Lord bring me to remembrance about David saying Lord remember your promise to your servant Lord because your promise Lord brings me life Lord and Lord we know by the preaching on this morning Lord it was not something new Lord but we're bringing back into remembrance Lord of what we have Lord the potential that we have in our life Lord the power that we have Lord is the promise Lord this promises Lord it's grace that we have been revealed that we have this promise Lord It's not just that we have this promise, but we have somebody that promised this and we are certain of the power that this individual hold and that is our God Almighty. Lord, and we know that we have been promised healing, Lord. We bring our sister with her left foot and right foot, Lord. We've been promised deliverance, Lord. We bring Caitlyn to you, Lord, asking for you to deliver her, Lord. Give her peace, Lord. You've promised us peace, Lord. You said joy is for a believer, Lord. And we are believing for her to have joy in her life, Lord. To have peace in her life, Lord. These these are spirit Lord. And we know your prophet told us anxiety, depression, it's just evil spirits. It's the devil coming to bother your your daughter Lord. She's your daughter Lord. And we bring her to you Lord. Lord, these all these requests Lord bring bought up here Lord. All these people that brought up these requests Lord, they know why the bodies request you Lord. They believing Lord. They have faith because they know the prayers of the saints avail much Lord. So as a body of of Christ Lord we bring all these requests to you Lord asking you that you may grant them Lord and Lord not forgetting Lord the hands that are raised here Lord I did not see everybody raised who raised their hand Lord but you saw each individual who raised their hand Lord maybe some didn't raise their hand but in their heart Lord they cried out to you Lord Aba father Lord answer these individual Lord they're here Lord bless them Lord they made a sacrifice Lord and you have something for them that you have in store Lord as the servtor of view of you Lord is preparing Lord to bring something here Lord. May you Lord work with him whether wherever he is Lord bring something to him that when he stands here and he speaks Lord that we may receive it Lord and we Lord bless us also that we may pay attention Lord not just to be distracted by our worries or whatever it's occurring Lord but we may be paying attention Lord because we know through that Lord that you may have something Lord even through communion service Lord we know in communion there's a lot of benefits to it Lord it's not just a tradition as our Bible says not a ritual Lord but something that's have life in it Lord So we ask you Lord that each person here that as they come in Lord as they will take communion later on Lord work with them Lord work with their heart Lord and as they walk out of here Lord that they may walk out differently Lord may walk closer to you Lord Lord we ask all this Lord bless our sister Lord this morning Lord Rebecca that said Lord that she want to be in your house Lord but due to circumstances she could not be here Lord and there's many more that are like that Lord may be traveling and watching this service streaming online may your presence Lord go where they are Lord and and you may be with them, Lord. Not just that because they're watching streaming, Lord, that you may not bless them, but you you are there, Lord. Wherever, Lord, that's two or three prayer gather in your name. You are there, Lord. So, bless our brother Matthew as he's traveling back. Bless him, Lord. Fill him back with strength, Lord. And Lord, bless his family as well, Lord. It's a sacrifice as he's a minister traveling and such and such, Lord. So, bless him, Lord, and give back to him, Lord, as he's pouring out his soul and his strength out, Lord. So we ask this Lord bringing putting back everything into your hand the rest of the service the worship and everything else Lord in the name of Jesus Christ not forgetting the tithe and offering Lord bless those that are giving Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Just had this song on my mind and we're going to try to sing it. I'll have Sister Joy help me out here. Amen. Those that know it, please help me. Let's try to get the tempo right on the course. Amen. King. Amen. Let's start with our chorus first. Is the name of the song is Till the Stone Passes By? Till the stone passes by. Let's start with our chorus, please. [Music] Amen. Why should I worry? Why should I fear when the very same Jesus is always so near? He lives in my heart and he hears me when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm. Just sing that for a second. Oh, and why should I worry? Why should I fear when the very same Jesus is always so near? He lives in my heart and he hears me when I cry. I'll call on his name. Sing that first verse. Out on the waters, storms raging high. The waters around them were trled by night. Fear filled their hearts. They felt they would die. They failed to remember that the master was kind. He spoke the words and the wind stood still. Even the waters they obey his will. He comes just like you. If I don't just remember that it is deep inside. Oh, and why should I worry? Why should I fear when the city is saying Jesus is always so near? It is in my heart and he hears when I cry. I call his [Music] nameless. We read in the Bible with him. Brought light to the darkness when the way restored him. How great it would be to have sleeping and walk with the master. All of the time when I'll search for the master be and when I'm in [Music] tr all I have to do is his name. Oh, why should I worry? Oh, why should I fear with the very same Jesus always? Oh, he lives in my heart and he I call on his name. Let's all sing and sing it again. Oh, and why should I? Oh, and why should I fear when Jesus is always on here? He lives in my heart and he is I call on his name. Sing that second verse as we find our pastor in the Bible. How he walked with them. Brought light to their darkness. When the way crew showed him how great it would be to have his step sleeping behind and walk with the master all the time. And when trial comes and death seems so I'll search for the master. You said I'll be there all time. And when I'm in trouble and my body, all I have to do is why should I worry? Why should I fear? to the very same Jesus. He is always so near. He lives in my heart and he call his name. Oh, and why should I be? Oh, and when the very same Jesus is always so near, he is in my heart and he hears me when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes. Thank you. Let's pray. Our gracious father, we ask you to bless us this evening. And we've come together, Father, to keep thy word. Thy word is truth, Father. And the truth is what sets us free, Father. We can come to communion when we're sick. We come to communion when we're weary and we have problems, Father, because there's healing in communion. and we just ask that you would bless it to us and help us. We pray that your goodness would be our portion. And we know that you can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens us. And Father, we come to commune with you to remember the price that was paid for the power that you've given us. that it didn't come without a cost. And we take communion acknowledging that you paid the price. And Father, as I've said many times, you get what you paid for. What you purchased, all the divine power that was in you, you poured into your church. And father, that's what communion is to us. And we want to thank you for it. In Jesus precious and wonderful and holy name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's let's just turn in our Bibles to Hebrews uh real quick. And uh and uh did I what did I do with my glasses? Did I bring my glasses out here? Well, that's what happens when you get old. Amen. Are are you are you ready for getting old? Anybody? [Music] Uh so anyway, let me just pick a scripture. Without faith, it's impossible to please God. God bless you. You may be seated. Did you get lost? Anyway, praise the Lord. We want to just uh fellowship with you a little bit before communion uh because um we definitely you know don't want to have a service without the word a after everything that our prophet told us concerning the word. And there was a little statement in here that our messenger made that I I want to um uh uh amplify, if that's the word that I could use. Not that I'm capable of that, but to kind of um encourage you and get an understanding of why that we are in the circumstance that we are in in the midst of a unbelieving world. You would think that the world would draw closer to God. But we come to find out that it's not drawing closer. It's going further and further from God. And we know the curse of the age is that they no longer wish to retain God in their knowledge. So God give them over to a reprobate mind and brands them with the hot iron. And so Lesie and I coming back from lunch today, we drove by the ballpark and there all the kids were out playing baseball on Sunday. And when our kids were brought forth when we came to Texas, you didn't play baseball on Sunday. They didn't play baseball or have practice on Wednesday. In fact, we had what we called in the state of Texas blue laws. And uh there's a couple old-timers nodding their head here that remember that you couldn't buy alcohol. You couldn't buy cigarettes. you could only buy certain items like bread, milk and and it was and they they absolutely protected Sunday morning. But then you know the love of money came in and they begin to drop the standard and lower the standard and things begin to go downhill. And the more that they went downhill in reality, the more they came up with religion, which is a covering, which is an intellectual conception of what they believe, but it never transferred from what they believed into the way that they live. And the path forward for the church is what God wants to see in the church is everything we believe. Everything we see in the scriptures. Everything that's been revealed to it transformed into a working life. A life that's about the father's business. A life with power. A life that possesses the gates of the enemy. the life that sits there and and meets Satan and says, "This is not according to the word of God. Satan, get out of my way. I'm possessing that gate." It has power. In fact, the prophet of God said that they become the master of every circumstance. And so, he he's trying to take us from all that we believe to have faith in who that we are. and then take that faith and not just hold on to it. I mean, no, I don't mean it that way. To hold on to it and cling to it, but by that faith do the works that he told us to do. And so, he makes this statement and we and before communion, I'm going to have uh David uh Jr. take our our communion uh for us tonight and read the scriptures. He said, 'W wait a minute. He said, "See, my time piece is turning just exactly right." So, Brother Bram talked about seeing all the records and seeing all the corruption in the world. And he stands back and says, "Wait a minute. This has all been prophesied. It's all working exactly according to the plan. My time piece is turning exactly right. I've got to put you upon the same basis I did the first man in them days and I put you on the same basis of Luther and Wesley on the same basis of Luther and the same basis of Wesley. So I just wanted to talk about that same basis. So in other words, Wesley, Luther and Wesley, what transpired in their generation, we are put on the same basis that they are. So the same challenges, the same things. So the first thing that we would talk about about uh Wesley and them is that the first thing is God gave them something to believe. a furtherance of the word. So you not the same old doctrine, not the same old teaching, not the same old traditions. He gave them a furtherance of the word. He gave them something that, if I might just say it this way, that wasn't the same old crop. You know what I mean? It was fresh mana. It was opened up. So there was a opening, a a revealing, something that was hid within the scriptures, something that the horse riders buried away. This messenger comes forth now and he he sees something and he sees it in the word of God. And so he's given something to believe just like you've been given something to believe in your age, something out of the norm, something that's not popular. Okay? And he gave them opposition. So what they believed they they the people were opposed to. They didn't just Wesley and and Luther, they just didn't say what they had to say without criticism. And and then finally, he gave them a reward for keeping his word. Now, just take Luther for an example. So Luther He in reading the scriptures and looking at the condition. Can you imagine when the spirit of God moved upon him and Luther first great move that he made was standing against the authority of the pope. No, the Pope isn't the vicer of Christ. He's not God on earth. His word is not the absolute truth. Now, the whole world is Catholic. The Pope has influence in who becomes king in in in in peacemaking. He rules the government. He the the the churches are all based on uh on getting permission from the pope. He's running almost he's running the whole show. Everybody's a uh believes in the Catholic faith and thus their doctrine the one and only true faith and they had their apostles creed you know and so now Luther is given something to believe he now sees that there's justification and and uh uh that there's uh uh that and he protested the Catholic Church. He now says that he's now realizes and speaks to the people saying that you don't have to do penance for your sins. Your sins are forgiven by grace, not by suffering. And now the Catholic Church is making millions of dollars on penance. You light a candle. You have to do something to get your forgiveness. You have to say so many Hail Maryries. You have to do so much so many uh prayers. You have to fast. You have to do all these things to be forgiven. And then John Wesley comes around and he realizes it's by grace that you're saved and and you're justified by faith. So Wes Wesley he he began to stand there and he began to realize that it was by faith that you are saved. And and when he that message that he got, John Calvin began to pick up and and they began to preach, you're saved by faith, not by works, not by anything else you do. Uh just by faith. And then he believed that the whole church was a priesthood. But you know, they begin to run out on a limb. You know what I mean? you're saved by faith. If if I believe, I'm saved. And there was nothing. Uh and that was good for the hour that it was in cuz people were coming out. And and the reward for that was to for a man to know that Jesus died for his sins and he was forgiven and it was a free gift of God, not an earned gift by fulfilling penance. That was a reward to them to really have a revelation of Jesus Christ dying for their sins. And that can you imagine if every day you had to do something for your sins? That's the condition of the Catholic Church. You know, I I I I I oppose that. But I even experienced with my mother in the last uh few weeks of her death, she wouldn't take any pain pills. We feel she had a cracked pelvis or her back was in excruciating pain and we had to move her and and and she wouldn't take any any uh uh medicine for the pain. And I I I didn't understand it. And then she said, you know, I I'm I'm I'm taking this pain and suffering for my sins. And I thought, that's just the opposite. We have a Jesus that makes you whole. We have a Jesus that suffers for you. You don't have to suffer, Mom, for your sins. They've already been thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more. And so Luther had to do two things. One, he had to accept a revelation that was contrary to the trend of the day. He had to accept a revelation that was not taught or believed by the establishment. He had to accept something that that had never been presented before. So it wasn't it wasn't uh proven in any way. But God proved that it was God because God had believers there to believe it. He wasn't the only one that saw it. There was an elect people that read what he read and read the scriptures and they begin to say that's true and and and and I see that that's right and that is and then they begin to experience. Let me say this. They began to experience the reward of that age. They began to to they not only saw it in truth, but they experienced the forgiving grace of God and the freedom from their sin and the freedom that God could not that they no longer would continue as a sinner, but now they were set free by the blood of Jesus Christ. So there was a spirit for that age and they received the spirit of that age and they begin to walk in the light and the truth. But what happened is they begin to get away with it. And Calvinism is that you're saved by faith alone. And it's a partial truth. It's true and every aspect of it is true, but it's not the whole truth. You understand what I'm saying? Someone could tell you a truth and yet in one way be lying to you because they're withholding other truths. You know, did you drive the car? Yes, I drove the car. Now, they didn't say that they got in a wreck. They withheld that. You know, I had a friend, he had a car and he had a couple boys and he told them, he went on a trip and he said, "Whatever you do, don't drive the car." So, what do you think the first thing that happened when they got their first phone call from and they knew they were out of town for sure? Well, they decided they might as well drive the car. Nobody would know, you know. So, they took the car and they went driving the car. Well, they were driving the car and they got in a circumstance where they kind of hit a curb or they hit something in the road. And so, you know, they didn't think nothing of it, but when they got home, they looked at the car and it had a dent up on the side of it and they thought, "Oh no, my goodness. I'm going to get caught." So they gathered some money together, went to a body shop and and made sure the guy got it fixed and he fixed it and everything so it looked perfect and they put it right back in the garage exactly where it was to everything. And the parents come home and and and they're looking around and they they they notice the car. I said, "Did you drive the car?" you know, and they said, "Well, I'll tell you something. It's amazing because when I left, that car had a great big dent in it that your mother put there a few weeks ago, and now it doesn't." You see, in other words, doing the work, you know, isn't what did it, you know. So they were caught anyway. And and and so the the whole truth of it is is we are justified by faith. But then Wesley came along and he said, "Not only you're justified by faith, but you've got your faith has to have works accompanying with it. Show me your faith without your works, and I'll show you my faith by your works. Show me that you're justified without the proof and evidence in your life that you've been justified. Because the the Calvinists, they begin to be able to mix with the world and do things in the world. And Wesley comes up in a new revelation and stands up and says no. So he had opposition to move forward to go forward in the word. He had opposition. He had he the Calvinist rose up against him and telling them no. You know they they both and and uh they both believed in communion as being a part of uh the Christian life. They understood that Luther got rid of all the other sacraments and everything and and you know what they believed. Now Wesley comes along and he begins to he adds sanctification to justification. And then he uh he he begin to uh meet resistance because he began to preach the believer should have works. It's part of salvation. In other words, you can say you're saved, but if you don't have a saved person's work, you're not. Oh my goodness, did he ever meet a bunch of trouble. In fact, they wanted to excommunicate him. But God had believers there that saw that, believed it. And not only did they see it and believed it, but they experienced the grace and the spirit of that age. And Wesley taught the Christian discipline, praying about what you do, knowing where you go, dressing right, acting right, keeping your life subject to the word of God. He taught that. And can you imagine the great reward that came to believer knowing that their sanctification pleased God? and then we come to our day. So if we're here on the same basis, then we're going to be given something out of the ordinary to believe. We come in our day and now we recognize by Isab that the ministry of the son of man has come in our day that God veiled deity in a messenger. So now we see we have Malachi 4:5. This man performs Malachi 4:5. Well, all the Carmelites and all the Calvinists and all the Pentecostals, they go ape. No, that's not true. That isn't that that's John the Baptist, you know, that's that's not that they don't believe in five comingings of Elijah. They're raising up and but yet here's given something to believe. You believe that that that the Lord Jesus promised to come to the Gentiles and that he was going to have a coming in our day. And he came and he availed himself in human flesh. And through that body, he did the same works he did 2,000 years ago. Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart, turning his back to the audience, casting out devils, raising the dead, do all those things. That was him veiled in a man. And he asked us to believe that. He asked us to believe that there was be a calling out from the denominational system and that the doctrines and secrets of the Bible would be opened in our day. Now, we're on the same basis they are. So, we have to be given something to believe. That's what separates us is what's been revealed to us is what separates us. That's what separates us from the impersonator. Is that the word's been given to us. Something's been given to us to believe. And now there's a believer to accept it. Somebody's there is going to prove it's true. And so we find out that that as Wesley preached that he meant the opposition of the Calvinists. Just like we would meet the opposition of the Pentecostals. You know what do you mean? You don't shout. You don't speak with tongues. You don't have all this emotion. And now you're standing back and saying, "Well, we do, but our faith is based on the revealed word of God. What on the we believe in what promises have come to pass, not by experience. The church wasn't built on experience." And the Pentecostal church was preaching experience. They were preaching emotion. that. In other words, they believed if they felt the Holy Spirit led them to do something that was greater and above what the scripture said. And and people that have been in Pentecost realize that many of them would actually tell you that they're led of the spirit and the very things that they were doing were contrary to scripture. But it was all about spirit and it wasn't the mixture of spirit and truth. And now can you imagine? And now God comes and gives us something to believe. And we meet the opposition. And now our reward is to know that we have truth. And the truth has been proved to us that this is the truth. And we know that our reward is a rapture and a resurrection and that we are not stuck in the deception of the world gone by. And it's just like the children of Israel when they come out. And God does this in every age. He makes a move in the spirit. And all the unbelievers that don't believe, they perish. and God moves on. And and and that's what happened with Israel. Israel was given a chance to believe every promise of God that that was their line land. They walked right up to the land and saw that it was everything that God said it would be. They walked up to the land and then when they they saw that the land was possessed with opposition and possessed with giants and and they they got there and the very God that destroyed Egypt in just a very months day time to get to that land they already forgot what God had done for them and they refused to cross over at Kadesh Barnea and God had to get all the unbelief and he let every unbeliever perish and then he went over with true believers. He went over with Joshua and Caleb and the their the their children because all those that had the opportunity to enter into that land all disbelieved and they all perish. Now there's nothing but Joshua and Caleb and the children of those and we are the children being returned back to the faith of our fathers and Joshua represents the Holy Spirit. The spirit of God is to lead us in to the land of promise where every promise is ours. We're justified by our calling. We're sanctified by the obedience and potential in the work. And finally, we become possessors. And we possess the promises and we possess the line. And now we just don't become hearers of the word, but we become what? Doers of the word. Think of it. And how does he do it? How did he bring it all to pass? How did Wesley get to where he was? Because God provided him believers. How did Luther get to where he was? Because God provided him believers. How did this message get to where it is today? Because God provided him believers. And and so I'd like just to read this. I love this statement. And and he says here he says he promised his seed would be be a stranger in a strange land and would be misjudged by the people as they sojourned. Isn't that exactly how we are? I hate it when people misjudge me. You don't you you follow a man. No, I don't. There's there's only one place that God meets a man under a shed blood. You're in a cult. No, I'm not. This isn't a cult. This is the true church of the living God. This is the elect lady. This is the bride. I'm not in a cult. I'm no different than anybody else. I might not do the worldly things, and I might have sanctification and holiness in my life, but I feel just the way you do. Well, you all dress a certain way. You know, you you don't wear shorts. Every time I meet some of my friends that aren't believers, they they Why don't you ever wear shorts? Of course, I'm always nice with them. I know if you said if you saw my legs, you wouldn't wear shorts either, you know. But then I I explained to him. I says, "Well, I'm a Christian and this is part of our faith. They just don't understand it. You got reproach and you bear the reproach. You know, I I I have sat down with many a guy says, "Oh, you know that uh I think it was John Haggy or I don't want to get wrong if it wasn't him, but said, you know, he prophesied brother Brandham's death." Yeah. They always prophesy after the fact, you know, they they they see something and then the event happens and they say, "Oh, yeah. This is the this is the fulfillment of it over here." That's not the way brother Brandon prophesied. He told you the name, the place, the position, and everything. And the time when he said when he said Deus Shagarian's daughter was going to die at 3:00 a.m. or whatever time it was, he told her she was going to die, when she was going to die, and why she was going to die. And guess what happened? She died. And after he prophesied that and spoke that, they all stood up and said, "Oh, God's Pharisee and the power of the resurrection, go into her room." and she's going to rise up in a mighty way and and she's going to be a testimony for the world. And 400 of them all prophesying. And what do you think happened? It happened exactly the way that God said it would happen. And that's the one thing that you can trust in. If God said he'd give you your children, he's going to give you your children. I don't know when, I don't know how, but it's a promise and we believe the promises. And then I'd like to close with this and Davey will get prepared to come and read. He says, "Notice." He says, he says, "Watch when they got to Kadesh Barnea." At Kadesh Bernese, Moses sent out sent out one out of each tribe to go spy on the land and see which way they was to enter. And he sent his general Joshua, which uh which was a prophet, and he sent minor prophets under Moses. and Joshua listened to Moses and they sent them out to go spy the land. And and then we find out that he said, "And no matter what or how close you are to Jordan, no matter what your circumstance is, if you could only hold that promise of God in your heart, God will prove it, that it's so." In the midst of all unbelief, he still will prove it to be so. God will still prove this message to be true. No matter how ugly they draw it, no matter if how many believe the sign message guys they bring up, no matter how many voices, the people that get so obsessed with trying to disprove the message, they're actually mentally demonpossessed. They wake up in the morning. How can I disprove this message? They're on the podcast. I up to say this message. They criticize every brother thing brother Brandham said. They point to the cloud. They point to this. They point to that. It don't matter how much they think they can disprove this message. The one thing they can't take from me is divine revelation that God put me here to believe it. He put me here to prove that it's true. And and the rapture is going to be the showdown. And I know when that rapture comes, he's going to call my name. My name's on the Lamb's book of life. He said, now notice it was by believers that he proves his word. He can only prove his word, not by unbelievers. It's only by believers that he can prove his word. No matter how much the rest of them claim to be, oh, I believe, brethren. See, if you do, God will prove it. So, cuz we look and see the others. How many people say they believe the message? How many some say they believe, brother Brandham's a prophet of God? And look at how many show up for communion. You know what the prophet of God said? you don't don't take communion, you're not going to be there. It's a commandment. That's right. But over and over again, we make the claim of being believer and then the life isn't there that identifies it. And even our churches today, they don't even have communion. They don't have footwashing. It's not even in their agenda. It's not in their program. Arbitrarily, because of the laziness of the people and because of the poor response of the people, they took it out for the people's sake. And then they actually deceive the people. They're using the same tactic that Wesley used. Oh, we're just abide by by faith alone. I believe the message and then Wesley said, "No, I'm talking about us being on the same basis, right?" Wesley comes, "No, not only do are you saved by faith, but you're saved by obedience." That's right. Faith without obedience is is is no good. It's got to be coupled with obedience. You can say you believe Malachi 4:5 and cut your hair. You can say you believe Malachi 4:5 and wear pants, wear earrings, do all kinds of sneaky things, but if you're a true believer, you obey the word of God. Now, I know I'm preaching to the choir, but maybe by some means there's somebody listening to the sermon tonight. And so it doesn't matter how we measure our congregation, how many people we put in here on Sunday or or or or how many baptisms we have. If nobody ever can take that further step into communion and into footwashing and into a full obedience to every word of God, then really, how do we prove that we are that church? Well, you're here tonight. You're proving exactly what he said. The true church is a small number. Many are called but few are chosen. And it's a reality because we're put on the same basis. We have to believe and we have to obey the same basis that Luther and Wesley were put on. That same challenge, the same faith and works together is the same basis that we're here to obey obey the full word of God. So the prophet of God said, if you're a true believer, anybody can say they believe, but a true believer responds to every word of God. They don't let every circumstance and every finance and every little problem that comes up keeps them from the word of God. I know men that have moved, left their jobs, their homes everywhere just so they could be a to be in a place to have communion. one of the greatest privileges of the church. I can preach longer because it's not going to take us five minutes to have communion because none of the unbelievers are here. So he said he said and he proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it. It's by his believing children that he proves his word. Now he had the believers, the old crop died off the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it. Now let everyone of them perish. Why? Every one of them. Everyone of them but the believers. He who was who who was left. Moses had taken been taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and this was their children and there were only two that crossed over and that was the believers Joshua and Caleb and then that they was the believers they was the ones who crossed over it's only it's the only way God can do it is by his believing children. So you what I'm trying getting at is you've got to see your role and how important it is to keep the word of God to fulfill what God's bringing to pass. And when the believers start believing it and doing it, the unbelievers is going to start to perish. A great falling away. this clinging on to a crowd and having a life of just coming in when you want to and showing up to church 15, 20 minutes late and molding on in here with no respect. Let me tell you something, it's not going to last very long. God will put an end to it. He will separate the believer from the unbeliever because God's word calls for total separation from unbelief. And I shouldn't be preaching this to you, but when you see it happening, when you see one by one the world taking them over and their jobs taking them over and now you don't see them anymore and pretty soon they're into another lifestyle and they make church once in a while and they just drift off and before they know it, God's moving and they don't know God's moving. God's fulfilling his word and they don't know God's fulfilling his word because they they set up a camp. They didn't keep themselves in tune. They didn't obey the word. And God's not going to ask them to go further if they don't have their ABCs. He's not going to ask them to go further if they're not obeying. He's not going to keep heaping unbelief on them. He's just going to move with the believer. He's going to take the believer to prove the rapture. Do you realize that's the next thing that God's got to prove? is that there is a rapture and that there's an elected people for the rapture called the bride. And he said, "Whatever you do, don't miss it." He's going to prove it. But he's going to prove the rapture by believing believers. So, you should be grateful you're here tonight. He said, And the unbelievers had all perished in the wilderness. And this was their children. And there was two crossed over. That was believers, Joshua and Caleb. And they was believers. And they was the ones who crossed over. It's only It's the only way God can do it is by believing children. You believe that? All right. His believers was the ones that done it. He used them to cross over with. God used you. He's going to use you to cross over in the third Exodus. I want you to notice he does it that way in every age. He does it every time by the same method. He has to take believers. And then in order to have believers to meet that word, he's got to predestinate it to that age. See, he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age. Did you get it? Did you feel it? Did you see it? Do you understand it? That's what's happening today. He's predestinated to this by his fornowledge. He predestinated Malachi 4:5. It's got to happen. And when he comes over and predestines anything to happen in his word, he will prove his word to be so. And when he predests anything to happen, he says it'll happen. He knows that seed will be there just at that time. He predestined a bride. She is going to be there. Going to be raptured. She's going to be there. He predestinated it by his fornowledge. And there's nothing that's going to stop it. What's he do? He predestinates the believer. He has communion. He's going to predestinate people to be there to have communion because it's something that he gave the church to do. And somebody's going to do it. Is water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a commandment of God? Yes. He's going to have somebody, as we've seen this morning, be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it's predestinated to be kept alive. And so to this evening, you have to understand that all that you go through and all the struggles and all the challenges is the same thing that everybody before has went through. the true believer in order to keep this word. And I'll tell you, it hasn't even entered into our hearts the things that God hath prepared to them that believe. And the sufferings of this present world aren't even worthy to be compared to the glory that we'll receive. What this obedience to this word of God's going to do for us, you won't imagine. Fear not, little flock. It's the father's good pleasure to give you the heaven. You believe the word, he'll give you every desire of your heart. He'll give you your jobs. He'll give you your mates. He'll give you your health. He'll do exceedingly ab above what you can even ask or think. God believe and holds obedience greater than sacrifice. God bless you, brother Dave. You can come and do the communion reading. If you'd stand with me, it's 1 Corinthians chapter 11. take our text as the deacons prepare. We'll give a moment for those just to make ready for the communion. Reading out of chapter 11 verse 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself. And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. If any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together into condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Let's just take a moment as the brothers would come, you prepare and tar one for another. Gracious heavenly father, you said you took the bread. This is not an office or thing that is done man father but it's done in you as we approach your suffer our hearts are remembering that we're not worthy our righteousness is a filthy rags but we're remembering a sacrifice that paid for an approach to you Lord we're thanking you for that asking your forgiveness we receive it we remember it claim it that Lord we can be found in communion with you Lord we ask that you would Bless this bread that represents your body that was broken. Lord, it's a paid finished work. Lord, wine, Lord, grant revelation, Father, that we'll take the next step and we'll walk forward with you, Lord. As you reveal your word, we're going to receive the word for our day, every day. Father, walk constantly with you. Bless it now, Lord. May each one just carry one for another as we give it time. Prepare our hearts. In the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Clear. [Music] Okay. Stand and sing. Life is worth a living. Amen. Whoever read from Sorry, I think I'm still emotional on seeing my our pastor take communion with my mother. Just need to compose myself. I'm sorry. Let's read from John chapter 13. Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come, that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. and supper being ended, and the devil having put it into the heart of Judas the Scariot Simeon's son, to betray him. Jesus knoweth that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God. He raisth from supper, laid aside his garments, and took a towel, and girded himself. After that, he pth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded, then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter saith unto him, Lord, does thou wash my feet? Jesus answered, and said unto him, What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter said unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet.' Jesus answered to him, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me." Simon Peter saith unto him,"Lord, not only my feet, my feet only, but also my hands and my head." Jesus saith to him, "He that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet, but is clean every wit. And ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him." Therefore said he, ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done for you. Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily I say unto you, the servant is no greater than his Lord, neither is he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. God bless you.
