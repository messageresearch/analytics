amen let's pray together our gracious heavenly father we certainly ask you to bless us this evening as we fellowship a few moments around your word in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you let's turn to the book of galatians and we want to just read the first few verses of the book of galatians and trust that the lord will bless us we just want to just read a few statements to this evening and just kind of fortify the things that we've said this morning and just trust that we'll have a nice time in the lord we appreciate uh you at home that are listening and uh are joining in to uh make the the service uh work for us today so we just it just takes all of us uh pulling together and we we trust we still have some people out there that are still with us and and uh holding strong to us let's read these first few verses um uh of the book of galatians paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by the lord jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren which are in are with me into the churches of galatia grace be to you in peace from god our father and from our lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen god bless you you may be seated we just want to talk just a little bit this evening and and take a look just at a moment and as we we see here that in the fourth verse who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and of our father and so we just want to uh take a moment to kind of remind us as we talked this morning that we are living in a present evil world and the the amazing thing about uh when somebody has uh something that's evil uh you you know it's always uh disguised you know what i mean like there there's so much uh warnings today and uh uh you know i'm a a member of arp that stands for apparently precious people or something you know but anyway i think it's an organization for old people and uh and they're always warning you of scams you know and uh and all the scams are always disguised you know they will call you up and say uh this is the government this is the and we're going to arrest you this is the fbi and uh you know and we found out that you've got this money you owe and if you and if you'll send it to us we'll take this off your record or or something like that you know and people panic uh always thought maybe their conscience wasn't right or something i don't know but what i'm trying to say is that evil is always disguised in fact the bible tells us that satan appears as an angel of light and we just want to talk about that just for a little bit this evening as we as we realize what we were talking about this morning is that we're in a countdown that that the world's counting down and the the things that are on their list of that the evils satan wants to accomplish before his destruction how many knows this world has got to get to a certain place where they cross the line that they've they've they've spurned the mercy of god they've rejected the word of god and there's nothing left for them but judgment we know that's the word of god and so what that we see and what that we're watching is we're watching the world slowly turn away from god and march down that path towards that line of destruction and and so and and remember that god destroyed this world once before because they became so evil and that they they wish to no longer retain god in their thinking and and so if god was just in in performing that judgment upon them then this world in this age can't get away with it so he says as it was in the days of noah in other words that was the time that man reached the final line they counted down they spurned the mercy they spurned the warnings they rejected everything that god was trying to tell them until they got to the place that they didn't even want to retain god in their knowledge and god gives them over to a reprobate mind so just think pretty soon this world is going to be run by people that have a reprobate mind they have no more common decency they have no more real care for for people that that that their their there's continually evil on their heart and that's what god said he said i've looked at man and their their thoughts are continually evil and he says i i i repent that i made man i i repent that i made man and and and so he he destroyed the earth the the only reason god didn't wipe it off totally is because he had an elect people he there was another heritage that was with him in the beginning and that was his eve that was his pride and he had to redeem her out of this earth and so he let that seed come over on that ark and both seeds came over on that ark and so that god could finish the plan of redemption and and it predestinate that seed and elect that seed and and redeem her and bring her into existence and when he's accomplished that there's no more need for the rest of it because they don't want anything to do with them they don't want to think about them they don't want to have them they don't want to live by anything that he offers in fact they found themselves something else to worship and we just want to uh just talk about that just for a few uh moments he's uh and as we talk and i really think if you're at home and this week uh if you have an opportunity i i hope that you're not too busy that you can't read your bible but i think it was a very good time for us as a body of believers in our individual study if you could work in uh reading and listening to the message the god of this evil age because when brother branham preached these things they they weren't as self-evident as they are now they seem to they they seem to be uh covered with uh with the religions of man the the covering of christianity was over america and all these spirits were still working but they were covered with christianity we were a christian nation we uh we said the pledge of allegiance and had god we trust on our money and we prayed and it was uh we were considered quote unquote a christian nation and we were we were proud to say in god we trust and act and we're a christian nation act and uh we believe it you know uh uh we believe in prayer you know we believe in the bible on the table and the flag upon the wall you know neighbors that's the answer to it all it's the backbone of our nation and you'll always find salvation with the bible on the table and the flag upon the wall that used to be america they don't want the bible you know the gideons which uh you know i helped support the gideon some and and and their effort but they used to put a bible in every motel now you know that they can't do it because it's offensive it's offensive you know they want to take down the cross because it's offensive there's people that out right out there today want to remove the cross because the cross is offensive they want to do away with uh in public places there was a certain city in in our country that they had the ten commandments posted and they they sued them to remove the ten commandments from the courthouse because it offended somebody and so it tells you that man is offended by god god is offensive to man amen and and that's because man doesn't want to follow and be what god created them to be okay and so we find that the the these spirits are working and i think this is important to us based on what we were sharing this morning that as we see this evil world getting more evil we must also understand that god has a counter to that and that's making an elect lady more christ-like and so as we read a few of these statements and just fellowship with you this evening those that are here and those that are listening i appreciate those of you that have came out because it's a lot easier to talk to somebody and then nobody you know i i trust that somebody listens better than nobody and and so that we rejoice around these things now these things are precious to me because they came to us from a messenger from god god sent a voice to tell us these things it's just not a great ministry that was here and if if you go out and you listen and you you understand what's going on on the church world many teachers today out in the nominal church world are quoting brother branham they're referring to his visions they're referring to his prophecy and all that they're doing is making him to be a great man that once came upon the earth and had a great ministry so they're taking the prophet of god and they're placing him in history and they're saying this was a great move of god and then they make reference to their ministries and what god's doing in them he was great he was a great messenger now i'm a messenger you know he he had great signs and wonders for his day and and and and we've moved from that and now here we are today but that was not that was just the vindication so that's what man was blessed with is that the vindication the reason the ministry was there and the son of man and the turning of the back to the audience and the discerning of the thoughts and the tense and the raising the dead and the blind eyes coming open and all the signs and wonders which we have never seen since the day of the lord jesus christ and we will never see again the manifestation that was manifested in the flesh of none other than jesus christ his person coming down and taking over a man's flesh and standing there in the veil of human flesh speaking and doing signs and wonders that ministry was prophesied for a certain time it was prophesied for a certain hour and it was carried out in a certain man there there's not it cannot be duplicated it cannot be duplicated but what came from that man was the message from the lord jesus christ himself through that man through that man's lips through that vessel in other words manifesting himself in flesh just like he managed himself in flesh to the uh israel and to the children of of god and the hebrew children and the 12 tribes of israel which was promised that that was promised to the gentiles that god would veil himself in flesh again that he would come and do the same signs and wonders to the gentiles that he did to the jews and they rejected him because there was an exodus out of the law into into the grace just like the prophet of god said if you go back and read the countdown he says man always counts backwards he says because there was 10 tribes of israel but there was two others that were the sons of joseph was what ephraim and manassas is that who it was now when one was older and one was younger and when he went to pray for his children to give the blessing and you you know the law that the elder son got double the portion so he got double and the next son got what was left that was kind of how it was that was called the inheritance was passed down to the first son to keep everything going and to keep everything uh the family business going and the inheritance going and and that was their custom but when he went to pray for the children his hands crossed and he gave the portion to the younger showing that the law which was older the blessing was now passed from the law the older son to the younger son which was the the new church and that they came in an exodus from the law to grace and the inheritance now was passed over to those that believed in the lord jesus christ and received the remission of their sins and took the one sacrifice for sin over the continual offering for sin and it showed that that that passing and and so now that we're we're uh sitting in in this hour that we're sitting in we we are realizing that there's something that's passed on so the messenger came and delivered a message to an elected people who were going to receive an inheritance and what did esau do he didn't deem that inheritance in fact it meant nothing to him because he felt he could do it on his own he was gruff he was a hunter he didn't need that you know and he he just got so desirable in the flesh that he didn't the birthright and he sold it for a a bowl of soup i guess or porridge or whatever it was but but but to jacob that meant everything to him and and i wonder if that's if it means everything to us this message is our birthright you understand it's the thing that produces us and keeps us from this present evil world the deception was going to be so great that satan was going to appear as an angel of light and his deception was going to be so great so deceptive it was going to come like such a beautiful light like such a wonderful thing that if that the very elected would be deceived if possible now so what did god do to for the elected he gave them a message that would keep them from the deception of the world of this present evil world that was the purpose of the message was to come and keep us from the deception of this present evil world if you don't regard the message then how are you going to regard that which keeps you from being deceived you'll be deceived and so we ask ourselves and i like how this starts and i i really am encouraging you to sit down and listen to this it's a very long message two hours and 45 minutes you can just study it and go through it and skip a picture of what he's saying has god lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control i wonder the true answer to this question is to my opinion there is two opposing spirits in the world today at work two spirits how does the church be gain its power when it recognizes the two spirits okay and withstands the evil spirit and takes the full armor of god the word of god to defend itself and to defeat the enemy remember this message is your defense it's what you put up if not he will possess your gate instead of you possessing his gate so he said there's two spirits working at work now there can't be no more than two heads one of them is the holy spirit at work and the other one is the spirit of the devil and in the last days in deception so there's two spirits one is the holy spirit at work and the other one's the spirit of the devil in the last days in deception the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit the other one the devil spirit working into step deception and the people of the earth are now making their choice so that that's what them there's two spirits at work and these one of them is deceiving the people and the other one is telling them the truth one of them's the pure word of god that was promised in this days sent to us by the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 a divine messenger that would come at a certain time you ever wonder why brother branham came when he did if he would have come in this day they would have shut him down they wouldn't allow any meetings you know even if 10 000 people could show up and instantly every single one of them test negative they wouldn't allow it someone said to me brother mcgeary this morning you said that the the pope was the devil did you know that got out on the internet praise god the world needs to know the pope's the devil it's the mark of the beast but you understand so satan's spirit is working through what deception you know where the mark of the beast mark of the beast is one's on your hand right and that that represents you carrying out his works his righteousness satan's righteousness the other is on your forehead which means your mind and your thinking that you think the way he thinks the only one place what is the word of god it's a thought expressed the only way we know how god thinks is by his word and and satan took that word and he took the word when he tempted jesus and he said it's written it's written and satan said jesus said get behind me satan you're perverting the word of god he perverted the word of god in eden he perverted the word of god at the first exodus he's trying to pervert the word of god at this exodus and put it on your mind can there's only one thing that can fight that deception it's truth there's one answer to a lie and that's the truth that's why the unforgivable sin is to call the spirit of god veiled in flesh in this age doing the same signs and wonders that the lord did when he was here on earth delivering the true interpretation of god's word and to call that beelzebub and the devil there's no forgiveness for that in this life or the life to come why because you called the very thing the only thing that can save you not so then you've cut that off and you'll perish so he said so we we he said so they're now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ so the words here the message is here calling you out calling a bride out reaching out don't think just because you've recognized that god sent a messenger and that the pillar of fire had come that the angels were caught in a cloud as it was prophesied that the statue of a perfect man is taking place and and you see those things that you've reached a place of knowledge that the call has stopped he's still calling us out he's still calling us to perfection as we said this morning he's got something for us that we've never seen before that's going to empower us to take the promise of the rapture rapturing faith so we've got to recognize he's not done calling me he's not done leading me i'm not cannot putting this message down and now it becoming a history book there's still a living voice to it a moving spirit to it a quickening power to it there's still revelation in it look he says here he says he says and the holy spirit is calling out a bride he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her for this age showing that it is christ that's how he's doing it that's how he's calling out a bride by showing the promise behold i'll send you elijah the prophet by vindicating it and by showing i promise to her for this age showing that it is christ that's the revelation that he manifests and shows it's christ if he said the spirit of god as it growed into the full stature of god in the age that we're now living in the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe god will be called out of this chaos anybody see the same chaos i do the devil's unholy spirit is calling his church by the air as usual by perversion of the word of god like he did at the beginning see coming right back again to seed time again for eden is here again oh eden is here again wouldn't it only be just if god's bride had failed by rejecting the word that she would be restored again and not accept his lie but this time prove that she is true to her vow prove that she's accepted what god's done in this generation to make her stand with the scriptures and with the revealed vindicated word of god and therefore she's she's proven that through her union with the lord she's been cleansed and made whole and put on the right robe of marriage and now has made herself ready for the marriage of the lamb it only makes sense let's don't get this thing in religious realms this is spiritual resurrection the resurrection is on the transformation is taking place the calling is here but we had to have this condition of the world in order to meet the challenge of keeping our vow in other words this is the same devil that was in eden offering his tree of knowledge to her and now she's received the word brought to her by a divine messenger and prophet the message delivered to her just like the message was delivered to mary yes you shall be impregnated with the word of god and something should be in you the redeemer and now we've received the word of god that in the spiritual type one being the natural this bride this mary she receives the word of god and she becomes totally part of that word of god and they become one and satan's trying to lie to her and keep her he and so we find out he says now notice then the beast that was come upon the earth would deceive all whose names were not put in the lamb's book of life slain before the foundation of the world in god's own thinking god the great spirit in the beginning before there was a beginning he was god and did you know you were in him then if you are a christian now you was in him then so that's why he didn't destroy that the flood because you were if and then and you had to be manifested and then if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of jesus christ and then when jesus died at the cross i died with him for i was in him then for he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later now knowing we would be manifested now here we are and he and we was at calvary with him he went to the grave with him and we raised with him in his resurrection and are now ascended by his spirit into the throne of grace sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus amen as the germ of natural life is brought down the germanization of father to father to father to father and so is the life of christ germatized that's the reason god uses eliza spirit five times what is it it's the handing down the germatizing amen john the baptist germatized the people behold there's one sitting among you whose sandals i'm not worthy to loosen i baptize you with water but he'll baptize you with fire you see the passing down the passage now now the spirit of an elijah in our day came and passes down to us the true unadulterated resurrected word so that resurrection can come in us and we can partake in a rapture because it's our only hope the revelation of the manifestation of the promise just as your natural life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father so is the spirit of god that was predestinated before the foundation of the world and when it the entire word of god incomplete was headed up in a human body called jesus christ in there god made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil now listen oh if you could only believe what god has given satan's whole job is to discredit the word of god because do you understand what he has given if we could only realize what was given if we could recognize what he's done for us if we could recognize the day and its message he says the authority oh if we could only believe what god has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there and don't believe it or afraid to move you'll never use it i honestly believe church and i hope all the messages i've been preaching since we've been in this whole thing has all about being about the church getting active the church coming to life the church getting involved the church carrying out its commission we've got the greatest powerful message in the world and and he's got us back in a corner he's he's he's he's put the old boogie man on us and said there will be a consequence if you use it you'll be socially incorrect you know you can't say mrs or mr it's not mailman anymore it's male person well i don't mind saying male lady you know what i mean but that's not politically correct and we could go down the list and we can go down the list we're afraid can you imagine getting so bad that you won't put the gender of your child on a birth certificate because you're dumb enough to believe that they have a choice i mean that's stupid you know that's stupid alls it is is is preparing that child to take on a sodom and gomorrah in spirit i mean you're not a man or you're not a woman you make that choice later yeah we've heard that message before you know what the result of that message was fire and brimstone and that's what's coming again that is absolutely ignorant but you see how they're conditioning you see how they're fighting you see how they're preparing you know what that community hates more than anything is when you tell them you know that's a spirit and you can be delivered from it and you can be set free oh no god made us this way god made us this way so the earth wouldn't become overpopulated god made us this way and the bible tells us leaving the natural use of a woman burning in their own lust man with man working that which is unseemingly because god had given over to a reprobate mind i'll tell you what god's solution for the population problem is it's the resurrection that's what his solution is god's solution for everything that's going on is the rapture that's god's answer i'll take you out when it gets too evil for you to bear i'll take you out well satan's poisoning us by candy coating it making us anemic making us where we don't use the power of god and he's just working away at us you know and he says but he said but if you're seated there you will use it and if you're ordained to do it what you do so we see this great uh great deception that goes on now because satan has an ambition there's a reason why he's doing what he's doing remember two spirits one's the spirit of god and god can only work by the eternal plan that he put in place because that has an end and that end has already been spoken and he can't deviate from the end which he spoke into existence and when he spoke it in the beginning he knew the timing by which he would bring every stage of that plan to pass and how it would come to pass everything's in perfect in tune with god everything's a hundred percent online so god in the beginning predestinated you thought the the plan chose the age that he would put you in chose the part that you would manifest chose the part that luther would manifest and his believers wesley the restoration of the gifts every part of it's planned by god but you don't play any of those other parts you're the astronaut church you're the blast-off church you're the church that goes past the moon and beyond satan had his greatest achievement shooting man from the earth and putting them in space that's man's greatest achievement is a man on the moon that's what they claim well god's achievements way past the moon you know see you soon but satan's got an ambition it was satan's ambition to be worshipped like god he took two-thirds of the stars of heaven ascended himself above those stars and preached to them and deceived two-thirds of them you see it all right notice that's his ambition now he is ready with his carefully selected educated bride by his own knowledge see all the painted up in his deceit of big buildings and big denominations and paints of knowledge and theology and smart and intellectual and educated to deceive the whole world and become a god that's what he's done he deceived the whole thing thinking that civilization civilization is good and education is good and science is good it's all alive that's what he's done all headed up in the person of the antichrist which is already crowned the vicar of god that's mr p-o-p-e the big potato it's what it is and now we see him coming out oh it's okay it's okay my children it's all right you can do that totally contrary to the word of god the scripture says it's an abomination now god headed up with all this science and education the god of this world sitting on the throne now condones all the worldly nonsense and says it's now under my throne i am now bringing god to your nonsense this is what's just this is what's right he said he says to become god he set it all up in in the person of the antichrist the vicar of god but his worldly loving scientific bride all dressed up in pomp of intelligence religious education she's made religious like him and by his own interpretation of the word of god as he did eve and his son cain he educated him he told them what the bible meant and he's still doing it he's still educating the church world what the bible means and there's a divine interpretation of the bible vindicated by the power of the resurrection and that's the only interpretation i am the way the truth the life no man comes to the father but by me nobody has any right to provide another way to the throne besides the shed blood of jesus christ and the shed blood of jesus christ separates you from unbelief because if you take his life the life that was in the blood in you it'll make you christ light and the spirit of god believes every word of god how can the spirit of god deny the word of god church there's something going on now the battle is on armageddon is here he's riding on this big uh white horse and his big pale horse deceiving going out deceiving and deceiving so it's going right on and that's exactly what it is he says this is choosing day either live for the day and die choose god and live and god is the word and the word is the word manifested for the hour and the day and let me tell you that's why people can act like they they you know oh i believe the message but they continually refer back to 2000 years ago they won't look at the word today they won't acknowledge that the almighty creator of heaven and earth returned in this day as he promised to put his foot on the land and the sea veiled in human flesh where man could see a man called william branham but the elected looked past the veil and saw that it was none other than jesus christ manifesting himself the same yesterday today and forever and if you don't believe that my friend and you're sitting under a ministry that don't recognize that you are deceived now call it god or call it the devil but if you're lukewarm i'll spill thee out of my mouth that's what's coming a bunch of lukewarm people that's what this move of satan's producing it's producing lukewarm that's all it's doing oh i would that you'd either be hot or cold but if you're lukewarm i'll spill thee out of my mouth and if you're afraid to confess me before man i'm afraid to confess you before my father you could play a tape in every service and never testify to what god's done in this day that's right but only the elect can he's your awful i base my salvation on that our salvation be should be based on the manifested word of god for our age you can't build an ark and float out of here you've got to be hid in the protection of god's message you remember the story this morning about the calf who's sitting there feeding on the things of god and he's all full and kicking up his heels full of vitamins because he's feasted in the barn the storehouse and he comes out on display and that old skinny weeded thing looks over there and goes such fanaticism such fanaticism to believe god veiled himself in flesh such fanaticism to believe that the works that he did we should do also such fanaticism to think that you're the elected lady such fanaticists are such fanaticism we got jesus we've got jesus just give me jesus where is he amen he's dwelling there's a union that's been taking place an invisible union between a heavenly bridegroom and an earthly bride there's been a oneness that has taken place where that word that will had arose and ascended had returned back on the day of pentecost went into the ground and then god's been counting back up through the church ages to where it comes into full maturity and they become one again and they did that through a message that was preached so they had something to become one with so you're not one with your own interpretation you're not one with your own mind you're not one with your own a moral standard you're not one with your own prophecy you've got to become one with the one that came up through the church ages and manifested himself in this age veiled in flesh standing with us to be recognized by those who are elected to see it and that's what they become what they become one with the word that he preached not one with the history because the others the god of this evil age in deception he says the choosing day he he says the day the day what do you call it man's day for you would say it's the day that the works by knowledge of man is glorified that's why it's man's day the works that man has done is glorified look at how i negotiated such a beautiful peace oh low low they'll say peace and safety and then shall come sudden destruction you know if somebody hates your guts for a lot of years and they've been wanting to take you out and all of a sudden they sit down with a grin and smile on their face say oh well let's just be buddies you better make sure they've been born again and the old man has passed away and all things have become new and that they're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus or they're just sitting there like a mule who laid his whole life just to kick you all this world is all shouting for joy because israel is making all these agreements with all these people that hate her guts they believe they're living in their land and they've got a temple that they need to build for muhammad to come back in and why do you think they want peace because they think peace is better for the end that they're trying to reach we are headed for some chaos in this world i'm sorry i got sidetracked because a man's is glorifying his own knowledge and the world today is dedicated themselves to the knowledge which came by satan and man's day is glorified not by the word of god but by the knowledge that he has now think let that soak in and when you play this tape back on this point stop for a while and think everything's about education everything's about science everything's about what we've accomplished everything what we do there's nothing about the power of god that's available to us do you understand that they're not preaching we've got a god in heaven that'll take care of us that loves us that we can call on you israel used to call on the name of the lord and what would they do they would hear plagues they would come under captivity they would be they would lose everything their crops their rain and everything god would bring a prophet up and say you've turned your way repent turn back to god call on the lame of god they'd scream out to god calling god god would have mercy on him because he had a promise to fulfill and he would restore him back you know why they don't call on god they don't want to have no promise left you know who's got the promise left the elect lady i'm sorry friends the world has no promise left from god but destruction that's it there's only one promise for god to fulfill that's to call his elect lady to have that elect lady go out and clean the fields to find the last one that she can come in and receive the resurrection life then this lady is leaving and that's the final showdown that will prove that satan is a dead-faced bald-faced pony soldier liar amen end the story come on brother gary preach something nicer there's nothing nicer but if you're elect you're you're you're praising god hallelujah i got the promise i saw the message it quick and deceited me i see it i believe it i've experienced the power of it give me the strength to use it lord lord help my unbelief he says let that soak in when you play this tape think about it so we got the word right here to go back and play the tape his works are exalted above god's word and manifested works the wisdom of satan which he give to eve at the beginning now listen don't miss this the wisdom of satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the vindicated word of god for the hour our churches prove that by their seminary schools of learning that learn more than god's word knows about it they know more than god does they know how to go about doing it a different way than god did it god's never changed his way repent or perish be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost this your seal until the day of redemption to keep you from the wiles of the devil they think they learn more than god word knows about it they think and there's doctors so and so and teachers so and so and professor so-and-so has exalted their own knowledge so called from satan truth above the vindicated promise of god made clear right before them and man fall for it all these guys all these teachers they're teaching their own revelation and here's an angel sent from god raised up the angel of the lord meets them tells him he's got a work for him to do tells him what the work will do tells him how he'll take the hand tells him how he'll discern the thoughts and intents tells him how that he'll break the mysteries of the seals and reveal the son of perdition reveal the god of this evil age reveal satan's eden to reveal the ladies in spirit and be totally vindicated and it happens but they've exalted themselves above the message now you say you call them christians you can't call them anything else but christians but they're anointed ones at the end time the anointing's right but their message is false because the rain falls on the just and the unjust that's how he deceives them he appears as an angel of light and it would deceive the very elected at possible do you understand god's going to bring you to the place where you've got to throw all your eggs in one basket this is the days of ananias and sapphira if you're holding back a little that little leaven will leaven the whole lump it'll start leveling your decisions it'll start leavening where you go what you do you'll end up working on sundays you'll end up putting tv in your house you'll end up doing all this stuff because you're not sold out you haven't seen what god's done we haven't seen the god of this evil age manifested and i've never seen an hour like this what's going on in this country what's going on in this world what's going on under this plague and the effect that it's having i've never seen a sign of deception like this time of deception that they fall for it let's close now let's watch it be manifested he says he is making a better world for them to live in by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of god but by his coming together in denominations and creeds and intellectual and science and so forth he's making a better world for man to live in and ignoring the promises of god and ignoring the promises of god i mean just look at what the campaign slogans are and how do you know you know civilization moved from east to west so america is the host and the manifestation of satan's eden revelations 13. it came over here under a religious pretense of serving god and freedom of religion and in 200 years has went farther from god than all the 6 000 years of civilization before it and look at their mottos make america great again there's only one person that can make america great and that's god and god ain't gonna do it sorry god ain't gonna do it prophet of god says it's a filthy stinking urinal in his nose he's done with it and what's the other one build back better they're saying the same thing can you imagine telling the same lie with two different stories oh the one's going to make you rich more money in your 40k more money in your bank account more jobs well that's lady osea blind miserable poor wretched and naked and don't think they need nothing you know the other one's going to bring you under their educational system and their government system and their mark of the beast it's the same spirit pick your devil that's all it is and one things they're picking the right and the other ones think they're picking the right and they tell people tell me why they voted for this guy and the other person tells me why they're vote guy and i thought wait a minute i think there's another candidate in another party somewhere there's someplace else for us to put our vote but not in this chaos but listen what they do okay god he says make better world for man to live in and ignoring the promises of god that the only time the world will be fit to live in is in the millennium you know my opinion he's made a better world to sin in instead of living no faith right no use of the promises of god he ignores the promises of god why doesn't our country use the promises of god instead of over here at ho2 clinic where you can go get tested for free if you want to find out whether you're positive or negative go find out sit home for two weeks and do nothing get it over with or go find somebody who knows got it and just put your arms around sister and sister brother and sisters get a good case of it go home and get sick and get up and become a christian again but no use of the promises of god today the ministers of dallas fort worth the believers will all be over at h2o on on uh davis boulevard or grapevine highway whatever it's called and they'll be laying hands on the sick and anointing with oil because god promised that he would deliver us from all our diseases we won't even go and pray for somebody that's got the virus we're afraid to get it and jesus has got leopards coming to him he's got maniacs coming to him he's got people possessed with devils that's coming to him and he doesn't say oh get your mask on you say why are you doing this i want you to catch the effect that it's having on your thinking we're letting this guy who thinks that he's made a better world for us to live in when he's made us a better world to disbelieve in what does he say listen to it closely he says making a better world and ignoring the promises of god that's what they're they're not used nobody uses the promises of god no more for nothing we don't use it to buy a house we don't use it to buy a car we don't use it about our sickness we don't use it about our jobs we just don't use them i'm not talking to you i'm talking about the country i'm talking about america i'm talking about the god of this evil age he says you don't need the promises of god you need my science you need my education you need my civilization forget that guy that lives up there in the sky because i'm not going to let you go there anyway you're here to serve me and my kingdom and my eden so please get to work because i want to be worshipped as god i want it to be better that's satan that's his attitude he don't care for you but i know one that does care for you no faith no use of the promises of god no power of god he's just he's goddess and and and and we see it and uh it and this is what he said watch the seed of god coming down through every age and watch where it's headed up today christians genuine christians are not are not all about scientific research and stuff real genuine christians aren't about scientific research and stuff no just a minute we'll get to that and we'll just come over and say this in closing but christ's little virgin word flock bride don't care for his knowledge they don't care for satan's knowledge they don't care what he's got to offer and when he offers it what's the one thing we all know about satan can anybody tell me what they know about satan he is a liar and there is no truth in him if he makes a promise he lies we got two of the biggest two-faced liars talking to america that ever exists there's only one person that has the truth i am the way the truth the life what jesus said and we got believers all up in a rally we've got believers getting caught up in privilege oh we're just not privileged the most privileged people in the world are people who have heard this message there's more believers in africa than there is any place in the world they are the most privileged people you say because they don't have anything the scripture says that he's come to those that are poor of this world rich in faith and revelation you're not going to be persecuted because of the color of your skin or because of your education because you're hispanic and everything that persecution is going to come down to because you believe god's word and you're going to keep god's word and you're not going to compromise god's word then you'll be persecuted then they will kill you thinking they're doing god a service why would anybody want to get caught you know what we need we you get the baptism of the holy spirit you've got the love of god shed abroad in your heart you you know there's only one life that matters to you and that's eternal life but you go you go the mile for anybody i don't care what they know what they think how they look how they dress how they smell different cultures got different smells i know but you don't care you got one place we're going out of here we're going up we've got a rapture we've got to make we've got a place that we've got to be we've got a condition that we've got to be in the rapture's a condition it's not a time event when the church gets a revelation and the full knowledge of words god then they get the rapturing faith that was hid in the revealed seven sails then they will leave we put our shoulders i said lord i know i'm not a good preacher i understand that but there's anything i can do to bring this gospel to this world make an opening for me make a dough i got good ministers here that can keep the church while i'm gone lord use me in this last thing let me go pray for the sick let me go tell the truth let me preach the gospel let me call on the power of the resurrection to come down let me put the promises of god into action but i don't want to let this lying stinking snail trail devil get away with what he's getting away with anybody want to take the sword and stand with me say she she don't care for his knowledge she keeps free of him she don't care for her stuff you know what he sugar coated it to what started to taste pretty good someone said burma gear should i get food stamps i said i don't care if you go get food stamps i paid for them i'd rather have somebody i know get them should i go to school yeah go to school get an education just don't trust it it's full of lies it's full of deceit [Music] just don't put any confidence in it don't trust it you want to buy a house buy a house don't get so attached to it that you have to work on sundays to pay the mortgage then you can't go to church why sacrifice some lousy 2 000 square foot three thousand square foot every square foot you live in believe it or not you only live in a little inch right in here but why sacrifice for something that's going to be destroyed why put yourself under burden instead of being content we're doing it it's going on it's happening the backsliding is on that's the effect of this world is to get this church to backslide and it's had its effect but i believe the gospel that's been preached by a messenger has starting to come to the church and say put on the breaks stop going that way renew yourself again get in your closet renew yourself again get the spirit of god in yourself get the sin out apply the token apply the unbelief let the love of god be shed abroad in your heart don't keep that love locked up inside of you you don't use it you get cold a cactus used to be something with flowers now it's withered up with thistles i'm glad there's be no thorns or thistles over there she keeps free of him now let's talk about her a minute she waits for her lord and his millennium honeymoon right with the word groom as she is the word bride knowledge and civilization and true christianity has nothing in common civilization and true christianity has not one thing in common i think it's purging time sorry if i took long i'm sorry if i got carried away but i'm telling you something's got to change i mean this thing has got us down to 25 30 people in church we're afraid you know my letter that i wrote was for you to make a decision you know i it's not us to keep you away it was to give you a way out if you didn't want to come to church here's 25 reasons why you don't have to come the only group that i set aside is that high risk group of 65 and above and i thank god i've tested many time and i'm negative i thank god for that because i'm in contact with a lot of people but the decision is going to be how are you going to go forward how long this thing is whole purpose of this is that's what he wants to do he you know the devil is trying to use science and and you know in to make this word of none effect we're going to have to realize something is going on it's affecting our thinking it's affecting our actions it's affecting what we do how we pray what times were taken the whole thing in the countdown was god had an achievement and satan has an achievement he's working his achievement he's achieving what he wants to do he's getting the believers into an in effectual condition he's succeeding and you don't think he's got any more bugs up his sleeve the whole world's going to be full of plagues there's going to be another plague after this one and another plague after that one and and they're going to come down to a time where and it's almost now they're actually preaching now that if you have children you're a curse to mankind and we've got sisters in our church that pray to god every day that they have a child and the world's killing them by the thousands and i don't even think we got a glimpse of how wicked and evil this time is that we're living in we've got soft and blinded we need to shake ourselves he's having his effect the god of this evil age has supplanted the word of god with knowledge science civilization and their worldly political leadership go read the seals political power and the power of the church joined together as one force and comes in this last day as a pale horse rider and deceives everybody nobody has a vision nobody knows which is right nobody can they become children not worthy of strong strong meat not being able to discern between good and evil he's working and what he's doing is working isn't it time what god is starts working isn't there a time for a people to cry out lord work the message in me work the message in me lord work the message in me let my light so shine amongst men that my works will glorify the father in heaven and lord let me go to an upper room somewhere let me shake off the influence of this world let me come alive oh god let the word of promise be on my lips i i i'm afraid for the church i'm afraid that that he's turning us into electronic church people don't come to service they plan church when they want to that's fine do what you want to do but some morning you won't be able to dial up the rapture when it's convenient you won't be able to go so lord today's the time i want to go home here i'd like to put in here two o'clock rapture it's on his terms on his time by his word all these ask us to do is be attentive to it so i'm asking you individually in your own heart in your own life are you on fire for god the way you should be are you testifying because if you're afraid of me before men i'll be ashamed of you before my father are you working for the kingdom of god if you're trying to cut yourself out a swath in this world at best you might have 85 years then what what if it profiled a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul store up your treasures in heaven where they don't gain moth where a thief doesn't come in and take them yeah you don't think this government will come in and take your money your income tax you whatever amount they want to we render to caesar what's caesar you see a mask on i'm okay with you wearing the mask that's rendering to caesar what caesar but don't give him your mind and your soul and your life keep that for your husband amen and and i just encourage you all to just have a personal moment with him take the god of this evil age read it and look at what's gone on in the science and the knowledge in this world and this world is so far away from eden we've got a few glimpses in the mountains and we've got a few glimpses here and there but oh it hasn't even entered into our hearts the things that god's prepared for us let's let's let's return church to the message of the hour let's return to the absoluteness of the gospel in our lives and let's take the beautiful calling of god for us to come into action let's take it seriously and let's turn into that statue of a perfect man that he's wanting us to come into is that your heart's desire that's my heart's desire amen i'm not what i used to be and i'm thankful for that i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i ought to be but i know i'm not what i used to be and i thank god for that but let us go forward leaving those things which are behind pressing for the higher calling in christ jesus god bless you let stan brother philly if you'd come please my friend and help us tonight oh my the god of this evil age has been totally exposed by the revealed word of the hour let us pray i know some may listen to this sermon later because it's been recorded and i know the anointing doesn't follow the recordings like it is in the presence of the house of the lord but we know on the tapes that the anointing is still there because it's been predestinated to be there for the elect but if you're listening later [Music] i just ask you to take a moment to ask yourself what effect is this present evil having on your christian life and your walk what effect is it having on your attitude on your atmosphere on your disposition are the joy bills still ringing or are you slowly falling to the depression and the doubt that's swirling around lord it's almost zero in order of eyes to title this i would title it blast off time it's time for us to leave it's time for us to get ready it's time for us to look up because our redemption draws nigh it's time for us to be about the father's business it's time for us to carry out the commission it's time to get our loved ones in the ark it's time to call him in under the scarlet thread it's time to call him into the upper room to kneel down with someone and have them pray through how long has it been since you've knelt down with somebody and prayed through with them till they received the holy ghost how long has it been since you knocked on someone's door one of your friends and say friend i i really want to share with you the promise of this hour lord
