precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you this evening thank you musicians nice to be here let's turn in our bibles to the book of romans and we'd like to read start with the 33rd verse i this is romans the 8th chapter and the 33rd verse romans 8 the 8th chapter and the 33rd verse i've i always liked this scripture but it said who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifier who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loveth us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things presence nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus amen we'd like to look at that scripture 37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loveth us heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you certainly always wonderful to be in the house of the lord and to fellowship around the things of the lord i guess we scared a lot of people away this morning but that's okay um it it is a a wonderful thing to uh hear the lord and know that the lord's speaking to you i'd like just to read with us you this evening and you should be able to put the statements up on the board but a message came on to my heart and it's called the mighty conqueror and i believe it was preached in 1958 i believe the mighty conqueror and it struck me that paul said here that we are more than conquerors so we're conquerors and i don't think that we look at ourselves as being conquerors i think a lot of times our approach is that we want to avoid conflict but yet it's given to us to fight and so we want to do that i don't want to forget well it's on my mind levi i think it was your birthday right god bless you and then also it's brother billy's birthday tomorrow so everybody call billy tomorrow and bother him all day long with text and phone calls and everything i think it would really be good for him if he got about a hundred text in phone calls tomorrow just wishing him happy birthday and uh and as we certainly appreciate him here but uh you know what i was saying is that that paul tells us that we're more than conquerors so we're victorious victorious and and you know in this world there's always been many conquerors men that have went out and they felt that they conquered something they even they we could look at uh hitler he thought that he conquered france and europe and his goal was to conquer the world but he ended up being a miserable failure we look at constantine he tried to go out and conquer the whole world i remember when i was a young lad i i always uh i studied and read about attila the hun because he went out and conquered all the world and and the chinese in them were so afraid of the mongolians and and all the conquerors that they built a wall to try to keep them out the the great wall of china and uh so we find that that men have tried to conquer and tried to overtake the world and i thought one of the ones that brother branham brought to us was he talked a little bit about napoleon and if he says this in uh in the message there he said he says in i don't know let me he put this back here he says he says napoleon we all know was a being a great man but he started out on a good path when he was a young man at the age of 33 and this is a paragraph five out of the mighty conqueror if you wanted to put it up he a great man when he was a young man at the age of 33 had conquered the world and after he had whipped everybody in the world in all the nations he sat down and wept because there was no one else to whip and he died at the early age and alcoholic when he started off he was a prohibitionist but when he died he was an alcoholic he was so feared by the world i was reading a little book there in the airport that said that the women that night when they went to put the little babies in the bed as many mothers say if you don't go to sleep the old booger man's going to come and get you why they were frightened their babies more by saying that the napoleon was going to get them because he was such a murderer the little fellow when he would write their little eyes and slip under the covers real quick because they thought that the mighty napoleon would get him but he was defeated because he never played by the rules of the game you know that's something to think that in order to be a conqueror you have to play by the rules and he said all these great men that started out they all failed because they never played by the rules just remember as we keep reading just remember this that's a good lesson for the church of the living god if we don't play the game according to the rules we'll be just call disqualified at the end you have to keep the rules of the game to win and if the rules of the game in this place is a man must be born again to enter into the fellowship of christ and his church and we might be the greatest denomination on earth but if we haven't played the rules of the game we'll be disqualified at the end that's a rule that a man must be born again to to play the game and be successful so don't substitute anything for the rules of the game amen and we've got to come straight with god's rules if it isn't it it isn't our rules it's his rules and we've got to abide by we're running the race according to his rules and we have to abide in them so you see napoleon after though being a great warrior and a great conqueror he conquered people under fear and that's not the rule of the game the rule of the game is to conquer by love amen you know that still the greatest power that there is is the power of love and you can't conquer by fear you can't conquer by proving somebody's wrong you can't conquer by lifting yourself up above them that you've got the knowledge of the truth and you've got the wisdom of god we've got to play this game and run this race by the rules and the rule is that of the game is be conquered by love there's no other force in the world as great as love and i'm almost sure that we as people have put too much emphasis upon other rules that i don't mean to be rude but sometimes that we've made ourselves and put so much stress on the rules only to find ourselves disqualified oh my can you imagine if we could just let that sink in just the moment that we've got to play by the rule and our rule is we must be born again and that love is what we win the victory i'll tell you you can have a friend and you know i don't believe that we ought to run with the world but there's people in the world that we meet that they're friends and they're friendly too and and we come and contact them especially at school you've got to have fellowship you're put together with a lot of different people you've got to let that light shine and you've got to love them and people can sense the power of love and just think of that what if martin luther would have played the rules of the game right there never would have been a methodist church just think of that if martin luther would have kept with the bible and he would have loved the people and he he would have never got off the word of god and he would stay just with the scripture you know the next revelation martin luther would have got would have been sanctification and then after that he would have got baptism of the holy spirit and the word would have been restored in that aim but he left the rule and he went and he started out on his own thing building his own thing like we said this morning he put a tabernacle up and he let the people do that to him he said if martin luther there would have never been a methodist church if the methodists had played the rules of the game right there would have never been a pentecostal church but if we fail to play the rules of the game right god will disqualify us and raise up out of these stones children to abraham god wants the game played right and we must do it so it doesn't make any difference how much we feel like we're progressing on until we get back to the rule of the game we're really not going anywhere just think of that what it what it means in the paragraph 10 he says this he said and the strongest force that i know of is love though i speak with tongues in the midst of an and of tongues of men and angels and have not love i am nothing or because as some sounding brass and a tinkling symbol though i have power to move mountains and have not love i am nothing you know we always lean a lot on demonstration that seems to be something that people want to see i want to see the demonstration i want to see the power and people just preach and preach miracles and and i do i preach a church that ought to have power church that ought to be able to lay hands on the sick and have them require recover a church that that is about the father's business but the rule is it's governed by love if if it isn't that strong force then it's nothing so if we're going to play this game as we would call it we're going to win we've got to get back to the winning principles all these great signs and wonders that we have seen to god we give praise but if those things isn't built upon godly christian love and respect for god in his people it'll fail just it's just got to fail because it has no foundation amen and this great thing this great foundation of love just think of that now you've got to remember that we're in a contest we have to conquer and we're more than conquerors but we're more in conquerors when we abide in the rules and the rule is to be borne again and the rule is to love and when we stay in those places and we stay in that humility we will conquer everything all these men were mighty conquerors but they didn't follow the rules and now we hear a messenger telling this church you've got to follow the rules and so many many run out and and they try to do something they try to produce something they they try to make something happen they try to persuade somebody and then we know that we've been taught that if you can change somebody's mind somebody can change it back again but when a person sees that you're coming to him from the foundation of love that that that you conquer by love because then we realize that that's the rules of the game what a what a great uh rule if we look went to paragraph uh 17 he said no napoleon was defeated as a drunken maniac at the age of 33 but at the age of 33 christ played the game right and he conquered death hell sickness and the grave never was a conqueror like him and never could be ladies and gentlemen and my brothers and sisters it's time tonight for the church to pick up that which christ left us this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other and take up the sword of self-sacrifice and get back to the old gospel line again going out to conquer our enemy conquer him by love by the same thing that god god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have eternal life amen it's time for the church to pick up back where he left us he'll know that you are my disciples by one your love one for another you know a lot of times we live in the church and never engage with anybody in the assembly we have our fellowship said on sunday morning but but our love ought to reach past sunday morning our concerns ought to reach past sunday morning the church isn't about this building it isn't about building more room for us it's not about all of us following something that we believe because we've all heard a message but it goes beyond that when you hear that message that message has got to be lived by the rule and that rule is a love and a concern and going the extra mile let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus let every man look upon the needs of the other before himself you see we can go on and create a great comfort zone in what we believe and we can be playing the game and forget the rules the rules you've got to be born again what does it mean to be born again you kind of have a new nature put in you new desires put in your heart you've got to you've got to play by by those rules and that's what jesus conquered by he conquered by love he so loved his brethren they were his kinsmen their names was on the lamb's book of life brother and so that's why he could raise up that i believe it was drivers daughter because he looked back down through the time and saw that her name was written on the lamb's book of life and she was part of eternal life so that's why he could call her spirit back and and he had that love for his own the scripture said he loved his own and they didn't receive them and they refused them the scripture says that he loved them even until the end he loved them that that's what he conquered by he conquered by the the love of god shed abroad in his heart and that's how we conquer by the love of god shed abroad in our heart and he said that's what the church needs to do it needs to take a sword of self-sacrifice and get back to the old gospel line again going out to conquer our enemy conquer him by love by the same thing that god god so loved the world you know we're more than conquerors and i really feel this i wish i had a better way of expressing it and and i could be more of a powerful preacher to get it to you but just being a pastor sometimes i just have to say things in a simple way but i really believe that god is trying to get the church to get engaged you know what i mean to carve our way into people's lives by the love and by the power of the word of god but by laying for ourselves a pattern of good works i don't think he ever intended for us to huddle in a little group and pat one another on the back and say we believe this and we believe that and we believe this and we believe that and we're the elected we're the bride we're the ones we're we were the only ones that got truth we're the only ones that's baptized right praise god as us and no more like i said i thought sometimes we ought to name the church you know we're right and everybody else is wrong tabernacle they know you're right when you've got the love of god shed abroad in your heart by the holy spirit that's how they know we're right because we're playing by the rules we're not just collecting money we're not just building gymnasiums for our children we're not just uh doing stuff for our group we're not promoting our group we're promoting him and we're pronouncing what he brings to a person's life when he comes into a person's life and transforms them that's what we're bringing we want to bring that love we want to bring that peace we want to bring that joy people are miserable you know it's not a time for us to withdraw it's a time to take the bushel off our candle and let it shine it's time to get back to the thing and when he was on earth adam's race had many fears and it's true they still have them but they shouldn't have them as arnold van winkler ended the war once and for all christ won once and for all at calvary verse 18 or paragraph 18. when he was here on earth he walked up to a sick man that sickness had bound the human race and he said thou spirit of the devil i charge thee come out of the man he conquered the devil and when a man laid in the grave dead he conquered death for the man or sickness when the maniac come out to destroy him and the main maniac realized that he was the son of god he said oh if you'll cast us out suffer us to go into the bunch of hogs for he knew the authority that jesus had he conquered the devil and everywhere he met him he conquered the devil everywhere he met him no just think of that don't we believe that he lives in us that he walks with us that he goes with us and he conquers the devil every place that he meets him every time you meet the devil we are more than conquerors every place we meet the devil we are we are engaged in a battle of contrast every time we meet the devil is what he's shining and what we're shining what he's testifying to and what we're testifying too every time we come into conflict he is a conqueror over the devil wherever he met the word of god works any time any place anywhere any situation he's a such a great conqueror he conquered the devil everywhere he met him and he not only conquered in himself but he left the commission to the church that anything that you ask in my name that will i do oh think of it he was a conqueror but he left it for us to conquer but if we'll play by the rules we'll make sure we're born again and we've been justified and sanctified and filled with the holy spirit and we'll make sure that the love of god is in our heart and we're free from bitterness now we can take that commission and we can meet the enemy on every ground because he was the mighty conqueror and he commissioned us with him that we could conquer anything listen to this great next statement 19. i i just think this is one of the things that we we fail to see how simple god is and how he can use you satan might beat you down you think oh i'm nothing you know well that's true that's what nickelodeon spirit was that people got thinking they were nothing and they got thinking the preachers had all the power there ain't a preacher in the land that's got any more power than the simplest believer in this room god's not a respecter of persons gifts and callings are without repentance just because a man can preach the gospel doesn't believe he is the gospel it's you know it's blessed those that hear the word of god and that word abides within them he said he says you can conquer anything that you ask in my father's name that will i do fight will fight with what's in your hands if it's singing the gospel if you can't do nothing but whistle whistle just as loud as you can for the glory of god if you can't do no more than pat your hands pat them conquer with whatever you've got in your hand clap them in such a way that all the neighbors will love you whistle in such a way that all the denominations will know that you belong to christ conquer them play the game fair play it right amen get involved get back in the game you see i don't know what to do whistle there used to be this song i don't know what it came from i think it might have came from snow white or something but i remember hearing it whistle well you work whistle clap your hands till all the denominations know that your thing my neighbor took me to a great play at the baptist church and they they said something that was so inspiring to me i shouted amen they knew they had a pentecostal in their mint i mean the whole place shut down like i was rude i thought praise god i got something they don't amen you got to stand up you got to be involved he's not going to let his church sit on the sidelines because they can never mature into what that they're called to be unless they're on the battleground remember when he wanted to take that great leader wanted to have somebody ride in his cart with them it may have been napoleon i'm not sure but as he he went by the generals and the and the everybody came there and and and he went back and he saw this old hardened soldier with scarves and everything that's the person he wanted in his cart that's what god's looking for he's looking for battle veterans you say well i i'm just 14 i'm just 15. you can get in the battle amen you can be an example at a young age you can do what's right you cannot sass back you can say yes sir yes ma'am no sir no ma'am you can be polite you can be on the battleground you can you can treat all the the children and all your friends equally don't get with a couple little girls and side up and form little clicks and somebody else comes and wants to walk alongside each of you and you walk all the faster because it's us three and no more where's that stuff at you know what i mean that's the beginning of politics that's the beginning of clicks no stop come on join in we love one another you know just don't reach out for the most popular guys or the guy bring somebody in maybe someone that's shy maybe somebody that's not you know is a little kind of drawn back invite them in draw a bigger circle amen he says play it right we're living in a day that when this social gospel is becoming prominent when the churches are uniting themselves together and making a social religion and binding themselves together it's a terrible day they're trying to take all the deity and all the glory away from christ and trying to make him just a prophet if christ was just a prophet where everyone lost he was more than a prophet he was a conqueror he was a a a mighty conqueror and if we're one with him and we're united with him and his spirit dwelleth in us then we become conquerors we're more than conquerors with him that loved us oh what a what a call to the church to dust off our weapons and get back in the battle get back in the fight engage your neighbor engage the people around you engage the world spread your spread your cheer and your joy unspeakable to share the essence of what makes you what you are the love of god abounding in your heart towards many you know i think that anything this message has become so withdrawn and so pulled in that we've almost formed ourselves into a big clique and let me tell you sure they'll reject us as a whole but we don't care about the whole we care about the one we care about the last one we care about the one that's stuck in there that's in bondage and is thirsting and hungering for life that's who we care for that's why we're in the battle that's why our testimony is on the front line that's why our spirits are on display in case there's that little hungry eagle down in that chicken yard and they see an eagle go by in their life and there's something that says i want that i want to be a part of that what is that brother jackson we're sorry that he's home not feeling well and gary's not feeling well but that's good because their testimony goes together you know what brought gary to this message was the simple fact that jackson would never cuss he said man i just watched him every day waiting for him to cuss he said i knew there was a cuss word in there somewhere and i knew something was going to happen that was going to make him cuss or curse or whatever you want to call it nothing ever would but one day he just had to inquire how come you don't cuss and jackson couldn't say i but i just never did cuss i i grew up not cussing just never cussed in my life no uh no he said something changed me he was playing by the rules and when you play by the rules you win and and and so we we just read paragraph 24 he said the sickness he never preached a funeral now that's something didn't it i mean i don't think you can go through the bible and ever find out where jesus preached the funeral he showed up late to a funeral and he ruined it he did he doesn't showed up late and so because he was late he just raised the guy from the dead that's how you take care of being late to a funeral amen he was a mighty conqueror he's the mighty conqueror and we are more than conquerors i love this he said the sickness he never preached a funeral death couldn't stay in his presence how could death and life dwell together they can't do it that's the reason today brother when the church is born again of the spirit of god death and life can't hold together something takes place christ comes in and conquers our passions he conquers our desires he conquers all that's ungodly about us and because he lives we live also he conquers everything that's ungodly he's already did it it lays at our hands just to receive you see what will happen to a church when we start playing by the rules when we start loving unders we sit around all the time talking about the great word that's been revealed the great mysteries that we understand how that the son of man ministry came forth and how god veiled himself in a prophet until that it was actually jesus christ in our midst using a fleshly skin to be present in our day doing the same signs and wonders but we can witness so far above people's head that like we're trying to contact their intellect when we ought to be when we ought to be just so down to earth wanting to share with them these great benefits and continuing out of paragraph 24. we see him in his earthly minister ministry as a conqueror certainly we do but now let's watch him after he died he still went on conquering so he ain't done conquering he ain't done conquering on your behalf and he ain't done converting you into a conqueror amen you know if the devil's got one of your loved ones go after him go to praying go to lana before god go to ask god to do things jesus even give the parable of the unjust judge and the the i believe it was a widow that besought him and he didn't answer he answered her to get her off his back give this woman what she wants i don't want her in my court anymore and he says how much more a father that loves you which one of you as earthly parents if your child asks for a fish you'd give them a a a serpent or ask for bread you'd give them a stone he said how much more your heavenly father amen can you imagine when you go to say you know what i'm tired of that spirit on my child i'm tired of that spirit on my loved one satan i've come to meet you with the word of god i've come to meet you with every promise i'm going to play by the rules i'm going to let my love shine to everybody that i come in contact with i'm going to make sure my life's borne again i i've come to play the game and i like that analysis we don't play to lose in fact we've already won but now let's watch him after death he still went on conquering he never ended at the grave the bible said his soul descended into hell and he preached to the spirits that were in prison that repented not in the long suffering of the days of noah i can see him as the heavens and the earth turning black the rocks at belched out of the mountains the whole heavens the moon the stars refused to shine he conquered it and when he went down and descended down and knocked at the door where those lost souls was and when the doors came open and those people who laughed and made fun of enoch and made fun of noah i can hear him say i am that one that enoch said would come with ten thousands of his saints why didn't you believe enoch why didn't you believe noah everything had to know that he conquered everybody has a right to know that jesus conquered you're that messenger and when he shut the door on them the days of mercy was passed and on down into the lowest pits of hell he went and he knocked at the city doors of the devil's hell and the devil come to the door and as we could look to see and there he said well here you are after all i sure thought i had you when i killed the prophets i sure i sure thought i had you when i had john's head cut off in prison but now after all you've got here hi that devil he think oh here you are you know i can hear him as he said straighten it himself up and said satan i am the virgin-born son of the living god my blood still wet on the cross i paid the price i've conquered and i've come down to take over strip you of everything that you claim that you had reached over to his side and jerked those keys of death and hell off of him kicked him back into the place where he belonged he conquered hell and he rose and he had the keys of death and hell hanging on his side what's the church scared about then amen he conquered satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he's on his road out remember there's some more faithful than when went on to they were in a place called paradise and they could not go into the presence of god because they had worshipped under the shed blood of lambs and goats and so forth it never divorced sin it's only covered sin just think of that they didn't they weren't they weren't in hell but they still couldn't enter into paradise because they were on the covered blood but when the shed blood come that's why they came out of their graves and many walked and that was the first resurrection hallelujah and that's it today friends you can't cover your sins and get in you've got to get rid of it and there's only one thing that will do it and it isn't your church that isn't your baptism by water it's the blood of jesus christ that covers sin and divorces it and the only means of conquering that there is is through the blood of the lord jesus amen isn't that wonderful just think of it as we read these last statements and and we go on what is it he saw something real it's the story of burke you all know it what is it he saw something real he saw something that wasn't put on he saw something that wasn't hypocritical he saw something that was genuine and there on the snowy bank i led that cruel hunter cruel hunter hardened hunter to the lord jesus christ and he became a sweet humble christian why all the preaching didn't do it it was he saw something real oh church of the living god the world's looking for something real tonight would you love to have enough christ in your heart that you could stand in the face of death even you sick people that's sick could you just take him at his word live or die stand here on his word you that's had these differences and all these little troubles denominational barriers wouldn't you love to have something to display that when you walk down the street men and women say if there's ever was a godly woman or man there it goes something real a life that tells isn't that what we want a life that tells and i think that this is what he's saying when we can come into the unity of that every member in this church realizes that they're part of this great con conquering army then everybody in our hearts in our lives realizes that we're called to put something on display that's real and that's genuine and if we live by those rules we lay aside all the bitterness all the differences and we know that he's conquered all these things for us and in him we're more than able and when we can come into that humility of the spirit and realize we're more than conquerors and we can bring our christianity and live it by the rules not by the doctrines but by the rules i think that we will see and as i say in closing i feel such a pull of the spirit to the sons and daughters of god to get involved to put that life on display to step out and show this world that you truly are the sons and daughters of god let's stand together let us bow our heads and maybe even any that's listening at home tonight [Music] i'd just like to ask and for you to look at your own heart and your own spirit maybe you've been a little bit in the closet as a christian [Music] and you've been a little timid to and reserved and [Music] maybe you haven't been in the battle [Music] you haven't laid for yourself a pattern of good works [Music] you never step out of your complex to reach out to someone [Music] and you just seem like you're all bottled up [Music] and you like to lift your hands and say lord i'm more than a conqueror i can overcome this complex lord i can be conscious when i walk into the grocery store that my light is shining when i get out of my car and i enter the workplace that my light is shining lord i'm mindful that i'm your witness that i'm a living epistle read of all men and lord that you're tugging on my heart [Music] in your calling join the battle my daughter join the battle my son we've already won the victory we're more than conquerors go in that lost soul go tell the world about the resurrection power go tell them about the stripes that healed them and the prophet said i'm going to fight if i can't testify i'm going to whistle i'm gonna hum i'm gonna sing i'm gonna clap my hands still everybody knows i serving a risen living savior and he lives in my heart oh lord i pray that the bushel baskets will come off the candles of god and that their good works will shine and glorify our father which is in heaven father i trust that we feel the pull tonight to be drawn into service everyone entering into the service of self-sacrifice and getting back to where christ left us oh god i i know it sounds like a simple but that's what you said the church needs to do is to get back to the old-fashioned simple gospel father we've turned it into such a mystery that it doesn't have much earthly value anymore lord let us bring the great revelations that we have into a living testimony we ask that you would grant that tonight in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen help me sing it i hear the calm [Music] is [Music] and i begin my mind [Music] is
