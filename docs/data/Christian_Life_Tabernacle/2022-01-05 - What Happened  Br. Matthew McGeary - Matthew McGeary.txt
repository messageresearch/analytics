Description:
What Happened?
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Evening Service: January 5, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

name amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the lord let's just turn in our bibles to second peter chapter one i trust everybody's having a a good new year you know you get a little bit older and you find the only thing that changes is a number you know the bills keep coming and and you got to keep going to work and and but one thing we know as believers we're one step closer we're one day closer to the catching away to the translation of our body so we're certainly that's what we're living for amen spreading out a second peter chapter one we'll read verse 10 through 19 it says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly and to the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance and that's uh maybe where i'm going to be drawing some inspiration for a text this evening and as we continue reading it says knowing that shortly i must put off this tab my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ has showed me moreover i will endeavor that ye may be able to after my deceased to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunning devised fables when we known unto you the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ but we but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellence glory this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard and we we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto ye do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the daystar arise in your hearts amen we just asked a blessing upon the word you may be seated i mean just starting into just something that was maybe a little bit on my heart as we had the new year uh coming in and we we just read this scripture here where in verse 13 it says yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you into remembrance and it might seem like an odd text to uh title the sermon this way but we'll just see how the lord would lead but i want to maybe speak on a thought what happened maybe as a question what happened because here paul he's saying i want to put you into remembrance so something has taken place uh something has been said and so paul is saying look i know that you know these things i know that you're established in the truth but he said as long as i'm in this tabernacle i see that it's me that i'm going to remind you of these things i'm going to stir you up i'm going to put you into remembrance and so maybe as we just move along this evening that's something that's on our heart we just want to put you in the remembrance of what god has done we want to put you in a remembrance of what he said we want to put you in remembrance of what has taken place in your life and i say as long as i'm in this tabernacle i want to do my job to remind you of what god has done to remind you what he's done in your life and to remind you what he said because if the prophet paul could stand there say look i think it's needful that i do this as long as i'm in this tabernacle i'm going to remind you even though you're established in them even that you're established in the truth and you know these things i think it's me that i remind you and many times you might feel that a minister might stand behind the pulpit and he says the same thing over and over and over well in one way maybe he could only preach what's been revealed to him but if it's the word of god then i can say as long as we're reminding you of the word and what god has done and what he's said then you can take faith in that word and let it have an effect in your life amen so just in this this thought of what happened you know uh you go into the new year and and and you might see that uh the news channels and things will say well what what happened in the year 2021 and maybe uh certain political agendas they'll say well well this happened and this this government did this and and this this democrat said that and they they go they go back and maybe they give like a highlight of of what took place in the year 2021 and then maybe from from that standpoint you know they they might see an area where they could have done better or they wonder why they well what happened why did that happen and and then they say well how are we going to change those things you know what are we going to do in this coming new year and 2022 year that that that we don't get the same results that we can actually make some decisions and and put things in order that that this doesn't happen again because many times that's the question you know that's on the heart or or in a personal life or in business or in the government when something happens everybody wants to know what happened you know how did we get to this place what what was the demise how did we get here you know and i was just as i thought upon this thought i remember uh uh years back when i wasn't serving god i'm you know i i guess i can just y'all know i've god called me from a life of sin and and i i had ended up being uh and you know as having to spend the the weekend uh behind some of those uh steel made bars they they put in some places and i remember i'd got out and i was just wandering i i just you know i you just having to go forward and figure out to get to a phone or make a phone call and and as i was walking down the street i saw another gentleman there he's kind of maybe in the same boat just kind of drifting along down the road and and and i kind of just walked up there by him and said hello to him and we got to talking and you know he come to find out the man was homeless and and then you you know you're like what's your story what happened to you and then you you start to find out that that some of these things you know many times we might see somebody's condition or you see where they're at and and you're completely void of understanding we're so quick to cast judgment and so quick to assume and and here this man was homeless and he he said well you know i had i had a good job and i had a good home and and you know i had a good car i was i was paying my bills uh but i got a traffic ticket and i and something led to another to where they actually repo'd my car and i i couldn't go to my i couldn't go i lost my job and i couldn't get my car back and i lost my home and and just it was like a whirlwind before you know it i was out on the streets and so you find out when you talk to this this man in his condition maybe you would look at him and you would assume well well here's a guy homeless he doesn't want to get out and work he maybe he's never had anything but you you find out that sometimes when you find out what happened it gives a completely different perspective i'm reminded of when the prophet of god would tell the story of how there was this drunk on the side of the road and he had went over to help him there and and he was trying to stand up the man and he kept on uh falling over and he he finally got him to a place where he could be stabilized and he said you know look i was i was the president up there of that bank and the prophet would go okay well you know what what happened what what happened you say well you know i had a good job i had a wife and i had a family and and everything was going good but but i i got home one evening and and there was a as he called it a dear john letter and his wife had decided to leave him and and you know instead of him in that calamity and then that hardship the only thing he could think to do was to go down to the bar and go down to the saloon and start drinking away his sorrows and before you know it this man of prestige who who had a position in a bank and he was the president there and he he had a nice home and a nice family but just in an instance it seemed uh from one uh from one something that happened and all sudden from another decision before he even knew it now he's just a drunk on the side of the road what happened oh you know my family fell apart and i i took up drinking and and you know that's why i'm at where i am that at now you know when you ask the question what happened to begs an answer how many of you have asked your kids what happened you know there's this commotion and there's this fight and there's the screaming or something anybody ever dealt with that my my house the only one you know the kids are they're fussing and they're fighting and and and all of a sudden it sounds like somebody died you're like what happened and and you you want to know look i i need information here i please tell me what happened so i can start to get the facts and i can start to understand and we can work through what is going on here because i need to know what's happened you know as we think of that question you know maybe i'd ask you what happened in your life in 2021 what did you go through what did you do what did you deal with maybe you had heartache maybe you had uh milestones maybe you had some accomplishments that you're uh you're proud of maybe you feel like all you did is work and get older maybe you just feel the cares of life just continuing to to press on and and you're doing the best that you know how you're taking care of the family maybe you're taking care of the home and and my you just you just feel like you're you're to the grind and and you look back and you're like well i just maybe i i was i was trying to raise the family i was trying to do my best with the kids i was trying to take care of the home well brother matthew what do you mean what happened i look back at 2021 and and maybe there's no nothing a significant no highlight that that sticks out to you but i want to maybe make a parallel here because i would say that that that the way that you feel i i believe that sarah must have felt the same way here sarah was given a divine promise that she's the one that's supposed to be bringing forth the promised son but oh how many times in her life would it seem discouraging maybe abraham would be asking sarah sarah is if you feel a change is anything happening what's going on it's like well no no i don't it doesn't seem like anything's happening right now you know it didn't seem like anything great was happening in sarah's life all she could say is look i'm i'm just getting older i'm getting weaker i i have no ability within myself to bring forth this promised son that that you're wanting and we've certainly tried to bring it past in our own ways and we made a mess of things even so much so and that melchizedek would come there and stand in the tent door you know that there was something in her at that time where she would even laugh in her heart because she's like how me an old lady how could i even even have pleasure with my lord but i want to say no matter how hopeless it looks no matter how impossible it seems now just make you know put your spiritual thinking cap on because we're not just called to come here and have a good job and get a good education and try to get some nice things and and get a family and have some kids and die that's not why you're here that is not the purpose that god has intended for you in your life but god has something specific a specific thought that he had in his mind before the world was formed and he had thought you know when the world is falling apart when when satan's eden gets such to a condition where it's this bad and it's in the most evil age that it's ever been i'm going to have a group of people on the face of the earth that despite all of the wickedness and despite all the lewdness and everything that's in the land i'm going to have a people that are going to take sides with my word they're going to believe me no matter what comes their way to think that god has allowed 50 60 years to go and the prophet's gone off the scene i don't think there's anybody here that could raise their hand and say i was in brother branham's meeting i don't think there's anybody here that that could say well you know i was there and brother branham discern the thoughts and intents of my heart and you have a a first-hand uh testimony in that regards of of of standing there uh face to face with the prophet you would think my uh why why didn't the culmination happen then but but god god has everything right in order everything is happening uh just on time i mean you think about when god decided to take the prophet home and the way he did it you imagine how people were walking around saying what happened i this doesn't make any sense to me i don't understand there you can imagine uh uh uh uh how great the weight and how how that great loss of o of the prophet who you know could uh that god would come and and take on that form and that flesh and he would speak thus saith the lord through those lips and and i i can't imagine what a comfort that would have been i mean look how many of you have a mom or a dad and and just and just having a mom or dad or brothers and sisters you just take comfort in that you know you might take it for granted you might not realize what you have until it's taken away from you you might have a family member or a loved one and and i tell you y'all hold them close to you love them cherish them because you don't know how long god will let them dwell with you on this side and and then when they're taken away from you all of a sudden there's there's an emptiness in your heart and you wonder what happened god why did that have to happen why did it have to go that way lord what does this all mean and you feel like you're left there to pick up the pieces oh i can't imagine you know many times i i think of people you know i don't mean to go this way but i just say it like i said a lot of people uh give brother joseph a hard time but you don't know what brother joseph had to go through a man a growing up who his dad was the prophet to the age and words were spoken over his life where it seemed such a great responsibility and him growing up all the time and all the testimonies oh me and your daddy me and your daddy me and your daddy your dad said this your dad said that and here this guy here poor joseph would sit there like you know i really never got to know my dad i never got to say and and to think he could stand there and make more my dad well i had the greatest dad that ever lived he would he would have that right to speak like that and to think of the pressure and and everything that had had worn on him and you can imagine what that man would go through with with everybody pulling on him and coming to him and him just wondering oh i just imagine there's been countless hours and countless days of of just trying and wondering lord why did you have to take my daddy see we don't put ourselves next to somebody like the prophet would he'd put his arms around somebody maybe line up his shoe there and and start to bear one another's burden but we just want to cast judgment on everybody who does he think he is you know he should be better than that and my we should really look up to him and if man if if that's what if that was his position i would never do that with shame on us i want to ask you what's happened to you in your life that would allow you to be in the seat of the scornful that would allow you to have so much pride and be so puffed up that you would be in a place where you could just cast judgment on everybody and think you got it all figured out but no we we we want to maybe narrow down our thought and start looking at what god has done in our life and maybe it looked impossible to sarah on how this word was going to be manifested so i'm bringing that right down home to you now oh we hear it over and over and the prophecies and the things that have been spoken we got a great responsibility church we've been called uh to the greatest responsibility that the age has ever known and that's to manifest the word the lord jesus christ and flesh to lay down the weight that so easily besets you to run this race with patience but we're doing it in an age that has such a demand and a pull on our flesh i wonder how we're doing with it and i could just think of sarah you know she could say you know i received a promise from melchizedek you know he appeared and he prophesied over my life and and he said according to the time of life that i i'm going to have a son well what's happened what what's happened sarah have you felt any change has there been anything that had happened but i could say that as sarah could you imagine after the promise has come to pass and now sarah has given birth to the promised son and then maybe those neighbors or some of the family are coming around and saying sarah what happened what happened to you i i i how can these things be and she could stand there and say well you know we were out there on the plains of memory there and i was standing i was actually inside the tent and here came melchizedek come walking by and he stood there and started talking to abraham and he said abraham where is your wife and he sat there and he prophesied over my life and he said according to the time of life sarah not another woman not another church but this bride the bride that's sitting here tonight this bride is going to bring forth the promised son oh she could stand there and say oh oh melchizedek came he spoke the word the saint of the lord and said i shall bring forth the promised son really sarah well that's that's wonderful what happened what happened then oh maybe she could say you know i asked the next day i woke up and nothing was any different you know i i kind of was wondering what happened and i started to think about how i was in there in a tent and when he had spoken and how i laughed it in my heart and and then even discern the thought and tits of my heart you know and and later i got to thinking about that and i really started asking myself who that really was because i really didn't know who that was at first but i realized that was god abraham called him lord that was melchizedek and as the story would go now i woke up the next day i didn't seem like there was any great change but you see sarah was living under a divine promise there had been a prophecy that had been spoken over sarah's life and regardless of how she was feeling regardless of how she looked that promise was going to come to pass and i i feel like sarah this evening where i can say oh i've received the promised word melchizedek has come in our generation and he has spoken a word he has given a thus saith the lord he has spoken a word over a bride that she will bring forth the promised son the lord jesus christ in flesh again and there is a people who are walking according to that promise and you're asking what happened oh what happened little by little day by day the scripture says and sarah receives strength to conceive that's what's happening to you as you meditate on the word day and night as you continue to pour yourself into the word as you continue to think about the words of the prophet you read your bible and you pray and you're looking towards this great promised word that you're wanting to be manifested in your life little by little like sarah you're being changed you're coming into that image and that perfection of the what the word calls you to be in this day you're living under promise you know verse 4 in the same chapter would say whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of divine nature escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust i know we're familiar with it we should be thankful for now we've been given great precious promises and it's by this promised word that we're partakers of divine nature and it's by this message that we escape the corruption that is in the world through lust because outside of this message you would be blind you wouldn't have the eye salve to see it's this message that the faith cometh by hearing the word not a word of 2000 years ago not a word from another age but the word for your age when it's revealed to you it brings i save that you might see in the wicked day that you're living in that you might know that there's more with us than there are against us and i just want to bring your attention back here to verse 10 it says make your calling an election sure you know you might ask yourself what does that really mean brother matthew i've heard that so many times what does make your calling election sure really mean you know the prophet of god said we don't want to be just wondering if we're called he said you must be called or you'll be defeated you must be called or you will be defeated now that comes out of questions and answers where the prophet is dealing with a man who's uh wrestling with the call of god in his life to be a preacher but i feel it's it's very applicable because he would go on to say that that's what the trick of the enemy will do is he'll try to make you think you're not called when you're called has he tried that trick on you i mean that that dumb devil he still tries that trick on me just thinking maybe one day you'll buy it look you never accept from that because we go through life we go through trials we go through tribulations and he starts to make you question the call of god in your life and you know maybe just in reference in this scripture you know and there's certainly um there could be the broad call to christianity and then you know for those maybe if you're being called into the ministry or something like that then that's a specific call and and and truly we we we don't want to just be wondering if we're called because if we don't know we're called like the prophet said you'll be defeated and there's been a many a man who have started out been a little many of men who have thought they were called and they went out there into the battlefield and they fell out they were defeated but i want to deal more with this sense as as paul when he'd be writing to the romans he would say you know i paul i called an apostle of god and he said i'm writing to you romans who who are called the saints of god and that's what we're dealing with here because you you have been called to be the children of god you've been called to be the bride of christ and and we know these things we're familiar with them of how uh uh paul would speak there in ephesians and say you know you you're you're chosen you're predestinated uh you're elected we know that you're with him and you were in his thinking before the foundation of the world but you you might know those things but that that call and that election we got to make sure of that and if i could say it like this we want to be able to come to a place where all the doubts removed to remove the doubt there's no more question because if you keep wandering over that and you don't drive a stake down you're going to be defeated you'll come right back to that same place again in your life and you'll wonder why am i battling this again because you're going to keep wondering and questioning am i even called to be the bride of jesus christ have i even worked out my salvation with fear and trembling i want to tell you there's a place that you can come to tonight there's a place that you can come to where you can drive that anchor down where you're no more guessing you're no more wondering but god comes to you personally and reveals himself to you and takes away all the doubt that you know that you know that you know that you are called that you are elected of god oh when it's a revelation i just want to say that something changes something happens you know it it's not just a way of thinking you know as we we approach the new year and and people turn over turn a leaf or they turn the calendar and they they they they're gonna make their their their lives better they're they're gonna go on some type of of diet and drink crazy amounts of water all day long to flush out their system you know all these things they might do but when it's a revelation something changes it can't be questioned anymore and you know brother branham would uh speak about how he went into the emergency room one time and and i it seemed to be a one that would be for those who would have been insane and he he starts to tell the story of how he came there to i believe he speaks this and from that time and he he comes into the emergency room and he starts to describe uh the condition of the people as he looks around and there's people in straight jackets and and just big full beards and spittle hanging in their beards and and all he said these people just possessed with great demon powers and he said he looked there and he saw a young woman about 25 years old and she was a beautiful young woman and he looked at her and he said well i i just uh i don't even now i just wonder where i should start to start praying for these people and she looked at him and said well why don't you start with me and brother branham looked at her to you you're not a patient are you and she said yes yes i'm a patient he goes oh okay well you're not well what happened what's the problem says well they say i'm insane well you're insane what happened and she starts to tell the story you know i was i was a good good girl i was i was raised in a christian home and but you know i started to go with this boy and i started to go with this boy we started to smoke cigarettes and and one night he spiked my coke and he put alcohol in my soda and from that time all of a sudden i found myself i was chasing after the things of the world and i ended up uh being a prostitute and all of a sudden i found myself in a place i never thought i could be said oh i tried to clean up my life i tried to turn a page you know i'd do better i i would do better and i went to the good shepherd's home a catholic organization and i went there for three years and i i i you know i was doing better you know i felt good about myself i i was putting the right steps in front of the other and i was ready to go back out there in the world because i had turned a page i had a new chapter in my life and i was ready to go out there and face the world but she said you know i went back out there and as soon as i got right back out there with a crowd i was right back out there doing the same thing again she said i i tried another few years and i went back to doing the same things and then i ended up in the in the being incarcerated for two years and she was like i was sure then when i was incarcerated that i i had found the things that i needed to change my life i had gotten the right approach and the right thinking you know and i i really turned the page now i was ready to go back out there into the world and i i i was ready to live a life for jesus i so i got out of being incarcerated i went and became a part of the church and and i became a partner and had uh talks with a chaplain but she said you know there's just something it got a hold of me and it took me right back to that place again now you might not be able to identify to it on that scale but you know the devil has demon powers that will hold you in a condition that'll keep you from going on with god and he'll hold you right there until you come to a place of deliverance and the prophet of god would look at her and he'd say you know sister i believe that's a demon power that's having that effect on you and your life and she would say oh i know it is and he would ask her do you want to be delivered from that she's more than anything do you want to do you want to be a good wife and have a good family and live a christian life more than anything i want that he said well then why don't i pray with you and they got down and they started to pray there and they got on their knees and it was just after a little while she got up and she was crying she had tears coming down her face and said brother random i'm gonna go start a new life i'm gonna go live for god the prophet looked at her and said you've done that already that's the problem you've done that over and over and over you've gotten up and you've turned a page and you've tried to go on and live a christian life he said that's not going to do you any good the prophet would say this he'd say sister dear you're just simply turning a page it won't do you any good i said you've done that so many times just stay here until god speaks back to you we've got we got down there together and prayed and i left praying and went on pray with the other people and after a while she rose up from there and looked around in the room those big eyes looking at me and she said something happened to me i said now you've got it now you've got it you don't have to turn new pages now it's happened you've got it and from that time she was a changed person she's married got a lovely home and and two children now she can point her fingers to a time that something happened to her that was immortal things happen and life changed but there is something hallelujah that can happen to a person that won't change you cannot be the same after this happens that's when a man meets god he's changed something happens to him oh hallelujah hallelujah oh that's that's where i want to preach from a little tonight yay i think it meat as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you into remembrance i want to remind you tonight that something happened something has happened in your life that almighty god has come to you and he has chased you something that's taken place and paul said i want to stir you oh that means i want to wake you up i want to make you arise from your sleep i want to put you in remembrance maybe some spiritual amnesia has been trying to creep into your life maybe it's not as fresh what god has done for you but i will not be negligent as long as i'm in this tabernacle i want to remind you of what's happened to you i want to remind you of what god said to you i want to remind you of how god met you in your time of despair i want to remind you how god healed you i want to remind you how god called you i want to remind you that when you're out there in sin and you were lost and you had no hope something happened something happened to you and you were changed and you'll never be the same anymore i want to remind you tonight that something has happened oh but as long as i am in this body i want to remind you of what he said i want to remind you of his promises i want to remind you of what god has done oh it wasn't just too long ago that you were flipped upside down in a car drunk and on a dead-end street to hell but what happened it wasn't too long ago you were just bar hopping barsing the bar scene but something happened it wasn't too long ago that you were bound by denominational way of thinking but something happened it wasn't too long ago that you were writing a message church pew and you thought you all right but something happened oh glory to god i want to stir you up tonight i want to get you so stirred up that all those things that god has done and the things that god has said to you will be solely caught up into your remembrance that something will start to rise up within you that you'll be stirred that'll become fresh again look let's not be like the first church i have somewhat with you i know i know your trial i know your your persecutions i know what you've gone through but i have somewhat against you what what do we do you lost your first love something something that's taken place where all of a sudden that same love that you have it's now it's now waning and the candle is going out something that happened prophet would say what happens is the world starts to creep in formalism starts to creep in he would say that you left that love that you once had for them good old-fashioned holy ghost meetings and begin to backslide you know why people don't like good old-fashioned holy ghost meetings it calls you out it exposes you i ain't trying to say we gotta have a big hoop law but if we we can have a holy ghost field meeting right now that's what should be taking place but what's your expectation what did you come for did you come forward to be pepped up and propped up and petted and and sent back out to the workforce and say you're doing a good job just hang on till you die you're coming to be a part of something you're coming to worship your lord jesus christ who saved you who redeemed you who calls you look i'm trying to remind you something's happened there's not a church here in bedford texas for no reason but something's happened god has come he's made himself unknown to a people a people that wants to love him a people that wants to serve him a people that wants to rejoice in what he's done and a people that want to hear from god maybe something has happened and caused you to question the message it's possible maybe something's happened it's caused you to question the ministry and you're sitting right now in this pew and you're wondering how much longer you'll be able to go because things really haven't happened the way you might have thought they would have unfolded and you're a little discouraged and you're wondering what happened why are we in this place where we're at maybe something has happened that's caused trust issues in your life and you just find out there's something in you that when it comes to taking god at his word or or or recognizing the leadership in the church there's just there's there's just something there that's causing you to to draw back and you're finding that the leadership of god seems far away from you and you're kind of confused and you're wondering how did i ever get here because the devil's been able to take away you having trust in the leadership of the lord trust in the body trust in his word maybe something's happened you know this is a cruel world we live in and hard things happen to us our family situations and things we go through can be very traumatizing and have psychological effects on you and it can cause you not to trust people and it can cause you to to have a certain a response or reaction or or maybe you're just one of those where you just you don't you know you're never going to open up your heart again because you don't ever want to be hurt again don't cut don't come don't come knocking on that door lord i'm not ready to open that up no one's allowed in there lord i don't want to open up every room of my heart ah you can come only so far but your lord is wanting to come and come into that room of hurt and put his arms around you let you know that it's okay and that he loves you and it's not your fault and he forgives you and it's okay and you'll be all right if you'll just trust me you'll just follow this message with all of your heart and don't worry about what the world says or what your family says but if you'll just give your whole heart to me just trust me you can just die out to all that hurt those things that have happened in the past maybe you're wondering what happened to me why am i in this condition you know the devil will make you feel condemned it'll make you feel unworthy make you feel incapable and unable and it's not for you and you're never going to be doing any different and why try why why even try to overcome anymore every time you try every time you try to make a change you just end up falling right back on your face why even get back up again why don't you just stay down there because every time you've gotten back up it's not you that's getting up there's something inside of you that will not quit you can try to quit you can try to throw in the towel you can try to give up but there is something inside of the believer that no matter what you think you want to do there is an anchor that is holding you and as far as you run out there into sin and as far as you run out there into the world there's an anchor that is attached to your heart and he's going to keep pulling and he's going to keep pulling and it's going to keep pulling oh has anybody ever been out there on a big fish and you start to reel it in and it's getting closer to the boat and there it goes running again and it runs a little bit and it gets tired and then it keeps reeling it back in it gets close to the boat and then it runs all i want to tell you the lord jesus god has set a hook in you that hook could never come out he was set there before the world was ever formed he had thoughts of joy thoughts of peace thoughts of love about you and when you came into manifestation in this age there was a predestinated hook in your heart that the world would never satisfy you you can keep running you can run this way and you can run that way but he's going to keep reeling you in he's going to keep bringing you in oh church i say you're right at the boat now why don't you just let the arms of his love and that gospel net just pull you on board with him you'll find it it's hard to run it gets worrisome it gets tired but the devil will try to make you feel so unworthy and condemned get you thinking in such a way that he doesn't love me this message isn't for me you know i want to just reference this story the prophet tells he was preaching some meetings in ohio and he starts to tell the story he says you know i i was there at a dunkard restaurant does anybody know what a dunkard restaurant is praise the lord a dunkard restaurant you know just to get your minds thinking in the right way because i was wondering you know i look i i looked it up i'm inquisitive you know dunkard restaurant ohio no dunkard restaurant but you know dunkers are like the amish it's it's a it's a it's a certain uh religious system you know and they they have a holiness dress and things and brother brandon was saying i was up there in ohio and and i was preaching these meetings and i would go to the dunkard restaurant and he said oh i go in there and and my he just said man it was like a piece of heaven there so i would go in there you know and the the ladies were dressed right and the food was good and it was a good atmosphere he said but you know on sunday they close up and they go to church so i found myself i had to go down to just like any any old american cafe and he said i i came to that cafe and i stepped into there he says as i stepped in there i oh what a contrast he sees this man with his arm around another woman probably not his wife and they're playing the slot machine and here's a police officer uh standing there and and he starts to survey the scene and think my you know gambling's not even legal in ohio and and here here this man is is playing the slot machine and this officer here is and they're breaking the law and he started to look around and there in the back corner there was there was if i can get a little more sound on this y'all said y'all would blow me out but i feel like i've been working up here he said you know i look back there in in the corner and there's these teenage boys who uh were on the jukebox and and they were playing their music and you know i i i looked over there and here here was this this waiter standing there and oh she was an older lady and she was wearing those vulgar clothes and and her and she was her flabbler was hanging out and she was standing there with with purple toenails and and purple fingernails and her and her hair was cut real short and it was dyed blue he says and i looked over there at the table and and there was these two men that were were sitting there and he had like an army overcoat and a scarf on and a big old beard and it was the middle of the summer and they were drunk and and carrying on he's oh just what a new place it was and those two men got up and they started to go to the restroom and the prophet stood and looked around there and he said oh god why don't you just burn the whole place why don't you just sink the whole thing and he kind of just stepped off to the side there and he said he felt the presence of the lord come and of all of a sudden he felt the presence of the lord he saw something to come start whirling there and all of a sudden he was caught there in a vision and he saw the world there was just turning around and there was this scarlet streak that was going around the world and as he he saw that the world spinning this this scarlet streak like blood going around the world he said all of a sudden i saw myself there as a little boy there playing and i saw myself as a boy growing up there and every time i would sin my sins would start to go up towards heaven and oh if my sins ever meet that every sinner oh he's a righteous god if your sins ever make it there you're doomed for judgment you've got to die if your sin ever hits there but he said as my sin started to go up there there was this bumper there and all of a sudden i noticed there was jesus standing there ah there was spit in his beard and he had a crown of thorns on and he was bleeding he was standing there and every time my sin would go out there he would reach out and you'd grab it i got a little bit closer to here because i could tell he was saying something and he would say father forgive him for he knows not what he does and there was a recording angel there off to his side he was writing a book and every sin and everything that you've ever done was being recorded in that book every thought every bad deed everything was being written in there and it was at that moment that prophet he looked there and he started to cry out to god and so god forgive me forgive me for my sins lord forgive me for what i've done lord i i'm unworthy to be your servant lord oh please forgive me forgive me for what i've done all my sins lord and then all of a sudden he said he saw him reaching to his side there and he got blood and he took that book and he wrote pardon on it and he threw it into the sea of god's forgetfulness and said you're forgiven and he looked at him and this vision would unfold god would speak to him and say i've forgiven you but you want to condemn that woman that's sitting there the prophet said he learned a hard lesson that way he learned a hard lesson that i've forgiven you but you want to condemn that woman i started to put myself there i started to think about that all of our sins every one of them going but there's a bumper of blood i want to maybe remind you a little bit and stir you up look you know where you've come from you know what god's done for you you know what he's done in your life you know how he's forgiven you you know he's said pardoned he's took that whole book of remembrance of all your sins and all your failures and with his own blood he's written pardon on and he's through it in a god's sea of forgetfulness and how easily we forget how easily we become judgmental how easily we find ourselves losing our first love allowing the things of the world to creep in allowing us to become formal i just want to say god help me god help me to love you more lord create in me a clean heart renew a right spirit within me o god cast me not away from my presence lord maybe that's what's on my heart i want to stir you up a little bit and you could you could start to remember your first love and what it was like to be set free what it was like to be delivered what it was like to have that burden of sin lifted oh my does anybody know what it's like did anybody think back to that time where there was a mountain of sin on your shoulders you didn't even realize the weight you didn't even realize how hopeless you were because you'd never experienced anything different you just knew something wasn't right but then something happened something changed and you became different you come to know the lord and the power of his resurrection and he forgave you all all of your sins does anybody know what i'm talking about i just want you to meditate on that for a little bit maybe a little simple sermon but as we're bringing in the new year i want to put you in a remembrance i want you to start thinking about what god has done for you we don't even know what all he's done for us just those things he's revealed to us maybe there's somebody here that needs something to happen maybe in your heart you're sitting here and you're saying brother matthew i hear what you're saying but i need something to happen in my life there's somebody here that says you know what i need something to happen in my life i need a change i need a difference i need a difference maker i need something to happen to me maybe you need deliverance i want to ask you where's that joy you used to have where's that fire for god where's that love that zealousness to serve him we go through life and we have great challenges and responsibilities come you know when we we kind of become we start to tolerate things you know your worst enemy is yourself right your worst enemy is yourself and i kind of was uh thinking maybe along those lines on a thought that god might have in my heart for the young people this weekend but you know you're your own worst enemy and i find that what the deception is is we start to not discern who the enemy is anymore and we start to tolerate habits and actions in our own life because it's just kind of you but then you have the other you who's predestinated ordained who can't miss it and and if you're not careful you just allow these two separate beings if you will look you know this is a pest house look in the mirror and say you are my worst enemy maybe that'll help you out every morning maybe you ought to just walk into the bathroom with a big ol smile and go you know what guy you are my worst enemy and i hate you well would that be all right because if we're not careful what happens i was thinking about this you know this is a it's a home right it's a home and maybe you live in a house and and maybe there there's something in your house that needs to be fixed and you know you need to fix it maybe something in your car you need to fix or something that you needed to change and you needed to change it have you ever put a reminder up and you leave the reminder there so long it's not a reminder anymore because it becomes common you know you're living in a house and you know the ac needs to be fixed or you need to change the filters or something but what you do is you you start to tolerate the condition and many times you'll find people living in a condition they'll become oblivious to it until somebody comes over that's not living in that condition and they come over there be like hey dude do you not realize the smell's in here yeah right yeah there's there's there must be something dead in here come to find out your plumbing's leaking or something and there's something you you maybe have noticed at first but you start to tolerate it i wonder church if you eat that oh my god set you free he set you soaring and you're sworn in the heavenlies and you're so free and so delivered but but but as life continued to happen and satan's eden keeps pressing upon you and the kids start coming and oh you make exceptions for this and you make exceptions for that and before you know it your prayer life's gone reading the bible's gone and you're tolerating this music and that movies and this and that and before you know it you know how i i i i give myself advice a lot i ask myself well what happens if that was another young brother that came and asked you that oh i know the answer but we don't have the answer for ourself come on think of in your own life the things that you tolerate and ask yourself if another young brother or young sister came to you and said brother so and so i'm doing these things and those things what do you think about it what advice would you would you give them maybe we've become some hypocrites let me preach at myself a little bit because we think we can handle it but but i'm not even trying to go that direction i'm not trying to to to make this a rules and regulations because what i'm what i'm wanting to do i want to stir your heart up that you'll be in love with him but you'll just go back to that place where he set you free and think about how hopeless you were and how lost you were and i was thinking as they were we were bringing in the new year and we were hearing testimonies of what god's done i thought that's right that's good i think each one of us need to give our testimony i think we need to get out there in the highways and byways and start telling somebody what god done for us if you need a scripture to give the same testimony over again to your family i got one for you just say i know i know you've heard it before but paul said as long as i'm in this tabernacle i find it needful to put you in remembrance of these things i just want to tell you again you remember that time when i was 21 years old and i got in that big old mess and i didn't know what to do and i cried out to god i said god whatever this is it's bigger than me and i need your help and jesus christ came on the scene and something happened i was changed and i've never been the same since oh we start to re revisit that we start to put ourselves in remembrance of that and if you start staying true to that you'll find all these things that you started to tolerate why don't we just get back in love with him again why don't we purpose in our heart for 2022 that we'll fall in love with him again oh there's a song that says i keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again there's nothing wrong with that for those of you that are married well no doubt we love one another but you know we don't say the same same things like we used to we don't spend the same time like we used to i think it would be good to do that we need to take time with our spouses and tell them how much we love them and take time with them because there was a time in the world where you would move mountains just to spend the day with them and now you move mountains just to go play golf you move mountains just to go hunting you move mountains just so brother matthew you're about to get some people in trouble you know something that i always try to do is if i see something in my natural life i look into my spiritual this might sound really silly but if your room's a mess you might want to start looking at your spiritual life if you find out there's things in the natural that aren't just don't look right you you might realize that you're not in tune with the holy spirit that might sound super simple i tell you give it a try it's little foxes that spoil the vine and things we start to tolerate and here the still small voice of the lord is is is speaking to you wanting to to reel you in and pull you closer to his bosom but we just start to tolerate the things of the world but you know when the children of israel came into the promised land it was time for a house cleaning i say in 2022 let's let's clean the house and fall in love again could all of y'all agree with me with me in 2022 let's just stand to our feet can everybody agree with your heart so you know what 20 22 i want a clean house and fall in love with god because i know if i can just start to to fall in love with him again if i can just be stirred up into remembrance of what god has done for me i know all these little things that i've started to tolerate will start to fall away and you'll find yourself finding time to read your bible you'll find your time starting to pray you'll find time for your family you'll find time for your wife why because it's god in you that's willing to do it because that's the spirit of christ the spirit of christ isn't selfish it's a spirit of love maybe they just start playing something i want to read this quote [Music] i like how paul said we are eyewitnesses of his majesty you know this this isn't a story this isn't a fable this isn't something fake but but something has happened something is you you want to have that type of experience where you're changed and you say brother matthew how will i know well i can only say it's like this like faith is the sixth sense i don't have to see the piano to know it's there i can hear it i don't have to see the pulpit to know it's there i can feel it and when faith anchors in the word of god and it's revealed to you you don't have to see it you don't have to touch it you don't have to feel it but it's a revelation something's changed something's become a part of you something has happened that you can get up like that poor 25 year old girl that was in an insane institution who had tried over and over again and she had gone on her knees and and prayed she even got on her knees there with the prophet and with good intentions she stood back up said okay brother random i'm gonna go now so that's not it get on your knees until he speaks back until something happens until you're changed the prophet would say this you can accept it by faith you have to accept christ by faith that's exactly right and you have and you accept the holy spirit by faith but then let the holy spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he's accepted your faith you see then see abraham believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousness but god give him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation he had accepted his faith so that's the same thing we must do we must wait on the holy spirit till it's done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongues not because we've danced or we got emotional or we shouted until we're changed until something actually happened i don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing see i want to remind you something has actually happened it's my words that's what i want to do i want to remind you that something has actually happened just think about what he's done for you a little bit it's the close of the service just take a moment to worship the lord they would take this time to really meditate maybe you just think back you remember the bondage you were in you remember how hopeless it seemed maybe your family situation maybe god had called you to the message and you didn't know how in the world your family could ever see it and you he didn't know what was going to happen oh but something happened as i was thinking on this thought i started to think about john there in revelations chapter 5 and there he is weeping he's crying and somebody maybe would have said to john john what happened what's wrong he said no one's worthy no one's worthy to take the book there's the book of redemption sitting in his hands on the throne and and the angels called forth who is worthy come take the book and we've looked into heaven we've looked under the earth we looked all over and there's been no one worthy found to take the book but all of a sudden there in verse 13 god is praising god he's saying blessing and honor to him that liveth forever and then what happened john what changed what happened oh the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book and loose the seven seals thereof you want to ask why we're gathered together tonight that's why we ain't a religion we ain't a denomination we've heard the shout we've heard the trump the bread of life coming that's what's changing you so now that we can believe this message like sarah know hey i know that i'm gonna be changed i know that i'm being raptured right now i'm caught in the rapture cycle because the lord has descended with a shout well how do you know something's happened i've been changed and soon and very soon we'll step into eternity let's just sing this song oh concert me lord [Music] embraced [Music] oh [Music] why don't you just let your heart be stirred [Music] why don't you as you sing this just allow your heart to be stirred [Music] pieces [Music] we sing that song all of my ambitions hopes and dreams same key will be fine [Music] all of my [Music] ambitions hopes i surrender oh [Music] is [Music] me [Music] foreign [Music] let's just try to fear [Music] i am [Music] oh why don't you just surrender him all right oh for the coming year why don't you surrender all your hopes and plans into his hands [Music] [Music] [Music] oh jesus [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh jesus [Music] oh let's just sing this one more time oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] jackson could just come closer today i had a laura in the family come visit me at work and i always like to show that side show my family kind of lets the guy see another side and you know then the questions come when they left me and a young man standing there and everybody had gone home and he says i i kind of noticed your wife and your daughter they had a skirt on is that for religious purposes so it always opens a door for a testimony even as matthew sharon it kind of led into the testimony and then you start to reflect back some of the things and a lot of times the testimony will start with you know at one point i had three dwis you know and you start to look back and share and what god's done for you you know every time i say that it comes out and i'm thinking man lord you've really done a lot you've really delivered me from a lot that's a that's just the start of it and then it goes more into it and um you know it's always a time for me to reflect back and it was it was right around this week that i gave my heart to the lord many years ago so every time someone preaches on a testimony you start to see what god's done and you know a lot of times we don't fully know all of our testimonies and it's nice to share and let people know where you come from and those around you so i love how you said bring to remembrance because it never gets old sharing your testimony appreciate that matthew let's pray heavenly father lord we come to you tonight [Music] lord and even as brother matthew preached on lord there's always a remembrance lord we can look back in our own lives and we can see those around us lord but we also want to remember the cross lord and it was spoken tonight as your blood was shared lord there's a bumper there for us lord we never want to take that for granted lord as we fall more in love with you and we have a deeper revelation of your love for us lord that's when it becomes that we don't want to hurt you that's when it becomes though we don't want to let things of the past or small sins or different thoughts lord raise up within us lord we know that you've done something special lord and it wasn't just by accident lord you allowed this whole thing to play out you had these thoughts before the foundation of the world you wanted fellowship lord you wanted someone that you could love and that would love you back lord and you set a time and even allowed ages to unfold lord that we could get to the end and you could say this is what the this is the special price that i pray paid for people lord and we're manifesting that lord and we ask that you would just forgive us where we're short forgive us order when we stumble in front of one another though we don't we just want to make this a routine or a lifestyle lord but we want it to be something that's real something that can speak out lord and we want to use these opportunities at work in school and at the store that when the opportunity does come up we're able to present our testimony and what you've done lord and we may we may be even in a spot that we're not able to share much scripture but we can tell lord what you've done for us and that allows it to unfold and when somebody sees something genuine that means more to them than head knowledge lord and we thank you for the things that we heard tonight lord we always want to be in remembrance of what you've done for us lord and where we're going may we never forget that we thank you for the words that are spoken but i pray you'd be with brother matthew lord restore strength be with him as he travels this weekend lord and to the young people that are there lord so many of us have been affected by a camp or a special service or time that was set aside pray lord you do something special or there's teenagers lord that need to know you better and and maybe have set on a pew lord and there's an opportunity that when that when that seed is struck lord that life comes forth well we just commit all things into your hands we ask these things in jesus name amen amen let's just sing this song as our dismissal well lord lord lord you've surely been good to me [Music] surely been good to me [Music] [Music] me [Music] me [Music] to me [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] wow [Music] [Music] hallelujah oh [Music] sing it again [Music] oh [Music] when you're walking through the valley and the shadows oh [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] you
