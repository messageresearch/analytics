[30:56] sing songs to you Lord to tell you that
[30:59] we thank you for your grace your mercy
[31:01] and how great you
[31:03] are Lord we know that we are incapable
[31:05] of giving you the words that are due
[31:08] unto
[31:10] you and we pray God that we could at
[31:13] least surrender our lives and our hearts
[31:15] to you
[31:17] tonight Lord that we can just lay
[31:19] everything down at your feet right now
[31:21] and say Lord you're worthy of it
[31:23] all you're worthy of every word that we
[31:26] could give you you're worthy of every
[31:28] minute that we can give
[31:31] you it's because you loved us Lord and
[31:35] you gave your life for us that we could
[31:37] be free from sin and death and forgiven
[31:40] and we could experience what it means to
[31:43] no longer have any condemnation and to
[31:46] be set free to soar in Heavenly places
[31:49] in Christ Jesus in our position Lord
[31:51] that's what you purchased for us at
[31:53] Calvary and Lord forgive us so many
[31:56] times we live below our privileges we
[31:59] live below the very things that you've
[32:02] given to us and we turn from them Lord
[32:04] but we just ask that you forgive us now
[32:06] for that as we turn and look to you just
[32:10] to come and speak to us tonight Lord
[32:12] that we could receive what you have for
[32:14] us Lord we know that correction starts
[32:16] at the house of God lord where we need
[32:18] correction correct us Lord those that
[32:21] are brokenhearted bind them up those
[32:23] that need Deliverance may they be
[32:24] delivered those that need the filling of
[32:26] the Holy Ghost may they be filled those
[32:29] that need a refilling Lord we pray that
[32:30] you refill us oh God lord may you renew
[32:33] our minds Lord give us Revelation Lord
[32:36] we believe that you've ordained moments
[32:38] like this that we would take one step
[32:40] closer to that great change and the
[32:42] catching away of your bride Lord we know
[32:44] we're on the cusp of the translation
[32:47] Lord it can be any minute it can be any
[32:49] moment Lord and we want to be found
[32:51] faithful your word says will I find
[32:53] faith when I come Lord here we are in
[32:55] the faith that we have as a gift that
[32:57] you have given to us and you sent your
[32:58] word Lord to produce a faith that can
[33:01] believe all things Lord so now here we
[33:03] are we're looking to you you are the
[33:05] author you are the finisher of our faith
[33:08] and we just pray that you'd come and
[33:09] break the bread of
[33:11] Life feed your people I pray in Jesus
[33:14] Christ's
[33:15] name amen praise the Lord if you have
[33:18] your bibles if you can turn in 2
[33:19] Corinthians chapter
[33:21] 3 amen it's good to be back in the house
[33:24] of
[33:24] God I really enjoyed the meetings we
[33:28] had um my it's good to be able to follow
[33:33] up services like that uh I think that
[33:36] the church house should be full and
[33:38] people should be on fire for God and
[33:40] wanting to testify and just uh uh be so
[33:44] overwhelmed by God's love and his grace
[33:47] and um of course when we go back through
[33:49] the week the devil's always right there
[33:51] to try to beat you down and try to get
[33:53] you distracted and uh that's just the
[33:55] way the devil does things
[33:57] but praise God the devil will do what he
[33:59] does but God will do what he does Amen
[34:01] he'll bind you up he'll speak to your
[34:03] heart he'll get you back on track he'll
[34:05] encourage you we just pray that we can
[34:07] find something in the word of God as a
[34:08] little something on our heart that might
[34:10] be a blessing to you reading out of 2
[34:11] Corinthians uh chapter 3 we have a
[34:15] little thought we'll just try to work
[34:16] towards uh just how God would bring this
[34:19] out so 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse
[34:22] one it says Do We Begin Again to commend
[34:26] our elves or need we as some other
[34:28] Epistle of commendation to you or
[34:31] letters of condemnation from you you are
[34:34] our Epistles written in our hearts known
[34:36] and read of all men for as much as ye
[34:38] are manifestly declared to be the
[34:40] Epistles of Christ ministered by US
[34:42] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[34:45] of the Living God not on tables of stone
[34:48] but in fleshly tables of the heart and
[34:52] such trust have we through Christ to God
[34:54] word not that we are sufficient of
[34:57] ourselves to think anything of ourselves
[34:58] but our sufficiency is of God who hath
[35:02] made us able Ministers of the New
[35:04] Testament not of the letter but of the
[35:06] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[35:10] giveth life amen we just ask you to be
[35:12] seated as we'll just continue uh uh
[35:14] moving towards our text but the prophet
[35:16] of God would say many people just take
[35:18] the letter the letter kth the spirit
[35:21] giveth life see and they take these
[35:23] Creeds and so forth still kth but when
[35:26] you take the spirit that's God himself
[35:30] so when you take the spirit that's God
[35:32] himself so you can even take the message
[35:34] which if you just take the letter form
[35:36] of it it's going to be death if you try
[35:38] to live the message by your efforts or
[35:41] your abilities uh you're going to come
[35:43] up short but he's saying if you take the
[35:45] spirit the letter kth but you take the
[35:48] spirit of God that's God himself how do
[35:50] you know it's God because he is taking
[35:53] the word and manifesting it oh my that's
[35:56] what I want tonight I want God by his
[35:58] Spirit to take the word and manifest it
[36:01] in my life see that's what I want I just
[36:04] don't want to be a so-called good
[36:05] message believer and be able to say Amen
[36:07] to everything the prophet of God said
[36:09] but I want to say Amen to the word but
[36:11] then I want the spirit of the word right
[36:14] because the word is a spirit and the
[36:15] spirit of the word to come upon the word
[36:17] that I've received into the B ground of
[36:19] my heart and that I want that Spirit to
[36:21] make this word a reality see there's a
[36:23] lot of things that are laying within the
[36:25] Bible or laying with in the message and
[36:27] that we believe but I want to say there
[36:29] ought to come a hunger and a cry in the
[36:32] heart of the believer to actually see
[36:33] the manifestation of the things that
[36:36] have been spoken but unfortunately a lot
[36:38] of times we get a little complacent uh
[36:40] we get a little comfortable with our
[36:42] circles and our friends and and saying
[36:44] that we're message Believers and and and
[36:46] you know because we got message
[36:47] Believers on Snapchat and Facebook and
[36:50] Instagram and all of these things and we
[36:52] go to the same churches and the same
[36:54] camps and things you know it's real easy
[36:56] to come and into a Social Circle you
[36:58] know the message has really become a
[36:59] social gospel amongst the youth and
[37:01] amongst many people because we can
[37:03] travel here and we can travel there and
[37:05] and we can listen to the same kind of
[37:07] music and have the same kind of friends
[37:09] and we can be void of the spirit of God
[37:12] taking the message of the hour and
[37:14] actually producing the life of the
[37:16] message my I would say this that even
[37:18] brother Brandon when he preached the
[37:20] message over and over he hammered that
[37:22] these signs shall follow them that
[37:23] believe in my name they shall do these
[37:26] wonderful things but I wonder if there's
[37:27] even a hunger in the heart of the
[37:29] believer to see the supernatural flowing
[37:32] in your life in and around you that you
[37:34] would be God's hand extended that you
[37:36] would actually be the solution to the
[37:37] problems and the chaos that's out there
[37:39] in the world that when you go into the
[37:41] marketplace or you go into your school
[37:43] that you could real understand that
[37:46] Christ is wanting to in Tabernacle
[37:47] himself in your body that you could be
[37:50] the very one to look on the need of
[37:52] somebody else and say you know I know a
[37:54] God that can heal you I have a word that
[37:56] can deliver you I've actually come in
[37:58] contact with a resource that can meet
[38:01] every need that you have and I want to
[38:03] testify to you a little bit about the
[38:05] goodness of God I want to testify to you
[38:07] about the grace of God because God's
[38:09] done something Supernatural for me but a
[38:11] lot of times we're lacking those very
[38:13] abilities to testify because we've never
[38:15] come into a true uh contact with the
[38:18] power of God where we've been on the
[38:19] sacred sands on the back side of the
[38:21] desert and we've come to that burning
[38:23] bush where we're
[38:25] changed
[38:27] well come on help me out a little
[38:29] bit if you haven't been there get there
[38:32] it's going home
[38:33] time it's the same gospel it's the same
[38:36] way every single one of us have to come
[38:38] uh Jesus Christ's first Doctrine was you
[38:40] must be born again and when you're born
[38:43] again it's now the life of God coming
[38:45] into the individual to make the word a
[38:48] reality if you're seeing things laying
[38:50] in the word that is not a reality in
[38:52] your life then I say we want to come
[38:54] into a place of desperation and prayer
[38:56] that we would call out to God and say
[38:58] I'm hearing the word preach I'm reading
[39:00] in the Bible I'm listening to on the
[39:02] tapes I hear what the prophet said but
[39:04] Lord I'm seeing that there's a lacking
[39:06] of those things in our life and I want
[39:08] to say it's more than just having power
[39:10] it's more than just having the signs and
[39:12] wonders following us but we want to have
[39:14] the fruits of the spirit we we and we
[39:16] want to have the humility we want to
[39:18] have the life because I want to tell you
[39:20] when you live in his present it produces
[39:22] a
[39:24] humility and the reason why we indulge
[39:27] in so many carnal things that we indulge
[39:29] in and we talk about certain things and
[39:31] the musics we listen to and the people
[39:34] and things that we entertain is because
[39:35] we're not living in his present you
[39:36] wonder why the prophet of God was so
[39:38] sensitive and so reverent and so fearful
[39:41] and had such hum humility because he was
[39:44] Walking In The Presence of
[39:47] Jehovah but many times we entertain so
[39:50] many things because we're far from his
[39:52] presence it's far from our thinking but
[39:54] what we want to do is we want to take
[39:55] the life
[39:57] look the letter
[39:58] kth it's not enough to just say you
[40:00] believe it but we want the life of the
[40:02] word to come and and and then when you
[40:04] are taking the spirit that's God himself
[40:07] how do you know it's God because he's
[40:09] taking the word and he's manifesting see
[40:11] then it's God himself oh my spoken word
[40:14] so Jesus would say in John 663 he say it
[40:17] is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[40:20] profiteth
[40:21] nothing the words that I speak unto you
[40:24] they are spirit and they are life if you
[40:27] haven't found out yet you're going to
[40:28] find out that the flesh can profit you
[40:31] nothing there's not enough good works
[40:33] there's not enough good things you can
[40:35] say there's not enough good things you
[40:37] can do to save you because if there was
[40:39] anything uh that you could do to save
[40:41] you then Christ died in vain so we
[40:43] understand it's not by works and it's
[40:45] not by the flesh there is nothing that
[40:47] you can do that would warn that but it's
[40:49] the word of God that he has spoken and
[40:51] the words that he speaks unto they are
[40:53] spirit and they are life it's more than
[40:55] letter that's right that's right the
[40:58] message is more than
[41:00] letter right it's more than a good
[41:03] sermon it's more than just a wow factor
[41:05] I've never heard that before but there's
[41:07] a life behind the
[41:10] word there's a life behind the word the
[41:12] the words that I speak unto you the very
[41:15] thing that you are hearing there's a
[41:17] life behind it there's a life that is
[41:20] attached to the word if I can say
[41:21] there's a spirit that's attached to the
[41:23] word and Lord if you're speaking to me
[41:26] if you're speaking your word that I want
[41:28] the life of the word to take the seed
[41:30] word and produce the manifestation of it
[41:33] in my life true humility true love true
[41:39] reverence and
[41:40] fear as Paul would say in Romans 8 he
[41:43] says in Romans 8 chap uh uh chapter 8
[41:46] ver3 he says for what the law could not
[41:49] do and that it was weak through the
[41:55] flesh
[41:57] God sending his own son in the likeness
[42:00] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[42:03] sin in the flesh I like that because
[42:06] there was no one else that could condemn
[42:07] sin in the flesh everybody that came up
[42:10] to sin oh they they died under the
[42:12] penalty of sin but Christ came he
[42:14] fulfilled the law and he condemned sin
[42:17] in the flesh he conquered sin he
[42:19] conquered death he conquered hell he
[42:21] conquered the grave he conquered all
[42:23] things that the righteousness of the law
[42:26] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[42:28] after the flesh but after the spirit
[42:30] there's the key we want to walk after
[42:32] the uh uh the spirit not after the Flesh
[42:35] and if we were to continue on in
[42:37] Corinthians as I was almost prone to do
[42:40] because it's so uh uh rich and wonderful
[42:43] uh uh Paul would go on and start talking
[42:45] about uh uh the the ministration of
[42:48] death that that Moses brought how he had
[42:50] to be veiled and he would start to say
[42:52] look if if that uh if if the ministry of
[42:54] the law was so glor glorious uh that
[42:57] Moses had to Veil his face and to think
[42:59] that it was so glorious that he had to
[43:01] Veil Veil his face and that that glory
[43:04] is to be done away with that there's
[43:06] another Glory that'll never pass away oh
[43:09] my that that God is veiling himself now
[43:12] in human beings God came under the
[43:14] ministry of of Malachi 4:5 and Luke
[43:17] 17:30 and again he veiled himself God
[43:20] veiling himself that he might unveil
[43:23] himself that you the believer might see
[43:25] the unveiled God standing before you and
[43:28] now the same life that was being veiled
[43:30] to the age could come now and live in
[43:33] you that you now would become veiled but
[43:35] we just want to move towards the thought
[43:37] here uh uh and just continuing in second
[43:39] Corinthians uh uh now in uh verse 17 he
[43:43] says now the Lord is that
[43:46] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[43:48] is there is
[43:51] Liberty now I love
[43:54] that I I don't know what you think about
[43:57] when you say uh where the spirit of the
[43:59] Lord is there is liberty and certainly
[44:01] there is Liberty to worship God in the
[44:03] house of God and there is Liberty to
[44:06] dance and scream and run and shout and
[44:08] do all yes there is Liberty to do all
[44:10] those things but I want to tell you
[44:12] that's really not so much the Liberty
[44:14] especially when you get together and and
[44:16] you know I would say if you've ever uh
[44:18] gone to high school you know on Fridays
[44:20] they they would have what they call
[44:22] their big pepper alties you know go BL
[44:24] go Blue go Big Red we're going to go
[44:26] stomp out whoever this is and they get
[44:28] their fancy sayings and and they do
[44:30] their little banners and everybody comes
[44:32] and does a a big hoop raw and the band
[44:35] plays and everybody cheers and and
[44:37] everybody hollers and you know that's
[44:39] that's not such a big thing to see a
[44:40] bunch of people hollering and screaming
[44:42] it's not such a big thing to see a bunch
[44:44] of people screaming and hollering at a
[44:46] ball game you know that's no big great
[44:48] mystery because they're getting in the
[44:49] spirit but I tell you where there is
[44:51] Liberty when you can be outside of the
[44:53] ball game if you will if you can be
[44:55] outside of the church church house if
[44:56] you can be there on a Monday morning on

[45:58] get your head out of social media you're
[46:00] living in Liberty when you're so drawn
[46:02] to the news and to the politics and that

[47:52] with Malachi
[47:53] 45 I don't need some fancy thing to
[47:56] tickle my eardrums I got the word of
[47:58] life and the words that have been spoken
[48:01] by a Vindicated Prophet they are spirit
[48:03] and they are life and it produces a
[48:08] liberty well
[48:10] Hallelujah but we all with an open face
[48:13] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[48:16] Lord are changed into the same
[48:19] image from glory to
[48:23] glory even as by the spirit of the Lord
[48:26] so what is it that is changing us it is
[48:28] the spirit of the Lord that is changing
[48:30] us from Glory unto glory and maybe if we
[48:33] were to uh uh speak a little this
[48:36] tonight to you we just want to be
[48:37] preaching on changing from glory to
[48:40] glory the prophet of God would say in
[48:42] the unveiling of God he' say and it
[48:44] shall come to pass in the last days
[48:46] saith God see here we are the light over
[48:50] the word as the light of the sun changes
[48:54] the seed from from glory to
[48:59] glory the light of the sun changes the
[49:02] seed from glory to whether you know it
[49:04] or not if you are ripening in the
[49:07] presence of the Sun the seed word that
[49:11] you are by the light of God's word is
[49:14] changing
[49:15] you
[49:17] hallelujah it's changing you oh we're
[49:21] talking about a little liberty we're
[49:23] talking about being changed
[49:27] you realize what if if you're if you're
[49:29] sitting under the revealed word of the
[49:32] hour the light of this day and you are
[49:35] that true word seed that has been spoken
[49:38] that under that light you right now are
[49:40] being changed from one Glory Hallelujah
[49:45] from Glory unto Glory I'm being
[49:49] changed yeah that's what I'm happy
[49:53] about that's what I'm excited about cuz
[49:55] I'm being
[49:58] changed I know what I
[50:02] was I know what I was
[50:05] doing I know what I was
[50:08] thinking I know how lost I was I know
[50:11] how much in darkness I was I know what I
[50:14] thought mattered in life but then
[50:16] something Came Upon me and changed
[50:19] me changed my
[50:22] thinking changed my attitude changed my
[50:26] dressed changed my
[50:29] nature but he wasn't done changing

[50:38] cleanse me and give me the Holy Ghost

[50:55] hour that we're living
[50:57] in that Paul would say I show you a
[51:00] mystery we shall not all
[51:03] sleep
[51:07] Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at
[51:09] people that are that
[51:12] mystery I think you are the mystery of
[51:15] the change of our bodies and you're
[51:18] living under a prophetic word and as you
[51:20] walk you are being changed into his very
[51:23] image into his very likeness hallelujah
[51:26] oh my
[51:28] Hallelujah as the light of the sun
[51:31] changes the seed from glory to glory we
[51:33] also become more like him as we live in
[51:37] his
[51:39] presence like him being conformed to his
[51:42] blessed image as we walk with him watch
[51:46] what the sun
[51:47] does you plant a seed what happens the
[51:51] seed rots inside the seed is life the
[51:55] life comes forth and brings forth the
[51:57] stock now that don't look like the first
[52:00] there's Luther it was a stock all right
[52:02] the stock went on and the first thing
[52:04] you know it brought forth a tassel
[52:07] see that was the Westland Revival wasn't
[52:11] like the other then Along come the
[52:13] Pentecostal Revival see brought forth
[52:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right
[52:17] but what happened we got we get fungus
[52:21] on the
[52:22] ear it begins to look wrong
[52:26] I think some of us might got fungus on
[52:28] the
[52:29] ear we become hard of hearing I know
[52:32] that's not what he's meaning but it
[52:33] sounds pretty
[52:35] good something's stopping it up are you
[52:37] hearing the word of the hour are you
[52:39] becoming the word something's wrong does
[52:41] it look like what was given to us help
[52:44] us
[52:45] Lord help us Lord does this look like
[52:48] Malachi 45 does this look like uh uh
[52:51] Luke 17:30 does this look like I'm
[52:53] talking about me now does it is what I'm
[52:56] manifesting and what I am believe does
[52:58] it look like how it was
[53:02] delivered does it look like what was
[53:06] restored what happens we get a fungus on
[53:08] there it begins to look
[53:10] wrong this thing that thing it don't
[53:14] look like the
[53:16] word it's not like the rest of it it's
[53:18] not like the original grain that went in
[53:21] but God is still there to make that just
[53:25] the same notice what does it do it
[53:28] finally returns back to the original
[53:32] seed again what did he say it shall come
[53:35] to pass in the last days saith God see
[53:39] here we are the light over the word as
[53:41] the light of the sun changes the seed
[53:43] from glory to glory the seed has come
[53:46] back to the
[53:48] original the same seed that went in the
[53:51] ground the same Son of God the same one
[53:54] that went in the ground
[53:56] has now come back in the fullness and
[53:58] full manifestation of the word in the
[54:00] hour that we're in and that is the so in
[54:03] light

[54:08] am that you're sitting in that light and
[54:11] that light is bringing forth the seed

[56:01] any kind of uh oh the letter
[56:04] kth but the spirit giveth life the
[56:06] spirit gives true
[56:08] Liberty may maybe somebody ask yourself
[56:10] is there something you want to quit
[56:13] doing is there something that's been
[56:15] drawing you away from the Lord is there
[56:16] something that you feel condemned about
[56:18] is there a relationship or something
[56:20] that you've entered into and you realize
[56:23] it just doesn't feel quite right
[56:26] and you are struggling to part ways with
[56:29] it that is not
[56:34] Liberty and if you're trying to handle
[56:37] it on your own you're living by the
[56:39] letter and the letter kth the letter
[56:43] will take you out of his presence the
[56:45] the letter will rob you of your joy
[56:46] it'll rob you of your Victory it will
[56:48] kill you it will put you in the grave
[56:51] but you got to come to a place where you
[56:52] say Lord I need the life life of the
[56:55] word I need Deliverance Lord I'm coming
[56:58] back to you I'm repenting for the things
[57:01] that I've done wrong I'm repenting for
[57:03] my relationships Lord there's something
[57:05] in my life it's the little foxes that
[57:07] spoil the vine I can't seem to ever have
[57:09] Victory I can't ever seem to have a
[57:11] prayer life I read my Bible I get
[57:13] nothing out of it I turn on the message
[57:15] I don't hear the voice I'm just the same
[57:17] as I always was we got to get to a place
[57:19] of desperation where we want the life of
[57:22] the word and we have true Liberty
[57:28] oh Lord help
[57:30] us Shake
[57:33] Yourself Liberty in the
[57:37] spirit yes it's a paradox be because we
[57:39] become a
[57:41] prisoner not my will Lord but thy will
[57:44] be
[57:46] done Paul would say in Romans 8:11 he
[57:48] says but it is the spirit of him but if
[57:51] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[57:53] from the dead dwell in you
[57:56] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[57:58] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[58:01] his spirit that dwelleth in
[58:04] you it'll make you
[58:08] alive it will make you live the word it
[58:12] will make you be the
[58:16] word The Same
[58:18] Spirit that is in
[58:20] you the same spirit that was in him
[58:25] now living in
[58:27] you not a portion of the word see
[58:31] justification uh we've moved on up the
[58:33] ladder sanctification we've moved on up
[58:36] the
[58:37] ladder outpouring of the gifts and and
[58:40] all of those things wonderful wonderful
[58:42] we want all of those things and all
[58:43] those things uhh we we we should have
[58:45] those and and want those and be accepted
[58:48] those and believing for but that not
[58:49] even that now we've moved up the ladder
[58:51] now we're in the fullness of the
[58:53] word just Jus ification made way for
[58:56] sanctification sanctification made way
[58:59] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[59:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way
[59:02] for the
[59:04] person the person of Jesus Christ
[59:06] himself the
[59:08] word that same Spirit Hallelujah we've
[59:12] had the Shea wave telling us what it
[59:14] looks like now that's
[59:18] Liberty to be able to walk in newness of
[59:21] life knowing what you are becoming

[59:25] from this glory to that glory Lord that
[59:27] I'm walking in your presence and the
[59:30] Very seed word that I am is being
[59:32] changed by the message of the hour and

[1:00:33] sin will cause this church to bitterly
[1:00:36] fail and you think your private time

[1:03:36] Rapture if you don't have a revelation
[1:03:38] of cutting your pray for it you think
[1:03:41] you can clip it burn it break it it

[1:03:59] bald please I have more respect for
[1:04:05] that I know it's coming hard
[1:04:08] but what I'm wanting to say is pray for
[1:04:13] Revelation let's not be playing Church
[1:04:16] let's realize that if we are testifying
[1:04:19] and if we are saying that we're message
[1:04:22] Believers we're taking communion we're
[1:04:24] confessing I got the Holy Ghost we're
[1:04:25] giving prayer to God and then in our
[1:04:27] private lives we're living
[1:04:31] contrary it affects the whole body but
[1:04:33] we want the same spirit in you the
[1:04:35] prophet of God said and we find here
[1:04:38] that out that God always had skin on
[1:04:42] him when Moses seen him he had skin on
[1:04:45] him look like a man when God was behind
[1:04:47] curtains he had skin on him and God
[1:04:50] tonight is in his church is veiled in
[1:04:53] his church with skin on it he is still
[1:04:57] the same God tonight and we find that he
[1:05:01] said but now as ever this skin Veil is
[1:05:04] what catches the Traditions they just
[1:05:07] can't believe that it is god making them
[1:05:10] people act like that see it's because
[1:05:13] God is veiled in his church in skin skin
[1:05:17] on it that's right he is hid from the
[1:05:20] unbeliever and revealed to the believer
[1:05:22] oh God I want to be you with skin on
[1:05:26] it that my talking and my walking and my
[1:05:29] acting it's his very life the same
[1:05:32] quickening power the quickening spirit
[1:05:35] living in
[1:05:37] me I'm not going to stop short of it
[1:05:40] I'll preach it just as hard because and
[1:05:43] I'm going to say it just as hard because
[1:05:45] I believe every word that was spoken by
[1:05:48] Malachi 4:5 and there's something in my
[1:05:51] heart it's been written on the tables of
[1:05:54] my heart that I will fulfill every word
[1:05:57] that has been spoken because greater is
[1:05:59] he that is in me than he that is in the
[1:06:01] world and if that if I am a seed word of
[1:06:04] his then he has put the power of
[1:06:06] transformation into my life to become
[1:06:09] everything that he
[1:06:11] spoke and I don't want to stop
[1:06:14] short hey you open up a book you want to
[1:06:17] keep reading
[1:06:18] it he says and Jesus says As it was in
[1:06:21] the days of Sodom so shall it be at the
[1:06:23] coming of the son of man deity veiled
[1:06:26] again in human flesh now didn't didn't
[1:06:29] you remember Jesus say when the Son of
[1:06:31] God is being revealed and Luke the 17th
[1:06:35] chapter I believe about the 20 uh 21st
[1:06:37] verse somewhere along there he said and
[1:06:38] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:06:41] the son of man back in the church again
[1:06:43] revealed in human
[1:06:47] beings oh we've seen the sheath wave we
[1:06:50] we we've seen uh the Divine promise of
[1:06:52] scripture and the son of man being
[1:06:54] revealed but now what is being revealed
[1:06:57] is now wanting to be veiled in
[1:07:00] you back in the church again revealed in
[1:07:03] human beings not Son of God but the son
[1:07:06] of man again back in his church again in
[1:07:10] these last
[1:07:11] days all right so now we'll just break a
[1:07:16] little into our text here just speaking
[1:07:18] of Quicken Quicken means to cause to

[1:09:41] Thy
[1:09:42] word God veiling himself in your skin
[1:09:44] quickening you to cause the Quicken
[1:09:46] means to cause to live to make
[1:09:50] alive give life spiritual power to to to
[1:09:54] arouse or invigorate to restore life to
[1:09:58] give increase of Life thus a physical
[1:10:01] life of spirit quickening as it respects
[1:10:04] the spirit endued with a new and greater
[1:10:07] power of life I like this portion of it
[1:10:10] says metaphorically of seeds quickened
[1:10:13] into life germinating springing up and
[1:10:16] growing Hallelujah that's what it is the
[1:10:19] quickening powers come upon the seed of
[1:10:21] of the word that you are and you're
[1:10:23] you're springing up and
[1:10:25] growing yes Lord I believe it I'm
[1:10:28] springing up I'm growing Lord I might I
[1:10:31] might not be what I see in your word but
[1:10:32] I sure ain't what I I used to be I've
[1:10:34] been quickened I'm springing up I'm
[1:10:36] growing the old things of the world
[1:10:38] they're falling by the wayside Lord I'm
[1:10:40] getting closer and closer into thy
[1:10:43] image now this is just the the my
[1:10:46] inspiration right here uh that we want
[1:10:48] to preach from for a little bit uh
[1:10:50] brother brandom says this in power of
[1:10:52] transformation he says
[1:10:54] now
[1:10:59] transforming he says I used to work for
[1:11:01] a Public Service
[1:11:03] Company where we had
[1:11:06] Transformers and to transform now the
[1:11:08] word is the word means in itself
[1:11:11] something like to transform means
[1:11:14] something that's been
[1:11:17] changed something that's changed from
[1:11:20] one thing to
[1:11:22] another changed from one thing to
[1:11:27] another Paul would say in 1 Corinthians
[1:11:29] 15:52 he say in a moment and a twinkling
[1:11:32] of an eye at the last Trump for the
[1:11:35] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[1:11:38] be raised in corruptible and we shall
[1:11:42] be changed
[1:11:47] transformed Hebrews because change means
[1:11:51] to
[1:11:52] transform Hebrews 11:5 says by faith
[1:11:56] Enoch was
[1:11:58] translated that he should not see death
[1:12:00] and was not found because God had
[1:12:02] translated him for before his
[1:12:04] translation he had this testimony that
[1:12:07] he pleased
[1:12:09] God translated means
[1:12:13] changed so changed transformed
[1:12:16] translated
[1:12:18] quickened Enoch was quickened he was
[1:12:21] changed he was translated
[1:12:24] he was walking with
[1:12:28] God under the word for his hour for his
[1:12:31] day Walking with
[1:12:33] God and all of a sudden one
[1:12:36] day he took his last step on this side
[1:12:40] and God said look it's just time to come
[1:12:42] on home now whether you know it or not
[1:12:46] Enoch is your
[1:12:50] type brother brother brandom said
[1:12:52] something along lives it'll just be like
[1:12:54] a regular Rapture
[1:12:58] routine you'll just be walking
[1:13:01] along you say Lord I love you so much
[1:13:05] Lord I'm thinking of my brother over
[1:13:07] there he has an infirmity in his body
[1:13:10] and I pray that you would touch him and
[1:13:13] all of a sudden you're going to look at
[1:13:14] your hand and be like where did the
[1:13:15] wrinkles
[1:13:19] go that brother's just going to
[1:13:21] transport over like I thought you were
[1:13:22] thinking about me huh
[1:13:24] look at this huh you thought I could
[1:13:26] move then look at watch me now a new
[1:13:29] body prophet of God said Enoch walked
[1:13:31] with God whatever God said
[1:13:36] do Enoch never missed one word he walked
[1:13:40] with God what was he he was a Son of God
[1:13:45] he was an eagle that had been called to
[1:13:48] that
[1:13:49] day and when it come time he was so full
[1:13:53] of that quickening power remember he
[1:13:57] walked 500 years or more before God and
[1:14:01] not one time had he missed his
[1:14:04] word not one time did he misbehave
[1:14:08] himself not one time did he but kept the
[1:14:13] testimony everything that God told him
[1:14:16] to do he went and done
[1:14:18] it no argument about it makes me think
[1:14:22] of that quot and power transport quit
[1:14:24] quit
[1:14:26] arguing quit arguing about who you are
[1:14:28] and what you are and accept it he just
[1:14:32] went and done it no matter what anybody
[1:14:35] else thought he went and done it why he
[1:14:37] was full of that quickening
[1:14:40] power and when it come time for the old
[1:14:43] man to die God just sent down the ladder
[1:14:46] and he walked up home he was quick he
[1:14:49] quickened him and took his mortal body
[1:14:52] up in Rapture that's the quickening
[1:14:59] power quit trying to change
[1:15:05] yourself quit trying to live the
[1:15:09] message it's the power of God that
[1:15:11] quickens you to the message it's the
[1:15:14] power of God that quickens the word in
[1:15:16] your life quit trying to do it
[1:15:20] yourself quit trying to solve your own
[1:15:26] problems what does transform
[1:15:33] mean to
[1:15:35] change from one thing to
[1:15:39] another that's what the power of God
[1:15:41] does is it
[1:15:43] changes one thing to
[1:15:46] another I mean think about it what
[1:15:48] looked like a regular day at the
[1:15:51] office you is walking along and all
[1:15:55] sudden the quickening power the power of
[1:15:58] transformation changed him from one
[1:16:01] atmosphere to
[1:16:03] another transformed changed from one
[1:16:07] thing to
[1:16:08] another that's what I

[1:16:58] upset she'd been sick for who knows how
[1:17:01] long she even went to the a church and
[1:17:03] was prayed for her and the prophet said
[1:17:06] she was going to be healed and she got
[1:17:07] back and she was testifying and her own
[1:17:09] family told her you're being a
[1:17:11] reproach maybe it's time you stop

[1:17:40] little hungry she she took a little
[1:17:42] rolled o there and started to eat on it

[1:17:48] couldn't even keep it down but she got a
[1:17:50] little hungry so she had another one and
[1:17:53] and before you knew
[1:17:55] it she had eaten a whole bowl of oats
[1:17:58] and she realized I'm

[1:18:29] it was the angel of the Lord passing
[1:18:32] through the neighborhood to confirm his
[1:18:34] word with signs and wonders following it
[1:18:38] it was the power of transformation to
[1:18:40] change one thing to another sick to Ill
[1:18:44] I pray oh God May the angel of the Lord

[1:18:57] pass through here and change you from
[1:18:59] one thing Hallelujah to
[1:19:04] another the power of
[1:19:08] transformation I'm thankful for what God
[1:19:10] did for me in
[1:19:12] 1999 changed my
[1:19:15] life but praise God he didn't leave me
[1:19:18] like that oh
[1:19:20] my I thought I'd done done something
[1:19:24] and as high as I was soaring in the
[1:19:26] heavenlies I haven't even began to set
[1:19:29] my wings in
[1:19:31] soar I had been set free and oh what a
[1:19:34] glorious day that was that Victory Day
[1:19:37] when the power of transformation came
[1:19:39] into my life and changed me from a
[1:19:41] sinner to a Son of God filled with the
[1:19:44] Holy Ghost oh there was nothing ever
[1:19:46] like it but ever since then it's been a
[1:19:49] growing it's been a learning it's been a
[1:19:52] transform for ING as I'm walking in Theo
[1:19:55] in light of God's word it's constantly
[1:19:57] changing that seed word in the very
[1:19:59] image of
[1:20:01] Christ and there got to be something
[1:20:03] inside of you hungering for
[1:20:09] that there has to be something in you
[1:20:11] hungering and thirsting for that I'm
[1:20:14] talking about the power of
[1:20:15] transformation changing you from one
[1:20:17] thing to another that's what some of us
[1:20:19] need here to maybe that's the simplest
[1:20:20] thought I can I can say that where we're
[1:20:22] at tonight is somebody here needs the
[1:20:25] power of transformation to change you
[1:20:27] from one thing to
[1:20:31] another we've we've we've we've been
[1:20:33] going too
[1:20:35] long living one way without having
[1:20:38] totally V total victory in our
[1:20:40] lives it's it's it's going home
[1:20:43] time I believe every single one of us
[1:20:46] should be hungering and thirsting for
[1:20:49] total
[1:20:51] Deliverance
[1:20:54] complete and total Deliverance in our
[1:20:56] lives that we could be changed from our
[1:20:59] situation from our bondage for the
[1:21:01] things that we're living
[1:21:04] in that's what happened to the woman at
[1:21:06] the
[1:21:10] well Christ showed up on the
[1:21:13] scene and and an impossible
[1:21:16] situation was
[1:21:18] changed from one thing to another
[1:21:23] oh we could think of story after
[1:21:26] story of the quickening
[1:21:29] power Lazarus was dead he didn't have a
[1:21:32] thought coming he was
[1:21:35] gone he was off in another atmosphere
[1:21:38] another
[1:21:39] realm but the quickening power Lazarus
[1:21:42] come
[1:21:44] forth I pray we could build your faith
[1:21:47] that we could see the same thing in our
[1:21:49] church in our young people in our lives
[1:21:52] and in your private life in your family
[1:21:54] in your
[1:21:55] home that the power of transformation
[1:21:57] will get a hold of you and change you
[1:21:59] change your attitude change your hunger
[1:22:01] for the word change the way you dress
[1:22:04] change the way you act change the way
[1:22:05] you feed change the way you
[1:22:06] eat change the way you hunger for this
[1:22:09] word change you from a Critic to an
[1:22:14] encourager said I've always critiquing
[1:22:17] and criticizing the preacher why' you
[1:22:18] amen the
[1:22:20] preacher maybe he's learning maybe he's
[1:22:22] growing maybe it's never attained to the
[1:22:24] amount of knowledge and growth that you
[1:22:26] have and all your amening that you ever
[1:22:29] do is to let everybody else know you
[1:22:31] already knew
[1:22:34] that how you hear it all the
[1:22:39] time
[1:22:41] yep but if we can get into one mind and
[1:22:44] one
[1:22:45] Accord then we'll be in tune for regular
[1:22:48] Rapture
[1:22:49] routine well we are that Mighty Church
[1:22:51] we're we're all in one mind and Accord
[1:22:53] where it might be just another regular
[1:22:57] day I love the story of John
[1:23:00] Ryan man it was just another haircut it
[1:23:03] was just another beard
[1:23:06] trim he sat down there no telling no
[1:23:09] telling old blind John Ryan was sitting
[1:23:12] there and the barber said hold on y'all
[1:23:15] listen he's going to say it all again I
[1:23:18] told you this is oh is that him is that
[1:23:20] the guy you're talking about every time
[1:23:21] he comes in here every time he testifies
[1:23:25] to me that he can see
[1:23:27] watch it's just going to be the same as
[1:23:30] it always was he's going to come in here
[1:23:32] and say that he can see a and it's just
[1:23:34] the funniest thing you ever did here but
[1:23:37] what happened that
[1:23:39] time just seemed like another regular
[1:23:44] day but then the quickening power
[1:23:47] came changed the situation from
[1:23:51] one I once was
[1:23:54] blind Hallelujah but now I can
[1:23:59] see if you've ever been
[1:24:02] blind and your eyes have ever been
[1:24:04] opened if you've ever been in prison if
[1:24:08] you've ever been in bondage and you've
[1:24:10] ever been set
[1:24:12] free now I'm talking about Liberty
[1:24:16] Hallelujah being changed from one thing
[1:24:20] to
[1:24:21] another
[1:24:23] that's the quickening
[1:24:25] power we could go just thinking of
[1:24:28] stories I think I think of uh uh gyrus
[1:24:31] daughter think think of the story of
[1:24:33] gyrus he had finally got to
[1:24:36] Jesus his 12-year-old daughter was
[1:24:38] laying there
[1:24:42] dying I think it's kind of an
[1:24:43] interesting story because here he
[1:24:45] finally gets to the feet of Jesus and
[1:24:46] somebody else butts in
[1:24:49] line right he finally gets to Jes Jesus
[1:24:52] and here comes the S phenician woman she
[1:24:54] had a neede
[1:24:56] too I I I can't imagine here he is he
[1:24:59] waits he watched this this unfold and
[1:25:02] and and she come down there and touched
[1:25:03] the him of was garbage you know the
[1:25:04] story I perceive virtue has gone from me
[1:25:06] and she was healed and now it comes to
[1:25:09] his
[1:25:12] turn and it finally comes to his turn
[1:25:15] for his audience with the master and and
[1:25:17] his servant comes
[1:25:19] says
[1:25:21] gyus trouble not the
[1:25:26] master she's dead she's
[1:25:28] gone I I can't imagine how
[1:25:34] overwhelming the news to the gyrus was
[1:25:37] in that moment as gyrus heard that come
[1:25:40] forth and say your daughter's dead
[1:25:44] trouble him not but you know what's neat
[1:25:46] about that story is gyrus wasn't the
[1:25:49] only one that heard
[1:25:51] that yeah the scripture says and Jesus
[1:25:55] heard
[1:26:00] it you ain't the only one that heard

[1:26:15] all the reports and telling you your
[1:26:16] sickness and your condition and
[1:26:18] everything that you've been B somebody
[1:26:20] else heard that too
[1:26:23] and Jesus heard it he said fear not only
[1:26:26] believe
[1:26:31] Hallelujah and Christ changed it from
[1:26:35] what would have been a
[1:26:37] funeral Glory am what would have been a
[1:26:42] a Mourning what would have been a a
[1:26:45] heartache he changed it from one thing

[1:27:14] men it's
[1:27:19] impossible with men and with doctors
[1:27:21] some things are
[1:27:23] impossible but my Bible tells me with

[1:36:52] power of God that's brought you this
[1:36:55] far the same spirit that spoke that has

[1:38:50] St
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:56] oh a prophet
[1:38:59] said Moses's Veil he was the Living Word
[1:39:04] to the
[1:39:05] people and
[1:39:07] today the people that are veiled are the
[1:39:09] same
[1:39:10] thing they are written Epistles read of
[1:39:13] all
[1:39:14] men not a new
[1:39:16] epistle but the epistle that's been
[1:39:19] written made manifest
[1:39:21] it's those who believe the word and the
[1:39:25] promise of this
[1:39:27] day that God is pouring out his Spirit
[1:39:31] upon All Flesh and that is written
[1:39:34] Epistles and when a person tries to
[1:39:37] carnally impersonate impersonate
[1:39:39] that it
[1:39:42] backfires your life shows what you
[1:39:48] are Paul said put ye on the Lord Jesus
[1:39:52] Christ to make no provision for the
[1:39:55] flesh to fulfill the lust
[1:39:58] thereof now before we let you go I want
[1:40:00] you to allow that
[1:40:04] word to settle in your heart that you
[1:40:07] are to be the word veiled just like
[1:40:08] Moses was you are to be the word veiled
[1:40:11] just like Malachi 4:5 was you are to be
[1:40:13] the word veiled written Epistles read of
[1:40:16] all
[1:40:17] men the word made manifest for those who
[1:40:21] believe the word and the promise of this
[1:40:23] day it's God pouring out his
[1:40:26] spirit is that's what's happening in
[1:40:28] your
[1:40:34] life it'd be okay for you to say you
[1:40:36] know what Lord I don't see
[1:40:38] that the question is is do you want
[1:40:46] it it's not enough just to say
[1:40:49] Amen
[1:40:51] it's not
[1:40:53] enough oh brother Matthew I got quote
[1:40:55] after quote after quote well
[1:40:57] okay do you have the
[1:41:00] life the Devils believe fear and
[1:41:06] tremble I think I want to say that Lord
[1:41:09] give me a hunger and
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:12] thirst to when I amen these things I see
[1:41:15] laying in your word to start to have a
[1:41:16] hunger and thirst for them to be
[1:41:17] manifested in my
[1:41:19] life that the Lord would pour out his
[1:41:21] spirit in my life and make me a written
[1:41:25] epistle and to know Lord when I try to
[1:41:28] do it on my own it
[1:41:29] backfires it's because I make provision
[1:41:31] for the flesh everything in in Satan's
[1:41:33] Eden is trying to make provision for
[1:41:35] your flesh your job civilization
[1:41:38] education science and all those things
[1:41:40] it's all just trying to make a provision
[1:41:41] for your
[1:41:43] flesh but God has sent a
[1:41:46] message to make provision that could
[1:41:48] bring you into his presence before we
[1:41:51] let you go I just pray
[1:41:53] that you just ask God to pour a spirit
[1:41:56] out in your
[1:41:57] life not talking about some outside
[1:42:00] anointing I'm talking about the
[1:42:02] quickening power of God to pour into

[1:52:18] couldn't we'd either leave better or
[1:52:19] worse
