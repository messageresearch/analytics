because we were [Music] nothing we were L those that had lost in this world but your grace found us the grace brought us back oh Lord when we consider that in the Old Testament without the high priest he was the only one that had the privilege to get into your presence but today that [Music] Grace had given us all the opportunity to come into your presence to contemplate your glory to contemplate your magnificence oh how we love you we want to commit ourselves into your hands that throughout to [Music] service that you yourself may be in action because your word it's spirit and life may your presence take control over everything as we as we take your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen um as we still standing let's take our Bibles in Genesis chapter 1 she um Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light let's also turn to uh The Book of Mark chapter 11 Mark Mark 11 we'll read uh verse 12 so Mark 11 verse2 and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was [Music] hungry and seeing a fig tree a far off Heaven leaves he came um if happily he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of the Fig was not yet here and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eateth of thee thereafter forever and his disciples heard it we're going to go to verse 20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the root and Peter called to remembrance and said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away Jesus and Jesus answered and said said unto him have faith in in God Amen for verily I say unto you that whatsoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he had said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you that what whatsoever things ye desire When you pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them let's pray Lord once again we present to you the service we read your word but it's you that can interpret it for us may you do it as we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen have your seats I believe we once again happy to be in the house of God tonight after that blessing this morning I I believe we all appreciated the word of God this [Music] morning uh since the service last Sunday the Wednesday and this Sunday it was such a blessing I was wondering what am I going to [Music] say I T about the brother a brother of color that brother bam talks about talks about it in Israel and the church there was said there was a brother a colge brother who always had his Bible and he always had his Bible with him all the time and somebody asked him why do you always carry your Bible that way he said it's because I believe it with all my heart they told him why you can't read it how do you say you believe the Bible he said I believe it from cover to cover he said how do you believe it if you can't read he said on the cover it's written Holy Bible and that's why I believe it from cover to cover and as I was thinking about that something came on my heart that I'm going to title only believe only believe we know that in life sometimes we believe things because we live in the maybe we live in a dimension where those things are visible today if they say brother Paul I'm going to say I'm going to answer why because my father my caral father who in the flesh he made me believe since my birth that your name is Paul that when they say Paul it's you and I believe it and every time they say Paul I'm going to say it's me because they made me believe that by my Earthly father and we believe easily those things which are taught by us in the natural we believe it more than what our heavenly father tells us we know that our heavenly father from this the the the word he told us that every time they say Christian it's you but many many times in this world the the devil and his unbelief the devil wants to make you believe that when they say Christian it's not you because every time when you fail but when they say Paul it's it's always you but when they say Christian The Devil Makes you believe that you are not Christian as where your heavenly father has told you that you are a Christian he wants you to be a Christian that you he wants you to be in His image the problem as brother tells us that there's seven dimensions that we are living in a dimension of material or matter of light of time and we have the five senses to be in contact with those things with those five senses we we believe easily because we see because we hear because we touch because we we taste and if it's that way we believe that easily as we heard it on Wednesday if we go back a 100 years ago and somebody told us that as we are right now I am we are I'm able to see here what my brother is doing in brazille we would say that's not true and it's not possible because our five senses it doesn't allow us to to gain access to that Dimension and to know at this instant what's happening somewhere else in the world but today science uh the children children of Kane they have brought us cell phones intelligent phone the Android phone and I can have my WhatsApp video and I put a number I get access to the fourth dimension I'm I'm not going to brazaville but I'm able to see what's happening in brazaville right right here now why because something has given me access to that fourth dimension and as my eyes have seen it and so it's like that fourth dimension has been brought into our Dimension and that my my my Earthly body my carnal body believes that easily but we know that is also a dimension of God that that Dimension is not far away from us Braille is not far away from us the problem that God has to give us the ability to also access that Dimension but the son of Cain they cannot give us access to that dimension in contrary everything that they will create is to try to distract us is to try to keep us away from this other dimension where we can access the things of God and to bring back the things of God to the dimension that we are living in that's why the Bible says that Faith it's it's an assurance a firm Assurance of things that we hope for an Evidence of things that we not seen it's it's the things that the five the five senses cannot help us access but God has to give us a six sense he has to give us Faith so we can access that Dimension and to bring in existence the things that the world think is impossible if we thought that uh communicating and seeing someone was impossible and now we see that it's possible as Christians we have so much evidence to believe that God is real if we can only access in that other dimension nothing will be impossible look at the Prophet Elijah elishah he was he was all surrounded by by serans and his his servant GAA began to uh he was afraid oh Master what are we going to do look at how we are surrounded we are without hope there's so many of them they are all with weapons that there's no way we're going to get out of this but Elijah he was in contact with the dimension of God Elijah knew that the one who was in him greater than he that was in the world Elisha knew that those that were with them was more than those of the syrians but he was shaking because he didn't have access to that Elijah pray oh father he said open his eyes my prayer tonight that God may open our eyes that we may get access to that dimension of God that we may possess everything that he's given us God opened the eyes of G and when GZA saw all around them there were millions of millions of angels the attitude of G changed G who was trembling today if the enemy is making you fear I'm going to pray like Elijah pray that the Lord may open your eyes that you may realize that the master of impossibility he's on your side often time we conform we we get used to because the world is getting us uh to conform I go to church it's that's enough every time I go to church I'm a Christian it's enough and isah was but when says Isaiah was a good boy and he he had he admired the king OAS and the King also liked him but one day the king oiah made a mistake God uh uh corrected him asah who was just a brother who was coming to church he understood that that was not enough he went in the temple he started confessing he said oh Lord I'm just a man with unclean lips I live with the people with unclean lips he was so sincere in his prayer that God took him into that dimension he found himself in the presence of God he saw God sitting on his throne with the angels that were shouting holy holy holy is the Lord when Isaiah came across that experience he was never the same he was no longer the same brother who was just happy coming to church when God said who shall go for us he was ready he said here I am send me because he left the dimension of five senses to get into this dimension where he was going to believe only believe only believe all the promises that God made in the Bible belongs to us there's no exception there's no exclusion often time it's the devil who's trying to exclude you but God is telling you that all the promises from cover to cover belongs to you as true as you can believe a word that Immortals tell you I want you tonight that God help me that I may believe everything that God said has everything belongs to me that the impossible that the what that which is impossible does not belong to God but if we believe nothing is impossible to God we also have to believe that nothing is impossible to us yes sir and we have to fight we have to go forward to to gain access to every promise like the children of Israel God promised them the gave them a promise of the promis land but when they got there they have to fight for every inch of it and God wants us to persevere and to see that everyone in the Bible who obtains something they were perseverant in what they were finding the devil can put all kinds of obstacles but God wants us to persevere that we continue to fight says in the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 425 he said all right I open my I open my heart and my mind come in Lord Jesus and grab the faith the sword of the spirit thou sayth the Lord hallelujah amen scream hallelujah amen then cut down every enemy in front of you amen there it is cut every enemy if an old spooky Spirit making you feel all cut it cut the thing away with the word of the Lord by but our strength is the joy of the Lord is our strength if there's something bothering you but the say get away from me cut it away with the word that it may be a demon whether it be an enemy whether it be a sickness whether it be a disease whatever it is take that word pull it out with a sword with a sword and if you work it the first time and you don't seem to move work it again and work it again and walk it again and walk it again and work it until you chip it you chip a hole through it like a little chicken peeping it ping itself out or an eagle what you are amen because we are not chickens we are eagles is it like like or an eagle yourself through that through that old Shell of sickness cut your cut cut away it said cut you away and say hallelujah hallelujah where is the next one where's the next one I already uh uh overcame the first I I whack it so many times so that I can get rid of it but where's the next one that's the battle that's a soldier that's a soldier of the Cross yes sir knock every enemy out and an enemy for a Christian it's all unbelief anything that brings you to doubt the word of God you got to whack it if the first whacking is not enough whack it again for the until you get rid of that unbelief and you find yourself in the presence of God to believe that everything that God said will bring will come to pass and that your situation is not impossible if it's disease when we take the Bible oh I like that old colored man because from cover to cover we have promises for everything concerning us for every situation that we have there's a promise if you are sick you say you take Psalm 103 it said I am your God who forgiveth you of all your iniquities and who health of all thy diseases he didn't say I'm able to heal disease but for other diseases I'm not able to he said I am your God who forgive of all thy iniquity and who health of you of all that diseases you take Isaiah 53 he was he was wounded for our transgression and it's by his stripes that we are healed so many times the trouble tried to disturb us uh this this afternoon before coming to church I had a a a really terrible headache I told my wife I have a headache I I I took the uh the blood pressure and I was measuring my blood pressure it was really high 16 and 11 161 I told my wife they said this is the proof of my healing because when the devil is fighting like this it means he knows that God is doing something because in 2015 I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease uh I was diagnosed with a chronic uh kidney disease and uh in 200 19 19 I had a biopsy for the uh uh kidneys and 2022 when my wife was sick my situation got a little worse and for medicine I am a doctor so when we open the book of uh of medicine it says that the insufficient uh uh uh chronic that it's not a heal a disease that can be healed it's it's it could you could stabilize it or it gets worse but when I open this book my true heavenly father told me it's by my stripes that you were healed he says I am your lord who forgive all th iniquity and who Health all of all th diseases I told the doctors the true book told me and I'm going to bring you the testimony that God healed me and I'm going to do like John Ryan I'm going to start testifying that glory to God I am healed and I know that my confession will bring this Earthly body to obey to that confession to believe that my God is alive that is able to heal every disease that the enemy has no right that the enemy has no [Music] power I was telling my wife I was healed because in 2022 when it got worse the the blood pressure was so high there was about four different medication for blood pressure that I was taking to help and sometimes in the a night after I finished the uh uh the supper uh my my daughters they were even uh moving oh they were fighting to go get my medicine for me because they know that I had to take the medicine but I believe but God healed me he healed me says hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord he didn't heal me because I wanted it because it's him it's him that did it he didn't even ask for my permission to say that I give my life so you can be healed all that I had to do only believe is to just believe it only believe only believe and that same God he not just there to heal our flesh because he can heal us today and tomorrow we're going to die but what does he want from us we heard it this morning to bring us to Perfection to bring me to bring us to something greater to believe that we are called to something that is perfect brother says in Hebrews 5 and 6 uh first part paragraph 104 he said Paul said let us lay aside those things now it said that's that's all right but we'll do this we'll baptize the people we lay hands on them for the healing and so forth we could take it verse by verse and each one of those things baptism we believe it there's one hope there's one Lord there's one Faith there's one baptism we believe all the we believe there those things we believe there's one baptism we believe in the resurrection of the Dead absolutely we believe that Jesus died and rose again we believe that laying on the hands for the sick that's what it says these son shall follow them that believe if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover we believe that but but what he said Paul said Paul said it's all dead works that's something that you do now let's go on to Perfection oh my we are coming into the Tabernacle not the foundation the foundation is everything we believe it's important it's the foundation we are entering we are coming into the Tabernacle the Tabernacle itself that's the foundation the law and the righteousness joining church and being baptized laying on hands it says them is all orders of the church but now let's go let's go into perfection there's only one that is perfected how do we get into him through the Methodist no no Pentecostal no no to baptist no no through any church no no the Catholic Roman Roman Catholic no no before we go on I was thinking about something let's open our Bibles in Hebrews 10 Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews 10 verse4 the Bible says for one for by one offering he had perfected he had perfected for every them that are San IFI wherefore the Holy Ghost also is witness to us for after he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them it's him that's saying it this is the Covenant that I will make with with them that after those days say the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquity will I remember no more now this is the Lord saying it's not your effort he is saying that all that he's asking you is to believe that he's talking about you that it's not about somebody else to somebody else but it's you that he's talking about so the Covenant that he's making with you that he himself will put his law into your heart that he will that he will he said that in the mind I will write them and their sins their sins and iniquity I will remember no more now where where remission of these is there there's no more offering for sin and see having therefore Brethren so I want where it says having therefore Brethren that everyone puts their own name and see them and then I'll say therefore Paul it says we boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living [Music] Way he consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and we know that his flesh John 1 tells us that it's the word that he consecrated a way for us through his word that he wants us to believe that this this this new consecrated way was created for you that this Blood the lamb is for me and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart as Isaiah did it in fullness and Assurance of Faith only only believe and our heart sprinkled with with an evil conscience and our body washed with pure water let hold fast to the profession of our faith because the one who made the promise he's faithful the one who made the promise he's faithful he said that he himself will establish a covenant with you that he may not remember no your sin no longer that that your iniquity that by his word that he has concentrated a new way for you so you can come to Perfection says paragraph 109 it said how do we get in into it Romans 8 and9 8 And1 there's therefore now no condemnation to those that are in Christ how do we get in there is now no condemnation for those that are in Christ th not walk not after the things of the World the Flesh but after the things of the spirit that pay no attention to what the world has got to say even if you are sick the doctor say you're going to die pay no attention to it it it don't bother you a bit if they'll tell you you have to become you have to become a Catholic to be saved or a presbyterian or have to do this you pay no attention to it no condemnation to to them that are in Christ Jesus why because he made the Covenant to forgive all your iniquity and all your sins he says who wal not after the flesh the things that they see they no longer walk after the things that they see everything that you see with your eyes is Earthly but the things that you see in your spirit through the word the the word is God's looking M Glass that reflect what he is and what you are hallelujah hallelujah oh my it tells you this is the only book in the world that tells you where you come from who you are and where you going show me a page of Lit Literature anywhere with all the science and anything else any good book that's been written none of them can tell you that this is God Looking Glass that shows you what he is and what you are so if you want to know what you are don't listen to what your neighbor is telling you don't tell you what your friend is telling don't listen to what your friend is telling you don't tell don't listen to what your parents are telling you if it's contrary to the word but what is telling you what you should be it's the word of God and this word of God says you have to go towards the Perfection and we have to believe it with all our heart says I'm going to skip a little bit paragraph 114 it says that's the thing that I have done a minister baptize you whether he baptized you you face forward or backwards and and and three times times four times or one thing or he says oh how he did it it has nothing to do with it you are baptized to enter into the Fellowship of the of that church [Music] anyhow proving to that church that you believe in the death burial and resurrection of Christ laying on on hands the uh uh to heal the sick that's wonderful but that's all natural and that body will die again just as certain as you are alive he will die again now let's lay aside all those things go into perfection we get into Perfection that's what we want to know Christ has perfected we heard it this morning God laid upon him the iniquity of us all he was wounded for our transgressions Bru for our iniquity the the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed that's the body we want to get into that's the body why if you are in that body you will never see judgment you will never taste of death you are free from all death judgment sin anything else when you are in that body when you are in the body of Christ when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost when Christ himself comes and dwells inside of your heart you are free from all sins you are free from all the death of judgment how do we get in into it preacher by joining this Tabernacle you are lost yet couldn't you couldn't join anyhow we don't have any book how do we get into it by joining some church no sir how do we get into it you are born into it 1 Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body to form one body by the by the Holy Holy Spirit baptism we are baptized into the body and are free from sin that's what we heard this morning the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth that the person of Christ in our lives is the only is the thing that brings us into that perfection he said God can't see us he he says he can't see as he only sees Christ and when you are in that body God can judge that body he's already judged it he took our judgment and invited us in just a simple invit it says it's by faith just believe only believe that body was already judged and he says that all of us we have the right to access that body we said we have a promise for everything that happens oh can I receive the Holy Ghost he says that promise is for you for your children and all those that are far off and as many as our Lord God shall call it means that promise is for you but you can only receive it when you believe that if you want to receive it that if you come closer to receive it he says he's already judged them he he took our judgment and invited us in and by faith through Grace not even our own effort not even our own emotion it's not our movement it's by his grace by by faith that we walk and accept our pardoning and the Holy Ghost brings us into that into this fellowship with him and we walk no more after the things of the world but we walk in the spirit quick awakened the word come to us he died for my stad I'm Made Alive here I am who was dead once in sins and trespass and has been and by my trespass and have been made alive all my desires is to serve him all my desires is to serve him all my love is to him he says all my walk want to be in his name it says and whatever that I go that I may glorify him whatever I do that I'm if I'm hunting or fish if I'm playing ball whatever I'm doing I must be Christ in me in such a life that will make men long to be that way not not tattling or backbiting or sing about the churches you get it the same way as we read in Genesis that the the world was form without form and void and there was Darkness upon the face of the Earth the word of God said let there be light and there was light if my life is without form and void filled with Darkness the same word that was pronounced in Genesis that the same word tonight that is capable of telling my life let there be light and certainly light was show showed up in the Genesis that the light will be for will come forth in my life that I may be like Christ that I may go towards Perfection says I'm going I'm about to close in the patmas vision paragraph 250 he says there he stands the mighty conqueror since he rent the veil in two there he is he has he has the key of both death hell and the and and hanging on my side he said fear not laid his right hand his power upon him on John he's talking about John and raised them up by the power of His right hand he said don't fear he's doing the same thing with each and every one of us in the place of John he said fear not it says I am he that was I him that is and that shall come I'm the first and the last I am he that liveth and died and is alive again forever more amen amen oh Behold The Mighty conqueror so Behold Him in plain view there he stands the mighty conqueror since he rent the veil in two cut every obstacle from the human being he cut all obstacles for human being there are no more obstacles for us to go to him because Jesus removed all the obstacles to open to us the way that he may be that he might be connected like in the Garden of Eden it says I'm going to choke up but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent when God said man is more powerful it's like Jesus it's not like he's running around oh you'll see what I'll do Jesus who had all power he was he was veiled in humility and even when he was healing he didn't say I did it he said your faith your faith your faith healed you oh I never seen such great faith he didn't say I did and that's all powerful that's where God wants us to be he said man is omnipotent a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11 and22 what whatsoever things you say and doubt not in your heart it'll come to [Music] pass it will come to pass not because I said it we read in Hebrews but the one who made the promise is faithful amen if he said it my part only is only to believe only only believe if he doesn't do it today I'll believe that tomorrow if he doesn't do it tomorrow I'll believe it after again if it do the day after I will believe until it comes to [Music] pass it says what happened when two omnipotent meets when God and man come together two omnipotents something's got to shake it says what whatever you'd say with that with that creative power of omnipotent of God knowing that he promised it and he said it in his word and as true as that word said let there be light and there was a light if he said it in his word it's sufficient said that this old colored man with his book they ask him a question but when you say you believe all of that book if God tells you to go through that wall what are you going to do he said I'll go through it said how are you going to go through if there's no hole it said if it's God that to tell me to go through that he himself will make a home for me to go through all that I do is to believe that that the Holy Ghost belong to me that God wants to bring up me to Perfection not a simple emotion not an agitation says when Jesus when he he went into the temple when he opened the word when he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me that he anointed me to share the good Tiding of the Lord but what I'm said he sat down and precious word that proceeded out of his mouth it said in that time the greatest anointing was was coming and dwelling upon him he was not agitated but it was the greatest anointing came and and and and and anointed him my brother my sister God is only asking us as we stand up tonight to believe to believe to only believe that every promise in the book that the promise of the Holy Ghost and often time we we we make the message complicated we complicate the word but the promise of the Holy Ghost the Bible says belongs to you it's Christ coming into your life and Christ is the word and it's it's through the word every every word that preceeded the one that you find difficult to live just say Amen Lord if you said it it means I'm able to to to live that life oh Lord help me Lord I want to be like you Lord I Know This Promise belonged to me and I stopped myself just from being a church member but I want to I want to get access to this body to this body of Christ that was already judged where I'll have the joy that my sins were already forgiven that my iniquity were forgiven that I don't live according to the flesh but according to the word it's not longer me that live but it's Christ that liveth is within me that it's Christ who's giving me the grace for me to overcome all of my Tes it's Christ giving me the grace to overcome every obstacle and to walk in his presence let's bow our head oh I love [Music] Jes [Music] Love how I [Music] love love him because he first [Music] love jus [Music] oh how I love [Music] amen isn't that the beginning of our faith faith that he loves us that it's his good pleasure to give us the kingdom of God I like that tonight because it's not talking about believing a Doctrine or a truth or a fact it's talking about believing a result that something's going to change amen that something's going to be different something that's alive and Faith with life I like like that I like that how do you do it you keep whacking them and whacking them and whacking them and whacking them and whack because you know that it's got to take hold it's got to happen you're going to get a result amen it's not a not a letter without life that's right that'll kill you but the spirit quickening that word that you can make it real that's what life is amen do you believe that Hallelujah I really appreciate that tonight amen Lord be with you my little fella just one minute we'll be with you here in just a little bit

he says well does he understand baptism maybe not but he wants to do a good thing amen you know what I mean he knows if he gets baptized he's got to start obeying his mama he's got to stop talking in class while the teacher talking he's got to be can't go to the principal's office no more and if he thinks baptism will help him do that well praise God you know what I mean we ought to have faith for him don't you ain't that what you want don't you want to live this way live by faith you know don't you want to live for him and and and know him and love him and and and all those things so uh I

life to be is believ in the word of God beli in the word of God making it live not only in my life but Faith may it have effect on the lives of others that you can tell them that they can have things

the ages only believe all things are possible Lord and as our brother emphasized once again that we must believe that the promise is for us that God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and
