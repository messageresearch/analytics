[0:00] you know so
[0:02] you know if you want your leadership to
[0:04] be based on being the best
[0:06] or career
[0:09] you know I guess you can
[0:11] from my perspective knock yourself out
[0:13] but I was kind of looking for something
[0:16] higher than that
[0:18] you know so here I am trying to do this
[0:20] exercise and I've been given these
[0:22] blanks that I can fill in and all I can
[0:24] think of are
[0:25] you know Be not Afraid only believe
[0:30] um lean not unto your own understanding
[0:33] be followers of me
[0:35] thus saith the Lord
[0:38] you know there's a whole book written on
[0:41] daring leadership and all I could think
[0:43] about how it's summed up in one
[0:44] scripture that Jesus said I do nothing
[0:46] unless he shows me first
[0:50] you know Micah 6 8 says he hath shown
[0:53] the o man what is good and what the lord
[0:55] requires of thee
[0:57] but to do justice and to love mercy and
[1:01] to walk humbly before thy God so I was
[1:03] thinking about all of this as I was
[1:05] reading the Psalms this week which
[1:07] honestly is a far more effective book on
[1:09] leadership
[1:11] but I was reading chapter 26 we're going
[1:13] to read that this morning
[1:15] you know David speaks twice
[1:18] about walking in his integrity
[1:21] he says it in verse 1 I have walked in
[1:23] my integrity and again in verse 11 I
[1:25] will walk
[1:27] in mine integrity
[1:30] and you know on the surface
[1:32] it would seem like this is all about
[1:35] David's own values kind of similar to
[1:37] the exercise that we were going through
[1:39] at work but
[1:41] you know just as you know they would try
[1:43] to make leadership about their own
[1:45] values it would almost seem like David
[1:46] is saying look I I have walked in my
[1:49] Integrity I have made this all about my
[1:52] Integrity right
[1:55] but but this isn't about David deciding
[1:57] what his values are like they do in this
[2:00] leadership class
[2:02] if you look at that in verse one it says
[2:04] for I have walked in mine integrity
[2:07] and then there's a semicolon
[2:09] and he's going to Define what walking in
[2:12] his Integrity looks like
[2:14] it says I have trusted also in the Lord
[2:18] therefore
[2:20] as a result
[2:22] I shall not slide
[2:25] or as the song says I shall not be moved
[2:30] why is this because it's not defining
[2:32] his own course
[2:34] he's not defining his own values
[2:38] or his own definition of right or wrong
[2:41] which is a tree of knowledge stuff
[2:45] but his walk of integrity was based on
[2:47] trusting in the Lord
[2:50] and as a result he would not be moved
[2:53] you know what's so interesting about
[2:54] these man-made leadership values that
[2:57] they run us through is people change
[2:59] them
[3:01] you know circumstances change life
[3:03] events change and all of a sudden their
[3:05] values change
[3:06] or more importantly what they thought
[3:08] were their values becomes made known
[3:10] whenever they go through a certain
[3:11] circumstance and it's not really what
[3:13] they thought it was
[3:15] but this kind of leadership is I will
[3:17] not slide I will not move
[3:20] my walk will not change
[3:22] my values don't change when the
[3:24] circumstances change
[3:26] verse 11 it says but as for me I will
[3:29] walk in mine integrity
[3:31] redeem me and be merciful to me
[3:36] David walking in mine Integrity requires
[3:39] a Redemption
[3:41] it requires a purchase
[3:45] it requires someone to be merciful
[3:49] not me defining my values
[3:54] you know what is the basis for his
[3:56] leadership verse two examine Me O Lord
[3:58] and prove me try my Reigns and my heart
[4:02] you know being led
[4:04] involves someone
[4:08] inspecting him
[4:10] trying him
[4:12] proving him
[4:15] testing what's influencing him
[4:18] and what his desires are
[4:22] that's being led by the spirit
[4:24] by that word
[4:27] it says in verse 3 I have walked in thy
[4:29] truth if you remember when Brother David
[4:31] was reading the other day John 17 there
[4:33] was a statement that Jesus made he said
[4:36] Thy word is truth
[4:39] you know this is just David describing
[4:41] how he is Led
[4:45] what walking in his Integrity looks like
[4:49] John 16 13 says how be it when he
[4:52] the spirit of Truth is come
[4:55] he will guide you into all truth
[4:59] for he shall not speak of himself
[5:02] naming his own values
[5:06] but whatsoever he shall hear
[5:08] that shall he speak
[5:11] and he will show you things to come
[5:16] you know it's uh I love how David sums
[5:18] it all up you know as we read this it
[5:21] really doesn't the thing that occurred
[5:23] to me as I was going through this
[5:24] exercise is it doesn't really matter
[5:26] what my values are
[5:28] they're probably getting in his way
[5:31] if you want to go ahead and stand you
[5:34] know though I love how David sets sums
[5:36] it up in verse 7 in verse 12 12.
[5:40] he says my foot standeth in an even
[5:43] place
[5:45] in the congregations will I bless the
[5:47] Lord you know as I read that I thought
[5:49] of some of the other statements that are
[5:51] made in the Psalms and the Proverbs it
[5:53] says lean not unto thy known
[5:54] understanding
[5:56] but in all thy ways acknowledge Him and
[5:59] He shall direct thy paths
[6:02] and then David once said in Psalm 40 you
[6:05] know he brought me up also out of a
[6:06] horrible pit
[6:08] out of a Mirey clay
[6:11] all of my values all the things I used
[6:13] to be led by
[6:16] and set my feet upon a rock
[6:19] and established my Goings
[6:22] my foot is in an even place
[6:27] you know I don't know about you this
[6:28] morning but I'm grateful that I find
[6:30] myself in an even place
[6:33] that my goings have been established
[6:37] I shall not slide
[6:40] I will walk in his truth which is also
[6:43] my integrity
[6:46] and I have no idea how I'm going to
[6:48] write this in this my this values
[6:50] exercise maybe I just put psalm 26.
[6:54] but you know have your goings been
[6:56] established this morning
[6:58] right do you find yourself in an even
[7:00] place you know for me that's our
[7:03] leadership value at least it's my
[7:05] leadership value
[7:07] and uh we'll see if I pass the course or
[7:10] not but let's go ahead and read Psalm 26
[7:13] together
[7:14] Judge Me O Lord for I have walked in
[7:17] mine Integrity I have trusted also in
[7:20] the Lord therefore I shall not slide
[7:23] examine Me O Lord and prove me try my
[7:26] Reigns and my heart for thy loving
[7:29] kindness is before mine eyes and I have
[7:31] walked in thy truth I have not sat with
[7:34] vain persons neither will I go in with
[7:37] dissemblers I have hated the
[7:39] congregation of evildoers and will not
[7:41] sit with the wicked I will wash mine
[7:44] hands and innocency so will I Compass
[7:46] thine altar O Lord that I may publish
[7:49] with the voice of Thanksgiving and tell
[7:51] of all thy wondrous Works Lord I have
[7:54] loved the habitation of thy house and
[7:56] the place where thine honor dwelleth
[7:58] gather not my soul with Sinners nor my
[8:01] life with bloody men in whose hands is
[8:04] mischief and their right hand is full of
[8:06] bribes but as for me I will walk in mine
[8:09] Integrity redeem me and be merciful unto
[8:12] me my foot standeth and even place in
[8:16] the congregations will I bless the Lord
[8:21] amen God bless you may have your seats
[8:24] yeah
[8:27] oh once like a bird and praise and I do
[8:32] it oh no freedom from my sorrow I fell
[8:38] oh and then Jesus came and he said to me
[8:43] oh and glory to God he set me oh and he
[8:51] set me free as he says oh and he broke

[38:02] to be good for you Hallelujah God bless
[38:05] you amen
[38:07] thank you musicians God bless you this
[38:10] morning we have maybe a little different
[38:13] uh
[38:14] service than
[38:16] normal today but we just trust that
[38:19] through it all it would be a blessing I
[38:22] I certainly I had to say that I sat in
[38:26] my office just having a good time about
[38:31] brother Mike's a little exhortation this
[38:34] morning and I thought if he put the
[38:37] primary values that you don't lead your
[38:40] life and I just thought him writing Holy
[38:43] Spirit
[38:44] bible message of the hour Mike would be
[38:48] praying for employment this morning
[38:51] but but we know the god that watches
[38:54] over us don't we he controls all things
[38:57] you know I remember the first time I
[39:00] ever got fired
[39:03] you know that was really a shock to me
[39:05] and the guy said we don't really need
[39:08] you more anymore and I thought you know
[39:12] what I I probably I fired a few people
[39:14] in my time and I guess I need to
[39:19] get what I let uh you know reap what I
[39:22] sow I told one guy he looked better
[39:24] going than he did coming
[39:27] and
[39:29] so this guy let me know and that's
[39:31] pretty discouraged you know it was more
[39:33] my ego that was hurting anything you
[39:36] know I was I was talented and I knew
[39:39] that I knew electrical work
[39:42] and I finally got done I thought well
[39:44] Lord you know I was looking for a job
[39:46] when I found this one
[39:48] and I know you'll take care of me and
[39:50] isn't that really what it all falls back
[39:53] into is that if God don't watch the city
[39:56] The Watchman watches me and nothing can
[39:59] pluck you out of the poem of God's hands
[40:02] to answer a few questions this morning
[40:05] that I've already got 10 answers for
[40:08] questions about what are all those
[40:11] ditches doing out there well that's all
[40:15] part of the foundation of the church
[40:18] building and that is what they call a
[40:22] post-tensions lab
[40:25] and what happens with all those niches
[40:28] there's cables that run from one end of
[40:31] the ditch to the other
[40:33] they run
[40:35] as you notice they crisscross and if you
[40:38] really look at it it looks like a big
[40:40] waffle
[40:42] and that's why they call it a waffle
[40:44] slab or a post-tension slab and what
[40:48] happens is they fill all those ditches
[40:51] with concrete and then they fill the top
[40:54] smooth
[40:55] and then those cables they put a machine
[40:58] on those cables and they put tension
[41:02] on those cables so it pulls the whole
[41:06] slab together
[41:08] and then they let it cure for a while
[41:11] and they come again and they
[41:15] put tension on it again or what we refer
[41:19] as stress so we have pre-stressed and
[41:22] post stress and at the end of it all
[41:25] those cables pull that slab together and
[41:29] then now that slab moves with the ground
[41:33] so it's not put on Piers
[41:36] which is a different form of slab but
[41:39] because the slab's so big they decided
[41:43] to make it stiffer so it's not real hard
[41:46] concrete it's real stiff and it moves as
[41:50] one slab and then the little
[41:53] Place between the two buildings that's
[41:57] poured absolutely separate
[41:59] and then that moves
[42:02] on its own between two slabs so I don't
[42:05] know if you know it but the very ground
[42:07] that you're sitting on this morning is
[42:09] moving underneath you amen and but
[42:15] that's that's what's going on out there
[42:19] and I hope my drone flyer can get up and
[42:23] take some pictures of it and post it up
[42:26] on the internet for you and if you'll
[42:28] pray for the weather and pray for the
[42:31] people that are pouring the concrete
[42:33] because it's real important that they do
[42:36] a good job I it's very difficult to
[42:40] control it you have to put Trust
[42:43] in somebody to do it and we've got the
[42:47] best price we could and to save us some
[42:50] money and so
[42:54] by next Sunday morning we are praying by
[42:57] the grace of God that that'll be poured
[43:01] so when you come back you'll see a slab
[43:04] and if the Lord continues to bless us we
[43:07] trust by the end of April that it'll all
[43:10] be framed up the walls will all be on it
[43:13] and the roof will be on it and that's
[43:15] going to take some help from some of the
[43:18] Brethren and we just trust that uh
[43:22] they will
[43:24] um it'll be our
[43:27] uh the grace of mercy of God that we
[43:30] just get that part of it done and so
[43:33] once we have the roof on it and it
[43:34] framed up
[43:35] then we'll start bricking it and then
[43:38] the people we can start putting the
[43:39] electrical in and and uh
[43:44] air conditioning the Plumbing's already
[43:46] in that's the white pipes you see
[43:49] sitting up so if you look at it that one
[43:52] group of white pipes on the far side
[43:55] where you park
[43:57] that's the men's bathroom this little
[44:00] group of pipes right up here is the
[44:03] woman's bathroom
[44:05] there's another group of pipes back in
[44:08] this corner that's the bathroom in my
[44:10] office and then there's a little hall
[44:13] bath there that we use and then the
[44:16] baptismal so again the church layout is
[44:20] very similar to this it's just wider on
[44:24] each side and and then our baptistry
[44:28] will be in the same place we're trying
[44:30] to make it as familiar as we can of our
[44:35] transition and we just trust it'll be
[44:38] better another thing we'd like to
[44:42] uh mention to you this morning
[44:45] if you notice there's a little teeny Pew
[44:48] that sits in the foyer
[44:51] the reason that peel is there is that is
[44:54] the uh
[44:58] um I don't know what do you call example
[45:00] or prototype or a sample of what the
[45:06] pews are going to be
[45:09] so I don't know if you've had an
[45:10] opportunity to sit on it or not we're
[45:14] getting the extra padding we're getting
[45:16] the Lombard support so if you get a
[45:19] chance just sit in that take turns
[45:22] sitting at it see how you like it and so
[45:25] the cost that put the pews in the church
[45:30] is about seventy thousand dollars uh
[45:33] we're working on that because the price
[45:36] of lumber has come down so we're going
[45:38] to try to negotiate the best price that
[45:41] we can on the on the pews but so we'll
[45:45] have seating for about
[45:47] 420 if we get all the pews and that's
[45:52] allowing three feet between hpu so
[45:57] that's plenty of room I mean you'll
[45:59] you'll love the room
[46:01] um you this isn't as crowd as it used to
[46:04] be
[46:05] you know we used to we had four more
[46:08] pews in this room alone before before we
[46:12] opened up the Overflow so
[46:14] um anyway so what we want to do is make
[46:17] you aware of somebody said they did the
[46:20] math for me and they said well that's
[46:22] comes out to about
[46:24] uh 200 dollars a seat
[46:28] and I thought well
[46:30] I didn't know I didn't check the math
[46:32] but so just just so you know that you're
[46:38] at least worth 200 bucks
[46:41] okay so that that's the space of each
[46:45] Pew so anyway what we're going to do is
[46:47] we're just going to open up a
[46:50] uh
[46:51] some little type of I think we're just
[46:54] going to take that white bucket out
[46:56] there and and we're just going to open
[46:58] up the ability for those that want to
[47:01] give Beyond and above what they're
[47:05] giving now
[47:06] so it doesn't help us if you just change
[47:10] your offering to pews or whatever that
[47:13] you give then we're still in the same
[47:16] boat
[47:17] but if you want to give just a few
[47:20] dollars extra ear Mark for pews then
[47:25] we'll just hope that we can kind of get
[47:26] that price down by the time we need them
[47:29] so uh we we wanted to Target certain
[47:33] things that we could do and uh so this
[47:37] is one of the things that
[47:39] we can Target altogether is say well I'm
[47:43] going to give ten dollars towards the
[47:44] pews so here's my building fund money
[47:47] here's my offering money here's this and
[47:50] then uh and this is for that and so you
[47:55] know I I don't talk to you a lot about
[47:56] money but I we the trustees and us had a
[48:00] meeting the other day and we discussed
[48:02] it and they thought it would be a good
[48:04] thing that the people would like to know
[48:06] and it's something that they could
[48:08] participate in so we're we're gratefully
[48:11] wonderful
[48:14] uh for that this morning and uh we just
[48:19] trust that the Lord will be our portion
[48:22] this morning so this morning we're going
[48:25] to
[48:27] start uh just a little uh if we could
[48:32] call it a Bible study or just going
[48:36] through the scriptures and there's
[48:37] there's there's two uh purposes that
[48:41] this is on my heart to to approach it
[48:45] the way that I'm approaching it
[48:47] and the reason for it is is I want you
[48:51] to
[48:53] um
[48:54] fall in love with your Bibles
[48:57] the Bible is wonderful reading it it's a
[49:02] joy and it's really something that
[49:07] you should
[49:10] participate in every day of your life
[49:13] and then learn to study the scriptures
[49:17] it's scriptural to study the scriptures
[49:21] you know what I mean Paul told Timothy
[49:24] study the scriptures to show yourself
[49:27] approved
[49:29] our messenger told us we should read our
[49:31] Bible and pray every day if you want to
[49:35] be spiritual and so the the
[49:39] Bible's full of Wonders
[49:42] uh
[49:43] is full of History
[49:46] uh it it's it's uh it is the summon
[49:51] substance of everything that we are
[49:55] is the scriptures now there was
[49:58] Revelation hid in this Bible that no man
[50:02] could see
[50:04] until God sent a messenger to open up
[50:09] those things which were hid in the Bible
[50:12] he himself thought that maybe these
[50:16] things would be something outside of the
[50:18] scriptures and he was honest about that
[50:22] he said I I was looking that it would be
[50:24] maybe something but then he came back to
[50:27] realize that it wasn't outside of the
[50:30] scriptures
[50:31] it was kid in the scripture but no man
[50:35] could see it
[50:37] a very similar if I could say it this
[50:40] way to the way that the Jews were
[50:43] blinded to who the Messiah was every
[50:47] scripture
[50:49] pertaining to the Lord Jesus was being
[50:52] fulfilled right before their eyes
[50:55] and he even challenged him he said
[50:59] search the scriptures
[51:03] go search the scriptures
[51:05] because in them you think you have
[51:08] eternal life
[51:09] but they are which that testify of me
[51:14] so he's actually tell him here I am in
[51:17] the scriptures
[51:18] and you can't even see it look that
[51:24] wasn't
[51:25] because God disliked them I could say in
[51:29] any way but really he blinded his eyes
[51:32] for you
[51:34] he didn't lose a one
[51:36] can ended up giving him robes
[51:39] white robes that he'll call the
[51:42] remainder of his elected from those
[51:45] people
[51:46] and he made a way for you so everything
[51:50] is contained within the Bible the
[51:53] message that is brought to us in this
[51:56] day is not unscriptural
[52:00] it's it's scripture upon scripture but
[52:04] it's knitted together if I could say
[52:07] that fitted and joined together
[52:10] by the Holy Spirit
[52:13] so that we could get the true picture of
[52:17] God's plan
[52:19] it never was God's plan to have 500
[52:24] different denominations
[52:26] to have the people ruled over by the
[52:30] ministry
[52:31] for them to be taught one certain line
[52:35] of thought
[52:36] and to put their trust in
[52:40] a group of people that they're a member
[52:43] with
[52:46] all the the prophet brought back to us
[52:50] is he brought back the same Jesus he
[52:55] brought back Jesus Christ the same
[52:57] yesterday today and forever and he
[53:00] wanted every believer to know that if
[53:03] you have a personal
[53:06] relationship with him
[53:08] that his Spirit In You is the baptism of
[53:15] the Holy Spirit
[53:16] that's what it means to be borned again
[53:20] to be born again is to know Jesus Christ
[53:24] personally
[53:26] and what that changes of a birth is your
[53:31] birth from one nature to another nature
[53:35] your nature changes your heart's desires
[53:39] change there's a change in you that
[53:42] change can happen without sensation
[53:47] but it's still a change
[53:49] your affections change
[53:51] and you you have a new
[53:56] uh leader the leadership changes in your
[54:01] life it's not by affections it's not by
[54:04] emotions it's not by by uh any other
[54:09] thing but what leads you and moves you
[54:12] is his Spirit you're led by the spirit
[54:16] that you meant and you know whom it is
[54:19] that's leading you the holy spirit is
[54:23] not a third person
[54:26] it's not a spirit separate than God it's
[54:30] not the spirit separate from Jesus it's
[54:34] the spirit that was in Jesus Christ the
[54:39] nature and the spirit that was on him
[54:43] coming into you
[54:46] that that same Spirit would Quicken your
[54:51] mortal body and raise you if the same
[54:54] spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in
[54:57] you it will also Quicken your mortal
[55:00] body
[55:01] and I know that some people try to draw
[55:04] a picture sometimes that meet that I
[55:08] personally don't believe in shouting or
[55:10] praising or dancing well you know all I
[55:14] I love it
[55:16] okay I just don't like it when it's
[55:18] motivated by music
[55:22] you know what I mean
[55:24] worship is the recognition of what God
[55:30] has done for you and praising them for
[55:33] it
[55:35] you know you know what I mean and I've
[55:37] been healed a time or two and shouted
[55:39] because of it I've seen my life like
[55:43] just God actually deliver me out of
[55:46] circumstances that were absolutely there
[55:51] was no way at all except for it to be
[55:55] the miraculous hand of God
[55:57] I told you the time that Leslie and I
[56:00] were driving in the Volkswagen bus in
[56:03] Montana and
[56:05] we came up and we hit an ice patch and
[56:09] we started this slide and you know what
[56:11] a Volkswagen buses are remember the old
[56:13] Veep man it was got some hippies in here
[56:17] and the bus went straight down on the
[56:20] front and you sat right there
[56:23] and uh I think the engine was right in
[56:26] the middle there and you sat right on
[56:28] the front of the in fact this is where
[56:31] the steering wheel and this was the
[56:33] front of the car and we act the guard
[56:35] rail disappeared
[56:37] and alls we could see was the the river
[56:40] below us
[56:42] Leslie went to the floor of the car she
[56:46] just fell down on the floorboard I I
[56:49] couldn't do that I was driving I threw
[56:50] my hands up and said Jesus help me
[56:53] Jesus helped me
[56:55] we came to
[56:58] I would say it that way around the
[57:01] corner
[57:02] on the side of the road
[57:05] and at least none other
[57:08] Eric and I I I just remember just
[57:12] shouting and thanking the lord now
[57:14] forgive me I I wasn't a Christian very
[57:17] long and all I did is turn to Leslie and
[57:21] said that was neat uh
[57:25] but it was him I'm telling you you know
[57:29] it was him in my life
[57:32] doing something for me and I had
[57:36] something to praise him about
[57:42] it was it was marvelous
[57:45] and
[57:46] and uh
[57:48] uh I I remember we were
[57:52] uh brother Ron Peterson and I uh were
[57:57] long friends we listened to choosing of
[57:59] the Bride together
[58:00] as you know brother Ron was in at the
[58:04] church we were going to uh back in the
[58:07] hippie movement there I guess they made
[58:10] a movie about the Jesus people movement
[58:12] but forget what that thing is that
[58:15] really wasn't the way it was I ain't
[58:17] seen it but I knew all those people in
[58:20] those days but so we kind of come in the
[58:23] message together and we were back out in
[58:25] Flagstaff Arizona and we are driving
[58:29] them a little I think some little pickup
[58:32] truck or a Volkswagen bug or whatever it
[58:35] was
[58:35] and we got to thinking about
[58:37] predestination
[58:40] and Malachi 4 5 and how we're
[58:42] predestinated
[58:44] and I'm telling you we got so excited
[58:47] that I remember pulling the car on the
[58:51] side of the road and jumping out and
[58:53] starting to run around the car Ron got
[58:55] its height he jumped out started to run
[58:58] around the car and people thought that
[58:59] he's chasing me and I was running around
[59:02] the car while then pretty soon it looked
[59:04] like I was chasing him and and around
[59:06] and around that car we went just a
[59:09] shouting and and having a jubilee but we
[59:12] had something to shout about
[59:15] in on the prophet of God says he says
[59:18] that you know he doesn't want praise to
[59:22] stop when the Music Stops
[59:25] you know what I mean and and shouting
[59:28] and jumping and praising that's all fine
[59:30] but you know it's it's not only for
[59:33] young people
[59:35] you know what I mean it's for people
[59:38] that have something that he did for him
[59:42] and it's such a marvelous thing that
[59:46] he's done
[59:50] Brother Paul's wife when God delivered
[59:52] her of that cancer in her jaw and
[59:55] everything if she got up here and
[59:58] started shouting and dancing I know why
[1:00:00] she was shouting and dancing it wasn't a
[1:00:03] song that brought it on it was a it
[1:00:07] wasn't a music it wasn't an atmosphere
[1:00:10] it wasn't the next thing that's to be
[1:00:14] anticipated you know read Corinthians
[1:00:17] 12.
[1:00:18] you know even tongues Paul said if
[1:00:21] you're going to speak in tongues let one
[1:00:24] or two speak in tongues not more than
[1:00:27] three
[1:00:29] it's what he said I didn't make this up
[1:00:33] you understand but it has a lot to do
[1:00:36] with leadership but anyway so uh
[1:00:40] he uh he laid that out there and then he
[1:00:43] said if in it but I would rather you
[1:00:45] prophesy
[1:00:47] and we know what that means that means
[1:00:49] because the prophet is a new testament
[1:00:51] preacher he said I'd rather that you
[1:00:53] tell of the scriptures and tell what
[1:00:57] what's edifying to the body that that
[1:01:00] they might grow in Christ in other words
[1:01:02] prophesying has to be the word of the
[1:01:04] Lord do you understand that
[1:01:06] it's what the Lord said and he said he
[1:01:09] said but if any man think himself to be
[1:01:12] a prophet
[1:01:13] let him acknowledge that the things that
[1:01:16] I speak unto you are of the Lord
[1:01:21] so you can't break somebody just
[1:01:24] preached about that you can't break
[1:01:26] God's pattern
[1:01:27] he's got a a great pattern and you stay
[1:01:32] with it and and you know brother Matthew
[1:01:34] shared a wonderful story
[1:01:37] with men and I and it really moved my
[1:01:41] heart but he said that the prophet of
[1:01:42] God had a prayer line
[1:01:44] and I believe in the prayer line as you
[1:01:47] know they would I think they would come
[1:01:49] from the right this way
[1:01:51] to him and he said the lady came up
[1:01:55] and he said she just would keep dancing
[1:01:58] and and praising God hallelujah and she
[1:02:02] was felt the spirit of the Lord and he
[1:02:06] said he said sister would you be still
[1:02:12] that I can talk to you
[1:02:18] and she said she just couldn't be still
[1:02:22] because she wasn't taught right
[1:02:25] Matthew what tapes that him
[1:02:30] do you remember
[1:02:36] I'll give you the tapes
[1:02:41] just read it to us would you
[1:02:44] okay so go ahead and go ahead stand up
[1:02:47] and read that portion to it
[1:02:49] yeah you can go give him a mic he don't
[1:02:51] need one but
[1:02:53] I'm sorry Matthew that sounded wrong
[1:03:01] I'll use that okay
[1:03:04] lo and behold here I am I was going to
[1:03:07] read this at the end of my
[1:03:08] sermon on Wednesday so I'll just read it
[1:03:11] and that's all I will do
[1:03:14] this is where I think Pentecost failed
[1:03:17] he says I believe
[1:03:19] it with all my heart and I think that's
[1:03:21] where the church has failed I think
[1:03:23] we've failed to bring love Among Us
[1:03:25] and to bring Fellowship among the groups
[1:03:27] and things like that and we've tried to
[1:03:29] push ourselves into something that God
[1:03:31] has not ordained and I believe that if
[1:03:33] we would just walk back down the line to
[1:03:36] God and say God here I stand nothing at
[1:03:39] all I have to offer you but my life but
[1:03:41] God I pray that you'll let me live that
[1:03:44] that I'll find Grace in your sight now
[1:03:46] you're coming along getting pretty close
[1:03:48] to the kingdom that's right then you'll
[1:03:49] see a real healing meeting when you come
[1:03:52] up to the altar don't come glory to God
[1:03:55] I receive the Holy Ghost 40 years ago
[1:03:57] praise God hallelujah that don't do no
[1:03:59] good
[1:04:00] Satan don't care how much you say that
[1:04:02] the thing of it is walk up with a true
[1:04:05] Assurance in your heart that you know
[1:04:07] where you're standing I was amazed here
[1:04:10] not long ago at a little woman come down
[1:04:12] to the platform there was two of them
[1:04:14] together and one of them come through
[1:04:16] and I said how do you do sister now
[1:04:18] remember I believe in all spiritual
[1:04:21] demonstrations yes sir I have received
[1:04:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I know
[1:04:25] what I speak of
[1:04:27] and they come down the line the little
[1:04:29] lady come up to the prayer line and she
[1:04:31] started dancing around real fast and I
[1:04:33] said would you stand still just a minute
[1:04:36] so I could speak to you she couldn't do
[1:04:38] it and she just kept dancing around well
[1:04:40] I thought I'll just try the next one and
[1:04:42] I got the next one to come down I tried
[1:04:44] to take a hold of her hand and I said
[1:04:46] I'd like to talk to you just a little
[1:04:48] bit sister and then she started dancing
[1:04:50] around I said oh I love that it's
[1:04:52] beautiful and I know Miriam danced in
[1:04:54] the spirit I believe in it yes sir but
[1:04:57] there's times for all things you see and
[1:05:00] when you're coming up here comes soberly
[1:05:02] in the presence of God come with a
[1:05:05] perfect assured heart that God's going
[1:05:08] to keep his word and melt yourself down
[1:05:10] by the Holy Spirit and the little lady I
[1:05:13] didn't know what happened and and one of
[1:05:16] them I'm sure had cancer and she's
[1:05:17] probably dead tonight
[1:05:19] but she just wouldn't stand still
[1:05:23] you couldn't get nowhere see because the
[1:05:26] woman had been taught wrong a wonderful
[1:05:28] person no doubt and there stood a little
[1:05:30] woman now that was a Pentecostal woman
[1:05:32] and here stood a little woman a a formal
[1:05:35] denomination standing back there with a
[1:05:37] little girl and she wasn't making a move
[1:05:38] at all and she had her prayer card and
[1:05:41] she was just standing there waiting
[1:05:42] after a while they give time for her to
[1:05:45] come the little lady walked up and a
[1:05:48] little girl walked up there and took a
[1:05:49] hold of my hand she said looky here
[1:05:52] mother began to raise her leg and her
[1:05:54] mother began to cry wilted down she said
[1:05:56] brother Branham I knew it would happen I
[1:05:58] just knew it would happen she said I
[1:06:00] believed with all of my heart I said
[1:06:01] what was wrong with the child she said
[1:06:03] she was paralyzed in both legs see there
[1:06:06] it was there you are see she come the
[1:06:09] appropriate way she come God fearing God
[1:06:11] believing walking up there reverent
[1:06:13] before God believe in his promise where
[1:06:15] a real saintly woman just mistalk come
[1:06:17] across the platform I couldn't even pray
[1:06:19] for her and the woman thought she was in
[1:06:21] the spirit she was in the flesh but of
[1:06:24] course she was there she she showed what
[1:06:27] was in the spirit the fruits what proved
[1:06:29] it when you come to God you must come
[1:06:32] soberly sanely believing asking then if
[1:06:36] God heals you then raise your hands and
[1:06:39] give them praise that's right that
[1:06:41] little woman walked down there and
[1:06:42] hugged that girl the father come running
[1:06:44] out of the audience and said brother
[1:06:45] Branham I've been a sinner for years and
[1:06:47] my wife's a Christian can I find Jesus
[1:06:49] right now I said yes my brother just
[1:06:51] kneel right here that's right see that's
[1:06:54] the way we want the meeting isn't that
[1:06:55] right something that same
[1:06:58] solid and his sound that's the kind of
[1:07:00] church we want
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:10] that's the way I believe it
[1:07:13] that's what I've been trying to teach
[1:07:17] there's a way to approach
[1:07:19] you understand
[1:07:21] I'm not critical
[1:07:23] but it's because they're not taught
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:27] you don't fall out
[1:07:31] it don't do nothing for you
[1:07:35] but you come knowing
[1:07:38] if you go through a prayer line and you
[1:07:40] want to be healed you walk up there
[1:07:42] knowing you're going to be healed and
[1:07:44] when God heals you you raise your hands
[1:07:47] and you praise them
[1:07:50] if you want to be delivered and you come
[1:07:52] and you receive but you walk up soberly
[1:07:56] sanely and you give God the glory and
[1:08:01] don't
[1:08:03] take a film of yourself right and send
[1:08:06] it out on the internet
[1:08:09] for everybody to see
[1:08:12] that you have an experience that's
[1:08:14] Tick-Tock Christianity
[1:08:17] and if it's banned in the United States
[1:08:19] it ought to be banned in the Church of
[1:08:21] the Living God
[1:08:23] anyway I hope I don't sound mean
[1:08:26] but let's take our Bibles this morning
[1:08:30] and let's begin a little lesson this
[1:08:33] morning out of the book oh all right
[1:08:36] we're going to stand all right so that's
[1:08:39] good we'll read the first verse of the
[1:08:43] book of Ezra and then you can be seated
[1:08:46] book of Ezra I thought you said brother
[1:08:50] McGarry I thought you said Nehemiah yes
[1:08:53] but uh I don't want you to stand for
[1:08:56] that
[1:08:57] so let's just sit here and say in the
[1:09:00] first verse of the book of Ezra
[1:09:06] now in the first year of Cyrus King of
[1:09:10] Persia
[1:09:11] that the word of the Lord by the mouth
[1:09:14] of Jeremiah might be fulfilled
[1:09:18] the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus
[1:09:21] King of Persia and made him to Proclaim
[1:09:24] throughout all of his kingdom and put it
[1:09:29] also in writing saying God bless you may
[1:09:33] be seated
[1:09:36] today we're going to have a little
[1:09:39] Biblical history Lesson by a person that
[1:09:44] loves history but is a terrible history
[1:09:48] teacher
[1:09:49] and so what
[1:09:52] I would like to start with this morning
[1:09:54] if the brothers could put up on the
[1:09:57] board I hope it comes out pretty good at
[1:10:01] uh
[1:10:04] I I have it on mine
[1:10:06] let me see if we can get it up there for
[1:10:09] you
[1:10:10] amen so this is uh it oh this is the
[1:10:16] Assyrian Kingdom it that's not the one
[1:10:19] that I have here but uh
[1:10:22] but I'll go ahead and use this one uh
[1:10:26] the one I have is just a little
[1:10:29] different but it shows the reason I have
[1:10:33] this one but I want to point you out
[1:10:37] if you can hear me
[1:10:39] this is the land this is the city that
[1:10:45] jarrah that Nehemiah was in at the time
[1:10:50] of his writing I wanted to get the other
[1:10:53] map up but right here
[1:10:56] on this bottom place is the city of UR
[1:11:01] right here
[1:11:03] okay so how many know what What er is
[1:11:09] okay ER is not Babylon
[1:11:13] ER is where Abraham was
[1:11:17] okay when God told him to get out of uh
[1:11:22] okay there's a map of it right here very
[1:11:24] good thank you
[1:11:26] this is Elam
[1:11:28] this is the place where Abraham was and
[1:11:32] this was ER
[1:11:33] right here the city of UR and you see
[1:11:36] Babylon up there a little farther
[1:11:39] now we know that Abraham you can go back
[1:11:43] to the original map that was good so we
[1:11:46] know that Abraham
[1:11:49] traveled from ER
[1:11:52] over into what today is known as
[1:11:57] Jerusalem
[1:11:59] so we're go we're going to understand
[1:12:02] the Jewish history
[1:12:04] in all this so Abraham went over to
[1:12:08] Jerusalem
[1:12:10] and
[1:12:12] there in Jerusalem he offered up Isaac
[1:12:16] how many remember that story correct and
[1:12:19] that spot where he after offered up
[1:12:22] Isaac
[1:12:24] was Mount Mira which today is known as
[1:12:28] the Temple mount
[1:12:31] that's where they built the temple is in
[1:12:34] that spot where he offered today that
[1:12:37] spot is uh
[1:12:40] the president of a
[1:12:43] Mohamed and mosque
[1:12:45] and uh that's part of our history so
[1:12:49] we're not going to talk about the Jews
[1:12:51] so much today because what happened to
[1:12:54] the Jews during this time is that they
[1:12:58] went over into uh
[1:13:05] I'm being lost here
[1:13:08] um
[1:13:11] well anyway
[1:13:13] um just the very first one you had it's
[1:13:15] the one I can yeah that's that one this
[1:13:17] one here
[1:13:20] okay all right that's great so we know
[1:13:24] that they went over right to Israel and
[1:13:28] you you can look at this map and you can
[1:13:32] see where uh you can see where Jerusalem
[1:13:36] is and you can see it on the map on that
[1:13:39] side or this side you see Jerusalem
[1:13:42] Samaria Tyra at and uh and then down off
[1:13:47] of Jerusalem over here is if you went
[1:13:51] down to I guess here it's called
[1:13:53] Ash
[1:13:55] kalon right in there well that's where
[1:13:58] about Tel Aviv is today
[1:14:00] and so we know that the Jews went there
[1:14:04] a Great Famine came on the land and the
[1:14:09] Jews all ended up in Egypt
[1:14:12] we understand that story right so
[1:14:15] they're all in Egypt and so they're
[1:14:18] there for 400 years but what's happening
[1:14:21] to the rest of the world
[1:14:24] is that the rest of the world the
[1:14:27] Assyrians are now taking over the world
[1:14:32] and forming an Assyrian
[1:14:36] Empire
[1:14:37] now remember when you talk about Old
[1:14:41] Testament
[1:14:43] Old Testament dates work backwards
[1:14:46] New Testament dates work upward so if
[1:14:50] from if you went from a thousand
[1:14:53] BC and you win a hundred years the next
[1:14:57] year wouldn't be a thousand one hundred
[1:15:01] it would be yeah you know 900 and so
[1:15:06] everything is is going so the Assyrian
[1:15:10] Empire had ruled and you so you see the
[1:15:15] area of the Assyrian Empire
[1:15:17] and so that was the area that the
[1:15:21] Assyrians Empire was
[1:15:23] the Assyrians were a group of people and
[1:15:27] the Babylonians were a group of people
[1:15:31] one was given more to fighting
[1:15:34] the Babylonians were given more to
[1:15:37] intellect and and culture and things
[1:15:41] like that so really what happened there
[1:15:44] was an internal
[1:15:46] uh Civil War you might say and the
[1:15:52] Babylonian Kingdom came into existence
[1:15:57] and Nebuchadnezzar took over it so the
[1:16:00] Babel the Syrian Empire almost the same
[1:16:04] exact
[1:16:05] footprint became the Babylonian
[1:16:09] Empire
[1:16:10] and we know what happened the Jews
[1:16:13] returned back
[1:16:16] Israel to Palestine they began to build
[1:16:21] their City
[1:16:22] when Nebuchadnezzar took over the
[1:16:25] Assyrian Empire he went over and sacked
[1:16:29] you know what Sac means right
[1:16:32] he he bagged up everything like a
[1:16:35] grocery sack he'll he went over there
[1:16:37] and took all the riches and all the
[1:16:40] temple Goods all the things and he
[1:16:43] brought him over to to his country
[1:16:47] at which now it changed from Assyria to
[1:16:52] the Babylonian Empire
[1:16:54] basically the same land mass
[1:16:57] so you got the picture right so the
[1:17:01] Assyrian Empire became the Babylonian
[1:17:04] Empire
[1:17:05] Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon
[1:17:09] he went over to Israel and he sacked
[1:17:14] Israel he took all the children he
[1:17:16] brought the Jews into captivity he
[1:17:19] brought all the goods he took the young
[1:17:22] men as you know Shadrach Meshach and
[1:17:25] Abednego Daniel and so he basically took
[1:17:29] Jerusalem
[1:17:31] and the inhabitants of Israel the
[1:17:35] descendants of Abraham and destroyed
[1:17:39] that land took it under his control and
[1:17:42] brought the all the children of Israel
[1:17:45] that were of any value to his kingdom he
[1:17:49] brought him back to Babylon
[1:17:51] so you had the Babylonian Kingdom now
[1:17:55] instead of the Assyrian Kingdom so it
[1:17:59] was the same Kingdom so what we're what
[1:18:02] we're speaking on this morning if we
[1:18:04] could say it in that way is we're
[1:18:07] talking about the path to Restoration
[1:18:12] now we want you to take this history
[1:18:16] and apply it to yourself the path to
[1:18:19] Restoration the building of your walls
[1:18:23] and Gates
[1:18:25] and so we want to get put the setting
[1:18:28] there so the setting is now if you go to
[1:18:34] what we have on on map two I think you
[1:18:37] guys found that one is that the same one
[1:18:40] I have
[1:18:42] uh no I guess they weren't able to find
[1:18:45] the same one I had
[1:18:48] um
[1:18:49] it's the one if you're looking on it's
[1:18:52] the one that shows uh
[1:18:55] uh
[1:18:57] the conquest of the Persian Kingdom
[1:19:02] um okay on the image I just got my
[1:19:06] pictures off the internet but I'll use
[1:19:09] whatever map they put up there the best
[1:19:12] way I can okay so in
[1:19:17] what was in the beginning uh and I I
[1:19:21] don't know if you can I don't know if
[1:19:24] you could see this or not
[1:19:26] but uh
[1:19:28] uh so you see down here
[1:19:32] uh you see this this is the where
[1:19:34] Nehemiah is at the time of his book
[1:19:36] right here's the Persian Gulf right over
[1:19:39] here is a little area
[1:19:42] that's called
[1:19:45] that's called Persia it could and that's
[1:19:48] 50 55
[1:19:53] 9 BC
[1:19:55] the country of Persia
[1:19:58] begins to start
[1:20:00] its Conquest
[1:20:02] and that King is the king of Syria
[1:20:09] and his name Cyrus the King of Persia so
[1:20:13] Cyrus conquers
[1:20:15] all of the land surrounding Babylonian
[1:20:20] Kingdom
[1:20:22] that that's all of the land that you see
[1:20:25] there going up and I don't know if you
[1:20:30] notice at the top you see what city that
[1:20:32] is up at top
[1:20:34] can anybody read that
[1:20:36] Nineveh
[1:20:39] how many knows where Nineveh comes in in
[1:20:41] the Bible
[1:20:43] that's the city that Jonah
[1:20:47] went to speak against the city of
[1:20:50] Nineveh so if you go back to our map to
[1:20:53] the full map there you see how he came
[1:20:56] back all the way down from Nineveh where
[1:21:00] he he talked about judgment and he came
[1:21:04] all the way down way over here to the
[1:21:08] Mediterranean Sea just way down here to
[1:21:11] the bottom
[1:21:12] is where he fled
[1:21:15] to get on a boat
[1:21:17] right where it says Judea so you don't
[1:21:20] think he was running from the presence
[1:21:22] of the Lord
[1:21:23] and so we know that we know the story
[1:21:26] how that key uh that he got taken by the
[1:21:31] great fish and specially prepared fish
[1:21:34] came up on the ground and eventually
[1:21:36] Nineveh repented so if we go there then
[1:21:40] we see that then
[1:21:43] uh in in
[1:21:47] in 59 in 539
[1:21:52] uh
[1:21:54] uh Cyrus conquered Babylon
[1:21:58] and so now he had conquered Babylon so
[1:22:02] he conquered all of all of the land
[1:22:05] around Babylon and then he conquered
[1:22:09] Babylon and then and he conquered by
[1:22:14] 1547 he had went all the way up and
[1:22:17] conquered Lydia which we would know
[1:22:20] today as turkey
[1:22:24] all right so then later on his son
[1:22:26] conquered Egypt and and that whole land
[1:22:31] all about there was now known as the
[1:22:35] Persian Empire
[1:22:38] and our setting is in the Persian Empire
[1:22:40] and I I hope we have this one uh um and
[1:22:46] I guess I could put these someplace else
[1:22:47] and then if we would go to map three
[1:22:50] it's an overlay of the today's Persian
[1:22:54] Empire
[1:23:01] did we
[1:23:04] foreign
[1:23:05] okay that's the one I wanted to show you
[1:23:08] first so let's go back no I just want
[1:23:11] you to understand this because there's a
[1:23:13] reason I want to you understand that is
[1:23:16] because all this is going on and God's
[1:23:18] still moving
[1:23:19] he's still got a plan he still plays
[1:23:23] plan is still coming to pass
[1:23:25] okay with all this the Jews there there
[1:23:29] where they're at they've been away in
[1:23:30] captivity but all this Empire and thing
[1:23:34] is going on this is all going on with
[1:23:37] the sons of Ishmael
[1:23:38] so this this was see Persia here
[1:23:42] that's that's where
[1:23:45] uh Cyrus was
[1:23:47] King of Persia then he came up here and
[1:23:49] he conquered all media
[1:23:52] and and conquered by by 55 BC then he
[1:23:57] went over and conquered Babylon which is
[1:24:00] all that area there he went up and
[1:24:03] conquered Lydia up there which is part
[1:24:06] of turkey and his son came down here and
[1:24:09] conquered Egypt so that was the kingdom
[1:24:12] of Persia at that time it's the kingdom
[1:24:17] of Persia
[1:24:19] that
[1:24:20] uh
[1:24:22] that Nehemiah was in
[1:24:25] when the Story begins and so we want to
[1:24:29] do one more map if they could uh
[1:24:33] find that one and it was would be map
[1:24:36] three of the ones that we had at and
[1:24:40] that is the present day
[1:24:43] area this is the present day map
[1:24:49] and is this the overlay of the Persian
[1:24:51] Empire
[1:24:53] it would be the area of the Persian
[1:24:55] Empire
[1:24:57] it looks like this
[1:24:59] the Persian Empire
[1:25:02] okay so you can uh
[1:25:06] well but I guess I just can tell you
[1:25:09] you see where Iraq is
[1:25:12] okay Iraq right there
[1:25:15] to Syria Lebanon Israel Jordan Turkey
[1:25:22] Tyran all of this area
[1:25:25] Afghanistan uh how I know how you say
[1:25:28] that
[1:25:29] okay that was all the Persian Empire
[1:25:35] okay that was all the Persian Empire in
[1:25:39] normal day setting so Babylon
[1:25:43] is now present-day Iraq
[1:25:49] do you get you know yeah I just want you
[1:25:51] to understand what you're looking at so
[1:25:54] Iraq
[1:25:56] and Iran
[1:25:58] were all part of it right down at the
[1:26:01] end of the Persian Gulf
[1:26:03] right kind of where it says Kuwait right
[1:26:06] above that is where ER was
[1:26:09] where the city that Nehemiah was in so
[1:26:13] that's the present day
[1:26:16] Kingdom
[1:26:18] of Persia
[1:26:19] Iran wasn't called Persia until 19
[1:26:23] Iran tell uh early 1900s it was known as
[1:26:28] Persia
[1:26:29] and then it became Iraq Syria and that
[1:26:34] Kingdom eventually broke up that's the
[1:26:37] physical area that this story is
[1:26:41] transpiring in so if you want to know
[1:26:44] the history what happened to the Persian
[1:26:46] Empire a fellow raised up in Turkey
[1:26:50] by the name of Alexander
[1:26:53] and Alexander went and defeated
[1:26:56] the Persian Empire Alexander the Great
[1:27:00] and when Alexander the Great
[1:27:03] passed away his sons and different
[1:27:06] people got in battles and it broke up
[1:27:08] into four different kingdoms and then or
[1:27:12] Empires and then history started coming
[1:27:15] down so all these events from the
[1:27:18] capture of the children of Israel till
[1:27:21] the time that Cyrus takes over
[1:27:24] so this is where our story picks up
[1:27:28] is the children of Israel
[1:27:31] have left following God
[1:27:34] the Lord promised them if they would
[1:27:37] keep his Commandments
[1:27:39] he would take care of them but if they
[1:27:42] refused to keep his Commandments he
[1:27:44] would scatter him
[1:27:46] throughout the Earth so that's the
[1:27:48] promise so let's go back and start just
[1:27:51] for a few moments this morning
[1:27:53] if the book of Ezra so if you have in
[1:27:57] your mind
[1:27:58] because the picture Abraham came out of
[1:28:01] to Abraham came out of I I or Iraq to go
[1:28:07] to Israel and and Iran and all that's
[1:28:11] the present-day company so we'll just
[1:28:13] read a little bit of Ezra so you can
[1:28:15] understand the story this is 16 years
[1:28:20] before Nehemiah
[1:28:23] okay the king Cyrus now has conquered
[1:28:27] his kingdom he's taken the throne he is
[1:28:32] an offspring of Ishmael
[1:28:36] all right which we would refer to as an
[1:28:38] Arab Nation Arabic people he's The
[1:28:42] Offspring of Ishmael he believes in God
[1:28:48] okay so he's he's not a pagan I I I
[1:28:55] don't want to shock any of you
[1:28:58] but there's a lot of people that don't
[1:29:01] believe the message believe in God
[1:29:04] they love the Lord
[1:29:06] they serve them with all their heart
[1:29:09] and they will be there
[1:29:13] okay that is not your election
[1:29:19] it's not our job to change the world
[1:29:25] our duty
[1:29:27] is to profess
[1:29:29] what God has revealed to us
[1:29:32] that it might be a blessing to who's
[1:29:35] ever willing to receive it
[1:29:42] so we're not the judge
[1:29:46] you understand if someone accepts the
[1:29:48] message
[1:29:50] we trust that they'll accept the
[1:29:52] benefits of the message which is to have
[1:29:55] faith that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:29:58] yesterday today and forever and that the
[1:30:01] love of God is shed abroad in their
[1:30:03] heart by the Holy Spirit
[1:30:06] and I can have a fellowship with anybody
[1:30:08] that confesses the Lord Jesus Christ if
[1:30:11] they don't see it eye to eye that's fine
[1:30:15] I'm not going to condemn them for
[1:30:18] something that I receive freely from the
[1:30:21] Lord
[1:30:23] you know and if if they can't understand
[1:30:25] my Revelation what am I going to do
[1:30:28] boast that I understood it on my own
[1:30:31] that is something that I achieved and
[1:30:34] that everybody can achieve not everybody
[1:30:36] can come to this message there's an
[1:30:39] elected group of ladies
[1:30:42] you understand and each of us has a
[1:30:46] bride and as the bride that we chose
[1:30:49] there's a lot of good women but that's
[1:30:51] not the one that God placed you with
[1:30:54] so remember you you are not Christianity
[1:30:59] you are an elected lady out of
[1:31:02] Christianity for the purpose of reflect
[1:31:06] that he can reflect his person in you in
[1:31:11] the last day that you can be the last
[1:31:14] voice to a dying generation and they can
[1:31:17] see Jesus Christ Living in human flesh
[1:31:20] and not in organizations religions and
[1:31:24] systems
[1:31:26] exactly so here the word made Flash
[1:31:31] you understand we're not theologians
[1:31:34] trying to go out and straighten up the
[1:31:35] world
[1:31:38] you know if they love the Lord that's
[1:31:40] great I love how Paul approached him
[1:31:42] have you guys received the Holy Ghost
[1:31:44] since you believe he didn't say oh you
[1:31:46] bunch of unbelievers you don't got the
[1:31:49] Holy Ghost
[1:31:50] I'm so holy
[1:31:52] no he said did you know that God's Got
[1:31:55] Something greater for you
[1:31:57] we didn't even know a such thing
[1:31:59] he said well how are you baptized
[1:32:02] he says we are baptized by John unto
[1:32:05] repins
[1:32:06] he said well the Lord has a baptism of
[1:32:09] the spirit
[1:32:11] now I'm going to follow the formula if
[1:32:13] you'll repent of your sins except Jesus
[1:32:17] Christ as your savior in your heart but
[1:32:19] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:32:21] Jesus Christ you shall receive the
[1:32:23] promise they were already believers
[1:32:27] they just weren't baptized with the
[1:32:30] baptism that the Lord Jesus and they
[1:32:32] accepted it gladly and the spirit of the
[1:32:35] Lord came in their lives and in their
[1:32:37] heart and they realized now there was a
[1:32:39] presence of the Lord was leading them it
[1:32:42] switched from intellectual to spiritual
[1:32:45] leadership
[1:32:50] I would rather serve God intellectually
[1:32:53] than not serve him at all
[1:32:57] and if they're not against you
[1:32:59] they're for you
[1:33:03] and attitude
[1:33:05] means everything
[1:33:07] to the Church of the Living God going
[1:33:10] forward
[1:33:11] you can hold this message in a bad
[1:33:14] attitude and it doesn't do you any good
[1:33:16] it doesn't do anybody else any good the
[1:33:20] scripture describes it this way holding
[1:33:22] the truth of God in unrighteousness
[1:33:29] right we don't want to do that
[1:33:31] the same love that he loved you with you
[1:33:35] love everybody with
[1:33:37] amen you just love them
[1:33:41] and what what's your hope your hope is
[1:33:43] what he did for you he can do for them
[1:33:46] and that's all you what you're trying to
[1:33:49] and if they reject it they're not
[1:33:51] rejecting you
[1:33:54] they'll rejecting him
[1:33:57] and a lot of times it's just because
[1:33:58] they've been taught wrong
[1:34:01] so we began to we begin to see our story
[1:34:04] now here comes Cyrus in he's a son of
[1:34:07] Ishmael
[1:34:09] he's an Arab
[1:34:11] can you you know what I mean that's his
[1:34:14] that's his background we're not talking
[1:34:16] about Muhammad we're just talking about
[1:34:18] that he believed in the same God the god
[1:34:21] of Abraham he believed Abraham his was
[1:34:24] his father he comes over and he becomes
[1:34:27] the king the first year and God moves on
[1:34:30] his heart
[1:34:33] you know God's moving on a lot of
[1:34:35] people's hearts out there to do things
[1:34:37] when when he can't move on the hearts of
[1:34:41] people within the framework of what we
[1:34:43] follow because we're not open to nothing
[1:34:49] we kind of believe what we believe is
[1:34:52] going to get us there
[1:34:53] but my point this morning to the path of
[1:34:56] restoration
[1:34:57] to be restored is to understand that
[1:35:00] when it's Paul speaking of in Ephesians
[1:35:04] I think it's one in five that we are for
[1:35:07] ordained unto good works that we should
[1:35:10] walk in them our Pursuit here this
[1:35:14] morning is to find the good works that
[1:35:19] God has foreordained for us to do and to
[1:35:23] walk in them
[1:35:26] it's not belonging
[1:35:29] it's not joining it's not getting the
[1:35:32] right doctor it's personally
[1:35:35] young ladies young men older ladies
[1:35:38] older men
[1:35:39] uh Supreme Elders uh you it doesn't
[1:35:43] matter where that you are
[1:35:47] God had a purpose for calling you
[1:35:50] and and and and
[1:35:52] to bring us to the work that he had
[1:35:56] foreordained for us to do that we should
[1:35:59] walk in that work we're walking a lot of
[1:36:02] times in belief but we're not walking in
[1:36:04] the work that's foreign for us to do
[1:36:07] okay I I hope I'm not causing any
[1:36:10] confusion but Paul even said show me
[1:36:12] your faith without your works and I'll
[1:36:15] show you my faith because I'm walking in
[1:36:18] the calling wherein I was called
[1:36:21] and I hope it sets in your heart this
[1:36:25] morning that you've got to call not just
[1:36:28] a call to serve him Paul made that so
[1:36:31] simple he says that's your reasonable
[1:36:33] service that's the least that's required
[1:36:37] of you
[1:36:39] but I've got something for you to do
[1:36:43] no man lighteth a candle
[1:36:47] and put it under a bushel basket
[1:36:50] but he lets it Shine that the world
[1:36:52] might see that his good works might
[1:36:55] glorify his father in Heaven
[1:36:59] damn and we can't write that off
[1:37:03] because this is the age of what
[1:37:07] restoration this is the restoration of
[1:37:10] the Bride tree this is the restoration
[1:37:13] of the Bride back to what she was called
[1:37:17] out to do with the same power the same
[1:37:20] works that he did
[1:37:23] this is the restoration of the bride and
[1:37:26] there's a path to that restoration
[1:37:30] so we understand that this King it says
[1:37:33] in in Ezra the second verse
[1:37:38] he says and the Cyrus King of Persia
[1:37:43] the Lord of Heaven hath given me all the
[1:37:46] kingdoms of the Earth
[1:37:48] and hath charged me to build him a house
[1:37:53] at Jerusalem which is in
[1:37:57] Judea
[1:38:02] we know the story of Ezra right
[1:38:04] so what took place is that Cyrus found
[1:38:08] the men they went there the priest
[1:38:11] gathered together
[1:38:13] they came into that land and they built
[1:38:16] the temple
[1:38:18] and the temple was restored
[1:38:22] and then we can now turn
[1:38:25] to Nehemiah the first chapter
[1:38:27] and where we pick up our story
[1:38:30] Nehemiah is in that first city we showed
[1:38:33] you on the map the city of I I don't
[1:38:37] know how to pronounce it I'm sorry for
[1:38:39] my lack of ability to pronounce but he
[1:38:44] he was at a
[1:38:49] Santa which is also known as
[1:38:54] s-u-s-a I believe that's that first
[1:38:57] little town that was the winner Palace
[1:39:00] of the Persian king now who's ruling the
[1:39:05] Persian Empire is the grandson of Cyrus
[1:39:10] he says and the words of Nehemiah the
[1:39:14] son of
[1:39:16] hatch
[1:39:17] uh leha
[1:39:21] and it came to pass in the month of
[1:39:25] uh
[1:39:27] chisholu now that according to all
[1:39:30] history is our December
[1:39:33] so there was in December so the king uh
[1:39:37] uh uh
[1:39:41] exerts yes or however you said his name
[1:39:43] uh he is now at his winter dwelling
[1:39:48] and it came to pass in the month of uh
[1:39:52] Joseph in the 20th year as I was in uh
[1:40:00] the palace that hananiah one of my
[1:40:05] brethren so we know that hananiah is the
[1:40:08] brother of Nehemiah
[1:40:12] actually flesh brother
[1:40:15] came and he and certain men of Judea and
[1:40:20] they asked them concerning the Jews and
[1:40:25] I asked them concerning the Jews that
[1:40:28] had escaped
[1:40:30] and what were left in the Captivity and
[1:40:34] concerning Jerusalem
[1:40:37] so he was
[1:40:40] worried about his brethren
[1:40:44] he was wondering what's going on in my
[1:40:46] home even though he was in captivity
[1:40:49] he still had a land that he was longing
[1:40:53] for
[1:40:56] amen
[1:40:58] he got a land that he's longing for he
[1:41:01] knows where his root is he knows where
[1:41:04] he's from he hasn't forgot his people he
[1:41:08] just like Shadrach machine
[1:41:10] Abednego before him he hasn't let the
[1:41:14] world dilute him from being and standing
[1:41:18] to what he believes right
[1:41:21] so he kept his integrity
[1:41:24] it isn't that what we heard this morning
[1:41:26] Lord I've kept my Integrity I've kept
[1:41:29] true to my principles I kept true to
[1:41:31] what I believe in let me tell you a path
[1:41:34] to Restoration takes Integrity it takes
[1:41:38] you having principles and lines you
[1:41:41] don't cross regardless of the situation
[1:41:44] or circumstance
[1:41:47] you say well if I don't do this job or
[1:41:50] take this job this job wants me to work
[1:41:52] and I can't be in church he says but if
[1:41:56] I don't take this job I won't eat
[1:42:00] your integrity has changed
[1:42:04] you besides what you can do and what God
[1:42:07] will do for you when you stand true to
[1:42:10] your values
[1:42:12] and your integrity
[1:42:14] he'll move mountains
[1:42:16] he'll do extremely above what you can
[1:42:20] even ask or think that's the god that's
[1:42:23] got to be restored we're on the path to
[1:42:26] Restoration where God is the rules
[1:42:31] and he's the head of Our Lives the head
[1:42:34] of our heart we don't we don't we just
[1:42:37] don't compromise
[1:42:41] and the whole world is designed to make
[1:42:44] this last day lady compromise to reason
[1:42:50] because he makes it unreasonable to
[1:42:53] serve God this whole story of Nehemiah
[1:42:55] and Ezra is totally unreasonable in the
[1:42:59] historical setting that we're in
[1:43:03] so he goes he says
[1:43:06] and they said unto me
[1:43:10] The Remnant that are left of the
[1:43:13] Captivity so what was the Captivity the
[1:43:17] Babylonian captivity
[1:43:19] there were Jews that were left there
[1:43:22] now Cyrus sent to rebuild the Temple
[1:43:26] okay God moved on him he said go build
[1:43:29] the temple he sent Ezra in Jerusalem and
[1:43:33] them and they rebuilt the temple now
[1:43:36] they're coming and say what happened to
[1:43:38] those Jews
[1:43:39] how are they doing the ones that went to
[1:43:41] build the temple the ones that that were
[1:43:46] left us and are are there living in in
[1:43:50] the land of Our Father Abraham how are
[1:43:53] they doing
[1:43:54] and and he said and this is how they
[1:43:57] answered and they said to me the remnant
[1:44:00] that are left of the Captivity there in
[1:44:04] the province are in great Affliction and
[1:44:08] reproach
[1:44:11] the walls of Jerusalem
[1:44:14] also is broken down and the gate thereof
[1:44:19] are burnt
[1:44:21] with fire
[1:44:23] their walls have become broken down
[1:44:28] what are the walls to a Christian
[1:44:31] they're the things that keep the enemy
[1:44:34] out
[1:44:35] they're Gates
[1:44:38] were burnt
[1:44:40] there was no possession of the gates of
[1:44:44] the enemy The Fortress was gone
[1:44:48] it was all broke down in fact the people
[1:44:52] were living in the ruins
[1:44:58] they had they were there because the
[1:44:59] temple was there
[1:45:01] but their lives were in what ruined
[1:45:07] what it also did Cyrus do if you go back
[1:45:11] and read the book of Ezra he went to the
[1:45:14] treasure he took all the temple
[1:45:17] jewelry all the temple artifacts all the
[1:45:21] temple things of sacrifice and he sent
[1:45:24] them all back to the temple so now the
[1:45:27] Temple's there
[1:45:29] they got all their worship going they're
[1:45:32] burning daily sacrifices they're doing
[1:45:34] all the religious things but the
[1:45:37] people's lives are in ruined
[1:45:43] an amazing type
[1:45:47] is an amazing circumstance
[1:45:51] because they have a place of worship but
[1:45:55] the people have no fortification they
[1:45:57] have no gate
[1:45:59] and they're despised
[1:46:04] in other words what that means is the
[1:46:06] people are mocking them
[1:46:09] oh you children of God
[1:46:12] you weak powerless
[1:46:14] people
[1:46:16] because history always show with the
[1:46:18] Jews that when when they were right
[1:46:23] God blessed them spiritually
[1:46:26] and physically
[1:46:29] he protected him
[1:46:33] because they were in that period
[1:46:36] of the first Exodus
[1:46:40] we're not looking for those kinds of
[1:46:42] blessing
[1:46:43] we're looking for a blessing that
[1:46:45] transforms us
[1:46:46] Plum out of here
[1:46:48] and so we find out that this is where
[1:46:51] they are so the the there that it's a
[1:46:55] reproach the walls of Jerusalem are
[1:46:58] broken down
[1:47:02] is broken down in the gates they are
[1:47:06] also burned with fire
[1:47:09] he says and it came to pass
[1:47:12] when I heard these words that I sat down
[1:47:16] and wept
[1:47:20] one of the curses of this generation is
[1:47:22] a Hardness of Heart
[1:47:27] it is
[1:47:29] we hear so much garbage
[1:47:32] so much crime so much going on in the
[1:47:36] world that that we just want to shut it
[1:47:39] out and because of iniquity
[1:47:43] man's heart were hardened
[1:47:49] come here the path of restoration
[1:47:52] is the loosening up of a hard heart
[1:47:58] the Turning of a Heart of Stone to a
[1:48:01] heart that feels
[1:48:04] you can never be restored if until you
[1:48:08] can feel what your brother's feeling
[1:48:12] how many knows what virtue that is in
[1:48:15] the Statue of a perfect man
[1:48:18] what's it called it's called brotherly
[1:48:21] kindness
[1:48:26] it's the virtue
[1:48:29] that defeats the spirit of ladyocia
[1:48:34] look when your heart's no longer Harden
[1:48:37] you care and are concerned for the needs
[1:48:42] of your fellow man
[1:48:46] you're not hardened up
[1:48:50] Believe It or Not Republicans get get
[1:48:53] saved
[1:48:55] maybe few
[1:48:57] everybody thinks Republicans is the big
[1:49:00] standard for Christianity
[1:49:04] I don't know
[1:49:06] it's just pick your devil
[1:49:10] Or democrats or all that that's all
[1:49:13] garbage
[1:49:16] we don't follow that stuff we don't get
[1:49:18] into that stuff
[1:49:22] he said follow thou me
[1:49:25] look at that so Nehemiah
[1:49:29] he
[1:49:31] he he sits down and and he Weeps
[1:49:36] and he Mourns certain days and fasted
[1:49:40] and prayed before the god of Heaven
[1:49:48] you know our messenger was given to
[1:49:50] fasting
[1:49:52] and praying
[1:49:55] we don't believe in a group fast
[1:49:59] we don't call a group fast
[1:50:02] and say everybody lets all of us fast
[1:50:06] but let me tell you fasting and praying
[1:50:08] is a wonderful way to get to the Lord
[1:50:14] it cleanses your mind
[1:50:19] it focuses your spirit
[1:50:24] this burden
[1:50:26] that struck Nehemiah
[1:50:30] when he heard about it
[1:50:33] it actually touched them so deep that he
[1:50:37] wept about it
[1:50:39] so that his fellow
[1:50:42] Believers were going through such
[1:50:46] misery and torment why could you imagine
[1:50:49] if we had that same feeling to the
[1:50:52] children of our members and to our
[1:50:54] relatives and our Outlaws that it would
[1:50:56] actually drive us to fasting and praying
[1:51:01] not a glass of milk and a bunch of Oreo
[1:51:04] cookies
[1:51:06] we say you know I'm not going to eat
[1:51:08] lunch today
[1:51:09] on behalf of brother such and such her
[1:51:13] sister such and such or I'm I'm going to
[1:51:16] take a couple days
[1:51:18] and I'm going to pray and I'm gonna fast
[1:51:21] I want the Lord to know
[1:51:24] I'm serious
[1:51:26] I want him to know that I'm I'm putting
[1:51:30] myself on the line because I'm making
[1:51:33] petition to him
[1:51:38] it's man's nature that he thinks that
[1:51:42] he's going to get something poured on
[1:51:45] him in the form of anointing
[1:51:48] without ever having any sacrifice
[1:51:52] without ever bringing the flesh under
[1:51:54] subjection without ever setting apart
[1:51:58] and setting aside at the the the things
[1:52:02] that so easily beset us the sin and the
[1:52:05] unbelief that so easily besets us the
[1:52:09] the sacrifice that it takes to shut out
[1:52:13] the world
[1:52:16] now we're talking about making a rapture
[1:52:19] we're talking about the hours closing in
[1:52:23] we have to sit in trustee meetings and
[1:52:26] actually consider what Pathways do we
[1:52:29] have if the government decides to tax us
[1:52:39] you know our trust is in the Lord
[1:52:44] but sometimes people don't have burden
[1:52:47] for nothing
[1:52:50] like I I tried to speak to you last time
[1:52:55] I think if we would go through our
[1:52:57] average offering it's like a couple
[1:53:00] dollars per person
[1:53:05] we take up space we don't have a burden
[1:53:07] for it
[1:53:08] people are sitting in the Overflow we
[1:53:10] don't have a burden for them we don't
[1:53:12] care
[1:53:13] we're just here taking care of Sunday
[1:53:16] morning obligation
[1:53:19] we don't care about what's going on in
[1:53:21] our brothers and sisters lives we're not
[1:53:23] praying for everybody we don't look for
[1:53:25] anybody
[1:53:27] I had a lady call us and tell us she
[1:53:29] said well
[1:53:31] my son's going through a real hard time
[1:53:35] so I asked the pastor
[1:53:38] to come pray for him
[1:53:40] m
[1:53:42] M he didn't want the pastor to pray for
[1:53:44] him
[1:53:45] I can understand that how to accept that
[1:53:48] he said I want Billy to pray
[1:53:52] I'm with me I I
[1:53:55] I'm not after any praise Or Glory I
[1:53:57] Billy yes preach God go pray
[1:54:00] they want Billy to pray for him either
[1:54:04] they picked another church to go to
[1:54:08] because he can pack that spirit
[1:54:10] in that church and feel no condemnation
[1:54:13] and feel no conviction
[1:54:19] you know I thought okay
[1:54:21] I don't care I'm glad you're in church
[1:54:25] I'm just glad he didn't choose a
[1:54:26] Catholic Church
[1:54:31] I mean
[1:54:33] it's it's more serious
[1:54:36] than I can make
[1:54:37] to you
[1:54:39] so Nehemiah is broken
[1:54:44] because of the condition of his brethren
[1:54:48] and he's the natural
[1:54:51] because that was he was in the natural
[1:54:53] Exodus we are now in the spiritual
[1:54:56] Exodus facing a new Exodus there is
[1:55:00] going to be another leaving
[1:55:04] can we want to get as many in as we can
[1:55:09] we want to be burdened the prophet God
[1:55:12] said the evidence of a Christian Life is
[1:55:15] people that live for other people if
[1:55:18] you're convinced your concern if you
[1:55:21] understand that there's another Exodus
[1:55:24] there's another leaving and as we've
[1:55:28] said many times the the Rapture is not a
[1:55:32] date it's a condition
[1:55:34] you're in rapturing conditions can
[1:55:37] people have shared with us the rapture's
[1:55:39] on now yes the Rapture is on now the
[1:55:42] last voice has come the preparation of
[1:55:45] the Bride the incoming Spirit to Quicken
[1:55:49] you into wrappering condition is trying
[1:55:52] to take hold in the lives of Christians
[1:55:55] in other words ladyocia is Jesus Christ
[1:55:58] standing at the door knocking to get
[1:56:01] into your heart personally
[1:56:06] where the love of God is shed abroad in
[1:56:09] Your Heart by his nature which is the
[1:56:12] Holy Spirit
[1:56:16] you become Christians
[1:58:12] Roman Empire's gonna come up it's going
[1:58:15] to take it all they're going to be put
[1:58:17] into the place they're going to put a
[1:58:19] tax because Jews are going to return to
[1:58:22] Bethlehem and the whole story of God is
[1:58:25] unfolding despite all the political
[1:58:28] turmoil and history change that's going
[1:58:32] on
[1:58:35] that's what we want to be a part of we
[1:58:38] want to be a part of God we want to be a
[1:58:40] part of his mind we want to be a part of
[1:58:42] his movement we want to be the people
[1:58:44] that is molding and making and putting
[1:58:48] the burden and putting his love in and
[1:58:50] putting his heart in
[1:58:54] that work that we're representing and
[1:58:57] standing there for what our kingdom is
[1:59:02] and we ought to be heartbroken
[1:59:06] that the kingdom
[1:59:08] of God
[1:59:10] and of this message is in such disarray
[1:59:15] they're men of trying to elevate
[1:59:17] themselves and they're trying to look at
[1:59:19] their works and and we're all broken
[1:59:22] down and we're getting away from the
[1:59:24] voice of the messenger of the hour
[1:59:28] I don't think he would be pleased
[1:59:33] what are you going to do about it David
[1:59:36] I'm going to do my part
[1:59:41] I'm going to try to have the right
[1:59:43] Spirit I'm gonna try my love my brother
[1:59:46] I'm going to try to beat the bigger
[1:59:48] Circle I'm going to watch my own
[1:59:50] personal Integrity I'm not going to let
[1:59:53] people take me down
[1:59:57] I want to be lifted up how are you going
[1:59:59] to do that well a little prayer would
[2:00:02] help a little fasting would help a
[2:00:06] little good works would help
[2:00:09] what do they call Insanity when you
[2:00:13] continually do the same thing over and
[2:00:16] over again thinking you're going to get
[2:00:18] a different result
[2:00:23] something's got to change
[2:00:27] there had to come a change
[2:00:29] in Nehemiah
[2:00:33] do you understand that
[2:00:35] there had to be something restored in
[2:00:39] Nehemiah
[2:00:40] now Nehemiah is just like you
[2:00:44] he wasn't anything special
[2:00:48] he was a cup Bearer
[2:00:55] what kind of credentials do you think Mr
[2:00:58] Kitt you would have to have to hold a
[2:01:00] cup
[2:01:02] I think you could do that couldn't you
[2:01:04] if I gave you a glass and said bring me
[2:01:06] a glass of water you could do that
[2:01:12] what happens if I told you to build a
[2:01:14] city
[2:01:16] couldn't do that without God could you
[2:01:19] but if God was with you you could build
[2:01:21] the city
[2:01:24] he was nothing
[2:01:27] not of great reputation not a great Fame
[2:01:33] maybe not even well educated but you
[2:01:35] know one thing he did have he had a
[2:01:37] right spirit
[2:01:38] he had a right spirit
[2:01:41] and when he heard the news it tore his
[2:01:43] heart up
[2:01:45] but what was taking place the hand of
[2:01:47] God was trying to restore Nehemiah out
[2:01:52] of his lukewarm position and the comfort
[2:01:56] that he was in and try to stir him up
[2:02:01] because God wanted something to be done
[2:02:04] right God wanted the walls to be built
[2:02:07] back again and the gates to be back
[2:02:09] again and God wants you to build your
[2:02:12] wall back again around your life and
[2:02:15] build your Gates
[2:02:19] because the promise is I will restore
[2:02:22] saith the Lord and the Gates of Hell
[2:02:25] shall not Prevail against it
[2:02:28] I'll build a wall around you
[2:02:31] his word
[2:02:34] but I think our walls have gotten torn
[2:02:36] down
[2:02:39] and We Know Better
[2:02:44] We Know Better
[2:02:45] I can hear the prophet I never
[2:02:47] understood it like I did this morning
[2:02:50] him sitting back and saying
[2:02:54] the Sheep got out
[2:02:57] but how did the goats get in
[2:03:01] we let down the what
[2:03:03] the bars
[2:03:05] the wall
[2:03:07] we let the wall
[2:03:09] now
[2:03:14] all of you got a wall
[2:03:16] that you've got to maintain
[2:03:20] all of you got a gate
[2:03:22] Prophet said so
[2:03:24] he's got a Punch coming in all of us
[2:03:28] a spot that we're weak
[2:03:35] I've
[2:03:37] I know what it's like to be punched down
[2:03:41] I know how hard it is to get up
[2:03:44] but I thank God there's something in me
[2:03:46] that says where else can I go
[2:03:49] where else can I go you alone have the
[2:03:53] words to eternal life
[2:03:57] restore Me Lord
[2:04:03] the path to Restoration
[2:04:06] here's a nobody
[2:04:09] but God has positioned him
[2:04:13] and prepared him
[2:04:16] and placed him
[2:04:19] here is
[2:04:21] a god
[2:04:23] doing great things unexpected things in
[2:04:27] unexpected ways using unexpected people
[2:04:34] don't let Satan use your personality
[2:04:38] against you
[2:04:39] you remind them wait a minute I've been
[2:04:42] borned again
[2:04:43] see this personality you're picking on
[2:04:46] I'm at war with him
[2:04:49] the flesh Warth against the spirit and
[2:04:51] the spirit against the Flesh and these
[2:04:54] two are contrary to another
[2:04:57] but I have an author and a finisher of
[2:05:00] my faith and I'm going to lock you up
[2:05:02] and bring you under subjection I'm going
[2:05:05] to build a wall around you and I'm going
[2:05:08] to close your gate
[2:05:13] so here's Nehemiah
[2:05:16] he is God's put this whole thing in
[2:05:20] beautiful perspective
[2:05:22] he has the king
[2:05:25] I guess it's
[2:05:27] I think who that King is I might
[2:05:29] pronounce his name wrong and nehemiah's
[2:05:32] cup bear
[2:05:35] and nehemiah's continents
[2:05:40] his atmosphere
[2:05:42] and his attitude
[2:05:44] was very pleasing to the king another is
[2:05:48] the king like to be have him around
[2:05:51] it made him feel good
[2:05:53] how many knows prophet of God talks
[2:05:55] about that he says there's some people
[2:05:58] that sweet you just like to be around
[2:06:00] and there's other people you just don't
[2:06:01] want to be around at all
[2:06:04] they've always got something negative to
[2:06:06] say
[2:06:07] they'll always criticizing
[2:06:11] you know okay you know I live here in
[2:06:13] Dallas Fort Worth
[2:06:15] God put me here
[2:06:16] people always tell I wouldn't live here
[2:06:18] for nothing this is just an old dump and
[2:06:21] and all this stuff you know something go
[2:06:23] back to where you're happy I don't want
[2:06:25] to hear it I live here take your
[2:06:27] negative thing about life I can live
[2:06:30] anywhere in Christ Jesus
[2:06:35] when I picked here probably not of
[2:06:38] but God put me here I've seen Souls one
[2:06:42] here I've seen people delivered I've
[2:06:44] seen people healed
[2:06:51] I'm sorry for sister pinel's loss but I
[2:06:53] remember that they had a daughter
[2:06:56] I remember the doctor going to brother
[2:06:58] Daniel
[2:07:00] and telling him
[2:07:03] who do you want to live
[2:07:06] your wife or your daughter
[2:07:12] how'd you like that choice
[2:07:14] which one of your kids would you want to
[2:07:16] give up
[2:07:18] I think you'd give your life for all of
[2:07:20] them wouldn't you
[2:07:23] I remember him coming
[2:07:27] he said Brother David they
[2:07:30] they want me to make a choice
[2:07:32] I said you don't have to make that
[2:07:34] choice
[2:07:37] if that choice has to be made let him
[2:07:40] make it
[2:07:43] don't let them put that on you
[2:07:46] let him make it
[2:07:49] and I said the joy of the Lord
[2:07:52] is our promise
[2:07:54] of peace that surpassed understanding
[2:07:57] brother Daniel took that word he went
[2:07:59] down to that hospital
[2:08:01] and he sat down in that Chapel
[2:08:05] you think he got serious
[2:08:08] you think he said a Hail Mary
[2:08:11] a Glory Be
[2:08:13] uh
[2:08:15] he had to find the Hem of His Garment
[2:08:19] he couldn't just grab anything he had to
[2:08:22] stay there till he found the Hem of His
[2:08:24] Garment he opened up the scripture in
[2:08:27] desperation he read a scripture about
[2:08:30] the joy of the Lord was his portion
[2:08:34] and he looked to Heaven he said father
[2:08:36] if I have to make this choice
[2:08:39] I will be sad
[2:08:42] the rest of my life
[2:08:45] and that's contrary to his word
[2:08:50] he walked down that Hall and he told
[2:08:53] that doctor bring her in there
[2:08:56] delivered the baby
[2:08:58] they'll live
[2:09:01] and I I don't remember which of his
[2:09:03] children it was but I think it was
[2:09:05] Symphony
[2:09:07] I don't even know if she's here this
[2:09:08] morning the family may be grieving are
[2:09:10] you here anywhere
[2:09:12] I guess not she just lost her
[2:09:15] brother
[2:09:18] that's getting serious with God
[2:09:22] so so many things
[2:09:26] brother Almighty people say well where's
[2:09:28] God in your midst I'll tell you where
[2:09:30] he's admit I don't come to you with
[2:09:32] enticing words but I come to you with
[2:09:34] power and demonstration in the spirit
[2:09:39] you would have never believed him
[2:09:42] he walked down to the aisle like this
[2:09:50] are you here brother
[2:09:53] are you here anywhere
[2:09:59] where you at
[2:10:01] stand up I can't see you
[2:10:05] way back get them out
[2:10:08] well you're not going to have an
[2:10:09] overflow pretty quick come here brother
[2:10:13] I want you to walk down the aisle
[2:10:15] he couldn't even walk down the aisle
[2:10:20] this is the hand of God this is the real
[2:10:22] hand of God this is the real miracle of
[2:10:25] God a real genuine miracle
[2:10:34] because he he had a God-fearing wife
[2:10:39] then the wife told him it told her said
[2:10:41] get ready he's not going to live
[2:10:49] she said I don't I don't accept that
[2:10:51] you're not going to live
[2:10:53] he looked back at her and he said I
[2:10:55] didn't like that doctor anyway
[2:11:01] but they got serious
[2:11:05] it's wrong
[2:11:07] I fell apart
[2:11:09] I'm back
[2:11:11] I'm still falling apart but that's okay
[2:11:17] he was serious
[2:11:20] he got serious
[2:11:22] you think that was the last attack
[2:11:24] no he got a she had a little
[2:11:29] son
[2:11:30] I called him baby John I still call him
[2:11:32] baby Johnny probably like to strangle me
[2:11:35] for it but
[2:11:38] they told me he'd be he'd be
[2:11:44] that he'd never now he's some smart guy
[2:11:47] real high in his class
[2:11:52] because we got a God that lives
[2:11:57] we got a job God that's proved himself
[2:12:00] to us now he is asking us
[2:12:07] to come to service
[2:12:09] for him
[2:12:12] that he can bring his light
[2:12:15] to a lost and dying generation and
[2:12:19] introduce Jesus Christ of our day in
[2:12:23] word form
[2:12:25] to who will ever receive it
[2:12:28] so God had prepared Nehemiah
[2:12:32] you believe that he positioned them
[2:12:35] seemingly a nobody just a cup Bearer
[2:12:41] but he kept a good attitude
[2:12:44] he kept a good atmosphere
[2:12:46] he did a really really good job with the
[2:12:51] assignment he was given
[2:12:54] if God put him to be a cup Bearer he was
[2:12:57] the best cup Bearer there was so much
[2:13:00] was he a cup Bearer The King didn't want
[2:13:02] anybody else bearing this cup but him
[2:13:05] you know you find that characteristic in
[2:13:08] the children of Israel that serve God
[2:13:11] kept God's Commandments and loved God
[2:13:14] they found favor with everybody around
[2:13:17] them a real Christian finds favor within
[2:13:20] and without
[2:13:22] if you think the whole world's mad at
[2:13:24] you and nobody likes you it just might
[2:13:26] be you
[2:13:32] except for my case
[2:13:40] no it just might be us
[2:13:42] might be our atmosphere might be our
[2:13:45] attitude might be the way we're
[2:13:47] approaching things
[2:13:49] Prophet God said it takes the right
[2:13:50] atmosphere
[2:13:53] for something to hatch
[2:13:56] the king had placed him prepared them
[2:14:00] he allowed a burden to come on his house
[2:14:03] now let's watch
[2:14:05] this is called the path to Restoration
[2:14:08] we've seen what God did God moved on the
[2:14:11] king of Syria to build the temple
[2:14:15] and what happened all the people that
[2:14:18] built the temple they just got cold and
[2:14:20] informal
[2:14:22] they went back and fell into religion
[2:14:26] they quit pursuing
[2:14:29] they lost their vision
[2:14:32] but God raises up Nehemiah he places
[2:14:35] them as the king's servant he's sitting
[2:14:38] there serving wine and then we pick up
[2:14:41] the next few verses
[2:14:43] and so this is
[2:14:45] Nehemiah now
[2:14:47] preparing himself
[2:14:53] the path to Restoration
[2:14:56] is God gives the burden
[2:15:00] the call in your life
[2:15:02] to apply the token
[2:15:04] to clean up
[2:15:06] to prepare for the rapture
[2:15:11] and then Nehemiah prepares himself
[2:15:14] and I said I beseech the O Lord
[2:15:18] God Of Heaven
[2:15:20] the great and terrible God
[2:15:23] that keepeth Covenant
[2:15:26] and mercy for them that love him and
[2:15:31] observe his Commandments
[2:15:37] number one rule
[2:15:40] to the path
[2:15:42] of restoration
[2:15:44] is go back
[2:15:46] and obey
[2:15:48] the Commandments
[2:15:49] keep the rules
[2:15:51] I'm not going to go over all the rules
[2:15:55] I think the rules should be written on
[2:15:57] your heart
[2:15:59] on the tablets of your heart by the Holy
[2:16:02] Spirit when the spirit of God convicts
[2:16:05] you of something he's convicting you
[2:16:07] because you're crossing the line
[2:16:09] and I said I beseech thee O Lord God Of
[2:16:12] Heaven the great and terrible God that
[2:16:15] keepeth covenants and mercy for them
[2:16:18] that love him and observe his
[2:16:20] Commandments let thine ear
[2:16:24] now be at Kenneth
[2:16:26] and thine eyes opened
[2:16:29] that doubt may US hear the prayer of thy
[2:16:34] servant basically saying Our Father
[2:16:37] which out in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[2:16:43] which I pray before thee now day and
[2:16:47] night for the children of Israel thy
[2:16:51] servants
[2:16:53] what do you notice something there
[2:16:56] day and night
[2:16:58] when you get a burden if it's a real
[2:17:01] burden you don't lay it down
[2:17:03] you don't pass it off
[2:17:06] it becomes a desire of your heart Lord I
[2:17:10] long to see
[2:17:12] my son restored
[2:17:17] day and night
[2:17:19] you pray day and night
[2:17:22] what's God's showing us all if he could
[2:17:25] take a cup pair
[2:17:28] and catch the heart of the king
[2:17:32] what will he do for you
[2:17:34] you know Satan trembles when a Christian
[2:17:37] hits his knees
[2:17:39] that God can do for you exceedingly and
[2:17:42] abundantly what you ask this burden has
[2:17:46] now came unto Nehemiah now em Nehemiah
[2:17:50] is taking his request to the throne
[2:17:56] he's making his request known he's out
[2:18:00] there calling in the presence of the
[2:18:02] Lord he's approaching God and the first
[2:18:06] thing he does is he acknowledges the
[2:18:09] greatness of God he gives him honor he
[2:18:13] gives them praise he lets him know he's
[2:18:16] the god that can do all things he's not
[2:18:18] popping in there and say hey Daddy
[2:18:21] I got a little something for you to do
[2:18:26] he's got fear
[2:18:28] he's got reverence he knows that the god
[2:18:32] that he's approaching can do what he's
[2:18:35] asking and it's not a hope so
[2:18:39] it's a firm burden that he's consumed
[2:18:44] with that he can't go any farther in his
[2:18:47] life until he gets some sort of
[2:18:51] resolution
[2:18:54] I think a lot of people give up way too
[2:18:56] early
[2:18:59] they're not sober
[2:19:03] they're not reverent
[2:19:05] and they're not resolved
[2:19:08] they just want to get the same
[2:19:09] experience that everybody else had oh
[2:19:13] such and such dance I wanted that
[2:19:15] substance that fell out I want to fellow
[2:19:17] good get the same experience that caused
[2:19:19] them to do that
[2:19:21] then it's yours it's not copycat
[2:19:25] it's genuine
[2:19:28] it's real you know what you're talking
[2:19:31] about do You Hear the prophet of God
[2:19:33] said I alive I believe in all the
[2:19:35] manifestation I got the Holy Spirit I
[2:19:37] know what it is I know what I'm talking
[2:19:39] about
[2:19:42] he said this poor lady was in the flesh
[2:19:45] she had cancer
[2:19:48] and she's probably dead tonight
[2:19:54] because of what
[2:19:56] wrong
[2:19:57] teaching
[2:20:03] so now Nehemiah is beseeching the Lord
[2:20:11] he said I pray day and night for the
[2:20:13] children of Israel thy servants
[2:20:15] and confess
[2:20:18] the sins
[2:20:20] of thy children of Israel
[2:20:23] which have sinned against thee
[2:20:26] both I and my father's house have sinned
[2:20:33] what is sin
[2:20:36] it's unbelief
[2:20:40] God's going to hold us responsible for
[2:20:43] unexercise faith
[2:20:45] if you haven't believed for anything you
[2:20:48] haven't been a
[2:20:50] have a burden you're not trying to call
[2:20:52] the spiritual ladder you don't need God
[2:20:55] to do something Supernatural in your
[2:20:57] life and you're just on some motorboat
[2:21:00] Cruise
[2:21:01] it's not pleasing to the father
[2:21:04] he's told you hope all things believe
[2:21:07] all things all things are possible he's
[2:21:11] he'll do exceedingly and abundantly for
[2:21:14] you above of what you can ask or think
[2:21:17] we don't want to let our faith lay
[2:21:20] dormant what is this age it's the
[2:21:22] restoration of the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:21:26] we want to get on the path of
[2:21:29] restoration not to not to some carnal
[2:21:32] thing but the real spiritual faith that
[2:21:35] believes that God's word will not fail
[2:21:39] and we can have what we ask for
[2:21:43] but look what it takes
[2:21:47] a burden
[2:21:50] not a demonstration
[2:21:55] I learned that the hard way
[2:21:58] but if it's a it's a burden
[2:22:03] I want to see a miracle because there's
[2:22:04] a miracle needed
[2:22:07] I don't want to see a miracle because I
[2:22:09] want to see a miracle
[2:22:12] I don't want to see a miracle so I can
[2:22:14] show people that there's miracles
[2:22:19] foreign
[2:22:23] it's not done in public
[2:22:26] we the world had a public show
[2:22:31] I'm trying to interpret Visions but he
[2:22:33] said I'll meet you in there
[2:22:39] it's you and him
[2:22:42] you laying your burdens you praying you
[2:22:46] exalting him you confessing your sins
[2:22:49] you admitting who he is and you're
[2:22:52] admitting Who You Are
[2:22:54] and what's standing between the sinner
[2:22:56] you can the great God is our great
[2:23:00] professionary the Lord Jesus Christ the
[2:23:04] word of God
[2:23:05] and I'll try to close we're moving now
[2:23:08] okay said
[2:23:11] now he's confessing now he's preparing
[2:23:15] himself
[2:23:19] he's on the path to Restoration
[2:23:22] he's finally received a burden in his
[2:23:25] heart
[2:23:27] he's got the spirit of intercession
[2:23:30] he's got the spirit of Burden
[2:23:33] he's Desiring the best for his brethren
[2:23:38] the family
[2:23:43] it's Christ
[2:23:47] showing himself forth
[2:23:49] in his servant Nehemiah
[2:23:52] We have dealt very corruptly against
[2:23:54] thee
[2:23:55] we have not kept thy Commandments
[2:23:58] nor the statues
[2:24:01] of the judgments
[2:24:03] which thou commandeth thy servant Moses
[2:24:08] remember I beseech thee the word
[2:24:12] that thou commandest thy servant Moses
[2:24:16] saying hallelujah
[2:24:18] oh now he's in the greatest hour
[2:24:23] and what is he approach him with
[2:24:26] he approaches them with the words spoken
[2:24:29] by the prophets
[2:24:32] Lord remember
[2:24:35] your promise
[2:24:37] remember your word why because we're
[2:24:41] partakers of divine nature through these
[2:24:45] great and exceedingly promises when it
[2:24:48] all comes down to earth it's not about
[2:24:50] him
[2:24:52] it's about him
[2:24:54] and what he said
[2:24:56] just like Abraham
[2:24:58] he said there where's the sacrifice he
[2:25:00] says our God will provide a sacrifice
[2:25:08] God still had to provide that sector of
[2:25:10] Faith didn't he
[2:25:12] is on his way
[2:25:16] of positioning the world
[2:25:20] so that promise sacrifice
[2:25:23] could come to pass remember he will
[2:25:26] position the world
[2:25:29] so are your heart's desire will come to
[2:25:32] pass can you got a spirit that bothers
[2:25:35] you
[2:25:36] get on the path of restoration get on
[2:25:39] the path talk it over with them admit
[2:25:42] who you are admit who he is admit you
[2:25:45] can't do it finally come to the place
[2:25:47] God your word said
[2:25:52] because where's Faith final resting
[2:25:54] place
[2:25:56] Nehemiah who's on the path of
[2:25:59] restoration is now going to find a place
[2:26:02] that he can anchor
[2:26:06] because once he hits that unmovable spot
[2:26:10] and now he's got the motivation
[2:26:13] and the word of the Lord to go forward
[2:26:20] are you with us
[2:26:22] the political worlds in a turmoil
[2:26:26] they're really all living in captivity
[2:26:29] under the great Persian Empire
[2:26:35] just totally destroyed Israel but God
[2:26:39] raises up a king
[2:26:41] and told that King to rebuild the Temple
[2:26:45] now here's the relatives of that King
[2:26:47] here's a cup baroness thing who's got
[2:26:50] the right Spirit the right attitude and
[2:26:53] everything he's broken-hearted
[2:26:56] and now he's praying to the Lord he's
[2:26:59] preparing himself
[2:27:03] for the work
[2:27:04] that's on his heart
[2:27:06] you believe we're foreordained unto good
[2:27:09] works do you believe that's personal
[2:27:13] don't count yourself out of the picture
[2:27:18] he never counted you out
[2:27:22] but can take prepare yourself
[2:27:27] so I love this part
[2:27:31] remember I beseech the the word
[2:27:35] that thou commandest thy servant Moses
[2:27:38] saying
[2:27:39] if ye transgress
[2:27:41] I will scatter you abroad among the
[2:27:46] Nations
[2:27:50] now he sees that doesn't he
[2:27:52] that's visible
[2:27:54] he sees the condition
[2:27:57] he recognizes the day in his message
[2:28:03] but if you turn unto me
[2:28:07] and keep my Commandments
[2:28:11] and do them
[2:28:15] though they were
[2:28:18] of You cast out unto the uttermost parts
[2:28:22] of Heaven
[2:28:24] yet I will gather them from hence
[2:28:28] and will bring them into the place that
[2:28:33] I have chosen to set my name
[2:28:37] oh can you imagine this fella
[2:28:41] I have a promise Lord
[2:28:45] I want that promise
[2:28:48] restored in me
[2:28:52] I'm admitting that my fathers have left
[2:28:55] you
[2:28:55] and we've been departed of your ways but
[2:28:58] you said if we'd return what's he saying
[2:29:02] I'm returning Lord I'm returning I'm
[2:29:05] coming back to you I've transgressed
[2:29:08] I've sinned I've failed I haven't done
[2:29:11] what I should do but I'm returning to
[2:29:14] you Lord I admit that I'm away from you
[2:29:18] but I need you
[2:29:22] he's on the path
[2:29:25] to being restored his heart's full he
[2:29:29] has no place to turn he has no entrance
[2:29:33] into the Throne of God
[2:29:38] but God provided something for him what
[2:29:41] was it
[2:29:42] his word
[2:29:44] when he found that word
[2:29:47] now he has an entrance
[2:29:49] to the kingdom
[2:29:51] and he walks in there and tells the King
[2:29:54] Kings
[2:29:57] the one that has rule over the mind of
[2:30:02] the king he's serving
[2:30:05] and he says you will gather him because
[2:30:08] you have chosen to put your name
[2:30:13] this is the land you gave my fathers
[2:30:16] this is my inheritance this is my
[2:30:19] promise this is where your son is going
[2:30:22] to return
[2:30:26] and it's not ready for him
[2:30:35] Lord you said you return for me
[2:30:39] maybe how to get ready
[2:30:42] maybe I ought to put a little more
[2:30:44] effort into it
[2:30:45] may it ought to be just a little more
[2:30:47] serious to me
[2:30:50] and he goes on he says
[2:30:55] now these are thy servants
[2:30:58] and thy people
[2:31:00] whom doubt hath redeemed
[2:31:03] by the great power
[2:31:05] and by the strong hand
[2:31:08] oh Lord what's he saying Lord you've
[2:31:10] done it before
[2:31:11] you can do it again
[2:31:15] oh Lord I beseech thee let now thy ear
[2:31:20] be attentive to the prayer of thy
[2:31:22] servant
[2:31:24] and I want you to notice what he
[2:31:26] recognizes himself as
[2:31:28] a servant
[2:31:31] we're all should be servants
[2:31:33] and the and to the prayer of thy
[2:31:37] servants
[2:31:38] plural
[2:31:40] considering that other people have the
[2:31:42] same burden he does
[2:31:44] and who desire to fear thy name and
[2:31:48] prosper
[2:31:54] I want us to prosper
[2:31:57] I want us to fear the name of the Lord I
[2:32:00] want us to uphold this message
[2:32:04] and the messenger that God sent in the
[2:32:07] utmost reverence
[2:32:09] in the utmost respect
[2:32:13] because it is the hand of God in our day
[2:32:17] cannot ashamed of it
[2:32:20] I'm trying to live it
[2:32:23] but I hope I'm not the only one right
[2:32:25] this is what he's saying I know I'm not
[2:32:27] the only one
[2:32:29] the prophet went to him I believe I
[2:32:31] forget who it was Isaiah my mind or one
[2:32:34] of the prophets and they went up to the
[2:32:37] Lord and they said Lord am I the only
[2:32:39] one he said no
[2:32:40] because there's 300 people here
[2:32:43] that have empowered their name was it
[2:32:45] three thousand three hundred
[2:32:48] seven thousand ooh sounds like seven
[2:32:50] Church ages and a whole lot of types I
[2:32:53] better not get going
[2:32:56] he says there's other people that feel
[2:32:58] this way
[2:33:01] isn't that just what Satan does he
[2:33:03] isolates us and make us feel that we're
[2:33:05] the only one we're the only one that's
[2:33:07] got burdens we're left alone
[2:33:10] you know what I say get back in the
[2:33:12] fight
[2:33:14] go get your Shield again
[2:33:17] we'll talk about this later we're going
[2:33:19] to close now
[2:33:21] this is the second chapter is better in
[2:33:23] the first
[2:33:26] maybe we'll talk about that tonight who
[2:33:28] knows
[2:33:29] so Lord I beseech thee now hear thy
[2:33:31] servant
[2:33:35] attentive to the prayers of thy servant
[2:33:38] and to the prayers of thy servants
[2:33:42] I want you to see how beautiful that is
[2:33:44] Lord don't only hear my prayer
[2:33:47] but hear the prayers of the people that
[2:33:50] are praying
[2:33:52] hear clever's prayer
[2:33:55] here
[2:33:57] all the prayers
[2:34:00] of the people
[2:34:01] in the house of the Lord
[2:34:04] amen hear noelle's prayer here here
[2:34:08] brother Tim and sister Melinda's prayer
[2:34:11] here brother Mike in Ellen's prayer hear
[2:34:13] Big John's prayer here Matt and Heidi's
[2:34:16] prayer I'll go through the congregation
[2:34:18] Lord hear their prayers too
[2:34:23] can you understand sometimes how really
[2:34:26] disconnected we are from the very
[2:34:29] restoration that we're supposed to be a
[2:34:32] part of this is the path to Restoration
[2:34:35] these kind of attitudes these kind of
[2:34:38] prayers these kinds of feelings
[2:34:41] are going to get the Faith of Our
[2:34:44] Fathers back because if it's not the
[2:34:47] Faith of Our Fathers it's a
[2:34:49] demonstration of power without character
[2:34:52] in that satanic
[2:34:57] just like the lady he said she's a good
[2:35:00] lady but she wasn't taught right she was
[2:35:03] in the flesh
[2:35:06] now if you run out
[2:35:09] and you don't have these basic Christian
[2:35:12] principles of love one for another and a
[2:35:15] burden one for another
[2:35:17] everything else is for naught
[2:35:20] though I speak with the tongues of men
[2:35:22] and angels and I do all these great
[2:35:24] works and have not charity
[2:35:28] what am I
[2:35:29] nothing
[2:35:31] I'm a sounding
[2:35:33] symbol I'm a tinkling brass in other
[2:35:36] words my life doesn't have a message
[2:35:44] and that's what we want
[2:35:48] we want the restoration of the message
[2:35:51] of Jesus Christ
[2:35:54] that's what's being restored to this
[2:35:57] church is the message that our fathers
[2:36:00] had
[2:36:02] who was the first fruit of that message
[2:36:05] that was waved before us where did we
[2:36:08] see what the demonstration of was a
[2:36:12] Christian that came to maturity that had
[2:36:15] that love
[2:36:16] that had that word that believed it that
[2:36:20] was making this intercession
[2:36:24] he was John the gospel the prayer of
[2:36:28] Jesus 17 in living flesh
[2:36:34] and now we've seen something before us
[2:36:37] that were to be restored to
[2:36:40] if you don't know what you're going to
[2:36:43] if you don't know what it is he's
[2:36:44] Desiring you to be if you don't know
[2:36:47] what it is that he wants restored we
[2:36:50] just played that on the tape for us
[2:36:53] then we don't know which where to go
[2:36:58] so part of the path of restoration is
[2:37:01] the preparation of yourself
[2:37:05] God positioned you where you are
[2:37:09] he placed you in this message
[2:37:12] how many thanked the Lord for that
[2:37:15] amen thank you Lord
[2:37:18] man I'd hate to be serving Mass
[2:37:22] man worse than that I hate to be a
[2:37:23] priest
[2:37:28] how would I look in a black suit with a
[2:37:30] little collar
[2:37:38] saying a rosary
[2:37:40] I don't mean to mock them
[2:37:42] but it's Babylon
[2:37:44] read hyssops to Babylons it's Babylonian
[2:37:48] Pagan worship the same rituals the same
[2:37:51] priesthood the same hierarchy in the
[2:37:54] Roman Catholic church today
[2:37:56] with all her daughters
[2:37:58] I want to be a part of that I want to be
[2:38:01] part of what God's restoring
[2:38:04] the word
[2:38:05] back into the heart of his pride and he
[2:38:08] closes in this way I pray thee thy
[2:38:11] servant this day
[2:38:13] and Grant him Mercy
[2:38:16] in the sight of this man
[2:38:19] for I was the Kings
[2:38:22] compare
[2:38:24] oh
[2:38:26] what what
[2:38:28] a distinct prayer
[2:38:33] God
[2:38:35] show me mercy
[2:38:37] in the sight of the king
[2:38:40] for I'm his cup Bearer
[2:38:44] we have not
[2:38:46] because we ask not
[2:38:48] and we don't ask because we don't know
[2:38:51] what we're to ask for
[2:38:56] and that's why I'd like to say this
[2:38:58] again in closing
[2:39:01] that's why you want to get reunited with
[2:39:04] this book
[2:39:07] this is the book of request
[2:39:10] to be made known to the Lord
[2:39:13] this is where you go to find out and and
[2:39:16] don't say well I followed the message
[2:39:18] wait a minute
[2:39:21] the message in the Bible are identical
[2:39:27] I do not separate them in any shame
[2:39:32] what
[2:39:34] part of its history
[2:39:37] part of its living today
[2:39:40] so I can see what he did
[2:39:43] because what he was yesterday
[2:39:46] he is today
[2:39:47] every promise in this book applies to my
[2:39:51] day and my hour
[2:39:54] I can go here and know
[2:39:57] what I can ask for I can go to the
[2:40:01] message of the hour and know the god
[2:40:03] that can keep that word
[2:40:06] they work like two sites okay they'll
[2:40:09] set you in the right direction they're
[2:40:11] the same thing your heart's burning
[2:40:14] with desire and he makes this final plea
[2:40:17] Lord give me
[2:40:19] grace and mercy in the sight of this man
[2:40:24] and then
[2:40:26] then the book gets real good
[2:40:29] because guess what
[2:40:31] you think he finds that Mercy I say yay
[2:40:37] do you think he accomplishes the work
[2:40:39] that God has him to do
[2:40:41] I say yay
[2:40:43] because my God can do anything
[2:40:46] but what
[2:40:48] fail
[2:40:49] have faith little flock
[2:40:52] because it's the father's good
[2:40:55] pleasure
[2:40:57] to give you
[2:40:58] the kingdom
[2:40:59] you believe that this morning
[2:41:02] you and you and you and you and you and
[2:41:06] you and you and you and all of you
[2:41:11] there's no big eyes
[2:41:14] there's just us little
[2:41:16] use
[2:41:18] but who's on our side
[2:41:21] if God before us
[2:41:24] who can be against it
[2:41:26] may that be restored in our hearts this
[2:41:28] morning that God's for us let's stand
[2:41:31] together this morning
[2:41:33] [Applause]
[2:41:35] amen
[2:41:41] I probably should say it again I I
[2:41:43] appreciate sometimes you clapping
[2:41:46] because you enjoyed the scripture and
[2:41:49] everything
[2:41:50] but you know brother Branham really
[2:41:51] spoke against that
[2:41:54] did you know that
[2:41:57] anyway so I I thank you for it and and
[2:42:01] don't make it personal but maybe just
[2:42:04] look up about
[2:42:06] what he kind of said it's all about him
[2:42:12] uh we're we're talking about
[2:42:15] what do I have to do to get to the place
[2:42:18] where my faith is restored
[2:42:21] that I can ask anything in my father's
[2:42:24] name and he'll do it
[2:42:30] I want to have
[2:42:33] Lord
[2:42:35] have mercy on me
[2:42:37] that your father would find favor
[2:42:40] with me
[2:42:42] when I speak
[2:42:43] [Music]
[2:42:45] to him
[2:42:46] in your name
[2:42:48] amen
[2:42:51] this is a a great song and and we'll
[2:42:55] sing a verse of it and then we'll sing
[2:42:58] something else but
[2:43:00] okay
[2:43:02] you know how you create a clean heart in
[2:43:04] you
[2:43:05] how many knows how you do that by the
[2:43:08] washing of the water
[2:43:10] of the word amen maybe this morning if
[2:43:14] the Lord dealt with your heart in some
[2:43:16] way and
[2:43:18] you've maybe felt a little tug to seek
[2:43:21] more or what it would be that God would
[2:43:24] have you to do in life
[2:43:26] you're a part of a body not just locally
[2:43:29] but
[2:43:30] worldwide Body of Christ
[2:43:33] and every
[2:43:35] pump of your heart
[2:43:37] makes this body live
[2:43:41] and we just trust this morning that
[2:43:44] if the enemy has made you feel that
[2:43:48] you're not a park
[2:43:50] I'm here to tell you this morning that
[2:43:53] you are
[2:43:55] and he's a liar
[2:43:57] and there's no truth in him
[2:44:01] he died for you this morning
[2:44:04] and he said nothing will pluck you out
[2:44:06] of the palm of his hand
[2:44:09] he said my sheep will hear my voice in
[2:44:12] another they will not follow
[2:44:14] and Lord I just pray this morning that
[2:44:17] our hearts desire is to be restored
[2:44:23] to the true message
[2:44:26] and the true spirit that was brought
[2:44:30] in this day by your messenger
[2:44:34] and Lord not Lord not to criticize
[2:44:37] because what does it matter
[2:44:41] if they tarry tell you come
[2:44:45] our commission is to follow you
[2:44:47] [Music]
[2:44:48] and Lord we know this path of
[2:44:51] restoration is the understanding that
[2:44:54] you've placed this where you've chosen
[2:44:58] and we prepare our hearts
[2:45:01] and we make our petition known
[2:45:04] [Music]
[2:45:08] and may all of us take a burden on for
[2:45:10] our brothers and sisters
[2:45:12] that this mind that was in Christ
[2:45:16] May manifest In the Flesh of your bride
[2:45:19] we pray with all our hearts
[2:45:22] Lord so by the washing of the word of
[2:45:24] God we pray that you would create a new
[2:45:28] spirit in each of our hearts this
[2:45:31] morning
[2:45:32] As we sing this little chord
[2:45:34] amen
