[31:09] the same yesterday today and forever so
[31:11] father we're committing this service to
[31:13] you that you would anoint us and speak
[31:15] to your people father in the precious
[31:17] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[31:19] we pray amen God bless you Saints if you
[31:23] would turn with me in your Bibles to
[31:25] Luke we want to thank the sound booth
[31:27] for for working through the fire um I
[31:31] know what it's like to be in the hot
[31:33] seat and uh so thankful that uh we're no
[31:36] longer in that seat but uh can
[31:40] appreciate each effort that's made and
[31:43] want to thank them uh going to look in
[31:46] Luke Chapter n we're going to read in
[31:50] verse uh starting in verse 51 and if I
[31:53] had a title or a way to carry the
[31:55] thought and just I inspiration that's
[31:59] that struck me I couldn't get it away
[32:00] from my heart but it's next year
[32:03] Jerusalem and as our pastor would
[32:06] Minister and say there's a path forward
[32:09] it caused me to contemplate what is it
[32:11] that we're looking to what is it that
[32:13] we're focusing on and uh just the theme
[32:17] next year Jerusalem resonated in our
[32:19] hearts and I in looking this scripture
[32:24] uh the Lord brought me to it quite sof
[32:27] Sly and I we'll take our text from here
[32:31] and it came to pass when the time was
[32:34] come that he should be received up he
[32:36] steadfastly set his face to Jerusalem
[32:40] and sent Messengers before his face and
[32:42] they went and entered into a village of
[32:45] the Samaritans to make ready for him and
[32:48] they did not receive him because his
[32:50] face was as though he would go to
[32:53] Jerusalem and when his disciples James
[32:56] and John saw this and and they said Lord
[32:59] wil thou that we command fire to come
[33:01] down from heaven and consume them even
[33:04] as Elias did but he turned and rebuked
[33:07] them and he said ye know not what manner
[33:11] of spirit ye are of for the son of man
[33:14] has not come to destroy men's lives but
[33:17] to save them and they went to another
[33:21] Village and I'm going to read even while
[33:24] you're standing it's a short quote but I
[33:26] fail to read it part of the text it's in
[33:29] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[33:31] and forever uh in
[33:34] 61 and I don't know if the paragraph
[33:36] number is entirely correct but I have 11
[33:39] I think when Solomon built the first
[33:41] temple it was cut out from all over the
[33:44] world shipped in cut out from the
[33:46] queries and from The Cedars cut up at
[33:48] Lebanon and floated down to japa and
[33:51] hauled by an oxcart and so forth and it
[33:53] was so masterly built that when the
[33:56] temple went together it had all kinds of
[33:58] little funny looking stones in it and
[34:00] when he began to read the blueprint it
[34:03] was all in the blueprint and there was
[34:05] not even a buzz of a Saul or a sound of
[34:07] a hammer for 40 years in the building
[34:09] the Temple I think that's the way God
[34:12] his people all cut out one's got a
[34:15] nature one kind one another but they're
[34:17] all Christians fitted Stones
[34:21] joined together upon the Chief
[34:23] Cornerstone Christ Jesus oh there's the
[34:26] main thing so many re reject the
[34:28] precious Cornerstone where we're all
[34:30] built together cemented together with
[34:33] God's love that's right God's love and
[34:36] when we have that there's nothing will
[34:38] separate us there's nothing can divide
[34:40] us as long as we love one another I've
[34:44] been a minister for 31 years I've seen
[34:46] all kinds of gifts I've seen God do
[34:48] great things but the the greatest thing
[34:50] I could ever seen in my life was love
[34:53] it's the most powerful force that stops
[34:55] anything there is is love love that
[34:58] moved a mighty God God so loved the
[35:01] world that he gave his only begotten son
[35:03] love is the keynote
[35:05] thing we leave out it's something that's
[35:09] Eternal God bless you you can have your
[35:14] seeds ask the Lord to bless the reading
[35:17] of his word
[35:19] and as we read that
[35:22] quote and looking at
[35:26] Jerusalem Jesus Christ to the scripture
[35:28] said he set his face to Jerusalem and if
[35:31] you read in the scripture where we took
[35:33] our text in Luke it's quite a lengthy
[35:35] chapter chapter nine a lot of things are
[35:37] transpiring in that chapter uh Jesus is
[35:40] talking to his disciples he's trying to
[35:41] tell them I'm going to be delivered unto
[35:44] man this is after Mighty Miracles and
[35:45] he's letting him know I I evil men are
[35:49] going to to take me and you're going to
[35:51] see them uh if it enforce their will
[35:54] upon me and and Jesus knowing the hour
[35:58] that had been that had come he had been
[35:59] on Mount Transfiguration the disciples
[36:02] had seen him uh radiate with the glory
[36:06] of God and now he's coming to a place
[36:08] where he set his face to Jerusalem and
[36:13] it is a very deliberate look it's a very
[36:16] specific focus and he he's so uh focused
[36:20] on going to Jerusalem that when he came
[36:22] to a village in Samaria if you read it
[36:25] if you just follow along and it they did
[36:29] not receive him in verse 52 and he sent
[36:31] Messengers before his face and they went
[36:33] and entered into the village of the
[36:35] Samaritans to make ready for him and
[36:39] they the scripture would say that even
[36:42] though he was coming by their way they
[36:44] didn't make ready for him they didn't
[36:46] receive him because it was the the
[36:48] effect of his face being so focused in
[36:51] the intent of of his heart being made
[36:53] known that he's not going to T he's
[36:55] going to Jerusalem they didn't receive
[36:57] them and I find that uh is the
[37:01] inspiration that that strikes me is when
[37:03] people understand what your focus is
[37:06] that's where the separation takes place
[37:08] and it you got to have a singularity in
[37:11] heart you have to be there has to be
[37:13] something that binds our hearts together
[37:15] in love there has to be something that
[37:18] makes that effectual and I would say
[37:20] that it's Jerusalem it's that we are the
[37:24] body of Christ it's that there is a
[37:26] place where Mercy is found there's a a
[37:29] place where judgment is met out there is
[37:31] there is a a focus of our affection and
[37:35] just as Christ would represent that in
[37:37] the way he would turn his face to
[37:39] Jerusalem he's been given to us as an
[37:41] example as we would just uh follow along
[37:44] I think we'll see that if you turn in
[37:46] Hebrews I'm glad they got the screens
[37:47] working I hope you could read this with
[37:49] me uh Hebrews chapter 12 verses 2 and 3
[37:53] I I'm take I want to do the reading from
[37:56] the Amplified verse version uh and you
[38:00] can follow along in the King James
[38:02] version and I I do believe we have the
[38:04] ability if not um I'll read it to you in
[38:06] the way the Amplified presents it uh
[38:09] looking away from all that will distract
[38:13] to Jesus who is the leader and the
[38:16] source of our faith giving the first
[38:18] incentive for our belief and it is also
[38:21] the finisher bringing to maturity and to
[38:24] Perfection he for the joy of obtaining
[38:27] the prize that was set before him
[38:30] endured the cross despising and ignoring
[38:34] the shame and is now Seated on the right
[38:37] hand of the Throne of God the with
[38:41] anything that is going to be deliberate
[38:42] with anything that's going to be a focus
[38:44] there's going to be a distraction
[38:46] there's got to be something that is
[38:48] going to come and Buffet you that's
[38:50] going to come against you and try to
[38:52] take your distraction it's and be a
[38:54] distraction and take your focus from the
[38:56] main thing
[38:58] and and and you think about how much of
[39:01] this really this isn't trivial the shame
[39:05] that he bore the things that would be
[39:08] there that would seem to be the what
[39:10] would be deserving and especially in our
[39:13] hierarchy of needs would deserve the the
[39:15] greatest care and focus he's Jesus
[39:18] Christ is Now setting those seeks aside
[39:22] because you are on his mind he
[39:25] understands that there has to be some a
[39:26] pride that has to be obtained and the
[39:29] and the and that is what is compelling
[39:32] him through this
[39:34] hour through this travail and the
[39:38] scriptures admonishing you just as
[39:40] Christ could do that that is the same
[39:43] thing that allows you to overcome in
[39:45] your hour is to have a Clear Vision to
[39:48] have an understanding of what you're
[39:49] contending for and the devil would tell
[39:52] you and I believe it was in Pilgrim's
[39:54] Progress there was a I I forget the
[39:56] guy's name but one of his primary
[39:58] tactics was to tell him there is no
[40:00] Celestial City there's no prize and
[40:02] there's no hell just just
[40:05] relax nothing's at stake here nothing's
[40:08] critical just take your time
[40:11] everything's going to be okay uh there's
[40:13] another hour uh this is more important
[40:16] uh the things of the Earth are more
[40:17] critical I'm telling you uh you really
[40:20] need to figure out this but if your
[40:22] affections are set upon the Heavenly if
[40:25] you've if you know what the Heavenly
[40:26] prize is is that nothing can distract
[40:30] you from
[40:31] that and and that actually becomes the
[40:33] critical piece here you have to know
[40:36] it's real and and as long as you don't
[40:39] know it's real you can be held between
[40:41] two opinions if you're if you're failing
[40:43] to
[40:44] overcome there is a reality where Jesus
[40:47] Christ can become real to you and that
[40:50] prize becomes
[40:52] tangible and and I would say if if you
[40:55] find yourself not over me there's a
[40:58] greater revelation of Jesus Christ that
[41:00] you can have the prize that's set before
[41:02] you and that will give you such a love
[41:05] for
[41:06] him that it can give over it imparts an
[41:09] overcoming
[41:10] power uh just continuing to read in
[41:14] verse three just think of him who
[41:16] endured from Sinners such Grievous
[41:18] opposition and bitter hostility against
[41:21] himself reckon upon and consider all in
[41:25] comparison with your trials so that you
[41:28] may not grow weary or exhausted losing
[41:31] heart and relaxing and figing in your
[41:34] minds you know you have a spirit we
[41:36] would say our minds brother Brandon
[41:38] would give us a glimpse into the spirit
[41:40] each of you have brought an atmosphere
[41:42] you've brought a spirit even though you
[41:44] have a soul there is an atmosphere that
[41:46] you're walking in your spirit and it is
[41:49] impacted by the things that are around
[41:51] you and sometimes it's in the singing
[41:54] it's in the songs it's through a
[41:55] testimony it's through a burden it's
[41:57] through a need that we get impacted in
[41:59] our Spirits we can we can catch the
[42:01] burden of somebody in the body and that
[42:04] causes a paradigm it causes a shift
[42:06] we're no longer looking at ourselves
[42:08] we're no longer looking at our needs but
[42:10] we're minded for the
[42:12] body that's the greatest atmosphere
[42:15] changer is when you recognize what's at
[42:17] stake for the body of Jesus Christ your
[42:20] attitude
[42:21] matters how you came in
[42:24] mattered what you're focusing on what
[42:26] you're thought is what your heart's
[42:28] meditation is where your mind is at it
[42:34] matters it and where your heart is where
[42:36] your mind is that's where your treasur
[42:38] is at what what are the things that
[42:40] we're
[42:41] treasuring where is our where is our
[42:43] minds
[42:46] at and there should be you know when you
[42:49] when you go to
[42:51] communion it says discern the
[42:54] body many are weak and sickly money
[42:56] among you not Discerning the Lord's body
[42:59] when we come together to commune at his
[43:01] table when we come to sit in the
[43:03] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when we
[43:06] come to Feast on the things of God we
[43:08] should be Discerning the needs of the
[43:10] body there should be a pull there should
[43:12] be a desire there should be Lord pass by
[43:14] my way Lord I know that someone needs a
[43:17] touch from you I need you real
[43:20] now and that
[43:23] is the
[43:25] greatest atmosphere changers that there
[43:28] is the most powerful weapons is the love
[43:31] that you can have for the
[43:33] body first Peter chap 2 veres
[43:38] 1-6 would read wherefore laying aside
[43:41] all malice and Gile and hypocrisies and
[43:44] envyings and all evil speaking as
[43:47] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[43:50] the word that ye may grow thereby if so
[43:53] by ye have tasted that the Lord is
[43:55] gracious and I I that strikes
[43:59] me there's a prerequisite here if if
[44:03] these things are not happening if you're
[44:05] not laying aside the malice or the Gile
[44:08] the hypocrisies the envies and all the
[44:10] evil speaking and you can't become
[44:13] sincere for the milk of God maybe you
[44:15] haven't tasted that the Lord is
[44:18] gracious if so be you've tasted that the
[44:21] Lord great is gracious and and there's a
[44:24] there's Honey in the Rock my brother
[44:27] have you tasted that the Lord is
[44:30] gracious he's wondrous kind and true
[44:33] there's Honey in the Rock my brother
[44:35] there's Honey in the Rock for you there
[44:37] has to be something that says what God's
[44:39] done for me he could do for
[44:41] you and that if without that there is no
[44:46] there is no ability I would tell you
[44:48] there's really just not the ability to
[44:50] set aside the envying The Strife you
[44:52] can't give what you ain't
[44:55] got if you're find finding it hard to
[44:57] overcome and forgive you don't know what
[44:59] it's like to be
[45:02] forgiven I mean we're not playing church
[45:05] or playing religion there is an
[45:07] overcoming power that's
[45:10] real and and the lack of it shows a lack
[45:13] of
[45:15] experience and and we're and we're not
[45:17] there's no delusion here you know when
[45:20] you become disheartened and and and uh
[45:23] the way to break a man's spirit is is to
[45:27] set a a prize or a goal and then tell
[45:29] him he can't obtain
[45:30] it you can't have
[45:33] this and what strikes me about that many
[45:36] years ago I came across the statistic I
[45:38] don't know exactly what it was but it
[45:40] caused me to ponder and the numbers
[45:42] would convey that that suicide rates
[45:45] amongst Native American Youth and uh
[45:48] Native alaskans are the highest of any
[45:51] demographic for
[45:52] teenagers in the hundreds of a
[45:55] percentiles in certain demographics
[45:58] and it and it struck me I was like why
[46:00] is
[46:00] that and you talk about something that
[46:04] is glorified and and I it's worthy of it
[46:07] the life that they had before we came
[46:10] the Renegade came they had what many
[46:15] long to have
[46:17] freedom they were one with nature the
[46:20] their livelihood just depended on what
[46:22] God gave them and even if they looked it
[46:26] at the things that were visible to him
[46:27] and Seed God in them and worship the
[46:29] creation more than the Creator they in
[46:31] many ways are more contact with God than
[46:33] most people are
[46:35] today
[46:38] and I it struck me that it's like they
[46:42] have a
[46:43] vision something they would want to
[46:47] obtain something they've been told that
[46:49] they are it's who you are it's your
[46:51] culture this is your heritage yet they
[46:55] can't achieve it it's been taken from
[46:58] them what we've done to this country
[47:00] what we've done to the land they'll
[47:01] never go chase the
[47:04] Buffalo everything that they have an
[47:06] identity that they that the world would
[47:08] tell them they are they can only do in
[47:11] mooms and semblances but they never
[47:13] could achieve the
[47:15] dream and to me that's why there's such
[47:18] a
[47:20] delusion
[47:22] but when we look at the phrase next year
[47:25] Jerusalem
[47:27] there's something that there's another
[47:28] group of people that are longing for
[47:33] something this phrase is not one you'll
[47:35] find I believe in the in the Torah or in
[47:38] the in the in the Bible but it's a it's
[47:41] a phrase that's common amongst the Jews
[47:44] they say it every year at yon Kapur a
[47:46] couple of times at different feast and
[47:50] they say next year
[47:51] Jerusalem and now that they're in
[47:53] Jerusalem they say next year Jerusalem
[47:55] rebuilt because there's a vision of
[47:58] atonement there's a vision of
[48:00] reconciliation there's a vision of
[48:02] redemption they believe that one year
[48:04] that Temple is going to be
[48:06] rebuilt so this is a people that if you
[48:08] look uh there's something that has met
[48:11] their hearts together there's something
[48:12] that gives them a singleness and that's
[48:14] what they have in common is Jerusalem
[48:18] now if we could catch that I it it
[48:22] should help us because we are now in in
[48:30] Jerusalem just uh bear with me I had a
[48:33] scripture and it it I believe it's
[48:38] uh Hebrews 12:
[48:41] 22 says but ye are come into Mount Si
[48:44] and unto the city of the Living God the
[48:47] heavenly Jerusalem and to an inumerable
[48:50] company of
[48:53] angels so the prize
[48:57] that we now have is we have been
[49:00] ministered and entrance into Jerusalem
[49:03] this is not something that's not
[49:04] obtainable but you're being told now
[49:07] you're already in an inumerable company
[49:09] of angels it kind of reminds me of Elias
[49:12] when when he Elijah when he's sitting
[49:14] there and the the Syrian King is is
[49:16] worried that there's one that knows the
[49:18] very secrets and the intents of the
[49:20] heart and it and I believe it was
[49:21] brother Billy said it the other day one
[49:23] with God is a
[49:25] majority cuz when God's on your side
[49:28] you're with an innumerable company of
[49:31] angels and and God even said your
[49:34] enemies will be my enemies so there's a
[49:37] faith and there's a vision there has to
[49:39] be an understanding that you are the
[49:41] elect of God that you have been called
[49:43] into a holy Jerusalem that you are a
[49:45] people fitly joined together bound
[49:47] together in love and that election that
[49:50] placing that that deliberate thought
[49:52] that God had of you is a
[49:55] strength that's right that is a who God
[49:58] is
[49:59] for that is a declaration of who you are
[50:03] and and and that's faith in who you are
[50:06] and what's the what's the
[50:08] distraction what's the delusion that
[50:11] something else defines you besides God's
[50:14] election that's the only thing that
[50:16] defines you that's the I you start to
[50:18] meditate upon God's Sovereign Grace in
[50:21] your life you can truly say whatever
[50:24] state I'm in I'm content as long as I
[50:26] know God's with me take this world take
[50:28] the Treasures of the world the greatest
[50:30] treasure I have is knowing him in the
[50:32] power of his resurrection and the and
[50:35] Satan didn't give it and he can't take
[50:37] it
[50:38] away the greatest treasure that you
[50:40] could have is knowing Jesus Christ and
[50:43] the question is do you know
[50:46] him and if you know
[50:48] him everything else is a distraction you
[50:52] can encourage your heart back in the
[50:54] Lord I know my redeemer lives I have a
[50:58] revelation of who he is I've
[51:01] tasted I can put away all these things
[51:04] you the delusion is saying I can't come
[51:06] on I've tasted of that which is good I
[51:10] know what is
[51:13] mine it's
[51:15] real his love is real his pardoning
[51:19] grace is real the love that can forgive
[51:22] me can forgive others how can I hold not
[51:25] again what's the first
[51:29] reaction and if it's not that love it's
[51:32] a distraction it's a delusion it's going
[51:36] to pass you forgot what kingdom you're
[51:42] of we had a
[51:45] prophet delivered to us a very tangible
[51:48] Heavenly prize he stepped beyond the
[51:50] curtain of time and started to describe
[51:52] what it was like these things are
[51:55] necessary
[51:56] it because it captures you it should be
[51:58] set in your heart just as there would be
[52:01] a people who would have their heart set
[52:03] for the revelation of Jesus Christ for
[52:05] the revealing of the son of man for the
[52:07] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[52:09] they could be laboring and understanding
[52:11] and Earnest and we should be if you
[52:13] don't have that expectation if you don't
[52:15] have that Vision if you don't have that
[52:16] hope he can't reveal himself to
[52:20] you you're not looking for
[52:23] him and what are you looking for I I and
[52:26] I know that I'm I'm reminding you you
[52:28] are not looking for this
[52:31] world that is not what our heavenly
[52:34] vision and where we've heard from is not
[52:36] this world but it we have a a an enemy
[52:40] that is always in the pattern is that he
[52:43] is going to point you to Earthly things
[52:45] things that are very personable things
[52:47] that are very dear things that impact
[52:49] you physically emotionally they come to
[52:51] you in your five senses they come to you
[52:53] in your emotional sphere and they try to
[52:55] testify that there's a greater reality
[52:58] than the in Eternal things of
[53:01] God and you have to cast down those
[53:05] things and the way that you do that is
[53:07] you remind yourself of the promise that
[53:10] he's made you and that your faith in
[53:13] that promise is dependent on
[53:16] Revelation he's got to reveal it to you
[53:19] that it's real he's got to reveal it to
[53:21] you that it's for you and that the holy
[53:24] spirit is job is to brood out over the
[53:28] word to bring it to pass that's the
[53:30] pattern so you hear things you hear the
[53:32] promise of God you hear the word of God
[53:34] it Pricks your heart there's an answer
[53:35] in your heart that says that's the truth
[53:38] and you want the anointing of the Holy
[53:40] Ghost to come by and Quicken the seed
[53:42] that's
[53:43] there and we don't have another
[53:46] formula it's not I'm going to study
[53:49] myself into it it's it we there's not a
[53:53] persuasion though as sound and as
[53:55] academic and if you can observe it
[53:57] through the five senses I'm telling you
[53:59] you're resting on the wrong
[54:01] thing if you've if you've talked
[54:03] yourself into it and you need a greater
[54:06] explanation and if you could just
[54:09] intellectually come up with this is well
[54:12] this is just infath themable that all
[54:14] the scripture could align and say this
[54:16] exact thing and it hasn't been quickened
[54:18] by the Holy Ghost it's dead
[54:23] letter there's probably a more persu an
[54:26] argument out there that you're going to
[54:28] find eventually anyways and you're going
[54:29] to forsake your first love in the
[54:32] truth matter of fact it's just not in
[54:35] you to believe
[54:37] it
[54:39] um but we'll get
[54:43] there all
[54:47] right if we haven't read this it's a
[54:49] good reading even if we read it again 1
[54:51] Peter 3 verse 8 and9 finally be ye all
[54:56] of One mind having compassion one of
[55:00] another love his Brethren be pitiful be
[55:03] courteous not rendering evil for evil or
[55:06] railing for railing but counterwise
[55:08] blessing knowing that ye are there unto
[55:11] called in that ye should inherit a
[55:14] blessing and this uh scripture I think
[55:18] pairs very
[55:21] well with
[55:23] a and brother Brandon would tell the
[55:25] story
[55:26] of the young couple that was in his
[55:28] meetings and they were doing a lot of
[55:30] Acts that were uh distracting I believe
[55:34] that's the way he would uh in
[55:37] 59123 in paragraph
[55:40] 86 so you know the backdrop they're
[55:43] there they're they're misbehaving and
[55:45] brother brandom
[55:46] says young man don't do that you're
[55:49] attracting the attention while I'm
[55:51] preaching now the this is a tactic that
[55:56] the the devil does he wants to attract
[55:59] your
[56:01] attention so as long as he could keep
[56:03] you from focusing on the path forward on
[56:06] the path ahead on what the prize is if
[56:09] he can if he could distract you and get
[56:11] your attention he'll do all manner of
[56:15] things and this is just playing out in
[56:18] in in reality here and he just laughed
[56:22] right out at
[56:24] me and if we skip on down down to
[56:30] 92 and you know brother Brandon
[56:33] basically forgives him he knows that he
[56:35] could speak whatever he wants the Lord
[56:38] says he's in say what you he's in your
[56:40] hands say what you will and brother
[56:41] brandom knew there was a trap that was
[56:43] set before him so the other thing here
[56:46] is is look there's warning than judgment
[56:48] God's word is in your life he's telling
[56:52] you things he's speaking to you he's
[56:54] giving you warnings you know what they
[56:56] are he speak there's an unction there's
[56:58] a holy unction there's something that
[56:59] the word is doing and it's a warning and
[57:02] when these and then when those things
[57:04] come up you're
[57:06] now being
[57:08] tested you're now sitting in the place
[57:11] where you can give the right
[57:13] response and in paragraph 92 said and it
[57:16] was just it must have been just the
[57:18] right thing to say it was God trying a
[57:21] reaction on an action that night it was
[57:25] revealed to me
[57:26] that I had said the right thing and I
[57:29] know it was leading to something but
[57:32] what it was what to
[57:34] do you know you have to watch what a
[57:38] Divine gift what to do with it remember
[57:40] what Moses did so I must have said the
[57:43] right thing I forgive you for you know
[57:46] John Young John wanted to burn up
[57:48] Samaria one time because they wouldn't
[57:50] feed them now I thought that was really
[57:53] insightful because when I read that
[57:54] scripture that Jesus said his face to
[57:56] Jerusalem he went to the town and here's
[57:59] the sons of thunder saying should we
[58:01] throw I wonder if they would have had
[58:03] the faith to call down fire if they
[58:05] weren't
[58:07] hangry but if you want to get something
[58:09] that's a distraction something that's a
[58:11] motive you just get a little
[58:13] hungry that's why I think you measuring
[58:15] up your spirituality fasting maybe
[58:17] that's a call to know that there's a
[58:19] greater Victory to be had this flesh I
[58:21] need to put it into subjection I need to
[58:24] remind it whose boss is
[58:27] I I need to abstain from something to
[58:29] show that there's a life in me there's a
[58:30] spirit in me that's greater I can p i
[58:33] and you have to remind yourself I who's
[58:36] in control is the man in the heart is
[58:38] the spirit that's in you but that that I
[58:42] and brother Brandon I would go in go go
[58:44] listen to speak to the mountain he goes
[58:46] in and he starts to tell the story of
[58:47] the squirrels and so
[58:51] by there is an there's a
[58:54] blessing in having right response you're
[58:58] not going to have a right response
[58:59] unless you understand the prize that's
[59:01] set before you and you're not going to
[59:04] have the right response if you're
[59:06] distracted and you put the emphasis on
[59:09] the wrong
[59:14] thing uh this
[59:18] was just I felt led to read this this is
[59:20] in do you believe in 54 so there's a
[59:23] criticism too that comes there's
[59:25] different things that should cause uh
[59:27] you to realize you're being
[59:29] tested when others are doing evil and
[59:33] people are doing things that you know is
[59:35] wrong if you make that the main
[59:39] thing you've been
[59:41] distracted if the if if we're motivated
[59:44] by the evil if our actions are being
[59:48] predicated out of the things that are
[59:49] being done wrong you're out of the
[59:54] Scripture it it it it's you if
[59:59] anything that response you have a source
[1:00:02] that you're reaching to and it's
[1:00:04] motivating you I'm not saying that that
[1:00:06] isn't the action I'm just saying is if
[1:00:09] that's where you're getting your
[1:00:11] inspiration then you're letting the evil
[1:00:13] inspire you there has to be a source of
[1:00:15] Love there has to be a source of
[1:00:17] strength there has to be something
[1:00:19] Heavenly that you're tapping into so
[1:00:21] you're not just being entirely dictated
[1:00:24] by the evil well the best way to offset
[1:00:27] this is Fight Fire with
[1:00:30] Fire you know you didn't feed me toasty
[1:00:36] Critters I it seems reasonable I mean I
[1:00:39] I sure hope we haven't gotten upset at
[1:00:41] any restaurants over
[1:00:44] food you know you forgot what kingdom
[1:00:47] you're
[1:00:48] of we didn't come to destroy the waiter
[1:00:50] or destroy the
[1:00:52] kitchen destroy that destroy anybody you
[1:00:55] don't need to kill their influence let
[1:00:57] them remind them that they're horrible
[1:00:58] people and they can't get anything right
[1:01:01] you're of a different
[1:01:03] Kingdom uh
[1:01:05] sorry even the Lord Jesus never at any
[1:01:08] time ever performed a miracle or done
[1:01:10] anything without first God showing or
[1:01:12] advising him to do it look at the great
[1:01:15] Prophet Elijah someone come not long ago
[1:01:18] someone and criticizing me in the paper
[1:01:21] and a man that was with me said brother
[1:01:23] brandom I'd go out there and put a curse
[1:01:25] on that paper
[1:01:27] oh brother Jesus said I never come to
[1:01:29] destroy people I come to save people
[1:01:31] they criticize but that's all right that
[1:01:34] don't hurt me that's the best drawing
[1:01:36] card I got that's
[1:01:39] right you think of
[1:01:42] that I get all the publicity
[1:01:46] free we don't have to pay for it for
[1:01:50] what money we'd pay for that we'd take
[1:01:52] it over to the missionaries overseas see
[1:01:55] that don't hurt that's good everybody
[1:01:57] come out to see what all the trouble
[1:01:58] it's about then we get it for free so
[1:02:01] they just do a favor not knowing it see
[1:02:04] so he said we need another Elijah who
[1:02:07] can come out on Mount Carmel and said
[1:02:09] now I dare you to come out here I said
[1:02:11] so think of the test think of the
[1:02:15] authori is with the
[1:02:17] prophet and and he could deliver this
[1:02:22] judgment and he and he says wait a
[1:02:25] minute brother I said elishah never
[1:02:26] waited on no vision only thing he did is
[1:02:29] go out there and do it I said beg your
[1:02:31] pardon brother you're a scholar but
[1:02:34] you're a long ways off the track right
[1:02:36] there so the other
[1:02:39] temptation is to get drawn away with the
[1:02:43] righteous
[1:02:44] indignation to think you're in the
[1:02:47] right and and
[1:02:50] I you're
[1:02:53] off Jesus said I can do nothing myself
[1:02:56] but what I see the father doing I do the
[1:02:58] same thing he showed me is that right St
[1:03:00] John 5:19 said the father worketh I
[1:03:03] worketh hither to in other words always
[1:03:05] in the Supernatural and no flesh can
[1:03:08] glory in the presence of God we're not
[1:03:11] after
[1:03:12] manmade
[1:03:14] things we're after the supernatural
[1:03:17] results of the almighty God we're after
[1:03:21] lives that have been touched and now
[1:03:23] they're salty now they're they're their
[1:03:26] cups overflowing with the goodness of
[1:03:28] God and man just wants cookie
[1:03:33] cutter no rub if we can if we we'll just
[1:03:37] Define what good is and let's all just
[1:03:40] do the best we can to get there and as
[1:03:44] long as there's no offense as long as
[1:03:46] there's no rub they have to set US
[1:03:48] settle for that but we are 100%
[1:03:54] dependent on the supernatural
[1:03:57] we have no other way we have no other
[1:04:00] hope and
[1:04:02] and and and it's because we don't want
[1:04:04] no flesh to Glory I don't want my flesh
[1:04:07] to glory and I and I know there's surely
[1:04:09] I know there's no glory in
[1:04:11] it and that's the that is the
[1:04:14] consolation Saints is that when God does
[1:04:17] something it is so beyond
[1:04:21] you so you're not depending on yourself
[1:04:24] to begin with
[1:04:26] you're out of the
[1:04:28] picture it's it's but for God and you're
[1:04:32] not putting your Hope on anything else
[1:04:34] you're not looking to anything else
[1:04:36] nothing else is your vision it's God I
[1:04:39] need you and nothing else I must have
[1:04:42] the supernatural I'm a supernatural
[1:04:45] people I'm I'm called out supernaturally
[1:04:48] I'm elected I'm separated I'm I'm I'm
[1:04:50] fitly joined together and that election
[1:04:54] is is why I'm called calling out to you
[1:04:56] now remember me for your tender Mercy
[1:05:00] sake no other hope so no men don't see
[1:05:04] Visions some goes by inspiration of
[1:05:06] present of of of
[1:05:09] presentment I you know what there's a
[1:05:11] lot of Grace in that some goes by
[1:05:13] inspiration of
[1:05:15] presentment you know delivery
[1:05:19] matters I you know I I understand that I
[1:05:22] could come out here and be very
[1:05:23] dry and be like
[1:05:26] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:05:28] and
[1:05:29] forever he died for you and that word's
[1:05:31] just as
[1:05:33] powerful but presentment does
[1:05:37] matter some people receive inspiration
[1:05:41] by
[1:05:42] presentment and don't speak against Holy
[1:05:45] Ghost
[1:05:48] presentment we're not all the same but
[1:05:51] we're fit Stones fitly joined together
[1:05:55] and some can understand and perceive
[1:05:57] things very slow and it drop a seat of
[1:06:00] faith and some people need to be
[1:06:04] told wake
[1:06:08] up but let it be the Holy Ghost am
[1:06:13] inspired not a work
[1:06:16] up and then that Supernatural
[1:06:20] effect God gets the glory no flesh is
[1:06:23] gloring in that because things are done
[1:06:25] that man cannot do yes sir you know what
[1:06:28] I I'll back up let's read in
[1:06:35] Luke
[1:06:37] uh
[1:06:39] 49 chapter n verse 49 and John answered
[1:06:43] and said Master we saw one casting out
[1:06:46] devils in thy name and we forbad him
[1:06:50] because he followeth not with us
[1:06:56] and Jesus said unto him forbid him not
[1:06:59] for he that is not against us is for
[1:07:04] us and I understand that there's people
[1:07:06] who are against the truth and as soon as
[1:07:08] they make a stand against the truth
[1:07:09] that's not what I'm talking
[1:07:11] about but if if if someone's Ox is
[1:07:16] loosed if the blinded eyes are
[1:07:19] opened if if something is done that man
[1:07:23] cannot do
[1:07:26] and there's something in you that
[1:07:30] says that's just an emotional work
[1:07:33] up you forgot what kingdom you're of and
[1:07:38] it there's a get behind me Satan thing
[1:07:40] that we all can face we have to do the
[1:07:42] checkup ourselves you know that those
[1:07:44] things little if we're talking about a
[1:07:46] body being fitly joined together that
[1:07:48] doesn't
[1:07:49] fit that does not provoke love for one
[1:07:51] another how could you even think that
[1:07:53] way how could that even be you know you
[1:07:56] talk about without dissimilation could
[1:07:58] there be such an envy that you would
[1:08:01] rather you did it instead of someone
[1:08:03] else you know like somehow it's
[1:08:05] you like where's the Mind gone to not be
[1:08:10] rejoicing in the things of God whether
[1:08:12] it's at the Baptist Church whether it's
[1:08:15] wherever there's got to be an
[1:08:18] understanding that God is
[1:08:21] God and and there's Antichrist Spirits
[1:08:25] have gone into the world to to bind and
[1:08:29] to deceive and to rob people of
[1:08:32] Salvation and we've been it's been
[1:08:34] exposed in this day and you
[1:08:37] cannot tell me that you you can't be
[1:08:40] saved by a
[1:08:41] lie you can't be saved you know that
[1:08:46] brother Dylan shared the quote and it
[1:08:48] really struck me I know people could
[1:08:49] hear quotes different ways but there the
[1:08:52] young man we even heard it recently
[1:08:54] where he had received Jesus Christ when
[1:08:56] he read a pamphlet Faith had been
[1:08:58] quickened but the but Antichrist spirit
[1:09:02] that had gone in the world false Christ
[1:09:04] have come and tried to say your
[1:09:05] salvation is based on this your
[1:09:07] salvation's based on this your salvation
[1:09:09] is based on this instead of that gift of
[1:09:11] faith that God gave him to believe that
[1:09:14] a a distraction had come to bind the
[1:09:18] people and what we have in this day is a
[1:09:21] Clear Vision that peels back all the
[1:09:24] distractions that tells you why you're
[1:09:26] saved and the basis of your salvation
[1:09:29] that you were with them in the very
[1:09:30] beginning there's a race that we can run
[1:09:33] now with this gospel and a destination
[1:09:35] that we can achieve that's been made
[1:09:37] tangible that no other age has been have
[1:09:40] has been given our prize is Rapture our
[1:09:44] prize is a body
[1:09:52] change Philippians 3:14 says I press
[1:09:57] towards the goal to win the Supreme and
[1:09:59] Heavenly prize to which God Christ Jesus
[1:10:02] is calling us for I press towards the
[1:10:05] mark of the prize of the High Calling of
[1:10:08] God in Christ
[1:10:10] Jesus there's there's a prize in Christ
[1:10:14] Jesus if there's going to be a pressing
[1:10:15] if there's going to be a contending
[1:10:17] there has to be a
[1:10:20] preoccupation a
[1:10:23] complete Focus
[1:10:27] on what you're contending
[1:10:29] for Colossians 3 1 and2 if ye be risen
[1:10:33] with Christ seek those things which are
[1:10:36] above where Christ sth at the right hand
[1:10:38] of God set your affections on things
[1:10:40] above not on things on the
[1:10:44] earth the admonishment that you're going
[1:10:47] to find very consistently is you're a
[1:10:48] pilgrim you're a stranger you're seeking
[1:10:50] a city whose Builder and maker is God
[1:10:53] and if if we've become entangled with
[1:10:55] the cares of the world we need to renew
[1:10:57] our
[1:10:58] vision and or capture
[1:11:04] one
[1:11:05] and unless God gives you that and and
[1:11:09] I'm telling you what you're contending
[1:11:11] for if you do not have it you want a
[1:11:14] revelation of who Jesus Christ is and
[1:11:16] what the prize is because without it
[1:11:18] you're not fighting the Warfare the way
[1:11:21] it has to be fought you must be born
[1:11:23] again you must have a revelation of
[1:11:26] Jesus Christ you must have an
[1:11:28] understanding that eternal life is more
[1:11:30] real than this temporal thing and when
[1:11:33] you taste of it you know it's the most
[1:11:35] real thing that you've ever experienced
[1:11:36] in your
[1:11:38] life it becomes a
[1:11:40] reality I have heard but now I see 651
[1:11:45] 1127 paragraph 1 87 now it's begin to
[1:11:50] pull away the Wheats begin to to be seen
[1:11:54] this is not a pentec costal age this is
[1:11:56] the latter age this is the bride age
[1:11:59] this is the evening light this is
[1:12:00] Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow
[1:12:03] God's pattern this is Luke 17:30 to be
[1:12:06] fulfilled this is the
[1:12:09] second and Jeremiah and all the rest of
[1:12:12] them that Joel had spoken of these days
[1:12:15] that is that day I have heard Lord and
[1:12:18] it was coming but now I see it with my
[1:12:23] eye there is something that's re that
[1:12:27] the revelation of what God does in this
[1:12:29] day imparts a heavenly vision that
[1:12:31] allows you to press to the
[1:12:39] prize other you're otherwise you're
[1:12:41] living in the glare of another
[1:12:49] day here's the distraction though many
[1:12:52] how many impersonators rise them Jans
[1:12:54] and J ambers with all the gimmicks to do
[1:12:57] everything that Moses did never shook
[1:12:59] him or Aaron at all they knowed where
[1:13:01] like job they knowed who their
[1:13:03] inspiration come from they knowed it was
[1:13:06] thus sayeth the Lord and the same Bible
[1:13:08] that spoke of them said they'd come in
[1:13:10] the last day
[1:13:12] impersonators you've been told there's
[1:13:14] impersonators those religious
[1:13:16] denominations when something started who
[1:13:18] started first Moses or them your
[1:13:21] pedigree is the true Pentecost
[1:13:27] who started first all
[1:13:31] right religious denominations them
[1:13:33] started who started first Moses or them
[1:13:35] if you had started first Moses would
[1:13:37] have been the mimic now we got all kinds
[1:13:41] of discerners and everything else that's
[1:13:43] trying to throw your mind from the
[1:13:46] genuine thing of
[1:13:50] God I and I believe I God imp pressed
[1:13:54] this on my heart I absolutely believe
[1:13:56] that there's those who are doing battle
[1:13:58] where Satan is trying to throw your mind
[1:14:01] from the genuine thing of
[1:14:06] God which God has proven to be the truth
[1:14:09] by his scripture we've heard all of it
[1:14:12] with our ears now we see it with our
[1:14:14] eyes amen do you believe it all our
[1:14:16] hearts inspiration and in the day when
[1:14:19] the son of man is being revealed a son
[1:14:21] of man Jesus Christ made manifest
[1:14:24] amongst his people
[1:14:25] people there has to be a desire to see
[1:14:30] them there has to be such a
[1:14:33] longing is is there some delusion that's
[1:14:36] caused your love to be for the world or
[1:14:37] the things of the world or is there a
[1:14:39] heartbeat to see God moveing his power
[1:14:42] and his grace and His
[1:14:43] glory that even on a Wednesday night he
[1:14:46] could have his way and do the things
[1:14:48] that are beyond what we could imagine or
[1:14:51] think because one touch from him changes
[1:14:54] everything
[1:14:56] everything
[1:14:58] everything and one heart that sides with
[1:15:02] God becomes a host of
[1:15:04] angels one sincerity one move where God
[1:15:07] gets a hold of someone they get locked
[1:15:10] in and everything else Fades
[1:15:14] away that's where there's a
[1:15:17] majority and a man walked down there
[1:15:19] Abraham in a group just an ordinary
[1:15:21] looking man dust on his clothes he had
[1:15:23] his back turned to the tent he said
[1:15:24] where is is thy wife Sarah not s a a r r
[1:15:27] a but s a r a and Abraham a r a a m not
[1:15:32] a r a am called his name and said where
[1:15:35] is she and I said she's in the tent
[1:15:37] behind you or pardon me said she's in
[1:15:40] the tent behind
[1:15:41] you I'm going to visit you according to
[1:15:44] the time of life and she laughed up her
[1:15:46] sleeves said why did she laugh uhhuh now
[1:15:49] he promised them people was the ones
[1:15:51] that was looking for a promised son
[1:15:55] now I don't care how much the people act
[1:15:57] in these denominations that they're
[1:15:59] looking for Christ their actions prove
[1:16:00] they're not that's right your action
[1:16:02] speaks louder than your words all you
[1:16:04] thinking about is making denominational
[1:16:06] members but there are some people one
[1:16:09] here and one there that's looking for
[1:16:11] the coming of the lord they're watching
[1:16:14] only those will he reveal himself to
[1:16:17] only those will
[1:16:19] understand just the elected
[1:16:22] understood who he was just think there's
[1:16:25] maybe three million Jews on the earth
[1:16:27] there wasn't onethird of them ever
[1:16:28] knowed who he was till he was done come
[1:16:30] and gone but he revealed himself to
[1:16:32] those who were waiting John the Baptist
[1:16:34] and the apostles that had been called by
[1:16:36] John and so forth and blind Anna at the
[1:16:37] temple Simeon the priest that was
[1:16:39] revealed to him by the holy ghost that
[1:16:41] he was going to see the Christ all of
[1:16:43] those great religious theologians and
[1:16:45] things blind as they could be there's
[1:16:48] only one way to see him Saints and
[1:16:49] that's by
[1:16:50] Revelation the same light that you see
[1:16:53] by is going to Blind others and you
[1:16:55] can't be distracted by that you cannot
[1:16:57] be distracted by the blind you cannot be
[1:17:00] distracted by the hypocrite you cannot
[1:17:02] be distracted by those who have a form
[1:17:04] of godliness but deny the power thereof
[1:17:07] you have to have your heart set
[1:17:10] firmly and only can I now only the
[1:17:14] elected understood just think there's
[1:17:16] about maybe three million Jews on the
[1:17:17] earth there's onethird of them ever
[1:17:19] knowed who he was till he was come gone
[1:17:21] come and gone but he revealed himself to
[1:17:23] those who were waiting John the Baptist
[1:17:25] and the apostles that have been called
[1:17:26] by John and so forth and I that's the
[1:17:29] progression of the
[1:17:31] Gospel okay so there was a light that
[1:17:34] John was walking in and there was those
[1:17:36] who followed him but you want to prove
[1:17:37] who who that when the present light is
[1:17:40] made known once the light is revealed to
[1:17:44] refuse to walk in the light exposes your
[1:17:47] Darkness so in even though that they'd
[1:17:50] received the truth even though someone
[1:17:52] may receive the the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:54] there is a a there's a a desire for
[1:17:57] Freedom there's a desire for the truth
[1:18:00] there's such a looking for Christ that
[1:18:01] cannot be satisfied by everything else
[1:18:04] that it's going to cause a separation
[1:18:07] that's
[1:18:09] right even the scripture says they went
[1:18:11] out from us because they weren't of
[1:18:14] us separation is God's business we don't
[1:18:18] do it we draw the circle bigger okay you
[1:18:20] draw in God will do the separating you
[1:18:23] give people the benefit the doubt God
[1:18:25] will do the separating they will not be
[1:18:27] able to help but manifest what seed they
[1:18:30] are and that that's what what we're
[1:18:32] trying to get to I'm just going to go to
[1:18:34] it uh
[1:18:36] verse
[1:18:38] 195 only can the rain raise the seed if
[1:18:42] the seed's already there and it has in
[1:18:45] and you was a germ first in your father
[1:18:47] and he knowed you yet you were in your
[1:18:50] father but through the beding ground of
[1:18:52] your mother you were made manifest in
[1:18:54] his likeness and then he could talk to
[1:18:58] you oh my Saints Understanding God's
[1:19:02] three-fold purpose that he wanted to
[1:19:04] fellowship with you and and that's
[1:19:07] what if I could say it he had such an
[1:19:10] Earnest desire for you when he set his
[1:19:12] eyes to Jerusalem if I could just convey
[1:19:15] to you what that means to me here he is
[1:19:19] he knows the crosses before him but he's
[1:19:23] looking at a bride
[1:19:26] and in the Book of Revelations it would
[1:19:27] talk about the city of Jerusalem coming
[1:19:29] down adorned as a city as a as a bride
[1:19:32] for a
[1:19:33] husband you're the prize that he set his
[1:19:36] eyes
[1:19:38] upon are you are you catching his
[1:19:41] glaze are you looking him in the
[1:19:44] eye where are you
[1:19:47] looking and that's my heart the way he's
[1:19:52] speaking to me Lord I don't want my eyes
[1:19:55] on anything else but that to see you if
[1:19:58] I could see the love expression in his
[1:20:00] eyes
[1:20:01] Saints if I could see the love that he
[1:20:04] loved me that drove him to Calvary that
[1:20:06] would cause him to Bear the cross that
[1:20:09] is the very thing that gives me the
[1:20:11] overcoming
[1:20:12] power the the ability to love him and
[1:20:15] forsake everything
[1:20:18] else but there has to be a seed in there
[1:20:21] crying for it and he put that in you
[1:20:25] so Sovereign such
[1:20:29] Grace he ordained you to see
[1:20:35] it the great God if you got eternal life
[1:20:38] then the germ of eternal life was in God
[1:20:40] at the beginning and you were there you
[1:20:44] were in his thinking your name in all
[1:20:47] and he by forn knowledge ordained you to
[1:20:49] see this and you that was not ordained
[1:20:53] will never see it but remember in the
[1:20:56] name of the Lord Jesus the hour is here
[1:20:59] won't you believe
[1:21:01] him it hurts that there's those that
[1:21:03] don't see it but if you're distracted by
[1:21:06] that if that becomes your focus is to
[1:21:10] try to convince those who can't see
[1:21:14] it you got to get your eyes focused back
[1:21:17] on
[1:21:18] him we're not apologist we're not there
[1:21:22] you present the gospel you you present
[1:21:25] the truth of what God has done in this
[1:21:27] day and it that's where the separation
[1:21:30] comes in if you really have that in your
[1:21:34] heart and that's the way your face is
[1:21:35] set just like that's what caused them to
[1:21:38] not feed Jesus that's what causes people
[1:21:40] to reject you is when they recognize
[1:21:43] that there is a you you're about
[1:21:45] something different you have a different
[1:21:51] focus and if if if that is not what
[1:21:54] we're showing in our life then then what
[1:21:59] of those who need the
[1:22:01] hope if you're showing them this world
[1:22:04] is worth being distracted
[1:22:06] by and someone's looking to
[1:22:10] you and there's something in your life
[1:22:13] that
[1:22:14] just doesn't show your sold out doesn't
[1:22:18] testify that there's something else
[1:22:19] worth living
[1:22:21] for
[1:22:22] isn't isn't to to the place it's not
[1:22:25] going to
[1:22:27] compromise then you you're the
[1:22:32] there's there's someone who's
[1:22:35] hungry
[1:22:42] um you know one of the the
[1:22:45] thoughts that came to
[1:22:49] me and I wanted
[1:22:51] to read it because it seems to fit
[1:22:55] but remember that there was a there's a
[1:22:57] call for judgment and Jesus's response
[1:23:00] to them is is you do not know what
[1:23:02] kingdom you're of that the son of man
[1:23:06] has come to
[1:23:07] save and you have to
[1:23:10] recognize that you're a part of
[1:23:15] that you're the bride there's a place
[1:23:19] where Grace is found it's very
[1:23:21] scripturally sound that the place of
[1:23:24] Mercy mercy and where the The Mercy Seat
[1:23:27] is is where Christ Jesus is and Christ
[1:23:29] Jesus and his bride in this day is one
[1:23:31] and if there's any place of Mercy if
[1:23:33] there's any place of Grace when the
[1:23:35] capstone's coming down it's Grace Grace
[1:23:37] Grace there the the place where Grace is
[1:23:40] found is the Bride of Jesus
[1:23:43] Christ that's the place of Mercy that's
[1:23:45] where grace and mercy is is met out the
[1:23:49] very words that you speak the very
[1:23:51] response that you have to situations I
[1:23:54] forgive you what was meant for evil God
[1:23:57] could work for you're you're you're
[1:23:59] incurring an
[1:24:01] inheritance you're you are and and we're
[1:24:04] not Kingdom Builders anytime you w look
[1:24:06] at someone who kills the influence of
[1:24:08] another especially when they're trying
[1:24:09] to help the children of
[1:24:12] God they're striving for the wrong
[1:24:15] Kingdom they've lost their
[1:24:18] Vision I it's it's it's not congruent
[1:24:22] with scripture Jesus would even say
[1:24:25] don't pull up the tears cuz you'll pull
[1:24:26] up the wheed also there's no place that
[1:24:29] you're going to find it it it is
[1:24:31] basically Let It Go to judgment let God
[1:24:33] sort it out if it even the words of Gia
[1:24:37] if it's lest we strive against God
[1:24:40] there's just no not railing for railing
[1:24:43] and I'll tell you where it's most this
[1:24:45] message that was put on display didn't
[1:24:48] do
[1:24:52] it in 1 Samuel
[1:24:55] Chapter 30 if we have a little time
[1:24:58] we'll finish
[1:25:01] up this is
[1:25:03] David there he he
[1:25:06] was his he was at a place of distress
[1:25:10] the people had sought to Stone
[1:25:12] him the things that were his and the
[1:25:15] things that were precious were taken he
[1:25:16] had he had two wives I believe that were
[1:25:19] taken and
[1:25:22] now I he says bring me the the ephod and
[1:25:26] he prays and goes before the Lord and
[1:25:27] the Lord gives him a
[1:25:29] word David says can I pursue him can I
[1:25:32] overtake him can I get that back with
[1:25:33] that which is
[1:25:35] mine and there has to
[1:25:38] be such a
[1:25:40] distress to want to obtain the things
[1:25:43] that are
[1:25:44] ours the things that are mine whether
[1:25:46] it's loved ones our lost the loved ones
[1:25:48] that we have and we cannot be content
[1:25:52] and there was a prophetic word that he
[1:25:54] receives and the and the and the Lord
[1:25:56] tells him you'll surely overtake them
[1:25:58] and on the way they they come across the
[1:26:00] young man they they they uh revive them
[1:26:03] they give them what he has need of and
[1:26:05] and they're like show us where they went
[1:26:08] he says we've while we were I was with
[1:26:11] my my master and he he abandoned me he
[1:26:14] threw me on the road and um left me for
[1:26:17] dead because I got sick but I can tell
[1:26:20] you that what they did is they they they
[1:26:22] had great spoil they plundered many
[1:26:24] people people they they took great
[1:26:25] riches and and some of those were David
[1:26:28] David's and he and this is as our Pastor
[1:26:32] said there has to be a vision now they
[1:26:34] want this young man to tell them where
[1:26:37] they came from here's this marauding
[1:26:39] Army where did they come from and he
[1:26:41] even has to have a vision why am I going
[1:26:43] to tell you this thing he says promise
[1:26:45] me you won't kill
[1:26:47] me but you'll nor turn me over to my
[1:26:50] master and I'll tell you where they went
[1:26:54] so through that David they pursue him
[1:26:56] they overtake him and David has a great
[1:26:58] Victory but on his way there was those
[1:27:00] who were too weary to cross over the
[1:27:04] river they it's not that they didn't
[1:27:07] have things to get
[1:27:08] back but they couldn't get they
[1:27:13] failed their ability to get back which
[1:27:17] what was theirs failed
[1:27:19] them and David Goes
[1:27:22] On he leaves them behind people ones
[1:27:27] that they just didn't have the
[1:27:32] ability and that's it that where I'll
[1:27:34] pick up in verse 21 of 30 says and David
[1:27:38] came to 200 men which were faint that
[1:27:42] they could not follow David who they had
[1:27:45] made also to abide at the brook of basor
[1:27:49] and they went forth to meet
[1:27:52] David and to meet the people that were
[1:27:55] with him so this is David now returning
[1:27:57] from the
[1:27:59] spoils and when they came near the
[1:28:01] people he saluted
[1:28:06] them then answered all the wicked men
[1:28:09] and the men of balal of those that went
[1:28:12] with David and said because they went
[1:28:15] not with us we will not give them ought
[1:28:18] of the spoil that we have recovered
[1:28:24] that's the
[1:28:25] spirit of someone who doesn't want to
[1:28:27] share the good things of God as if
[1:28:30] they're the ones who've obtained
[1:28:38] it we will not give them ought of the
[1:28:41] spoil that we have recovered save to
[1:28:44] every man his wife and his child that
[1:28:46] they may lead them away and
[1:28:48] depart we'll give them their wife and
[1:28:50] their children
[1:28:56] then said David ye shall not do so my
[1:29:00] brethren with that which the Lord hath
[1:29:02] given us who hath preserved us and
[1:29:06] delivered the company that came against
[1:29:09] us into our
[1:29:11] hand for who will hearken unto you in
[1:29:14] this matter but as his part is that
[1:29:17] goeth down to Battle so shall his part
[1:29:20] be that terth by the stuff
[1:29:24] they shall part alike and it was so that
[1:29:28] day forward that he made it a statute
[1:29:31] and an ordinance for Israel unto this
[1:29:35] day you can look to the
[1:29:39] victory that has been won in this day
[1:29:42] and the spoil has been freely given to
[1:29:45] you whether or not you had the faith to
[1:29:48] believe for it whether or not you could
[1:29:50] climb the mountain whether or not you
[1:29:51] could cross the river
[1:29:54] God is minded to give you the
[1:29:58] spoils he's such a caring God that I
[1:30:02] looked to ishmail Saints he even heard
[1:30:04] the cries of the
[1:30:07] lad and how much more the children of
[1:30:09] God and Heirs of the
[1:30:14] promise you may not be the ones who
[1:30:16] could fight you may not be the ones who
[1:30:18] you feel can do the Victorious thing but
[1:30:20] you've been made heir to the
[1:30:22] spoil there's a priz that you're
[1:30:24] contending for there's something that
[1:30:27] our hearts must be set
[1:30:30] upon is that the musicians would
[1:30:35] come and
[1:30:38] that's if I was to
[1:30:40] say the union that has to be just as
[1:30:43] there had to be an Earnest Vision that
[1:30:47] Christ could look to Jerusalem you as
[1:30:49] the Bride of Jesus Christ have to have
[1:30:51] an earnest
[1:30:54] vision of who your union is
[1:30:58] with why you've aband why you're called
[1:31:00] out why you're chosen why you're
[1:31:03] separated what is it that you've
[1:31:07] set the prize that's before you and that
[1:31:11] will cause you to throw down and cast
[1:31:13] down everything else there there really
[1:31:15] needs to be the ability saints that our
[1:31:18] hearts this is not
[1:31:20] negotiable we need to be able to walk
[1:31:22] away from all things
[1:31:25] Earthly our affections cannot be set
[1:31:28] upon material
[1:31:31] things there has to be a greater love
[1:31:34] for the things of God I'm not saying
[1:31:36] that you've been called to do that but
[1:31:38] if you were called there is a price for
[1:31:40] discipleship there's a price for
[1:31:42] following Christ and are you willing to
[1:31:45] pay it and if you're not you're not
[1:31:47] worthy of the Gospel you haven't
[1:31:50] actually experienced the love of God the
[1:31:53] way you can
[1:31:54] because it will it'll change the way
[1:31:56] your heart has been
[1:32:00] set if you could play uh hold to God's
[1:32:02] unchanging hand let's go ahead and stand
[1:32:10] together my prayer is a renewed Vision
[1:32:13] the scripture would say without a vision
[1:32:15] the people perish if you and when you
[1:32:18] look at that the vision that we have
[1:32:20] with God is a vision of redemption it's
[1:32:22] a revision of Recon conciliation that
[1:32:24] there's a vision of Union there's a
[1:32:26] vision that a little while and this
[1:32:30] world's going to be no
[1:32:32] more and I want that Vision to be become
[1:32:35] a reality to be renewed if I let
[1:32:38] distractions and things come in if
[1:32:40] there's fruits in my life that are not
[1:32:42] declaring that
[1:32:44] my heart has been set upon those things
[1:32:47] above I ask that God would renew
[1:32:49] that if there's reward that others have
[1:32:52] obtained that they've fought the
[1:32:54] battles I want to recognize that by
[1:32:57] God's grace I'm also entitled to a
[1:32:59] portion that God's given for me there's
[1:33:02] no big eyes or little 's there's no
[1:33:04] respector of person but God's grace is
[1:33:06] to bless you God's grace is to give you
[1:33:09] what you have need of to give you
[1:33:11] provision and it's
[1:33:15] yours you're heir to the promise you're
[1:33:18] part of the building it's not a building
[1:33:21] without you
[1:33:24] I many years ago now misquoted that
[1:33:27] scripture that and I believe it was when
[1:33:29] speaking with our pastor I said you know
[1:33:31] someone says they're not a part of the
[1:33:33] body they're not a part of the body but
[1:33:35] the scripture is actually saying that
[1:33:37] even if you say you're
[1:33:38] not we can't do it without
[1:33:41] you one Sorrows we all sorrow one
[1:33:44] rejoices we all
[1:33:47] rejoice and your spirit has to be in one
[1:33:50] mind at one Accord you've got to catch
[1:33:53] the heavenly
[1:33:54] Vision this message that God sent
[1:33:56] through a prophet gives it to you it
[1:33:59] tells you the hour you're in the things
[1:34:02] you're fighting against spiritual
[1:34:06] wickedness but it adorned you the way
[1:34:09] that Christ wants to receive you let's
[1:34:12] just go before him gracious Heavenly
[1:34:15] Father Lord we're so inadequate Lord in
[1:34:18] many ways but we know you receive the
[1:34:20] glory because you give the increase
[1:34:23] father
[1:34:24] that words that are broken or maybe are
[1:34:26] not capable of conveying oh God by
[1:34:29] Revelation you can do what man cannot do
[1:34:33] Lord my prayer is now as even we bow our
[1:34:35] heads in recognition that Lord this
[1:34:39] world and those things around us are not
[1:34:41] worthy of our attention we've closed our
[1:34:43] eyes and we've shut out all other things
[1:34:46] and we've reverenced ourselves and we've
[1:34:48] lowered our heads and said God you're
[1:34:51] God of all you're Supreme you're Lord of
[1:34:53] glor glory Lord and if you can conquer
[1:34:56] death hell in the grave and give us the
[1:34:59] victory then surely we could believe now
[1:35:01] that all we have need of you've
[1:35:04] provided Lord raise our faith to
[1:35:07] believe Lord you told us to pray on
[1:35:10] Earth as it is in
[1:35:11] heaven Lord we're asking oh God that
[1:35:14] that would become such a
[1:35:16] reality Lord that the temporal things of
[1:35:19] this world that we wouldn't testify to
[1:35:21] them but we could say now I'm well now
[1:35:24] I'm
[1:35:26] Healed now I have a heavenly vision now
[1:35:30] I
[1:35:32] forgive
[1:35:35] Lord do only that which you can do for
[1:35:38] we ask it in the mighty name of our Lord
[1:35:40] and Savior Jesus
[1:35:42] Christ
[1:35:44] amen let's try to sing that together as
[1:35:47] we turn the service
[1:35:49] over well
[1:35:51] time is filled with swift transition

[1:40:24] a focused Faith amen want to not be
[1:40:30] distracted you know we live in the world
[1:40:31] where you can't do one thing right you
[1:40:34] you expect it to do five at the same
[1:40:36] time you got to do this you got to do
[1:40:38] this you got to do this and you go out
[1:40:41] you go here you go there you go there
[1:40:43] and and all of the sudden you find out
[1:40:45] you didn't achieve anything half of
[1:40:47] everything and and and if we're not
[1:40:49] careful we become like that spiritually
[1:40:52] We Touch here wech through but God wants
[1:40:54] us to be focused he wants our faith to
[1:40:57] be focused in one thing David said I
[1:41:00] said to I said the lord always before me
[1:41:03] he was focused that I might not sin
[1:41:05] against him he said I will look to your
[1:41:08] face until I become even like you he was
[1:41:12] focused in the vision he wasn't looking
[1:41:14] to the left and to the right and oh this
[1:41:17] is going on here what's going on in the
[1:41:19] world that's what the devil like our
[1:41:21] brother said tonight that's what every
[1:41:22] day
[1:41:23] we are we are fighting from the moment
[1:41:26] we work up it's the battle for Focus
[1:41:30] this is going on and your phone is
[1:41:32] ringing and this is you got to go
[1:41:33] through this and work is waiting over
[1:41:35] there and and and you can go out
[1:41:38] throughout the day and not even have
[1:41:40] anything to think about God the whole
[1:41:43] day that's the status that he wants you
[1:41:45] to be but oh if we can have our mind
[1:41:48] focused to be like those that in the
[1:41:51] time of Jeremiah that were uh I'm sorry
[1:41:54] in the time of nemiah that were being
[1:41:56] the wall they had the focus they had in
[1:41:58] one hands the were building but in the
[1:42:00] other hand they had a a weapon in the
[1:42:03] hand why because they knew what they
[1:42:05] were placed there for I want to be
[1:42:07] focused that's the desire of my heart I
[1:42:09] heard I said God help me be focused I I
[1:42:12] want to be useful for the kingdom of God
[1:42:15] and I don't want to just run after the
[1:42:17] things of the world and try to achieve
[1:42:19] that and then they achieve this and then
[1:42:21] at the end all of that like we saying
[1:42:23] it's worth
[1:42:25] nothing but what we the purpose if we
[1:42:28] can come to the purpose which we were
[1:42:30] place here I like that that that quote
[1:42:32] we read where it said that it's the
[1:42:35] Revelation in the end time of Luke 17:30
[1:42:38] Revelation 107 that places love in your
[1:42:41] heart to for you to talk about it to to
[1:42:43] somebody it places the love in your
[1:42:46] heart for you to go and tell tell
[1:42:48] somebody about it it's not for you to
[1:42:50] keep it because true love will carry
[1:42:53] about the next person true love is
[1:42:55] wanting to know am I actually about my
[1:42:59] father's business am I being helpful am
[1:43:01] I being at the place where I could be
[1:43:03] used true love is not keeping everything
[1:43:05] and saying that's for me and you know
[1:43:07] they can go and you know they don't see
[1:43:09] it you know therefore you know they're
[1:43:11] going to go to hell well if you didn't
[1:43:13] tell them that means you didn't have
[1:43:15] true love in your
[1:43:17] heart oh my I want to be focused on the
[1:43:20] things that God wants me to be focused
[1:43:22] on is that your heart desire why don't
[1:43:24] you just lift your hand to him and pray
