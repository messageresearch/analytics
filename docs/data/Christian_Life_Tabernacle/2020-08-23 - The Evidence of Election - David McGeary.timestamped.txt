[9:12] of the lord this morning i want to
[9:13] welcome everyone
[9:15] amen god bless you as you invite remind
[9:16] you for our psalm reading
[9:20] amen
[9:24] god bless you good morning i read in
[9:27] psalm
[9:28] 113 this morning
[9:32] you know there's a verse in psalm 113
[9:35] verse
[9:36] 1 it says praise ye the lord
[9:39] praise o ye servants of the lord praise
[9:42] the name of the lord
[9:44] you know it's interesting here in many
[9:46] places in the scriptures the lord
[9:48] makes a distinction between praising the
[9:50] lord
[9:52] and praising his name and those are you
[9:55] know kind of
[9:56] two different things and i got to
[9:57] thinking about a name what's what's the
[9:59] what's the difference what's the
[10:00] distinction between
[10:02] praising the lord praising his name you
[10:05] know in
[10:06] matthew 18 20 there's a verse that we we
[10:09] know by heart
[10:10] you know it says that for where two or
[10:12] three are gathered
[10:13] in my name there am i in the midst of
[10:17] them
[10:18] you know it's you know i think that what
[10:21] we have to remember is it's this isn't a
[10:22] magic spell
[10:23] right this isn't an incantation we say
[10:26] that
[10:27] if we're in his name suddenly he's there
[10:30] right but in exodus 20
[10:33] 24 he makes a statement to the children
[10:36] of israel he's talking about the places
[10:38] where he's going to set up to worship
[10:40] and he makes a statement there in all
[10:42] places where i
[10:44] record my name i will come unto thee
[10:47] and will bless thee you know i think the
[10:50] thing that is important remember is
[10:52] he chooses where to put his name
[10:55] he chooses what to associate his name
[10:57] with you know even when you're
[10:59] about your daily lives or you're coming
[11:01] in contact with people how many times
[11:03] have you heard someone look at a project
[11:04] or look at a work and say hey i don't
[11:06] want my name associated with that
[11:08] i don't i don't want anything to do with
[11:09] that that does not reflect me
[11:12] right and likewise how many people are
[11:14] so proud
[11:16] to ascribe their name to a great work or
[11:18] to an achievement it's considered an
[11:19] honor
[11:20] to apply someone's name to something
[11:22] that was done that was good
[11:24] well the lord is no different there's
[11:26] only certain things that
[11:28] he's willing to associate his name with
[11:30] it's his identity it's his
[11:31] characteristics it's his attributes
[11:33] in fact in second chronicles when he was
[11:35] talking to the children of israel trying
[11:37] again to find a place to worship
[11:39] he said i'm not i didn't choose any city
[11:42] i didn't choose any man to put my name
[11:44] but you know i chose jerusalem
[11:46] to put my name there a very specific
[11:49] place
[11:50] right you know he's very careful about
[11:52] what he associates his name with the
[11:54] name is more than a
[11:55] a label right if i rattle off names like
[11:58] nick shafer or chris brunetti or joan
[12:02] logan
[12:03] those names probably don't mean anything
[12:05] to anyone in this room
[12:07] but they mean something to me because
[12:09] they're people i know
[12:10] when i hear those names there's
[12:12] attributes and there's characteristics
[12:15] and there's behaviors and there's
[12:16] certain work styles things that i know
[12:18] they would do things when i see work i
[12:20] recognize as being part of them
[12:22] things that i know they would say or
[12:24] they wouldn't so what's interesting
[12:26] there is you can't
[12:28] know a name really until you know the
[12:31] person
[12:32] that's involved in the name not only
[12:34] that but there's
[12:35] there's people that are called by his
[12:38] name
[12:38] in ii chronicles 7 14 it says if my
[12:42] people which are called by my name
[12:45] the moment you put your name to
[12:46] something it becomes part of you
[12:48] it belongs part of it's part of
[12:52] it's part of your your character in fact
[12:54] he's not going to share it with anything
[12:56] in isaiah 48 10 it says behold i have
[12:59] refined thee
[13:01] but not with silver i have chosen thee
[13:04] in the furnace of affliction
[13:06] for mine own sake will i do it
[13:09] for how should my name be polluted and i
[13:12] will not give my glory
[13:14] unto another he's not going to share his
[13:16] name with any human characteristics
[13:19] or skill sets or talent or reputation or
[13:22] anything
[13:23] and usually he's only going to give his
[13:25] name to those who have been through a
[13:27] refining
[13:29] and a preparation process his name is a
[13:32] precious thing
[13:33] right you know there are many people
[13:35] that go about
[13:36] saying they're going to do things in his
[13:37] name you know matthew 7 22 says many
[13:40] will say to me in that day
[13:43] lord lord have i not prophesied in thy
[13:45] name
[13:46] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[13:48] thy name done many wonderful works
[13:51] and what does he say he says and then
[13:52] while i profess unto them i never knew
[13:54] thee
[13:56] depart from me ye that work iniquity so
[13:58] you have to know the person
[14:00] before you can truly know what that name
[14:04] involves and finally in psalm 91 14 he
[14:07] says this because he has set his love
[14:09] upon me
[14:10] therefore will i deliver him i will set
[14:13] him on high
[14:14] because he hath known my name
[14:19] so when we talk about praising his name
[14:22] his name is a very special set of
[14:25] characteristics and
[14:26] it's his signature and he will only sign
[14:29] his name
[14:30] to something that reflects him but then
[14:33] when somebody reflects him
[14:35] and bears his name then his name is
[14:38] continually being praised in the earth
[14:40] living epistles red of all men
[14:44] praise his name how many of you
[14:48] would like to see his name praised amen
[14:50] in your life
[14:52] so every time you read that verse that
[14:53] says praise his name may that be me
[14:56] may i be praising his name in the image
[14:59] that i bear
[15:00] so let's read psalm 113 together it's
[15:02] just a short short scripture
[15:06] starting in verse 1 praise ye the lord
[15:09] praise ye servants of the lord praise
[15:13] the name of the lord
[15:14] blessed be the name of the lord from
[15:17] this time
[15:18] forth and forevermore from the rising of
[15:21] the sun
[15:22] unto the going down of the saint the
[15:24] lord's name
[15:25] is to be praised the lord is high above
[15:28] all nations
[15:29] and his glory above the heavens who is
[15:32] like unto the lord our god
[15:34] who dwelleth on high who humbleth
[15:37] himself
[15:38] to behold the things that are in heaven
[15:40] and in the earth
[15:41] he raiseth up the poor out of the dust
[15:44] and lifteth the needy
[15:45] out of the dunghill that he may set him
[15:48] with princes
[15:49] even with the princes of his people he
[15:52] maketh the barren woman
[15:54] to keep house and to be a joyful mother
[15:56] of children
[15:57] praise ye the lord amen
[16:04] amen that's what we're here to do this
[16:07] morning praise the lord you may have
[16:08] your seats
[16:09] man let's sing fill my way every day

[37:53] different perspective for me you know in
[37:56] my pursuit for perfection in christ
[37:59] even in my physical pursuit so
[38:02] oftentimes i beat myself
[38:04] i'll just say you ought to be bigger
[38:06] than this or you ought to be
[38:08] in a higher place than this you know and
[38:11] then when you talked about that and i
[38:13] said okay
[38:14] okay god's judgment his opinion about
[38:17] what i need to be where i need to be and
[38:19] so he's pushing me he's teaching me that
[38:21] every lesson
[38:22] and my wife asked me the question and
[38:24] say can you tell me
[38:26] why but you prayed about this and you
[38:28] prayed about that
[38:29] and it was everything was good so what's

[49:26] bibles let's turn over to the
[49:28] book of corinthians the
[49:32] 12th chapter of the book of corinthians

[49:35] so we want to
[49:41] welcome brother joelle and
[49:45] sister rachel tobaya our newlyweds are

[50:06] i must i must have done a good job
[50:09] okay and then so we're grateful for that
[50:12] we're also
[50:12] uh like to welcome any of our guests and
[50:16] visitors
[50:17] this morning that are here with us the
[50:19] lord
[50:20] richly uh bless you
[50:24] we want to kind of have a little
[50:28] bible study this morning i hope that i
[50:31] can bring this
[50:33] in a manner to express it
[50:36] to you what's on my heart
[50:40] uh so will uh
[50:43] like a friend of mine shared with me the
[50:45] other day said i never can figure out
[50:48] how you get from where you start to
[50:50] where you finish
[50:52] but uh but maybe there will be something
[50:55] in between
[50:57] that'll be a blessing to you this
[50:58] morning so
[51:00] lord richly bless you uh and
[51:03] as we just pray that the lord will bless
[51:05] his word
[51:06] to us this is uh this is
[51:10] kind of a little foundation of where
[51:12] that we want to go
[51:14] uh but so we just hope that it'll be a
[51:18] blessing
[51:19] to you this is found in
[51:22] the first corinthians the 12th chapter
[51:25] and
[51:26] where there's uh paul goes through the
[51:29] the different gifts and the different
[51:31] things that
[51:32] god has manifested he says but the
[51:35] manifestation of the spirit
[51:37] given to every man to profit
[51:40] with all and so
[51:45] he talks about these different gifts and
[51:47] now he comes down
[51:49] and he's placing those gifts and
[51:52] bringing to the church
[51:53] to the realization of the body so let's
[51:56] read these scriptures 4
[51:59] 12 first corinthians 12 12 for as the
[52:03] body
[52:04] is one and half many members
[52:09] and all the members of that one body
[52:14] being many are one body
[52:18] so also is christ
[52:21] for by one spirit are we
[52:25] all baptized into one body
[52:28] whether we be jews or gentiles
[52:32] whether we be bond or free
[52:36] and have been all made to drink
[52:40] into one spirit for the body
[52:43] is not one member but many
[52:48] if the foot shall say because i
[52:52] am not the hand i am
[52:55] not of the body is it
[52:58] therefore not of the body
[53:02] and if the ear shall say because
[53:05] i am not the i
[53:09] i am not of the body
[53:12] is it therefore not of the body
[53:16] if the whole body were an eye
[53:20] where were the hearing if the whole were
[53:23] hearing
[53:24] where were the smelling but now
[53:27] hath god set the members
[53:31] every one of them in the body
[53:34] as it hath pleased him let me read that
[53:38] again but now hath god
[53:41] set the members every
[53:44] one of them in
[53:47] the body every one of them
[53:51] in the body as it hath
[53:54] pleased him and if they were all
[53:57] one member where were the body
[54:01] but now are they many members
[54:04] yet but one body
[54:08] and the eye cannot say unto the hand
[54:12] i have no need of thee nor again
[54:16] the head to the feet i have no
[54:19] need of you nay much more
[54:22] those members of the body which seem to
[54:25] be more
[54:26] feeble are necessary and those members
[54:30] of the body which we think to be less
[54:32] honorable
[54:33] upon these we've bestowed more abundant
[54:36] honor
[54:37] and our uncommonly parts have more
[54:40] abundant comeliness
[54:43] for our comely parts have
[54:46] no need but god has tempered the body
[54:49] together having given more abundant
[54:52] honor
[54:53] to that parch which lacketh
[54:56] that there should be no schism in the
[54:59] body
[55:01] but that the members should have the
[55:03] same care
[55:04] one for another
[55:09] whether one member suffereth all members
[55:11] suffer with it
[55:13] or one member be honored all the members
[55:17] rejoice with it now ye are the body of
[55:20] christ
[55:21] and members in particular
[55:24] our heavenly father we ask you to bless
[55:27] us today
[55:28] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[55:31] you may be seated this morning
[55:38] we're only having one service until
[55:42] september 6 and then we'll resume our
[55:46] evening services uh september 6th
[55:50] with our communion service we tried to
[55:53] expand a little more parking places
[55:56] over here as you noticed because we
[55:59] might start working on the farther part
[56:02] we're making some changes as we're
[56:04] working towards our
[56:06] our uh program if the lord would
[56:10] continue to bless us and we have
[56:13] submitted
[56:14] our plat to the city
[56:17] so they have 30 days to approve the plat
[56:21] and then we should receive our building
[56:23] permit so
[56:24] we just ask you to continue to pray
[56:28] that the lord will bless us
[56:32] um we'd like to
[56:37] if we titled this
[56:41] message this morning this little thought
[56:44] that's on my heart
[56:45] i would probably like to call it the
[56:49] evidence of election
[56:54] the evidence of election and
[56:58] it might be kind of
[57:01] uh i want to
[57:05] make sure that we that it's expressed
[57:08] this way
[57:10] not necessarily the proof
[57:13] of it so i don't want to take it from
[57:17] the side
[57:18] of what we do if we're elected
[57:21] we want to get to that part but there's
[57:24] the part on the beginning
[57:26] that god does in our election
[57:30] and we read the scriptures of
[57:33] the body because uh
[57:37] i think that it's necessary for us that
[57:41] our individual desire i believe is we
[57:44] all want to be more christ-like
[57:47] we all want to go on higher ground and
[57:50] and i think that as a body of believers
[57:53] that we want to rise to higher heights
[57:56] we want to we want to
[58:00] accomplish more we want to do more
[58:04] and we want to rise up
[58:07] in in uh uh greater spiritual realms
[58:12] than we've ever been before we'd uh
[58:16] you we just you just don't want to sit
[58:18] still
[58:20] because you find out that when you sit
[58:22] still
[58:23] things get very common to you yeah
[58:26] and and you get used to it and then it
[58:30] doesn't seem to do for you
[58:32] what it used to do for you and it just
[58:34] seems to
[58:35] uh you come to the place where you just
[58:39] you know you just go grow tired
[58:42] and and uh but you know if you're if
[58:45] you're going
[58:46] greater and you're entering in and
[58:48] you're experienced
[58:50] things and fellowship with god greater
[58:52] than you ever
[58:54] have before it creates an expectation
[58:58] and without an expectation without
[59:01] something that you believe
[59:03] you can obtain then there's only one
[59:05] thing left and that's almost a form of
[59:08] spiritual depression
[59:10] and so we don't want to
[59:14] get to the place where it just seems
[59:17] like we're
[59:17] laboring in vain but we want to we want
[59:20] to rise up
[59:22] into higher heights a greater experience
[59:25] more
[59:25] fat more fellowship with god more love
[59:28] with god
[59:29] and so we want to talk a little bit
[59:32] about
[59:33] election for just a few moments as we
[59:36] move on
[59:37] but it's important that you
[59:40] answer the question about your election
[59:46] that has got to be settled
[59:50] in your heart first and and you
[59:53] you've got to you've got to come to that
[59:56] conclusion
[59:57] that you're chosen and and
[1:00:00] that that election uh is of
[1:00:03] god and that god orchestrated
[1:00:07] that election in your life
[1:00:10] in other words it's not you didn't
[1:00:12] choose him
[1:00:13] he chose you and so once that election
[1:00:17] is established in your heart
[1:00:19] and that's settled that doesn't mean
[1:00:21] you're free from failures it doesn't
[1:00:23] mean you're
[1:00:24] free from mistakes it doesn't
[1:00:27] it does it doesn't mean that you don't
[1:00:29] have things you've got to overcome
[1:00:32] but it's the one thing that's totally
[1:00:36] settled in your heart is that he chose
[1:00:39] me
[1:00:40] he picked me and that's what election is
[1:00:44] election is a choice made by god
[1:00:49] and we could read in the scripture if
[1:00:52] you wanted to turn in your bible
[1:00:54] up with me to uh the gospel of saint
[1:00:58] john
[1:00:59] at in just a few little scriptures
[1:01:02] in in saint john 6
[1:01:06] and 37 he says all
[1:01:09] the father giveth me shall
[1:01:13] come to me and he that
[1:01:16] cometh to me i will in no
[1:01:19] wise cast out and
[1:01:23] and so we we have that assurance that
[1:01:27] all that the father had chosen or
[1:01:30] the father hath given to me they'll come
[1:01:32] to me
[1:01:33] and i'm going to receive them so if
[1:01:36] if god has called you and elected you
[1:01:41] and and chosen you you will come
[1:01:46] uh you know paul i think experienced
[1:01:48] that firsthand
[1:01:50] uh he was set out to put havoc
[1:01:55] in the church and he was going to put an
[1:01:57] end to this heresy
[1:01:59] that these people were uh preaching
[1:02:02] uh concerning the christ being the
[1:02:05] messiah
[1:02:06] and the fulfilling of the law and this
[1:02:09] new practice
[1:02:10] that they had entered into of of
[1:02:12] gathering together and
[1:02:14] worshiping in the spirit and he thought
[1:02:17] man now this has got to stop
[1:02:20] and so he went and got orders from the
[1:02:22] high priest that
[1:02:23] uh i'm going to put an end to this i
[1:02:26] don't think this
[1:02:26] is good but he he didn't understand one
[1:02:30] thing
[1:02:31] that he was elected that he was
[1:02:35] chosen and all that the father
[1:02:39] had given him will come and so he
[1:02:42] settled that
[1:02:43] another scripture we could turn to
[1:02:46] is in saint john the 15th
[1:02:49] chapter and it's another great
[1:02:53] uh comforting scripture to the
[1:02:57] believer and
[1:03:00] he says here in saint john 15
[1:03:03] 15 he says henceforth
[1:03:06] i call you not servants for the servant
[1:03:10] knoweth not
[1:03:12] what his lord does
[1:03:15] but i have called you friends
[1:03:18] for all things that i have heard of
[1:03:22] my father i have made
[1:03:25] known unto you
[1:03:28] now hold that there because we're going
[1:03:30] to touch on it in a little bit
[1:03:32] ye have not chosen me but i
[1:03:36] have chosen you and ordained you
[1:03:41] that ye should go and bring forth
[1:03:45] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:03:50] that whatsoever ye shall ask of
[1:03:53] the father in my name
[1:03:56] he may give it you
[1:04:00] these things i command you that ye love
[1:04:04] one another now that is a a
[1:04:08] tremendous scripture and
[1:04:11] once again he said i you didn't choose
[1:04:14] me
[1:04:15] i have chosen you
[1:04:18] and so election you we have
[1:04:22] to come to this place that
[1:04:25] that would be what we'd have to to
[1:04:28] settle
[1:04:29] on is the fact that god chose us
[1:04:32] and you know coming from my background
[1:04:35] i battled that for a very
[1:04:38] long time until i
[1:04:41] surrendered because coming from the
[1:04:44] background that i had
[1:04:45] and and the complexes that i grew up
[1:04:48] with and
[1:04:49] and just overall uh
[1:04:52] that part of me that didn't seem to fit
[1:04:55] in
[1:04:56] in society that i always wanted to
[1:05:00] look at my flesh and look at my
[1:05:03] works and look at what i was doing and
[1:05:06] weigh those things as the source of my
[1:05:09] election
[1:05:11] and they didn't have anything to do with
[1:05:13] my election
[1:05:15] because god is the potter and
[1:05:19] we could read this scripture in
[1:05:22] this statement in the church age book
[1:05:26] he says here in is now set forth the
[1:05:30] love of god
[1:05:32] he desired in love a family of his own
[1:05:36] a family of sons and that's always
[1:05:39] daughters is always
[1:05:40] attached to the family of sons sons like
[1:05:44] himself
[1:05:45] therefore before him lies all mankind
[1:05:48] is one lump of clay and out of that same
[1:05:52] lump
[1:05:54] he will now make vessels unto honor
[1:05:57] and unto dishonor the choosing
[1:06:01] will be his own choosing
[1:06:05] then those chosen ones born of his
[1:06:08] spirit will be
[1:06:09] trained to conform to his image
[1:06:13] in their walk he reproves
[1:06:16] with all longsuffering and gentleness
[1:06:20] and mercy he chastens with nail scarred
[1:06:24] hands
[1:06:25] sometimes this potter must take the
[1:06:27] vessel
[1:06:28] he is working on and thoroughly break it
[1:06:32] down
[1:06:32] in order that he may rebuild it
[1:06:36] exactly as he desires it
[1:06:39] but it is love that
[1:06:42] is his love and
[1:06:45] another way of his love there
[1:06:48] is not there cannot be
[1:06:52] so we we see that it's his choosing
[1:06:55] so the lump of clay is the same but he
[1:06:58] makes
[1:06:58] one lump under honor and another lump
[1:07:02] on the dishonor that's why he says who
[1:07:04] can the pot
[1:07:05] say to the potter why hath thou made me
[1:07:09] thus
[1:07:10] it's his election for his
[1:07:13] own good pleasure he makes the
[1:07:16] choice and so if you try to weigh
[1:07:19] yourself
[1:07:20] or or measure yourself or or say
[1:07:24] that you know if i i'm chosen
[1:07:27] when i accomplish this or accomplish
[1:07:30] that
[1:07:31] then you've molded your own vessel
[1:07:34] but if you understand that he can tear
[1:07:37] that vessel down
[1:07:39] he can rebuild that vessel the way that
[1:07:42] he
[1:07:42] wants to he set it in motion
[1:07:46] the choosing was his own choosing and
[1:07:48] he's going to reprove
[1:07:50] and he's going to correct and he's going
[1:07:52] to chastise and he's going to instruct
[1:07:56] and you know i know what it's like to be
[1:07:59] completely torn down
[1:08:02] it is not fun it
[1:08:05] is not even as no chastisement
[1:08:08] is pleasant at the time but afterwards
[1:08:12] it brings forth
[1:08:14] a fruit of of uh you know
[1:08:17] okay and a piece that comes with it
[1:08:20] and and you know they they've
[1:08:24] found that even even with children now i
[1:08:27] i don't believe in
[1:08:29] it and maybe in my life i've might
[1:08:31] respond
[1:08:32] spank my children too hard i don't
[1:08:34] believe in beating children
[1:08:36] and i don't believe in spanking them
[1:08:38] when you're angry
[1:08:40] but is a correction out of love
[1:08:44] even if it comes with a a a few
[1:08:49] uh you know attitude adjustments
[1:08:53] uh it they they
[1:08:57] they receive that as someone that cares
[1:09:00] for them
[1:09:01] that cares about their their outcome
[1:09:04] that is interested in them they don't
[1:09:07] take it all
[1:09:07] from a negative standpoint in fact they
[1:09:11] crave that they need that and many
[1:09:14] times a neglected person will find
[1:09:16] themselves
[1:09:17] out to doing things and things that
[1:09:21] aren't right
[1:09:22] because they want that chastisement they
[1:09:25] want that correction
[1:09:27] because they need that direction you
[1:09:29] just can't turn the child loose
[1:09:32] out on the door and say go fend for
[1:09:34] yourself go take care of yourself
[1:09:38] go raise yourself they're created to
[1:09:42] have a guiding hand
[1:09:44] and and so they need that and they
[1:09:48] they need that correction and that's the
[1:09:50] love of god
[1:09:51] to show interest in it so you you've got
[1:09:55] to take
[1:09:55] the measuring of yourself
[1:09:58] out of the picture in other words you
[1:10:01] don't
[1:10:02] provide the only evidence
[1:10:05] of your election that that that's
[1:10:09] not where it is but when you
[1:10:12] understand why
[1:10:16] that he elected why that he chose
[1:10:21] and then you can you go back to look
[1:10:24] at what's the evidence
[1:10:27] of your election so
[1:10:31] how do i know he elected me in other
[1:10:34] words
[1:10:34] what did he do to
[1:10:37] me that would let me
[1:10:40] realize that i was elected so let's just
[1:10:44] read a little bit i know
[1:10:45] i'm not a very good reader and but if
[1:10:48] you will bear
[1:10:49] with me i'd like to uh
[1:10:53] read in a little portion
[1:10:57] out of the church age book found on page
[1:11:00] 336
[1:11:01] of the church age book
[1:11:07] and it says here he says
[1:11:10] he says all things were made by him
[1:11:14] and without him was not anything made
[1:11:18] that was made he
[1:11:21] is the one of whom it
[1:11:25] is of whom it is said
[1:11:28] in genesis 1 1
[1:11:31] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:11:35] and the earth also
[1:11:38] it says in exodus 20
[1:11:43] 11 for in six days the lord made
[1:11:46] heavens and earth the sea and
[1:11:50] all that is in them
[1:11:53] is and rested the seventh day
[1:11:57] see there is no doubt that he
[1:12:01] is the creator he was the creator
[1:12:05] of the finished physical creation
[1:12:10] surely we can see what these words
[1:12:14] mean now to have any other
[1:12:17] interpretation
[1:12:18] would mean that god created god
[1:12:22] how could god create when he himself
[1:12:26] is the creator he said
[1:12:29] now
[1:12:32] but now he is standing in the midst
[1:12:36] of his church and we know that
[1:12:40] in the book of revelations that was the
[1:12:42] first picture
[1:12:44] that john drew of the seventh church
[1:12:46] ages
[1:12:47] was christ standing in the midst of his
[1:12:49] church
[1:12:50] so in other words he's interested into
[1:12:52] this church
[1:12:54] he's it's his church
[1:12:57] and he's in the midst of the church he's
[1:12:59] not standing afar off
[1:13:01] seeing if you can make it through the
[1:13:03] maze he is
[1:13:04] present with his church our part
[1:13:08] is to come to the realization and to
[1:13:11] receive i sav
[1:13:13] that we can see him standing in this
[1:13:16] church
[1:13:17] we can recognize his presence with us
[1:13:19] this morning
[1:13:21] but he is standing in the midst of a
[1:13:23] church as he stands there
[1:13:25] revealing who he is in this last day
[1:13:30] he calls himself the author
[1:13:34] of the creation of god
[1:13:37] this is another creation
[1:13:41] this has to do with the church
[1:13:45] this is a special designation
[1:13:48] of himself he is the creator
[1:13:52] of that church
[1:13:56] you understand so it he is the
[1:14:00] creator of that church
[1:14:03] so this elected body
[1:14:07] is a created body it's a created
[1:14:11] election it's not just somebody that
[1:14:16] made a few adjustments to themselves
[1:14:23] and meant the mold this is not a remodel
[1:14:28] you understand you are not a remodel
[1:14:32] you are more than a remodel god just
[1:14:36] didn't take what you were
[1:14:38] and remodel you do a few little changes
[1:14:41] on you make a few
[1:14:43] little adjustments and everything no he
[1:14:46] makes you a new creation we are new
[1:14:49] creations in christ jesus
[1:14:53] he does it he does it with nail scarred
[1:14:57] hands he does it with chastisement
[1:15:00] he does it with rebuke he does it with
[1:15:03] sometimes
[1:15:04] breaking it all down he does it with
[1:15:06] nail scarred hands
[1:15:07] it's the love of god but he's the
[1:15:10] creator of this
[1:15:12] he says he is the creator
[1:15:15] of the church
[1:15:20] the heavenly bridegroom creating
[1:15:24] his own bride
[1:15:28] oh my god okay let's start look at this
[1:15:31] wonderful
[1:15:33] relationship of election so
[1:15:36] you've been elected to be
[1:15:39] created amen
[1:15:43] that sounds good
[1:15:46] as the spirit of god he came down
[1:15:50] and created in the virgin mary the cell
[1:15:54] from which his body was born i want to
[1:15:57] repeat that
[1:15:59] he created the very cell in the womb
[1:16:03] of mary for that body
[1:16:06] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[1:16:09] simply
[1:16:10] give life to the human ovary supplied by
[1:16:14] mary
[1:16:15] that would have been sinful mankind
[1:16:19] producing a body that
[1:16:22] would not have produced the last adam
[1:16:26] of him it was said lo
[1:16:29] a body hath the father prepared for me
[1:16:34] god not mary provided that body
[1:16:37] merit was a human incubator and she
[1:16:41] carried that holy child and brought
[1:16:44] him to birth it was god man
[1:16:48] he was the son of god he was the new
[1:16:52] creation
[1:16:53] man and god meant and joined
[1:16:57] as he was the first of this new race
[1:17:02] he is the head of this
[1:17:05] new race okay and
[1:17:10] we ministered that subject one time
[1:17:14] that that we are not a religion
[1:17:17] we are a people
[1:17:21] we are a new created race
[1:17:28] we're all of the same uh uh
[1:17:32] origin
[1:17:36] we're all of the same life
[1:17:39] you understand we are not a body made up
[1:17:43] of
[1:17:44] uh parts that keep
[1:17:48] pulled together it doesn't matter where
[1:17:51] that you came for
[1:17:52] or where you come or what your rapper is
[1:17:56] you are in this church in the living
[1:17:59] church
[1:18:00] of the living god you are now
[1:18:03] part of a new race that's
[1:18:07] why that we don't defend any other race
[1:18:10] but the race of god
[1:18:12] that what we are i don't know what the
[1:18:14] world's out there talking about today
[1:18:18] and everything if you want to talk race
[1:18:21] to me this is the race i talk about
[1:18:24] this is the race that we are we are
[1:18:27] a new race a new creation
[1:18:31] a new people in christ jesus it's his
[1:18:34] spirit
[1:18:35] we are born of the same spirit
[1:18:39] by one spirit we are all born partakers
[1:18:42] of one
[1:18:43] nature because that's where we are
[1:18:46] so you've got to understand what your
[1:18:48] election
[1:18:49] is too i'm just
[1:18:53] reading it i uh uh
[1:18:57] so he actually by he says
[1:19:00] he says he was the of the new creation
[1:19:04] god met man he was the first of this new
[1:19:07] race
[1:19:08] he is the head of this new race
[1:19:12] colossians 1 18 and he is the head
[1:19:16] of the body the church who
[1:19:19] is the beginning the firstborn
[1:19:22] from the dead that in all things he
[1:19:25] might have
[1:19:26] preeminence corinthians 5 and 17
[1:19:31] therefore if any man be in christ he
[1:19:34] is a new creation
[1:19:37] old things have passed away behold
[1:19:40] all things are become
[1:19:44] new therefore can you see
[1:19:48] that through man was
[1:19:51] of the old order or creation
[1:19:55] now in union with christ
[1:19:58] has become the new creation
[1:20:02] of god
[1:20:07] you leave the old order behind
[1:20:12] and you realize that i've been elected
[1:20:17] or chosen to be a part
[1:20:20] of a new creation
[1:20:23] now if you're not sure of your election
[1:20:26] how are you going to be sure of this new
[1:20:28] creation
[1:20:30] why halt you between two opinions
[1:20:34] choose this day whom you're going to
[1:20:37] serve
[1:20:37] are you going to serve the world are you
[1:20:40] going to serve the old man
[1:20:42] are you going to serve the old order or
[1:20:44] are you going to be
[1:20:45] part of the new creation the new race
[1:20:48] the new person
[1:20:50] the body of christ
[1:20:56] don't halt between the two opinions
[1:21:00] don't get stuck out there between the
[1:21:04] two of them
[1:21:06] okay you the old order
[1:21:10] is going to fail you'll never be able to
[1:21:13] straighten it up
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:17] they're trying to create a
[1:21:21] a kingdom they try to create health
[1:21:24] through medicine
[1:21:27] medicine isn't the answer uh to health
[1:21:30] you know what the cause of bad health is
[1:21:33] is sins amen man
[1:21:37] sinned and that's why there's sickness
[1:21:40] that's why there's death it's the
[1:21:42] attribute of sin
[1:21:43] it's the attribute of disbelief you can
[1:21:46] take all the drugs create all the pills
[1:21:49] mix all the herbs and vitamins
[1:21:51] together i haven't found one pill
[1:21:54] outside of the gospel that ever gives
[1:21:57] life
[1:22:01] there's no life outside of it
[1:22:06] no life they they're they work hard
[1:22:13] but they're never they're never going to
[1:22:17] keep man there's only one thing
[1:22:20] that keeps man from passing from
[1:22:24] from death and that's if the same spirit
[1:22:29] that dwelt in jesus christ dwell in you
[1:22:32] it will quicken your mortal body
[1:22:36] there's that that's the only way
[1:22:39] of life that there is you can trust in
[1:22:42] science science has changed for mankind
[1:22:49] at one time if you were sick they would
[1:22:52] cut you
[1:22:53] and they'd take two or three pints of
[1:22:55] your blood out of you
[1:22:58] well i guess you felt so bad that the
[1:23:00] minute you felt better you thought you
[1:23:02] were well
[1:23:07] there's no talent science is not man's
[1:23:10] answer
[1:23:11] education is not man answer
[1:23:15] the only answer for man is the new birth
[1:23:19] is to be part of a new creation
[1:23:23] and that created people
[1:23:27] are chosen of god it's his
[1:23:31] choosing it's his election
[1:23:34] that that's what settles it
[1:23:37] he says he says the old creation
[1:23:41] he says and ye are let me go back here
[1:23:44] he says
[1:23:46] and you have passed away behold all
[1:23:48] things are become new
[1:23:50] there you are seek that through
[1:23:53] that through man was of the old order
[1:23:57] or creation now in the union with christ
[1:24:00] he has become the
[1:24:02] new creation of god ephesians
[1:24:05] 2 10 for we are his workmanship
[1:24:10] created in union with christ jesus
[1:24:15] made unto good works
[1:24:18] ephesians 4 2 24
[1:24:22] and that ye put on
[1:24:25] the new man which is after god
[1:24:29] is created in the righteousness and
[1:24:32] true holiness this new creation
[1:24:35] is not the old creation made over
[1:24:39] or it could not be called a new
[1:24:43] creation this is exactly
[1:24:46] what it says it is a new
[1:24:49] creation it is a it is another
[1:24:53] creation distinct from
[1:24:57] the old one
[1:25:00] and remember that was the curse of lady
[1:25:04] osea
[1:25:06] was to get in this luke warm state
[1:25:10] of mixing the two creations
[1:25:16] in other words you can't take
[1:25:20] religion and the new creation
[1:25:24] and ever take it and fix
[1:25:28] the old creation because
[1:25:31] all you would be doing is making that
[1:25:33] old creation over
[1:25:36] this is a death to the old
[1:25:40] man it is a death to the old world
[1:25:43] it is the laying down of the ideas
[1:25:46] laying down of the systems
[1:25:48] laying down of the education laying down
[1:25:51] of the science
[1:25:52] it is delaying and leaving those things
[1:25:55] which are behind behind
[1:25:56] and pressing for a higher calling in
[1:25:59] christ jesus
[1:26:03] now you see your election
[1:26:07] is is not an education
[1:26:14] that would be like getting a scholarship
[1:26:19] to a a university or something
[1:26:24] that they're going to re re-educate you
[1:26:28] no this is not this is a creation
[1:26:32] it's him creating a bride for
[1:26:36] himself
[1:26:39] so if you you you haven't been elected
[1:26:44] to have a knowledge
[1:26:47] you've been elected as a part of a new
[1:26:50] creation
[1:26:52] and he is going to perform that
[1:26:57] and make that creation come to pass
[1:27:02] he says new creation it is not another
[1:27:08] he says that's exactly what it says
[1:27:11] a new creation it is another creation
[1:27:15] distinct from the old one
[1:27:18] no longer is he dealing by
[1:27:22] ways of the flesh
[1:27:27] not dealing there
[1:27:30] so you could that that's what we we
[1:27:33] talked a little bit
[1:27:35] last week or before that it takes
[1:27:37] revelation
[1:27:39] that if you have to overcome something
[1:27:41] in the flesh
[1:27:42] you've got to deal with it in the spirit
[1:27:45] flesh can't war against flesh
[1:27:48] it takes more than something
[1:27:51] natural to defeat something natural
[1:27:55] it takes something supernatural to
[1:27:58] defeat something natural
[1:28:00] so it's like you can't fight at with the
[1:28:03] the saying you can't fight fire with
[1:28:06] fire
[1:28:10] you just got a whole lot more fire and
[1:28:13] if you try
[1:28:14] to fight flesh with flesh you end up
[1:28:17] with a whole lot more flesh
[1:28:19] that's why it's important that even in
[1:28:22] your dealings with
[1:28:23] members of the body or with other people
[1:28:26] you can't
[1:28:27] fight something that's carnal with a
[1:28:30] carnal nature
[1:28:32] you can't fight anger with anger
[1:28:35] you can't fight criticism with criticism
[1:28:38] all you've got is a whole lot more
[1:28:40] criticism you understand there's got to
[1:28:43] be
[1:28:44] some form of supernatural
[1:28:47] intervention in our lives to overcome
[1:28:50] the flesh
[1:28:51] you can't overcome the flesh with flesh
[1:28:55] kingdom doesn't war against itself
[1:29:01] so it it it comes to the realization
[1:29:06] because what we're talking about this
[1:29:08] morning is coming up higher
[1:29:10] not just as individuals we preach
[1:29:12] there's too much individuality
[1:29:14] we're talking about coming higher as a
[1:29:17] body
[1:29:17] each member fitted and joined together
[1:29:20] supplying to the other
[1:29:22] their need
[1:29:30] he said
[1:29:34] this is distinct from the old one no
[1:29:38] longer
[1:29:38] is he dealing by ways of the flesh
[1:29:42] that was how he dealt with israel he
[1:29:45] chose abraham
[1:29:46] in abraham issued to uh
[1:29:50] godly isaac la line but now
[1:29:53] out of every kindred tribe and nation
[1:29:58] he has proposed a new
[1:30:02] creation hallelujah
[1:30:06] i represent maybe the irish
[1:30:10] from the old into the new
[1:30:16] you could go back i don't care what your
[1:30:18] heritage is what your background is
[1:30:20] but you the only reason that you're here
[1:30:24] and you are where you're from and you
[1:30:27] have the background you do
[1:30:29] and the country you do was the one
[1:30:32] purpose only
[1:30:33] and that was to fulfill his word because
[1:30:36] he said from
[1:30:37] every tongue every kindred every nation
[1:30:44] that was so he could fulfill his word so
[1:30:47] it could be a new creation
[1:30:49] it would be his creation it wouldn't be
[1:30:52] a man-made creation
[1:30:56] oh i could go there hallelujah
[1:31:05] isn't that beautiful
[1:31:08] but now out of every kindred tribe
[1:31:11] and nation he has proposed a new
[1:31:14] creation
[1:31:15] he is the first of that creation
[1:31:19] he was god created in the form
[1:31:22] of man now by his spirit
[1:31:26] he is creating many sons
[1:31:30] unto himself god the creator
[1:31:33] creating himself a part
[1:31:37] of his creation this is the true
[1:31:41] revelation of god
[1:31:47] satan's the one that came up with the
[1:31:48] religion
[1:31:51] satan's the one that came up with
[1:31:54] denominations in churches and
[1:31:57] dogmas and creeds and and
[1:32:00] i'm this and i'm that i'm methodist
[1:32:03] presbyterian baptist
[1:32:05] catholic pentecostal they're blasphemous
[1:32:10] names
[1:32:12] they've all got a program
[1:32:16] to produce something and they produce a
[1:32:19] spirit
[1:32:21] but when you're re-created
[1:32:24] you're recreated by the spirit of god
[1:32:28] that's the only thing you know i
[1:32:31] i know what it's like to be a hot head
[1:32:35] you have a temper that
[1:32:38] that was you know that was the
[1:32:42] what was in the old man
[1:32:45] you know i i came i i got in a little
[1:32:49] fight with the fella
[1:32:51] and he was a lot bigger guy than i was
[1:32:53] but
[1:32:54] somehow we got on the ground and and i
[1:32:57] i was on top of him and he bit me
[1:33:02] you know i mean i'd have bit myself i
[1:33:04] think
[1:33:05] but he bit me up you know on the on the
[1:33:08] you know i was kneeling on his shoulders
[1:33:10] and he reached over and bit me on the
[1:33:12] inside of my leg
[1:33:13] and i i it hurt and it made me so angry
[1:33:19] that i grabbed the lunch pail
[1:33:22] and in a rage an insanity
[1:33:26] i could have killed that kid if somebody
[1:33:30] didn't get to me
[1:33:31] and drag them off of me and i was
[1:33:35] foaming and i was angry and i was
[1:33:37] totally beside myself
[1:33:39] it was nothing but a spirit
[1:33:43] it was just the hand of god that i i
[1:33:46] don't have that in my life
[1:33:52] but you talk about
[1:33:57] having to be something else has to come
[1:34:01] in there
[1:34:09] this is the true revelation of god
[1:34:13] that was his purpose
[1:34:16] this purpose took form
[1:34:20] through election
[1:34:25] so god's purpose
[1:34:28] was he wanted to create
[1:34:34] a church he wanted to create
[1:34:38] a bride
[1:34:41] that's that what he was he didn't want
[1:34:44] religions
[1:34:46] he didn't want he wasn't looking for
[1:34:49] church houses
[1:34:54] he didn't want holy buildings
[1:34:59] he wanted a chosen people
[1:35:03] that he created
[1:35:06] that he molded
[1:35:10] that he taught that he formed
[1:35:16] with his hands
[1:35:19] they they didn't vary
[1:35:22] from the path they they didn't have
[1:35:25] their own program
[1:35:26] they weren't trying to fix the world
[1:35:28] they weren't trying to do that
[1:35:30] that they had died out
[1:35:33] to south and now they were
[1:35:37] allowing god to perform
[1:35:41] this creation
[1:35:46] and he already showed us
[1:35:50] in shadow and type in genesis
[1:35:53] that creation with god is a transitional
[1:35:58] process it's a transformation
[1:36:04] so in other words god didn't instantly
[1:36:07] take us
[1:36:08] from one to the other he elects us
[1:36:12] and then he starts the process of
[1:36:15] transformation
[1:36:17] so if we could ever settle
[1:36:20] on the on the fact of our election
[1:36:25] then we could allow the transformation
[1:36:28] to take place
[1:36:29] but if we keep looking for the trans
[1:36:32] uh the transformation to prove the
[1:36:35] election
[1:36:36] you're always in a defeated state
[1:36:42] you look here a while and then you look
[1:36:44] there a while you look here a while then
[1:36:46] you look there a while
[1:36:49] so we're trying to move away from
[1:36:55] the applying
[1:36:58] the transformation to the evidence
[1:37:02] of elections
[1:37:06] there's a process that you went through
[1:37:09] before the translation
[1:37:14] transformation excuse me the
[1:37:16] transformation took place
[1:37:21] are you with me am i am i up am i all
[1:37:23] into myself up here
[1:37:26] i don't mean to be this purpose took
[1:37:30] form through election
[1:37:32] that is why he could look right down
[1:37:35] to the last age when all would be over
[1:37:38] and see himself still in
[1:37:42] the midst of his church as author
[1:37:45] of this new creation of god
[1:37:49] his sovereign power brought it
[1:37:52] to pass
[1:37:56] okay you you understand praise god
[1:37:59] there's a sovereign power that's going
[1:38:02] to bring this to pass
[1:38:04] we can solve the question of election
[1:38:09] then we're able to submit ourselves
[1:38:13] to the sovereign transforming
[1:38:16] power of god
[1:38:20] because it doesn't matter what he has to
[1:38:24] transform
[1:38:27] all you have to know is he chose you to
[1:38:30] transform
[1:38:31] and if he chose you he's going to do it
[1:38:35] because nothing can stop it
[1:38:41] that's all satan tries to do is
[1:38:45] delay the transforming
[1:38:49] of transformation
[1:38:52] he just tries to delay it getting
[1:38:54] everybody caught up in this and
[1:38:56] everybody caught up in that
[1:38:59] even the angel coming to daniel said man
[1:39:02] i was on my way a long time ago
[1:39:04] but but i there was something that
[1:39:06] withstood me
[1:39:08] and i had a battle you know so
[1:39:13] don't let the battle get you down once
[1:39:15] you get your election
[1:39:17] secure
[1:39:21] his sovereign power brought it to pass
[1:39:24] by his
[1:39:24] own decree he elected
[1:39:28] the members of this new creation
[1:39:32] by his own decree he is
[1:39:35] oh hallelujah he elected the members
[1:39:39] of this new creation remember your
[1:39:42] members in particular
[1:39:47] if every member of the body
[1:39:52] and you say body in this scripture
[1:39:56] he referred to it as a race
[1:40:00] that that we're a people right
[1:40:04] we're an elected created people
[1:40:08] not of this world
[1:40:12] come from out amongst them my people and
[1:40:14] be ye
[1:40:15] separate my people and be separate
[1:40:21] oh don't get trapped in this political
[1:40:24] america
[1:40:26] do not get trapped in this political
[1:40:29] world
[1:40:30] do not get trapped in prosperity
[1:40:37] don't get trapped in those things
[1:40:41] let's put on the mind that was in christ
[1:40:45] let's rise up to our position
[1:40:50] in the new creation of god
[1:40:56] why defend anything that's man-made
[1:41:02] why defend the catholic church
[1:41:07] why why defend some man-made doctrine
[1:41:10] or some man-made creed or some man-made
[1:41:13] work
[1:41:15] why defend something
[1:41:18] that is man-made when he
[1:41:22] is making a new creation
[1:41:26] and this creation is brought forth and
[1:41:29] brought to pass
[1:41:30] by election all that you'd have to know
[1:41:33] is hallelujah praise god
[1:41:35] i've been elected
[1:41:41] by his own decree he elected the members
[1:41:44] of this new creation
[1:41:46] he predestinated them to adoption
[1:41:49] of children according to his good
[1:41:52] pleasure
[1:41:52] of his will by his omnipotence
[1:41:56] and omnipotence he brought it to pass
[1:42:00] how else could he know that he would be
[1:42:03] standing
[1:42:03] in the midst of the church revealing
[1:42:07] glory from his receiving
[1:42:11] glory from his bed brethren
[1:42:14] if he did not make
[1:42:18] sure
[1:42:22] oh my
[1:42:27] all things he knew and all things he
[1:42:30] worked out
[1:42:31] according to what he knew in order
[1:42:35] that his purpose and good pleasure
[1:42:38] be brought to pass ephesians 2
[1:42:42] 11 in whom also we have obtained
[1:42:45] an inheritance being predestinated
[1:42:50] according to the purpose of him
[1:42:53] who worketh all things after the counsel
[1:42:57] of his own will hallelujah
[1:43:01] aren't you glad that you belong
[1:43:04] to him
[1:43:11] so i i would say that
[1:43:15] let's just talk a moment
[1:43:18] about this election what
[1:43:24] what are the things that i know
[1:43:27] about myself that shows me
[1:43:33] i'm elected now we're not talking
[1:43:37] about the transformation that takes
[1:43:41] place
[1:43:41] after the election we're going back
[1:43:46] to the choosing process right
[1:43:53] so here you are in life just tooling
[1:43:56] through life
[1:43:59] you might be kicking the ball on the
[1:44:01] soccer field you might be
[1:44:03] playing baseball you might be a musician
[1:44:05] you know what i mean
[1:44:07] okay you might just be a restaurant
[1:44:09] hopper i i don't know
[1:44:12] whatever you are you're just going
[1:44:15] through life
[1:44:17] you go to church with mommy because they
[1:44:20] drag you to church
[1:44:24] i was an altar boy
[1:44:28] because i was raised a catholic
[1:44:32] and i was in catholic school and i
[1:44:36] figured
[1:44:36] that if i was a good alter boy that they
[1:44:39] might give me a break
[1:44:44] it's a good political move don't you
[1:44:46] think
[1:44:48] you know that maybe the nuns would stop
[1:44:51] pulling my hair out
[1:44:53] this is just the result of
[1:44:56] all those times that the the nuns
[1:44:59] pulled on my hair i was just going
[1:45:03] through life
[1:45:04] as we're all going to life and
[1:45:07] and i'm just going to take four things
[1:45:12] that i think are
[1:45:15] evidence of our election
[1:45:20] and the first one's conviction
[1:45:26] you know that's what the scripture says
[1:45:30] that the holy spirit would do
[1:45:33] it would reprove sin
[1:45:37] and righteousness so
[1:45:41] all in your lives
[1:45:44] you're just living your life and then
[1:45:47] for some reason in your life
[1:45:50] there's something in you that's a
[1:45:53] conviction
[1:45:56] when you are doing wrong
[1:45:59] you know it
[1:46:03] now you might not be trained to listen
[1:46:05] to it
[1:46:08] but because of your election
[1:46:13] there was a conviction in your life
[1:46:17] excuse me there was a conviction
[1:46:23] and an awareness of doing good
[1:46:28] and evil there was a
[1:46:31] consciousness in fact the scripture says
[1:46:36] that a man can turn down that conviction
[1:46:39] to the place
[1:46:41] that his conscience is finally seared
[1:46:44] with the hot iron but every elected
[1:46:49] seed has experienced
[1:46:53] conviction because that's what the
[1:46:55] spirit does
[1:46:56] when god's going to call you he's got
[1:47:00] some place in your life start to
[1:47:03] intervene on the path that you're on
[1:47:07] now this is before
[1:47:12] your knowledge
[1:47:17] i i'm i'm sure i'm not positive
[1:47:21] but i'm pretty sure none of you came out
[1:47:24] of the womb
[1:47:25] and at about eight months old looked up
[1:47:27] at your
[1:47:28] parents and said did you know the seven
[1:47:30] seals have been opened
[1:47:36] no but
[1:47:39] there was a time when you're convicted
[1:47:43] that sense about yourself
[1:47:46] that you realize that there was an
[1:47:50] awareness of two spirits
[1:47:55] it could have been when you were five it
[1:47:58] could have been
[1:47:59] later it could have been some time
[1:48:02] in your life but there was a conviction
[1:48:07] so now we're saying here's the evidence
[1:48:09] how do i know
[1:48:10] how do i know that i was elected
[1:48:14] i can look back and say there was a
[1:48:17] conviction
[1:48:18] that came in my life and started
[1:48:21] convicting me
[1:48:22] of sin i consciously was aware
[1:48:26] and felt it it was a
[1:48:30] feeling convictions of feeling
[1:48:34] if you can sit in the church house and
[1:48:36] if
[1:48:37] the preacher starts preaching on
[1:48:39] something he doesn't know where you are
[1:48:41] he doesn't know what condition you're in
[1:48:44] he doesn't know what you said
[1:48:46] and what you talk about but all of a
[1:48:48] sudden he starts preaching
[1:48:50] and it doesn't matter he could be
[1:48:53] preaching about the
[1:48:54] the sheep going into the sheepful and
[1:48:57] all of a sudden
[1:49:00] you're vibrating
[1:49:04] you feel every eye in the place he's
[1:49:07] talking about me
[1:49:08] and everybody knows it
[1:49:18] i've had people come up to me and say
[1:49:19] were you talking about me
[1:49:23] i said which part
[1:49:27] let me know no
[1:49:30] you don't know i don't know what's going
[1:49:33] on in your life i don't know what's
[1:49:35] going on in your mind
[1:49:36] unless it's a physical manifestation
[1:49:42] of an attitude or an atmosphere you
[1:49:45] create or words that come out of your
[1:49:47] mouth i don't know where you're at
[1:49:52] it doesn't look like anybody in here
[1:49:54] starving
[1:49:58] but if i saw you were frail and hungry
[1:50:01] then i could do it
[1:50:03] but that's what the spirit does that's
[1:50:05] what conviction does
[1:50:06] it starts working on the inner man
[1:50:10] that you're not even aware of
[1:50:15] conviction
[1:50:20] it's an evidence of election
[1:50:24] another ones what brother billy so
[1:50:26] beautifully spoke on
[1:50:28] wednesday evening was that thirst
[1:50:32] a painful desire an emptiness
[1:50:36] in your spirit that you long
[1:50:40] to be filled
[1:50:43] nothing can fill it
[1:50:47] it's a void okay
[1:50:50] it doesn't matter you could be raised in
[1:50:52] church
[1:50:53] and nothing will fill that void
[1:50:58] but the creator of that void
[1:51:03] because he created the void and he's got
[1:51:06] the plug
[1:51:12] look he created that it doesn't matter
[1:51:15] if you tried to satisfy it with drugs if
[1:51:17] you try to satisfy with alcohol
[1:51:20] if you try to satisfy with lust if you
[1:51:22] try to satisfy
[1:51:24] with sports no matter what you do no
[1:51:27] matter what
[1:51:28] praises that people heap on you
[1:51:31] down on the inside of the inside there's
[1:51:34] a hollowness
[1:51:36] and a hunger and a thirsting for that to
[1:51:39] be
[1:51:39] filled this is pre
[1:51:47] realization
[1:51:50] this goes on in your heart and in your
[1:51:54] life
[1:51:57] when the election
[1:52:02] and the purpose of election
[1:52:06] that god is calling you for a purpose
[1:52:10] the revelation of him living
[1:52:13] and creating his bride he's got to reach
[1:52:17] out to you
[1:52:18] and call you and find you
[1:52:22] he'll leave the 99 and he'll go after
[1:52:26] that one
[1:52:27] and what is he done in the spiritual
[1:52:29] realm he starts convicting you
[1:52:31] you start to get hungry you start
[1:52:33] feeling empty
[1:52:35] there's a painful desire inside of you
[1:52:38] you don't know what it is
[1:52:42] but that's an evidence
[1:52:46] that he's calling you now
[1:52:49] each of you individually can go back to
[1:52:52] your own life
[1:52:55] and and realize those desperate places
[1:52:58] that you were in
[1:53:00] you could have been a teenager
[1:53:05] you were convicted
[1:53:09] you were unhappy and you are thirsting
[1:53:12] and hungry blessed are they who hunger
[1:53:15] and thirst after righteousness
[1:53:17] they shall be filled it was one of the
[1:53:20] evidences
[1:53:21] that god placed there for
[1:53:24] election
[1:53:28] walk through the process you're just
[1:53:30] fine
[1:53:32] and all of a sudden conviction comes on
[1:53:34] your life
[1:53:36] now you're not so happy
[1:53:40] now you're hungering and thirsting for
[1:53:42] relief
[1:53:44] you're hungering and thirsting
[1:53:46] everything starts to go awry
[1:53:48] everything starts to fall apart you
[1:53:51] don't fit the harder you try
[1:53:53] the more lonely you feel on the inside
[1:53:57] the more personality you pump up the
[1:54:00] more
[1:54:00] social positioning you get the more
[1:54:03] charm you try to
[1:54:05] expose the more in with the in-crowd you
[1:54:08] want to be in with
[1:54:09] the emptiness and the thirst and the
[1:54:12] hunger gets deeper
[1:54:14] and deeper and deeper
[1:54:19] you could rise up the positions in the
[1:54:21] church
[1:54:22] you could be a trustee you could be a
[1:54:24] deacon you could be a helper you could
[1:54:26] be a singer
[1:54:27] you could be a piano player you could do
[1:54:29] whatever that you want to do
[1:54:31] but until that thirst
[1:54:34] is filled it will continually call you
[1:54:38] to your elected position
[1:54:44] because he wants to settle it with you
[1:54:50] he's not worried about your
[1:54:52] transformation
[1:54:54] he's already has that planned out
[1:54:58] he's got every gospel he's going to
[1:55:00] preach to you he's got every sermon he's
[1:55:03] going to preach
[1:55:04] to you he's got every word that he's
[1:55:06] going to bring you
[1:55:07] he's got every song that's going to
[1:55:09] bring you in tears
[1:55:10] have you ever been driving by the road
[1:55:11] down by yourself and have a song come on
[1:55:14] and before you know it you're crying
[1:55:15] like a baby
[1:55:19] can't even help yourself all of a sudden
[1:55:22] it starts cracking at your heart
[1:55:25] and you think man you're going like this
[1:55:29] and you're looking
[1:55:30] you hope nobody sees you don't worry
[1:55:36] he sees you he's the one that's cracking
[1:55:40] that heart
[1:55:41] he's the one that's reaching in there
[1:55:43] he's the one
[1:55:46] you don't care where you are
[1:55:49] it's how he works
[1:55:53] he had to he's got to go through the
[1:55:56] process
[1:55:56] of contacting you
[1:56:03] whenever you're chosen he's got to
[1:56:07] contact you
[1:56:10] it's the evidence of your election
[1:56:14] is but the method by which he contacts
[1:56:18] you
[1:56:19] and he reaches out to you
[1:56:22] you know you can witness to somebody
[1:56:26] but you're not going to circumvent the
[1:56:29] process
[1:56:33] because he wants the question answered
[1:56:41] so we realize there's the thirst
[1:56:44] and then he says in the scriptures
[1:56:48] he says my sheep know my voice
[1:56:52] and another they will not follow
[1:56:58] he says the shepherd goes before the
[1:57:01] sheep
[1:57:02] and they know his voice and the voice of
[1:57:05] a stranger
[1:57:07] they will not follow there's something
[1:57:11] in the elected that know
[1:57:14] his voice remember we just listened in
[1:57:17] the message
[1:57:18] first he said there's something about
[1:57:20] that control tower
[1:57:22] something about that thirst something
[1:57:24] about those that have that seed
[1:57:27] in him that thirst that that seed
[1:57:31] that's in the inside calling out
[1:57:34] to be to be birthed there there's
[1:57:37] something
[1:57:38] about it and there's something about
[1:57:41] that person who's under
[1:57:44] conviction who's thirsting they have an
[1:57:48] identification and a built-in
[1:57:51] recognition
[1:57:53] of the voice of god
[1:57:56] my sheep hear my voice
[1:58:00] and a stranger they will not follow
[1:58:04] it doesn't matter how many much religion
[1:58:06] was presented to you
[1:58:08] it doesn't matter how much philosophy
[1:58:11] was presented to you it doesn't matter
[1:58:14] how many
[1:58:14] social programs and and all these things
[1:58:17] that are
[1:58:18] coming there's not one thing that that
[1:58:21] will respond to
[1:58:22] except for the voice of god
[1:58:27] it hears the voice it hears
[1:58:30] truth and that truth
[1:58:34] begins to set you free
[1:58:40] a little bit of word goes a long way
[1:58:44] when you're under conviction and you're
[1:58:48] thirsty
[1:58:49] and you're longing for righteousness
[1:58:52] each of you in your life
[1:58:56] you had an identity with
[1:58:59] the voice of god whether it was reading
[1:59:02] your bible
[1:59:05] and then as the gospel came forth you
[1:59:08] heard the voice of god
[1:59:09] in the last day there's something
[1:59:13] that you know about that voice a
[1:59:15] stranger
[1:59:16] you will not follow i know people that
[1:59:19] heard this message
[1:59:20] they believed especially they live and
[1:59:22] forgot it all
[1:59:24] but they'll slay you before you say
[1:59:27] anything against this message
[1:59:31] they know it's the voice of god they
[1:59:34] know it's the truth
[1:59:36] they know it's the word of god they
[1:59:38] can't help themselves
[1:59:40] it's part of their election
[1:59:44] this identity that we have in our heart
[1:59:48] for the voice of god
[1:59:52] it moves on us
[1:59:55] and when you hear it there's something
[1:59:57] about it
[1:59:59] you remember the first time you heard a
[2:00:01] tape
[2:00:03] there's something about the voice i'm
[2:00:05] okay a believer
[2:00:07] there's still something about that voice
[2:00:11] to a believer it resonates
[2:00:16] it's like music to you
[2:00:20] you can't explain it
[2:00:23] because that's part of election
[2:00:27] my sheep will hear my voice
[2:00:30] and a stranger they will not follow
[2:00:33] there's no other voice that's going to
[2:00:35] attract them
[2:00:37] there's no other voice that's going to
[2:00:39] lead them
[2:00:40] it might catch their attention for a
[2:00:42] while
[2:00:43] but all of a sudden they're they're
[2:00:46] trying to get
[2:00:46] fed they're trying to eat this maybe
[2:00:49] they go from this church to that church
[2:00:51] maybe they go from this place to that
[2:00:53] place they're looking they're hungering
[2:00:55] they're they're thirsting they're they
[2:00:57] see things they're under conviction they
[2:00:59] can't be satisfied
[2:01:01] but when that voice comes
[2:01:06] there's an identity that takes place
[2:01:10] maybe not one bit of transformation yet
[2:01:15] maybe not one sin laid down
[2:01:20] the evidence of election
[2:01:23] comes before the results of election
[2:01:28] i want to make that clear
[2:01:32] he was working on you before you knew it
[2:01:42] he even planned your birth
[2:01:46] your grandparents your
[2:01:47] great-grandparents how that you were
[2:01:49] brought to where you were brought
[2:01:52] remember he has a purpose to create a
[2:01:55] bride
[2:01:56] that bride is going to be created and
[2:01:59] manifested
[2:02:00] by election so the elected person
[2:02:06] may not even ever come to the
[2:02:08] realization
[2:02:09] how that it was that god was choosing
[2:02:13] them
[2:02:17] but if you would reflect on in a moment
[2:02:20] and you would watch the hand of god in
[2:02:23] your life
[2:02:24] before your conversion because you
[2:02:26] couldn't
[2:02:27] have a conversion unless he chose you
[2:02:30] and elected you
[2:02:32] to have that conversion you didn't just
[2:02:34] walk up and say hey
[2:02:36] convert me i got nothing else going
[2:02:39] today
[2:02:44] no he was doing every little thought
[2:02:47] he knew where you had to be
[2:02:51] in order to hear he knew how to create
[2:02:54] the hunger in you
[2:02:56] so you were thirsting after god's word
[2:03:00] remember god has not left us
[2:03:06] he's still with us his purpose was to
[2:03:09] stand
[2:03:10] in the midst of his church
[2:03:13] having sons and daughters like
[2:03:16] himself a new creation
[2:03:20] and so there's this identity
[2:03:24] that we have with a voice so
[2:03:28] we we have a feeling of conviction
[2:03:34] we have a thirst which is a desire
[2:03:37] and then we have here
[2:03:44] blessed are they that hear my voice
[2:03:49] he who hath an ear to hear
[2:03:54] let him hear what the spirit's
[2:03:57] saying to the churches there
[2:04:00] he placed in us that hearing
[2:04:03] that hearing was there
[2:04:07] before you heard
[2:04:10] it's the process of the evidence of
[2:04:13] election
[2:04:15] that you possess these these unseen
[2:04:19] attributes that are working inside of
[2:04:23] you
[2:04:24] that you have no conscious of
[2:04:26] consciousness of
[2:04:28] because you're trying to view them
[2:04:30] through the flesh
[2:04:33] but he's not viewing them through the
[2:04:35] flesh he's viewing him
[2:04:37] through election in other words that
[2:04:39] he's working these things in you
[2:04:43] and let me just end with this fourth
[2:04:48] one that i wrote down here and it's
[2:04:51] called revelation
[2:04:55] and so we we we see that in in
[2:04:59] that that revelation
[2:05:02] is the ability to see
[2:05:09] you just see it
[2:05:14] it just opens up to you
[2:05:19] and so i could go back i could come
[2:05:21] through all the things
[2:05:23] that you've seen but one day you get the
[2:05:27] revelation you're lost
[2:05:29] that you're a sinner you see that he
[2:05:33] died for you
[2:05:35] and young people don't try
[2:05:38] to make it in on church teaching
[2:05:46] he still only has one provided place to
[2:05:49] meet
[2:05:50] man and that's under the shed blood
[2:05:53] you've got to know that all the history
[2:05:56] you have in your mind
[2:05:58] all the conviction you have all the
[2:06:01] thirst you had
[2:06:02] all the things that you heard are true
[2:06:05] all the things that brought you under
[2:06:06] one thing there's one thing
[2:06:08] that pays the price for that and that's
[2:06:11] the blood of the lamb
[2:06:17] you can't be a new creation
[2:06:20] cut and try to make over the old
[2:06:24] creation
[2:06:25] you've got to take the old man and put
[2:06:29] it
[2:06:29] under the shed blood
[2:06:34] you say well i still make mistakes
[2:06:36] praise god for the blood
[2:06:38] amen well we were yet sinners
[2:06:42] he died for us and if we'll confess our
[2:06:45] sins
[2:06:46] he's faithful and just to forgive them
[2:06:52] he's still that kind of god but all of a
[2:06:55] sudden you see now look at all the
[2:06:58] things you've seen
[2:07:00] since your election you saw the church
[2:07:04] ages
[2:07:06] you saw the pillar of fire you saw
[2:07:09] malachi 4
[2:07:10] 5 you heard the voice of malachi 4 5.
[2:07:13] you heard the gospel you heard serpent
[2:07:15] seed
[2:07:16] and you believed it you saw the godhead
[2:07:20] you saw it do you understand that that
[2:07:24] sight was in you
[2:07:27] because it was an evidence of the
[2:07:30] election
[2:07:31] the first time that you saw something
[2:07:34] the first time you got your glimpse of
[2:07:36] god
[2:07:37] the first time you realized there was
[2:07:40] another realm
[2:07:41] another dimension another spiritual form
[2:07:44] not just church not just the church
[2:07:47] family
[2:07:48] not just religion not just growing up in
[2:07:51] it
[2:07:52] but one day you personally
[2:07:55] had an awakening consciousness and your
[2:07:58] eyes were
[2:07:59] open to the reality of god
[2:08:03] and you saw that there was a god
[2:08:08] these are evidences
[2:08:14] of your election
[2:08:19] that once you can settle that you can
[2:08:22] look back and say wait a minute
[2:08:25] i can remember how he chose me i can
[2:08:29] remember
[2:08:29] coming under conviction i can remember
[2:08:32] being hungry and empty
[2:08:34] on the inside i can remember hearing his
[2:08:37] voice
[2:08:38] i can remember seeing now i can say
[2:08:41] all right i get it
[2:08:44] i'm chosen
[2:08:48] i'm chosen to be transformed
[2:08:53] i'm elected to be transformed
[2:08:56] i'm elected to be molded i'm elected to
[2:09:00] work
[2:09:00] i'm elected to have god i can lay down
[2:09:04] the fact of my election
[2:09:08] i've settled it i've looked at it i can
[2:09:10] see
[2:09:11] his hand of choosing me in my life
[2:09:15] how that he did it it doesn't matter
[2:09:18] how satan delayed it it doesn't matter
[2:09:21] the battles that you've gone through you
[2:09:24] personally know
[2:09:26] that something was working in you
[2:09:29] when you weren't even aware of who it
[2:09:33] was
[2:09:34] or what it was it was an
[2:09:37] evidence of you being chosen
[2:09:42] i i i've seen it in my life
[2:09:46] i've seen people just sit there all
[2:09:48] bowed up
[2:09:51] they're not going to hear one thing they
[2:09:52] made up their mind before they walked
[2:09:54] through that door
[2:09:57] they got so much ear wax in their ears
[2:10:00] and they got
[2:10:01] corked them all up and they've shut
[2:10:03] their soul down and
[2:10:04] they're not going to let one thing
[2:10:06] happen to him but you know something
[2:10:09] that old conviction comes rolling in
[2:10:14] they don't even understand that the
[2:10:16] presence of the lord's there
[2:10:18] they don't want to feel it they don't
[2:10:20] want to touch it
[2:10:21] they don't want to be a part of it but
[2:10:23] they just know
[2:10:25] that they ain't right with god
[2:10:30] they know they're not in fellowship with
[2:10:32] god
[2:10:33] they know they're living outside of the
[2:10:35] presence of god
[2:10:38] and they know that they may have 80
[2:10:41] years
[2:10:42] they may have a hundred years but one
[2:10:44] day
[2:10:45] they're going to have to meet that god
[2:10:50] and they don't even believe in them
[2:10:55] but there's something starts to happen
[2:11:00] and that old thirst comes
[2:11:03] it might start out as just being the
[2:11:05] desire to get rid of the conviction
[2:11:09] but it goes to work and it goes to
[2:11:11] working
[2:11:12] it will never stop
[2:11:17] those who are outside
[2:11:21] the kingdom of god that are elected
[2:11:24] they are going to be haunted with
[2:11:27] conviction
[2:11:28] until their surrender
[2:11:32] and if your heart condemns you
[2:11:35] god is greater than your heart
[2:11:41] that that and i i've watched them get
[2:11:43] thirsty and
[2:11:45] and they don't get down the road just a
[2:11:47] little way and they look over at the
[2:11:49] person that problem says what did he
[2:11:50] mean by that
[2:11:57] it works and then pretty soon you know
[2:12:00] what they heard
[2:12:02] as stopped up as they were they heard
[2:12:06] and then they see and one day
[2:12:10] the reality of their election
[2:12:14] comes to him and that's half of the
[2:12:18] sermon
[2:12:19] i wanted to preach this morning i wanted
[2:12:22] to move into the body
[2:12:24] more and standing in the gap
[2:12:27] and go through that but maybe by god's
[2:12:29] grace if he tarries i'll pick that up
[2:12:33] next sunday but
[2:12:37] if we're going to advance
[2:12:40] as a body if we're going to be fitted
[2:12:44] and joined
[2:12:46] together if if we're going to
[2:12:50] resume the position
[2:12:53] that he elected us for we've got to
[2:12:57] settle the question of our election
[2:13:01] not of the condition you're in
[2:13:06] he can fix the condition
[2:13:12] not of the sin that so easily besets you
[2:13:16] he can forgive the sin
[2:13:19] but answer look at yourself
[2:13:22] look at what you've been through look at
[2:13:25] how he called you
[2:13:26] look what worked in your life these are
[2:13:29] my ways of expressing it
[2:13:31] you might have your own ways of
[2:13:32] expressing it
[2:13:34] of how that it transformed in you and
[2:13:36] just take a moment and look at yourself
[2:13:40] look at how it is when you hear the
[2:13:42] truth
[2:13:44] you amen it's like you don't even want
[2:13:47] to aim in it
[2:13:48] and you're going
[2:13:51] it's just a here this is right
[2:14:00] you just can't help it because that seed
[2:14:04] is working its way out of that lily path
[2:14:08] that seed is pressing that elected seeds
[2:14:12] got a spot
[2:14:13] in the body it's got to take it's got
[2:14:16] gifts that are departed
[2:14:17] it's got things that's got to transpire
[2:14:20] in its life
[2:14:21] because he had a plan
[2:14:24] he had a body he had a bride
[2:14:27] he's creating and he's creating that
[2:14:30] bride
[2:14:31] by the elected this plan comes to pass
[2:14:35] through election and my
[2:14:38] heart's desire for every member
[2:14:42] is that you settle the question
[2:14:45] of your election
[2:14:51] look at the evidence in your own life
[2:14:55] of your election and when you're elected
[2:15:01] and you know you're elected then you can
[2:15:04] surrender
[2:15:06] to that election and let god
[2:15:10] take your lump of clay and start molding
[2:15:14] it
[2:15:16] he takes the clay
[2:15:20] all mankind lies before him and one lump
[2:15:23] of clay
[2:15:24] and the choosing's his
[2:15:28] and you say lord you've chosen me i'm in
[2:15:31] your hand
[2:15:32] how are you gonna mold me
[2:15:36] how are you can i i know i'm elected
[2:15:40] i know there's a purpose and by
[2:15:43] predestination i know that you're going
[2:15:45] to bring it to pass
[2:15:47] and so i know now that all things work
[2:15:51] together
[2:15:52] for a good of them who are called
[2:15:56] according his purpose and i can settle
[2:16:00] that question
[2:16:02] in my heart and the quicker that we do
[2:16:05] that
[2:16:06] individually
[2:16:10] the stronger we'll grow as a body
[2:16:15] and be about the father's business not
[2:16:18] just
[2:16:18] as individuals but of part of something
[2:16:23] part of a body members in particular
[2:16:31] but when the election question's there
[2:16:34] the membership in the body is there too
[2:16:40] and and we've gone into way too much
[2:16:44] individualism
[2:16:48] way too much non-participation
[2:16:51] and tell me that ain't the spirit in the
[2:16:53] land today
[2:16:55] it's the spirit of non-participation
[2:16:59] what do i have to do satan says to keep
[2:17:02] this body
[2:17:03] from rising to its potential how can i
[2:17:07] keep this
[2:17:07] invincible army still
[2:17:13] but she's going to rise up
[2:17:17] she is going to rise up she is called
[2:17:21] elected and chosen settle the question
[2:17:26] in your heart individually
[2:17:29] and then when you know you're chosen
[2:17:32] then you can report to duty
[2:17:34] and say lord whatever you have to do
[2:17:38] not my will but thy will
[2:17:42] be done children you're not too young
[2:17:46] to have god deal with you god bless you
[2:17:49] this morning
[2:17:51] we're going to baptize joseph this
[2:17:54] morning

[2:18:14] you have to go

[2:18:19] hour out of standing in the gap but i've
[2:18:23] preached myself
[2:18:24] under conviction so i've got to go
[2:18:26] digest a little bit of this myself
[2:18:30] tremendous book maybe you could get it
[2:18:33] next week and read through it and
[2:18:37] and uh tie it back to the sermon but god
[2:18:40] bless you
[2:18:41] i love you remember you're a part of
[2:18:44] something
[2:18:46] don't think you're not because you've
[2:18:49] been elected
[2:18:50] to be a part of the body god bless you
[2:18:53] brother billy where
[2:18:54] if you become musicians you could come
[2:18:56] too amen
[2:18:57] let's go ahead and stand and we'll have
[2:19:00] a word of prayer
[2:19:02] and those of you who
[2:19:07] need to be dismissed
[2:19:10] feel free to go and those who'd like
[2:19:12] your stay for the baptism

[2:19:18] we just

[2:19:30] brook supposed to spring up in a barren
[2:19:32] land
[2:19:33] and water is supposed to come out of the
[2:19:35] desert so
[2:19:37] that's why it looks a little barren up
[2:19:39] there but one day if the lord carries
[2:19:41] and it's his will
[2:19:42] we'll have a beautiful place oh god
[2:19:44] bless you brother good to see you
[2:19:46] i couldn't quite recognize you but now i
[2:19:48] kind of got you
[2:19:50] there billy's brother lord richly bless
[2:19:52] all of you this morning
[2:19:55] i hope you spend a few moments this week
[2:19:58] just looking back in your life and
[2:20:02] meditating just a few moments on
[2:20:06] how he called you
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:10] that you could just reflect back and say
[2:20:12] lord i know you chose me
[2:20:15] us pray together our gracious father
[2:20:17] this morning
[2:20:18] [Music]
[2:20:22] what a beautiful purchase price
[2:20:27] the body of christ
[2:20:30] and how you went out through life
[2:20:34] and sought your own
[2:20:38] and they didn't seek you you chose them
[2:20:41] you sought them
[2:20:44] no man seeketh the father
[2:20:48] but the father draws
[2:20:50] [Music]
[2:20:53] and or we could come back and find out
[2:20:56] though it may have been many years ago
[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:02] we could sit back and reflect of the
[2:21:04] loneliness
[2:21:06] the misery and the hunger the conviction
[2:21:10] that was in our lives
[2:21:12] [Music]
[2:21:13] how we heard that voice and how it
[2:21:17] resonated in our heart
[2:21:20] and how we started seeing things
[2:21:25] that we totally were blind to
[2:21:29] all of a sudden you opened them up
[2:21:34] and when we know that
[2:21:36] [Music]
[2:21:38] we were elected
[2:21:42] to be a body to be a member in a body
[2:21:48] to play a part in the body the mystical
[2:21:51] body of christ
[2:21:56] that we weren't called to be loners
[2:22:01] we weren't called just to
[2:22:04] sit on a seat somewhere and
[2:22:07] agree to a certain
[2:22:11] teaching or a certain doctrine
[2:22:15] but we're called to be lively stones
[2:22:19] spirit-filled about
[2:22:22] our father's business may that
[2:22:25] anchor so deep in our heart and father
[2:22:28] as we
[2:22:30] baptize this young man this morning
[2:22:36] lord he's come through this place in his
[2:22:38] heart
[2:22:39] [Music]
[2:22:41] where he's made the decision that he
[2:22:43] needs to be baptized
[2:22:47] and he needs to serve you
[2:22:50] and he wants to do what's right
[2:22:54] father as he fulfills the promises
[2:22:59] and the commandment of water baptism
[2:23:02] lord i pray that you fill him with your
[2:23:05] spirit
[2:23:08] and that you make him and mold him
[2:23:11] into the son of god that you
[2:23:14] so predestinated him to be and father
[2:23:18] that you'd place him
[2:23:20] in that body right where
[2:23:24] he can serve whether he be a commonly
[2:23:28] part
[2:23:29] a part with greater honor
[2:23:33] or lesser honor it doesn't
[2:23:37] even matter because the greatest
[2:23:40] watch we can look at the face of that
[2:23:43] watch and it may be studded with
[2:23:45] diamonds
[2:23:47] they may be gold-plated but if it isn't
[2:23:50] for that little main spring
[2:23:52] and that little spring the face of that
[2:23:55] watch is worthless
[2:23:57] and father no matter
[2:24:00] [Music]
[2:24:01] how a church is on the outside
[2:24:06] it's the inside of the believer's heart
[2:24:10] it's the movement of the spirit in the
[2:24:12] heart
[2:24:13] of every member that gives the church
[2:24:16] the life
[2:24:18] and father our desire is that the life
[2:24:21] of christ
[2:24:23] be our portion we asked it this morning

[2:33:46] foreign
[2:33:59] that was a beautiful setting
[2:34:03] on that day of pentecost the
[2:34:07] spirit of god coming down and in doing
[2:34:10] people with power and
[2:34:14] and as they began to preach
[2:34:18] people fell under conviction
[2:34:21] and they became hungry for
[2:34:24] what it was that those people had
[2:34:29] and as they began to explain the
[2:34:31] scripture to him their eyes became open
[2:34:33] and they received revelation
[2:34:38] and what a marvelous thing then they
[2:34:42] said what can i do how can i
[2:34:45] act upon this revelation
[2:34:48] how can i quench this thirst how can i
[2:34:52] relieve
[2:34:53] this conviction and what a beautiful
[2:34:57] answer and it starts in the second
[2:35:00] chapter of acts and the 37th verse
[2:35:03] says now when they heard this they were
[2:35:06] pricked in their heart
[2:35:08] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[2:35:11] apostles
[2:35:12] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:35:15] and peter said unto them repent and be
[2:35:18] baptized
[2:35:20] every one of you in the name of jesus
[2:35:24] christ
[2:35:25] for the remission of sins and ye
[2:35:28] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[2:35:32] for the promises unto you and to your
[2:35:36] children and to all that are afar off
[2:35:40] even as many as the lord our god
