amen let's open our Bibles to Ephesians the second chapter am just uh want to just fellowship with you you know our fellowship is in Christ and Christ is the word so our fellowship is in the word of God and uh we we always trust that there's something in the word of God that goes out and touches our hearts and blesses us and once again I appreciate you all coming out it something happened out there it was warmer this morning when we woke up than it is now so we know that changes of Ages we might be moving into the Ice Age okay it is supposed to rain and sleet ice and and the freezing rain Tuesday and Wednesday so we'll keep you abreast check your emails check the weather whether we'll have a good enough road conditions to have service Wednesday but we'll have something for you uh if if we don't have service here maybe we'll broadcast something or do something so I know that we normally jump uh in Ephesians 2 to the tenth verse for we as his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good work with God hath before ordained that we should walk in them we use that a lot because we want to talk about our predestination but uh uh we want to go back before that if I would have a title tonight I would call it the pursuit of the attributes of God the pursuit of the attributes of God so we want to go back to before where were we before we were foreordained that's a good thing to know you know I know there's a lot of people we call Johnny come lately you know but there's no son and daughter of God that said Johnny come lately they have a great Rich inheritance so let's read these Scriptures it says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespass in sin so what does Quicken mean Made Alive all right so who and you hath he made alive quickened who were deaf in trespassing sins wherein in times past you walked according to the courts of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so that was the description of the husband that you had that came to you naturally by your natural birth you were born into this world you came into this world formed in sin shaped in iniquity came into the world speaking lies you were United and married to that nature you you didn't have a choice you just grew up you you lied right away you know um he says that worketh among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the Mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others so that nature was what death death but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for great grace ye are saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless us this evening in your precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated you know I had uh so many statements and things that uh I wanted to uh bring out and read and and it just got so uh big that I thought no I'll just keep it I'll narrow it down we won't talk too long tonight on it and then we'll just pursue it in different parts later going forward so we're talking about the pursuit of the attributes of God and so we understand and we could take you to many places but we understand that in the beginning God in the beginning God created heaven and earth in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so in the beginning God had attributes that's what God had he had attributes and attributes were his thoughts so God's thinking it was his attributes his thinking was his word so it was in attribute form first or in thought form first before it was expressed so if you can understand that we we try to go to a carnal uh explanation so our finite Minds can grab it and so the prophet used in the Great story of the Masterpiece how that that the artist in his mind he had a thought and the thought wasn't expressed it was only in his thought form so him not being able to speak the word he had to go to work because he couldn't Express the thought by creation because he couldn't create he could only express the thought by the labor of his hands so he began to work and he began to Chisel away or we might say he would have a thought and he would begin to paint a masterpiece or or whatever he did but So eventually when it was done it it produced what that his thought was in the beginning so he had that thought he had that attribute after the the very uh uh idea that he wanted to express okay and we're talking about the carnal artist now or the sculpture it kind of expressed his character you know what I mean uh I I I'm not very musical anybody that knows me in everything but I I have a great love for music uh you know I've been to many piano concerts and and uh listened to many of the up and coming uh pianists that have won the different Awards and I couldn't tell you a change in a mood or a change in a beat or or anything but I love to sit there you know I'll just be honest with you I I for many times I had season tickets to the Fort Worth Symphony because I'd like to go there and I just it I marveled yeah what was in Beethoven's mind and Chopin's mind and and brahm's mind and these guys that could sit there and write all that instruments and all that work and put that together you know I thought man these guys were out there I mean you know what I mean it's just it's just hard but it had to be an expression of what their characteristics and what that their desire was so if we can see that in the natural nothing appeared in the natural that wasn't with God in the beginning even things that aren't right are the truth perverted so okay you know this man hasn't come up with anything really he's changed things he's looked at things he's done things he's taken things he's put things together and and many times not even knowing what the outcome would be thinking that they were doing a good thing and ended up being something very tragic but so is this artist expressed it he's trying to get forth out of his mind what that he envisioned so he takes things and he works with them and he brings it we know the story of the Masterpiece that he finally seen something that was such an expression of himself and what that he had in mind that it it it it it it inspired him to to bring it to life and now we know that God had thinking that's what his attributes were that was his thoughts what he had in his mind in the beginning at the end and what that he wanted to accomplish and what that he wanted to to bring to pass and and we heard this morning he said it's all one big folding of Eternity and that's all so everything is really the thoughts of God coming to pass that he had that's why he's Alpha and Omega he's the beginning and the end he started it he's going to finish it another king it's not like he's got to finish it's it's like it's already finished so he he he spoke it and that and it hadn't intended end so we know that what we understand in Christ The Mystery of God revealed is that everything that God was all the thoughts that he had all the Expressions because he wanted to express himself because that's what he wanted and he wanted to have Fellowship in that expression so in God was we know we're attributes mercy and kindness and goodness and love and Temperance and every good and perfect thing comes from the father above so we know that that he he wanted to do these things in him was a Healer in him was a a savior in him was a delivery he had all these things within them so within God what did he do he set forth a plan by his word by his thoughts he thought out if I could use this I feel so carnal uh talking about something so great because I don't have the vocabulary to express it but he thought out everything he was going to do and he spoke it and said it in motion and everybody had a place and a time in it nothing was going to catch him by surprise he was all-knowing omnipotent how he knew what it was going to be because it all came from him it's okay he has such a complete to another understanding of what's Happening there's nothing's catching him by surprise so in the original was these thoughts so we we know that what he spoke and what he thought and what he put in motion and how he was going to create the heavens and earth and how he was going to set man on it and how he was going to take from the side of man Eve and how that he was going to allow Eve to fall and and and how that all this was all laid out and spoken and that's the original so there's only one thing that you're going to be able to cash in God's economy and that's the original no bogus dollars at God's spot right so there there is something that's original that that that he had in mind now if we could begin to understand that we have a place in that that we have a part of that and so I uh to express that out to you I want to read a great uh some of these uh statements that uh that I have put down here that I think you will kind of give us uh a kind of a an idea of where we at so he says and this is in the identified Christ in all ages and I think this is the one that he spoke in uh this is the one he spoke in Birmingham Alabama he said the only way to know what he is today is to find out what he was okay so we know that he's what his attributes so the only way for us to know him today is to find out what he was so that's what we that I'm trying to say tonight that's the pursuit of the attributes look we want to know him right because we want to know God we want more of God in order to know more of God you've got to go back to what he was in the beginning what that he really was that's the only way you'll known the only way to know him today is to find out what he was oh aren't you glad that God sent somebody he could talk to could open the seals and could take us all the way back to the beginning the only place the church world can take you is back to the fact that you were dead in your trespasses and sins and that you need a savior oh Hallelujah we had one that took us way back then we can see the masterpiece we can see the attribute of redemption not just a price payer though he paid the price not just a reward for believing on him but to bring us back to where we were in the beginning because remember as we just take this real quick if we can the only way to know what he is today is to find out what he was see he said he's the same yesterday he's the same yesterday today and forever and if we can find out what he was then he has got to be the same today oh who spoke like this man who thought like this man you you can understand just by that one statement how this was a message a love letter to an elected people we don't have a gospel for everybody right we only have a gospel to those that have an ear to hear as I said this morning the the the the nominal gospel they're bringing it to the world to try to get the world to think the way they think so if the world changes they're reliant on the world for their substance and their existence they've got to have people God don't have to have people God doesn't create people he's already got him you understand that he already had the church before he ever created anything he already possessed the church he already possessed the Sons and Daughters of God he just wanted to all those attributes were in him and you were there and he just wanted to fold them out there so you watch The Gospel change now they have mixed marriages in their church now they have gay preachers in their church now they have woman preachers in their church because you know it doesn't matter because their gospel isn't determined by eternal their gospel is not determined by the beginning it's determined by the present now let me say that to you because we don't want to be determined by the presence we want to be determined by the Eternal so what that's what we're looking for we're looking for that original thought that's right amen so as we just read and he's the same yesterday there and now if in first John or Saint John the first chapter we find out here what is written he said by thee inspired by the Holy Spirit he wrote this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so you understand now that where what we're talking about you can't go you can't try to know him today did that sink in did you understand that's what the prophet of God told us now it's been laying there for a long time but for some reason it just surfaces up in the hour that we're in because we're at a place that we want to we want to know them more we want to go past believing to knowing can you can you understand the difference you think and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us may I break it down in the beginning was the eternal he wasn't even God God our English word god is an object of worship but he but there wasn't nothing to worship him he was just Eternal in him was attributes anyone knows what an attribute is in other words in him was his thoughts Just Thoughts that's his attributes then his word and a thought expressed is a word in the beginning was the word before it was even expressed it was a thought in the attribute in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word was the attributes of God expressed in him were thoughts all right that's a lot for a poor man to understand you know what I mean I'm glad I've got a Vindicated Messenger to stand on yeah okay and in his thinking he was to be God probably created angels first then he was worshiped he was God in his thinking was to be God that's where it starts in the beginning God created now he just right here is the greatest explanation of Genesis 1 1 you'll ever get fantastic and his thoughts was to be God in the beginning God created Prophet God said he created angels three be worship so he could be God oh I feel like a theologian it says excites me Church this message excites me I went through a period of my life where I just couldn't match up to it I just couldn't match up to it I believed it but it was just such a burden to to to try to live and live it and live it and finally I found out I couldn't live it he was going to live it for me [Applause] Nori that's all I had to do just just finally give up hey Lord I trust in your mercy I can't do it you spoke it it's got to come to pass let it come to pass in me any way that you choose to and then in him was attributes to be father to be son to be savior nothing lost something had to be lost so there had to be a there it had to be made for that oh I wonder I just sit back and what it must have been like to be in this meeting you couldn't have even grasped these things these people were so blessed to hear it and they didn't even know what they were hearing most of them were there for the Loaves and Fishes they were there for the discernment hurry up and get them preaching maybe I'll get healed but he didn't he wasn't preaching to them he was preaching to you tonight way back in 1964 in Birmingham he was preaching to you he was given this message for you he knew you would hear it so there nothing lost something had to be lost so there there had to be a way made for that to be a Healer nothing's sick so he had something had to get sick so he could heal it it's only displaying his attributes now you understand what we're into we're in the pursuit of his attributes so may I say it like this we're in pursuit of his thinking what was he thinking not like we would say it because I felt that way about myself many times but it's beautifully secured and and motivated by love it's only this play of his attributes now remember if you ever did or ever will have eternal life you had it with him then I'm going to read these statements from several places because what are we in pursuit of because if we want to know them we've got to know what it is if we want to come to maturity we got to know what his intention was now his intention was to have fellowship with us in his plans really he don't need our plan he don't need our advice he don't need our counsel VES he just wants to bless us you had it with him then you had it with him because Jesus came and Jesus was the Redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back from where it had fallen or went from oh that doesn't doesn't the breach just stand out to you between the church and the church ages he didn't come to hang on the cross and everybody feels sorry for him and as many people have recognized that he was God they got eternal life that wasn't God in the beginning that's how man preaches them but that's not how the word preaches them he come back to redeem us to bring us back so that's what we wanted we want to get back to what was it that he had in his mind of us to redempt is to bring it back from whence had fallen or from where it went from redeem it bring it back and you the way you look Who You Are who what your name is that was God's thinking before the foundation of the world and Jesus came not to save the whole thing he wanted to but he come to redeem bring back them that was in his thoughts before the beginning oh Hallelujah do you see that attribute there he wanted to he wanted to save the whole world he died for the whole world but he couldn't bring the whole world back oh how can you miss serpency that's the reason he was the word made flesh God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself the word God's thinking of how he would do it he expressed himself in Christ Jesus it was God becoming material now let's slow on that okay that's the reason he was the word made flesh see God was in Christ wrecking sideward himself the word God's thinking of how he would do it that was before it ever started me he he when he thought you he put your name on the book now he was going to have to have all these things come to pass he's going to have to have lost to be a savior he was going to have to have people sit to express this the whole thing from the beginning was the expression of his attributes he just wanted to express everything that he was and we said it earlier remember that he Adam could have never known all of him so God had a way a plan an expression of that and so all we are is we're a part of that great expression therefore he says you are the attributes of God you are the thoughts of God made flesh you say well what about my sins well you were yet a sinner he died for you was that at Calvary no he died for you before the foundation of the world can he ever get it settled you're not lost you're not going to be lost if you ever had eternal life you always had it now if you can grasp that attribute you understand if we could if we could grab a hold if we could pursue that attribute if we could bring that level of Faith down if we could bring that level of understanding now I don't mean for Pride I I don't mean for a self-glory in everything but to glorify him of how he would do it he expressed himself in Christ Jesus it was God becoming material now where you are now you have to die because yet just like uh snapping a picture you're a negative any negative has got to go into the dark room [Music] through acid to develop the picture to make you see what it is now we are now in the expressed image of him it's the negative has been taken where human life but we must go into the dark room down into the grave to go through the developing to come back forth in the image oh my young forever in old age uh defects in everything will be taken away now I want to let me just finish this last period then we are redeemed God's attributes right back God's material with Christ in the church just like a man and wife that's right Christ in the bride because it's redeemed back his thinking and his thinking is expressed out but you you say well you have to go into the grave you already were in the grave if you were dead in trespasses in sin don't miss the revelation of God's word don't get so carnal that you think I gotta go die in the grave so that would eliminate the Rapture you had to die you were born dead you had to go there so you could be developed so the thinking and the attribute could become out so to be manifest don't get discouraged with yourself you know Abraham didn't get discouraged he tried his own things but the bottom line with Abraham was who is the father of our faith if God promised it God's able to bring it to pass if God said it he's able to bring it to pass He's Able out of these stones to raise up children of Abraham that's what we are Lively stones so we we we we take these things and so we begin to there's so many other things now let's just take this here because we want to really grip this pursuit of what that we're pursuing so we're pursuing the attributes of God now the attributes is what produces the characteristics yes is that simple enough I had to even catch myself it was just like wow the attributes produces the characteristic the thinking produces the characteristic if you think that or you think evil or you think angry what's going to come out angry you understand so if we get the thinking of God yes the attribute of God the attribute produces the characteristic God's ability to impart life to don't work people they they it's what we're pursuing and there's we don't want to get caught in pursuing gifts pursuing manifestations pursuing self-indications pursuing Revival to pursuing trying to pursue to get what happened in the first year of change that back happening in this age I don't want what happened in the first church age I'm sorry I wasn't made to sit under Paul's Ministry I was made to sit on the ministry of the son of man in this age I think it's the greatest Ministry that's been on the earth since the time of our Lord Jesus Christ in fact I believe there was no difference in the two Ministries except for the Corporal body I'm Not Looking Back right because God's attribute never looked back it was from here to there alpha omega beginning the end he knew it would be he knew where he was taking us he knew he had a new Heaven he he knew we walked out of Eden and he knew he was going to bring us back to Eden Back to Eden so we found out that it had to die had to be dead right this is from God who is rich in Mercy am I making myself clear the pursuit of the attribute the pursuit of the thinking because you can't know him today unless you knew what he was thinking in the beginning because what he thought in the beginning is what caused what's here today to be I just don't want to handle tomorrow or the next day I want to know with a piece in my heart it's already been handled for me I'm not going anywhere that he doesn't allow me to go and I'm not going to end up anywhere that he didn't already plan for me and if I deviate into the permissive will he'll chastise me he'll correct me and he'll bring me back to his perfect will I want to take from from then this is from the scripture reading we just read I want to take from there a few or a part of a verse but God The God Who is rich in Mercy I want you to notice here the prophet the Apostle rather Paul who had made mention of this now you has he quickened who were once dead you have to quickened who were once dead dead in sin and trespasses walking after the things of the world the desires of Flesh and fulfilling the desires of the mind you were dead the seed had to go into the ground The Original Seed the original thought Christ manifested that because he came without sin right and he was the mystery of God revealed so we saw that he went into the ground so everybody wonders oh do I have to die to go in the Rapture no you were dead you were in the ground but he resurrected us so let's just follow this through it's beautiful in the mind what caused this change you see what caused it from one time being dead to quickened means Made Alive what caused it now you could take the temporal solution or you could tape the present day thinking what caused it was that you accepted Christ you came along in life you were dead in sins and trespasses and you recognize Christ and so you accepted him as Lord and Savior and you changed your ways I'm here to tell you the cost goes way past that just watch how he lays it out he says Made Alive there was a change from Death To Life there is no other there is no other thing that could happen to any person so great as to change him from Death To Life amen if he was dying physically he could be healed physically that would be a great thing but nothing so great as he was in the spiritually dead and God had quickened him to life you once in times Past Dead you were dead even many here tonight one time you can look back and know that you were dead but now we aren't you're you're and but now why aren't you dead tonight as you were then you deserve to be that way because you were a sinner but God who is rich in Mercy [Music] that's the thing God who is Rich in Mercy all these things that we were but God that made the change right there God who is rich in mercy God made the change yeah amen but God can't change so where was the change made Hallelujah let's just follow uh you know let me I just have such mixed emotions this just us tonight so you know I just preach you know someone came up to me the other day and says he said you know what everybody says you're a Maverick I said great and fine you know but I'm just going to be Maverick a lot of people said I wish I'd have been there in brother rem's meetings and that would have been great but but I am seeing the unfolding of his word and the reason I love it I know that's where God placed me is to be here and have the storehouse already laid up it would have been good to see in the discernment it would have good to seeing the Miracles it would have could been from all that but the 99 of those people don't even follow the message I'm so glad I'm in the day where it's made available and the spirit of God's proving that everything he said through that messenger is exactly the truth so let's go God rich and mercy so I'm glad for that he being rich in Mercy if he was rich in money if he could just rich in materials if he is but yet the greatest thing is being rich in Mercy oh what a great word that is how that we were once dead many and we were speaking the other night how that a seed Must Die everything around that germ of life must not only die but rot if it doesn't rot it cannot live it's rot completely done away with it's finished and until we get to the place that our own ideas and own thinking is completely gone and rotted away from us that germ of Life can't begin to live then the germ of life can begin to live so when we get away from our ideas we pursue the attribute which was his thinking then the germ of Life can live the German life hasn't been living the man has been living the their idea of the germ of life but if we if we could pursue the attribute we would find out what God's original thinking of us was because it's hidden Christ that's right and revealed in his word The Germ of Life can begin to live now we might I might inject a little bit of Doctrine here if you don't believe it all right that's just okay I do believe it I believe that a man when he is Born Into the world that when you're a little baby born into the world you could not have been there without being in the foreknowledge of God because he's he is infinite and knows all things and when that little baby is born into the world there is something in that baby if he is ever going to have life there is a little something in there in that child then that come that he comes to sooner or later the little seed is in him now if you'll take the scriptures plenty declare that now if you've got eternal life tonight we have eternal life then we always were because there's only one form of eternal life we always were we always were did you get it [Music] I'm not going to get it till I start pursuing the attributes of God Joe I'm not trying to pursue a Vindication I'm not trying to pursue a manifestation I'm not trying to pursue a recognition I'm not trying to pursue a sign or a Wonder those things we will do if God so permits but let us move on to perfection what's perfect tell me the only thing that's perfect the word of God the thinking of God it's perfect Satan's tried to pervert it manipulate it turn it change it but unbelief has never stop God the plan of God is going on just the same with everybody he predestined it to and there's nothing that he thought of that would ever be lost you might get discouraged sometimes at the things your kids do but just remember they'll come to it sooner or later they will because they were born with it in them that's why their lives are so miserable don't you like to have something in you because I'm going to read Because makes a statement that's wonderful you'll come to it sooner or later the little seed whiskey then he said you we always were and the reason we were because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that's eternal oh my we were part of that thinking we were a part of him when he thought in the beginning you were there he knew the color of your hair the color of your eyes everything about you that's where you started where were you when the sons and dogs shouted for Joy before the foundation of the world before there ever was a star your name was on The Book of Life there you were now it's hard for you to take that and bring it into this flesh and have that attribute of God change this body in this mind but if the mind that was in Christ be in you if the spirit that was in Christ be in you it will Quicken your mortal body what's going to Quicken your body is the attribute that was in the beginning not some good work it was the thought of God of you in the beginning being in that Resurrection that's what's going to do it I don't know if that's my place I might be come by the way of the Grave I might get a new coat when I'm not going to die if I if I die here you're going to stick this old Wretched Man In The Grave and you might dance around and sing I'm so glad you're dead it's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me you know it like that it don't matter because if I have a body waiting I'm not going to go here I'm not going to fall in the regions of the Lost I'm going to go to that place that he wants me to be until he finishes the work of my life and places me in his kingdom it's all predetermined it's all pre-planned the question for me is what am I pursuing we try to pursue a better life we try to pursue works we try to pursue we try to pursue that and we could ever if we would pursue the thought of God he would give us the revelation of it and it's transforming we're just about done here he says and the reason we were because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that's eternal I mean what a way to say it we always were may God let it sink into us and like as Melchizedek reteached received tithes from Abraham and it was allotted to his great-grandson Levi who was yet in the loins of Abraham paid tithes he was yet in the loins of Abraham when he met Melchizedek I want to speak on that over at the other place one morning who is this Melchizedek now notice that way back God knew this boy coming down he knows all things now we are part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only in the attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was in The Book of Life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were I'm saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from all this fear and scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God you always were the sons of God daughters you place yourself there too for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there foreign am I coming close to what I'm trying to say if you have eternal life there's a part of you that was in God thinking that was always there you were an attribute that's what we need to be pursuing what was it that you had of me what what what was it that that could that you had in mind for me what was it that you were trying to express from me what part of me I want to contact that part of me we use the word theophany for that God's thinking contacting the thinking that God had of us in the beginning if it was his thinking it's what his word oh I got a beautiful quote I'm not going to read it tonight because I've already got longer and I wanted to be but he said word meets word for which for when God had you in his thinking in the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well when he before he even before he even become material here on Earth before there was anything but but God you were one of his attributes he knows what your name would be he know the color of your hair you would have he knows all about you the only thing happened is when you being a sinner how many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you as a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like that was something in you that just cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then I know we have a great desire for fruit we have a Great Divide desire to see the hand of God move we we have a great desire to see great signs and wonders because we're promised those signs and wonders okay but we don't want to get there by something that won't live if we could if we can catch the life the life was to give the ability for it to reproduce the life of the church if its ability to come back to the thinking of God then you don't have to when when the attributes of what God had intended for you and if and when we can make contact if we could pursue that if we pursue that word in the light of the message of the hour what's happening is people are taking the scriptures and they're reading the Miracles they're reading things or reading about the days of Pentecost they're reading about the book of Acts and they're trying to pursue that and all they're going to get is the fruit of another age you might as well go build an ark yeah exactly right but if we can pursue that God's got something for us that's exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask or think that there's something that he laid in the word can this voice that came to us in this day was none other than the voice of God to speak those thoughts into existence in US because they've got to be there it's already been spoken it's already been finished we've had eternal life our names are written on the book we're looking for that hour that that we can pursue what it was that he thought of me I know we've touched on it I'm preaching messages like the real me and the real things those were that was just God the fixing our minds and again bringing us aware almost feeding us breadcrumbs but now for those who are serious with God those that feel a call in their heart a deep calling to a deep you're not calling for days gone by you're not calling for a restoration of what's already passed because I could I just read the quota we heard it this morning after it's manifested it's past I'm looking for the what lies in front of us that's what I want to be in pursuit of the word attribute thought of God that lies before the church let us move into that you say well how are we going to get there by the same way that God always does everything with this church by divine revelation faith in Revelation Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God our messenger said I am the voice of God to you now I don't care what anybody else produces I don't care what other churches do none of that matters to me but I want you to know as your pastor that I believe what God's going to bring to pass is going to come to pass by this voice and that's why we're more than happy to play tapes here because it's life now we didn't play the tape tonight but we read it so that you could see that he said it and that it's laid out before his plane the attributes of God are his thinking you are the thoughts of God what were you thinking Lord let this mind be in me that was in Christ Jesus he became me that I might become him what was he he was the thoughts of God expressed he became everything that God thought of him but you want to become what God thought of you and that's what I mean when I say the pursuit of the attribute we want to be a people that thinks what he thought we're not going to build a boat we're not going to cross the Red Sea we're stepping into another land another dimension another age called the bright age we're coming into a Capstone of perfect love God's got such a wonderful thing laid ahead for his church and you could get rid of the scare right don't say oh I'm going to miss it no I'm not going to miss it it's already predetermined for me because God is rich in mercy God bless you
