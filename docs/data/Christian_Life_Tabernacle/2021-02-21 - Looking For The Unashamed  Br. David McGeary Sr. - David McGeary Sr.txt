[Applause] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] when i am [Music] [Music] give me tears [Music] you may amen that's all we want this morning and many presents to come and abide with us it's word to speak to us amen we want jesus and nothing more amen by the time if we could just come and open our service in prayer [Music] gracious lord truly we can say from deep within us lord we're thankful to be in the house of the lord this morning lord we thank you for preserving us from the weather the accidents the incidents situations lord persecute us in this life the lord you've overcome them all and through us lord you're overcoming them once again lift us up beyond the heights of these pews this building even lord may we dwell in realms that only you can take us lord where we lord receive what we have need of here this morning lord it's by the quickening of your word and your presence here today lord so lord may we lay a thought lay aside all those thoughts that would hinder and and go before us and behind us lord but may you just dwell with us here in the present lord because you are the i am the great i am lord your word says that you're a high priest that can be touched by the very feeling of our infirmities lord so whether we express it lord in our in our songs and our whispers of prayers lord and just the unction of our heart lord you know what we have need of so we're here this day lord that you might work through us and in us lord be with those that couldn't be here this morning lord all the the family members and loved ones lord and even neighbors that our heart reaches out to lord that are struggling in this time and have many many problems but lord you've overcome them as we've said so lord we pray that you just be in our midst and lord as paul said that may we be zealous in good things lord he said even when i'm not with you and lord we don't have the physical body of our prophet or the lord jesus here but lord you're here in a greater and mightier way displaying yourselves in multi beings here this morning lord if we can realize lord that we house the very god of creation within us lord that we can lift you up lord by by us being lifted up lord we neglect even our own physical bodies and our thoughts and our things lord we give you preeminence then you have the glory we worship you truly in spirit and true so bless us this day lord your word comes forth we just lean on you ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen man good to be in the house of god amen will survive the weak we are here amen thankful that the lord has protected every one of us amen certainly welcome all of you the visitors and we'll certainly help you have you in the house of god but i can come for a psalm reading this morning wow one of the things looking at how this man prayed and what you know the sincerity of his heart and the things that he would cry out for and the things that would be burdens to him you know you can kind of see what that looks like to be a man after god's own heart what his desires were things like that psalm 141 is an example of this we'll be reading that this morning you know it's a beautiful chapter it's a real earnest prayer and there's there's so much in here really but you know one verse in particular just stuck out to me i i couldn't quite get away from it and it's in verse three says set a watch oh lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips you know and it seems like such a basic sunday school principle we learn from the time that we're children oh be careful little mouth what you say you know don't lie don't say bad words don't talk bad about people that seems like such a basic principle but you know here there's a man after god's own heart that's praying lord keep my mouth you know it turns out it's not so easy to do you know even james says that the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we god and therewith curse we men you know and really without a change in the source of the fountain we can't we can't control what comes out of it but you know as i was meditating on that it occurred to me that for people who are after god's own heart it's more than just about not saying bad words or lying but it's a daily prayer to keep a watch care over our mouth that nothing comes out of our speech that isn't his word you know not to keep us from saying something bad but to make sure we only speak what he would have us speak you know paul makes this statement you know in first corinthians 14 10 he says there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them are without signification you know we're surrounded by voices you know there's voices and narratives and you know all kinds of things around us you know that can can fill our ears with all kinds of narratives and and you know all kinds of uh things that we might say other than the word you know i know it says in john 10 that my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow but it doesn't mean that there's not going to be a struggle to avoid saying something that isn't first what he would say thus saith the lord or keep still i think is one way that brother branham said it you know i think one of the big dangers of social media you know for example is people have the ability to post any thought that comes to them give voice to any narrative and there's this constant pressure to engage in that to respond to that to react in that you know but as witnesses of the word we have to be so careful that we're not carrying a narrative that isn't his narrative liking something that he would not even have us pay attention to sharing or reposting or retweeting or responding to the pressure of say something you know you have to speak out you know there are growing socially accepted narratives in the land where there's constant pressure this constant expectation to add your voice to theirs if we're not careful it can become easy to fall into the trap of carrying a torch that isn't his being a witness for something that isn't his you know that's the just like david we have to pray daily lord keep a watch care over my mouth that what comes out of it is nothing but what he would have me say that's something that a man after god's own heart had the daily pray and how can it be any less for us you know the devil is constantly trying we're witnesses the devil is constantly constantly trying to get us to witness something different than what the word would have us say so in verse 3 said a watch o lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips you know i like instead what david says in psalm 45 1. he says this my heart is indicting a good matter i speak of things which i have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer i stand ready in other words to carry the king's narrative to open my mouth and let him speak you know we live in the evil age many voices lots of pressures laodicea to carry some other voice the only thing i would do is maybe finish up before we start reading psalm 141 is that other book to the children of laodicea colossians says in chapter four continue in prayer and watching the same with thanksgiving just like david with all praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak walk in wisdom toward them that are with that without redeeming the time let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer to every man amen you know i think that's some good advice from the first messenger to those of us in this last stage colossians has written to laodicea as well you can see that in colossians 4 16. but you know as i'm just was looking at that over psalm 141 that would be my prayer set a watch over my lips over my mouth that nothing that i speak would be different than his own narrative and that i would not fall into the trap of picking up another and making that being a witness for someone else's message let's just you know read that together again as so much in this prayer so much that we could look at but that's just what stuck out to me this morning i hope it's a blessing to everyone we'll read that together psalm 141 lord i cry unto thee make haste unto me give ear unto my voice when i cry unto thee let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice said a watch o lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips incline not my ear to any evil thing to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their dainties let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness and let him reprove me it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities when their judges are overthrown in stony places they shall hear my words for they are sweet our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth but mine eyes are upon thee o god the lord in thee is my trust leave not my soul destitute keep me from the snares which they have laid for me and the jinns of the workers of iniquity let the wicked fall into their own nets whilst that i with all escape amen god bless you may have your seats amen man let's sing this world is not my home amen [Music] oh this world [Music] a is through all my treasures are laid up some way beyond the blue all the angels beckoned me from heaven oh [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] many a ago

martinez's baby lena brother adrian wants to come and give a little testimony and then when he's done with his testimony we'll invite his wife and children up so brother adrian if you could come at this time and give us your testimony and then we'll sing bring them in and and dedicate your babies and then after that we'll dedicate a jeremy and nina's mudanda baby so anyway lord bless you very good god bless you brothers and sisters uh uh first of all um i just wanted to say thank you for your prayers all your love all your support uh during these times that we've been going through um you know my wife she's we've struggled a lot my one of my daughters has coveted it's uh it's been really tough um but through all this uh the only thing i could see is is your love brothers and sisters my brothers all of you the prayers all the support and and we've we've gotten through this this for me is a good day we're back we're back home with our family and uh um that's all that's important right now to us that's where we're homeless right now but we're home and with our family and that's all that matters that's all that matters to us and um this week uh this week for all of us it was it was a hard week uh but for us especially because uh you know we have a newborn just like some of my brothers and sisters and um we were we were home and it was probably the coldest night and uh uh it got really cold and we were sleeping in front of the fireplace because we didn't have any power so um we were sleeping there and it just got really cold and my wife were debating what did we do where do we go um should we go to my parents uh somewhere because they were losing power and didn't have any water so we didn't know what to do and uh it was really late in the evening we said let's go let's go we got to go somewhere we can't have the baby here my five-year-old my kids everything so we just got packed up in two cars and we went straight to uh my parents house where it was a bit warmer and um after that uh you know we stayed there we woke up in this the next morning my father-in-law went to our home and um the ceiling caved in the whole this whole ceiling some pipe burst and all that other good stuff that's happening so uh you know i was just thinking well what am i going to do what am i going to do um you know i stopped i wasn't thinking like god had has taught us to think and uh you know that's where you know that voice those those uh voices of the world start telling you hey it's payday you know do this do that you're gonna get paid your money all that good stuff they start talking about and and for me it it i hadn't been coming here lately and i'm sure some of you don't notice because i'm usually back there interpreting uh but i hadn't been coming because my wife was sick or whatever it was that i couldn't make it and when the further i got the more those voices those voices started making sense and i don't know it was brother david one of my brothers i heard a sermon here of that black dog in the white dog you know and that black dog is just you know barking barking okay yeah that's right and i had a loved one tell me you know what you can make some money off of this you know this is the way you need to do this do this do that and uh you know it started making consistent i said no wait a minute that's not what god has taught me he hasn't taught me to do that she said yeah but it's yours you've been paying all these years the insurance is going to pay you do this do that and all that evening all day you know everybody that was telling me this is the time this is the time where you get paid and uh i it was just it was just really stressful and i went to sleep like that and i woke up the next morning and i was praying okay god i can't do this i'm not gonna do this and my brother uh my brother hoel sends me a text out of nowhere i don't know where timothy uh timothy first timothy 6 10 where uh the the evil the root of all evil is money and if you wander far from faith and i'm just paraphrasing you're going to have griefs so right there i just felt it um like he has done many many times in my life where i just feel him you know come down and say how's your family where is your family are they okay and i realized where the roof caved in was where my newborn my five-year-old and my wife were sleeping right in front of the fireplace everything caved in and that's where i realized how much god has done for me and and and i just felt him you know and it's just this like this i'm sure some of your brothers know it's an overwhelming feeling and it feels so good and it just you just break down and god telling me when have i ever blessed you with money i've never blessed you with money and i knew it i knew it i don't know how that happened and in in many times i failed and i asked him for forgiveness because i we've seen his hand so many times in our lives me and my wife and we don't testify we don't give our testimony we don't tell anybody anybody about it especially you brothers and sisters that we love that you believe what is happening i have told the world about you know other things that have happened they say it's a coincidence that's not a coincidence it's never a coincidence and uh um so then i realized you know uh there's that white dog that that dog didn't have to say anything he didn't have to bark nothing i just knew he was there and i knew in my heart i knew in my heart that that was that was my father using my brothers my brothers all my brothers and our sisters with your love that's his hand and and i asked him again for forgiveness for not testifying or giving my testimony about us upon my wife uh not you know having to ask our neighbors for food wouldn't have a home um you know we another testimony where we i lost everything and there they rebuild my car and that at that moment uh if i was still a worldly man this was after i got baptized i went into the room and i started praying because they took my car i i would have never done that i don't know now i know what it was now i know what it was uh when when i didn't have a job um and i had a few dollars it's probably less than 20 that's all i know there was no 20s in there you know on the way to church i was praying and i said god what do i do i don't have a job but i have money here my kids are okay and uh and i just threw you know i threw in the tithing and and then uh after after service my brother huell again and and i called him and i asked him about that uh the verse that he said he said i don't know i just felt in my heart to send it to you that other time he he comes up to me gives me an employee says hey go buy yourself from a chicken or something like that and i said okay okay brother so i got it and when i went into the car i opened it up and and and it's a 100 bill and and i didn't have a job but in that moment i just felt someone just on my shoulder and i broke down but you know there's so many times in my life that he's done something you know the biggest one was my five-year-old when she was two weeks old you know i to just kind of cut it short we were in the emergency room and there was nurses and you know all over the place they were drawing blood from her spine and all kind you know fluids i don't know what they were doing but me and my wife i held their hand and we prayed they couldn't figure out what's wrong with it because there was nothing wrong with it but that that's our father and and uh and he's done so much for me and and i just i wanted to tell you because uh i can't i can't uh i can't just keep quiet anymore and i know you brothers and sisters um well we'll believe it it's not a coincidence and uh and uh even coming here um when when i was speaking to the insurance they said look we could schedule sunday ten to one i said just do it because i didn't know what i was thinking i said just do it and then when i realized oh that's service we're going to be back we're going to dedicate my babies uh um i didn't know what to do so i called him and i said i need to reschedule sir if you reschedule you're not going to see an adjuster until march and i said okay well you know just leave it man i'm just going to pray and pray and i asked god i said god i want to give my testimony i failed you so many times and i want to give it now and uh last night the adjuster calls me says hey you know what i can't make it can we make it between 10 and 12. i said no let's make it at one and uh yeah so here i am and uh you know and praising god and thanking thanking all of you for for the way for the way you guys treat us um you you guys treat us a lot better than my own loved ones our own people that where we come from you guys are always there brother david sister leslie thank you so much we've never seen we've never seen anything like this definitely for us it's the hand of god putting us here with people that love us and you feel that love and i can actually

little daughter back to you that she's a gift from you and we dedicate her into your hands this morning in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning thank you everybody god bless you sis god bless you so much [Music] amen do you love the lord this morning we certainly have been through a time of hardship i guess you noticed in the back we had a little flood here at the church and i certainly like to thank all the brothers that came over and responded right away and and uh was able to take um and get it prepared and we should try to have it fixed this week i know many people were without power but we still had a power within us that never runs out amen and it keeps us keeps us warm on the inside amen amen so we're we're certainly here this morning thank you musicians and and uh as we uh go into god's word this morning uh i i want to see how i can maybe express to you how that we'd like to approach this morning's service it's it's like a sunday school lesson and we're going to play a portion of a message today called the shame but as we looked at this in our heart as i begin to read it and it begin to deal with me i realized that you know god sent a message and this message was to an elected believer that had the ability within their heart to to use the expression read between the lines so somebody else could read the message and and read it as a sermon or look at what it said but to the elected it's written like a love letter and it it reaches down and touches you differently than it would so it has the form of a letter that anybody could read but there's a spirit within it the the spirit of it and that's what gives the life of it so it goes beyond being a abstract or a a a a a letter written in a book it really is a personal communication that the lord is making with you as he brings it to life to you in the form of revelation so as i begin to listen to this i begin to see in my heart and of course it brought me under a lot of conviction and i could spend the rest of the service repenting but that the lord is looking to see something in his children and he and and it's it's it's a characteristic that is in them that his children that they'll possess it's almost a way that he knows that that you're my children and we so many times look at things and say we know we're god's children because of what we believe but the lord looks at it maybe back a little bit different and he he wants to see something else in us and i thought that this morning that if this is true that you would want to know what the lord would want to see in you what what he's looking for what what what what does he want to see in you what characteristic what nature something about you that identifies you with him and and so sometimes you you you see that that he would see this in his children and so this message really to me was such a a a blessing because i began to see it that he's talking about and he as brother branham always does he uses moses he uses the different people through the bible but they are children of god each of you have a story we just heard a wonderful testimony and so each of us has a story each of us has a way that god moved in us god these were markers in time that we could look back and see that in sun-dried times and diverse manners that god used and spoke through these great men and left them as examples of christ but as he gives those examples of those men and we can't go into it all today but all those men had this certain characteristic that they possessed and and and so it's a challenge to us to look at ourselves and say do i possess this same characteristic this identifying mark of somebody that has really given their life to the lord and so it's a it's as we listen we're going to listen to this look i want you to see there's a great line of divide between the the worldly acceptance of something and what god is trying to accomplish and and as you'll hear him speak is very popular to say that i'm a christian but this goes to another level and and i i'd like to play it to you or for you excuse the word to you because you you love it uh for you and trusting that you would listen to those little things that and and what he's trying to say about the separation of the characteristic of his children and so if you have your bibles we could stand together and turn in the gospel of saint mark and the eighth chapter of saint mark and let's begin about the 34th verse to the 38th verse and and just you know just take the i don't know how long it is but i don't think it should be over 20 minutes or so but really listen up to it for a few minutes and take it to yourself and and say so if you could look at this as brother braham's preaching just think god's got his binoculars on you and he's wanting to see if you possess this great character so father we ask you to bless your word this morning lord i was humbled the other day by the love of the brethren and the beautiful men's breakfast that we had lord you know my hearts just so desirous of the people that they can just achieve the greatness in their lives that you have for them and father i played this message that was in the storehouse and i believe it's in season for this hour that we live in that your spirit's bringing it out to us as food this morning father are visitors that might not understand exactly where that work coming from or someone that's new in our midst and yeah i i pray father that if there's questions on their heart that you'll just deal with them that you'll put such a hunger in their heart to serve you and may they come to know that you love them father and you want to keep them and you want to bring them home with you father may we take your instructions this morning from your holy spirit we ask you to bless us now in jesus name we pray amen amen after he's done reading of the scripture and he says i want to take a little text from there to just be seated at that time god bless you amen let's turn in the bible the mark day chapter now just a little short message here i speak to you about the word that you're testifying about over there and so forth mark the eighth chapter and let's begin about the 34th verse to the 30th think in the 30th rest of that chapter i like to read what he said because i know that's true now and when he had called the people and to him with his disciples also he said unto them will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angel i want to take a little text from there to be called that call ashamed you know i like that whosoever is ashamed of me and of my words i'll be ashamed of him now the word ashamed could be also translated embarrassed you know something that you're uh you're faced with something that you're embarrassed about being ashamed that another thing being ashamed does show us that you are not sure of what you're talking about if you know what you're talking about and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about you can tell anybody that you're not ashamed but if you feel put out out of place it shows you're not sure you notice there's so much of that today especially on the subject that i'm speaking of ashamed of the word now he and the word are the same in the beginning was the word the word is with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever so whosoever is ashamed of me and my word and he and his word are one so being ashamed of his word in this sinful present generation i'll be ashamed of him now we notice today if somebody says uh uh are you a christian it's very much a popular thing say oh i'm a christian but do you believe the word of god lord said these signs shall follow them believe it all even minister space is a blush are you ashamed of saying of divine healing are you ashamed of the full gospel are you ashamed of your pentecostal experience that's being ashamed of his word that's his word made flesh in you so his word has to live itself out for every generation it lived and set off in the days of moses because in that day the bible said in hebrews first chapter god in sunlight times and divers matters spake to the fathers by the prophets and those prophets the church got all so twisted up that when those prophets those daring messengers of god come without church without denomination without an organization without anything the five kings kingdoms churches and everything when the priest was brought before they was brought before the priest they wasn't ashamed because they had directly thus saved the law amen if you notice the prophet in one sense the word in the old testament when he said thus saith the lord now watch him he goes right into the phrase of taking the place of god amen you notice when he placed out before him thus saith the lord he fell right into god and he acted as god amen then he gave his message which was god speaking through him thus saith the lord i think of the prophets of old when they come with that message man it embarrassed the kings and it made the people feel uncomfortable the priest even they would feel uncomfortable because they were supposed to be leaders religious man and one day the word came forth in that manner it exposed them and they felt embarrassed or ashamed and many times we see that not me too often today that man you say i am a christian have you received the holy ghost that you believed oh you see they're embarrassed about it somebody said you belong to that group up there that does all that that are shouting and all that divine healing stuff many times christians back up they want to announce if they got a denomination i'm baptist i'm presbyterian luther they're not ashamed of that but when it comes to being a christian that can take god's word just the way it is then they're they're shamed i don't belong to any denomination they're ashamed to say that they've got to be like the rest of the world represented by some organization now that's just recently come into that in the days of luther to recognize yourself as a lutheran a follower of luther well it almost meant death by the catholic church in the days of wesley to know that you had defied the anglian church it was almost a penalty of death for the anglins to announce that you were a methodist and the days of pentecost it was a shame almost to say that she was uh that she was a pentecostal because she was quickly counted a holy aurora or some tongue speaker or something like that now they organized went riding with the rest of the group now when a calling out time comes that you don't belong to any of it very popular sound pentecost very proper sample presbyterian lutheran but what kind of times is the time that you have to come out and stand for the word i don't belong to any other thing that that uh embarrassed jesus said now if you're ashamed of me then i'll be ashamed of you why would he be ashamed of you because you're claiming to be his when you won't follow him what if i said uh uh this little glory is he's my son he tries to who may be your soul what do you think i am it would embarrass me what is your son and that's the way that so-called christianity there's your name in the name of the denomination all night they accept the fatherhood of a denomination but when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word of god christ know when they embarrass they don't want to say yes i have spoken tongues yes i have seen visions yes i believe in divine healing yes i praise the lord i'm free from all organization i'm not bound out of any of that i'm a servant of christ oh my that just turned to pieces the other night a great speaker coming amongst the full gospel businessman chicago may i stop here just a minute to say this you excuse me but many times you think and i do too that what we're talking about the truth of the bible don't fall over amongst the people but if they are sometimes against it but they really don't mean it they're trying to find where you're standing as the story was about a bunch of drunks arguing that there was no such thing as christianity one man said i don't know where there's one at that's my wife well i don't believe it said come over let's all act like we're really drunk went up there at the house and done everything they could and she told him cooking some eggs and then he thought about all fours and you know better to cook my eggs like that carrying on the house they went over the other room fell down a chair they heard somebody out there sweeping it up not saying the word saying saying a little song to yourself must jesus bear the cross alone in all over the world go free there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me in this consecrated cross out there tell death shall set me free and then go home a crown of where there were all drugs that want to tell you that she's a christian see so i never thought this would happen but last saturday night i believe it was or sunday at night the great speaker i don't subject calling people's names but he's trying working exactly contrary i'm trying to keep that churches out of that ecumenical move and this man is trying to put him in there so he's speaking for the christian businessman which i suppose to have had the meeting in chicago and i thought it'd be in africa at that time so i couldn't take it this man said god finished that the greatest move the greatest thing than the earth now it's ever been all the churches are returning back to the catholic church to the ekka megaloo and the catholics will receive the holy ghost or the trap of the devil amen and this leader brother shakarian uh the president of the international businessman stood up and said after the man sit down says that's not the way we heard it the brother graham has told us that this economical move will move them all to the mark of the beast and the man sitting on the platform that he'll move it to the mark of the beast and said we're declined to believe what he says is the truth amen he said how many of you would like to hear brother brown come and give you the true cider that raised his 5 000 people they screamed and cried just come for one day one day brother carl williams called me upset brother ben for our way out through that crowd so they had piles of hundred dollar bills laying my hands to get your airplane ticket up here and back just for one day see those people that word is sinking in where sometimes we don't know it see but see when you're really no matter how much the world is against it how much the denominations are against it god's proven it to be the truth [Applause] the great hour finally strikes things like maybe we didn't think about yes it shows you're not sure if you're embarrassed so you would rather not discuss the subject if you're going to be ashamed of it you wouldn't want to discuss it hold back but how can a man who's still talk to a man a few minutes to not mention something about that love that's in his heart there's something that it happens you can't do it this is a must be that evil day that jesus was speaking of people are ashamed of the word and how the spirit of god that acts within them but when the truth is made plain to the people god then himself revealing himself through the word now any man can make any kind of claims and we've had it in these days where there's been so many claims claimed that it's been horrible but you see if there is a truth it must be by the water because they send me they had all kinds of things of all pouring through people and blood out of their hands and women on their backs was blood and running down their shoes and raised up their shoes and pour all out and frogs jumping out and hopping down the platform and all kinds of things like that there's no such stuff is that in the bible there's no promise of anything like that in the bible only said the last days the spirit would be so close to deceive the elected if possible [Music] but there's no scripture for that but when it comes to genuine and unadulterated word of god confirmed by god it seems to even embarrass the other group on the radical side there's an embarrassment about it but it's a reality to a man or a woman boy or girl who really is a genuine christian when god made the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost and you receive it there's something that settles within you that there's nothing takes his place when a man ever meets god not in some emotional workout some enthusiasm or some religious doctrine some catechism or creed or a dhamma that either is accepted for a comfort for himself but when he really comes to the place like moses did on the back side of the desert walk up face to face with almighty god and you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and the promise of the hour there's something it does to you you're not ashamed of it it does something to you now let us look now for just the next 15 minutes there's some people that receive such an experience but as i speak to you today not as a church or as a denomination i speak to you as an individual amen not because you come here to this tabernacle because that i love you and you love me not because of that let me speak to you as a dying mom [Music] that someday you've got to come to the end of this life amen i may not be there and another preacher might not be there but there's only one who can meet you there that's god and you you listen to it and not well my wife is a good christian or my husband's a good christian but am i right with god having god like that amen not because my pastor met god of course my deacon met god forever [Music] not because i shouted not because i spoke in tongues but because i met him as a person amen then you'll never be ashamed of that there's something that's so perfect and pure and true i played that just because if i could say to lay a little uh foundation here for us this morning and he's talking about being ashamed or or being embarrassed and he as he speaks that he's saying that's so common today and that's when i begin to see that he's looking and he begins to talk so i cut it there because i hope that you get encouraged i know the quality of the tape isn't good but even if you take the book and read it because that something that he's looking for in a real genuine christian is are they ashamed of me or embarrassed of me and he said and i thought that was good he said well how could he be embarrassed of me that's a question that i never really felt of asking you know he said if he you know if you're ashamed of me before men i'll be ashamed of you before my father and and so when you let that settle in a moment and you say what would i do or or what could i say what what would make him embarrassed of me or what would make him ashamed and embarrassed to identify with me so just like we claim that he's our father we would be just as embarrassed for if my if your son or your child did something and it was against what you stood for or they hurt somebody or or they got in trouble that would embarrass you you'd be ashamed of that because that's not what you taught them that's what that's not what you wanted them to stand for so the question is is if he's going to say i'll be ashamed of you before the father then i want to know what is it or what what would it be about me that would make him embarrassed of me and and i don't but that's the worst thing because we have to meet him on an individual basis nobody else can be there for us if it's him at the end we can't be we can't be ashamed he says and he says here he says and what then it comes to the time that you have to come and stand for the word i don't belong to any of it that's embarrassing now jesus said now if you are embarrassed of me then i'll be i'll be if you're ashamed of he said if you are ashamed of me then i'll be ashamed of you why would he be ashamed of you because you are claiming to be his when you won't follow him now if there's anybody that makes that claim it's us we have the true word we follow him after we're the elect we're the lady we're the one that's got the truth and so we we make the claim but then he says but you make the claim but you don't follow it and that really gives us to say because so many times we become so predestinated that we don't feel we have any requirements now so if you you he said that you're ashamed because you're not sure or you don't have an answer because you you shrink back now so he's looking for a characteristic he's looking for something in his children that he can say they're not ashamed of me they're not embarrassed of what that i'm doing so god's doing something in every age he's doing something he's got something that he wants to accomplish something that he's trying to come to and to to achieve now are we embarrassed of the way that he's doing it or the way that he chooses to do it are we ashamed of him of his word and and and i like that i thought it was such a a fantastic statement if i i could read it too he says are you ashamed of divine healing are you ashamed of the full gospel all of the gospel malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 the calling out of a bride are we are we ashamed of what god's doing are we are embarrassed about it are we a little shrunk back do we feel that god could have really done it a different way than he done it he could have been a little kinder he could have been a little more gentle he couldn't have it have been so fanatical it couldn't have been so far off and so separated from everybody else oh lord you could have made it a little easier on us you could have given us something a little uh less fanatical in the eyes of the world to stand for see that's what he's looking for i'm going to read a quote to you in a minute that i think will really seal it up for you let's go so he's looking at his children and he's saying are they ashamed of me i didn't make up god's sin and a messenger i didn't make up that god would use william mary and branham to fulfill the biblical prophecy of malachi 4 and 5. i i didn't decide that the ministry of the son of man in this day would come to pass by god coming down and veiling himself in a messenger angel to the seventh age i didn't decide that god was going to send a seventh church age message that he was going to come to the world and and call out the sick and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and preach the gospel condemn the trinity condemn denominations condemn organizations i didn't do that but that's he chose that he wanted to accomplish something now that's what he's saying are they ashamed are they are are they ashamed of the full gospel are you ashamed of your pentecostal experience and i don't mean to experience that of a denominational or a religious organization pentecost i'm talking about a pentecostal experience that you've met the pillar of fire you know god you've watched your nature change you know now that the temptation is in your flesh but your heart and your mind are pure towards god you can divide the flesh from the spirit you're not ashamed that that you've meant god and that that experience has had an effect on you i i i i just thought brother adrian's testimony was so perfect with this morning's message oh this is the chance you can make a lot of money let's go rip off the insurance companies no i'm a christian i don't do that i also love what he said the farther you get away from god you know people think they're going to go somewhere and get away from it all you are getting away from it all you're getting away from the body you're getting away from the fellowship you're getting away from the word you're getting away from your duty to be your part in a body and and fix one another you get a farther away oh praise god for the word that come out of our brother the louder the other dog barks and he begins to change your thinking you begin to reason because there's no text there nobody comes up and just speaks a word to you they don't even know it somebody gets up and sings a special and it just it just tears your heart out let me tell you something i might as well say it streaming was never meant to replace church it's that elbow to elbow that makes a believer the prophet of god said it's two of those stones rubbing together that hone everybody you know sometimes streaming becomes like that a filter that the prophet of god spoke about it gives you a filter that gives you a certain taste so you can sit there and you can get the gospel in a certain taste just the way you want to feel it but it's tough when that person sitting next to you is pulling the holy spirit down and then and you're sitting next to him and they're getting anointing and you feel the presence of god in the building and you feel like every eye in the building is looking at you i walked out of church thinking that preacher was just preaching at me the whole time didn't get too you know just thought everybody knows it's me you know i'm just going to stand up and say i'm sorry it's me then you walk outside and you get on the step and someone's walking out of the church man that message is just for me somebody else said that message was just for me and then somebody comes up oh brother david i really enjoyed your sermon the other day when you talked about this and this i said that wasn't my sermon who are you listening to because the holy spirit sits between the lips of the speaker and the ear of the believer to turn that word into food for your personal needs but he said he says experience that's being ashamed of his word that's his word made flesh in you because word made flesh in you because it's that i'm looking at my children and i want to know are they ashamed of this message the word that sent being made flesh in them oh we like to keep it right here this is the message this is the letter and it killeth it but the spirit is what makes it flesh in you and are we are we ashamed of it becoming flesh in us are our sisters ashamed to take off their high heels are they ashamed to add a few more inches so their dress doesn't fit on them like a hot dog are we ashamed to take off our our earrings and our our gold apparel you know there's just that little part of us that we want to get as close to borderline as we can yeah i'm a christian but i'm over here see what i'm saying is that why this is so important because we're going to meet him now we understand when he said you did all these mighty works but i never knew you because you were embarrassed about what i did you were embarrassed to let that word be made flesh in you okay and so as we come down he says so his word has to live itself out for every generation it's got to live itself out so he has a word he sent us something but he's saying now are my children ashamed of what i'm doing are they ashamed of how i did it are are they ashamed to let what that i'm teaching them be made manifested in the flesh well when god told moses to circumcise his son his wife was all man he said you're a bloody man what's wrong with you it became a mark now they may turn it into a medical thing and i'm not preaching about that but i'm talking about god looking at us and it becomes now a requirement hear me of what i'm trying to say this morning god is requiring his children not to be ashamed of him it's not it's it's not a choice he's saying if you are mine then you will allow me to manifest my word in your flesh you will die to your word you will die to your ideas you will die to all those things you will absolutely become one with this word and you will not be ashamed of doing so and so he goes he he goes on to say this he says and we read this she says so in trying to drive to separate and give us a clear picture you understand so it's not to them it's a two-edged sword it cuts going both ways well i want it to cut me first before it cuts the unbeliever so many people sit back and they love the sword that cuts the unbeliever and cuts the system and it cuts the one that's not living right and cuts the bob tear and cuts this and the judy the world oh they like that side of the sword but they don't like the sight of the sword that cuts right here [Music] and that's the side of the sword that we shouldn't be ashamed of that's the sight of the sword that when it cuts us and it exposes us and it lays us bare open to the world that we've got to go back and repent of something we were doing that we're not ashamed of that [Music] amen people like to kind of remodel when god does something to them they'll work in it real slow you know because it's like god convicting you of wearing high heels so you're going to go from those uh what do they call stetsos or stilettos or whatever crazy you shouldn't even have them things in your closet throw them things out i've heard they're a murder weapon but you don't cut down from four inches to three inches and then three inches to two inches you know and and down to an inch and a half you know okay you don't ask me what high high is if you want to know what high highs pick one of these real christian sisters that's been around a while look at my wife look at them that god's dealt with and the holy spirit's convicted them and you see that holiness in their life look at the way they dress as the scripture says it says you older woman teach the younger women how do you think that's a class you think that's sunday school 202 no that's their life they walk into church with their dresses below their knees you know not not so borderline that you know he said you shouldn't be able to see the knees standing or sitting every kitchen knew who we representing who we standing for joke you know and so you just kind of work it down there and so like nobody ever knew you know the real way to do it man praise god god spoke to me i ain't ashamed i threw them things in the trash hallelujah and so he says now when it comes to being a christian that they he says that's real popular it's real popular to say i'm a christian it's real popular talk about the bible it's real popular but when it comes to being a christian that takes god's word just the way it is then they're ashamed nobody wants to take god's word just the way it is everybody wants to add a little twist add a little what we mean this way i love it when you pin somebody down on the scripture the king james version that's the bible that i read from it's though i try to use the one that brother branham used but when you pin them down and they don't have any way to go oh the greek says you know sir galahad in the 17th century said that that word was asamosioso which means we don't really have to take it just the way it's written you understand what he's looking for what he's looking for in us the characteristic and that we're not ashamed to take it just the way it's written read it just what it says it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair be not ordained with gold apparel be modest shame-faced holy obedient oh because they don't want any of that you know but that's popular but that's not what he's looking for in his children he's looking for that real christian that can take it just the way and they're not ashamed i don't belong to any denomination see they're they're ashamed to say that they've got to be like the rest of the world represented by some denomination oh it's good if i can be represented by that i'm a baptist oh okay then you're okay the baptist despise or they used to everything the catholic church stood for that's right the literal body and blood praying to saints lighting candles purgatory having another intercessory between you and god a saint a pope that claims to be the vicar of christ on earth oh but nowadays they're ashamed to say anything against the catholic church they're not even protestants anymore they're daughters they change the name of protestant in for the name of daughter they don't preach against it they don't protest it they don't stand against it they're ashamed but the world recognizes and it's acceptable if you say i'm a baptist that's okay i'm a methodist that's okay i'm very but tell them that you follow a prophet that god sent in the seventh age that was a messenger that opened the seals and they'll all hate you why because that's the way he chose to do it that's right amen the word of god just the way it's written amen thank but we get to where we want to kind of make it easier to swallow you know well that's a big pill to swallow here let me shave a little bit off of it so it's not so big you know like cutting the pill in half grinding it up and trying to put it in something else can't take it the way it's written now he's looking and he's saying are they ashamed that's what he's asking that's the question that we've got to sit back and ask ourselves am i without even knowing it has the world system around me and he just said the world will test you it'll try you god will allow you to get in a place and a position that forces you to find out if you're ashamed or embarrassed or not i'm not going to do that that's wrong i remember i was just a young christian i i never thought it was a big deal it was just natural to me but i put some money in the coke machine when i first moved to montana and the crazy thing i you think it was a slot machine or something quarters just started pouring out of that so i took those quarters out and i put them in my little jacket pocket and the guy said hey you're going to buy us a coke or hey let's keep that for coke money i said no i'm bringing it up to the office and turning it in why that was just natural i wasn't ashamed to do that i wasn't embarrassed to take something that wasn't mine and you know it's i find christians do it all the time they buy something they wear at once to whatever event they bought it for and they bring it back that's stealing you know i never used to think about going throwing a trash can or throwing you know some trash bags in somebody else's dumpster till i had a dumpster that i was paying four hundred dollars a month for and six hundred dollars a load for and all of a sudden i didn't appreciate all the people that threw their trash in my dumpster i'm stealing their space see but we don't look at the word being in us the wake it was the way it it was in him as he as he said it here when it comes to the time that you'll have to stand for that word and and we make that claim so we we see that as we move forward that they don't care that they can identify with christianity and i thought this was a beautiful word that really helped us understand what we're trying to say this morning god has got his eye on us looking to see are we ashamed because he's if you're not faithful and little he can't commit to you much if you're you're if you're ashamed of the word that produces signs and wonders how is he going to commit signs and wonders into your hands that you don't take the glory for it he says he says shame he says now that's the way that so-called christianity is today if you name if you name it a name of a denomination all right they accept the fatherhood of denomination they accept that you've been birthed by a denomination that you've been birthed by a teaching by creeds and doctrines and a system they don't mind if your birth than that they don't care how you've been baptized that they don't care because really you're under one father the devil and one mother the roman catholic church he said that's all right they accept the fatherhood of denomination but when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word of god christ know they're embarrassed just think of that so where we as we come down and and we we just take a a moment to look at these things he said now we're moving into a little something i'll try to close here shortly but how can a man who is filled with the holy ghost how can a man feel full of the power of god and the love of god in his heart talk to a man a few minutes and not mention something about that love that's in his heart now see there's something it happens you can't do it so he you know he didn't say mention serpent seed he didn't say slap them upside the head with water baptism some people are so combative with the word of god they just really what they want to do is they want to prove that guy is wrong your doctrine's wrong your church is wrong what you believe wrong so if you're wrong then i must be right no you're both wrong that's not what he said he said you cannot talk to a person very long that that love the love the nature the spirit the joy the peace doesn't speak out to that man it doesn't even have to be in words but he speaks he he sees your compassion he sees your care he sees your concern he sees your willingness to help why it's christ living in you the hope of glory now he's looking at his church and saying i'm going to take my abode in a body of believers just exactly the way i took my abode and my son jesus are they going to be ashamed of that because we're moving up to a step we're moving to something a little higher he says you know if a guy can't do that if that love he can't let that love not even mention something about he says what's happened that's that keeps that this this is must be that evil day that jesus spoke of people are ashamed of the word and of the spirit of god that acts within them we want to put an intellectual buffer between the spirit acting itself in and make contact with the person's mind so they don't think you're totally a fool but i'm a fool for christ unadulterated fountain of love pouring out from within us the way that the spirit and i'm this is my word but to get what's in my heart expressed he says the word the spirit the way that god wants his spirit to act within you so his he wants his spirit to be acting in you now i admit it's probably harder for high school students and young college students to let the spirit of god act in you especially when you're with all that nonsense and all that philosophies and all the stuff and garbage they teach you know it wouldn't be something they just teach some old idea that evolution or something and you come walking out of class and you just say the love of god's boy in your heart he says you really know that's not true amen you know you know god's god's our creator the only reason they teach that is to keep you from getting saved you know i haven't mentioned it but i'm going to mention it this morning just like when this black lives mattered and some of our young people got cut up up in that oh we're not privileged white privilege i wish as many white people believe this message as black people do they are the most privileged people thousands and thousands of believers in africa in other places have got the god-given anointed privilege of seeing god's word i worship the god that's in you brother i have no problem kneeling and washing your feet and saying i love the god that's in you the son of god i worship you that's what brother branham said he said you are a possessor of god but just to get caught up in politics it's corrupt [Music] [Applause] i'm embarrassed for america i'm embarrassed for its politics i'm embarrassed for what's going on but i'm not embarrassed of god given the revelation of the seventh seal to any man no matter what color they are don't you get caught up in preaching that gospel so you can be popular in a little circle of people bonder free junior greek male or female we are all christ and christ is god amen thank you lord it must be this evil age that jesus was speaking of people are ashamed of the word and the spirit of god that acts with in them isn't that isn't that something now listen to this just as we move towards our closing and remember you might meet a spirit that would act like god you might meet a spirit would do this and that or the other follow it a little bit and see how it compares with the word of god amen i mean you come into this church and you got a picture here and you got a picture there you got a pyramid here you got a cloud there what's this you know what what have i stepped into follow it a little bit you think i'm ashamed to anybody check it out i'll be happy to sit down with the bible i talk with the head man of the whole western conference of the upc and explained the godhead to him and he sat and closed his bible and said i've never heard it that way i thought you even what do you mean brother random walked through your yanks for years and then so i got the opportunity to meet another great beyond the state presbyter way up there in the church about water baptism you know his answer to me was well i see by the scriptures that both ways are correct now we have a god that gives us options god don't give options he's not an option god it's not multiple choice he has a will he has a way and his will is his word and his way is the holy ghost he's not a god of options you don't pick what you want to believe out of the bible and create your own religion and build your own system and teach your own line of thought he's looking for christians that take it just the way that it's written and they're not embarrassed how would you like to get up there and there he is to meet you and he looks at you and says man you never did tell your best friend about me were you embarrassed were you ashamed of the way that you dressed were you ashamed of your long hair were you a were you ashamed that you were shame-faced we're supposed to live such a radiant life that people inquire of us what is the hope that's in you and then are we willing to stand up and meet that great thing he says follow it a little while see if it compares with the words you might meet a spirit that would tell you you are saved and give you a glorious feeling and you would shout and scream then when it comes to denying the word how can the holy spirit that wrote the word deny his own word that spirit must punctuate every promise of god with an amen if it isn't then you never meant god you've meant a deceiving spirit and the world is full of it today see what i'm saying is we've got to the place that we've so elected ourselves that we're not even on our toes anymore you know what that means right we're not alert no more we don't think no spirit can get us we don't think we can be deceived we don't we don't think that an angel a spirit can appear as an angel of and say i'm god speaking to you he said what do you measure it by not by the feeling not by the emotion you go back to the word of god and you measure it by the word of god now i say that because that's what he's looking for that's what he's looking for he's looking are my children ashamed of me are they trying every spirit to see where it comes from are they accepting what's preached just because of the anointing that's why he brought up the example of the full gospel businessman he didn't bring that up for because none of us were going to join it he brought it up as an example that people are going to get in the pulpit and they're going to preach things with great anointing tell you you're saved tell you you're elected tell you're the choice chosen make you feel glorious are we going to let our bars down we've got something to measure it by we've got to take you've got to take what i say and run it through god's word and if i'm wrong you're obligated to come to me and say brother you didn't say that just right and if i'm any kind of man and have any kind of love of god the first chance i did i'll be in that pulpit saying i said this wrong i didn't mean it that way this is what the prophet of god really said but we've elected ourselves to the point that we don't have to make a stand we don't have to filter the word see i really believe this church is heading for something marvelous yes sir god working in our midst baptizing and praying for the sick and people being filled with the holy ghost their lives being transformed getting deliverances sure we're ashamed of ourselves a lot of things the things we've done but you can't stay beat down forever if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you they're thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness stand up and don't be ashamed that he forgave you any man that says he sin not is a liar but we have a great petitionary before us in the lord jesus that forgives us of all our unrighteousness so as we as we look at these great things he said there was a man in a very scientific age by the name of noah he wasn't ashamed of god's word now he's going to start talking to us about the people before that weren't ashamed now what about us look at what noah was put into a scientific age that proved there's no rain we're in a church age that proves there's no prophets there was a man a very scientific age by the name of noah he wasn't ashamed of god's word god meant him and talked talked to him he knew it was god and he said it's going to rain it's never had rain but he believed it was going to rain and the faith that he had he wasn't ashamed to exercise it there's a difference in having it and exercising it embarrassed to exercise it in other words just to use a personal example the other day i met a lady and she was laying on the bed and she was thin and she had a covering on her head she looked to me like a a maybe a cancer patient so i asked her is there anything wrong with you are you sick and maybe she was worried about clovid i don't know but she said i'm tired well i just wanted just her to say well i'm suffering with cancer because i wanted to pray for him you know and i got the thing i had prayed for if she was tired i have a god that can give you strength i have a god that can renew you [Music] he wasn't ashamed to exercise it he took 120 years to build an ark when the world was against him he wasn't ashamed of god's word in his day god saved him and his household for it the how foolish it might have seemed to the other people but to him he meant god and no matter how scientific the other was that was contrary how it said it couldn't happen it couldn't happen he had meant god when you meet god that's what makes the difference otherwise you're unsure you know you know it it it and what did god do god commissioned noah to build an ark he meant god and god gave him something to do he gave him a message to share it's going to rain the world's going to flood i'm giving you an example of what to do a hundred and twenty years he built this ship they they they gathered the animals how they came and and and that was all according to god's doing but he wasn't ashamed or embarrassed to say it was going to reign because he meant god it came from god if it comes from intellect to intellect and you're trying to deal with someone in the intellect you'll be embarrassed you'll be ashamed because you can't intellectually explain this but when you meet god and you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that's the same pillar of fire that led to children of israel you know that god took this man from nothing sent him around the world and that he laid store food and a storehouse that we could feed on it and you receive something that's right he said it just puts me in mind of something like ourselves then i said to the people i'm getting to a spot i need more faith i think that's really what kind of where we're at that's what i'm home for now is to get a new burst of faith god's soul looks like when you pray for people you apologize mr devil would you please move over and let me [Music] nothing faith has got muscles hair on his chest when it speaks everything else shuts up don't go in mr devil you move out get out of here i'm a son of god now listen to this commissioned of god leave them alone that moves you have no apology to the devil nothing to do with him not ashamed of the word of god not ashamed of your commission not ashamed of who we are not ashamed of your commissions amen god wanted to accomplish something so he commissions men because god uses men he commissions men to carry out what he wants to accomplish he wanted to spread the gospel of salvation so in the upper room he sent him up there and he commissioned them to go into all the world and preach the gospel lay hands on the sick they weren't ashamed of their commission they weren't ashamed when peter went to the gate called beautiful they weren't ashamed to exercise silver and gold have i none but what i've got i'm not ashamed of now that's what god's looking for he's looking to see if there's something that it is so real to us the only shame that i am is i'm a branham that's my earthly birth i'm ashamed of my failures but as a servant i'm not ashamed i'm not ashamed of his word whether it's denominations kings potentates whatever it might be just ready to give an answer god calls for it let that sink in god calls for it he wanted something to get the children of israel out of bondage is that right and so what did he do he called for it he called moses gave him a commission and said go down there and set my people free take the stick he wasn't ashamed because he had a commission he knew where he meant god and he knew what god told him to do so he wasn't afraid to walk up because god calls for it in other words god is calling for you not to be ashamed he's calling for you to let the word be made in flesh he's calling in you to exercise your faith it's a requirement we're not going to get in on belief we're going to get in on manifested life it's a call of god in this hour to not to be ashamed to not to be embarrassed to stand up no apologies to the devil that's what god's calling for that's what he's asking his children to be bold and and and shameless carrying out their great commission and any disciple of christ who has come in contact this is paragraph 218 of the same book i'm sorry that i haven't been given the paragraph number any disciple of christ who has come in contact with him in redemption and salvation has come in to his heart he is a possessor of god what kind of life should we live and how should we have walk and how should we walk and how should we talk if god is representing himself through our own mortal bodies who could be ashamed of that you see what he wants to do right in this bride he wants her to be the last representation of the possession of god he wants to represent himself and now he's saying are we ashamed of that are we ashamed of what this really gospel is are we really embarrassed that he's called out an elect lady see we don't have power the police listen listen to this this is beautiful and then if i'm a christian and being filled with the spirit this is paragraph 220 being filled with the spirit wearing the testimony of jesus christ's resurrection wearing the testimony of jesus christ resurrection what's your hope he's risen how are you going to get through this he's risen he's alive he will not leave me nor forsake me he'll be with me even until the end i'm identified with him i'm not ashamed that he died for me i was a sinner he died for me he forgave me my sins he sent his spirit to lead me and guide me into all truth to correct me when i make a mistake to chastise me when i'm wrong to humble me when i get proud to lead me into good works i have a spirit leading me i'm not ashamed of that but if i'm not sure then i'm going to shrink back but if i'm sure i've got a fountain motivating me and he said how he he said and just to say this again he said god calls for it he's calling for us not to be ashamed or embarrassed of what he's done in this age and if i'm a christian filled with the spirit wearing the testimony of jesus resurrection that he is the same yesterday day and forever don't let any devil try to push you around and say you don't do this and you don't do that you do do it god has given you the authority we don't have power the policemen don't have power to stop one car sometimes they have four or 500 horsepower motor what could he do about it but he's got the authority and that's the church we have authority by the resurrection of jesus christ and his promised word hallelujah that the things that i do shall you do also and more than this will you do for i go unto the father are we ashamed or embarrassed to step up to the manifestation of god's word promised in this hour he didn't call us out so we could all say that god sent us a prophet he took the prophet to call us out to give us the word and to prepare us that that spirit might be able to enter into us with pure representation and do the works that he did also the proof of the resurrection if we leave them in pictures and we leave them in books everybody's got that idea but when he's not ashamed of his bride and he wants to identify himself in her and he's looking and he's saying i want to come into your life i want to identify my faith my resurrection power i want to manifest myself in you are you ashamed if i do that noah wasn't ashamed moses wasn't ashamed david wasn't ashamed samson wasn't ashamed no are we ashamed are we embarrassed because if we let him live in us we are going to be so fanatical to the world but yet he said how can a man be with something god's calling for it he's calling for us not to be ashamed and i know all kinds of things go through your mind oh do i just walk up and and say this let me tell you something god presents the situation he creates the situation you don't just like at the fair when that guy just kept saying the story of noah wasn't true and all this stuff jonah and he said i just couldn't take it no more god created that situation you don't have to go out and create it he'll create it for you he'll put you in the place god called moses and put moses in the spot that he had to stand in front of pharaoh moses didn't do that moses didn't say hey these are god's people he's got a place over here let him go no god he didn't create the situation god created it and that's what he's saying the world's gonna try you god is going to create situations in your life where you're going to have to stand for the word he calls for it just like he said let there be light he called for light just like he said a real believer separates himself from unbelief he called for it he called for the separation and now he's calling for a people that will stand up and not be ashamed it's our challenge church it's the challenge that we're facing right now not to be ashamed of the leadership not to be ashamed of fresh revelation that changes your life and to move forward amen that close with this this morning he says way back in the jungles of africa on safari hunters they had to take high-powered radios to hear elvis presley and pat boone and them guys with the rock and roll and twist and the natives trying to see them act along jerking their heads and acting like that the natives stood and looked at it but you see they're not americans like pat boone and elvis presley and ricky nelson and them guys are they're not judases of that type but you see it's a spirit and the spirit is not only in america it has spread itself out over the world to bring them to the battle of armageddon and they act like that what they are whatever nation they come from africa india whatever it is the vulgar stuff has spread all over the earth but just one man started it so the gospel and the power of the almighty god has sped around the world and the separating time is now taking place when god is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church let me be part of the bride when the calling out comes are we embarrassed does it make sense to somebody no no not if someone thinks that they're 100 percent but i'll tell you that elected they're hungering for more of god so and and i want to say this in closing god's calling for it it's a requirement of his bride not to be ashamed you will find yourself in more situations than you've ever found yourself before to make a stand be humble be sweet let the love of god be shed abroad in your heart we're not combative we're not trying to prove anything wrong but we've meant god amen and the truth is the truth amen and it's by grace he's opened our hearts and eyes and now he says this is what i've done for you i've revealed to you my word in its day because it had to be manifested i let you see it in the word of god that god sent a prophet messenger the seventh church age angel the fulfillment of malachi 4 5. i've let you see that i've opened to you the seals and showed you the church history not the history part man had already known that but the spirit moving in the church that's what they didn't see they could all see luther wesley they could see all those things they could see those things but what they couldn't see is the spirit but he revealed that to you and now he wants what he's done living in us the last voice and he's asking us and he's looking at us and saying i'm requiring you not to be ashamed this is what i'm looking for i'm looking for this characteristic that was in moses that was in john the baptist that was in david that was in saul and samson i'm looking for that same boldness because you've meant god i'm looking for a church that's not ashamed of the commission that god's given them and i know you might look at yourself and see you're not able but let me say have a meeting with them there's people that nobody else can touch but you be yourself you don't have to produce wool you bear wool but let's never be ashamed of what god has called us and showed us and i want to emphasize this in closing now he's looking to see who's not ashamed he's calling us to that place where we're not embarrassed of this message or this word and i believe that the blessings that follow are going to be unspeakable amen let's stand in this powerheads this morning if in your heart you may have felt that maybe you've shrunk back a little bit or you feel that you might have not taken advantage of an opportunity that was presented to you or you got so busy with the cares of your life that you haven't even thought of sowing a seed or doing a work for the kingdom and you know that's not your heart but you'd like this morning to say lord i'd like to be a little bolder maybe not just with the words that flow out of my mouth but i want to be a little bolder in my decisions i want to be a little bolder in my actions i want to stand up strong with my shoulders back and as a representative of the resurrection the testimony of the resurrection living in me that i become a portion of god and i'm not ashamed of that just that statement alone the the world would cringe at that it was even spoken that someone would even say such a thing as that but yet lord it's it's so true and father we just we want to take our place we want to accept our privilege we want to stand proud and unashamed because that's what you're looking for [Music] because you said if you're ashamed of me before men then i'll be ashamed of you because you professed to follow me you profess that you represented me and you never stood for the truth and you were embarrassed lord i don't want to meet that day lord i ask that you help me be obedient to your word let you help me free myself from the world father and allow you to make the changes in my heart and in my life that are necessary for me to become more like you father if there's any they'd like to lift their hand and have a request for a more consecrated and more dedicated life father there's any here this morning that might need prayer maybe they're sick in their bodies or their spirits are wore down and the enemies just beat them to a pulp and they just don't feel like they have the joy of the lord father we invite them this morning that we could pray with them and we can't do the work father but we can join together and ask you to do it lord i just ask that we realize that there's a great responsibility that you're placing on the church

this morning thanking you for letting us see forgiving us i sav and giving us white reign of it for giving us gold tried in fire and we stand here this morning with our hearts lifted up to you asking
