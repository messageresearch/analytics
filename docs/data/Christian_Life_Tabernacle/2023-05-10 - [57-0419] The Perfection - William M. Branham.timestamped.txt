[11:56] father may we have receptive heart and
[11:59] ear
[12:01] Lord
[12:04] what a great Foundation that we stand on
[12:08] we just ask that you'd bless us tonight
[12:11] we pray in your precious and holy name
[12:14] amen
[12:18] you know tonight
[12:20] um I was really enjoyed
[12:24] Sunday evening service and uh David Jr
[12:29] brought to us
[12:32] out of Galatians you know and the great
[12:35] thing that you know we started in the
[12:37] spirit now are we perfected by the flesh
[12:40] and uh I was led to this tape that
[12:45] brother Branham preached and
[12:48] and I I listened to it and and then I
[12:51] listened to it again and again I just
[12:54] felt in my heart
[12:56] uh
[12:57] I just never had Satan fight me so bad
[13:00] on playing a tape
[13:02] and then I realized why
[13:04] because this is the foundation
[13:08] of
[13:10] every Christian experience
[13:13] as you listen to brother Brandon preach
[13:17] he said that God provided a way
[13:19] and there's only one provided place of
[13:22] worship
[13:24] so we're going to listen to one hour
[13:28] of the message called perfection
[13:32] it is
[13:35] it is ABC's
[13:38] if I could say it this way at its best
[13:41] it is the description
[13:44] and the foundation
[13:47] of every real Christian experience
[13:52] prophet of God said that people end up
[13:55] wrong because they don't start out right
[13:59] you've got to start
[14:02] here
[14:03] in this tape tonight as you listen to it
[14:07] this is the starting place
[14:11] of of every Christian experience
[14:15] every Christian Journey
[14:17] everything that's laid out before us
[14:21] that we're going to come to go through
[14:24] all has to be tied back to what is being
[14:28] taught here I believe it'll be a
[14:31] blessing to you
[14:33] there's no no discernment in it that uh
[14:37] it's very
[14:39] it's a teaching tape it's real
[14:43] straightforward it's scripturally
[14:45] anchored and I believe that it'll be a
[14:49] real blessing if you take the time to
[14:54] listen to what's being said so we're
[14:57] just going to have the Brother start it
[14:58] they're going to start playing it at the
[15:01] scripture and then the minute the
[15:03] prophet of God's done reading the
[15:06] scripture uh you may be seated uh
[15:11] and uh I I believe that he's going to
[15:16] start in the Book of Matthew the fourth
[15:19] chapter and the
[15:21] 47th and 48th verse so Lord bless you uh
[15:27] the words true
[15:29] amen the words true I I really hope that
[15:33] you take this to heart this evening
[15:36] um
[15:37] um
[15:37] I'm I'm trusting the Lord that my
[15:40] brother Dennis will be with us this
[15:42] coming weekend to preach for us I was
[15:46] going to preach tonight but this was so
[15:49] heavy on my heart I thought I've just
[15:51] got to play this so I know you love your
[15:54] messenger
[15:55] uh this is perfection
[15:59] 1957. Lord bless you tonight as you
[16:02] listen to the word of Truth
[16:07] tonight that we are celebrating
[16:10] of the crucifixion of our blessed Lord
[16:14] I wish to read the night from his own
[16:17] precious lips the words that he has
[16:21] had written in his book in Saint
[16:25] Matthews the fourth chapter we and the
[16:29] 47th and 48th verse we read this
[16:35] and it's you salute your brethren only
[16:39] what do you more than others do not even
[16:43] the public and soul
[16:45] but be ye therefore perfect even as your
[16:51] father which is in heaven is perfect
[16:55] and tonight we gave out that we were
[16:58] going to speak on the subject of
[17:01] perfection
[17:03] now we that seems like a very strange
[17:08] text to take for the night of the
[17:10] crucifixion
[17:12] of Our Lord but today perhaps you've
[17:15] been listening to the radio and hear the
[17:18] different messages and The Messengers
[17:20] how they presented that great awful day
[17:24] when our Lord died for the sins of the
[17:28] world so I have chosen tonight to go
[17:31] around a different way to get to it
[17:35] so it would be a little different and
[17:38] might refreshing you a little and may
[17:40] the Blessed Holy Spirit Inspire the word
[17:43] now as we take the effort to bring it
[17:48] God
[17:50] requires Perfection we want to bear that
[17:54] in mind
[17:56] that there's nothing just part way
[18:00] can go in the presence of God it must be
[18:04] perfect
[18:06] or worship everything
[18:09] I am in the Garden of Eden
[18:12] God had Adam and Eve in the garden
[18:16] and they sinned and transgressed the
[18:20] laws of God
[18:22] by sinning disobedience
[18:25] and when transgression comes
[18:28] disobedience is the transgression of the
[18:32] law
[18:33] and the law of God him being holy
[18:38] just
[18:39] unadulterated holy
[18:41] therefore no spot of unholiness can ever
[18:46] stand in his presence
[18:49] so if sin came in the world by
[18:52] transgression
[18:54] then sin must be dealt with
[18:58] before the sinner can ever stand in the
[19:02] presence of God
[19:05] now
[19:08] if there is no law then there is no
[19:12] justice
[19:14] but law require Justice requires a law
[19:21] and the law when it is
[19:24] it is uh recalled on
[19:27] IT projects Justice
[19:30] now by the law no flesh is saved
[19:34] now the law cannot save us
[19:38] the law was just the thing that put us
[19:41] in jail
[19:42] but it has no redeeming power
[19:46] the law only showed us that we were
[19:49] Sinners and condemned us
[19:52] that's what law is to do it's the brain
[19:56] condemnation
[19:59] or to show you where your mistake is
[20:03] so the law in itself could not save
[20:07] It could only prosecute
[20:11] and God being holy and just he had to
[20:16] have a prosecution
[20:19] he had to prosecute The Sinner
[20:22] because he had overstepped the bounties
[20:25] of Grace
[20:27] and had become a law breaking citizen
[20:33] then he must be dealt with
[20:37] and the every law has a penalty
[20:41] for
[20:43] the penalty of transgressing God's law
[20:47] is death
[20:50] and it had to project death to the human
[20:54] race
[20:56] and all of the human races under the
[21:00] penalty of this law
[21:05] now
[21:06] when Adam and Eve had sinned there was
[21:11] no way no other remedy
[21:15] that they could ever stand in the
[21:18] presence of God again except this sin be
[21:22] dealt with
[21:25] and no man can commit a sin
[21:29] of any type no matter how little or how
[21:33] big that individual sin has to be dealt
[21:38] with
[21:39] before the one who committed it can ever
[21:43] stand in the presence of the holy God
[21:48] so therefore when Adam and Eve had
[21:52] sinned and it transgressed the law they
[21:56] were subjects of death
[21:59] and the law had to be executed
[22:03] therefore it put all the human race
[22:06] under the penalty of death
[22:11] now if we can only settle down for a few
[22:15] moments now
[22:16] in our thinking
[22:19] and look at this great picture
[22:22] and remember that every person here is
[22:26] included in this
[22:29] every man and woman child is included in
[22:36] the penalty of death by the
[22:38] transgression of the head of the human
[22:40] race
[22:41] Adam
[22:43] by his transgression every one of us
[22:46] fell victim to sin
[22:49] and sin must be dealt with
[22:54] and so God in his great
[22:57] infancy and his great love
[23:02] the law was to
[23:04] separate The Sinner from his maker
[23:09] then he become annihilated
[23:12] I am totally annihilated
[23:15] there would be no way for him to ever
[23:19] come back unless that sin was dealt with
[23:26] and it would be very easy then
[23:29] to believe in a total annihilation of
[23:32] The Sinner at the end
[23:35] for he is completely forever
[23:38] separated from the presence of God
[23:43] now notice
[23:45] this sin
[23:48] and how God being just and he could do
[23:53] nothing else but be just
[23:55] for he is the resource of all Justice
[24:01] then there would be nothing else for him
[24:03] to do but to place the penalty for this
[24:07] transgression
[24:08] and the penalty was death for he said
[24:12] the day you eat thereof that day thou
[24:16] shall surely die
[24:20] now it's a dark picture we have here
[24:24] but then if we go back just a little
[24:27] further
[24:29] and find out the very attributes of God
[24:34] the Bible plainly tells us that God is
[24:38] love
[24:41] but yet being love he has to be just
[24:46] so love does not mean just the thing
[24:50] that can be petted and played with
[24:55] love
[24:57] is the justice of God
[25:02] now when God seen that his children have
[25:07] transgressed his law
[25:10] and that they must die the death
[25:13] then Sovereign Love stepped in to make a
[25:19] way
[25:21] for God seen that these children was to
[25:25] be absolutely totally annihilated from
[25:29] his presence
[25:31] there was nothing else to be done
[25:35] for their transgressed his law and the
[25:39] penalty of his law was death
[25:42] planet
[25:43] and then love of God went out for his
[25:48] subjects and when Divine love is
[25:52] projected
[25:53] Sovereign Grace produces the object of
[25:57] the love
[25:59] and God by foreknowledge
[26:03] when he loved his race so well yet with
[26:08] the penalty he caused the subductionary
[26:11] death to take place in the Garden of
[26:14] Eden
[26:15] that was he substituted an innocent
[26:19] creature a Little Lamb
[26:23] that no no sin
[26:26] and it went for a substitute
[26:30] to work
[26:32] and to die in the stead of the guilty
[26:36] sinner
[26:38] and it was a lamb slain to hold the life
[26:45] of his subjects
[26:49] all through the Old Testament they
[26:52] offered the blood of lambs and goats
[26:56] sheep bulls and Heifers
[27:00] a substitutionary death
[27:04] but all in the great economy of God
[27:07] there was back in his mind the real
[27:12] object coming which would be them were
[27:17] Shadows
[27:18] of the real object that was to come
[27:23] I am the real object was to come was his
[27:26] only begotten son
[27:30] all the Lambs that died was only a
[27:34] shadow
[27:36] and a shadow is only the negative side
[27:40] of an object
[27:42] and they only spoke of Calvary coming
[27:49] now for a picture of this let's turn in
[27:53] our Bibles
[27:54] through the book of Hebrews and pick up
[27:57] your what Paul
[27:59] the great Apostle speaking trying to
[28:03] separate these things for us
[28:06] in the 10th chapter of the book of
[28:10] Hebrews we read this and I just love the
[28:14] word amen the word is the truth amen and
[28:18] I like to read it before my congregation
[28:21] because I know that in the Judgment I'll
[28:25] stand with them
[28:27] now I've got to give an account
[28:30] so if I bring it from the word
[28:34] then I'll not be guilty because it's the
[28:38] word and God's responsible for his word
[28:44] we see so much today
[28:46] of evangelists and so forth filling up
[28:49] around personalities
[28:51] oh it's a disgraceful thing
[28:55] and we find out in going into churches
[28:58] we go into church and you find a certain
[29:02] Pastor he's got some little peculiar act
[29:06] about him
[29:07] some little emotion if you don't notice
[29:11] the entire congregation will take that
[29:14] spirit
[29:17] if he's just a little emotional or jerks
[29:20] his head or some little odd thing well
[29:23] the whole church will take on to that
[29:27] and we've got today in our modern church
[29:30] is the word it's Sensations and little
[29:33] things like that and it's got such a
[29:35] confusion
[29:37] but oh my beloved Brethren if there ever
[29:41] was a time
[29:43] that we ought to be on the word it's
[29:46] today
[29:48] [Applause]
[29:51] you see I would hate to stand at the
[29:54] judgment and know that I had some little
[29:57] ficklish something of a loose peculiar
[30:01] Revelation and misled people I don't
[30:05] want them to have him my spirit
[30:08] all my action but I want them to have
[30:11] God's spirit by God's word
[30:15] that produces truth
[30:19] so on this great occasion tonight I
[30:23] would like to read from God's Eternal
[30:26] Word
[30:28] now we realize
[30:30] that the law existed for many years but
[30:36] the law could never take away sin as I
[30:40] have said in the past it was just a
[30:44] jailhouse
[30:46] it was the great detective that told you
[30:51] what you had done but had no remedy to
[30:55] deliver you
[30:56] it puts you in the pawn shop
[30:59] but there was no Redeemer to take you
[31:03] out with it it only prisons you to let
[31:08] you know that you was a sinner
[31:11] but now notice in Hebrews the 10th
[31:14] chapter as we read
[31:16] for the law having a shadow of good
[31:21] things to come
[31:22] and not the very image remember it was a
[31:28] shadow
[31:30] of an image to come
[31:34] a shadow only introduces that there is a
[31:39] image making the shadow
[31:44] a shadow of the things to come and not
[31:49] the very image
[31:51] notice
[31:53] all the things
[31:56] the very image of the things can never
[31:59] with those sacrifices
[32:03] which were offered
[32:05] continually make the calmer unto perfect
[32:11] now God in the beginning required
[32:15] Perfection man
[32:19] Jesus when he come to Earth said be ye
[32:23] perfect
[32:25] like God in heaven is perfect
[32:29] and the law having a shadow of things to
[32:33] come could never make the worshiper
[32:36] perfect
[32:39] you got the picture
[32:42] now
[32:45] let's go it again so you'll be sure not
[32:48] to miss it
[32:50] God requires perfect holiness
[32:55] [Music]
[32:57] no one can stand in His image with one
[33:01] little speck of sand I am not
[33:06] Jesus witnessed the same and said be
[33:09] perfect just like God in heaven is
[33:12] perfect
[33:16] and the Bible said that the law could
[33:20] never with its sacrifices make the
[33:23] calmer perfect
[33:26] then the law could not perfect anything
[33:31] it was only a pointer
[33:37] these sacrifices made every year could
[33:41] never make the worshiper perfect so
[33:44] therefore no one under the law are
[33:46] keeping of laws are under the shadows
[33:49] could be perfect
[33:53] four second verse
[33:56] then would they not have ceased to been
[34:00] offered
[34:03] if there is anything that I can do
[34:08] to make myself perfect in the presence
[34:11] of God then Christ did not have to die
[34:15] for me
[34:17] yeah if there's one thing that you can
[34:21] do
[34:22] that would Merit anything in the
[34:24] presence of God
[34:26] then Christ died in vain
[34:31] no law keeping no legalistic ideas of
[34:36] yours none of your own holiness
[34:40] no things that you could quit doing quit
[34:43] lying quit stealing quit smoking tobacco
[34:47] quit going to the picture shows still
[34:51] you are lost
[34:55] nothing can do it joining churches
[34:59] rituals ceremonies baptisms orders of
[35:03] the church reading of Creeds saying of
[35:07] prayers all those things would count
[35:10] nothing
[35:14] you are lost
[35:16] not one thing can you do in yourself
[35:22] for you are a sinner
[35:26] under condemnation
[35:30] and there's not no way within yourself
[35:34] or any Creed
[35:37] or any pain that you could do or think
[35:42] of of yourself that could Merit one
[35:45] thing in the presence of God
[35:48] because you are a sinner to start with
[35:53] and the Bible declares that we were all
[35:57] born in sin
[36:01] shaped in iniquity
[36:03] come to the world speaking love
[36:09] and God could not take one man to die
[36:13] for the other
[36:14] because one is just as guilty as the
[36:19] other
[36:22] in the presence of God
[36:25] the Archbishop born in this world was as
[36:29] guilty as the lowest Barfly in the city
[36:33] amen
[36:35] 110 not atone for the other
[36:40] therefore he took an innocent life of an
[36:44] animal
[36:45] a Little Lamb
[36:48] and under the Old Testament the law was
[36:51] when a man sinned
[36:53] he brought the lamb to the altar
[36:57] say if he transgressed any of The
[37:01] Commandments
[37:02] he brought the lamb
[37:04] and he laid it on the altar
[37:07] he laid his hands upon the land
[37:11] and he confessed these sins that he was
[37:15] wrong
[37:17] and know that he was guilty
[37:20] of and was the law required death
[37:25] and he brought the lamb and instead
[37:28] and when he the throat of the little
[37:31] animal was cut
[37:33] and it's beginning to kick its little
[37:35] feet and blading if you've ever seen a
[37:40] lamb slaughtered
[37:42] what a pitiful cry
[37:45] the poor little fellow trying to blame
[37:48] and his little jumper veins cut
[37:52] and as he kicked and squivers and as he
[37:58] straightens out then Quivers again and
[38:01] breaks in the blood gushes
[38:04] it bases little wool and the worshiper's
[38:09] hands
[38:10] and as the worshiper realizing for
[38:14] committing adultery for lying stealing
[38:18] whatever is guilt laws
[38:22] or even evil thinking
[38:26] whatever it was in the least Shadow he
[38:30] was guilty
[38:33] because it was his nature
[38:37] he was a guilty person not maybe by the
[38:41] Czar but by Nature he was guilty
[38:47] and he had to recognize that this
[38:50] innocent little lamb died in his place
[38:54] and he felt sorry for the little thing
[38:58] but the man as soon as the lamb finally
[39:01] died
[39:02] with the blood of the Lamb upon his
[39:04] hands he walked from the building with
[39:08] the same desire in his heart that he had
[39:12] at the beginning
[39:14] wow
[39:16] because the light that was in the little
[39:19] lamb
[39:21] light lays in the blood
[39:24] your life is in your blood
[39:27] we know that
[39:28] and the life in the blood of the Lamb
[39:32] was animal life
[39:34] therefore when it's little car puzzles
[39:38] were broken and the life went out of the
[39:42] animal
[39:43] it could not come back to the worshiper
[39:46] because the worshiper was a human being
[39:53] the blood made a covering
[39:56] but it could not perfectly atone
[39:59] for the man left the building with the
[40:02] same desire to sin as he had in the
[40:06] first place
[40:08] but doing this
[40:10] he was looking forward to a time when
[40:15] there would be a perfect lamb comes
[40:22] and he did it on the burnt offering
[40:25] because it was the only way he knew
[40:28] about
[40:31] so you see when the blood was pouring
[40:34] and the life went from the animals it
[40:37] could not come back to the man for one
[40:40] was animal one was man an innocent
[40:44] animal to a guilty man
[40:47] but oh one day
[40:51] some 2 000 years ago
[40:55] the Lamb of God was born down in a
[40:58] little manger
[41:01] in Bethlehem and was led like a sheep to
[41:05] its Slaughter some 1900 years ago this
[41:10] afternoon at three o'clock
[41:12] he died this apocalypse blemish Lamb of
[41:16] God hung on calories Crossing died
[41:19] forever sinner amen
[41:22] now when the worshiper comes to this
[41:27] Lamb by faith
[41:30] and this is a different type of land
[41:34] amen it's not a lamb like the other
[41:37] no man can come to this lamb except God
[41:42] draws him first
[41:44] all right
[41:46] you seek God's sovereignty
[41:48] oh I hope this soaked way down deep down
[41:52] Emma look
[41:55] God knows he had sheep in this world
[41:59] he knowed he was going to have people to
[42:03] be saved
[42:04] and his love looked down and seen those
[42:07] who would be saved therefore by for
[42:12] knowledge he predestinated a church to
[42:15] meet him at her without spot or random
[42:18] [Applause]
[42:19] and if God required a church without
[42:23] spot or ankle he had to have something
[42:26] to make it that way he could not require
[42:30] it his Justice his judgments could not
[42:34] let him ask such a thing if there wasn't
[42:37] a way to make it forever and men cannot
[42:42] do it in himself
[42:45] he's a total failure God let him see
[42:49] that through the law to the judges and
[42:51] through all the Old Testament he sent
[42:54] the prophets he sent the righteous man
[42:56] and they found out that everyone failed
[43:01] amen so God by his Sovereign Grace
[43:07] sent from the portals of Glory his only
[43:11] begotten son I'm gonna take our place
[43:16] remember if he'd have said for the pope
[43:19] of Rome to take it he could not have
[43:22] done it
[43:23] amen if it has set for the Archbishop of
[43:27] Canterbury to do it he could not have
[43:30] done it
[43:31] amen if he would have called on the most
[43:35] holy Reverend father or Bishop of the
[43:39] world
[43:41] he could not have done it
[43:44] he had been just as far rejected as
[43:47] Judas is character
[43:49] amen
[43:51] he could not do it
[43:53] do it because he was born in sin shaped
[43:57] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[44:00] lies and needed atonement for himself
[44:03] amen
[44:05] Hallelujah
[44:06] [Music]
[44:08] but there came one from the portals of
[44:12] Glory
[44:13] yeah
[44:15] none other not a man
[44:18] not a good man
[44:21] neither a tune or a gentile
[44:24] he was nothing less than
[44:27] almighty God hidden human flesh
[44:33] he came himself to offer his own blood
[44:40] for it did not come to sex
[44:44] sex had nothing to do with it
[44:47] but he overshadowed a virgin and brought
[44:52] forth from a blood cell that he created
[44:55] himself
[44:56] [Applause]
[44:57] [Music]
[44:59] the innocent one then my salvation yours
[45:03] tonight does not hinge upon the merits
[45:06] of our own actions it ends up on the
[45:10] positive poverty Grace hello almighty
[45:14] God who has chosen
[45:16] [Music]
[45:19] certainly I could never be perfect nor
[45:22] you could never be perfect and we'd all
[45:25] claim to be perfect but we have this one
[45:29] consolation that our faith rests in a
[45:33] perfect sacrifice has already been
[45:36] received
[45:38] [Music]
[45:39] then how do we know that we get that
[45:43] when the worshiper puts his hands by
[45:46] faith upon the body of the Lord Jesus
[45:52] and feels the pair of sin
[45:56] and the mark of spit in his own face
[46:01] feels the groanings of Gethsemane the
[46:05] agonies of calorie and knows that he's
[46:08] guilty
[46:09] and confesses his sins correctly oh
[46:15] blessed Lord
[46:17] I am guilty
[46:20] and I have no other way but you to help
[46:24] me
[46:26] and by faith you're bidding the Holy
[46:30] Spirit has come
[46:32] and bits become and I'm now by faith
[46:36] except Jesus as my personal savior am I
[46:41] that life that come from him on Calvary
[46:44] called the Holy Ghost which was hid in
[46:48] the blood cell of the Lord Jesus returns
[46:51] to the worshiper and baptizes him with
[46:55] the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[46:57] amen and he's already judged
[47:01] amen you don't have to worry about
[47:03] judgment
[47:04] as I turn and look at that little
[47:06] crucifix
[47:08] I realize that that is represents his
[47:13] body
[47:14] and now that body has already been
[47:19] judged
[47:20] God take justly judge it again for it's
[47:24] already judged amen
[47:28] God's structured judgments of death upon
[47:31] that body
[47:34] and as long as I can find a way
[47:39] to get hit in that body
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:43] judgment was stuck for me and for you
[47:47] we are free Romans 8 1 said there is
[47:52] therefore now no condemnation that them
[47:56] that are in Christ Jesus that walk not
[48:00] into the flesh but
[48:03] there you are
[48:06] no condemnation
[48:09] I don't care what comes or what goes you
[48:13] are HID beneath the blood
[48:16] yeah again how do we get into that body
[48:20] First Corinthians 12 13.
[48:24] says that by one spirit
[48:28] how does the Spirit come through the
[48:31] sacrifice
[48:33] where did the spirit lay within the
[48:35] blood
[48:36] why couldn't the animal come back it was
[48:38] an animal
[48:40] the animal spirit could not come to the
[48:43] human spirit and do anything to it
[48:45] because the human Spirit was a higher
[48:48] line of life than the animal
[48:51] but no other man's Spirit could come
[48:55] back
[48:56] if you've got the spirit of some
[48:58] ancestor it's spiritualism
[49:01] but God himself came that his own Spirit
[49:06] which is the highest line of spirit
[49:09] there is can come back by the form of
[49:13] the baptism of the Holy Spirit to the
[49:16] worshiper to the blood of Christ and
[49:19] take him into the body ever be safe
[49:24] watch
[49:25] the blood of bulls and goats would not
[49:28] work
[49:29] see it was weak now let's start reading
[49:32] about the 12th verse
[49:36] all right
[49:37] the blood of bulls and goats cannot work
[49:40] neither could it atone watch but this
[49:44] man what man
[49:48] the bishop
[49:50] know the pope no
[49:53] but
[49:54] this man after he offered one sacrifice
[49:59] for sin forever
[50:03] sat down at the right hand of God Amen
[50:09] from his fourth expectant though his
[50:13] enemies be made his footstool are you
[50:16] ready
[50:18] are you ready for the word
[50:20] listen to this
[50:22] they don't want you to let it sink down
[50:26] listen closely
[50:28] far by one offering not year by year not
[50:34] Revival at your Revival
[50:36] not meeting after meeting not day after
[50:39] day
[50:40] but by one offering he has
[50:44] p-e-r-f-e-c-t-e-d
[50:48] ee they have he has
[50:50] by one offering he has perfected that's
[50:55] God's requirement forever then that are
[51:00] sanctified
[51:03] there you are that's the answer to the
[51:06] death of Christ
[51:07] that's the answer to Calvary he
[51:10] absolutely with his own blood purchased
[51:14] our sins and perfected forever his
[51:18] Believers
[51:19] therefore in Christ We Stand blameless
[51:24] thank you
[51:26] in the presence of God Almighty amen
[51:30] amen we are underprivileged people with
[51:33] our own doctrines
[51:35] we are being taught that we have to get
[51:37] up to a certain place we have to do a
[51:40] certain thing no my brother it's nothing
[51:44] you've done it's what God did for you
[51:47] we are now if we are justified by faith
[51:51] we are perfected forever in the presence
[51:55] of God
[51:57] then Jesus said be therefore perfect
[51:59] then it was perfected forever God do the
[52:03] death of Christ 1900 years ago today
[52:07] perfected the believer that he foresaw
[52:10] before the foundation world forever and
[52:13] those who he has called he has Justified
[52:17] those who he foreknew he has called
[52:20] those who he has called he has Justified
[52:23] those who he has Justified he hath
[52:27] already glorified
[52:29] he has perfected his Believers now watch
[52:34] this go back now to the first verse
[52:38] the law having a shed of good things to
[52:40] come
[52:42] and not the very image of those things
[52:46] can never with those
[52:48] sacrifices which were offered year by
[52:51] year continue make the calmer unto
[52:54] perfect what's Perfect's what we're
[52:56] talking about
[52:58] for then they should not have
[53:02] ceased to be offered
[53:05] because that the worshiper once purged
[53:10] would have no more conscience of sin
[53:14] what do you mean the word conscience
[53:17] there and right interpretation is desire
[53:20] and if a man comes to worship her
[53:23] correctly before Christ
[53:25] seeing his suffering and he offers
[53:27] himself to Christ
[53:29] and says oh Lord God there's nothing in
[53:31] me that can atone but I'm holy depending
[53:36] on you
[53:38] then that Holy Spirit comes into the
[53:43] human heart the very sin questions
[53:45] settle forever
[53:47] forever desire sin has been taken from
[53:51] you
[53:52] for if the law could have done that then
[53:55] sacrifices will not have deceased but
[53:58] being that it could not do it Christ had
[54:01] to die
[54:02] to make us perfect
[54:04] friends
[54:05] there is so many things that we could
[54:09] say tonight about the profession we are
[54:12] always trying to gouge the eyes out of
[54:14] somebody else to make ourselves just a
[54:16] little holier than they are they are
[54:18] but if we only looked at the picture
[54:20] it's only God's grace that we are what
[54:23] we are
[54:23] [Music]
[54:27] I learned a lesson a hard way
[54:31] I was having a meeting down in Ohio
[54:34] and I was staying out in the country
[54:36] because of the masses I cannot stay in
[54:39] the city
[54:40] we've been eating out a little dunkard
[54:43] restaurant and such lovely little
[54:45] waitresses and decently dressed and
[54:48] clean as they could be very ladylike
[54:50] waited on us it was a little spot of
[54:53] Heaven
[54:55] so eating such a place
[54:57] their kitchen was and span
[55:01] and on Sunday they closed up and they
[55:05] went to their Church
[55:07] I got a little hungry let's go to preach
[55:10] Sunday afternoon and I went over to an
[55:13] ordinary little
[55:15] just the common Little American
[55:17] restaurant
[55:19] to get something to eat and when I
[55:22] walked in the door what did I hear but a
[55:25] slot machine going
[55:28] and was standing there a man of my age
[55:30] which perhaps was a married man with his
[55:34] arm around a woman playing a slot
[55:37] machine
[55:38] are very low the protection of our
[55:43] righteousness of our Goods we're
[55:45] standing there violating a thing that he
[55:48] is supposed to be protected because it's
[55:50] illegal to gamble in Ohio
[55:53] playing a slot machine
[55:56] and I turned and looked towards the back
[55:58] of the building there was a bunch of
[56:01] teenage boys in an old rock and roll
[56:04] records on the machine plane
[56:07] a young lady of about 18 years old very
[56:11] neatly uh underneath as a woman
[56:15] but she was standing there with her
[56:17] dress hanging low in the front and one
[56:21] of those boys with his hands on the girl
[56:24] where they did not belong and they were
[56:27] smoking and drinking
[56:28] and I thought oh God how can you stand
[56:33] it
[56:34] and I looked over to my right when I
[56:37] heard someone make out a big groan and
[56:40] there said an age woman probably 60
[56:44] years or 70 years old
[56:46] she had on those little old vulgar
[56:49] clothes just about halfway upper limbs
[56:53] and her poor old wrinkled flesh was just
[56:56] as flabby as it could be
[56:59] and she had on this shirt lip makeup and
[57:03] a great big purple thing on the side of
[57:05] her face painted a little pair of shoes
[57:09] on sandals with purple toenails painted
[57:13] purple fingernails painted and her hair
[57:16] was cut real sharp and curled up and
[57:18] dyed blue
[57:20] and I looked at her and across the table
[57:23] set to man drunk one of them it was
[57:28] summertime with a big old army over coat
[57:31] on with a gray scarf wrapped around his
[57:33] neck and if whiskers all over his face
[57:37] up belching and going on
[57:40] and they excuse herself the man did from
[57:43] her and started walking out like this to
[57:46] the restroom
[57:49] I stood there and I said God why don't
[57:53] you destroy the whole thing why don't
[57:56] you just sink it beneath the Earth
[57:59] I said is my little Sarah and Rebecca
[58:03] going to have to grow up under such
[58:06] stuff is that
[58:07] I said how can you God in your great
[58:12] Holiness ever stand to look at such a
[58:15] thing like that and not send an
[58:17] earthquake and sink it
[58:19] as I was standing there condemning the
[58:22] woman as I was
[58:24] I stepped back behind the door I felt
[58:28] the spirit of God come to me
[58:31] and I stepped behind the door and I seen
[58:34] like something twirling and when it was
[58:37] in the vision it was a world turning
[58:40] around and around
[58:42] and as a notice around the world was a
[58:46] Scarlet Street
[58:47] around the world
[58:49] and as I got to the world I seen myself
[58:53] just a little boy doing things that I
[58:56] ought not to do maybe not like that but
[59:00] it was sin
[59:02] and every time I did anything I seen
[59:05] that great black shadow go towards
[59:08] heaven which God would have killed me at
[59:10] that minute
[59:11] there are seen standing between me and
[59:15] God stood that perfect sacrifice
[59:20] I see him standing there with the thorns
[59:23] on his head in the spit hanging on his
[59:26] face
[59:27] and every time my sins would start
[59:29] towards God he'd reach out and catch it
[59:33] like the bumper on the car he was
[59:36] protecting me from death
[59:38] and every time I'd do anything wrong God
[59:41] would have killed me certainly his
[59:42] Holiness requires it his law requires it
[59:46] and every time I'd do anything or you do
[59:49] anything the blood of Jesus Christ acts
[59:51] like a bumper
[59:53] and I've seen that Scarlet streak meant
[59:56] that then that the blood still holds the
[59:59] Earth
[1:00:01] and as I stood looking
[1:00:04] I got a little closer to him as I
[1:00:07] noticed him now I can hear him say
[1:00:09] father forgive him he doesn't know what
[1:00:13] he's doing
[1:00:15] and I looked down in their laid a book
[1:00:19] and there's a recording Angel there
[1:00:23] in standing by his side and every time I
[1:00:27] sinned it was put out on the book and my
[1:00:30] name was on it
[1:00:32] and I realized that someday uh that
[1:00:36] blood streak would be lifted and I'd
[1:00:38] have to stand in the presence of God
[1:00:40] with my sinful life
[1:00:43] blasting by his Mercy he was holding off
[1:00:47] my judgment
[1:00:48] I went to him humbly I know on my knees
[1:00:52] and I said oh Jesus thou Son of God I am
[1:00:58] unworthy to come in your presence but
[1:01:01] will you please forgive me for what I
[1:01:05] have done he touched his side with his
[1:01:08] hand took the old book and wrote pardon
[1:01:11] on it voted back behind him and my sins
[1:01:15] were gone
[1:01:18] then he looked and he Stern in the face
[1:01:20] he said now I have forgiven you but you
[1:01:24] want to condemn her
[1:01:27] then our sin wanted and meant it
[1:01:31] as I come out of the vision I walked
[1:01:33] over to her I said how do you do she was

[1:01:56] just a few minutes ago standing there
[1:01:59] behind that door
[1:02:02] I begin to tell her as I begin to look
[1:02:05] the tears begin to run down her cheeks
[1:02:09] and she told me I said lady you don't
[1:02:13] mean to do these things Jesus died in
[1:02:16] the judgments of God is held off by his
[1:02:18] blood

[1:02:29] home my husband and I were charter
[1:02:32] members and live the Christian Life she
[1:02:35] began to tell me after his death she had
[1:02:38] two young girls and she went straight
[1:02:41] and how the girls had left her and she
[1:02:44] had told her life away and she thought
[1:02:46] there was no more hope for her
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:51] no I said God be merciful those who he
[1:02:55] has four knew he has called
[1:02:58] amen she said are you Reverend Branham
[1:03:03] from Dad I said I am she said I'm
[1:03:05] ashamed of myself to be sitting here
[1:03:08] like this
[1:03:09] she said do you think there would be a
[1:03:12] chance for me
[1:03:14] I said Jesus has his arms stretched out
[1:03:19] waiting for you to come lady
[1:03:23] and the other people began to take up
[1:03:26] and I said would you walk out here in
[1:03:29] this floor with me she said I will sir I
[1:03:33] took her by the hand I said you're about
[1:03:35] the age of my mother would you kneel
[1:03:39] there with me the floor and there in the
[1:03:42] floor we broke up that place that
[1:03:44] afternoon to an Old-Fashioned meeting
[1:03:47] and God saved that woman by his grace am
[1:03:52] I she dressed herself and come to the
[1:03:55] meeting and as far as I know living a
[1:03:57] Christian Life tonight amen
[1:03:59] is it oh God
[1:04:03] breaks Perfection he requires your
[1:04:06] repentance he requires your loyalty to
[1:04:09] him but he's looking tonight no matter
[1:04:12] how much you sin how little or how much
[1:04:16] you are still a sinner and cannot get in
[1:04:19] no other way but by Jesus Christ God's
[1:04:22] all-sufficient sacrifice in any if you
[1:04:25] are perfected forever
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:29] think of it it's not nothing you do it's
[1:04:33] not new pages you turn it's not a new
[1:04:36] life you start it's a confession of your
[1:04:39] wrong and God's grace to you that brings
[1:04:43] you to Perfection then you are perfected
[1:04:47] in Jesus Christ I trust tonight friend
[1:04:52] of mine while we are here at this great
[1:04:54] crucial moment now when decisions must
[1:04:57] be made after hearing this story you
[1:05:00] might have never heard it before but you
[1:05:03] can't go out one of those doors the same
[1:05:05] person you come in
[1:05:07] you must go out better or worse and
[1:05:11] while we bow our heads just a moment I
[1:05:13] want you to think mightily about it
[1:05:16] what about your soul tonight
[1:05:20] Jesus Christ died for you you say
[1:05:22] brother Brandon when I can get quit
[1:05:24] smoking when I can quit drinking when I
[1:05:27] can straighten this thing up I'll do it
[1:05:29] oh it will never be done right
[1:05:33] you'll never be able to do it
[1:05:36] why don't you just come the way you are
[1:05:39] and by faith go to that stream thy
[1:05:44] flowing wound Supply
[1:05:46] then redeeming love to be your theme and
[1:05:50] shall be till you die
[1:05:54] why take a substitute why try to get in
[1:05:57] by your church why try to come in
[1:05:59] because you quit drinking or quit lying
[1:06:02] come by the way of perfection
[1:06:06] for about one sacrifice he has perfected
[1:06:11] forever those that are Sanctified how do
[1:06:15] I get Sanctified confess your sins in
[1:06:19] the presence of the blood of Jesus and
[1:06:22] the right that come from that blood
[1:06:24] comes back to the worshiper and
[1:06:26] sanctifies him from the desires of the
[1:06:28] things of the world
[1:06:30] for about that all-sufficient sacrifice
[1:06:34] he had
[1:06:35] Sanctified us one Spirit we are all
[1:06:39] baptized into one body now there's no
[1:06:43] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:06:45] Jesus
[1:06:46] to them that walk not after the flesh
[1:06:49] but the spirit
[1:06:51] if you're trying to walk by the spirit
[1:06:54] and still lusting for the flesh the
[1:06:57] sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently
[1:06:59] applied to you
[1:07:02] but the worshiper once purged has no
[1:07:07] more desire of sin that was Calvary it
[1:07:12] isn't a place to sell flowers or a
[1:07:15] little place to do this or that it was a
[1:07:18] place where God and man were reconciled
[1:07:21] it was a place where peace and perfect
[1:07:24] safety was brought to mankind
[1:07:27] can you go with me tonight my sinner
[1:07:30] friend to Calvary and by faith apply
[1:07:34] this Blood to your own soul and let the
[1:07:37] Holy Ghost come and sanctify You by his
[1:07:41] great sacrifice
[1:07:43] before we pray would you raise your hand
[1:07:45] to God and say be merciful me God I now
[1:07:48] confess all my sins upon this Good
[1:07:51] Friday night and I appreciate the great
[1:07:54] suffering that Christ did for me I'm now
[1:07:56] surrender my own will my own motives and
[1:07:59] everything to follow you from this day
[1:08:01] henceforth will you raise your hand say
[1:08:03] remember me brother Brandon prayer
[1:08:04] that's the decision in my heart
[1:08:09] is there any
[1:08:12] this great night
[1:08:14] while we wait just a moment
[1:08:17] over your own my right hand side
[1:08:20] surely there's one along There Are you
[1:08:23] ashamed of your sins
[1:08:28] Are you ashamed of what you've done
[1:08:30] the world tonight is looking for Heroes
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:35] and it has Heroes physically speaking
[1:08:39] one day honors Switzerland one Swiss
[1:08:42] Switzerland was at stake the little
[1:08:44] Swiss party had gathered out into the
[1:08:46] fields to defend defend their economy
[1:08:50] the great oncoming Army was too great
[1:08:53] for them they were all trained had big
[1:08:55] Spears as Shields
[1:08:57] the Swiss could do nothing but give up
[1:08:59] they were backed up against the mountain
[1:09:02] then there was a hero stepped out
[1:09:05] somebody had to die
[1:09:08] and if they lost the battle they had
[1:09:10] enough of those sickle blades and rocks
[1:09:13] sticks to fight with when the oncoming
[1:09:16] Army looked like a brick wall
[1:09:20] if they were taking their lovely little
[1:09:22] wives to be ravished their young girls
[1:09:24] would be ravished their babies would be
[1:09:27] killed their heads would be busted their
[1:09:30] homes would be gone everything would be
[1:09:32] lost
[1:09:33] then there was a man whose name is too
[1:09:36] quickly forgotten
[1:09:38] by the name of Arnold Von weeklord
[1:09:41] he stepped out and said man of
[1:09:43] Switzerland
[1:09:44] this day I give my life for Switzerland
[1:09:48] he said just over the mountain on earth
[1:09:50] is a little white home I've got a wife
[1:09:53] and three children waiting for me but
[1:09:56] they'll never see me again
[1:09:59] for this day I give my life for
[1:10:02] Switzerland
[1:10:05] they said what will you do Arnold Von
[1:10:08] weak Lord he said follow me and do the
[1:10:11] best you can with what you have to do
[1:10:13] with
[1:10:14] and he looked over the Army until he
[1:10:17] found the thickest of the spears then he
[1:10:21] stuck up his hands in the air he run
[1:10:23] towards that big brick wall of Spears
[1:10:26] and screaming Make Way for Liberty
[1:10:30] Make Way for our Liberty a hundred
[1:10:34] steers turned to catch his charge he
[1:10:36] threw his arms out and gripped them into
[1:10:38] his own bosom which pinned him down and
[1:10:41] he died on the end of those Spears
[1:10:44] those Swiss followed him with clubs and
[1:10:47] sticks that great display of heroism
[1:10:50] riding that Army to the Swiss beat him
[1:10:53] out of the land and they've never had a
[1:10:54] war from that day since
[1:10:57] stand up in Switzerland and name the
[1:10:59] name of Arnold Von wicklord
[1:11:01] you'll see tears running down their
[1:11:03] cheeks why he saved their land that was
[1:11:06] a great hero deed it's seldom compared
[1:11:10] with and never exceeded in this Earth
[1:11:13] but oh it was a little thing to what
[1:11:16] happened one day
[1:11:18] when Adam's race stood
[1:11:22] demons Marching In from every sign
[1:11:25] prophets had failed law had failed
[1:11:29] sacrifice of bulls and Lambs that failed
[1:11:32] man's nature had failed everything and
[1:11:36] Adam's little race stood defeated
[1:11:40] outnumbered by devils
[1:11:42] superstitions
[1:11:44] sickness diseases
[1:11:46] there was one step out in heaven and
[1:11:50] said this day I'll die for Adam's race
[1:11:54] he came to the Earth and was made flesh
[1:11:57] he looked like down where the midst of
[1:11:59] the spears was the darkest
[1:12:02] the very darkest of all man's dreads was
[1:12:06] death and he took death into his bosom
[1:12:10] and own Calvary
[1:12:12] he paid the sacrifice and screamed make
[1:12:16] a way for Liberty and he screams to his
[1:12:19] church take this which I have left you
[1:12:22] my blood and my spirit and fight
[1:12:25] whatever what you got
[1:12:27] we can conquer tonight to that friend

[1:14:30] way
[1:14:31] to the baptism of the Holy Spirit
