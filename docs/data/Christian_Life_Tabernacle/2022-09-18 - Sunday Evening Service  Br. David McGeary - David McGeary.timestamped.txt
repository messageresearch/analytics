[46:27] so far short
[46:29] [Music]
[46:30] but Lord when we see you we're gonna be
[46:33] breathtaken
[46:36] the fact that what we've longed for and
[46:38] hoped for is a reality is gonna be
[46:41] Beyond expression
[46:44] but Lord take our feeble
[46:47] words and as we sing this song our words
[46:52] can't express Lord but listen to our
[46:54] hearts
[46:55] we love you Lord we ask you to bless us
[46:59] this evening in Jesus name we pray amen
[47:04] amen isn't God good
[47:06] you know I love Sunday evening because
[47:09] uh you know
[47:11] when you come to church Sunday evening
[47:13] you're coming to church with those that
[47:15] are going in the rapture
[47:18] yep and so that's good we called out all
[47:21] the make-believers and all the
[47:22] unbelievers and and so we're just here
[47:25] now with the elect and so I just enjoy
[47:28] no I I don't mean that but uh uh I I
[47:33] just I like Sunday evenings I like the
[47:35] the Warmness of it
[47:38] um
[47:39] and the fact that you know you really
[47:42] can enjoy the word of God and and I
[47:45] enjoy the word of God don't you we're
[47:47] going to listen to a few moments of a
[47:49] message this evening uh but I didn't
[47:52] tell that let's open our Bibles to uh uh
[47:56] First Corinthians the fourth chapter and
[48:01] um
[48:03] and the first five verses that brother
[48:06] Branham refers to this scripture
[48:10] in a statement that he makes and I
[48:12] thought it was good
[48:16] and so it says in the fourth chapter of
[48:19] the first uh epistle to the Corinthians
[48:23] it says
[48:25] let a man sow account of us
[48:28] as of the Ministers of Christ
[48:31] and stewards of the mysteries of God
[48:36] that's how I account My Messenger
[48:39] for my age as a steward of the mysteries
[48:42] of God Amen
[48:44] moreover it is required in stewards that
[48:49] a man be found faithful
[48:51] but with me it is a very small thing
[48:54] that I should be judged of you or of
[48:58] man's judgment yea I judge not my own
[49:02] self
[49:03] for I know nothing by myself
[49:07] yet am I not
[49:10] hereby Justified
[49:13] but he that justify me is the Lord
[49:18] amen therefore judge nothing before its
[49:21] time
[49:22] until the Lord come
[49:24] who both will bring to light the hidden
[49:28] things of darkness and will make
[49:31] manifest the counsel of the hearts and
[49:35] them shall then shall every man have
[49:39] Praise of God Heavenly Father we ask you
[49:42] to bless your word and your precious
[49:44] name we pray amen God bless you that
[49:48] again
[49:50] this evening as we just speak on a few
[49:54] things and share a little bit before we
[49:58] listen to this wonderful portion of
[50:00] message I like to read a statement I
[50:03] wanted to read this this morning but he
[50:06] says here he says we find out
[50:09] in Revelations 3
[50:12] that at the lady of CIA age which we are
[50:16] now living in to my interpretation of
[50:21] the scriptures
[50:22] that when the message has come forth
[50:27] of the ladies age
[50:29] and as it did in each age
[50:33] and each age had a messenger
[50:36] that we come forth in this last day and
[50:41] find out that the church was very rich
[50:45] and they were so disagreeable with him
[50:49] they put him out of the church
[50:55] now that's got to be Pride to the max
[50:58] but he said do you ever wonder why they
[51:02] put him out of the church because they
[51:04] got so disagreeable with them they
[51:06] disagreed with what his dress standards
[51:09] was they disagreed with what his
[51:11] Holiness was they disagreed with what he
[51:14] thought was important and where their
[51:16] lives should be and how they should live
[51:19] and how they should worship and they
[51:21] just they got so they just disagreed
[51:23] with them so much
[51:25] that they they put him out of the church
[51:27] because it's the only church age that we
[51:31] find even through the Well we'd think of
[51:35] the Ephesian age and the Sardis and the
[51:39] church ages that they were and down
[51:42] through the Philadelphia and Wesley age
[51:44] and so forth even into all the ages he
[51:48] was not put out
[51:50] but in the lady of certain seeing Church
[51:53] age he was on the outside but was still
[51:57] knocking trying to get into his people
[52:02] and with this divine presence
[52:05] as it was when he was on Earth God was
[52:10] in one person
[52:12] now God is in his church his life
[52:16] divided among his people
[52:18] God living among them trying to unite
[52:23] them together in a mystical body of
[52:26] Christ which is called the bride
[52:30] and when he's trying to do that and he
[52:34] will do it
[52:36] for as the prophet said
[52:38] it coming forth his Forerunner of his
[52:42] first Advent said God is able of these
[52:45] stones to rise up children
[52:47] and today when the blessings fall upon
[52:51] the Pentecostals years ago
[52:53] and they separated themselves seemingly
[52:57] not having the faith God is able of
[53:00] methodists
[53:02] and Orthodox and so forth of these
[53:05] stones to raise up children unto Abraham
[53:08] amen so that's what he did he called us
[53:10] out of denominations raising up Stones
[53:14] children to Abraham and did you ever
[53:16] think my brethren did you ever come to
[53:19] you in the scriptures that that very day
[53:23] that the sleeping virgin come to buy oil
[53:27] that was the day when he come
[53:29] when you see Greek Orthodox
[53:32] episcopalians Methodist Baptists
[53:35] Presbyterians coming in hungering for
[53:38] this where can we get this oil remember
[53:42] it was the hour that the bridegroom came
[53:45] let us watch our investment where they
[53:49] pay off
[53:51] amen what great uh word advice and then
[53:55] this other statement here I I think is
[53:58] uh I like it very much
[54:03] and he speaks here and he says now
[54:06] notice the day of man
[54:09] if you want to put it down I was going
[54:12] to read it Corinthians 4 1 to 5
[54:15] apartment Corinthians 4 1-5 was Paul
[54:19] speaking of being judged by man in man's
[54:23] day the day why do you call it man's day
[54:28] for
[54:29] you would say it's the day that the
[54:32] works by the knowledge of man is
[54:36] glorified
[54:37] so that's why it's man's day because
[54:40] this is the day that the works of man's
[54:45] knowledge is being glorified right the
[54:48] great Technologies and and uh I was
[54:53] visiting this afternoon
[54:55] uh with uh my bookkeeper and and we were
[55:01] fellowshipping and I said you know it's
[55:03] always a bad time when you have lunch
[55:05] with your bookkeeper
[55:07] and she said well don't worry Brother
[55:09] David because he I says now with 187
[55:13] 000 new IRS agents I'm sure they're
[55:16] going to come after me she said no she
[55:19] said don't worry because nowadays
[55:21] everything's done electronically
[55:24] you send your electronic form and they
[55:27] electronically teach to you they they
[55:31] look electronically they go search all
[55:34] the data all your spending all the W-2
[55:38] forms everything anybody's reported of
[55:41] you and they've gathered any of that
[55:43] data and if there's one little bit of
[55:46] discrepancy the computer automatically
[55:49] shoots out a letter to you and nobody's
[55:52] even seen it or touched it yet
[55:56] and she was telling me she said that
[55:57] when you go for further education now
[56:00] they don't tell you talk to you about
[56:02] books
[56:04] and the numbers and tax things they just
[56:07] teach you how not to
[56:10] excite the computer
[56:16] now that's gloring
[56:19] in man's look at your cell phones look
[56:21] at the WhatsApp look at apps the app
[56:25] apps everywhere
[56:28] I asked somebody a question the other
[56:30] day and they grabbed their phone and
[56:33] they they moved and that was a page of
[56:35] apps and they moved another page of apps
[56:37] and another page app that I guarantee
[56:40] you they had 20 pages of apps how in the
[56:43] world do you use so many apps
[56:46] they got an app for everything I think
[56:49] the real word should be ape
[56:52] but they they've got it they've got it
[56:56] for for everything so why is this the
[57:00] day of man
[57:02] because it's the day that man's glory in
[57:06] his achievement all that he's
[57:09] accomplished in in all the great things
[57:12] that he's done and make glory in that
[57:15] and they glory in that and anything that
[57:19] relates to God is out of the picture
[57:23] because they're a carnal and God's
[57:26] spiritual
[57:27] he says he says why do you call it man's
[57:30] day
[57:31] for you would say it's the day that the
[57:35] works by knowledge of man is glorified
[57:38] what's all the bragging of the
[57:42] Communists
[57:43] and somebody trying to get somebody to
[57:46] the Moon God's trying to get somebody to
[57:49] heaven
[57:52] now here they are they're trying to get
[57:54] you to the Moon they're trying to get to
[57:56] Mars they want to live forever and hear
[57:59] eternal life is free
[58:02] see but look how they're spending
[58:06] millions and billions and trillions of
[58:09] dollars in a wasted effort when they get
[58:13] there they ain't gonna find nothing
[58:17] I mean that's that's such vanity
[58:21] right
[58:23] what's the matter with them I don't care
[58:26] about the moon
[58:27] I want to pass the moon so far I won't
[58:30] even see it just keep going higher I
[58:34] want to pass the Milky Way and go go on
[58:38] just keep going yes that's what we're
[58:41] about
[58:43] and if you are going to be about that in
[58:47] life you're certainly going to find out
[58:49] that uh
[58:51] that uh
[58:55] the things of God are foolishness to man
[58:59] I mean they're trying to get technology
[59:01] to go to Mars and you're sitting back
[59:03] waiting for a spirit to change you to
[59:05] take you to heaven
[59:08] you think that makes you look smart
[59:11] I think that makes you look like a
[59:12] genius
[59:14] myself
[59:16] because that's what's going to happen
[59:19] because God said so the same God that
[59:22] says Let There be lights the same God
[59:24] that's going to call for the rapture
[59:26] and all those whose names are written on
[59:29] the Lamb's Book of Life is going to be
[59:31] there
[59:31] now let's go in as we're talking about
[59:34] the Rapture being so
[59:36] uh important to us I think it's
[59:40] important that we understand what's
[59:42] going on out in our country and and
[59:47] because you know our country type types
[59:49] the move of civilization from east to
[59:53] west and we know spiritually the sun the
[59:57] sun moves for the east to west naturally
[59:59] we know that civilizations move from
[1:00:02] east to the West we know the gospel and
[1:00:05] moved from the East to the west and
[1:00:07] ended up on Sunset mountain with the
[1:00:10] mysteries of God for the age being
[1:00:12] related so we begin to understand the
[1:00:17] age that we're living in the little
[1:00:19] section that we're going to listen to is
[1:00:21] out of a continuation out of the message
[1:00:24] of the God of this evil age and
[1:00:29] and and we'll
[1:00:32] what this portion's talking about is how
[1:00:36] Satan has positioned himself in a place
[1:00:39] of worship by mankind and and how do
[1:00:43] they worship him they worship Him by
[1:00:45] accepting his knowledge
[1:00:48] and his thoughts
[1:00:52] and and so man's accepting their
[1:00:54] knowledge and look at what's happening
[1:00:56] into our schools whether we realize it
[1:00:59] or not Satan is being taught in our
[1:01:02] school
[1:01:03] they took prayer out they got all these
[1:01:06] kind of theories and they got all this
[1:01:08] kind of uh
[1:01:10] new morality teaching and everything and
[1:01:14] and most of the problem is is that those
[1:01:17] teachers have come out of liberal
[1:01:20] colleges they've been educated in the
[1:01:22] system and now they think it's real
[1:01:25] important that you teach your children
[1:01:28] uh how to accept uh except ungodliness
[1:01:35] in others they don't teach that God made
[1:01:37] them male and female
[1:01:39] nope that's out
[1:01:41] you you know if you want to keep your
[1:01:45] children safe from perversion teach them
[1:01:48] what perversion is
[1:01:52] you got to
[1:01:54] because you've got to remember he's out
[1:01:56] there trying to teach them something
[1:01:59] else
[1:02:00] I mean the books that they have now and
[1:02:04] the books that are on the shelves and
[1:02:07] and I've said this to you before because
[1:02:10] our children are back there uh in uh a
[1:02:14] Sunday school our best effort to try to
[1:02:17] let them know that there's another
[1:02:19] teaching that exists and it's the
[1:02:23] teaching of the word of God
[1:02:25] and the and the they they've gained such
[1:02:29] power that they don't even want to voice
[1:02:33] to rise up against it and speak against
[1:02:36] it make it a crime to preach the gospel
[1:02:42] but it's the truth anyway
[1:02:44] and the only thing that sets you through
[1:02:47] free is the truth and the only thing
[1:02:49] that's going to keep the delusion and
[1:02:52] the deception from overtaking is the
[1:02:56] true word of God
[1:02:58] and and the prophet of God will talk
[1:03:00] about this and I want to read this
[1:03:03] before we play it because uh maybe with
[1:03:06] me reading it and then you seeing it and
[1:03:10] then listening to it it'll kind of uh
[1:03:13] catch it in our heart that we recognize
[1:03:18] what
[1:03:20] is the atmosphere
[1:03:24] that we have to grow in and I'm not
[1:03:27] talking about the spiritual atmosphere
[1:03:30] we have to grow spiritually in a very
[1:03:33] desperate dry
[1:03:36] land
[1:03:38] and and it's going to take rain and
[1:03:42] Leadership from the Holy Spirit and
[1:03:45] God's grace and mercy to get us through
[1:03:48] this darkness and he gave us a guide
[1:03:51] through this Darkness he gave us a voice
[1:03:55] to lead us through this darkness in fact
[1:03:59] he predestinated and knew that we would
[1:04:02] be here
[1:04:03] and because he knew we were be here he
[1:04:07] made Provisions for us in order to not
[1:04:11] be deceived but I'd like to read just a
[1:04:16] couple statements and then we'll play
[1:04:18] it's about 15 minutes long but
[1:04:23] um he makes this little statement here
[1:04:26] and uh
[1:04:28] and I I thought it was uh uh pretty good
[1:04:32] now we know that anything that was
[1:04:35] planted any seed that's planted it
[1:04:39] always returns back or heads back up
[1:04:42] into the seed that went into the ground
[1:04:44] unless it's something that's hybrid
[1:04:48] and that means it's been taken out of
[1:04:51] God's natural process and man has
[1:04:54] injected His science and knowledge and
[1:04:58] then it can't reproduce which only shows
[1:05:01] that when man injects His science and
[1:05:03] knowledge into something it dies
[1:05:07] but God's seed is designed to live
[1:05:11] eternally
[1:05:12] and so we're in that age that
[1:05:14] everything's coming up and
[1:05:17] so and we know that Eve uh bet uh she's
[1:05:23] it it wasn't that she
[1:05:25] didn't believe God
[1:05:29] no but she but she what she did is she
[1:05:33] believed in air
[1:05:36] just a little twist or a
[1:05:38] misinterpretation of the word of God
[1:05:41] that's why we understand a way of a true
[1:05:44] Prophet is to stay with the word of God
[1:05:48] so you've got to be careful because
[1:05:51] we're living in a day of a lot of voices
[1:05:54] you've got to know and and there's no
[1:05:57] reason for us to take second-hand
[1:05:59] revelation
[1:06:01] we have full access to uh
[1:06:06] The Source itself
[1:06:08] but and so in the garden
[1:06:11] he says Satan never come out and said oh
[1:06:15] well that's not even the word of God he
[1:06:18] admitted it was the word of God but he
[1:06:21] put his own interpretation to it which
[1:06:24] God plainly told them not to do it
[1:06:29] so that that's the same age we're in now
[1:06:32] that man's putting his interpretation to
[1:06:35] the word of God you want to know how to
[1:06:38] know exactly what the true
[1:06:40] interpretation of the word of God is
[1:06:42] stay with the messenger because the
[1:06:45] prophet is a Divine interpreter of the
[1:06:48] word of God no matter how enticing that
[1:06:50] it sounds how blessed it sounds how
[1:06:54] beautiful the promises it it sounds No
[1:06:58] matter how it feels like the spirit's
[1:07:00] moving and and
[1:07:02] what signs and wonders are done we've
[1:07:06] been taught over and over and over and
[1:07:09] over again if it's not according to the
[1:07:12] word leave it alone
[1:07:15] Satan appears as an angel of Light
[1:07:18] and he's got a little spin in a little
[1:07:21] twist now remember when that bullet
[1:07:24] leaves that Barrel
[1:07:27] if it's not straight in line it's only
[1:07:30] this far away in the beginning but the
[1:07:33] farther down range it goes the farther
[1:07:36] away it hits and the farther if you
[1:07:39] don't if you don't examine
[1:07:42] everything that comes to you and put it
[1:07:45] through the filter of God's word if you
[1:07:48] Church chasing something that's not
[1:07:50] right it'll move you farther away and
[1:07:54] you'll be farther off the word of God
[1:07:56] now we always believe that God will
[1:07:59] correct you and bring it but it's a lot
[1:08:01] easier to take care of things right at
[1:08:03] the beginning than letting him grow into
[1:08:06] a seed form and then this little last
[1:08:09] statement I could read this also he says
[1:08:11] now he says
[1:08:15] he says now
[1:08:17] and as
[1:08:18] he quickened who were once he says and
[1:08:23] you has he quickened who were once dead
[1:08:27] in trespassing sin Quicken means to be
[1:08:30] what brought to life so he brought you
[1:08:33] to life when you were once dead
[1:08:36] and in in sin and trespasses
[1:08:40] wherein times past you walked according
[1:08:43] to the course of this world
[1:08:47] according to the prince
[1:08:50] of the power of the air
[1:08:54] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:08:57] children of Disobedience so you used to
[1:09:01] be walked in that spirit
[1:09:03] until
[1:09:05] he quickened you and made you alive from
[1:09:08] it
[1:09:09] and now he goes on and I thought this
[1:09:12] would think he says if the Antichrist
[1:09:14] begin there
[1:09:16] in the infancy of disobedience
[1:09:21] now look what he said here he said you
[1:09:24] know sometimes we don't think the uh how
[1:09:28] important it is to obey every word of
[1:09:31] God
[1:09:32] but the Antichrist Spirit began
[1:09:36] in its infancy in the spirit of
[1:09:40] disobedience
[1:09:42] so just those little foxes though that
[1:09:45] little bit of Disobedience that little
[1:09:48] bit of not being disagreeable with them
[1:09:52] and and and just not accepting first of
[1:09:55] all maybe it was water baptism maybe it
[1:09:58] was The Cutting of hair maybe it was the
[1:10:00] wearing of makeup maybe all these little
[1:10:02] seeds of Disobedience but that that was
[1:10:06] the Antichrist in its infancy was just a
[1:10:10] spirit of disobedience
[1:10:13] but now
[1:10:15] he says what
[1:10:17] will it be when it's headed up in the
[1:10:22] person of the Antichrist how deceptive
[1:10:26] it'll be
[1:10:31] so just that little bit of Disobedience
[1:10:34] that little bit of letting down the bars
[1:10:37] it conditions you
[1:10:40] for a greater deception
[1:10:43] so it's real important to learn to have
[1:10:46] principles that you stand by things that
[1:10:49] you don't say things you don't do places
[1:10:53] you don't go things you don't listen to
[1:10:56] well you know and and I know music is
[1:10:59] one of the tools that Satan uses and
[1:11:02] Something's Got a certain beat and it's
[1:11:04] got a certain thing and and the lyrics
[1:11:07] might be real good but you gotta just be
[1:11:10] able to sit there if something like that
[1:11:12] comes and let the spirit that's in you
[1:11:15] judge it
[1:11:17] some of that stuff just isn't edifying
[1:11:20] if you get caught up into the beat you
[1:11:23] can almost feel the spirit just kind of
[1:11:26] move away from you and the pleasure of
[1:11:29] the song move in
[1:11:32] don't be disobedient to that Holy
[1:11:34] unction
[1:11:35] because that's always Satan is infancy
[1:11:39] moving to something greater he says how
[1:11:42] much more powerful of deception could an
[1:11:46] adult give to the world than an infant
[1:11:51] child
[1:11:53] and it says the spirit of delusion now
[1:11:57] working in the children of disobedience
[1:12:02] to the word
[1:12:05] so we got that's one little point the
[1:12:07] prop you're going to hear the prophet
[1:12:09] make and I just I'd like that to set in
[1:12:12] because this take this is an age that it
[1:12:16] takes real discipline and we're what
[1:12:19] we're preaching what we're talking about
[1:12:21] is the discipline of the believer in
[1:12:25] order to make the rapture
[1:12:27] and then I'll just read this paragraph
[1:12:29] uh it's kind of beautiful you I don't
[1:12:34] you can put it up there if you'd like
[1:12:35] God of this evil age uh paragraph 65
[1:12:39] page 16.
[1:12:43] it says
[1:12:45] now in these messages
[1:12:49] I want to emphasize the things that I
[1:12:54] have told you in the message of this
[1:12:58] evening light
[1:12:59] that God would come that God said would
[1:13:04] come upon the Earth
[1:13:08] now notice man
[1:13:11] the Beast that was to come upon the
[1:13:15] Earth would deceive all whose names were
[1:13:21] not put in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:24] slaying before the foundation of the
[1:13:27] world
[1:13:29] you're living in a world that is going
[1:13:32] to be totally deceived
[1:13:36] the prophet of God said they would have
[1:13:38] no more common decency and no common
[1:13:42] sense whatsoever
[1:13:47] in God's Own thinking
[1:13:49] God the great spirit
[1:13:52] in the beginning
[1:13:54] before there was a beginning
[1:13:58] he was God
[1:14:00] and did you know you were in him then
[1:14:04] if you are a Christian now
[1:14:07] you was in him then
[1:14:11] and then if
[1:14:13] that be so
[1:14:17] the whole godhead bodily shaped up in
[1:14:21] the person of Jesus Christ
[1:14:39] and when Jesus died
[1:14:41] at the cross
[1:14:44] I died with him
[1:14:48] for I was in him then
[1:14:52] so if you were in God's thinking in the
[1:14:54] beginning right and and you were a part
[1:14:57] of him then and he summed all that up
[1:15:02] right and put all the word and
[1:15:05] everything into Jesus Christ then when
[1:15:08] he went to the Cross you went there with
[1:15:10] them you were in him then for he was the
[1:15:14] fullness of the word made manifested
[1:15:19] knowing that
[1:15:21] we would be manifested later
[1:15:27] Hallelujah
[1:15:29] amen he put us there took care of
[1:15:32] everything because he knew we'd be
[1:15:34] manifested later you're not a secret to
[1:15:37] God
[1:15:39] he's got something for us hallelujah
[1:15:43] he says and and we was at Calvary with
[1:15:48] him
[1:15:49] we went in the grave with him
[1:15:53] and we raised with him in his
[1:15:57] resurrection
[1:15:59] and now we've ascended by his Spirit to
[1:16:04] the throne of grace setting together in
[1:16:08] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus always
[1:16:13] for as The Germ of the Natural Life
[1:16:17] is brought down
[1:16:20] germanized from father to father to
[1:16:24] father to father
[1:16:26] so is the Life of Christ germatized
[1:16:30] that's the reason God used the spirit
[1:16:34] Elijah's Spirit five different times
[1:16:36] what is it it's the handing down
[1:16:40] just as your natural life
[1:16:43] and traits is handed down from the
[1:16:47] natural breeding of your father so is
[1:16:51] the spirit of God that was predestinated
[1:16:55] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:58] Hallelujah
[1:16:59] so that spirit's been handed down
[1:17:04] the traits you have is handed down
[1:17:08] you know now that that I'm pretending to
[1:17:11] meet people's grandchildren and people
[1:17:14] and my friends children I can look at
[1:17:17] them and say why you look just like you
[1:17:19] look just like your dad or you look just
[1:17:21] like your grandpa or or can you look you
[1:17:24] can actually see those traits passed
[1:17:26] down well they're spiritual traits of
[1:17:29] the father that are passed down so Keys
[1:17:33] past these spiritual traits down to you
[1:17:37] he can uh
[1:17:40] he says the predestined before the
[1:17:42] foundation wrote and when the entire
[1:17:46] word of God is complete complete and
[1:17:50] headed up in the human body called Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ in there God made me pay for my
[1:17:57] sins in him there
[1:18:02] well
[1:18:04] I never felt he made me pay for my sins
[1:18:08] but he he made me pay for him there in
[1:18:12] other words he because I was in him I
[1:18:16] get the benefits of it I like that don't
[1:18:19] you
[1:18:20] he said
[1:18:22] and uh
[1:18:26] for my sins in him there and he rose
[1:18:31] and he rose me
[1:18:33] raised me up with him in the
[1:18:36] resurrection
[1:18:37] and now we are seated with him with
[1:18:42] power and authority over the devil
[1:18:47] oh if you could only believe what God
[1:18:52] has given
[1:18:58] well if God can prophesy the condition
[1:19:02] of this world
[1:19:04] and we can see that wouldn't that allow
[1:19:07] us to come back and see that this is
[1:19:10] true also
[1:19:14] but if you're not seated there
[1:19:17] you don't have it
[1:19:19] and if you're seated there and don't
[1:19:22] believe and you're afraid to move
[1:19:26] you'll never use it
[1:19:31] that's what we want to overcome
[1:19:35] we want to come overcome the fear
[1:19:39] in this evil world
[1:19:42] of using the grace and the knowledge and
[1:19:46] the revelation of God's word to live our
[1:19:49] lives
[1:19:50] you'll never use it but if you are
[1:19:53] seated there and you will use it
[1:19:56] for your ordained to do what you do amen
[1:20:02] so the Lord bless you I you're going to
[1:20:04] hear this over again it has the
[1:20:07] messenger but uh mother Branham says so
[1:20:10] many things in such a small amount of
[1:20:13] time that we're only going to listen to
[1:20:15] 15 minutes and it's worthy of three
[1:20:18] hours of discussion
[1:20:20] but okay just let let the food of God's
[1:20:23] word uh bless you for a few moments
[1:20:26] tonight and
[1:20:28] again tonight we're we're kind of
[1:20:31] experimenting with our Sunday school so
[1:20:34] if you have any feedback uh please uh
[1:20:37] let us know we'd be so happy to hear
[1:20:40] from you God bless you as we listen to
[1:20:42] our messenger we're starting on
[1:20:44] paragraph uh I believe it's uh let me
[1:20:49] tell you the paragraph number I I guess
[1:20:51] you can look it up on your phones or
[1:20:53] your tablets if you wish but we're
[1:20:55] starting at paragraph 57 of cloud of
[1:20:59] this evil age and we're going through to
[1:21:02] the end of paragraph uh
[1:21:06] of
[1:21:07] paragraph 76. So I I just think it's
[1:21:11] real uh wonderful as brother Branham
[1:21:15] shows us how that Satan climbed the
[1:21:20] throne to become the god of this evil
[1:21:24] age thank you God bless you
[1:21:58] that down he purchased
[1:22:02] now back to there you block other ages
[1:22:04] you belong to the nominations you belong
[1:22:06] to this that or the other what happened
[1:22:07] to the denominational stalk it dries up
[1:22:10] the spirit keeps leaving it going on and
[1:22:12] it heads up in a seed
[1:22:15] you see and the temptation of both heads
[1:22:18] back the same way it was at the
[1:22:19] beginning
[1:22:21] notice don't don't know don't forget it
[1:22:23] now
[1:22:24] uh John first John four five six if you
[1:22:28] want to put that down he putseth the
[1:22:30] spirit of error
[1:22:33] Eve never just simply walked out
[1:22:36] willfully say I don't believe in God no
[1:22:38] he was the error she believed Satan
[1:22:41] never come out and said oh well that's
[1:22:43] not even the word of God he admitted it
[1:22:45] was the word of God
[1:22:48] but he put his own interpretation to it
[1:22:51] which God plainly told him not to do it
[1:22:55] what does this do it makes a strong
[1:22:58] delusion
[1:22:59] for the people to believe a lie and be
[1:23:02] damned divine
[1:23:04] now if you want to read that second
[1:23:06] Thessalonians
[1:23:08] 2 11. as I have about quite a few
[1:23:12] scriptures here we won't be able to read
[1:23:14] them all one now and then I'll give them
[1:23:16] to you as it seems strange that you're
[1:23:19] questioned or something and we might put
[1:23:22] it down and read for your uh you're good
[1:23:25] making a strong delusion as the Bible
[1:23:29] said it would
[1:23:30] second Thessalonians
[1:23:32] this man of sin would come into
[1:23:34] existence and set in the temple of God
[1:23:36] showing himself he was God
[1:23:38] and cause the people to go into strong
[1:23:41] delusions
[1:23:43] to believe a lie believe it would be
[1:23:46] damned by
[1:23:48] that's the same thing he did to Eve
[1:23:51] Giver never never told her the word
[1:23:54] wasn't right but give her a strong
[1:23:57] delusion
[1:23:59] that she believed a lie
[1:24:02] the spirit of delusion is of the devil
[1:24:07] Devil's now working in the children of
[1:24:10] Disobedience Disobedience to love
[1:24:14] what's the children of this day
[1:24:15] disobedient to like Eve was at the
[1:24:18] beginning the true word of God
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:23] now if you were going to get that let's
[1:24:25] turn to it Ephesians 2 just to make it
[1:24:27] close it seems good that we uh stop this
[1:24:30] if you're in no big hurry and read some
[1:24:31] of this
[1:24:32] Ephesians 2 1-2 and you has he quickened
[1:24:36] who were once dead in trespasses in sin
[1:24:38] worry at times past you walked according
[1:24:41] to the course of this world according to
[1:24:43] the prince
[1:24:45] of the power of the air the spirit that
[1:24:48] now
[1:24:49] worketh in the children of disobedience
[1:24:55] children of disobedience
[1:24:59] and if the Antichrist beginning there in
[1:25:02] the infancy
[1:25:04] of disobedience
[1:25:06] what will it be when it heads up in the
[1:25:09] person of the Antichrist
[1:25:11] how deceptive it'll be how much more
[1:25:15] powerful of deception
[1:25:19] Coulda and adopt
[1:25:22] yield to the world than an infant child
[1:25:27] and he said the spirit of of delusion
[1:25:31] now working in the children of
[1:25:36] Disobedience disobedient to the word
[1:25:41] notice
[1:25:43] now I want to dwell on this just a
[1:25:46] minute
[1:25:47] the children
[1:25:49] of disobedience a child
[1:25:53] did you know
[1:25:54] you your beginning I can prove by God's
[1:25:58] word that you any person in your was a
[1:26:03] lie
[1:26:04] in your great grandfather
[1:26:08] and your great grandfather you were
[1:26:11] produced down to your grandfather
[1:26:13] then to your father and then to you
[1:26:16] you know that
[1:26:17] the Bible said I believe it's Hebrews 7
[1:26:21] that male Cassidy
[1:26:24] when Abraham returned from the slaughter
[1:26:26] of the Kings
[1:26:28] Abraham paid Melchizedek hiding
[1:26:32] of all the spoils and here's Paul saying
[1:26:37] now that Levi who received tithes was
[1:26:42] yet he paid times
[1:26:44] for he was yet in the loins of Abraham
[1:26:48] when he met Melchizedek
[1:26:50] so whatever that
[1:26:53] Abraham did
[1:26:56] then we find that Levi was then in
[1:27:00] Abraham which was his great grandfather
[1:27:02] Abraham begot Isaac Isaac we got Jacob
[1:27:05] Jacob begot the Patriarchs
[1:27:08] Leva
[1:27:10] now
[1:27:12] then you see here comes into perfect
[1:27:16] view
[1:27:18] predestination
[1:27:21] uh in these messages I want to
[1:27:24] set
[1:27:26] and to emphasize
[1:27:28] the things that I have told you in the
[1:27:31] message of this evening life
[1:27:35] that God said would come upon the Earth
[1:27:38] and notice
[1:27:40] man
[1:27:41] the Beast that was to come up on the
[1:27:43] Earth would deceive all
[1:27:46] whose names were not put in the Lamb's
[1:27:49] Book of life's land before the
[1:27:51] foundation of the world
[1:27:53] in God's Own thinking God the great
[1:27:56] spirit
[1:27:58] in the beginning before that was the
[1:28:00] beginning he was God and did you know
[1:28:04] you were in him then
[1:28:08] if you are a Christian now you was in
[1:28:12] him then
[1:28:15] if that be sold the whole godhead bodily
[1:28:19] shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ
[1:28:24] and then when Jesus died at the cross I
[1:28:28] died with him
[1:28:29] for I was in him then
[1:28:32] for he was the fullness of the word
[1:28:35] manifested knowing that we would be
[1:28:37] manifested later and we was at Calvary
[1:28:40] with him
[1:28:41] we went in the grave with him and we
[1:28:44] raised with him and his resurrection and
[1:28:47] now we've ascended by his Spirit to the
[1:28:50] throne of grace
[1:28:52] sitting together in Heavenly places in
[1:28:54] Christ Jesus
[1:28:56] always
[1:28:57] for as The Germ of natural life is
[1:29:00] brought down germanized from father to
[1:29:03] father to father to father
[1:29:06] so is the Life of Christ
[1:29:10] germatized that's the reason God uses
[1:29:13] Elijah's Spirit five different times
[1:29:16] what is it it's a handing down
[1:29:22] just as your natural life and traces
[1:29:25] handed down from the natural breeding of
[1:29:28] your father
[1:29:30] so is the spirit of God that was
[1:29:32] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:29:35] the world and when the entire word of
[1:29:38] God incomplete was headed up in a human
[1:29:41] body called Jesus Christ
[1:29:42] in there God made me pay for my sins in
[1:29:46] him there
[1:29:48] then he rose the raised me up with him
[1:29:51] in the resurrection
[1:29:53] and now we are seated with him
[1:29:57] with power and authority over every
[1:30:01] devil
[1:30:04] oh if you could only believe what God
[1:30:08] has given
[1:30:10] but if you're not seated there you don't
[1:30:11] have it and if you're seated there and
[1:30:14] don't bleed and afraid to move you'll
[1:30:15] never use it
[1:30:17] but if you are seated there
[1:30:20] you will use it for your ordained to do
[1:30:23] what you do
[1:30:25] payroll on the other side was raised up
[1:30:28] for this purpose the Bible said to be
[1:30:30] Pharaoh Judas iscaris was raised up to
[1:30:33] be the son of perdition
[1:30:36] now notice these great truths that we
[1:30:39] are approaching
[1:30:41] now we see that the church
[1:30:45] refuse to accept God's word to rule over
[1:30:49] them and accepted Barabbas instead
[1:30:52] now if you want the scripture on that's
[1:30:54] Matthew 27 15 to 23. what did this do
[1:31:00] what position did this do now think of
[1:31:04] it
[1:31:05] when the church World in its organized
[1:31:09] line of righteous holy man as they
[1:31:12] thought they were and were in the eyes
[1:31:14] of the people
[1:31:17] they crucified Jesus and said we'll not
[1:31:22] have this man rule over us
[1:31:25] and Jesus was the fullness of the word
[1:31:29] of God
[1:31:31] first John
[1:31:33] 1
[1:31:35] expresses it
[1:31:37] and they said will not have this word of
[1:31:40] God to rule over yet he was
[1:31:43] the word
[1:31:46] but their eyes were blind into what he
[1:31:50] was
[1:31:51] for he was the direct answer to every
[1:31:55] prophecy that
[1:31:58] was to come to pass any now we all
[1:32:01] believe that because we're looking back
[1:32:03] to see it happen
[1:32:05] but if the world
[1:32:07] will it is now this present evil age
[1:32:11] that would have been back there at that
[1:32:14] time they'd do the same thing they're
[1:32:16] doing today because it's still the same
[1:32:19] word for this age being manifested
[1:32:24] did you do it
[1:32:26] they can't do nothing else
[1:32:29] they are children of disobedience
[1:32:34] given a strong delusion
[1:32:37] to believe a lie and be damned by
[1:32:40] notice
[1:32:42] when the church world
[1:32:45] would not accept Jesus the word
[1:32:47] manifested of that day because why they
[1:32:51] hadn't interpreted another way
[1:32:53] but they ought to have known that he was
[1:32:56] that word because everything that God
[1:32:59] said he would do he did it
[1:33:01] and he said to him search the scriptures
[1:33:04] for this hour
[1:33:06] and if I do not meet the qualification
[1:33:10] that was spoke for me to do
[1:33:12] then don't believe me
[1:33:15] they said we believe Moses he said if
[1:33:17] you were to believe Moses you would have
[1:33:19] believed me for Moses spoke of me
[1:33:23] and still they didn't see it the very
[1:33:26] God Of Heaven dying on the cross was
[1:33:28] saying the same words the prophet said
[1:33:30] he would say and still they didn't see
[1:33:33] it okay
[1:33:35] they were not of his kind they was not
[1:33:38] the word
[1:33:39] not the word and they yet they were very
[1:33:42] religious
[1:33:43] but they was not the word or it would
[1:33:46] recognize his place
[1:33:48] for that hour
[1:33:50] notice how beautiful
[1:33:53] the scriptures tie themselves together
[1:33:55] in every age notice now
[1:33:58] and when the church world
[1:34:00] would not have the word of God to rule
[1:34:03] over them they accepted a murderer
[1:34:07] Barabbas
[1:34:09] what did this do it exalted Satan the
[1:34:13] God of this evil age
[1:34:17] to a place that he's always wanted
[1:34:20] now listen for Satan is not spoke of as
[1:34:24] a god of any other age but this age
[1:34:29] he once spoke of the god of the age of
[1:34:31] Noah
[1:34:32] you once spoke of of the god of the age
[1:34:35] of Moses the god of the age of Elijah
[1:34:38] but this evil age
[1:34:42] he is the oh don't miss it
[1:34:46] he is the god
[1:34:50] of this evil age
[1:34:52] worshiped
[1:34:54] by
[1:34:55] millions and billions of people
[1:34:58] and they don't know it
[1:35:00] but let's let the scripture uncovering
[1:35:02] this morning
[1:35:04] and let's see then you'll know
[1:35:06] let the scripture as in the meetings of
[1:35:09] discernment
[1:35:11] when the Holy Spirit gets among his word
[1:35:14] and he calls out this man and says you
[1:35:16] have no business living with this other
[1:35:18] woman
[1:35:20] what did you do that for 10 years ago
[1:35:22] when you run off of that man's wife
[1:35:25] what's he doing uncovered him
[1:35:28] exposing Satan that's got the man bound
[1:35:31] or the woman living with some other uh
[1:35:34] woman's husband are the sins that
[1:35:37] they've done the things that they have
[1:35:39] done
[1:35:40] what does it do exposing the doctors
[1:35:44] take instruments and try to find what's
[1:35:45] wrong they can't do it we can't tell but
[1:35:48] then the Holy Spirit comes out and
[1:35:50] reveals what he is
[1:35:52] and exposes him see that's what the word
[1:35:56] of God is
[1:35:58] it is a light that shines in darkness
[1:36:01] and when you take a noise in the room it
[1:36:04] sounds mysterious
[1:36:06] a bunch of something working
[1:36:09] and you don't know what it is turn on
[1:36:11] the light
[1:36:12] quickly crickets roaches they're they
[1:36:17] are children of the darkness
[1:36:19] and when the light flashes they scatter
[1:36:21] away
[1:36:22] they went out from us because it wasn't
[1:36:25] of us the Bible said
[1:36:27] they cannot live in the light of the
[1:36:30] world for the god of Heaven is sent his
[1:36:32] light in this last days and he might
[1:36:34] lightened
[1:36:36] the path or his children as they might
[1:36:38] not walk in darkness and stumble but
[1:36:40] they might walk in the light of The
[1:36:42] Shining of Jesus Christ the same
[1:36:44] yesterday today and forever
[1:36:46] amen
[1:36:49] isn't that wonderful
[1:36:51] I mean isn't it wonderful that this is
[1:36:54] the kind of voice and knowledge and
[1:36:57] Revelation that is available to us
[1:37:02] don't we see what's going on don't we
[1:37:04] you say how could things get so bad
[1:37:08] it's because it's being passed down it's
[1:37:12] being passed down that's what it was
[1:37:14] from the beginning
[1:37:17] they were disbelievers from the
[1:37:19] beginning
[1:37:20] because that's what he he said that's
[1:37:23] what he told them he said you are of
[1:37:25] your fathers the devil that's why you
[1:37:27] don't hear me
[1:37:28] that's why you don't listen to my word
[1:37:30] that's why you don't recognize who I am
[1:37:33] and so the spirit's just been passed
[1:37:36] down it's been passed down
[1:37:38] and then you notice what he said just
[1:37:40] that little time of that Disobedience
[1:37:43] how it's it's set in position
[1:37:47] when they rejected
[1:37:51] the word Jesus Christ
[1:37:53] and they crucified him and said give us
[1:37:57] Barabbas
[1:37:58] right then they exalted Satan
[1:38:04] to a place where he was worshiped
[1:38:08] think of it
[1:38:11] and they put the seed into the ground
[1:38:15] that's what they did they rejected it
[1:38:18] the Catholic Church came on the scene
[1:38:20] because it is slaughtered millions of
[1:38:24] believers
[1:38:27] brought the church into total darkness
[1:38:30] where it went into the ground and and it
[1:38:34] was all lost in Catholicism no true
[1:38:37] understanding they had a pope as a Vicar
[1:38:40] of Christ they had people going into
[1:38:42] boxes uh confessing their sins to
[1:38:45] priests lighting candles all this was
[1:38:48] done in the name of the Lord and it's
[1:38:49] not one thing to do with the
[1:38:50] predestinated seed of God
[1:38:53] but it came up
[1:38:56] because God promised he said it had to
[1:38:59] go into the ground and it's coming up
[1:39:02] and what's that Spirit been it was
[1:39:05] passed on from justification the
[1:39:07] sanctification it was passed on from
[1:39:10] sanctification
[1:39:13] to the restoration of gifts now to the
[1:39:17] true word of God and the opening of the
[1:39:20] Mysteries the same Spirits been passed
[1:39:22] down so he said just he said in the
[1:39:25] temptation of the two heads coming
[1:39:28] together so you understand it right now
[1:39:33] he's he's manifesting himself and he's
[1:39:37] bringing all his children into strong
[1:39:39] delusion and God's manifesting himself
[1:39:44] bringing all the predestinated in the
[1:39:47] left
[1:39:49] and this is where we are
[1:39:52] that's why you sit back and you you just
[1:39:56] can't imagine
[1:39:59] them teaching the things they teach and
[1:40:02] saying the things they say
[1:40:04] you can't imagine
[1:40:08] them letting criminals out of jail
[1:40:14] you can't imagine it
[1:40:16] no fine no crime no them they release
[1:40:19] them release them you know why
[1:40:22] because they released Barabbas
[1:40:30] and here comes the Same Spirit
[1:40:33] in our day
[1:40:35] you read it on the news all the time
[1:40:37] this man killed somebody he was just in
[1:40:40] jail for six months and they let him
[1:40:42] loose they let him loose they let him
[1:40:44] loose so where did that come from
[1:40:46] where does man get to the place he does
[1:40:48] it because they don't realize it but
[1:40:50] that Spirit was passed down on them
[1:40:54] that's why they're there
[1:40:57] that's why then they've done all these
[1:40:59] things before
[1:41:02] and they've been taught
[1:41:04] they've been taught and they've been
[1:41:07] taught to think that way taught to do
[1:41:09] that way you know the Bible says that
[1:41:12] that to agree with them
[1:41:14] swiftly and then he says that those that
[1:41:17] are in Authority are the Angels of God
[1:41:20] carrying out the wrath of God and the
[1:41:22] will of God
[1:41:24] and they've got no respect for him
[1:41:27] they just they just it's total delusion
[1:41:30] look you've got to understand this is
[1:41:33] happening why is it happening because
[1:41:36] it's been passed down
[1:41:39] Through the Ages
[1:41:41] so I don't know what time it is but now
[1:41:43] I know exactly how much of those
[1:41:45] children the Sunday School teachers can
[1:41:48] stand if at any one time
[1:41:51] so they've all come back and enjoying
[1:41:54] this but so don't if
[1:41:57] if I can say this if
[1:42:00] if we see what's been passed down
[1:42:05] if we can see that they're doing the
[1:42:07] same thing they did when they let Luca
[1:42:11] Barabbas we can see the same thing that
[1:42:14] that's going on because that spirit's
[1:42:17] been handed down handed down we can see
[1:42:20] the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:42:24] right because that Spirit was what
[1:42:26] handed down and here we are now in the
[1:42:29] days of Sodom and Gomorrah we're here we
[1:42:32] are in the days of Noah marriage giving
[1:42:34] and where did that come from because
[1:42:36] they've been handed down it's been to us
[1:42:39] they could never accept the truth
[1:42:41] because it wasn't in them they're the
[1:42:44] children of Disobedience you understand
[1:42:47] they're going to disobey the word of God
[1:42:50] they can't help it
[1:42:54] they can't even follow the law their own
[1:42:57] laws
[1:43:00] wouldn't it be terrible to have a spirit
[1:43:02] of disobedience
[1:43:07] how many people don't have communion
[1:43:11] how many churches don't have communion
[1:43:13] and foot washing I don't care how great
[1:43:16] they preach
[1:43:19] it's disobedience
[1:43:22] plain disobedient
[1:43:28] it's just what it is
[1:43:30] I can't help it
[1:43:34] you say well how do you know at least I
[1:43:36] had an example
[1:43:37] that I can look to
[1:43:40] and and and and I have a scripture
[1:43:43] the Paul said be followers of man
[1:43:46] of myself also be followers of me as I'm
[1:43:50] a follower of Christ well then I can
[1:43:52] look and see I have the same messenger
[1:43:54] that preached the same thing he did and
[1:43:57] I can look to him again he's my example
[1:44:01] because he's a prophet in a way of a
[1:44:03] true Prophet to stay with the word of
[1:44:05] God and leave the examples to the word
[1:44:07] of God
[1:44:09] he's my guide he's my voice
[1:44:14] how can people believe that that's the
[1:44:17] voice of God the voice of the Divine
[1:44:20] interpreter go back and read through
[1:44:23] this message how many times the prophet
[1:44:25] of God said God will perform this
[1:44:28] through Malachi 4. God will perform it
[1:44:31] through Malachi 4. God will perform it
[1:44:33] through Malachi 4. it takes Malachi 4.
[1:44:37] it takes a fulfillment of Malachi 4. it
[1:44:40] takes Elijah the prophet it takes how
[1:44:42] many times does he say it
[1:44:47] and people just
[1:44:52] why in this age is The Voice
[1:44:55] of the messenger
[1:44:58] outside of the church
[1:45:02] because they put it out
[1:45:06] they put it out
[1:45:08] and it's not alarming to everybody
[1:45:13] it ought to be alarming
[1:45:16] honestly it ought to be alarming
[1:45:20] the condition
[1:45:25] but we sit back and we understand and
[1:45:29] are further coming to the revelation
[1:45:34] that it takes revelation
[1:45:37] takes predestination
[1:45:39] something had to be passed down to you
[1:45:43] from the spirit of God that makes you
[1:45:46] hunger and thirst after the true
[1:45:50] word of God
[1:45:52] and
[1:45:54] to me this is part of
[1:45:58] rapturing condition you say brother
[1:46:00] McGarry you're just on a you're just on
[1:46:02] a hobby horse yeah
[1:46:07] yeah
[1:46:09] I want to be on the hobby horse of God's
[1:46:11] word
[1:46:13] I don't want to be on one of those four
[1:46:15] horses
[1:46:17] I want to be on the one that came back
[1:46:20] that said had on its side the word of
[1:46:22] God that's the horse we want to ride
[1:46:25] it's the word of God God has provided us
[1:46:30] and now he strictly shows us that that
[1:46:35] Disobedience to the word position Satan
[1:46:39] to be worshiped by millions and billions
[1:46:43] and they don't even know it
[1:46:47] and we wouldn't have known it
[1:46:50] right because we were once in darkness
[1:46:54] living under the spirit that now lives
[1:46:58] in the children of Disobedience but the
[1:47:02] voice of God cut you free
[1:47:05] from that spirit and now set you free to
[1:47:09] live in the glory
[1:47:11] and the knowledge and the revelation
[1:47:15] of his word so I I I I'm just so
[1:47:19] thankful
[1:47:22] that the path to the rapture
[1:47:25] has been revealed to us
[1:47:29] it was hidden simplicity
[1:47:32] veiled in the ministry
[1:47:36] of a church age messenger
[1:47:39] but yet there was the secret
[1:47:42] and the path
[1:47:44] and the key
[1:47:46] to the way out of here
[1:47:49] let's hold to it

[1:47:54] you raptured
