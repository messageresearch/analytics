and everything and just focus on him this morning and have his word come and speak to our hearts amen that we may receive life and life abundantly amen God bless you [Music] Lord Jesus once again we're just grateful to be in this place this morning Lord that you raised us up in health strength this morning lord gave us the strength to come Lord you gave us a desire to be here Lord that we heard your voice and that something drew us to this place a desire a longing that we might be in your presence father not not just to see one another not just to hear a great teaching or Lord to have a good service but that we might come to see you Lord as the two men said as they walked on the road to EMAs Lord we look forward to our hearts burning as you talk with us along the way Lord we commit the service to you we want to welcome you that you would have your perfect will Lord that what's done here would be the work of God and not the work of men Lord you know the desire of each one that's come through that door the needs that they have needs perhaps that they don't even know themselves Lord each of us Lord looking to you to make us more and more like you we pray once again that the service would be done according to your will that every need would be met we pray these things in jesus' name amen wel be seated we are uh going to read Psalm 12 23 this morning it's uh just a few short verses it's a little Psalm and it it begins with a simple statement it says unto thee lift I up mine eyes oh thou that dwellest in the heavens you know it's very similar to a scripture that's just two chapters away that is probably more familiar to us and Psalm 121 it says I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord you know both scriptures speak of one lifting up their eye and setting their sight on the Lord and you know it describes where we should have our eye what our eyes should be fixed on you know probably everyone in this room would say Amen to the idea that we need to keep our eyes on Jesus know Paul said it this way in Hebrews 12 he said looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith you know brother Bram made an interesting statement in a sermon he preached entitled Look Away to Jesus and he said this about our need to keep our eyes on the Lord he said now you might say we have heard this generation after generation we've heard this for a long time that is true and it has been preached for a long time many ministers has took this same text thousands of them but here is the thing I want to ask you tonight for these next few minutes when you look uh the question is what do you see amen when you look amen that's right what do you see when you do look that only depends Hallelujah on what you're looking for you know and that was kind of on my mind as I was looking at Psalm 123 where it says unto thee lift up mine eyes oh thou that dwellest in the heavens the question is in the psalm what is he looking for in what way is he looking if you move on to verse two he says behold as the eyes of the servants look under the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God Amen now remember what brother brandham said what do you see when you look amen it depends on how you look and what you're looking for and here in Psalm 123 he compares the looking to a servant or a maid waiting watching the hand of the master this is a different kind of looking you know it's not just waiting to hear from the master with the expect ation of hearing his voice it's watching The Master's Hand anticipating his needs not sitting in another room somewhere you know waiting to hear his voice this is being already close enough to him to be able to anticipate and recognize his desire even without him speaking already so familiar so practiced so close that you're able to watch the Master's Hand and be sensitive to the slightest move and know what he wants done nobody heard anything nobody felt anything but you saw it if you need somebody to shout you're not close enough to the master you know there's a story in Matthew 8 of a centurion that came to Jesus on behalf of one of his servants Now understand that a centurion was an important man an officer in the Roman army who was responsible for 100 soldiers it would be the equivalent of a captain in one of today's militaries and as the captain of an occupying Army he was perhaps the most important man in town Matthew 8 verse 5 and when Jesus was entered into capernium there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of the paly grievously tormented you remember the story Jesus said in verse 7 I will come and heal him now it was that simple he said yes and he was already on his way to do the move but then this Centurion who was the most important man in town said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority notice what he says I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth Hallelujah and to another come and he cometh yeah and to my servant do this and he doeth it Hallelujah so my question is is when he had a need why didn't he he had hundreds of soldiers uhhuh hundreds of servants oh my most important man in town and he could have he could even taken a person off the street and told him what to go do and he didn't done it so without any question without any choice they would have had to go do as he asked you know the scripture goes on to say in verse 10 that Jesus marveled at this he said I haven't seen Faith like this anywhere in Israel and of course he did just that he spoke the word and the servant was healed but my question is this what made this servant so special that this servant was so trusted so valued that this Centurion the most important man in town would come down into the streets into the gutters himself to bring this request personally to Jesus for this servant this servant why you know a servant one who's under a master responds to every word of his master or her mistress you know they say do this do that there's no choice there's no option and a good servant will respond and be sensitive to the voice but the real close real trusted real valued servants they're the ones that are so valued so loved that a great man would do anything pay any price for that servant are so close so in tune with the master that they only need to watch his hand and they can tell by the way he moves the direction he starts to look because they know the master they already know his desire and his need and are ready to move they already know what his need is because they're so practiced at watching him move that he doesn't even have to speak they see him begin to move and they know what he wants done they just need to sit sit there and watch his hand they knew when he needed a drink they knew when he needed his shoes they knew when he needed the fire and immediately he'd be about the work that's an Irreplaceable servant you know have you ever been to a restaurant where you had a waiter or a waitress that you never even had to ask for anything the moment you set your glass down and they were there and filled it you set your plate in a certain way they were there picking it up they already knew that you needed more bread you didn't even have to ask because they were watching your hand and you'll pay any price for a waiter like that Psalm 1232 behold as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a Maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our Lord or so so our eyes wait upon the Lord you know as brother brandham said what do you see when you look what are you looking for it depends on how you look you know as Believers no doubt we've desired a we we've developed a habit when we have a need or we have a desire or we have a request we set our eyes on the Lord and we seek his face we ask to hear his voice we read the word we listen to a tape come to church services and desire to hear from him but the question is are our eyes set on him such are we so close to him that our eyes are carefully watching how he moves and we know him enough to recognize when he's leaning a certain way or he's leaning another way we often look to him to meet our needs but is our eyes so fixed on him that we can anticipate his needs and be ready to move you know a trusted servant is one who's so close to the master will watch his hand and anticipate his needs he becomes an extension of the Master's Hand the Master's Hand begins to move this way and the servant completes the work the master starts to turn his eye here and the servant completes the work an extension of the master any servant can respond to a shout in the house any servant can respond when the right sound is played on the Bell or the the instrument but how many servants are so close to him that they just watch how he moves and they're there anticipating his needs let's go ahead and stand you know my prayer is that the Lord would help me to be so close so sensitive to his hand so aware of him that I can anticipate his desire that I know what he wants done amen with his word help me not to be one of those who need shouting to respond that need some instrument to play to respond that need detailed instructions or great hours of study to respond but so focused on his desire that I can be be there when he moves let's go ahead and read Psalm 123 this morning it's just a short Psalm unto thee lift I up mine eyes oh thou that dwellest in the heavens behold as the eyes of servants look under the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God until that he have mercy upon us have mercy upon us O Lord have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease and with the contempt of The Proud amen amen you may have your seats man let's sing that

been my portion and my strength and My Hope surely the Lord hath made a way for me the great way maker we ask that you would bless that to us this morning we ask your guidance and your goodness to us and mercy this morning morning we pray in jesus' name amen amen hallelujah if you have your Bibles let's open this morning to St John the 14th chapter and then we're going to uh it go to the 16th chapter and read a verse of scripture there amen so um I just got out we had an hour this morning of preliminaries now I get my hour and a half amen I mean I don't want to cut myself short you know no we just want to love we want to listen to a little portion of sermon this morning but let's listen to these great scriptures here as the Lord tells us we're going to continue on on our subject no Bible no books no tapes the Faith of Our Fathers and I'd like to call this portion of that no Bibles no books no tapes possessors of eternal life and uh so we know that our that what is supposed to be restored to us in this day is the Faith of Our Fathers so we want to start to comprehend what was it that they must have had that they had no books no tapes and no Bible and yet they wrote the book of Acts so it's a it's a fabulous thought if we could enter into it and I believe that our prophet of God unfolds this to us in so many ways as he was trying to get the modern church back to the experience that they had in the beginning and he says Jesus and this is the 14th chapter and the 12th verse he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified IED in the sun now that's a key verse because he's giving them a promise he's giving them something that they can go out with right they're get they're going to be commissioned so when they meet people they have to know that whatsoever I ask in the father's name he'll do so hold that there because this is what makes you real that's right without this you're just words okay we don't want to be words do we want to be life in flesh amen amen am mean he says and if ye love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father amen and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever amen amen even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen these These are the keys to the Faith of Our Fathers amen they possess something shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you oh no wonder he can say go wait I will come to you go wait up there until I come amen he he said I have come yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me amen and I in you that's what all of us want to come to the revelation of and know beyond the shadow of a doubt he's here amen let's also turn to John 16 and the 13th verse he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself self but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray this morning amen you may be seated uh uh we just uh we want to say this this morning uh to you that uh We've we've uh finally come to the uh the top of the hill as far as the building next door door goes now we're starting downhill U and but uh the uh uh we're going to start sheet rocking uh tomorrow Lord willing and um so I just want to let you know when you do sheetrock there's a lot of white d D everywhere so you're welcome to go in there and get Dusty if you like and you want your kids to track that dust into your cars that's okay with me uh there'll be drywall mud everywhere and that gets all squishy and tracky but you're more than welcome to to walk around in there and get dirty and dusty and muddy uh that's fine but parents it's your call okay so we just want to say that pray that everything goes well uh after we get it drywalled and painted we'll need a lot of help uh I'm sure that we'll pick a color that not all of you are going to be happy with but that's too bad as long as I like it you know what I mean so so that's that's how it's going to be okay and then if if uh if you can find a church to go to that'll paint it just the color you want it that's fine with me also but anyway because we're not here to build churches we're here to make the Rapture is that what we're here for so we understand that God sent us a messenger to restore back to us the Faith of Our Fathers cuz without faith Faith it's impossible to please God and it's not man-made Faith it's god-given faith faith is a revelation and God reveals something to you and you're able to recognize it as God it speaks to something that's within you there's something inside of you that responds to it you know it's his voice because the script R says my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow and I I want to share with you before we go into listening to 29 minutes of the message leadership you'll see where our sermon going but I'd like to play for you a a a just a one quot or I'm not play for you put it on the board from the voice of the sign the the voice of the sign and we know that God never comes forth am and does the supernatural without a message following and the message is the voice of the sign so if if I would to do something there would have to be an intention and in purpose of why that I have done it and the reason that I did it was to reveal to you or show you something or get a message to you so that would be the voice of the sign would be the purpose and the reason that the sign was done and the message for the sign God didn't come in this generation and turn his back to the audience and say like oh there's a sister in the fifth row uh wearing such and such and I see her right here and I see her at a doctor's office and I see the doctor examining her and I see this is what he says and and it be exactly right amen you know what I mean he did those things so the church would recognize that what he was saying it came from the father now for those that have that God's opened our eyes and given us a deeper Revelation that should have been good enough just as him being a prophet but for those who understood greater what God was doing that was the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ back in a different Corporal body no difference between the spirit but now the son of man didn't come in the created body of Jesus Christ now it came in a redeemed body and it was the same Lord Jesus Christ veiled in flesh in our day doing the same signs that he did 2,000 years ago so the Gentile Church would be on equal basis [Music] amen and he he performed that right out before us God sitting in our gener generation and and doing uh the the supernatural Amen in order to get his elect lady that he knew who would be here in this age and this time amen focused on tuned into the Word of Promise that that there's going to be a resurrection ction yeah and a Rapture and that that's what is the key element of everything that we were now okay I like you to listen to this quote um and to me it Matthew shared this with me and I I just thought it was so wonderful I don't know if he read it to you Wednesday night or not I don't recall but listen to what he says he says God will build his church upon upon the foundation of Jesus Christ and that's the Bible outside of that all other ground is sinking sand God doesn't change his nature amen his nature doesn't change so we know if God ever does something one way the first time he does it the same way the second time so whatever he did in the first church he has to do in the last Church he's never changed it every age it's been by Revelation even uh Martin Luther had Revelation and he moved by faith in the portion of the spirit that was given to him to move and he did a great thing out of the Catholic church that was no easy thing and Wesley and we could go on but now let's read the rest of this together and see how phenomenal this was preached in 64 and and it it's it's right up here if you want to read it say this he made women different from man and man different from woman he dressed them different he wants them to stay that way see woman wants to look like man and man wants to look like woman oh my such a perversion the whole thing looks like it's got a grip on the people and you can't change it now think of it in the hour we're living in in 64 he's saying man wants to be woman it's a dark cloud that's got a grip on the people and they can't change it look where it's brought them to look where it's brought him to the sports world is all upset because these men are coming over and they're claiming to be women and they're swimming and running and playing sports and and and and then they claim there's no difference God said he made them different and he wanted them to stay that way but look at he says it he says it's got a grip on the people you can't change it it looks like a great monster a great Blackness if you understand what I'm speaking of it in the spirit amen a great monster amen a great Darkness over the people amen now you are living in the age that there's a great Darkness a a monster over the people amen now think of the power of that monster amen that it could take a a person a man and have such an effect on him that he wants to be a woman and vice versa and the world's just trying to say oh it's natural now i' say that because this spirit is going to it's going to come against our children amen and I want you to know know that it's not that their gender confused it's not that they don't know whether they're a man or a woman or not it's this great monster and you've got to be able to look at that and say that's a great monster it's a trying to grip my child and I'm going to stand up against it I mean we know how far this monster have has taken it the hormone therapy change operations and everything it is a monster a great Dark Cloud that's got its grip on the people and they can't change it oh no wonder Jesus is the way the truth the life a monster has got got them grabbed and they they just can't get away from it it's too much Hollywood too much television too much other nonsense everything we got is polluted no wonder if the work isn't cut short for the elect sake there would be no flesh saved so what what message do I grab out of that I see that now he tells me it's going to be cut short that's right so I I I I got to say oh I better get my act together you you understand I better I better get serious here I might not have much time and you know that's the thing with you know with youth is you think you'll live forever and then one morning you wake up and that knee hardly starts to shake when you put it on the floor you know and your back aches you know what I mean you slept 10 hours and you're still tired you know that's natural think of think of the spiritual man how quick he's dying in this generation I heard a lady on the news the other day one of those programs she said I get so sick of people bringing this stuff up out of the Bible amen I said yeah well one day you'll meet that stuff in the Bible am now listen what he goes on to say he says everything he says it cut short for the elect sake no F say you say I never knew that before well now you know it from now on see I better stop that let's go back now you know it now you know it oh it's I've never it's exposed we know what it is when you sit back and you say what is going on it's a great monster amen that's gripped the people they can't helps they can't can't stop there's only one way out and that's God's provided way amen so we're talking this morning as we're talking about this church that is going to be restored in us and so we understand from what we just read that these believers they didn't have books they didn't have Bibles they didn't have tapes so God promised them something he had to give them something do you understand to lead them lead them and to guide them and that's what he said he said when the spirit of truth comes when the spirit that I promised you I would not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end the spirit that he promised them he said I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again so he he told those Believers you go up here and you wait cuz he had some work to finish he had to go to the souls in prison we we understand those things we're not going to go into great lengthy teachings but we want to keep it simple he said you wait cuz I'm going to come again and when that happens amen you will know that I'm in the father amen the father is in me and I'm in you now this is what we want to settled this morning it's an individual Affair it's not a group Affair you've got to come to the place that you answer that question in your heart is he in me if he's not it's okay you've got a promise you can have them come into you it's a very simple formula repent be honest with yourself be honest with your life these are the things I'm doing these are the things I'm staying the SE are the wages of sin is death the gift of God's eternal life I I I I recognize I'm weak I I I I recognize I'm a failure Lord I'm sorry I can't do it myself I don't have the ability in me I'm sorry I Repent amen and then when that repentance is sincere amen amen you you step into the pool of baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you're baptized for the remission of your sins that to let you know that you've done your part then he does his part and he says I promise you if you shall repent of your sins ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so in the beginning the question was these men are drunk yeah no they're not drunk as you would suppose this is what was promised that Joel prophesied I'll pour out my spirit upon my sons and my daughters so they saw that these men that were cowards a few hours ago are now have possession of something amen their faith was not intellectual their faith was possession something came into them amen and then when these men ask what must we do to get this Same Spirit that's dwelling in you dwelling in US amen amen that's what they wanted amen now see this is what the prophet of God's trying to get the church back to but the church has gone in elect they didn't have a Bible they didn't have a book they didn't have a tape they couldn't take the experience and then bring it to the letter and kill it for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen amen amen FK they had to have something that was genuine those men had to see the the evidence aren't these unlearned and ignorant men who are these guys speaking in unknown languages speaking all kinds of great works of the spirit of God moving so he had to give them something that was going to lead them and guide them remember they didn't have a book they didn't have a tape they didn't have a Bible but God was going to give them something that would that they would possess that would lead them and guide them into all truth and all righteousness now that's is where I'd like to start and keeping that thought in mind we want to listen to 29 minutes and I I I I believe that our messenger's worth listening to am if he could absolutely tell us in 64 about a monster that was coming amen that was going to grip the people and it was going to make men want to be women and women want to be men I I think it would it would take behoove us to pay attention the message is leadership so picture these people our disciples without a book without a Bible without a tape they got to start their Journey they need something to lead them let's just listen the 29 minutes if you would of the book leadership we're starting at paragraph I think it's uh let me see if I can think of the paragraph we're starting at uh paragraph around paragraph 96 uh and uh and we're just going to go to about paragraph um somewhere paragraph uh one uh somewhere around 170 or or somewhere right in there but anyway the brothers know where to stop it listen this morning but I want you to listen it from the ears of the Prophet telling us you need something to lead you there's a great Dark Cloud out there that's trying to grip the people you can't navigate he said you can't get away from it now you know you we always say they can't get that's he said you got to watch this Dark Cloud if you don't watch it it's going to get you if you don't have something to lead you and guide you it's going to take hold of you so it's marvelous what we have in this hour so let us just listen as he's trying to uh uh put into our hearts the the importance of having leadership and then to tonight's communion uh we won't do um much preaching tonight we'll go straight into the communion service for all of you who know that if you want to make the Rapture you can you must take communion for those that don't you're on your own you know you can try to make it without it if you want to you know I just don't you just got to decide what's leading you you and where your priorities are but listen to how important leadership is God bless you 29 minutes I think you can stay awake for that I hope amen God bless you the first step you've probably ever taken in your life speaking of leadership it was probably the hands of some kind old mother them hands may be still tonight out here in some Cemetery somewhere but that was a hand that held you to to make your first step then after your mother taught you how to walk and you make a few steps and fall down and get up and you thought you were doing great things then she turns you over to the school teacher and then she begin to lead you to an education how what you must do and how you must learn and and so forth like that then after the school teacher got through with you then you returned back your father got a hold of you then when your father got a hold of you he taught you perhaps your business how to be a successful businessman how to do things right your mother taught you how to be a a housewife how to cook and so forth like that then after they got through with you then your minister or priest got a hold of you but now who leads you that's the question now now we're all led by something tonight we have to be we're LED it notice now let's uh look at this young Fell's uh what had influenced him let's look at the uh this young businessman we would call him because he was a businessman he was a great successful man let's look at his leaders perhaps first his mother had taught him as a little boy the things that he should do his father had made him such a fine success and maybe left him left him an inheritance because because he was a ruler himself perhaps his father was gone so he is a a businessman he was uh let's call him today like a Christian businessman or he was a religious businessman I think would be the best quotation this man was religious he was by no means an Infidel and he had been taught by his mother how to do right how to walk how to addess himself he had been taught by his father a great business and how to be a successful man and his business was successful and father and mother had been raised up in the church and appointed him to the priest and the priest had made him a real religious man therefore he was a fine cultured man he was a fine a boy with good character if Jesus Christ looked at him and loved him there was something about the boy it was real right for the Bible said here we find out in Mark and Jesus beholding him loved him yeah Jesus beholding him loved him so therefore there must be something real outstanding about this young fellow he was had a good character a good character reading he was a man that was raised right intelligent smart intellectual successful in business and a religious man he had a lot of good characteristics that was outstanding so much that it attracted the attention of Jesus Christ the Savior but when he was confronted being successful in all these other things nothing had went wrong he was perfectly cut out right measured up right intelligent right education his success his smart a fine businessman probably belonged to a businessman's group somewhere there in Palestine he might have belonged to a businessman's fellowship like we have here tonight no doubt he did because businessman has always had fellowships with another one with the other because just like birds of a feather they have things to talk about and if it's the religious man they don't want to talk about the man that runs the bar room and the all of them together because they have nothing in common we've got to have things in common so Christians has things in common with Christians Sinners has things in common with with Sinners and and societies and whatever they are they have things in common this young boy probably belonged to a uh businessman's fellowship and he was religious as he could be because Jesus in questioning here he said I have kept these Commandments observed them all from my youth that's right see he had been brought up right taught right and everything but when he was confronted with the uh the thought of eternal life now I want you to notice with all this character that he had he yet knew he did not possess eternal life now all of our societies our church our membership and the things that we hold so dear our American societies and everything is very fine there's nothing to be said against that and our Christian businessman Society here is a great thing it's been an open door for me to on my interdenominational thoughts that we are Christians there is no one no one denomination can claim us real Christian because you belong to God denominations are man-made and Christianity is Heavens sent but in all these things that we have as good as they are as fine as we come together and As Nice of meetings as we have and social understanding that we have yet we are each one confronted with eternal life amen no matter how successful we've been in business how successful we've been and what a great church member we are how we work how we try to do things right still if it's not done in the right way it is a worship of God in vain Jesus cled that the same way as I stop here for a moment he said in vain do you worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of man now I think of sincere honest worship with the sincerity of your heart to God and still be in vain it began that way with Cain at the Garden of Eden sincere worship but was rejected very religious still rejected a sort last week week before last at a businessman's meeting a breakfast there where several hundreds of people had gathered I took two and a half hours to speak on doing God a service without being God's will now that sounds strange strange but we've got to channel ourselves into God's provided Channel and God's way of doing it no matter how much we think it's right it's got to be according to the word of the Lord or it's in vain Cain worshiped but it wasn't according to the word of the Lord the Pharisees worshiped but not according to the word of the Lord and in this particular message to the businessman I taught this David he wanted to do the Lord a service and he was right in what he said he said is it right for the Ark of the Lord to be down there let's bring it up here in the days of the king the other king he succeeded he said it's not right they never consulted the Lord by the ark but we must do it now that's correct what they should have done he said we should go get the ark and we could consult the Lord and that's right it was down in another country said we got to bring it up here get it up here and put it in our house here and Worship the Lord now notice he went in the wrong channel to do it he consulted the captain of 50s and hundreds and thousands they all was consulted everyone seeing it was the will of the Lord look like or it was a the word of the Lord the word of the Lord sometimes you have to put it in its right place or it's not the will of the Lord I'll let that soap deep and you'll get a a general conception of what I'm trying to say I don't want the church to fall into the steps that you found over there in England long hair and painted faed man and perver we don't want that no matter how religious it sounds and how much Elvis Presley can sing religious songs he's still at evil I'm no judge but by their fruits you know them he's a Pentecostal but that don't make a bit of difference your fruits bear record what you are no matter if the spirit comes up on him he could speak in tongues he could shout he could heal the sick and Jesus said many of them will come to me in that day and say Lord Haven not done this and that and I say depart from me you that work iniquity I never even knew you we've got to be real genine Christians and the only way we can do that is confronted with this question here of eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that comes from God and he for ordained every creature that would ever have it just just as you was a Jane in your father you was a Jane in God one of his attributes to begin with or you'll never be there you come forth in the beding ground of your mother your father didn't know you you were in his Lawns and when you come forth in the bedding ground of the mother then you become a human being and made in the image of your father now you can fellowship with him in the same thing by God if you got eternal life the life that you come in the Natural Life physical life that was by your father and the only way you can come born again is the only way is it has to be from your heavenly father is attributes all the father has given me will come to me see you are here because your name were placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world that's exactly right you're a Jane a spiritual Jane out of your heavenly father a part of God's word that be so as I've said then you was with Jesus when he was sh because he was the word amen you suffered with him died with him buried with him and Rose with him and now sitting in Heavenly places in him notice David thought everything was fine and he consulted all these people and they everyone be to dance and shout and scream they had all the religious motions that there was but still it wasn't God's will to go down and bring the word of God back to the house of God but you see God always in all ages Works through one way his first decision is his only decision because he's perfect in his decisions he never does nothing except he first reveals it to his servants the prophets exactly that's why this the church age that we live in there's no church no Methodist Baptist Pentecostals or anything else can ever put this church into the bride it'll have to be the answering of Malachi four for God to send a prophet to be revealed to because that's the only way our churches denominate and throw the thing into a mess and huddle it's like they've always been and God always sends the prophets and there was Nathan standing in the land of Vindicated Prophet before God and he wasn't even consulted and they went down there and cus the life of an honest man and so forth and took the ark instead of putting on the shoulders of the Levites to pack it they put it on a cart to pack it all together messed up uh you see if you don't go according to the the will of God and the way that God has give us to go they all always get it messed up and take it off in some organization denomination some message and there you go see it's always been done that way that's the same thing that this boy was confronted with he come in he' been a a a member of maybe the Pharisees or Sadducees or some great uh order of that day he was religious as he could be he said I've observed these Commandments that have been taught since it was a youth see and Jesus loved him for it but he refused to be guided he he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him eternal life notice he believed there was something different than what he had or he would have never said good Master what must I do now see he want to do something himself that's way we do we want to do something our the gift of God is a free gift God give it to you don't do one thing for it he ordained it to you and you're going to have it see notice he knew it was there he believed in it and wanted it but when he was confronted with how he had to do it it was different from his ritual it was different he could hold his money and belong on to the church that he belonged to and so forth but Jesus knew that and knew it hoarded this money and he said go sell all you've got and give it to the poor and come take up your cross and follow me and you'll have Treasures in Heaven but he couldn't do it the other leaders that he had had in his youthful days had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided way which was Jesus Christ the only one who holds eternal life the only one that can give you not the church can't give you eternal life not your neighbor not your pastor not your priest not your Creed only Jesus Christ himself can give you eternal life no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person amen of the Lord Jesus Christ then when you do that he is the word and then your life fits right in the word and it manifest itself to this age that you're living in Noah had to do that for the word to be manifested in his age now what if Moses come along and said we know what Noah done we'll take Noah's uh word we'll do it this way Noah did it we'll build a Ark and float down the aisle River and go out of Egypt what wouldn't have work see that was another age Jesus couldn't have come with Moses message Luther couldn't come with the Catholic message Wesley couldn't come with the Luther's message the Pentecost couldn't come with the Wesley message and the bride can't be formed in the Pentecostal denomination it just can't do it that's exactly right she's done organized and went out here and there she sits just like the rest of them it's a shook just like the life comes up to the see that writer as I spoke the other night that writer that wrote this book not he criticized me so bad said I was the devil U if there was such a thing so he said he didn't believe in God he said a God that could fold his arms and set up and watch them Martyrs through the early ages and claimed to have power to open the Red Sea and let them women and children be tore to Pieces by lines and so forth and then said he was a loving God so there's no such a creature see the fellow without inspiration of the word fails to see it the first corn of wheat the bridegroom had to fall into the the Earth in order to rise again so did the first bride that was born at Pentecost had to go through that Dark Ages like any other seed be buried they had to die they must do it but it started sprouting again and Luther in the First Reformation it did look like the seed that when it was the light of that day the L St then went on into the tosel Wesley and from the tossel it went into Pentecost the shov when you see into the the whe when it comes forth the corn of wheat a man that's raised wheat you go out and see that wheat farm in there it looks just exactly like the grain but if you'll take a tweezer and sit down and take that wheat and open it up there's no grain there at all it's just a Shook and then what is it's Farm there to hold the green see and then the first thing you know the life left the the the stalk to go into the tossle left the tossle go into the shook it leaves the Shook and goes into the wheat three stages see of it and then forms the wheat outside of the three stages Luther Wesley Pentecost just exactly see no doubt you can't interrupt nature now look every three years after a message has went forth sent from God they organized this has been 20 years and there's no organization it won't see now the Shu has to pull away give the wheed a chance to lay before the sun to ripen um the message coming right back into the church again forming the body of Jesus Christ just like the first rig one that went into the ground now to see go the eternal life the life sure the the stalk back here carried the life certainly it did but you see when it become the stalk and it was finished the organization the life went right on into Wesley come right out one and watch each one of them one a big blade don't look like the grain but when the little pollen comes like the on the the sh on the stock the pollen of the tossel it looks a whole lot like the green but when it comes down to that shook it's almost there did Jesus say in the last days Matthew 24:24 the two would be so close it would deceive the very Janss predestinated the elected ones if it was possible almost like the real things so in the last days now you see it's wheat time now it's getting Harvest Time this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecost age this is a bride age as Moses called a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church you see the same thing in type take them to the Glorious Eternal promised land now to refuse that person that's doing the calling Christ no matter if you're Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever you are you got to this age nothing against them not at all but in this age now you've got to accept like they did in that age the person of Christ which is the word in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 138 see you must accept that person of eternal life and what life Luther had was justification Wesley had sanctification added to it the Pentecost had the restoration of the gifts coming back and added to it but now it's completing in the body you see the three phases of it and out of that now when the Resurrection comes the life that lived in them lutherans just went out the life that lived in the methodists went out the life that went in the Pentecostals will all be raptured out of the ground in the body of the Bride to be taken in before Jesus Christ glory to God oh it's exciting it's the truth hallelujah we've turned a corner hallelujah we're looking towards heaven watching farther coming a cap on the pyramid as we would say it's coming back The Church Must Be resurrected soon and we must get ready and the only way you can is not say well I belong to the assemblies I belong to the Oneness Tess or whatever it is all them there I belong to the Church of God that don't mean a thing Our Father shouted and danced that's perfectly all right that was their day but today you're confronted not with the organization that they made but with the life that's going on which is Jesus Christ this young fellow had done the same thing Moses wrote those Commandments but you see the same God that wrote The Commandments by his Prophet was the same thing it prophesied the day would come I'll raise up a prophet like it unto me and it'll come to pass that all that don't hear him will be cut off back in the denominational Shucks and toses they must go on to life and today don't say I'm Pentecost I belong to this I belong to that that don't mean nothing you've got to accept the person Christ eternal life confronts every one of us don't forget that the other leaders you see it had such a hold on it there people just talk well we belong to this and we belong to that and had such a hold on it but what a fatal thing to reject the leadership of eternal life now that life is present tonight amen that's right the holy spirit is your which is Christ in spirit form his Spirit the anointing is your a little while the world seeth me no more yet ye will see me for I'll be with you even in you to the consummation to the end of the world Jesus alone can lead you to that eternal life there's no church no denomination no preacher no priest no nothing else can lead you to it you must be led by him amen the only one that can lead you could you imagine him leading you out of his word which that's him and if he is the word and you're a part of him won't you be a part of the word the word that God wants to pour the Waters of Salvation upon today to identify him today like the apostles identified him like Luther like Wesley like the people in them days identified him this is another age it's a word the word said these things that we're seeing taking place now is predicted to take place in this hour so accept Jesus Christ and let him lead you to the eternal life though he had achieved this young fellow he had achieved all good things in school been fine as a good boy no doubt he' been good as a real father and listened to his daddy and business he'd been a good a good boy good to his parents he' been loyal to his priest he' been loyal to his church he had been loyal to the Commandments of God but but he lost the greatest thing and the rest of them didn't mean very much to him when he turned down the leadership of eternal life Jesus Christ notice this leadership confronts every one of us today the same thing as it did that young man we no matter how religious we are you may be Catholic you may be Baptist Methodist or you may be Pentecostals or whatever you are this same thing confronts you tonight amen eternal life that's acceptance of Jesus Christ we are given this opportunity sometime in life we have to confront the thing just like this young man did because you are a mortal being and you're giving the you're giving the opportunity of choice you have a choice God made it so you can choose if he put Adam and Eve on free moral agency so they could choose and then they made the wrong choice and see he can do no more to you than he did to them he's got to put you the same thing so you can choose or reject you have a choice let's look at some of them you have a choice as a young man whether you're going to have an education or not you have that choice you can want to just not to have it you can just refuse it you have a choice of your cond up I'm going to hurt just a little bit here you can go out and let your hair grow down and be a beetle or some of these ignoramuses are you women you can look like a a decent human being or you can be one of these weired creatures that we have out there that glued eyes and Waterhead haircuts and things are completely against the word of God which is absolutely contrary not even offer couldn't offer a prayer to be accepted that's true exactly right it's what the Bible said but what's happened to you church you've seen so much television so much things the world it's so easy for your old Adam nature to drift into that to act like the rest of them may I repeat this again again in the kosha in the offering of the the the atonement in the days of Moses when Moses brought the children out there was to be seven days that there was to be no 11 among the people anyone knows that in Exodus no 11 should be found in your camp at all seven days that seven days represent the full seven Church ages amen no 11 now you can't do it you've got to come to one thing to believe you're either going to believe God you're going to believe your church you're going to believe the world you're you cannot mix it together and you can't hold of them old things that the other Church before you did you've got to take the message of the hour he said what was left over don't let it stay till morning to come into this other age burn it with fire be destroyed that the age that you're living in the message of this age has got to be brought out of the scriptures and Vindicated and proved by God that it's God doing so then you either receive that or reject it that's eternal life Leadership of the Holy Spirit leading his church we can stay on that a long time let's move just keep moving along the choice of your conduct you could you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward Expressions shows exactly what's on the inside amen the cucker many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so it's exactly right look here you are a outside person you have five senses that contacts that outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him your Earthly home SE taste feel smell and here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five Outlets conscience and love and so forth five Outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts the physical your spiritual contacts the spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul that soul is that janeen that come from God and like a baby formed in its mother's womb when the baby comes into the uh to the mother's womb but the little germ crawls into the egg it doesn't form one cell a human the next a dog the next a cat the next a horse it's all human cells because it's building off of an original human cell and when a man has been born again by the word of God predestinated to eternal life called the elected it'll be word of God on top of word word on word not a denomination a Creed and then a word and a Creed it won't work you can't have that LE in it only one eternal life Jesus Christ the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us friends you feed my children you send me across of mission fields to the world to bring the message I got to be sincere with you what I'm looking at maybe you don't see that's what I'm here to try to tell you it's not because I don't love people it's because I do love people Hallelujah corrective when I see the slipping of the church going all say well we did this and we did that and look around over the church and see the it just won't work then look here in the Bible and see it's got to be that way at the end that lukewarm Lady of see Church age putting Jesus out the word you never call you go call church he said as many as I love I rebuke I chasten them amen taking the word and pound it on and telling you're wrong in it that's the reason I love you if you'll open the door let me in I'll come in and suck with you not a church she's done put out of that she's headed for The ecumenical council that's where she's gone right back in the room where she come from and that exactly I got that wrote on paper from 25 years ago 33 years ago and there it is not only that wrote in the Bible from En Vision she's gone back there's no way of saving it's gone it's going to be that way God's calling individuals I stand at the door and knock If any man any person one individual out of a thousand it might be one out of a million I could preach two years and not cover what we just heard I mean there there's so many things but we're just trying to keep it in our little thought of of where we're at today just to awaken ourselves to all the things that were said that there's a way that seems right unto a man and and that so we're looking at this church and they they didn't have anything to make the choices with so we what what I I'm trying to get at is is that intellect was not the way that God chose to run the church or by knowledge amen you understand so he doesn't change so what he did in the beginning the way he started his church and the way he founded his church was the way that he wanted that church to continue and it was by the end individual Affair of each individual accepting the person of Jesus Christ and having that leadership and so what slipped out of the church what is the leadership of the Holy Spirit men and women being led by the spirit of God these people they didn't have a book to go to they didn't have a Bible to go to they they had to go to prayer they had to go into the presence of the Lord amen and have the spirit of God give them holy unction they they they they had to be moved upon by the spirit of God and if you start reading your Bible from that aspect you start seeing he said God has given us a holy unction so he's bringing the church back he he he he he's bringing the church back to that Affair that they have where they come into His presence and they have to hear from him they have a choice that lays before him they have all kinds of voices around them everybody giv them bits of knowledge you should do this you should do that you should do that they didn't have a book to go to they didn't have a Bible to go to they didn't have a tape to listen too they they had to have the the spirit of God speak to them expressly the spirit SP in their heart they had to have that relationship and each of you and myself all of us together we we've got to make sure that uh relationship is established we we've got to we've got to know cuz that's what he gave the church now he says now knowledge is not leadership am you you understand that knowledge is not leadership and that what you can do you can have a Bible and have all kinds of knowledge amen amen you can have a book and have all kinds of knowledge you can listen to a tape and have all all kinds of knowledge the the the word is the word doesn't Quicken you it's the spirit that quickens you it's the spark that word won't move unless the spirit of God reveals that word to you and leads you in the way to be moved and so this is what's happened that what what happened is the church replaced leadership with knowledge they PE leadership with education they they they they replace leadership with doctrines and Creeds and and interpretations and so what what you can do with knowledge you can take that that knowledge and do what you want to or what you think with it amen you can just take the Bible and interpret it anyway you say that's not true go down the street every corner has got a building on it that says this is the way we interpret the Bible right this is what our knowledge has brought us to you know my mother's a Catholic and and uh you know lesli and I'll be at the house and she'll have the rosary on her TV you know we'll have to listen to the rosary you know you know the rosary is a kind of a shape beads and you say three hell mares and five our fathers and Glory bees and and they'll just be in there praying you know they don't ask God for anything it's just it it's just so ritualistic that but you ought to hear them talk oh they quote about the Lord and they talk about the spirit of the Lord and the goodness of God and everything totally oblivious if you would say that they're the that the Pope the Vicor of Christ is the Antichrist Church the mark of the beast why they didn't they would never believe any of that but you're elected you weren't elected to intellect you weren't elected the knowledge you weren't elected to have me come here and teach you my Revel ation that's right you're elected to know that you can have an individual relationship and God can lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness that you'll have choices put before you and you don't want to make those choices by intellect even when you listen to a tape we just listen to a tape there was so much in that tape that that was meat upon meat that was steak that was that was uh roasts that was I mean I couldn't Express that's the whole cow it's phenomenal what we just heard and he's saying I'm seeing the church slip I love you I'm trying to tell you something the church has lost its leadership you've got to ask yourself do I have leadership in my life and is my leadership from him or am I just set a drift am I just going through every day making choices in decisions not knowing where those choices and decisions are taking me look at that first church when I think of them I think that those those they had to they they how did they make their choices they didn't have anything to read they didn't have anything to listen to they made their choices by prayer and fellowship one with another they made their choices by waiting for his presence to come down and get an unction and get a revelation it's like a young man meeting a woman she may be she may be very beautiful you understand but a beautiful girl can hit you with the pan you know you need to get down till you you have that satisfaction in Your Heart Lord I really feel that this is the way that that I need to go until you're satisfied same thing you're not attracted by the outward senses you're not attracted by those things you're attracted by what's in your heart what's in your soul that part of you that's God you've got a part inside of you that's God that's what you need to get Quicken and relationship and brought life you can have the word on all these other dimensions but we want that word to connect with the part of God that's us then that's where we make our choices amen that's what we they made their choices through through uh uh they made their choices by by by Prayer by getting in the spirit by having the Holy Spirit move on them by holy unction until they knew it was God they prayed through true now the message didn't take that away from us it tried to restore it back to us that's right the messenger was trying to restore it back to us that God still speaks he still moves he still can do exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think he can still heal he can still deliver am am he's not dead amen get them out of your mind and into your heart but you can take all these other things and and you can make a choice based on this and still not be his will because we have that nature we wanted our way but when we can push past that and come to that leadership look at this church look at this first church they they couldn't they they only had one thing to explain their choices and that was their life am they only had one thing to back up their words that was their life you can take this book and argue with somebody and say it's here it's here you can live any way you want to and take this book you you don't even have to live right you can just hand somebody a book this is what I'm trying to tell you no let your light so shine amongst men that your good works glorify your father in Heaven it wasn't meant to be brought down to just a mechanical device this word that was brought in our day was returning this church back to the same leadership that they had at the day of Pentecost it was restoring back the faith now we had a sheep offering we had a light we had somebody that was standing in front of us that was led by that Spirit he was an influenced by cre he wasn't influenced by Doctrine he wasn't influenced by money he was the first fruit of that church rising up amen that's right now when Jesus was the first fruit of that church he rose up he said the works that I do you shall do also because I send you a comforter I will come again I'll be with you I'll be in you and that day you'll know amen that the word's in you and that word is not going to be contrary to what was written what was spoken or what was printed amen but we don't want a manade substitute now someone's going to say oh brother McGary don't believe in the Bible he don't believe in the books he don't believe in the tape's right amen I just played the tape I read the Bible and I I showed you the book amen I I don't I don't care I preached a sermon one day and someone come up to me after service says man I see you don't believe in Preachers either really thank you that's like saying oh you're the biggest hypocrite I've ever met no what what I'm trying to say is you've got the battles in your mind amen you got to battle the process of taking the intellect here taking the intellect here or listening to what that you want to hear and bring yourself under the leadership of the spirit that the spirit can Quicken this to you can Quicken this to you can Quicken what you he to you he can supply the leadership in what you're hearing Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God but it takes the spirit life of the word to Quicken the seed and that's what we've got to see that that this final maturity that we're coming to is a body of Believers not resting on the intellect and what he said this he said that but what he said now comes to manifestation In the Flesh and now it becomes a light cuz he said there shall be light in the evening time the path to Glory you shall surely find and so it it begins our approach begins to change when we read this we read it it ought to press us to him amen am what do you mean Lord reveal this to me speak to me Lead Me Not oh I've got it I understand that now it's going to become a buzzword the church is almost run by buzzwords every preacher's got these little buzzwords they say and just the people just makes the people jump and jerk and and everything they got quotes they just quote them out but it it doesn't go outside the walls these disciples the the only way that they could back up what they were saying was with their life they couldn't say well see it says here no they were what written Epistles read of all men now when you go back and read the Bible you can understand these men that were writing these letters were writing these letters to people that didn't have a Bible they didn't have a book they didn't have a tape they were talking from life experience they knew that what they possessed what it produced amen so they were without a Bible they were without a a book they were without a tape but they were possessors of eternal life and nobody understood what was leading them except if they were led by the same thing and then that was the body and the fellowship men and women led by the spirit of God the prophet of God preached leadership it was one of the last messages he preached telling the church can't go off the Creeds you can't go after do all he had was the Bible but I believe he knew the books would come after and the tapes were come and I'm glad for every one of them I love them I Feast on them but unless the person of Jesus Christ quickens this message to you in the truth of the Revelation that it was spoken in it'll produce exactly what we've got amen all kinds of just fellowships all kinds of different groups all kinds of different leaders nobody has an absolute it's up to us individually to make make sure that we have the person of Jesus Christ amen leading us in our life you say I'm not sure whether I do or not ask and you shall receive get down on your knees somewhere get in your closet somewhere pray through you can't think it into existence it's a genuine experience that you know that you passed from Death onto life you know in that day that he is in the father and the father is him and that you're in him and he's in you you know it because you got down until you possessed it and every one of those early church church members when they met somebody they took what he said they knelt down they expressed everything the people saw the change in their life and they stayed there and they prayed through until that same Spirit affected him you know what we do nowadays you want to get born again read this listen to this I believe in listening but you got to get the life of what you're hearing you understand you know I'm for tapes you know I'm for books but the prophet of God was talking about what the first church had and we talked about that last time we ministered how the church drifted from that leadership and then that was God 's complaint they left their first love their first love was him leading them and they substituted it and that's the complaint now this church has to come back to the complaint meet the complaint and come back under the leadership of the Holy Spirit the leadership of the word of God the leadership of their Savior and that leadership amen and I I my own confession is there's a lot of choices I make there's a lot of reactions that I have that I knows not him and I realize that as much as I know this message and this word I've got to bring myself under subjection to the person of Jesus Christ and him alone and that's a challenge because the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh I hope you understand what I'm trying to say this morning God bless you let's [Applause] stand the musicians can come God bless you this in your own heart this morning you can ask yourself if you feel you have that leadership in your life not what you believe I know you believe the word and I know you believe it's the truth and I know you believe the message and you believe the Vindication of it that's not the question this morning the question is do you possess the leadership of the spirit the Lord may have even changed your nature and you know you're different than you were before but you just took that different person and just went about your life living your life as a good person that so sounds like that young man that the prophet of God preached about living right doing right believing right not a mark against them but he didn't have that leadership he didn't have that submission to the will of God and we'd ask you this morning if you don't feel that you have that leadership in your life I'm not saying you're a sinner I'm not saying you don't believe the [Music] message but you've come to that place in your life where God's LED you to that choice where you've got to choose that leadership amen and maybe you've been denying that choice because you're afraid that it might lead you to something that or take you away from something you've always wanted I know what that's like but you want to say in your heart Lord I want your will I want to do what you want me to do I want to be what you want me to be I I I'm I just don't want to go on believing and never being led I want to come back and place myself before you this morning and consecrate yourself and say Lord I I come back to you this morning I want to be led by your spirit Lord even as a pastor of a church some of the loveliest greatest people in the world Lord I still need your leadership I can't go on the [Music] past I've got to be led each day if you'd like to lift your hand and say Lord I I'm here this morning and I I as a believer I'm standing here my life is right my life is clean I've obeyed every commandment I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you've changed my life but I just don't really feel I'm being led am and you want to lift your hands up and say Lord lead me this morning I want to come back to that faith of the early church where my fathers didn't have a book they didn't have a Bible they didn't have a tape but they were led by the spirit of God and the scripture says as many as are led by the spirit of God are the sons and daughters of God lord and that's my heart's desire this morning Lord I'm sorry that I haven't listened I'm sorry I haven't sought your face Lord the only time I come is when I'm in need and I'm sick and then I come crying to you but Lord I want to stand this morning and say Lord what would you have me to do what can I do for you lord lord I I want your spirit to move on me now Lord I want to [Music] come and submit myself to your spirit this [Music] morning and have you lead me and guide me in my life we ask that you would grant that this morning in jesus' name we pray amen and amen there's any sick or any needy we be happy
