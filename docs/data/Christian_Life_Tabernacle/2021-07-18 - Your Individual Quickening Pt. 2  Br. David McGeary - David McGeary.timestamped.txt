[16:16] certainly
[16:16] uh happy to have you all our visitors
[16:18] with us amen as you invite brother mike
[16:21] for so i'm reading this morning god
[16:22] bless you
[16:39] morning
[16:42] i don't know about you but every once in
[16:44] a while there's a
[16:46] maybe a portion of scripture or a
[16:48] chapter that
[16:50] as you read through it every single
[16:52] verse just
[16:53] just as a nugget that you could just
[16:55] spend a long
[16:57] period of time on and you know that's
[16:59] sort of the experience i had as i was
[17:01] reading psalm 138 we'll turn to that
[17:05] this morning
[17:08] you know in the lots of things stuck out
[17:11] on this one but
[17:12] you know i couldn't get past the first
[17:13] verse
[17:15] and uh you know it says in verse 1
[17:18] i will praise thee with my whole heart
[17:22] before the gods will i sing praise unto
[17:25] thee
[17:26] you know and it struck me what an
[17:28] unusual statement that was
[17:32] before the gods will i sing praise unto
[17:35] thee
[17:37] it seems like a strange thing for
[17:39] someone like david
[17:40] who is a man after god's own heart to
[17:43] say
[17:45] you know i i guess david was many things
[17:50] but he was not an idolater so when he
[17:54] talks about before the gods well i
[17:57] praise thee
[17:58] you know there were no other gods in his
[18:01] mind so it seems strange
[18:03] that this is a statement he would make
[18:05] as he's beginning to praise
[18:07] the lord you know there's example after
[18:11] example in the old testament about how
[18:12] david stood in stark
[18:14] contrast to all the other kings in this
[18:17] respect
[18:18] the fact that there were no other gods
[18:20] whereas the others
[18:22] tolerated accommodated
[18:26] worshiped other objects of worship and
[18:28] yet david
[18:29] always maintained that standard and yet
[18:31] it says before the gods
[18:34] will i sing praise unto thee
[18:37] an example of this is in first kings 14
[18:39] and verse 7 this is a time when
[18:41] jeroboam one of the kings was seeking
[18:43] the council of the prophet
[18:45] that our hija and the word of the lord
[18:47] comes to him it says go
[18:48] tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of
[18:52] israel
[18:53] for as much as i exalted thee from among
[18:55] the people and made the prince over my
[18:57] people israel
[18:59] and rent the kingdom away from the house
[19:00] of david and gave it thee
[19:03] and yet thou has not been as my servant
[19:05] david who kept my commandments and who
[19:07] followed me with all his heart to do
[19:10] that only which was right in mine eyes
[19:14] but has done evil above all that were
[19:16] before thee
[19:17] for thou hast gone and made the other
[19:20] gods
[19:21] and molten images and provoked me
[19:24] to anger and hast me behind thy back
[19:28] and look at the contrast between the two
[19:30] and yet here's david before
[19:32] before the gods will i sing praise
[19:36] unto thee you know what's interesting is
[19:39] that hebrew phrase which
[19:40] david uses there before the gods means
[19:43] in full display
[19:45] in the face of something so in other
[19:49] words
[19:50] as all the other objects of worship were
[19:53] raised up around him
[19:55] instead of allowing a single part of him
[19:59] to make accommodation for it his
[20:02] response
[20:03] was is that he uttered a song of praise
[20:06] into the lord
[20:08] and so i got to looking at that a little
[20:10] bit but he put something on display
[20:14] in response to all these other objects
[20:16] of worship
[20:18] that were around the land in the day
[20:20] that he was in
[20:23] you know rather than just ignore them
[20:26] resist them
[20:27] not give place to them his response was
[20:30] to make something visible
[20:33] before the gods will i sing praise
[20:37] unto the lord you know what's
[20:40] interesting is the
[20:41] first few times that praise is mentioned
[20:44] in scripture
[20:46] it has it is mentioned in relation to
[20:48] producing life
[20:50] or bearing fruit in fact
[20:53] the very first time that the word praise
[20:56] is used
[20:57] in scripture is when leah names her son
[21:00] judah which means praise
[21:04] upon his birth you know leah was
[21:07] desperate for
[21:08] something to be born in her
[21:12] that would be something the father
[21:14] israel could identify
[21:16] with and then judah was born and there
[21:19] was praise unto the lord
[21:21] you know in leviticus the next time that
[21:23] praise is mentioned it's in regard to
[21:26] the fruit of the field that this will be
[21:29] a praise
[21:30] unto the lord you know when that
[21:33] scripture says before the gods will i
[21:36] sing praise there's a visible
[21:38] manifestation
[21:40] a visible demonstration of a song of
[21:42] praise
[21:44] unto the lord the funny thing about
[21:47] praise
[21:47] is it doesn't necessarily involve music
[21:51] kind of as we talked about a couple
[21:52] weeks ago you could sing every worship
[21:55] song in the book
[21:56] and it not be praise unto the lord and
[22:00] you could still have a life
[22:01] full of objects of worship
[22:05] and yet you can sing praise unto the
[22:08] lord without there ever being a single
[22:10] musical no but you know when there comes
[22:13] forth an utterance or a reflection
[22:16] out of your life in response to a work
[22:19] that god has done
[22:21] and he gets glorified for the work then
[22:23] there's praise being sung
[22:25] unto the lord and this was david's
[22:28] response
[22:29] when surrounded with all the objects of
[22:31] worship all the things that would demand
[22:33] his time
[22:34] and his affection and his efforts
[22:37] his response was to continuously have
[22:40] something
[22:41] presenting in his life that was giving
[22:44] praise
[22:45] to the lord this is a step beyond not
[22:47] get not
[22:48] allowing the enemy to have a place in
[22:50] our lives but this is an opportunity
[22:53] to visibly demonstrate something else
[22:56] in response to the call to worship
[22:59] and as david describes before the gods
[23:02] will i
[23:03] sing praise unto thee you know and
[23:06] here's the best part you know i just
[23:08] thought as the scripture even just as
[23:09] i'm saying that the scripture comes to
[23:11] mind when the enemy comes in
[23:13] like a flood the lord raises up a
[23:15] standard
[23:16] against that well what's a standard it's
[23:18] a flag it's something visible it's got
[23:20] an identification on it
[23:22] especially in battle especially in times
[23:24] of war so that people can see
[23:26] that identification and know what you're
[23:29] presenting
[23:31] but you know the best part is if you go
[23:32] to the end of psalm 138 and verse 8
[23:37] this is not our work it's his work
[23:40] it says the lord will perfect
[23:43] that which concerneth me
[23:47] you know in just every single verse how
[23:49] david is describing
[23:51] his response to the work of the lord and
[23:54] his response to all the calls the
[23:56] worship
[23:57] from the objects of worship that
[23:58] surrounded him in that day
[24:02] you know how many are uh grateful for
[24:05] the opportunity
[24:06] that he's given us to present a praise
[24:09] unto him by the work that's done in our
[24:11] lives as
[24:13] his response to all the calls to worship
[24:16] that exist in the land today
[24:18] so i never got past verse one you know
[24:20] and as i looked at that
[24:22] i was so grateful that for whom he did
[24:24] for know
[24:26] you know he did predestinate to be
[24:28] conformed into an image
[24:30] of his dear son so that was a blessing
[24:33] it was to me
[24:34] i never got past that so if you see
[24:36] something else in the chapter you know i
[24:38] hope it's a blessing to you
[24:40] but let's read psalm 138 this morning
[24:42] it's just a short one
[24:44] starting in verse 1. i will praise thee
[24:47] with my whole heart
[24:48] before the gods will i sing praise unto
[24:51] thee
[24:52] i will worship toward thy holy temple
[24:54] and praise thy name for thy loving
[24:57] kindness and for thy truth
[24:59] for thou hast magnified thy word above
[25:02] all thy name
[25:03] in the day when i cried thou answered me
[25:06] and strengthens me with strength in my
[25:09] soul
[25:10] all the kings of the earth shall praise
[25:12] thee o lord
[25:13] when they hear the words of thy mouth
[25:16] yea
[25:16] they shall sing in the ways of the lord
[25:19] for grace is the glory of the lord
[25:21] though the lord be high yet he hath
[25:24] respect unto the lowly
[25:26] but the proud he knoweth afar off though
[25:29] i
[25:29] walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt
[25:32] revive me
[25:33] thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[25:35] against the wrath of mine enemies
[25:37] and thy right hand shall save me the
[25:40] lord will perfect
[25:41] that which concerneth me thy mercy o
[25:44] lord endureth forever
[25:46] forsake not the works of thine own hands
[25:50] amen
[25:54] amen god bless you and i have yours
[26:10] with thanksgiving in my heart oh
[26:13] i will enter his coat with free
[26:18] will and i will sing this is the day
[26:22] that the lord

[48:33] invisible
[48:34] things of god are clearly revealed in

[49:02] trust that our lives are in the
[49:06] palm of your hand and that you said that
[49:09] nothing will
[49:11] pluck us from them
[49:14] and there are nail scarred hands lord
[49:17] that
[49:18] purchased what you hold
[49:21] and you mold it lord and you deal with
[49:24] it and you
[49:25] shape it into
[49:29] your very image
[49:34] father that thrills my heart
[49:38] to think that you're preparing us and
[49:42] molding us informing us father in a way
[49:45] that we can enjoy the great kingdom
[49:50] and the great eden that lies before us
[49:54] your wisdom is beyond all that we could
[49:56] think or understand
[49:58] lord i see you bless us this morning
[50:02] father
[50:03] with your word that you deal with hearts
[50:06] and
[50:08] we live in such a great hour of the
[50:10] mental battle
[50:12] so many voices and
[50:16] so many people trying to get us to the
[50:20] side
[50:21] one way or the other the lord we've
[50:24] purposed in our heart to take
[50:26] sides with jesus to live life
[50:29] with what he had in his thoughts
[50:34] to follow the actions that he
[50:38] demonstrated
[50:40] and to be like him we ask you to help us
[50:43] to that goal
[50:45] and that purpose this morning in your
[50:48] precious and
[50:49] wonderful name we pray amen
[50:52] amen god bless you this morning if you
[50:54] have your bibles this morning
[50:57] let's turn over to the scripture that
[51:00] we've been
[51:02] reading um
[51:08] quite often uh here in
[51:13] the romans the eighth chapter
[51:18] and 11th verse
[51:22] as we're going to continue this morning
[51:25] and trust the lord will be your portion
[51:28] this morning
[51:30] this this scripture i guess we've read
[51:33] it every sunday for the last
[51:35] three or four sundays and it's still an
[51:38] astounding scripture
[51:40] it says but if the spirit of him
[51:44] that raised up jesus from the dead
[51:48] dwell in you he that
[51:51] raised up christ from the dead
[51:56] shall also quicken your
[51:59] mortal bodies by
[52:02] his spirit that dwelleth
[52:05] in you our gracious father we ask
[52:08] that you bless us this morning in your
[52:11] precious name we pray
[52:13] amen god bless you this morning
[52:16] we've been
[52:20] fellowshipping around
[52:25] this great subject of
[52:28] the quickening power and
[52:32] you know a lot of times that
[52:36] word power we
[52:40] look at it and we per we
[52:43] apply it in maybe the way of
[52:47] force or or over
[52:51] coming or dominating but this
[52:55] this power is a power that
[52:58] is so far-reaching that
[53:01] it covers every circumstance
[53:05] of life and we're going to listen
[53:08] to this morning
[53:12] to the rest of the easter seal
[53:16] and it's 45 minutes long and i
[53:19] i looked at it and i listened to it two
[53:23] times and
[53:25] i just couldn't find a place that i
[53:27] could break it off
[53:29] with because it this
[53:33] portion of the tape is
[53:36] so personal
[53:39] brother graham's talking about his life
[53:41] he's talking about his hopes
[53:43] he's talking about what this quickening
[53:47] power
[53:49] did for others and
[53:53] what it's done for him
[53:56] and also letting us know
[53:59] how that it changed
[54:02] his viewpoint and how it can change our
[54:05] viewpoint
[54:07] on the way we view the future
[54:10] the way we view death the way we view
[54:13] circumstances
[54:15] this gift
[54:18] that god gives us of his spirit
[54:21] the same spirit that raised up jesus
[54:24] christ
[54:25] from the dead the very spirit that
[54:29] gave him the power to overcome
[54:33] and to live a victorious life
[54:37] and to work his way through all the
[54:40] circumstances
[54:42] all the traps all the hatred
[54:45] all the words that were spoken of him
[54:49] criticized being called the else above
[54:54] all the stories that were told about him
[54:57] he had something that kept him
[55:01] and he's talking to us this morning
[55:04] that life has
[55:08] dealt us all uh very many difficulties
[55:13] i believe that we have an enemy and
[55:17] and he wants to be in total control
[55:22] the word of god says that he exalted
[55:24] himself above the angels to make the
[55:26] earth
[55:27] his throne and he wanted to have
[55:30] dominion
[55:31] over the stars and we know those are the
[55:33] stars or the messengers to the ages
[55:36] so we have this great uh
[55:40] force that is trying to build his own
[55:43] kingdom
[55:45] his own eden so we have someone of great
[55:49] power and and we don't fight
[55:52] against carnal things that we can hold
[55:55] by hands
[55:56] but we fight principalities and powers
[56:00] in high places and these great
[56:03] principalities empower his trying to
[56:06] make a world that he gets worshipped in
[56:10] and that's what he did he wanted to make
[56:12] himself
[56:13] the object of worship and
[56:16] even from the very our birth we're
[56:20] disadvantaged
[56:21] you say at your disadvantage yes you are
[56:24] born in sin
[56:26] shake and iniquity and you come into the
[56:29] world
[56:30] speaking lies you lie
[56:33] when there's no reason in the world to
[56:36] lie
[56:39] you don't even know why you lie the
[56:42] first time
[56:43] your mother said little johnny did you
[56:45] eat any cookies
[56:46] and there's crumbs on your thing and you
[56:49] got a cookie in your hand
[56:51] and you say no
[56:55] you know it's the very nature
[56:59] you possess
[57:03] you're born defeated so
[57:06] you could never accomplish the kingdom
[57:09] of god
[57:11] and i and i think when you realize that
[57:14] it in our own lives
[57:16] it ought to have us extend
[57:19] a lot of mercy and grace to those
[57:23] in life around us you know
[57:26] it it's easy to point thinkers but
[57:30] and it's easy to be discouraged but
[57:33] uh we we're totally helpless
[57:37] and we you know men make great efforts
[57:40] to overcome things but without the grace
[57:43] of god
[57:44] you just can't that's right uh you just
[57:47] can't win
[57:49] so god gave us this gift of his
[57:52] quickening power
[57:54] he even told his disciples go into this
[57:57] room
[57:58] up here and wait until
[58:01] you are endured with power from on high
[58:05] i will not leave you comfortless in
[58:08] other words i'm not going to leave you
[58:09] alone
[58:10] on this journey i i
[58:13] will come and i'll be with you even in
[58:16] you
[58:17] till the end i will lead you into all
[58:20] truth
[58:21] and righteousness and this is this
[58:25] power that he's talking about
[58:28] this easter that when the lord
[58:31] resurrected
[58:33] he sent this spirit back onto his
[58:36] church in measure in other words
[58:40] in accordance that he'll give you
[58:44] whatever portion of that spirit
[58:48] that you need to make it
[58:52] amen if you come into more difficult
[58:54] times or more difficult situations
[58:58] he will increase that portion of the
[59:00] spirit on you
[59:02] to overcome so he we're in the
[59:06] palm of his hands and he he's he's
[59:10] here and he's telling us that
[59:13] that i i'm i'm sending you
[59:17] my spirit back onto the church
[59:21] and i know that we're not worthy of it
[59:26] we're only worthy of it because he paid
[59:28] the price for us
[59:30] it's his gift and we
[59:33] we talked as we went down through it
[59:35] that
[59:36] when a man the spirit of god goes out
[59:39] and it convicts a man you don't even
[59:42] come into conviction by yourself
[59:45] the spirit of god by the word of god
[59:48] convicted you
[59:49] you heard the word and you knew it
[59:52] applied to you and you knew you were
[59:53] doing wrong
[59:54] and there's something in your heart that
[59:56] says this isn't right
[59:58] a very conscious of man
[1:00:01] knows and he comes down he knows that he
[1:00:04] needs god
[1:00:05] and he cries out and he he's sorry
[1:00:08] and then god sees that he's sorry so
[1:00:11] he sends his spirit to that person
[1:00:15] it's like a seal it's like a
[1:00:18] ticket yeah if i could express it that
[1:00:21] way it's something that goes out
[1:00:23] and lets you know that okay
[1:00:26] i forgiven everything that you've done
[1:00:30] everything that's laid to your charge my
[1:00:33] blood has
[1:00:34] totally washed it away i'll give you a
[1:00:37] token of that i'll give you
[1:00:39] something that identifies to you that
[1:00:42] your whole slate has been
[1:00:46] wiped clean connect his spirit
[1:00:51] and i think where the church has failed
[1:00:53] so much as we've
[1:00:54] taken that great spirit and we've turned
[1:00:57] it into religion
[1:00:59] we've we've turned it into uh rituals
[1:01:03] and practices
[1:01:04] and teachings but that spirit is a
[1:01:07] person himself
[1:01:09] it's like a friend it's like a buddy
[1:01:11] it's like
[1:01:12] someone collect that that is that never
[1:01:15] leaves you or
[1:01:16] nor forsakes you he says i didn't call
[1:01:18] you i call you
[1:01:20] friends and and so he's befriended us
[1:01:24] and he's here to help us all the way
[1:01:26] through
[1:01:27] and so if this this great quickening
[1:01:30] spirit
[1:01:31] is not just something that comes at one
[1:01:34] time
[1:01:35] in your life but it's an ongoing
[1:01:38] relationship
[1:01:39] of god pouring his grace and his mercy
[1:01:43] and his forgiveness and intervening in
[1:01:47] your life
[1:01:48] and doing things for you and making the
[1:01:51] way
[1:01:52] for you and opening up the path for you
[1:01:55] so that you will get to the end
[1:01:58] of this journey and back to where
[1:02:01] that you came from and uh
[1:02:04] so that that is uh just such a
[1:02:09] a a wonderful thing to understand
[1:02:12] so this morning the last part of this
[1:02:16] tape
[1:02:17] is in kind of an altar call it's called
[1:02:21] worshiping an
[1:02:22] altar call and and when we come to that
[1:02:25] part i think when we're done with this
[1:02:27] 45 minutes
[1:02:29] i'll just have billy come up and lead us
[1:02:31] in some singing
[1:02:33] and i'm not going to add anything to it
[1:02:36] and we will just go at the end
[1:02:39] of this uh at the end of worship
[1:02:42] but through this time if if you
[1:02:46] don't have this quickening power
[1:02:50] in other words you don't have god
[1:02:52] working in your life
[1:02:54] overcoming for you and helping you
[1:02:58] you understand it's not you against god
[1:03:02] it's god for you it's god for you the
[1:03:06] only one that's against you is the enemy
[1:03:09] that's the only one that doesn't want
[1:03:11] you to get this power
[1:03:13] he doesn't want god in your life
[1:03:17] helping you and guiding you and talking
[1:03:20] to you
[1:03:20] and and and instructing you and
[1:03:23] convicting you
[1:03:25] he doesn't want the hand of god in your
[1:03:27] life because
[1:03:28] if the hand of god's in your life his
[1:03:30] life his power is not in your life
[1:03:34] and so he he he's just here
[1:03:37] pouring out his heart and pouring out
[1:03:40] his spirit
[1:03:41] because all that the father hath given
[1:03:44] me will come
[1:03:45] he wants to take his children
[1:03:49] back to the kingdom that they belong in
[1:03:52] and he's got to give them something that
[1:03:55] they can
[1:03:56] overcome by because they have no
[1:03:59] overcoming ability in themselves
[1:04:02] not in their mind not in their flesh
[1:04:05] not in their willpower because there's
[1:04:08] nothing
[1:04:09] okay look if satan's got you at whether
[1:04:12] he's got you in a mental state whether
[1:04:14] he's got you in a physical
[1:04:16] addiction a medical addiction i don't
[1:04:18] care what it is
[1:04:19] you are helpless you need some outside
[1:04:23] power to come in and deliver you to do
[1:04:27] something for you i i don't care you
[1:04:30] know your relationship could be in a
[1:04:32] wreck
[1:04:34] it doesn't matter what the circumstances
[1:04:37] are
[1:04:37] we cannot make it on our own we can't
[1:04:41] do it we don't have it in us to do it
[1:04:45] you're a liar
[1:04:49] you you know what i mean you were you
[1:04:51] that you're the what
[1:04:53] very formed you was iniquity
[1:04:57] unbelief and and and and so
[1:05:00] we're so we're born in such a defeated
[1:05:03] state
[1:05:03] but he's not going to leave you he loves
[1:05:06] you so much
[1:05:07] he's not going to leave you in that
[1:05:09] state
[1:05:10] and so when when as you listen to this
[1:05:14] he's going to tell us
[1:05:15] what it did for other people
[1:05:18] what this power did in other people's
[1:05:20] lives
[1:05:22] the effect it had on them so that you
[1:05:24] know if it did it for them it'll do it
[1:05:26] for you
[1:05:27] because we already went through that if
[1:05:29] it acted one way this way it'll always
[1:05:31] do the same thing
[1:05:33] so if it overcame one for one person and
[1:05:37] over
[1:05:37] if it cast out demons before it can cast
[1:05:40] out demons today
[1:05:44] it got rid of tormenting spirits it can
[1:05:47] get rid of tormenting spirits today
[1:05:50] if if you're you're you're warring in
[1:05:53] your spirit and in your mind
[1:05:55] the disciples did it all the time jesus
[1:05:58] said why do you murmur amongst yourself
[1:06:00] why do you think why do you go through
[1:06:02] all this stuff and then he would go
[1:06:04] heal them and and help them so he's here
[1:06:07] this morning
[1:06:10] for anybody that will
[1:06:13] sit back and and ask
[1:06:17] because he wants you to ask for it
[1:06:21] he wants you to say i want that
[1:06:24] that's what i want he wants you to look
[1:06:27] at what the world has given you
[1:06:29] the wages of sin is death and sit there
[1:06:32] and say no i don't want this i want this
[1:06:35] i want you i want peace that's her path
[1:06:37] to understanding
[1:06:39] i want joy unspeakable i want the love
[1:06:42] of god
[1:06:43] shed abroad in my heart i don't want to
[1:06:45] be bitter
[1:06:46] i don't want to be angry i don't want to
[1:06:49] live in contention
[1:06:51] i need healing in my life i i'm not
[1:06:54] happy and content
[1:06:58] in my present condition and that's what
[1:07:01] he's there for he said i've got
[1:07:02] something for that it's my spirit
[1:07:06] and i will give you my spirit
[1:07:10] and as you grow that spirit grows with
[1:07:13] you
[1:07:14] that power grows with you it it leads
[1:07:17] you and guides you
[1:07:18] and then when you come to the place that
[1:07:21] you can be placed as a son
[1:07:23] so that he tutors you by that spirit and
[1:07:26] then that same spirit empowers you
[1:07:29] to do works to go beyond your own self
[1:07:32] to go into others it it's it's a
[1:07:36] wonderful thing that god has for us this
[1:07:38] morning
[1:07:39] this great seal and and so he knows
[1:07:43] you have need of it he knows you can't
[1:07:47] get it on your own
[1:07:49] he he knows that your nature
[1:07:54] he knows your nature born in sin shape
[1:07:56] nate come in the world speak english
[1:07:57] he knows all that about you so he knows
[1:08:00] you
[1:08:01] need an intervention from the outside
[1:08:06] and i know i can use more
[1:08:09] of that spirit
[1:08:14] as the challenges grow
[1:08:18] we need more of that spirit so as you
[1:08:21] listened this morning
[1:08:24] i i trust with all my heart
[1:08:27] and and i just wanted to read
[1:08:31] a statement to you that
[1:08:35] as we've read and understand that we're
[1:08:37] kind of in that great
[1:08:39] resurrection now but
[1:08:42] i just would trust that this would be
[1:08:45] the comfort that each of us could have
[1:08:50] but if that quickening power is there
[1:08:56] you'll recognize like that little eagle
[1:09:00] that's his mama that's the word
[1:09:04] that's thus saith the lord that's what
[1:09:07] god
[1:09:08] promised that what was foretold
[1:09:12] that's exactly what happened
[1:09:15] we're beyond any shadow of a doubt
[1:09:19] potentially in the resurrection
[1:09:22] right now the saints getting ready
[1:09:26] to be taken up in the air
[1:09:30] that's where we are and we can't do it
[1:09:33] without this spirit
[1:09:35] so just so jesus was so
[1:09:38] full of this quickening power said
[1:09:41] if you can destroy this temple
[1:09:45] that took you 40 years
[1:09:49] you thought to build i'll raise it up in
[1:09:52] three days
[1:09:54] why why could jesus say that
[1:09:58] i want to ask you why could jesus say
[1:10:02] a thing like that he knew
[1:10:05] that he was amen i wish
[1:10:09] i could make that stick
[1:10:12] he knew who he was he knew
[1:10:15] that every word god had wrote
[1:10:18] in there of him he had fulfilled it
[1:10:23] he knew he was the one david
[1:10:26] spoke of that's right do you know
[1:10:29] you're the ones the bible speaks up
[1:10:33] do you know your position is
[1:10:37] in christ amen do you know
[1:10:40] your position is in christ

[1:15:30] quicken to see the past the curtains
[1:15:34] how these people were quickened back
[1:15:36] there to look past the curtain and see
[1:15:38] down in this time
[1:15:39] those prophets look at paul said in the
[1:15:41] last days how these people be acting
[1:15:43] call themselves christians
[1:15:45] he was a prophet full of the quickening
[1:15:47] power force sword come to pass
[1:15:48] we believe that don't we he received
[1:15:51] quickening power
[1:15:52] look at the quickening power today for
[1:15:54] telling things without
[1:15:55] one event missing not one time does it
[1:15:59] fail
[1:16:00] quickening power not the power of a man
[1:16:02] the power of god
[1:16:04] the power the abstract of easter the
[1:16:07] resurrected jesus has sent back the
[1:16:09] abstract
[1:16:10] to guarantee us that we're already
[1:16:11] quickened with him notice
[1:16:13] you remember the little book businessman
[1:16:15] you're looking to pass the curtain of
[1:16:17] time

[1:16:31] then that quickening power comes i'm
[1:16:33] rested up and i looked up there and i
[1:16:35] said look at yonder
[1:16:36] i remember that morning being caught up
[1:16:37] as my wife sitting back there
[1:16:39] laying on the same bed with me that
[1:16:41] morning and i was raised up and looked
[1:16:42] up in there she was asleep
[1:16:44] i said if i'm going to do anything to
[1:16:45] the lord you better hurry up or you're
[1:16:47] past 50.
[1:16:48] and then the holy spirit caught me away
[1:16:50] and i looked over there
[1:16:52] i seen those saints just as certain i'm
[1:16:55] standing here by this desperate
[1:16:56] sacred book laying here and a minister
[1:16:58] of the gospel have i
[1:16:59] ever told you anything in the name of
[1:17:01] the lord but what happened
[1:17:03] video don't you tell me about it every
[1:17:05] time has it been perfectly at the
[1:17:07] platform every time has it happened just
[1:17:09] like he said
[1:17:10] this was thus saith the lord
[1:17:13] i stood there and looked over that time
[1:17:15] and i've seen tens of thousands times
[1:17:16] thousands coming
[1:17:18] young men and women run throwing their
[1:17:19] arms around me screaming i look right
[1:17:21] back and see myself laying on the bed
[1:17:23] oh lord let me look at past the curtain
[1:17:26] of time
[1:17:26] what is it it's quitting power that'll
[1:17:29] catch us away
[1:17:31] that great quickening power the
[1:17:33] quickening power coming this last days
[1:17:34] that's what i'm in arizona for right now
[1:17:37] there's many people sitting right here
[1:17:38] stood right here at phoenix you heard me
[1:17:39] tell you from this very platform
[1:17:41] thus saith the lord how many remember
[1:17:45] said
[1:17:45] oh of course something's fixed that
[1:17:46] happened i saw seven angels come
[1:17:48] didn't life magazine packet is the fog
[1:17:51] of it floated across here 27 miles high
[1:17:53] and 30 miles across
[1:17:55] it's not fred sophman these other gene
[1:17:57] normally sitting back there
[1:17:58] stood right there when them seven angels
[1:18:00] appeared right there on the hill and
[1:18:01] shook the hills for miles around like
[1:18:04] that there stood seven angels and thrown
[1:18:06] a sword in hand said go home and open
[1:18:08] these seven seals they were given
[1:18:10] and here they are the true mystery of
[1:18:13] marriage and divorce and the serpent's
[1:18:15] seed and all these things
[1:18:16] has been fussed about it's the santa
[1:18:19] lord
[1:18:20] what is it the acquaintance power coming
[1:18:22] to the church
[1:18:23] making her already this hour that we're
[1:18:25] approaching
[1:18:27] quickening power oh god help us to
[1:18:30] receive it
[1:18:31] help us to believe it see just depends
[1:18:33] on what attitude you take to it what's
[1:18:35] going to do you any good or not at all
[1:18:36] so you have to believe that if you don't
[1:18:38] believe it it won't do you
[1:18:40] one bit of good how samuel stood there
[1:18:41] before that people said
[1:18:43] have i ever told you anything in the
[1:18:44] name of the lord but what happened did i
[1:18:46] ever beg you for your money to live on
[1:18:48] no but we want the king anyhow that's
[1:18:50] the way the church is today
[1:18:51] they want their own ideas they won't pay
[1:18:53] a bit of attention to either walk right
[1:18:55] around
[1:18:55] well it just goes to show the quickening
[1:18:57] power is not there always say well i
[1:18:59] spoke in tongues i jumped and i shouted
[1:19:01] that's all fine
[1:19:02] but that quickening power is there
[1:19:03] you'll recognize like that little eagle
[1:19:05] that's his mama that's the word that's
[1:19:07] thus saith the lord that's what god
[1:19:08] promised
[1:19:09] that's what was foretold that's exactly
[1:19:11] what happened we're beyond any shadow of
[1:19:13] doubt potentially in the resurrection
[1:19:15] right now
[1:19:16] the saints getting ready to be taken up
[1:19:18] in the air
[1:19:19] so jesus so full of this quickly power
[1:19:22] said if you can destroy this temple it
[1:19:24] took you 40 years you thought to build
[1:19:26] i'll raise it up in three days
[1:19:29] why why could jesus say that onto ashton
[1:19:32] why could jesus say a thing like that
[1:19:34] he knew that he was
[1:19:38] amen i wish i could make that
[1:19:41] stick
[1:19:45] he knew who he was he knew that every
[1:19:49] word god had wrote
[1:19:50] in there of him he had fulfilled it he
[1:19:53] knew he was one david spoke of do you
[1:19:56] know you're the one the bible speaks on
[1:19:58] yes do you know your position is in
[1:20:00] christ if you're in christ you're a new
[1:20:02] creature
[1:20:03] do you know this word is just like every
[1:20:05] day living to you
[1:20:07] well sure it's yours you are an eagle
[1:20:10] that's your food
[1:20:12] he knew that by the power of god he
[1:20:15] would do it because it was prophesied he
[1:20:18] would do it
[1:20:19] that's the reason he wasn't scared to
[1:20:21] say destroy this temple
[1:20:23] i'll raise it up in three days because
[1:20:25] david said i'll not leave his soul in
[1:20:27] hell
[1:20:27] neither will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:20:29] corruption he know not one
[1:20:31] cell of his body would corrupt any crops
[1:20:33] in 72 hours
[1:20:35] he said destroy this temple i'll raise
[1:20:37] it up again
[1:20:38] amen in three days
[1:20:42] why he was so full of that quickening
[1:20:45] power
[1:20:46] that quickened every word he looked back
[1:20:48] and seen every word god wrote of him the
[1:20:50] prophet said it fulfilled it he know
[1:20:51] that would be fulfilled too
[1:20:53] now every word that god said has your
[1:20:56] spirit said amen to it has been
[1:20:57] fulfilled in your life
[1:20:59] as a believer do you hold back on
[1:21:01] something say well my church teaches
[1:21:03] different
[1:21:04] then be careful paul comes
[1:21:07] notice eagles believe there's no
[1:21:09] question to them
[1:21:10] they believe it notice now he knew it
[1:21:14] would happen because
[1:21:15] the word said it wasn't every word wrote
[1:21:18] of him had to be fulfilled
[1:21:20] he knew that it was written by the power
[1:21:23] of god by the holy prophets that had
[1:21:25] prophesied
[1:21:26] that he would do so and prophecy never
[1:21:29] fails it cannot the word of god can't
[1:21:33] fail
[1:21:34] and it is written in the by the spirit
[1:21:37] that is now also
[1:21:41] the spirit that raised up jesus from
[1:21:44] the dead if it dwells in your
[1:21:49] being your body it will also quicken
[1:21:52] your mortal body then shoot
[1:21:56] it burn it do anything you want to make
[1:21:58] fun of it tear it down
[1:22:00] turn it down do what you want to god
[1:22:03] will raise it up to where he said he
[1:22:04] would
[1:22:05] man every saint of god has that promise
[1:22:08] and he
[1:22:09] knows that that's the truth so fear not
[1:22:11] brother
[1:22:12] we're already in the easter look now
[1:22:15] at transfiguration just before we close
[1:22:18] transfigure
[1:22:18] transfiguration we are all represented
[1:22:21] there
[1:22:22] and transfiguration look what we are
[1:22:25] seeing today notice just what we're
[1:22:27] seeing today
[1:22:28] the quickening power of god was
[1:22:31] all there there was a dead saints
[1:22:33] represented in moses
[1:22:35] there was a resurrection and jesus
[1:22:37] christ
[1:22:38] glorified elijah moses elijah
[1:22:42] and jesus all standing on the mountain
[1:22:44] the dead saints
[1:22:46] raptured saints and jesus glorified
[1:22:50] oh my well you say i heard a guy say
[1:22:54] they say you people
[1:22:55] why if you had this kind of power you
[1:22:58] ought to go out and tell people what you
[1:22:59] can do
[1:23:01] far be it from a real christian saying a
[1:23:03] thing like that
[1:23:04] see surely we don't claim no power
[1:23:08] to but we do one thing
[1:23:11] when they looked around with all this
[1:23:12] power upon them they saw jesus
[1:23:14] only and the real true believer don't
[1:23:18] care whether he's
[1:23:19] backing up a denomination or nothing
[1:23:21] about it
[1:23:22] he only wants one thing for you to see
[1:23:24] that glorified christ
[1:23:26] makes any difference a real true mount
[1:23:28] transfiguration experience
[1:23:30] only glorifies jesus christ he did
[1:23:32] glorify moses and glorify elijah and
[1:23:34] glorify themselves and glorify nothing
[1:23:36] else
[1:23:37] but they seem to glorify christ and any
[1:23:39] true believer
[1:23:40] that's what's in his heart to glorify
[1:23:43] jesus christ
[1:23:44] that's what he's trying to get the
[1:23:45] people see not say well if you come join
[1:23:47] our groups if you come do this or do
[1:23:48] that
[1:23:49] oh don't do that don't do that see
[1:23:53] god's word which is christ magnified
[1:23:56] and fulfilled the promise of this day
[1:23:59] in this great hour of resurrection
[1:24:01] notice
[1:24:03] and it gives them joy to know that we
[1:24:06] are with him a flesh of his flesh
[1:24:10] and bone of his bones what a joy
[1:24:14] that's the only thing that a real
[1:24:15] believer cares about they don't care
[1:24:17] about a denomination they don't care
[1:24:18] about an organization you don't care
[1:24:19] about what the other women think
[1:24:22] they don't care certainly not they won't
[1:24:25] do these things that the these other
[1:24:26] women do
[1:24:27] these men won't do them things they
[1:24:28] won't hang and
[1:24:30] baby around with some organization keep
[1:24:32] being put out and afraid they
[1:24:34] won't have a meal ticket they don't care
[1:24:36] about them things there's nonsense to
[1:24:38] them
[1:24:38] there's only one heart's desire that is
[1:24:41] to see jesus christ glorify yes
[1:24:43] their conduct must be with god it must
[1:24:46] absolutely nothing else but just the
[1:24:48] glory of jesus christ
[1:24:49] and what is jesus the word is that right
[1:24:53] amen i notice and seeing his same
[1:24:57] vindicated
[1:24:58] method proving his resurrection now what
[1:25:01] is it
[1:25:02] seeing your life by his promised word
[1:25:07] that he said he's the same yesterday and
[1:25:08] forever
[1:25:09] proving that he's still alive i
[1:25:12] don't care if every door in the
[1:25:14] country's close to me
[1:25:16] that i'm as i said i was 56 of the day
[1:25:19] i could be snapped out i'm at the heart
[1:25:21] attack age i'm in all this other age
[1:25:23] everything else well what difference it
[1:25:26] didn't make any difference to me when i
[1:25:27] was a kid they don't make any difference
[1:25:28] now
[1:25:29] one hour my number is called in my car
[1:25:31] out of the rack
[1:25:33] i don't care if they ever know they ever
[1:25:34] lived on the earth it don't make me no
[1:25:36] difference
[1:25:36] you don't have to have no big monuments
[1:25:38] and big buildings to say that i was
[1:25:39] showing earth
[1:25:41] and then one thing i wanted let me all
[1:25:43] know that jesus christ
[1:25:44] is the same yesterday
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:48] and in my heart my holy abstract
[1:25:51] and i know that someday although i may
[1:25:54] be drowning in the sea i may be killed
[1:25:56] in africa
[1:25:57] i don't know what happened to me but one
[1:25:59] thing i know i hold the abstract
[1:26:02] hallelujah every door can be closed that
[1:26:05] don't make a big difference to me
[1:26:07] i'm not trying to glorify some man or
[1:26:09] some organization nor myself or another
[1:26:12] groups or nothing else
[1:26:13] i want people to see jesus christ is
[1:26:15] raised from the dead in his spirit lives
[1:26:19] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:21] forever no wonder jesus said
[1:26:23] fear not i am he that was dead
[1:26:26] but i'm alive forevermore
[1:26:30] for now we are redeemed by him
[1:26:34] and are risen with him and are

[1:42:09] an old man now but
[1:42:10] many many years ago it happened
[1:42:14] and i know that day when i walked into
[1:42:16] the hospital and i had my great
[1:42:18] challenge i've seen my wife die
[1:42:22] me calling for a life what have i done
[1:42:24] to stand on the street corner and preach
[1:42:26] and pray for the sick
[1:42:28] and then satan said well he won't answer
[1:42:30] your prayer

[1:42:34] that in her was that resurrection power
[1:42:38] that bone shall rise again i see my

[1:45:46] you don't have to take it from the cross
[1:45:47] just point your finger and watch what

[1:45:51] that
[1:45:52] i couldn't have this testimony today you
[1:45:54] could have had
[1:45:55] but because he stayed to the cross he

[1:47:08] my god my god
[1:47:12] why has thou forsaken me i thirst
[1:47:17] no wonder the prophet foresaw it set up
[1:47:20] all my bones they stare at me
[1:47:22] they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:47:25] but he was numbered with the
[1:47:26] transgressors but he was wounded for our
[1:47:29] transgressions
[1:47:30] he was bruised for our iniquity the
[1:47:33] chastisement of our peace is upon him
[1:47:35] and with his stripes
[1:47:38] we are healed we claim that this morning
[1:47:41] god

[1:47:45] resurrection notice this
[1:47:49] vindicated truth that i'm told
[1:47:52] lord from your word in the presence of
