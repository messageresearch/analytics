[17:13] so we open the Service in prayer how
[17:15] many have an expectation this morning
[17:18] I came with an expectation and I know
[17:20] that the Lord will certainly exceed and
[17:23] grant us above what we could even think
[17:25] or ask for amen
[17:27] [Music]
[17:35] let's pull our heads and pray
[17:41] [Music]
[17:42] a gracious loving kind Heavenly Father

[17:51] for us to be gathered here once again
[17:54] to come before thy great throne of grace

[18:25] created us to be Sons and Daughters of
[18:27] God

[18:31] approach you as your children
[18:33] as your beloved children Lord you've

[18:44] we love you with all of our heart and of
[18:46] all of our soul and we follow our

[18:54] towards us father that you have made us
[18:56] your children
[18:57] what a great honor it is for us so
[19:00] father to be able to come to worship you
[19:02] in spirit and in truth this morning
[19:06] we would ask this morning that Lord you
[19:08] would come in a very special way
[19:11] and anoint your servant or Pastor
[19:13] brother Tom we thank you Lord that
[19:16] you've brought us together to be
[19:18] gathered here in one body in one spirit
[19:20] and in one Accord to Worship the Great
[19:24] God Of Heaven this morning we would ask
[19:27] our father that your anointing would

[19:31] would meet every need in your divine
[19:33] presence father that none of your

[19:57] and all those who support this great
[19:59] ministry we ask that Lord you would
[20:01] continue to bless you would continue to
[20:03] reveal yourself in ways that we have not
[20:06] seen Lord oh Father take us into higher
[20:10] places this morning take us into Realms
[20:12] of faith and Revelation that that we
[20:15] have not experienced before father and
[20:17] will be sure to give you all the praise
[20:19] and the glory and if there is any need
[20:22] of God before you in a great
[20:24] congregation like this this morning we
[20:26] know there are needs Lord their
[20:28] spiritual needs their financial needs
[20:30] Lord their sicknesses and burdens that
[20:33] burden your people but this morning
[20:35] Father we are believing in the great
[20:38] hands of almighty God to meet every need
[20:40] in your divine presence father will
[20:43] release ourselves of faith and we humble
[20:46] ourselves and ask that Lord you would

[20:54] that Lord you would take brother Tom

[20:58] who has prepared o God the word of God
[21:01] to preach to your people let it not be

[21:11] we'll leave this house knowing that we
[21:13] have touched you I and you have come all
[21:16] father to meet every need to reveal
[21:18] yourself to each one of us we pray in a
[21:21] special way in Jesus name we ask these
[21:24] things amen and amen
[21:27] foreign
[21:29] amen praise the Lord before you're
[21:31] seated why don't you
[21:32] greet one another welcome
[21:34] each other into the house of the Lord as
[21:36] brother Mike comes
[21:37] why don't you tell each other we're
[21:39] going in the rapture
[21:41] amen praise the Lord
[21:44] amen you may be seated
[21:55] well good morning it's
[21:58] good to see all the
[22:00] any guests in the house this morning
[22:04] I'm glad you could come when we have
[22:06] when the weather is cooler
[22:09] it's um
[22:12] just wait till it's hot
[22:15] you know it's a we're going to read a
[22:18] Psalm here this morning in a minute
[22:20] you know I was thinking as I was going
[22:22] through the week
[22:23] I'm one of those guys that works for a
[22:25] big Corporation a big company and
[22:28] you know the company that I work for
[22:29] like any Corporation likes to completely
[22:32] redesign things every
[22:34] nine to 12 months
[22:37] you know because every good corporate
[22:39] leader knows that
[22:41] you know if you can keep things moving
[22:43] around it looks like you're making
[22:45] progress
[22:48] you may not actually be improving
[22:49] something
[22:51] but the important thing is is you look
[22:52] like you are
[22:55] you know we're going through another one
[22:56] of those organizations again at work and
[22:59] you know over time you start to
[23:01] recognize some of the familiar behaviors
[23:03] in people
[23:05] you know they start to look busy
[23:08] they start to look valuable and
[23:10] important
[23:12] you know all of the sudden the people
[23:14] that
[23:15] you could never find before they'd never
[23:18] take your call you just could never get
[23:20] anything out of them
[23:21] all of a sudden they're everywhere
[23:24] they won't leave you alone
[23:27] and it's frustrating because everyone
[23:29] knows
[23:31] that they aren't actually contributing
[23:33] to the business
[23:35] they're just really good at looking like
[23:37] they are
[23:41] occupying
[23:42] position
[23:44] without progressing the work
[23:49] you know because there are big changes
[23:51] going on
[23:52] and
[23:54] you don't want to find yourself without
[23:56] a position
[23:59] doesn't matter if you're actually
[24:00] productive for doing the work
[24:03] the important thing is you look like you
[24:05] are
[24:08] you know looking and sounding like
[24:12] what you think
[24:13] the leaders want to hear and see
[24:18] I got to thinking about that it occurred
[24:20] to me I wonder
[24:22] how many people respond to the move of
[24:24] the Lord that way
[24:26] where God will come and do a work
[24:29] or he'll be moving somewhere they begin
[24:32] to recognize that something important
[24:35] is taking place
[24:38] so they start doing all the things
[24:42] saying all the things
[24:45] making all the sounds acting all the
[24:47] ways
[24:49] that they believe
[24:51] someone who is Walking with the Lord
[24:54] should do
[24:57] laying claim to a position
[25:01] but not actually progressing the work
[25:06] that's what religion is
[25:08] brother Branham called it make-believers
[25:12] and they're everywhere
[25:15] whenever there's a real need
[25:18] or a testing time
[25:21] or an hour of proving
[25:24] or if there's a work that needs to be
[25:25] done that is difficult
[25:28] maybe not very glorious
[25:30] they're nowhere to be found
[25:33] but whenever there appears to be a great
[25:35] work somewhere
[25:38] they're everywhere
[25:41] worshiping just as loud as they can
[25:44] amending the loudest preachers in the
[25:46] land
[25:48] God seems to be speaking them at every
[25:50] turn
[25:54] but yet they're never actually
[25:55] progressing the work
[26:00] you know Paul said in Romans 12
[26:03] he said I beseech you therefore Brethren
[26:05] by the mercies of God
[26:07] that you present your bodies a Living
[26:09] Sacrifice
[26:11] but in verse 2
[26:14] he tells us why
[26:17] it says that ye may prove
[26:21] demonstrate
[26:23] make known
[26:25] what is that good and acceptable and
[26:28] perfect will of God
[26:31] you know this is moving beyond someone
[26:33] who claims
[26:36] to be following the will of God
[26:38] moves Beyond someone who is seeking the
[26:41] will of God
[26:42] to someone who is performing the will of
[26:45] God is doing the will of God
[26:50] we're going to read Psalm 20 this
[26:51] morning
[26:53] you know it's just a wonderful Psalm
[26:55] probably familiar to most of us it's
[26:57] you know for years I read this Psalm as
[27:00] a you know it's a Psalm of prayer it's a
[27:02] prayer of blessing it's a you know often
[27:04] you'll see it on the walls of Christian
[27:06] homes and you know I always just read
[27:09] that as you know may this be unto me or
[27:13] may this blessing be unto you
[27:16] but it occurred to me as I was reading
[27:18] this this is this is more than just a
[27:21] prayer blessing
[27:23] or a nice sounding religious
[27:27] may this blessing be upon you
[27:30] this is a Psalm of action
[27:34] this is more than claiming something is
[27:37] being done
[27:39] this is
[27:40] the job
[27:42] this is doing it
[27:46] this is the proof of one who's not only
[27:48] occupying the position but is
[27:50] progressing the work
[27:53] let's look at the evidence of one who is
[27:55] actually progressing the work verse one
[27:59] the Lord hears thee
[28:01] in the day of trouble
[28:04] you know if you have the King James
[28:06] version Bible you'll see a footnote
[28:08] there that says it this way answer thee
[28:11] in a day of trouble
[28:14] but the thing is is this isn't a
[28:16] question
[28:17] there's no prayer here there's no crying
[28:20] outs to the Lord there's no asking a
[28:22] question it's a statement
[28:24] the Lord hears you
[28:26] the Lord responds to you
[28:28] in a day of trouble
[28:31] this isn't a question this is you speak
[28:33] and he answers
[28:37] you know someone
[28:39] who is claiming the position
[28:41] will testify that they are hearing from
[28:43] the Lord
[28:45] and we're grateful when we do
[28:48] someone who's doing the work
[28:50] the Lord hears them
[28:55] you know brother Branham spoke of a
[28:57] people once coming to a place
[29:00] that they will know what he wants done
[29:04] with the word
[29:06] not that they'll believe it
[29:09] not that they'll accept it but that
[29:12] they'll perform the work that the word
[29:15] is supposed to perform
[29:19] you know he always responds to his word
[29:22] doing the job putting the word to work
[29:27] if you skip down to verse 6 of Psalm 20
[29:29] he explains this a bit more now no I
[29:32] that the Lord saaveth his anointed
[29:36] you know not only does he respond when
[29:37] you speak you know he does there's no
[29:41] hope so there's no question you expected
[29:45] there's no name it claim it nonsense
[29:49] this isn't making a claim or getting
[29:50] worked up in a church service this is
[29:53] knowing that he responds when you speak
[29:55] his word because you're practiced at
[29:57] doing it
[30:00] you know that word anointed there is
[30:01] actually Messiah
[30:04] anointed one
[30:06] Christ in the Greek
[30:10] he will hear from his holy heaven with
[30:15] the saving strength of his right hand
[30:17] there is one who he responds to
[30:20] and it's his word
[30:23] this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[30:27] you're doing the work if you're speaking
[30:30] forth what he will respond to which is
[30:32] the word
[30:34] still in verse 1. the name of the god of
[30:38] Jacob defend thee
[30:40] again
[30:41] a statement of fact not a prayer
[30:44] not a hope that he will defend you
[30:47] but it's a statement again the King
[30:49] James version footnote here says the
[30:52] name of the god of Jacob set thee on
[30:54] high
[30:56] proof of being about the work
[31:00] you know someone who is making a claim
[31:02] to a position
[31:05] will be all about standing against the
[31:08] enemy
[31:10] but someone who's doing the job
[31:12] is not
[31:14] fighting the enemy
[31:15] they're being lifted up above them
[31:20] moving to a place that's even beyond
[31:22] their reach
[31:23] leaving the enemy behind
[31:26] not fighting him
[31:28] leaving him in your dust
[31:30] doing the work
[31:33] lifted up above David says in the
[31:35] Rapture chapter of Psalm 27
[31:38] verse 6 and now shall mine head be
[31:41] lifted up above
[31:43] mine enemies
[31:46] you know brother Branham spoke about how
[31:48] if Eve had stayed behind the word
[31:51] the enemy would not have been able to
[31:53] reach her
[31:56] not that she'd be able to fight him
[31:58] she'd be out of her his reach
[32:03] a place he cannot go
[32:06] that's still true today
[32:09] more than claiming a position
[32:12] progressing the work
[32:16] you know verse
[32:18] 6 says this we will rejoice in thy
[32:22] salvation
[32:23] and in the name of our God we will set
[32:26] up our banners
[32:27] remember in Luke 10
[32:29] when Jesus sent forth 70 men two by two
[32:34] to go into the City and progress the
[32:36] work
[32:37] they came back in verse 17 and they said
[32:41] this and the seventy returned again with
[32:43] Joy saying Lord even the devils are
[32:45] subject unto us through thy name
[32:49] and their rejoicing was based on the
[32:51] fact that they were defeating devils
[32:54] but that's not the basis of our joy
[32:59] that's not what we get excited about
[33:02] Jesus told them in Luke 10 20
[33:04] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not
[33:08] that the spirits are subject to you
[33:12] but rather Rejoice because your names
[33:14] are written in heaven
[33:18] you see they're rejoicing our rejoicing
[33:20] is based on the fact
[33:23] not that we're defeating Devils our
[33:26] focus is not defeating devils
[33:30] the focus is the name we've been given
[33:34] it's a saving name
[33:36] not a defeating name
[33:38] it's about imparting life
[33:40] not defeating devils
[33:44] and that's just verse one
[33:47] you know let's stand this morning we're
[33:49] going to go ahead and read Psalm 20.
[33:50] it's just a short little psalm
[33:53] this is the resume of one who's doing
[33:55] the work
[33:56] not just claiming holds to a position
[33:59] as we'll read verse 2 verse 3 verse 4
[34:02] statement after statement
[34:06] claim not just claims statements this is
[34:09] happening
[34:10] progressing the work
[34:14] Lord help me to be about the work
[34:18] you know as we continue to see God
[34:20] moving in this hour
[34:22] how many of you believe he is moving in
[34:24] this hour
[34:26] you know I pray that we're not among
[34:28] those who are simply claiming a position
[34:32] getting excited about a position that
[34:34] we've been promised
[34:36] but are progressing the work
[34:39] as evidenced by the scripture
[34:44] being about our father's business
[34:47] let's read our resume this morning
[34:51] the resume of those who are doing the
[34:53] work
[34:55] not just claiming the position
[34:59] starting in verse one let's read that
[35:00] together the Lord hear thee in the day
[35:03] of trouble the name of the god of Jacob
[35:06] defend thee send thee help from the
[35:08] sanctuary and strengthen thee out of
[35:11] Zion remember all thy offerings and
[35:14] accept thy burnt sacrifice Selah Grant
[35:18] thee according to thine own heart and
[35:20] fulfill all thy counsel we will rejoice
[35:23] in thy salvation and in the name of our
[35:26] God we will set up our banners the Lord
[35:29] fulfill all thy positions now know I
[35:33] that the Lord saveth his anointed he
[35:36] will hear him from his holy heaven with
[35:38] the saving strength of his right hand
[35:40] some trust in chariots and summon horses
[35:43] but we will remember the name of the
[35:46] Lord Our God they are brought down and
[35:49] Fallen but we are risen and stand
[35:51] upright save Lord let the king hear us
[35:55] when we call
[35:59] praise the Lord you may have your seats
[36:04] now let's sing that song there's no God

[1:15:35] privilege to me to have uh brother Tom
[1:15:40] with me this morning and with you also I
[1:15:45] normally only get to see him once a year
[1:15:48] in November and this year I got a
[1:15:51] special treat so I I'm grateful for that
[1:15:54] I appreciate you doing this for us this
[1:15:57] morning just a few moments first of all
[1:16:00] thank you all for coming and and being
[1:16:03] here this morning I know we're crowded
[1:16:06] um
[1:16:07] but we invite everybody to church in
[1:16:09] this town but the fire marshal
[1:16:11] and
[1:16:13] but uh
[1:16:15] anyway God provides us and I think we
[1:16:18] have probably over 450 people this
[1:16:21] morning in our building but as 400
[1:16:23] people lifting their hands to the Lord
[1:16:25] and magnifying his name
[1:16:28] we do want to let you know if you would
[1:16:31] like to go in and inside the new
[1:16:33] building next door it's open just go
[1:16:36] through this little hallway door that's
[1:16:39] right out there and you can walk in and
[1:16:41] look around the church if you bring your
[1:16:43] children in there try not to let them
[1:16:46] run around too much be careful because
[1:16:48] they're there's you know the just the
[1:16:51] way construction is but you you're
[1:16:54] welcome to take a look if you're
[1:16:56] interested in that and keep us in prayer
[1:16:59] that certainly we would get it done uh
[1:17:03] you know I'd like to personally thank my
[1:17:05] deacons for doing such a wonderful job
[1:17:08] with the people
[1:17:09] they're really a great bunch of brothers
[1:17:12] and I really love them a whole lot
[1:17:16] a little scripture came unto my heart
[1:17:18] and I I just uh
[1:17:21] I'd like to read it to you and it's
[1:17:24] found in Hebrews the third fourth
[1:17:27] chapter and the 12th verse and it's one
[1:17:30] that we all know very very well
[1:17:33] uh
[1:17:35] and the 11th Lord says let let us labor
[1:17:38] therefore
[1:17:40] to enter into that rest
[1:17:43] lest any man fall after the same
[1:17:46] examples of unbelief
[1:17:50] for the word of God is quicker
[1:17:53] and Powerful
[1:17:55] and sharper than
[1:17:57] any two-edged sword person piercing even
[1:18:02] to the dividing asunder of Soul and
[1:18:05] Spirit
[1:18:07] and of the joint and Marrow and it is a
[1:18:11] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:18:15] the heart
[1:18:16] neither is there any creature that is
[1:18:20] not manifest in his sight
[1:18:24] but all things are naked
[1:18:27] and open
[1:18:29] unto the eyes of him
[1:18:32] with whom we have to do
[1:18:35] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:18:39] priest that is passed unto the heavens
[1:18:42] Jesus Christ
[1:18:44] Son of God let us hold fast to our
[1:18:49] profession amen I thought this morning I
[1:18:53] thought you know Lord
[1:18:55] I'm naked before you because the word of
[1:18:58] God says
[1:19:00] you have you know what I have need of
[1:19:02] there's nothing hidden your sight
[1:19:05] and I I it's just uh so why should I not
[1:19:11] take total advantage
[1:19:13] of this opportunity this morning to let
[1:19:16] God walk through my life
[1:19:18] amen separate
[1:19:21] everything in my life that needs to be
[1:19:23] separated amen I I just think we've
[1:19:27] entered into such a time of preparation
[1:19:30] for the rapture
[1:19:32] we see all the prophecies coming forth
[1:19:36] around us so quickly it's just such a
[1:19:40] time to be so serious with the gospel to
[1:19:44] lay things behind and separate ourselves
[1:19:47] from the foolishness of the world and
[1:19:50] press for that higher calling and that
[1:19:53] higher Mark and and I'm I'm just
[1:19:56] grateful
[1:19:57] that we have received the only word
[1:20:03] that prepares the bride for the Rapture
[1:20:08] I mean it's marvelous it just makes my
[1:20:11] heart rejoice
[1:20:13] and and to see so many people come from
[1:20:16] the East the West the north the South
[1:20:19] land so far so many different languages
[1:20:22] and cultures all being drawn to that
[1:20:25] same great Fountain it shows it's only
[1:20:27] one person can do that amen somebody had
[1:20:31] to sow this crop
[1:20:33] hey Mighty somebody had to plant this
[1:20:35] Garden of Believers someone had to bring
[1:20:38] it to maturity and he's here here to do
[1:20:41] that amen so let us stand again this
[1:20:45] morning as we prepare
[1:20:48] and uh we like to sing that's all

[1:25:49] opportunity it's incredible what a
[1:25:51] wedding will do isn't it
[1:25:53] I come from the East and the West that's
[1:25:56] the Brother David said the North and the
[1:25:57] South and and
[1:25:59] a large group of
[1:26:02] our people are here
[1:26:04] and I said poor are poor people
[1:26:08] I thought brother Roy would he'd love to
[1:26:10] hear Brother David which he will tonight
[1:26:12] and the different ones that have come
[1:26:16] here what they hear me what through how
[1:26:19] many times a year and and now they're
[1:26:21] here hearing me again that's weird
[1:26:24] but I just trust that the Lord will just
[1:26:26] bless
[1:26:27] each and every one
[1:26:30] the
[1:26:31] bridegroom side the bride's side
[1:26:34] everybody is here and I hope you're not

[1:26:46] time last night and we're halfway

[1:29:21] brother Billy says don't don't you use
[1:29:23] an iPad
[1:29:24] I said well I'm I'm that generation
[1:29:26] that's halfway between iPad and paper
[1:29:29] because I don't know I went to China One
[1:29:31] time I had 20 some odd Services all
[1:29:34] lined up and I bought myself a new uh a
[1:29:37] little um computer and I thought hey
[1:29:40] that's perfect I can print out my notes
[1:29:42] and everything will be fine and I
[1:29:44] arrived the first day in my computer
[1:29:45] went blue screen
[1:29:48] and I couldn't believe it was happening
[1:29:49] to me and so I was sweating from my neck
[1:29:51] down and of course I had a few Choice
[1:29:54] thoughts about Apple and
[1:29:57] and me and the vice president got to be
[1:29:59] friends actually and I we tried to
[1:30:02] correct the condition which we couldn't
[1:30:04] so then we are have some old paper notes
[1:30:08] just in case so if you don't mind I
[1:30:12] won't I won't be long this morning I
[1:30:13] know you're you've been worn out and
[1:30:15] we'll try and revive you
[1:30:19] Isaiah 53 verse 1. I'm sorry 43 Verse 1
[1:30:23] you're right
[1:30:25] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[1:30:28] thee o Jacob and he that formed thee o
[1:30:31] Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee
[1:30:35] I have called thee by thy name Thou Art
[1:30:38] mine now very quickly as we read the
[1:30:41] scripture I don't want you to think so
[1:30:44] many hundreds of thousands of years ago
[1:30:46] I want you to put your name as we read
[1:30:49] the Bible because the Bible is a
[1:30:51] personal love letter to the bride
[1:30:54] so now I'd like to reread that and I
[1:30:56] want you to keep your thoughts about
[1:30:58] yourself
[1:30:59] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[1:31:03] thee o Jacob
[1:31:06] and he that formed thee o Israel fear
[1:31:09] not for I have redeemed thee and have
[1:31:15] called thee by thy name Thou Art mine
[1:31:21] when thou passeth through the waters
[1:31:25] I will be with
[1:31:28] thee
[1:31:30] and through the rivers they shall not
[1:31:33] overflow thee will now walk us through
[1:31:37] the fire thou shall not be burned
[1:31:41] neither shall the flame Kindle
[1:31:44] upon thee
[1:31:46] for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One
[1:31:50] of Israel the Savior I gave Egypt for
[1:31:54] thy Ransom Ethiopia and siba for thee
[1:31:58] since thou was precious in my sight thou
[1:32:02] has been honorable and I have loved thee
[1:32:05] therefore will I give men for thee and
[1:32:09] people for their lives
[1:32:12] fear not
[1:32:13] I am with thee I will bring thy seed
[1:32:18] from the East and gather thee from the
[1:32:22] West
[1:32:23] I will say to the north give up and to
[1:32:27] the South keep not back bring my sons
[1:32:31] from far
[1:32:34] and my daughters from the ends of the
[1:32:37] Earth
[1:32:38] and everyone that is called by my name
[1:32:42] for I have created him for my glory I
[1:32:47] have formed him yea I have made him
[1:32:50] verse 10 you then you are my Witnesses
[1:32:56] saith the Lord my servant of whom I have
[1:33:00] chosen that you may know and believe me
[1:33:04] and understand that I am he before me
[1:33:09] there is no God
[1:33:11] formed neither shall there be after me
[1:33:15] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[1:33:17] reading of his word you may have your
[1:33:18] seats God bless you
[1:33:23] I have the grand privilege of having my
[1:33:25] granddaughter here
[1:33:27] Hannah and her husband Caleb and Hannah
[1:33:30] I was looking at a picture today dear
[1:33:32] you and I were in China together with
[1:33:35] the school and it's always nice that you
[1:33:37] can have your grandchildren serving God
[1:33:40] it's very very very special when you
[1:33:43] when us you young fellows get there
[1:33:46] you'll understand what I'm saying
[1:33:48] and so God bless Johnny nice to have you
[1:33:51] here
[1:33:53] I just love the Lord
[1:33:56] I do love the Lord
[1:33:58] let's turn to Joshua
[1:34:01] please chapter 4.
[1:34:04] Joshua chapter 4.
[1:34:18] now I I I know as we approach the word
[1:34:21] and then everybody might even have a
[1:34:23] conceived idea of where the preacher is
[1:34:25] going to preach and even some of our
[1:34:28] people my people might think that also
[1:34:30] but we just want to be led by the Holy
[1:34:34] Spirit to take the word and make it
[1:34:36] personal and that it will be spiritual
[1:34:38] food and due season for you individually
[1:34:41] and so I know we've had some great
[1:34:43] events but the greatest event there is
[1:34:45] is the opening of the word brother Peter
[1:34:47] and so now uh Joshua chapter 4 verse 1.
[1:34:51] and it came to pass when all the people
[1:34:54] that were clean passed over Jordan that
[1:34:56] the Lord spake unto Joshua saying take
[1:34:59] you 12 men out of the people out of
[1:35:01] every tribe a man and command ye them
[1:35:04] saying take you hands out of the midst
[1:35:07] of Jordan out of the place where the
[1:35:09] priests feet stood firm 12 Stones and
[1:35:12] you shall carry them over with you and
[1:35:15] leave them in the lodging place where
[1:35:18] you shall Lodge this night why God was
[1:35:22] wanting to have a witness
[1:35:24] of his glory and of his power
[1:35:29] and so then Joshua called the 12 men of
[1:35:31] whom he prepared of the children of
[1:35:33] Israel out of every tribe a man and
[1:35:36] Joshua said unto them pass over before
[1:35:38] the Ark of the Lord your God into the
[1:35:41] midst of Jordan take you up every man of
[1:35:44] you a stone upon his shoulder a court
[1:35:48] it's not a pebble here
[1:35:50] this wasn't a pebble revelation
[1:35:53] this was a stone they had to carry on
[1:35:55] their shoulder the burden of the word of
[1:35:59] thou Lord was becoming a reality and the
[1:36:02] stone upon their shoulder according to
[1:36:04] the number of the tribes of the children
[1:36:06] of Israel this may be a sign among you
[1:36:09] that when your children ask their
[1:36:13] fathers in time to come say what meaneth
[1:36:16] these Stones then you will answer them
[1:36:18] and say that the Waters of Jordan were
[1:36:20] cut off before the Ark of the Covenant
[1:36:23] of the Lord
[1:36:24] and when it comes to Passover Jordan the
[1:36:26] Waters of Jordan were cut off and these
[1:36:29] Stones shall be a memorial unto the
[1:36:32] children of Israel forever and the
[1:36:35] children of Israel did so as Joshua
[1:36:37] commanded took up the 12 Stones Out of
[1:36:40] the midst of Jordan as the Lord's fake
[1:36:42] unto Joshua according to the number of
[1:36:45] tribes
[1:36:47] of the children of Israel and carried
[1:36:49] them over with them unto a place where
[1:36:51] they lodged and laid them down there
[1:36:56] what a testimony
[1:36:57] what a testimony
[1:37:00] here we are looking at the scripture and
[1:37:02] we're wondering how how is the word
[1:37:05] going to affect me or how is it going to
[1:37:08] be applicable within my life because if
[1:37:12] the scripture isn't applicable to you
[1:37:14] it's a story
[1:37:16] and we don't like storytelling we love
[1:37:19] word preaching
[1:37:21] and the word the word went forth and
[1:37:26] delivered the people it doesn't say
[1:37:28] stories
[1:37:30] went forth and delivered the people but
[1:37:32] the word of God went forth and delivered
[1:37:34] the people so I might ask you there's a
[1:37:37] number of saints here this morning every
[1:37:39] one of you so individual every one of
[1:37:41] you with all different backgrounds but
[1:37:43] every one of you have a need
[1:37:44] period
[1:37:46] there's not one of us that doesn't have
[1:37:48] a need and I happen to know a God that
[1:37:51] can meet your need this morning
[1:37:53] and it's not going to me me telling you
[1:37:56] things but if I could take you to the
[1:37:59] word and let the word speak to your
[1:38:01] heart then when the word does it it's
[1:38:05] forever
[1:38:07] it's eternal and so if you wouldn't if
[1:38:11] you wouldn't mind giving me some Liberty
[1:38:13] I I don't want to I I because you can
[1:38:16] swing one way or another and go
[1:38:17] intellectual and kill a church
[1:38:20] you can go emotional and kill a church
[1:38:22] we want to walk down the middle
[1:38:26] of this Great River of Life
[1:38:28] and I want to be looking at Lively
[1:38:30] Stones I don't want to look at any dead
[1:38:32] stones here today I want people that
[1:38:34] actually came out of death and the voice
[1:38:37] of God raised them up
[1:38:40] and that you can say what meaneth these
[1:38:42] Stones Daddy I am a Son of God born by
[1:38:46] the word of God delivered by the hand of
[1:38:49] God
[1:38:50] that has to become a personal revelation
[1:38:52] and there should be a little bit of Joy
[1:38:55] knowing that you pass from Death unto
[1:38:58] life
[1:38:59] it's not a head thing I'm sorry friends
[1:39:01] I don't go for head hallelujahs
[1:39:04] or head amens
[1:39:08] we're priests we're Kings giving praise
[1:39:12] and you don't praise them by your head
[1:39:18] whose name was I thinking right now
[1:39:22] huh
[1:39:24] who said James
[1:39:26] there you go James
[1:39:28] God had him in his thoughts
[1:39:31] all I know that he has all your thoughts
[1:39:35] collectively in the great mind of God
[1:39:38] and so yes indeed he had everyone
[1:39:41] Jackson he's got everyone Caleb he's got
[1:39:44] every one of you in his thoughts
[1:39:47] so now if God has you in his thoughts
[1:39:51] can I can I just say something
[1:39:55] if you were ever in his thoughts you
[1:39:57] were always in his thoughts
[1:40:00] okay so any devil that's trying to get
[1:40:04] you this morning say well I don't know
[1:40:06] if I'm in or I don't know if I'm out if
[1:40:08] you've ever found yourself in the mind
[1:40:10] of God there's no devil there's no doubt
[1:40:14] there's no preacher there's no doctrine
[1:40:17] that will take you out of the mind of
[1:40:19] God
[1:40:21] you are always in his mind and you
[1:40:23] always will be in his mind
[1:40:28] so now I'd like to preach on living
[1:40:31] Witnesses
[1:40:33] living Witnesses Living Stones
[1:40:39] living
[1:40:43] foreign
[1:40:44] you can walk through life and you can
[1:40:46] walk through malls or you can walk
[1:40:48] through a gas station you go anywhere
[1:40:49] wherever you were the last week
[1:40:52] and all you see are people dead while
[1:40:55] they're living
[1:40:57] and I I saw this you see this in the
[1:41:00] advertisement you know Satan is such a
[1:41:03] mocker
[1:41:04] he's a mocker I mean I don't know I've
[1:41:08] never seen it I don't know what they're
[1:41:09] talking about but I just walked through
[1:41:11] and they got this this advertisement The
[1:41:14] Walking Dead
[1:41:17] I said
[1:41:18] exactly
[1:41:21] so they got to make a movie of it
[1:41:24] just walk out on our streets
[1:41:27] I don't know what it's about I don't
[1:41:29] know what it what it is but they are
[1:41:31] walking dead people but there's a people
[1:41:34] that are alive
[1:41:36] and you're called Lively stones
[1:41:40] amen we're not dead stones we've been
[1:41:42] birthed by eternal life himself
[1:41:46] amen we're a living people
[1:41:48] God
[1:41:51] sees you thank you brother James thank
[1:41:54] you he sees you he knows what he wants
[1:41:58] done
[1:42:00] that's what brother Brown said in white
[1:42:01] Christ speak he said the faith in you
[1:42:05] the faith in you this faith faith comes
[1:42:09] by hearing and hearing the word but you
[1:42:12] didn't even know you had Faith until
[1:42:13] Malachi 4 came
[1:42:16] and Malachi forward turn the hearts of
[1:42:18] the children back to the face
[1:42:20] of their fathers so you didn't even know
[1:42:23] you had it until this message came so
[1:42:26] now brother Brahm says faith sees what
[1:42:29] God wants done
[1:42:32] all right and I I hope this goes in he's
[1:42:36] talking to the people Faith doesn't look
[1:42:39] at the present time
[1:42:41] Faith doesn't look at your failures
[1:42:44] I want you to stay with me Faith does
[1:42:46] not look at your failures he looks at
[1:42:49] you in glory rejoicing around the Throne
[1:42:52] of God
[1:42:56] so Faith doesn't look at this present
[1:42:59] time
[1:43:00] Faith doesn't see this here
[1:43:03] Faith sees what God wants he wants a
[1:43:07] church triumphant Victorious
[1:43:11] hmm
[1:43:12] amen I'm so happy
[1:43:17] no there's there's an expression
[1:43:20] that you want to see you see your child
[1:43:22] if he's sitting on the stairs and he's
[1:43:25] moping around what's the matter honey
[1:43:26] what's wrong with you you see people
[1:43:28] sitting in church moping
[1:43:34] you know
[1:43:36] um they don't know my problems God knows
[1:43:39] all your problems
[1:43:40] and the problem of it is your faith
[1:43:42] hasn't reached at a level yet of
[1:43:45] trusting in God to meet all your needs
[1:43:48] according to his riches in glory
[1:43:51] we still bring God down to our level he
[1:43:55] wants to bring us up to his level
[1:43:59] so where you can say I can do all things
[1:44:01] through Christ Jesus that what
[1:44:03] strengthens me
[1:44:05] amen
[1:44:07] so if we don't have a miracle working
[1:44:10] God then what kind of a God have we got
[1:44:13] if God can't save you deliver you heal
[1:44:16] you
[1:44:17] why are we serving him
[1:44:20] but that's the God we serve he's the god
[1:44:23] of the supernatural
[1:44:25] so now Faith doesn't see this here
[1:44:28] Faith looks to what God wants
[1:44:31] God's wanting a Victorious Church Christ
[1:44:35] and mystery God revealed very often
[1:44:37] quoted God wants that you know that
[1:44:40] that's not no big surprise I'm not
[1:44:42] bringing you some big revelation God
[1:44:44] knows it God knows a prophet spoke it
[1:44:48] now he also knows whether or not you've
[1:44:51] heard it preach which you have or you've
[1:44:54] read it now that's what God wants for
[1:44:56] you what do you want
[1:44:59] it really gets down what do you want
[1:45:02] as I've often said to our young people I
[1:45:05] says you love you you know your little
[1:45:06] girls have their tea parties they have
[1:45:09] their little fake tea parties they got
[1:45:11] little cups and saucers and they have
[1:45:13] that little well we have our pity
[1:45:14] parties
[1:45:16] and and when we have those kind of
[1:45:18] parties we want to out pity the other
[1:45:20] person
[1:45:23] isn't that weird
[1:45:25] that to me is totally bizarre
[1:45:28] oh if you only knew me
[1:45:32] huh my pity is bigger than your pity it
[1:45:35] used to be in the sandbox my daddy was
[1:45:37] bigger than your daddy
[1:45:38] but as we get older we get into these
[1:45:40] different Realms but God is wanting us
[1:45:42] to look past
[1:45:44] and look into the realm where God dwells
[1:45:48] so Faith looks to what God wants and it
[1:45:52] works accordingly
[1:45:54] it works accordingly so now you say
[1:45:56] brother Tom I got faith this morning to
[1:45:58] believe for the impossible well then it
[1:46:00] starts to work accordingly it starts to
[1:46:03] well up within you saying Lord that's
[1:46:05] what's for me I'm a needy person you're
[1:46:08] a God that meets my needs it works
[1:46:10] accordingly so now you do something
[1:46:14] so you you want the preacher to do it or
[1:46:16] you want the pastor to do it but you've
[1:46:18] got to actually put your faith to action
[1:46:22] and brother Bram so often said you
[1:46:24] didn't even know sir that you had that
[1:46:26] much face
[1:46:27] and you've got it and you don't even
[1:46:29] realize you got it you got much Faith
[1:46:31] here this morning and let's start
[1:46:33] exercising that Faith because Faith
[1:46:35] doesn't look at the present it looks to
[1:46:37] see what God wants he wants a church
[1:46:40] translated
[1:46:44] it works accordingly and that's what
[1:46:46] faith does see it sees what God wants
[1:46:50] and what God wants done
[1:46:53] Faith operates through that
[1:46:57] why because he's wanting you and me to
[1:47:01] be a living Witness
[1:47:04] of a living God and we wonder sometimes
[1:47:08] why do our young people leave I wonder
[1:47:11] what kind of lives the parents are
[1:47:13] living
[1:47:17] we're going to get it right down to home
[1:47:20] because you're the living examples to
[1:47:23] them
[1:47:24] they don't see you with joy why should
[1:47:27] they have joy they hear the preacher say
[1:47:29] you should have Joey unspeakable and
[1:47:32] full of glory and daddy and mommy are
[1:47:34] sitting there without anything
[1:47:37] and they believe that that's acceptable
[1:47:39] because they keep coming to church
[1:47:42] but is that acceptable to God
[1:47:45] and so then we start to form habits and
[1:47:47] children take on their parents natures
[1:47:51] rather than the Holy Spirit nature and
[1:47:54] that's why you must be born again
[1:47:56] irregardless of what your father and
[1:47:59] mother are as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:48:02] you must be born again
[1:48:07] outside of that saints of God you're
[1:48:09] just playing Church
[1:48:12] brother Brown said now
[1:48:14] would it would it
[1:48:19] strengthen now
[1:48:21] your faith now he's shelling to the
[1:48:24] people he knows what
[1:48:26] faith and what God wants in your faith
[1:48:28] is that so now he wants to strengthen
[1:48:31] their faith now hear what he says
[1:48:34] would you would it strengthen your faith
[1:48:40] to see Elohim
[1:48:46] there's no message like this message
[1:48:49] thanks
[1:48:51] would it help your faith
[1:48:53] to see Elohim
[1:48:58] not you and not me but him
[1:49:02] the word
[1:49:04] that's what he is he's your protection
[1:49:07] he's your Armament he's your armor he's
[1:49:10] the word of God made manifest in human
[1:49:12] flesh your flesh
[1:49:19] just a second here I thought you said
[1:49:21] you he wants you to see Elohim
[1:49:24] he's what he's wanting to see is God in
[1:49:26] flesh
[1:49:28] our faith sees what God wants
[1:49:32] would it help you to see Elohim
[1:49:35] he's your armor he's your protector
[1:49:38] the word of God that's what he is but
[1:49:41] he's made manifest the word what is it
[1:49:44] it's your protection
[1:49:46] God his words made manifest in your
[1:49:52] human flesh
[1:49:56] to see the works of God
[1:49:59] because he wants to see not dead
[1:50:01] Witnesses
[1:50:03] but living Witnesses
[1:50:06] I'm building a platform I'm only laying
[1:50:08] down a platform okay he wants to see
[1:50:12] living Witnesses
[1:50:17] would it help you to strengthen your
[1:50:20] faith to see Elohim God made manifest in
[1:50:26] human flesh
[1:50:27] your flesh
[1:50:29] My Flesh to see the works of God so now
[1:50:33] do me a favor those that have known me
[1:50:36] before have seen me preach I want you to
[1:50:38] do me a great favor this morning turn
[1:50:40] around and look at one another
[1:50:42] I want to see Elohim
[1:50:48] not her
[1:50:53] not him
[1:50:55] no way what do you think this message is
[1:50:59] it's Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ
[1:51:03] Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new
[1:51:07] all that was in God he poured into
[1:51:10] Christ all that was in Christ he poured
[1:51:13] in you
[1:51:16] Hallelujah
[1:51:17] living Witnesses of a living God
[1:51:22] not just some mental attitude I can
[1:51:25] quote brother Branham he said this here
[1:51:28] and he said that there I don't want your
[1:51:30] quote I want your life
[1:51:36] Hallelujah
[1:51:38] it's a life in Christ
[1:51:43] you can fall asleep fall asleep but if
[1:51:45] you get him you're a living testimony
[1:51:48] [Applause]
[1:51:54] isn't what I want to do this morning is
[1:51:56] boot every doubting demon
[1:52:00] because listen we can play Church long
[1:52:02] enough
[1:52:03] but what we are we are the church
[1:52:07] all you are creating a building to make
[1:52:10] you more comfortable but that's a
[1:52:12] building
[1:52:13] a match should go to that building we're
[1:52:16] having wildfires all over the place and
[1:52:18] it's burning down buildings and people's
[1:52:20] homes and they say for their life
[1:52:22] savings and what did it mean
[1:52:25] nothing
[1:52:28] hey honey let's save for this let's save
[1:52:30] for that we've got to put money away for
[1:52:32] this money away for that and some crazy
[1:52:34] forest fire comes
[1:52:38] burns the whole thing up and you save
[1:52:41] scrimped
[1:52:44] I think we should start living for the
[1:52:46] day
[1:52:47] sufficient
[1:52:48] come on live for the day Saints this
[1:52:51] world's going on fire
[1:52:52] and it's going to be built burnt with a
[1:52:55] Holy Fire
[1:52:57] we're seeing it all over my wife said to
[1:52:59] me as I said to the brothers the other
[1:53:00] day she said to me honey when brother
[1:53:02] Brown saw that vision of American ashes
[1:53:05] was he meaning the forest fires
[1:53:09] I go hey not a bad problem but but I
[1:53:11] said there is one problem with that
[1:53:13] Revelation honey
[1:53:14] it's called craters
[1:53:19] I think there's craters that come with
[1:53:21] the fire
[1:53:22] okay but we're seeing as the pastor was
[1:53:24] saying we're seeing judgment all over
[1:53:27] the land we aren't building our kingdoms
[1:53:31] for here
[1:53:32] we are looking for that Eternal Kingdom
[1:53:35] that's why he said teach us how to pray
[1:53:38] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:53:42] earth as it is in heaven
[1:53:46] Hallelujah so that you could be
[1:53:49] strengthened by the word encouraged by
[1:53:51] the word built up in the word
[1:53:54] amen so that's why he said he's your
[1:53:57] protection he's your Armament he's your
[1:53:59] armor he's the word of God he's in human
[1:54:02] flesh he's in your flesh he's in my
[1:54:04] flesh
[1:54:05] and we see the works of God and you
[1:54:07] turned around and you looked at one
[1:54:08] another and you looked at God in flesh
[1:54:11] again
[1:54:13] wow
[1:54:14] who's got a problem now
[1:54:18] good answer
[1:54:20] no answer
[1:54:22] yeah that's a good answer
[1:54:24] what's her problems
[1:54:26] everything
[1:54:27] Works to the bad
[1:54:30] now come on come on
[1:54:32] everything works to the bad
[1:54:36] well some of you believe it
[1:54:40] oh man that was this happening to me it
[1:54:43] is happening to you because God's
[1:54:46] Building character
[1:54:48] [Applause]
[1:54:49] so there's no woe is me it's all to his
[1:54:54] glory
[1:54:55] [Applause]
[1:54:57] amen so everything that happens is for a
[1:55:01] reason right Sam everything right
[1:55:07] you might not like God's reason
[1:55:12] you don't like the knot hole glamming
[1:55:14] out backwards
[1:55:16] but God knows how to mold his bride
[1:55:19] amen and we have perfect trust in his
[1:55:22] perfect molding listen to what he says
[1:55:25] in perseverance are we strangers to one
[1:55:27] another lady
[1:55:29] so now God's going to confirm listen to
[1:55:31] me this is for free anybody that comes
[1:55:35] against this message
[1:55:37] and spends a moment's time reading
[1:55:40] garbage about why this message isn't
[1:55:43] real
[1:55:44] you need help
[1:55:47] because those people have never met the
[1:55:50] god that William Branham
[1:55:54] I always call him Johnny come lately
[1:55:57] huh it's so ridiculous it's like Jason
[1:56:01] and Korra
[1:56:03] where were they before Moses
[1:56:06] come on where were they before Moses
[1:56:09] bricks bricks bricks bricks then a
[1:56:14] prophet comes on the scene and
[1:56:16] my people go
[1:56:18] [Applause]
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:22] then all of a sudden they're delivered
[1:56:25] now they murmur
[1:56:29] now they murmur right
[1:56:32] right has thought there been enough
[1:56:34] graves in Egypt that you bring us to the
[1:56:35] Red Sea my God can part any sea
[1:56:39] if he wanted to go through the Pacific
[1:56:41] Ocean right come on and make me go to
[1:56:43] Hawaii
[1:56:48] right listen
[1:56:50] 10 plagues
[1:56:53] then finally the token comes
[1:56:56] nothing happened in motion
[1:56:59] not one plague happened in the ocean
[1:57:02] protected by God
[1:57:05] Saints let's catch this little
[1:57:07] Revelation you are protected
[1:57:10] by almighty God
[1:57:15] under the blood
[1:57:20] Hallelujah
[1:57:21] Glory
[1:57:24] are we strangers to one another
[1:57:26] lady
[1:57:28] if it is raise up your hand
[1:57:32] now
[1:57:38] God
[1:57:39] delivered you
[1:57:42] raise up your hand
[1:57:46] that's a good response so now he's
[1:57:49] discerned her
[1:57:51] told her what her problem was and now he
[1:57:54] makes her confess
[1:57:56] because she has to be a living Witness
[1:58:00] sister dear we don't know each other is
[1:58:03] that right
[1:58:04] you've got a long condition is that
[1:58:07] right
[1:58:09] you're a healed sister
[1:58:11] didn't you feel that nice breeze or that
[1:58:15] presence that soft presence
[1:58:18] it's gone
[1:58:21] it's gone
[1:58:23] wasn't that what you were praying for
[1:58:27] don't you now see Elohim
[1:58:31] my
[1:58:33] I thought it was Malachi 4. I thought it
[1:58:37] was William Branham
[1:58:39] no no no no no you have to look past the
[1:58:43] Veil
[1:58:45] ah look at this Gary back there it's not
[1:58:49] Gary back there it's God and Gary back
[1:58:53] there
[1:58:54] it wasn't William Branham it was the god
[1:58:57] in William Branham
[1:59:01] so when you listen to however me however
[1:59:04] you listen to the prophet
[1:59:06] you can understand one thing for sure
[1:59:08] that that was not William random
[1:59:10] speaking
[1:59:15] don't you see Elohim
[1:59:18] God
[1:59:21] he goes God
[1:59:25] how can you doubt
[1:59:31] can't you be persistent
[1:59:34] oh my goodness it's got to happen right
[1:59:37] this very moment it's got to happen
[1:59:39] right this very moment you know God does
[1:59:41] Miracles that happens in a moment God
[1:59:43] does healing that's over time God can do
[1:59:46] whatever he wants to do
[1:59:51] he can do anything he wants to do he
[1:59:54] says now how can you doubt
[1:59:56] can't you be persistent here lady
[1:59:59] you believe God can tell me your trouble
[2:00:01] would you accept it just look at me you
[2:00:04] got it gross
[2:00:06] you believe God can tell me where that
[2:00:08] growth is
[2:00:10] it's in the intestine that's right you
[2:00:13] believe that God will heal then go as
[2:00:16] you believe so will it be
[2:00:21] ah the pastor read Hebrews 4.
[2:00:26] isn't that incredible incredible that
[2:00:29] the Holy Spirit would now have you read
[2:00:32] Hebrews 4 he's a discerner of the
[2:00:35] thought and intent of the heart
[2:00:38] is he the same yesterday
[2:00:41] today
[2:00:42] and forever
[2:00:44] but no but you want somebody to tell you
[2:00:46] or your address you know your address
[2:00:49] you want somebody to tell you your name
[2:00:51] you know your name
[2:00:52] but the word by the word is telling you
[2:00:55] who you are in the word so he came to a
[2:00:59] place of perfect faith and said if I
[2:01:01] just lay hands on you and say do you
[2:01:03] believe in Jesus name you're healed
[2:01:07] oh
[2:01:08] but I want you to tell me your name

[2:01:13] you into a higher faith
[2:01:17] higher faith to believe his word
[2:01:21] and be persistent
[2:01:28] my
[2:01:30] he says just can't you be persistent
[2:01:32] lady you believe God can tell me your
[2:01:35] trouble
[2:01:36] so he tells her trouble now go believing
[2:01:40] it will be as you believe
[2:01:43] now I could say the same thing to you
[2:01:46] because can I say I'm not not to get

[2:07:36] there's a man that came to a camp
[2:07:38] Gabe tell them you're delivered
[2:07:40] there you go
[2:07:42] are you delivered
[2:07:43] amen
[2:07:47] yes sir I love his voice
[2:07:49] I may get you in the podcast room
[2:07:53] God moves When You Believe
[2:07:58] not when you doubt it's when you believe
[2:08:03] so he's the high priest of your
[2:08:05] confession
[2:08:06] did not David first prophesy before he
[2:08:10] took off Goliath's head didn't he here's
[2:08:13] David
[2:08:14] huh and here's this monster city of a
[2:08:17] man right he's got his brass head he's
[2:08:19] got his shield he's got everything but
[2:08:21] here's Little David with his little
[2:08:22] sling walking down there and says today
[2:08:28] first he spoke it
[2:08:31] [Applause]
[2:08:35] did it happen
[2:08:37] why because he's the god of our
[2:08:39] confession David said your head's coming
[2:08:42] off today you come to me with a sword
[2:08:44] and a spear devil you try to give me
[2:08:47] sickness you try to take away my health
[2:08:49] but I come to you in the name of the
[2:08:52] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:08:56] Hallelujah why we are living Witnesses
[2:09:00] he's a living God today
[2:09:06] Glory
[2:09:08] that's right
[2:09:13] what did I what did Isaiah say
[2:09:16] but now thus saith the Lord I created
[2:09:19] thee o Jacob I have formed thee fear not
[2:09:23] I redeemed you
[2:09:25] so now now Isaiah is talking about God
[2:09:29] forming you Jeremiah said I knew you
[2:09:32] before you were formed in your mother's
[2:09:33] womb and then a prophet picks it up and
[2:09:35] said you were always in the mind of God
[2:09:38] and he just brought your great great
[2:09:40] grandfather with your grandmother made
[2:09:42] your great-grandfather to your great
[2:09:43] great grandmother your great father
[2:09:45] great grandmother father mother mother
[2:09:47] and you
[2:09:52] that was a logistic nightmare
[2:09:56] do you know how he watched over you
[2:09:58] Civil Wars
[2:10:02] Civil War Vietnam War
[2:10:05] World War
[2:10:07] plagues
[2:10:10] come on think about it have God in his
[2:10:13] greatness watched over all your great
[2:10:16] great grandparents so that you could be
[2:10:19] here this morning
[2:10:21] if he can watch over you all away
[2:10:23] he's gonna watch
[2:10:27] [Applause]
[2:10:31] Glory
[2:10:33] tribal warfares world wars millions of
[2:10:38] deaths but no bullets could watch over
[2:10:42] your until that seed passed
[2:10:47] Glory
[2:10:49] oh I think there could be a few that
[2:10:51] could jump up and do a little bit of a
[2:10:53] dance
[2:10:53] [Applause]
[2:10:55] they'll be singing they'll be shouting
[2:11:01] no you're not Presbyterians anymore
[2:11:06] I'm Lutheran no you're not I'm not a
[2:11:10] Baptist I'm not a Lutheran I'm not a
[2:11:13] Pentecostal I'm a son and daughter of
[2:11:16] God
[2:11:17] whatever he did in the book of Acts it's
[2:11:19] me
[2:11:22] come on Stay With Me because I would
[2:11:24] like I want to get there
[2:11:26] because the Bible says I'll make you
[2:11:28] Witnesses and I will endure you
[2:11:31] with power
[2:11:34] what is the Holy Ghost
[2:11:36] it's God's life
[2:11:37] what's God's life it's called divine
[2:11:40] power then if you've got the Holy Ghost
[2:11:42] you've got divine power in you
[2:11:45] so then you've got power to put the
[2:11:46] devil under your foot anytime any place
[2:11:49] anywhere
[2:11:50] come on stay with me saints of God don't
[2:11:54] let your mind wander you take God at his
[2:11:56] word
[2:11:57] I'm not quoting you my idea I'm quoting
[2:12:00] you what a prophet says do you need to
[2:12:02] quote I'll give you the quote if you
[2:12:03] need the scripture I'll give you the
[2:12:04] scripture I've got nothing to think
[2:12:08] okay I got nothing to think I don't want
[2:12:11] Tom Ray's thinking I want the mind of
[2:12:13] God so let this mind that was in Christ
[2:12:16] be in you who thought it was not robbery
[2:12:20] to be equal with God
[2:12:23] when did Brother Brown preach that in
[2:12:25] 1964 unveiling of God Mighty God
[2:12:28] unveiled before us
[2:12:29] the Son of God is behind your Veil
[2:12:38] I get a better one than that one
[2:12:42] this is not Hey listen I had history 101
[2:12:44] at UBC that was the most boring class I
[2:12:47] ever had
[2:12:48] and that's exactly how I'd sit there
[2:12:52] man I could not wait till it was over I
[2:12:55] have my donut and coffee
[2:12:57] but once I found Christ
[2:13:01] there was no time limit right right
[2:13:03] there was nothing all I wanted is
[2:13:05] whatever the preacher preached
[2:13:09] that's all I want Saints I don't want
[2:13:11] your thinking I don't want Tom Rays
[2:13:13] thinking it doesn't mean nothing
[2:13:15] I had no thought to think outside of
[2:13:17] this message so David prophesied first
[2:13:20] that's why I had you say it I'm going to
[2:13:24] say it one more time one two three
[2:13:27] yeah you're a little late on that one
[2:13:29] but you say it that's what he said it's
[2:13:32] unto you as you go believing
[2:13:36] so David
[2:13:38] said today your head comes off
[2:13:41] Jesus said destroy this Temple and I'll
[2:13:43] raise it up
[2:13:45] right he said it first
[2:13:48] and then he did it
[2:13:51] then of course there was John the
[2:13:53] Baptist
[2:13:54] he prophesied again
[2:13:56] and said there is one amongst you
[2:13:59] who I'm not even worthy to unlatch his
[2:14:02] shoelace
[2:14:04] and then a few days later Behold The Man
[2:14:07] Who
[2:14:09] the Lamb of
[2:14:11] the Lamb of God that taking the
[2:14:15] the
[2:14:16] of
[2:14:18] are you part of the world
[2:14:19] your sins are gone
[2:14:25] amen Let's Take God at his work
[2:14:28] every sin you ever did
[2:14:30] have done and will do
[2:14:33] the blood
[2:14:35] it reaches to the highest mountain the
[2:14:39] blood it flows to the lowest River
[2:14:45] amen
[2:14:47] so we know David prophesied then it
[2:14:49] happened Jesus prophesied then it
[2:14:51] happened John prophesied then it
[2:14:53] happened how about Abraham
[2:14:55] go go offer your son Isaac so he
[2:14:59] Journeys three days and said the lad and
[2:15:03] I shall return
[2:15:07] first speak it
[2:15:09] then it manifests
[2:15:11] okay so now what you want to do this
[2:15:13] morning you spoke it watch God manifest
[2:15:16] it
[2:15:17] it's manifesting time
[2:15:20] the fruit is on the vine and our lovely
[2:15:23] one is coming in Plainview
[2:15:26] amen for we knew in part
[2:15:30] and we prophesied in part
[2:15:32] but when that which is perfect is come
[2:15:35] then that which is imparts done away
[2:15:38] when I was a child I speak as a child I
[2:15:42] understood as a child I thought as a
[2:15:45] child but when I became the bride
[2:15:48] a man
[2:15:50] I put away childish things for now we
[2:15:54] see through a glass Darkly but then
[2:15:56] prophesying
[2:15:58] then face to face now I know in part but
[2:16:03] then I shall know even as I also am
[2:16:08] known
[2:16:10] God knew you would be here
[2:16:15] God knew you would be in this room
[2:16:18] he knew you would hear this little
[2:16:20] message
[2:16:21] so now he listened to the amplify here
[2:16:23] for now in this time of imperfection we
[2:16:27] see in the mirror dimly blurred
[2:16:30] reflection it's Enigma mystery puzzle
[2:16:33] but then when a time of perfection comes
[2:16:37] when the time of perfection comes we
[2:16:40] will see ourselves in reality
[2:16:45] when the bride sees who she is Christ Mr
[2:16:49] God revealed then we are
[2:16:52] raptured all right
[2:16:56] face to face now I know in part just in
[2:16:58] fragments but then
[2:17:00] I will know fully just as I've been
[2:17:03] fully known by God
[2:17:08] brother Bram says this question is
[2:17:09] announcers 1964.
[2:17:12] he says in First Corinthians 13 it says
[2:17:15] when thou which is perfect has come that
[2:17:16] which in part shall be done away so all
[2:17:18] these things jumping up and down like a
[2:17:20] kid trying to talk in tongues and all
[2:17:22] these other things when that which is
[2:17:24] perfect and we do have today by God's
[2:17:28] help the perfect interpretation of the
[2:17:32] word with Divine Vindication
[2:17:35] then that which is in part is done away
[2:17:39] so when I was a child I spake as a child
[2:17:43] I understood as a child but when I
[2:17:46] became a man
[2:17:47] I put away childish things
[2:17:51] it doesn't put away your joy
[2:17:55] it doesn't put away your rejoicing it
[2:17:58] doesn't put away if you want to lift up
[2:17:59] your hands and the Holy Spirit takes you
[2:18:02] and you run if God wanted you to run you
[2:18:05] run if you want you to dance dance but
[2:18:07] do it by the spirit not by the flesh
[2:18:11] because we're not children anymore we're
[2:18:14] Children of the word that's what I'm
[2:18:16] saying you can take it all on one side
[2:18:18] here and be intellectual and you're dead
[2:18:20] take it all over on this side it goes
[2:18:22] into fanaticism let's marry them both
[2:18:25] together and you'll have the word of God
[2:18:33] messages
[2:18:34] praise the Lord
[2:18:39] everybody still with me
[2:18:41] okay just a second let me check
[2:18:43] I got one more hour to go
[2:18:45] [Laughter]
[2:18:50] I might take an hour and 15.
[2:18:56] if you've got your Bibles turn to first
[2:18:58] John
[2:18:59] chapter 2.
[2:19:04] first John chapter 2.
[2:19:13] so now the problem with having 17 of our
[2:19:16] people here this is part two Vine part
[2:19:19] one
[2:19:20] so you get part two you haven't heard
[2:19:22] part one yet so in November you'll get
[2:19:25] maybe part one no you won't
[2:19:30] so I haven't preached it at home so this
[2:19:32] is for you
[2:19:33] okay
[2:19:35] first John 2
[2:19:37] verse 13.
[2:19:43] you ask me why I'm happy and I'll just
[2:19:47] tell you why
[2:19:49] well I am
[2:19:52] en you know that's what I don't get
[2:19:55] that's why I don't get I whenever the
[2:19:58] devil gets me I say devil just just
[2:20:00] remember I'm sinless
[2:20:03] huh that'll put on anybody's smile on
[2:20:06] anybody's face
[2:20:08] huh yeah I'm sinless take that one devil
[2:20:13] you might as well hey I remember when my
[2:20:16] youngest son Joel wasn't saved yet and
[2:20:18] I'd come walk in the house and sister
[2:20:19] Joanne would be ironing and she said
[2:20:21] devil
[2:20:22] I said who are you talking to
[2:20:24] talking to she said I'm talking to the
[2:20:26] devil
[2:20:27] I said okay what are you telling them
[2:20:29] you can't have my son
[2:20:32] you can't have them
[2:20:34] he's mine
[2:20:35] God given
[2:20:37] come on listen saints of God you might
[2:20:41] think I'm nuts but you might as well
[2:20:43] tell the devil if you go Wayward signs I
[2:20:46] claim my sons
[2:20:49] they're mine God gave them to me I'm
[2:20:52] under a token message
[2:20:54] I'll not leave my little ones behind not
[2:20:58] a hoof not a cattle nothing
[2:21:02] Hallelujah
[2:21:06] serious we're serious people we're sober
[2:21:10] people
[2:21:11] we're not a bunch of frivolity around
[2:21:14] here
[2:21:15] we're serious we can we can have joy and
[2:21:17] be serious
[2:21:19] I I had a couple of them moved for a few
[2:21:21] months from Germany normally when they
[2:21:23] move I know they're going back so I I I
[2:21:25] I keep I do I'm the prodder
[2:21:28] so they came to me and they said
[2:21:31] he said that you know
[2:21:34] he'll never hear this tape so
[2:21:37] I hope
[2:21:39] he says y'all
[2:21:41] he goes uh
[2:21:43] do you sell good tile here
[2:21:45] no I said we don't sell good tile here I
[2:21:48] thought so I need to get
[2:21:51] trial in Germany and fly it to Canada
[2:21:54] yeah yeah
[2:21:55] I said you do we have rotten tile here
[2:21:59] terrible
[2:22:01] okay got a good tile there you got a
[2:22:03] good tile there here I go nope
[2:22:06] we have rotten tile layers
[2:22:08] I thought so
[2:22:11] I'll have to fly him from Germany
[2:22:15] I said yeah you better
[2:22:17] and then his wife came up and she said
[2:22:19] Tom is playing with you
[2:22:24] but you find if you come from Germany
[2:22:26] everything's better in Germany
[2:22:29] I'm not picking on German I hope there's
[2:22:30] no Germans here
[2:22:33] I had there was a brother named brother
[2:22:35] Franz and he built our pulpit
[2:22:37] and uh all the young brothers that just
[2:22:40] got out of school they needed a job and
[2:22:42] he they would work for brother Franz and
[2:22:44] brother Franz he's already gone to Glory
[2:22:45] so he can't hear me
[2:22:48] and I would you know go across the
[2:22:50] border I'd get some of our our our mail
[2:22:53] and so forth across the border and I'd
[2:22:55] come back and he was living close to the
[2:22:57] border so I'd pull in and have a coffee
[2:22:58] with brother Franz he says and brother
[2:23:00] Franz was shorter than me if you can
[2:23:02] imagine
[2:23:03] and he says Tom he goes there's no good
[2:23:07] workers in Canada
[2:23:09] I go I know we have a problem he says I
[2:23:13] thought so
[2:23:15] hahaha
[2:23:16] I said Frozen if there's no good workers
[2:23:18] here why did you move here
[2:23:19] go back to Germany they're all good
[2:23:22] workers there you'll have a happy day
[2:23:25] but saints were not of Germany
[2:23:28] we're not a United States of America
[2:23:30] we're not of Canada
[2:23:33] I want you to get my point the point is
[2:23:35] this we are children of the king
[2:23:40] Hallelujah and we've been birthed by our
[2:23:43] heavenly father I have not been birthed
[2:23:47] by a man I have not been birthed by
[2:23:49] brother biscoll I've been birthed by
[2:23:51] Jesus Christ
[2:23:54] it's not a church that's gonna give you
[2:23:56] the accolades or the the minister that's
[2:23:59] going to do it it will be Jesus himself
[2:24:01] that will say Well done my faithful
[2:24:04] servant
[2:24:05] answer now into the joys of the Lord
[2:24:11] listen we had a tremendous camp we had a
[2:24:13] tremendous camp
[2:24:14] and the thing of it is we don't want to
[2:24:15] limit God
[2:24:17] because again you can go one side or the
[2:24:18] other I was telling Brother David in the
[2:24:20] back my my grandson's wife two o'clock
[2:24:23] in the morning was just a holy ghost got
[2:24:26] a hold of her she was going all over the
[2:24:28] the tent round and around eyes closed
[2:24:31] for over an hour or so
[2:24:34] just lost in God
[2:24:36] and people say well that's that's
[2:24:37] Pentecostal that's emotionalism no
[2:24:39] that's God
[2:24:41] we don't want to label to throw you
[2:24:43] don't want to throw the baby out with
[2:24:44] the bathwater
[2:24:46] we want God whatever form he comes
[2:24:49] and as I would say to our young people
[2:24:51] as I would say to wherever I go God now
[2:24:55] emotion is emotion but when it's God
[2:24:57] it's God
[2:24:59] so if if a young person gets they say
[2:25:02] delivered by emotion it only lasts a
[2:25:04] period of time but if you get delivered
[2:25:07] by the word
[2:25:08] it'll last forever
[2:25:10] so a word Deliverance is what we're
[2:25:13] looking for
[2:25:17] you still at First Peter two
[2:25:19] thirteen I'm writing to you fathers
[2:25:22] because you know him
[2:25:24] who has been from the beginning
[2:25:26] I'm writing unto you young man because
[2:25:29] you have overcome
[2:25:31] now I want you to notice that you have
[2:25:33] overcome
[2:25:36] not what you will overcome
[2:25:39] you have overcome
[2:25:42] the reason I'm saying that is a perfect
[2:25:44] tense
[2:25:45] and in its perfect tense
[2:25:48] it shows then it's a permanent victory
[2:25:54] now I'm not uh if anyone here knows that
[2:25:58] was my toughest class in University was
[2:26:00] English but I know what a perfect tense
[2:26:02] is and when you have a perfect tense
[2:26:05] what it's really but what it's saying is
[2:26:08] exactly what I just said it's a perfect
[2:26:10] tense that means he has delivered he is
[2:26:14] delivering he will deliver
[2:26:17] so now you have overcome is a perfect
[2:26:19] tense which gives you the picture of a
[2:26:22] permanent victory
[2:26:24] write that one in your Bible write it in
[2:26:27] your mind write it wherever you want
[2:26:30] Satan I am a permanent
[2:26:34] Victorious son and daughter of God
[2:26:38] Bible Bible
[2:26:45] I'm writing you young men because you
[2:26:47] have overcome the evil one I've written
[2:26:51] to you children because you know the
[2:26:52] father I have written unto you fathers
[2:26:55] because you know him who has from the
[2:26:58] beginning I have written into you young
[2:27:00] men because you are strong and the word
[2:27:03] of God abides in you
[2:27:05] and you have
[2:27:08] overcome
[2:27:10] can you say that with me
[2:27:14] you have overcome
[2:27:18] so now here's John writing prophesying
[2:27:21] about you and me
[2:27:24] you
[2:27:25] have overcome because he's the god of
[2:27:28] the present
[2:27:30] not to go to the Past
[2:27:32] not a god of the future he's everything
[2:27:36] so now you have overcome
[2:27:43] perfect tense one more time so if you
[2:27:47] just did you know Brothers had done one
[2:27:49] place he says sometimes you have to roll
[2:27:50] up your sleeves I you know I'm not a a
[2:27:53] Greek guy I'm not a Hebrew scholar just
[2:27:56] look up the odd word it helps you
[2:27:59] and then when you look it up and you
[2:28:00] find out that in its perfect tense you
[2:28:04] have permanent victory
[2:28:07] so the only time you haven't had
[2:28:09] victories let your flesh control you
[2:28:12] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[2:28:14] so the only time you don't have Victory
[2:28:16] is when you let Tom Ray dictate
[2:28:21] the Inner Man
[2:28:25] so then then brother Brown say in uh the
[2:28:29] things that are to be he said now the
[2:28:32] inside man takes control of the outer
[2:28:36] man
[2:28:37] so that's the time we're living in it is
[2:28:40] a perfect tense it's a perfect verb and
[2:28:43] it's to show that it's complete your
[2:28:46] Victory is complete your Victory is
[2:28:49] finished and it's perfected
[2:28:53] uh
[2:28:55] well that's oh that's not a bad thought
[2:28:57] no that is a great thought
[2:28:59] that's one of the greatest thoughts that
[2:29:01] I've read this morning that's a great
[2:29:03] thought
[2:29:04] you said oh over to him that's a great
[2:29:05] thought no that's more than a great
[2:29:07] thought
[2:29:08] to realize in this perfect tense verb
[2:29:12] that it's an action and in that action
[2:29:14] you have overcome
[2:29:17] means that you are completely overcoming
[2:29:25] write it down I don't care write it down
[2:29:28] you know how many went to school with a
[2:29:30] big pen anybody here have big pens in
[2:29:32] the states huh and you'd write something
[2:29:34] on your hand because you we didn't have
[2:29:36] your um yeah we didn't have phone
[2:29:39] smartphones
[2:29:40] notebooks we had skin
[2:29:47] and then especially when an exam came
[2:29:55] oh that's what the answer is
[2:29:59] but this is and those things weren't
[2:30:02] worth writing down
[2:30:04] but this is worth writing down
[2:30:07] you can take first John
[2:30:09] 2 and 13. first John 2 and 14 and
[2:30:13] realize in its perfect tense form the
[2:30:17] way Paul was writing it that you have
[2:30:20] overcome it's a complete overcoming it's
[2:30:24] a finished overcoming and it's a perfect
[2:30:27] overcoming
[2:30:28] that overcome the squat describes the
[2:30:31] quality it goes on in the Greek to say
[2:30:34] this that overcome describes the quality
[2:30:37] of a true saint
[2:30:41] just say true saint
[2:30:43] I'm interesting don't get bound up
[2:30:45] as soon as I said now it's the quality
[2:30:47] of a true saint
[2:30:49] then you start looking at yourself again
[2:30:51] well I don't think I'm a true Saint who
[2:30:53] said that the devil said that your flesh
[2:30:56] said that the Bible never said that
[2:30:59] so why would you want to think anything
[2:31:01] other than the Bible
[2:31:03] so the Bible says this he says you are a
[2:31:06] true Saint
[2:31:07] you may stumble
[2:31:12] you may fall
[2:31:14] but God always say it God always picks
[2:31:20] you up
[2:31:21] [Music]
[2:31:24] Hallelujah I Stumble I fall but God rich
[2:31:29] in Mercy lifts you up
[2:31:35] Glory my favorite preacher won't be
[2:31:38] there
[2:31:39] my favorite brother won't be there
[2:31:42] but God will be there
[2:31:44] and that's normally when you stumble
[2:31:46] when there's nobody around you but then
[2:31:49] you get up you shake yourself off and
[2:31:52] God picked you up
[2:31:56] hahaha
[2:31:58] all right
[2:32:00] take it take it devil
[2:32:03] thank you
[2:32:07] it describes the quality of a true saint
[2:32:10] you may stumble you may fall but God
[2:32:15] always
[2:32:16] picks his feed up
[2:32:23] so it's onward
[2:32:26] come on let's go onward
[2:32:27] so it's onward and upward
[2:32:31] upward Christian Soldiers ah you've been

[2:40:02] it's a day when they call that which is
[2:40:04] good evil
[2:40:06] and that which is evil good
[2:40:08] we might as well realize we're living in
[2:40:11] that day and we can scream out this day
[2:40:13] that scripture is being fulfilled
[2:40:16] and and if I was a young couple and I
[2:40:18] had little children right now I'd be
[2:40:20] finding myself on my knees more than you

[2:41:18] meeting at our University at and I went
[2:41:22] to it a bunch of us guys us long-haired
[2:41:24] end of the hippie part people

[2:41:30] figure out who we were and we show up
[2:41:32] you know how many people were there a
[2:41:34] half a dozen
[2:41:36] and we went there to Malcolm
[2:41:39] that's what we were unfortunate well I
[2:41:41] was a mock anyways
[2:41:44] now it's gone from 1972 to 2023 and
[2:41:48] they're running the show you got the
[2:41:50] Rainbow on the White House

[2:41:58] America
[2:42:01] I know I'm gonna I'm flying out tomorrow
[2:42:04] so

[2:42:15] I'm from another kingdom right
[2:42:19] what an abomination
[2:42:22] that they show the rainbow color on the
[2:42:25] White House and proud of it
[2:42:30] and then we preach the
[2:42:32] unadulterated word of God
[2:42:34] and they want to shut you down
[2:42:39] they can't shut us down
[2:42:41] no it's onward and upward
[2:42:44] amen and as I said as this goes on how
[2:42:48] fast it is moving
[2:42:51] we used to go down the streets of
[2:42:53] Vancouver I told my boys
[2:42:56] I told my boys I said boys when I say
[2:42:58] God has saved me from the gutter
[2:43:01] I'm going to show you what the gutter
[2:43:03] was so I took them in the cars this was
[2:43:05] a array field trip
[2:43:07] Friday night seven o'clock terrible time
[2:43:10] to go downtown
[2:43:12] so we get down in in the back alleys of
[2:43:15] Vancouver
[2:43:16] and all of a sudden my wife is pushing
[2:43:18] every lock button in the car
[2:43:20] hands feet everything else is going on
[2:43:22] she says honey we got to get out of here
[2:43:25] I said I just just for boys to see
[2:43:29] so then I got scared and I said let's go
[2:43:35] and if that was in the 70s
[2:43:38] you go down that that that used to be
[2:43:40] like a maybe a city block now it's
[2:43:43] blocks upon blocks upon blocks
[2:43:48] sin has moved in
[2:43:50] but so has Heaven
[2:43:54] and brother Rams at one place don't
[2:43:56] always speak about how evil it's getting
[2:44:01] speak about how powerful
[2:44:06] [Applause]
[2:44:09] how powerful she's getting
[2:44:13] I knew in part now I know then which is
[2:44:16] perfect is come God has given us a
[2:44:19] perfect message for a perfect people to
[2:44:23] get us to a perfect place for a perfect
[2:44:26] rapture
[2:44:28] amen
[2:44:31] God bless you and may you be living
[2:44:35] Witnesses
[2:44:37] that this message is true
[2:44:41] God bless you
[2:44:46] [Applause]
[2:45:02] man
[2:45:05] I want him to preach more
[2:45:07] I want to hear it
[2:45:10] amen I want to believe it
[2:45:12] I want the revelation of it
[2:45:15] amen I want it to strike Me Prophet God
[2:45:19] says you know when it strikes you you
[2:45:21] know when it's real
[2:45:23] you know with the pastor the hard part
[2:45:25] is is that you
[2:45:28] party of your nature is
[2:45:30] you'll never leave the one behind right
[2:45:33] you know when the 99's rejoicing I'm
[2:45:36] sitting here saying is there somebody
[2:45:38] that's not right in the flop
[2:45:41] you know what I mean is there somebody
[2:45:43] there that doesn't have what we're
[2:45:45] talking about I can't help that you know
[2:45:47] that God made me that way
[2:45:50] and you know so when I I you know I
[2:45:53] don't want to shout and run around the
[2:45:55] building and jump up and down and praise
[2:45:57] God with somebody sitting there with
[2:45:59] their head down because they're
[2:46:00] broken-hearted I can't do that you know
[2:46:04] so don't don't ever misunderstand me
[2:46:06] that but it's just that
[2:46:09] when you've come where I've come from
[2:46:14] you know what he can do for somebody
[2:46:17] and you just don't want to see somebody
[2:46:19] sitting outside of that and I thought
[2:46:22] when Tom was preaching I thought you
[2:46:24] know really how simple it is
[2:46:26] you just gotta walk away
[2:46:30] he'll catch you
[2:46:33] you know what I mean I know they tell a
[2:46:36] kind of is a
[2:46:37] a
[2:46:39] a joke or a kind of a
[2:46:43] a little story about the man that drove
[2:46:46] his car off the cliff and if he jumped
[2:46:48] out and he grabbed a hold of a limb and
[2:46:52] he cried out to the Lord Lord help me
[2:46:54] Lord help me
[2:46:55] if you know come save me come save me
[2:46:58] and he's just hanging onto that limb for
[2:47:00] all his life and finally the Lord said
[2:47:02] let go
[2:47:06] you know let go
[2:47:08] put your life in his hands
[2:47:11] just let go
[2:47:14] he'll catch you
[2:47:16] amen
[2:47:18] he won't leave you
[2:47:21] but we always want to navigate our own
[2:47:23] way
[2:47:24] we want to plot our salvation
[2:47:26] we want to plot tomorrow we want to
[2:47:29] figure out how am I going to get
[2:47:31] delivered what do I have to do to get
[2:47:33] delivered and you know sometimes it's
[2:47:35] just so simple
[2:47:37] they'll just walk away from where you
[2:47:39] are
[2:47:41] just Lord this is where I am I I rejoice
[2:47:44] in what the brother Tom says I believe
[2:47:48] everything about it it's all real but
[2:47:51] I've got that part of me that is I know
[2:47:55] it's just that negative reality
[2:47:59] you know what I mean in
[2:48:02] that'll try to get you all the days of
[2:48:04] your life
[2:48:05] you know what I mean the flesh Wars
[2:48:07] against the spirit and the spirit
[2:48:09] against the flesh but identify yourself
[2:48:14] is that me
[2:48:16] or is what his spoken of me me
[2:48:21] is is the Victory and the power and the
[2:48:25] the life and and the joy and the peace
[2:48:28] is that me or is the the sin that the
[2:48:32] things that I'm doing that's not right
[2:48:35] is this me you know the beauty of it you
[2:48:37] see both of them
[2:48:41] you see them both
[2:48:43] they're they're with you now in your
[2:48:46] heart which one do you choose
[2:48:49] which one do you choose I'm going to
[2:48:52] walk away from this right right I'm
[2:48:54] going to walk away from the negativity
[2:48:56] I'm going to walk away from from the
[2:49:00] nonsense I'm doing I'm gonna walk away
[2:49:03] from the games I'm gonna walk away from
[2:49:06] the cultures I'm going to walk away from
[2:49:09] the negativity I'm gonna pick up this
[2:49:12] book

[2:49:17] I'm going to start following it I'm
[2:49:20] going to start believing it I'm going to
[2:49:22] believe everything that it says this is
[2:49:25] telling me what I am
[2:49:27] amen
[2:49:29] this other person came from from sin
[2:49:33] amen that was the person I was born into
[2:49:36] but that is not going to rule over me

[2:54:44] from this life
[2:54:48] I'd like to walk away from the person
[2:54:50] that's up here right now

[2:58:53] what a wonderful morning
[2:58:56] I would have mother Tom preach tonight
[2:58:59] but
[2:59:02] I told him I'd
[2:59:03] stand in for him and you won't be able
[2:59:06] to hear preaching like that but
[2:59:09] not everybody's made like that but we
[2:59:12] love you those that are traveling home
[2:59:15] may the Lord go with you and be with you
[2:59:18] [Music]
[2:59:21] How great is our God
[2:59:23] great nothing he can't do
[2:59:27] nothing he can't say from nothing he
[2:59:29] can't fix
[2:59:30] [Music]
[2:59:32] no marriage you can't restore no matter
[2:59:36] how wrecked
[2:59:38] no disease he can heal
[2:59:42] no matter how fatal
[2:59:45] no sin he can't forgive
[2:59:48] truth no matter how evil it is
[2:59:52] my God can do anything
[2:59:55] but fail
[2:59:58] that's the god you serve
[3:00:02] he knows what you have need of even
[3:00:04] before you ask
[3:00:05] [Music]
[3:00:07] he walks with you and he promised he'd
[3:00:10] never leave you
[3:00:11] nor forsake you
[3:00:14] don't sell them short
[3:00:20] and have what you asked for
[3:00:22] all things are possible
[3:00:25] only believe
[3:00:27] let's bow our heads
[3:00:29] our gracious father
[3:00:35] our brother spoke just this morning
[3:00:37] about what are we witnessing
[3:00:41] what God are we showing the world
[3:00:47] where is our identity lied
[3:00:52] does our identity lie in the negativity
[3:00:55] of this
[3:00:58] world that surround us
[3:01:02] or does our identity a lie in a God that
[3:01:05] can do all things
[3:01:07] [Music]
[3:01:10] and Lord if I failed you
[3:01:16] and let my candle grow dim
[3:01:21] I asked this morning Lord that you would
[3:01:24] trim my Wick
[3:01:27] that you'd set my heart aflame
[3:01:31] that I wouldn't be ashamed
[3:01:34] of all that you've done for me
[3:01:37] [Music]
[3:01:38] Lord and you said if I would confess you
[3:01:41] before men
[3:01:42] not just with my lips but with my life
[3:01:47] that I would show that there's a great
[3:01:51] hope that lives Within Me
[3:01:55] there's a great peace that has come
[3:01:57] across my soul
[3:01:59] there's a great joy that is even
[3:02:03] unspeakable
[3:02:05] because I've met the king of kings
[3:02:09] the Lord of lords
[3:02:12] The Giver of Life
[3:02:13] [Music]
[3:02:15] a present help in the time of trouble
[3:02:20] the all-powerful and Almighty creator
[3:02:23] [Music]
[3:02:26] and he cast his love towards me
[3:02:30] and he gave his only begotten son to be
[3:02:33] my kinsman redeemer
[3:02:36] Lord let that testimony live in me this
[3:02:39] morning
[3:02:41] so I walk out these doors
[3:02:43] I know in my own heart whether I've been
[3:02:46] living
[3:02:48] the caliber of life that I know to live
[3:02:53] but I'm asking you father that I can
[3:02:56] walk away from the old ways and the old
[3:03:00] man
[3:03:01] and I can walk in the newness of life
[3:03:03] this morning
[3:03:07] Lord and it's by Your Grace
[3:03:09] it's by your mercy
[3:03:12] and I implore father once more for the
[3:03:15] people
[3:03:17] for all of us here father that you once
[3:03:20] more in your great kindness
[3:03:23] which shed that mercy and Grace upon us
[3:03:27] renew our Spirits father and strengthen
[3:03:31] our resolve
[3:03:36] as the scripture says father may we ever
[3:03:39] stand true to our profession this
[3:03:42] morning and go with us we pray
[3:03:45] in Jesus precious and wonderful name we
