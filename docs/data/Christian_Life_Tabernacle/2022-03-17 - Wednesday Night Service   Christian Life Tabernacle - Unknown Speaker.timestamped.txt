[40:30] hey man i trust you're happy to be in
[40:31] the house of god tonight
[40:33] hey man i know
[40:35] midweek services probably one of the
[40:37] toughest ones because
[40:39] you know people get out of work and
[40:41] and
[40:42] up and down and trying to make it to
[40:44] church and amen certainly believe that
[40:46] the lord will give you a special
[40:48] blessing tonight and amen let's open our
[40:51] bibles in uh revelation chapter 19.
[40:54] let's read from verse six
[40:57] a very familiar scripture reading
[41:00] and uh 1996 and it says and i
[41:04] and i heard as it were
[41:06] as it were the voice of great multitude
[41:12] and as the voice of many waters
[41:15] and the voice of mighty thundering
[41:17] saying hallelujah
[41:19] for for the lord god omnipotent reigns
[41:23] reigneth he says let us be glad and
[41:26] rejoice and give honor to him
[41:28] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[41:31] and his wife
[41:33] has made herself ready
[41:35] and to her was was granted
[41:38] was granted that she
[41:40] should be arrayed in fine linen and
[41:43] clean and white and
[41:44] for for fine linen is the righteousness
[41:47] of the saint now i want to point out
[41:49] that this this was
[41:51] granted to her it's not she didn't come
[41:54] up with it herself it was granted to her
[41:56] that should be arraigned and dressed
[41:58] that way also let's turn in matthew
[42:01] chapter 25 let's read from verse one
[42:04] it says
[42:07] sorry i'm going a little too fast
[42:11] matthew chapter
[42:14] the 25th chapter and the first verse
[42:17] it says then shall then shall the
[42:19] kingdom of heaven
[42:21] be likened unto ten virgins it says
[42:24] which took their lamp and went forth to
[42:28] meet the bridegroom
[42:29] it says and five of them were wise and
[42:32] five were foolish it says to where
[42:35] they that were foolish took the lamp and
[42:37] took no oil with him but the wise took
[42:40] the all
[42:42] in the vessels and and and with their
[42:45] lamps it says
[42:47] while the
[42:48] the bridegroom terries they slumbered
[42:50] and sleep and slapped and at midnight
[42:54] there was a cry made behold the
[42:56] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[42:59] then those
[43:01] then all those virgins arose and trim
[43:04] their lamps
[43:05] it says
[43:06] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[43:09] us your oil for our lamp is gone out
[43:12] but the wise answered saying
[43:15] not so
[43:16] lest there be not enough for us and you
[43:19] but go ye rather
[43:22] to them that sell and buy for yourselves
[43:26] they too
[43:28] they too try to get ready but
[43:32] buy for yourself
[43:33] and when
[43:35] it says and while they went to buy the
[43:37] bride room came
[43:39] it says and they
[43:40] they that were ready went with them to
[43:43] the marriage
[43:45] to the marriage and the door was shut
[43:48] it says after what came
[43:50] the other virgin saying lord lord open
[43:53] for us but the answer and said verily i
[43:55] say unto you i know you're not
[43:58] i mean let's just buy our heads our
[44:00] gracious father we
[44:01] so thankful for all that you do for us
[44:03] lord and
[44:05] we ask right now your father did you
[44:06] bless the few words that we would like
[44:08] to say and speak to our hearts as we're
[44:10] gathering your presence in the name of
[44:12] the lord jesus christ we pray amen
[44:14] man you may have your seats tonight
[44:18] i know we've been fellowshipping from
[44:20] the rising the message the rising of the
[44:23] sun
[44:24] and there's probably just a little
[44:25] thought that i would like to get out of
[44:27] that in
[44:28] and and and just bring out tonight now i
[44:31] want to start out by pointing out as we
[44:34] read revelation 19 and and specifically
[44:37] verse 7 it says
[44:38] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[44:41] honor to him for the marriage of the
[44:44] lamb's come and his wife
[44:46] had made herself ready now we we we know
[44:51] even as we read the scripture
[44:53] um the that what random speaks about the
[44:56] age that we live in it says this is the
[44:58] most glorious age there ever was
[45:00] um i believe he said that
[45:02] another place that if i was asked to
[45:04] live in any other age this is the age
[45:06] that i would choose
[45:08] we understand this is the age of great
[45:10] mysteries of great promises that were
[45:12] made since the beginning
[45:14] promises that we even i would even say
[45:17] that we're given the adam that was never
[45:19] fulfilled but in the end time god will
[45:21] bring him the game to pass
[45:23] we could look at it and realize it it
[45:27] seems to be
[45:28] even as we would look we know that
[45:31] in in luke chapter 17 the scripture will
[45:35] tell us about the condition that would
[45:37] reign that would be outside that would
[45:39] be happening as far as the world is
[45:41] concerned but yet within the the bride
[45:45] even as we read the scripture says let
[45:47] us be glad and rejoice
[45:50] we are not called to be the ones that
[45:52] are uh
[45:53] sad with the world with what's happening
[45:56] or confused with what's happening
[45:57] outside
[45:58] when we we see wars or rumors of wars or
[46:02] people standing against one another or
[46:05] the the inflation and all those things
[46:07] we are not called to panic with the
[46:09] world the scripture clearly said let us
[46:11] be glad and rejoice
[46:14] and and i want to point out it's not
[46:16] because we don't see what's happening
[46:18] it's not because we oblivious of to
[46:20] what's happening but the source of our
[46:22] happiness comes from the scripture and
[46:24] the promised word is because we come to
[46:27] the realization that this world will
[46:29] pass away
[46:30] we come to the realization that this is
[46:32] happening according to the promise
[46:35] according to the fulfillment of the
[46:37] prophecy that was made for the end time
[46:39] there is nothing new under this town and
[46:41] we can look at the world and see it is
[46:44] pretty what was predicted as even as we
[46:46] look in the scriptures we see those
[46:48] things come to pass we see them come to
[46:50] pass it's a source of joy for a believer
[46:54] why because it's god speaking to you and
[46:57] proving to you that his promise is true
[47:00] they said the world was going to get in
[47:01] the condition that in if i am a believer
[47:03] and i look at it i say praise god this
[47:06] was promise if i look at it and there's
[47:08] wars and i look at it i say praise god
[47:11] this was promised it was going to come
[47:12] to pass when i see all of this chaos and
[47:15] everything i would rejoice in that to
[47:17] know that god made a prophecy and it's
[47:20] coming to pass exactly as he promised he
[47:22] would and and but he says in this time
[47:25] the bride he says let us be let us be
[47:28] glad and rejoice so it's a time of
[47:31] rejoicing because we know that we are
[47:34] walking in the promises of god we are
[47:37] walking and we are seeing the things
[47:39] that were promised to come to pass come
[47:40] to pass and if it's happening outside we
[47:43] also have to be confident that god
[47:45] within the bride within the people that
[47:48] has gathered at the end time he's also
[47:50] doing according to his promise
[47:53] i like what our pastor said last sunday
[47:55] he said uh we are we have not missed
[47:57] anything
[47:59] because someone can look at the world
[48:00] and see and say oh my i wonder what
[48:03] what's going to happen next what's going
[48:04] to happen next you were not called to
[48:07] look and keep your eyes on what's
[48:08] happening outside you were called to
[48:11] keep your eyes on the word and the
[48:13] promise that was made to you and know
[48:15] that god is fulfilling it how is he
[48:17] fulfilling it he's opened my eyes to see
[48:20] what's happening because remember unless
[48:22] you can see it it's to them the word is
[48:25] revealed to them that can see it to them
[48:28] to them the understanding that is given
[48:31] those that lack understanding they walk
[48:33] like fools they don't know what they're
[48:35] doing and they're just walking and go
[48:37] going with the flow they will try this
[48:39] today they'll try that tomorrow but
[48:41] those that have been given understanding
[48:44] when they see the things that are
[48:46] happening in the world happen they are
[48:48] standing there and watching and waiting
[48:51] for the promise that was made to them to
[48:53] come and pass in their lives
[48:56] therefore let us be rejoicing and be
[48:58] glad we're not called to be sad and say
[49:01] well i don't know you know if i lose my
[49:04] job today or if this happened today what
[49:06] am i going to do and all those things
[49:08] and and and i will say this within the
[49:10] flesh
[49:11] the devil will attack us it will go
[49:13] through your mind and say oh what if
[49:15] this happened or you know we we had here
[49:18] you know covet and everything and and
[49:21] and people running to and fro not
[49:23] knowing what to do but we realized that
[49:25] god has given the bride a promise he's
[49:28] given this people at the end time a
[49:30] promise and within his promise god will
[49:33] protect them
[49:35] he didn't call them to protect
[49:36] themselves he didn't say
[49:39] you know or even say this because this
[49:41] becomes a key element in who we are or
[49:45] what our identification is at the end
[49:47] time
[49:50] if you find yourself concerned and
[49:53] worried and and always wondering what's
[49:55] going to happen what's going to happen
[49:57] you are not standing on the correct
[49:59] promise something is missing
[50:02] your faith has not reasoned up to what
[50:04] god has called you yet you're missing
[50:06] something you need to go back to him if
[50:09] you are looking at what's happening or
[50:10] you're looking at your condition and
[50:12] wondering how am i going to get out of
[50:14] this and what's happening oh you you're
[50:16] speaking like that you don't know what
[50:18] i'm going through i don't know what
[50:20] you're going to you don't know what i'm
[50:21] going through but one thing i know is we
[50:24] have a promise that has been given to us
[50:26] that we got to walk by
[50:30] and i even want to say this the things
[50:32] that you're going through is to take you
[50:34] from where you are and bring you into a
[50:36] certain condition it's not by accident
[50:42] it's not by accident
[50:44] the things that happens to us on the
[50:45] daily basis it's not by accident it's
[50:48] god shaping his people bringing them
[50:51] into this condition it says the bride
[50:53] had met her separated she has been given
[50:55] the word and only the word will get her
[50:58] in the condition that she needs to be
[51:01] and if we look outside of the world then
[51:03] outside of the word of god then we don't
[51:05] know what we're looking for
[51:07] so so i at the the identification of the
[51:10] bride at the end time is one who's
[51:13] looking at the promise that has been
[51:15] given to her who's recognizing the hour
[51:18] that she's living in by looking at the
[51:20] condition of the world but she's not
[51:22] caught up into the hour she's caught up
[51:25] within the promise that was given to her
[51:29] you know the barbarian tells us that
[51:31] well part of overcoming is to recognize
[51:34] the devil in every single one of his
[51:35] trait and when you look at the wealthy
[51:38] record the word to recognize recognize
[51:40] it doesn't mean you necessarily need to
[51:42] engage
[51:43] it's just to look and know what's behind
[51:46] it
[51:47] it's just to look and see what's
[51:49] motivating it is to look and see the
[51:52] trick and see see what the source of it
[51:54] is is to be able to look and see who's
[51:56] behind this why is this happening and
[51:59] everything
[52:00] and it doesn't mean we necessarily need
[52:02] to engage but the other part is to
[52:04] recognize our position to know what
[52:06] we've been called for and what is the
[52:08] promise of our time even as we say as
[52:11] far as the bride is concerned what am i
[52:14] standing on and what are my
[52:15] characteristics that i need to have at
[52:18] this time
[52:19] because only when you know what you're
[52:22] supposed to be then you would be able to
[52:24] look and expect a word to make you what
[52:27] that which is you what that which you're
[52:29] waiting for because remember you cannot
[52:32] be anything that you have not seen or
[52:35] that you don't expect or you don't know
[52:37] what you're looking for that the wave
[52:39] chief was given so we have an
[52:41] expectation of what we are moving
[52:43] towards
[52:45] the waveship was me to to to take out
[52:48] the trash to kick out all the other
[52:50] expectations to remove the the the
[52:54] fiction to remove all the other clouds
[52:57] and all the other things and keep your
[52:59] focus to give you a clear vision this is
[53:02] what you are walking into and this is
[53:04] what my expectation of you is this is
[53:07] what i'm taking you from where you were
[53:09] and i'm bringing you into that
[53:14] and and so that that part of what we
[53:17] need in this end time is the recognition
[53:20] or the understanding of what is my
[53:22] identification needs to be as far as the
[53:25] bride is concerned and the
[53:26] identification is not what we say to be
[53:29] the identification but what was
[53:31] promising the word and what god is doing
[53:34] in this end time and what he expects the
[53:36] bride to be
[53:39] so
[53:41] so i would say that tonight we have seen
[53:43] the fulfillment of prophecy we have seen
[53:47] the end time resurrection and we have
[53:49] seen all those things happen and those
[53:52] things become our identification but
[53:55] says in the message
[53:57] the unconditional covenant and i'll
[54:00] probably skip some for the second time
[54:01] it says so pentecostal people
[54:04] um
[54:05] let me skip some he says uh jesus is
[54:08] jesus is a is the covenant
[54:11] and he
[54:13] tore him apart at calvary
[54:16] received his body up and i'm speaking
[54:19] uh uh right now i'm reading here so we
[54:22] could see
[54:24] what what what time we're living in or
[54:26] what we've been called up to
[54:29] it says receive that receive his body up
[54:32] and send the holy ghost back
[54:35] and when the resurrection come the same
[54:38] spirit that was in christ in jesus
[54:40] christ
[54:41] is the only thing that will raise this
[54:44] body up to meet to meet to go meet that
[54:49] one there
[54:52] i said what he's saying the holy spirit
[54:54] the same jesus that was in the same
[54:56] spirit that was in christ is the only
[54:59] thing that will raise this body up to go
[55:03] meet the one there it says that makes
[55:06] the that makes them a husband and wife
[55:09] what do i mean it says the bride is the
[55:12] covenant people
[55:15] unconditional he says
[55:17] god called you out of the world gave you
[55:20] the holy ghost the seed of abraham you
[55:23] are tonight with a blessed promise amen
[55:26] it says it says oh my it says my if you
[55:30] then if you are abraham's seed you have
[55:33] this promise in you
[55:36] not with you but in you
[55:39] it says you believe god regardless of
[55:42] what takes place the holy ghost makes
[55:46] you believe it anyhow
[55:48] oh my brother my sister
[55:50] the privilege we have is we have not
[55:53] made ourselves what we are tonight we
[55:55] have not given ourselves a claim of
[55:58] something that we are not but the word
[56:00] has brought us into the condition that
[56:02] we are in
[56:03] if we believe it's because god made us
[56:06] believers
[56:07] if we are gathered here tonight it's
[56:09] because god gathers us here tonight
[56:12] because if you take god out of it he
[56:14] becomes a man-made
[56:16] a situation
[56:18] and and the beauty of it is because we
[56:21] it's so easy i tell you this to look and
[56:24] see that it's god in motion who's doing
[56:27] everything that we are seeing around us
[56:29] how can we gather people from four
[56:31] corners of the world and put him in the
[56:33] same room how can he put something
[56:35] within each and every one of you that
[56:37] you will hear this word tonight and say
[56:39] amen to it how can you put it such
[56:41] beautiful in such a way that our hearts
[56:44] are angering for the same thing it's
[56:46] god's who's behind it
[56:49] and and it says the holy spirit makes
[56:52] you believe it
[56:54] it's not nobody coming and i said
[56:57] something or oh the i like the way you
[56:59] said it that's why i believe it has
[57:00] nothing to do with man
[57:02] man will bring you explanation and
[57:04] explanation will get you lost but god is
[57:07] bringing you his spirit he's bringing
[57:09] you revelation is quickening something
[57:12] within your heart when you hear the word
[57:14] and something identified to what you
[57:16] hear and you say i believe it
[57:19] oh i was thinking about it this
[57:21] afternoon i said we read about the boy
[57:23] who was looking in the mirror i tell you
[57:26] the chief wave offering has been for the
[57:28] bride someone who's looking into the
[57:30] mirror we looked at it and we saw him
[57:33] and says i desire that and the word came
[57:36] back and it says this is just the first
[57:38] one you are also coming into the same
[57:40] thing
[57:45] this word was not built so we can look
[57:48] and i want to stress this out because
[57:50] it's important because oftentimes we
[57:52] look and say um
[57:55] and i believe even our pastor touched it
[57:57] last sunday we look at the world the
[58:00] word of god in the standpoint of the
[58:02] human realm
[58:04] oh i desire to be within that oh i
[58:06] desire to be that i hear it this morning
[58:09] i hear tonight and there's something
[58:11] within you that's hungry and that's
[58:13] wonderful but there's also another side
[58:16] of it because i want us to to see both
[58:19] sides of it then it's it will help us
[58:21] when we reconcile both sides i want to
[58:24] say this the the bride's manifestation
[58:27] at the end time is part of god's promise
[58:31] of what he wanted to do not what you
[58:33] wanted
[58:35] not what you desired not what you cried
[58:38] for i'm talking about what god what the
[58:41] whole mystery of the bible was all about
[58:44] since the beginning of the world and i
[58:46] will read it here god had an eternal
[58:49] purpose but of adam called it one
[58:51] eternal purpose and the eternal purpose
[58:54] was not even jesus christ the eternal
[58:57] purpose christ came so he can help that
[59:00] the eternal purpose may come to pass and
[59:02] the eternal purpose that he would have a
[59:04] bride of his own choosing that he he
[59:07] will come and dwell within his people
[59:09] [Music]
[59:14] he said he created the old earth so he
[59:16] can have a bride i i i think this
[59:19] escapes our mind i know and i believe we
[59:22] get caught up within the things of life
[59:24] and everything and and it seems like we
[59:27] forget to see the bigger picture the
[59:29] bigger picture was that god wanted to be
[59:32] one with his creation
[59:34] god wanted to make his creation and he
[59:37] himself dwelt within his creation and
[59:40] christ the coming of christ was so that
[59:42] he can make a way after satan came and
[59:45] caused the fall within the garden was
[59:48] that god will come and make a way so he
[59:50] can bring his original plan to come to
[59:53] pass and therefore when we look at
[59:55] christ when he comes and he gave his
[59:57] life it was so that you and i can stand
[59:59] here tonight and say that i am here as
[1:00:04] the representation
[1:00:05] or the manifestation of what god desire
[1:00:09] to be in the end time
[1:00:13] it's not us saying oh i want to be like
[1:00:16] god i want to be like god no it's god
[1:00:18] sitting say i want to be a man i want to
[1:00:22] walk into a body i want to do this as a
[1:00:24] man i want to defeat the devil in the
[1:00:27] mountain in my inner my bride's body i
[1:00:30] want to complete this i want what he did
[1:00:32] in the garden i want to create another
[1:00:35] bride that will come in this time and
[1:00:37] this one will never fail
[1:00:46] and yet we are sitting and say oh god
[1:00:48] oh god i desire
[1:00:50] oh if we can reconcile the two
[1:00:53] it would help us understand and
[1:00:55] the only reason i'm desiring this is
[1:00:57] because
[1:00:58] you have desired this for me
[1:01:01] you have one you have called me to be
[1:01:03] this
[1:01:04] so he says
[1:01:06] he says now
[1:01:08] oh and and i i i guess i didn't give a
[1:01:11] title
[1:01:12] um
[1:01:13] so i i i just want to say this for a few
[1:01:15] moments
[1:01:17] i want to uh uh
[1:01:19] just say we we
[1:01:21] we we read and this is from the rising
[1:01:24] of the sun i'll just paraphrase it well
[1:01:27] we we know that he he talked about
[1:01:32] he he talked about the
[1:01:34] benefactors of his resurrection
[1:01:37] he talked about how
[1:01:39] the the we are benefactors of his
[1:01:41] resurrection
[1:01:43] in other words when he came and he died
[1:01:46] there was people that benefited from
[1:01:48] that resurrection
[1:01:49] and we are sitting here as benefactors
[1:01:52] as those that have benefited from his
[1:01:54] resurrection and i believe he says once
[1:01:56] at the resurrection because he ascends
[1:01:59] quickening power to quicken us from
[1:02:01] death unto life
[1:02:03] he's come and he's done that and now
[1:02:05] he's talking about what what that
[1:02:08] resurrection was and now don't also
[1:02:10] forget that he also said and i'm
[1:02:12] paraphrasing this that the rising of the
[1:02:15] sun
[1:02:16] we can look at it either from the
[1:02:18] natural the spiritual aspect and realize
[1:02:21] the the rising of the sun
[1:02:23] was the promise that was made that there
[1:02:25] would be life on earth
[1:02:27] the rising of the sun is directly
[1:02:30] connected to life
[1:02:32] if the sun doesn't rise there's not
[1:02:33] going to be life on earth
[1:02:35] the if the sun refuses to shine there's
[1:02:38] not going to be life on earth everything
[1:02:40] is gone and and but that's why
[1:02:43] christ was typing the natural sun to say
[1:02:46] that because he rose we shall rise also
[1:02:49] because he rose we were benefactors of
[1:02:52] that resurrection that we may receive
[1:02:54] something that we may receive the same
[1:02:56] life that raised him up that he could be
[1:02:58] the same life could be in us
[1:03:00] now he says this now in paragraph 94 of
[1:03:04] the rising of the sun it says
[1:03:05] and and as christ was the first one to
[1:03:09] rise
[1:03:11] from all the prophets
[1:03:13] and so forth
[1:03:15] although typed in many places he was the
[1:03:18] first fruit of those that slept
[1:03:21] it says in the bright coming of christ
[1:03:25] in the bride coming of christ
[1:03:28] coming out of the church there it says
[1:03:31] there will have to be a sheave wave
[1:03:34] again in the last day
[1:03:36] now
[1:03:37] don't lose track of this so there's a
[1:03:39] one rising of the sun that happened at
[1:03:41] pentecostal that we saw happen
[1:03:44] and we saw him come
[1:03:46] with the guarantee that there shall be
[1:03:48] life on earth with a guarantee that he's
[1:03:52] restoring back life but then he's
[1:03:54] promising another rising of the sun in
[1:03:57] the evening time it says there shall be
[1:03:59] one in the last day oh my
[1:04:01] he says waving of the sheave
[1:04:04] it says what was what was this what was
[1:04:07] the sheave the first one that came to
[1:04:10] maturity the first one that proved it
[1:04:14] was wheat that proved it was a sheaf
[1:04:18] he says hallelujah
[1:04:20] i'm sure you see what i'm talking about
[1:04:23] it was waved over the people and it says
[1:04:26] and the first time that they will come
[1:04:29] forth for the bright age for a
[1:04:31] resurrection out of the dark
[1:04:33] denominationalism
[1:04:36] will be a message now yes where i'm
[1:04:39] going will be a message that will that
[1:04:42] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:04:45] turned as has turned back again into a
[1:04:49] full power
[1:04:51] and being waved over the people by the
[1:04:54] same signs and wonders that he did back
[1:04:56] there
[1:04:57] now i want to and i just want to for a
[1:05:00] moment establish
[1:05:01] what is what what what this rising of
[1:05:04] the sun that is now the first rising of
[1:05:07] the sun when he came what was at
[1:05:09] pentecost we could say we could look the
[1:05:12] church was in its in its infancy so they
[1:05:15] came out of the upper room and they were
[1:05:17] restored with gifts and and all kinds of
[1:05:19] things and they went and they heal the
[1:05:21] sick and and everything and and they
[1:05:23] need all of that but i want you to see
[1:05:25] when he's talking about the rising of
[1:05:27] the sun in the evening time it's
[1:05:29] attaching it to the maturity and the
[1:05:32] full power to be restored so and and and
[1:05:35] he brings us back to what we know to be
[1:05:37] the redemption that redemption has to
[1:05:40] part we know that the first part of
[1:05:42] redemption was the paying of the price
[1:05:44] to show that what was required was paid
[1:05:47] and he came and he paid the price and
[1:05:49] therefore we could see life restore back
[1:05:52] into the church of the living god we can
[1:05:54] see that at pentecost but the rising of
[1:05:56] the sun in the evening time is the
[1:05:59] second part that comes for him to claim
[1:06:01] and return his full power in what
[1:06:04] belonged to him that he had already paid
[1:06:06] the price for and in this rising of the
[1:06:09] sun there is a call a call for a full
[1:06:12] power and maturity and is coming into a
[1:06:16] place where the church has now become
[1:06:18] his very manifestation back again into
[1:06:21] the people why because now when the when
[1:06:25] the rising of the sun is happening at
[1:06:26] the evening time it's not calling us for
[1:06:29] us to just uh uh uh jump up in spirit
[1:06:32] and speak in tongue no it's calling for
[1:06:35] a mature pride one that can come in into
[1:06:39] his image one that can be born of his
[1:06:41] bone and power of his power one who's
[1:06:44] who's got the same characteristic that
[1:06:46] jesus christ has and one who's been
[1:06:49] brought into a maturity and she has been
[1:06:52] given the power to speak the word and as
[1:06:55] a matter of fact the prophet said that
[1:06:56] the very word of god is given to her and
[1:06:59] it's within her
[1:07:03] oh let's not miss that because by
[1:07:06] looking at it oftentimes we look and we
[1:07:08] say oh god just wants me to have the
[1:07:11] holy ghost that's not enough that's not
[1:07:14] he just don't want you to get the new
[1:07:16] birth and stay right there no there's a
[1:07:18] maturity to be manifested in the end
[1:07:21] time and that's why i'm talking about i
[1:07:23] said it's very important we know what
[1:07:26] the identification in the end time is
[1:07:28] what are we being called to and what is
[1:07:30] it that god is trying to manifest at the
[1:07:32] end time and let me repeat it again this
[1:07:35] is not us trying to become like god this
[1:07:38] is god the promise that he made the god
[1:07:41] who was the god above us who made the
[1:07:44] whole creation the god whose fullness
[1:07:46] dwelled in jesus christ there was a
[1:07:49] promise that that same fullness will
[1:07:51] come and dwelt in the body not the body
[1:07:54] of jesus christ by the bride's body and
[1:07:57] do the same work that he did
[1:08:00] amen
[1:08:05] we're not called
[1:08:07] to be
[1:08:08] a beggar oh god and
[1:08:10] if you can only help me with the
[1:08:12] sickness and
[1:08:13] he's calling you for more than that
[1:08:17] oh god if you could just help me pass
[1:08:19] this trial he's calling you for more
[1:08:22] than that
[1:08:23] he himself
[1:08:25] is promising the end time that your body
[1:08:27] will be his body
[1:08:30] he himself he he and and i know people
[1:08:34] get offended when you say this he didn't
[1:08:36] finish his work at calvary because the
[1:08:38] work that was done at calvary was the
[1:08:40] paying of the price but there was a
[1:08:43] resurrection work that had to be done in
[1:08:45] the end time where he himself will come
[1:08:48] and dwell within his people
[1:08:52] that's why i read this i said let us be
[1:08:55] glad and rejoice my brother my sister
[1:08:58] the world is in the condition that it is
[1:09:01] because it was prophesied to be that way
[1:09:03] and the only hope that could be out
[1:09:05] there can only come from you
[1:09:11] when the scripture says when people will
[1:09:13] ask what is your hope what is it when
[1:09:15] everybody is panicking when everybody is
[1:09:17] looking and they're constantly talking
[1:09:19] about what they're going through oh you
[1:09:21] don't know what's happening there's
[1:09:22] inflation and there's no raise how am i
[1:09:25] going to pay this bill the gas price
[1:09:27] just went up and this just went up there
[1:09:29] has to be a people on earth that has the
[1:09:32] hope of the resurrection that can look
[1:09:34] at those people and say you don't have
[1:09:36] to put your hope in those things you
[1:09:38] don't have to worry about the gas price
[1:09:40] you don't have to worry about the
[1:09:41] inflation you don't have to worry about
[1:09:43] the walls why because there's another
[1:09:45] hope somewhere it's not built of the
[1:09:48] elements of this world that hope is that
[1:09:50] after this world is past that i have
[1:09:52] another body waiting for me
[1:10:01] that's our inheritance
[1:10:03] that's part of our
[1:10:05] mission if i could say that's part of
[1:10:08] what we've been called to
[1:10:10] we've been called to be the
[1:10:12] representative
[1:10:14] of the body of christ on earth
[1:10:17] to do the works the same works
[1:10:20] and i've said this and i'll say it
[1:10:23] we our minds
[1:10:25] and i think that's all right god is
[1:10:27] going to help us through it
[1:10:28] our minds
[1:10:30] us always struggle
[1:10:33] with the understanding of god within our
[1:10:36] flesh
[1:10:37] we can speak about god in creation and
[1:10:40] look at the waterfalls
[1:10:42] look at mountains
[1:10:44] look at the great creation stand up and
[1:10:47] look at the majestic sky
[1:10:49] and look at it and recognize i see god
[1:10:53] like the fisherman
[1:10:55] we can look at christ
[1:10:57] and see how he lay down his life and to
[1:11:00] see how he rose the dead and he healed
[1:11:03] the second and he done things and we
[1:11:06] look at it we say that was god
[1:11:09] but yet that same manifestation has been
[1:11:11] promised to you and you look at it you
[1:11:14] say it cannot be
[1:11:16] that's why i want to say this it's not
[1:11:18] you coming into it it's god pulling you
[1:11:21] into it it's god it's not your desire to
[1:11:25] be it it's god's desire to bring it to
[1:11:27] pass
[1:11:31] i hope you don't get stumbled by this
[1:11:33] but if adam says like that that he says
[1:11:36] that god is jesus he says he did more in
[1:11:38] my ministry that he did in his own
[1:11:40] ministry
[1:11:44] he did more in this ministry than he did
[1:11:47] in his own ministry why is trying to
[1:11:49] open up your eyes to show you it's not a
[1:11:52] diluted god it's not another version of
[1:11:55] god it's the same god
[1:11:57] same in power same in everything same in
[1:12:01] attributes same in all kinds of ways why
[1:12:04] because it's not about you it's about
[1:12:07] his plan of redemption and what he
[1:12:09] wanted to do in the end time
[1:12:19] he says
[1:12:21] now i want you to listen and it says
[1:12:28] it says
[1:12:30] but now
[1:12:32] speaking about christ
[1:12:34] and as i read this i want you to think
[1:12:35] about what i'm saying
[1:12:38] it's about the promise of his
[1:12:40] manifestation
[1:12:42] throughout the ages
[1:12:45] he says
[1:12:48] but now he is standing in the middle of
[1:12:50] his church
[1:12:52] of the church
[1:12:54] he says
[1:12:56] as he stand there revealing he is
[1:12:59] revealing who he is in the last age
[1:13:04] he called himself
[1:13:06] the author of the creation of god
[1:13:10] this is not it says this is another
[1:13:13] creation
[1:13:14] he has to be he says he has to do with
[1:13:18] his church
[1:13:20] this is a special designation of himself
[1:13:28] special not of you of himself
[1:13:31] he is the creator of that church
[1:13:35] the heavenly bridegroom
[1:13:38] created his own bride
[1:13:43] do we believe we were created
[1:13:47] and i'm saying this because i i believe
[1:13:50] we in such a time even as our pastor is
[1:13:52] bringing why are we going through these
[1:13:54] things
[1:13:55] why are we looking at it line by line
[1:13:58] and verse by verse and chapter by
[1:14:00] chapter why are we looking because it
[1:14:03] gives us an expectation of what we are
[1:14:06] supposed to walk into
[1:14:08] it gives us the expectation of what we
[1:14:10] ought to be doing or what we ought to be
[1:14:12] manifesting for the time he didn't call
[1:14:15] us so we could just say there's a bride
[1:14:17] praise god there's a bride no he called
[1:14:20] us because there's one place he he calls
[1:14:22] us out and he says let us be like joshua
[1:14:25] and caleb in other words he's setting
[1:14:28] the promise before you and he's wanting
[1:14:30] for you and i to be like joshua and
[1:14:32] caleb and say this is my portion for the
[1:14:35] age that i'm living in therefore i am
[1:14:37] going to claim what belongs to me this
[1:14:40] was i i and i i want to say this it
[1:14:43] doesn't matter if you understand it or
[1:14:45] not it's not about understanding god
[1:14:48] gives the understanding when he wants to
[1:14:50] god gives the revelation when he wants
[1:14:52] to but all i care about is what it is
[1:14:55] say for my age and i will keep reading
[1:14:57] it until it brings forth the revelation
[1:14:59] for me to understand what he said
[1:15:02] and he's so marvelous because he keeps
[1:15:04] revealing it every time every time we
[1:15:06] read it we see something that we've
[1:15:08] never seen before why is he doing it
[1:15:10] it's walking you step by step into the
[1:15:13] change of your body
[1:15:20] it's god's doing it's not our doing
[1:15:23] it's god's promise it's not our promise
[1:15:26] it's him doing these things
[1:15:28] so he says
[1:15:30] the heavenly bride groom created his own
[1:15:32] bride
[1:15:33] as the spirit of god he says
[1:15:36] he came down and created a virgin mary
[1:15:39] the cell from which his body was made
[1:15:42] he says i want to repeat that
[1:15:45] he created the very cell the the very
[1:15:48] cell
[1:15:49] in the womb of mary
[1:15:52] for the body
[1:15:53] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[1:15:56] simply give life to a human over
[1:15:59] supply by mary
[1:16:02] that would have been sinful making
[1:16:04] sinful mankind
[1:16:07] producing a body
[1:16:09] it says that would have not produced the
[1:16:11] last adam
[1:16:13] oh
[1:16:14] why because the last adam was a
[1:16:17] quickening power
[1:16:18] he was not a he was not a living spirit
[1:16:21] like the first one the first one was a
[1:16:24] living spirit but this one was to dare
[1:16:26] to bring forth back to life to bring
[1:16:29] adam back to life the first adam came in
[1:16:31] the fall but the second adam was the
[1:16:34] very life that would come within his
[1:16:36] lungs
[1:16:38] he says
[1:16:42] the last adam of him was said lo a body
[1:16:46] has not prepared it has now father
[1:16:49] prepared for me it said not me not he
[1:16:52] said god not mary provided that body
[1:16:56] mary was the human incubator and she
[1:16:59] carried that holy child and brought him
[1:17:02] to birth
[1:17:03] it was a god man
[1:17:06] he was he he says he was the son of god
[1:17:10] he was the new creation
[1:17:12] man and god made and joined he was the
[1:17:16] first of a new of this new creek new
[1:17:19] race
[1:17:20] he says he is the head of a new race
[1:17:26] the head of a new race
[1:17:28] so
[1:17:30] if he is the head of a new race how is
[1:17:33] this other race coming from how is it
[1:17:35] coming it would come the same way as the
[1:17:38] head came what what was that it was by
[1:17:41] god's word
[1:17:42] not had nothing to do with women with
[1:17:44] mary having nothing to do with you the
[1:17:47] same way didn't have anything to do with
[1:17:49] mary the same way it has nothing to do
[1:17:50] with you it was god by the by the
[1:17:54] promise that he made a new body and stop
[1:17:56] preparing me he brought that body so
[1:17:58] that the spirit of jesus can come and
[1:18:00] dwell and the same way with the bride he
[1:18:03] spoke in his word and his word is
[1:18:05] producing the very body that the spirit
[1:18:08] will come and dwell
[1:18:13] he says
[1:18:14] this new creation is not the old made
[1:18:16] over
[1:18:18] or it could not be called a new creation
[1:18:21] this is this is this is exactly what it
[1:18:24] says
[1:18:25] it is new creation
[1:18:29] now i want to skip for a little bit so i
[1:18:31] can go and it says
[1:18:32] this is the true revelation of god
[1:18:35] this was his purpose this was his
[1:18:38] purpose this purpose took form to
[1:18:40] relaxing
[1:18:41] that is why he could look right down to
[1:18:45] the last age
[1:18:47] when all would be over and seen and see
[1:18:50] him see himself still in the midst of
[1:18:54] his church
[1:18:58] the oil in the candle sticker was him
[1:19:01] it's always been his life
[1:19:03] it's his life in christ it's his life in
[1:19:06] the messengers that's why the prophet
[1:19:08] tells us if we can't see jesus christ in
[1:19:10] every scripture go read it back again
[1:19:12] why because it's always a hymn if we if
[1:19:15] we put ourselves out there then we run
[1:19:17] as we run ourselves in trouble but if we
[1:19:20] can put him there then we understand
[1:19:22] it's him in us doing the work
[1:19:25] he says
[1:19:27] in the last day in the midst of his
[1:19:29] church as the author of this new
[1:19:31] creation his sovereign power brought
[1:19:33] this to pass by his own
[1:19:36] decree
[1:19:39] he elected the members of this new
[1:19:42] creation
[1:19:45] you are elected to be part of the new
[1:19:48] creation otherwise you wouldn't have
[1:19:50] been.
[1:19:55] and i say this let's not stumble over
[1:19:57] simplicity you know and i i it's very
[1:20:00] important when when it comes to the word
[1:20:03] of god it's very important we always
[1:20:05] take it down back to the basics of what
[1:20:07] he's trying to tell us when we get it
[1:20:10] complicated that's when we don't know is
[1:20:12] it him is it me is it me and him or is
[1:20:14] it me him and us and everything oh i
[1:20:17] tell you you'll go crazy trying to
[1:20:19] figure out the relationship he's our
[1:20:21] father he is we are his sons we are his
[1:20:24] bride we are his servant we are all
[1:20:27] those things
[1:20:29] but why is he calling us the bride and
[1:20:31] the entire because now he's elevating us
[1:20:34] from not just a servant not just a son
[1:20:37] he's bringing out even to be co-equal
[1:20:39] with him so we can reign with him why
[1:20:42] he's bringing us into a level of power
[1:20:44] that we never had before
[1:20:46] and in doing so it's bringing us into
[1:20:48] his own character that we made this
[1:20:50] place on character
[1:20:54] i want to say this that's why it's so
[1:20:56] important
[1:20:57] every time we project we project him
[1:21:00] he didn't call us to project our own
[1:21:02] mind he called us to project him when we
[1:21:05] project him we are successful when we
[1:21:07] project our own mind we we
[1:21:09] we mess it up
[1:21:11] why because it's always him
[1:21:14] it's always him
[1:21:16] and he said
[1:21:18] that
[1:21:19] this
[1:21:20] church in the end time
[1:21:22] will produce another book of acts
[1:21:25] now it's not the book of acts just so we
[1:21:28] can have the works
[1:21:29] but it's the book of acts
[1:21:31] to have his nature
[1:21:33] his character
[1:21:35] and his word
[1:21:36] to be equal exactly like he is so when
[1:21:40] we speak it's him speaking and not us
[1:21:45] so he says
[1:21:46] now listen as it says
[1:21:48] i i wrote it down here on top as a title
[1:21:51] the most important thing
[1:21:57] he says
[1:21:58] i believe in paradox yes sir
[1:22:01] i believe i believe in them with all my
[1:22:03] heart
[1:22:04] it says it was a paradox when all those
[1:22:06] smart man
[1:22:08] that was in the world and god put the
[1:22:11] key of the kingdom in the hand of one
[1:22:13] that was considered an ignorant and
[1:22:15] unlearned
[1:22:17] think about that
[1:22:20] he says that's right
[1:22:22] one of the smartest men in the world in
[1:22:25] that day was caiaphasis
[1:22:28] the high priest another was the emperor
[1:22:31] the king
[1:22:32] and the great men on the earth like king
[1:22:34] like presidents and so forth and this
[1:22:36] great man it says and and what's the
[1:22:40] most important thing in the world
[1:22:43] it says
[1:22:45] is
[1:22:45] god's church
[1:22:49] god made the earth
[1:22:52] he made it
[1:22:53] for a purpose
[1:22:55] to take a church out of it
[1:22:58] a bride
[1:22:59] and that's the most important job
[1:23:02] in the world
[1:23:07] oh my
[1:23:10] you know yeah we are and
[1:23:12] we take pride i'm a farmer
[1:23:15] i'm an engineer you know
[1:23:17] i'm a uh uh
[1:23:19] uh a scientist and i'm this and you know
[1:23:22] what are you i'm this you know we take
[1:23:24] pride in it and yet he's saying the most
[1:23:27] important thing is
[1:23:29] that you are his church
[1:23:31] you are his building
[1:23:32] or if we can put that before everything
[1:23:35] else that we do
[1:23:36] if for the when we look at ourselves the
[1:23:39] very when we look at the consideration
[1:23:42] we have for our own self if we can put
[1:23:44] that consideration above all else
[1:23:47] to begin with i miss bride
[1:23:49] to begin with i miss church to begin
[1:23:51] with i've been called for his
[1:23:54] manifestation if we can only understand
[1:23:56] what god is wanting out of us if we can
[1:23:59] understand what identification is giving
[1:24:01] us not the identification we are giving
[1:24:04] ourselves but the identification that he
[1:24:06] is giving us
[1:24:09] he says
[1:24:12] now
[1:24:14] if god said
[1:24:16] if god said
[1:24:18] multiply to his bride and he says to
[1:24:21] adam he says to adam and replenish the
[1:24:23] earth and multiply and replenish the
[1:24:25] earth and and and that was god's
[1:24:27] commission and she would have done it
[1:24:29] it says and he would and he would have
[1:24:32] but mixing themselves together what
[1:24:34] happened he says when adam got ready to
[1:24:37] come to her she was already a mother
[1:24:41] he says see what i mean he says now the
[1:24:45] same thing happened
[1:24:46] to christ's church christ bride now we
[1:24:50] are going back farther than done that in
[1:24:53] a minute it says now notice
[1:24:56] is this right
[1:24:58] it says notice in this bride
[1:25:00] what did she what did she what did she
[1:25:03] do then
[1:25:04] his first child came forth it was a
[1:25:07] bastard child and he was full of death
[1:25:10] and caused death ev he says everyone
[1:25:13] since then is dead everything since then
[1:25:15] is death and now you see he had sex
[1:25:18] that's why he's dying it wasn't it says
[1:25:21] if it wasn't sex it says when god give
[1:25:24] commission which cannot perish
[1:25:28] think about it now
[1:25:31] they failed to bring forth the
[1:25:32] commission
[1:25:34] but god had already spoken his word and
[1:25:36] his word could not go down and perish
[1:25:40] he says
[1:25:42] god's word is eternal
[1:25:45] he cannot fail
[1:25:47] when he said multiply and replenish the
[1:25:49] earth
[1:25:50] that was god's eternal purpose
[1:25:53] to carry that out you cannot it cannot
[1:25:56] die because it's it's his word
[1:25:59] you have to live it says if that child
[1:26:03] had been brought forth right
[1:26:05] it had been brought forth no death but
[1:26:08] she couldn't wait he says
[1:26:11] that's what the matter today
[1:26:13] you want some kind of phony makeup and
[1:26:16] screaming and jumping and speaking in
[1:26:18] tongues on something instead of waiting
[1:26:21] on the real word of god to bring
[1:26:24] manifest to
[1:26:26] to to the will of the real word of god
[1:26:29] to be made manifest through the bride
[1:26:33] oh i thought about that i said he he
[1:26:35] wants us to wait on the word he doesn't
[1:26:38] want us to run forth and say oh i got it
[1:26:41] and it's happening all this is happening
[1:26:43] over here oh that's there he's saying
[1:26:45] that i have given you my word and my
[1:26:48] word cannot go to the ground i have
[1:26:50] given you my promise and it will come to
[1:26:52] pass so instead of us growing and
[1:26:54] jumping and doing all of that is saying
[1:26:57] you come back and you stay with the word
[1:26:59] you stay with what i said i will come to
[1:27:01] bring it in the season that i desire to
[1:27:03] bring it oh i i began to think about the
[1:27:06] disciples on the day of pentecost oh
[1:27:09] i'll tell you they didn't go one around
[1:27:10] and everything they went and stayed with
[1:27:12] what was given to them they began to
[1:27:15] recite the promise that he gave them
[1:27:16] they began to speak one another about
[1:27:18] the promise you know he said we should
[1:27:20] gather here you know he told us he will
[1:27:22] send his spirit you know he said when he
[1:27:25] after the third day he will raise again
[1:27:27] we know he said this it was true you
[1:27:29] know he told that about that and that
[1:27:31] came to pass you know we have the
[1:27:32] scriptures we've seen him every time
[1:27:35] they touched him every time they did
[1:27:36] something we are able to track it right
[1:27:39] back into the word of god it was the
[1:27:40] fulfillment of all the prophecy that was
[1:27:42] written about him oh by the time they
[1:27:44] put all of that together the promise
[1:27:46] come to pass within them
[1:27:50] it wasn't them jumping around and just
[1:27:53] shout no they were focused on what was
[1:27:55] given to them what is the word what is
[1:27:57] the promise of my time what is said that
[1:28:00] i'm going to be what is it that he talks
[1:28:02] and about this bride oh i tell you the
[1:28:04] identification of the bride is no
[1:28:06] different than that it's when we focus
[1:28:08] and we know
[1:28:10] what he has said
[1:28:12] he will bring forth the revelation of it
[1:28:16] because remember
[1:28:18] it's from quickening
[1:28:20] to quickening
[1:28:21] to quickening to quickening
[1:28:25] it's not once and done
[1:28:28] he is walking with you
[1:28:31] every step of the way
[1:28:32] just like the disciples on the road to
[1:28:34] emmaus remember he said that was a
[1:28:37] prophecy that would come and they were
[1:28:39] walking and and for some reason he says
[1:28:42] what are you guys what is it that you're
[1:28:43] talking about what are you sad about he
[1:28:46] said you don't know
[1:28:47] we just received
[1:28:49] a man we thought it was him who was
[1:28:51] going to deliver
[1:28:52] and and restore the kingdom of israel
[1:28:55] and yet they took him and they killed
[1:28:57] him and everything you don't know about
[1:28:59] this event
[1:29:00] he said what things
[1:29:03] they threw out the hearts and the
[1:29:05] misunderstanding about all of that and
[1:29:07] everything and it says all full and slow
[1:29:10] of heart to understand the things that
[1:29:12] were spoken what is that scripture says
[1:29:14] he began to expound upon them one verse
[1:29:17] by person they would ask questions and
[1:29:19] will answer that's what he's doing he's
[1:29:21] answering all your questions he's
[1:29:23] revealing himself more and more i say
[1:29:26] this we know this message we we we have
[1:29:28] more revelation today than we had a year
[1:29:31] ago
[1:29:32] we have more revelation than we did a
[1:29:34] week ago why because it's him expounding
[1:29:36] on the things that he promised showing
[1:29:39] verse by verse showing line by line
[1:29:41] showing what is he doing it's opening
[1:29:43] the way he's leading you it's leading
[1:29:45] you what is he leading you to to himself
[1:29:51] to himself
[1:29:54] the bride of christ
[1:29:56] is not touched by any man
[1:29:59] the bride of christ is not to be touched
[1:30:02] by any man
[1:30:04] if she receives
[1:30:06] her food her understanding her
[1:30:09] revelation from him
[1:30:12] from the word the promised word that is
[1:30:14] given
[1:30:22] if the musician could comment
[1:30:28] looks like i did what i always do
[1:30:31] he says
[1:30:42] let us
[1:30:43] he he reads this it says
[1:30:46] and i know you know the quote very well
[1:30:48] where it speaks about the harmony that
[1:30:50] existed between
[1:30:52] the father and the son
[1:30:55] so he speaks about the harmony that
[1:30:57] existed between the father and son
[1:30:59] and then he says that same harmony has
[1:31:01] to exist between
[1:31:03] christ and his bride
[1:31:05] the same
[1:31:07] and now listen to this this is where i
[1:31:09] said
[1:31:11] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[1:31:13] christ to know
[1:31:15] what he wants done with the word
[1:31:17] she does it in his name
[1:31:20] she has that said the lord
[1:31:22] it says now then it is dramatized so the
[1:31:26] holy spirit waters it and grows it
[1:31:29] that's the word
[1:31:31] listen to what he says in the next
[1:31:32] paragraph he says
[1:31:36] it says
[1:31:37] they don't they only do his will amen i
[1:31:40] believe that
[1:31:43] one it says no one can persuade them
[1:31:45] differently
[1:31:47] they have thy say of the lord and they
[1:31:49] keep still
[1:31:52] then
[1:31:53] they will do
[1:31:55] the works of god
[1:31:58] for it is
[1:31:59] himself
[1:32:02] in them
[1:32:08] it is himself
[1:32:10] in them
[1:32:13] how was he in christ
[1:32:15] it's by promise
[1:32:18] in fact i believe the prophet said
[1:32:19] someplace that jesus was a predestinated
[1:32:22] creature of time
[1:32:25] he comes and he speaks the word the
[1:32:27] vessel comes and he comes and dwells in
[1:32:30] the vessel
[1:32:32] no different from the bride he speak the
[1:32:35] word
[1:32:36] we come and he comes and he dwells in
[1:32:38] the bride in paragraph 142 for one one
[1:32:42] 4 22 he says now let us stand like
[1:32:45] joshua and caleb
[1:32:48] now watch close this is going to have a
[1:32:50] spiritual background it says now let us
[1:32:53] stand like caleb and joshua as we stand
[1:32:56] as we see the promised land coming
[1:32:59] in sight it's near the time
[1:33:02] to be given
[1:33:04] joshua in hebrew means savior
[1:33:07] to promise the end time leader to take
[1:33:10] the church over caleb represented the
[1:33:12] true believer who stayed with joshua
[1:33:14] god's god started israel as a virgin
[1:33:18] with his word but they wanted something
[1:33:20] different so
[1:33:22] the last day church
[1:33:25] let's not go for anything different
[1:33:29] it was the promise that god gave it was
[1:33:32] the promise that they heard through the
[1:33:33] mouth of joshua
[1:33:35] that brought them past
[1:33:38] they came and they crossed
[1:33:40] not just across the red sea with moses
[1:33:42] but the cross they came and crossed
[1:33:44] jordan
[1:33:45] with joshua so they can get into the
[1:33:47] promised land
[1:33:50] and i say let us be glad and rejoice why
[1:33:52] because we have been given the word to
[1:33:55] make ourselves ready
[1:33:58] he spoke about those versions i didn't
[1:34:00] get there but
[1:34:01] you look at it what happened
[1:34:04] they came and they heard the same word
[1:34:08] they listened to the same word and
[1:34:10] everything
[1:34:11] but while the word was going forth there
[1:34:13] was a group that was actually making
[1:34:14] themselves ready but the other group was
[1:34:17] not
[1:34:19] they didn't seek for the oil while there
[1:34:21] was time for them to get the oil
[1:34:25] they slumber and sleep and then when
[1:34:27] they woke up when they cry came it was
[1:34:29] no more time to go and look for the oil
[1:34:34] so we could say oh god
[1:34:36] as this promises are coming and i can
[1:34:38] see one and i can see one and you can
[1:34:40] give me let me get the all that i need
[1:34:43] oh god
[1:34:44] fill me up with all that i need to have
[1:34:46] let me walk in this promise i don't
[1:34:48] desire anything i don't desire the world
[1:34:51] i desire the word of god i desire to see
[1:34:54] the manifestation what was spoken about
[1:34:57] this age what was spoken of the bride
[1:35:00] the resurrection in the end time i want
[1:35:02] to see it within my body why because i
[1:35:04] know you promised that's what you want
[1:35:06] to do
[1:35:07] let's all stand tonight
[1:35:12] it's not us trying to be like him
[1:35:16] it's him
[1:35:18] coming down
[1:35:20] wanting to use your flesh
[1:35:22] for the promise that he made for the
[1:35:24] manifestation of the end time
[1:35:27] oh if we can only walk another no i have
[1:35:30] i have been given a promise and that's
[1:35:33] what i'm walking in let's just bow heads

[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:43:05] amen that was wonderful word tonight
[1:43:09] and something to look forward to
[1:43:12] if he proved that every step of the way
[1:43:14] until today will stops them from proving
[1:43:16] it now
[1:43:18] it's it's a prophecy amen
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:30] that certainly was beautiful wasn't it
[1:43:33] amen it's not us trying to be like god
[1:43:37] it's god trying to get in us
[1:43:41] and aren't you glad he predestinated it
[1:43:44] because he'll supply the grace
[1:43:47] the mercy
[1:43:48] the correction
[1:43:50] the judgment to bring it to pass
[1:43:55] you know i just thought
[1:43:57] uh
[1:43:59] brother stephen that was amazing it
[1:44:01] matched just exactly with what we sat in
[1:44:04] fellowship with
[1:44:06] we're at the men's breakfast
[1:44:08] and i really encourage you brothers if
[1:44:10] you can get out to that men's breakfast
[1:44:12] don't miss it
[1:44:14] but we all were there and we just
[1:44:17] finally
[1:44:18] matthew just finally set out he said you
[1:44:20] know when you really look at it it's a
[1:44:23] setup
[1:44:26] we're trapped
[1:44:29] into god's will
[1:44:31] because there's one thing god can't do
[1:44:34] and that's lie
[1:44:36] so if in his mind he said you're going
[1:44:38] to be part of my bride
[1:44:40] you ma it's hard to kick against the
[1:44:42] prick
[1:44:44] but he don't fail
[1:44:46] amen i was inspired by that i just
[1:44:48] thought that was just fantastic
[1:44:50] preaching there's so many statements
[1:44:53] that he made i'm gonna ask him for his
[1:44:55] notes because
[1:44:57] i just
[1:44:59] i just love
[1:45:00] that this evening
[1:45:02] hey amen i i trust there's uh
[1:45:06] quite a few people watching online i
[1:45:08] don't know
[1:45:09] i know it's hard for people now because
[1:45:13] gas is expensive and you
[1:45:15] you come a long
[1:45:17] way and
[1:45:19] and it costs 70 80 dollars now to fill
[1:45:22] your tank
[1:45:23] but i like what brother orlando said he
[1:45:26] said i ain't going to waste my gas money
[1:45:28] i'm going to come to church and get
[1:45:29] something from god
[1:45:31] amen so we just keep that attitude i
[1:45:33] think god will richly bless us and
[1:45:38] let us grow in the lord so once again as
[1:45:41] we bow our heads if you have a request
[1:45:44] that you'd like to
[1:45:45] lift your hand to the lord you say lord
[1:45:48] i
[1:45:48] i heard the message tonight and
[1:45:52] lord i put too much emphasis on my
[1:45:55] faults
[1:45:57] i've spent too much time looking at my
[1:45:59] failures
[1:46:01] lord and the only way to overcome is by
[1:46:04] your word
[1:46:06] and lord so i'm going to put my eyes on
[1:46:08] what you said about me
[1:46:11] what you promised that you wanted to do
[1:46:14] in this last day
[1:46:16] through me
[1:46:17] and i'm going to look at that lord and
[1:46:19] that's going to be my
[1:46:21] strength to overcome
[1:46:24] is your word and what that you've spoken
[1:46:27] and what that you've said
[1:46:29] is going to transpire
[1:46:32] father i'd ask that you would change
[1:46:35] my mental approach
[1:46:37] that you would change my
[1:46:39] my mental attitude
[1:46:42] father with the right mental attitude it
[1:46:44] brings every promise to god the path
[1:46:49] and lord i ask you that
[1:46:52] you would help me only let your word
[1:46:55] affect my atmosphere
[1:46:57] lord i have my hand lifted up
[1:47:00] father i also have loved ones that are
[1:47:03] in need and
[1:47:06] father there's those that are in
[1:47:09] financial trouble
[1:47:11] lord and they're lifting their hands
[1:47:14] father because there's no need that
[1:47:17] we have that you don't already know
[1:47:20] but father we're turning it to you and
[1:47:23] casting our cares upon you
[1:47:26] father so when you answer our prayers we
[1:47:29] can have fellowship
[1:47:31] and testimony with you
[1:47:34] so father
[1:47:35] look upon every heart
[1:47:37] that's here this evening
[1:47:40] with their hand raised
[1:47:42] with their requests laid at your feet
[1:47:45] father as we
[1:47:48] stand here before your throne giving you
[1:47:50] praise
[1:47:52] and lord we ask that you grant these
[1:47:55] lord and we'll testify of your goodness
[1:47:59] we'll tell the world of your mercy
[1:48:03] lord will speak of the power by which
[1:48:06] you delivered us
[1:48:08] father the grace and love which you
[1:48:11] answered
[1:48:12] our requests
[1:48:13] will give you the glory you deserve
