something that's going to bring us a lot closer to him as we're still standing let's take our Bibles in the uh book of uh the second Kings uh uh chapter 5 Second Kings chapter 5 we'll start from the first verse second Kings chapter 5 the Bible says okay now non captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he had also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leopard and the Syrian had gone out of the company and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on on neon's wife and she said unto her mistress would he said would God my Lord where with the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him from his leprosy and and one went in and told his Lord saying dust and dust said the maid of this the land of Israel and the kings of Syria said to go uh to go and go and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel and he departed and took with them 10 Talons of silver and six uh thousand pieces of gold and 10 changes of rmen and he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying now when this letter is come unto thee behold I have therewith sent nonon my servant to thee that thou mayth recover him from his leprosy came to pass that when the king of Israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am I God to kill and make alive that this man do send me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider I pray you and see how he six quel against me [Music] [Music] and it was so when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rented his clothes that he had sent the king saying he has sent to the king saying wherefore H has thou rent thy clothes closeth let him come to me and and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel and nonon came with his horses and with his Chariot and stood at the door of the House of Elijah and Elisha sent a message unto him saying go and wash in Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou sh be clean but nonon was rough and went away and said behold I thought that he would surely come out to meet to me um and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover and recover the leper [Music] the not not abana and and PARTA rivers of Damascus better than all the Waters of Israel it says may I not wash in them be clean so he turned and went away in RA in a rage and his servant came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had beat thee to do great things would wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he said to thee wash and be clean [Music] [Music] then when he down and dipped him himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the Flesh of a little child and he was clean uh let's also turn our Bibles in the book of hoseah uh chapter [Music] 12 we'll read uh one chter 12 we read one verse verse 13 and by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and by a prophet Israel was pres is was Israel and by a prophet was he preserved Lord Jesus your word has been read you're the only one who can give life to the word that was pronounced may you come to our our help in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen have your seats may the Lord bless you tonight I believe the Lord has been good to each and every one of us uh me particularly this week the Lord has been good to me last Wednesday I was not feeling well at I had pains everywhere every time I stood up I was I was dizzy I stayed up the for the most for the a big part of the day I was laying down and as the hour of service was coming near as the devil does with many of us he said well but God knows that you are sick and even you have Advantage you can just stream the service why why why are you going to force yourself to go to church you may fall while trying to go I answered him in my heart I said it's in the house of it's the healing is in the house of God I'm going to go I came it was a little hard brother Chris even prayed for me on the way when I was coming in and when I came brother end preach such a marvelous service on invitation and it was an invitation for my healing I received my healing the Lord had brought me made me well so the Thursday morning when I woke up my little daughter came to me Daddy he said Daddy this God e you since yesterday did God heal you since yesterday has God healed you since yesterday I said yes God healed me and now I feel a lot better the Lord has been good to us I bless the Lord for that and this morning I was out till like around 2: a.m. this 2:30 a.m. this morning trying to find inspiration and by the time I went to sleep it was around 3:00 a.m. in the morning as I was sleeping I I I I dreamed about a brother who passed away and my a voice told me that pray for this brother so he could be resurrected and I was really praying sincerely my wife woke me up he said what's going on I said I was praying for a brother for his resurrection I said because I saw in your sleep you were talking and talking I said well maybe God will allow it one day but I know that we serve a powerful God uh from the scripture we've read I'm going to uh title my little sermon tonight your testimony will never be forgotten your testimony will never be forgotten you know every day in our lives every step that we make in reality is buil off a testimony we are impacting someone in our lives we can impact someone whether be positive or negatively but as Christians [Music] God has G us gives us the ability to impact people positively Our Testimony can be verbal we could testify something to somebody but the greatest testimony that we could have is our lives is is what we are is The Way We Walk tells about a story uh there was a a Sunday school [Music] superintendent and she was uh giving to kids giving them different characteristics of Jesus he said there was a man who could have a lot of power but who was humble you could you could curse curse at him but he would not answer when you did wrong to him he would answer with good he loved everybody he was only doing good she describe and describe he asked the kids do you know anyone one like that one of the kids lift up his hand he it's my neighbor he leaves right right next to us why because there was a Christian Living next to them so the kids was noticing that in this neighbor they were characteristics of Jesus Christ that's the story The look at the story we just read and most of the time when we speak about this part portion of the scripture we often time bring up non but what I would like to bring most is this little Maid Israelite maid look at this young girl who was brought in in captivity who she found herself in a pagan country in the middle of a place where they didn't practice anything that the Israelite did in in other word in an environment where there was not the word of God Amen but this young maid she she knew that in Israel that there was a god there was a prophet she had a testimony that the god of Israel was a real God and it was a a a a a real God imposs she knew that there was nothing impossible to this God she had proof she had testimonies that she knew that the god of Israel was capable or able to heal nonon of his leprosy she didn't start to reason to say that maybe if I tell him this that if he goes to Israel maybe he's not going to be healed what is he going to think about the God of Israel or what is he going to do to me that was not her problem what she knows that God is real God send a message with all the power of God that every all that you have to say is that in this message there's a prophet that in this message there's a word that in this message there's healing that with whatever with what you have that if you can only come into the message message God will bring the solution many times we get in a in a a place of comfort we we have this impression that God is limited that is not the god of of of certain things that the God is is not the god of certain people and he not the god of the others he made a promise that whosoever believe and that whosoever will be baptized will be saved and these signs and wonders will follow them that believe it's not the signs that will follow the preachers or a group of Believers but all those that believe they have to believe that they believed in the god of the impossible who has no limit and sometimes our comfort is limiting us we're talking with brother Billy back there and old testimony came to me I just believed the message uh not not not too long and my dad didn't want me to go to message churches perhaps many of the young ones will not know in Africa we had uh uh this machine the tap tap riter don't and as you type it so that that that the thing on top was moving and when you get to the the end of the page you have to push the whole thing back and that's how it function I was took the machine and I was typing this uh uh hym uh uh close to D and as I got to the middle I was at the end of the page so I brought back the top so it will start again so it looks like there was this like a a string or something that was broken the the the the top was not coming back anymore so when I bring it and it just slides back every time I bring it back it just slides I said oh I'm in trouble because when my dad will come and because I was typing a a h it's going to be hard so I just took a cloth and I covered it I I went to my knees I I started praying over the machine I said Lord you know I am trying to type a himym it's it's to worship you and look at what happen I don't know how to fix it I'm going to try to go find someone who can repair it and help me find someone who can fix it I went out it was around 11: I went all the way out till like 5:00 p.m. I couldn't find anybody who could repair it so I come back home so I said okay I'm going to go verify again the machine before I know the trouble is at the door you tissu so I take out the the T piece of tissue I covered it with the machine is back to normal I type and I type I I push it back it was back to normal I didn't know who fixed the machine the I don't know what happened while it's gone but all I know that the machine came back to normal C tape and back then we we used to have what what we call tapes C Machine and it was those with a string that you will put in the radio and place pray three days later the the the the the the the radio stopped working so I said to myself well the same God who did something three days ago he's he's capable of fixing this radio I took the radio I prayed I tried it didn't work the next day I tried it again it didn't work two days later there was a brother who came to visit me and as we were uh communing or having Fellowship I said oh you know my radio is not working but I wish I it was working I could have play tape so we can listen he looked at me and says well I fix radios he said bring it he fixed it and we prayed the tape we started listening to the tap it was God in that time the first time I didn't know how he fixed the the typewriter but the second time he sent someone who can fix it and God is not answering according to the way we want him to answer but all that we know for sure is when we ask with by faith he will answer how he's going to answer it's none of none of our business but all that I have to be certain of that he will answer look at NE after receiving this great testimony my prayer is that tonight that each one each and every one of us that we can be like this little maid in the house where we go even if we encounter somebody who's in the worst sin possible even when you see him you look at him you say this is certainly Satan incarnated that we know that will be like this little Maid of Israel that in Israel in the message there's a God who has the power of transformation who can take you in the states that you are in and make you the most purest Christian there is the most powerful chrisan that there is God GES gave us a message and it's not how we want it but it's what God said when he said it himself says our problem it's not is he going to believe or you're not going to believe is God going to change him or not going to change him is God going to heal him or is God not going to heal him he said what we do is we throw the net rest the rest it's God himself that brings it to pass and God helps us may God help us look at this young man we don't know her name if was still alive I was probably going to pray that may brother Bram give us her name because what would have been able to look and say her name was but he's already gone but the testimony of that little young girl will never be forgotten says in uh time tested Memorial of God uh paragraph 80 but the Living Word of God still remain just the same and just as valuable that's a memorial so I say today Brothers the things that you do the words that you say how you treat your neighbor and what you you do about Christ will be an everlasting Memorial you might have a fine a fine home to live to your children you might be working for some livelihood to live to your children but I would rather leave them the word of God than anything else those houses will vanish that's perfectly all right that's good I have nothing against it but don't do those minor thing in and leaving the great thing [Music] undone because the word will the house will perish and the people will perish with it but the word of God will raise them up in the last day and give them Immortal Eternal and Immortal Life again and now in order to make an estate like this God's Eternal Word it's by God's Eternal Word only God's word that he has to bring us to have the testimony that would remain forever God did great things in this message God certainly has done a lot great things in in in some of our lives like brother Billy was saying this morning most time we go back in the comfort that if we really want to be in church every Sunday every Wednesday we can ask to God he may not answer today but if we are sincere and if we have faith from the bottom of our heart we really want to be there God will will honor our faith many times we we it becomes a habit you know already the devil has placed in US forgive me I call it the devil because I believe anything that stops us from going into the house of God it can only be the devil uh he sometimes the devil places us here in the United States oh there are bills to pay if you don't work you won't be able to if this happen that's going to happen but our God is Limitless John sh sh but talks about John charrot oh he he was breaking bricks for 25 cents it was hard for him to make it he he he saved a little he saved money and he bought a little house and one day there was a an evangelist who came by and God told him he says give your house to this uh evangelist he went and told his wife God told me you know you know sometimes if you don't have Grace you know when tell your wife he's going to ask you how did God tell [Laughter] you they said well if God told you we have no choice uh they they gave they gave away their home they went and and negotiated and found a place to live in a in a woman's and this woman noticed that John shot was reading his Bible regularly and that he was a real Christ Christian honest man one day uh she he WS up he said that God made it God placed in my heart to to lend you a certain sum of money so you can start business it said well if you give me I won't even know how to reimburse you it said well God placed in my heart that's not a problem and I see that you read your Bible regularly you look like a good Christian there's there won't be any problem he took the money he went and bought a home a house an old house that he fixed up and he sold he bought another one he sold it but when said he prospered so much in the real estate that he was paying Tiding of about a million dollar from 20 cents to his Tiding being a million dollar who could have imagined that why he accepted what God asked him to do he he accepted what God presented him as an opportunity we reason so many times with the word we ask so many questions with the word we hesitate so much with the word it which shows it seems like the god of the impossible seem to have things that are impossible maybe God will bless you in a different career in whatever you follow than what you are following but maybe where you think you already have the Comfort it's not where God wants you to be he wants to give you something [Applause] better and to give you time for you to serve him but it depends on our disposition it depends on what we want the world is presented in a way that oh if you lose this job you won't have anything else oh we are in the inflation period right now you saw that when that other person lost his job he couldn't find another one the other one over there when he lost his job he even got a job that they were paying him less than what he was getting so if you try now because you say there's a God it's your problem but this little made from is tell that the God of this message when you put him at the first place when you give him confidence he will show you who's the god of the [Applause] impossible what he wants from us that we give him a place the word teaches us that he wants to occupy the first place not just the place in our life but the first place in our life and when he has occupied the first place he said it's not a man that he should lie and he will not deceive you brother says in uh God's provided way for today for this day paragraph [Music] 10 so God has made a way for us God loves his children he loves his people he wants to help them he wants to help you more than you want help God wants to help you more than you want help if you can just get that in your heart that God that God is is more willing to help you than you than you are to help yourself but he has a way and that's the only way that it will work you must come to his term not your term his term you want it to be a certain way but he gives it to you his way he's he's he's he's he's made himself available he's ready to help us but in a condition that we accept his condition that we may accept his word that we may say Amen to every word and the rest how is he going to help us it's not my problem what I know that is if I accept his condition if I follow his word he is more than ready to help me it means there's not a condition under which I will find myself that he won't be able to secure to help me even when the enemy has defeated me that if you do this because of uh because of the word oh if the enemy will will defy me and says if you do this because of the word it's the occasion to do it and to tell him I'm going to show you that my God is more than able God can prove you he won't answer the first day you may not answer the second day you may not answer the third day has an answer the first year God the devil will always come you see I told you how many months oh my God my God I told you tell him my God told me and I believe his conditions is more than wanting to help me and will do it certainly says like dipping in the waters of Jordan why he said the water up in his country was much better it was it was clean and better but that wasn't what the prophet said that's not what the word said dip here he dipped once leprosy is still there six times it still there was it was still [Music] there he had to oby and come God's way and when he when he fully obey God's way leprosy the leprosy left it's when we obey fully to the way of God God is more than able to help us this message is full of testimonies not just in the life of brother but in the life of many of of us we can say that God is more than wanting to help us that we that more than what we want help but the problem with us that the enemy is trying to keep us distracted the enemy wants to bring us down the the enemy is trying to make us think that our God is limited when we have a god who's unlimited and each one and every one of us can experiment that God each and every one of us who's a son and the daughter of God he can have an experience with this God but continues and he says and I say tonight that if we obey we obey God's provided way lepry will leave sickness will leave everything will leave but we got to come his way for this day now depping in the Jordan Jordan wouldn't do any good now that was for non the law was for the Jews Grace is by Christ God wants us to accept this Grace by by Christ and become uh Witnesses of this grace and every time we testify about his grace even even if they don't write our names in the book in the Bible Our Testimony Our Lives is written in the book of remembrance the Bible says in Malachi uh chapter 3 Malachi chapter 3 uh verse 16 to 18 the Bible says [Music] then they that fear the lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord Lord and that and that thought upon his name so when you testify one to another God listens he opens a book of remembrance and he writes it down and he writes it down he says [Music] shall be mine sayeth the Lord of hosts and in and it says and in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall he return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not when you testify one to another the book of remembrance and God says it's not you but he himself he will make it so that that people will notice the difference between those that serve God and those that don't serve him the this the Bible talks about elas and the shite woman how that the shite woman was good to Elijah and how God by Elijah gave the the the the child to this woman how that how that this young child died and God came and resurrected him when there was Hunger H Elisha went and told this woman that there will be a terrible famine go around the country first when the when the when the famine will be ended you can come back and this woman had such a wonderful testimony that God wrote In the book of remembrance and the Bible says in the book 2 Kings chapter 8 that this woman when the when hunger when when the famine was was finished she came back and she lost everything and she went to the king so that the king may be just to [Music] her that she may uh uh get back the things that she had lost and what did God do when the woman goes to the king it was Gaza who was next to the king gz was testifying to the king what God had done throughout the the the the Elijah and it was telling the king there was a woman oh it was a wonderful woman a true Christian and she was really good towards Elisha and even one day she lost the child and she didn't cry she didn't panic she came to the prophet and we asked her what was going on she said all is well until until when she got to the prophet he said is it me that asked for you for a child I was fine without a kid you gave me a child and look at that child is dead now I know that you are able to go and raise him up and as GAA was given a testimony of this woman they open the book of remembrance the the this woman gets into the king's building he says oh King if I can recollect or get back the things that I have lost and G looks he says King the testimony that I've been giving you now that's the woman we're going to read it uh 2 King chapter 8 verse [Music] one I'm going to go a little far I'm going to finish soon I'll take verse three and it came to pass that at the seventh year end that the woman returned out of the land of philistine and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land and the King talked with gahz gzar the servant of of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha had done and it came to pass that as he was telling the king how that he had restored a dead body to life that and behold the woman who uh whose son had been restored to life cried to the king for her for her house and and her land and gaha said my Lord oh King this is the woman this is her her this is her son whom Elisha restored to life and when the king asked for a woman she was she was she told him she told him so the king appointed unto her her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of her field since the day that she had left the land until now her testimony was not forgotten and God will make it so you can come at the right time for your testimony says I'm going to finish with this with this uh uh if the musician could come uh butam speaks in Gabriel's uh instruction to Daniel paragraph 130 now the close the close is the fact that God deals with this Israel only when she's in her Homeland let's take when God Abraham left his homeland and went down into Egypt what happened he walked away from the will of God and and never was blessed till he returned back to the to the Homeland God never dealt with him not One Vision nothing no nothing else till he came back to the Homeland look at Israel when they were when they were sent down into down in Egypt 400 years not one Miracle not one sign not one thing happened among [Music] them not recorded in in the history of any [Music] book same old 99 go to church offer the lamb say Hil Mary oh whatever go to work go to work in the morning come back at night same routine or whatever it was go back next year same thing the priest all arguing argued [Music] Rabbi so and so will elect Rabbi so and so he's got a better scholarship he knows more about the Egyptian and first thing you know the Egyptians they're all the all of them the same thing the Christian and the denomination all the same way Christians and and pagans all the same way because we went away from our territory that's the same thing that has that same thing has that's the same thing has happened to the church pres which says we've all went to the Methodist or Baptist or Pres Arian oh we've got a degree the degree out of Harford we've got a degree out of Whitten or we've got a degree out of someone else or or or Bob Jones we we've got a bachelor of art we've got D DD lld [Music] or something others it's like in the message we know more about the revelation of the Seven Seals we know more about the Seven Seals what has it amounted to a bunch of nonsense it's the way that it was in Egypt and God never did deal with Israel till she came out of her own land she came out to her homeline sorry he says hear me thou say the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland the message of the [Music] hour when we talk about the church is not this building is individuals I am a church you are a church and brother is saying th sayth the Lord God will not deal with us till we come back into our homeland the message of the [Music] hour it says get away from your Methodist it says come back to the original get away from your Methodist Baptist Presbyterian ideas or your Pentecostal assemblies Oneness threeness Fess or whatever it is Church of God na Nazar Pilgrim of Holiness Church of Christ all Antichrist movements that's hard and I realize I realize that this strikes the whole the the the world all wrong all of the devil oh my there is Godly men in every one of them there's godly people in every one of them movements but the organization itself in itself is not of God and God will never bless it he never done it he never done it you can prosper materially you can have an impression that your life is being blessed but the blessings that we are talking about which is eternal life as long as you don't come back into the message as long as you don't return to the original says Thou sayth the Lord God will not deal with [Music] you may God help [Music] us to take this message to [Music] heart to to be like this young girl from [Music] Israel that God sent a [Music] message and there's everything in this message there's not one person in this world who has a problem who who won't find an answer a solution in this message it's us that are hesitating it's us that are thinking that those problems are are bigger and greater than this message but this young girl her testimony she didn't think about what would happen next all she knew that there was a prophet look at what happened with [Music] non the the young girl gives him a good testimony that in Israel there's a prophet so n instead of going to Israel to meet the prophet he goes to his King oh look listen to what they told me the king who doesn't know the message he said well I don't know when I hear they talk about Bram you know I don't know you know I'm going to write a letter I'm going to send you to the [Music] king they don't send him to the prophet so he gets to the king the the the king reads the letter a good denominational King look look the power to heal a leop but look at this guy is looking for trouble since when I have the power to give life or to take life or to heal a leopard he says no he's looking for C I don't want problem he takes the letter and he just rips it it's true he didn't have that power and when elishah heard of it he says oh but I I think they misunderstood the one who testified it because Elisha was able to see what was happening in the King's house so as they were prepared because remember as they were preparing for war he said but that that girl told them go see the prophet why did they go to the king so the girl told them that it's in the message why are they saying it's the Baptist Church they don't have the same power to to to to stand against this the uh uh def the uh the [Music] challenge oh because we all preach the same Bible you know when he preaches it's like the [Music] message that's why I said well it's not a problem even if they go there no the young girl said the message if you go somewhere else he's going to he's going to rent his clothes to say that he does he doesn't have that power but the God of this message has everything that we need let's all stand my brother my sister [Music] God is inviting us [Music] tonight to [Music] testify to give a testimony to to send out an invitation when we walk there's so many people in [Music] need there there are people that are are in real need of God I know I know there are others that have become uh unbelievers I was talking about a man with a a man someone about [Music] God he said oh I lost faith a long time [Music] ago I don't even think one day to go to church [Music] and I he said I realize even my parents got me baptized at the Catholic Church against my will when I was when I was baby when I look at the picture I I even as a baby it looks like I was really mad about it but they baptized me but there are other people that have a real need of God that are in difficult circumstances that they have found themselves in Sin from the conditions of life that they have someone in need of someone to tell them that in the message there's the power of transformation that in the message there's the word that Health that in the message there's the the word that brings blessings that in the message there's a word that has a solution to all the problems that ourselves God help us to come back to the message and to the message only to receive the true blessings let's [Music] pray God Our Father this word is to us [Music] all we know tonight that it that the blessing is only in the message help us to come back fully oh as we realize this world is falling [Music] apart that the world is in a complete uh confusion like this young girl of Israel help help us to testify of you help us to say something that will help somebody help us that we may live in a manner that that will influence someone help us to be all [Music] yours we commit ourselves to [Music] you we completely give ourselves to you forgive our shortcomings forgive our negligence forgive our [Music]

worship [Music] you the reason I live oh is to Worship You Hallelujah man what a wonderful message man to just be like this young girl not overthink stuff and not how it's going to work out and you know we become great mathematicians you know what I mean we have to know every equation how it's going to work out before we do and if I tell him is he really going to believe I don't want to waste my time if he believes it doesn't matter that's none of your business you just live the life you just testify you just do your part and then let go God do his part amen I trust that's uh you know the motive of Our Lives butam said is to worship him is to testify of him and and he talks about how how do we testify of him someone comes you and say well you know I'm going through a difficult situation and I don't know how to get out of it and all of that well that's your opportunity you don't you don't go in and just Pally said I know you know I've been going through the same thing no that's the opportunity to turn the conversation around that's right that's an opportunity to say I know there's a God in Israel oh this is going on over here that's your opportunity to say I know there's a God in Israel that's your opportunity to say I I've heard about a god of the message I've heard about a God who raised the dead I've heard the the the ultimate thing about this is the god of History wants to be lifted up today he promises the same yesterday today and forever what he did back then he's able to do today and the only way we raise him out of history is to bring about the same testimony of what he did and be able to know that he's able to do the same thing today but for the most part the enemy wants us to see and think that those things that days of Miracle are pass and sometimes I feel like our lives we live a life in such a way where we feel like oh God doing this no no he did back then but now no this is too much oh my only believe if we can get out of that Comfort like our brother talked and if we can get out of that mindset and say God whatever the situation is I believe you are the same today I believe that your word I believe that your promises are the same I believe you were the same yesterday today and forever you haven't changed one bit what you did yesterday if you open up the Red Sea how much more healed the sick but says I'm the god that healed all that diseases not just headaches you know it's funny because it's when you have a headache it's it's easier to believe in healing oh I believe he's going to heal me I believe it's going to because you know you have a tanol in the cabinet but the same God who heals the headache is the one who heals cancer the same God who heals the headache is the same one who heals diseases that they come up with names no names whatever butam says all those is just the devil it's just devil this gu under a different name he castes out the devil in whatever form he shows up oh that's why God is not asking for big things simp Faith yes the Faith Like A Lo little young girl all she knew is she grew up in an environment where she saw this great God when she saw she knew for a fact that there was a God in Israel she knew she seen it she see how the prophet came in the things that he did so she didn't care what's going to happen to her she didn't overthink about what the future is going to be all she said is I know there's a God in Israel and that's my heart desire tonight I don't care what problems you're going through I don't care what tomorrow is going to bring I don't care what challenge just bow your heads and say I know there's a God in this message oh my situation is difficult I know but I know there's a God in this message I heard testimonies I heard the pro The God Who created the scroll is the same God tonight we can't take it and put it upon the prophet the problem is every time we talk about the prophet we look about how he was born and all of those things but we forget that the same Prophet was also part of the Bride because he had to manifest he had to be the first fruit the first fruit of what right hallu of those that will believe of the same crop of the same so the god of the Prophet didn't go with the prophet that if we can do like Elisha take the same mantle and say where is that God of Elijah where is the god who did Miracles where is The God Who challenged all the devils where's the God who stood and millions stood there and and and but Billy Paul said that he sent him he says I want you to go find me somebody who has a problem a sick person and Billy Paul said I went and I looked for the worst that I could find the worst that I could find why would he do that I mean he couldn't find you know just something that we can work with no because he knew that Daddy served the god of the impossible he knew that I have seen that God that angel for myself he knew that what Daddy was doing he was doing based on a commission he says nothing will stand before you you know you you look at the he will stand there and it didn't matter what the situation was that was presented before him he will look at it and he will diagnose it for ex exactly what it was whether it was a devil challenging or whether it was someone who needed help he will look at him and he says you he you can feel the presence of God don't you you can do all of that why he was trying to show us that the same God who was in the body of Jesus Christ has come and visited this generation has come just like he did with the Jew that same God and came and was manifested to the Gentile why to bring us to the Faith of Our Fathers they didn't care they believed it regardless of the circumstances oh I trust tonight we can come and say God I believe regardless if we can go tomorrow when the next day and the next day when challenges arises you know we when we come to church and we hear a word like this we are all pumped up but this is not for when we are pumped up this is when we are down low in the mud just bow your head and say I know there's a God in this message all that's all you have to say don't say too much and you don't have to say great words and just say within your heart I know there's a God in this message and I call that he may come to my rescue tonight is that your heart desire Hallelujah just lift your hand up to him just ask of him just pray within your own mouth and just say Lord God you are the creator of Heaven and Earth and Lord we we we desire a True Believer desire the experience of the true God and [Music] we never want this message to just be an intellectual Affair but we want it to be that that the god that when we woke up in the morning and when when challenges arises we don't know what to do we can call upon the name the scripture says that call upon the name of the Lord and you shall be saved the name of the Lord is a strong tower that the righteous run into it and they are saved we want a God Like The Prophet will say and one who left his kingdom and he came and he wanted to be one with his people and to those that went to work he wanted to go to work with them those that stay at home whatever we did he wanted to be one with us Lord we pray that you be one with your children tonight Lord and whatever the circumstance is Lord father this is the house of testimonies everybody in this building that's come here tonight they have a testimony of the wonderful work that you did and Lord we pray that as we go out of here what what every challenge we meet tomorrow the next day and the next day may you be the god of Elijah that was send may you be the god that we can say where is the god of Elijah where is that same God who raised the dead where is The God Who Made A Way who opened the right sea where is the god of Joshua where's the god of David you were the same yesterday today and forever you butam said that you have not lost your power you are the same yesterday today and forever and not only we're not only asking for ourselves but we are asking this for every circumstance you put us in anybody you put us in contact with that we may remember that we serve an unlimited God a limitless God one who created the heavens and the Earth we're so thankful for your word Lord and we commit what we are to you we say walk with us Lord and bless brother Paul and just fill him once again with a revelation oh God and reveal yourself more to him with we're so thankful for the word that he brought tonight father that we may go out of here feeling a lot stronger than the way we came
