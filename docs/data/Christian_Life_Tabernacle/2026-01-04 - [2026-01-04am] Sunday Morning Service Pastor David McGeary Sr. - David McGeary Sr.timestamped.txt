[38:11] [snorts] Who [singing] told the ocean
[38:15] you can [music] only

[41:34] Oh, [music] the precious life he gave.
[41:40] But now he's alive [music]
[41:43] and there.
[41:50] [music]
[41:53] Let's all stand and sing with this as we
[41:56] call our
[42:01] [music]
[42:06] [music] redeemer.
[42:12] Oh, [music]
[42:13] let all creation

[42:25] I know
[42:28] my [music] redeemer.
[42:35] You hold my
[42:39] moment.
[42:42] You calm [music]
[42:44] my raing
[42:46] seas.
[42:49] You walk [music]
[42:50] with me through fire
[42:56] and keep my [music]
[43:03] trust [music]
[43:04] in
[43:06] you.
[43:08] [music] Hold my trust
[43:11] in [singing]
[43:12] you.
[43:17] I believe
[43:19] you're [singing] my
[43:24] [music]
[43:26] you are all I need.
[43:32] I believe
[43:34] you.
[43:37] I believe [music and singing]
[43:39] you're my portion.
[43:44] I believe
[43:46] you're more than enough [music] for me.
[43:53] Jesus, you're [music] all I need.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:00] Father, how true.
[44:04] You are all we need.
[44:08] It's hard to hang on to that sometimes,
[44:10] Lord.
[44:12] Things seem to be moving so fast around
[44:15] us and [music]
[44:20] changes are
[44:24] just happening everywhere.
[44:28] But yet, you told us you would remain
[44:31] ever the same. And I believe that with
[44:34] all my heart, Father, I ask this morning
[44:37] that the simplicity of your word would
[44:40] touch our hearts.
[44:42] Father, as we look into the storehouse
[44:44] that you left to guide us
[44:47] in this last hour, Father, may we stay
[44:50] true to it.
[44:53] Though with many it's not popular,
[44:57] father and to some it's become
[45:00] oldfashioned and something of years gone
[45:04] by.
[45:07] But yet, Father, I still sit down and
[45:09] read the great writings of the [music]
[45:11] Apostle Paul,
[45:14] and I find them to be ever so true,
[45:18] though thousands years written.
[45:22] Father, I sit and I listen to the
[45:24] messenger of our age. And
[45:27] though it seems like it's been a few
[45:30] years, yet the voice still speaks
[45:34] and reveals and sheds light, Father,
[45:38] because it didn't come from time, it
[45:42] came from eternity. And Father, so it's
[45:45] ever so true. So, Father, as we look
[45:48] into these things this morning, may you
[45:51] be our portion and may you help us.
[45:53] [music]
[45:54] We ask this in Jesus precious name we
[45:57] pray. Amen. [music]
[46:00] Amen. If you have your Bibles, we want
[46:02] to turn over to um
[46:06] Isaiah 43
[46:08] and 7 and then we'll read in Philippians
[46:11] 2 and 13. And I believe this morning is
[46:15] uh Ella Thomas Aak's uh last service
[46:19] with us here as she goes to take a job I
[46:23] believe in Phoenix and uh I I I don't I
[46:28] don't want to say how old you are but I
[46:31] believe I dedicated you.
[46:34] How many years ago was that?
[46:39] 22
[46:40] &gt;&gt; 22 years ago.
[46:43] My
[46:45] time goes. I've seen so I've seen her
[46:49] from this big to this big. I'm not going
[46:54] to go there. Forgive me. She's beautiful
[46:58] and we'll miss her. She's always helped
[47:00] with our Sunday school. She's always had
[47:01] a smile. Uh you you know. So, uh, I know
[47:07] one thing that where she's going, she's
[47:09] going to make us a little dumber and
[47:11] make them a whole lot smarter.
[47:14] So,
[47:16] uh, we wish her all the success and, uh,
[47:24] uh, may the love of God be shed abroad
[47:27] in her heart and may she always be a a
[47:31] good testimony for us here. We're proud
[47:34] of her and proud to uh see her represent
[47:39] us in life no matter where uh she goes.
[47:44] So, God bless you, sis. And come see us
[47:46] often. If you need any help, call. If
[47:50] you need to be rescued, I'll drive out
[47:52] there and we'll rescue you.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Okay? And don't talk to no boy without
[47:58] letting me know first
[48:01] because I'll investigate him.
[48:04] So, um,
[48:06] you know, God, how many believes
[48:08] everything's pre-planned by God?
[48:12] God knows exactly what he's doing. And,
[48:15] uh, so we trust.
[48:18] Read this little scripture here and then
[48:20] we'll turn to our other scripture.
[48:24] For it is God which workketh in you
[48:30] both to will
[48:33] this is Philippians. I'm sorry. Let's
[48:36] let let's go back. I'll go back and read
[48:39] my first scripture first. Let's go back
[48:40] to Isaiah uh
[48:44] uh 43 and 7.
[48:49] even everyone
[48:52] that is called by my name.
[48:57] For I have created him for my glory. I
[49:01] have formed him. Yay, I have made him.
[49:07] And then let us read again over in uh
[49:10] Philippians
[49:12] 2 and 13. For it is God which workketh
[49:17] in you both to will and to do of his
[49:23] good pleasure. Our gracious father we
[49:26] ask you to uh bless your word to us this
[49:30] morning in Jesus precious name. You may
[49:33] be seated this morning.
[49:36] Um
[49:38] uh I it it was on my heart and
[49:43] uh to um
[49:48] uh go to this this uh message that is uh
[49:55] it's it was preached in uh uh March 20th
[50:02] uh 1964
[50:05] and it's called God's identified himself
[50:09] by his characteristics
[50:12] and and there's I just want to go
[50:13] through it with you a little bit this
[50:15] morning read statements and and talk
[50:19] about some of the riches that are stored
[50:23] up in the word of God for us because you
[50:26] know uh God's interested in you as he
[50:30] said everyone that calleth on my name I
[50:33] have made him
[50:35] you know what I I mean, he he's it that
[50:38] you are his workmanship for his good
[50:41] pleasure and uh and we're forained under
[50:45] good works that we should walk into
[50:48] them. So, we know that God's hands in
[50:51] our life. And so, we want to talk a
[50:53] little bit and more of kind of a not
[50:56] evangelistic or or but just more of a
[51:00] just a teaching this morning. uh uh uh
[51:05] direction in our hearts and our lives
[51:08] that we might find uh the deeper purpose
[51:12] for I believe that God has a purpose for
[51:15] everything he does. He had a reason for
[51:18] calling you. He had a reason for
[51:21] choosing you. He had a time
[51:25] to call you. Uh uh we often wonder, you
[51:30] know, why did God let me go so long? Or
[51:33] why did he let my loved one go so long?
[51:36] Or why did he let these things happen in
[51:39] my life? Well, the wonderful thing about
[51:42] things that happen in your life is that
[51:45] they don't carry over to eternity. So
[51:48] that's what the blood's there for. It
[51:50] just washes all those things away. and
[51:54] he's going to carry out his plan. But I
[51:58] noticed something uh coming back uh on
[52:01] one of my flights
[52:04] [snorts]
[52:05] here a while back and
[52:08] I noticed uh and I noticed it in the
[52:10] restaurant the other day. I was out
[52:13] shopping the other day and I noticed it
[52:16] again and I started seeing it everywhere
[52:21] and I thought this is interesting and it
[52:25] was a symbol of IU
[52:29] and I thought IU. I said huh. So, I did
[52:35] a looked around a little bit and that
[52:37] stands for the universe
[52:43] and uh I I'm going in and out. Is it the
[52:47] mic?
[52:50] It's me.
[52:54] All right, I'll just figure it out. So,
[52:57] uh the So, this it's a school
[53:03] And for once in a hundred years they
[53:08] finally have a football team
[53:11] that is rated the number one football
[53:14] team in the country.
[53:16] So all of a sudden everybody is wearing
[53:19] their hats and their jerseys and their
[53:22] t-shirts and everything and they want to
[53:25] be identified with this university
[53:30] where for years you didn't even know
[53:32] that school existed. Nobody nobody uh
[53:36] stood up
[53:37] and represented the University of
[53:42] Indiana. uh you know I think that they
[53:45] might have won four football games a
[53:48] year you know but now when basketball
[53:51] season came around now then they would
[53:54] all come out but they never identified
[53:57] with football so but now boy everywhere
[54:01] you go they're proud of of of that and
[54:05] so that they're identifying but I'm I
[54:08] don't want to talk about identification
[54:11] this morning as identif ification by
[54:14] association.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so that's that's what that is.
[54:20] That's identification by association.
[54:24] They want to be so associated
[54:26] and so they'll put on the thing or
[54:28] they'll put on a jersey.
[54:31] Uh in Dallas here for a long time, we
[54:34] had a a very popular football
[54:38] quarterback named Roger Stalach. and uh
[54:42] I've had the pleasure to meet him and
[54:45] and can and watch him play basketball
[54:48] and and big athletic guy, you know. So
[54:52] uh uh if you know I thought well I could
[54:54] go wear his jersey and you would see
[54:57] everywhere people wearing number 12. I I
[55:00] hope that was his number. Sorry if it
[55:02] wasn't. But so they they would wear it
[55:05] number 12. And so they put on the the
[55:08] jersey and they're associating
[55:11] themselves with the quarterback of the
[55:15] Dallas Cowboys. So they want to identify
[55:19] with the team,
[55:21] &gt;&gt; but that doesn't make them
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Roger Stala.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; You understand? It it it it has it has
[55:34] absolutely
[55:36] uh it it doesn't even affect them uh
[55:40] whatsoever. So it's not identification
[55:43] by association.
[55:46] Uh Rogers Dalbach, we'll just use that
[55:49] gentleman or or Babe Ruth or
[55:52] Michelangelo or whatever we know. We
[55:55] know if that spirit was in us then we'd
[55:57] have the same characteristic.
[56:00] So we would be a he identifies who he is
[56:06] by his characteristics. You can you can
[56:09] try to associate with him by putting on
[56:13] his hat, by putting on his jersey. You
[56:17] can do an association, but those
[56:19] characteristics aren't identified in
[56:22] you. So the association don't make you
[56:26] him.
[56:30] You see, there's something that that
[56:33] makes you uh what that you are. And I'd
[56:37] like to uh share this statement. He
[56:39] said, now this the spirit of America is
[56:45] supposed to be a Christian nation.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Now we claim to be a Christian nation,
[56:51] but the spirit of this nation is not
[56:54] Christian.
[56:56] So you you see that we associate, in
[56:59] other words, we associate, we're
[57:02] supposed to be a Christian nation,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; but the spirit of the nation is not
[57:07] Christian.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And if I don't care if you want to put
[57:12] that up there, it's paragraph 29.
[57:18] We if you start playing it, I'll start
[57:20] listening and I'll sit down right now
[57:23] because there ain't nothing like it from
[57:26] the original. So, uh I don't know if
[57:28] that's a subtle message being sent from
[57:31] the back there. But it the but the
[57:34] spirit of the nation is not Christian.
[57:37] It might be called the Christian nation,
[57:39] but it's a million miles from it. It's
[57:43] characteristics.
[57:44] See,
[57:46] &gt;&gt; so you know, I mean, our our country is
[57:49] so divided. We realize that uh you know,
[57:52] we went in and captured somebody that
[57:54] some people thinks a criminal. this and
[57:57] the very same people are over here
[58:00] screaming criminal and there's a whole
[58:02] another group in the same place saying
[58:04] free the man
[58:06] &gt;&gt; you know and they want to it just it's
[58:08] like I I'm so thankful that God didn't
[58:13] have us follow politics
[58:17] &gt;&gt; you know what I mean his kingdom is not
[58:19] of this world it's a very simple
[58:22] election process you vote for him. He
[58:27] votes for you and that's a majority and
[58:30] the it's one right there.
[58:34] But he said he said so she said to me,
[58:38] she says, "Well, aren't we Americans?"
[58:42] I said, "No, we live here. It's our
[58:46] country.
[58:48] We stay in it.
[58:51] We love it.
[58:54] is the best nation in the world, but yet
[58:58] we're not Americans.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; I said we are born from above.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit come down and we belong
[59:14] to a kingdom.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; It's not of this world.
[59:22] I said that's the reason that our
[59:26] sisters wear dresses,
[59:28] wear long hair, don't wear makeup. See,
[59:33] their characteristics
[59:36] identify them as holiness unto the Lord
[59:40] from above.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; So now their spirits
[59:45] identifying them,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; their characteristics
[59:49] are identifying them. So they're
[59:52] identified by their characteristics.
[59:56] And it goes on to say, "Therefore, we
[59:58] are seeking a kingdom.
[1:00:01] We are seeking a king to come and
[1:00:05] receive his subject to his kingdom."
[1:00:10] And they are identified by their
[1:00:13] characteristics
[1:00:15] that their treasures are not of this
[1:00:18] earth or of this nation.
[1:00:22] It's of above in glory. Therefore, they
[1:00:26] look for a city whose builder and maker
[1:00:30] is God. They are properly
[1:00:34] identified.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Now God
[1:00:39] is the one who imparts. You're
[1:00:42] identified by characteristics.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; You can have the same name
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; as somebody.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; I I imagine there's probably I was
[1:00:54] surprised to find out that there was
[1:00:56] other David McGearies,
[1:00:59] you know. So, I sent them all a text and
[1:01:01] informed them that I was the best
[1:01:03] looking of all that held that name.
[1:01:06] No, you can have the same name.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; You can have the same birth date.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; You may even kind of look alike if maybe
[1:01:17] you uh it was another relative named
[1:01:20] after the grandfather or something, you
[1:01:24] know. So you might have two John Smiths
[1:01:27] and they have the same name, the same
[1:01:28] birth date, they have all these
[1:01:30] different things, but what separates
[1:01:33] them is their characteristics.
[1:01:37] That's what separates them. The there's
[1:01:40] that you you you you wait till they uh
[1:01:44] you could do something that tells them
[1:01:46] apart. Somebody the other day said, you
[1:01:48] know, I was wondering who you were. you
[1:01:51] reminded me of somebody. I was thinking
[1:01:53] about it, but when you spoke, he said,
[1:01:56] "I automatically re put it together that
[1:02:00] you have a brother named Dennis."
[1:02:02] And uh so uh I tell my usual story. I
[1:02:08] said, "Yes, that's my older brother."
[1:02:10] But so but there was something in my
[1:02:13] voice, something in my mannerism,
[1:02:16] something in my characteristics that now
[1:02:19] identified and separated from all the
[1:02:23] other things that might be the same.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Your birth date, the color of your hair,
[1:02:29] the color of your skin, the country that
[1:02:32] you come from. Uh well, you know, like I
[1:02:34] I I go down list in names. I went to a
[1:02:38] graduation, a high school graduation in
[1:02:42] Canada, uh in Steinbeck, Canada. And
[1:02:47] there were 221
[1:02:50] graduating students. And out of those
[1:02:53] 221 graduation students, there was only
[1:02:57] seven last names.
[1:03:02] Dick Reiner, you know, just over and
[1:03:07] over and over again. I thought and they
[1:03:10] could they they it would be Deborah uh
[1:03:13] Riner, you know, uh uh you know, Mavis
[1:03:17] Dudik and they just go down and maybe
[1:03:20] two or three of them the same name right
[1:03:22] in a row, but every single one of them
[1:03:25] had was different
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; by their characteristics.
[1:03:30] And you know even twins
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; will have different characteristics.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Now God did that because he wanted
[1:03:41] things to be able to be identified.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; He wanted to have us to have a way that
[1:03:49] we could we could tell things apart.
[1:03:54] And so that would that's his his purpose
[1:03:58] in doing something is so he could
[1:04:00] identify. So when he talked about those
[1:04:03] Christian ladies they said they they're
[1:04:06] they're identifying
[1:04:08] their characteristics
[1:04:10] identifies that they're from another
[1:04:13] kingdom.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; That they have another spirit. They
[1:04:18] there's there's something that gives
[1:04:20] them. So God gives characteristics
[1:04:23] for the purpose of being identified
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; and to be able to tell them apart.
[1:04:33] And we know the example many times
[1:04:35] that's been given of the bird that
[1:04:37] flies.
[1:04:39] You can look out in a distance and all
[1:04:41] you know is it's a bird. So you could
[1:04:43] say that's a bird, you know. But if you
[1:04:47] know the characteristics of certain
[1:04:49] birds, you watch the pattern in which
[1:04:52] that they fly, you know, and there's
[1:04:55] certain birds that they they fly up and
[1:04:58] then they drop down and fly up and their
[1:05:00] pattern is like a up and down. And
[1:05:03] there's other birds that fly straight,
[1:05:06] you know, like a hummingbird, you know,
[1:05:07] it just can sit there in midair, you
[1:05:11] know what I mean? And just go like this.
[1:05:13] You just And then when it flies, it's
[1:05:17] you know, and then it just darts, you
[1:05:20] know, and and you can you know that no
[1:05:23] other bird
[1:05:25] moves like that. And so now you've
[1:05:27] identified that bird is a hummingbird.
[1:05:30] [snorts]
[1:05:31] Okay, we're trying to to get this
[1:05:34] something here. So we so God gives
[1:05:38] identifications
[1:05:39] for for the purpose of
[1:05:43] of knowing the difference.
[1:05:48] Okay. So if if God therefore he he gives
[1:05:53] these the the difference [snorts]
[1:05:56] he when he spoke something
[1:06:01] then he has to identify what he's
[1:06:05] spoken.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; You understand? Because he's the creator
[1:06:11] [snorts]
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; right? So if he said let there be light
[1:06:16] now we're left to sit there and say
[1:06:21] what is light.
[1:06:24] [snorts]
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; So now he has to identify light.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; So that we can now tell light from
[1:06:33] darkness.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So he said let there be light and there
[1:06:37] was light. And so when light came, it
[1:06:41] had characteristics that could be
[1:06:44] identified as light. Therefore, God
[1:06:47] spoke his word. His word is spoken. And
[1:06:51] when his word is spoken, that word
[1:06:55] automatically
[1:06:58] possesses
[1:06:59] certain characteristics
[1:07:02] that will identify it as the word.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; You understand? He put the
[1:07:07] characteristics in it just [snorts] like
[1:07:09] he made the male deer to have antlers.
[1:07:14] Everything might look the same, but how
[1:07:16] do you know whether that's a male or a
[1:07:19] female? Well, you you just look and you
[1:07:23] see all of a sudden it's got uh horns.
[1:07:26] Even on small deer, that little deer
[1:07:28] will have what we call a button, a
[1:07:31] little teeny button on top of its head.
[1:07:33] And we know that's a a a a male deer.
[1:07:38] And so though everything else is the
[1:07:40] same, he God puts characteristics
[1:07:45] for the purpose
[1:07:49] of them to be identified.
[1:07:53] Not now, we're not talking about
[1:07:55] identity by association.
[1:07:59] You understand? We're talking about
[1:08:02] identity by divine spoken
[1:08:07] created characteristics.
[1:08:10] Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; So the characteristics, let me take the
[1:08:15] word characteristics and maybe add it to
[1:08:19] the word character
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; because we're not talking physical
[1:08:28] characteristics
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; when we're talking spiritual,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; but we're talking character.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus began to speak. He
[1:08:38] began to tell his disciples about a new
[1:08:41] character. When you're buffeted, buff it
[1:08:44] not back. When [snorts] you're smoked on
[1:08:46] the cheek, turn the other cheek. When
[1:08:49] somebody compels you to go a mile, go
[1:08:52] twain. So, what started to happen is you
[1:08:55] started to realize that he now was
[1:08:58] preaching about a character,
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Not physical characteristics.
[1:09:07] God always identified he identified his
[1:09:10] the children of Israel by a physical
[1:09:13] characteristic
[1:09:15] that separated them. So God's is we know
[1:09:20] that his word calls for total separation
[1:09:23] from unbelief. So God he what he what
[1:09:26] he's doing is is he's giving character
[1:09:32] for identification
[1:09:36] and for something else.
[1:09:39] And so when we
[1:09:42] if his word is spoken
[1:09:46] and he says let there be water or let
[1:09:50] there be now he identifies water by its
[1:09:55] characteristic
[1:09:58] what it is and we can try to break it
[1:10:01] down and say well it's got two parts
[1:10:03] hydrogen and one part oxygen and that
[1:10:07] makes water,
[1:10:09] you know, and
[1:10:12] I've went and got hydrogen and oxygen
[1:10:14] and tried to shoot them together and I
[1:10:16] never could produce water, man. But
[1:10:20] anyway, it just how it is, you know, God
[1:10:23] knows how to do things.
[1:10:26] So
[1:10:28] as we as you you got my I hope that you
[1:10:31] have the principle of what I'm talking
[1:10:35] about here because
[1:10:39] this is a a great age that we live in
[1:10:43] and a great spirit uh h in the land of
[1:10:49] everybody talking about deliverance.
[1:10:52] you know, be delivered from this, be
[1:10:55] delivered from that. Uh if you if you're
[1:10:58] playing uh phone games, you know what I
[1:11:02] mean? Then the preachers pre you need to
[1:11:04] be delivered
[1:11:07] from phone games, right? Or if you're
[1:11:10] listening to music, you need to be
[1:11:12] delivered
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; from music. And so deliverance is a uh
[1:11:20] is a major part
[1:11:22] of Christianity because we have an enemy
[1:11:27] that shackles us.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; So we desire to be free
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; and and and that desire in us calls out
[1:11:38] for us to to want freedom because when
[1:11:44] we're preached,
[1:11:46] condemnation comes.
[1:11:49] And many times alls we really want to be
[1:11:52] free of is the condemnation,
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; not the thing itself.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; So if something was bad, let's just take
[1:12:02] a game or something. If if I said that
[1:12:06] this game is bad, then uh you would come
[1:12:10] under condemnation and say, "I want to
[1:12:13] be free from this condemnation." But if
[1:12:15] I came back and said, "This game's
[1:12:17] okay."
[1:12:20] [snorts]
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I can play this game.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; You see, and you miss
[1:12:34] really
[1:12:36] what deliverance is.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; What where where really is the
[1:12:42] deliverance?
[1:12:44] It's not in the right or wrong.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; It's in something much deeper.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And and so if I I'd like I'm going to
[1:12:54] read from the uh this paragraph uh
[1:12:59] 34. It says, "And this God raised up a
[1:13:03] prophet named Moses,
[1:13:05] and the man was taught in all the wisdom
[1:13:08] of Egypt."
[1:13:11] No doubt.
[1:13:13] But what he was a great smart
[1:13:16] intellectual man for he could teach the
[1:13:19] Egyptians wisdom.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Look like a properly fitted man for
[1:13:27] deliverance.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Now just follow this through. And I hope
[1:13:32] that we I'm going to try to be short
[1:13:35] today.
[1:13:37] But you see what we call deliverance and
[1:13:40] what God calls deliverance is something
[1:13:43] different.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; So sometimes we think deliverance is,
[1:13:50] oh, I'm just free from this or I'm free
[1:13:53] from the condemnation.
[1:13:56] But if you just go from one chain to
[1:13:59] another chain, you've never really been
[1:14:02] delivered.
[1:14:06] It's like going from the rock pile,
[1:14:09] you know, crushing rocks
[1:14:12] to going to carry in the basket.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; You know, it it you're still you're
[1:14:19] still working for the slave master.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; You've just switched jobs. you know,
[1:14:26] he's just giving you a little something
[1:14:27] easier to do for a little while to
[1:14:30] appease you,
[1:14:32] you know, and and but yet you're you're
[1:14:35] still under the taskmaster. So, you
[1:14:37] think, well, I got delivered from I got
[1:14:40] delivered from games.
[1:14:43] You know what I mean? But now I listen
[1:14:46] to AC/DC.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Is that right? How do you know?
[1:14:58] You know, I don't know which one they
[1:15:00] are. I saw some guys all painted up like
[1:15:02] monsters. I don't know if that was them
[1:15:04] or not.
[1:15:06] But you see that that's not what we got
[1:15:10] a different idea
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; of deliverance.
[1:15:15] And that's what he's saying. God is
[1:15:18] different.
[1:15:21] what's deliverance to us is not
[1:15:23] deliverance to God.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what he said. So, as you see,
[1:15:28] what we call deliverance and what God
[1:15:30] calls deliverance is a different thing.
[1:15:32] Now, watch this man with all of his
[1:15:35] ethics.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; He knowed he was born to deliver the
[1:15:40] children of Israel. Yet, with all his
[1:15:42] education,
[1:15:44] that's all he knew about. and knowing
[1:15:48] that he was called of God to do the job.
[1:15:53] He had all all of his he had his
[1:15:57] bachelor of arts
[1:15:59] and his PhD and his LLD and so forth.
[1:16:05] And he went out to deliver Israel and
[1:16:07] was a total failure.
[1:16:11] Now, I hope we could catch this.
[1:16:14] Notice
[1:16:16] look like him being with his foot on the
[1:16:21] throne in Egypt to become Pharaoh. He
[1:16:26] could have delivered the children of
[1:16:28] Israel after he became Pharaoh,
[1:16:32] [clears throat]
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Simple.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; God wants him delivering.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Just let him become Pharaoh.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Go on out.
[1:16:45] Good. I
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; pretty good deal.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; I mean, sounds like the easy way. That
[1:16:52] sounds like deliverance,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; And that would have been it seems like a
[1:16:59] much better way
[1:17:02] to deliver
[1:17:05] deliverance
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; than really what deliverance was about.
[1:17:13] And so he he goes on, he says this. He
[1:17:16] said
[1:17:17] because he was next in line for the
[1:17:21] throne. But you see that in doing it
[1:17:25] that way, it wouldn't identify God's
[1:17:30] characteristics
[1:17:32] in delivering his people.
[1:17:35] He said he would deliver them.
[1:17:39] He he would deliver them with a mighty
[1:17:42] hand. Not Moses with a mighty army, but
[1:17:45] God with a mighty hand.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh you so you you if you see
[1:17:54] what is is being said here is that God
[1:18:00] delivers by character.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; By characteristics.
[1:18:08] It was what that he was going to deliver
[1:18:14] them by.
[1:18:16] It couldn't be.
[1:18:18] So I better just stay there just for a
[1:18:23] second.
[1:18:25] Power apart from character
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; is satanic.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; So many times we think it's the power
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; that delivers us.
[1:18:38] the power, you know, the laying on of
[1:18:41] hands, the the the casting out which all
[1:18:44] those things we will do.
[1:18:48] But Paul said, "Wherever there's
[1:18:50] tongues, wherever these things, for
[1:18:51] these things will cease,
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; but let us move on to perfection."
[1:18:57] So there there's something else that
[1:18:59] God's trying to accomplish
[1:19:02] more than just delivering people from
[1:19:06] the sufferings and from the weaknesses
[1:19:10] that they have in their flesh.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; And though we're always in that battle,
[1:19:15] tempted, falling, getting lifted up. And
[1:19:19] and and so we think if we get rid of one
[1:19:22] thing, that's deliverance. But that's
[1:19:25] not what God sees as deliverance. God
[1:19:28] delivers by character.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Character
[1:19:32] I is the character.
[1:19:36] God is going to deliver us by character.
[1:19:42] In other what really delivers the
[1:19:44] believer
[1:19:46] if you if you see what I'm saying is
[1:19:48] that God speaks something
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; and that has its identifying
[1:19:55] characteristics.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; So if God speaks anything, he speaks the
[1:20:01] word and he's got to identify it. He's
[1:20:05] got to give it identifying
[1:20:08] characteristics,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; things that you could tell them apart.
[1:20:13] Just like those ladies, he said, "Look
[1:20:15] at the way they dress." They're doing
[1:20:17] that because they're identified. They
[1:20:20] believe in another kingdom. And the
[1:20:24] character and characteristics of what
[1:20:28] they believe is reflecting through them.
[1:20:35] So God
[1:20:39] he in
[1:20:42] in giving the the believer
[1:20:47] and and this is where we stand this
[1:20:50] morning
[1:20:52] and can I hope this will just help us
[1:20:54] going forward in the new year. We
[1:20:58] believe that we're the spoken word
[1:21:00] children of God. Right? Is that what we
[1:21:02] say?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And there's we believe we're
[1:21:06] predestinated.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; We believe we're in the thoughts of God.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And so it's not like an army
[1:21:16] that delivers us. It's the fact that
[1:21:20] within us we have identifying
[1:21:23] characteristics
[1:21:25] or certain things that's going to prove
[1:21:27] to us and prove to the world that were
[1:21:30] his bride.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; It's the character.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Now, if a person got that character
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; of dedication,
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; he got the character of devotion.
[1:21:47] He got the character of sacrifice
[1:21:52] and the and the characteristics
[1:21:56] of a believer God put in there.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; And so he speaks the word that those
[1:22:04] characteristics and that character might
[1:22:08] come to life because it's that character
[1:22:11] that delivers you.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; If you had the character, you're not
[1:22:15] going to do that.
[1:22:18] Your character
[1:22:21] and the identifying qualities
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; that God put in his bride
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; is what has power over the enemy.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; And that's why John said if you love the
[1:22:38] world or the things of the world, the
[1:22:40] love of God is not in you.
[1:22:44] But if the love of God is in you,
[1:22:48] then you would abstain from the
[1:22:50] appearance of evil.
[1:22:54] It's it it and we begin to realize
[1:23:01] that in what that he's doing, he's he's
[1:23:05] wanting to now
[1:23:08] identify himself
[1:23:11] in his bride.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; So if it's his word,
[1:23:19] then that word has to have certain
[1:23:24] character.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; It's got an identifiable character.
[1:23:32] Because he's going to do something that
[1:23:34] can't be duplicated,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; right? So obviously we would think that
[1:23:46] it's empower and demonstration
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; and we do have that
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; but our motive for having that is a
[1:23:55] character motive. That's why it's not
[1:23:58] satanic
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; because we do it with the divine
[1:24:02] character of God. So we don't lay hands
[1:24:05] on anybody suddenly.
[1:24:10] We pray. We seek the face of the Lord.
[1:24:14] The bride stays still till she has thus
[1:24:16] sayaith the Lord. She is now living by
[1:24:21] identified character.
[1:24:24] The character that was spoke in you
[1:24:29] before the foundation of the world. When
[1:24:31] he spoke that yellow hammer, that bird,
[1:24:34] he he we call it yellow hammer. I'm sure
[1:24:37] it's got some one of those fancy Latin
[1:24:40] names that
[1:24:43] people that think they're smart say, you
[1:24:46] know, it's it's bird, [snorts] you know,
[1:24:50] but he put that characteristic in that
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; to identify that bird.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; So when that bird moves,
[1:25:01] you know what it is. [snorts] Now if he
[1:25:04] spoke a bride
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; then he has to give that bride a
[1:25:11] character
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; and characteristics
[1:25:14] that separate her and identify her as
[1:25:18] bride.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; It's not something that can be
[1:25:22] duplicated.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; It's not done by just association
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; by putting on the jersey by putting on
[1:25:31] the name. But it it's proven by the
[1:25:36] character of the life that's lived.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; You you know that's a person. So if we
[1:25:45] if we were walking and everybody was
[1:25:47] dressed the same and and you walked up
[1:25:50] and you slapped one guy and he was ready
[1:25:52] to duke it out and you slapped the other
[1:25:55] guy and he turned the other cheek.
[1:26:00] Now, they both might be called
[1:26:01] Christians.
[1:26:05] You know what I mean?
[1:26:08] They both might go to the same church.
[1:26:13] They might be twins for all that matter.
[1:26:16] But one has the identifying character of
[1:26:21] what God spoke.
[1:26:24] You are his workmanship
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus for ordained unto good
[1:26:30] works. I have made you. I have formed
[1:26:33] you. I have spoken you. [snorts] And
[1:26:36] therefore, if he's done that,
[1:26:39] then he wants to identify you
[1:26:44] as his.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; We we always think on our side of it
[1:26:49] that we have to identify ourselves with
[1:26:52] him.
[1:26:54] And the obligation is on us.
[1:26:59] And and deliverance isn't always what
[1:27:02] God calls deliverance.
[1:27:06] So we we think, well, I better line up.
[1:27:09] I better do this. I better do that. The
[1:27:11] truth of the matter is it's him.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; He spoke to you.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He said you were bride.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; He called you. He put your name on the
[1:27:22] lamb's book of life. Now, he's got to
[1:27:25] identify that you are that person by
[1:27:30] having the your characteristics
[1:27:33] identify that you're the bride.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; So, he had to put them there.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; They have to be there.
[1:27:45] So we we it it's not so much a struggle
[1:27:49] of us trying to become Christian but as
[1:27:52] much as it is allowing him
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; to identify himself
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And character
[1:28:07] is really where the victory is for a
[1:28:09] Christian.
[1:28:14] having the character of Christ,
[1:28:17] being a new creature in Christ Jesus,
[1:28:22] having a nature.
[1:28:26] That's why when a person's born again,
[1:28:28] it doesn't mean that all of a sudden
[1:28:30] they're going to run out and start
[1:28:33] laying hands on the sick and people are
[1:28:35] going to recover and they're going to
[1:28:37] prophesy and they're going to all those
[1:28:39] things. But I'll tell you what happens
[1:28:41] is they have a nature change.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden they look on one another
[1:28:49] different.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said they'll know your
[1:28:53] are my disciples by your love one for
[1:28:57] another
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; by the character that you have by the
[1:29:02] nature that you produce by the
[1:29:05] atmosphere
[1:29:06] that you create.
[1:29:09] Now, you know, there when the skunk's
[1:29:11] around because he creates an atmosphere,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; you know, we we got a lot of spiritual
[1:29:20] skunks.
[1:29:27] The the the it doesn't matter what
[1:29:29] jersey they have on.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what hat. It's not
[1:29:34] it's not identification by association.
[1:29:38] And it's not us identifying with him,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; but it's him identifying himself
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Because he spoke to us. He said who we
[1:29:54] were.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:56] And if you believe that, then you know
[1:29:59] by faith
[1:30:02] that he's got THAT THOSE THE CHARACT HIS
[1:30:05] character has to be in you BECAUSE THE
[1:30:09] BRIDE AND THE BRIDEGROOM become one.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm not there, but I'm going
[1:30:15] to be there."
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Because the very character desires it.
[1:30:26] The character itself
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; doesn't need the fame.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need the recognition.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; It's not driven by outside sources. It's
[1:30:39] driven by what God put in its heart
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; to hunger and thirst after
[1:30:45] righteousness.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; It's the brook springing up on the
[1:30:52] inside.
[1:30:53] It's like the little grass seed
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; that gets germinated. It's going to find
[1:30:59] its way out to the sunlight. Like the
[1:31:02] lily in the bottom of the pond. It's
[1:31:05] going to work its way up through the
[1:31:07] muck to the sunlight BECAUSE ITS DESIRE
[1:31:12] IS THE CHARACTER BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO
[1:31:16] IDENTIFY himself in you. Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; He's got to prove who his bride is.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; You'll never do it.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let there be."
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "My sheep know my voice,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; and another they won't follow."
[1:31:43] He said, "I'll never leave you nor
[1:31:46] forsake you,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; but I'll lead you and guide you into all
[1:31:52] truth and righteousness."
[1:31:55] So we, if you could understand what I'm
[1:31:58] trying to say, it it's not the being
[1:32:02] free
[1:32:04] from something that's your deliverance.
[1:32:07] Your deliverance is the possession
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; of the character
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; because that'll continually
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; to deliver you
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; after situation and situation. It's not
[1:32:20] one situation from the next. So God had
[1:32:23] to deliver with his character.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; God's characteristics, God's character,
[1:32:30] what had to deliver.
[1:32:34] He could have used the army,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; but it didn't represent the way he does
[1:32:40] things.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to be
[1:32:46] the representation
[1:32:49] of how that God does things. And how do
[1:32:52] we get there? Faith cometh by hearing,
[1:32:55] hearing by the word of God, by divine
[1:32:58] revelation.
[1:33:01] And sometimes we look in the mirror and
[1:33:03] say, "I'm really not acting very nice.
[1:33:08] I'm angry. I'm bitter."
[1:33:11] None of those
[1:33:14] are characteristics.
[1:33:17] So if you got rid of the bitterness,
[1:33:22] you're just waiting for another
[1:33:24] situation to make you bitter.
[1:33:27] But if you put divine love there,
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; now you have the character
[1:33:36] and that character will deliver.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; So you got to remember it's not
[1:33:42] something that can be duplicated
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; or a doctrine. It's actually a
[1:33:47] character. And so I I want to read
[1:33:49] paragraph 51. But you see, Moses being
[1:33:53] the correct prophet of God not only had
[1:33:56] the fundamental parts, he had the
[1:33:59] identification of God.
[1:34:04] He had the identification of God. See,
[1:34:07] he was in line of duty exactly what was
[1:34:12] promised for the age, not for the age of
[1:34:15] Noah, but for
[1:34:19] the age then. I will take you to the
[1:34:23] land that's flowing with milk and honey.
[1:34:26] They were on their way and Israel was
[1:34:29] identified with their prophet Moses with
[1:34:32] the message of the age.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; God's characteristics
[1:34:37] identified Moses.
[1:34:41] God's characteristics identify you.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; That's what we've come. We've entered
[1:34:48] into a union.
[1:34:50] So now what's identifies us is not our
[1:34:54] doctrine.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Everybody can take the doctrine.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Okay, you there's a lot of people that
[1:35:08] don't believe in the trinity.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that baptize in
[1:35:14] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:18] Don't think that the doctrines that we
[1:35:22] have are
[1:35:25] only
[1:35:27] we're the only ones that possess them.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; There's lots of people that do good
[1:35:34] works,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; but it's the character
[1:35:43] that separates.
[1:35:46] is the character that separates you and
[1:35:49] identifies you of not being a nominal
[1:35:53] believer of the age.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; It's where you walk.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; It's where you speak.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; It's how you treat other. It's the love
[1:36:03] of God shed abroad in your heart by the
[1:36:07] Holy Spirit.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; You possess that character.
[1:36:14] you you you he's expressing he wants to
[1:36:19] identify you. You're his spoken word.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; He wants to identify you. So, he's got
[1:36:25] to put his characteristics like he did
[1:36:28] Moses. Moses was identified with God by
[1:36:31] the characteristics that God put in him.
[1:36:35] Moses wants to identify God wants to
[1:36:38] identify himself in you as being his
[1:36:41] bride by the character that he puts in
[1:36:44] you.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope it's not I hope it's simple
[1:36:48] enough.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; It's it's everything. I'm going to close
[1:36:52] now. He's
[1:36:58] so Moses with the message of that age.
[1:37:01] God's characteristics identified Moses.
[1:37:04] A pillar of fire was following.
[1:37:07] He He also had atonement in action. Not
[1:37:12] speaking it, but had it in action.
[1:37:16] Now, what will be what is right now?
[1:37:24] Oh, I could go there for a long time.
[1:37:27] Just action. God deals with individuals.
[1:37:33] He is so unusual to the way of thinking.
[1:37:37] See, we get off in trends and we have to
[1:37:41] believe it this way. And then God comes
[1:37:45] around with his word, what he has
[1:37:48] promised and identifies himself in that
[1:37:52] word. This group can't go to it because
[1:37:56] it don't believe it. See, it's done. Cut
[1:37:59] itself off from them. So, what does he
[1:38:02] do? He identifies himself in his word.
[1:38:06] You understand that? Does the word of
[1:38:08] God say that he would have an elect lady
[1:38:11] in this day?
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; That's a promise.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; HE SAID SHE WOULD BE HERE.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; SO, she's here.
[1:38:26] So, we're we're not talking this morning
[1:38:29] from a standpoint of going forward of
[1:38:32] what you have to do.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to morning express to you
[1:38:39] what he's going to do for us.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; He spoke us.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; He called us.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; He's got to identify
[1:38:55] It's like the brand. Remember, they it
[1:38:58] didn't matter what brand, but they all
[1:38:59] had to be bloodline
[1:39:02] cattle.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; So, we're h how do how do how do we know
[1:39:07] ourselves from anybody else? It's an
[1:39:09] individual affair. You're known with
[1:39:12] YOUR CHRIST BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHRIST IN
[1:39:15] YOU.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; That's that's the only thing. It's not
[1:39:23] the group.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Christianity hasn't changed.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say this. I hope it's not
[1:39:33] misunderstood.
[1:39:35] Brother Bram never came to start the
[1:39:37] messages churches.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; That wasn't what he he wanted.
[1:39:47] He didn't want groups of ministers and
[1:39:49] groups of churches and groups of
[1:39:52] fellowship and and people. He wanted
[1:39:54] born again Christians.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; He wanted believers
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; that believed every word of God and
[1:40:05] wanted the spirit of Christ to dwell in
[1:40:07] them. Let this same spirit be in you
[1:40:10] that was in Christ Jesus who didn't look
[1:40:13] upon his own needs but looked upon the
[1:40:16] needs of all those around him.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; That that's what his desire was. It
[1:40:23] wasn't to go out and have a following.
[1:40:27] It wasn't to go out to have people
[1:40:30] identify
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Put on the hat. put on the jersey,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; put the book.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; That's never That's never what he was
[1:40:47] after.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; He wanted his word to become flesh.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Now, we're incapable of doing that.
[1:41:02] But when we're born again, when the word
[1:41:06] of God speaks to us and the Holy Spirit
[1:41:09] comes upon us, you you understand he he
[1:41:13] can't endure you with power if you don't
[1:41:16] have character.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Because character is the deliverance.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; It's his characteristics that deliver
[1:41:27] you. It's his character that keeps you
[1:41:30] from fighting, to arguing, punching at
[1:41:35] one another.
[1:41:37] He says it's like in the desert. He says
[1:41:40] when the there's no water of life, then
[1:41:43] you become real sticky, you know, and
[1:41:45] you're always punching.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; We don't have to go there.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; We have to let him live.
[1:41:58] He said,
[1:42:02] I trying to just lay a few of these
[1:42:05] things down.
[1:42:07] See, it was in action. God deals with
[1:42:09] individuals.
[1:42:11] And so, he's got to identify his word,
[1:42:14] right? So, when he when he spoke, he
[1:42:18] said, "A virgin shall conceive."
[1:42:21] Is that what he said?
[1:42:24] Well, then you know what has to happen?
[1:42:27] A virgin has to conceive.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "My sheep will know my voice."
[1:42:36] Then there has to be a sheep that knows
[1:42:38] his voice.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "If I've started a work in you,
[1:42:43] I'll finish it till the end." There has
[1:42:45] to be a people.
[1:42:47] So if he spoke that
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; if I started a work
[1:42:53] then we know a work has to be started
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; and if the work is started we know he'll
[1:42:59] finish it till the end.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; So our faith is in the word. Our
[1:43:04] character is that we believe that word.
[1:43:08] We believe in the kingdom to come. We
[1:43:11] believe we're going to identify and and
[1:43:14] live by his nature, by his
[1:43:16] characteristics. And his
[1:43:18] characteristics, him in you, identifies
[1:43:22] you as his.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; You can say, I believe Malachi 4:5 all
[1:43:28] you want. I met a lot of people that
[1:43:30] have robbed me blind
[1:43:34] in the name of the prophet.
[1:43:40] I've seen I've just seen preachers
[1:43:43] and I could go I'll get on a pity party
[1:43:46] here in a minute.
[1:43:48] I gave a man several thousand dollar
[1:43:51] worth of uniforms to sell. I said,
[1:43:53] "Whatever you sell them for, I'll split
[1:43:55] it with you." He loaded them up in his
[1:43:57] car and left.
[1:43:59] Took them and sold them.
[1:44:03] He didn't give me an offering.
[1:44:06] just rob me. And I think, what is that?
[1:44:11] There's no conscience.
[1:44:16] And you know, that's the thing that
[1:44:17] Satan does in this last hour is he
[1:44:20] snears your conscience with a hot iron.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; It's good that you're convicted of sin.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; It's good that you know when something's
[1:44:33] wrong.
[1:44:34] It's good that you have that feeling
[1:44:37] that you're on unstable ground.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; It's good that you feel that that that
[1:44:46] hand of of of caution
[1:44:50] and that conviction and that doubt to go
[1:44:53] down this road.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; But it's the character
[1:44:58] that listens to it.
[1:45:03] It's the character that lets him lead
[1:45:06] and guide you.
[1:45:09] It's not the belief.
[1:45:13] It's not the theology.
[1:45:17] It's character.
[1:45:19] Without perfect love, you won't be
[1:45:22] there. What What is the whole thing that
[1:45:25] we do so much with is the statue of a
[1:45:28] perfect man.
[1:45:30] We talk about all those characteristics,
[1:45:34] all those those things of character,
[1:45:37] faith, virtue, temperance, godliness,
[1:45:40] goodness, faith, you know, brotherly
[1:45:43] kindness, and then capped off with love.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; If if we don't miss it, then we don't
[1:45:53] understand what God's trying to do. He's
[1:45:56] he's trying to transform us into being
[1:46:01] sons and daughters of God with his
[1:46:04] character so he can stand in us and say,
[1:46:08] "This is my daughter.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; This is my son. I am revealed
[1:46:15] in them."
[1:46:21] Ask your heart.
[1:46:24] Is that what my heart's desire is? And
[1:46:27] I'm just I'm gonna read these last two
[1:46:29] statements and then we we have nine
[1:46:31] minutes and then we'll close. So,
[1:46:35] but this is paragraph 68. But you see,
[1:46:38] it has to be identified by the word.
[1:46:42] Who is the word?
[1:46:45] He is the word.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; It has to be identified by him.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; You don't identify yourself. He
[1:46:52] identifies you. It has to be identified
[1:46:55] by the word and the word is God. And
[1:46:58] then the characteristics
[1:47:01] of this ident identification
[1:47:04] identifies who it is.
[1:47:11] The characteristics of this
[1:47:13] identification identifies who it is.
[1:47:17] This is my bride.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; It identifies who you are. Your
[1:47:22] character identifies who you are.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Nothing else.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; One person might shout, a mother,
[1:47:31] another one might not.
[1:47:34] The prophet of God said that one guy got
[1:47:36] up there and he he spoke in tongues and
[1:47:40] he said he was a devil. The other guy
[1:47:42] interpreted he was genuine. He said,
[1:47:44] "How could this be? The rain falls on
[1:47:47] the just and the unjust.
[1:47:52] But he identifies himself.
[1:47:56] You say, "So what I'm in anticipation of
[1:48:00] for this my New Year's Day message, what
[1:48:02] I'm anticipation of is that this year,
[1:48:08] that character
[1:48:10] will be built in me
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; because that's the character that's
[1:48:15] going to deliver. God delivers by
[1:48:18] character. Give me the character
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; and I can defeat Satan.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; I can't defeat Satan in my flesh.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I can't defeat Satan with my willpower.
[1:48:32] I can't turn the other cheek. I can't
[1:48:35] close my eyes. I can't look the other
[1:48:37] way. I can't do that by my own strength.
[1:48:41] I can't do that by my doctrine. I can't
[1:48:44] do that by my association. I can only do
[1:48:48] that if it's his character in me
[1:48:51] strengthening me to do it.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm anticipating
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; that he's going to identify
[1:49:03] me
[1:49:05] myself as his bride by his
[1:49:10] characteristics.
[1:49:12] Not by what I say,
[1:49:14] but what that he does. Christ in you,
[1:49:18] the hope of glory. He says, identify who
[1:49:22] it is because God said this would happen
[1:49:25] and it happened. See, the
[1:49:27] characteristics of it is God's word
[1:49:31] being identified by the characteristics
[1:49:34] of what's going on.
[1:49:41] That's quite a little statement if you
[1:49:44] want to go back and read it. He said in
[1:49:46] the last days he'd pour out the Holy
[1:49:49] Ghost. He
[1:49:52] He did it. The characteristics of it
[1:49:55] identified that it was God. His word
[1:49:59] promised. See, he always identifies
[1:50:03] himself.
[1:50:04] Oh, if we could make a lesson out of
[1:50:09] that
[1:50:10] that there's so much today now you
[1:50:13] Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians,
[1:50:15] Lutheran, Catholic, whatever you are.
[1:50:18] See, you are doing the same thing. You
[1:50:22] are perceiving because that Wesley had a
[1:50:25] great revival or Luther had a great
[1:50:28] revival or Pentecost had a great
[1:50:31] revival. You are perceiving that he's
[1:50:34] among the people. When sometimes he
[1:50:38] isn't
[1:50:39] there.
[1:50:44] How do you know he's there? When he's
[1:50:46] identifying
[1:50:48] his word.
[1:50:51] I'd like to now if if you
[1:50:54] would allow
[1:50:57] I'm going to play the prayer line
[1:51:01] at the end of this service.
[1:51:04] [snorts] So he basically said that if
[1:51:06] God makes a promise,
[1:51:09] he has to identify that promise by his
[1:51:13] characteristics.
[1:51:15] That's a principle.
[1:51:17] So I can apply that same principle to
[1:51:20] me.
[1:51:24] Now I want you to listen as our prophet
[1:51:27] starts this prayer line and he'll say
[1:51:30] that's not me. It's him identifying
[1:51:35] himself that he's here.
[1:51:41] That's the first fruit
[1:51:45] that's waved out over.
[1:51:47] So we can either go into
[1:51:52] a endless cycle
[1:51:57] of trying and trying or by faith
[1:52:03] we can say Lord you spoke it.
[1:52:07] You've must identify it.
[1:52:10] And that goes for healing. It goes for
[1:52:13] whatever that you're facing.
[1:52:17] If God be for you, who can be against
[1:52:21] you? [snorts]
[1:52:23] I I can look at the stain on my white
[1:52:27] shirt
[1:52:29] and be dreadful that that stain's there.
[1:52:33] I can say, "Oh, I've got to throw this
[1:52:35] shirt away. I've got to get a new one."
[1:52:38] So, I go get a new shirt. And what do
[1:52:40] you think I'm going to do next time I
[1:52:41] eat gravy?
[1:52:44] I'll have a stack
[1:52:47] of dirty shirts that I'll never wear
[1:52:50] again. But I know that there's something
[1:52:53] that can cleanse that stain out.
[1:53:00] So, I'm not going to just keep beating
[1:53:02] myself up,
[1:53:06] but I'm going to become mindful
[1:53:09] that when I put my hand on the table and
[1:53:12] eat like this, I'm going to get gravy on
[1:53:15] my sleeve.
[1:53:18] Now, I'm going to make adjustments.
[1:53:21] Old habits are hard to break, I know.
[1:53:25] But I'm going to get character.
[1:53:28] I'm going to start doing the things that
[1:53:30] I know. I'm not going to I'm not going
[1:53:33] to start riding so close to the edge.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to start being mindful. I'm
[1:53:39] going to have character. I'm going to
[1:53:41] stay with the word. I'm going to read my
[1:53:44] Bible and pray. And it's but believe it
[1:53:46] or not, it becomes the character that
[1:53:49] delivers you. God delivers by character.
[1:53:54] By identifying himself and putting
[1:53:57] himself in you and letting those virtues
[1:54:00] come out, he identifies you. So Lord
[1:54:04] richly bless you. But if and you'll be
[1:54:07] able to follow along here. Paragraph 221
[1:54:12] out of God's identified by his
[1:54:14] characteristic
[1:54:15] uh March 20th, 1964.
[1:54:23] Now, now if Jesus is alive and I've
[1:54:26] talked of his word, there you are back
[1:54:28] to that simplicity and faith believing
[1:54:31] his word. When he met me that night, he
[1:54:34] said, "You'll come to pass that you'll
[1:54:35] even know the secrets of their heart.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; They won't believe that first sign of
[1:54:40] the hand. They will have to believe this
[1:54:41] one."
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; If they don't do that, then blood curses
[1:54:44] the earth just like it did in Moses
[1:54:46] time. said, "If them two signs and pour
[1:54:49] blood upon the earth,
[1:54:51] pour water upon the earth, it'll become
[1:54:53] blood."
[1:54:56] Now, just uh find out if I can just see
[1:54:59] what your trouble is. That'll be
[1:55:01] satisfying, make you believe what you
[1:55:02] know what have to be the characteristic
[1:55:04] of the person I'm talking about, Jesus
[1:55:06] Christ. A man, as I look at him, moves
[1:55:09] back, he's shattered.
[1:55:12] There isn't a thing that medicine would
[1:55:14] ever help the man. He's in a dying
[1:55:16] condition. That's right. He's had an
[1:55:19] operation and the operation was a
[1:55:22] prostate operation and it's cancer and
[1:55:25] the cancer scattered all through you.
[1:55:27] That's right. Raise up your hand.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Only God can heal you.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; But look,
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; I want to say something to you, sir.
[1:55:34] That devil might have hid from the
[1:55:36] doctor's knife, but he can't hide from
[1:55:37] God.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:55:41] And I pray that in the name of Jesus
[1:55:43] Christ, may the thing leave and may the
[1:55:45] man live.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Nothing just got weak.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:55:55] You and I are strangers to each other. A
[1:55:58] man and a woman meets. Now, as a man, I
[1:56:01] don't know you. And perhaps as a woman,
[1:56:04] you don't know me.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; No more than you just see my name or
[1:56:07] picture or something like that.
[1:56:08] Hallelujah.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; But we don't know one another. That's
[1:56:10] our character. We don't know one other
[1:56:12] character. But the characteristic of
[1:56:14] Christ.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; He's the word and the word is promised
[1:56:18] for this day. You heard me speak of it.
[1:56:21] Then his characteristics would identify
[1:56:24] him here. Not me identify him. I don't
[1:56:26] know you. You understand God. You
[1:56:29] understand that?
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; I'm a man. I'm just your brother.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Like the woman at the well.
[1:56:38] Say [snorts] something's wrong.
[1:56:40] Something is wrong with you or what you
[1:56:42] want or what you're here for. Let God be
[1:56:44] the judge of that.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; You are suffering from anemia condition.
[1:56:50] That is right. Is it?
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; I I constantly hit that somebody
[1:56:53] thinking I guessed it. I don't guess
[1:56:55] that.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; No. Every once in a while I feel that
[1:56:59] somebody you can't hide your thoughts.
[1:57:00] Now
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; he's about I know two real bad skeptics
[1:57:04] sitting here. So now remember I can call
[1:57:07] your name too. It's gone. So you quit
[1:57:10] thinking. Let me show you. Look here
[1:57:12] lady. Look at me. I don't know what he
[1:57:14] told you.
[1:57:16] But I I know what he is. And that's his
[1:57:18] characteristic identified. Yes. It's
[1:57:21] anemma condition of blood water.
[1:57:24] Now
[1:57:26] here here's something
[1:57:29] if they think this is
[1:57:32] got a child you're praying for that you
[1:57:36] It's got u in his throat,
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; tonsils, adoids. It's up for an
[1:57:41] operation, isn't right? Take that hand
[1:57:43] and put on it and bleed. Don't doubt it.
[1:57:45] Won't need
[1:57:49] to.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; How do you do?
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; The thing is
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; for this woman here that you are scared
[1:57:58] about something. You're afraid that a
[1:58:01] birth mark
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; has turned to cancer. Woo.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Now go believing. It won't be that way.
[1:58:08] Just go believing with all your heart
[1:58:10] characteristics. Not of me, of him.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; You believe now. That should make
[1:58:16] everybody believe.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know you. I'm a stranger to
[1:58:24] you. God knows you. Do you believe that?
[1:58:28] You know that I don't know. You know you
[1:58:29] don't know me. So do you believe that
[1:58:31] this spirit that's speaking cannot be my
[1:58:34] spirit because me as a man I don't know
[1:58:36] you. But the characteristic
[1:58:39] of the promised word is the word that's
[1:58:43] sharper than a two-edged sword and
[1:58:44] discerns the thoughts and intents of the
[1:58:46] heart.
[1:58:49] You are very sick. If you had a woman's
[1:58:51] trouble, which was a wound, and that
[1:58:54] womb had cancer, and you went and taken
[1:58:56] some sort of a treatment, his radiant
[1:58:58] treatment, and the only thing it done is
[1:59:00] scattered all through you, and you
[1:59:02] you'll die if God don't heal you. That's
[1:59:04] true. You believe now, he will heal you.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; May the God of heaven rebuke that devil
[1:59:09] that's hid from the doctor. You might
[1:59:11] have hide from raging, but up from the
[1:59:12] Holy Ghost. Don't believe me, my sister.
[1:59:14] Don't doubt it all. I believe.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that God can heal that
[1:59:21] asthma condition, make you well?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; You believe it? Then go on your road
[1:59:24] rejoicing and saying, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:26] I believe my asthma was done." How do
[1:59:28] you do?
[1:59:30] You're nervous. You've been nervous for
[1:59:32] a long time. In that, it's caused a
[1:59:33] peptic ulcer to come your stomach, which
[1:59:35] makes you your stomach trouble. You want
[1:59:37] you going to eat your supper? Will you
[1:59:38] do what I tell you to do? Go eat in the
[1:59:40] name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:59:44] Do you believe with all your heart your
[1:59:46] mighty fine young lady looks to be? Do
[1:59:48] you believe he'd be his servant? You
[1:59:50] believe his characteristic can be here
[1:59:52] to the word itself, the promise of this
[1:59:54] day, the works that I do shall you also
[1:59:57] can't heal. He's already did that. But
[1:59:59] his characteristic can tell what's wrong
[2:00:01] with you. You got a lady's trouble,
[2:00:04] female trouble. You believe that God
[2:00:06] heals it now? Go on your road in my
[2:00:07] body.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be his servant?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If God will tell me what's
[2:00:13] your trouble, when you believe it's a
[2:00:14] characteristic of Jesus Christ, it's in
[2:00:16] your body. It isn't no more. Go believe
[2:00:20] I'm
[2:00:21] You also have stomach trouble. Bleed
[2:00:23] with all your heart. Go eat your
[2:00:24] suffering. Forget about it. Jesus Christ
[2:00:26] makes you well.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Your trouble is your blood, your
[2:00:32] diabetes. You believe that God will make
[2:00:33] you well and heal you of that. Go on
[2:00:35] your road and say, "Thank you, Lord
[2:00:36] Jesus. Thank you." Go believe
[2:00:39] your back. You believe that God will
[2:00:41] heal the back and make you well. Go on
[2:00:43] your road and rejoice and say, "Thank
[2:00:44] you, Lord Jesus." You also had something
[2:00:46] wrong with your back. Just keep on
[2:00:47] walking, saying, "Thank you, Lord." I'm
[2:00:48] healed. Believe all your You also had
[2:00:51] back trouble. What do you know about
[2:00:53] that? Believe with all your heart, not
[2:00:54] go on your road and be made well.
[2:00:55] Believe Jesus Christ makes you well. If
[2:00:57] thou canst believe, all things are
[2:00:59] possible.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; All right. What if I didn't say nothing
[2:01:02] to you, just passed by, laid hands on
[2:01:04] you, Bisha, get well, they see what's
[2:01:05] wrong. You wouldn't come here.
[2:01:08] I resent this devil in the name of Jesus
[2:01:10] Christ. May the power of God heal your
[2:01:13] doubt. No doubt.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; If God doesn't heal you, you'll be on a
[2:01:19] crutch someday with arthritis. But you
[2:01:21] believe that God heals your arthritis.
[2:01:22] Then go say, "Thank you, Lord. I believe
[2:01:24] you and you make me well."
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Come now.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; It's really your age. You're real
[2:01:32] nervous. Get real nervous late in the
[2:01:33] evening when you're work and everything.
[2:01:35] You're real nervous. You bleed now. It
[2:01:37] won't bother anymore. Go on your road.
[2:01:39] Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." Come, sir.
[2:01:41] Do you believe that God heals heart
[2:01:42] trouble will make your heart well? Just
[2:01:44] keep on moving. Say, "Thank you, Lord. I
[2:01:46] believe with all your heart." God heals
[2:01:48] TV and makes well too. Do you believe
[2:01:49] that, sir, with all your heart? All
[2:01:51] right. Go on your rejoice and say,
[2:01:52] "Thank you, Lord." What about you out
[2:01:54] there? Do you believe?
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; How about the audience?
[2:01:58] Right.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Some of you in the audience now believe
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; this man sitting right here with
[2:02:07] bronchitis. You believe that God will
[2:02:09] heal the bronical trouble? All right.
[2:02:11] You're going to have what you'd ask for.
[2:02:13] Amen. High blood pressure sitting right
[2:02:16] behind him. Do you believe that God will
[2:02:17] heal your high blood? It left you, sir.
[2:02:19] I don't know him. Never seen him in my
[2:02:21] life. Say, sir, do you believe them
[2:02:23] spasms in your muscles, nervous muscle
[2:02:25] spasms? You believe that God will make
[2:02:27] it well? You do? Raise up your hand if
[2:02:28] you believe. All right. Your wife
[2:02:30] sitting there, she's bothered with sinus
[2:02:32] trouble. You believe it leaves you too,
[2:02:33] sister? The lady sitting right behind us
[2:02:35] there has new ritis. Do you believe it
[2:02:36] God will heal your newest lady? Here's a
[2:02:38] lady with a little red coat on here.
[2:02:40] She's sitting there. She has sinus
[2:02:41] trouble, too. You believe God will heal
[2:02:42] your sinus trouble? Raise up your hand
[2:02:44] if you believe it. ANYBODY IN HERE THAT
[2:02:46] BELIEVES THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
[2:02:48] JESUS CHRIST is among us tonight, raise
[2:02:50] up your hand. Say, "I believe it."
[2:02:53] ALL THAT'S IN HERE WILL ACCEPT HIM AS
[2:02:55] YOUR HEALER. Stand up on your feet and
[2:02:57] say, "I believe it." Raise up. Stand up
[2:02:59] OUT OF YOUR CHAIRS. WHATEVER IT IS,
[2:03:02] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[2:03:04] and forever. I give him to you in the
[2:03:07] name of the Lord God.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you just caught a glimpse of
[2:03:17] what I'm saying. God's identified by his
[2:03:21] characteristic.
[2:03:22] That was the promised word
[2:03:26] and he identified it as being the
[2:03:28] promised word.
[2:03:30] But you're the promised word.
[2:03:34] The brideath made herself ready. The
[2:03:37] elect lady,
[2:03:39] he'll identify you by his
[2:03:42] characteristics.
[2:03:43] Let us pray. Amen. And those of you who
[2:03:46] have stood up to claim your healing, the
[2:03:49] characteristic of the foundation of the
[2:03:51] believer is faith. A revelation
[2:03:55] that Jesus Christ is here with us,
[2:03:59] possessing all of the same
[2:04:01] characteristics
[2:04:03] he's ever had all through the ages. He's
[2:04:07] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:04:11] He forgives the sins that we confess to
[2:04:14] him.
[2:04:16] If we touch the hem of his garment,
[2:04:19] he's just in faithful to strengthen us.
[2:04:25] Father, may we do a real
[2:04:28] self-examination
[2:04:32] of our lives,
[2:04:34] ask ourselves, how entangled [music]
[2:04:38] are we with the affairs of the world?
[2:04:46] And how conscious
[2:04:50] are we of
[2:04:52] your presence amongst us?
[2:04:58] Every bit the same. You manifested
[2:05:01] yourself.
[2:05:03] took a vessel and
[2:05:06] stood right in our midst using that
[2:05:08] vessel to manifest yourself that you're
[2:05:11] here for your elect lady
[2:05:14] to have an invisible union between the
[2:05:16] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[2:05:18] bride.
[2:05:20] Lord, may we understand that.
[2:05:24] May we get a vision in our hearts of
[2:05:27] what that you're doing
[2:05:29] that that you're
[2:05:32] Oh, may we die to everything other than
[2:05:34] your wonderful character. I just ask
[2:05:37] [music] that you help us and bless us.
[2:05:41] Father, if there's one amongst us this
[2:05:43] [music] morning that would like to lift
[2:05:45] their hand
[2:05:47] and they say, "I'd like to know Jesus
[2:05:51] more.
[2:05:54] I'd like to become more acquainted with

[2:06:30] I really need to apply the token
[2:06:34] to my life.
[2:06:40] And I am asking you to perform that work
[2:06:44] in me
[2:06:46] because I believe that I'm yours.
[2:06:50] And my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:06:54] and that you will place your
[2:06:56] characteristics [music]
[2:06:58] and your character
[2:07:00] in me.
[2:07:02] Father, I hope that this principle that
[2:07:04] we spoke this morning,
[2:07:09] I may have not as a minister, as a
[2:07:12] speaker,
[2:07:14] been able to express it properly,
[2:07:16] [music] Father, but I believe that you
[2:07:19] can give divine revelation
[2:07:21] to the heart of every hungry heart.
[2:07:26] Father, [music] how do we know that this
[2:07:29] word is true?
[2:07:32] Because we saw it identified [music]
[2:07:36] exactly by your characteristic
[2:07:40] [music] and it's never been able to be
[2:07:42] duplicated since
[2:07:46] because there's only one promise for
[2:07:48] this [music] age.
[2:07:50] Now, we ask you to bless each heart as
[2:07:52] they go.
[2:07:55] Father, it's just our one service this
[2:07:57] morning.
[2:08:00] We'll come back together Wednesday
[2:08:02] night. Father, may we just start a more
[2:08:05] dedicated journey this [music] week
[2:08:07] [snorts] on the principle
[2:08:10] of your character
[2:08:13] in us
[2:08:15] is our [music] hope.
[2:08:17] If Christ Jesus be in you,
[2:08:20] all things are possible.
[2:08:23] And if the same spirit that [music]
[2:08:25] dwelt in Jesus Christ dwell in you, it
[2:08:27] will also quicken your mortal body.
[2:08:31] Father, I ask you to grant it and bless
[2:08:34] it to the people. [music]
