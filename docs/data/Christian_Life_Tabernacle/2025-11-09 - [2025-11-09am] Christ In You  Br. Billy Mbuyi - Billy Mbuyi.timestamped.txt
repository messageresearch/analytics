[7:30] Blessed with the clever to come and open
[7:32] the service in a word of prayer.
[7:38] Let us pray.
[7:40] Gracious heavenly father, we thank you
[7:42] Lord as we've [music] sung that you are
[7:45] here based on a promise in your word
[7:47] that wherever two or three are gathered
[7:49] in my name, I will be there. So Lord, we
[7:52] [music] we have friendships with one
[7:55] another. We enjoy each other's company,
[7:57] but we came here Lord to have an
[7:59] audience with you. And we pray father
[8:02] that you may [clears throat] speak to
[8:04] each and every individual person in this
[8:06] room only in a way that you can.
[8:08] Language [music] is not a barrier for
[8:10] you. You know our desires even before we
[8:12] have them and even before we ask them. I
[8:15] pray you may minister to every single
[8:17] heart Lord. Those that are brokenhearted
[8:20] that you may comfort them. Those that
[8:21] are needy that you may provide for them.
[8:23] We know Lord thou art a God that does
[8:25] exceedingly abundantly over what could
[8:27] ask or think. We pray for your word as
[8:29] it comes forth. May the minister, Lord,
[8:31] be be able to speak what you put on his
[8:35] mouth. Lord, may you open our hearts to
[8:37] receive and anoint our ears to hear and
[8:40] our minds to understand. We thank you
[8:42] for all these things, even the song
[8:44] service. Lord, may you be with all the
[8:46] songs we'll sing. In the name of Jesus
[8:48] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[8:53] As we stand, we'll turn to our psalm
[8:54] reading. We'll read in Psalm 6.
[9:05] It's it's a short psalm, so let's just
[9:07] read it all together from the 1st to the
[9:09] 10th.
[9:11] It reads, "Oh Lord, rebuke me not in
[9:14] thine anger, neither chastened me in thy
[9:17] heart displeasure. Have mercy upon me, O
[9:21] Lord, for I am weak. Oh Lord, heal me,
[9:24] for my bones are vexed. My soul is also
[9:28] sore vexed. But thou, oh Lord, how long?
[9:31] Return, O Lord, deliver my soul. Oh,
[9:35] save me for thy mercy's sake. For in
[9:38] death there is no remembrance of thee.
[9:40] In the grave, who shall give thee
[9:42] thanks? I am weary with the groaning.
[9:46] All the night may guide my bed to swim.
[9:49] I water my couch with my tears. Mine eye
[9:52] is consumed because of grief. It waxeth
[9:56] old because of all mine enemies. Depart
[9:59] from me all ye workers of iniquity. For
[10:02] the Lord hath heard the voice of my
[10:04] weeping. The Lord had heard my
[10:06] supplication. The Lord will receive my
[10:09] prayer. Let all mine inities be ashamed
[10:12] and sore vexed. Let them return and be
[10:15] ashamed suddenly. Amen. May the Lord
[10:18] have a blessing to the reading of his
[10:20] word. You can turn around and shake
[10:21] somebody's hand. You may be seated.
[10:23] Let's sing Come and Dine.
[10:27] [clears throat]
[10:31] [music]
[10:32] Jesus had [singing] a table spread where
[10:35] the saints of God are fed. He imparts
[10:39] his chosen people come and die.

[10:48] king. Oh sweet to ser Jesus all the

[21:08] Bless you.
[21:11] How many enjoyed the message last Sunday
[21:14] about
[21:15] the vision that God had offer you and
[21:19] realizing that it's not even about us?
[21:21] It's about God expressing himself and he
[21:24] predestinated a right to be there and so
[21:27] that his word can be fulfilled. So he
[21:29] predestinated our lives so his purpose
[21:31] could be accomplished. So there's a song
[21:34] I grew up listening to a lot. I I doubt
[21:37] our musicians know it. So it'll be a
[21:39] little bit of throwing a
[21:42] a ringer into
[21:44] how they do things. But um I it is a
[21:47] blessing. Maybe a little bit of an ac
[21:48] capella, but if you know it, feel free
[21:50] to join it. So um I'll just start.
[21:54] So it's called justified. It it says he
[21:57] looked at your perfect picture without
[22:00] spot or wrinkle. He didn't look at you
[22:02] where you are now. He looked
[22:05] &gt;&gt; right back from eternity. He said you're
[22:07] just trapped in that body. You bypassed
[22:10] your theophony. If you've not done it in
[22:13] the first place, you're justified. So
[22:14] you may know it. If if you don't if you
[22:16] want to join me as I sing it, please do.
[22:20] I was sitting alone and wondering
[22:25] about what I'm supposed to do. I can't
[22:30] deny. At times I make mistakes. I can
[22:35] hide from him. He knew.
[22:39] But I knew that deep within my soul I
[22:44] felt sorry. Honest I did. So I just
[22:48] cried and said, "Forgive me, Lord.
[22:53] Forgive me again. Will you
[22:57] justify?"
[23:01] [snorts] Justified.
[23:05] You have not done it in the first
[23:09] [singing] place. You're justified.
[23:14] Justified.
[23:19] justified.
[23:23] You have not done it in the first place.
[23:28] You're justified.
[23:33] So often I'm discouraged [music]
[23:37] when I count the times I fall. because
[23:42] he promised [singing] that I'll be
[23:44] victorious
[23:46] when I know that I'm not at all.
[23:51] Then I heard an eagle
[23:53] [singing and music]
[23:54] scream.
[23:55] Oh, its voice quickened my soul. He
[23:59] said, "You've [music and singing] not
[24:00] done it in the first place. You're
[24:04] justified."
[24:08] Oh, justified.
[24:13] Justified.
[24:17] You have [singing] not done it in the
[24:20] first place. [music] You're justified.
[24:26] Justified.
[24:31] Justified.
[24:35] You have [singing and music] not done it
[24:37] in the first place. You're justified.
[24:45] He looked at your [music and singing]
[24:46] perfect picture
[24:48] without blame, spot, or wrinkle.
[24:53] He didn't look at you [music]
[24:56] where you are now. He looked right from
[24:59] eternity. [singing]
[25:01] He said, "You're [music] just trapped in
[25:04] that [singing] body.
[25:06] You bypassed your theophony.
[25:10] You have not done it [music] in the
[25:13] first place. You're justified."
[25:17] Let's sing it together. Oh, justified.
[25:23] [music]
[25:24] Justified. [singing]
[25:27] Oh, you have not done [music] it in the
[25:31] first place. You're justified.
[25:37] Justified.
[25:41] Oh, [music and singing]
[25:41] justified.
[25:45] Oh, you have not done it in the first
[25:49] place. You're justified.
[25:52] Let's sing [music] that last verse
[25:53] together.
[25:55] Oh, he looked at your perfect picture
[25:59] without blame spot [music] or wrinkle.
[26:04] He [singing] didn't look at you where
[26:06] you are now. He looked [music] right
[26:09] from eternity.
[26:12] He said you're just trapped [music] in
[26:14] the body. You bypassed your theophony.
[26:21] You have not done it in the first place.
[26:25] You're justified.
[26:28] Oh, I'm justified.
[26:33] Oh, justified.
[26:38] Oh, you have not done it in the first
[26:42] place. You're justified.
[26:47] Justified.
[26:51] Oh, justine. [singing and music]
[26:56] You had not done it in the first place.
[27:00] You're justified.
[27:04] You had not [singing and music] done it
[27:07] in the first place. You're justified.
[27:13] [applause and music]
[27:19] Hallelujah.
[27:21] You have not done it in the first place.
[27:23] You're justified. Amen.
[27:28] Just have a
[27:34] couple of announcements. We want to
[27:36] remember our pastor. He's out preaching.
[27:40] I believe he should be heading back uh
[27:42] tomorrow. I believe brother Matthew is
[27:44] also out preaching. We want to keep him
[27:46] in prayer for the young people for our
[27:49] meetings. We know our meetings is coming
[27:51] up. For one, we would like to have
[27:54] everybody there to come and support.

[28:22] practice after service in the fellowship
[28:24] hall. Please [music] be prompt for an

[40:24] Oh my heart. [singing]
[40:32] [music]
[40:33] [singing]
[40:39] Let's just bow to our heads this
[40:40] morning. [music] Father, truly we could
[40:42] say that song is our heart's desire just
[40:45] being expressed. this morning, Father,
[40:48] [music] the your prophet will say that
[40:50] there's not one that has ever heard of
[40:53] you and I never want to see you, Lord.
[40:55] And Father, but the true believer when
[40:57] they hear of you, there's something in
[40:59] their hearts that really want to see
[41:01] you, Father, not with the eyes, but we
[41:03] could see you for who you really are,
[41:05] Lord. And and let you be revealed in our
[41:08] lives this morning. Father, we come this
[41:10] morning with all our weaknesses and our
[41:13] incapabilities and our trials and our
[41:15] temptation. Father, we know one thing
[41:18] that you purchased for all of those
[41:20] things that this morning [music] we can
[41:22] claim and and and be claiming you and
[41:25] know that in Christ we have all that we
[41:27] have need of. [music] Precious Father,
[41:30] those people we've gathered here this
[41:31] morning. Lord, I believe with all my
[41:34] heart that there's all kinds of need
[41:35] represented this morning in this
[41:37] building. But Lord, we know one thing
[41:39] that we serve a God that's above all our
[41:41] needs and our requests and our trials
[41:44] and our everything. May you come by the
[41:47] way of the word this morning and
[41:48] minister to your people. Father, may
[41:50] your word speak to our hearts that we
[41:53] may receive this [music] morning that
[41:54] portion which you have allotted for this
[41:57] morning. Father, let us not go the same
[41:59] way that we came in. But Lord that
[42:01] through your word and through the
[42:03] scriptures and through the promises that
[42:05] you made Lord that we may become
[42:07] partakers of divine nature. We commit
[42:10] all that we are into your hands Lord
[42:12] every time we come to you Lord. Father
[42:15] Satan try to expose our flesh and our
[42:17] inabilities and all that we've done. But
[42:19] Lord, even as we heard the song this
[42:21] morning, that you look at us, oh Father,
[42:24] not from what we are this morning,
[42:26] [music] but you look at us from eternity
[42:28] and the purchase price that you already
[42:30] gave, Lord. And that's how we want to
[42:32] stand before you, Lord. And we stand
[42:34] before you with confidence knowing that
[42:37] [music] even though we can see it with
[42:39] our own eyes, Father, it means nothing
[42:41] but because you took away all our
[42:44] iniquity. Father, come and speak to our
[42:46] hearts, Lord. Come, Father, be the
[42:48] comforter this morning for whatever need
[42:51] of if there's need for healing and
[42:53] deliverance or whatever, Father, be the
[42:55] comforter and be the one who can supply
[42:57] all of those things, [music] we commit
[42:59] this service into your hands. And we ask
[43:01] this things in the lovely name of the
[43:03] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. God
[43:07] bless. You may have your seats just for
[43:09] a moment before we read our scriptures.
[43:12] Um, just want to emphasize once again on
[43:15] the uh uh the communication and the
[43:18] announcements that's been made. If you
[43:20] could put that flyer out there. So, our
[43:23] meetings are uh starting on Friday and
[43:26] uh I we we really want to do everything
[43:31] that we can uh to to come to church.
[43:35] Amen. I I I I can read quotes why you
[43:38] should be in church. I can do all of
[43:40] that, but I just want to add this
[43:42] morning that it's a blessing for us.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing for you. If you if
[43:48] you're going to miss work to come to the
[43:50] services, I believe with all my heart
[43:52] that God is obligated to return to you a
[43:56] hundfold.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Is that scripture? Is that the message?
[44:00] So, if we could do all that we can, I
[44:04] whether it be taking off or or whatever,
[44:06] if you need assistance with gas money or
[44:09] whatever, we're here to help so you can
[44:11] be in church. Amen. So, want everybody
[44:14] to come and and and if you get out of
[44:17] work late and you are in your work
[44:19] clothes and you're tired, you're hungry,
[44:21] we'll provide sandwiches. Amen. Well, if
[44:24] you need if you need us to provide you a
[44:26] change of clothes, we'll do that, too.
[44:28] Amen.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; We really want you to come to the house
[44:30] of God.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; So, so, uh, Brother Tom and brother
[44:36] Michael Ray will be ministering. So, uh,
[44:39] we want to come expecting. And they
[44:42] there's just something about special
[44:44] meetings that I believe with all my
[44:45] heart that there are things that happen
[44:48] in special meetings that otherwise don't
[44:50] happen in services like this. Why is is
[44:53] the way God set it? Because when we come
[44:55] to special meetings, our expectation is
[44:57] really high. People come and and and
[45:00] where expectation and desires and and we
[45:03] come on uh with one heart and one accord
[45:07] and uh one spirit. I believe that unity
[45:10] causes God to come down and do more.
[45:13] Amen. And that's how we want to do. We
[45:14] want to come and and do all that we can.
[45:17] So, uh, the the as the announcement was
[45:20] made, we want to make sure there'll be,
[45:22] uh, we have our service on Fridays at
[45:24] 700 p.m. Uh, uh, sandwiches will be
[45:27] provided after service. The fellowship
[45:29] service on Saturdays, uh, we will have
[45:33] barbecue, so it's going to be from 12 to
[45:35] 3:00 p.m. as listed on the board over
[45:38] there. And the service on Saturday will
[45:40] start at 6 pm.
[45:42] Um the Sunday service is at 11:00 a.m.
[45:46] for the morning service and the 6 pm our
[45:48] singing service. So we we really I
[45:52] believe that's part of what we do. We
[45:53] really enjoy our singing service and
[45:55] have many just come back to the house of
[45:57] God and and sing more services. So for
[45:59] parking, we really asking for those
[46:02] especially young people, if you can
[46:04] carpool, please do so. and all of our
[46:07] young people when you come in, just try
[46:09] to make sure you park in the very back
[46:11] uh by the Gaga ball on the wall side
[46:14] over there. So, you can uh we'll try to
[46:16] uh uh uh you be over there and so we can
[46:20] try to make uh uh parking available for
[46:22] everybody. And uh uh we want to
[46:24] apologize for the bathrooms. There's uh
[46:27] work that's being done. Uh we'll believe
[46:29] it'll be ready uh by Friday. Uh the
[46:32] contractors are still working on the
[46:34] women's bathroom to get it ready and
[46:36] everything. So the bathrooms are
[46:37] available for sisters in the old
[46:39] fellowship hall. There's one in the
[46:41] kitchen. So if you need just uh uh uh
[46:44] you can use that for now. Want to
[46:46] remember our pastor and and he's believe
[46:48] I believe he's preaching this morning.
[46:50] I'm not sure if he's already on the
[46:52] pulpit or not, but we want to just keep
[46:54] him on our heart this morning. Brother
[46:56] Matthew is in Tennessee preaching and
[46:58] brother Donnie. So we want to also just
[47:01] remember him this morning. Amen. How
[47:03] many are happy to be in the house of God
[47:05] this morning? How many I believe believe
[47:07] that it's a blessing to come to the
[47:09] house of God?
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand for our scripture
[47:12] reading this morning.
[47:18] Amen. Let's start in Colossians uh chap
[47:21] the the first chapter. will read um
[47:27] let's start from verse 22.
[47:36] Let's start from 19.
[47:41] It says for it pleased the father that
[47:43] in him should all fullness dwell.
[47:48] and having made peace through the blood
[47:52] of his cross
[47:54] by him to reconcile all things unto him.
[47:58] By him I say, whether be things in earth
[48:02] or things in heaven. And you that were
[48:07] sometimes alienated and enemies
[48:10] of your mind
[48:13] by wicked work.
[48:15] Yet now had he reconciled,
[48:19] think about that, in the body of his
[48:22] flesh through death to present you holy
[48:26] and unblamable
[48:29] and unreprovable
[48:31] in his sight. If ye continue in faith,
[48:35] grounded and settled, and be not move
[48:38] away from the hope of the gospel, which
[48:41] you have heard, which we was preached,
[48:44] through every uh creature which is under
[48:47] heaven, wherefore I Paul am a minister
[48:52] whom, it says, who now rejoice in his
[48:56] suffering for you and fill up
[49:00] that which is behind of the affliction
[49:04] of Christ in my flesh for his body's
[49:08] sake, which is the church.
[49:12] Wherefore am I a minister according to
[49:14] the dispensation of God, which is given
[49:18] to me for you to fulfill the word of
[49:20] God, even the mystery which had hid from
[49:24] ages and from generation, but now is
[49:28] made manifest to s to his saints. To
[49:31] whom to whom God made known
[49:38] that which that what is the riches of
[49:40] the glory of the mystery among the
[49:42] Gentile which is Christ in you the hope
[49:45] of glory whom we preach warning every
[49:48] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[49:52] that we may present every man perfect in
[49:56] Christ Jesus. I want you to realize
[49:58] that. So the preaching of Christ in you
[50:01] is that at the end that every man may be
[50:04] presented righteous. You may be seated.
[50:07] Keep your Bible open. We're going to
[50:09] read one more. Uh let's read in Romans
[50:11] chapter 1.
[50:17] Romans chapter 1.
[50:20] Um
[50:22] and let's start from
[50:26] uh
[50:28] [snorts] verse 9. It says, "But ye are
[50:30] not in the flesh, but ye are in the
[50:33] spirit. If if so be that the spirit of
[50:36] God dwells in you. Now if any man have
[50:40] not the spirit of Christ, he is none of
[50:42] his. And if Christ be in you, the body
[50:46] is dead because of sin, but the spirit
[50:49] is life because of righteousness.
[50:52] But if the spirit of him that raisth
[50:55] Christ from the dead dwell in you, that
[50:58] uh he that raisth Christ from the dead
[51:00] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[51:03] his spirit that dwell in you. Therefore,
[51:06] brethren, we are not debtors. We are we
[51:09] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[51:12] after the flesh. But if we live
[51:16] but if we live after the flesh ye shall
[51:18] die. But if you live through the spirit
[51:22] do mortify but if ye through the spirit
[51:25] do motify the dead of the flesh ye shall
[51:27] live. For as many that are led as many
[51:30] as are led by the spirit of God they are
[51:34] the sons of God. For ye are not, ye have
[51:38] not received the spirit of bondage again
[51:40] to fear, but ye have received the spirit
[51:43] of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba,
[51:46] Father." The spirit of it, the spirit
[51:49] itself beareth witness, we are without
[51:53] spirit that we are the children of God.
[51:56] And if children, then hes of God and
[51:59] join with Christ. If so be that we
[52:02] suffer with him, that we may also
[52:05] glorify together. For I reckon that the
[52:08] suffering of this present time are not
[52:11] worthy to be compared with the glory
[52:13] which shall be revealed in us. For the
[52:16] earnest expectation of the creature
[52:18] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[52:20] of God. For the creature was made
[52:22] subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
[52:26] reason of him who has subjected the same
[52:29] in hope, because the creature itself
[52:32] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[52:34] of corruption
[52:36] into the glorious liberty of the
[52:39] children of God. For we know that the
[52:42] whole creation groanth and travaleth in
[52:45] pain together until now, and all only
[52:49] they also which have the first fruit of
[52:53] the spirit, even we all ourselves grown
[52:57] within ourselves, waiting for the
[53:00] adoption to with the redemption of our
[53:04] bodies. Let's just bow our heads.
[53:05] Gracious father, we ask that you bless
[53:07] your word to us in Jesus name we pray.
[53:09] Amen.
[53:11] To this morning, I just want to speak
[53:13] for a little bit this morning. Um the
[53:17] the thought that really came to my heart
[53:20] um as I was looking at this um
[53:24] give me a second
[53:37] is um Christ in you.
[53:42] Christ in you. And no doubt I you you
[53:48] say I've heard of that before and I I
[53:51] could say I I did the same. But just
[53:55] this morning uh not this morning, but
[53:58] just studying this, it just kind of
[54:00] opened up to me uh what even what even
[54:03] what that means. And I said, do I even
[54:06] myself understand when I say Christ in
[54:09] me, what does that even mean? Uh because
[54:13] if you if you I was even talking about
[54:17] Andrew in the back. We our pastor has
[54:19] been preaching and he touched on the
[54:22] message the uh invisible union. And and
[54:25] if you look at the invisible union, God
[54:28] tells you who you really are and where
[54:30] you came from. And and if you go back
[54:33] now and listen to Christ the mystery of
[54:36] God revealed in God in that message is
[54:39] actually walking you through the process
[54:42] that it took so you can understand what
[54:45] invisible union is there for. So Christ
[54:48] the mystery of of God revealed is
[54:51] basically the process by which God laid
[54:54] the hope land a and and and accomplished
[54:57] the hope land. So at the end when the
[55:00] revelation is made known you will
[55:02] understand what has been happening for
[55:04] ages since the beginning of time. So we
[55:07] when we look at it when we say Christ in
[55:10] us we I want us this morning to to
[55:13] understand that Christ in you is the
[55:17] reason for the whole entire creation.
[55:20] That one statement when when I say
[55:23] Christ in you is the reason for the
[55:26] galaxy, the world, the planets, the
[55:30] everything that you see. It's all based
[55:32] on the one reason, one statement. Christ
[55:35] in you. Christ in you was God desire to
[55:39] have fellowship with another God.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Christ in you is is the whole plan of
[55:46] redemption. God wanting to after after
[55:49] he's created seas and he's created trees
[55:52] and is created. He wasn't satisfied
[55:55] until he saw someone that looked like
[55:58] himself.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Christ in you is the desire for God to
[56:02] have fellowship. Christ in you is the
[56:04] beginning and the ending of the whole
[56:06] mystery.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; That's why I said I I I asked myself, do
[56:11] I even understand what that means? Well,
[56:14] and let me say this. What the devil is
[56:17] fighting us for is not that we don't
[56:20] have a God in heaven. He knows everybody
[56:22] believes that. It's not that we had
[56:24] Christ that came and died for us. He
[56:26] knows all the churches on the streets
[56:28] believe that. But what the devil is
[56:31] fighting us this morning is the
[56:33] revelation of Christ abiding in you this
[56:35] morning. is the revelation that we are
[56:39] not made to be just a bunch of people
[56:42] that come here to have wives, to have
[56:44] children and work and do all that we can
[56:47] and then somehow we do enough good to go
[56:49] back in heaven. No, that the whole
[56:51] purpose, the whole mystery of creation
[56:54] was that God wanted to have a bride.
[56:57] that God wanted to create somebody that
[57:00] look like him, somebody that talk like
[57:02] him, somebody that he can have
[57:04] fellowship with, somebody that he can
[57:07] say and they will understand that they
[57:09] will be on the same level with. God
[57:11] didn't want, let me say this, when he
[57:13] wanted to be God, he created angels for
[57:15] that.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; When he wanted to be God, he made the
[57:18] creation for that. But that was not the
[57:21] purpose for your creation. Your creation
[57:24] was to be exactly like he was so you can
[57:27] be beside him that he can talk and have
[57:30] fellowship with you.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So Christ in you is the whole thing. BUT
[57:38] WHEN SAYS CHRIST IN YOU, HE SAYS CHRIST
[57:40] IS THE CENTER OF THE WHOLE BIBLE.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So when we say it's the we
[57:49] we we if I could just and I'm trying to
[57:52] just
[57:55] &gt;&gt; the understanding that God had a purpose
[57:58] in the beginning that included you the
[58:01] the purpose and let me say this when not
[58:05] that included you as an afterthought but
[58:07] the main character in the whole process.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? You were
[58:14] the reason for the creation.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; He He COULD HAVE DWELLED ALONE. HE COULD
[58:20] HAVE JUST CREATED angels and and then
[58:23] just be WORSHIPED DAY AND NIGHT. BUT
[58:25] THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR. HE
[58:28] WAS LOOKING FOR FELLOWSHIP. SOMEONE THAT
[58:31] LOOKED LIKE HIM,
[58:33] &gt;&gt; SOMEONE THAT TALKED LIKE HIM, SOMEONE
[58:36] THAT ACTED LIKE HIM, SOMEONE THAT HE CAN
[58:38] TALK THAT WILL UNDERSTAND. LET ME SAY
[58:40] THIS. THE ANGELS DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT
[58:42] GOD IS TALKING ABOUT.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; THEY THEY WORSHIP HIM. HOLY, HOLY, HOLY.
[58:47] He will say and he WILL DIRECT THEM GO.
[58:49] I IF THEY GOD LOOKS AN ANGEL AND THEY
[58:51] SAID I'M A HEALER. THAT MEANS NOTHING TO
[58:54] THE ANGEL BUT IT MEANS SOMETHING FOR YOU
[58:57] THIS MORNING.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; SO CHRIST IN YOU IS THE REASON FOR THE
[59:05] ENTIRE THING. And let me say this. I'm
[59:09] just going to jump for a little bit. So,
[59:11] if I get too excited, forgive me. Uh,
[59:13] you know, I I I you know, I I just feel
[59:16] like uh uh these things are given for us
[59:19] to be living IN HEAVENLY PLACES. THEY'RE
[59:22] NOT GIVEN for us to be mortal PEOPLE
[59:25] THINKING LIKE MORTAL AND TALKING LIKE
[59:28] MORTAL, ACTING LIKE MORTAL. NO, THEY ARE
[59:30] GIVEN TO YOU SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE
[59:33] AND rearrange it and understand that the
[59:36] original purpose OF YOUR CREATION IS
[59:39] THAT SO YOU COULD BE GOD TO BEGIN WITH.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; SO, so there was uh the scripture would
[59:47] talk there was anything created. SO, GOD
[59:51] UH UH THOUGHTS of you in the beginning.
[59:54] You were not made uh uh uh to be just uh
[59:58] another portion of the creation but you
[1:00:01] were made to be part of the eternal. So
[1:00:04] remember the scripture says heaven and
[1:00:06] earth will pass away but my word shall
[1:00:08] never pass away. And let me even make
[1:00:10] the statement that's why the revealing
[1:00:12] of the end time when the prophet comes
[1:00:15] he says that you YOU COULDN'T EVEN YOU
[1:00:18] CAN'T YOU CANNOT OBTAIN ETERNAL LIFE
[1:00:20] UNLESS YOU HAD eternal life. So the
[1:00:23] reason why he's connecting that is he's
[1:00:25] wanting YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS IS ONLY
[1:00:28] THE MANIFESTATION OF WHAT ALREADY
[1:00:30] EXISTED THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT INTO VIEW.
[1:00:34] IT'S NOT SOMETHING NEW. IT'S ONLY
[1:00:36] EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING THAT'S
[1:00:38] BEEN MADE manifest in the end.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; SO SO SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE END TIME,
[1:00:44] IT GIVES US A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT WAS IN
[1:00:47] THE BEGINNING.
[1:00:49] SO THE GOD'S DESIRE, WHAT I'M WILL SAY
[1:00:52] IN uh uh God's a mystery of God uh uh
[1:00:55] Christ the mystery of God reveal and I'm
[1:00:57] paraphrasing this so I can just lay a
[1:00:59] foundation. GOD'S DESIRE WAS TO HAVE A
[1:01:02] FAMILY.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED TO BE A family man.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning?
[1:01:12] When you WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF, YOU
[1:01:14] SEE YOU HAVE CHILDREN AND YOU HAVE A
[1:01:16] WIFE AND YOU GO, YOU LAY YOUR LIFE DOWN,
[1:01:19] YOU SACRIFICE YOURSELF, YOU WORK, YOU DO
[1:01:21] ALL OF THAT WITH WITH THE OBJECTIVE, NO
[1:01:24] MATTER HOW THEY TREAT YOU, YOU STILL LAY
[1:01:26] YOUR LIFE DOWN FOR THEM. IT THAT'S NOT
[1:01:29] YOU. THAT'S THE ATTRIBUTE THAT WAS
[1:01:31] PLACED IN YOU so you CAN SEE WHO GOD IS.
[1:01:35] HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; I I I THINK SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT THE
[1:01:38] THE VERY heavenly thing or THE THINGS OF
[1:01:41] GOD ARE ALSO MANIFESTED IN THE NATURE.
[1:01:43] SO IT WASN'T AND I'M SAYING THAT TO SAY
[1:01:46] THAT IT'S A LOVE THAT'S WITHOUT UH H
[1:01:50] THAT'S GIVEN WITHOUT ANYTHING IN
[1:01:52] EXPECTATION.
[1:01:53] THE PART OF the human mind IS THAT EVERY
[1:01:56] TIME LOVE IS GIVEN or or a gift is given
[1:02:00] there's an expectation FOR SOMETHING
[1:02:01] BAD. BUT WHEN YOU COME TO THE LOVE OF
[1:02:04] GOD, THERE IS SUCH A LOVE WHERE IT'S
[1:02:07] GIVEN WITHOUT EVEN THE PERSON RECOGNIZE
[1:02:10] IT. WHEN THE PERSON WAS RUNNING AWAY,
[1:02:13] WHEN THE PERSON WAS DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING
[1:02:15] TO DO WITH IT, THEY WERE CRITICIZES AND
[1:02:18] CALL IT ALL KIND OF NAME. THAT LOVE WAS
[1:02:20] STILL THERE PRESENT KNOWING THAT IT WAS
[1:02:23] THERE GIVEN THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
[1:02:25] YOU WILL COME BACK to it.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; AND AND THAT'S WHEN WE SAY HE WANTED A
[1:02:31] FAMILY. HE WANTED SONS AND DAUGHTERS. HE
[1:02:34] DIDN'T JUST WANT ANGELS. HE WANTED
[1:02:36] PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE HIM. GOD DID NOT
[1:02:39] WANT TO DWELL ALONE.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Why is it we don't want to dwell alone?
[1:02:46] Why is it the scripture will tell us
[1:02:47] that a man shall live uh uh his family
[1:02:50] and he will attach himself to his wife
[1:02:52] and everything? IT IT'S NOT BY HAPPEN
[1:02:54] CHANCE. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT GOD
[1:02:57] ESTABLISHED EVEN WITHIN the mortal life.
[1:03:00] So we can understand the very MYSTERY OF
[1:03:02] WHAT GOD IS DOING. SO HIS NATURE, HIS
[1:03:06] LOVE UH WAS TO BE EXPRESSED. Are you
[1:03:10] with me this morning? SO IF GOD WAS
[1:03:13] LOVE, SOMEHOW THAT LOVE HAS TO COME INTO
[1:03:17] SOME FORM OF AN EXPRESSION.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; HE HE COULDN'T CLAIM TO BE LOVE AND
[1:03:24] NEVER HAVE A PLACE FOR HIM TO MANIFEST
[1:03:26] that love. HE COULDN'T CLAIM TO BE A
[1:03:30] SAVIOR AND NEVER HAVE A CHANCE TO
[1:03:32] MANIFEST THAT SAVING POWER. HE COULDN'T
[1:03:34] CLAIM TO be a healer and NEVER HAVE A
[1:03:37] POSITION BY WHICH AND LET ME SAY THAT HE
[1:03:40] COULDN'T MANIFEST THAT TO THE ANGELS. HE
[1:03:43] HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT LOOKED LIKE
[1:03:45] HIM.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; SO, AND GOD WANTED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF.
[1:03:56] HE WANTED TO BE A SAVIOR. HE WANTED TO
[1:03:58] BE ALL THOSE THINGS. AND HE WANTED TO BE
[1:04:00] A FATHER, A SAVIOR, HEALER, REDEEMER.
[1:04:03] AND ALL THOSE THINGS WERE WAITING to be
[1:04:05] uh uh uh uh expressed. SO GOD'S NATURE
[1:04:09] AND LET ME SAY this the and when I speak
[1:04:13] about God's nature,
[1:04:16] a nature, it's not it's something that
[1:04:20] that you were and you remain that way.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; You you with me this morning? SO IT'S
[1:04:26] BUT BUT SAID IT WILL TAKE ETERNITY FOR
[1:04:29] GOD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. SO THAT IF GOD
[1:04:32] IS A SAVIOR THAT NATURE OF SAVING
[1:04:36] CONTINUES.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; You understand? SO AND LET ME SAY THIS.
[1:04:40] THAT'S WHY GOD STILL SAVES THIS MORNING.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD STILL HEALS THIS MORNING.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; SO HE HE CANNOT HAVE A NATURE THAT
[1:04:49] SOMEHOW THROUGH THE PROCESS WILL STOP.
[1:04:51] AND LET ME SAY THIS. THAT'S WHY IT'S
[1:04:53] IMPORTANT WE REALIZE WHEN WE SAY CHRIST
[1:04:55] IN US, WHEN THE SAME NATURE COMES UPON
[1:04:58] YOU, IT WILL MANIFEST THE SAME
[1:05:00] ATTRIBUTES OF GOD IN YOU.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; So it's NOT A NATURE THAT STARTS IN GOD,
[1:05:08] BUT THEN WHEN YOU ARE SAVED, THE NATURE
[1:05:10] STOP. NO, THOSE THAT ARE PARTAKERS OF
[1:05:13] THE SAME NATURE WILL DISPLAY THE SAME
[1:05:15] ATTRIBUTES. AMEN.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; SO HE HE CONTINUALLY WHEN WHEN HE COMES
[1:05:23] AND AND THE PURPOSE FOR CHRIST IN YOU IS
[1:05:26] FOR GOD TO EXTEND OR TO CONTINUALLY
[1:05:30] EXPRESS THOSE SAME ATTRIBUTE THAT HE WAS
[1:05:33] IN THE BEGINNING. THE SAME ATTRIBUTE
[1:05:35] THAT WAS EXPRESSED IN CHRIST. THOSE
[1:05:37] ATTRIBUTES HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED in you
[1:05:39] this morning that are sitting here. SO
[1:05:42] WHEN HE STARTS AS HIS CREATION IN THE
[1:05:44] BEGINNING and and I was just reading
[1:05:46] this it he it started his creation in
[1:05:48] the beginning. HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN
[1:05:51] STAGES THE PROPHET will say revealing
[1:05:53] himself in portion until he he created
[1:05:57] the trees and he created the earth and
[1:06:00] and and THE THE THE FULL EXPRESSION
[1:06:04] OF WHO he was. HE DIDN'T STOP HIS
[1:06:07] EXPRESSING. HE DIDN'T REST UNTIL HE
[1:06:11] CREATED SOMETHING that looked like
[1:06:12] himself.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; So when we WHEN WE LOOK AT EVEN THE VERY
[1:06:18] CREATION, HE HE SAID, "LET US MAKE MAN
[1:06:21] IN our image." Now when you go back IN
[1:06:24] THE SCRIPTURE, BUT WHEN IT WILL SHOW us
[1:06:26] the man that was created created in
[1:06:29] Genesis
[1:06:31] uh 1 and 26 27, it says, "Let us make
[1:06:34] man in our image, in our likeness."
[1:06:37] Butam says that was the spirit man.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And then IF YOU GO TO GENESIS AND I'm
[1:06:43] just going fast for the sake of time so
[1:06:45] I can save time and continue on. IN
[1:06:48] GENESIS CHAPTER 2 AND 7 IT SAYS and the
[1:06:51] Lord formed man of the dust of the
[1:06:54] ground and he breathed into his nostrils
[1:06:57] uh the breath of life and man became a
[1:07:01] living soul. SO WHAT DID GOD DO? GOD
[1:07:04] TOOK THE SPIRIT man that was created in
[1:07:06] his own image and he took that spirit
[1:07:09] man and he placed him in the flesh.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; WHY DID GOD TAKE THE SPIRIT MAN AND
[1:07:15] PLACING him in the flesh? SO THAT SPIRIT
[1:07:18] MAN could express himself.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? SO THAT
[1:07:23] SPIRIT MAN BECAUSE REMEMBER TO THAT
[1:07:26] SPIRIT man it was GIVEN THE THE POWER or
[1:07:30] the dominion over the earth. It was
[1:07:32] given FOR HIM TO SUBDUE ALL THE THINGS.
[1:07:34] AND HE COULDN'T DO IT JUST BEING AS A
[1:07:37] SPIRIT. HE NEEDED A FLESH FOR THE
[1:07:39] EXPRESSION TO BE MADE. SO GOD TOOK THE
[1:07:42] SPIRIT MAN AND PLACED HIM IN THE FLESH
[1:07:45] SO HE CAN CONQUER THE GARDEN OR THE
[1:07:48] ENVIRONMENT THAT HE WAS IN. BUT LET ME
[1:07:50] SAY THIS, BUT THE MAN THAT GOD CREATED
[1:07:53] IN THE IMAGE WAS THE SPIRIT MAN.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, I'M NOT TALKING
[1:07:58] ABOUT THE GARDEN OF EDEN. I'M TALKING
[1:07:59] ABOUT YOU THIS MORNING. YOU ARE THE
[1:08:02] SPIRIT MAN THAT GOD CREATED. THE FLESH
[1:08:04] WAS GIVEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE
[1:08:07] EXPRESSION.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; THE FLESH IS NOT THE EXPRESSION. THE
[1:08:11] SPIRIT IS THE EXPRESSION THAT CAME FROM
[1:08:14] GOD. THE FLESH IS GIVEN SO THAT WHICH IS
[1:08:17] SPIRIT IN YOU CAN BE EXPRESSED.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with ME THIS MORNING? BUT SAYS
[1:08:24] WE NEVER EVEN see one another.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me THIS MORNING? YOU AND I
[1:08:29] HAVE REALLY NEVER MET. WHY? BECAUSE THE
[1:08:31] REAL YOU IS NOT THE FLESH. THE REAL YOU
[1:08:35] IS THE SPIRIT THAT DWELLS IN YOU. ALL
[1:08:37] THAT THE SPIRIT IS TRYING TO DO IS TO
[1:08:40] USE THIS MODEL OF FLESH TO EXPRESS
[1:08:42] ITSELF. SO THEREFORE, BY YOUR ACTION, WE
[1:08:45] THINK WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE. BUT THE REAL
[1:08:47] YOU HAS NEVER BEEN EXPRESSED. WHY?
[1:08:50] BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY HINDRANCE IN
[1:08:52] THIS FLESH.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; SO MANY HINDRANCE. WHEN I WANT TO DO
[1:08:56] GOOD, EVIL IS PRESENT RIGHT THERE. BUT
[1:08:59] MY SISTER, BUT THIS TIME IN THE
[1:09:01] [screaming] END TIME, GOD PROMISED,
[1:09:04] GOD MADE A PROMISE THAT THE FULLNESS OF
[1:09:07] WHO YOU ARE WILL BE MANIFESTED.
[1:09:13] HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; THE FULLNESS OF WHO YOU ARE, NOT SOME
[1:09:17] PARTIAL UNDERSTANDING, BUT THE FULL WORD
[1:09:20] OF GOD OF WHAT YOU WERE IN THE BEGINNING
[1:09:23] IS TO BE MANIFESTED IN THAT FLESH.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; I Oh, we live so below our privileges.
[1:09:33] My brother said we we we THE DEVIL IS
[1:09:36] GOT US SO TWISTED. We we look at our
[1:09:38] flesh. Oh, I see Ben AND OH
[1:09:40] [clears throat]
[1:09:41] I TELL YOU WHAT BUT WHAT WHAT IF BEN
[1:09:44] CHANGE form
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; you you SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? WHAT WHAT
[1:09:50] WHAT THE THE THE THROUGH THE FLESH
[1:09:52] THAT'S WHY SAYS IF SOMEBODY DOES
[1:09:54] SOMETHING WRONG it says it says THE POOR
[1:09:56] BROTHER HE'S TRYING THE BEST THAT HE CAN
[1:09:59] BUT IT'S THE ENEMY THAT CAUSE HIM TO DO
[1:10:01] IT. WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ENEMY WHO'S
[1:10:04] CONSTANTLY COMING INTO OUR WAY OF
[1:10:06] EXPRESSION. OUR HEARTS DESIRE TO EXPRESS
[1:10:09] GOD. UH WE WANT TO DO WHAT GOD WANTS US
[1:10:12] TO DO. BUT YET WE HAVE THIS FLESH THAT
[1:10:14] WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH EVERY DAY.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; SO AT THE SAME NOW he so he he the he
[1:10:32] created and the like I said IT WAS THE
[1:10:36] SAME LIFE. NOW HE says the same love
[1:10:39] that was in Christ now flows in the
[1:10:42] people completing the cycle and this is
[1:10:45] just me saying completing the cycle of
[1:10:48] redemption. God manifesting in the flesh
[1:10:52] again. So the the the the reason the
[1:10:56] whole reason for the expression is THAT
[1:10:59] HE'S GOD. HE wants one that looks like
[1:11:02] him. THE DEVIL COMES AND HE BREAKS THE
[1:11:04] WHOLE PLAN. BUT THEN GOD THROUGH THE END
[1:11:07] TIME HE COMES BACK AS NOW RESTORING THE
[1:11:10] FULL EXPRESSION OF WHAT HE WANTED FROM
[1:11:13] the beginning. Now I want you to listen
[1:11:15] to what the prophet the prophet will
[1:11:17] speak. SO THE PROPHET SAYS IN THE
[1:11:19] MESSAGE deity
[1:11:21] I'm sorry just give me a second
[1:11:26] deity of Jesus Christ. He says paragraph
[1:11:28] 79 he says deity of him of him.
[1:11:33] PARAGRAPH 79 OF WHO? He asked who is he?
[1:11:37] HE SAYS SOME OF THEM THINK THAT he's a
[1:11:39] little baby back in the main baby back
[1:11:42] there. He's he's one is one that stood
[1:11:46] on the invisible the platform and reach
[1:11:49] out his hand and he spoke and said let
[1:11:52] there be light and there was light. That
[1:11:55] was Jesus Christ.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Christ in you. So So are you are YOU
[1:12:01] FOLLOWING? HE WAS IN the world and the
[1:12:04] world was made by him and the world
[1:12:07] recognized him not. He was He's the
[1:12:10] deity OF GOD. LOOK WHAT HE DID BACK
[1:12:13] THERE. TALK ABOUT THE MIRA THE
[1:12:16] MIRACULOUS back there. YOU TALK ABOUT
[1:12:18] SHOUTING WHEN HE PERFORMED THE MIRACLE
[1:12:21] THINGS. HE SAYS THAT MAKE THINGS THAT
[1:12:24] WAS NOT WHAT THAT WHICH is now OUT OF
[1:12:27] THINGS THAT WAS NOT. HE SPOKE AND IT WAS
[1:12:30] SO. Now remember says that he quoted THE
[1:12:34] BOOK OF JOB. HE SAYS YOU SHOUTED WITH
[1:12:37] JOY IN THE BEGINNING. WHAT WAS IT? HE'S
[1:12:39] TALKING ABOUT THIS SCRIPTURE HERE. WE
[1:12:41] WERE THERE WITH HIM. AND AS CREATION IS
[1:12:44] BEING MADE, WE ARE SHOUTING WITH JOY.
[1:12:46] WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THE
[1:12:48] MANIFESTATION OF WHAT WAS TO BE. NOW HE
[1:12:51] CONTINUED ON AND HE SAYS he spoke so and
[1:12:54] then uh uh uh he spoke. HE SPOKE AND IT
[1:12:58] WAS SO. AND THAT SAME POWER, HE SAYS,
[1:13:01] PARAGRAPH 80, THAT SAME POWER, THAT SAME
[1:13:04] CHRIST, HALLELUJAH, LET THE
[1:13:06] FUNDAMENTALIST, LET THEM PEOPLE WHO DENY
[1:13:10] THE POWER OF GOD SAY IT'S WRONG. BUT
[1:13:12] THAT SAME POWER THAT SPOKE THE WORLD
[1:13:15] INTO EXISTENCE IS IN THOSE WHO'S GOT THE
[1:13:18] HOLY GHOST.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; SO CHRIST IN YOU IS THE POWER THAT MADE
[1:13:24] THE WORD COME TO EXISTENCE.
[1:13:28] OH, THAT'S WHY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:13:30] WORD MADE FLESH. IT IT IT'S TO COME TO
[1:13:34] AND MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER, LET ME SAY
[1:13:35] THIS. UH SIN IS TO CAUSE YOU TO
[1:13:39] DISBELIEVE WHAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT YOU.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; AND AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, IT CREATES
[1:13:46] SEPARATION.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? WHAT GOD WANTS US
[1:13:50] TO DO THIS MORNING IS TO BELIEVE WHAT
[1:13:53] THE SCRIPTURES ARE SAYING AND TO WALK IN
[1:13:56] IT SO THE THINGS WHICH ARE SPOKEN WILL
[1:13:59] COME INTO MANIFESTATION.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT GOT THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S
[1:14:05] RIGHT. MEN AND WOMAN, IT'S IT IT SAYS IT
[1:14:09] IT'S TIME THAT WE FOUND OUT WHO YOU WHO
[1:14:11] YOU ARE. THE DEVIL IS TRYING TO HIDE YOU
[1:14:14] BACK. TELL YOU THAT you are some little
[1:14:16] tro downtrodden something. You are not.
[1:14:19] You are. You are the son and daughter of
[1:14:21] God. Deity is not in heaven. It's in
[1:14:25] you.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAYS, "I know you THINK
[1:14:29] I'M CRAZY, BUT LET ME TELL YOU
[1:14:31] SOMETHING, BROTHER. WHEN YOU REALIZE
[1:14:33] THAT THE ALMIGHTY GOD LIVES IN YOU,
[1:14:36] IMMORTAL LIFE, MY LIFE, I I GAVE I GAVE
[1:14:40] ZOE THE LIFE OF GOD IS IN A HUMAN BEING.
[1:14:47] And let ME SAY THIS, THAT'S WHAT GOD
[1:14:49] WANTS US TO WALK BY THIS MORNING. He he
[1:14:52] HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN US UH UH COMING
[1:14:55] AND GETTING some theology of some
[1:14:57] understanding. Oh, you know, THIS IS THE
[1:15:00] PROGRAM. If you do this, then you become
[1:15:02] IF YOU DO. NO, THAT THAT'S WHAT THE
[1:15:05] DEVILS TRY TO GIVE EVE IN THE GARDEN OF
[1:15:07] EDEN. YOU ALREADY ARE THE SONS OF GOD.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; YOU ALREADY HAVE MADE IT. YOU ALREADY
[1:15:13] HEALED. YOU'RE ALREADY SAVED. WHAT YOU
[1:15:16] NEED TO DO IS TO BELIEVE SO HE CAN COME
[1:15:19] INTO MANIFESTATION.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:24] [snorts]
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; HE CONTINUES ON PARAGRAPH 82. He says,
[1:15:27] "And brothers and sister, that deity is
[1:15:30] in you, and a little while the world
[1:15:33] will see me no more. Yet ye shall see
[1:15:36] me, for I'll be with you even in you
[1:15:39] until the end of the age." until the end
[1:15:42] of the age. Uh Christ in the manger. No,
[1:15:46] Christ in you. Hallelujah. We are NOT
[1:15:48] WORSHIPING CHRIST in the manger, but
[1:15:52] Christ in you, the Holy Ghost, the hope
[1:15:55] of glory, the creator, GOD HIMSELF
[1:15:59] DWELLING IN the human being.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And let me just say THIS THIS MORNING,
[1:16:04] IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO GRASP THIS UNLESS
[1:16:07] THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT
[1:16:09] CALLS FOR IT. YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID. WE
[1:16:11] ARE NOT WORSHIPING CHRIST IN MANGER, BUT
[1:16:14] WE ARE WORSHIPING CHRIST IN YOU. IN
[1:16:16] OTHER WORD, WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD OF
[1:16:18] GOD, THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN YOUR
[1:16:21] HEART THAT ANCHORS ON AND RESPOND AND IT
[1:16:24] SAYS, "I KNOW THERE'S A GOD IN ME. I
[1:16:26] KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME. I KNOW
[1:16:28] THERE'S A HEART IN ME THAT WANTS TO SEE
[1:16:30] THIS THING TO come to pass."
[1:16:35] and and prophet I I couldn't find a
[1:16:38] quote, but he said JESUS WHAT JESUS CAME
[1:16:41] to do IS TO ROLL BACK THE CLOUD THAT
[1:16:45] CAME AND STOP YOU FROM REALIZING WHO YOU
[1:16:48] WERE SO YOU CAN COME INTO THE FULL
[1:16:50] understanding of who you are and act
[1:16:53] upon it.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The message has come to take
[1:17:00] what would always what was always been.
[1:17:02] IT'S NOT THE DIDN'T COME TO TELL you
[1:17:05] something that never existed.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; WE WE IT'S NOT WHAT BUT WHAT WAS LACKING
[1:17:12] WAS THE REVELATION OF IT
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; WAS THE OPENING OF IT BECAUSE REMEMBER
[1:17:17] HE SAYS THIS IS THE MYSTERY THAT WAS HID
[1:17:20] SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND
[1:17:22] THE PROPHET WILL TALK ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK
[1:17:25] AT THE ENTIRE BIBLE. IT WAS CHRIST IN
[1:17:27] MOSES. IT WAS CHRIST IN DAVID. IT WAS
[1:17:30] CHRIST. IT WAS ALWAYS CHRIST. WHAT IS
[1:17:32] CHRIST? IS THE ANOINTED WORD OF GOD
[1:17:36] MAKING HIMSELF MANIFESTED IN THE HUMAN
[1:17:38] BEING. THAT'S WHY HE WILL LOOK AT YOU
[1:17:41] AND HE SAYS, "LET ME TELL YOU THIS.
[1:17:43] THOSE MEN ARE MADE LIKE PASSION LIKE YOU
[1:17:46] ARE. IT WASN'T THEM THAT DID IT. IT WAS
[1:17:48] THE CHRIST IN THEM THAT MADE IT HAPPEN."
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS HE SAYING? SO YOU
[1:17:53] CAN UNDERSTAND THE SAME GOD WHO MADE IT
[1:17:55] HAPPEN FOR THEM. THE SAME GOD IS HERE TO
[1:17:58] MAKE HIS WORD FOR THIS HOUR HAPPEN IN
[1:18:00] YOU ALSO.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; It's the answer
[1:18:09] TO THE CRY OF THE predestinated seed.
[1:18:13] Because when when WE WHEN WE GET SICK OR
[1:18:16] WHEN WE SEE A TEMPTATION AND WHEN WE SEE
[1:18:19] THIS THING, THERE HAS TO BE A HEART CRY
[1:18:22] FOR YOU TO OVERCOME THOSE THINGS.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN'T LIVE DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN
[1:18:28] SIN and just be satisfied.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; THE THE PREDESTINATED IS NOT BUILT THAT
[1:18:34] WAY.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; WE DO WRONG, YES, BUT SOMETHING IN HIS
[1:18:38] HEART
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; WANTS TO OVERCOME THAT. SOMETHING IN HIS
[1:18:42] HEART IS LOOKING ACROSS THE SHADOW, JUST
[1:18:45] LOOKING ACROSS THE HORIZON AND KNOW ONE
[1:18:48] DAY THIS IS GOING TO COME TO STOP.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; THEY THEY MAY STRUGGLE DAY IN AND DAY
[1:18:52] OUT, BUT THERE'S A HEARTBEAT IN THEM
[1:18:54] THAT'S LOOKING AND CALLING FORTH AND
[1:18:57] KNOWING THAT ONE DAY I'M GOING TO GET
[1:18:59] OUT OF HERE.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU THIS. THIS WORLD CAN GET
[1:19:02] OUT OF SHAPE AS IT IS AND ALL THE
[1:19:04] THINGS. LET ME TELL YOU THIS. WE ARE NOT
[1:19:06] HERE TO STAY HERE. WE ARE HERE SO WE CAN
[1:19:09] GO HOME.
[1:19:11] WE ARE HERE TO MANIFEST CHRIST AND THEN
[1:19:13] GO HOME.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; So
[1:19:23] sin
[1:19:25] is the representation of the unbelief.
[1:19:31] Sin
[1:19:33] is what caused the separation.
[1:19:37] And
[1:19:39] as long as
[1:19:41] we live in we live our lives in
[1:19:44] disbelief
[1:19:46] because remember the prophet said in the
[1:19:49] invisible union
[1:19:51] that you cannot be married at both at
[1:19:54] the same time.
[1:19:57] You cannot be the old you and the new
[1:19:59] you at the same time.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; That you got to divorce and kill that
[1:20:05] other husband.
[1:20:07] And that other husband is just flesh
[1:20:10] that we have.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; So he and let me say this, I'm trying to
[1:20:15] WALK YOU THROUGH THE process of even how
[1:20:18] the invisible union is coming to
[1:20:20] manifestation. So he he's WANTING US TO
[1:20:24] UNDERSTAND that the unbelief when you
[1:20:27] disbelieve the word of God, YOU ARE
[1:20:29] DISBELIEVING OR TAKING YOURSELF OUT OF
[1:20:32] THE PROGRAM OF GOD OR THE ability to
[1:20:35] receive that which was spoken for you.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET A PASTOR WROTE that he read
[1:20:42] that quote the other day where IT SAYS
[1:20:44] THE PREACHING OF THE WORD is the
[1:20:46] forgiveness OF ALL OUR SINS. MEANING
[1:20:50] WHEN WE RECEIVE THE FORGIVENESS, WE
[1:20:52] AUTOMATICALLY GET INTO THE PROGRAM OF
[1:20:55] GOD TO RECEIVE WHAT WAS SPOKEN OF US.
[1:20:58] BUT WHEN WE REJECT THE WORD OF GOD, when
[1:21:00] we LEAVE THE WORD OF GOD, WHEN WE
[1:21:03] DISBELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD, IT BECOMES
[1:21:05] IMPOSSIBLE FOR THAT PROGRAM TO TAKE
[1:21:08] HOLD.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; So what we need IS THE SEPARATION FROM
[1:21:14] THE UNBELIEF, EVERYTHING THAT DISBELIEF.
[1:21:17] BUT WHEN I'M SAYS YOU DON'T TAKE ONE
[1:21:19] WORD OR TAKE AWAY, ADD OR TAKE AWAY. YOU
[1:21:22] BELIEVE IT JUST THE WAY IT WAS SPOKEN.
[1:21:25] AND GOD IS RESPONSIBLE TO COME TO BRING
[1:21:27] IT TO PASS.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, I KNOW AS HUMANS,
[1:21:32] YOUR FLESH TALKS TO YOU EVERY DAY. YOUR
[1:21:36] FLESH WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO.
[1:21:38] YOUR FLESH WILL TELL YOU HOW YOU FELL
[1:21:40] SHORT. IN FACT, I NEVER HAD MY FLESH
[1:21:42] TELL ME ANYTHING GOOD. BUT WHAT WE NEED
[1:21:44] TO COME, BROTHER SAYS, YOU GOT TO DOUBT
[1:21:47] YOUR OWN DOUBTS. YOU GOT TO DOUBT YOUR
[1:21:49] OWN FLESH. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THE WORD
[1:21:51] OF GOD SO THE SUPERNATURAL CAN HAPPEN.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; I NEVER HAD MY FLESH COME TO ME AND SAY,
[1:22:03] "MAN, YOU'RE the best Christian that I
[1:22:05] know."
[1:22:06] Man, if he did, I would be very nervous.
[1:22:13] You see it? IT'S A CONSTANT FIGHT. AND
[1:22:16] WHAT WE NEED TO COME TO THE
[1:22:17] UNDERSTANDING IS THE UNBELIEF WILL OPEN
[1:22:20] THE DOOR TO FEAR, TO SHAME, TO
[1:22:23] CONDEMNATION. THE UNBELIEF WILL OPEN THE
[1:22:27] DOOR SO SATAN CAN accuse you.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT I LOVE THE PROPHET IN THE
[1:22:37] INVISIBLE UNION. HE SAID, "You you
[1:22:40] didn't even do that. YOU WERE TRICKED
[1:22:42] INTO THAT." SO SO IF YOU REALLY GOT THE
[1:22:45] REVELATION, WHEN SATAN IS ACCUSING YOU,
[1:22:48] HE'S only accusing himself.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; THE WHATEVER ACCUSATION IS LAYING ON
[1:22:54] YOU, IT'S ONLY HIMSELF. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:22:58] HE'S THE ONE WHO TRICKED YOU INTO IT.
[1:23:00] YOU'D NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:23:02] IN FACT, THE PROPHET SAY YOU ARE NOT
[1:23:04] FORGIVEN, BUT YOU ARE JUSTIFIED. AND
[1:23:07] WHAT IS JUSTIFIED? JUSTIFIED DOESN'T
[1:23:09] MEAN MEANS THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN PARTAKE
[1:23:12] OF IT.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR FLESH THAT DID
[1:23:16] THAT. THE REAL [screaming] YOU THAT YOU
[1:23:18] WERE, THE SEED OF GOD THAT WERE COULD
[1:23:21] NOT PARTAKE OF SUCH THING. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:23:23] IT WAS MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND HAS
[1:23:26] NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WORLD.
[1:23:33] BUT IT'S BY FAITH
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; THAT WE OBTAIN of those things.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; IT WHAT WHAT THE DEVIL WANTS YOU TO DO
[1:23:43] IS SIN WILL BREAK THE FELLOWSHIP.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with ME THIS MORNING? SIN WILL
[1:23:51] BREAK THE FELLOWSHIP AND IT WILL UH UH
[1:23:54] PUT AN ADVERSE RELATIONSHIP between you
[1:23:57] AND GOD WHERE YOU THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO
[1:24:00] BE A BELIEVER, you start to feel
[1:24:03] condemnation when you come in the
[1:24:05] presence of God.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; How many knows what I'm talking about
[1:24:08] this morning?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; YOU THAT ARE CREATED TO BE IN THE IMAGE
[1:24:12] OF GOD, YOU START TO MAKE UP A THINKING
[1:24:15] IN YOUR OWN MIND THAT SOMEHOW GOD IS
[1:24:18] AGAINST YOU. THAT SOMEHOW GOD WANTS TO
[1:24:21] PUNISH YOU. WHY WOULD HE PUNISH HIMSELF?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S SIN THAT CAUSED THAT. HE CAME
[1:24:28] AND HE CAUSED THE FAILURE AND HE CAME
[1:24:31] AND IS THE ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN. BUT
[1:24:33] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING THAT
[1:24:35] MY BROTHER, THE WORD HAS BEEN GIVEN TO
[1:24:37] YOU SO YOU CAN OVERCOME WITH THE WORD OF
[1:24:40] GOD.
[1:24:44] AND then when he accuses you, the next
[1:24:46] step is
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; he now wants you to create the religion.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:24:56] now if you can go and give the money to
[1:24:59] the poor and do this, do this, it will
[1:25:03] help you feel a little bit better about
[1:25:05] yourself.
[1:25:12] The scripture says if we can add one
[1:25:14] cube
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; to a statue, Christ died in vain.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Not that we should not do good do good
[1:25:21] works, but the good works that are done
[1:25:24] is the expression of the life of Christ
[1:25:26] that's inside of us. IT'S NOT DONE IN
[1:25:29] GUILT SO WE CAN find some kind of
[1:25:32] religion and feel comfortable about
[1:25:34] ourselves.
[1:25:38] Oh, I'LL JUST GO DO THIS. WHY? IT'S A
[1:25:41] COVERING. GOD DON'T WANT A COVERING THIS
[1:25:43] MORNING. GOD DON'T WANT A RELATION THIS
[1:25:46] MORNING. GOD WANTS US TO COME AND
[1:25:48] CONFESS OUR SINS AND AND SAY, "ABA,
[1:25:50] FATHER," AND RECEIVE THE FULL PRICE OF
[1:25:53] WHAT'S BEEN PAID FOR.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; So Christ died
[1:26:01] so you don't have to pay for your sins.
[1:26:05] Let me say that again. Christ died
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; so you don't have to pay for your sins.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And I I I just think that went over our
[1:26:17] heads. Christ died so you do not have to
[1:26:20] pay for YOUR SINS
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMEHOW WE GET INTO THIS
[1:26:25] RELIGIOUS spirit that when something
[1:26:27] happened, it's us paying for our sins.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me THIS MORNING? THAT IF
[1:26:33] SOMETHING BAD OR SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO
[1:26:35] HAPPEN, ALL OF THE SUDDEN OUR SINS, OUR
[1:26:38] PAST IS CATCHING BACK WITH US. CHRIST
[1:26:41] DIED SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR
[1:26:44] SINS.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; HE CANNOT HE DIDN'T DIE FOR THE PARTIAL
[1:26:49] PAYMENT. HE DIED FOR THE FULL PAYMENT.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; HE DIED SO HE CAN REMOVE THE BARRIER,
[1:26:56] THE SEPARATION. HIS BLOOD WAS ABLE TO
[1:26:59] CLEAN ALL THINGS.
[1:27:02] AND AND LET ME SAY THIS
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; INVISIBLE UNION BUTAM SAYS HIS BLOOD WAS
[1:27:08] THE WHEN YOUR SIN GOT INTO THE
[1:27:10] BLOOD NOT ONLY IT WAS COMPLETELY
[1:27:14] DISSOLVED IT NEVER EXISTED.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST THIS MORNING
[1:27:22] IS ABLE TO TAKE A RANK SINNER AND MAKE
[1:27:25] HIM AS IF HE WAS NEVER SINNER BEFORE.
[1:27:30] NEVER DONE IT. SO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
[1:27:33] YOUR PAST BECAUSE AS LONG AS GOD IS
[1:27:36] CONCERNED, AS FAR AS GOD IS CONCERNED,
[1:27:38] THAT PAST DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK IT AWAY. HE MADE IT DISAPPEAR.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; You starting brand new today.
[1:27:56] The scripture says his mercies are brand
[1:27:58] new every morning.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; When you wake up in the morning, DON'T
[1:28:02] THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I DON'T CARE
[1:28:05] IF YOU KILLED SOMEBODY YESTERDAY. WHEN
[1:28:07] YOU WAKE UP THIS MORNING, IT'S A BRAND
[1:28:10] NEW MORNING. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU HIS
[1:28:12] MERCY. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. YOU ARE
[1:28:14] STARTING A FRESH.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; HE HAS NO CONNECTION TO WHAT HAPPENED
[1:28:20] YESTERDAY.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS WILL DO.
[1:28:28] GOD, he's not interested in our excuses.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I was born with this disability. I
[1:28:36] was born I couldn't speak right. My eyes
[1:28:38] I don't see right. That's what Moses
[1:28:41] tried to do.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I I can't speak." He says,
[1:28:44] "Well, I'LL BE WITH YOU." "WELL, I CAN'T
[1:28:46] DO THIS. I CAN'T." BUT WE EXCUSES,
[1:28:49] EXCUSES, EXCUSES. AND BROTHER SAYS, "GOD
[1:28:52] DOESN'T NEED OUR EXCUSES, NOR DOES HE
[1:28:54] NEED OUR ABILITY." WHAT GOD IS LOOKING
[1:28:57] FOR IS A WILLING VESSEL. I DON'T I I I
[1:29:00] DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY, BUT I'LL GO. I
[1:29:03] DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY, BUT I'LL GO.
[1:29:05] LET ME SAY THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO
[1:29:07] TO HEAVEN BY OUR ABILITY. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:29:10] GO BECAUSE HE SAID WE'LL GO.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WE NEED IS TO TAKE THE WORD OF
[1:29:18] GOD. I WAS THINKING ABOUT JOSHUA AND
[1:29:20] CALEB, BUT MADAM SAYS THEY DIDN'T LOOK
[1:29:23] AT THE OBSTACLE, THEY LOOKED AT THE
[1:29:25] PROMISE. WHAT THE PROMISE SAID IT WAS,
[1:29:28] BUT WHAT THEY WERE BELIEVING. SO IF THE
[1:29:30] PROMISE SAYS I'M WELL, I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:29:33] THE DOCTOR SAYS THIS MORNING.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; What is God doing? He's making a way for
[1:29:42] you to go back to what you were in the
[1:29:45] beginning. HE'S MAKING A WAY. NOT YOU.
[1:29:48] HE'S MAKING THE WAY.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Justified
[1:30:01] as though you never done it.
[1:30:04] Hallelujah.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; So on Calvary, the scripture will say
[1:30:08] that he tore the vessel, he tore the
[1:30:10] veil from top to bottom, signifying that
[1:30:14] his presence will no longer be hidden
[1:30:16] from the believer.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; He made himself known
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; who he was. He, you know, first it was
[1:30:23] just the priest that saw him. It was
[1:30:26] only the priest that went in a holy of
[1:30:28] holy. and the priest will go and
[1:30:30] everybody else will just have to wait to
[1:30:33] wait and see what happens. ANDAM SAYS IT
[1:30:36] WAS DEATH TO GO IN THERE BECAUSE ONLY
[1:30:39] THE PRIEST COULD GO. BUT WHEN THE VEIL
[1:30:41] WAS TORN, WHEN GOD MADE A WAY TO NOT GO
[1:30:45] IN THERE BECAME DEATH.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? TO NOT HAVE A
[1:30:50] RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BECAME DEATH. TO
[1:30:53] NOT BE CONNECTED WITH HIM BECAME DEATH.
[1:30:55] WHY? OUTSIDE IS JUST A RELIGIOUS SPIRIT.
[1:30:58] IT'S JUST A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY. WHAT
[1:31:00] HE'S WANTING FOR IS THE ONENESS TO BE
[1:31:03] RECREATED THAT was back in the
[1:31:06] beginning.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus became sin
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; so we can take his righteousness.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; The cross, let me say this, the cross
[1:31:18] didn't give you a new position. The
[1:31:21] cross came to tell you or to expose to
[1:31:25] you what you were really
[1:31:28] before the sin came.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Everything in between what happened from
[1:31:39] uh uh uh from in the garden of Eden
[1:31:42] until Christ came. When Christ came, he
[1:31:46] was only there because remember the
[1:31:47] scripture says he was the firstborn
[1:31:49] among many brethren. He was coming to
[1:31:52] establish a way back for the believer
[1:31:55] into the presence of God for the
[1:31:57] fellowship.
[1:31:59] I was thinking this morning I thought
[1:32:01] about
[1:32:03] Peter, James and John.
[1:32:05] And in fact Peter and John Yeah. were
[1:32:10] the church. If you look at the format of
[1:32:12] the church, they came and they they they
[1:32:15] they would every time the scripture will
[1:32:17] say one will come that was sick, they
[1:32:19] will even take it before Christ so he
[1:32:21] could be prayed for. But after the day
[1:32:23] of Pentecost, but when it makes a
[1:32:25] statement someplace, it said now the man
[1:32:28] that was at the gate beautiful Jesus
[1:32:31] perhaps passed there many time and saw
[1:32:33] him.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me this
[1:32:38] morning?
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus passed there many times and he saw
[1:32:43] that man at the gate beautiful, he did
[1:32:45] nothing.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he knew that AFTER THE DAY
[1:32:50] OF PENTECOST, WHAT DID THE DAY OF
[1:32:52] PENTECOST COME TO DO? THE DAY OF
[1:32:55] PENTECOST COME TO SHOW THE THE the
[1:32:58] believers or the disciples WHAT THEY
[1:33:00] REALLY WERE AT THE BEGINNING BEFORE ALL
[1:33:03] OF THAT HAPPENED. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS
[1:33:05] THAT WHEN PETER AND JOHN CAME TO THE
[1:33:08] GATE BEAUTIFUL, WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE
[1:33:10] MAN, THEY SAY UNTO HIM, "SILVER AND GOLD
[1:33:14] HAVE I NONE, BUT THAT WHICH I HAVE." WHY
[1:33:17] DID THEY HAVE? IT'S THE RECOGNITION THAT
[1:33:20] THEY WERE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:33:22] THEY CAME INTO THE REALIZATION THAT THEY
[1:33:25] WERE JUST NOT MORTAL. THEY WERE JUST NOT
[1:33:27] FISHERMEN. THEY WERE NOT THOSE THAT
[1:33:29] JESUS CALLED SOMEWHERE ON THE COURSE.
[1:33:32] THERE WERE THOSE THAT WERE PREDESTINATED
[1:33:34] AT THAT MOMENT TO SPEAK THE WORD SO THE
[1:33:36] MAN CAN STAND UP.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; OH, IF WE CAN RECEIVE THAT REVELATION
[1:33:42] THIS MORNING, YOU'RE NOT JUST A DOCTOR
[1:33:45] [screaming] OR OR AN ENGINEER OR
[1:33:46] WAREHOUSE WORKER, WHATEVER YOU ARE, WHAT
[1:33:49] YOU ARE, YOU ARE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF
[1:33:51] GOD FOR YOU TO EXPRESS GOD TO THIS TIME
[1:33:55] GENERATION.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; What says Christ the mystery of God
[1:34:09] revealed paragraph 233
[1:34:13] [snorts]
[1:34:14] it says look
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; He says paragraph 233 he says look
[1:34:32] Christ in you
[1:34:35] makes him the center of life of the
[1:34:39] revelation.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; See Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:34:45] center of the revelation of Christ in
[1:34:49] the Bible. It says makes him the center
[1:34:51] of the revelation.
[1:34:53] CHRIST IN YOU. CHRIST IN THE BIBLE makes
[1:34:56] the Bible a complete revelation of
[1:34:58] Christ. Christ in you makes you the
[1:35:02] complete revelation of the WHOLE THING.
[1:35:05] WHAT GOD IS TRYING YOU SEE SEE WHAT GOD
[1:35:08] IS TRYING to do. He says THE WHAT IS THE
[1:35:11] NEW BIRTH THEN YOU WOULD SAY BROTHER
[1:35:13] BRANDHAM WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH IS THE
[1:35:16] REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST PERSONALLY TO
[1:35:19] YOU. AMEN. IT SAYS NOT YOU JOINING A
[1:35:22] CHURCH OR YOU SHOOK HAND OR YOU DONE
[1:35:24] SOMETHING DIFFERENT. YOU SAID A CREED or
[1:35:27] or or you you promised to LIVE ACCORD.
[1:35:30] BUT CHRIST, THE BIBLE, HE IS THE WORD.
[1:35:34] HE IS THE WORD THAT WAS REVEALED TO YOU.
[1:35:37] AND NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, WHAT
[1:35:40] TAKES PLACE, IT'S CHRIST, PASTOR,
[1:35:42] PRIEST, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, IT'S
[1:35:44] CHRIST IN YOU THAT THE REVELATION. IT
[1:35:47] SAYS THAT IS THE REVELATION that the
[1:35:49] church will be was built upon. All
[1:35:52] right.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Let me say this.
[1:35:56] The revelation that the church is built
[1:35:58] upon, give me a second.
[1:36:15] The revelation,
[1:36:19] the revelation that the church is built
[1:36:21] upon
[1:36:23] is God.
[1:36:26] And I'm saying this not by intellect,
[1:36:30] but by revelation
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; making himself known to each individual.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can act
[1:36:39] to what you were in the beginning before
[1:36:43] there was an atom, before there was a
[1:36:46] molecule, before there was anything. But
[1:36:48] when I'm says, "Oh, we need revelation
[1:36:53] by the spirit.
[1:36:55] We don't need a new Bible. We don't need
[1:36:59] a New Testament. Though some are very
[1:37:03] good. I'm not against that. But we need
[1:37:06] the revelation of the spirit. And thank
[1:37:10] God that we can have what we need. For
[1:37:14] God wants to reveal his word to us by
[1:37:18] his spirit. [snorts]
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You caught this. It's the revelation by
[1:37:23] the spirit. It's not you reading the
[1:37:26] Bible and seeing it in a way you never
[1:37:29] see it before. BUT IT TAKES THE SPIRIT
[1:37:31] OF GOD TO COME TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND
[1:37:35] DWELL IN YOU AND CAUSE YOU TO SEE THINGS
[1:37:38] DIFFERENTLY.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME THIS MORNING? IT TAKES
[1:37:42] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT ON THE
[1:37:46] PERSON ON THE SOUL TO CHANGE YOUR NATURE
[1:37:50] FROM WHATEVER YOU WERE FOREVER THE FOR
[1:37:52] WHATEVER THE THINGS OF THE WORLD YOU
[1:37:54] WENT AFTER INTO SOMEBODY NEW THAT LOVES
[1:37:58] [screaming] AND LIVES FOR THE THINGS OF
[1:37:59] GOD.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS WHAT HE SAYS MAY UH UH MAY GOD
[1:38:04] MAY GOD BY HIS SPIRIT give us CONTINUAL
[1:38:08] LIFEGIVING and prevailing revelation.
[1:38:11] Oh, if the church only gets a a fresh
[1:38:15] revelation and and become by it the
[1:38:18] living word manifested,
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; we would do greater works and glorify
[1:38:24] our God the father
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:30] But one says
[1:38:33] Jesus looked at he came it says in John
[1:38:37] 17 it says father
[1:38:40] that the glory which I had with you in
[1:38:43] the beginning that they may have the
[1:38:46] same glory.
[1:38:49] Jesus didn't want you to be
[1:38:52] lower than him.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning?
[1:38:57] Jesus didn't ask
[1:39:00] that you may have some other places
[1:39:04] lower level
[1:39:06] UH NOT MEANINGFUL PLACE THAT you can
[1:39:09] occupy but yet be a Christian
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; because that's WHAT WE DO
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S what that's the the image we
[1:39:18] create for ourselves he said BUT IN FACT
[1:39:22] SAYS IN THAT DAY YOU SHALL KNOW TALKING
[1:39:26] ABOUT THIS TODAY HE SAYS THAT THE SAME
[1:39:29] WAY THE FATHER WAS IN ME THAT I WILL
[1:39:32] ALSO BE IN YOU. WHAT JESUS WAS ASKING
[1:39:35] FOR THAT IF I LAY DOWN MY LIFE IN JOHN
[1:39:38] 17 THAT THE SAME FRIENDSHIP THAT THE
[1:39:41] SAME FELLOWSHIP THAT HE HAD WITH THE
[1:39:43] FATHER THAT YOU CAN BE PARTAKERS OF THAT
[1:39:46] SAME revelation that YOU CAN BE
[1:39:48] PARTAKERS OF THAT SAME LIFE. NOT SOME
[1:39:51] THIRD PARTY SOMEWHERE BUT YOU CAN BE
[1:39:53] JUST AS HE WAS HERE ON EARTH.
[1:39:59] THAT we the prophet will say
[1:40:04] God's great mystery.
[1:40:09] What the eternal God
[1:40:12] had a mystery and been unfolding in
[1:40:14] Jesus Christ then given right down to
[1:40:18] his church. What was once in God's mind
[1:40:24] is now in the body of Christ.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Jesus
[1:40:32] making love to his church, his bride,
[1:40:36] whispering secrets to her.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. You can't get greater
[1:40:44] than that. Right.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; See, we I feel like the the the devil is
[1:40:51] got us exactly the same place that Eve
[1:40:53] was.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I if you can do this,
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; you can be EVEN LIKE GOD. THEY WERE
[1:41:01] ALREADY GOD.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THEY WERE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF
[1:41:06] GOD. THEY WERE THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THEY
[1:41:08] WERE ALREADY GOD.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; BUT YET WE COME TO CHURCH, WE FEEL LIKE,
[1:41:12] "OH, IF I COULD JUST GET MORE." NO, YOU
[1:41:14] DON'T NEED MORE. YOU NEED A REVELATION
[1:41:17] OF WHAT YOU ALREADY GIVEN TO YOU.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ENEMY. IT'S HIS APPROACH. HE
[1:41:24] TRIES TO COME [screaming] AND AND SHOW,
[1:41:26] OH, I'M BLESSED IF I CAN ONLY BE LIKE
[1:41:28] GOD. YOU ARE LIKE GOD. YOU WERE MADE IN
[1:41:31] THE IMAGE OF GOD. IN FACT, HE'S COMING
[1:41:33] HERE TO LET YOU KNOW. BUT WHEN SAYS,
[1:41:36] "OH, WHAT WE NEED THIS MORNING IS THAT
[1:41:38] OUR CHARACTERS, [clears throat]
[1:41:40] LISTEN TO THIS, THE WORD OF GOD HAS BEEN
[1:41:42] GIVEN TO US TO MOLD OUR CHARACTER SO IT
[1:41:46] WILL MATCH WHAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; THE WORD IS GIVEN FOR THE MOLDING OF
[1:41:56] YOUR CHARACTER. SO IF THE WORD SAYS YOU
[1:41:59] CAN'T DO THIS, YOU CAN'T DO THAT, OFTEN
[1:42:02] TIME WE LOOK AT IT AS RESTRICTION." NO,
[1:42:04] IT'S GIVEN TO YOU BECAUSE THE WORD IS
[1:42:07] GIVEN AND THE WORD HAS THE CHARGE OF
[1:42:11] MAKING SURE THAT IT MOLDS YOU SO YOU CAN
[1:42:14] BE IN THE IMAGE THAT WILL FIT WHAT WAS
[1:42:16] IN THE BEGINNING. AND TO REJECT THE WORD
[1:42:18] IS TO REJECT THE IMAGE.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; And the only way we can know what
[1:42:28] already existed is by his word making
[1:42:31] manifest to us.
[1:42:35] We are invited to shape our character by
[1:42:37] his word in the message identification
[1:42:40] by his grace. If we are invited
[1:42:43] to think of it to become characters like
[1:42:47] his. If we are if we are ready to lay
[1:42:50] our characters down and the molding
[1:42:56] and the molding that that we had and
[1:43:00] howy it says heady and high-minded
[1:43:02] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:43:04] God, false accusers and incontinent and
[1:43:07] despise of those who are trying to do
[1:43:10] right and having the form of godliness
[1:43:13] and denying the power thereof. How can
[1:43:15] God come in the place like that when
[1:43:18] they deny the word
[1:43:21] when we watched over his word? And it
[1:43:24] says when he watched over his word to
[1:43:26] vindicate it and make it come to pass
[1:43:29] and the word is pushed out, how can he
[1:43:32] identify himself with something like
[1:43:34] that?
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And why is he saying
[1:43:39] that? He's not saying that to condemn
[1:43:41] you. He's saying that to identify you.
[1:43:45] Why? Because he knows only the elect can
[1:43:48] really receive the word.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; See, when we read this, the flesh feels
[1:43:54] that condemnation, but the spirit says,
[1:43:57] "This is what I want." That's why I said
[1:43:59] the other day, when the word is
[1:44:01] preached, we have to be careful that we
[1:44:03] don't apply it to the flesh, BUT WE LET
[1:44:05] THE word speak to the spirit man so the
[1:44:08] spirit man can o can take the word and
[1:44:10] overcome the flesh man. SO WHEN HE'S
[1:44:13] SAYING THIS, THEY WERE DENYING THE WORD.
[1:44:16] HE'S IDENTIFYING A characteristics of
[1:44:18] PEOPLE BECAUSE HE SAID ONLY THE ELECT
[1:44:21] WILL RECEIVE the word. SO WHEN THE WORD
[1:44:24] IS PREACHED, THE ELECT, NO MATTER HOW
[1:44:26] HARD OR NO MATTER HOW THE WORD COME, THE
[1:44:29] ELECT IS THERE TO RECEIVE THE WORD
[1:44:31] BECAUSE THE ELECT KNOWS THAT BY THY WORD
[1:44:34] I'LL BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE THINGS THAT
[1:44:36] HE SAYS.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; AND LET ME SAY THIS MORNING, ONLY the
[1:44:43] elect
[1:44:45] can manifest the true characteristics
[1:44:47] and expression of Christ.
[1:44:52] You say how? Only the elect can have
[1:44:57] true love,
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; true forgiveness.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; True healing, true everything. Because
[1:45:04] the unbeliever will do it when he knows
[1:45:06] he benefits him.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; You You see, the unbeliever's got a
[1:45:10] motive. But the true elect, it's not
[1:45:13] him. It's the reflection of what's
[1:45:15] inside of his heart. THE TRUE ELECT
[1:45:18] DOESN'T HOLD GRUDGES OR OR OR MAD AT
[1:45:21] SOMEBODY OR DO SOME NO, THE TRUE ELECT
[1:45:24] KNOWS THAT THE SAME LOVE BECAUSE
[1:45:26] REMEMBER JESUS IS NOT ASKING US TO DO
[1:45:29] SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS
[1:45:31] OFFERED TO US. WHY? IT'S THE SAME LIFE
[1:45:34] THAT WAS IN CHRIST WHEN HE DWELLS IN YOU
[1:45:37] WHEN HE WAS PERSECUTED WHEN HE WAS TAKEN
[1:45:40] TO THE CROSS WHEN HE WAS BEING BEATEN.
[1:45:42] HE LOOKED AT THEM AND he says, "Father,
[1:45:45] forgive them. Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; But if it's not the true elect,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; it will try to find a reason to hate,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; a reason to criticize, a reason to hold
[1:45:57] grudges, a reason to say this or to say
[1:46:00] that. But the true elect is the true
[1:46:03] reflection of who Christ is.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; He made us partakers of divine nature.
[1:46:11] When the Holy Ghost comes in you, IT'S
[1:46:14] JUST NOT to give you uh some emotional
[1:46:18] EXCITEMENT, ALTHOUGH WE MAY HAVE THAT,
[1:46:21] but it was to make us partakers of
[1:46:23] divine nature to BRING US TO THE VERY
[1:46:26] LIFE of Christ in the human vessel.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Why the human vessel?
[1:46:36] Because that's where the expression will
[1:46:38] take place.
[1:46:42] And let me add this. The expression
[1:46:45] cannot take place when everything is
[1:46:48] calm and dandy.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Just like the creation in the building
[1:46:56] in the beginning.
[1:46:59] The expression needs to be where there's
[1:47:02] turbulence.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:47:06] There need to be some condition
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; by which the expression will be made.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my,
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; how we hate that environment.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; How we run from that environment.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; See, we think being a Christian is being
[1:47:21] peaceful and you know having yoga in the
[1:47:24] morning and nothing is going wrong,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; right? Like I'll just wake up and just
[1:47:30] whistle my way from the morning and
[1:47:33] everything will be fine.
[1:47:35] But Ram says, "Get that image out of
[1:47:37] your mind.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Being a Christian is a battleground.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Is conquering and putting under
[1:47:46] subjection. Is calling things that are
[1:47:48] not as though there were. IS CALLING
[1:47:51] THINGS THAT ARE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT.
[1:47:53] WHY? BECAUSE IT'S THE EXPRESSION.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; DON'T RUN AWAY FROM THE EXPRESSION. GOD
[1:47:59] YOUR [screaming] FATHER DIDN'T RUN AWAY
[1:48:01] FROM THE EXPRESSION. HOW CAN YOU THE SON
[1:48:03] RUN AWAY FROM EXPRESSION?
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; IF HE MADE THE EXPRESSION A REALITY, LET
[1:48:10] ME SAY THIS THIS MORNING. YOU WILL MAKE
[1:48:12] THE EXPRESSION A REALITY. WHERE ARE YOU
[1:48:15] GOING TO MAKE IT IN YOUR TROUBLES,
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; IN YOUR TRIALS, IN THE PLACES THAT YOU
[1:48:21] ARE WITH ALL THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
[1:48:24] SURROUNDING YOU? LET ME SAY THIS. GOD
[1:48:26] KNEW ABOUT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HE
[1:48:29] KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T GIVE YOU UNLESS HE
[1:48:32] KNEW THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THEM.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; The expression HAS GOT TO COME OUT.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; BUT THE EXPRESSION SAYS IT'S LIKE GOLD.
[1:48:46] YOU DON'T JUST TAKE GOLD OUT OF THE
[1:48:48] GROUND AND SAY, "OH, LOOK." IN FACT, IF
[1:48:50] YOU LOOK AT IT, IT looks nothing like
[1:48:52] what you see.
[1:48:55] It has to go through the process of
[1:48:57] refining.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; It has to go through the process of
[1:49:00] beating out all the fool's gold. And but
[1:49:03] when says it's beaten UNTIL THE IMAGE OF
[1:49:06] THE ONE THAT'S DOING THE beating can see
[1:49:09] his own reflection. My brother, MY
[1:49:11] SISTER, THE TRIALS THAT UPON YOU, IT'S
[1:49:14] NOT BECAUSE GOD HATES YOU. GOD KNOWS
[1:49:17] THAT IN YOUR FLESH THERE'S AN IMAGE OF
[1:49:19] HIM THAT HE PLACED IN THERE. [screaming]
[1:49:21] ALL THAT HE'S TRYING TO DO THIS MORNING
[1:49:23] IS TO BEAT THE FLESH OUT OF YOU SO HE
[1:49:26] CAN LIVE THE IMAGE THAT'S HIMSELF.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; THE IMAGE OF HIMSELF. OH MY BROTHER, MY
[1:49:33] SISTER, LET YOUR HEART SCREAM OUT THIS
[1:49:35] MORNING AND SAY, GOD, I WANT YOUR IMAGE
[1:49:38] TO COME OUT.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOUR [screaming] IMAGE TO COME
[1:49:41] OUT.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; HE TALKS ABOUT THE BADGE OF SKIN. THE
[1:49:47] BADGER SKIN COULD NOT BE USED UNTIL IT
[1:49:50] WAS DRIED OUT, ALL THE LIFE TAKEN OFF OF
[1:49:54] IT for it to express or to cover the
[1:49:59] glory that was in the tabernacle.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; See, what we want is a little mixing of
[1:50:05] the life of God with our flesh. The
[1:50:09] flesh wants to be part of it so we can
[1:50:11] say, "See, see what I did? God, God used
[1:50:15] me.
[1:50:16] and and he healed this and he did this
[1:50:19] and then we take a little bit of that
[1:50:21] glory. God is not going to share his
[1:50:23] glory with nobody. God can use a donkey.
[1:50:26] God can TAKE THE STONE AND TURN THEM
[1:50:28] INTO CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM. WHAT WE NEED
[1:50:31] IS TO BE WILLING VESSEL WHEREVER HE
[1:50:34] WANTS, HOWEVER HE CHOOSES.
[1:50:47] He says in the spoken word is the
[1:50:49] original state. I'm coming to a close.
[1:50:52] He says
[1:50:55] paragraph uh 388 it says now the power
[1:50:59] of the believing church.
[1:51:02] I love this. The power of the believing
[1:51:05] church. Christ has all the power in
[1:51:10] heaven and earth. You believe that? The
[1:51:13] congregation say amen.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; It says now if
[1:51:17] if is in you has Christ got all power.
[1:51:23] Amen.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Matthew 18 uh 28 and and 18 he says all
[1:51:28] right he is the seedword in his body. He
[1:51:33] says, "And he is in us becomes the
[1:51:37] seedword in us." WHAT ALL THE POWER, ALL
[1:51:42] THAT GOD WAS, he poured into Christ. AND
[1:51:46] ALL THAT CHRIST WAS, he poured into the
[1:51:49] church. That's the power. He continues
[1:51:52] on. It says, "NOW WATCH. REMEMBER GOD'S
[1:51:56] LAW OF REPRODUCTION." Now remember after
[1:51:59] his kind, right? The congregation say,
[1:52:01] "Amen. The seed of it says THE SEED OF
[1:52:04] CHRIST, THE WORD MUST COME THROUGH HIS
[1:52:08] BODY.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; DID YOU CATCH THAT?
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF GOD MUST BE MANIFESTED in
[1:52:17] his body.
[1:52:19] YOU YOU YOU CAN'T THE THE WHATEVER THE
[1:52:23] HEAD IS, THE BODY IS ALSO. IT'S NOT THAT
[1:52:27] THE POWER IS IN THE HEAD, BUT YET THE
[1:52:30] BODY IS NOTHING. WHEN THE BODY IS
[1:52:32] CONNECTED TO THE HEAD, WHAT THE HEAD IS,
[1:52:35] THE BODY IS THE MATERIAL THAT THE HEAD
[1:52:38] IS MADE OF, THE BODY IS MADE OUT OF THE
[1:52:41] SAME MATERIAL. THE SAME POWER THAT WAS
[1:52:44] IN CHRIST, THAT SAME POWER IS IN HIS
[1:52:47] BODY.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; IT SAYS, NOW NOTICE, UH,
[1:52:52] notice it says, and this is Christ got
[1:52:56] to reveal. I'm back over there. HE SAYS,
[1:52:58] "NOW NOTICE GOD MAKING HIMSELF KNOWN. WE
[1:53:02] are supposed to be uh we are not
[1:53:04] supposed to be TO MAKE CONVERTS TO
[1:53:07] CHRIST BY government by by revelation.
[1:53:10] Christ in you AS GOD WAS IN CHRIST. AS
[1:53:15] GOD WAS IN CHRIST, CHRIST IS IN YOU."
[1:53:18] WHEN GOD WHAT GOD DID IN CHRIST, CHRIST
[1:53:22] does in you. Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Same thing.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "WHAT SIGNS GOD DID IN CHRIST,
[1:53:30] CHRIST DOES IN YOU." ISN'T THAT
[1:53:32] BEAUTIFUL? MY JESUS SAYS, HE SAID, "AT
[1:53:36] THAT DAY," IT SAYS THAT'S THIS DAY. AT
[1:53:40] THAT DAY WHEN THIS revelation is made
[1:53:44] known.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to catch that. [snorts]
[1:53:51] When this revelation is made known, you
[1:53:55] will know that I am in the father and
[1:53:58] the father in me and I in you. In other
[1:54:02] word, what is the revealing of the
[1:54:05] seals? The barbanam says the seals is
[1:54:08] Christ. What is it? It's revealing
[1:54:10] Christ. So at the revealing of who
[1:54:13] Christ is, we have come to the
[1:54:16] understanding that we are in him and
[1:54:19] he's in us at that very revelation.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Christ and the bride are the same thing.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; In fact, we've come to an understanding
[1:54:29] that his revelation at the end time is
[1:54:32] him being revealed in his bride's body.
[1:54:37] That's the revelation of this hour.
[1:54:40] If the musician could come,
[1:54:53] [snorts]
[1:54:56] the scripture will speak in 2
[1:54:58] Corinthians 16.
[1:55:02] It says, "What agreement
[1:55:05] has the temple of God
[1:55:08] with idols?
[1:55:10] Ye are not. You are the temple of the
[1:55:13] living God. As God has said, I will
[1:55:17] dwell in them and walk in them and I
[1:55:21] will be their God and they shall be my
[1:55:24] people."
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; But Ram makes a statement. He says,
[1:55:29] "When a man builds a house, he intends
[1:55:33] to live in it."
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; So God didn't create you
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; so you can remain an empty vessel
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; or some kind of vessel that the enemy
[1:55:46] will push and do whatever they want. God
[1:55:49] made you for the purpose of fellowship
[1:55:53] that he can come and dwell in you and
[1:55:56] you will have fellowship with him.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; God wants to see another God. He doesn't
[1:56:02] want to see your flesh. He paid for your
[1:56:05] flesh. He killed your flesh. He took it
[1:56:08] away. Don't keep bringing it up. Amen.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; You look at yourself in the mirror of
[1:56:14] the word and look at what he said about
[1:56:17] you and you dressed in that word and you
[1:56:20] present himself before him and he will
[1:56:23] accept you.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; But what I'm say I'll just say this to
[1:56:27] in closing. He says the bride is the
[1:56:29] final this is me saying is the final
[1:56:32] expression of God's work on earth. Just
[1:56:35] the same way as Adam was the completion
[1:56:38] of the creation at the beginning after
[1:56:41] the sixth day God came and he created
[1:56:43] one that looked like him. At the end of
[1:56:46] seven CHURCH AGES WHEN ALL OF THEM IS
[1:56:49] done God comes at the end and he creates
[1:56:52] a bride.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; that's exactly like himself. So the
[1:56:56] completion of the fullness of the
[1:56:58] manifestation of his PURPOSE IN HER GOD
[1:57:01] find rest in her. She's the final of the
[1:57:05] She's the finality of the mystery of
[1:57:08] God.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Let me say this.
[1:57:17] We're not called to be beggars.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God, if you can. That's not how God
[1:57:24] wants you to approach him this morning.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:28] You know that happened with a woman
[1:57:31] because she came out of season and she
[1:57:34] approached him as he was the son of
[1:57:36] David. He came to the Jews. [music]
[1:57:39] But yet when she called Lord, he
[1:57:42] recognized that he was Lord over all and
[1:57:44] he answered to the need. But we live in
[1:57:46] the time where he's come as the
[1:57:48] bridegroom to us. And I think it would
[1:57:51] be a lacking on our part if we try to
[1:57:55] approach him differently from the way he
[1:57:57] wants us to approach him. I think it
[1:57:59] will be a miss from our side to come
[1:58:02] this morning look at oursel treat oursel
[1:58:05] and think of ourselves less from what he
[1:58:08] said we are. So we are we are here as
[1:58:12] possessors of the eternal life. We are
[1:58:15] here as possessors of what belongs to to
[1:58:19] possess what belong to us to take hold
[1:58:21] of the promises of God. We are here TO
[1:58:24] BRING WHAT GOD TO COME AND TO contribute
[1:58:28] to BE PART OF WHAT GOD HAS CALLED US TO
[1:58:30] be in the end time. We are HERE TO BE
[1:58:33] GOD'S BADGE OF SKIN FOR THE WORLD that
[1:58:36] we are living in.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS. IT SHOULDN'T BE
[1:58:41] DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE to look at you and
[1:58:44] see Christ.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; I I I'll tell you just a a short story,
[1:58:52] just a I I was not even a preacher
[1:58:58] and I was I was probably in my 20s, 24,
[1:59:02] [music]
[1:59:02] 25.
[1:59:04] I at work a guy looks at me just looks
[1:59:08] at me asked me, "Are you a preacher?" I
[1:59:10] said no.
[1:59:14] And and that was not even the first time
[1:59:18] I I was a young person. I've told it
[1:59:21] before I came and I there's a a pastor
[1:59:25] who was a a neighbor and every morning
[1:59:28] they will come and collect all the kids
[1:59:29] and you know take him to church
[1:59:31] forcefully. You know you know when he
[1:59:33] show up we we have no way to run. SO WE
[1:59:35] KNEW WHAT time it will come and we'll
[1:59:36] run away and and and and then so he kind
[1:59:40] of understood what was happening and he
[1:59:43] will show UP AT VERY ODD HOURS BEFORE WE
[1:59:46] COULD get ready to run
[1:59:49] and and HE TOOK US TO CHURCH AND WE'RE
[1:59:51] SITTING THERE DON'T WANT TO BE there
[1:59:55] nothing want to be there
[1:59:57] he called me to come and close the
[1:59:59] prayer and I pray and and he looked at
[2:00:02] me he says do you feel you HAVE A CALLED
[2:00:04] TO PREACH. I said I and I'm thinking
[2:00:08] this guy just wants me to be in this
[2:00:10] building FOR HIM.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; NOT INTERESTED.
[2:00:15] AND AND WHAT AM I SAYING THIS MORNING?
[2:00:18] BEFORE WHEN [screaming] YOU WERE EVEN A
[2:00:20] SINNER,
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; BEFORE WHEN YOU EVEN DIDN'T KNOW
[2:00:23] ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; THE SEED WAS ALREADY SCREAMING OUT OF
[2:00:27] YOU WITHOUT EVEN YOU KNOWING.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; BEFORE WHEN YOU WERE DOWN IN SIN AND THE
[2:00:31] M AND EVERYTHING. BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN
[2:00:34] KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT GOD, THAT SEED WAS
[2:00:37] ALREADY MANIFESTED AND THERE WERE SOME
[2:00:39] THAT COULD SEE IT. MY BROTHER, MY
[2:00:41] SISTER, IF BACK THEN IT WAS THAT WAY.
[2:00:43] HOW MUCH MORE THIS MORNING? HOW MUCH
[2:00:46] MORE WHEN WE'VE GIVEN HIM OUR ALL WHEN
[2:00:48] WE HEAR WANTING HIM TO SPEAK TO US? HOW
[2:00:51] MUCH MORE THIS MORNING? HE WANTS TO LIFT
[2:00:53] you up and make you to be his image, his
[2:00:58] reflection for the dying generation. Let
[2:01:01] me say this. It's not something that you
[2:01:04] make yourself be. It's what he has
[2:01:06] already made you to be.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS. LET'S KICK AWAY
[2:01:10] UNBELIEF. LET'S KICK AWAY THE THINGS OF
[2:01:13] THE WORLD. LET'S KICK AWAY ALL THE
[2:01:15] THINGS THAT'S COMING ON OUR WAY. LET'S
[2:01:17] SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THE THINGS OF
[2:01:19] THE WORLD. LET'S SEPARATE OURSEL FROM
[2:01:22] THE TELEVISION AND ENTERTAINMENT AND ALL
[2:01:24] THE THINGS THAT TAKES US AWAY FROM IT.
[2:01:26] LET'S EMBRACE THIS REVELATION. LET TAKE
[2:01:29] THIS REVELATION. MY BROTHER, MY SISTER,
[2:01:32] IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE WORD CAN DO,
[2:01:34] RECEIVE THE WORD OF GOD THIS MORNING.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; DON'T RECEIVE IT PARTIALLY. EMBRACE IT
[2:01:42] FULLY. GIVE IT YOUR ALL AND SEE WHAT GOD
[2:01:46] could produce in you.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; HE'S ALREADY MADE IT.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; He's just here to make you realize that
[2:01:53] he's already done it for you.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Let's stand this morning.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation OF CHRIST. CHRIST in
[2:02:01] you. It's the whole picture this
[2:02:03] morning.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; It's not something new, but it's him
[2:02:09] making himself known to his believers.
[2:02:13] I don't know about you, but my heart's
[2:02:16] desire is, Father,
[2:02:20] oh, if I could just die to myself this
[2:02:22] morning. Father, if you could just help
[2:02:25] me die to myself and the things of the
[2:02:28] world. Father, you said that we need
[2:02:31] revelation more than ever before. That
[2:02:33] we may grow into this realization every
[2:02:36] day, Lord, that we may never I know we
[2:02:41] it's a battle, but Lord, that can we can
[2:02:44] you help us this morning, Father, that
[2:02:47] we may look at ourselves in the light of
[2:02:50] what you've called us to be, Lord.
[2:02:52] Father, that we may use that to overcome
[2:02:54] and fight the enemy that we fight every
[2:02:57] day with. To know that it's Christ in
[2:02:59] me, the hope of glory. To know that I'm
[2:03:02] here as THE EXPRESSION. IF GOD DIDN'T
[2:03:06] FAIL, THE EXPRESSION in the beginning,
[2:03:08] if the expression in Christ never fail,
[2:03:10] if the expression in Moses never fail,
[2:03:13] if the expression in David didn't fail,
[2:03:16] the expression in the bride in the end
[2:03:18] time cannot fail. Why? BECAUSE IT'S THE
[2:03:21] SAME GOD BRINGING the expression all the
[2:03:23] time.
[2:03:25] Help us, Lord.
[2:03:28] Lead us, oh Father. Guide us and forgive
[2:03:31] our shortcomings which are many. Lord,
[2:03:34] renew our mind and the mind that was in
[2:03:36] Christ may be in us this morning. We
[2:03:39] commit everything that we are. Lord, if
[2:03:41] there be any need represented in the
[2:03:43] body, Lord, I know there isn't.
[2:03:46] We remember father those that are sick
[2:03:48] and
[2:03:50] father sister Lori husband we pray that
[2:03:53] lord you continue to raise him up and
[2:03:56] father give him strength and [snorts]

[2:04:01] that we read [music] in the building and
[2:04:04] father the little boy in Brazil and all
[2:04:07] of those father we lift them up this
[2:04:09] morning anybody in this building father
[2:04:12] that's sick lord your prophet said one
[2:04:15] place that all we need to do is
[2:04:17] recognize that Christ is in us and he
[2:04:20] that is in us is greater than he that is
[2:04:22] in the world. We lift our hands and say
[2:04:24] that Christ in us is greater than our
[2:04:26] sickness. Christ in us is greater than
[2:04:29] the demons that's tormenting us. Christ
[2:04:31] in us is greater than anything. And that
[2:04:34] Christ in us will overcome for us. Will
[2:04:37] you come this morning, Lord, and
[2:04:40] and just touch our bodies, Lord, and
[2:04:44] Father, [snorts] give us what we have
[2:04:45] need of. Help us, Lord, where we are
[2:04:48] weak, that we may be strong. We [music]
[2:04:50] commit everything that we are, Lord. And
[2:04:52] thank you, Father. We ask this in the
[2:04:54] name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[2:04:57] [snorts]
[2:04:58] Amen. Let's just sing [music] that at
[2:05:00] this time.

[2:12:46] Oh [music and singing] my gra.
[2:12:56] [music]
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Trust we all enjoy that this
[2:13:01] morning. [music]
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, we want to remember
[2:13:04] our meetings are coming up this coming
[2:13:06] week. We would like to have you all come
[2:13:09] out. [music] If we can get everybody
[2:13:11] with expectation, we could have a
[2:13:12] service even greater than this one.
[2:13:15] [music] But in a moment like this,
[2:13:16] because we may not get to the meetings,
[2:13:18] but we do have right now. So if you feel
[2:13:21] something tugging on your heart from
[2:13:22] what was preached [music] and you need
[2:13:24] prayer, you can come up for prayer right
[2:13:26] there where you're at. You can give of
[2:13:28] yourself to him. [music] He cares. He
[2:13:30] cares. But if we get there to that next
[2:13:32] week, it'd be awesome to get everybody
[2:13:34] there. We'll ask brother Tim to come and
[2:13:36] close our service in a [music] word of
[2:13:38] prayer.
[2:13:48] Amen. Appreciate that this morning.
[2:13:50] Wasn't [music] just a sprinkling. That
[2:13:51] was a total immersion. Amen. Very
[2:13:54] appreciative. You know, this is the
[2:13:56] greatest love story that's ever been
[2:13:58] written.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; And what I heard this morning is that
[2:14:02] you and I are the principal characters.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; The author himself is not the principal
[2:14:07] character. He's the one who wrote the
[2:14:08] book. Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation says, "Behold, I
[2:14:11] come quickly and my reward is with me."
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; We are his reward. Let's bow our heads.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, we thank you,
[2:14:20] Lord Jesus, that you've called us your
[2:14:23] own. Lord, you've come and identified
[2:14:25] us. Lord, you've given us evidence of
[2:14:28] it.
[2:14:30] Lord, may the truths that we've heard
[2:14:32] this morning, Lord, sink deep within us.
[2:14:34] May we realize Lord that it's
[2:14:37] manifesting time and Lord there's a
