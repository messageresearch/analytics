[53:39] herle amen our gracious
[53:43] father we've gathered here this morning
[53:47] because we heard a voice in this last
[53:51] [Music]
[53:53] day something that struck deep deep with
[53:58] in each of us and we felt a pull yes
[54:03] Father and
[54:05] we followed that voice and it led us to
[54:09] a
[54:10] life and father we're trusting that it
[54:14] will lead us
[54:15] home this morning we ask that you would
[54:18] help us as a body of Believers grow in
[54:22] your ways in
[54:23] your your will and your word
[54:27] and we ask this morning Father
[54:31] that we would find
[54:34] strength and
[54:36] comfort that you're mindful of us and
[54:40] that we stand true on a promise that you
[54:43] would never leave us nor forsake us but
[54:47] that you'd be with us even in us until
[54:50] the end father we covet your
[54:53] correction father for it's not punish
[54:56] ment Lord but it's to lead us in a
[54:59] Higher Ground we ask now that you would
[55:02] help us bring forth your thoughts this
[55:05] morning and that we would be kind and
[55:09] gentle one to another we ask these
[55:12] things in Jesus precious and holy name
[55:15] we pray amen amen God bless you if you
[55:19] have your bibles if you would open uh
[55:23] with me to
[55:24] Ephesians uh
[55:28] the
[55:30] uh second uh chapter I believe of
[55:34] Ephesians and the 10th
[55:49] verse and so we're just going to uh use
[55:53] this kind of as a launching board and a
[55:57] premise this morning for where we want
[56:00] to go it says for we are his
[56:06] workmanship created in Christ
[56:11] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[56:16] before
[56:17] ordained that we should walk in them our
[56:22] gracious father we ask you to bless your
[56:24] word in Jesus name we pray pray amen God
[56:28] bless you may be
[56:32] seated uh we ask you to bear with me
[56:36] this morning um as you've probably heard
[56:40] maybe through prayer request and and uh
[56:44] different uh channels that I've lost the
[56:49] vision in my uh right eye uh it's not a
[56:55] a Dreadful thing by any means it's just
[56:58] more pressure that my whole body be the
[57:01] light that was
[57:04] scripture uh but uh uh it happened on my
[57:09] left eye earlier and now it's my right
[57:12] eye so they'll go back and do the
[57:15] procedure on my right eye uh they will
[57:18] go in there and they will stick three
[57:22] little probes in my eye a camera a
[57:28] laser and I guess some sort of suction
[57:32] tube and they'll suck all the blood out
[57:34] of my eye and all the fluid out and then
[57:38] they'll take the laser and they'll seal
[57:40] up all the leaks and then they'll and
[57:44] they have a camera in there and then
[57:47] they'll reinsert new fluid in my eye and
[57:53] I then I hope they take everything out
[57:57] and uh my I'll be able to see again so
[58:00] that's the process and we trust the
[58:03] doctors and and what they see of course
[58:07] I'm open for a miraculous healing at any
[58:11] moment and I believe for that but I
[58:15] believe if this is the path that the
[58:17] Lord takes me I will have the same
[58:19] success cuz he's the great
[58:22] physician um when it comes to all so if
[58:26] I my head kind of goes all kinds of
[58:28] different places and and cuz uh
[58:32] sometimes I you know I peripherals not
[58:34] all good and every but I can still drive
[58:37] safe so uh that's good I I I normally
[58:41] drive like this but I'm going to try not
[58:44] to squint too much this morning but the
[58:47] we're not here uh you know really we're
[58:51] here for the word of God this morning
[58:53] and and
[58:56] and these um these thoughts have started
[59:00] on my
[59:01] heart
[59:03] um probably in the early
[59:07] part of last
[59:09] year
[59:11] um when my desire was
[59:16] really what pleases the Lord and really
[59:21] what what is he looking for in his
[59:25] church
[59:27] and and so much time has always been
[59:33] spent on the
[59:34] individual
[59:36] and so we would always labor about who
[59:41] are you
[59:42] and and uh how that you're predestinated
[59:46] and how that you're elected and how that
[59:50] you're chosen and we we spend a lot of
[59:53] times and basically
[59:56] that was a lot of concentration on
[59:59] ourselves you know if I could say it
[1:00:03] this way uh trying to be comfortable uh
[1:00:06] I think the world terminology is to be
[1:00:11] comfortable in your own skin I think is
[1:00:14] how they put it I hope that's a uh uh
[1:00:18] okay to say and so people try you know
[1:00:21] trying to be comfortable you know uh
[1:00:24] knowing who you are and I think that we
[1:00:27] spent enough uh time on those things and
[1:00:34] and it came to my heart and my thought
[1:00:38] okay now you know I know who I am I know
[1:00:42] that I've been
[1:00:43] chosen I I know that I'm not in
[1:00:48] danger of
[1:00:50] losing my
[1:00:52] election because it was done while I was
[1:00:55] yet a inner I I'm not in danger of
[1:01:00] failure if I could say it that way
[1:01:04] because my name was put on the Lamb's
[1:01:07] Book of Life and nothing can put it on
[1:01:11] and nothing can take it off so uh I look
[1:01:15] at all those things and I I'd say in my
[1:01:18] heart okay when is this finally going to
[1:01:23] be uh settled you know what I mean where
[1:01:27] I don't have a a reaction or an action
[1:01:31] or I I don't get go down the road and
[1:01:34] maybe lose my cool a little bit with
[1:01:37] somebody pulling in front of me that
[1:01:40] every time I have a small failure that I
[1:01:43] have to go back and rebuild my
[1:01:46] Foundation you know that in other words
[1:01:48] okay I make mistakes we all make
[1:01:50] mistakes but that doesn't change who
[1:01:53] that I
[1:01:54] am we refer to our children you know
[1:01:57] there's a lot of times that you wish
[1:02:00] they weren't your children and then
[1:02:02] there's a lot of times you're proud that
[1:02:05] they are your children and so you just
[1:02:08] go through those stages but they're
[1:02:10] still they're yours and we're his so as
[1:02:14] I begin to think uh on those things is
[1:02:18] is you know
[1:02:20] what what does the Lord want me to
[1:02:24] accomplish
[1:02:26] or do or what is the
[1:02:31] Revelation and
[1:02:33] realization that God has chosen me
[1:02:37] before the foundation of the world and
[1:02:40] well I was a yet a sinner he died for me
[1:02:44] and that he made me a promise that if he
[1:02:47] started a work in me that he would
[1:02:50] finish it till the end and that nothing
[1:02:53] could pluck me out of the pal of his
[1:02:56] hand and that my sheep uh know my voice
[1:03:01] and another they won't
[1:03:03] follow and I I was established in my
[1:03:07] heart uh beyond the shadow of a doubt
[1:03:11] that William Mary and brandom was the
[1:03:13] man that God chose to Veil himself in
[1:03:18] and he was the voice of God to this
[1:03:23] generation that he had a message
[1:03:26] for us and uh and the message was
[1:03:31] necessary because there were other
[1:03:33] voices that had entered into the world
[1:03:37] and some were saying he's here and some
[1:03:40] he was saying that he was there and they
[1:03:44] were looking to this movement and that
[1:03:47] movement and and maybe this teaching or
[1:03:50] that teaching and there need to be a
[1:03:53] voice that came back and spoke to us
[1:03:56] that said God is in his word amen in the
[1:04:00] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:04:02] with God and that word is unchanging and
[1:04:07] God is unchanging it and trying to bring
[1:04:12] us uh back to the Faith of Our
[1:04:17] Fathers if I could say it that way to
[1:04:20] the Revelation that was first delivered
[1:04:24] to our fathers from the word himself and
[1:04:28] that's what he was trying to bring us
[1:04:32] back to and so there was a place that we
[1:04:35] were trying to get back to and as we
[1:04:41] started up that Journey eat within
[1:04:44] ourselves we all followed the same
[1:04:46] pattern we came to justification
[1:04:50] sanctification we came to receive the
[1:04:53] spirit of God and and move on in to
[1:04:58] Perfection and come to the revelations
[1:05:01] and the
[1:05:02] realizations of who that he is and what
[1:05:07] is our relationship with
[1:05:10] him as joint
[1:05:13] hirs okay not not as separate
[1:05:20] entities but in this age our
[1:05:23] relationship was to be one of Fellowship
[1:05:27] joint air we refer to it in many ways as
[1:05:32] the invisible Union of the Earthly bride
[1:05:37] and the Heavenly
[1:05:40] bridegroom that there was supposed to be
[1:05:43] uh something
[1:05:45] transpire in this age that the church
[1:05:48] had been working to through Seven Ages
[1:05:52] at and at this time in history when lady
[1:05:58] OA uh came to the conditions of Sodom
[1:06:02] and glamora in the world came as it was
[1:06:05] in the days of Noah and Man became blind
[1:06:09] miserable poor wretched and naked and
[1:06:12] didn't know it and came to the place
[1:06:15] that they felt that they had need of
[1:06:18] nothing or that they could accomplish
[1:06:21] and solve what their needs were to be
[1:06:26] and they began to make great strides in
[1:06:29] science and and in education and in
[1:06:33] technology and and uh and so we we find
[1:06:38] ourselves all in this condition and
[1:06:42] we've for the years and years we've went
[1:06:45] over the Mysteries and and and the
[1:06:49] understanding of what had taken place in
[1:06:53] our
[1:06:53] generation and clearly we've come to a
[1:06:57] full knowledge according to Luke
[1:07:01] 17:30 uh that the Lord Jesus was to
[1:07:06] return in our day in other words he was
[1:07:09] to make an
[1:07:12] appearance uh or a manifestation a
[1:07:16] coming however that you would want to
[1:07:19] express it or whatever terminologies you
[1:07:23] choose to that the image fits best in
[1:07:28] your understanding but that the Lord
[1:07:31] Jesus was going to come and Veil
[1:07:36] himself in a human
[1:07:39] being and and as he
[1:07:43] did to the Jews he would also do to the
[1:07:48] Gentiles and that the same works that
[1:07:53] Jesus did so when when God came down in
[1:07:57] human flesh in Jesus he came as the son
[1:08:01] of man which meant a prophet so he was a
[1:08:06] prophet and and he had
[1:08:09] certain signs that Vindicated him that
[1:08:14] he could say if you can't believe me for
[1:08:16] my words believe me for my works and
[1:08:20] because they
[1:08:22] testify of me and so now we found out
[1:08:26] that that challenge was given to the
[1:08:29] Jews and the Gentile Church would also
[1:08:34] have to face the same
[1:08:37] challenge they would be given something
[1:08:40] to
[1:08:42] believe that was
[1:08:44] incredible but could only be received by
[1:08:48] Revelation so if God doesn't open your
[1:08:51] eyes to it it's it's impossible to to
[1:08:56] grasp and so many people have been able
[1:08:59] to follow it along intellectually but
[1:09:03] eventually your intellect will break
[1:09:05] down that's right and eventually voices
[1:09:08] will come and explanations will come and
[1:09:11] the tempter will come and intelligence
[1:09:15] will
[1:09:16] come where you can no longer trust in
[1:09:19] your mind and that's wonderful thing
[1:09:22] about a true Revelation it's so embedded
[1:09:25] in your heart that it rules over your
[1:09:28] mind and when there's a conflict between
[1:09:32] your Revelation and your mind your mind
[1:09:34] is
[1:09:39] wrong God's word is
[1:09:43] true and you know beyond a shadow of a
[1:09:46] doubt that you didn't receive this from
[1:09:51] men and he designed it this way
[1:09:56] that the church would be built on that
[1:10:00] that would become the foundation and the
[1:10:03] Chief
[1:10:04] Cornerstone of the church was that the
[1:10:07] church would be built on divine
[1:10:10] revelation Flesh and Blood have not
[1:10:13] revealed this to you in other words it
[1:10:15] wasn't taught to you it wasn't
[1:10:17] intellectually explained to you but my
[1:10:19] Father which is in heaven hath revealed
[1:10:23] it to
[1:10:24] you and and you can go along I we have
[1:10:27] many people in our congregation that for
[1:10:30] years they walk with their spouse they
[1:10:33] came to church they love the fellowship
[1:10:35] but one day they came upon the
[1:10:38] Revelation and received it for
[1:10:41] themselves and and that's what we want
[1:10:44] every individual in here to be able to
[1:10:48] say and to experience it's not Grandpa's
[1:10:52] it's not dad's it it's not
[1:10:55] Grandma it's not my brothers my sisters
[1:10:58] but I personally have received from the
[1:11:03] father and and that's what he want chose
[1:11:06] to build his church on what was the
[1:11:10] Revelation so there there's no
[1:11:13] comparison you can't compare yourself uh
[1:11:17] with anyone else because it's your
[1:11:20] Revelation and the best way ever to
[1:11:23] explain a revelation is just the way
[1:11:26] that he gave it to you and most every
[1:11:30] Revelation I've ever received was given
[1:11:33] to me by the word of God so God so loved
[1:11:36] the world he go gave His only begotten
[1:11:39] son if you have the revelation of that
[1:11:42] all you can say is God so love the world
[1:11:45] I mean there's just no way that
[1:11:47] describes it better than the word that
[1:11:50] gave it to you and so knowing that we
[1:11:54] were built on those things and and in
[1:11:56] our day the Lord made a appearance and
[1:12:02] he made a call and he was calling out
[1:12:05] the elect for this day he was separating
[1:12:09] The Believer from the
[1:12:11] unbeliever uh he was going out and
[1:12:15] gathering in the Sheep uh that were
[1:12:19] scattered in many different folds in
[1:12:22] many different religions in many
[1:12:24] different labels and
[1:12:27] Brands and yet his great goal was was to
[1:12:31] unite them and bring them together as
[1:12:36] one and as I thought on those things and
[1:12:39] I begin to look and I said father we
[1:12:42] have these great Revelations and and
[1:12:47] uh we have these
[1:12:49] truths and we have an absolute we
[1:12:53] actually have something that we all
[1:12:58] believe and so you must have had a a a
[1:13:03] great purpose uh you've granted to me
[1:13:08] all these truths and this wonderful
[1:13:11] knowledge and you called me out of
[1:13:14] California just a a hippie uh uh someone
[1:13:18] running in the wrong crowd and yet you
[1:13:23] found your way to me and and and brought
[1:13:25] me to this with and you did it in in
[1:13:29] such a a unique way that maybe
[1:13:33] personally that's the way I needed it to
[1:13:36] be but when I finally came down to it I
[1:13:40] began to say what is it that he wants us
[1:13:46] to
[1:13:48] do and
[1:13:50] become with all that he hath given us
[1:13:56] and we could go through Parables and
[1:13:59] about the the gifts and that was given
[1:14:02] and how some buried it and some you know
[1:14:06] did different things with it and they
[1:14:08] were afraid and that we were held
[1:14:13] accountable um for what is it that
[1:14:17] you've done with what that he's given
[1:14:20] you and and so uh my heart began to go
[1:14:25] in in in those ways and uh even to the
[1:14:32] point that I I begin to see that
[1:14:36] that maybe we've been trying to draw the
[1:14:41] wrong picture and uh trying to fit
[1:14:45] ourselves into a complete
[1:14:48] different
[1:14:50] mindset and I know the mindset of God's
[1:14:54] word was delivered to us in this day the
[1:14:57] word of God is the thoughts of God
[1:15:01] expressed and
[1:15:03] and I know our messenger
[1:15:07] gave many many doctrinal truths and
[1:15:12] facts that were uh
[1:15:16] outstanding but yet he also had if I
[1:15:19] could say this an
[1:15:22] overlying theme in everything that he
[1:15:26] brought and and that was the coming
[1:15:29] together of unity and fellowship and
[1:15:33] love one for
[1:15:34] another and that he he
[1:15:39] with the men and the spirits and the
[1:15:44] teachings that broke down Fellowship
[1:15:49] between
[1:15:51] people that was in fact it was referred
[1:15:55] to as the Antichrist spirit that would
[1:15:59] divide the
[1:16:01] Brotherhood and and what his heart broke
[1:16:05] for was here that God actually
[1:16:08] manifested
[1:16:10] himself using human flesh so I could say
[1:16:13] it this way he manifested himself in the
[1:16:16] flesh in our due day doing the same
[1:16:21] signs and same wonders but yet because
[1:16:24] of man's PR Pride their ego their goals
[1:16:27] and everything they rejected the very
[1:16:29] one thing that would have have brought
[1:16:32] them all together and that I believe was
[1:16:35] honestly a pure heart's
[1:16:38] desire uh if they could all be in one
[1:16:41] Accord and just serve the Lord and
[1:16:44] everybody's motive and objective would
[1:16:47] be right and it would be pure and they'd
[1:16:50] be sold out to the gospel sold out to
[1:16:55] the Lord Jesus Christ they would be in
[1:16:57] love with them and and they would be his
[1:17:00] servants and and they would love one
[1:17:04] another and and I I I I felt that and I
[1:17:07] thought well we've labored on the people
[1:17:09] so much but you know have we
[1:17:12] really moved any
[1:17:16] closer
[1:17:20] to the
[1:17:22] unity that we're promised
[1:17:26] I know there's a lot of teachings today
[1:17:29] and a a a lot of uh uh movements if I
[1:17:34] could say that and through the time uh
[1:17:38] in the years that I've been following
[1:17:40] this message I can honestly say this in
[1:17:43] all the time I've been following the
[1:17:46] message the tapes haven't changed the
[1:17:50] word hasn't changed and the spirit on
[1:17:52] those tapes hasn't changed
[1:17:55] but I've seen
[1:17:58] men and go and seem to pull something
[1:18:04] out and and run with it and present it
[1:18:09] as this this thought is going to be the
[1:18:15] thought that changes things and and
[1:18:19] different uh uh
[1:18:22] different seems like
[1:18:25] uh anointings and different excitements
[1:18:29] and different actions and different
[1:18:33] worships and and you you know just after
[1:18:36] you see so many of them and they fail
[1:18:40] because they they take a portion but
[1:18:44] you've got to take it
[1:18:46] all that that's where the beauty of the
[1:18:49] message is it's well
[1:18:52] balanced it's put together
[1:18:56] um I don't want to use the I I don't
[1:18:58] have a word in my vocabulary to say it
[1:19:03] correctly but it coordinates itself I
[1:19:07] don't want to use the word corrects
[1:19:09] itself but but it it it actually
[1:19:14] Engineers itself that these statements
[1:19:18] will eventually fit with these
[1:19:20] statements at where you don't understand
[1:19:23] one thing wait a while it'll get put in
[1:19:27] its proper place and man's always got
[1:19:31] out ahead of God trying to explain
[1:19:34] things and and uh we found that out it's
[1:19:38] just like and in our terminology started
[1:19:42] to come in and we started developing
[1:19:45] languages and terminology you know a lot
[1:19:48] today you hear a a lot about uh the
[1:19:52] bride coming of Christ you know and and
[1:19:56] people sit back and think well here's a
[1:19:58] people and now God the Lord's coming and
[1:20:02] making another appearance and another
[1:20:06] coming in in a bride and people just get
[1:20:10] so excited about that but that go Listen
[1:20:14] to Invisible Union it's very simple it's
[1:20:18] kind of the same thing but really it was
[1:20:23] the bride coming to
[1:20:27] Christ she's finally going to come to
[1:20:30] him and Unite with him and be like him
[1:20:37] and she's going to be in him and and he
[1:20:40] and her because that's what he prayed
[1:20:43] for in John 17 father may they be one as
[1:20:47] we are one may they love you and love
[1:20:50] them as you have loved me and may they
[1:20:52] love one another and uh he he he it's a
[1:20:57] beautiful thing but for some reason man
[1:21:01] has such
[1:21:03] a a drive to read something in the
[1:21:07] scripture and then feel he has to
[1:21:10] manufacture
[1:21:13] it or he has to fill in the
[1:21:19] blanks and but with God everything has
[1:21:23] its timing
[1:21:25] and so uh th this is kind of the
[1:21:28] background
[1:21:30] of if you want to know my heart and to
[1:21:34] where it is the sermons that I've and
[1:21:37] the message I'm trying to bring to you
[1:21:42] is something that I feel I see within
[1:21:46] the message and that's why I like to try
[1:21:49] to play tapes when I can so you can see
[1:21:53] at least from where that I feel I'm
[1:21:57] getting what I'm hearing from and you're
[1:22:01] always welcome to correct me uh because
[1:22:04] that's the heart's desire but one of the
[1:22:07] things I begin
[1:22:10] to is to see and desire for the
[1:22:15] individual Believers to be
[1:22:19] successful and I didn't want us to hide
[1:22:22] how many know what religion is
[1:22:25] religion's a covering that's what the
[1:22:28] prophet of God says it's something that
[1:22:30] you can put on and it hides
[1:22:34] you kind of like uh at the wedding
[1:22:38] feasts they used to all dress the same
[1:22:42] the purpose was so that the rich
[1:22:44] wouldn't stand out from the poor that
[1:22:47] was the general purpose of it because so
[1:22:51] a man can invite his business friends
[1:22:54] which might be a different class of
[1:22:56] people from his
[1:22:58] relatives you know what I mean so it was
[1:23:00] a way to make his relatives look
[1:23:03] socially uh fit you know so and also
[1:23:07] allowed him to pretend and hide of where
[1:23:11] that he come
[1:23:13] from so if I come from a little town and
[1:23:16] my daddy was a shepherd and everything
[1:23:19] and I went to the big city and now I'm
[1:23:21] hanging around with big businessmen well
[1:23:24] if they dress the same when my shepherd
[1:23:26] daddy comes and he's you know he dresses
[1:23:30] the same then it really it it's hiding
[1:23:33] me and that's what religion does is it
[1:23:37] hides you it allows us to hide ourselves
[1:23:42] within the framework of a large group of
[1:23:47] people and therefore you have people
[1:23:52] that can come
[1:23:55] they can make the
[1:23:57] appearance of being a
[1:24:01] Believer and there's no real evidence
[1:24:04] one way or the
[1:24:06] other and
[1:24:09] our messenger addressed
[1:24:12] that and it it was striking when I begin
[1:24:15] to see these things in the light that
[1:24:18] the Lord's allowing me to walk in at
[1:24:21] this time that he said there's three
[1:24:23] kinds of
[1:24:25] Believers in every
[1:24:28] group and I well I you would think that
[1:24:32] they would be very identifiable no
[1:24:35] they're
[1:24:37] not there's
[1:24:40] Believers there's make Believers and I
[1:24:43] and I'm not going to say that the make
[1:24:45] believer doesn't believe if you would
[1:24:47] allow me to use another word the
[1:24:51] unengaged believer
[1:24:56] the
[1:24:59] nonparticipant
[1:25:00] believer the show up the one that's
[1:25:06] there to fulfill the
[1:25:10] obligation uh I was raised a Catholic so
[1:25:12] you had to go to mass on Easter and you
[1:25:15] had to go to mass on
[1:25:19] Christmas and you'd see people on Easter
[1:25:22] and Christmas and that's the only only
[1:25:24] time you ever
[1:25:25] saw and we have people that are like
[1:25:29] that they make a an occasional
[1:25:31] appearance just to find out if you're
[1:25:34] still here and to let you know that
[1:25:37] they're still here and so I'm not saying
[1:25:40] they don't believe the message they
[1:25:42] don't believe in the Lord Jesus but
[1:25:44] they're
[1:25:46] unengaged they're they're
[1:25:50] nonparticipants and uh and then you have
[1:25:53] the
[1:25:55] unbeliever which is whom we
[1:25:59] invite to church we don't want to have
[1:26:03] people come from one church because
[1:26:05] they're unhappy there because the more
[1:26:08] they get to know you the more unhappy
[1:26:11] they'll be with
[1:26:13] you you know and we're no different than
[1:26:16] anybody else we're people with three
[1:26:19] kinds of
[1:26:20] Believers and if you're looking for that
[1:26:22] you'll find it
[1:26:24] and we want the unbeliever to come we
[1:26:27] want people to come to know that Jesus
[1:26:29] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:26:32] forever that the burden of sin can be
[1:26:36] lift from their lives and the indwelling
[1:26:39] spirit can come on their lives and fill
[1:26:42] them with joy and peace and love and
[1:26:45] that is actually something that gives
[1:26:48] you such a sense of well-being that you
[1:26:52] can weather Every Storm whether the
[1:26:55] winds toss you to and fro uh it doesn't
[1:26:59] matter your Anchor Holds and and your
[1:27:02] eyes are set on things above that if if
[1:27:06] my ship sinks I will rise again again
[1:27:11] it's just a peace and we want uh we want
[1:27:14] everyone to come to that we don't want
[1:27:16] them to put on a wedding garment so they
[1:27:19] look the same we want them really to
[1:27:22] know that the Lord Jesus Jesus is real
[1:27:25] he's real and he loves you and he'll
[1:27:28] walk with you and forgive you and take
[1:27:31] you by your hand and do so many things
[1:27:34] and look I don't know if it's really
[1:27:36] warm in here this morning or not is it
[1:27:38] hot in here
[1:27:40] yes okay I just didn't want to know if
[1:27:43] it was wasn't me and U so I'm going to
[1:27:47] take my coat off but I'm afraid I'll pop
[1:27:50] a button so
[1:27:55] um
[1:27:56] so with that being
[1:27:59] said uh I begin to approach it last
[1:28:04] week by talking about the success of an
[1:28:11] individual what makes individuals
[1:28:15] successful and we found out that the
[1:28:18] reason that individuals were successful
[1:28:22] because God made us to
[1:28:25] succeed and so we read here in Ephesians
[1:28:29] and we wanted this to uh these certain
[1:28:32] parts of this it says for we are his
[1:28:35] workmanship created in Christ Jesus so
[1:28:39] we're his workmanship so he put in man
[1:28:44] all the
[1:28:46] elements and the things that man should
[1:28:50] do to be
[1:28:52] successful and then we went out and we
[1:28:55] found the
[1:28:56] psychologists and the
[1:28:59] psychiatrists and the performance
[1:29:01] coaches and the athletic coaches and we
[1:29:05] went out and we found all these
[1:29:09] characteristics that they've
[1:29:12] identified as things that a person must
[1:29:16] do in order to be
[1:29:19] successful and then come to find out we
[1:29:22] could go right back into the
[1:29:25] scripture and find every single one of
[1:29:28] them in the word of God the difference
[1:29:32] was there were two different measures of
[1:29:36] success one person measures success by a
[1:29:41] trophy or a
[1:29:43] title or uh uh uh some Financial
[1:29:47] goal and therefore they took the
[1:29:51] practices that were scriptural practices
[1:29:56] took chapter and verse off of
[1:30:00] them and then presented them to man as
[1:30:06] being steps and
[1:30:09] meters of
[1:30:13] success and they
[1:30:16] worked and then Satan kind of flipped
[1:30:19] one on us and said oh if you practice
[1:30:24] that then then you're of the world
[1:30:29] no Satan stole
[1:30:32] them but we can do those same things I
[1:30:36] went over just dozens of
[1:30:39] them we can do practice those same
[1:30:42] things and be
[1:30:44] successful as a
[1:30:47] Christian have
[1:30:49] fruits have Works have accomplishments
[1:30:54] if we are able to practice the
[1:30:58] disciplines do the things that were
[1:31:02] spoken of in the scripture and the
[1:31:05] things that we could find in the
[1:31:08] scripture that were
[1:31:11] practicing practiced by the great
[1:31:15] Patriarchs in the word of
[1:31:17] God and so we found that those things
[1:31:21] were uh stolen from the
[1:31:25] scripture because the word of God's
[1:31:28] Eternal this same word existed before it
[1:31:32] was
[1:31:34] printed the spoken word was the original
[1:31:37] seed so it was spoken so now that it
[1:31:41] finally got written and we can read it
[1:31:43] and reference it uh but before it was
[1:31:47] passed from lip to ear by the leadership
[1:31:51] of the Holy Spirit men under the
[1:31:53] influence of the holy spirit in diverse
[1:31:56] times and Sous manners God spoke to our
[1:31:59] fathers by his spirit and that was
[1:32:02] communicated and practiced and the
[1:32:05] result would come so we talked just a
[1:32:08] little bit last uh week about the
[1:32:11] success of the
[1:32:14] individual now I I want to go to
[1:32:19] another step of
[1:32:22] that and I want to point out again that
[1:32:28] these principles that the world
[1:32:33] uses were not created by the
[1:32:38] world they were perverted by the world
[1:32:43] the scripture says we are his
[1:32:45] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:32:49] good works which God hath before
[1:32:53] ordained
[1:32:54] that we should walk in them so we
[1:32:57] understand that God had a plan so he put
[1:33:02] all these characteristics of success in
[1:33:05] a man that a man could
[1:33:08] fulfill what it is that God wanted him
[1:33:12] to do and be successful at it then
[1:33:16] religion
[1:33:17] came around and substituted success with
[1:33:22] Doctrine with teaching
[1:33:24] with belief belief without works belief
[1:33:29] without action belief without light
[1:33:33] belief without the desire or a pattern
[1:33:37] of good works so P men now could believe
[1:33:41] in God and do
[1:33:46] nothing and other words the
[1:33:50] commission had totally gone void from
[1:33:53] the
[1:33:54] Church go into all the world preach the
[1:33:57] gospel these signs shall follow them
[1:34:00] that believe they shall lay hands on the
[1:34:02] sick they shall recover he
[1:34:04] so all that got
[1:34:08] substituted with man thinking that they
[1:34:11] could believe in their head have some
[1:34:15] sort of
[1:34:17] sensation and then they could go
[1:34:21] forward holding on to to what that they
[1:34:25] believe and not be able to see any
[1:34:32] fruit and and then man kind of solved
[1:34:37] that so they just did fruits
[1:34:41] amongst their
[1:34:46] buddies so you know and they took a
[1:34:49] scripture you know it says you know do
[1:34:52] these things but especially at the
[1:34:53] household of faith well they just took
[1:34:56] the household of faith because they knew
[1:34:59] that if they did this they would get it
[1:35:01] in return and Jesus says don't do it
[1:35:05] that you might receive it again so
[1:35:09] obviously he knew that these things
[1:35:12] would go so that we're for ordained and
[1:35:14] we're and and so it it was before
[1:35:18] ordained so we understood and this is
[1:35:22] what I hope that you can I can expressed
[1:35:24] to you this morning in my limit of
[1:35:27] vocabulary that that God had a
[1:35:31] plan he had something he wanted to
[1:35:34] accomplish in you as an
[1:35:38] individual he wanted you to be an
[1:35:41] ambassador a representative he wanted
[1:35:44] your light to shine he wanted it on the
[1:35:47] hillside he wanted your good works to
[1:35:50] glorify the Father which is in heaven he
[1:35:53] he he he he he wanted the uh in fact his
[1:35:57] love was so perfected one of my very
[1:36:00] favorite scriptures that here in his
[1:36:02] love made perfect that as he is so are
[1:36:06] we in this world so that's what his goal
[1:36:09] and but he gave us the tools to do
[1:36:16] it so a man that obtains a high level in
[1:36:21] corporate what we would call corporate
[1:36:24] American success a Christian can do the
[1:36:27] same things and be a successful
[1:36:30] Christian and be be a officer in in the
[1:36:34] spiritual realm above a corporate and
[1:36:38] him have eternal
[1:36:41] rewards instead of a building named
[1:36:45] after
[1:36:46] him I want a street in glory I don't
[1:36:50] want a building
[1:36:55] you know what I mean or a
[1:36:58] freeway how have you ever been on LBJ
[1:37:01] Freeway every time on LBJ Freeway I hate
[1:37:04] that
[1:37:06] freeway then makes you want to hate the
[1:37:09] guy it's named
[1:37:10] after who never wanted a road named
[1:37:13] after him that Bumper to Bumper all the
[1:37:16] time man's
[1:37:19] warped and I is one so I know what I'm
[1:37:22] talking about
[1:37:25] so we so God
[1:37:30] instituted this it was part of his plan
[1:37:34] so now I'm going to take it if you would
[1:37:37] bear with me for a few moments from the
[1:37:42] individual because you have to have
[1:37:45] individuals when we talk about making
[1:37:48] the picture puzzle picture every
[1:37:51] individual piece is important to the
[1:37:56] picture there's no big pieces or little
[1:38:01] pieces without all of the pieces you
[1:38:05] don't have the
[1:38:09] picture that's how important you are as
[1:38:12] an
[1:38:13] individual that's how important it is
[1:38:17] that you develop your individual
[1:38:21] Christian spiritual
[1:38:26] success and that you find your
[1:38:31] calling and that's where we want to go
[1:38:34] this morning if you would uh be be with
[1:38:38] me for a few moments is they call it the
[1:38:43] success of the
[1:38:46] team team
[1:38:49] success there's certain characteristics
[1:38:53] that any
[1:38:55] successful
[1:38:57] team
[1:38:58] has football teams basketball teams
[1:39:03] baseball teams corporate teams
[1:39:06] development teams management teams
[1:39:10] whatever it is whatever it comes
[1:39:13] business teams the military teams
[1:39:18] Medical
[1:39:22] Teams there is certain
[1:39:25] characteristics and things
[1:39:29] that have to be in place in order for
[1:39:33] that team to work and be
[1:39:36] successful they call it teams what do we
[1:39:39] call it
[1:39:43] body a
[1:39:46] body we are a body of
[1:39:51] Believers it was addressed in the
[1:39:53] Scriptures it was addressed by our
[1:39:58] messenger and so we want to start just
[1:40:02] if you would to turn with me to
[1:40:05] Corinthians the 12th
[1:40:12] chapter and we're going to read this
[1:40:15] chapter and I want you to understand now
[1:40:18] here's God has ordained this and
[1:40:22] instituted the
[1:40:25] body okay this was it wasn't something
[1:40:29] that just was came up with just like God
[1:40:33] ordained and instituted your personal
[1:40:37] success he's ordained and instituted the
[1:40:41] success of the
[1:40:43] body in other words the
[1:40:46] individuals working together uniting
[1:40:50] together as a body in fact there was a
[1:40:54] sermon preached called uniting time and
[1:40:57] sign how that the world and all these
[1:41:01] different things are uniting together in
[1:41:04] other words these characteristics and
[1:41:07] attributes of a team of a union are
[1:41:12] starting to fall in place and again they
[1:41:15] were stolen from
[1:41:17] us we're the original
[1:41:20] team we're the original body
[1:41:25] we have the original
[1:41:29] plan God had the first
[1:41:32] Eden Satan took every instrument that
[1:41:36] God had because he couldn't create and
[1:41:39] perverted it to make civilization and
[1:41:43] education what we have today and Satan's
[1:41:46] been trying to mix religion and
[1:41:49] civilization and education together the
[1:41:53] biggest deception that there ever
[1:41:57] is so you can have
[1:42:02] both but you
[1:42:04] can't come out from amongst them and be
[1:42:07] ye separate how can two walk together
[1:42:10] and L they agree you'll either serve one
[1:42:13] master or the
[1:42:16] other you'll either be hot or
[1:42:19] cold so we're coming to that time
[1:42:24] and I'm saying this because you can't
[1:42:26] sit back
[1:42:30] dormant you can't remain in your
[1:42:34] religious
[1:42:36] stuper
[1:42:40] unengaged not
[1:42:43] participating not fulfilling not
[1:42:46] advancing in character not being nonf
[1:42:50] fruitful the word says you'll be
[1:42:53] up you'll be hewed you'll be trimmed
[1:42:56] you'll be cast down you'll be cut in the
[1:42:58] fire oh Don't Preach that side of the
[1:43:03] Gospel but you can't get in on
[1:43:09] religion you can't get in on
[1:43:14] self-belief you must be born again by
[1:43:18] the spirit of God and if you're born
[1:43:21] again then the spirit will be in you and
[1:43:24] the spirit will do those
[1:43:28] foreordained good
[1:43:33] works all those things I preached last
[1:43:36] week are the character worth of success
[1:43:39] they're all good
[1:43:42] works and there's good works of a
[1:43:48] body so let's just read
[1:43:54] so if I miss a word or two it's I'm not
[1:43:57] used to reading with one
[1:44:00] eye now concerning spiritual gifts
[1:44:03] Brethren I would not have you be
[1:44:06] ignorant you know that ye were Gentiles
[1:44:10] carried away unto these dumb Idols even
[1:44:14] as ye were
[1:44:16] LED wherefore I give you to understand
[1:44:21] that no man speaketh by the spirit of
[1:44:24] God
[1:44:26] calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man
[1:44:30] can say that Jesus is Lord but by the
[1:44:34] Holy
[1:44:36] Ghost now there are diversities of gifts
[1:44:40] but the same
[1:44:43] spirit and there are differences of
[1:44:47] administration but the same Lord so
[1:44:50] these things were institut Ed by
[1:45:02] God and there are diversities of
[1:45:06] operations but it's the same God which
[1:45:09] worketh all in
[1:45:11] all but the
[1:45:13] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:45:16] every man to profit with all so we you
[1:45:22] you begin to see the picture he put
[1:45:25] something now this is not to be
[1:45:30] manufactured or it isn't fill in the
[1:45:34] blanks so the scripture says some are
[1:45:37] given tongues so someone says oh we've
[1:45:39] got to have
[1:45:41] tongues we're in other words we're going
[1:45:43] to fulfill that scripture we're going to
[1:45:48] fill in that blank it's not how it works
[1:45:56] it's it's the profit with all it has
[1:45:59] nothing to do with personal Glory it has
[1:46:02] to do with the
[1:46:05] team the
[1:46:07] body the surgical
[1:46:11] team everybody's got to work
[1:46:14] together he said for to one is given by
[1:46:19] the spirit the word of wisdom
[1:46:23] to another the word of
[1:46:25] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[1:46:30] Faith by The Same Spirit to another the
[1:46:34] gifts of healing by The Same
[1:46:39] Spirit to another the working of
[1:46:42] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[1:46:46] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[1:46:49] kinds of tongues to another
[1:46:51] interpretations of tongues but all these
[1:46:55] worketh that one and the selfsame spirit
[1:47:00] dividing to every man several as he will
[1:47:05] now so we see that these are things that
[1:47:09] are done by the
[1:47:14] spirit so the gifts
[1:47:16] are in the
[1:47:19] church not necessarily solely to the
[1:47:25] individual that's why he told us don't
[1:47:27] seek after the gift seek after the
[1:47:34] giver and if he so
[1:47:37] chooses if it's according to his will if
[1:47:41] it's un
[1:47:43] needful then those are available to the
[1:47:46] Believers that are filled with his
[1:47:48] Spirit they are not to be
[1:47:51] manufactured they they are not to be
[1:47:53] filled in the
[1:47:56] blank someone would come here and say
[1:47:59] who speaks in tongues who interprets who
[1:48:03] does
[1:48:05] that so how would you answer that we all
[1:48:10] do we all have the self-same
[1:48:13] spirit we're all born by one Spirit
[1:48:17] Redeemed by one spirit filled by one
[1:48:21] Spirit we live live by his
[1:48:25] Spirit but man has always Tri to
[1:48:28] manufacture
[1:48:30] something the the we'll read it here in
[1:48:33] a moment the scripture says firstly
[1:48:36] there was Apostles you know then
[1:48:39] prophets and then this and then that
[1:48:42] evangelist you know prophets evangelist
[1:48:44] teachers and and and so man
[1:48:47] automatically says first
[1:48:50] apostles so that means number
[1:48:53] one highest on the
[1:48:56] list right so now man's got this whole
[1:49:01] desire it in his heart to have some sort
[1:49:05] of
[1:49:07] hierarchy and they do it with the gift
[1:49:10] some sort of hierarchy hierarchy there's
[1:49:13] no hierarchy there's no big eyes there's
[1:49:16] no little
[1:49:18] use you say well why was it first
[1:49:21] apostles because that's what it starts
[1:49:25] with one being sent one going
[1:49:30] out and then people begin to speak and
[1:49:33] and and tell things of how that things
[1:49:36] are and this was that and they they
[1:49:39] begin to speak and then the Evangelist
[1:49:41] comes in and stirs it up and then the
[1:49:44] teacher comes in and then eventually the
[1:49:46] pastor comes in there's no big ey
[1:49:49] there's no little you there's no one
[1:49:52] great
[1:49:53] that's why you go these guys are so oops
[1:49:55] I was going to say something I'm trying
[1:49:57] to
[1:49:58] overcome thank you Lord you find on so
[1:50:01] many of these churches they have
[1:50:06] Apostle you know Apostle JJ
[1:50:12] Brown well that's high of the
[1:50:16] ladder I've made it to
[1:50:20] Apostle there's no there's no higher
[1:50:26] authority I just like to be able to say
[1:50:29] I'm born
[1:50:31] again and the love and the
[1:50:34] light of Jesus
[1:50:36] Christ shines within my heart yes sir
[1:50:40] Wherever I Go it the love of God is shed
[1:50:44] abroad in My Heart by the Holy
[1:50:47] Spirit but that that's this humanism
[1:50:52] because Satan took our means of
[1:50:56] success and stole
[1:50:59] it and that we're supposed to possess
[1:51:02] the gates of our
[1:51:03] enemies so this is what he says so now
[1:51:07] qu so they I'm going to read some things
[1:51:09] in a moment so they call it a
[1:51:12] team right has anybody been on a sales
[1:51:16] team some of you have a surgical
[1:51:20] team I know Ron's back there he's been
[1:51:22] on surgical teams can you imagine a guy
[1:51:25] working and some other guy coming on to
[1:51:26] the side and he's going to do something
[1:51:31] different when they operate on my eye I
[1:51:34] want everybody in that team to be on the
[1:51:36] same
[1:51:38] page it always scares me to death when
[1:51:41] they walk in and they ask you what
[1:51:45] I what do you mean what
[1:51:48] I you don't
[1:51:50] know and then they put a big
[1:51:54] on your
[1:52:00] forehead how
[1:52:02] you
[1:52:04] really yeah well that you know what
[1:52:07] there's a reason for
[1:52:10] that and when it's all over you're glad
[1:52:12] that they didn't work on the wrong
[1:52:15] one so now let's look we're talking now
[1:52:18] let's take the word team and insert body
[1:52:22] God
[1:52:23] instituted the
[1:52:25] body he gave you the characteristics of
[1:52:29] success and now he positionally places
[1:52:33] you in a
[1:52:37] body this is just Sunday school we'll
[1:52:39] get through
[1:52:41] it for as the body is
[1:52:44] one and hath many
[1:52:46] members and all the members of that one
[1:52:50] body being many
[1:52:53] are one
[1:52:55] body so also is Christ for by one Spirit
[1:53:01] we are all baptized into one body
[1:53:07] whether we be jew or Gentile whether we
[1:53:10] be Bond or
[1:53:13] free and have been all and have all been
[1:53:18] made to drink unto one spirit
[1:53:23] for the body is not one member but many
[1:53:27] if the foot shall say because I am not
[1:53:30] the hand I am not of the body it is
[1:53:34] therefore not of the
[1:53:38] body and if the ear shall say because I
[1:53:41] am not the eye I am not of the body it
[1:53:47] is therefore not of the body if the
[1:53:51] whole body were and I where were the
[1:53:54] hearing if the whole were the hearing
[1:53:57] where were the smelling but now hath God
[1:54:01] set the
[1:54:03] members every one of them in the body as
[1:54:08] H hath pleased
[1:54:10] him that ought to raise a great big
[1:54:14] question where have you been
[1:54:18] placed are you a part of the body or are
[1:54:21] you not part of the
[1:54:24] body we don't even consider these things
[1:54:28] anymore but they're part of the Eternal
[1:54:31] part of God God wants his
[1:54:36] team his
[1:54:38] body it's a body he foreordained
[1:54:43] it it was his will it was his plan that
[1:54:47] the church would work as a body
[1:54:52] and every member in that body had a role
[1:54:56] to
[1:54:58] play had a part to play every piece of
[1:55:03] the puzzle was important to the puzzle
[1:55:07] but if you are in the religious realm
[1:55:11] you just belong to the message you just
[1:55:15] believe the message and this church is
[1:55:19] just a place you go to fulfill your
[1:55:22] message message and you go live your
[1:55:25] life well don't be surprised when the
[1:55:28] day comes that you find out you're not
[1:55:31] part of the body because you never made
[1:55:34] yourself part of the body you never
[1:55:37] contributed to the body you never joined
[1:55:41] yourself to the body you never bore the
[1:55:43] burdens of the body you never prayed for
[1:55:46] the body you were a
[1:55:50] churchgoer god has a
[1:56:00] body and that's our problem in the
[1:56:03] message we've all joined the message but
[1:56:05] we haven't joined the
[1:56:09] church the
[1:56:13] body the bride body of the Lord
[1:56:18] Jesus we're not connected
[1:56:23] we don't hook up with one another we
[1:56:25] don't participate with one another we
[1:56:27] don't care with one
[1:56:29] another Well if you really want the best
[1:56:32] Sunday religion I suggest you go join
[1:56:35] the Catholic
[1:56:37] Church you show up on Sunday they have a
[1:56:41] little schedule and then if you do
[1:56:43] something wrong you go in the Box tell
[1:56:45] the priest he wipes your sins off and
[1:56:47] you go do them
[1:56:49] again quite a program
[1:56:53] but I don't want to be a part of
[1:56:54] something that's not
[1:56:58] God if God has a bride which is referred
[1:57:02] to as his church which is referred to
[1:57:04] his body I want to be a part of
[1:57:07] it I want to know my place I want to
[1:57:11] know my role I want to know what it is
[1:57:13] and it comes natural to my heart I don't
[1:57:17] have to go fill in the blank I have to
[1:57:19] get in my prayer closet I have to be in
[1:57:21] Union with the spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:57:24] the footsteps of the righteous are led
[1:57:26] by the Lord I have to be able to become
[1:57:29] tender to the holy unction but if you
[1:57:32] don't care about the spirit you don't
[1:57:34] get in the spirit you don't pray in the
[1:57:37] spirit you don't get alone with God
[1:57:39] you're not seeking a job you're not
[1:57:41] seeking a part you're not seeking a
[1:57:44] place you're not seeking anything well
[1:57:46] then good luck because it's a body
[1:57:50] that's being Resurrected
[1:58:00] but now God has set the
[1:58:03] members every one of them in the body
[1:58:06] now God has
[1:58:09] set the members every one of them in the
[1:58:16] body let me say that again God has set
[1:58:21] the members
[1:58:22] in the
[1:58:25] body that ought to
[1:58:28] invoke some sort of
[1:58:31] responsibility and
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:38] self-examination you know I I we're here
[1:58:42] to go to
[1:58:44] heaven we can't take a failed
[1:58:48] method of denominational religion to
[1:58:52] denominational theories and approaches
[1:58:55] to the scripture we can't be doing what
[1:58:58] everybody else has been doing in the
[1:59:01] name of the message do the same thing
[1:59:04] and think we're going to get a different
[1:59:05] result that spiritual
[1:59:14] insanity and this is not going to every
[1:59:18] all the message
[1:59:20] people every every Pastor is responsible
[1:59:24] for their own
[1:59:27] church and I feel my responsibility is
[1:59:30] to the word of God and the message of
[1:59:32] the hour and what the prophet of God
[1:59:37] taught it and I would be I would be a
[1:59:42] myth of my due
[1:59:44] diligence if I didn't tell you these
[1:59:48] things because I don't want you if I go
[1:59:52] there I don't want you to be gnawing and
[1:59:54] chewing on
[1:59:58] me so he say so there he says
[2:00:06] so so God has said as it pleased him and
[2:00:10] if they were all one member where were
[2:00:13] the body but now are they many members
[2:00:20] but but yet one body and the eye cannot
[2:00:24] say to the hand I have no need of
[2:00:28] thee nor
[2:00:30] the head to the feet I have no need of
[2:00:35] thee so you can't say that you don't
[2:00:38] have need of the
[2:00:41] body that you don't have need of one
[2:00:46] another right you can't make it on your
[2:00:48] own
[2:00:52] and I'm I'm I'm I'm saying these things
[2:00:55] this morning because I want you to start
[2:00:56] considering them because I think this is
[2:01:00] where God's taking the church to a
[2:01:03] uniting with his
[2:01:06] word n much more those members of the
[2:01:09] body which seem to be more feeble are
[2:01:13] necessary and those members of the body
[2:01:16] which we think to be less honorable unto
[2:01:20] these we bestow more abundant honor and
[2:01:24] our uncomely parts have more abundant
[2:01:28] comeliness
[2:01:30] for our comonly parts have no need but
[2:01:34] God hath tempered the body together
[2:01:38] having given more abundant honor to that
[2:01:42] part which lackthe
[2:01:49] [Music]
[2:01:52] another he's the boss he's the
[2:01:55] leader you
[2:01:57] know you know and you know and a lot of
[2:02:00] times people think they're working for
[2:02:02] me do you know what I mean you're not
[2:02:06] working for me because I wouldn't have
[2:02:10] you
[2:02:13] right I mean that's how we we
[2:02:16] are but we're not working for we I
[2:02:20] didn't build this church you built this
[2:02:25] church I might have called you but you
[2:02:27] didn't do it for me you didn't get my
[2:02:30] reward you got his
[2:02:35] reward everything we did around here
[2:02:37] that you you put in you gave it to him
[2:02:41] you gave your time you gave your effort
[2:02:44] you give your thing you didn't do it for
[2:02:46] me you did it for him and if it's in
[2:02:50] your mind that oh we're working for him
[2:02:53] and he's a slave driver I'm a slave
[2:02:57] driver you know what I mean I trying to
[2:02:59] get as much done in my lifetime as I
[2:03:02] can I want to give every scent I've got
[2:03:06] I want to burn my Wick down to the
[2:03:08] bottom when you find my candle all I
[2:03:11] want you to have left that little silver
[2:03:14] thing at the body where's McGary he's
[2:03:16] all gone he's spent
[2:03:23] I'm what Reserve something for
[2:03:29] what everybody say why don't you just
[2:03:31] sit around and lay around
[2:03:35] really and do what I don't know what
[2:03:38] it's
[2:03:41] like you know what I mean let's work
[2:03:44] well it's day let's do something for the
[2:03:47] kingdom we build this let's fill it up
[2:03:51] amen
[2:03:52] then I'll go with rest with my fathers
[2:03:54] and you can build another one if the
[2:03:57] Lord
[2:04:01] carries you're a part of
[2:04:06] it that there should be no sisms in the
[2:04:12] body but that the members should have
[2:04:16] the same care one for another and
[2:04:21] whether one member suffereth all the
[2:04:23] members suffer with it or one member be
[2:04:26] honored all the members Rejoice with it
[2:04:29] now ye are the body of Christ and
[2:04:34] members in
[2:04:39] particular you have to find your
[2:04:45] peculiarity and God hath set some in the
[2:04:50] church first upon Apostles secondary
[2:04:53] prophets third teachers after that
[2:04:56] Miracles Gifts of healings helps
[2:04:58] governments diversity of tongues are all
[2:05:02] Apostles are all prophets are all
[2:05:06] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[2:05:09] have all the gifts of healing do all
[2:05:12] speak in tongues do all interpret but
[2:05:14] covet earnestly the best
[2:05:16] gifts and yet show I unto you a more
[2:05:21] excellent way and that's why you can't
[2:05:24] separate Hebrews 13 from Hebrews
[2:05:29] 12 so you understand God's in God
[2:05:32] instituted the
[2:05:34] team right every team that you see out
[2:05:38] there sales team production team a
[2:05:41] research team uh development team
[2:05:46] medical team every single team came from
[2:05:49] the word of God
[2:05:52] just God's in
[2:05:57] control seven
[2:06:04] characteristics
[2:06:06] of a
[2:06:09] team if I could say it this way seven
[2:06:14] characteristics of the
[2:06:17] body number one Trust
[2:06:24] I also made aide no meaningful
[2:06:27] purpose you have to trust that what
[2:06:30] you're
[2:06:32] doing that you got to trust one
[2:06:39] another I I've got to believe that
[2:06:42] you're here for the same reason that I'm
[2:06:46] here I have to believe that we're in
[2:06:49] this together
[2:06:51] I have to believe that nobody has
[2:06:54] alternative motive and
[2:06:56] objectives we're not here you're we're
[2:07:00] you're not here to dig up dirt on one
[2:07:02] another you're not here to see what
[2:07:05] somebody's wearing you're not here to
[2:07:08] get the
[2:07:09] latest uh
[2:07:12] Buzz you know or who child did this or
[2:07:16] or or who got kicked out of school and
[2:07:19] who got on a fight in the playground and
[2:07:22] who likes who and which boy is the dream
[2:07:25] boat of the day and which girl is the is
[2:07:29] looking so
[2:07:33] sweet
[2:07:35] right we trust one
[2:07:38] another of a team works together I I
[2:07:42] like you know one of the things that uh
[2:07:45] you hear different things in the Sports
[2:07:47] World they they say they say Stars wins
[2:07:51] games
[2:07:52] but teams win
[2:07:57] championships one guy can do it all for
[2:08:01] by himself for a little while but it
[2:08:04] takes everybody to do it every day and
[2:08:07] you've got to trust that that person
[2:08:11] next to you is part of your
[2:08:13] team is part of the
[2:08:16] body you can't be saying this one's not
[2:08:19] a Christian you that's a number one
[2:08:22] issue they say is you have to have
[2:08:26] trust the second is clear
[2:08:32] communication you've got to be able to
[2:08:35] communicate a clear
[2:08:37] Communication in other words the same
[2:08:39] rules for
[2:08:42] everybody if church starts at certain
[2:08:46] time everybody makes it to church at a
[2:08:49] certain time if the rule if the if the
[2:08:54] our absolute said to be here 30 minutes
[2:08:58] early then it would seem that we would
[2:09:02] trust one another that this is all what
[2:09:05] we believe to be the messenger for the
[2:09:08] day the absolute and what he said you
[2:09:11] say is that a a law no it's a guideline
[2:09:14] it's something that you make an effort
[2:09:17] to
[2:09:18] obtain I'm trusting you
[2:09:23] that you will get here and be prayed
[2:09:26] up I I it's hard to build a
[2:09:30] body
[2:09:32] when you'll be at work at 8:00 and come
[2:09:37] to church 30 minutes
[2:09:39] late what does that say to the
[2:09:43] body it says I have no trust in you I
[2:09:47] have no respect in you I'm really not a
[2:09:51] part of
[2:09:53] you you can come when you can come and I
[2:09:57] can come when I can come I can do what I
[2:10:01] want you do what you want welcome that's
[2:10:05] lady oia that's people's
[2:10:10] rights you know it's fine for us to have
[2:10:13] a nice group and have Fellowship PA have
[2:10:16] a pavilion but we're not talking about
[2:10:20] that
[2:10:21] we're talking about making it to
[2:10:24] Glory we're talking about what God sees
[2:10:27] when he looks at our life now does he
[2:10:30] see a member of the body does he see a
[2:10:33] hand does he see a foot does he see an
[2:10:35] eye does he see an ear does he see
[2:10:38] somebody that's participating in the
[2:10:40] body or are you
[2:10:45] torn and I just feel in my heart these
[2:10:48] are some of the things the Lord wants us
[2:10:50] to start to become more mindful of it's
[2:10:53] going to make us better Christians clear
[2:10:57] Communications you have the same
[2:11:01] codes the same dress codes the same
[2:11:05] entertainment
[2:11:07] codes the same value
[2:11:10] system you know what I mean uh you you
[2:11:14] you have the same you you have clear
[2:11:16] Communications yay be yay and NB nay
[2:11:22] you you you you you a good body or a
[2:11:27] good team they
[2:11:29] communicate they have good let the Comm
[2:11:32] let no bitter or foul communication come
[2:11:35] out your mouth and I could give read
[2:11:38] scripture after scripture I got a lot of
[2:11:40] them but I'm going to move quickly
[2:11:41] because of time so you have that uh
[2:11:45] clear communication leads to what they
[2:11:48] call a culture
[2:11:51] when people start letting things slip
[2:11:53] and it no matter matters and this don't
[2:11:55] matter then the standard goes
[2:11:59] down anybody been in a company when all
[2:12:01] of a sudden the standards go down you
[2:12:04] know the doors don't get locked the
[2:12:06] toilets don't get flushed the the
[2:12:09] baskets don't get
[2:12:10] emptied you know what I mean let that go
[2:12:13] on for two
[2:12:16] weeks everybody knows the same everybody
[2:12:19] knows to take their diapers home
[2:12:22] home don't leave your diapers here
[2:12:25] till Wednesday when I come in the church
[2:12:28] Wednesday morning and I think my
[2:12:34] goodness I want to call the Exterminator
[2:12:36] right I think something died in
[2:12:39] here because nobody took their diaper
[2:12:42] home you say oh brother McGary I thought
[2:12:44] this is religion this is religion at its
[2:12:49] finest amen this is Christianity at its
[2:12:54] best you
[2:12:56] care just like we asked you not to stand
[2:12:59] in the in the
[2:13:02] driveways I almost took out a girl the
[2:13:05] other
[2:13:06] day you notice if you're wearing false
[2:13:09] teeth we have speed
[2:13:14] bumps and if people keep speeding
[2:13:17] through the parking lot I'll put more of
[2:13:19] them up
[2:13:26] but if you're not going to care for the
[2:13:28] little ones and you're not going to care
[2:13:31] we're too crowded
[2:13:33] anyway if you don't want to communicate
[2:13:35] and be part of the program please feel
[2:13:38] free I'll give you a list of other
[2:13:41] churches that believe these
[2:13:44] things but we cannot go on leaving
[2:13:48] sloppy Christian lives with no
[2:13:53] regard for the church for its leadership
[2:13:58] for its
[2:13:59] offices and just think that we can come
[2:14:01] and go as we
[2:14:10] please you say oh brother MC I I show
[2:14:13] you the quote where brother Pam said if
[2:14:14] you can't keep your kid behave leave
[2:14:17] them home he said it
[2:14:22] and I'm not saying I love as nicely as
[2:14:24] brother random loved but anyway clear
[2:14:28] communication we dress the
[2:14:32] same wives teach the younger women how
[2:14:36] to be good
[2:14:37] wives sisters watch one another's dress
[2:14:41] watch the high heels watch the tight
[2:14:44] clothes maybe you don't know these
[2:14:46] things but somebody's got to say them
[2:14:52] so that's a good
[2:14:53] team a good body everybody
[2:14:58] communicates we have an absolute the
[2:15:01] word of God we follow what our messenger
[2:15:04] said we study to show ourselves
[2:15:08] approved there's things that we
[2:15:11] do here's a the they they put it third
[2:15:15] some people put it
[2:15:18] first defined and definite roles and
[2:15:27] responsibilities definite roles and
[2:15:31] responsibilities mothers are responsible

[2:15:40] mothers be a body be taking care of one

[2:15:51] Mysteries the Mysteries aren't doing us
[2:15:53] any
[2:15:55] good our lives are are out of order
[2:15:59] we're in chaos we're in
[2:16:02] confusion there's no discipline there's
[2:16:04] no discipline at home there's no
[2:16:07] discipline in church there there's
[2:16:09] there's no discipline in our
[2:16:13] lives and and it's fine but do you
[2:16:19] understand the squeeze has coming it's
[2:16:21] getting more narrow it's getting more
[2:16:23] shaken down it's going to take more
[2:16:26] diligence more discipline more
[2:16:28] dedication you you can't we just got to
[2:16:31] pull it together I'm preaching to
[2:16:34] myself we have roles and
[2:16:38] responsibilities we pray without ceasing
[2:16:41] we study to show ourselves approved we
[2:16:44] lay for ourselves a pattern of Good
[2:16:46] Works we've got responsibility to one

[2:17:13] one another up I've got a role I play I
[2:17:16] come to church to raise my hands to
[2:17:18] praise God to sing at the top of my lung
[2:17:21] to let me say well I don't sing the song
[2:17:23] in your own
[2:17:27] language but don't sit there like a
[2:17:31] prune or a
[2:17:34] grape you
[2:17:38] know get
[2:17:40] involved be a part the scripture says
[2:17:44] let us lift up holy
[2:17:46] hands let us make melody in Psalms and
[2:17:50] hymns let us exhort one
[2:17:56] another these are all necessary
[2:17:59] things you have to have engaged
[2:18:03] leadership let all things be done
[2:18:07] decently and in
[2:18:09] order we we got def we have to have a
[2:18:13] collective goal what's our Collective
[2:18:16] goal rapture
[2:18:21] so brother MC man I've never heard you
[2:18:23] preach this hard in in my whole life
[2:18:26] chew everybody out I want you to make
[2:18:29] the
[2:18:30] Rapture it's about the
[2:18:34] Rapture and Satan is like a roaring lion
[2:18:38] going about seeking him or devour
[2:18:41] absolutely putting Amnesia on the church
[2:18:45] I've watched it in young people I've
[2:18:47] watched churches where their young
[2:18:49] people get more worldly more worldly
[2:18:51] they spend more time at the gym and in
[2:18:53] church they're all starting to wear high
[2:18:55] heels their dresses are as close to
[2:18:58] their knees as they possibly can be they
[2:19:00] they got more blush on and ey Shadow and
[2:19:04] and eyelash stuff and and you
[2:19:08] know more lower this and sleeveless and
[2:19:12] all that's going on in the church and
[2:19:15] and we have a simple thing our Prophet
[2:19:17] said you know you know we know how the
[2:19:20] sheep got out but how did the goats get
[2:19:28] in and it's
[2:19:30] like and and all you just wrap it up
[2:19:34] well they'll come to Christ
[2:19:37] eventually that's not even
[2:19:42] scriptural you sometimes you got to lay
[2:19:44] down lawn I know what it's like to fight
[2:19:46] with
[2:19:49] teenagers you know tooth and nail day in
[2:19:52] and day
[2:19:54] out tell them they're not doing right
[2:19:56] and them not doing right but I tell you
[2:20:00] you have a promise if you raise them in
[2:20:02] the way they go they'll return back to
[2:20:05] it but if you just get in some place
[2:20:08] where there's no standards and it's all
[2:20:10] because Jesus is Love Love's
[2:20:14] corrective love is the truth the truth
[2:20:17] is what set you free
[2:20:21] and you just can't you can't go on and
[2:20:24] think that youve you that and and then
[2:20:27] let alone claim any
[2:20:30] representation to the
[2:20:34] message and don't we all love the
[2:20:36] message isn't that what our another
[2:20:40] Collective goal is the rapture is to try
[2:20:43] to really let this message Shine for
[2:20:45] what that it really is a spirit of love
[2:20:49] a spirit of unity
[2:20:51] a spirit of peace the power in the
[2:20:53] church where every member loves one
[2:20:56] another where a body fitted and joyed
[2:20:59] together every member in particular
[2:21:02] supplying the needs of the
[2:21:07] other all this stuff is starting to slip
[2:21:13] away and it was his
[2:21:16] intention to have a team to have a body
[2:21:20] to have people in one Accord and in one
[2:21:24] Spirit loving and caring one for another
[2:21:28] mindful of one another a collective goal
[2:21:32] self-awareness and
[2:21:34] dependability self-awareness every
[2:21:37] person taking heed to
[2:21:41] themselves that they've got the beam out
[2:21:44] of their eye before they remove the
[2:21:46] sliver aware of their actions aware of
[2:21:49] their time table aware of their
[2:21:53] hygiene ooh hygiene
[2:22:00] time
[2:22:03] shower
[2:22:04] clean
[2:22:06] deodorant not too much
[2:22:11] perfume be
[2:22:14] aware you know and if you got a good
[2:22:18] friend of yours and you're friend in up
[2:22:20] and and you can smell them down on the
[2:22:23] other end of the Pew go to
[2:22:26] them and say hey friend you're a little
[2:22:34] ripe or or or or sister that perfume is
[2:22:40] it smells good but it's so strong
[2:22:43] brother mcgary's eyes are watering
[2:22:51] hey we're all in here
[2:22:55] together you know what I
[2:22:58] mean I mean I could we could go back
[2:23:00] into the law man they washed and did
[2:23:03] everything there was all kinds of rules
[2:23:05] they had to keep things clean do you
[2:23:07] know in the Old Testament if you touched
[2:23:09] a dead body you had to bathe and wash
[2:23:11] you couldn't enter into the it it
[2:23:14] defiled the house of
[2:23:17] God but couldn't we take that into the
[2:23:19] spiritual real and have a
[2:23:23] Revival but there's a
[2:23:26] self-awareness there's a
[2:23:29] Dependable you've got to be able to
[2:23:31] depend on one
[2:23:32] another people got to do what they say
[2:23:36] depend on one
[2:23:38] another you you
[2:23:41] know it breaks my heart when I see
[2:23:44] somebody waiting outside for an
[2:23:47] Uber you know and we should be mindful
[2:23:50] Maybe help one another so all these
[2:23:53] things are
[2:23:54] important dependable and then this you I
[2:23:57] can find I got scriptures down for all
[2:24:01] these a whole list of
[2:24:03] scriptures right there just all kinds of
[2:24:06] scriptures for every single one of these
[2:24:08] and the seventh thing that they say is
[2:24:11] you've got to have impact or result a
[2:24:15] team doesn't want to work on something
[2:24:18] that doesn't produce any
[2:24:21] results you don't want to go to a
[2:24:24] develop something and work on it and
[2:24:26] have meetings and all this and it
[2:24:29] absolutely performs no
[2:24:31] function you ever had one of those Mike
[2:24:35] no it it it's no good for
[2:24:39] nothing nobody wants to be in that
[2:24:43] team what are we what are we
[2:24:46] doing we want to see results right we
[2:24:49] want this
[2:24:51] pool we want people telling people about
[2:24:54] the gospel going to all the world
[2:24:57] preaching the gospel fulfilling the
[2:24:59] commission
[2:25:01] unashamed we want to have impact impact
[2:25:05] is a body that's why I was so pleased
[2:25:07] with Matthew's trip to India it had
[2:25:10] impact it wasn't going from one message
[2:25:13] Church to another message Church to
[2:25:15] another message church and everybody
[2:25:17] sitting back that was a nice sermon that
[2:25:20] was a nice sermon oh I really like the
[2:25:23] way that brother preaches and and
[2:25:25] nothing
[2:25:28] happening but man when you get 26
[2:25:30] Pentecostal preachers amen get baptized
[2:25:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[2:25:37] the front of a whole bunch of other
[2:25:39] preachers that are battling and now
[2:25:42] they're saying we want you back in March
[2:25:44] we want you back in
[2:25:48] March that's why I told I said Matthew
[2:25:51] don't give this
[2:25:54] away God called you to do
[2:25:57] it let them use
[2:26:00] you there's something that they relate
[2:26:05] to you you can't give your circle of
[2:26:08] influence away have you injected the
[2:26:11] light of your life into the influence of
[2:26:14] the circle you're in
[2:26:22] just you know Matthew was in bed the
[2:26:24] other day had a bad back we're praying
[2:26:26] for him but he had a a doctor a surgeon
[2:26:31] and the minute that Matthew testified
[2:26:33] you know I believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:26:34] is going to make me well they cut him
[2:26:40] off good
[2:26:42] luck how many want to go to that
[2:26:46] doctor I like the doctor that prays for
[2:26:49] you
[2:26:51] ahead of
[2:26:52] time but one that believes in the Lord I
[2:26:54] let my doctor he comes out all he wants
[2:26:56] to know is he starts sharing his
[2:26:58] problems with
[2:26:59] me one doctor to the
[2:27:03] other doctor of the body doctor of the
[2:27:06] Soul it works in
[2:27:09] harmony you got to have
[2:27:14] results you're not going to be a part of
[2:27:16] something that's has a result now if we
[2:27:19] and let's go back to personal success
[2:27:22] are you
[2:27:25] having personal
[2:27:28] results in your
[2:27:31] life let's have
[2:27:34] some
[2:27:35] amen amen I I'm sorry I I I was trying
[2:27:40] to be more
[2:27:41] intellectual this morning but I just
[2:27:44] wasn't in me to do it maybe I got
[2:27:47] singleness of sight this morning
[2:27:51] just a few scriptures as we get ready to
[2:27:53] close the musicians can
[2:27:55] come Romans 121 through
[2:27:59] 18 I beseech you therefore Brethren by
[2:28:03] the mercies of God that you present your
[2:28:05] bodies a live in sacrifice holy and
[2:28:08] acceptable unto God which is your
[2:28:12] reasonable
[2:28:14] service
[2:28:16] dependability and be not conformed to
[2:28:19] this world but to be
[2:28:22] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[2:28:25] that you may prove that that is that
[2:28:29] good and
[2:28:31] acceptable and perfect will of
[2:28:35] God for I say though through the grace
[2:28:38] given unto
[2:28:39] me to every man that is among you not to
[2:28:44] think of himself more highly than he
[2:28:47] ought to think but to think so soberly
[2:28:50] according as God hath dealt to every man
[2:28:55] The Measure of Faith for as we have many
[2:28:58] members in one body and all the members
[2:29:03] have not the same office so we being
[2:29:06] many are one body in Christ and every
[2:29:11] one Member One of another having then
[2:29:15] gifts differently according to the grace
[2:29:18] that is given to us
[2:29:20] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[2:29:22] according to the portion of Faith or
[2:29:26] Minister let us wait on our Ministries
[2:29:29] or he that teacheth on teaching or he
[2:29:33] that exhorteth on
[2:29:35] exhortation that giveth let him do it
[2:29:38] with Simplicity he that ruleth with
[2:29:42] diligence he that showeth Mercy with
[2:29:45] cheerfulness let love be without
[2:29:48] dissimulation
[2:29:50] Arbor that which is evil cleave to that
[2:29:54] which is good and we could continue to
[2:29:57] read on from there I just wanted you to
[2:30:00] be aware of the body Ephesians also in
[2:30:04] Ephesians 2 2 and
[2:30:08] 20
[2:30:12] and now therefore ye are no more
[2:30:15] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[2:30:18] citizens with the the Saints and of the
[2:30:22] household of
[2:30:24] God and are built upon the foundation of
[2:30:27] the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[2:30:30] himself being the Chief
[2:30:33] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[2:30:36] fitteth and framed together groweth unto
[2:30:41] an Holy Temple of the Lord in whom ye
[2:30:46] also are built together for the
[2:30:50] inhabitation of the Holy Spirit and
[2:30:54] again also you're real familiar with
[2:30:57] Hebrews 10 and 24 and 25 it says let us
[2:31:04] consider one another to Pro to provoke
[2:31:07] unto love and to Good Works not
[2:31:11] forsaking the Assembly of ourselves
[2:31:13] together as the manner of some is but
[2:31:16] exhort one another so much the more as
[2:31:21] you see the day
[2:31:25] approaching we just wanted you
[2:31:27] to be
[2:31:30] aware and as I gave my heart to
[2:31:34] you I really believe that God's
[2:31:41] Desiring us to grow as
[2:31:43] individuals and us to unite and care one
[2:31:47] for another as a body
[2:31:51] and each in your own
[2:31:53] heart I know we're a very
[2:31:57] diverse congregation with different
[2:32:01] languages different
[2:32:07] backgrounds different Customs different
[2:32:10] tastes
[2:32:11] all sort of
[2:32:14] differences but what we have in common
[2:32:17] is greater than our differences for he
[2:32:21] that is in you is greater than he who is
[2:32:25] in the
[2:32:27] World by one Spirit you are all baptized
[2:32:32] into one body One Faith and one Lord One
[2:32:37] Faith one baptism one Lord of us all the
[2:32:42] word of God so don't count yourself
[2:32:48] little count count yourself
[2:32:51] great don't count yourself
[2:32:54] unneeded we can't make it without you
[2:32:58] every single person in here this morning
[2:33:02] is what makes it
[2:33:04] work and we never want to be so big that
[2:33:08] people can come and go
[2:33:13] unnoticed let the Lord speak to your
[2:33:16] heart concerning one another Reach Out
[2:33:19] Lord one another love one another the
[2:33:22] scripture we just read said let us care
[2:33:24] one for another let us provoke one
[2:33:27] another under good
[2:33:30] works let us
[2:33:33] be a Shining
[2:33:37] Light a real
[2:33:39] body of
[2:33:42] Believers all of us dedicated to this
[2:33:46] message and I'll try to do better myself
[2:33:48] I'm the worst of
[2:33:50] all but sometimes when I preach it
[2:33:53] myself it helps me so I know you didn't
[2:33:56] need this this morning but I
[2:33:59] did and I can't preach to you without
[2:34:02] preaching to me so I love
[2:34:05] you I hope that you you understand
[2:34:09] that it's really
