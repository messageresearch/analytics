[31:21] you have your bibles
[31:23] i want to invite you to turn in the
[31:24] scripture to mark
[31:26] chapter 10. we're going to be reading
[31:31] familiar passage of scripture verse 13.
[31:35] it's an encounter with our lord and
[31:41] and the rich young ruler and
[31:44] just we had a brother's breakfast and
[31:48] you know i just thank god for spiritual
[31:50] food in due season
[31:52] amen what would we be if we didn't have
[31:55] a guide i mean what would he be
[31:59] we would have no vision if we didn't
[32:01] have something that's been presented us
[32:03] that we can walk into amen
[32:11] scripture says there in mark chapter 10
[32:14] verse 13 it says and they brought young
[32:17] children to him
[32:20] that he should touch them and his
[32:22] disciples rebuked those
[32:24] that brought them but when jesus saw it
[32:28] he was much displeased and he said unto
[32:30] them suffer the little ones to come unto
[32:33] me
[32:34] and forbid them not for of such
[32:37] is the kingdom of god verily i say unto
[32:40] you
[32:41] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[32:43] of god
[32:44] as a little child he shall not enter
[32:47] therein
[32:49] and he took up he took them up in his
[32:52] arms
[32:53] and he put his hands upon them and
[32:54] blessed them
[32:56] and when he was gone forth into the way
[32:58] he came
[33:00] and there came one running and kneeled
[33:02] down and asked him
[33:03] good master what shall i do that i might
[33:06] inherit eternal life
[33:07] and jesus said unto him why calleth thou
[33:10] me
[33:11] good there is none good but one that is
[33:14] god
[33:15] thou knowest the commandments do not
[33:17] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[33:21] do not bear false witness defraud not
[33:23] honor thy father
[33:25] and mother and he answered and said unto
[33:27] him master
[33:29] all these have i observed from my youth
[33:32] then jesus beholding him loved him and
[33:35] said unto him
[33:36] one thing thou's lack is go thy way sell
[33:40] whatsoever thou
[33:41] hast and give to the poor and thou shalt
[33:44] has
[33:44] treasures in heaven and come take up thy
[33:48] cross
[33:49] and follow me and he was sad at the same
[33:52] and went away greek for he had great
[33:54] possessions
[33:56] amen you may have your seed we trust the
[33:58] lord will add a blessing to the reading
[33:59] of his word
[34:08] we'll also be reading
[34:11] scripture found in genesis chapter 1
[34:18] and verse 11.
[34:24] and god said let the earth bring forth
[34:28] grass
[34:29] and herb yielding seed and the fruit
[34:32] tree yielding
[34:33] fruit after his kind whose seed is in
[34:37] itself
[34:38] upon the earth and it was so
[34:42] and also if we'll skip over to verse
[34:47] 28 of chapter 1 in genesis it says and
[34:50] god blessed them
[34:51] and god said to them be fruitful
[34:55] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[34:58] subdue it
[34:59] and have dominion over the fish of the
[35:01] sea and over the fowl
[35:03] of the air and over every living thing
[35:07] that moveth upon the earth amen
[35:11] you know i just something that stirred
[35:14] up in my heart i've
[35:16] been considering how the lord's been
[35:19] dealing with me and the messages that's
[35:21] been preached and how
[35:22] you know god's becoming so real and so
[35:25] personal
[35:26] it's it's uh you know this is not a
[35:28] church affair this is an
[35:30] individual affair with jesus christ
[35:32] god's dealing with
[35:33] hearts because he has a reason for doing
[35:36] that
[35:37] he has he has a purpose and an intention
[35:40] of an expression of your life in my life
[35:44] and i think about the story that's
[35:46] spoken of here
[35:47] you know the scripture says that it was
[35:49] given the scriptures are given for our
[35:51] admonition
[35:53] for correction and is also given for
[35:56] vision
[35:57] something that we can walk into
[36:00] and i think about the uh the the
[36:03] question that
[36:06] nicodemus had you know he had kept all
[36:08] the
[36:09] the ten commandments and yet he was
[36:12] presented
[36:14] with an opportunity and i think about
[36:17] you know you can look in the scriptures
[36:19] and you can look at his life
[36:20] and you can just you know cast it aside
[36:23] and say yeah that was for him
[36:25] yeah i don't have the riches that he has
[36:28] but i want us to somehow be able to
[36:31] identify
[36:32] with him in the opportunity
[36:35] so so something that just was bubbling
[36:38] on my heart is you know
[36:40] when we're presented with opportunity
[36:43] what is our attitude
[36:44] attitude attitudes towards the
[36:47] opportunity
[36:50] amen you know sometimes
[36:54] in life you'll be going along and you
[36:56] might face an opportunity that would be
[36:58] your last
[37:02] and we think about what nicodemus was
[37:05] presented with
[37:06] he was presented with an opportunity
[37:09] where
[37:10] something he was longing for something
[37:13] that he desired
[37:14] because his church experience wasn't
[37:17] satisfying enough
[37:18] he said good master there was something
[37:21] about him
[37:22] that was something that he wanted
[37:25] because
[37:26] yet he lacked it
[37:30] and so you see in their exchange
[37:33] you know there was something that
[37:35] withheld him
[37:37] from accepting his opportunity
[37:40] and and what was it what was the
[37:42] question i thought it was a great
[37:43] question
[37:44] what must i do to inherit eternal life
[37:48] the question is is about eternal life
[37:52] amen and now
[37:56] think about him he's coming what must i
[37:59] do
[38:00] you see he's expressing human nature and
[38:02] a religious human
[38:04] nature so so man's way
[38:07] is always to try to make a way for
[38:10] himself
[38:11] not understanding that god has a
[38:12] provided way
[38:15] he said what must i do to inherit
[38:18] eternal life
[38:19] and yet the very thing that was keeping
[38:22] him
[38:22] from his opportunity at eternal life he
[38:25] went away grieved
[38:28] because he had much possession we might
[38:30] not have riches
[38:32] but we might have other things that are
[38:34] trying to hinder us
[38:35] from expressing eternal life amen just
[38:39] as i was
[38:40] considering the the message leadership
[38:42] and and
[38:43] fellowshipping in the brothers breakfast
[38:46] you know i don't i don't do
[38:47] pitchfork gospel i said god
[38:51] what what is it in me that's keeping
[38:54] eternal life from being expressed in me
[38:58] amen ponder that there's things that are
[39:01] presented in our lives
[39:03] situations you know
[39:06] and and we have a a a seven course meal
[39:10] god has stored up spiritual food see
[39:14] nicodemus he had it right in one way
[39:17] because jesus christ today he's on the
[39:21] outside of the church
[39:22] trying to gain entrance back into the
[39:24] church
[39:25] he says i'm standing at the door
[39:29] knocking see that very knock is your
[39:32] opportunity
[39:34] what is the situation that you need
[39:36] eternal life in
[39:37] tonight what what is the situation well
[39:40] i need a revelation of my
[39:42] healing i need a revelation that jehovah
[39:45] jireh is still my provider
[39:47] amen what is your need
[39:51] that's the opportunity we want to grasp
[39:54] that's the very thing that we're longing
[39:56] for we're saying god
[39:57] i need this eternal life to be
[40:00] manifested
[40:01] in my life amen
[40:04] something that that was ringing in my
[40:06] heart and
[40:08] you know i just think about you know
[40:11] we are in a time we've come
[40:14] to a precious time where all the
[40:16] mysteries of god has been revealed
[40:19] amen we have at our disposal
[40:23] we have access to the very
[40:26] thoughts of god to know
[40:30] his will and how to perform it
[40:34] but dying is hard nicodemus he showed he
[40:39] couldn't do it
[40:40] he was holding to something that he
[40:41] couldn't let go of
[40:45] i think about the prophet saying
[40:50] a statement and it just
[40:55] i'll read it to you and
[41:01] this was spoken uh the spoken word is
[41:04] the original seed
[41:06] now he said if you can't
[41:10] you now if you can't explain it leave it
[41:13] alone
[41:14] but just say it so because god said so
[41:17] see
[41:18] that's it god said it now notice
[41:22] now it will not mix you must not
[41:26] tamper with it god will punish the one
[41:28] that does it
[41:30] and it will not hybrid to nothing else
[41:33] it's god's word alone god don't need
[41:36] the need your word and his we're
[41:40] supposed to speak his own word
[41:42] we're supposed to preach his word god's
[41:44] word
[41:45] now therefore true life can only come
[41:49] or reproduce itself by its original
[41:51] breeding
[41:52] see life now
[41:55] study that now i want you to study that
[41:59] on tapes
[42:01] now study it now life l-i-f-e
[42:05] can only come can only reproduce by
[42:09] its original breeding amen so
[42:14] we know we have the seed of god in us
[42:18] we know that the washing of the water
[42:22] by the word will water the seed
[42:25] so so if we have within our ability
[42:29] to go in and water the seed by feeding
[42:32] on the word
[42:33] amen and laying in the presence of the
[42:35] sun we can get all the mechanics right
[42:38] but we got to wait on the dynamics
[42:43] but in waiting we also want to know
[42:46] he said the way it started at the
[42:49] beginning
[42:50] then it reproduced itself see it doesn't
[42:52] it's
[42:53] it's a hybrid it runs out some of them
[42:56] run out
[42:57] the first generation it's gone right
[42:59] then
[43:00] it'll soon find itself back it can't
[43:03] bring correct life it's hybrid
[43:08] now he said let's coast
[43:12] let's try to hold now such a text i
[43:14] could preach he says i'm trying to
[43:16] now i'm trying to keep from doing it so
[43:19] he's trying to keep from preaching on it
[43:20] but he's talking about
[43:21] how that it's easy to try to mix the
[43:24] word of god with your own thinking
[43:27] it's so easy but he says now now he said
[43:30] like eve
[43:31] now thinking about the opportunity
[43:33] that's presented itself today
[43:36] he says now eve was presented or she
[43:40] brought forth a hybrid crop that wasn't
[43:43] god's purpose
[43:45] just have a hold back
[43:48] he says now talking about the hybrid
[43:51] crop he said that's a dead crop
[43:53] so it can't rebreed itself it won't
[43:55] rebreed itself
[43:57] because god said so he said now let
[43:59] every seed bring forth of its own kind
[44:01] you won't
[44:02] you're you've mixed it and then you can
[44:05] see the church right there
[44:07] and where they're going to wind up it's
[44:09] dead
[44:10] for it cannot bring forth of its kind
[44:12] why they mixed
[44:14] you can't do it nothing with it it's
[44:17] dead it's finished
[44:18] and that's why every generation has its
[44:21] own revival
[44:22] a chance at the word amen
[44:26] you know that's that's the answer that's
[44:28] the source of my
[44:29] inspiration you know if if you have
[44:33] a restored word now you have an
[44:36] opportunity presented to you because you
[44:39] have the seed of god
[44:40] in you the seed of god was put in you
[44:44] not to say look at me i have eternal
[44:46] life but it's to reproduce of its own
[44:49] kind
[44:49] amen it's it's the very same life
[44:52] of jesus christ this
[44:55] this gospel is not just to come and show
[44:58] up at church
[44:59] and show our good clothes and put our
[45:02] best foot forward
[45:03] but this gospel is a gospel that's
[45:05] rugged that's
[45:06] that's down home cooking it kicks out
[45:09] the trash
[45:10] you know it puts the tv out when the
[45:12] prophet says it's time to put the tv out
[45:15] when it says you can't walk that walk
[45:17] with those high heels it kicks those
[45:19] shoes out and
[45:20] cans them all those attitudes and such
[45:27] i accept it that's my inheritance
[45:31] the seed that's in me is is calling out
[45:35] for that kind of
[45:36] expression there's nothing else in the
[45:39] world that will satisfy
[45:40] the hunger that's in that seed
[45:47] that's why each generation has its own
[45:50] revival
[45:51] a chance at the word think of it your
[45:54] opportunity your chance
[45:56] at the word to declare eternal life
[46:02] think about the life of christ you can
[46:05] look back and see what he's done
[46:07] and look forward to what he will do
[46:10] and you can see what he's doing right
[46:11] now he's cleaning out your life
[46:15] he's i mean he's putting a boot to all
[46:18] that trash
[46:19] and you're saying i'm willing lord
[46:24] you see nicodemus said what must i do
[46:27] you see and now when he knocks
[46:31] see i love the the testimony and i was
[46:34] thinking about it this week
[46:36] how that you know there was a great
[46:38] painting
[46:39] of of the door that jesus was knocking
[46:42] on
[46:44] and they had criticized him and said
[46:45] well you know
[46:47] the the door is missing the latch
[46:50] and he said well that was on purpose
[46:53] because the latch is on the inside
[46:57] god put a man on freemore agency he's a
[46:59] perfect gentleman he's not going to go
[47:01] across your will
[47:03] but there's a people that have the same
[47:05] seed
[47:06] that's going to allow god to fulfill his
[47:09] word
[47:10] as it was spoken let it be
[47:13] amen there is a virgin womb that that
[47:16] seed is coming forth
[47:18] and gonna reproduce itself amen
[47:22] this gospel is being declared
[47:26] in human flesh now
[47:30] thinking about accepting our opportunity
[47:34] we want to accept our own opportunity to
[47:37] manifest
[47:38] that incorruptible seed i love how
[47:41] brother billy brought out how that
[47:42] there's a there's a natural kingdom
[47:44] and a heavenly kingdom and we're living
[47:47] within these two realms
[47:49] we have the opportunity to express
[47:52] natural
[47:53] carnal worldly expressions you have that
[47:56] opportunity
[47:57] and and many of those things are lawful
[48:01] but yet there's a people that's saying
[48:03] there's something in my heart that's
[48:05] calling for the
[48:06] expediency of christ this kind of
[48:10] leadership
[48:11] that leads me and guides me into all
[48:14] truth
[48:15] and righteousness i don't want just a
[48:18] little bit
[48:19] i want it all
[48:28] you have your opportunity
[48:31] at a revival your own revival
[48:34] your chance at the word i think about
[48:37] the testimonies
[48:39] how god is moving i mean i can go
[48:43] through them all but
[48:44] you see when that opportunity had
[48:46] presented
[48:48] itself i had been hearing for a long
[48:51] time
[48:52] that god is the same and i've heard
[48:54] testimonies in the church and on tape
[48:56] and i've heard that god is the same and
[48:59] and matter of fact
[49:01] i'm a part of that you know what and and
[49:04] i got a need
[49:06] and we've heard sisters stand here and
[49:09] testify
[49:10] in that moment it produced
[49:14] amen when faith to receive what's yours
[49:18] drops in your heart grab it don't wait
[49:21] another moment
[49:25] that's your possession the moment it's
[49:27] revealed to you
[49:29] this is my daughter i claim her for the
[49:32] glory of god
[49:36] you got a lost loved one you got
[49:39] somebody you've been praying for a sick
[49:42] mom
[49:44] you need a job this is our opportunity
[49:48] amen we want to accept the opportunity
[49:52] to watch our faith shine out
[50:00] praise the lord amen
[50:07] the seed is given for reproduction
[50:12] the seed is a word the word is a seed
[50:15] that a sower sowed
[50:17] and now we've come to a place where that
[50:19] seed word
[50:21] is taking on skin
[50:24] amen says now remember correctly
[50:27] that's why each generation has
[50:31] his chance his own revival gets a chance
[50:34] at the word
[50:35] then they hybrid instead of taking it
[50:37] and that's the way they do
[50:38] now brother brown says this he says my
[50:40] mission that i believe
[50:42] that god has called me for now i have to
[50:45] say some personal things today because
[50:47] that's what i told you i would do is to
[50:49] tell the world
[50:50] my mission i believe in the earth is to
[50:53] forerun that coming word see
[50:56] the coming word which is christ amen now
[50:59] that seed word see it wasn't until the
[51:03] restoration came
[51:04] that we can manifest what was in the in
[51:07] the seed
[51:08] amen because the the word that was there
[51:11] was hybrid
[51:15] god has to restore the altar and bring
[51:18] back the
[51:18] the seals to let us see the trail of the
[51:21] serpent
[51:22] to see all the deception and the
[51:24] hybriding of the word
[51:27] and now when the revival comes amen you
[51:30] know
[51:30] we're going through some hard tests
[51:32] we're going through some hard trials
[51:34] there's some things that we're going
[51:36] through that you know you figure
[51:38] how's this body be being kept
[51:42] well the word of god says that there is
[51:44] an inherent
[51:46] inheritance kept by the power of god
[51:49] amen that's your revival there's an
[51:52] inheritance
[51:53] that is kept by god and it's reserved
[51:56] for you in heaven
[51:58] well i just think about if if i was
[52:00] making reservations
[52:02] you know for for a trip or for a meal
[52:06] boy i would start preparing to receive
[52:09] some benefits from that reservation
[52:15] amen we have the opportunity to claim
[52:19] everything that eternal life provides
[52:23] oh what an opportunity what an
[52:26] opportunity
[52:26] what a privileged people we are and to
[52:29] think that god
[52:31] sent his word he vindicated it
[52:35] by i mean this is just so plain and now
[52:39] what are we looking for well
[52:42] we're looking for god to fulfill his
[52:44] word
[52:49] you know whenever god fulfills his word
[52:50] it brings the glory and presence of god
[52:53] amen you're a people that are privileged
[52:56] to live and walk
[52:57] where the glory and presence of god goes
[53:02] thank god he said he sent his mercies
[53:04] new every morning
[53:06] amen you know you can look back at
[53:08] yesterday
[53:09] and that old devil tried to drum up a
[53:12] song that tries to bring you
[53:14] down but i got another opportunity
[53:18] praise god his mercies are new every
[53:21] morning
[53:23] praise the lord scripture says in first
[53:27] peter
[53:28] chapter 2 he says but you are a chosen
[53:32] generation
[53:33] a royal priesthood a holy nation
[53:36] peculiar people that ye should show
[53:39] forth the praises of him that have
[53:42] called you
[53:43] out of darkness into his marvelous light
[53:46] which in times past you were not a
[53:48] people
[53:50] but now the people of god
[53:53] which had not obtained mercy but now
[53:57] have attained mercy praise god
[54:00] you know i'm not what i used to be
[54:04] i'm not what i want to be but i'm
[54:07] definitely not
[54:08] where i want to be and and you know it's
[54:11] it's one of those things that if i have
[54:13] god's grace and mercy
[54:14] and i'm in his hands he'll finish his
[54:17] work
[54:18] amen you know what is the revival given
[54:23] for
[54:24] now we know we're promised that god's
[54:26] going to send his revival
[54:28] amen now you know the revival
[54:33] is to to clear out the trash you know
[54:37] and and i'll just say it plainly and
[54:39] i'll just testify
[54:40] many times you know the revival is to
[54:44] give you victory over your fleshly
[54:45] carnal lust
[54:47] i mean god's given you victory over this
[54:50] bag of bones
[54:52] you see because you're more than that
[54:54] house you're a living soul you're a
[54:56] seed germ seed of god
[55:01] there's got to be a character building
[55:04] that comes
[55:05] with with the power of god
[55:09] you wouldn't just give a child a shotgun
[55:12] or a straight razor or give them the
[55:14] keys to the car and say hey just take
[55:16] off see what happens
[55:17] no sir there's some child training
[55:19] coming
[55:21] we've been in this battle for a while
[55:23] we've learned
[55:24] that we try to go out and perform the
[55:26] word of god we'll fall
[55:28] flat on our face but that's a good place
[55:30] to be
[55:31] because then we can call upon the lord
[55:33] and rise back up and say your mercy is
[55:36] new
[55:36] every morning i'm not gonna be held down
[55:39] by my
[55:40] bad mistakes i'm not gonna be held down
[55:43] by my wrong choices
[55:45] i'm being lifted up into heavenly places
[55:47] because
[55:48] he said that there would be a revival
[55:50] that would revive me
[55:53] that i would wake up and rise like
[55:55] christ amen
[56:00] yeah i was thinking this personal
[56:02] testimony is
[56:04] you know back in 2008 you know seeing
[56:07] the light of the day
[56:08] and god being so kind and merciful and
[56:11] he touched my body healed me of a
[56:15] spinal disease that they said it was
[56:18] permanent and god
[56:19] he touched me my body
[56:23] i had never felt it touched like that
[56:25] before
[56:26] since the time that i had been broken
[56:29] and yet when that touch
[56:30] came i began to understand that i was
[56:34] going to need to accept
[56:37] eternal life like i had never accepted
[56:39] before
[56:40] because well that said in me something
[56:43] that touched a deep a hunger a craving
[56:46] to see
[56:47] more of the supernatural
[56:50] and so as we went out we went to mexico
[56:52] we had some special meetings
[56:54] brother david brother junior preached
[56:56] and it was
[56:57] powerful man i was hearing
[57:00] i had been feeding on the word of god
[57:02] hearing testimony that god's the same
[57:04] god he raises the dead he
[57:06] heals the sick he opens blind eyes he
[57:09] saves the lost
[57:10] oh my i was going through a revival amen
[57:14] and then i come home and whoo
[57:17] i was sick the day before we left and
[57:19] the travel was
[57:21] tough and well you know this
[57:25] to my shame but this is just where we're
[57:27] at we were a people like the scripture
[57:29] says
[57:31] he called you out of darkness into his
[57:35] marvelous light
[57:36] and i had been hearing and faith cometh
[57:38] by hearing and i had been hearing
[57:40] about a living god one that sets
[57:43] the captive free and i already
[57:45] experienced him in salvation i
[57:47] experienced him healing
[57:49] but yet god now he said he was gonna
[57:51] revive me
[57:53] and so i'm sitting there and i'm
[57:55] catching up on my cowboy game
[57:58] i had a dvr and i was sitting there
[58:01] and you know what i get a knock at the
[58:06] door
[58:08] henny grab the door got something
[58:11] important going on
[58:12] ain't got time we're just being honest
[58:15] folks
[58:18] the door came my wife said hey
[58:21] they need to talk to you and i realize
[58:24] at that moment
[58:26] something was very wrong but god
[58:29] all of a sudden a situation
[58:32] a circumstance god had a seed
[58:36] that was requiring a revival
[58:39] god had a seed that had to come to a
[58:42] manifestation and expression
[58:45] so god he performed his word
[58:48] that boy he made a bad choice he ended
[58:51] up hanging himself
[58:52] but i had heard while we were in mexico
[58:55] some brothers laid
[58:56] hands on somebody that had died
[58:59] and that person when they died was 10
[59:01] years old now
[59:02] 17. and my eyes were beholding
[59:05] fulfillment
[59:07] i had heard on the tape and something
[59:09] happened in my heart when i
[59:11] seen i said that girl right there was
[59:14] raised from the dead by prayer
[59:17] praise god praise god
[59:20] i had only heard by the hearing but now
[59:23] i see
[59:26] there was something in my heart that
[59:28] accepted
[59:30] the opportunity even though i didn't
[59:32] know it was going to present itself
[59:34] within a few days even in my
[59:37] darkness you might have some darkness
[59:41] you're experiencing today
[59:43] you might have some things that you know
[59:46] trying to hold you back
[59:48] from accepting what god has for a
[59:51] faith to become what you've been called
[59:54] to
[59:56] there is something longing inside you've
[59:59] searched
[1:00:00] you've tried nothing has been able to
[1:00:03] quench that hunger
[1:00:09] yet i went out there
[1:00:12] offered a word of prayer and god
[1:00:17] came on the scene for a young man and
[1:00:20] that boy
[1:00:20] he lived and i seen the hand of god in
[1:00:24] such a way
[1:00:26] that something in me said enough with
[1:00:28] this foolishness
[1:00:30] i kicked the tv out amen
[1:00:33] god sending a revival because he's
[1:00:36] faithful
[1:00:37] to perform his good word amen you can
[1:00:39] think about your life and circumstances
[1:00:42] and situations you're dealing with it's
[1:00:44] an opportunity for
[1:00:46] god to come on the scene and for faith
[1:00:48] to rise up
[1:00:50] and claim your god-given right amen
[1:00:53] you will come here to express a son and
[1:00:56] daughter of god
[1:00:59] the same way that he did took god at his
[1:01:03] word
[1:01:04] declared the truth and watched the
[1:01:07] spirit of god come down
[1:01:08] amen and it become righteousness it
[1:01:12] become
[1:01:12] his life living out in a yielded vessel
[1:01:17] amen amen in that wonderful
[1:01:25] a little further down in in first peter
[1:01:28] in chapter 2 and 12 it says having your
[1:01:30] conversation
[1:01:31] honest among the gentiles that whereas
[1:01:34] they speak against you
[1:01:35] evildoers they may be
[1:01:39] that they may by your good works
[1:01:43] which they shall behold glorify god
[1:01:47] in the day of visitation amen you know
[1:01:50] there's people
[1:01:51] that you know we received our visitation
[1:01:54] we it's been made known to us
[1:01:58] the full manifestation of malachi 4.
[1:02:02] we've seen the hand of god now there's
[1:02:06] going to be people
[1:02:08] that they like the scripture says
[1:02:11] they may behold your good works
[1:02:14] and then they'll shall behold and
[1:02:17] glorify god in the day of their
[1:02:18] visitation

[1:02:22] of god
[1:02:25] i'm encouraging you i want faith to rise
[1:02:28] what i'm speaking to you i've
[1:02:30] experienced and i want it more
[1:02:35] and you know what rejoices my heart
[1:02:38] is that god do it for you and i know he
[1:02:41] has
[1:02:41] i've seen it i've seen
[1:02:45] mothers burdened
[1:02:48] for their children i've seen brothers
[1:02:51] burdened for their moms and you know
[1:02:55] what they packed that burden
[1:02:57] as an opportunity to see the hand of
[1:03:01] god fulfill his good word
[1:03:05] amen hold to the promise
[1:03:11] it's a seed it'll bring forth
[1:03:14] in its time
[1:03:20] everybody feeling okay praise the lord
[1:03:25] you know we just think about
[1:03:29] so many things that we could testify of
[1:03:31] but
[1:03:32] you know
[1:03:37] over in romans chapter 2 there is a
[1:03:41] an account you know when you receive
[1:03:44] christ and you receive calvary
[1:03:48] and you receive what was done on that
[1:03:50] day
[1:03:51] something in the heart begins to think
[1:03:54] differently
[1:03:57] something begins to act differently your
[1:04:00] judgments
[1:04:01] change before the moment someone crossed
[1:04:05] you
[1:04:06] you would be oh i can't i can't stand a
[1:04:09] second without
[1:04:10] a retaliation but when you
[1:04:14] know where you come from
[1:04:17] and you know where you're going boy it
[1:04:20] just makes it a little bit easier
[1:04:22] to keep your mouth sealed
[1:04:26] and keep your fist in your pocket
[1:04:31] so it's that very life of christ
[1:04:35] now becoming that restrainer
[1:04:40] and we want more of that
[1:04:44] in romans it says now
[1:04:52] we'll just skip right there in between
[1:04:54] um
[1:04:55] it says despise thou the riches of his
[1:04:58] goodness
[1:04:59] and forbearance and longsuffering
[1:05:04] knowing not knowing that the goodness of
[1:05:07] god leadeth
[1:05:08] thee to repentance you know i i
[1:05:11] that that has just become such a reality
[1:05:16] you know i wasn't seeking god
[1:05:22] you think about the different
[1:05:26] places where you stumble twisted your
[1:05:29] ankle
[1:05:31] yeah you should have been doing other
[1:05:35] things and the lord give you opportunity
[1:05:37] to say you know what
[1:05:38] that's not the call of a son or daughter
[1:05:40] of god
[1:05:41] and in his mercy then the next day oh
[1:05:44] you know what that ankle doesn't feel so
[1:05:45] bad
[1:05:46] you know and you think about
[1:05:50] you know it's it's opportunity like i
[1:05:52] was saying i was sitting there doing
[1:05:54] the dvr thing but it was the goodness of
[1:05:56] god he didn't come and condemn me
[1:05:59] god's not condemning you for the
[1:06:01] condition you're at he's calling you up
[1:06:03] higher
[1:06:06] saying i have some things for you
[1:06:10] and that's why i want you to come
[1:06:22] despise thou the riches of his goodness
[1:06:25] forbearance and long-suffering you see
[1:06:28] when you've experienced his forbearance
[1:06:32] when you received and experienced his
[1:06:34] long-suffering
[1:06:37] and his goodness now you
[1:06:40] become a partaker of it it's also now
[1:06:43] that's christ in you doing it for those
[1:06:46] who did the same thing like you did to
[1:06:48] god
[1:06:50] and people need to see an expression of
[1:06:52] faith
[1:06:55] they need to see the life that is in you
[1:06:57] germinated
[1:06:59] and lived out that's what causes the
[1:07:02] attraction
[1:07:04] is this very end time message
[1:07:07] manifest in human beings
[1:07:11] it's the very gospel being preached amen
[1:07:14] it's foolishness to the world
[1:07:16] oh you don't wear makeup uh
[1:07:19] why don't you go out to the parties why
[1:07:21] aren't you coming to us with the
[1:07:23] to the football game
[1:07:26] well i got a different appetite
[1:07:30] god changed me amen he's declared his
[1:07:34] goodness to me
[1:07:36] and i want to share something with you
[1:07:38] god is a merciful god
[1:07:41] he's long suffering he's forbearing
[1:07:46] and his his goodness led my heart to
[1:07:50] repentance
[1:07:51] you see while i was yet a sinner
[1:07:54] he died for me let me tell you about a
[1:07:57] love
[1:07:59] that knows no bound amen
[1:08:03] and he's dwelling in you to perform his
[1:08:05] good word
[1:08:06] towards those that you love
[1:08:10] amen like the brother said let me be the
[1:08:12] clay
[1:08:13] on his will that he might perform his
[1:08:16] manifest his goodness
[1:08:20] you know i was fellowshipping you know
[1:08:23] with the brother and
[1:08:26] it just struck my heart you know
[1:08:28] opportunities of fulfillment
[1:08:31] opportunities of manifestation
[1:08:35] of god's word
[1:08:39] you know i think about the situation
[1:08:42] that brother branham found himself in
[1:08:44] and
[1:08:47] there's a message called the path of
[1:08:48] life and
[1:08:50] you know this brother he was um
[1:08:53] criticizing brother branham
[1:08:55] you know about divine healing and things
[1:08:58] and
[1:08:59] and saying that about the witch doctor
[1:09:01] or this you know
[1:09:03] performing a certain something and and
[1:09:05] uh
[1:09:06] you know he just he just he just he
[1:09:09] allowed the criticism i i just maybe
[1:09:11] i'll share it with you in some of the
[1:09:12] details but
[1:09:14] brother brahms said that the the a man
[1:09:16] that had been preaching
[1:09:19] 20 something years and
[1:09:22] he he wrote he wrote him this 22 page
[1:09:25] letter
[1:09:25] you know criticizing him about all this
[1:09:27] and that and the other
[1:09:30] and and brother branham's approach to
[1:09:34] him
[1:09:36] you know this this is what i want to
[1:09:37] anchor down is is how that brother
[1:09:40] branham's approach
[1:09:41] brought a preservative it brought a life
[1:09:44] that attracted this person
[1:09:46] and his spear of influence this man had
[1:09:49] criticized him
[1:09:50] and brother branham even said brother
[1:09:53] dear
[1:09:53] i sure appreciate the many years that
[1:09:56] you spent
[1:09:56] on all of this i appreciated a servant
[1:09:59] of christ
[1:10:00] i do appreciate the criticism now the
[1:10:03] man
[1:10:04] that can't take criticism there's
[1:10:05] something wrong with his experience
[1:10:09] pretty good because
[1:10:13] god sends criticism to correct us
[1:10:16] it makes us see our bad points
[1:10:20] i've been helped so much by criticism
[1:10:22] that's friendly criticism not getting
[1:10:24] nasty or
[1:10:25] angry just friendly criticism so i
[1:10:27] appreciate that sir
[1:10:28] i appreciate it and when he said
[1:10:32] there's just one thing that i i would
[1:10:33] like to express here
[1:10:36] as we're speaking of my grammar of
[1:10:38] course i'm not an educated
[1:10:40] and he said that's true but i said the
[1:10:43] thing
[1:10:44] what surprises me that a dean of a
[1:10:47] lutheran college would
[1:10:49] base his theology upon an experience
[1:10:51] instead of the word of god
[1:10:53] when you talk about the witch that could
[1:10:55] heal
[1:10:56] i said jesus said if satan can cast out
[1:10:59] satan
[1:11:00] then his kingdom is divided he cannot
[1:11:03] heal now you can jesus said that he
[1:11:07] he can't heal and said
[1:11:11] he says let every man's word be a lie
[1:11:14] and mind be true
[1:11:15] amen and jesus said
[1:11:19] now that just surprises me that a dean
[1:11:23] of a lutheran college was based his
[1:11:25] theology upon an experience and an
[1:11:28] emotion instead of god's word
[1:11:30] amen so i i just think about brother
[1:11:32] branham's approach and even
[1:11:34] the very things that that hindered
[1:11:36] people will come in contact with
[1:11:40] they would accept an experience or an
[1:11:42] emotion
[1:11:43] when eternal life your eternal life
[1:11:46] presented to this world
[1:11:48] and this man was presented with eternal
[1:11:50] life and
[1:11:51] right now there was something that he
[1:11:54] had based
[1:11:55] his destination on something that was
[1:11:58] going to lead him to a godless hell
[1:12:03] and yet there was a preservative there
[1:12:06] was a life on display
[1:12:10] he said now he was just pointing back to
[1:12:13] the word
[1:12:14] satan cast out satan he said let every
[1:12:18] man's word be a lion
[1:12:19] mind be true
[1:12:23] he said a dean
[1:12:26] or someone else any minister should base
[1:12:29] his theology upon the word of god
[1:12:31] and i said i'm certain i know you called
[1:12:34] me a soothsayer
[1:12:35] i said i presumed it was the discernment
[1:12:38] and i said did you know that the
[1:12:41] pharisees and sadducees made their
[1:12:43] remark themselves
[1:12:44] when they seen the same thing done by
[1:12:47] our lord
[1:12:48] they called him beelzebub now perhaps
[1:12:50] what if
[1:12:51] i'm right and jesus said when the holy
[1:12:55] ghost comes to do the same and speak
[1:12:57] against
[1:12:57] it we'll never be forgiven in this world
[1:13:00] or the world to come
[1:13:01] no matter how many 50 years of preaching
[1:13:06] a word against the holy spirit he said
[1:13:10] and i said i forgive you for that
[1:13:13] i will and i know god will for he
[1:13:16] sees that you didn't understand it
[1:13:20] and i wrote him the nicest letter i
[1:13:23] could
[1:13:24] and later i got an invitation to come
[1:13:27] to him amen i just love
[1:13:30] the savor of the life of christ
[1:13:34] it just sets in me an appetite for more
[1:13:37] of god
[1:13:39] there's just a deep hunger for this
[1:13:42] yes i want to manifest this
[1:13:46] and it's been promised you praise god
[1:13:49] you're promised a chance at the word
[1:13:52] glory amen
[1:14:02] you see it just happened to be there
[1:14:05] the devil had put it there at the wrong
[1:14:08] time you know
[1:14:09] when the people are really starting to
[1:14:11] rejoice
[1:14:12] and they got he got an opinion and went
[1:14:16] out
[1:14:16] see and he said i apologize for the
[1:14:20] letter
[1:14:21] that i wrote you said i built myself
[1:14:24] up with such a place that i was against
[1:14:28] it and i was pinned down in it
[1:14:31] right there and said i wasn't
[1:14:35] but a soothsayer he said i ask you to
[1:14:38] forgive me
[1:14:40] he said why certainly sir
[1:14:44] i never holded nothing i never did
[1:14:47] what i told you in the letter he said i
[1:14:50] wanted to hear it from your lips
[1:14:53] this man had seen a representation of
[1:14:56] the seed life
[1:14:58] and he said i wanted to hear it from
[1:15:00] your lips
[1:15:03] there was something in this man that was
[1:15:06] calling for fulfillment
[1:15:07] there's another scripture that says
[1:15:09] whatever you bind
[1:15:11] on earth will be bound whatever you
[1:15:13] loose on earth
[1:15:15] will be loosed is what you have forgiven
[1:15:18] it is forgiven
[1:15:22] he said now i wanted to hear it from
[1:15:24] your lips
[1:15:25] he said now brother branham to me and
[1:15:28] all the students
[1:15:29] we're hungering for the holy ghost
[1:15:33] what must we do he said so
[1:15:37] you know what i told him he said
[1:15:41] don't you he said now turn your backs
[1:15:45] your backs this way and your faces to
[1:15:48] the wall
[1:15:49] all around and make a purpose in your
[1:15:53] heart that you'll never leave your knees
[1:15:55] until you
[1:15:57] god give you the baptism of the holy
[1:15:58] ghost and i said now
[1:16:01] don't think about this or that or the
[1:16:03] other just stay
[1:16:04] there and say god i want the holy ghost
[1:16:07] and he went around and laid hands on
[1:16:09] them and
[1:16:10] 40 received the holy ghost right there
[1:16:14] and now there's about 500 of them strong
[1:16:16] going on
[1:16:17] signs and miracles and wonders and so
[1:16:19] forth
[1:16:20] brother brethren i believe that we have
[1:16:23] the thing that the world must have
[1:16:26] but we've got to approach it in the
[1:16:28] right way
[1:16:29] amen you have the ability within the
[1:16:32] seed
[1:16:32] to approach it the right way we have to
[1:16:36] accept this divine leadership
[1:16:39] this unction from above this wisdom
[1:16:43] this understanding it's available
[1:16:48] i'm accepting my opportunity
[1:16:52] think about that approach you know
[1:16:54] testifying
[1:16:55] witnessing it's out of the same message
[1:16:58] brother brown said if you approached a
[1:17:00] carpenter and you had some kind of
[1:17:03] new mechanism and the the carpenter's
[1:17:05] over there framing
[1:17:06] and slugging on his hammer or his thumb
[1:17:09] and
[1:17:10] ah and here you come you know you you
[1:17:12] got
[1:17:13] you got the advancement you've been
[1:17:15] advanced
[1:17:16] somehow in understanding and you have
[1:17:19] this thing and it
[1:17:20] you put a tag of nails in it and and you
[1:17:23] just look back at him
[1:17:24] he doesn't have nothing in it no i
[1:17:27] offended my brother
[1:17:29] no but there's an approach there's a
[1:17:32] provided way
[1:17:34] the life of christ reviving you let's
[1:17:36] get the trash out first
[1:17:50] praise the lord i don't know where i'm
[1:17:52] at
[1:17:54] in time um you know another experience
[1:17:58] where the opportunity was presented
[1:18:02] amen and i believe that we can live so
[1:18:05] close to god that god can warn us
[1:18:07] of a test that's coming where an enemy
[1:18:10] would try to lay a snare
[1:18:12] through a neighbor or through a
[1:18:13] co-worker but
[1:18:15] through meekness and humility receive a
[1:18:18] word from the lord
[1:18:20] and walk quietly and meek me before our
[1:18:22] brother even to be suffered to be
[1:18:24] defrauded
[1:18:26] because god will avenge his elect
[1:18:32] there there is a message called the
[1:18:34] reproach for the cause
[1:18:35] of the word brother branham said this he
[1:18:37] said in verse 7 he said god has a time
[1:18:41] and a reason for that time to fulfill
[1:18:45] his words
[1:18:49] god knows just exactly what he is doing
[1:18:52] we don't we just have to receive it
[1:18:55] as he gives it to us but he knows that
[1:18:59] there's nothing going to
[1:19:00] go wrong with what he has planned to do
[1:19:05] it's all has to come about and that has
[1:19:08] to be
[1:19:09] sometimes rugged hard things only bring
[1:19:12] out the real and true nature of an
[1:19:15] object
[1:19:16] so as we're facing challenges
[1:19:20] the the different tests that will come
[1:19:23] we know that it'll it's gonna bring out
[1:19:25] the real
[1:19:27] living christ it's an
[1:19:30] opportunity for the real living christ
[1:19:34] to be declared in your flesh
[1:19:48] now brother brown's saying in
[1:19:52] paragraph 81 he says god sets a time and
[1:19:55] has a purpose for everything
[1:19:57] there's nothing that happens
[1:19:59] accidentally to those
[1:20:00] who love the lord and are called
[1:20:03] according to his calling
[1:20:05] we are predestinated and everything
[1:20:07] works just right that's it
[1:20:09] because he cannot lie he said that it
[1:20:12] was
[1:20:12] that everything has its time its season
[1:20:16] it has its way and god is behind
[1:20:19] every move and sometimes you think
[1:20:22] everything's going wrong
[1:20:24] it's up to us those things are put on us
[1:20:27] trials and wonderings it's testings to
[1:20:30] see
[1:20:30] how we'll react on an action
[1:20:33] amen brother branham talks about um
[1:20:37] going into a
[1:20:40] when he went up to hurricane mountain
[1:20:43] in the time where the storm came
[1:20:47] and brother branham talks about how that
[1:20:49] god had
[1:20:50] said something and he said go go to the
[1:20:52] side to yourself
[1:20:54] and he said now get to yourself
[1:20:57] move out in the bushes a little while
[1:20:59] there's a trap set for you
[1:21:00] be careful but he didn't tell me how
[1:21:04] and what okay
[1:21:08] now he he ended up he said i went to the
[1:21:10] church
[1:21:11] that night in the auditorium and
[1:21:13] announced it to the people and the next
[1:21:14] day
[1:21:15] the next night it happened and there i
[1:21:17] was standing there
[1:21:18] when he told me upon some
[1:21:21] markers he said it's in your hands
[1:21:25] do with them whatever you say it'll
[1:21:28] happen
[1:21:29] now now god is giving us example
[1:21:33] how many times have we been given
[1:21:35] opportunities
[1:21:37] to accept the life
[1:21:40] that god is declaring and
[1:21:43] something else had attracted us
[1:21:46] and we missed the opportunity
[1:21:49] but god has a promise
[1:21:53] he's going to revive us to another
[1:21:55] opportunity
[1:21:57] if there's something in your heart
[1:21:58] that's wanting to express this word
[1:22:00] there's some
[1:22:01] opportunity that's going to present
[1:22:03] itself
[1:22:04] to manifest yes
[1:22:11] he says it's in your hands
[1:22:15] do with them whatever you say
[1:22:18] will happen right now there you are
[1:22:21] where
[1:22:22] there was somebody irreverent ungodly in
[1:22:24] making fun of and scoffing at the
[1:22:26] meeting a young man and a young woman
[1:22:29] and he was trying to make vulgar love
[1:22:31] with her in the building and
[1:22:33] everybody's attention while i was trying
[1:22:35] to preach he pulled her head back and
[1:22:37] climb up on her lap and throw
[1:22:39] her head back and try to kiss her and
[1:22:41] going on like that in a meeting drawing
[1:22:43] attention and the holy spirit says
[1:22:45] now they are in your hands
[1:22:48] what will you do with them well
[1:22:54] i tell you we're letting this old shell
[1:22:57] of a man lead wow
[1:23:01] better put the the burn button away
[1:23:07] i mean we need the very love of christ
[1:23:11] you know it's it's you know it's
[1:23:15] you know our faith is based on
[1:23:17] forgiveness
[1:23:19] you know god forgave us while we were
[1:23:21] out groping in darkness
[1:23:23] and sometimes our old flesh just wants
[1:23:25] to be quick
[1:23:31] oh oh did i forget where i come from
[1:23:36] did i did i am i absentee on the grace
[1:23:39] of god
[1:23:40] my my
[1:23:45] it's in your hands you have an
[1:23:47] opportunity
[1:23:49] to let the seed of god
[1:23:52] that's in you manifest
[1:23:57] he said now it's in your hands
[1:24:00] what will you do with them and there was
[1:24:03] a holy hush
[1:24:04] everybody said deathly quiet and i
[1:24:07] thought oh god
[1:24:09] what must i do then i remembered
[1:24:12] if he hadn't have warned of the holy
[1:24:14] spirit two days before
[1:24:16] he said i forgive you
[1:24:20] now that's what he wanted me to say
[1:24:23] he says because after all i had been
[1:24:25] guilty not only of that
[1:24:27] not maybe not of that but guilty of the
[1:24:31] least
[1:24:32] is guilty of the whole i i need this
[1:24:35] kind of faith
[1:24:36] i need this kind of revelation anchored
[1:24:38] in my heart
[1:24:39] i don't want to just have a religious
[1:24:41] experiment experience where i'm
[1:24:44] associated with the message and i got
[1:24:46] all this
[1:24:47] truth and doctrine and things like that
[1:24:49] but i wanted to be a
[1:24:50] living christ taking over me
[1:24:53] taking over my mind my heart my body
[1:24:58] i can long suffer i can forebear wrong
[1:25:03] we had a sheave wave tell us all about
[1:25:05] it not just tell us
[1:25:06] but these are examples just a few
[1:25:09] boys sets a heartbeat in me i mean i'm
[1:25:13] expecting now a revival
[1:25:14] to revive me to a situation i'm going to
[1:25:17] be facing opportunities you might have
[1:25:19] them just as you leave here
[1:25:22] but now i'm going to be looking for
[1:25:24] opportunities of manifestation
[1:25:27] the seed life that is within me can be
[1:25:31] even accused of wrong well if i did it's
[1:25:34] okay i deserve it but if it's for the
[1:25:36] gospel
[1:25:39] the life of christ the glory of god
[1:25:41] manifested
[1:25:42] praise god praise god
[1:25:48] guilty of the least guilty of the whole
[1:25:53] so i said i forgive you and there are
[1:25:55] witnesses sitting here now
[1:25:58] there was then and and then the holy
[1:26:02] spirit fell
[1:26:03] oh i love that part another fulfillment
[1:26:09] praise the lord i mean this is just
[1:26:12] wonderful
[1:26:14] now you see i believe that's all that
[1:26:16] these
[1:26:18] these things had a meaning what would
[1:26:21] you do with a power
[1:26:24] how would you see the reaction
[1:26:27] to an action sometimes
[1:26:31] some things that is come as an act
[1:26:35] then how do you react to that action
[1:26:39] do you understand what i mean what would
[1:26:42] you do
[1:26:44] what would you do and maybe all this has
[1:26:47] worked
[1:26:47] up to where i'm at now
[1:26:52] brother bannon would go on to preach
[1:26:54] about the reproach you know i think
[1:26:56] that's what we're coming to
[1:26:57] is to be able to stand in the face
[1:27:01] in the hall of critics and be accused of
[1:27:04] all manner of things
[1:27:05] and do like he did when they plucked his
[1:27:08] beard out
[1:27:09] when they mocked him spit in his face
[1:27:12] but yet
[1:27:13] there was a meat that he lived off of
[1:27:16] and that was to do the will of god
[1:27:18] amen i believe that same hunger is in
[1:27:21] the seed
[1:27:22] waiting for manifestation a hunger to do
[1:27:25] thy will
[1:27:27] that's the very thing that'll satisfy my
[1:27:30] soul
[1:27:32] the lord it's a matter of
[1:27:36] god's provided way and accepting it
[1:27:39] and then our approach to god and our
[1:27:42] approach to our brother
[1:27:44] amen we just want to be sensitive
[1:27:49] now brother brown says this in 94 he
[1:27:51] says you always have to stand this
[1:27:53] reproach in order to give your testing
[1:27:57] to see every man that comes to christ
[1:28:00] must first be tried
[1:28:01] child trained the purpose
[1:28:05] that god has ordained you for and
[1:28:07] remember
[1:28:09] you can just keep quiet
[1:28:15] you could just keep quiet remember if
[1:28:18] he's called you to this
[1:28:20] there is nothing that can keep it from
[1:28:22] happening
[1:28:24] there's not enough devils in torment but
[1:28:27] what god's word will be made manifest
[1:28:30] you're born for a purpose and nobody can
[1:28:33] take your place
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:39] you might have impersonators and
[1:28:40] everything else
[1:28:42] but they'll never take your place right
[1:28:44] god's word will triumph it cannot fail
[1:28:47] there there is where every christian
[1:28:50] ought to stand
[1:28:51] knowing that that the trials will come
[1:28:54] seem every way to you but remember
[1:28:58] god has a purpose and it'll all work out
[1:29:01] right
[1:29:03] amen now let's just call back a few of
[1:29:06] the events
[1:29:07] god's word had been fulfilled in other
[1:29:10] ages
[1:29:11] and he goes on to speak about noah and
[1:29:13] and the different ones
[1:29:14] and you know you you might be facing
[1:29:16] different things that
[1:29:18] you know you're desiring to see god
[1:29:21] fulfill his word in you
[1:29:22] well just know god promised you a
[1:29:25] revival
[1:29:26] and that seed was given to reproduce
[1:29:29] after his own kind you've seen the life
[1:29:32] displayed
[1:29:33] now take god at his word
[1:29:36] feed the seed bask in the glory and
[1:29:40] presence of god
[1:29:42] when you have a need and you come to a
[1:29:45] place
[1:29:46] where you've done all that you can do
[1:29:48] you've prayed
[1:29:49] you read your bible you've testified
[1:29:53] you've held to the promise when all you
[1:29:56] can do is stand
[1:29:58] you stand wait for god to manifest
[1:30:02] the promise because in that moment of
[1:30:06] waiting
[1:30:07] that unction from above that pulsation
[1:30:11] of faith
[1:30:12] when it grabs you and it quickens
[1:30:16] grab it amen that spur of the moment
[1:30:20] when it's been revealed to you that's
[1:30:23] your opportunity for manifestation
[1:30:26] god bless you let's stand
[1:30:30] i'd like to invite the musicians
[1:30:54] you know you just think about in this
[1:30:56] time in this age
[1:30:57] where the church has put out christ
[1:31:01] from out of the the church and he's
[1:31:04] knocking
[1:31:05] he said now if any man
[1:31:08] hear my voice now he's speaking to
[1:31:11] individuals
[1:31:12] we're not going to get there as a group
[1:31:14] we're going to get there as individuals
[1:31:16] we're going to have opportunities that
[1:31:18] present themselves
[1:31:20] as individuals and it's
[1:31:23] opportunities that that seed life
[1:31:26] that you can sup with him he said
[1:31:30] now if i'm knocking any man open i will
[1:31:33] come into him
[1:31:34] and i will sup with him and he with me
[1:31:37] the very
[1:31:38] cry of the heart is i don't only want to
[1:31:41] experience his presence but i want his
[1:31:43] experi
[1:31:44] his presence to be experienced by others
[1:31:47] amen that is the longing of the seed
[1:31:51] is to declare eternal life and eternal
[1:31:54] life is perfectly living for others
[1:31:57] if there's something that's holding you
[1:31:59] back tonight if there's
[1:32:01] something that comes to mind or in your
[1:32:03] heart
[1:32:04] like nicodemus he realized he couldn't
[1:32:07] give it up he went a great
[1:32:08] grieved but i believe tonight there will
[1:32:11] be something
[1:32:12] in your heart that you can go rejoicing
[1:32:14] because you've accepted your opportunity
[1:32:19] amen why don't we bow our hearts

[1:42:49] tonight
[1:42:50] amen i believe every day every moment of
[1:42:53] our life is an opportunity
[1:42:55] man for that supernatural to be
[1:42:57] manifested
[1:42:59] amen for for the word he said every
[1:43:01] every generation has to change to that
[1:43:04] revival
[1:43:05] for that word to come into play you know
[1:43:08] and i was thinking as our brother was
[1:43:10] preaching
[1:43:11] you know every time we we think about
[1:43:13] the even the manifestations of sons and
[1:43:17] and things like that our mind oftentimes
[1:43:19] jumps to
[1:43:20] even though the the the manifestation of
[1:43:23] the third
[1:43:24] pole and things like that what would it
[1:43:27] help for someone to create scroll into
[1:43:29] existence
[1:43:30] but to lack the love of god for one
[1:43:32] another what would it help for you to
[1:43:35] stop the storm
[1:43:36] and not have compassion for one another
[1:43:38] or to manifest the kindness and the
[1:43:41] fruits of the spirit like alberta said
[1:43:43] i believe we live in such a time where
[1:43:45] when we get these things done
[1:43:47] then god will expand our field he wants
[1:43:49] us to be a
[1:43:51] good and he wants us to be good
[1:43:53] stewardship in the little things and
[1:43:55] to pay attention and to to wait for that
[1:43:58] opportunity to open up for us to move
