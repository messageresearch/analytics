[32:59] there
[33:01] [Music]
[33:05] is no one
[33:08] [Music]
[33:16] um uh quick testimony um
[33:20] back in nigeria you know it's easy to
[33:24] speak about the
[33:25] message of the howard to people because
[33:27] i don't
[33:28] i wouldn't be worried about being fired
[33:30] at work or talking about what i believe
[33:33] but coming to the states is a little
[33:34] different when your job will tell you
[33:36] you know you don't speak about religion
[33:38] or what now you don't i mean that's one
[33:40] of the things that would give you in the
[33:41] handbook and whatnot like you got to be
[33:43] careful
[33:44] you know to speak on what it is that you
[33:46] believe because some people might just
[33:47] take offense and whatnot
[33:50] and so you know it's something that
[33:52] usually brought in my mind because i
[33:53] like to speak about it i like to talk
[33:55] about it i like to say things you know
[33:57] like our women don't put on pants and it
[34:00] sounds weird to to them like what do you
[34:02] say we don't women don't put on things
[34:04] that pertain to a man and things like
[34:06] that just talk about some you know the
[34:09] core beliefs that we we have that stands
[34:11] out from them so they it attracts them
[34:13] they want to hear more
[34:15] but but you know at my place of work you
[34:17] know i've just been going in this you
[34:18] know and it's been disturbing me that
[34:21] you know
[34:22] how am i living my life have they seen
[34:24] something that looks a little different
[34:26] and would want to ask the question
[34:28] but i've been struggling with that
[34:29] because nobody asked me the question i
[34:31] just look like i'm the same with them so
[34:33] okay
[34:34] and i was like okay i think that's just
[34:36] number on friday they would sit down and
[34:38] they say happy hour they want to they
[34:40] want to drink they they have it stuck in
[34:42] the fridge they just want to have a good
[34:44] time and so you know i'll show up there
[34:45] and i'll just say
[34:47] water might seem you know feel a little
[34:49] good if you guys drink water and i step
[34:50] out i'll just go home
[34:52] and so all of a sudden um
[34:54] i think on monday i got to work and then
[34:58] my assistant told me and said oh there
[35:00] was a blow up at work i was like what do
[35:02] you mean and he said uh well the hr with
[35:05] some of the person was having a problem
[35:06] about vaccine taking vaccine or not
[35:08] taking vaccine and one of them took the
[35:10] vaccine one of them wouldn't take the
[35:11] vaccine because of religious reason and
[35:14] then there was a scream they were going
[35:15] at each other and screaming
[35:17] and then um i think she sat down and now
[35:20] asked if all the people and say what is
[35:22] it about mark david what is just
[35:24] different
[35:24] don't you guys notice something
[35:26] different about that dude that guy
[35:28] is he is he muslim is he what what is
[35:30] something special about him
[35:33] and my coach my colleague said well we
[35:35] think he's a christian he you know when
[35:37] we sit down here and drink on friday he
[35:39] doesn't drink with us you know you have
[35:40] he comes and you know talk to us and
[35:42] just leave um and so she personally came
[35:45] to my office and i'm talking about the
[35:47] hr person and walked in my office and
[35:49] said i just want to ask you a question i
[35:51] hope it's it's not going to be weird
[35:53] why what is different about you what do
[35:55] you believe
[35:56] you know i have a religion that i
[35:59] believe i don't want to take the vaccine
[36:00] but people are just looking at me like
[36:02] i'm weird and so we sat down for almost
[36:05] an hour
[36:07] just talking about the message
[36:09] just talking about the message to her
[36:10] and she just look she said i've been
[36:12] going around looking for something that
[36:14] can satisfy my soul
[36:16] me and my family and my husband and you

[36:20] you were telling me something that i
[36:22] haven't heard before just even going

[36:32] two minutes
[36:33] i was there almost 30 minutes after that
[36:35] two minutes just talking to her
[36:38] and so i i was very happy and i said you
[36:41] know for someone to just call out and
[36:42] say what is different i want to know
[36:44] something about i want to know what he
[36:45] knows
[36:46] what is different about him and it
[36:48] wasn't like anything was distinct about
[36:50] me at work um and so but just to see

[52:20] church
[52:22] something kind of just started rising up
[52:25] in my heart
[52:29] and there's a story that brother branham
[52:31] tells that came to my heart
[52:35] [Music]
[52:37] but i'm

[52:40] ship captain pondokin la vigue as he was
[52:43] navigating the capitol
[53:00] someone who could read something in the
[53:01] bible for him
[53:05] hey there's this young child that came

[53:56] who had who had believed our report
[53:59] and to whom
[54:01] is the arm of the lord revealed
[54:05] yeah
[54:07] he said to unto the arm of the lord
[54:09] revealed
[54:10] it says and he shall grow up before him
[54:14] as a tender plant and as a root out of
[54:17] the
[54:18] the root out of the dry ground he had no
[54:21] form no comeliness when he shall when we
[54:24] shall when we shall see him there is no
[54:27] beauty that we should desire him
[54:30] he is despised and rejected
[54:33] of man a man of sorrow and acquainted
[54:36] with grief and the in and and we hit his
[54:40] we hid as it were
[54:43] our face from him he was it was uh
[54:46] despised and
[54:48] and this and the steam
[54:50] and they steam him not surely he had
[54:53] bore our griefs and our sorrows and yet
[54:56] we did esteem him
[54:58] stricken
[55:00] smitten of
[55:02] god and afflicted but he was wounded for
[55:06] our transgression he was bruised for
[55:08] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[55:11] was upon him and with his stripes we
[55:14] were healed
[55:18] and this young men read this portion of
[55:20] the scripture to the captain
[55:24] and he said to the captain that's how
[55:25] it's written in the bible
[55:31] but i'll try to read to you like my mom
[55:33] used to read to me
[55:36] how my mother taught me how to read the
[55:39] bible
[55:41] when my mother was reading this bible it
[55:43] is there he she was saying
[55:48] [Music]
[56:13] he was wounded for the transgression of
[56:16] willy pruitt
[56:19] he was bruised for the iniquity of willy
[56:22] pruitt
[56:26] the chastisement of of peace that was
[56:29] upon him was for willy pruitt
[56:36] and with his stripes that's why willy
[56:39] pruitt is here
[56:42] and not touch the heart off the captain
[56:45] and and captain said oh young man
[56:50] can you read it again now putting my
[56:52] name in it
[56:54] and he took again the bible
[57:00] he was wounded for the iniquity of john
[57:03] quartz
[57:07] the chastisement of peace that fall upon
[57:10] just uh the apollo that fall upon him it
[57:13] was for john paul
[57:16] [Music]
[57:18] and it was by his stripes that john paul
[57:21] john court was healed
[57:24] and the captain by listening to this
[57:28] he had sufficient faith
[57:30] and he was healed
[57:32] he don't confess
[57:33] that so when i read that as i was coming
[57:36] by studying i came across
[57:53] that every one of us put their names in
[57:55] it because
[57:57] it shows the group that there may not be
[57:59] something of just a group question
[58:03] that it may not be some a collective
[58:05] something because you're considering
[58:08] but that i may consider that what jesus
[58:10] said
[58:12] it's for me that he said
[58:16] what he promised as recompense
[58:19] it's for me that he promised
[58:22] a creature
[58:24] when we read the scripture of mark
[58:26] chapter 10
[58:29] when you read the story you go up a
[58:31] little bit you read the story
[58:33] you start from verse 17.
[58:39] we see that it's a story of the rich
[58:41] young ruler who came to jesus
[58:44] he came to jesus did he vomit he said
[58:47] good master referees
[59:06] what shall i do to inherit the king the
[59:08] eternal life he says
[59:11] jesus said why do you call me good
[59:13] that's a justin
[59:15] there's only one good and that's god
[59:18] he said you you know the commandment
[59:21] you're not going to kill you know fully
[59:22] up you won't steal you know
[59:24] that you won't commit adultery if you're
[59:26] up on the foot you're not going to give
[59:30] wrong testimonies
[59:32] and this young man told jesus
[59:37] he said i i i observe all this since my
[59:40] youth like i said
[59:42] particularly it was a particular young
[59:44] man
[59:55] i couldn't tell him that i lived all the
[59:57] ten commandments since my
[1:00:08] it says i see that you're lacking
[1:00:10] something eat the mocking shoes they
[1:00:12] you're lacking
[1:00:26] when this young man
[1:00:29] looked at all the riches that he had
[1:00:33] and to think about everything that he
[1:00:35] had
[1:00:37] when the bible talks about riches
[1:01:19] he looked at the consideration that he
[1:01:21] had among people
[1:01:42] and follow these people that everybody
[1:01:44] is criticizing
[1:01:46] the young men looked at all it is riches
[1:01:50] he
[1:02:06] he said it's it's it's it's easy for the
[1:02:08] camel to go to the eye of the needle
[1:02:13] than it is for the rich to a rich man to
[1:02:15] enter the kingdom of god it's the last
[1:02:17] condition
[1:02:18] and that was is
[1:02:20] something hard for the disciples that's
[1:02:22] goddamn
[1:02:24] that was difficult for them
[1:02:26] the countries don't distribute vacations
[1:02:28] and when they talked with jesus
[1:02:32] jesus said what is impossible to man
[1:02:36] it's possible to god
[1:02:39] and brother branham adds
[1:02:41] because
[1:02:42] possible that what's impossible to men
[1:02:45] nepal solomon possibly
[1:02:56] and that's where peter asked the
[1:02:58] question and said
[1:03:15] everything that we live in our lives
[1:03:18] sometimes we ask ourselves a question
[1:03:20] what is our recompense
[1:03:25] what is it paid what is what are we
[1:03:27] gaining by living this different life
[1:03:33] and jesus looked at them
[1:03:35] he said no one
[1:03:37] who because of me
[1:03:41] who has left his family
[1:03:43] his house that farm his wife
[1:03:46] his children
[1:03:48] everything that he has
[1:03:50] to follow
[1:03:53] he said the recompense that i will give
[1:03:55] him don't associate with prison
[1:04:01] i will give him a hundredfold the amazon
[1:04:04] the house the
[1:04:06] lambs the fair the brothers the the
[1:04:09] sisters
[1:04:30] hear jesus our master not with senior
[1:04:33] our lord
[1:04:34] he's telling us
[1:04:37] that if we follow him
[1:04:53] and we'll have a recompense on the other
[1:04:55] side
[1:04:59] that's why when we read that loop
[1:05:02] say we can think
[1:05:04] of
[1:05:04] listen
[1:05:07] that means that everyone who follows the
[1:05:09] lord
[1:05:10] we'll have a lot of money
[1:05:11] i'll have good houses
[1:05:13] we'll have a lot of languages
[1:05:15] because jesus said
[1:05:18] because it's jesus who promised it
[1:05:20] messenger
[1:05:29] he knows what to give to his children
[1:05:33] jesus knows every single one of us
[1:05:35] because you connect and limit the second
[1:05:37] jesus knows everyone's limit jesus
[1:05:40] separated jesus knows because you don't
[1:05:43] offer jonathan that if i give to brother
[1:05:46] jonathan and below the dollar of the
[1:05:48] sales person a million dollar salary per
[1:05:50] week he's very selfish that he can he
[1:05:53] will he will serve me with her he'll
[1:05:55] ever do that he will give him it he said
[1:05:57] and he knows that the teacher don't
[1:05:59] afraid paul that if i give to brother
[1:06:01] paul a million dollar person a thousand
[1:06:03] dollars a week if i'm abundant he will
[1:06:05] leave me he will not do that so he won't
[1:06:07] give it to me
[1:06:11] pascal is second should kill me because
[1:06:14] he knows that he wants you to follow
[1:06:16] him your value donation then in what i
[1:06:19] will give him
[1:06:22] it's not going to be for him to be
[1:06:25] okay it's not for him to be lifted up
[1:06:30] that he may know the lord in it
[1:06:33] look at peter and john the devil
[1:06:36] in in front of the get called beautiful
[1:06:40] if god gave them money he's always
[1:06:42] donated
[1:06:43] they would have given money to that
[1:06:45] person
[1:06:47] jesus didn't give them money
[1:06:50] but when they presented themselves to
[1:06:52] him
[1:06:53] they said we have no money we have no
[1:06:55] kids
[1:06:56] they didn't have it
[1:07:06] stand up and walk
[1:07:14] god gives us a recompense here on earth
[1:07:17] that's terrible we've done the mirror
[1:07:19] shots
[1:07:20] certainly god gives us gives us good
[1:07:22] things here on earth
[1:07:26] everything that god gives us is good
[1:07:31] job
[1:07:33] god can give me a little donut please
[1:07:35] and give more to another brother
[1:07:39] but everything that he does is beautiful
[1:07:43] the same way he says in genesis country
[1:07:45] like creative shows when he created
[1:07:47] something
[1:07:49] he said that was good
[1:07:51] forever and everything that god does is
[1:07:54] good two seconds everything that he
[1:07:56] wants take a new demo
[1:07:59] that we may abide in his word can we
[1:08:01] continue
[1:08:03] that we continue to follow him
[1:08:08] says when this young man laughed
[1:08:11] he prospered even more
[1:08:14] prosperity
[1:08:17] that which means the prosperity was not
[1:08:19] a sign that god was with him
[1:08:36] as
[1:08:53] i don't even have enough places to store
[1:08:55] all of this
[1:08:57] the the scriptures is the the
[1:08:59] god told him uh fool
[1:09:04] your soul will be required this night
[1:09:08] and the bible says
[1:09:10] this young this this this uh rich man
[1:09:13] died
[1:09:16] and the lazarus who was poor also died
[1:09:22] he thought that his recompense was only
[1:09:25] on earth
[1:09:29] he just thought that his recompense was
[1:09:31] only the goods or the riches
[1:09:43] he realized that he found himself it was
[1:09:45] in the lost land he continued
[1:09:48] and when he when he looks up don't say
[1:09:50] tomorrow in the tormentary wars if while
[1:09:53] a prophet understands
[1:09:55] he sees lazarus on the other side on the
[1:09:58] bosom of abraham
[1:10:00] he said oh father abraham the one that
[1:10:02] lasted the plungers used to do i don't
[1:10:05] know if you can ask lazarus to just put
[1:10:07] his finger in the water
[1:10:11] and just to to drop a drop of a droplet
[1:10:14] of water on my tongue
[1:10:18] it was it was negotiating just for a
[1:10:20] drop of water
[1:10:22] to him who had everything when he was on
[1:10:25] earth
[1:10:27] but he rejected eternal life
[1:10:32] he was conscious that he didn't have
[1:10:34] eternal life
[1:10:36] he knew he didn't have it
[1:10:39] he had he had the opportunity within
[1:10:42] this life
[1:10:57] because of material riches
[1:11:01] the father abraham tells him
[1:11:05] it says there is a chasm between us and
[1:11:08] you yeah
[1:11:11] no way for glazer to even cross over to
[1:11:14] do anything
[1:11:15] he said oh father abraham
[1:11:17] i understand
[1:11:19] because you suppose that i'm lost
[1:11:22] but i have five brothers
[1:11:41] that they may
[1:11:42] they may accept this double recompense
[1:11:46] the recompense here on earth
[1:11:49] and the recompense on the other side
[1:11:52] lasher stole them
[1:12:06] to them the word of god
[1:12:10] the same way that you had the
[1:12:11] opportunity to listen to the gospel
[1:12:14] and you rejected
[1:12:17] them also
[1:12:20] god is giving them the same opportunity
[1:12:22] to hear the word
[1:12:23] yet if they reject you
[1:12:26] they will follow the same road
[1:12:33] but god promises the recompense
[1:12:34] recompense
[1:12:38] the scripture says it's a rewarder of
[1:12:41] all of them that diligently seek after
[1:12:42] yeah
[1:12:44] it's the best boss that ever existed
[1:13:01] because we want to compare ourselves
[1:13:03] with the world
[1:13:06] because we want to compare ourselves
[1:13:08] with somebody else
[1:13:12] but he said you if you miss
[1:13:14] it
[1:13:15] he said uh uh mr evil that you are
[1:13:21] that you are you are able to give good
[1:13:23] things to your children
[1:13:26] how much more your heavenly father
[1:13:29] is
[1:13:39] he will always give us the good
[1:13:41] recompense
[1:13:43] they don't think
[1:13:58] which means when we agreed to become a
[1:14:00] christian we knew the acceptance of
[1:14:02] civilization when we accept to follow
[1:14:04] the lord
[1:14:05] accepted
[1:14:07] when we agreed to to follow the word
[1:14:11] we have to be
[1:14:12] conscious the proof of election
[1:14:15] that that temptation and uh tests and
[1:14:17] persecutions
[1:14:19] are not components it's part of our
[1:14:22] reward
[1:14:25] it's part of the bonus of our salary
[1:14:30] and the bible says that the the trying
[1:14:32] of our faith the project can get
[1:14:35] to the mail that's what produces
[1:14:37] something good
[1:14:43] god uses trials and temptations
[1:14:47] so he can make us perfect fulfill the
[1:14:49] veritas defeated to make us true sons
[1:14:52] and daughters to him
[1:15:06] when he was talking about the beatitudes
[1:15:19] a wrong or a false testimony for you on
[1:15:23] you because of me if you can't confess
[1:15:26] when they do that because of my name
[1:15:31] you have to be happy
[1:15:34] you shouldn't be
[1:15:36] sad
[1:15:48] efficient church
[1:16:04] didn't jesus say blessed are you when
[1:16:07] you are persecuted for righteousness
[1:16:13] he never said to start getting formal
[1:16:17] he said rejoice
[1:16:21] and be exceedingly glad
[1:16:27] for they persecuted the prophets which
[1:16:30] were before you elijah
[1:16:34] he said that
[1:16:35] he said that that was in the beatitude
[1:16:37] in matthew chapter 5
[1:16:44] blessed are you
[1:16:46] why
[1:16:47] you have a people that make fun of you
[1:16:50] that make fun of you because you love
[1:16:52] the lord jesus it is sachin benedict
[1:16:57] it is a blessing just to have them say
[1:16:59] it kill the existence that they may just
[1:17:02] say it lost

[1:17:20] when people curse you
[1:17:23] when people persecute you back up with
[1:17:26] them
[1:17:26] because you love the lord in the
[1:17:28] forecast benedict's under justice
[1:17:30] they're just attracting the blessings of
[1:17:32] god on you
[1:17:36] so when you have persecutions
[1:17:39] god brings the blessings
[1:17:41] that's his recompense
[1:17:44] he said be happy
[1:17:47] be
[1:17:47] exceeding
[1:17:50] every time somebody is mocking you
[1:17:53] because you are a christian yeah

[1:18:16] when they try to make fun of you for
[1:18:18] being a christian
[1:18:22] it backs fires on them
[1:18:25] and god gives you the blessings
[1:18:32] because because blessed are you when ye
[1:18:35] shall be persecuted for my name's sake

[1:19:29] there's no man there's no perfect man
[1:19:31] like him
[1:19:49] of it and god knew because
[1:19:52] that god job had all these reaches they
[1:19:54] telling me that he could have he should
[1:19:56] have loved him
[1:19:58] and to look to serve him with all of
[1:20:00] that
[1:20:03] and he knew that even if god was to take
[1:20:05] all of that
[1:20:07] that god could not he could not forsake
[1:20:10] the lord
[1:20:12] and if god knows that you don't approve
[1:20:15] that he gives you a little bit
[1:20:31] of what god is giving you as recompense
[1:20:33] here on earth
[1:20:36] be in exceedingly gladness for what god
[1:20:39] has given you
[1:20:42] because that's what he feels is good for
[1:20:44] you

[1:20:58] the job
[1:21:12] he came to take his health
[1:21:14] job
[1:21:18] he didn't see what was happening between
[1:21:20] god and satan
[1:21:23] he didn't know
[1:21:26] even when god told satan
[1:21:30] i give you i give you the authority to

[1:22:23] how far can we move forward with him
[1:22:26] job stayed firm
[1:22:29] and when jobs stayed firm
[1:22:33] the recompense came to follow

[1:22:40] oh come to your earliest job
[1:22:42] when god talked to job that day
[1:22:45] wrong job was different
[1:22:48] as you said he still had the boils on
[1:22:50] him
[1:23:03] it says even in this body it's destroyed
[1:23:07] i don't care
[1:23:10] if this body goes
[1:23:12] i don't care
[1:23:15] but i know my redeemer live it just say
[1:23:18] i know because
[1:23:20] that i will see him
[1:23:22] it's not going to be the eyes of
[1:23:24] somebody else
[1:23:29] it was a revelation an individual
[1:23:31] revelation
[1:23:47] himself to him personally
[1:23:50] he understood that his persecution
[1:23:53] it was a recompense
[1:23:56] and because of that
[1:23:59] god give him back his health
[1:24:14] that the persecution
[1:24:29] legend
[1:24:30] the prostitute woman
[1:24:33] who went to simon
[1:24:37] says he came to the feet of jesus
[1:24:41] and she started crying at the feet of
[1:24:42] jesus
[1:24:44] and she cried jesus
[1:24:46] jesus was quiet
[1:24:50] she didn't know what was going to happen
[1:24:52] but what she did
[1:24:55] she was doing something for the lord
[1:24:58] she said the lord lord i will do this
[1:25:00] for you
[1:25:01] lord i i i i forsake my sacrifice
[1:25:05] i forgive me for my prostitution jesus
[1:25:08] i'm tired
[1:25:10] i want to
[1:25:25] i'm in the middle of all these pharisees
[1:25:28] but perhaps they will they will throw
[1:25:30] stones at me
[1:25:32] she didn't ask yourself a question
[1:25:35] what am i doing
[1:25:37] is it i'll continue to
[1:25:39] i'll continue to follow him
[1:25:43] and she took everything that she was
[1:25:44] preaching
[1:25:46] the hair and i feel like she started
[1:25:48] wiping the hair the feet of jesus
[1:25:51] she took the most expensive perfume
[1:25:54] she put on jesus face the neck allah
[1:25:56] found himself it's only until the
[1:25:59] service ended
[1:26:00] that jesus said yes
[1:26:03] i'm happy with you
[1:26:05] it says woman they're not working
[1:26:14] for the pharisees that were there they
[1:26:15] take them and blaspheme it was like a
[1:26:17] blasphemous
[1:26:19] who's this man
[1:26:34] i'll just take an example like that yeah
[1:26:36] they think there was one who owed five
[1:26:39] thousand dollars
[1:26:41] and the others oh a hundred dollars
[1:26:45] possibility
[1:26:46] and both of them they didn't have the
[1:26:48] possibility to pay the credit
[1:26:51] now the one who they owe the money to
[1:26:53] forgive all their debts
[1:26:58] which of the two would have been more
[1:26:59] thankful
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:02] except the
[1:27:21] even though the lord seemed to have been
[1:27:23] quiet continue when you continue our
[1:27:26] voice continue to go forward
[1:27:28] continue to walk that benedict the
[1:27:30] blessing
[1:27:59] way of recompensing us
[1:28:09] and we know that we always have to hold
[1:28:11] firm
[1:28:17] because you will notice that every time
[1:28:19] that god spoke to the messenger through
[1:28:21] the church ages
[1:28:24] there was always a message of
[1:28:26] encouragement
[1:28:28] for the believers pull exactly
[1:28:30] to exalt them
[1:28:35] so they can always be victorious
[1:28:37] basketball to you answer
[1:28:40] because you always say to him that
[1:28:42] overcometh you should do nearly i will
[1:28:44] give i shall be given to him that
[1:28:46] overcometh don't suck casually in every
[1:28:49] a church age on a palliative ankle it
[1:28:51] spoke of overcomers
[1:28:55] you cannot have overcomers don't kill
[1:28:57] yet the battalion without the battle
[1:28:59] sunken yet to come back without the
[1:29:01] fight they don't say no
[1:29:04] so if we want to be overcomers
[1:29:08] let's let's consider that we have a
[1:29:10] recompense the persecution the
[1:29:12] persecutions
[1:29:14] let the proof the the trials
[1:29:17] it's part of the recompense
[1:29:20] but one of them says don't lose
[1:29:23] in the message we have seen his story
[1:29:25] and i've come to worship him
[1:29:30] and he says and sometimes we think that
[1:29:32] our burden
[1:29:35] is
[1:29:44] it says that i might inject this right
[1:29:46] here it says that we think that our
[1:29:48] burdens are so heavy sometimes that
[1:29:51] there is nothing like it in the world
[1:29:58] do you know that all those things are
[1:30:00] for your good for you
[1:30:03] sorry do you know that all those things
[1:30:05] are good for you
[1:30:11] they are all they are
[1:30:13] all to mold you i will fascinate to make
[1:30:17] you
[1:30:18] the prophet elisa
[1:30:22] prophets and sages was molded on the
[1:30:25] backside of the desert
[1:30:32] and the persecution in the hot sun in
[1:30:35] the blazing sun through tribulations and
[1:30:38] trials and persecution
[1:30:40] in in persecutions
[1:30:52] and these things that we have today
[1:30:54] there's nothing happened to us
[1:30:57] that hasn't happened to other christians
[1:30:59] before us
[1:31:13] other christian has had to stand in the
[1:31:16] hour of darkness like this and even be
[1:31:18] fed to lions for their testimonies
[1:31:29] and then we take down a little pristi a
[1:31:32] little prestige and sometimes we think
[1:31:35] we are
[1:31:36] epia
[1:31:42] you should
[1:31:45] it says well well i belong to so and so
[1:31:48] uh this certain church uh you know it
[1:31:52] says i'm afraid i'll bring reproach if i
[1:31:55] need
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:31:59] don't be afraid of your testimony for
[1:32:02] jesus christ
[1:32:09] shed forth is your light
[1:32:11] position
[1:32:13] stand for your convictions
[1:32:17] to you that he is the son of god
[1:32:21] you need a visit to well
[1:32:24] mr
[1:32:27] it says and this is not a night for
[1:32:29] chris crinkle uh for crinkle or chris
[1:32:32] crinkle but it's the birth of jesus
[1:32:34] christ we are celebrating
[1:32:38] and we see that god promises a reward or
[1:32:41] recompense
[1:32:44] that we have to be able to act
[1:32:47] to access that recompense
[1:32:51] but how is god helping us to access this
[1:32:54] recompense
[1:32:57] god is helping us access this reward
[1:33:01] in giving us his faith
[1:33:04] in giving us his power
[1:33:34] and if my word abides in you demon
[1:33:39] ask what you will
[1:33:43] and that will be given unto you
[1:33:47] it means when we keep the word of god
[1:33:50] when we follow the word of god
[1:33:54] everything that we ask him is
[1:33:56] he will give it to us
[1:33:58] but i tell you concealer
[1:34:01] that if the thing is for you to be lost
[1:34:06] he will not give it unto you
[1:34:10] but he's giving us all his power
[1:34:16] says
[1:34:30] he says
[1:34:44] when he was crucified
[1:34:57] he gave us access to all the blessings
[1:35:02] that he gave access to our pardon for
[1:35:04] our sins
[1:35:07] he gave access for the for the salvation
[1:35:10] of our souls
[1:35:37] it says amen cut every obstacle for from
[1:35:41] human being that they might be connected
[1:35:44] like in the garden of eden
[1:35:50] it says i was i i was going to to choke
[1:35:54] it but i'm going to say it
[1:35:57] love it
[1:35:59] man is omnipotent
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:05] it says you don't believe that
[1:36:08] but
[1:36:13] a man fully surrendered to god is
[1:36:16] omnipotent they don't circumcise what
[1:36:19] god is asking us said that separate my
[1:36:22] pleasure
[1:36:37] access to everything that we have need
[1:36:38] of it
[1:36:53] they did not say in mark 11 and 22 that
[1:36:56] whatsoever things you say don't doubt in
[1:37:00] your heart it will come to pass
[1:37:11] what happened when two omnipotence myths
[1:37:17] when god and man come together
[1:37:22] something it's got to shake whatever
[1:37:26] whatever
[1:37:28] whatever
[1:37:30] whatever you would say to that creative
[1:37:33] power of the omnipotent god
[1:37:36] for me
[1:37:37] knowing that is promised ella nonsense
[1:37:41] and he said it in his word
[1:37:46] speculation
[1:37:48] it creates a power that goes out yonder
[1:37:51] and brings the thing to pass the shots
[1:37:56] come sensitive
[1:37:57] things that are not
[1:37:59] it makes them those answer the word
[1:38:05] because two omnipotent power have met
[1:38:08] the last opposition there he stands oh
[1:38:12] nothing foreign
[1:38:17] and most time we don't recognize our
[1:38:19] position
[1:38:22] we don't recognize our reward or our
[1:38:24] recompense
[1:38:26] we're not we're not claiming our
[1:38:28] recompense to
[1:39:10] but there was
[1:39:38] not where i
[1:39:52] we have a body as theophany body
[1:39:55] kidnapping
[1:39:56] that has to influence this mortal body
[1:40:01] this natural mortal body that cannot
[1:40:03] inherit the kingdom
[1:40:06] but what we know
[1:40:17] regardless of how we leave the earth
[1:40:34] but i know there's a body
[1:40:37] this is the day this body drops
[1:40:40] that body will take place
[1:40:45] and he said
[1:40:47] he's preparing us a place
[1:40:50] that where he is
[1:40:52] that we may be also
[1:40:55] but god is preparing us here
[1:40:59] that's why he told he sent us a
[1:41:01] wonderful message
[1:41:05] the bible says the one who receives the
[1:41:07] prophet
[1:41:09] receive the rewards of the prophet
[1:41:13] what is different from us and the
[1:41:15] denomination
[1:41:31] to have the natural blessings mr massage
[1:41:33] as shoot but this message is added
[1:41:38] through the revelation of the world
[1:41:41] the rapture phrase 34 this phrase give
[1:41:44] giveaway
[1:41:47] that will take us from here to that body
[1:41:49] over there
[1:41:54] so we can have that eternal life
[1:41:58] let's stand
[1:42:03] [Applause]
[1:42:26] if they ask you entrepreneur between
[1:42:29] living in heaven
[1:42:31] and living in the world
[1:42:34] which one would you would you choose
[1:42:36] he says i will live in the world
[1:42:39] because he said heaven and earth pass
[1:42:41] away but the word will not pass away
[1:42:45] and god wants us to stay in the world
[1:42:49] and if we stay in the world
[1:42:53] certainly this this reward is real you
[1:42:55] have the persecution there it's going to
[1:42:57] be persecution
[1:42:59] and when they come
[1:43:00] be happy
[1:43:02] bless the lord so i don't see you be
[1:43:05] sure can you benediction that is a
[1:43:07] blessing that's coming
[1:43:21] don't pay attention to what the markers
[1:43:36] that we may realize will come to the
[1:43:37] understanding of our position
[1:43:40] that we are sons and daughters of god
[1:43:44] and they're sons and daughters of god do
[1:43:45] you have many parties
[1:43:47] god placed a part of his of of his
[1:43:50] divinity within us
[1:43:53] we are supposed to be living as gods
[1:43:55] know some something manifested we are
[1:43:57] supposed to manifest god do something
[1:44:00] manifested
[1:44:02] we are supposed to manifest what jesus
[1:44:04] said
[1:44:08] it says in a little while the world will
[1:44:09] not see me knowing
[1:44:12] but
[1:44:12] and then the world will not see me
[1:44:14] anymore
[1:44:15] but you you shall see me fearful of why
[1:44:18] if you see him feel it if he's in you
[1:44:20] let's serve killer that's the works that
[1:44:22] he did
[1:44:24] that he shall do also in you
[1:44:30] that we may say like this mighty
[1:44:31] soldiers
[1:44:45] oh if the lord be with us
[1:44:48] where are all these miracles
[1:44:51] oh where our fathers had told us
[1:44:55] that the lord may help us to go forward
[1:44:58] to take our positions
[1:45:16] through this few words that were spoken
[1:45:20] father maybe not even put correctly
[1:45:23] but you lord
[1:45:25] you can speak to us
[1:45:27] father you can place it properly within
[1:45:30] our heart
[1:45:31] father you can reveal yourself to each
[1:45:33] other
[1:45:35] father we know that the true phrase
[1:45:38] it's a personal revelation
[1:45:42] the same way that your revelation hate
[1:45:44] jokes
[1:45:45] father even tonight
[1:45:48] as we read the word
[1:45:51] as we listen to your word
[1:45:54] father like this young man willie pruitt
[1:45:57] told us
[1:45:58] father in taking our names
[1:46:02] but to put it next to every promise
[1:46:06] we can realize tonight
[1:46:08] that all this reward
[1:46:18] father maybe not a blessing like we
[1:46:20] think of a blessing
[1:46:22] father not the blessing may be the way
[1:46:24] we
[1:46:38] we give

[1:58:38] it molded my character lord it made me

[1:59:09] blood lord but we know that there's
[1:59:10] spirits behind these things we know that
