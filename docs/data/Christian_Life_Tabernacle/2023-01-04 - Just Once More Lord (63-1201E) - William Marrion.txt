On Sunday, December 1st 1963 Brother William Marrion Branham ministered "Just Once More Lord" at Life tabernacle in Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.
1 hour and 20 minutes, 

Online Streamed Wednesday 7pm - January 4, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Placer just said yeah yes now I do and uh the children I remember a few years ago Minneapolis they were little bitty fellas now I have to look up to them here great big boy and girl sister stats Cliff you're not long ago then really had my heart whirling around a little mother she lost her baby and the Lord was seen fit to take it away and she'd call me and she wanted to go fly me over to Germany and the doctor was so kind to wait and let the baby lay there the little fellow died suddenly a sweet little plumpy girl and sister staz Clifford lost her mother and she's pretty well broke up this baby certainly had got the best of her and she got on the phone long distance from Germany and wanted to fly over and I said sister stats cliff she confessed her faith and she believed that the Lord Jesus had sent me for the work in the last days and it's a loyal testimony and no one could give a shame in it with all of her heart she had seen the Lord God do such things as that raise up the dead after they were dead but you see you really as much as I how what a glory that would have been to God in Germany and everything if I could have done it myself I would have done it but the first thing we mustn't go until we know what we're going for so I went out and prayed and I think she stayed on the phone part of the time through the night and the next day I come in there was nothing again meaty said my wife said sister saska called twice any word from the law again I said not a thing and I said well I went out Pray Again is in the woods that night then of course the little baby had to be taken care of and then just as I was coming in the Lord Jesus Vision struck standing from him and I heard his voice said don't rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord so I knew then that God for some reason had taken her baby to glory and it was a certainly against the will of the Lord for me to say anything contrary to it and then I thought well that'll be a big letdown another one thing I did on minded the Lord I did what he told me you're not long ago I got a letter from a minister over there and he had made a statement sent by some more ministers he said the one and he was I think he might have been a German Lutheran I'm not sure but he said there's one thing that I can admire about brother Branham when all the excitement is going on he stayed steady until he got a clear-cut decision from God then he knows what he was doing that's the only way you can do those things is first year from the Lord when he tells if he told me tonight that to go up there and raise out of that Cemetery President Kennedy I'd invite the whole world to come watch it done where I'd have dust saith the Lord now but how can I say thus saith the Lord until the Lord has said thus right right many times people gets all excited go under Impressions and things like that and want their best of their middle can think that ain't always true wait till he tells you and you know it then you've got exactly you don't have to guess about it he's done told you it's thus saith the Lord then he's told you and then you can go say what he said until then you can go and do everything you can do what you can yourself but you can't be sure until God has said so then you're positive on the table what time is it sirs many of these got to take I could speak for the chapters and anywhere else and say it's thus saith the Lord I'll meet seven angels and it'll be known the country's over see and something's fixing to happen before he told me there it was just the three months afterwards see all these other things when you when you the Lord is spoken it's got to happen that's the reason that I know that his word is perfect no matter what people think about it it's the word of God that's right that's thus saith the Lord right that's and we know that that's true Jesus is coming when I don't know what farm how you come I have an idea but I don't know it's wrote in here he said I if I be taken up you draw a man to him and he would come again I know he's coming oh that's positive and it doesn't matter to me what it is see if it's tonight or if it's next year or if it's a thousand years from now just so he comes I got eternal life I ain't going to be any older I'm just going to be there when he comes that's all that's it doesn't matter to me when how which way he does it just so I'm there and he promised me that I would be there and he has already give me eternal life because he said he that can receive my words and Believe on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come to the Judgment but passed from Death To Life that's good enough for me right there that's my absolute that's my absolute he promised it there's no way for it to ever fail it just cannot fail no more than God can fail it's impossible for God to fail that's one thing that God cannot do fail you can't fail aren't you happy for that I begin to see the years counting up and begin to see it two or three services a day he's beginning to make me get just a little bit tired or it used to didn't bother me but then I think well what difference does it make I want to ask you something we're just Home Folks so on that what if you're 80 years old tonight or you're 15 years old tonight if you're 80 years old and you live till this time tomorrow night you'll outlive many many young 16 year old children you ever think of that sure will you're here for a purpose to serve God so what difference in the age it is to you you serve God if God come to me and said I want you to go to Earth and uh and I was up there and he said go to Earth I'm going to give you a 100 Year space of the knowledge but I want you to Lodge your years what years you want to take the first 25 the second 25 the third 25 are the last of 25. what would I see well if I'm going to put my time here to be a oh uh a football player or an athlete or something I better take the first 25. if I'm gonna be here to be a carpenter or some person like that well I better take the second 25. but if I want to take to serve the Lord I'll take the last 25 from 75 to 100 because I've had the accumulation of that much knowledge I'll know more about it as long as I stand on my two feet walk around what difference will make how old I am I'm here to serve the Lord and that's it amen that's good enough for me he promised it now I want to thank each and every one of you for your kindness and uh trusting that the Lord willing at at again we'll meet somewhere in this earth if not the more here we will on the other side and the Lord blessed I want to pray over these handkerchiefs as soon as we get into the message we don't or just exactly what'll happen we tried to put a couple nights in the three about three nights of the five or six five nights of Lee the lord gave us a calling among the people of uh calling the people out where the Lord would heal him and then we had a one night last night we brought every person that want to be prayed right through the prayer line and prayed for him and I have hope that I haven't failed anywhere to try to do everything that I know how to do for us being better spiritual condition and physical condition tonight than we were when we come in here about four or five nights ago if I failed God forgive me and you forgive me now for the closing message and I'm going to try to make it just quick as possible because I I preach long and I I've told my congregation and so forth at beginning the first year I'm going to try to I've tried it for the last 35 years if it's been a Ministry to cut down from this two hours and so forth down to 30 minutes but I'm so slow I can't say what I want to say in 30 minutes I'm a southerner you know and so I I just have to okay think of it too fast I just got the weight and see I got to wait on him for my words uh just as long as I can wait on him and you'll just be patient with me now let's read some scripture so we know that this won't pass away and as we have our little uh get together of friendship and talking before we approach this real sacred part of the service bringing the bread of life let's just pray again Lord Jesus now we are grateful to you we're all turning to you to thank you for this great days and nights of service Fellowship around the word and with the people we're grateful Lord our Spirits has been lifted up and we're so thankful that we've been able to sit in Heavenly places with you and our father on this great and last night of the the love Feast may you stand in the midst of us again tonight you cry he that's thirsty come unto me Granite Lord we know you will because you do it that's your way of doing things and you never change it and I pray God that you'll break the bread of life to us may we be able to receive that word into our heart that will open a fountain of blessings to all of us bless the reading of the word and help me as I try to break the bread of life to the congregation for whatever the need is in Jesus Christ's name amen let's turn to the uh the book of the judges uh the judges of Israel and I want to turn to the 16th chapter of judges to read a portion of the of the word judges the 16th chapter and I want to read the 27th and the 28th verses now the house is full of man and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and there were up on the roof about 3 000 men and women the hell the hell was Samson made sport and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once O Lord that I may be once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes what a pitiful sight and this little subject I'm going to take a takes out of any calling just once more Lord just once more must have been a hot day it had a great celebration and it makes me feel bad every time I think of it because the nature of that religious celebration uh you know a celebration's all right but it's according to the nature of the celebration and this was one celebration that I certainly hate to refer to it was in the land of the Philistines and they were celebrating it just makes me feel bad to say it victory over God's servants God's disobedient servant had brought a reproach upon the name of the Lord and went down in defeat and these Philistines were celebrating the the great time of victory that their fish God had gotten victory over Jehovah's servant if that isn't a text they end up a meeting on but I felt led as I was looking through some five or six hundred texts that I had there my eyes dropped up on this texture and I thought I believe I'll just uh talk about that a little while tonight and maybe that's what the Holy Spirit would want us to know something about in here um about hot day I believe and the sacrifices was burning and the fire around this great fish God and there were three thousand Philistines looking down at the pair as they entered the great Stadium it must have been like a mushroom a way that fixed it I like I'd say something on the order of a of a mushroom or Toadstool turned up like this with two great uh pile Esters or or pillows holding up the stadium as it's set like a more on this shape maybe it so that the people in this great Stadium could look down to the entertainment that was going on down on the main floor and highly polished Warlords attended that meeting and their fine Jewel the ladies was at the meeting and they all stopped suddenly to lean forward the main event was just about to take place we have uh sometimes what we call the preliminaries they and then the introduction the Prelude to the uh the main event that had much entertainment as they did sometimes sacrificing and killing and so forth but now the the main event was just about to take place and all this bunch of fine celebrity of all the uh the regions in the Philistines land they raised up because they were a privilege they were setting up in this big uh we call it like a mushroom and perhaps the poor and so forth were down here on the on the floor but they set up where they could get a good look and see all the entertainment it was a it was a celebrity box three thousand of them the air was stinking with drinks drunken reverie all day drinking and slobbering and carrying on the way a drunken brawl can be like that and they all stood up because the main event was about to take place and they leaned over they wanted to get a good look they couldn't afford to miss this well this is the main event what did they see a little boy leading a blind man out to the middle of the floor in the celebration of the fish God Dagon the lion LED this stumbling blind book of Flesh blind and to the post and stood him by the side of the post to make sport so this is sense a man that was a an outstanding servant of God now he stands there humiliated blind weakened a disgraced it's a picture of us of a demoralized sunken generation it's a picture of of a of a Nation that has lost his hope with God it's a picture of a church that's lost its hold on God's word because that's what Samson represented here you heliated broken he was in a terrible condition as he sat there or stood there rather so could you imagine him standing this great man that one time what he could do and here he is standing here in that condition you humiliated as I said broken a symbol and I want to declare tonight this symbol represents the very hour that we're now living the condition of the church now broken out of the word of the Lord humiliated out of its place and the question is coming today the handwritings on the wall and who can read it they know nothing about it let's take and search the minds of those Philistines this man's very name Samson at one time caused the whole nation to tremble just mention Samson cause God was with him and the Nations tremble because of his very name that's the same way it used to be the name of Jesus Christ but now it it's used as a curse word jokes there don't seem to be any more reverence to it well that's name is above every name there's ever named on Mortal tongues it's a name that even it's a high exalted above every name that's in heaven every name upon the Earth and all the family in Heaven and Earth is named and yet man take it in curse words church members use it in jokes and Many religious leaders blasphemen with their Creeds that's the reason that we're humiliated in the face of communism romanism and protestantism and the things that's rising in the Earth today and that's the reason that we're humiliated we ought to know these answers God's got it in his book for this day went to something else forgot about it many of the Philistines as they stood there of them great Warriors No Doubt somebody announced that the next event is Samson many of those Warriors but they're fine jeweled polished up uh women looked over the banisher and remembered seeing Samson stand in a different way one time when the spirit of the Lord was upon him standing with the Jawbone of a mule in his hands with a thousand Philistines laying around him and they'd run to a rock somewhere to take refuge when a man picked up the Jawbone of a mule that had been laying on the desert anyone knows that one hit on a rock or anything with that bone would shatter it to pieces and those helmets some of them was an inch to inch and a half thick of brass and this man was not a soldier and he was the trained man for for the spirit and Philistines with a coat of Nao mail that is laced over lap over like a jealousy window but the metal that keeps Spears and things from hitting them and also with helmets and with shields and with Spears and they surrounded this man's Samson and thought the great uh cream of the army would be able to take this man and he had nothing in his hand he found it all dry Jawbone of the new and he began to hit right and left until he beat down a thousand Philistines why the Bible said the spirit of the Lord was upon him here he's still different now he'd give away his secret and they clearly couldn't remember him there might have been another group up there could remember one night and one Delilah had Bewitched him into the uh the city of Gaza and their clothes or big Gates probably when a ton or more a piece great big brass gates to the city that had iron bars and it went back into the rocks and fast with such hinges that we wouldn't have such like it today and they said the Philistines be upon these Samson and man the soldiers standing around the gate and was speechless when he could break the cards walk down and they scattered like a bunch of roaches at night time when the lights turned on the spirit of the Lord upon Him reached over jerk one gate out jerked the other night and put it on his shoulder and walked up the hill and sat down they can remember that what a warrior many of them could remember that a semen and great victory but look at him now that's a picture of the church I can read in the Bible of the church when he was first filled with the Holy Ghost great signs and wonders accompany their meetings we can remember a few years ago 40 or 50 years ago when the church was filled with that same power but look at it today she stands stripped something a stricter the same thing the stripped Samson all calls by listening to a woman a tuck it in and what stripped the church is listening to that organized woman situation that old Jezebel the very thing that Samson had been raised up to defeat had defeated him and the Pentecostal church tonight stands in those same tracks the very thing she was raised up to defeat denominationalism she has grouped herself back into it again and her power's gone right the power of the Lord laughter we ought to know that every time through history that a church ever organized God left it right then it fell and never did rise again and Pentecost was something that come out of the denomination but what it was we adopted man-made leadership instead of the Holy Ghost that's exactly what Samson done foreign think of it what a Musta went through that man's mind while he stood there he must have thought of all the great victories God had given the great things that God had done with him and for him and and how that while he was with God the power of His Spirit and the joy and the peace that he had while he was with God nation that Samson was raised up to destroy had him bound and the very thing that God raised Pentecost to do has abound get the fellowship fit the power fussing stewing lukewarm members find things great everything that they'd be better off if they if they had the old Salvation Army drum or the little old guitar down on the corner somewhere again I gotta have it like that and to have our Cathedrals that we're getting costing millions of dollars but very soon he had failed I was a prisoner of the very nation and God raised him up to destroy they had him had it to entertain them that's all it is today some kind of a little gimmick to try to entertain them let a woman lure him from the promised word of God that's the same thing the church did and has let a woman Jezebel the mother of Hearts represented in Revelation 17 lure them right back into the vomit that they come out of as the Bible says as a hog go returns to its water and a dog to its vomit and as long as that hog remains a hog he'll his nature is a hog he'll go right back to the water and you're the only way you'll keep him out of the mud hole is to change his nature that's the only way you're gonna go to ever get any differs in the church today has got to have a change of nature instead of some ecclesiastical system leading the preachers around it'll take the Holy Ghost to the word to lead them back to that God-fearing spirit of God that's right if the doll vomit and it made him sick at his stomach the first time when he made him sick again and if God called us out of such a mess because it why I want to do the same thing again then we go right back into it the same thing it should never be done this Jezebel system now blind spiritually I'm saying to the word of God joining themselves right into the Council of churches everything our great Evangelical teaching we have to Forfeit that to be an organization because all organizations that isn't in this Council churches I got the paper on it that even if your church is not in this counselor churches a time of trouble they can use your church to story emanation or anything they want to and if any man is caught having a prayer for anybody outside of uh affiliating with this counselor churches can be shot as a federal offense that's right I got the papers art from Washington you're they're going to force you into it that's why I've been against this organizational system that's it I had to keep it quiet about being the mark of the beast but it's late enough now that you can know it's the truth it is it's exactly that now what has it done it's brought the church stripped of its power nothing but name it pictures it exactly in Revelation 3 the lady osia Church age rejected Christ and on the outside exactly why it did just its act like its mother did went back to the denominational Pentecost born out of denomination born out of that and as soon as he got a bunch of a bunch in from some school and they had to have seminaries and things to instead of upper rooms and now many of the big churches a man has to pass a psychiatrist test before he's permitted to be a overseas missionary the first church didn't have to test a psychiatrist test but they had to go to the test of the blood of Jesus Christ what made the difference notice Samson giveaway is secret to Delilah she finally loved him and patted him and told him he was a nice man how she loved him until she found where the secret was then she bobbed off the secret that's exactly the way old mother Jezebel has done the Protestant church has crocked in and now they're compromising on a few little doctrines that said to have so they can have Unity over the world and the first place the church got her locks bobbed off was it nice here and she's going to Bob him again since she's been here that's your secret is the word if you abide me in my word and you can ask what you will it'll be done for you that's where they lose their secret now look at him defeated just like Samson was ministers instead of being born as David duplicit said one time God don't have Pentecostal grandchildren but that's why you say my mother was Pentecostal she had an experience she did this my father did so and so that ain't got nothing to do with you you got to have the same thing now we got cemeteries that hatch out our ministers then we're building bigger ones all the time and um and we got students of psychology and that's all right if you want to teach psychology I don't care about psychology I just want to know Jesus Christ that's all I all I want to know is him now we find that we got it it certainly has to bring to pass the prophecy of second Timothy 3 or there be lukewarm you know heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than of God truce Breakers the incontinent and Fierce and despisers those that are good what has it done to us it's almost made our Pentecostal women uh Hollywood Showmanship that's right it used to be wrong to go to the movies the bicycle but now you know the devil just beat him to that he put it right in the house that's right it used to be wrong to do it used to be wrong for our sisters to cut the hair or wear short dresses but now it isn't not in the Pentecostal way of thinking in their organization but is still wrong by God's word but you see they got their their their their power bobbed off see and then they say well our church be I don't care what's your church believes is what God Said that's the reason she stands today without the answer that's exactly the way a Samson student Samson was the same thing he must have thought of his heirs as he stood there I don't believe a man could stand there and think since but what could think knowing here he is now he's just become a a stamina what a condition great big man stand there all the man that ever was in him as far as what I call muscles every one of them is there he still had his muscles he still had his big muscles his biceps he had he had a great big Fists he still probably was just as big as he ever was frankly the Pentecostal church is a lot bigger than it ever was but where was God that's him yes As you stood there remember his errors he remembered what caused it first what caused it first was not exactly his natural eyes put out but it was his spiritual side put out that he let Delilah woo him into it and that's what's hindered the church today is the spiritual Insight of the word of God has been swapped for a bunch of creeds that's the odd the devil is first thing he can do is put your eyes up tell you it's a bunch of Holy Rollers tell you it's this side or the other or some Devil's move or it's a mental telepathy or something on that order if he can punch your eyes out you're in darkness the Lord is Samson's first plea in his prayer Lord that I might have binged my two eyes he knew there's where his trouble come notice his locks had grown out but he was blind he'd have to stagger all the rest of his days he was blind we may have as big a Machinery as we ever had as many members but what good does it do if you're blind to the very thing that's going on in front of and you can't see it what's happening right here day by day along with the people of the Holy Spirit revealing himself and people don't see it that's blind spiritual blind they stood and watched Jesus perform Miracles and so forth and declare himself to be the Messiah and they couldn't see it he said they got us but they can't see they were blind and Samson was blind but here's what Samson recognized that the church has never come to you yet he knew there was a possibility of coming back again if the church could only know that a possibility but the people of the day don't seem to catch the vision yet they don't seem to catch it that there is a possibility it doesn't come through you shout a little more Pat your hands a little more or dance a little more that isn't it no it's back to the word there's a possibility of coming back and getting the word on the inside again you bypassed it there notice they sit tight oh sure clap their hands yes sir but you see that's all sales without any anchor I've seen the heathens clapped their hands do a dance speak in tongues and do all those things and interpret it but they were African heathens sure I see them lay a pencil down and that Witch Doctor stood there and made that pencil stand up and it went up and down on a place up there and come back and played like shaved a Haircut Two Bits and draw out an unknown tongue and wrote it out and one of them stood there interpreted him oh my God you can't rely on that many of them speak in tongues and they deny the very principles of Jesus Christ I've took my Bible laid it right out to me and him standing there speaking in tongues and I said brother this is exactly I don't even want to see a glory to God I don't know what Jesus said I don't care about the rest of it Hallelujah glory to God like that why a man that would turn his back upon truth and actually put on a shindig like that to keep from seeing the truth that's hypocrisy and the heights of it just because he'd have to give up his Fellowship card if he accepted what was truth that's worse than Samson notice but they didn't catch it they set tight now oh sure we have great getting togethers meetings we call it worldly uh revivals and so forth all full of tinsel not sure great big things and great advertisement a man with the message of the hour and so and so and so and so we have all of that but where's God that's the thing we're looking for where it's gone a great big piece of scholarly Showmanship somebody with enough education that wouldn't uh use the word uh half the people could understand what he was saying and yet he's got an honorary degree and a degree and a degree and a degree and he can lectionary and put the words together and stand so perfectly straight and say ah man just exactly right and turn like a military man walk off the platform but where is God Samson had stood in that place one time himself and knowed the power of God but now he had been shaving of those privileges he was just as big as he ever was but God wasn't there we got a lot of that today it's too bad that we have it but we have it now we notice but it don't bring back the spirit of God now the thing of it is the people are not willing to pay the price to get back to that I believe that God just Remains the Same as he ever was but the thing of it is that people has got so wound up into the world and the world in them so they just got just enough religion to make them miserable not enough to really turn loose to God and give your whole heart into him now I'll go to church certainly I enjoy good singing clapping hands yeah I love that see but when he comes right down to putting what you say you believe into practice and wouldn't you confess the wrong they don't do it it just isn't there they don't have it well that's real conviction that's what we need we've long left that a long time ago it has swapped it prayer and and confession and conviction we swapped it for emotion a shaken or a jerking or jumping up and down that's the reason there's no holding tight because there's nothing there to hold them until you come up on the basis of God's word of Godly sorrow ready to repent and make anything right and do what's right ready to live right I don't care what the people say or anything else you live for yours for Jesus Christ and what he said then you take a church like that coming back there's a possibility of it coming but they're not willing to do it Sampson prayed a lot right Lord let me die with this listings oh my see let's go to costume what if God answers his prayer let me down oh I like that was it Patrick Henry said Give me liberty give me that John all right that's it Liberty or death it's back to God or our death what are we going to do what are we mimicking what are we trying to play Christianity if the Holy Ghost is still the holy ghost that fell at Pentecost it still does the same things it did then the same power The Same Spirit it'll work the same way we don't need a council of churches we need the Bible back in action it's exactly now we find out that Sampson prayed right Lord let me die with the Enemy die to the enemy that got him in that way if there's anything that people ought to pray for tonight and we see the thing that's done this is getting away from the Bible to a Creed then die with the things get out get out of it to it Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God back again there's a price to be paid for it but uh today the people don't seem to all we hear Revival sure yes we have a denominational Revival get more members in and things like that but look at the morals it's constantly decaying look how further and further away from God they're getting all the time getting away from the word and now when they go in and come into the Council of churches while they'd accepted the biggest killer that the church word has got the word that God left to him they bypass all of that you can't teach that Bible you got to teach their Creed there it is Samson know one thing and I wonder if the church realizes today he knew that his back-slidden condition couldn't meet the challenge of the hour and I know today that the backslidden condition of the church can't meet the challenge of this hour and it's going to be worse the Bible said as janvis and jambers withstood Moses so will they never reprobate mine concerning the faith they can almost impersonate it exactly Moses went out with a his command from God with a stick in his hand and God said do this sign before them if they won't listen to that then do this sign before them and if you won't listen to that then I'll be with you I'll take care of the rest of it well Moses went down with his first sign and as soon as he performed his first sign there's impersonators everywhere doing the same thing but Moses never fussed about it he just stood still for he knew that it was God that sent him we're going to have that repeat again in the last days remember and our backslidden state now will not meet the challenge of the hour yet all the big frames here there's more Pentecostals in the world today than there ever was if we know of them more Pentecostal Believers that's right you know what a Sunday visitor the Catholic paper Sunday paper called the Sunday visitor I believe about two years ago made some kind of a statement like this he said the fastest growing Church in the world is the Pentecostals so last year the Catholic Church uh recorded a million conversions to Catholicism but said the that's all Catholicism but said the Pentecostal Church alone in itself recorded one million five hundred thousand now the frame is there but we don't have the power we had when we were a handful all the Samson's big books stood there but where was the power of the Lord yes the denominational system don't vindicate the word of the Lord that's right now notice I was talking to a priest that lives out the lane from me the Sacred Heart Church about a month ago since this new issues come on the Lutheran preacher had the priest of the Catholic Church Sacred Heart Church up to preaching his Pulpit for him and the the Catholic priest had the Lutheran Minister down the same ass for him swapping Pulpit big piece of paper sure oh my if anybody could see that and not if you can't understand that well you're you're certainly scripturally blind yes I've talked to this priest and he said to me he said the I want to talk to you uh Miss Brandon I said all right and he said did you baptize uh this uh Fraser girl the name of Mary Elizabeth Frazier I said yes sir I did he said the bishop wants your signed statement about it I said I understand that she turned Catholic he said yes that she'd come back to the mother Church and I said yes sir I said her mother was telling me about said yes her mother didn't take it too well I said her mother told me she'd rather walk with her to the Grave and I said frankly that's what she's doing and so he said um he said I want you to sign this statement said did you baptize her uh how did you baptize her I said a Christian baptism and he said I mean how sir did you uh sprinkler poor or immerse her I said Christian baptism is immersing uh-huh so all right so now you a you immersed her then in the name of the father son Holy Ghost I said yes sir that's Jesus Christ that's the name of the father son Holy Ghost that's why I baptized and uh he said you baptized her in the name of the father son oh God says yes sir I never called them words now I baptize her in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost which is Jesus Christ he said yes sir I see and he put it down like that he said you know that's the way uh uh the early Catholic Church baptized him I said oh is that right and he said yeah that's where I said what happened he did run well and he said well he said you see said said you believe a Bible God is in his church I said God is in his word sir his word I said did you say Peter was the first pope he said he was well I said then if the Catholic church has to say all of its masses and and Latin and so forth where it won't change then what did the first pope said in Acts 2 38 where he said repent be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sins he said if you I said on this confession and so forth I said he said well didn't Jesus tell his disciples whosoever sins you remit to them they're remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they're retained I said he did then what's wrong with that your very Bible tells you that I said then if you'll remit sins the way that they remitted them I'll go with him so as Peter was asked someone that had the keys what must we do to be saved he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ oh you do it like that and I'll go with you hey man that's the word that's God's way of doing a weaken on him that's he said brother uh when I come to argue with you I said who was arguing I said I never I'm not arguing I you just asked me a question now I answered it the best of the Lord how I said I'm going to ask you one I said you said that the that God was with the church and now I'm going to give you the benefit of telling you the first Christians if you want to call them Catholic all right Peter James John Mark Loop and all them they yes I said then in following the order of the Bible that these Apostles wrote now you mean today that you're a diocese now is so much greater than it was than you no more wisdom and you know how to take care of the yes sir that's exactly right I said then why was it that when they followed the commandments of Jesus Christ they raised the dead they cast out Devils they've done all kinds of signs and wonders and you don't do it today now what's wrong if the church was better in the Lutheran age or the Western age or any other age than it was back there why didn't they do the works of them then certainly back to the word Samson stood there stripped of his power but you know there was something I want to hurry the Philistines didn't notice while Samson is down there thinking all this over I wished I could take the Pentecostal world and back them up in a corner somewhere let them think like that for a while just think these reasonable things where are we now with our great big book of organization everyone against the other one the Oneness against the Tunis the two-ness against the threeness and so forth all yes that's the way it is it shouldn't be that way shouldn't be that way we should come back and come together and settle it up on the basis of thus saith the Lord what's the matter with the prophets in the church the word of the Lord's supposed to come to the prophets if a prophet that claims to be a prophet and will deny this truth in the Bible according to the word he's not a prophet now we're supposed to have these gifts to set us an order keep us in order but somehow another we got away from it all and they stand backed in the corner and you're stood Samson standing in the corner thinking of all that had been and these Philistines stand out there with their arms around these women looking down belching and drunk and celebrating the victory over Jehovah servant oh my don't let that just send something through you to think of that a victory over Jehovah's plan yes standing there with a fish God Dagan was a fish God and there was burning sacrifice human lives were taken a little child had to die for the sacrifice run a sword through it this heart for the sacrifice and there they were having this big celebration over the victory over Jehovah and the church side like a bunch of Philistines is growth and over the idea that a council of churches after a while will shut out every church that don't belong to it Samson don't never Bob your hair stay right with that word I don't care what happens you stay right there that word don't get mixed up in that Samson began to think wonder if there's a possibility now I said I know my hair's got out but I'm blind there could be a possibility of another Revival there's a possibility he said to the little boy [Music] um uh pop my hands up on the post is he's the post that the whole building's passing on yes and you say all the kings and celebrities up on top yes I'm tired uh you've had to do made me do so many tricks and things well you just put my hands up on the post and he put his hands up on the post and stood in between him maybe like in this order and he stood there in his hands against the post the Philistines celebrating and having such a big time they forgot to watch him oh my God but he began to think God's still God I know he is I've tried him I put him to the test I know He Still Remains God it's me that's wrong I'm the one that sinned they didn't notice the tears running out of that blinded sockets dripping out off of his chin they noticed his lips are moving Lord I've done wrong let me die with the Philistines he wanted God's word manifested before that Jezebel more than he wanted his own life all that desire to come to the church again he wasn't praying for new order new denomination but that the word of God might be made known again the promise that he once had might come back to him again he was aware of what would happen if his prayer was answered but he was ready and in a dead Earnest or if the church could only get like that then he cried out slowly he was praying it's possible Lord it is possible to stand here all my big frames still together I'm here my hairs go down but I couldn't see how to whip him no more because my eyes is blind I couldn't see where I was going but it's possibly that you let it happen again Lord to show your power he screamed out once more Lord just want some more or the church could only cry that once more Lord let us see your power once more and as he cried and asked God I can see them muscles begin to swell ever fiber in his body begin to twist the Holy Ghost is coming up on me man stretch forth his hands again with the power of the Holy Ghost upon him down with the building the Bible said he killed more that day than he did all the rest of his days he fulfilled a commission God gave him then once more it's always been that way when the power of God comes the big structures of ism's fall Samson's greatest victory over his enemy was at his end times now let me say this just in closing Pentecost can we stand at the post of these big organizations can we stand at the post of Hollywood and all these other things that separate us from the love of God that's in Christ and can we stand there and repent and cry aloud again Lord once more make us Pentecost once more Lord once more make us Pentacles once more show your power unto us Lord just once more listen destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you 'll do it bring back the old-fashioned meetings and the thing and oh leave Delilah alone leave the world alone that thing that Woos you off into little things that you shouldn't little things troubles come up in the church and you won't stay in correction because you don't have to you could drop off to another church and things like that in the early days when a man didn't cope up with the word of God they packed him out dead bring us back to Pentecost not Hollywood Showmanship but a wholehearted turn to God is what we need once more oh Lord once more if I could see that happen if my old weakening eyes could look again and see that church forget its differences if I could see that denominational system break down their throat right into the lap of the council and say we want nothing to do it we'll not far for our birthrights if I could see the Trinity and Oneness and all of them get together and say brethren look back to where we left him off at let's go back to where we started fussing one another at right back up on the subject of water baptism and come right back and take the Bible Way part and then cry once more Lord once more and get all of this Showmanship and a lot of these fellas up on the platform in the knows some more about God than a rabbit does about snowshoes and these women with dresses so tight to their skins on the outside walking up and down a platform clapping their hands and jumping around like that like a bunch of show or something other God bring us back to the Holy Ghost in power in the manifestation of the word once more Lord once more be a believer Lord God once more once more let me see the presence of Jesus Christ walking through the church let me see his power and his promise made manifest before us once more Lord once more God be merciful help us see what these other things gets us it kills a very uh it drives away the nature of Christ out of the congregation out of the out of the church out away from the people we should be so woven together that there be nothing separate us from this word and our love for one another Jesus Christ is here he's our father he's our mother he's my healer he he's my king he's my God he's my alive he's my joy he's my peace oh that there is he is for me he's My All In All he's here now he wants to bring the church back to that place wonder if we could cry once more Lord and let the the tears of repentance drop from our blinded sockets I'm not exactly talking to this church this is tape you see here this go around the world let our let our people come back to that again let it come back to a place where we could call back a meeting like we used to have just even take 10 or 15 years back look how it's declined since then look how it's went down down down it's got so it's almost a shame of fellow feels embarrassed almost to talk about Divine Healing you've been so much reproach brought upon him talk about the Holy Ghost when so much reproach has been brought upon him that's right it's not God's fault it's a Samson that has left all the principles of God's word and has substituted something else and let the organization shade him down moving into it I say to you my brother sister if I never seen or this side of the of the great judgment bar of God Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever his word to me is life he's here now you believe that I know you sure and the only thing you have to do to know and share is get yourself out of the way as long as you're in the way then God cannot do nothing for you when you think your thoughts then God's thoughts don't have a chance but if you quit thinking your thoughts and think his thoughts my thoughts is not your thoughts he said if there'd be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things not what some church is going to say about it but what God said about it like this little lady laying here shaking and this God that woman's gonna lay like that all of her life unless she can get her her face set right straight on Jesus Christ and no matter what comes or goes if he revealed to her then there's nothing going to stop the healing that's right but when you get your depends on what you're thinking about if you just believe and have faith God can do anything for you and the greatest thing he can do for you tonight is sweep your soul right back into the presence of his being right back there to where every person in here just think what if the Holy Ghost had everybody in here completely in his control think of what would take place today think what would take place in Shreveport by this time tomorrow night they have headlines everywhere a bunch of people went crazy they were Healing The Sick and raising the dead and doing all kinds of things down in Shreveport Louisiana United States USA that have it on television or whatever's doing if the Holy Ghost could take completely control why don't he he wants to he's willing to he's waiting well you say I've asked him so many things I just hate to ask him too much ask the abundance that your Joys might be full could you imagine a little fish a half inch long out in the middle of the Pacific sand I better drink of this water sparingly I might run out someday could you think of a little mouse about that vegan the great Garners of Egypt think I allowance myself to one grain a day of course I might run out for the next Harvest comes in oh no now divide that by 100 billion and that's how easy you can exhaust
