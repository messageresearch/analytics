[34:43] lord we haven't come to hear from a man
[34:45] or a man's ideas but oh god you've just
[34:47] given a five-fold ministry within your
[34:49] body oh god just to bring forth your
[34:51] thoughts lord your expectations your
[34:53] desires to the people o lord
[34:55] and we've come an earnest expectation
[34:56] lord to hear from you this evening
[34:58] may you just move me out of the way lord
[35:00] may your holy ghost have complete
[35:02] preeminence in the service
[35:04] may you speak to the hearts of your
[35:06] children oh god we've come lord
[35:08] seeking lord bread from the from the
[35:10] master's table oh god we've come to
[35:12] to be fed lord jesus to receive strength
[35:15] and to receive
[35:16] courage in the hour lord that you've
[35:18] brought forth lord a word in this age to
[35:20] bring us to perfection oh god to bring
[35:22] us to a rapture lord
[35:23] and lord we just come here lord to hear
[35:25] from you we asked lord that
[35:27] any any spirit lord that would try to
[35:29] hinder we bind in the name of jesus
[35:31] and we place it under our feet oh god
[35:33] lord you told us that
[35:35] we wherever we the souls of our food
[35:37] would tread oh god that would be
[35:38] that footstep would be a possession lord
[35:40] and we're stepping right now into the
[35:42] word oh god to
[35:43] hear from you and to take hold of the
[35:45] things that you promised this father
[35:47] we just ask that your perfect will and
[35:49] way would be done this evening lord in
[35:50] the name of jesus christ we pray
[35:52] amen amen you may be seated
[35:59] by the grace of the lord you know where
[36:02] you just pray for me thoughts have just
[36:04] kind of been you know how the devil just
[36:05] likes to attack the
[36:07] you know during the day here today my
[36:10] wife was walking the dog and then
[36:12] the dog broke one of her claws off
[36:14] almost and so
[36:16] she was bleeding everywhere and one
[36:17] weren't sure what to do so we had to
[36:18] take her
[36:20] lindsay took the dog to the vet and by
[36:22] the grace of the lord everything's okay
[36:23] but
[36:24] you know just lots of little things you
[36:25] know how the devil fights and and how he
[36:27] does things but
[36:28] we're gonna we're pressing forward
[36:30] anyhow
[36:32] and i guess just if i had to give a
[36:34] title to the sermon tonight
[36:36] i just want to speak about the true
[36:40] worshipers
[36:42] you know i i was just i really been kind
[36:44] of dwelling on that word and the
[36:46] the word worship and you know i feel
[36:49] like so many times
[36:51] you know in our minds we put our own
[36:53] definitions to what the word worship
[36:55] means you know i think
[36:56] we we oftentimes we limit that that idea
[36:59] of worship to
[37:00] we come and sing songs into the lord
[37:02] we've come into the house of worship
[37:04] to worship the lord this evening and
[37:06] we're singing songs to worship god and
[37:09] the lord just really impressed it upon
[37:11] my heart in light of the things that
[37:12] have been being ministered lately
[37:14] how worship is so much more than just an
[37:18] expression of our mouth
[37:20] worship is so much more than just
[37:22] something that we just speak or that we
[37:24] say we come and we sing a song oh that's
[37:26] you know we call it praise and worship
[37:28] and and no doubt that that is true to a
[37:29] certain extent
[37:31] but true worship as we
[37:34] hear in the in john true worship the
[37:37] worshiping in spirit and in truth it it
[37:40] goes so much
[37:41] deeper than than just oh we'll sing a
[37:44] song into the lord
[37:45] oh we're gonna we're gonna come and
[37:47] bring our tithes and our offerings as a
[37:48] form of worship it goes
[37:50] so far beyond just a a
[37:53] a framework of a church in the sense of
[37:56] a building or a framework of a
[37:58] of a congregational assembly but a
[38:00] worship
[38:01] is is an everyday experience
[38:05] with god true worship worshiping in
[38:09] spirit and in truth is a is a
[38:12] sacrifice that goes beyond just uh just
[38:15] a
[38:15] sacrifice of praise from thanksgiving of
[38:18] your mouth although that's part of it
[38:20] it goes beyond the the idea of
[38:23] just maybe a testimony here a testimony
[38:25] there
[38:26] but but a real worship you know when we
[38:29] look at the old testament and we think
[38:30] about how
[38:31] god established the tabernacle in the
[38:34] wilderness
[38:35] as a place he said i would i would i
[38:37] would bring a place and out there i
[38:39] would put my name and there you would
[38:41] worship me
[38:42] and and to that day to the children of
[38:44] israel the tabernacle in the wilderness
[38:46] god had established a place for the
[38:49] children
[38:49] of god the children of israel to bring
[38:51] their sacrifices into
[38:53] to to do worship to show their desire
[38:57] to express their love for god to express
[39:01] their their desire to great jehovah to
[39:03] say lord this is
[39:04] this and we want to show you lord that
[39:07] we desire to serve you
[39:09] that we desire to give something unto
[39:11] you in there
[39:12] they brought their their sacrifices
[39:14] their turtle doves and
[39:15] and their wave offerings and their burnt
[39:17] offerings and their drink offerings and
[39:19] all the different ones
[39:21] you could go through the book in in
[39:22] exodus in leviticus
[39:24] deuteronomy and see all the sacrifices
[39:27] that they would give
[39:28] as a form of worship and yet all those
[39:32] things
[39:32] were merely just types just just
[39:35] shadows and types of what god was truly
[39:39] desiring
[39:40] and we find that no matter what all of
[39:43] their offerings all of their sacrifices
[39:45] i believe that's our brother
[39:46] moses began to minister and how he
[39:48] talked about how those things what do
[39:50] they become unto god they became a
[39:52] stench in his nostrils
[39:54] because he wasn't just desiring an
[39:56] outward work
[39:58] in so much it's longer to bring the
[39:59] sacrifice oh every year we're going to
[40:01] bring this block
[40:02] and we're going to offer it up on the
[40:03] altar every year we're going to go and
[40:05] we're going to do this for the atonement
[40:07] no but he was desiring something deeper
[40:10] from his people
[40:11] he was desiring that true sincere
[40:14] worship as we're talking about here in
[40:17] the book of john
[40:18] it he seeketh those to worship him
[40:22] the father seeketh such to worship him
[40:26] and now i want to bring it maybe to to
[40:28] right now because i believe
[40:29] he's found such to worship him
[40:33] you how many are that one that he's
[40:35] found he sought you out
[40:38] to worship him in spirit and in truth he
[40:41] says the father
[40:42] seeketh such he's constantly seeking and
[40:45] he's found such
[40:46] this evening he's found a pride he's
[40:49] found
[40:50] the ones that he's called and brought
[40:52] unto himself
[40:53] you this evening i believe in the house
[40:56] of god
[40:57] us being here to worship him in spirit
[41:01] and in truth but it goes beyond
[41:06] just coming to church and presenting
[41:08] yourself in a pew
[41:10] and say well i've i've sacrificed my
[41:13] three to
[41:14] five hours a week of going to a few
[41:16] church services
[41:18] it goes it's going the lord is calling
[41:20] us to go beyond
[41:22] i believe i just felt such a cry from
[41:25] the
[41:25] the ministry and what the lord's
[41:27] bringing forth here
[41:29] that it's going beyond just coming
[41:31] underneath the umbrella of a message
[41:34] and it's time to bring it from
[41:37] underneath
[41:38] where we're at now to expressing a
[41:40] worship
[41:42] outside of these walls every day
[41:46] becomes a worship unto the lord jesus
[41:50] he's seeking those to worship him he's
[41:54] found those that would worship in spirit
[41:57] and in truth we've received a truth
[42:01] in this hour we've received a message
[42:06] a key as it were to unlock the truth
[42:09] that was in god's word the whole time
[42:12] we've received the holy ghost
[42:14] a holy spirit that can say amen
[42:18] to every word that was revealed in this
[42:20] hour
[42:22] but now he's calling for worship now
[42:25] he's calling for a true worship
[42:27] he's calling for something just a little
[42:29] bit greater
[42:31] thank you brother he's calling
[42:35] for an everyday worship
[42:39] see it used to be
[42:43] that they would come once a year into
[42:44] the holy holies
[42:46] to bring forth a sacrifice to bring
[42:48] forth an atonement
[42:51] that was their worship they were limited
[42:54] in what they could perform why because
[42:57] the shadows and types expressing
[42:59] the lord's showing through a law and we
[43:01] understand how
[43:03] how the shadow of the law proving to man
[43:07] that without a perfect sacrifice they
[43:09] couldn't even approach unto god
[43:13] only once a year could they do it but in
[43:16] this days
[43:18] through the lord jesus he's given us
[43:21] an opportunity and i say beyond an
[43:24] opportunity if we claim to be
[43:27] and we are the bride of christ it's
[43:29] beyond an opportunity
[43:31] but it's an obligation
[43:34] to come into the presence of god
[43:38] not just once many of us have
[43:41] experienced
[43:43] the holy ghost to fill you
[43:47] to bring you into a revelation to bring
[43:50] you
[43:51] to the recognition of jesus christ in
[43:54] you
[43:56] but it's got to go beyond just a
[43:58] one-time
[43:59] thing it's it comes to an
[44:03] every day i'm talking about an everyday
[44:05] walking
[44:07] why because if we're our goal is a
[44:09] rapture
[44:11] we've been given this goal this promise
[44:15] and we see very little
[44:18] in the way of direct connections
[44:22] but you know to the natural mind i could
[44:25] say
[44:26] but one thing i know about enoch
[44:29] who took a rapture is it says he walked
[44:33] with god and what was that walking with
[44:36] god
[44:37] that is a worship a true worship
[44:41] in spirit and in truth every day
[44:45] and it's not just relying you say oh
[44:47] brother
[44:48] we can't do it ourselves that's the
[44:50] point
[44:52] that's the point brothers and sisters
[44:54] we've been hearing from this pulpit over
[44:56] the last month and a half
[44:57] since this new year has started like
[44:59] it's just a month now
[45:01] i'm bringing that faith and trying to
[45:04] really
[45:05] step out into the word of god
[45:09] you know i i was thinking about it this
[45:11] afternoon and i thought
[45:13] you know the devil we talk oh we're
[45:15] moving past pentecost oh that's true as
[45:17] far as that pentecost is concerned
[45:20] the 1906 pentecost or whatever year it
[45:22] was we've moved past that
[45:24] why because they moved into fanaticism
[45:27] we're moving into the word but we
[45:31] but the devil has put up so many
[45:32] scarecrows
[45:34] when it comes to the power of god
[45:37] he's put up so many scarecrows of
[45:40] fanaticism and
[45:41] and just running after any little thing
[45:45] but
[45:46] the thing about the bride is she doesn't
[45:48] run after every little thing
[45:50] she stays right with this word
[45:53] but it almost seems as though the devil
[45:56] with all the scarecrows
[45:58] has caused us just to buckle it up and
[45:59] hold it to ourselves
[46:03] the power of god hasn't changed but i
[46:07] wonder if
[46:07] our faith in that power of god
[46:11] has just waned just enough by all the
[46:13] scarecrows out there
[46:16] we've seen all the false
[46:19] everywhere you look is a false one oh i
[46:21] got this
[46:22] oh i got that and you could see just
[46:25] even through the by the revelation he's
[46:28] given us
[46:29] you can listen to a preacher and you
[46:31] could see
[46:32] within just a couple minutes whether or
[46:34] not they truly believe the word of god
[46:38] because you'll see it in the way they
[46:39] approach the word
[46:41] is it just their opinion on it or is
[46:43] this everything to them
[46:45] is this the only thing to them but see
[46:48] the problem is
[46:49] all the ones that had little pieces here
[46:52] and a piece there
[46:53] they ran off in all the different
[46:55] directions
[46:57] and and and so many times we just sit
[46:59] there and oh i don't want to venture out
[47:01] because i don't want to look
[47:02] like a fanatic i don't want to look
[47:05] like i'm going to be a little too
[47:07] overboard with it
[47:09] you know you want to know something the
[47:10] lord really been pressing on my heart
[47:13] is humility the idea of humility i was
[47:16] looking up that word in humility it says
[47:18] humility
[47:19] is a person not thinking basic i'm
[47:22] paraphrasing in the way the dictionary
[47:24] says it but humility is not thinking
[47:26] much of oneself
[47:30] i think too many times we think too much
[47:32] of ourselves
[47:33] and the right the way i the reason i say
[47:35] that is you know we all desire humility
[47:39] amen he's called us to humility
[47:42] meek and lowly but you know the lord
[47:46] really
[47:46] told me i just the lord spoke to me said
[47:48] how do you get humility
[47:51] humiliation brings humility
[47:56] you know you know you know one of the
[47:58] reasons why we're not willing to step
[47:59] out in faith because we're not willing
[48:00] to be humiliated
[48:02] for the word of god you know who once
[48:05] humiliated jesus christ
[48:08] when they stripped him naked beat him to
[48:10] a bloody pulp
[48:12] all of his bones stared at him and put
[48:14] him up at a cross
[48:17] all that shame that he had to bear for
[48:19] you all that shame he bore for me
[48:22] you know the scripture didn't say he
[48:24] liked it the scripture said he despised
[48:26] the shame
[48:27] and so many times
[48:30] we're not willing to go where he went
[48:32] even in a little thing
[48:34] to step out of the ledge
[48:37] and say lord i don't care if it looks
[48:41] like a shame
[48:42] i'm taking you at your word
[48:47] god just like brother matthew said i
[48:48] pray for a thousand people if they
[48:50] didn't get healed that's not my business
[48:53] god backs up his word amen i can't do it
[48:56] anyway
[48:57] what did brother branham say when he'd
[48:59] be on the platform all the time
[49:01] he said brother if i could do something
[49:03] for you i'd be a hypocrite if i didn't
[49:05] but i can't so i'll do the one thing i
[49:08] can do
[49:09] and we'll go to him who can do something
[49:11] about it
[49:12] [Applause]
[49:14] what was it he wasn't leaning on his own
[49:16] strength
[49:18] he only leaned upon the truth
[49:22] you shall lay hands on the sick and
[49:24] they
[49:25] shall recover that's not an if and or
[49:28] maybe
[49:30] it will come to pass what see
[49:34] but so like i love the way brother
[49:36] matthew put it we're not willing to
[49:37] sometimes jump out there
[49:39] you know we've got the answer to the
[49:42] question
[49:43] it's the question that nobody wants to
[49:45] verbalize in this age
[49:47] because they're all looking to fill that
[49:49] with something else they'll fill
[49:51] that hole with anything else but with
[49:54] god
[49:55] anything else but the word anything else
[49:57] but the lord jesus
[50:00] they won't ask the question where can i
[50:03] go to be saved
[50:05] they're asking it but maybe not verbally
[50:08] but we've got the answer you have the
[50:11] answer
[50:14] it's up to god to back up the answer
[50:17] it's not up to you
[50:19] it's not up to me i can only step
[50:22] in this word where he tells me to go
[50:27] he'd say well what if i don't what if i
[50:29] pray for me they don't get healed
[50:30] well that's not the question
[50:34] the question is if it doesn't happen the
[50:36] way they think are you willing to be
[50:38] humiliated for the gospel see we put
[50:41] humiliation oh it means something bad
[50:42] happened no it doesn't mean something
[50:43] bad happened
[50:46] jesus christ was humiliated on the cross
[50:49] the greatest thing that ever happened
[50:53] said blessed are you when you suffer
[50:55] reproach for my sake
[50:58] say well lord i i what if i pray for him
[51:02] and it doesn't happen it's not
[51:04] about that
[51:07] god's calling for courage in this hour
[51:11] he's calling for us to set aside the
[51:13] cowardly ways
[51:17] and finally take god and say lord you
[51:19] know what i have no idea
[51:21] how this is going to work the only thing
[51:23] i know
[51:24] is that you said it the only thing i
[51:27] know
[51:28] is that you promised it to happen you
[51:31] promised
[51:33] that if i laid hands on the sick they
[51:35] would recover you promised
[51:37] that whatsoever i ask in your name if i
[51:40] believe
[51:41] i shall receive
[51:44] amen and the devil's going to be there
[51:47] with every excuse
[51:48] that's fine because i'm not relying upon
[51:51] myself
[51:52] we have to go back to the childlike
[51:55] faith
[51:57] that childlike faith when when when you
[51:59] were a little child
[52:01] and your mother or father said something
[52:03] you just didn't question it because
[52:05] that that's all you knew when you were
[52:07] that little when you were that little
[52:09] and that and that mom that mama said
[52:11] it's going to be okay well you didn't
[52:12] worry about it
[52:14] mama knew better why because she
[52:17] compared to you as a little child she
[52:19] was god
[52:20] in that sense she knew everything that
[52:23] you didn't know
[52:24] she knew what was coming down the line
[52:27] so she could comfort you and say don't
[52:28] worry it's going to be okay
[52:30] and that little child with that child
[52:31] like faith could rest in those words
[52:34] why because mama knows
[52:38] how much more our heavenly father
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] whose ways are above our ways whose
[52:45] thoughts are above our thoughts
[52:47] who said all my thoughts i have towards
[52:49] you are good
[52:51] when he tells you just take me at my
[52:53] word
[52:55] could we be like the little child and
[52:58] just say yes papa
[53:00] yes but i'll rest in that
[53:04] oh you have the answer to the question
[53:09] when someone needs deliverance
[53:13] you've got the answer to the question
[53:16] because jesus christ breaks every chain
[53:22] he's a deliverer he's the mighty
[53:25] conqueror
[53:26] all you got to do is be willing to step
[53:28] out on it
[53:31] you know the scripture let's turn let's
[53:33] turn to matthew 7.
[53:37] i'm talking about true worship the lord
[53:40] seeking
[53:40] true worshipers
[53:46] matthew chapter 7 start at verse 21.
[53:58] here's the difference between
[54:01] a true and false worshiper not everyone
[54:04] that saith unto me lord lord
[54:06] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[54:10] but he that doeth the will of my father
[54:14] which is in heaven many was saying to me
[54:18] will say to me in that day lord lord
[54:19] have we not prophesied in thy name
[54:21] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[54:24] in thy name done many wonderful works
[54:26] and then i will well i profess unto them
[54:28] i never knew you'd depart from me ye
[54:29] that work iniquity
[54:32] so there's some of the scarecrows the
[54:34] devil's putting up
[54:35] haven't we done he never said that they
[54:37] didn't do those things
[54:40] but just like he had to tell the
[54:41] pharisees he said
[54:44] you did the one but you left the other
[54:45] undone
[54:48] oh yeah you had enough faith to have
[54:51] your big pentecostal conventions
[54:53] and run around and dance and scream and
[54:55] shout and maybe you saw a little
[54:56] something happen here and there
[54:59] but then when it came to matthew 28 19
[55:01] acts 2 38 you said oh i just can't
[55:03] believe it that way
[55:06] but then when it came to the serpent
[55:07] scene you say oh that just sounds crazy
[55:10] even though it's genesis to revelation
[55:14] it's right in the word
[55:17] oh you said god can still send prophets
[55:20] in this day i just don't
[55:21] believe it unless it's our brother
[55:22] prophet over here that we believe
[55:25] but so what was it they left they took
[55:28] one and they left the other
[55:31] they could give spirit but no truth
[55:35] we have truth in the spirit
[55:39] i believe that but it does no good
[55:42] unless it's activated
[55:45] and god's wanting you to do it
[55:50] he had didn't he have to tell the
[55:51] prophet that how the prophet relied on
[55:54] vision so much
[55:55] and the lord had to tell him so you need
[55:58] to go out on faith
[56:00] i give you vision so much that
[56:03] you just don't even have you barely even
[56:05] have the faith that you should have
[56:07] in the things that are just in the word
[56:09] because you always want me to show it to
[56:10] you
[56:12] so are we lord show me a sign
[56:16] lord show me this he says i did
[56:20] you got the last sign you got a prophet
[56:23] in this day
[56:25] and what did the prophet point to what
[56:27] did the sign point to
[56:29] it pointed back to the word
[56:35] that's the formula that's where the true
[56:38] worshiper goes
[56:41] now listen in verse 24 matthew 7
[56:45] therefore whosoever hear these sayings
[56:49] of mine and do with them
[56:51] i just the way the lord i was reading
[56:53] this the other day and i just
[56:55] the lord helped me see it just in a new
[56:57] you know you read a scripture and then
[56:58] the lord helps you see it in a new light
[57:01] now i want you to listen what he's
[57:02] saying here whoever heareth these
[57:05] sayings of mine
[57:06] and do with them i will liken him unto a
[57:09] wise man
[57:10] which built his house upon a rock
[57:14] so i want you to think about it what is
[57:17] he equating here
[57:19] he says if you hear these sayings and do
[57:23] them
[57:24] what is that you're building your house
[57:28] on a rock so we know what the rock is
[57:30] it's his word
[57:31] it's a revelation of who he is it's his
[57:33] word
[57:35] so what is it how are you building a
[57:37] house on that rock
[57:39] by just doing what he said
[57:43] that's as simple as it is
[57:46] we make it so complicated we make it so
[57:50] complicated
[57:51] to fulfill the will of god but the will
[57:55] of god
[57:56] is his word
[57:59] and that's why i'm so appreciated the
[58:02] direction that brother david's been
[58:04] going
[58:05] because it's just as simple as if i see
[58:08] it in the scripture i can walk in that
[58:12] where else do you have to turn
[58:15] that's where the true worshipers go
[58:23] and then and the rain descended and the
[58:24] floods came and the winds blew
[58:26] and beat upon that house and it fell not
[58:29] for it is founded
[58:30] upon a rock and everyone that heared
[58:34] these sayings of mine
[58:35] and doeth them not shall be likened unto
[58:38] a foolish man which built his house upon
[58:40] the sand
[58:42] so what is it he's heard it but there's
[58:45] no doing
[58:46] so there's no rock
[58:49] now i want you to notice no matter which
[58:52] man this was
[58:54] what's the same the rain descended
[58:58] and the floods came and the winds blew
[59:01] and they beat upon that house so
[59:04] you no matter which way you go
[59:07] the rains are coming the floods are
[59:10] coming
[59:12] the rains and winds and everything are
[59:14] going to beat upon the house
[59:17] the only difference is gonna be where
[59:20] are you building the house
[59:24] are we just are we just coming up with
[59:26] our own ideas
[59:28] are we just hiding our light under a
[59:30] bushel
[59:32] no because that's not the word
[59:35] that's not what he said to do he said
[59:38] no man light of the candle and put it
[59:40] under a bushel but he put it that said
[59:42] it's on high so it can be seen by all
[59:44] so let your light shine so what is he
[59:48] calling us to
[59:49] simply fulfill his word let your light
[59:52] shine
[59:53] that's where the worship is is it
[59:56] fulfilling his word for you
[1:00:01] now you know when it comes to the exact
[1:00:04] calling you have what job it may be and
[1:00:06] those
[1:00:06] that's between you and the lord the lord
[1:00:08] will put you where you need
[1:00:10] but these things are just basic
[1:00:13] principles
[1:00:15] and if we would just see the lord says
[1:00:17] if you'll be faithful and little you'll
[1:00:19] be faithful in much
[1:00:21] so if we want to achieve the greater
[1:00:23] things
[1:00:24] we want to see the greater works we want
[1:00:26] to see a greater walk with him
[1:00:28] then all we can do is fulfill the little
[1:00:31] things he's called us to
[1:00:34] that's the true worship why because a
[1:00:36] worship
[1:00:38] requires a sacrifice worship requires
[1:00:42] a laying down of something before the
[1:00:44] altar
[1:00:45] that's why he could say in the book of
[1:00:47] romans he says
[1:00:49] give yourselves a living sacrifice
[1:00:52] what did he call he said it's your
[1:00:53] reasonable service
[1:00:56] that's the requirement giving yourself
[1:01:00] as a living sacrifice and what is it
[1:01:02] it's a sacrifice of your desires
[1:01:05] it's a sacrifice of your will for the
[1:01:08] will of this word
[1:01:10] for the will of god that's in his word
[1:01:13] it's so simple but if we could take that
[1:01:17] and just continue to walk that's the
[1:01:19] works we're talking about
[1:01:21] it's not working your own ideas it's
[1:01:24] just doing what he said
[1:01:27] they said lord when did we ever see you
[1:01:29] hungry
[1:01:31] when did we see you thirsty or in prison
[1:01:33] or sick
[1:01:34] he said insomuch as you've done unto the
[1:01:35] least of these
[1:01:37] you've done it unto me what was that
[1:01:39] that's just fulfilling the word
[1:01:42] that's just show me your faith without
[1:01:44] words i'll show you my faith by my works
[1:01:47] if you say unto your brother who hath
[1:01:49] need be
[1:01:50] clothed and be be warmed and filled and
[1:01:53] you don't give him what he has need of
[1:01:58] if it's that way with that so is it for
[1:02:00] the rest
[1:02:02] if he's called us to go into all the
[1:02:04] world and preach the gospel
[1:02:06] what is that that's the worship
[1:02:09] you say oh i'm not a preacher you are a
[1:02:12] preacher
[1:02:13] you're a written epistle you're a living
[1:02:16] word
[1:02:17] that every action you take is a worship
[1:02:20] every time you praise the lord jesus and
[1:02:23] you tell someone about him
[1:02:24] that's a worship worship isn't just
[1:02:28] coming in here
[1:02:29] raising their hands and saying i'll
[1:02:31] praise you lord that's praise
[1:02:33] we're talking about worship
[1:02:37] we're talking about every time you go
[1:02:39] out the door you're
[1:02:40] on the altar you say lord consume me
[1:02:45] as a sacrifice let the fire fall on me
[1:02:52] and you know what happens when the fire
[1:02:54] falls on you
[1:02:56] anybody around that can catch on fire
[1:02:59] too
[1:03:00] they can't help it but catch on fire
[1:03:04] if they're made of the same stuff
[1:03:09] they can't help it but that's the
[1:03:11] worship
[1:03:13] true worship we've got the spirit we've
[1:03:16] got the truth the devil's
[1:03:17] tried to pull the wool on our eyes and
[1:03:19] say oh we don't have it no
[1:03:21] we've got it it's here
[1:03:26] the question is what are we doing with
[1:03:28] it
[1:03:30] god's powers never waned god's power
[1:03:34] doesn't falter
[1:03:35] but he wants a worship oh i got a quote
[1:03:38] for you right here
[1:03:40] uh when i read this i was like this is i
[1:03:42] like this
[1:03:44] this is from all things 1962.
[1:03:48] now i want you i want you to think about
[1:03:50] this just think while we're we're
[1:03:51] reading this here
[1:03:52] it's it's a little bit lengthy but i
[1:03:53] think you'll i think you'll be blessed
[1:03:56] isaiah spilled it out to them and said
[1:03:58] god said
[1:03:59] he's hiding his face from your prayers
[1:04:02] you've got your ritualistic form
[1:04:03] yet it's the truth you're doing what he
[1:04:06] told you but you're not doing it in
[1:04:07] sincerity
[1:04:08] and you squall out day and night but god
[1:04:11] said your sacrifice is a stink to me
[1:04:13] and i will not receive it anymore and
[1:04:15] when you pray under such conditions i'll
[1:04:17] hide my face from you
[1:04:19] now don't put yourself there because
[1:04:21] that's not the bride that's not you
[1:04:24] that's the devil speaking to you if you
[1:04:25] start putting yourself in that place
[1:04:27] because we're not here out of ritual
[1:04:30] we're here out of sincerity
[1:04:32] i was just driving here on the way on
[1:04:34] the way to church and there's like a
[1:04:35] little bar or something down the road
[1:04:37] and that place was so packed they had
[1:04:38] cars on the other side
[1:04:41] but you know what not so for the people
[1:04:42] of god not so for the bride she's come
[1:04:45] for the living water
[1:04:46] she's come for the new wine she's come
[1:04:48] for the stimulation by revelation
[1:04:52] he said oh god if people would think of
[1:04:54] that it would start a pentecost
[1:04:57] god said though you be correctly in the
[1:04:59] word but if you don't do it with love
[1:05:01] and sincerity
[1:05:02] god said he would hide his face and
[1:05:04] wouldn't hear your prayers see
[1:05:06] that's the way now don't put yourself
[1:05:08] there
[1:05:09] what because why because i believe the
[1:05:12] people of god here
[1:05:13] we've got sincerity you're here to serve
[1:05:16] god
[1:05:17] your desire is to serve him we've got
[1:05:19] the word
[1:05:20] we're not denying the truth so what's
[1:05:22] the only thing
[1:05:23] is putting it into action oh
[1:05:27] you said that your talk you're taking
[1:05:29] under the old testament brother branham
[1:05:30] all right let's take the new testament
[1:05:32] second timothy 3 the holy spirit warned
[1:05:34] us that in the last days that the church
[1:05:36] would get away from the sincerity and
[1:05:38] the faith they'd have a form of
[1:05:39] godliness but would deny the power
[1:05:41] that went with the right thing having a
[1:05:44] form of godliness
[1:05:45] but denying the power thereof yes sir
[1:05:48] god
[1:05:48] hates a powerless religion and any
[1:05:51] religion today that hasn't got christ in
[1:05:53] it is powerless
[1:05:55] but any religion that christ in is under
[1:05:58] his own blood
[1:05:59] and it's got power in it you say god
[1:06:02] hates a religion without power
[1:06:04] he said your solemn feasts is a stink i
[1:06:07] guess he does hate it
[1:06:09] he said it it makes me sick and remember
[1:06:12] he told this rich laodicean church that
[1:06:15] because you're lukewarm
[1:06:16] in other words you make me sick i'll
[1:06:19] spew you out
[1:06:20] i'll spare not you'd think he'd be
[1:06:23] accepted
[1:06:23] certainly not but he'd cry just the same
[1:06:27] silent feasts they're a stink god hates
[1:06:30] powerless religion it's got to have
[1:06:33] power in it
[1:06:34] it's got to have sincerity sincerity
[1:06:37] brings power
[1:06:38] sincerity brings real worship
[1:06:41] that's what we're talking about everyday
[1:06:43] worship
[1:06:44] now this is what i like this i like this
[1:06:46] right here he says not
[1:06:47] forms but genuine power
[1:06:51] worship to know that you've passed from
[1:06:54] death unto life
[1:06:55] i love that one i love that little
[1:06:57] phrase he said genuine
[1:06:59] power worship when you get up
[1:07:02] every day and you say lord i'm going to
[1:07:04] worship you
[1:07:06] with my life i'm going to wake up today
[1:07:09] and and randall burton's going on the
[1:07:11] altar today
[1:07:13] he's gonna die and i'm gonna worship you
[1:07:16] how in spirit by putting yourself down
[1:07:21] and in truth lord i'm gonna walk
[1:07:23] according to this word
[1:07:25] to the best that i can when i see
[1:07:27] someone that needs help
[1:07:28] i'm going to reach out the hand not my
[1:07:30] head but the hand of christ
[1:07:32] because i've got what they need when
[1:07:35] someone's down
[1:07:36] i'm going to reach down not with my hand
[1:07:38] but the hand of faith
[1:07:41] that shall save the sick and god will
[1:07:44] raise them up
[1:07:46] not you raising them up god would raise
[1:07:49] them up
[1:07:52] a genuine power worship how many of you
[1:07:55] want that your life
[1:07:57] not just a little praise i want a power
[1:08:00] worship
[1:08:04] god wants to perform his word by his
[1:08:07] power
[1:08:09] oh i'm going to read that again god
[1:08:11] wants to perform his word
[1:08:14] by his people no by his power
[1:08:17] you are just the conduit that he desires
[1:08:20] to do it through
[1:08:25] it's like guys say this if you're
[1:08:27] expecting a package from fedex
[1:08:30] and they come and that package has got
[1:08:33] something that you really need
[1:08:36] they come and deliver the package it's
[1:08:39] it's not it's not the delivery driver
[1:08:42] that you that that you're that you're
[1:08:44] looking for you're looking for the
[1:08:45] package
[1:08:47] i need what's in the package i don't
[1:08:50] care who the driver is
[1:08:53] i need the package it's got it's got
[1:08:56] some life-saving medication
[1:08:59] that's what you are you're the delivery
[1:09:02] driver
[1:09:03] you're out there every day you're the
[1:09:06] fedex for the lord jesus
[1:09:09] carried packing eternal life
[1:09:12] and whether people know it or not you're
[1:09:15] gonna deliver a package to their
[1:09:17] doorstep
[1:09:18] that they have need of more than
[1:09:20] anything in the world
[1:09:22] and it's not up to you the driver
[1:09:26] they gotta open the package the package
[1:09:29] will do the rest
[1:09:32] it doesn't matter about the delivery he
[1:09:33] could be he could be crooked-backed
[1:09:36] could barely move can't barely speak
[1:09:38] half-blind
[1:09:40] doesn't matter it's the package that's
[1:09:42] the big thing
[1:09:44] so we're so busy looking at the driver
[1:09:47] we're basically looking at the delivery
[1:09:48] person
[1:09:50] look to the one who's delivering eternal
[1:09:54] life
[1:09:57] he wants to perform his word by his
[1:09:59] power
[1:10:01] not by your goodness not by your ability
[1:10:05] his power and when the church denies his
[1:10:09] power
[1:10:10] how can he perform and vindicate his
[1:10:12] word
[1:10:15] how many times do we deny his power
[1:10:18] well we got a headache while i'll go
[1:10:19] take the tylenol
[1:10:21] let's take the power of god oh
[1:10:24] my my child's sick we're running right
[1:10:26] to the doctor no how about we pray first
[1:10:28] how about we go to the power of god oh
[1:10:31] no i'm not denying that doctors have
[1:10:33] their place we all know that i've taken
[1:10:34] when i had the coronavirus i took plenty
[1:10:37] ibuprofen tylenol
[1:10:39] but you know it wasn't that that did
[1:10:41] anything the lord uses vehicles
[1:10:43] sometimes like
[1:10:44] that praise the lord for it but that
[1:10:47] wasn't what healed me
[1:10:48] it was my lord jesus that healed me
[1:10:51] just like it isn't it isn't you're you
[1:10:53] so i love what
[1:10:55] brother braden tells the the story about
[1:10:57] the one that went hunting
[1:10:58] and had all this game and he said i'm
[1:11:00] tired of it i want to be a christian he
[1:11:01] said
[1:11:01] he said oh what sermon did i preach or
[1:11:04] what did i do or what i do see
[1:11:06] he was worried about the messenger he
[1:11:07] was worried about the delivery driver
[1:11:10] but he said i want any of that preacher
[1:11:13] he said i see you've seen all the
[1:11:14] goodness of god
[1:11:16] he said he must have done it for me he
[1:11:18] must love me
[1:11:19] because i'm not where i'm not a good
[1:11:21] shot anyway
[1:11:23] so is it with us we're so worried about
[1:11:26] the delivery driver
[1:11:28] oh what can i do to that you're not
[1:11:29] obligated it's not your obligation
[1:11:33] you're saying i don't understand enough
[1:11:37] i don't i don't think i know all this
[1:11:38] stuff it's not about knowledge anyway
[1:11:40] the only knowledge that matters is
[1:11:42] knowledge of him
[1:11:44] his saving grace to you
[1:11:48] that's why the prophet would say just
[1:11:49] tell them how the candle got lit
[1:11:51] what was jesus christ's power to you
[1:11:55] and you watch if that doesn't set other
[1:11:56] things of fire
[1:11:59] amen he says when the church explains it
[1:12:02] away
[1:12:03] and says it's first some other day and
[1:12:05] something how can god
[1:12:07] who wants to fulfill his word and
[1:12:10] perform his word among the people
[1:12:12] and the people deny that he does it you
[1:12:15] say well brother we don't explain it
[1:12:16] away
[1:12:17] oh well let's think about it
[1:12:20] the lord puts down your heart you need
[1:12:21] to go witness to that person you need to
[1:12:23] pray for that person
[1:12:24] but lord i've been such a hypocrite that
[1:12:26] you just explained away the power of god
[1:12:27] because it's not about you anyway
[1:12:31] oh well well the lord tells you oh you
[1:12:34] ought to call
[1:12:35] no you know i think about the just the
[1:12:36] little things because if we're faithful
[1:12:38] and little we'll be faithful and much
[1:12:41] lord puts a little thing on your heart
[1:12:43] says oh you know what you ought to call
[1:12:44] that brother or sister up
[1:12:45] you know that maybe they need some
[1:12:47] encouragement you say lord they don't
[1:12:48] want to hear from anyone you just
[1:12:49] explained away the power of god
[1:12:52] you explained it away you found a
[1:12:54] reasoning we'd remember we spoke about
[1:12:55] reasonings
[1:12:56] you found a reason to ignore the call of
[1:12:59] god
[1:13:00] and i always liked this thought is that
[1:13:02] you think the devil was inspiring you
[1:13:05] to encourage your brother in the lord
[1:13:08] and yet we'll use that excuse whether we
[1:13:11] we say it that way or not
[1:13:13] oh surely you know the lord didn't want
[1:13:16] me to talk to him
[1:13:18] he told you to do it follow the still
[1:13:21] small voice that's your worship
[1:13:23] and that is a worship when you can lay
[1:13:27] down
[1:13:28] you know how many times the lord will
[1:13:30] ask you to do something when you're at
[1:13:31] your lowest
[1:13:32] why because he wants to get you out of
[1:13:34] the equation
[1:13:37] amen he wants all thoughts of yourself
[1:13:40] sometimes he's got to humiliate you to
[1:13:42] give you a little humility
[1:13:44] to get you a place where he can work
[1:13:46] through you
[1:13:48] and he's doing it this isn't this isn't
[1:13:51] to be accusatorial or any of those
[1:13:52] things like
[1:13:53] accusing no because we've got the bride
[1:13:55] in here this is to make you understand
[1:13:58] that you are that conduit you are that
[1:14:00] one
[1:14:01] but you've got to not worry about the
[1:14:03] fulfillment of it that's our god
[1:14:07] amen i just like using that delivery
[1:14:10] driver idea
[1:14:12] it's not if you're getting a package
[1:14:13] from amazon that delivery driver doesn't
[1:14:16] care where it came from
[1:14:17] or even where it's going the only thing
[1:14:19] he knows he drives his truck
[1:14:21] picks up a package gets on the road
[1:14:23] drives to the delivery place drops it
[1:14:25] off and he's done
[1:14:26] yes that's what you are you're a
[1:14:29] delivery
[1:14:30] vehicle for eternal life
[1:14:36] you're an icbm an intercontinental
[1:14:38] ballistic missile you are
[1:14:39] you are a you are a atomic power
[1:14:44] atomic power i i i just just kind of had
[1:14:47] that thought
[1:14:48] i thought this for so many times you
[1:14:49] know brother brandon always talked about
[1:14:50] when two omnipotents meet
[1:14:52] you know that's the supernatural happens
[1:14:54] you know i thought about that there's
[1:14:55] there's something about when you meet
[1:14:57] another child of god
[1:14:59] because we call them sons of adam or you
[1:15:01] know we're the children of adam
[1:15:02] from descended the sons of god you know
[1:15:04] atom and you know when two atoms collide
[1:15:07] that's where the power comes
[1:15:10] you got you got you got nuclear power
[1:15:14] creative power that's why the devil
[1:15:17] likes to keep us apart
[1:15:19] because when you start bringing this
[1:15:20] atom this son of adam atom and there's
[1:15:23] atom together
[1:15:25] and they said they're looking for fusion
[1:15:26] and all these other things we got it
[1:15:28] right here in the spiritual
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:33] and it's not that little atom it doesn't
[1:15:36] have to do anything you know
[1:15:38] all the power when that when they split
[1:15:40] those atoms and they push them together
[1:15:41] that atom didn't have to do nothing it's
[1:15:44] the power's inherent in the atom
[1:15:46] it exists inside the atom already all
[1:15:50] that process dead
[1:15:51] was unlock what was already there
[1:15:55] and if it could take these natural
[1:15:57] things are given for our benefit
[1:15:59] you understand they use them for their
[1:16:01] destructive power that's fine
[1:16:02] that's great they can use them for
[1:16:04] whatever they want man always destroys
[1:16:05] themselves that's great
[1:16:07] but god for the spiritual minded can see
[1:16:09] he used the smallest little thing that
[1:16:11] you can't even see
[1:16:13] to show the power that could come out of
[1:16:15] that one little atom
[1:16:17] and that's you you feel so insignificant
[1:16:20] you feel so little
[1:16:22] but you're packing atomic power
[1:16:25] all you got to do is be willing to be
[1:16:27] used by god
[1:16:30] he says and the people deny that does it
[1:16:33] yet they go through all the rituals see
[1:16:34] here's what happened
[1:16:36] god wants to perform by the holy ghost
[1:16:39] and vindicate his word i like the way he
[1:16:42] says this
[1:16:42] god wants to perform by the holy ghost
[1:16:44] and vindicate his word
[1:16:46] and the church wants to perform
[1:16:50] now there's a difference between god
[1:16:52] performing his word and the church just
[1:16:54] performing
[1:16:56] one's putting on a ritual the other one
[1:16:58] wants to see a real worship in the life
[1:17:00] of christ that's what he's calling us to
[1:17:04] simply amen
[1:17:08] praise the lord
[1:17:18] let's turn to second timothy
[1:17:23] chapter two god is
[1:17:27] you know god is wanting to perform his
[1:17:30] word more than you want to see it
[1:17:31] performed
[1:17:37] he wants to see it he come to pa he's
[1:17:38] already spoken there's no question about
[1:17:40] whether it's going to happen or not
[1:17:41] that's right he's waiting for his people
[1:17:43] to start to step out
[1:17:56] second timothy chapter 2
[1:18:01] and we'll read verses 3 and 4 thou
[1:18:04] therefore endure hardness as a good
[1:18:06] soldier of jesus christ
[1:18:08] no man that wareth entangleth himself
[1:18:10] with the affairs of this life that
[1:18:12] may please him who have chosen him
[1:18:15] to be a soldier that's the worship we're
[1:18:18] talking about we're talking about true
[1:18:19] worshipers
[1:18:24] we're talking about every day a real a
[1:18:27] life
[1:18:28] that is sacrificed to the lord with your
[1:18:30] desires out the window
[1:18:31] and we've talked about it so many times
[1:18:33] but we think about gethsemane
[1:18:35] and what the lord jesus did in
[1:18:37] gethsemane was showing
[1:18:38] that conquering ability over your will
[1:18:43] you know we we know the scripture says
[1:18:45] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:18:49] why because obedience is a sacrifice
[1:18:53] it's a sacrifice of your own will it's a
[1:18:56] sacrifice of your desires
[1:18:58] to fulfill the desires of him who's
[1:19:01] called you to be a soldier
[1:19:04] that's why when they pray bring them in
[1:19:05] the in the military they cut all the
[1:19:08] guy's hair
[1:19:09] off they yell at them all the time what
[1:19:11] are they doing they're trying to make
[1:19:12] them see that the only thing that
[1:19:13] matters
[1:19:15] is to fulfill the orders that are coming
[1:19:17] from above
[1:19:18] you do the orders that are given why
[1:19:20] because they can see they're seeing more
[1:19:22] than you're seeing
[1:19:23] and if it be so in the natural army
[1:19:26] how much more in the supernatural when
[1:19:29] we can take our orders from the lord
[1:19:31] that says
[1:19:31] that says go into all the world and
[1:19:33] preach the gospel
[1:19:35] that says women don't cut your hair and
[1:19:36] all these different things now
[1:19:38] we've taken so many of the things
[1:19:41] correctly
[1:19:42] we understand the dress we understand
[1:19:45] the proper way for
[1:19:46] brothers and sisters to conduct
[1:19:47] themselves now the question is what are
[1:19:50] we doing with the rest of it
[1:19:52] willing to step out put ourselves it's
[1:19:54] putting yourself on the line
[1:19:57] why because that because it really comes
[1:20:00] down to a thing of pride
[1:20:02] are we willing to be i just had that are
[1:20:05] we willing to be humiliated for the
[1:20:06] gospel
[1:20:08] and see we take that humiliation and say
[1:20:10] oh it means something went wrong no it
[1:20:11] doesn't mean anything went wrong
[1:20:14] they thought everything went wrong when
[1:20:16] christ was hanging on calvary
[1:20:19] it looked like everything went wrong
[1:20:22] when the hebrew boys were about to be
[1:20:24] thrown in the fiery furnace
[1:20:28] and yet they said whether he'll deliver
[1:20:30] us or not he's still
[1:20:32] able and we won't bow
[1:20:35] and that's what god is calling in this
[1:20:37] hour
[1:20:38] whether he fulfills it the way you want
[1:20:41] it to be fulfilled
[1:20:43] i don't know i don't know if he's going
[1:20:46] to fulfill that healing
[1:20:48] immediately or in the future
[1:20:51] by a doctor by a miracle
[1:20:54] i don't know if that salvation of that
[1:20:56] loved one is going to come in the next
[1:20:58] second
[1:20:59] or the next hour or the next day but it
[1:21:02] doesn't matter
[1:21:03] because i don't rest in a time frame i
[1:21:06] don't rest
[1:21:07] in the how i rest in the finished work
[1:21:10] of the word that was spoken already
[1:21:14] that's where we rest the lord takes care
[1:21:17] of all of that
[1:21:20] we won't hold you much longer i just got
[1:21:22] a couple other
[1:21:24] quotes that we'll read here
[1:21:28] is we have uh from we have seen his star
[1:21:29] and have come to worship him in 1963
[1:21:32] he says what time are we living in what
[1:21:35] is the sign
[1:21:37] god said he would show last before it
[1:21:39] come to pass
[1:21:40] what was the things he said israel in
[1:21:42] her place over yonder the fig tree was
[1:21:44] throwing herself back again
[1:21:46] look at everything just exactly setting
[1:21:48] in line and the church in the laodicean
[1:21:50] condition
[1:21:51] with jesus on the outside a fugitive to
[1:21:53] his own church
[1:21:54] just as david was up above bethlehem a
[1:21:57] fugitive from his own people
[1:22:00] a fugitive and christ the bible said
[1:22:03] in the last days was a fugitive to his
[1:22:05] own people
[1:22:06] there in revelation the third chapter in
[1:22:09] the laodicea
[1:22:10] age that we're living in christ is on
[1:22:11] the outside knocking trying to get in
[1:22:14] a fugitive to his own people
[1:22:18] was then that those warriors grabbed
[1:22:20] them swords this is what god's looking
[1:22:21] for us
[1:22:23] those warriors how many warriors in here
[1:22:25] for jesus christ
[1:22:27] we got mighty men and mighty women
[1:22:31] not by our own power but because he said
[1:22:33] so
[1:22:35] when he told gideon thou mighty man of
[1:22:37] valor and gideon said huh
[1:22:38] who's he talking to me that's you
[1:22:43] he said when them warriors grabbed them
[1:22:44] swords
[1:22:46] and david cried out for a fresh drink of
[1:22:49] water
[1:22:51] and they cut their way through 15 miles
[1:22:53] of men to get him a drink of water
[1:22:55] and david poured it out upon the ground
[1:22:58] a sacrifice a drink offering
[1:23:02] yes warriors today that's you warriors
[1:23:06] today
[1:23:07] jesus wants a drink of good old
[1:23:11] pentecostal fresh water
[1:23:14] these denominational stagnated waters is
[1:23:17] sickening to him
[1:23:18] take the word of god and pull it cut
[1:23:22] through all these creeds and things
[1:23:23] till we can hit that place where there's
[1:23:26] a fresh drink for him
[1:23:27] a real true worship that's the worship
[1:23:31] when you take the word and you start
[1:23:34] cutting the devil
[1:23:35] and you say lord i want to worship you
[1:23:39] i want my life to be a living worship
[1:23:42] memorial
[1:23:43] to the lord jesus christ how do you do
[1:23:47] it
[1:23:47] you take the word and you say i believe
[1:23:50] it
[1:23:51] i'm gonna cut with it i may look silly
[1:23:54] i may look foolish but i'm gonna walk
[1:23:57] forward
[1:23:58] just like abraham that's a real true
[1:24:02] worship a genuine heart
[1:24:04] where he can pour down his make his word
[1:24:07] live in this day he'll have it
[1:24:11] he said he would restore the faith of
[1:24:13] the people
[1:24:14] back to the fathers faith of the
[1:24:16] children malachi 4 tells us it'll come
[1:24:19] and it will be there don't you worry
[1:24:22] it'll be right there
[1:24:23] god has done said so that's all the
[1:24:26] clock is ticking right on
[1:24:27] yes sir but today we see that those
[1:24:30] great
[1:24:30] and he goes on from there he says it'll
[1:24:33] be right there
[1:24:35] it's right here it's right here
[1:24:38] what does he say just pick up the swords
[1:24:41] take that word
[1:24:42] and start cutting the enemy
[1:24:45] will fall before that sword
[1:24:49] there's nothing that can stand i believe
[1:24:51] it was revelation said
[1:24:52] the sword that went out from his mouth
[1:24:54] there was none that could stand
[1:24:56] to that that double-edged sword
[1:24:59] just a couple more and then we'll close
[1:25:04] this is from god's only provided place
[1:25:06] of worship
[1:25:09] it says that every little jot everything
[1:25:12] you must be faithful in always the
[1:25:15] little the little vine
[1:25:16] the little the little fox that spoils
[1:25:19] the vine
[1:25:20] sometimes you leave it's not the big
[1:25:22] things you do
[1:25:23] it's the little things you leave undone
[1:25:27] lord forgive me for the times
[1:25:30] when you see so i really appreciate
[1:25:32] brother matthew's testimony about just
[1:25:34] seeing a man in a wheelchair say i'll
[1:25:36] pray for you i don't know if he's
[1:25:38] walking or not but he stood on the word
[1:25:41] that's you know what that's what he's
[1:25:43] calling for
[1:25:44] just stand on the word you can't do
[1:25:48] anything else but that
[1:25:50] what else can you do besides stand on
[1:25:53] that word and declare
[1:25:54] that it's the truth and continue to walk
[1:25:56] in it
[1:25:58] it says you got you got to be faithful
[1:26:00] in it it's the little things you leave
[1:26:01] undone remember a chain is only
[1:26:03] strongest at its weakest link
[1:26:05] blessed are they that do all the
[1:26:06] commandments of god
[1:26:08] that they might have the right to enter
[1:26:10] in do all god said
[1:26:12] and it said for women to have long hair
[1:26:14] you say a man told me not
[1:26:16] long ago said i don't preach a
[1:26:17] clothesline religion i said then you're
[1:26:19] not preaching the gospel yeah god laid
[1:26:22] it out there
[1:26:23] he said what to do and you either do it
[1:26:26] that's your natural
[1:26:27] reasonable thing what little thing what
[1:26:30] the little insignificant jesus said
[1:26:32] blessed are they that would take all the
[1:26:34] little thing and do the little things
[1:26:36] and a woman to let her hair grow that's
[1:26:39] just why
[1:26:40] it's just something she can do and she
[1:26:42] won't even do that
[1:26:43] she won't even do that oh teach us great
[1:26:46] teach us the great things
[1:26:48] how can you teach the great things when
[1:26:49] you won't do the simple common thing
[1:26:52] because you see your motive and
[1:26:53] objective is wrong it's your love to god
[1:26:56] lord i don't care what you want me to do
[1:27:00] i'm willing to do it
[1:27:04] i'm going to read that one again it's
[1:27:06] your love to god
[1:27:08] lord i don't care what you want me to do
[1:27:12] i'm willing to do it then you're getting
[1:27:14] somewhere
[1:27:16] but if you don't do it that way the way
[1:27:18] he said do it
[1:27:20] it's his choosing the place that i've
[1:27:22] chosen
[1:27:23] that's where you worship with your
[1:27:25] sacrifice so if we're talking about a
[1:27:27] worship
[1:27:28] and your life being the sacrifice and we
[1:27:31] know
[1:27:32] his chosen place of worship is under the
[1:27:34] shed blood
[1:27:35] and in the word then where do you
[1:27:38] where do you worship you worship in the
[1:27:41] word how do you worship in the word
[1:27:43] by not leaving the things undone
[1:27:47] just as simple as that as what we've
[1:27:49] been hearing our pastor preach
[1:27:51] fulfilling the works just the little
[1:27:54] things
[1:27:54] oh you say what about the miracles god
[1:27:56] will do that
[1:27:58] you can't do that anyway
[1:28:02] yeah brother david just said it first
[1:28:04] they'll follow you
[1:28:05] you don't do that any they don't go
[1:28:06] before all of us want the miracles to go
[1:28:09] before
[1:28:10] notice the lord says do the little
[1:28:11] things the miracles and everything they
[1:28:14] follow
[1:28:15] these signs shall follow amen then that
[1:28:17] belief
[1:28:19] but not everyone just has to believe it
[1:28:22] he says they that hear the sayings of my
[1:28:24] father and do with them
[1:28:28] maybe let's just examine ourselves say
[1:28:29] lord what are the little things that
[1:28:31] we're not doing
[1:28:32] see it's remember iniquity what did he
[1:28:35] call me said you workers of iniquity now
[1:28:37] i don't believe that's anybody here
[1:28:39] but remember what iniquity is it's not
[1:28:41] only commission
[1:28:43] but it's omission when you know to do
[1:28:46] good
[1:28:46] and do with it not when you see the one
[1:28:51] when there's a reason why your job you
[1:28:53] might hear someone talking about how
[1:28:54] depressed they've been over the last
[1:28:56] couple months
[1:28:57] and we'll just chalk it up in our minds
[1:28:59] and say oh
[1:29:00] man that i wonder why i heard that
[1:29:03] that's because you got the answer
[1:29:07] or we wonder why someone crosses our
[1:29:09] path and something just tugs us man
[1:29:11] maybe i ought to talk to him there's a
[1:29:13] reason that's happening
[1:29:15] don't let it go undone that's for all of
[1:29:18] us
[1:29:18] that's for me lord help me i'm not
[1:29:21] pointing the finger
[1:29:23] that's not the point but god wants to
[1:29:26] see
[1:29:26] if we could be faithful in those little
[1:29:27] things then we'll start to see the
[1:29:29] things follow
[1:29:31] then we start to cutting with that word
[1:29:34] i was getting a haircut yesterday and my
[1:29:36] wife went over to the
[1:29:38] to the dollar tree store and i got done
[1:29:40] with my haircut
[1:29:41] and i called her and and she was like
[1:29:44] i'm talking to this this lady and she
[1:29:46] just happened to talk to this happened
[1:29:48] to be walking into the dollar tree store
[1:29:49] and there's this
[1:29:50] woman coming in there and she said hi
[1:29:52] and she said oh hi she said oh i really
[1:29:53] like your skirt
[1:29:55] and they just started chatting and sure
[1:29:57] enough this this woman was dating a
[1:29:59] pentecostal
[1:30:00] and they must have been a holiness
[1:30:01] pentecostal because she obviously
[1:30:02] noticed the skirt
[1:30:04] and so they started talking and the lord
[1:30:06] used her to witness to her
[1:30:07] see that's not leaving the little things
[1:30:09] undone
[1:30:11] that's taking that every opportunity say
[1:30:13] lord i'm gonna i'm gonna step out there
[1:30:15] on
[1:30:15] by faith i'm gonna put it on the line my
[1:30:17] life's gonna be a worship
[1:30:21] worship is so much it's beyond just
[1:30:24] oh well praise the lord bless the lord
[1:30:26] oh my soul we come in here to sing the
[1:30:27] praises of god
[1:30:28] no a worship is that every day there's a
[1:30:31] it's a power worship
[1:30:33] i'm going to be using that from now on i
[1:30:34] want a power worship
[1:30:38] lord
[1:30:41] he says now he says uh in paragraph 104
[1:30:47] he says you put cain brought his
[1:30:48] sacrifice evil bro abel brought his
[1:30:51] it depends on what place you take it
[1:30:52] into
[1:30:54] if you take it into the place where he's
[1:30:56] chosen
[1:30:57] it'll be all right he'll accept it see
[1:30:59] that's all those scarecrows out there
[1:31:02] oh you see the ones oh they're they're
[1:31:03] having these little these little
[1:31:05] maybe they have some signs and wonders
[1:31:07] over here they have these things over
[1:31:08] there but what was it they took their
[1:31:09] sacrifice
[1:31:11] and they didn't bring it into the true
[1:31:12] place of worship
[1:31:14] it doesn't matter what it looks like on
[1:31:15] the outside except to be in the true
[1:31:18] place of worship
[1:31:19] in the end it won't be accepted why
[1:31:22] lord lord have not we done this have we
[1:31:25] not we done that
[1:31:26] depart from me you that work iniquity i
[1:31:29] showed you the place of worship
[1:31:31] in this word and you wouldn't bring your
[1:31:32] sacrifice there
[1:31:35] he said it'll be right he'll accept it
[1:31:37] if it's not he won't accept it don't
[1:31:38] care
[1:31:38] it's the same sacrifice whatever it is
[1:31:41] it's still
[1:31:42] it's still rejected unless it's brought
[1:31:44] to that one certain place
[1:31:47] oh my think about it that's why brother
[1:31:49] branham could say there's so many that
[1:31:51] sincerely worship buddha
[1:31:55] but they're sincerely wrong
[1:31:59] they're brought some have dedicated you
[1:32:01] they have those monks
[1:32:02] and all these ones that completely
[1:32:04] dedicate their lives
[1:32:06] to their religion far beyond
[1:32:10] anything that we have ever probably done
[1:32:13] and yet it won't benefit one thing
[1:32:17] because it was brought not under the
[1:32:20] right place
[1:32:21] where god is called to worship so the
[1:32:23] sacrifice will be rejected
[1:32:25] though sincere
[1:32:28] so if we have the true place of worship
[1:32:32] and we've got ourselves as a sacrifice
[1:32:34] to offer
[1:32:35] then what hindereth us to offer
[1:32:38] ourselves
[1:32:39] when we know that we have the
[1:32:41] appropriate place to worship
[1:32:43] amen let's just continue on now
[1:32:46] we want to find out where we want to
[1:32:48] bring the sacrifice
[1:32:50] if we could find out we all want to go
[1:32:52] to heaven don't we
[1:32:53] we we uh and we all know we've done
[1:32:55] wrong
[1:32:56] we all believe that jesus is the
[1:32:58] sacrifice now we
[1:32:59] want to know where to take him it'll be
[1:33:02] accepted see that's right the bible
[1:33:04] tells us
[1:33:05] where to take him at and it'll be and
[1:33:07] then it'll be accepted outside of there
[1:33:08] it won't be accepted
[1:33:10] let us notice here also the place that
[1:33:12] he chose for the sacrifice to be laid
[1:33:15] that he that the place that he chose to
[1:33:17] put the sacrifice
[1:33:19] you can't put it on any of these gates
[1:33:22] but the place that he chose to put it he
[1:33:25] also put his name
[1:33:27] in that place see that's what he said
[1:33:29] here
[1:33:30] he chose to put his name in it now let
[1:33:32] us search the scriptures for this place
[1:33:35] for that is the place where he put his
[1:33:36] name now let's read from the text
[1:33:39] and i had a little note laying here that
[1:33:41] i this morning come to me
[1:33:43] let's take the second verse of this
[1:33:45] chapter now i don't want to hold too
[1:33:46] long on account of the people
[1:33:48] on these hookups out here now the second
[1:33:50] verse of the 16th chapter
[1:33:52] thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[1:33:53] passover unto the lord thy god of thy
[1:33:55] flocks and thy heard
[1:33:57] in the place which the lord shall choose
[1:33:59] to put his name there
[1:34:00] now you can't take this your sincerity
[1:34:03] and all that you want to confess
[1:34:05] you just can't take it to a methodist
[1:34:07] altar to a baptist altar
[1:34:09] to a pentecostal altar but there is an
[1:34:12] altar somewhere that he chose
[1:34:13] that he to put his name in it and he
[1:34:15] would meet you at that place
[1:34:18] now if you get everything running just
[1:34:20] right it's going to run
[1:34:22] everything's set in order if there's a
[1:34:24] short in that wire
[1:34:25] that light won't come on because it's
[1:34:27] been grounded and when you'll take
[1:34:29] one of god's words or one of his places
[1:34:32] and in your own heart have selfish
[1:34:33] objectives
[1:34:34] it'll ground the power of god right
[1:34:36] there if you do it because you want to
[1:34:38] be smart
[1:34:39] you want to be different from somebody
[1:34:41] else or something right there is
[1:34:43] grounded
[1:34:44] it'll blow the fuse you're wrong you've
[1:34:47] got to come with sincerity with all your
[1:34:48] heart
[1:34:49] your motives and your objective place
[1:34:52] that on god
[1:34:53] then search for his place find where he
[1:34:55] said and bring it there
[1:34:58] now the reason i read that i really
[1:34:59] wanted to read that is because
[1:35:01] i feel like many of us are almost on the
[1:35:04] opposite side of that if i could say it
[1:35:06] that way
[1:35:07] sincere we know the word
[1:35:11] but then the devil gives you every
[1:35:13] excuse
[1:35:14] why not the throat bring that sacrifice
[1:35:16] of your worship out there
[1:35:19] and step out under the word because
[1:35:21] you've got the right say lord i don't
[1:35:23] desire
[1:35:24] to see the work of god for me to have a
[1:35:26] name
[1:35:28] i believe that none of us are here to do
[1:35:29] that i i've we've talked
[1:35:31] uh you know just talking with all the
[1:35:33] ones that i've talked to our desire is
[1:35:35] to serve god
[1:35:36] to see the name of the lord jesus lift
[1:35:38] it up but the devil would put those
[1:35:40] scarecrows up
[1:35:42] and say oh you can't do it because of
[1:35:44] this and you can't do it because of that
[1:35:46] when all the lord wants you to do is
[1:35:47] just put all that aside
[1:35:49] and say lord it's your word i have no
[1:35:52] power to fulfill your word anyway
[1:35:54] i couldn't do it if i wanted to as much
[1:35:57] how many desires to see the word of god
[1:35:58] fulfilled raise your hand
[1:36:00] amen how many of you can do it yourself
[1:36:03] exactly so all we can do is walk in that
[1:36:09] just like when elijah came to mount
[1:36:11] carmel
[1:36:13] the showdown and at the end when he said
[1:36:15] all this i have done
[1:36:16] at thy word oh lord he had done as much
[1:36:20] as he could do at that point
[1:36:22] it was on the lord to to vindicate
[1:36:27] and to bring it to pass so what is the
[1:36:30] lord calling us to do
[1:36:33] set what do you do he place the wood in
[1:36:35] order get that life in order
[1:36:37] let's get it all in order with this word
[1:36:39] let's set it up in order our own
[1:36:41] lives we've done that we're we're we're
[1:36:43] fulfilling those things
[1:36:45] see that's why i want to encourage you
[1:36:47] because it's not it's not to beat us
[1:36:48] down
[1:36:49] but to make us see where we are at
[1:36:53] what the lord has called us to and the
[1:36:55] ability he's placed within you
[1:36:57] because the only ability you have to
[1:36:58] have is to walk in this word now
[1:37:02] he's placed the holy ghost in you
[1:37:05] and i got the quote i'm gonna read right
[1:37:06] at the end
[1:37:09] here we'll read it in just a second he's
[1:37:11] already put it there
[1:37:12] now you just need to take it off the
[1:37:14] shelf and put it on the word
[1:37:17] and it'll bring it it'll bring it to
[1:37:18] pass how
[1:37:20] i don't know when i don't know what it's
[1:37:23] going to look like exactly in every
[1:37:25] situation i don't know
[1:37:27] but he will bring it to pass because he
[1:37:29] promised it
[1:37:30] because it's not on you to fulfill it
[1:37:32] anyway
[1:37:35] let's just all stand if we can i'll
[1:37:36] close with this i want to read just one
[1:37:38] more
[1:37:38] little quote here he's
[1:37:42] this rapture's it's already in the
[1:37:46] process
[1:37:48] we're going in a rapture the lord's word
[1:37:51] is being fulfilled
[1:37:53] even now even now you being here is the
[1:37:56] fulfillment of the word
[1:37:58] in this hour this laodicean age he's
[1:38:01] going to have a bride he's going to have
[1:38:02] a people he has a people
[1:38:05] that are willing to take god at his word
[1:38:10] and we'll just read this and then
[1:38:14] we'll close with this it's from the
[1:38:16] message abraham seed
[1:38:21] and it starts at uh we're in uh chat uh
[1:38:24] paragraph 22
[1:38:25] from 1959.
[1:38:31] and i'll even wait for them to get there
[1:38:35] he says what are you scared about are
[1:38:38] you afraid to take his word for anything
[1:38:41] don't be afraid call the thing right
[1:38:45] i'm an heir to this oh
[1:38:48] i know i don't deserve it but i'm an
[1:38:51] heir anyhow
[1:38:53] because i'm an heir i receive it
[1:38:58] amen that's it there you are because i'm
[1:39:02] an
[1:39:02] heir that's it we're heir of salvation
[1:39:07] heir of the holy spirit i'm an heir
[1:39:10] because jesus paid the price
[1:39:13] nothing i had to do
[1:39:17] i want to say that again nothing i had
[1:39:19] to do
[1:39:22] i just fell heir to it
[1:39:27] amen i'm healed because i'm an heir to
[1:39:30] it
[1:39:30] amen my diseases are gone my affliction
[1:39:34] is gone why because i'm an heir to it
[1:39:38] oh perfect assurance jesus is mine oh
[1:39:40] what a foretaste of glory divine
[1:39:43] heir of salvation purchased of god born
[1:39:45] of his spirit washed in his blood that's
[1:39:46] our story
[1:39:48] oh then satan can't stand that see
[1:39:50] because he's a defeated being
[1:39:52] he's nothing but a bluff jesus paid the
[1:39:55] price
[1:39:56] called us by his grace where air
[1:39:59] what a perfect setup that is see
[1:40:03] he's already defeated i never defeated
[1:40:05] him
[1:40:06] how many and i want you to think about
[1:40:08] and i'm gonna i'll confess
[1:40:10] how many of you have been fought by the
[1:40:12] devil with certain things
[1:40:13] and you just fight as if you're the one
[1:40:15] that needs to fight that that needs to
[1:40:17] win
[1:40:20] no just like jesus all he did in the
[1:40:22] wilderness was stand on the word
[1:40:25] because the devil was already defeated
[1:40:27] he's a defeated being
[1:40:30] i really like that he's not he paid the
[1:40:31] price he said he's already
[1:40:33] i never defeated him christ defeated him
[1:40:37] i'm just claiming my own god-given
[1:40:39] privileges
[1:40:40] that's all you do you just tell satan
[1:40:43] get away from here
[1:40:44] i've got an abstract deed on this
[1:40:46] building it's mine i aired it
[1:40:49] notice abraham he was just an ordinary
[1:40:51] man
[1:40:52] come down from the tower of babel with
[1:40:54] his father and they settled down in the
[1:40:56] probably was up in the land of shinar
[1:40:59] come on down into the city of ur in the
[1:41:00] land of the chaldeans
[1:41:02] he was just an ordinary man not nothing
[1:41:04] not no saint no god
[1:41:06] he's just an ordinary man just an
[1:41:08] ordinary man nothing about him any
[1:41:10] different
[1:41:10] than anyone else no more than there is
[1:41:13] you
[1:41:14] just an ordinary person but god saw
[1:41:17] something in him
[1:41:18] and he called him god seen the same
[1:41:21] thing
[1:41:21] in every born-again man and woman here
[1:41:26] now abraham wasn't afraid to put his to
[1:41:29] work
[1:41:30] are you the same faith that he gave
[1:41:32] abraham
[1:41:33] he gives it to you freely if you'll use
[1:41:36] it
[1:41:38] say i have a gun it'll shoot
[1:41:42] it's a good true shooting gun i hang it
[1:41:45] up on the wall
[1:41:46] i say yeah oh sure i got a gun what do
[1:41:49] you do with
[1:41:50] it hangs on the wall that's faith
[1:41:55] people say oh i'm a christian oh i
[1:41:57] believe god can
[1:41:59] but what do you do about it put it to
[1:42:02] work
[1:42:04] turn it loose do something with it
[1:42:10] get out and hunt up the devil where he
[1:42:13] says
[1:42:14] you're still hurting say you're a liar
[1:42:17] pull a bead on him get him in the scope
[1:42:21] don't be afraid to pull the trigger
[1:42:23] because it'll go off sure is anything
[1:42:26] yes sir it'll boomerang on them so hold
[1:42:29] on
[1:42:32] all you got to do is pull the trigger
[1:42:36] you put that bullet in the chamber you
[1:42:40] pull the hammer back
[1:42:43] all you got to do is pull the trigger
[1:42:45] the powers
[1:42:46] the power doesn't lie with the gun
[1:42:50] itself
[1:42:51] it's the bullet it's the power inside
[1:42:54] the bullet to project
[1:42:56] that that's the same way with the word
[1:42:58] of god
[1:42:59] the power is not in you it's in the holy
[1:43:02] ghost that promised it
[1:43:05] all you got to do is pull it off the
[1:43:07] shelf and hold it there
[1:43:09] and say i believe it i believe it and i
[1:43:12] believe it enough
[1:43:13] to act on it brother branham preach that
[1:43:16] message
[1:43:16] hearing and i can't
[1:43:20] forgive me i'm blanking on it now but i
[1:43:22] know hearing receiving and acting
[1:43:25] we've heard we've received
[1:43:28] now it's time to act
[1:43:32] don't be afraid to be humiliated
[1:43:36] so what if it doesn't happen what what
[1:43:39] if i praise her from when they don't get
[1:43:40] healed
[1:43:41] well that's not up to you the word said
[1:43:44] they would
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:46] so the lord's word is perfect all you
[1:43:49] got to do
[1:43:50] that bullet is already in the chamber
[1:43:53] all you got to do is be willing what do
[1:43:55] you say pull a bead on the devil
[1:43:57] you got a sickness pull a beat on it

[1:44:08] thy diseases

[1:44:11] i am the lord your deliverer
[1:44:14] he'll deliver you he'll deliver your
[1:44:16] loved ones the promise is already loaded
[1:44:18] in the chamber
[1:44:20] all you've got to be willing to do is
[1:44:21] pull the gun off of the shelf
[1:44:24] pull it off the wall and start acting on
[1:44:27] it
[1:44:28] the lord will meet you the promise see
[1:44:31] the promise that moses had
[1:44:34] moses upset you you're the deliverer it
[1:44:37] would have done no good if he would have
[1:44:38] just remained in the wilderness
[1:44:40] but what did he do he took god at his
[1:44:42] word and he just started walking
[1:44:44] stick in his hand how did brother braham
[1:44:47] described it he said
[1:44:48] he said his wife was on there pregnant
[1:44:50] with a child on her hip
[1:44:51] everything just going down in the desert

[1:44:54] take over
[1:44:55] how's it going to happen i don't know
[1:44:57] all i know is that god told me
[1:45:00] and all i know is i could do what he
[1:45:01] said that's all we're looking to do
[1:45:05] the devil says how's it going to happen
[1:45:07] i don't know all i know is what the word
[1:45:09] says
[1:45:12] that's and that's our i like brother
[1:45:14] matthew said that and that's been on my
[1:45:16] heart it's like
[1:45:17] i just read that about that single eye
[1:45:20] that focus of if your eye is single
[1:45:23] then your whole body is full of light
[1:45:25] let's put the focus on the word of god
[1:45:28] don't look at the symptoms don't look at
[1:45:30] the situations
[1:45:31] god is a complete everything's on his
[1:45:34] time anyway

[1:46:15] of your word
[1:46:17] but lord i've just let it sit on the on
[1:46:19] the sidelines for so long

[1:46:26] looking at the situations
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:31] and put you in a corner and said oh i

[1:46:34] good enough for the lord to do it it's
[1:46:35] not about you anyway
[1:46:37] it's not about your ability it's about
[1:46:41] his ability and he already finished the
[1:46:42] work

[1:46:51] of you would just raise your hand and
[1:46:52] say lord i want to be willing to take

[2:02:03] of the lord
[2:02:04] is just so good i hope you just really
[2:02:07] encouraged your heart tonight you know
[2:02:10] you'll
[2:02:10] you'll never know the effect that you
[2:02:14] can have in somebody else's life
[2:02:18] you know i mean just the word that you
[2:02:21] say
[2:02:21] just the kindness that you show
[2:02:25] you could really make a difference and i
[2:02:28] brother ham so many times said i'm just
[2:02:31] here to help somebody along the way
[2:02:34] you know just a sojourner along the way
[2:02:36] and if we could
[2:02:38] just fearlessly let our light shine and
[2:02:42] fearlessly stand up for what we believe
[2:02:48] they will see i may read this statement
[2:02:52] monday but
[2:02:53] i mean sunday morning but brother
[2:02:57] branham said when
[2:02:59] pharaoh saw moses standing in front of
[2:03:02] him with a stick
[2:03:06] saying let my people go
[2:03:09] [Music]
[2:03:10] pharaoh knew that moses believed
[2:03:17] believed in what that he was doing
[2:03:21] or trying to do
[2:03:24] he looked at him and said this guy must
[2:03:26] really believe what he's
[2:03:28] believing amen
[2:03:31] but he had god on his side and don't
[2:03:34] don't forget that
[2:03:36] amen just such a sweet spirit of the
[2:03:39] lord
[2:03:40] is we want to remember john beale's
[2:03:43] wife in prayer she's
[2:03:47] very very very ill and
[2:03:52] i believe she's on some form of
[2:03:55] respirator
[2:03:56] and they they want to
[2:04:02] you know stop any treatment
[2:04:06] and you know i just i
[2:04:10] hate to have anybody be in that
[2:04:11] situation
[2:04:13] where they have to make that decision
[2:04:16] so i said brother john just give it a
[2:04:19] few days and we'll see what the lord
[2:04:21] will do
[2:04:22] so we just want the lord if he would
[2:04:25] kindly
[2:04:26] be merciful to us just to come and
[2:04:29] undertake in the way of his will
[2:04:32] you know brother branham said that if if
[2:04:34] god wants to take you home
[2:04:37] there's not enough doctors in medicine
[2:04:39] in the world to keep you here
[2:04:41] he says but if god wants to keep you
[2:04:44] here there's not enough sickness in the
[2:04:46] world to take you out
[2:04:49] so just like our brother said tonight i
[2:04:51] think it's that whole consciousness
[2:04:54] of us giving god the preeminence in our
[2:04:56] lives
[2:04:57] i want to pray this any other
[2:05:00] maybe you have a prayer request maybe
[2:05:02] not for yourself but for somebody else
[2:05:05] that you'd like to see the lord
[2:05:07] touch and you'd like to lift your hand
[2:05:08] on their behalf
[2:05:10] of a loved one or someone that you're
[2:05:13] concerned about
[2:05:15] that you would love to have them know
[2:05:17] the lord or
[2:05:18] you would love for them to be touched by
[2:05:21] the hand of the lord
[2:05:23] okay we're not praying for ourselves
[2:05:24] we're praying for the people now
[2:05:27] that you have on your heart and we're
[2:05:29] bringing these people
[2:05:31] before the throne of the lord and asking
[2:05:34] the lord to be
[2:05:35] mindful of them and to reach down his
[2:05:38] mercies
[2:05:39] and his tender hand to their lives
[2:05:44] heavenly father the people have loved
[2:05:48] ones on their heart

[2:06:10] situation father they may be lost in
[2:06:15] without you
[2:06:17] lord and they just need that
[2:06:21] move of your spirit in their life to
[2:06:24] bring them back home
[2:06:26] father they may be sick
[2:06:31] and the sickness is keeping them from
[2:06:34] living for you
[2:06:35] the way that they would desire to father
[2:06:40] father some might be in a financial
[2:06:42] place
