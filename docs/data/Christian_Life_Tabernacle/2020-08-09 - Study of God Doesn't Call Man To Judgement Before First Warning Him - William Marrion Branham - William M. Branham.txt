[Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] god [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] amen amen i saw this eye this morning that we may open our hearts and the word may come and bring about the change that we have need of amen but identify if we could just come and open our service in prayer amen about heart how do you have a heavenly father it is a privilege to be found in the house this morning like we're just saying that word that was handed down to us came to sacrifice oh jai heavenly father we don't want to take this word for granted but we want to put our shoulder to the wheel for the third rest of your kingdom we want to be the front worker frontline worker to further your kingdom in this place we're so grateful for what you've done for us we came to hear this word we pray that the world may come forth today and that the word may clean us that the word of your word may wash our soul from everything that not that's not pleasing you your heavenly father we come to you this morning because you told us you made us to come you said come to us come to me you will have heavy legged and burden i will give you peace and grace god we pray that you may give us your peace you may give us your rest this day in this dark hour that we're living in we commit this service into the hand the singing of the song the preaching of the world we commit everything on into your hand that you may have the preeminence in everything that you may come and speak to us thank you heavenly father for what you've done in this hour in jesus name we pray amen amen amen happy to be gathered in the presence of god i want to welcome everyone amen those that are online we welcome you to this morning as you invite me to mike for our song writing this morning god bless you good morning you know i appreciate about the word of god is it's so very precise every single word every specific phrase is specifically set up by the lord to make something very plain about himself we want to look at psalm 99 this morning you know there's a verse in there statement it's in psalm 99 verse 5 and it's one of these words and it says exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy you know the footstool of the lord is only mentioned a handful of times in the scriptures you know he has a throne and he has a footstool you know the throne is the place where he sits but he has a footstool while he sits on that throne in isaiah 66 1 it says thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool you know and in matthew 5 jesus said but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is god's throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool right you know what's also interesting about this is as we read here in psalm 99 it's also a place of worship so not only is it the earth but it's a place of worship in in psalm 132 7 david said this we will go into his tabernacles we will worship at his footstool and in first chronicles 28 2 when david was talking with all of his all of his rulers about his desire to build a temple he said hear me my brethren and my people for as for me i had in mine heart to build and house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the footstool of our god and had made ready for the building so it's both the footstool is both the earth and a place of worship you know what is this footstool what is this earth you know that it speaks about this this this place of worship you know we're all familiar with the story in john 4 of where jesus met the woman at the well it's one of my favorite stories in scripture she comes in contact with her seventh man you know and as he as she begins to realize who this is the first question out of her mouth is she wants to try to figure out what's the right way to worship she says you know my people say that you worship in this place in this way and this type of thing the jews say that we worship in this place in this type of thing you know and he says that worship isn't in either one of those places right he says he says in verse 23 of john 4 he says the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth you know the true worshiper worships him in spirit and truth you know it's it's interesting that it's not a place physical place it's not a building right it's not a song service or an atmosphere that you put in a building or even a style of praise worship is a condition right where a true worshiper finds himself in it's where worship is the merger of the worshipper with the word right it says that in it says in ephesians it says the sword of the spirit is the word of god so spirit is the word and then in john 17 jesus says thy word is truth so truth is word so the true worshiper will worship him and spirit it in truth by the word right you know you think about that that if you think about what it is to really be a work true worshiper it's where your identity your thoughts your actions everything is completely taken over by him and the only image that you represent it's that place where if you've seen me you see the father right you know so it's a worshiper is where the earth this earth becomes the word where you lose your own life and you become his image a leaving living breathing continuous memorial of him his footstool right so how many of you would desire to be his footstool to be his place of worship on the earth right exalt ye the lord or exalty the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy let's read psalm 99 together the lord reigneth let your people tremble he sitteth between the cherubims let the earth be moved the lord is great in zion and he is high above all the people let them praise thy great and terrible name for it is holy the king's strength also loveth judgment thou dost establish equity thou execute his judgment and righteousness in jacob exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy moses and aaron among his priests and samuel among them that call upon his name they called upon the lord and he answered them he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar they kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them thou answer is to him o lord our god thou was the god that forgave us them though thou took us vengeance on their inventions exalt the lord our god and worship at his holy hill for the lord our god is holy amen god bless you may have

god bless you may be seated this morning it's good to be in the house of the lord and we want to just once again say that september 6 we will be resuming our sunday evening services along with our foot washing service and and so we will just uh proceed forward starting on the 6th then uh this coming week you notice we've started to do a little bit of work on the property next door and uh this coming week we're gonna add some uh temporary paving along where the dirt is out there and so we'll add a little more parking for you so anyway we're working on a few things on your behalf as we are waiting for the final uh uh plat approval from the city so we would certainly like that do we have a baby dedication or anything this morning okay i'm not gonna sing so god bless you musicians so much enjoyed the singing this morning you know i'm going to do a little something this morning that we haven't maybe done very much of we've always played just a small portion of tape but this morning i'm going to play a little longer portion of tape this morning because i i honestly feel in my heart and and it came upon my heart and and and then i listen to the the message and many times i'll listen to a message and find certain parts in it that i want to emphasize and i feel the holy spirit's leading me to emphasize well i really felt led to that he just pressed upon me to play the whole portion and that's always difficult for me when that happens because i know that we have interpreters and the interpreters are trying to interpret i know many times people bring visitors to church and and they say well we'd like you know to have you hear our pastor or we would like um uh you know something from that standpoint something with people and i know a lot of people say well i can listen at home and and there's many different things that that come up again so every time i feel led to to do a certain i feel compelled believe me there's a lot of things that start popping up you know what i mean and and then i start finding myself trying to battle and and and come up with reasoning but you know what i thought my heart the most if god tells me to do it and i do it then god will be here to stand behind his word and this this message is that we're going to play is called god doesn't call man to judgment without warning first it's also been referred to as warning and then judgment but this there is such a tremendous understanding and teaching in this tape and remember that god's always hid in simplicity and so i'm just going to read just a few quotes pretty and and just kind of uh to to just say some of the things so that you could be listening to them so it's about an hour and if we could just focus for an hour just put yourself in the story listen to the word of god and and it's it's uh it's a tremendous thing and where we're going to start is in isaiah the 38th chapter and and this is the story of hezekiah and we're going to read from there and and these are just some of the statements that the prophet of god makes in uh this message that i i'd like us to be able to hear he says and that's the way it is with people we've all the body of christ has has got to be in their position in harmony and then we can look around and see what time of day it is then and then worlds are looking to see what it is see but we're but they're watching you and you've just a little hairspring mainspring or whatever you are you do the very best job you can at that and and i hope that when when we come to hear that portion that it strikes he says the world today is just like hezekiah was then it's been warned it's constantly being warned the church is being warned and now these things just don't happen by chance they've got something behind them now let me tell you what's going on just doesn't happen by chance it's got something going on behind it and and i sincerely believe that it is a warning that god is warning the church because men's thinking the decisions that they're making that this great pressure economically and let me tell you our government spent billions of dollars and sent lots of people money to postpone the effect of the economy but let me tell you that the effect is still there all they've done is pushed it down the road okay but the struggles and the hardships are coming i would like to tell you something else you know what i mean but you you don't you don't shut down thousands of businesses thousands of restaurants thousands of retail stores you don't cut travel in this country in half and then expect everybody to have something so i i you know all i can do is if i could tell you the wolves are coming the wolves are coming but you as an individual have to have your heart in the right place with god and this message is a message that reaches out to god's children and set tells them god has warned this nation over and over and over again and judgments are coming and you have a part to play you don't run from the judgments you have a part to play in the judgment and it's very important that each of us find our plot i know what we'd all like to do is go hide in the woods somewhere right you know you know can you imagine me coming up and saying well church i just feel that i'm going to take a couple years off and go out this san diego and stay with my mother and just fish on the ocean for two years and not do anything but go fishing for two years man that sounds good but that's just the same thing as burying your talent no we're soldiers amen we're here to be a soldier he makes this statement nineveh was a great fishing industry there and the people fished and they must have had a great sinful country there plenty of money and where money is plentiful the people are in a popular opinion of the day sin always sets in and violence i mean how greater a warning when you see a popular opinion come in the way that they're going and i'm not a politician i'm not here to try to get you to vote one way or the other that's not my job but my job is to tell you the gospel and we see the idea of this very scriptures itself says that god has put men in authority in law enforcement to carry out the judgments of god against the wicked and we find out that they want to eliminate that and and it becomes the popular opinion and wherever there's a popular opinion sin rises the murder rate rises the burglary rises violent climb rhine and violence comes in that is a warning that that is a warning it it it it is it is definitely speaking to certain things that are are transpiring and we can see that and that's always been the sign when you see these things coming know that the day of the lord is at hand and and we don't want to get dull on that he says so you know god's able to do great things if we'll just listen at him and that was a complaint that god always had is that the people became dull of hearing you know what i mean because in others we sit down and we listen to a tape and we say i heard that tape before i know what's in it and and we don't listen at it we don't say okay the holy spirit wants us to hear this this morning he wants us to take heed to it there's a message in it there's a message for the country there's a message for the body and there's a message for the individual i want to hear all three and he says see he make he'll make he'll make he'll make ways where there is no way he is the way and when the message is absolutely urgent as it is today god provides a way amen it's urgent and then this uh other statement i'd like to read because i uh this is one of the main things that i want us to understand this morning as we listen to this and this is something that's very important that you comprehend especially when there's going to be so much criticism against the messenger because of time but listen to this very carefully and then the brothers will start what we'll do is we'll just stand and we'll listen to the scripture and then we'll be seated he says a prophet foresees way off see the things that is coming he sees the cup of god's wrath full before it's filled see he can say thus saith the lord god will destroy this city except you repent why he's an eagle he rides way up in yonder see and he looks away off there and he sees that cup of breath poured out that's what the prophet's looking at he ain't looking at what's going on here he's looking yonder he says it's coming he can he can he can go so high until he can see that shade he says the world will be in dark darkness and gross darkness he's up high enough the sun's shining now but he sees that shade coming and he says what he's looking at it ain't here yet but it'll sure be here that's right it's going to be here gross darkness upon the people he knows it's coming years away yet he sees it amen that's why this message is a living message that's why we can play these tapes right now today and it's not oh i'd rather have live preaching or i'd like to have something what you're going to hear is what a prophet saw coming and i can say not only did he see it coming and we haven't recorded what he saw coming but that shade is finally upon us and there was a warning in it of a quick turn of repentance back to god and so i i believe with all my heart church i i i just can't get away from it you know i believe in the fivefold ministry brother branham explains the fivefold ministry but we received a message from god because god doesn't call man to judgment without warning him first and it it it it really should set in our heart that this message was a gift of god warning us that this world has turned away from god it's entered into a complete apostasy it no longer wants to retain god in its knowledge and what's waiting for them is judgment but there's something also waiting for us and he said every believer looks for the pending judgment and the escape please let this message teach your heart this morning i know it's hard for the interpreters i know maybe it's hard for a visitor this morning that might not understand the promises of malachi 4 5 and luke 17 30 but for us this morning this is life so let's stand together and open our bibles and listen to what the prophet of god begins to talk about your position your responsibility and the thing stay with it and follow it through if you have your cell phone and maybe you can find the message in french feel free to take your cell phones and find the message in french or spanish if you can read along uh just be very free to do that this morning and anyway as we turn into this isaiah the 38th chapter and uh and we'll listen as the as we hear the great uh word of god this morning so god bless you brothers if you would begin to pray sit back and enjoy the word of the lord and i just hope you have confidence in this morning that the lord's led me to do this god bless you now my uh sight falls upon a texture of isaiah isaiah 38. let's read over to isaiah isaiah 38 in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amos came unto him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shall die and not live then hezekiah turned his face towards the wall and prayed unto the lord and said remember me oh lord i beseech thee i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezek hezekiah wept sore then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i've heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days 15 years may the lord add his blessings to this reading it's a very uh outstanding uh subject for a short message here i believe i want to call it god doesn't call man to judgment without first warning amen and we are we're we're it gets the the background or the platform of it here and this text tonight god warning man before bringing him to uh is death now every one has this we might say well this fellow died without a warning no no no god never you don't know what was that man's heart you don't know what's been going on in his life see god never brings any man to his death without first warning about it tell him it's something of preparation god is is sovereign and he he knocks at the heart of every man giving him the opportunity to come now he might ward away and turn it down and and shake his head to it and walk away so it's just a funny feeling i'll get over it but anyhow it was god god speaking to him amen and god never even brings judgment upon the earth without first giving the people a warning god never does nothing without declaring it first what he's going to do and he gives people a choice and you can you can do right or wrong that's his see god can never change his nature his program can never change from what he started with because he's infinite in his program and his ideas are all perfect so if he would change it that would show that he'd learn more so being infinite he cannot learn more his his first his first decision is always perfect and there's nothing can ever change it then god before a man ever was put uh had a chance to do wrong god put him on the basis to where he could accept our deny he could receive or or not say by the way if that minister in here brother baker uh i believe was on the the interviews the other day i've got these questions that he had rolled out for me on the serpent seed i got him a laying back here now if he's sure why well i don't see him anywhere right at the present time but it sure he and his wife a very fine man and a woman but they they couldn't understand a few things about the teaching of the serpent seed how that that some questions about what i'd said in sermons beyond that and and talking about the the impregnation and so forth but uh uh then it's just like a a brother a fine man just a christian for a couple years or two but just didn't understand you see it's hard if you don't you have to depend on the holy spirit because this bible is rotten riddles you just can't sit down and read like a newspaper it's hid yes sir how would you ever justify god when he told moses uh up there said uh now don't you make any engraving images in his commandments don't you make anything like heaven any any angel or anything else don't make any engraving images and yet on the same day told him to mold to angels out of brass and put them right at the mercy seat where mercy's at you have to know god in his nature before you can understand his word he he he has a key to that word himself and he he's the only one can handle it open it and so he's the one has to reveal it and now we find out that is nature wash here that always to warn a man before judgment the warning nation before judgment and so forth he always gives his warning a reminder to we of a responsibility we are responsible and god is punisher on the earth for a reason and that reason that he is punisher for we are responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do if you don't if you went to work for a man he'd give you a job on a ranch or something other than you just went out to the barn and just sit down out there and say well see you must go ask him what he wants you to do and then do it if you're working for a man find out what your duties is and then if our life is on the the earth here then we should go to the one who punisher lord what would you have me do what what must i do why am i here if it's to be a housewife dishwasher if it's to be whatever god wants you to do then you do that the very best that you know how to do it no matter how little no matter how little it is you must do it you say well the trouble of it is each one of us wants to do the next man's job we all want to pack the ball as we say you see like this watch here now every little movement in there has its place now every part of it can't be the hands now i only look at the hand to see what time it is but if one of them little wheels in there gets out of order that won't keep the right time that's the way it is with people we've all the body of christ has got to be in their position and harmony see and then we can look around and see what time of day it is see then the world's looking to see what it is see but they're watching you and if you're just a little hairspring mainspring or whatever you are you do the very best job you can at that now because we have a responsibility that we've got to answer to god someday for every man that come on to face the earth has to answer to god for our responsibility and to many of us a stewardship we have to answer for we this responsibility is a stewardship that's been committed to us by god i don't care what it is as i said a few moments ago a housewife then be a genuine housewife that's right if it's to be a farmer be a genuine farmer whatever it is that god has put you to do you got a stewardship to that you've got to answer to god for because it takes all these things to do it hezekiah was told to make ready to get ready because that he had to meet his maker hezekiah was a king and a great man do you notice his plea here lord i beseech you to consider me i've walked before you with a perfect heart what a testimony that is to to us today this should be a man that walks before god even death was pronounced upon the man and yet god changed his mind about him because hezekiah wanted to do something and god said he would give us the desires of our heart and hezekiah's time had come and he got a cancer on him or something other and they call it a bar on that day but we know borah don't regularly kill you they just get well but it's perhaps a cancer and it opened up like a boil and and god told isaiah said go up there and tell him that he's going to die and hezekiah had something he wanted to do yet he yet yet when you plead anything to god you got to be a reason for it it's just like this scripture that is so often referred to if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you said now that's all together controlled on motive and objective thing or it won't happen so you just can't go out here that's where many of us makes uh many mistakes is going on saying i'll show you i got faith to do this now you're wrong to begin with god don't give you gifts just to play with it as i was saying a while ago they don't show you visions just to play with that's nothing to play with that's sacred just use it in as the lord will let you be a prisoner to him no matter how much you want to tell that guy is wrong and what this the other you hold still to god says so then when god says so then you can come with thus saith the lord and tell that just forget about him the the world today just like hezekiah was then it's been warned it's constantly being warned the church is being warned and now these things just don't happen by uh by a chance they've all got something behind him now hezekiah being sick having this bar that wasn't by chance god sent isaiah up there and told him to set his house in order now because he's going to die in hezekiah wept and told god i walk before the perfect heart and i i pray you spare my life for a cause a good cause the cause of god god told the prophet said go back and tell him now isn't that strange hezekiah was the greatest man in the land hezekiah was a king and a godly man he was a real man if he could plead that before god and god didn't rebuke him far i've walked before you with a perfect heart now that's a saying a whole lot and god never said no hezekiah you didn't do it but he admitted he did do it and he said i'm going to i'm going to spare your life a little longer see i'm going to give you a request see because he had been a just man he had been a a real servant to christ and then we feel that we have a right to ask something if if our objective is right and then our motive to it now we see today that for the past many years i'd say for the past 15 to more years that constantly there's been a warning out across the nation repent our parish you notice i was talking today to the wife just uh early this morning and i uh early breakfast we were setting a table talking before i left i said wife uh she's talking about billy graham and about his wife is how common and everything they tried to live i said that is a real servant when he tries not when he man maybe he makes two or three million a year out in his campaigns but he doesn't receive it his foundation takes it placing it back into the work and the broadcast and so forth and billy gets about 25 000 years she said how would he ever spend 25 000 here i said he he takes just what he has to have that's all he's got a home to pay for everything that went on i said i've got lots of respects for billy graham i said because he has a message and that message is repentance and i i'll tell you there's nobody and i know of in the lands today that god is used with that message like billy graham oh he's got a down pat he just stands there and i mean he calls them politicians and church members to your repentance but that's as far as he goes and here comes uh brother oral roberts another great servant of the lord and there's nobody that comes out there and compared with oral roberts that bulldog grip of if uh just casting out evil spirits and calling the name of the lord and and little sensations and so forth about divine healing that's exactly right there is a messenger to the pentecost there is a messenger to the church denominational world see and the coal world and then look around at our own little humble ministry standing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you see what's that doing calling that bride group you see hallelujah it calls from both those groups it's taking a wheel out of the wheel you see what i mean and then god confirms that message that billy graham preaches god heals the sick by oral robert's prayers and god produces the things that jesus proved that jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever and it's calling those things it's messages of the hour and each one of those messages is calling repent or perish that's right repent or perish there's no hopes it's all gone world's warned of his coming each one of the messages speaks and warns of the coming of the lord jesus both through the church denial remember god's always in threes like father son and holy ghost and justification bap and sanctification baptism holy ghost so forth these and threes now god is that message of repentance to the church nominal god's in that message of divine healing to the church pentecostal god's in the message to the bride amen so we find out that all of them calling one to this this to that and that's that god calling the church out of the world the calling the church in the nominal church into pentecost and calling the bride out of pentecost see like luther wesley and now see it says oh perfectly typed up and there's no mistake about it i've hid all around the ends of it and sides of it inside and outside of it and showed it by the scripture and the chronology of it till we know that it's absolutely the truth there's no mistake sunday i hope that god sinks it so deep that you'll never be able to get away from it sing now god giving warning prepare for a judgment the atomic bombs are in the hangars everything's setting ready and god before he can let this thing happen he makes a call down to like he did in sodom come out of it get ready there's something going to happen like in the days of noah before god sent the waters to destroy the world in the great andaluvian world that had come off into sin as jesus clearly said that it was a day just like this as it was in the days of noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man how that uh the women on the rampage and and marrying and giving in marriage and and the great scientific achievements and the smart educated going into the intellectual sides and the little humble flock setting off to one side waiting the pending judgment and the escape and before god set that judgment he set a prophet just like you did to hezekiah said get ready for the judgments are ready to fall and he made the people ready for the time noah made the people ready and it was a call of mercy before judgment nineveh was made to know before their time god looked down to nineveh and he said i'm i'm just sick and tired of these things i i understand that if the though that great heathen gentile world their city as it was in them days it judged them by sitting outside nations now after the population spread the way it has he said that great cities give over all together to sin and god before he would send judgment he sent a warning message come out of it get it right watch the prophet never said nothing but but to get said within 40 days this city will be destroyed and all how sometimes it's hard to do such things is that to tell people if the prophet don't watch he'll get in trouble because he'll kind of go off to one side try to make it easier compromise a little bit here in a little bit there but the real prophets got the order from god should never compromise nothing he should absolutely lay it right on the line that's the reason he used the spirit of elijah so much see because at that spirit always carried out his orders you see it brought his orders just exactly what it was and always a come back to the word i think always or bring him back to the word now we find nineveh in sin and the prophet was heston because it was a gentile worlds he is a gentile nation a gentile people not his own it wasn't hebrews they were gentiles a great uh ship commercial sea port that nineveh was great fishing uh industrial there the people fished and and the they had must have had a great sinful country there plenty of money and and more money is plentiful and people are in the popular opinion of the day sin always sets in and violence god was tired of it so he had a prophet in the land so he said to his prophet go down there to nineveh and cry out and say within 40 days the city is going to be destroyed now jonah thought now you know i might get in a little trouble so he wanted to be more sure so he thought he'd take a little vacation and go down to tarshish and we found out that the there's just 40 days left see so the message is urgent the time is at hand don't play around with other things and get a bachelor of art degree and find out something the hour is at hand so it's a matter of people today we're trying to build up big schools and have big things like that when mercy why if we preach the coming of the lord what do we need we're schools we need repentance towards god amen like hudson taylor said to the young missionary he said a young chinese boy come to him and said mr taylor said the lord jesus says fill me with his spirit said i'm so happy said shall i take 10 years now and get my degrees and so forth he said son don't wait for degrees if the candle's lit go tell it go tell it don't wait for degrees oh you'll be half burnt out before you get on with your degrees that's when it's lit if you don't know nothing else just tell how i got lit just don't try to take somebody else's place or something place where you know let's tell what you know to be the truth this is the way it come on me and this is how i feel about it that's if you don't know any more than that say that let's go the message is urgent the time is at hand and what if isaiah and say well now i'll wait and see how he gets along with that barrel first you see see i i see god totally go up here and tell him right now and he told jonah to go oh my and money got out there in that ocean and that deep sea and and the ship got stalled in a storm that harshed up the sails and turned around around they wonder what the world was the matter out there but they couldn't make out looked like the thing getting waterlogged and every man calling on his god and first thing you know jonah was on his vacation so he thought he might as well sleep he must went out in the book head of the ship and laying up there his feet propped up asleep and he said awake old slugger and call upon your god and jonah knew what was wrong so does every man know what's wrong today hey and he said it's all my fault take me and buy my hands and throw me out in the sea and then this trouble i let up and they were kind of a gentleman like bunch of fellas and they didn't want to do that but they found out he was a prophet and knowed what he was talking about he said i thought i'd take my vacation first but but the lord don't want me to take this vacation i got to get down there i got a job to do i thought i'd rest up a little bit before it went but i gotta go the the message is urgent i got to get there i'd imagine when that certain prepared fish uh got uh jonah down in his stomach he'd done about face and throat water all over the country and tuck out for an end of as hard as he could go god was taking that message over there and that certain prepared fish and he took out for nineveh just as hard as he could go because he he had the messenger board and he had to get him over there he took the wrong but god had provided a ship for him so you know god's able to do great things if we're just listening and see he'll make he'll make ways where there is no way he is the way and when the message is absolutely urgent as it is today god provides a way we notice again when amos i preached on this fellow amos if you'd like to read the story sometimes it's great read the story of amos first a chapter of amos he's another type of the the warnings before judgment strikes sin now um the city that he was uh going to warn against over there was a bunch of jews that they all got kindly off of the beaten line and become a great tourist center and i imagine as i give the illustration that morning speaking on him that when his ball head come up over the top of the hill his little eyes narrow it as he looked down seeing the sin of that great nation and people uh his white beard as he fingered it like that my what a thing but nobody knows where he come from nobody knows those prophets they just rise up from somewhere and go the same way but he went into the city with thus saith the lord repent or perish or god will destroy this nation he'll he'll wipe this place off of the earth you've made an agreement with your enemy and you're you're at peace you think with your enemy but all the time the assyrians are are building up out there you can't walk to the other unless you'd be agreed that's all so always god wants us to separate ourselves he wants us to come out from the world not try to live with the world and god too not try to fascinate the world after god you have to live for one or the other you have to believe one or the other now we find out that this amos he certainly predicted a judgment upon this people except they repented and mine so so well does it fit our day i think this great city as looking back to this again the great city down there how that is all give over and and a great uh an economy they had of everything prosperous and they thought they were just exactly in the will of the lord because they were prospering but they found out that god is not always the author of prosperity no god sometimes when prosperity strikes the church usually gets away from him you know god spoke of israel one time so they found your blood in the field and washed you up and brought you in to be his own child and then when he got big and a beautiful young woman you played the part of he said you you just give yourself to every passer by see but when you were poor and needy when you had need you serve me but when i blessed you and gave you plenty then you went away from me and it's just about proved that way oh my now we find out that this prophet really struck down on that nation this amos he's just a plow boy but we find out that when he did struck down and told him what it would be and told him that they didn't get right with god that the enemy that they had taken in partnership would be the very one that destroyed them now we find out that our proud america is not going to escape the wrath of god as i spoke one day since i've been here i'm sure it was your uh of the everything at the end you know i can't see nothing to build to you can't build a politics it's gone you you can't build uh to uh social life because it's so demoralized there's there's nothing that you can build to there and uh you can't put no hopes to nothing how about the church well you can't deal with the church it's so firmly gone there's nothing left they've done sold out their birthrights for a mess of potting and they're just waiting judgment the holy spirit has crossed this nation showing his signs and wonders they continually spurn his grace he vindicates himself and proves by his great a vindication that he's a word of god manifested in this day and they still turn it down there's nothing left now you just can't always do that to god see all right we find out the first he sends his prophets with warning he doesn't change his way his method of doing things he does not always strike when he warns i want you to watch this quotation god gives a warning but he don't always strike the same time he warns did you notice that amen and then when he doesn't strike when he sends a warning then the prophet is mocked you didn't have it you told a lie amen you wasn't right that this same thing might have been said to isaiah what do you think that man thought when he went up there and prophesied the king was going to die then come back down and say no he's going to live what about jonah going through the streets saying oh this city is going to be destroyed within so many days 40 days and then god didn't do it see you have to watch god don't always strikes when he warns but he uh here's one thing then the prophet is mocked but if he is a vindicated prophet with the word of the lord see signs of god vindicated as god said the prophet would be vindicated which these men were see his word is not his but it's god's and it will come to pass it's got to come to pass if it's god's word only one thing can stop it that's a quick repentance notice amos he he lived to see his prophecy but when amos spoke of that city how it was going to happen how god was going to cause the syrians come in and take them over and so forth like that how their own corruption would eat them up well i believe if it's right now i'm looking down here upon the scripture and if i've got this counted right it's around about 50 years after amos prophesied and now what do you think a whole generation passed before amos's prophecy come to pass but if you'll read over here it tells you and it happened just exactly word by word what he's saying amen john saw the book of revelations it never happened in his day but we see it coming to pass just exactly daniel prophesied of the day of his day and all down through he never lived to see it he said go your way daniel shut up the book and close the book but you'll sleep in your life but at that day you'll stand see now i see you god always god strikes as soon as he prophesies amos prophecy as i said was 50 years later it come to pass but it did come to pass that the prophet is uh is a of the bible a real genuine prophet is a special uh a person not a specialty any different from anybody else but he's got a special job see in having a special commission he's got to be special a little out of the way from the others in order to do that it's just like god likes his prophets to be an eagle now eagle is a special bird he's just a bird but he's a special bird and he can fly higher than other birds he can see farther than other birds and now in order to go higher he's got to be built so he can go higher and what good would it do to go up there unless he could see what he was doing that you got up there see so it has to be a special built bird see he's kind of in the hawk family is a ripper with the bill and he eats uh uh many of them are scavengers it's about 40 different kinds of eagles but you see in the church there is a pastor and that pastor is a special person he's built to where he can uh he can put up with the fusses of the people he's a burden barrier he's the ox of the team he's a man that can sit down when the somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and take neither side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things the evangelist is a special man he's a man that's burning like a fireball he runs into a city and preaches his message and gets out of there somewhere else see he's a special man the teacher is a special man he sets back under the anointing of the spirit it's able to take the words and put them together by the holy spirit that the pastor advances either one could not compare with him and then we find out the apostle is a special man he's a he's a saturn order he's a man that's sent from god to set the things in order the prophet is a special man a prophet is a man of whom the word of the lord comes to because the prophet is so designed life that his subconscious and his first conscience is so close together that he doesn't go to sleep to dream his dream he sees it when he's wide awake now that's something god has to do see he sees what's going a prophet four seas way off see the things that is coming uh uh he sees the cup of god's wrath full before it is filled he can say just saith the lord god will destroy this city except you repent why he's an eagle he rides way in the honor see and he looks way off there and he sees that cup of wrath poured out that's what the prophet's looking at he ain't looking what's going on here he's looking younger he's saying it's a coming he can go so high until you see that shade he said the world will be dark darkness and gross darkness he's up high enough the sun's shining now but he sees that shade coming and he's he's he's saying what he's looking at amen it ain't here yet but it'll surely be here that's right it's going to be here gross darkness upon the people he knows it's coming years away yet he sees it amos that anointed prophet of god he saw the darkness and the judgment he's seen syria come down with their chariots and sweep to their slaughter them people out he saw it coming and the judgment of god upon him now 50 years before it happened but to see being a prophet he was lifted up into the spirit and he saw it far off see he saw the cup full before it was filled like abraham god told abraham your seed shall come into this country and sojourn here for 400 years and then i'll bring him out with a mighty hand because the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full see god knew that cup was going to fill up he's speaking with his prophet he told him i you see that cup of the amorites down there see but their iniquity's not filled up yet abraham don't say anything about it now hold off but it will come and when their cups filled up then 400 years i'll draw them out like locust is before you and i'll establish your seed here in this land amen that's the prophet of the lord now when he speaks of his vision whether it's wrath or whether it's healing it may linger but it's got to come to pass if he speaks it in the name of the lord it might be a blessing that he speaks for you he might tell you a certain thing you can't see it at all you say how can it be what's uh uh he told me thus saith the lord this is gonna happen that was gonna happen and it ain't happening the man's wrong now you'll be judged for disbelieving it but it's gonna happen anyhow got to happen thought anger in the bible said yet will it speak in a season it'll come to be the prophet's only looking off and seeing something he's talking about what he's looking at he ain't thinking about it yeah what you look like now he's looking what it's going to be and when he speaks that if it's in the word of the lord it's already been spoken there's nothing in the world can stop it you see that's right only god himself notice now we find that when he speaks his vision the prophet does now sometimes he speaks good things he speaks of your healing all right you might think it just can't happen i haven't got any better then what does that do that this brings the judgments of god upon you that's right see jesus promised to save you if you believe it if you don't believe it it won't it won't happen to you you've got to accept that you got to believe it hey and you got to know from where it comes from that gives your faith in god are your prophet see you've got to believe it and now we find out here that these prophets have spoke they they spoke and what they said come to pass if the wrath of god is poured upon the people there's only one thing if that prophet says that something other is going to happen there's only one thing that'll stay the hand of god that's repentance that's repentance towards god that stays his wrath now don't wait for it do it then god says anything you do at la then hezekiah as soon as he knew he's a good man but god said your time has come hezekiah and i i must take you i i want to i'm going to take you out put all your house in order and he he said it'll take me 15 years to do that lord uh it's you i i know i'm going but it's going to take me 15 years to put my house in order i can't do it right now i haven't got the time to do it i i just can't get it done lord let me live another 15 years so i can get this thing done i can't put my house see god's commission was put your house in order and hezekiah said i can't do it this year it's going to take me time i take this back and make this up and take it over this fellow here i take me 15 years to do it just spare me to do it let me let me give me a little time to do it see then god said i'll i'll be lenient but he had to die anyhow and begin it took his time he backslid during that time see it it'd be better if it went on without it being set in order that's right but he gave him 15 years longer to put his house in order because quickly what did he do he said lord i'm slow i need 15 years to do this you commission me to put my house in order i can't do it for 15 years because i got a loan here and i got this over here and i got this over here to do now he was a godly man and god's word's got to happen anyhow it's going to come to pass anyhow but he just stayed it for a little while see hold it off to him then he done a sin during that time he said i won't make you come up on him but i'll visit it up on his children after him you know the story now we find out that a quick repentance sometimes holds the wrath off a while now we find out that nineveh god said go down there and cry out to that city now and tell them if uh within 40 days the things go to fall and my did they ever repent as soon as they seen that prophet coming through the street saying thus saith the lord the place of fall within forty days the place will fall the even the king commanded a a fast to the country mourning put on sackcloth put ashes not upon your own head and upon your body and upon your flesh but upon your cattle upon your beasts to the field put ashes and sacko what a repentance now when we find out there we notice if the prophet don't watch real quick see get his wits together and go to god you'll find out something right there if you don't watch now look at isaiah he just spoke his prophecy went all back into his little wilderness hut and when he did the lord never spoke back to the king that was praying he has a way of doing things there's a prophet in the land the word of the lord comes to his prophet he went out there and said isaiah go back and tell him i have heard his prayers i have understood that he thinks it's going to take him 15 years to do this i seen his tears because he wanted to do the job so bad it's going to take him 15 years he said to do it go tell him i'll let him have it then see why he commissioned he commissioned isaiah to go tell him thus saith the lord then if there's any change in that or linger he's going to happen anyhow he died just the same but said if there's anything in that then he's obligated to come back to the man that he sent thus saith the lord to he told isaiah go back out there and tell you now jonah took a different attitude gets up on top of the hill and said why be good never was born and oh how he went on and god had a little gourd to come up make him some shade till he got cooled off up there but he said now here i went out there they're going to say i'm a false prophet and god spoke to him said look at that city down there look at our jonah that the whole city is repenting with sackcloth in ashes then he told him about the little gourd and the worm that cut it down one day the lord believed i'm going to come to the tabernacle and take a series just on joan oh there's so many great that east wind blowing and all oh my there's so many things in there just it's thrilling and look it's in there it's all types right it even brings jesus christ in it and everything else of course every line of the bible brings jesus christ yes sir that's our sunday's lesson so we'll let's find that the lord willing but notice these things that you if you're sincere and tell god now you have to watch i'm going to show you another joan in a platform tonight one night there was the people that come here the lady maybe some other people here tonight so i won't call the name you probably know who it is but they come here fine bunch of people from down in kentucky and they um they uh come here for years but the people being fine people good friends of mine wow they were they were real friends of mine but they just one of those kind of people when a revival was going on they could come to church when the revival was off and the load was pulling nobody to pull and all the children was here on the cradle roll they had when we had her classes and things and uh one day i come home about four years ago or five something like that and this young girl which is about eight years old when she's on the crater oh she'd been married and had two children and she was laying out in the hospital out here at the point of death she was about four months five with a baby and the baby had died and they couldn't operate because she had uremic and they couldn't operate so i had to let the mother die too can't operate and see the baby kill her like that so they had she was just dying that's all what no chance far i went out to see if she sent for me now i went into the hospital and there she was under oxygen tent i raised up a little flap talked to her a little bit and i said you remember me she said sure brother bill i remember you i said uh how is it the do you understand how sick you are she said i do so that's why i sent for you i said well why how is it with you in a large she said brother bill i i i i'm not ready to go well there we got down and prayed and her mother and her husband many of them in the room and the mother and husband started crying and and then i i asked her and she got right with god pay their vows and come back and make god the promise of she be forgiven how she loved him and sorry for her sins the way she lived and went on with her repentance and crying and after a while i got up and went out of the building and the next morning they called me up to come back out there and come to find out they come in that morning for a test and to see how the the uremic condition had advanced and found out she didn't have a speck of it it was all gone every bit of the uremic poison had left her the doctors were so excited that they said my well this don't it's something very strange said we're getting ready and said if it's still that way but in the morning say we keep giving her penicillin or whatever that's giving her to keep the infections down said we'll operate and take the dead baby before setting something else said if she's all right well two or three times that day they tested her again that night late they tested her nothing wrong perfectly all right and they prepped her talk around for the oxygen tent everything is fine it's going to operate on the next morning take the baby well i went out there and because that this was done i never knew it i never knew that the lord never told me nothing about you could ask the people if you wish so they she never said it would but oh my to see such a thing her husband being a sinner come over and said uh brother branham i want to give my life to the lord jesus and i said all right let's kneel down here take hold your wife's hand and then you walk this straight life together the mother come back she said brother bran you know hears me and my children said we've all been in and out in and out and around the tabernacle and things we sit and listen at you preach and we'll go up the altar and come back said i'm backstage to you brother brandon she said i want to come back to the lord jesus for his goodness to my child well you see that that's very nice but you don't come to the lord jesus because of that along towards midnight 12 1 o'clock her mother dozed off sleep she said called her said mother and she said yes honey what do you want she said you know i'm so happy she said i'm so glad of you being happy said i'm at peace with god and said oh how fine it is in a few minutes again she called back she said mother said yes said i'm going home and she said i know you are she said yes sweetheart said the doctor will take the baby tomorrow then about a day or two when your incisions heal up and get away from here you go back home and be happy again you and your hubby and little children and be a christian and live for god she said mother i mean i'm going on my heavenly home she said sure honey at the end of the journey she said this is the end of the journey or she said nah what's the matter said it the end of the journey so it said yes mother within a few minutes i'll be gone well she thought she just got nervous and hilarious she called the nurse the nurse taking her respiration everything is normal and within five minutes she was gone she was dead and then when i come back home and a week or two after that i think brother grimm preached the girl's funeral when i come back home and meet he told me that that girl died that night nah i couldn't i would see the mother yeah i i i don't know what caused me to do it but i said lord god you owe me an understanding after me going out there and and telling that husband and him coming to the lord after you've done these things for him and all that got and then take that girl's life like that i said you owe me understanding when you tell god something like that he'll leave you sitting alone i don't mean nothing i'm in debt to him well he just let me pout it out for a few days you know and after about three or four months one day i was out on the creek bank and the lord spoke to me in a vision and said now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not her time come the year before that when she was drowning in a creek on a picnic she should have went at that time but i had to take her when she was ready to go that's why all this happened why you went out there then i got down and cried i said lord jesus forgive me yours poor stupid servant i should have never said that lord now i went back down to the ladies little market street now i want to work two and i said i want to ask you a question she said sure brother bill and i said is it true that this girl uh uh almost actually that's right brother branham said her husband and they they had to get her out of the crick that said they had to use artificial respiration and prone pressure and they had to get a machine and pump the water out of her so she had her skirt on this having a picnic she was out there and stepped in some sand slipped off overhead and strangled in the water they didn't notice her and directly seen her coming up and going down and they're running and got her and brought her out and said she almost died said you i said that was her time to go see god knows what he's doing now the lord probably would have told me that if i had to take the attitude that i did lord you owe me to tell me about that he don't owe you nothing i stood at a meeting one night and heard a an evangelist uh praying for a sick person said god i command you to heal this person who command god see i it isn't it isn't even intelligent see uh because god he does what he wants to can the can the clay say to the potter why did you make me thus see certainly not but if the prophet will keep still and then seek the lord for the answer there's the answer there see just like on this person's asking on the the the serpent seed question you see just just watch and don't don't be don't be in a bigger hurry and then now god always brings to pass everything to work together for good to them that love the lord now if if nineveh would not have repented then the judgments of god would have been upon him now remember the prophet must listen it was a warning now the same thing to this nation then you say brother brown last sunday you said there was no hope yes why it spurned its call it's got to receive it it's going to receive it there's coming a time when this nation's going to go to pieces i saw it in 1933. see i looked off you said you might have said well it happened then but it's going to happen neither was mussolini in power neither was imaginary line built neither did a car look like an egg in them days anything neither did the women elect a president that would look like a a college boy and all these other things there would be a catholic president and so forth spoke of about 30 years ago or more these things were predicted but he only showed me way off down to the end and as that thing approaches time by time that cup's filling up and repentance has been preached by billy graham or robertson who else prophets and so forth this cross the nation with signs and wonders and she continually wades into sin that's the reason they don't repent repent brings it notice ahab never repented at the rebuke of elijah if ahab would have repented and walked softly before god the thing would never happen would they have come down there and done nabop's vineyard and had him murdered and all these evil things and jezebel that prophet walked out there with thus saith the lord but what did they do she only threatened to kill him what happened his prophecy was fulfilled the dogs he heard licked ahab's blood just exactly according to his word he saw the cup full amen that's the reason that little micah saying the same thing how could he bless what god had cursed see his his word his prophecy was in harmony with the word herod he never repented when john said it's not lawful for you to have that your brother's wife he never repented but what did he do his wife required the head of the prophet yeah look at the filth he went into look what happened to him look even today and switzerland the blue waters are rejecting him still borrows as a commemoration so he didn't repent when he was rebuked of the lord john told him no matter what he was a proclamatory or whatever he was or the emperor whoever he might be he must repent when god calls or wraths upon him how many times does the prophet say i got um you know wrote down here but we won't have time because we got about 10 minutes longer if no repentance then judgment is sure to come hezekiah repented see nineveh repented ahab never repent nebuchadnezzar never repent the people in noah's times never repent and the judgment swept right on in the now but he first warns everybody everybody gets a warning now seeing the time is at hand let everyone that feels that there is a warning repent quickly before the wrath of god strikes now let's bring it down to the branham tabernacle see we have seen these things and know them to be the truth we know that it's absolutely the truth the commission of the word is if you will repent and be baptized into the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is to your children to them it's far off okay now a man mr dow asked me here not long ago he said brother branham i'm getting old i'm getting weak 91. he said do you do you think i'm i'm ready to die do you think i'm ready to go you think i'm saved i said mr now did you ever go to a doctor for a physical checkup he said yes and you tell him now what the doctor does he's got a book laying there and he takes this book and he finds out now the first thing i ought to do to that man check his heart so he gets the steer scopes and puts him in his ear checks his heart i said then the next thing he gets he finds out his blood pressure with a with a pressure on his arm then the next thing he does he takes a urine specimen and whatever more and some blood out of him and all these different things he goes through all of it and if you can't find nothing takes the x-ray if you can't find them they say mr dow you're physically all right what's he based not upon on the conditions out of his medical book that if there's anything wrong according to the head scientist it'll show up here it'll do this year it'll do that there therefore as far as he can know anything about it you're all right see physically now i said in this case i'm given a soul examination see and god for the soul only has one instrument that's right that's his word that's his word and jesus said in saint john 5 24 he that heareth my word now that here doesn't mean just a listening noise that here means to receive it who can receive my word amen he that hears it don't stand still so nonsense something says nothing to it i don't believe that he that hears my word that's the word of jesus which he is the word there you are if you can hear my word he said and believe on him that sent me he has passed from death unto life and shall not even come to the judgment but already passed from it said how's your heart beating now he said i believe it i have heard it i have received it i said then according to the head specialist the chief operator the chief doctor of eternal life says you've passed from death unto life and shall never come to the continent amen so when i heard you preach on the name of jesus christ for water baptism i walked right in behind you and you baptized me said i'm the man that i once was i'm not that man no more something's happened to me i used to care nothing about it went on the other way but i've turned and started back this way my heart burns day and night to get tortured to him every word of it i believe i say amend every bit of it i don't care how it cuts me i want to measure right up to it and i have as far as i know i said it seems to me like your heart's beating pretty good i believe you're spiritually able now he said wonder if there would be when the rapture comes can i go in it brother branham i said it's not me to say who goes in or who does not he said would like to be living i want i want to see the rapture so bad i said all right let me see what the the science book says you're doing the soul science here i said well it says this in ii thessalonians the fifth chapter it said we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent that means hinder those that are resting asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound and those who are asleep are resting shall wake up first take on immortality then we which are live at that day that time after they've done raised up see then we shall be changed in a moment a twinkle lie and meet with them and they go up to meet the lord in the air be caught up together with them whether you sleep whether you don't whether you do or whether you don't wherever you're buried if you're not even buried at all you're coming anyhow there's nothing can hold you you'll be there i said brother now if jesus doesn't come until my great great great grandchildren's grandchildren you'll still be there right on the moment yes exactly and it'll be there before they're ever even changed that they go that's right amen there is a coming blessing just the same as there is a coming wrath oh we have to be looking for one of it tonight you have to either be looking for the wrath to fall upon you and for a destruction or either you have to be looked for the resurrection of jesus i'm so glad i'm watching for the coming of that glad millennium day but our blessed lord shall come and catch his waiting right away oh my heart is yearning and groaning for that day of sweet release when our jesus shall come back to earth again then sin and sorrow pain and death up this dark world shall cease in a glorious reign with jesus of a thousand years of peace oh my hallelujah and shall forever be with the lord what god said it's got to come to pass they shall build houses they shall inhabit them they shall plant vineyards and they shall eat the fruit of them they shall not plant in another inherited they'll plant their own vineyards and stay with it amen amen they shall not hurt or destroy all my holy mountains hey this bottle takes on immortality this this death is swallowed up in victory then we shall see him as he is and have a body like his own glorious body oh what a time to come the same god and the same prophets that predicted the word of god or the wrath to be poured out poor also told of these coming blessings amen i'm so glad god never does give a a nation a destruction without warning he never gives a man a destruction without warning and now if he does that we have got something that's happened to us the vindication of the signs of the last days with us the great holy spirit moving among us and charging the church with his presence vindicating his word then the church is getting ready for a climb into the sky one of these days by the power of god because it's a warning to lay outside ever wait in the sin to see easily beset us we might fly with patience this race is set before us to the author and finisher of our faith god bless you church hold to god's unchanging hand yes sir if you feel his presence go to him if there's anything wrong in your heart make it right we ain't got much time left the coming of the lord is at hand do you believe him hallelujah oh my won't that be wonderful there what a time when i see the old veterans that kind of walking down to that paradise oh my i'm looking for that hour hey man there's a lot of in there and i i wonder if as you listen to it you took it as personal a warning to you a warning to a look at at your life i thought how that he started out and he said you know he says we've got a responsibility he says he's always gives his warning a reminder to we of a responsibility a place a position something that we're supposed to do he said it it's up to a man to go to god and ask him what am i doing here what would you have me to do yes sir and we've got people nowadays they just want to throw in the towel it's not the time to run it's a time to stand find out your position in the lord find out what you can do to the kin he called it a stewardship wouldn't it be strange that god would give us a stewardship in a time like this you know why he doesn't remember why he said because people are watching you they're looking at you you're the timepiece every spring has got to be in order every part of our life has got to be in harmony because now we're god's timepiece yes sir they look at you what's the hope you have why are you getting ready why are you living this way you become a living epistle a living testimony to the to the things of god i also thought it was very important that we pick this up because we saw it in our day you know that here just a few years ago the message came under a great amount of criticism and people begin to leave the message and what was their thing what he said hadn't come to pass and he said the prophet's mocked well here he tells us that the prophets mocked but it was a warning you see see when we we get to listening so much in the present tense that we don't understand that the the this messenger was caught up he said the sun was shining and he's saying it's gonna be dark now people stand in the presence and they say oh we don't see this i start they start mocking the prophet they start mocking the prophet oh he didn't prophesy right that didn't come to pass we can't find it any place in history in everything and they totally mock it because they don't see it but they fail to see that it's coming how do you think the prophet of god sounded in 1956 when he started talking about homosexuality being rampant and the whole country given over to it you weren't even born yet and it happened just like he said it would happen you've got to understand this being caught up and when you can understand that prophet being caught up and and and god's showing him he says he sees the cup filled when it's not even half full yet and yet he's telling you of what's coming he's telling you the wrath is at hand he's telling you he said if this nation would have repented god would have stayed the wrath but they didn't so he draws the parallel so again what does that do he tells you the only way to stay the wrath is by what a quick repentance and then he says don't wait to repent if you've come under conviction or something spoke you do it right now that's a warning you understand it's a warning of an attitude it's a warning of a nature it's a rewarding to a correction to yourself because this is lady osea lukewarm always putting everything off always wait until tomorrow so in this very message is a warning to us of an attitude we need to take it's a warning to us you better have an attitude and a spirit of a quick repentance that's right don't put it off when you offend your neighbor be quick to repent be quick to say you're sorry be quick to make things right don't linger because he's talking about what happens you just slip away you slip away you slip away you don't you don't even realize you're sliding you don't even realize you're going back you don't even realize you're getting away from god you're getting cold and informal and you find yourself in it you find yourself with things just going on because what did he say they got dull of hearing he said let's bring it down to branham tabernacle let's bring it down to us this morning we hear the message we hear the message we hear the message and pretty soon it just becomes doctrine i thought this was i thought this was a term a tremendous statement she said he says and he made the people ready for the time noah made the people ready and it was a call of mercy before judgment warning and he said this message had the warning and i i thought this was this was a a tremendous statement and i'd like to let this set in and the reason i'm saying these things to you is because the prophet of god is telling us that these attitudes and natures are coming upon us listen to this one one night there was eight people that come here the lady make maybe some of her people here tonight so i won't call their name you probably know who it is but they come here a fine bunch of people from down in kentucky and they come here for years but the people being fine people good friends of mine they were they were real friends of mine but just one of those kind of people that when a revival was going on they could come to church when the revival was off and the load was pulling nobody would pull i wonder if if when you heard that did that ever strike out to anybody you know why because churches go through times where it's a pole it ain't a push it's a pull everybody having to pull it's like being on a journey you go from an oasis and you go through the mountains and you go through the valleys and you go to where the fruit is but now there comes a time that you have to go through the desert and everybody i ain't going through the desert i ain't going to pull through the desert i ain't going to push through the hard times well that's a warning you know don't be like that get in there find a farm find your part find what part of the spring you are find out what part of the clock you are do whatever you can do do it the best you can do okay you know what to me it's like the the prophet of god is giving us the answers to the test you know when school we all you know we had classes i don't know what your high school was like but when i was in high school we went from classroom to classroom and a different teacher taught history and then we changed periods and we'd go and have another history i don't know how they do school nowadays but that's how they did it in my day well some kids had history at the first period well my history class or my math class or whatever class it was some of my classes i had in the periods after lunch so at lunch time what do you think everybody was doing what questions were on the test you know what it wouldn't answer this give me all the answers you know when guys would write down the answer they put the answer and they write down the answer a little paper you think any of us ever got the same test do you think that teacher was was totally stupid no we didn't get the same test then we'd be mad at the other guy because he gave us the wrong answers to the right test you see you can't disassociate yourself with the living gospel and the living church yes sir you can't you can't separate yourself you're a part of a body a living body it doesn't matter i'm not talking about the body that's in this building i'm talking about the body which is christ jesus a church that's fitted and joined together a place that has to pull that's why he said everybody should have a be at a post of duty somewhere yes sir somewhere doesn't have to be here but it has to be somewhere but you're fooling yourself if you think you can just go off somewhere and be happy warning warning amen there's a judgment that comes for that there's a judgment for re shirking your responsibility we should ask the lord what we should be doing and you know i loved how he finished it up didn't you he said the same god that prophesied the warning prophesied the blessing amen he's the same god that said yes judgment's gonna fall but i provided an escape he said you've got to be looking for one or the other you're either looking for judgment either looking for for a wrath to come down you're either setting in fear or you're looking up because your redemption does not you either have on your heart even so come quickly lord jesus i have gone to prepare a place for you if it was not so i would not tell you if i go to prayer place for you i'll come again that you may be where i am also amen he's made that coming in our generation veiled himself in a prophet use the veil of flesh to deliver to us a message to communicate with us to our hearts to that seed that we could catch what we're a part of that we could recognize our calling that we could separate ourselves from the world and the things of the world and live holy unto the word of god being in full obedience because we know the blessing that's associated with it what's the show associated with disobedience wrath and judgment what's associated with obedience escape and reward he placed it within each of us to make that choice so really what this message was was a warning against being lukewarm it's a warning against lady osea it's a warning against being lukewarm it's it's a warning to to be so complacent that we don't think the judgments and the repentance that went across this nation for year after year after year that what he spoke isn't going to come to pass no it is coming to pass we're seeing it it's darkness i was at my mother's house and and and so i i turned on the news there and leslie came down to the room and she sat next to me and was watching the news and they were showing these riots and these burning things and police all in gear and and all these things like that and she sat there and she watched it she said i didn't know this was going on i didn't know all this was happening she says i can't take this she's gotta walk down she couldn't even believe that this was what was happening and and you can't be an ostrich you can't go down into the basement and say the sun's not shining you can't close your heart and your mind to the fact that we're living in the day of judgment but we have one promise that thou that love him and serve him and follow his word with all their heart are promised and escape so if he promised and escaped and he promised judgment and now we can see the promised judgments coming to pass how much more should we prepare ourselves for the escape amen if if you know and i that there's things that you need to do better i encourage you start doing better if you need to be kinder more gentle more forgiving more giving more helping more in love with this book then a warning is always mercy a warning is always mercy and so take the warning this morning i know it's hard when we play a tape but that tape really was wonderful it contained wonderful wisdom and truth in it so at this time i think we're having a baptism isn't that right hey brother marco's going to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ a good tape for baptism when he he hit right in there on water baptism so as we go prepare for that baptism and as brother billy lead you in worship would you look in your own heart and maybe you started getting some attitudes that aren't right maybe you become a little discouraged maybe you've worried a little bit about your future and i i believe that brother branham told that story about the girl and how that god had spared time and how that he himself said to god you owe me an explanation it reflects back on us that sometimes we think god owes us something and he said god doesn't owe me a thing i owe him everything maybe there's a chance to reflect a little bit on what your attitude has been lately what just your approach to everything and and i'll i and i am warning you that harder times are coming that's the truth but also he said also he said i have not seen the righteous big bread neither will i leave thee nor forsake thee but i'll be with you even in you till the end that's right maybe our spirits just need to get to the place where we're a little more content with his presence and his blessings than we are with worldly contentment and worldly things every single one of us should be in the place today that if we lost that automobile or we lost that house or we lost our job or whatever it was and we're not making as much as we used to be as long as he's with us and in us we're happy amen because we know no matter how bad it gets here that this here can't take that away from us and he that is in us is greater than he was in the world and we will not live by bread alone but we will live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god if you've been in a trial for a season doesn't mean that god's against you amen amen because he said i'll be with you you know you might go through a time of suffering physically mentally or spiritually but every day you take that with a with the right attitude and the right spirit an angel walks up there buffs a great big stone and puts it in your crown amen they say someday this person's going to take this crown and throw it down the master's feet church it'll be worth it all right in a twinkling of an eye it'll be worth it all don't quit now let's fight let's hang in there god bless you brother billy if you had a brother let us go and as we prepare for baptism if you need to go up just feel free you can go with no uh don't feel bad at all if you need to go if you'd like to stay for the baptism god bless you anyway for those that streamed i hope the tape came across good for you and god bless you church love one another be in harmony and we can see what hour that we're living in god bless you [Music] i'll come running after you [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] my gosh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] uh [Music] what [Music] cheese [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] jesus [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] one [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] bye [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] united [Music] oh [Music] generation [Music] i can't believe i'm standing here [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] foreign good morning it's once again this had beautiful fruits of the preaching of the gospel and to see god continually add to the church and people many people love the lord and they've come to the realization that they haven't been baptized correctly many have never given their hearts to the lord and they choose to be baptized but whatever way that a man comes some good people some sinners but we all come this one way we all come through the blood of the lord jesus christ and through water baptism and today brother marco has come to made the decision in his heart to be baptized so i'd like for him to just give you a little testimony from his heart before we baptism the mark of god bless you talk out loud when the lord wants you to to basically work for him you'll know he's going to come toward you he's going to approach you it could be through your friends your family even the people you hang out with that you've never thought or a biblical related like bible related church in any way and when the time comes you'll know amen and i feel the time has come and for my testimony i want it to be how i live my life to see how i live my life not just from now but when i met god when god revealed himself to me brother matthew 2 1 two two wednesdays past uh spoke to us about how uh when the lord reveals something to you it can't be revealed another man cannot reveal it to you again so when a man reveals something to you you could be revealed to another macro revealed to you when the lord reveals it to you no man can change that and that is what i received and i'm i'm thankful to the lord for that that's why i'm here today am i not mistaken like you were at work and somebody that wasn't even a christian at all yes sir tell them that part of it yes sir uh so i was working and uh a random person this was this uh two weeks past that was the same week brother matthew spoke to us in the meeting um randomly that whole week everywhere i went was about getting baptized my friend would ask me have you gotten baptized yet i'm like what do you mean i mean okay i'll think about it something like that and the whole throughout the week it was baptism everywhere i went was back to him that's when i knew this is the lord speaking to me through different ways and here i am now [Music] amen can you imagine just someone that's not even a christian or don't even you know go to church you've got conviction on your heart and they walk up and say have you been baptized yet oh my god knows how to do things doesn't it be wonderful let us read in our scriptures found in the book of acts and on the day of pentecost you know the story that the disciples came out of the upper room being filled with the holy ghost and they began to testify concerning the things of god and somebody said unto them all these men must be drunk and he said no these men aren't drunk but this is what was prophesied by the prophet joel that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and the scripture says and we'll pick it up here and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as our lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this up towards generation we heard that today and they that and they that gladly received his words were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls amen because the promises to your children and your children's children and them that are far off god is still at it amen amen and we'll add one more today and god maybe another week and we're going to keep adding to the church of the living god till the last one comes in and we are all home where we belong amen god bless you our brother according to the word of god we go into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost by divine revelation with the keys to the kingdom we know that that name is the lord jesus christ according to the scriptures in god's word we baptize you in the name of the lord jesus friend [Applause] amen god bless you let y'all stand that as i sing my my my what is joy of serving my jesus let's sing it as our dismissal this morning oh my my my what a joy oh serving my jesus oh that i could explain the joy and full of glory it's amazing [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all that i could extend the way [Music] is [Music] sing it again [Music] it's amazing so you
