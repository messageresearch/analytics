Description:
Wednesday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 1, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and the Lord has healed her so when the when I went and the doctor said all those things I part of me didn't want to get the blood work because I said well it's done I believe she's going to be well but at the same time the doctors I also didn't want them to you know say well the mother refused treatment so we tried to get the blood they couldn't get the blood they sent me to a lab across the street at the hospital and I had both estra and Isabel and it was a lot of walking I didn't have a stroke with me and I was by myself and it was their nap time so I told my husband I don't know what to do and he said just come home and we can take care of it another another time but I had prayed and said Lord if if they can't get the blood I'm just going to trust you and so we just completely forgot about it and did not get her lab work done and you know we try to get her off those foods but it's hard when your other children are eating those things and she's little and doesn't know any better and so there was a point where I just thought you know what she's well and I'm not going to accept that she has any of these allergies and whether I'm right or wrong I I don't know but I'm going to trust that you know we have this food and it's good food and it's healthy food and I'm going to trust that she's going to be well and it was in but days where I started to notice that she wasn't her skin was not irritated anymore and then little by little the rash started to go away and I noticed that it wasn't coming back and so every time somebody comes up here and testifies then they say well so and so testified and you know it encouraged me to come up here every time brother Mark David comes up and says that I think oh Lord I just I forget to to testify that the Lord has healed her and this allergy that they said would last you know eczema or allergies forever the Lord has healed her and we didn't have to get any blood work she didn't have to stay off Dairy she can drink milk and she can eat the same things that her brothers eat and the Lord has been so gracious to us and I just wanted to thank him and if you're going through something you know brother John um share this song with me and I just pray that it will bless you and know that whatever it is that you're going through the Lord knows he knows your need and he will [Music] supply his love reached from the Heavens to the far ends of the Earth to give you life forever he left no stone unturn and before the birth of time Jesus had you on his m so you never need to question his [Music] concern so what can separate you from the precious love of God who could ever come against his and perfect love so when you're in the the valley and your nights are cold and lonely The Darkest Hour is just before the dawn remember nothing can separate you for God's love he numbers each and every Star and calls them all by name he calls them one by one and sees that they are still in place if he cares for every Star then he sees Right Where You Are you can trust you'll never fall from his Embrace so what can separate you from the precious love of God who could ever come against his strong and perfect love so

lifted up in our midst Lord we love you and we commit everything to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen we'll we'll be uh listening to a tape uh tonight it was uh what our pastor had in his heart uh the name is is your life worthy of your gospel we'll start from uh paragraph 30 uh it's such a I don't want to make too many comments because I want you to hear I thought it's so amazing that we live in a time where it it doesn't matter what God offers it says people have excuses for not receiving what God is offering and and and so it's it you get in this situation where they said well I I need this I need this but God is offering giving an invitation come they they don't understand that the invitation have what they La in order for them to be what they desire to be the the very invitation to come has what it takes for it to change you to make you clean to give you all that you need in order for you to live right but yet they refuse they reject that invitation oh my it's so amazing so you we we brother bam is going to pray and start at at paragraph 30 and after that it's going to uh read the scripture so once he reads the scripture we can uh we can have our seats uh the brother's in the back if you could just start it up amen Jesus any man physically or woman or child can move back to P pages of this Bible but there's no one that can reveal it but you I pray Lord of taking this text as it's placed upon my heart to send out across the Nations for the people that they might know what type of life is required of them to live for so many has asked me is a Christian Life a life of church service is it helping uh the poor or the needy or is it a constant member is it a loyal loyalty to the church and such questions father may it the correct answer come tonight through these words as we make an Endeavor to to bring them to the people in the name of Jesus Christ we ask that amen now turning your Bibles to the book of St Luke and we'll start at the 14th chapter and the 16th verse to read some scripture for a basis for a background for this that were going to try a lot about 30 to 40 minutes on now the 16th verse of the 14th chapter of St Luke then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bed many and sent his servants at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for for All Things Are are now ready and they all with one Accord begin to make excuses the first said unto him I bought a piece of ground and I must need go and see it I pray thee have me excuse and another said I have bought five y yolk of ox and I go to prove them I pray ye have me excused another said I've married a wife wife therefore I cannot come so the servant came and showed his Lord all these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant notice it's not servant servant go out quickly into the streets and the lane and the cities and bring in hither the poor and the main and the Halt and the blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in and my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper now did you notice there was three pools or three turns of it when they went out first and called to them that were uh or bidden to come and they didn't do it so they went out a healing campaign out to get to Blind and Hal and still there were room so he went out and compelled the good bad and indifferent they should come in now you read another parable of this something on in Matthew 22 1 to10 if you'd like to read it later on but I I drew this subject from there uh is your life worthy of the Gospel now Jesus here is saying man has always tried to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation though it be firmly proed proving to him that it's that it's his supper and his invitation but man is constantly making excuses and if you read St Matthew uh 22 you'll find that the excuses were made there also and and they tried it went back into all ages went back into the age it said a man a viam and had a Vineyard and we find that Parable how he sent his servants to collect from this Vineyard first servant come what did they do they run him off the next servant come they also Stone him and they run servant after servant off the cruel man the king sent finally his son and when his son came we find out that they said this is an air we'll kill him then we'll have of all things then Jesus said to them the king sent forth and slew those murders and burnt their cities now we see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something or to receive the invitation that he's given him and he returns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is spurn but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy then there's only one thing left and that is judgment and we find that man has done that in all ages it's happened most every age in the Bible when God sent Noah his servant and made an way of an escape for all the people who wanted to to be saved but the people only laughed and scorned at Noah but God made the way but they had an excuse it wasn't according to their to their uh modern thinking it didn't it wasn't the way they wanted it so they made excuses in the days of Noah they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses in the Days of Elijah they made excuses in the days of Christ and they make excuses today now him speaking directly to Israel the ones that was called To The Feast then I would also apply today the man the church who has been bidden to come to the feast and won't do it the spiritual Feast of the Lord and they won't do it they don't want to do it they've got other things to do they find excuses now if Israel 2,000 years ago would accepted the invitation that they were given they wouldn't be as they are today 2,000 years ago Israel turned down the invitation to come to the wedding supper and they turned it down and went into judgment but as Jesus said they stoned and killed the prophets that was sent to them um by making excuses now the excuses they made in each day we find in the days of Jesus that he didn't he didn't affiliate with any of them they said when did this man get this learning what school is he from is not this the carpenter son is his mother called Mary is his brothers Jo and James so forth and isn't his sisters with us then we did this man get this authority to do this in other words he didn't affiliate with him so they said he's beah he's a Samaritan he's got a devil and he's mad he's a he's a he's a man that's got an evil spirit on the line of religion and has drove him crazy and that's what he's out there like a wild man don't pay any attention to him and we know what happened to Israel they scamed out they were so sure that that man was wrong until on when they condemned him he said he said let his blood be upon us and upon our children and it's been there ever since Jesus was trying to tell them that their excuses was why kill the prophets and what kill the righteous that come they accepted their Creeds that man had given them instead of taking the word of God and by doing so had made the word of God of no effect now you've either got to say in this that this is God's Will and God's desire or either something else that you can crop up that's better than what this is you have to take one or the other you can't serve God in man and you've got to say this is the truth or that's part of the truth or it isn't all the truth or it isn't put together right or it isn't interpreted right and the Bible said that the word of God is no private interpretation no one else is supposed to put an interpretation to it it's written just the way God wants it interpreted just what it says that that's what it's supposed to be just take it the way it's said way it's wrow down here now they accept their Creeds they make God's promises of no effect to them they bypass that just skip away from it now if Russia had accepted the Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the Holy Ghost fell in Russia they wouldn't have been Communists today now 75 years ago they had a great Revival in Russia God come among them and they had great Revival way into Siberia and what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone and the churches can't have church only under permission and they are doomed into judgment and gone off on this wild tantrum of Communism sold out to the devil 50 years ago the Holy Ghost fell in England just after that come George Jeff and FF Bosworth and Charles price Smith Wigglesworth those great warriors of the the faith 50 years ago and offered England the Holy Ghost Revival but what did they do they laughed at him put him in jail called him crazy thought they lost your mind the churches refused the people to come here and they healed the sick and cast out devils and done great works and because that England as a nation rejected the gospel her her her sins is know throughout all the world there's hardly a a more of an apostate a nation in all the world even including Rome and France than England she's a mother of apostasy right where uh finny and many of the great man preached in the hay market and Charles G finny and Wesley and on down and she turned it down and down even last week or two in the papers you find out where their great man has so weakened to the to the sect of women until spies come in and their head man found some more of them the magazines is packed it their sin of stle right in their government has sold their disgraceful Name Across the world why she rejected the truth she had her excuse and she's finished England is all washed up with God a long time ago if America 15 years ago when the Great healing Revival continued on from Pentecost broke out in the nation and there was a re rivals on the Capal Washington DC the presidents vice presidents great people Governors great things taking place Governors and turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before but they turned it down and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she's doomed there's no hope for it at all she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected in what she has here to control the nation and she's rotten to the core her politics is rotten the morals of this nation is lower than anything I can think of and a religious system is rottener than the morals she becomes and doing this she has now joined herself all these Church chur and the the nation into the Federation of churches and taking the mark of the beast what a thing why Christ G them the opportunity come to my Feast the Feast of Pentecost which means 50 when the Holy Spirit poured out on Russia they was called To A Feast of Pentecost spiritual feast and they turned it down England a Holy Ghost is poured out upon them and they turned it down America the Holy Ghost is poured out upon them and they turned it down he bit three times three times he sent out and they did not listen to The Feast then he sent again and he said go and compel those people to come the tables got to be set theable AES ready to steal room I believe that maybe maybe within the next few months or something or a year or whatever it is God's going to send another shaking across the country for there's somebody still out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world the nation itself is gone I was looking in this week's Life Magazine down at the where down at the Little Rock the other day are rather hot springs and there I seen I believe it was a governor of the state of New York with some kind of a strip tees over in halula dancing with her now in here below that was another renowned man oh what a disgrace look at our nation today look at the condition of our of our nation look where she's went to how low she sunk look at our religious system today how can it be that the churches can ever get into the condition that they are now is because they have rejected and refused the message of God the invitation to come to the feast could you call a life like that worthy of the Gospel could you call a life That Could set and permit their their people to do the things to smoke cigarettes the other day down here a certain church a little league team was playing down here at the park and uh brother-in-law's little boy is a pitcher uh for one of the teams and so he was out there pitching and there was a church league playing and there was the pastor with these little fellas out there on the ground playing and the pastor smoked cigarette after cigarette of a real neighborly church right nearby and could you imagine a man and even people sitting in the audience noticed it but it's getting so that they don't even pay attention to it a certain great church a Baptist Church that I know of lets a church out from Sunday school 15 extra minutes so that the pastor and all of them can stand outside and smoke before they come back in to serve the duty of the law John Smith the founder of that church prayed so hard that God sent the Revival till his eyes swoll shut at night and his wife had to lead him to the table and feed him with a spoon if that man would turn over in his grave if he know that church had got in that condition what is it they were bidden to come and turned it down that's the only thing and you remember Jesus said in here that those that were bidden and turned it down would not taste his supper when God sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometime he's going to turn it for his last time and then you won't be a privileged character you can sit in the church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel you might do so much to say I know it's right but never put a finger on it to help it yourself see you just listen to it because you say I believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it I could say I believe that's a $10,000 that don't mean I got it see I could say that's good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what I mean and this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and then you won't be have the privilege to come and receive it to you people who come here I'm not responsible for those who are are other ministers are speaking to but if it's right you owe your life to it what more could you ever find that be more of a benefit to you than to know that you can have eternal life what if I was giving away capsules here that scientifically proven scientifically proven that this capsule would make you live a thousand years well I I'd have to get a militia out here and swarm away from the place you wouldn't have to make an alter call for it you just have to beat him away from it to live a thousand years and yet scientifically proven that the Eternal God all of his power of His resurrections which promis you eternal life and Satan will put his Legions out there and keep you away from it yet you can look and sensible enough look in the face of it and see it's right but then turn it down something some kind of excuse it's too hot I'm too tired I will tomorrow just some kind of an excuse that's all they do by rejecting the day of visitation it separates you from God now we noticed in the Old Testament they had what they call the Jubilee year that was when all the people that was slaves could go free when the Jubilee sounded and then if the man did not go out if there was some excuse that he could give that he didn't want to return to his land then he had to be marked in the ear with an Awe by the post in the temple and then no matter how many jubilees come along that man was sold out he could never no more come back as a citizen in Israel no more what did he do he rejected is invitation he didn't have to pay nothing the debt of his slavery was over his family was free he could go right back to his homeland and get his own possession but if he refused to do it then he wasn't allowed no more with Israel and his possession was given to another now the same thing in the natural applies to the spiritual that if we as inheritance of eternal life and we hear the gospel and know that is true and we reject it and refuse to do it or to listen to it we take on the mark of the beast now somebody said now there's going to be a a mark of the beast is going to come Som day let me tell you it's already come as soon as the Holy Ghost Begin to Fall the mark of the beast begin to take place see you only have two things one of them is accepted takes the Seal of God to reject it takes the mark of the beast to reject the Seal of God is to take the mark of the beast everybody understand to reject the Seal of God is to take the mark of the beast for the Bible said all that was not sealed by the Seal of God took the mark of the beast when the trumpet sounded and all wanted to go free could go them it didn't was marked now you see the mark of the beast if we talk about it in the future is when it's going to be made manifest when you realize that what you've already done see and so is the holy spirit it's to be manifested when we see the Lord Jesus coming in glory and feel that transforming power and see the Dead Rising out of the grave and know that a second longer we'll be changed and have a body like is it'll be made manifest then to see those who rejected it will be left down out didn't Jesus said The Virgins went out to meet Christ some of them fell asleep the first watch second third fourth fifth sixth to the seventh watch but in the seventh watch then came forth the sound behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and the ones that were sleeping awakened all the age back to Pentecost woke up see from the seventh age the seventh Church age all the way back to woke up and these that were in this church age of living they were changed and they went in at the very time they went in the sleeping virgin come and said we want to buy some of your AR but they said we just got enough for ourselves go to them and sell it and while they were trying to receive this AA the bridegroom came there has never been a time in the history of the world that the episcopalians Baptists methodists Presbyterians the papers are full the religious papers are praising God that those sleeping virgins are now trying to receive Pentecost trying to receive the Holy Ghost and don't the people realize that it will not happen according the word of God while they were trying to come back the bridegroom come and tuck away the bride and they were cast into outer Darkness for judgment because they rejected their invitation all peoples are bidden to come God in every age has sent out his life and it's been rejected and now today is no different from any other day to reject the day of the visitation when God is making a visit to the church and to the people receive it then don't put it off to next year the next Revival that's the hour today is the day of salvation and remember God has never sent a message in any day but what he Vindicated it with the supernatural Jesus said himself if I do not the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works you believe the works if you can't believe me when you see it clearly cut and and made manifest now the time has come that she rejects it then she's bored in the ear with an awe then she'll never hear it now she takes herself to the confederation of churches to go right in to take the mark of the beast one of the great Ambitions somebody give me the paper in just now this new pope has said is to unite the churches together they'll do it just as certain as I'm standing here and the Protestants fall apart see because the church the Bible said Paul the prophet of the Lord said that day will not come except there come a falling away first and then the man before the man of sin will be revealed he that Seth in the temple of God of holding himself all that's above God he as God forgiving sins on the earth and so forth how that this thing happened but it couldn't happen until the falling away until the church began to get away from the spiritual Feast draw itself back and organize itself and then the Revelation didn't stay with the church remember Israel walked Day and Night by the pillar of fire when that Pillar of Fire move they mooved with it and remember it was a fire at night and a cloud at day so it might come day or night any time but wherever it was there was a propitiation made that they would not fail to see it it was a light at night and a cloud in the daytime and they followed it yes sir the same thing Martin Luther saw it what did he do he come out of Catholicism but what did they do they build a little fence around said we're lutherans this is it then Wesley saw it moving away from there he went what they do build a little fence around and said this is it well I do moved right on again Pentecost saw it what they do moved out of the westling and nazarenes and so forth what did they do they build a fence call we're Oneness and we're Trinity and we're the United and all this what did he do God moved right on out of it see we cannot do that we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ amen if we don't we take an organization life and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy a man that's a Christian on Sunday and goes the church sits back there thinks he owns the church because he does this that the other and on Monday oh steal and lie and women that'll go out on the public beaches and and out up the streets with immoral clothes on I thought of of uh the first lady wouldn't even put on makeup to go before the pope and come back and set a Waterhead haircut uh uh spree for the women in the nation and all these uh dresses that when she's become mother every woman in the country wants to wear one of them uh mother type dresses now that's trying it's examples that they know that those people would do that they take on a spirit of the world and that don't belong in the Church of the Living God praise the Lord women ought to look to Jesus Christ you ought to look to Sarah and name of the Old Testament now they got so that I preaching the other night somewhere about a women to obey their husband obey that went out and Mar you it's a long time ago but uh they ain't going to do that no sir they live in America and they let you know so they not going to obey but as long as you don't do it don't never try to call yourself a Christian because you're not I don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God a woman that wears shorts and does these things that she does on the street don't call yourself a Christian you want to have the world and still hold your testimony you cannot do that in the presence of God when you know better than to do it notice bored in the ear marked away then you'll never hear remember that's a sign of closing the ears you won't hear it no more you won't listen You'll never be able to get to it again oh she don't believe that oh my don't tell her she believes it no she tell you right she don't know it how could a a lady it's ask you how could a lady as I spoke Sunday last Sunday night a week ago tonight on of red flashing light how that the the the Run of women has has become prettier than it ever was now that's nothing nothing against a woman now that's just but how she controls that see that she's got that way to put her in a Temptation like Eve was put before the tree every man every son that comes to God's got to go through that hour of testing this is the age of women this nation is or she has to go through that testing if she can be a pretty woman and act like a sister the Lord's blessings upon on her but when she can get herself to to know this and display herself absolutely shows that she's got a a bad Spirit on her she don't mean to be that way I don't think many of them don't but they don't realize that could you tell me that a decent thinking woman could put herself on these little uh clothes that they wear out here on the street I've got two young girls sitting here I don't know what the outcome of them kids will be I just pray for them kids today I don't you can't tell I don't know they're not immune from that they've got to stand on their own two feet before Jesus Christ and give an answer they can't go in on what on on what I believe and what their mother believes I don't know what they do but I actually believe at this hour if them girls went out on the street with them kind of clothes and a man insulted them and I'm kind of close I don't believe if I had the opportunity I could even condemn the man that's right I condemn the girls they had no business doing that listen if man thinks that and they teach that man's no more than an animal he come from the animal race and look then and you put him out there like you take the dog to the little female at certain times through the fences and everything else because the little female is in that condition Hogs cows every other animal and if we are animal life which we are the physical part and then when a woman displays herself like that she proves that she's the same thing the little dog is the same or she wouldn't be doing that she knows nature teaches her that man's going to look at and the Bible said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed a with her already in his heart that puts a testing time and the devil pretties that women and strips them down and set them out there to give you a test man turn your heads be sons of God women you dress like Daughters of God don't answer for adultery y today if that woman no matter how innocent she might have never done nothing wrong never even had their mind to do wrong but when that sinner who looked upon that graceful Farm of that woman knowing he's a male and female sex and and one glands and one in male in the other and that sinner is going to have to answer for it at the day of the Judgment who did it who's guilty not him you there you are immoral look at this nation it used to be when we they had the knee high dresses that the women War we had to send to Paris to get them today Paris sends here to get them amen it's got so filthy the parish can't keep up with it that's right the whole FL rejecting the gospel why Paris didn't have it it's 100% Catholicism the Protestants can't even get in there look at vram I think there's only 600 Christians in all Paris out of the millions 600 Christians Protestants that's not Holy Ghost fil that's just absolutely Protestants 600 out the millions times millions they didn't get the opportunity to reject it but these people had the gospel and when they get away from the message and the gospel that they've seen demonstrated make fun of it because some old prostitute Doctrine has weaved them around in some Pastor standing the pull pit thinking more of a dollar in a meal ticket than he does with the soul of people that he's preaching that's what's done it now she leads the world you remember not long ago in this Tabernacle I preached on a subject about 20 years ago I'll show you the goddess of America and had the little flapper here sitting there with that's what it is now they're even get it they're getting what they've asked for and they're going to get it that's all oh they won't believe it no sir they let you know they're American citizens and they got a right to to function any way they want to I just wish let me tell you I'll tell you now no sure politics will never work no sure democracy will never work amen democracy is rotten to the Bone amen if it could be run amongst a bunch of Christians it would be fine but when you put it out there in the world it becomes all sales and no anchor exactly right look at here today anything can take place and they'll be just anything pull a few politics and you get by with murder when I preached down there that night to try to save them two kids' life they're as guilty as guilty could be even that attorney got up behind me there and he said it's right he said I don't believe in taking the people's life he said if you'll notice on your criminal records who is it it gets killed electric chairs and things it's not the rich he can afford to get him a lawyer some pull some dirty tricks and some wheel sharing some over here and bribe the thing he said his poor kids like that it ain't got enough money to buy a decent meal that's a kind of guess it there's a kind of electrocute somebody's like they call a bunch of ignorant people and they just hold up their name of capital punishment I said the first murder was ever committed in the world one brother killed another God did not take his life for it he put a mark on him that nobody should take his life right that's a supreme judge I see they tuck the sentence off of them now they go to get another trial of course they'll get now which should be 11 years and maybe stand for parole they're guilty certainly they're guilty they ought to be set to Penitentiary for Lifetime but not their life take no man has a right to take another man's life no sir I don't believe in it no indeed oh they say well they don't believe that they're out of the will of the Lord because that's all they know about and all they want to hear about they turned their ear against the truth and there neither did Egypt want to know that that bunch of Holy Rollers down there was the will of Lord how they want to know that some crazy man come in there from the Wilderness with Whiskers hanging down like this and said Pharaoh I come in the name of the Lord turn them children loose Pharaoh would say who me throw him out see me if you don't do it the Lord's God's going to Smite this nation the the old crank turn him out somewhere let him go the sun's kind of baked his mind see but it brought J jallu because the man was a prophet and had thus sayth the Lord hallu exactly right they didn't want to believe it Rome didn't want to believe it either but it happened just the same Israel didn't want to believe that that was a messiah how could they bunch a bunch of galileans and aren't not all these galileans where did they come from what kind of a crowd does he go with the very poorest that can be got together that's the crowd he Associates with that's who comes to hearing is the poor people that people that don't know nothing they're not elected they're not they're not the intellectual type that we are they're poor Bunch you heard say about the Revival in this thing what kind of crowd hears them what kind goes to these meetings what kind of people are they I heard a fell say not long ago well it was kind of a he was hope stepfather and I was telling him about the baptism Holy Spirit he said now who would believe a thing like that let some kind of a bunch like you got up there he said you let so and so a business man you're of the Town a wicked is all go let him say that he received the Holy Ghost then I believe it I said don't worry he'll never say it a man died instantly without God be careful what you're doing be careful what you're saying you want a life worthy of the Gospel that's right Israel didn't believe it that but bunch of people that mad man by the name of Jesus of Nazareth born they thought an illegitimate birth and the people believed it because they said that wasn't his why his father's Joseph and Mary was to have this baby before he's even born what it's illegitimate what is he just a mad man one of them funny sort of a GU don't go to hear him what did they do they were sending their souls to hell they T Jesus said let them alone if a blind leads a blind don't they both fall in the ditch that's right they didn't know it they wouldn't believe it they could not they could not see how that a simple people with a simple message to be rejected could cause a great nation to fall to ruins now listen they could not understand that a simple ordinary common bunch of people you know the Bible said that the Common People heard Jesus gladly I had a little something that happened in Mexico not long ago General valinia elected of God the light shine across his P once in one of the meetings that great Catholic Warrior one of the highest Generals in Mexico come humbly to The Altar and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he went back down in Mexico he kept crying to me come down there finally I decided to go down the Lord led me had a vision told my wife went down there and when he did him being one of the chief generals fourstar General he went to the headquarters to the government and they they're hard against Protestants down there you know so they know this going to be a terrific meeting so he went down there and got a militia guard and when they did they got the big arena and they was going to bring me in like that the government was bringing me in so when they did the the bishop one of the great Bishops of the Catholic Church went up to him to the governor and said sir I understand that you're bringing in a non-catholic said yes what about it why he said you can't have a man like that in here this government has never know to doing a thing like that but said we've done it now he said well I said the man's a reputable man I understand that thousands of people comes out to hear him General valinia he's my bosom friend he said and the president himself's P Methodist so he said he said the man's a reputable man as far as I know a general valini here he's converted under this man said well he's a as far as I know a reputable person said thousand of people that claim will come hear him and this uh Bishop said what kind of a people is it sir just the ignorant that's the ones that goes here a person like that the president said sir you've had him for 500 years why are the ignor that was enough that settled it oh my that dehorned him yes sir then when that little baby was raised from the dead I sent a Runner behind the man the lady was sing in Spanish the baby died this morning at nine o'clock and it's pouring down rain having about 10,000 converts to Christ each night the night before an old blind man uh had received his sight on the platform oh three or four times size this Tabernacle about that high old Shaws and hats laying and I just they let me down on ropes in the ring to get me in I down there and started preaching by faith Billy come said Daddy you going have to do something that woman said I got 300 archers standing there and they can't stop a little bitty woman weigh 100 pounds nearly and pretty little lady about so high about or maybe your first baby I'd say she's 23 25 years old and she's standing there in her hair hanging down and holding a little baby and she'd make a lunge for that line the man would push her back she climb up over the top of that baby on her hip anyway go between their legs or anything they get her up there have to kick her off off the platform and they didn't have no prayer card to give her he said if I let her come in there daddy well that dead baby with no prayer card and said them others standing there's been standing here two or three days in that rain and sun and let her get ahead of them said it'll cause a a fuss down there I said that's all right brother Moore was there and he's kind of baldheaded like me and I said she don't know who's who so many people I said s and and couple of the brother one of the brother near Tabernacle that um he's gone to Glory now I can't think of his name just at this time but he was standing back there so I said Brother Moore go down and pray for the baby she'll never know who Wass me or you just going down and not able to speak English so uh brother Bo said all right brother BR start walk down I said as I was saying Fai and I seen a little baby little Mexican baby sitting in front of me just laughing I said wait a minute and I said let the little lady through Billy said I can't do that Daddy Shake I said I saw a vision Billy said oh that's different so we opened up the crowd like that brought her through here she come falling on her knees with the prayer beads in her hand I said get up so I said heavenly father now I don't know what you're going to do I don't know where you just want me to satisfy the woman by praying for the baby or what but I said I lay my hands upon the little baby in the name of the Lord Jesus just the same things that did to brother way laying on the floor dead the other day and the blanket kicked and that little baby started screaming and it was to its life when I said a runner brother esposas to go with her to the doctor and get a sworn affidavit from the doctor that baby died that's by 10 o'clock that night died that morning at 9 o'clock in his office was pneumonia he got a sworn statement from the doctor the papers couldn't keep that steal you know so they had to come over and they interview me and they said to me he said do you think our Saints could do that too I said if they're living or he said you can't be a saint until you're dead there you are see and the people you see the other day where they had this nun they played up in the paper saw a new Saint died oh 100 years ago or something like that they made a Canon I her now made a saint out of her and they said that she come back from the dead and prayed for some sick person that had leukemia wasn't this in one of the magazines just think how they try to play that up and one of these hundreds and hundreds of cases right under the nose of the people here what's that thing for a thing to play the Protestant church right into it see they can think something man the real works of the Lord was perfectly ad Vindicated proved they are dares to touch the paper with it there you are they received an invitation and turned it down yes sir they can't understand how a simple message a simple people to reject a thing like that would cause them to go into chaos a woman said to me Grant Pastor argon sometime ago Catholic girl come out there to condemn and write up to the newspaper report pack cigarettes in her hand and she said I want to talk to you I said what does she want to say she said I want to ask you some questions about this your religion of yours and I said what is it you want to ask and she said by what Authority you do this I said in the name of Jesus Christ by a Divine call and she went ahead smarting off I said just a minute she said if I had to associate with that bunch of ignoramuses up there she said I wouldn't even want to be a Christian she said and if them they say that them people will rule the Earth someday she said I hope I'm not here I said don't worry you won't be I said you had to worry about that well she said all that they're carrying on and screaming I said and you claim to be a Catholic she said I am I said did you know the Blessed Virgin Mary had to receive the Holy Ghost and speak in tongues and dance in the spirit the same way they did before God a receive her you call her the mother of God she said that's nonsense I just a minute how am I supposed to look at the Bible I said then how you going to know what's truth or not she said I take my church's word I said but this is God's word here it is right here I'll challenge you to look at it and Mary was with them up there in the upper room and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost after you call her the mother of God the Lord I said then call that bunch of trash backwash I said don't worry you won't be there you don't have much to worry about if that's all you got to worry about you better worry about your own sinful Soul girl and I let her go now think of all this a simple God makes it so simple how could Ahab how could Jezebel how could those people who thought that Elijah was a witch thought he was a spiritualist even Ahab said here's the one that's caused all this trouble to Israel he said you're the one's trouble Israel how could that Nation think that to reject the message of a fuzzy faed man like that no Priestly garments on and so forth would be the condemnation of it how could Egypt that rule the world pharaohs and his class and dignity the world has never come to that place again and Science and so forth how could they think to reject an old prophet of 80 years old with Whiskers hanging down gray hair stomping out of there a fugitive and come out there with a message you'll either let them go God will destroy the nation how could Pharaoh you B me Pharaoh Pharaoh said obey oh him pharaoh and an old man some old Crank that all turn a god down like that destroy but it did it oh my let's stop pause a few minutes and have a prayer and think what day are we living in where are we at in another modern scientific age we better think maybe you stop people stop pray a little while and think a little bit you feel better have to get through doing it that's right a Christian is not a tool or some kind of a mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime that's right a Christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organization moving a Christian that is not a Christian a Christian is to be Christlike and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man the Life of Christ in him then it produces the life that Christ Liv and you do the things that Christ did what am I talking about personal relationship to Christ what is it is your life worthy of the Gospel now I'm trying to lay that background there to show you that man and women who were renowned women man the Bible said did you notice last Sunday night something I forgot to put in Genesis the 6th chapter and the fourth verse those man who taken to them women for wives were man of old Renown renowned man predicted to come again like it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man renowned man taking women not wives women going after strange flesh look in England a couple weeks ago look in the united look everywhere it's full of prostitution Great Men great High offices bringing disgrace upon the Nations running after women that great man there in England some kind of a warlord like why' you notice he had a pretty wife her picture was there long look at that Russian prostitute but she's all sexy dressed and throw herself out there to display her female flesh and the man fell far what we need today is sons of God we need man in government sons of God that's right therefore a good Godly king would stop all this nonsense there would be no strings to pull like David did he put a stop to it certainly did because he was a king and there was only the real way is God being the king and God sends a prophet didn't Samuel tell them before they ever got a king he said God's your king have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass they said no that's right have I ever bummed you for your living no you never did bum us for a living I've never told you enough but what was right before the Lord said God is your king oh we realize that we know you're a good man Samuel we believe the word of the Lord comes to you but we want a king anyhow that's what they get Pentecost want an organization anyhow you got it that's right want to be like the rest of the churches you are go ahead that that's just why it takes but God is our King God is our King yes sir what is it is because that the people like they did in the days of Christ like they have in every age they find an excuse they have their own Creeds you might not want to say I I bought a cow and I got to go see whether she she will work or not or give milk or what stock she is you might not have that excuse but here's the kind of excuse that people may say I'm a presbyterian we don't believe in that I'm Baptist we don't believe in no such stuff as that well I'm a Lutheran well that don't have anything to do with it that don't mean you're Christian that means that you belong to a bunch of people that's organizing you belong to the Lutheran LOD the Baptist Lodge the Pentecostal Lodge there is no such a thing as Pentecostal Church there is no such a thing as Baptist Church it's Baptist Lodge Pentecostal Lodge Presbyterian Lodge but but there's only one church and there's only one way you can get into it that's by birth you're born into the Church of Jesus Christ and a member of his body of the spiritual delegation of heaven then the signs that Christ is with you lives through you Christians all you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a Son of God you must become Rel to God he must be your father in order for you to be a son and only his sons and daughters are saved not the members of a church but Sons and Daughters there's only thing one thing that will produce that that's the new birth the new birth is the only thing that will produce relationship to God is that right Sons and Daughters then when this takes place then the man here's the question I want to get to you the man says what do we do then after we've been born again so many ask me that questions what should I do then brother Brandon if you are born again your entire nature is changed you are dead to the things you once thought what you say brother Brandon when I join church I got that well then when God said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever he still heals the sick he still shows Vision but brother Brandon my church now you're not born again you can't be for if the very God if his life is in you like that you're in the life of your father and if the very life of God is in you and the Very spirit that was in Christ in you how can the spirit live in Jesus Christ and write this and then come back down in you and deny that can't do it it'll punctuate every word to be so then if you say well I'm a good member of the church that don't happen have one thing to do with it I know the heathens Down in Africa amongst my dark Brethren down there I find the morals of them people higher than than 90% of the American people while in some of the tribes there if a young girl is not married till she's a certain age or when she's a certain size and no one has taken her yet they know there's something wrong they excommunicate her she take off tribal paint she goes to the city then she just becomes a renegade and when she's married she's tested for her virginy if the little virgin Veil is broke then she has to tell who done it and they kill them both together would it be a lot of Killing In America if that taking place then you call them heathens oh my they can come teach people to call themselves church members how to live clean that's right never found one case of anural in the whole trip through South Africa you don't have such a thing there you are see it's just our own dirty filthy ways it's white people that's right got away from God when this takes place the thing you do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the New Birth you will believe and do everything that God says in his words for you to do amen and everything that the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate with amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit you say will I speak with tones you might do that and you might not well I shout you might do that you might not but there's one sure thing you will do you will bear the Fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace Faith longsuffering meekness gentleness patience your temper not be just remember when you got that that poisons the holy spirit away from you when you get to a place that you want to fuss with everybody you come along to there's something wrong when you get a place where the a minister read from the Bible That's wrong to do a certain thing you just remember there's no Christianity there at all that's now that by the fruits you shall know that that's what Jesus said see if it's the word and God said so yet spirit in you will cope with that word every time called genuine Holy Spirit Will cope with the word because the word is life in spirit Jesus said my words are life and if you've got eternal life and he is the word how can the word deny the word that's right what kind of person would you make God that's one thing to know that you're a Christian when you can fully agree upon every word of God and and you find yourself in love with your enemies somebody said well he's nothing but a holy ruler and you start get oh be careful be careful but when you really find yourself that you love him regardless of what they do you still love him then you're begin to find and your patience gets from about that long till it just don't have no end anybody just keeps saying things about you I don't care what you say don't get stirred up if you get stirred up you better go pray first before you talk him again no don't get in fusses don't like to get in fuss if you like to see somebody raised up in the church say you know what I'll tell you so and so did so and so say nah brother shame on you if you say oh is that so listen to that Scandal what shout the holy spirit's not a Cess pool no no no the heart is occupied by the holy spirit is full of Holiness de he thinketh no evil doeth no evil believeth all all things endureth longsuffering see sorry I feel like I'm just stopping at the good stuff here you know you could just go on home and finish it up amen I I trust that was a blessing to you amen if the musician could come you know the reality of the message is in the message itself you don't have to look elsewhere you you you know I don't even want to go through it but just look at what the description of the time we are living in the description of the church the description of politics of women what the condition that the world is in because they rejected because you reject all you have left is is the mark of the beast you can't you can't have a Rel you can't reject the word and have some form of religion and and think it's going to produce the life it's never going to produce it the only thing that would produce the life is the word that God has sent they rejecting it and what they left with as intellect and rules and do this don't do that and everything but when you receive the word and I like this you know he's talking about who are these people that you're going to go to who are they you know the bunch of in the non-educated bunch of people all of that well that's God's kind you know he's not looking for the inner like those educated one is looking for believers those that have something within them to believe the word and they are found everywhere God has them everywhere and they don't care how they look like they're not they're not rich they're not poor they're not anything that whatever situ whatever condition they are in one thing makes them certain one thing there is one characteristics about them is all they want is the word of God I want to say this from my heart this is the kind of life I want the exactly what he describing not some something I made up on my own mind and what Christianity should or should not be no exactly this description no fing and love for everybody and you know the holy spirit in it may speak in tongue may not speak in tongue but love for everybody wanting to do the work of God interested in helping people that's the Christian Life not not knowing all the books of the Bible and quoting everything and no the very life that was in Christ because you are born again he takes of his own life and he places it in you amen God bless you let's all stand amen amen let's just sing now you were the word in Earth beginning one with God the Lord most high you're in
