God bless you church. &gt;&gt; Um last week I was talking to someone um and I uh in admonishing the person I said uh uh God cannot do something for you uh today. Maybe he protect you that God cannot protect you today and then he will not protect you tomorrow. If it protects you today, it protects you tomorrow and the day after and it continue to do that. Um, but when I was saying that, apparently I was talking to myself as well. Have you ever been in a near miss? Maybe you go through situations and you're just thinking, "Oh, I escaped through this one." And and something in human is like you're expecting the next one. When is the next challenge going to come up? And but sometimes you might forget that the God that took you through this one will take you through that other one as well. Um, so I want to sing a mighty fortress is our God. &gt;&gt; Uh, I might not follow the key. Uh, I said I don't know the key, but I'll just give it a try. A mighty fortress. He's a God. A work never failing. A helper he me the flood of mort heals prevailing for still I f seek to walk his craft and par great and armed with cool on earth is not his equal. Did we in our own strength confide our striving would be loseing? Were not the right man on our side? The man of God's own choosing. That ask who that may be. Christ Jesus it is he Lord Sab is his name. from age to age the same. And he must win the battle. And though this world we devils field should tre to undo us. We will not fear for God at will. His truth through triumph to us. The prince of darkness green would tremble not for him. His rage we can endure. Follow his doom me. One little word shall failing. That word above our earthly bars. No thanks to them abidth. your spirit then grow us through evil who wins aside. Let goods and kindred go. This mortal life also the body they make you. God's truth abideth still. His kingom is forever. Amen. Oh, I've heard a thousand stories. stories of what they think you're like, but I've heard the tender whispers of loveing the dead of night. And you tell me that you're pleased and that I'm never alone. You're a good good father. It's who you are. It's who you are. It's who you are. And I'm loved by you. It's who I am. It's who I am. It's who I am. Oh, and I've seen many searching for answers far and wide. But I know we're all searching for answers. Only you prove that. Because you know just what we need before we say a word. You're a good good father is who you are. Is who you are is who you are. And I'm loved by you is who I am. is who I am. Is who I am. You are perfect in all of your ways.

But Bam said he's the he's the central theme of the entire Bible. We could sing about all that. We could sing the entire Bible. It's all about him this morning. Amen. and how we love him this morning. Amen. Amen. There is a longing only you can feel, a raging tempest. Only you can stand. My soul is thirsting, Lord, to know you as I'm known.

Let's pray. Our gracious father, what can be said of your mercy and your grace? Father, what can be said of your love and your kindness towards us, Father, if we could just care one for another just just in the like manner that you care for us. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful world this would have could be. We ask you to bless us this morning. Father, help us. Encourage our hearts and may we come to the place that we know that we're not alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. that you made a promise that you would never leave us nor forsake us, but that you'd be with us, Father, even in us all the way until the end. The battle seems great sometimes, but we have this confidence that he who is in us is greater than he who is in the world. Encourage us this morning. Once again I pray in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You may be seated. We have a a baby dedication this morning. And uh and uh from the looks of things, we're going to have a lot of these in the future. So uh we just uh trust the Lord to this morning. It's uh William and Kimmy. Uh I I am going to try to pronounce this the best I can. Uh Ayako and if I didn't say that right, um I'm Irish and uh and so we'll do that. But uh uh Brother William and we're going to dedicate baby Stephen this morning. So if they would come, we could sing this song, bring them in, as they come to dedicate their baby this morning. Amen. Oh, bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them. Bring them in. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you Mark David's older or younger? &gt;&gt; Younger. &gt;&gt; Younger. Okay, good. Yeah, he did look quite a bit older than you, so I wanted to make sure I got that right. Sorry, Mark. Anyway, I'd like to read a little story here in the Bible as we dedicate Stephen. And it said, "And when they heard these things, they were cut to their heart, and they nashed on him with their teeth. But he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfast into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. And he said, "Behold, I see the heavens open and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God." And they cried out with loud voices and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid their coats on a young man's feet whose name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, "Laying lay not this sin to their charge." And when he had said this, he fell asleep. Amen. What a great saint to be named after. And I I always this story to me Stephen could be so full of the love of God that that he sin not be laid to I I really think that's marvelous. So as a little Stephen God bless you. Can I shake your hand here? Show everybody this little guy. Now it's a miracle &gt;&gt; that you can go from this little to this big and and just by the life of God and the grace of God. How marvelous is our God. And I think just a baby come into the world just one of the most How can you not know there's a God? He just so real. Oh, brother, we just ask maybe you'd say a prayer over your son and then we'll all pray for him. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Father Lord, um we thank you for today. We thank you for this baby. You gave this baby to us and we're giving him back to you, Father. Um, we commit his way onto your hands for the rest of his life. May he live his life according to your gospel. May he follow in your footstep. May his life be a beacon to everyone else. Wherever his name is echoed, may grace follow. Wherever his name is heckled, may mercy follow. Father Lord, as he leaves his life, may he be a cornerstone, Father Lord, may the uh whip of the enemy not catch him. Father Lord, as he leaves and in this life and as we hope to leave another when we leave this world, may his life be uh a testimony to others. And as um as he grows, may he grows in the light of the word of God. Uh we commit him to your hand today. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, take him in Jesus name. For in Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He did say he cried with a loud voice. So he's just being scripture. Let us pray to our father as this family dedicates this gift that you gave him. Father, may they lives just be an example to him as they raise him according to your word. Father, as we prayed and grace follow him, our gracious father above all things, Lord, we ask kingdom as we've given them to you, Father, that you will rule his life. We ask these things in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord this morning. I am I'm going in and out. Well, one day I'm going up. So, in and out's okay for now. But long as I go up, you know, and there'll be some of us that have to go into the grave. So, we'll have to go down before we go up. But the bottom line is we all want to go up, right? &gt;&gt; That's where why we're here this morning. Thank you. Oh, good. It's good to see you back, Sister Rebecca. Uh yeah. Anyway, I have uh a little uh message on my heart this morning and I I thought just as our brother sang that first song this morning, it just kind of encouraged me that maybe what I have in my heart was would be good. And and uh so we're going to turn in our Bibles to um the book of Ephesians. If we could stand, we'll read our scripture. And it's found in Ephesians the 2 chapter. And uh we'll we'll start with the first verse of the second chapter and and we we'll read um through the ninth verse. And he's speaking uh to you or to us or how you have to place yourself in the scripture. And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespass and sins wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world. And I think we can all say that. Is isn't that true? that &gt;&gt; in times past we all walk to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air. The spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedient. &gt;&gt; So we see there's a spirit and there's a power. &gt;&gt; That's right. that works. Among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath even as others. &gt;&gt; So you have to see that we were in one condition. That's right. &gt;&gt; And something took place that put us in another condition. &gt;&gt; And Paul is drawing the contrast because it's important that you see the contrast. But what we want to emphasize on this morning is what brought us from where that we were to where that we are. And uh and then Paul goes on to try to let this speak out to us. But God, &gt;&gt; that's right. who is rich in mercy for great for his great love wherein he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and kindness towards us through Christ Jesus. For by grace ye are saved through faith and not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, &gt;&gt; not of works, lest any man should boast. Heavenly Father, bless your word. In your precious name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. We know that uh and we're taught that we're and then I'd like to uh greet all the campers that are at Inks Lake. If you're listening in this morning, I hope that you're you're all warm and everything even though it's freezing outside. But we want to greet our campers. they may be listening online this morning. We know we're in a great battle. I think that's one of the things that we we were taught that that there this battle started in heaven. And it was a battle between two kingdoms. And the Lord our God had a a kingdom that he was going to set up. and his kingdom was going to be a kingdom that was lived by and and its glory would be the attributes of God. That's what his kingdom wanted to be. It wanted to be one that was a kingdom that that God could reflect himself through who he was and and what his greatness was. and he he chose this kingdom and in doing so he created a garden and uh you you've got to uh realize God could have created anything he wanted to you know all things are made by him but he chose to create a garden and he chose to have a son uh in that garden that ruled that garden and he would speak and this and and speak that and this would come to pass and and these different things would transpire and he would rule over this garden and then God would come down in the evening and walk with his son and God saw that he his son was lonely and he said it's not good that man should dwell alone so he made for him a helpmate and He took from him a part of his side and and created woman. And Adam said, "She's bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh." And now these two were one. And they were in fellowship with him. And they walked with him. And they were living in this kingdom. And this kingdom was the way that God wanted it to be. his son and his daughter were the way that he wanted them to be. And it was the fellowship and the attributes and the glory of God. I I I wish in my mind I I had even comprehend it, but it hasn't even entered into our hearts and minds the things that God has prepared for them that love him. And so this these kingdoms are are uh what was God's kingdom. Now we're in a battle today between two kingdoms because Lucifer, he did not uh if I could say this, he felt that God was making his kingdom short. In other words, were so much science and education and and there was so much fruits in the tree of knowledge that that that God had chose not to manifest or or to share. And and he felt that these things should be shared that that science should be shared and mathematics and civilization. And Satan had uh he he had a desire for a kingdom or his Eden. So God had an Eden, but Satan desired in Eden. He desired to be worshiped. So you have to see that within Satan, within this tree of good and evil, this tree of knowledge, all laid within him, all these other uh scientific things and achievements of space and technology and and minerals and all the knowledge of of all those things that could be. And God chose not to go that way. But Satan wanted to be worshiped &gt;&gt; as God was worshiped. &gt;&gt; So he wanted to instill or to bring forth his Eden what what he thought man should be. And so he he came into that garden and he he began to uh speak in that garden and began to fellowship with Eve. And and so when they would go through the midst of the garden, uh the serpent or or the beast, he was in the midst of the ar of the garden. In other words, the person, this angel Lucifer that was cast down to earth because he he desired to be worshiped and and exalt himself above above the sons of God. He desired to put his Eden into existence and and he didn't he didn't want to uh wait. God may have had another time for him. There's so many things we don't know &gt;&gt; and uh we might imagine or come up with reasons but nevertheless he wanted to get his message across to Eve. So what he spoke to her, he says if if if you come with me and you be a part of me, he says the reason he doesn't want you to eat these fruits to to partake of my knowledge, to partake of my wisdom, to partake of my ways, the reason he doesn't want you to fellowship with me and become part of me because you'll become like gods, &gt;&gt; you know. So I have something to offer you, you know, uh I I have I have this great wisdom and this great knowledge and and and you'll be able to create and you'll be able to manufacture and you'll be able to invent and and you'll be able to to civilize and and and and grow and do all these great accomplishments, achievements. And if if you come with me and and join yourself to me, uh I will pass on to you all these great things that I know and I possess because I'm the tree of knowledge that is in the midst of the garden. I possess these things and God chose not to let me uh insert all my great wisdom and my great knowledge into this world, but I'm going to do it anyway. So he got a hold of Eve and Eve told them, he told us that you were here and he told us you had these great abilities, but he said, "The day that we parttook of them is the day we'll die." and his cunningness and his deceitfulness. He said, "Surely you won't die." No, you won't die. Surely you won't die. He just added one word, you know, and so she, if I could say it that way, she took the chance or she she failed to all that God had said. And we know that at that time that uh she partook of the fruits of Satan and and she brought this to her husband and and we won't go into that great story but but parttook of also. And then all of a sudden their eyes were opened and they realized what they had done. You know that so many times with our young people is that you know when you're on this side of sin and and you're being enticed and you're being led and and you're being talked to and and it's it's seduction. It's trying to get you to let down your bar. That it's always presented, sin's always presented a as being pleasant &gt;&gt; and good, you know, uh, you know, just just smoke this. You It's great. It makes you feel good. Do this, drink this, listen to this, go here. You know, it it it's just like a a a boy tells a girl, "Oh, I love you. I love you. If you love me, you know, you'd kiss me. You hug me. You know, and and and all those things. It's just all is to get you to move your needle, to pull you over onto the side." And and what happens is listening to it, it it becomes beautiful. It becomes something. Oh, it could be a reality. It could be good. You know, a I'll tell you something. If a boy ever tells you to do something because if you love me, you would do this. That's the same line devil &gt;&gt; that lied to Eve. A boy that loves you will want you to keep your virtue. He'll never try to invade that sacred trust &gt;&gt; that God's given you. a real boy that really loves you. He'd never crossed that line. Becca were sinners. But before this, they they got there. Can it's the same thing. You get enticed, you get talked, sin becomes beautiful. But once you cross that line and you get on the other side and you realize what you've done, that's when the dread sets in. That's when the conviction sets in. That's when the darkness sets in. That that's when you get discouraged. Even now as Christians, when we fail, we become so discouraged and so disgusted with ourselves, you know, how could I do it? How could I fail? How could I I do that? like like the alcoholic who maybe goes so many years and then he gets under pressure and he takes a drink and he falls off the wagon so to speak and now he's so defeated. &gt;&gt; And when Adam and Eve cross over that line, they were defeated. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that they were totally defeated. And the only thing that awaited them was the judgment of God. You understand that God said, "The day that you eat, that day you shall die." And they were gone. And so if I had a title this morning, won't try not to be long, but I'd like to call this grace and mercy is the believer's greatest weapon. &gt;&gt; The greatest weapon against Satan is grace and mercy. As our brother saying, it was mercy &gt;&gt; that rewrote our lives. &gt;&gt; Paul was talking here. He says, "We were once here. We once did these things. We once walked in things." In another place, Peter said, "A man that can't see these things can't see a far off and forgot where he's come from." That is the source of all self-righteousness is a man that can't see where he's come from. &gt;&gt; He forgets that he too once was a sinner &gt;&gt; and that he once walked in the in those places. But if it wasn't for the grace and mercy of God. Paul comes up and he says he says we once did these things but he said God who is rich in mercy &gt;&gt; for his great love towards us loved us when we were dead in sins he hath quickened us together in Christ Jesus for by grace &gt;&gt; ye are saved &gt;&gt; so Adam and Eve were now in the clutches es of the enemy. You understand they stepped out of the protection of God's word. Remember when you step out from behind the word, you step out of the protection of God. Now you're subject &gt;&gt; to the results of that decision. So the the the results of that decision are inevitable. &gt;&gt; In other words, the only thing that Adam and Eve had coming to them now was death. So Satan had achieved what he wanted to achieve. &gt;&gt; He had placed himself in rulership over Adam and Eve. Now he ruled them. They given up. Paul comes back. He says we were once all under this great power, this great influence as has as he said, we walked according to the course of the world by the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh. So now Adam and Eve had the spirit of the power of the air working in them. I want you to see that if I could I wish I was a greater speaker uh to uh uh bring this point but you you have to help me this morning. So they were helpless. So the inevitable result of their decision was looming and pending and about to be carried out. Now the only now they were defenseless against Satan. &gt;&gt; He had already broken them. &gt;&gt; He had broke their will. He had broke their spirit. They did what they done and there was no undoing it. And we all come into that same place &gt;&gt; in our lives. We do things, but we do things now. We're discouraged and angry that we've done them. We can't undo them. We can't deny it. We could cover it. We could cover it re with religion, &gt;&gt; but nevertheless, we within our own selves know that where we're at. &gt;&gt; So now, what is our defense &gt;&gt; against Satan? H how how do I come from now being trapped and now being the prisoner of sin and and now being ruled by this power of the prince and the power of the air? I have no weapon. But the only weapon that had against Satan was the mercy and grace of God. &gt;&gt; That was their only way out. It was their only way to defeat him. It was the only way to be set free was by grace and by mercy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That God would look on them and say, "I know what I said, but I'll provide a way. &gt;&gt; I'll step in." Grace is when the inevitable outcome and the pending outcome is inevitable. In other words, it's going to happen. But God chooses to intervene and change the inevitable outcome. &gt;&gt; That's grace. &gt;&gt; Grace is our weapon and mercy becomes our weapon. It becomes the only defense. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The only thing that we have that keeps us from being completely destroyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was going to happen to Adam and Eve was going to happen. So God provided them. I want you to look at if I could place that in your thinking. He provided for them. The only weapon &gt;&gt; that would defeat Satan was his mercy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And his grace. Paul said, "You were all there, but God rich &gt;&gt; in mercy &gt;&gt; cuz his mercy endureth forever." And grace is the intervention and the application of that mercy. So grace and mercy became their only way in the days of Noah when the world got so corrupt that it was totally going to be destroyed. Man had finally crossed over the line. God couldn't take it anymore. And he said within himself, I'm going to destroy the whole thing. But then the only weapon man had against the impending destruction was God's mercy. now and his grace to take that mercy and put it in action and change the impending destruction that was going to come upon the earth and provide man a way of escape. And he built an ark. God's always provided man way of mercy. &gt;&gt; And and we're in a battle. &gt;&gt; We know that we're in a battle between these two kingdoms. And the and and the life I is is a warfare. And Satan warth against us. He's continually wanting to present to us his kingdom, his ideas, his way of doing things, the things that he thinks is right. You know, man is always trying to to come up with his own code of justice &gt;&gt; and his own code of fairness. But there had to be something that was the the north star. There had to be something that was the beginning of all righteousness. And the beginning of all righteousness is God's word &gt;&gt; because he's the creator. &gt;&gt; So he's the original and any other thought and any other idea other than the original is a counterfeit. &gt;&gt; It's bogus. And when somebody has got the expertise, they can look at a bogus dollar or a counterfeit dollar in a real dollar and tell you what's real. &gt;&gt; A painting, a real expert can tell you that it's what's real and what's not. Well, this counterfeit of Satan is so close. It would deceive those who didn't have the weapon &gt;&gt; of grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without grace, &gt;&gt; without mercy, you too would be deceived. &gt;&gt; You too once walked in the darkness of this world. You too once were entangled in the by the power and the spirit of the prince of power that works in the air, principality and spiritual wickedness in high places. You too were subject to those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But by grace &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; and mercy. That's the weapon that defeated Satan. Without it, we're doomed. The the battles between these two kingdoms, the word of God, and man keeps coming up with what he thinks is righteous. He he he he doesn't think it's righteous that we should discriminate or preach against or speak against human choice. If a man chooses he wants to be a woman or a woman chooses she wants to be a man, you you shouldn't speak against that. &gt;&gt; That's human righteousness. That's the carnal mind. &gt;&gt; And the carnal mind is an enemy of God. It's at emnity. In other words, it can't fit. &gt;&gt; It can't blend. &gt;&gt; And that's what Leo see is. These two kingdoms are opposed one to another. &gt;&gt; They were opposed one to another in the beginning. And that battle came from heaven down to earth. And it ended up in the Garden of Eden. And that battle's still going on today. &gt;&gt; And we know where that battle is. It's in your mind. &gt;&gt; Satan is always pouring stuff &gt;&gt; into our mind. He's always trying to bring us under captivity. &gt;&gt; And God's always trying to set the captive free. &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring your mind under captivity. He's trying to bring your the the history of your wrongdoing against you. He's trying to make you feel hopeless. He He's trying to make you feel that that the impending doom of your actions will be upon you, that now you've done wrong and and now you're going to receive the the the the benefits of it. And and and you would reap what you sow, but the only WEAPON YOU HAVE AGAINST IT is the mercy and grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand? I'm trying that. It's your weapon. &gt;&gt; If you didn't have that working for you, &gt;&gt; do you think you could find your way back? &gt;&gt; You couldn't find your way back to God for nothing. your carnality, your human mind, &gt;&gt; your nature, &gt;&gt; your common everyday mistakes would make it seem totally impossible for you ever to get back into the favor of God. You wouldn't even think, "How could I ever get back in this grace? How could I ever get back in this favor? How could I ever get back to where I could feel in my heart, if God be for me, who can be against me? I I I I I look at my life and I I see a shipwreck. I see a failure. What? How am I going to get from this condition back to peace &gt;&gt; and joy that surpasseth all understanding? How am I going to get back to freedom? What what do I have that that I've got that can fight the condition I'm in that can fight the mistakes that I've made, the the failures that I've accumulated? You know, I I I I crossed the line so many times. What do I have to bring me back? There's only one weapon &gt;&gt; you have against Satan, and that's grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing you have. &gt;&gt; It's his mercy &gt;&gt; and his grace. &gt;&gt; And his grace endureth forever. &gt;&gt; And his mercies endureth forever. It's the only thing that man has &gt;&gt; else he would be defeated. &gt;&gt; Paul goes on to say, "But not of works, &gt;&gt; lest any man should boast. &gt;&gt; It's by grace and by mercy. By grace ye are saved through faith, &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. It is the gift OF GOD." HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It's God's gift to you. &gt;&gt; It's God's weapon. &gt;&gt; The only thing he's given you that you can defeat this man with this evil kingdom that wars against you, that's seeking TO DEVOUR YOU, THAT'S TRYING to get you to be a member, THAT'S TRYING TO GET you to become UNDER ITS POWER. AND THERE'S STILL TOO MANY OF US TODAY THAT ARE UNDER THE POWER OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; But praise God, there's a way out. &gt;&gt; Praise God, we have a weapon &gt;&gt; that defeats him every time. &gt;&gt; And it's grace and mercy. If you read the book of Psalms, David is in this battle. He knows where he came from. He was a shepherd boy. Didn't have no ability to be king. Doesn't have any influence. doesn't have anything &gt;&gt; but election. &gt;&gt; The only thing he has. God said, "I'll choose David &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take him from the sheephold and I'm going to put him on the throne." David didn't know he didn't have any ability, but he trusted &gt;&gt; in the grace of God. He trusted that God would intervene, that the inevitable outcome of his decisions, that God would insert himself and change the outcome of his actions. If people do certain things, if you put water in your gasoline, the inevitable outcome that car is going to sputter and die. You understand what I mean by the inevitable outcome. Another the actions produce these results. That's why they say the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same things over and over again and expect a different result. &gt;&gt; Well, the only way you'll ever get a different result is the grace of God. I don't care what pattern your life is in. &gt;&gt; That pattern may produce the same thing. But if the weapon of God comes into your life, WHICH IS THE GRACE OF GOD, it'll change that pattern. &gt;&gt; It'll change that result. Right. &gt;&gt; That's your weapon. &gt;&gt; That's what he gave us. &gt;&gt; That's what we know that we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Satan starts beating down on us and destroying us and taking our joy from us and taking our life from us and taking our will to go forward and putting us into give up, I JUST DON'T GOT IT. I JUST CAN'T LIVE IT. I JUST CAN'T MAKE IT. THERE'S ONE THING THAT YOU HAVE. THAT'S GOD'S MERCY. &gt;&gt; That is merciful. &gt;&gt; I'm glad we don't get what we deserve. &gt;&gt; But what made the difference? Mercy, brother. &gt;&gt; Rewrote &gt;&gt; my life. &gt;&gt; That was the only weapon I had against Satan. Satan, you've got me. I'm trapped. You've tricked me into it. You've put me in this condition. I'm in bad shape. I'm a failure. What do I have to redeem me? What do I have? What's the only thing I've got? My impending doom? Mercy. Mercy. &gt;&gt; Have mercy on me, &gt;&gt; Lord. have mercy. &gt;&gt; Please, by your grace, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't let me receive what I've got coming to me. &gt;&gt; I plead grace and mercy. Grace and mercy is is why that he went to the cross. Not only did he provide the way for Adam and Eve by God through promise, God will said, "I'll put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed." In other words, I'LL BREAK THE CHAIN and the power of the sin that's GOING TO BE PASSED ON FROM FATHER TO DAUGHTER to son to after generations and generations. That man was born in sin, came into the world speaking lies, full of iniquity. He said, "That's the chain. That's the inevitable result. That's the fruit by which Satan is going to build his kingdom. &gt;&gt; He's going to build it on lies. And everybody's going to come into the world speaking those lies. &gt;&gt; They start in kindergarten, speaking the lies, getting you educated, getting more money, getting a higher living, doing this, find your place in the kingdom. They get counselors. I'll never forget it. I couldn't believe it. I went to one of those counselors and they had me fill out all this paper and and and everything and and uh this is no insult to my good friend uh James Hayes, but they decided that I'd make a good airplane pilot. That's what they said I should become, an airplane pilot. Well, I decided I'd find something that took me a lot farther than the sky. &gt;&gt; But that was only by grace. &gt;&gt; That's what they wanted me to do. Pick a career. Pick a a way that you'll go. I mean, it's embred in us because Satan is preaching his kingdom, right? What you're going to do is you're going to live and then you're going to either have wealth to pass it down to your generation and pass your inheritance down and and and that and you get into this whole mindset and this whole world uh and you get all the burdens with it. You got to go to school and you got to work two jobs and you got to do this and it becomes a whole weight, &gt;&gt; right? And he's been selling us that forever. &gt;&gt; And here comes one along full of grace and mercy. And he says, "I've never seen the righteous bake bread." &gt;&gt; A man that's tasted of the mercy and grace of God is content in whatever state he's in. He doesn't need the riches of the world &gt;&gt; because he's rich in faith. &gt;&gt; He's got faith to know that he has a merciful God &gt;&gt; and a God full of grace and that that grace is sufficient for us because his strength is made perfect in our weakness. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we start to veer and we start to let this influence of the world come in. And then we decide that we have to come up with some sort form of works to be righteous. And now we're stuck in the cycle of our flesh trying to find our reward or find our liberty or find our freedom or find our deliverance. And you'll never find deliverance. You'll never find freedom. You'll never find escape outside the mercy and grace of God because that's our weapon. That's the one thing that you possess. &gt;&gt; That defeats the enemy &gt;&gt; is God's grace and his mercy. &gt;&gt; You can look on your children and they may seem hopeless. I know what it's like when teenagers get rebellious and they just quit listening to you and now they finally think that that's the day that they can whoop you. I don't care. I could never whoop my dad. I don't know. I was always I I wouldn't even want to get in a fight with him. I don't know. But you know, you get to the place you just don't think you have to listen and you want to go to the mall and they don't want you to go to the mall because they know there's nothing but a bunch of devils down at the mall. But oh, you just want to go to the mall. That's where everybody's going. wide is the way to the destruction. And you're going to get there and then you're going to start playing those games and some little boy's going to walk around and he thinks you're cute and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. And then you think you're in love. Oh, I met the cutest little boy at the mall. And you just got to go down to the mall so you can get another look at him. and you're just going gone wrong. &gt;&gt; And then what are you going to do? You're going to have to rely on the grace and mercy of God &gt;&gt; to make your life right again. Like we were talking of David. You know what David's sin was? Everybody thinks it's Bath Sheba. But it started before that. &gt;&gt; It started when he began to count his might. And he be started began to look at his kingdom &gt;&gt; and he and he started listening to the people sing of his exploits. &gt;&gt; Saul's kind killed a thousand but David's killed 10,000 that drove Paul to want to smite David. And David was on the run just the type of Christ. his whole life was playing out and he relied on the mercy and he relied on the grace of God. Even I believe it was Abigail, wasn't it, that came and fell at his feet and says, "My husband's a foolish man." He speaks to the foolish man. I know that you're king. Be merciful. And David showed mercy. But when David quit relying on that mercy, when he kept quit relying on that grace where that no longer became his weapon to fight the enemy and he began to count for himself his works. &gt;&gt; That's when he began to fail. And when he got in that condition, then he felt he he could do what he had to do &gt;&gt; for Basha. He departed from his weapon. Do you understand what I'm saying? The weapon you have against Satan is God's mercy. &gt;&gt; You've got to call on that mercy. You've got to ask for that grace. &gt;&gt; Without you, Lord, I cannot make this journey. &gt;&gt; I will not be in the rapture without your grace and your mercy. &gt;&gt; I will not be over to overcome. &gt;&gt; It's given to the overcomer. How do we overcome? We overcome by grace. by God intervening in our lives and changing the outcome of our mistakes. &gt;&gt; You can get a bitter heart and a bitter spirit. You know, if you get mad at your parents, they're not going to quit loving you. &gt;&gt; But you're going to be all tore up &gt;&gt; and it's all going on in your head. And then it goes into your heart and it goes into your feelings and it goes into your actions and you don't even realize how ridiculous it is. We used to kind of laugh at our kids when they were younger. They would try to go sit someplace else so nobody would know that they belong to us. Yeah. They walk up to Matthew GO, "YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR DADDY." Who's that? They knew who they were. Wasn't that what we want to start coming is knowing who we are? &gt;&gt; We're the children of the living God. &gt;&gt; We're in a battle. Satan's always imposing the world on us. And if we depart from grace and mercy as being our weapon against the enemy, if we don't rely on his mercy, we don't rely on his grace, then we're doomed. And when David finally came back to the grace and mercy of God and he went back to the righteous judgments of God and he pronounced his own death, let the man who's done this be slain. &gt;&gt; That's right. In other words, David finally got back to the place is I'm worthy of death for what I've done. &gt;&gt; And the stamina said, "David, it's you. You took that man's lamb. You killed that man. You're guilty." And you know what David said? Let it be un done unto me even as I've declared it. He was willing to die for his sin. We'd be a lot better off having that attitude than trying to cover it up with some sort of carnal &gt;&gt; uh excuse. As a prophet of God said, passing the buck. &gt;&gt; Oh, he made me do it. &gt;&gt; That's what Eve did. &gt;&gt; Oh, Adam did. Oh, she made me do it. &gt;&gt; Always trying to pass the buck. &gt;&gt; David said, "Let it be done unto me." &gt;&gt; David was facing the impending outcome of his decisions. But what saved David? Saul said, "He has mercy on you &gt;&gt; and grace." &gt;&gt; All through the Bible, when you read the when you read the the New Testament, remember the New Testament was the exodus from law &gt;&gt; to grace. where man was no longer going to live by the law, but they were going to live by the grace and mercy of God. They were going to live by God. now having mercy and inserting himself into the equation to change what the result would be. So God changes the result of man's decisions by grace. And now he was passing from the age of law to the age of grace and mercy. Now grace and mercy was going to become man's weapon, not the law. And they come upon a lady, Mary Magdalene, and she's caught in adultery. And now she's fixing to be stoned. That's what they did. They took it out and they would stone it. Her doom was set. The impending doom of her decisions were set. But there came one on the scene and he started writing, "Which of you that hath no sin cast the first stone?" What saved Mary Magdalene from the sin that Satan trapped her into wasn't the law. Did you know if she would have been stoned, she would have paid the punishment for that sin and she may have had a path to heaven. That's what the law did. It purged them. It purged the sin out. How many of you want to live under that? That's why they had priests and they had judges and it got more complicated and washing of pots and pans and and it got all that place and he come down and he said all the commandments &gt;&gt; are all in these. Love thy neighbor as thyself and love God with your whole mind, your whole heart, your whole soul. It was a transition from the law to grace. And there she was. And he says, he finally looks at her and says, "Where are your accusers?" And she says, "There's none, Lord, to accuse me but you." And he said, "Neither will I accuse you. Go your way. &gt;&gt; I have mercy on you. &gt;&gt; The grace of God has showed up to keep you from the impending outcome of your actions. Grace and mercy &gt;&gt; was Magdalina's only weapon against what Satan had done. &gt;&gt; She couldn't undo it. She couldn't have blamed anybody else. But God, rich in mercy &gt;&gt; and full of grace. Legion. The man possessed with devils. &gt;&gt; Full of devils. How many? What's your name? Legion. He had devils. A legion of devils. He was possessed of the devil. He would throw on people. He'd roam the graveyards. They try to chain him. How was he gonna get out of that condition? No way. He couldn't think his way out of it. He couldn't act his way out of it. The only weapon that Legion had against the demons that possessed him was the mercy and grace of God. Do you understand that? That's your weapon. It's what God's given us to defeat him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is his mercy, his love wherein he so loved us, he gave his only begotten son. Where God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherein he loved us. Even when we were dead in sin, hath quickened us together with him. By grace ye are saved. What a great weapon. The only way she had to escape Satan was the grace and mercy of God. The 10 lepers, the only way they had to escape the 10 lepers with leprosy was the grace and mercy of God. &gt;&gt; That was their only way out of leprosy. Leprosy is a type of sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. Leprosy is a type of habitual sin, habit forming sin where it now becomes a part of your life. You incorporate it in your life. You go about all the other things that you do in life normal except for your one addiction. Whether it's smoking, whether it's drugs, whether it's anger, whether it's temper, whether it's bitterness, you know, and sins are imaginations, all those things we cast down. &gt;&gt; And it's a leprosy. It's a spot and a wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Then the only way of escape, you have no power over it. &gt;&gt; If you smoke, &gt;&gt; that's a tough devil. &gt;&gt; You can try patches. You can try everything. But you know what's your weapon is? &gt;&gt; Mercy &gt;&gt; and grace. &gt;&gt; God have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; Give me your grace. &gt;&gt; Father, take this from me. &gt;&gt; Take my fault. Take my anger. Take my bitterness. Take my loneliness. Take all these things that Satan has put on my life. Oh, this might not seem like the great deep revelation. I could preach to you about the four horse riders and the son of man and God veiling himself in this last day and and how that the son of man's work and how that you now are the word of God and and you are the voice of God to this generation and and and you're the brideg of Christ. You're the bride now. But let me tell you something. The prophet of God said, "If Satan can take your weapon away from you, you become as a sounding temple, &gt;&gt; a sounding brass, a tinkling symbol. &gt;&gt; You have all this revelation &gt;&gt; and you have no victory. You don't lay your hands on the sick and they get well by your power. &gt;&gt; You lay your hands on the sick get well by the grace and mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could get grace and mercy down, THEN WE WOULD UNDERSTAND IT'S BY HIS mercy we see the seals. IT'S BY HIS GRACE we recognize Malachi 4:5. &gt;&gt; You didn't choose me. I chose you. &gt;&gt; It's by his grace and mercy we see we're in Lady Oia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We understand what it is we have working for us. &gt;&gt; What's working for us is grace &gt;&gt; and mercy. I don't care how bad you are. &gt;&gt; I could just I'd like to read the way the brother Brandham said it if it would be all right &gt;&gt; with you, but he says it like this. Let me say this, my sinner friend. You may be here this morning a prostitute. We wouldn't know it, would we? Maybe be here this morning a woman chaser. You may be here a drunkard or a gambler or a murderer. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; You might be here as an impure husband, an impure wife. &gt;&gt; You might be the vilest of sinners. &gt;&gt; And you say, "I'm a past the stage of redemption." &gt;&gt; No, you're not. or you wouldn't be at church this morning. Grace will make a way for you in this dark hour if you'll just accept it. &gt;&gt; Adam had to be willing to accept it. So, do you accept it? &gt;&gt; You understand? It becomes your weapon. It's your if it's the the only thing you have, but it's too simple. We try to replace it. And I believe in anointing, don't get me wrong. You know what anointing is? When you're anointed to do something, that means you're called &gt;&gt; to do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The anointing means that God is going to provide to you the tools to carry out the task that he assigns you. &gt;&gt; That's what it means to be anointed. It doesn't mean it's a feeling. &gt;&gt; But it means God equipped you to do the job. If I'm anointed to be a pastor, &gt;&gt; then God will equip me with the tools to do the job. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be the elegant speaker. &gt;&gt; I don't have to come up with great &gt;&gt; things. That's not what if the anointing's there. &gt;&gt; In other words, I've been anointed or called for the task. &gt;&gt; He will provide the sermons. He'll provide the the the way THAT HAS SPOKEN. HE'LL PROVIDE THE NATURE. HE'LL PROVIDE THE WISDOM BY HIS GRACE &gt;&gt; AND BY HIS MERCY &gt;&gt; TO CARRY OUT THE TASK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And if he started a work in you, he'll finish it by his grace &gt;&gt; and by his mercy. You could go through the Bible. You could talk about the maniac. You could go all through the scripture. The lady coming down the throat with her dead son. The whole ministry of Jesus is the revelation of grace and mercy. that we've passed from grace to mercy. And now by this grace and mercy, we are going to enter into a third exodus where we break the chain that Satan has on our flesh. And we break that chain by his grace and his mercy. It's our greatest weapon in the battle in your mind. When your mind starts to fail you and the ability of your flesh starts to fail you, remember my strength is made perfect &gt;&gt; and weakness by grace. &gt;&gt; My grace Paul &gt;&gt; is sufficient for you. My intervention in your life to change the outcome of things is what you have to rely on. Things may be messed up where you are right now. You don't like how you've been treated. Maybe you're misunderstood. It doesn't matter what burden this kingdom of the world has put on you. You're not of this world. &gt;&gt; This is not our home. &gt;&gt; This is not our kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only chance we have of making it out of here is by the mercy &gt;&gt; and grace of God. &gt;&gt; The woman that washed Jesus' feet was stuck in the life she was in. And she ran to the throne of mercy. and started to wash his feet. &gt;&gt; And he looked at all of them around him and said, you know, all your righteousness, but she has not quit crying and weeping and washing my feet with her tears and wiping it with her hair. She whose sins are many are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more. &gt;&gt; You're forgiven. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What brought her from that condition to life eternal? Grace and mercy. It was her greatest weapon. It's our greatest weapon. Trust it. Accept it. &gt;&gt; Ask for it. &gt;&gt; It's here for you this morning. &gt;&gt; If you're I don't care what vile shape you're in. You can look back and all you're seeing is all the places he trapped you. Our prophet of God said, "You were tricked into it. You were trapped into it by your first nature. Paul said, "We were all did this. We all walk like this." But if you want to be saved this morning, you want to be delivered this morning. It won't be my by my prayer. It won't be by a great sound of music by our talented instruments. &gt;&gt; It won't be by the sweet anointing that comes. And I love the anointing. I love songs. The choir, the little quartet that sang that harmony that bless my soul. The songs that were sung about mercy, it thrilled me. They just told me of the grace and the mercy. But I've got to go &gt;&gt; and take that mercy &gt;&gt; as my weapon and say, "Satan, by the mercy of God, &gt;&gt; you are defeated. Satan, by God's grace, your chain is broken. &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy through faith. Faith in his mercy. Faith in his grace. Do you have the faith to believe that he could be merciful to you? With all our adultery and all of our anger and all of our cursing, can we have faith that he's merciful? &gt;&gt; Can we have faith that his grace will intervene? &gt;&gt; Not of yourselves, but by grace. It's our weapon. And I wanted to leave that with you this morning. Don't ever think of ourselves above that which we really are. But just remember everything we have is by his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's by his mercy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's by his eternal love. &gt;&gt; And it's by his promise. I promise you I'll not leave you nor forsake you. &gt;&gt; I promise you if I started a work in you, I'll finish it. &gt;&gt; I promise you nothing can pluck you out of the palm &gt;&gt; of my hand. Yes. &gt;&gt; I promise you, no matter what you've done, if you're faithful and just to confess it, I'll be faithful and just to forgive you. Rely on his mercy. Rely on his grace. Rididge your hearts of bitterness. Father, forgive my trespasses &gt;&gt; as I forgive those who trespass against me. I have a lot of people who have hurt me over the years, done things to me that have broken my heart, &gt;&gt; that have hurt me so bad that I never wanted to enter behind a pulpit again in my life, but by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. and mercy. &gt;&gt; It's all we've got. &gt;&gt; But yet, it's the greatest weapon &gt;&gt; in our arsenal, &gt;&gt; the word of God, grace and mercy, &gt;&gt; the attributes of God. We've never reached the mark. We haven't reached our full potential, but it's the grace of God that keeps us going. &gt;&gt; Let's rely on it. Let's accept it. Let's realize that everything that we are this morning is by his grace. &gt;&gt; If some hardship has come your way, his grace delivers you &gt;&gt; out of all trouble. If unfairness has come your way, his grace &gt;&gt; heals all the wounds. &gt;&gt; And I can't look at all the things that I feel that were done wrong. I can only look at the one thing that was really done right. And that was his death on the cross &gt;&gt; for me. &gt;&gt; And I don't deserve anything. I don't think any of us deserve anything but God rich in mercy &gt;&gt; for the love that he has for us by grace we're saved. Let us stand. Maybe if the musicians would come. If we could bow our heads as they play something soft this morning. Maybe we could ask ourselves this morning. Maybe you could ask yourself this morning. Do you need the mercy of the Lord this morning in your life? Do you need his grace? Maybe you've never given your heart to him. because you've always let your past and your knowledge of your sins and the kind of person that you really are hold you back. But I want to tell you this morning, his mercy overcomes that and his grace, changes us. Maybe you've never experienced it, but you'd like to lift your hand this morning. You don't have to come to the altar. If you'd like to come to the altar and be prayed for, we'd be happy to pray for you. We were all once sinners who walked under the power and the influence of the prince of the air. the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience. If this morning you say, "I don't want that spirit to work in me anymore. I don't want to be a part of that kingdom, but I want to be a part of the kingdom of God." And you'd like to slip your hand up, say, "Lord, I I need this mercy. I just put it way up where he could see it. Up to like you mean it. Lord, I got things in my life I I need your mercy and grace and I'm having faith in that mercy and that grace. It's my weapon, Father, to break every chain. Father, you know the hearts. You see the hands, Father, that are raised. But most of all, above the hand, Lord, you look into the heart. Father, for those who have never been baptized, we have a formula in the Bible. When they asked him, they said, "Men and brethren, m what must we do?" The scripture says, "Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost said,"Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. You shall receive this continuous ongoing neverending mercy and grace of God being with you even in you all the days of your life. He said if we're faithful and just to confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive them. And if you've never been baptized and you'd like to be baptized, the pool is ready. There's men of God all throughout the building who can baptize you. Find a deacon, find a minister, find somebody and let them know that you want to be baptized and you want the mercy of grace of God to be in your life. And you know that that mercy is your only escape. If you've got some addiction, remember, not by strength, not by might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. By my mercy and my grace, I forgive you and I'll transform you. Lord, I believe that I ask you to help me personally this morning. Father, overcome my many complexes, my many fears, my many thoughts. Father, I rely on your mercy to make a difference in my life this morning. Father, I ask you bless each person, each hand that went up. Father, now we commit them into your hands that you will lead them and guide them in the steps that they would take. And I pray, Father, that they understand it's your mercy and your grace that is their path. to freedom. I ask these things this morning in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. God bless you. I'm going to ask brother Billy to come and lead us in some worship. If you need prayer, you want to be baptized, we're here for you. God richly bless you. Praise God. Praise grace that will pardon and cleanse with him. Oh great, great God. Grace is greater than all I've seen. Oh my goodness. Grace of the loving. Oh grace that exceeds our seed. Oh y the blood of the lamb wash all the way. Oh God, oh grace God. Grace is greater than all. I sing. Oh, and see and spread the soul. Oh yes, grace. his grace of joy. Hope to reuge the mighty God for the great God. Preacher God with all the praise. God praise God. &gt;&gt; Where would I be? You are it all and I'm glad you see through Christ. &gt;&gt; Just think about it this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, where would I be? &gt;&gt; Where would I be? You know, you know, our testimony this morning. Hallelujah. Holy God. Oh, amazing grace. Amazing. I see the sound. Oh, what an empty. Oh, amazing. Amazing. Oh, what an amazing way. Oh, what an amazing name. Amazing. Hallelujah. Oh, what a hopeless king. Oh, what a feeling. Oh, God. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But brother Tim W, if you could just come and sing that song again that you sang this morning. Amen. Amen. What a grace that would make a way that we may be called sons and daughters of God this morning. Amen. For years I traveled down a road of wrong. My heart had lost its joy and I I lost my song. But your grace, it came and placed me right where I belong. And your mercy, Lord, it rro my life. Oh Lord, your mercy will reoll my life. Oh Lord, your mercy, it rerote my life. Oh, I should have fallen and my soul passed down, but your mercy it rerow my life. Sing that again now. Oh Lord, your mercy, it'll reroll my life. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, your mercy, it'll reroll my life. Will I should? I've fallen and my soul passed down, but your mercy it rolled my life. All my mistakes that day, Lord, you turn to miracles. My tears and my sorrows, you turn in to joy. And all my past sins are forgiven. And I saw my name written that day. Your mercy it came and reroll my life. Oh Lord, your mercy has re my life. Oh Lord, your mercy, it'll reroll my life. Will I should have fallen and my soul passed down but your mercy it reroll my life. Say it again now. Oh Lord, your mercy has reroll my life. Oh mercy, it reroll my life. Will I should have fallen and my soul pass down but your mercy it'll re roll my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Grace and mercy this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What am I telling if you could just come and dismiss us this morning? That's the song of our heart. And every day, every footstep we take is grace and mercy. Amen. It's by our heads, hearts. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just approach that throne of mercy and grace. Lord, I got to thinking about if we had a testimony service here right now in this building about the grace and mercy in each one of our lives. Lord, we'd be here for months, &gt;&gt; months, Lord. Lord, and your word says that it's new every day, &gt;&gt; Lord. That inexhaustible mercy and grace. We are so thankful, Lord, that you reminded us today, Lord, that it truly is our greatest weapon. As the enemy comes in, Lord, may we stand and fight. It's by your grace, Lord, that we can stand. It's by your grace that we can fight. It's by your grace that we're here today. Lord, we just want to thank you and praise you, Lord, for the word that we've heard. Lord, if there be one that hasn't experienced this mercy and grace, may they know just now &gt;&gt; that it's there for them. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I pray that you'd move on their heart to talk to somebody after this service, Lord, cuz there's so much mercy and grace, Lord. Thank you. Just pray that you'd be with us as we leave. Pray that you'd restore our pastor for pouring out from his heart, Lord God, what you've put in it till we meet again. Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, V. Amen. God bless. You are dismissed. Oh, thank you for the cross, Lord. and thank you for what you Oh, bear in all my sin and shame. Lord, and in love you came and gave amazing grace. Oh, and thank you for the smile, Lord. Oh, thank you for the name of his name. Wash me in your cleansing flow. Now all I know is your forgiveness can bring all worthy to seated on the throne.
