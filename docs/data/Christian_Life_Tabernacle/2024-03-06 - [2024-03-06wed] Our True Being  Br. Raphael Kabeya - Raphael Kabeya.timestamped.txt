[40:21] surgery but it was needed that surgery
[40:24] was
[40:26] needed
[40:29] I said well I'm in your hands
[40:31] [Music]

[40:46] test and and all kinds of
[40:49] test and that really got my wife very

[42:05] wife was really
[42:09] tired he helped me in a lot of things to
[42:12] to walk
[42:14] again but the most important
[42:16] thing is
[42:20] today I can also meet you on this side
[42:23] of
[42:24] Eternity may let his name be blessed
[42:31] be I I I couldn't stay in brazaville
[42:34] because there was a lot of
[42:37] work I thought about coming here so I
[42:40] can rest a little
[42:43] bit and by the grace of God I feel a
[42:46] little bit a lot
[42:48] better so I can do something for
[42:51] God so then let's
[42:54] stand so we can read the word of God
[43:10] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse
[43:14] 15 excuse
[43:26] me
[43:39] now this I say Brethren that flesh and
[43:42] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[43:45] neither that corruption inherit
[43:49] incorruption may the Lord bless the
[43:51] reading of his word and may have your
[43:56] seats
[43:58] the subject I would like to to to speak
[44:00] on
[44:05] tonight is our true
[44:10] being our true
[44:14] being because at the light of the
[44:17] revealed
[44:21] message in this uh Dark Age that that of
[44:25] confusion that we are living in
[44:30] the revealed word has told us of what we
[44:33] are made
[44:36] of as human being what we are made
[44:41] of a human being is a Triumph Triumph
[44:47] being I'm just going to introduce my
[44:51] subject I I can also just stop at the in
[44:56] introduction
[44:58] we believe that we are all at the end
[45:05] time the the the uh Global uh uh events
[45:10] are showing us that we are living in the
[45:11] end
[45:15] time we're living at the time where man
[45:19] history will come to an
[45:21] end because God has to enter in the on
[45:25] scene
[45:28] all those mod events are showing the
[45:31] same
[45:36] thing there's inumerable signs that are
[45:40] flashing out throughout the
[45:42] world showing that there's no more
[45:47] time you can see the the just uh uh uh
[45:52] um evil of around us criminality you
[45:56] look
[46:00] criminality Satanism is being expanded
[46:07] everywhere the the uh man being deprived
[46:10] of morals and the the social
[46:15] media uh gay marriage and all those
[46:23] things in observing the group that
[46:25] received the evening light
[46:30] the message that's being preached over
[46:31] the pulpit by Brother
[46:34] David it it it looks like in this
[46:41] time the message and the messenger they
[46:45] almost look like a
[46:52] failure everyone that's come in contact
[46:55] with the message they've come to the
[46:56] realization that the message is true and
[47:00] Powerful but with the time that's going
[47:07] by it seems like as time go by people
[47:10] are looking at the message and the me
[47:12] Messenger as a
[47:19] failure there is all kinds of question
[47:22] mark in people mind in people that are
[47:24] not focusing to the message that's been
[47:26] given
[47:34] we have seen Great Men of God stand up
[47:36] and turn their backs and say that the
[47:38] prophet is not true
[47:43] Prophet they have seen a contradiction
[47:46] in the message that was brought to us by
[47:48] the pillar of
[47:53] fire the this message that was
[47:56] Vindicated by by the supernatural that's
[47:58] never been seen
[47:59] before and other
[48:05] things a time of multiplication of
[48:08] doctrines throughout the
[48:12] world and that's why I would like to
[48:14] speak on our true
[48:18] being there were so many interpret
[48:21] particular interpretation of the
[48:25] message I don't know how it was
[48:27] happening on this
[48:30] end but to us
[48:36] many they've brought things in that the
[48:39] second coming had already happened in
[48:43] 63 others were already in millenniums
[48:46] with the
[48:47] message leadership and the spirit of
[48:52] leadership with a lot of uh
[48:55] Pride it went throughout all the
[49:01] nations and these things have have
[49:03] brought a lot of Believers to become
[49:06] cold and they have returned to the
[49:09] things that they had once
[49:11] vomited brothers and
[49:13] sisters brother Bram
[49:17] says it's Satan that is trying to do his
[49:20] best so we can
[49:24] fail but never the L the predestinated
[49:28] SE that the elected of
[49:31] God will never be will never be uh uh uh
[49:36] uh uh
[49:39] deceived standing because God said that
[49:43] we will never be
[49:45] deceived then with all this
[49:49] confusion it seems like we are being
[49:52] conquered but don't worry about it the
[49:56] prophet says
[49:59] it's always in a weakness in the weakest
[50:06] moment it's that's when God comes on the
[50:09] scene for something that he prepared
[50:11] before and
[50:15] says in the end time
[50:18] evangelism paragraph
[50:22] 22 says
[50:25] this
[50:28] it's always in them weakest
[50:31] moments when it looks like the true
[50:35] message and this message is the true
[50:39] message regardless of whatever state you
[50:42] find
[50:43] yourself believe me this message is the
[50:46] true
[50:47] message those that go away from it that
[50:51] say that it's not a true message
[50:54] did did that
[50:58] what else can they propose to us if you
[51:01] leave this
[51:02] message where are you going to
[51:06] go what is better than this message
[51:08] that's going to touch your
[51:10] heart this message is the cap
[51:14] Stone
[51:16] says when when it seems
[51:19] like that the true message is about
[51:24] defeated that's when God steps
[51:31] in he let the message and the messenger
[51:35] get to the end of the
[51:37] road see
[51:40] [Music]
[51:42] then then he comes on he comes in and he
[51:46] rides on the W high on the waves that's
[51:50] right we can see that in the Old
[51:54] Testament Moses was a great messenger
[51:58] he was a great a really great
[52:01] messenger he had signs and wonders
[52:03] follow him in
[52:05] Egypt but when they came
[52:07] out when they come to the the at the at
[52:11] the start of the Red
[52:13] Sea Moses looked like he was
[52:17] defeated the the army of the Egypt was
[52:19] in the
[52:21] back a hill to the right a mountain to
[52:23] the left before the sea
[52:29] and the
[52:32] mockers dayon and cor was saying to each
[52:35] other where are you taking
[52:38] us let's go and and and give ourselves
[52:41] back
[52:42] in we're going to go back and just go
[52:44] back to Egypt where are we going to go
[52:47] now
[52:49] says it's when you come to the
[52:52] end that that's when God comes on the
[52:55] scene
[52:57] and when God came on the
[52:58] scene as Moses was working with God
[53:02] Moses pronounced the
[53:04] word he said these Egyptians that you
[53:07] see now you shall see them no
[53:10] more it was by
[53:14] inspiration because God had to come on
[53:17] the scene for something that he had
[53:18] already
[53:19] prepared he he hit the water with the S
[53:23] and the water opened
[53:25] up the the markers were
[53:29] surprised the markers in this
[53:32] age they will be the same there will be
[53:35] there will
[53:37] be the message will create a
[53:41] way but there's a lot of testimonies in
[53:43] the Old Testament the three young
[53:46] Hebrews before the
[53:50] fire they were convincing them so they
[53:53] can deny their faith you're going to die
[53:56] young
[53:57] what is it for
[53:59] you but they were
[54:02] convinced when you are convinced and you
[54:05] are
[54:06] concerned you're never going to fear
[54:09] anything because our God will always be
[54:12] with
[54:16] you the prophet of God
[54:22] said according to the voice that spoke
[54:25] at the river in
[54:28] 1933 the voice
[54:30] said this
[54:33] message will will will will will
[54:36] introduce Jesus Christ to the
[54:39] world this
[54:42] message was sent to to introduce Jesus
[54:46] Christ to the
[54:48] world that he will take us to
[54:52] Christ because the same way that John
[54:55] the Baptist
[54:58] was was was send to uh prepare the way
[55:01] for the first
[55:06] coming this message also has to prepare
[55:09] us for the coming of the Lord and I
[55:13] believe that the predestinated
[55:17] seed regardless of what's happening to
[55:19] the left or
[55:22] right will hold on to the
[55:25] message
[55:27] even if everything seems to come to an
[55:29] end she will always hold on to the
[55:33] message and we'll go to uh we'll go for
[55:36] back uh we'll go forward
[55:38] regardless in the message the
[55:42] absolute paragraph
[55:45] 163 the prophet will
[55:53] say oh I remember when he came there in
[55:55] the
[55:58] light when I was standing in the
[56:01] river in
[56:04] 1933 in June he
[56:12] said as John the Baptist was sent to
[56:15] prepare the first coming of Jesus
[56:19] of the first coming the first coming of
[56:25] Christ I am sending you with a message
[56:28] for the
[56:31] world to announce and to prepare the
[56:34] second coming of
[56:36] Christ this message is sent to the
[56:41] world when the message is
[56:46] preached is announcing and preparing the
[56:49] second coming of
[56:51] Christ and he went in the world in the
[56:54] whole
[56:55] world
[56:57] and the fire of Revival were were L for
[57:01] 15
[57:03] years at every
[57:05] Mountain uh Divine
[57:08] Healing all over the
[57:12] Nations and the power and the
[57:15] restoration and
[57:20] now I believe that it's ready to bring
[57:23] us to the the the the the the point of
[57:26] what he was sent
[57:29] for to produce the faith that will take
[57:33] away the
[57:34] church this
[57:36] message is at the at the
[57:40] point to bring uh to bring us to the uh
[57:43] the the the culminating
[57:47] moment to produce the faith that will
[57:50] take the church to Glory that's the
[57:55] truth
[57:56] it's in it's in the
[57:59] message we are really at the end
[58:04] time I believe this is what the the the
[58:07] the elected are standing
[58:12] on not everything that's been added to
[58:15] the message but the true
[58:17] message look at
[58:22] this this Divine message is not preached
[58:25] to the flesh
[58:27] FH because the
[58:29] flesh has nothing to do with the kingdom
[58:32] of
[58:34] God the flesh will not inherit the
[58:36] kingdom of
[58:39] God but it's unfortunate my
[58:42] friends that in
[58:48] churches that everything is centered
[58:51] around the programs to Rejoice the
[58:55] flesh
[58:58] instead of bringing the people of God in
[59:01] the presence of a holy
[59:03] God in there are in many
[59:08] churches a program of entertainment of
[59:11] all
[59:13] kinds a con concert where people dance
[59:17] like in the
[59:18] world our God is
[59:24] sacred and in sanctuary and in a place
[59:27] like we are gathered
[59:30] here we we have to reflect the
[59:34] sacredness of God of the god that we are
[59:37] serving but
[59:41] today there's no sacredness even in the
[59:46] worship we are no longer worshiping in
[59:50] spirit and people like a lot of
[59:53] movement let me tell you this
[59:58] when this message came to
[1:00:00] us I received it I received it in
[1:00:06] 1980 it was based upon the uh the the
[1:00:10] soon coming of
[1:00:14] Christ all the listeners of the message
[1:00:17] in in the
[1:00:20] assemblies they were in the true
[1:00:24] expectation as the word was being
[1:00:30] preached you will see that people were
[1:00:33] connected directly to the mouth that was
[1:00:35] speaking to
[1:00:39] them everyone was pressings to come to
[1:00:42] church early so they can hear
[1:00:47] it it it would that would it was calling
[1:00:50] forth for an atmosphere that was
[1:00:54] sacred
[1:00:56] and everyone had the fear of God that
[1:00:58] was
[1:01:01] visible to the point where uh the the
[1:01:05] the the urgency was
[1:01:09] palpable everyone was waiting for the
[1:01:11] coming of the Lord when he will
[1:01:15] come you you would people will run away
[1:01:19] even from the very smell of sin they
[1:01:22] would run away from
[1:01:23] it but today
[1:01:31] people they stay on the smartphone till
[1:01:34] late at night uh forgetting that they're
[1:01:36] going to go to
[1:01:38] work uh in that
[1:01:42] time the the true love was was animated
[1:01:46] in every
[1:01:52] believer they were they had an
[1:01:54] attentiveness towards one another
[1:01:57] regardless of race or
[1:02:02] color they were calling we will call us
[1:02:04] calling themselves beloved in the true
[1:02:07] sense of the
[1:02:08] word when they will say
[1:02:11] beloved it was coming from the heart and
[1:02:14] when we were greeting one another and
[1:02:16] they were hugging one another there was
[1:02:19] the
[1:02:20] feeling you would feel that they will
[1:02:22] love one
[1:02:24] another even if were meeting for the
[1:02:26] first
[1:02:27] time but the moment you saw someone with
[1:02:30] a a message in
[1:02:33] hand our hearts were filled with love oh
[1:02:36] my precious brother but it's not like
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:40] today things have changed in that
[1:02:44] time people were
[1:02:47] burning they were burning to meet Jesus
[1:02:50] Christ they were burning to be like
[1:02:53] Jesus
[1:02:54] Christ
[1:02:57] and those that were in need among the
[1:03:02] Believers they were they were taken care
[1:03:04] of
[1:03:07] unconditionally not not by uh uh uh you
[1:03:10] must but it was by
[1:03:13] love the the the the the feeling of
[1:03:16] compassion that was
[1:03:20] deep it was it was motivating sons and
[1:03:24] daughters in the in the Gathering
[1:03:26] and
[1:03:27] then the the the the the uh salvations
[1:03:32] of the
[1:03:34] souls our our our true
[1:03:39] being the the salvation of the
[1:03:42] souls and and the
[1:03:45] soul and our soul is our true
[1:03:49] being is the one that that takes the
[1:03:52] most important place in our
[1:03:54] life
[1:03:59] we will try to bring everybody to see
[1:04:01] the message that we had received
[1:04:05] why in that
[1:04:09] time we were receiving the word directly
[1:04:12] from our
[1:04:14] theophany and I
[1:04:16] believe that the time has
[1:04:18] come because our
[1:04:20] God the Alpha and the
[1:04:23] Omega is the alha and
[1:04:30] Omega but there's nothing between the
[1:04:33] two you understand what I'm trying to
[1:04:36] say that time that we were living
[1:04:40] in we are trying we are hoping to
[1:04:43] relieve that life that time because that
[1:04:47] God that God is the beginning and the
[1:04:49] end and follow me my
[1:04:52] friends uh in our
[1:04:54] days
[1:04:57] we can uh realize that in our daily
[1:05:00] lives as
[1:05:03] Christians we we pay little attention to
[1:05:07] our true
[1:05:08] being we're not taking care of
[1:05:14] him but we as even as we know that this
[1:05:18] body that we are living
[1:05:20] in is only worth uh 85
[1:05:24] cents
[1:05:28] this this body that we are living
[1:05:30] in but we are true us as
[1:05:35] invisible we are we are
[1:05:38] communicating but we have never seen one
[1:05:42] another I'm speaking to you you
[1:05:45] understand I'm speaking to
[1:05:49] you you are looking at the envelope
[1:05:52] that's containing me but you are not
[1:05:54] looking at me
[1:05:56] you see my body but you are not seeing
[1:05:59] the real
[1:06:01] me if this body falls here you're going
[1:06:04] to
[1:06:05] say brother Raphael is
[1:06:08] gone let's take his
[1:06:10] body let's take his body but where am
[1:06:16] I take his body and take it to the
[1:06:19] funeral you see my hand it's my hand but
[1:06:24] my me who am I
[1:06:26] I see
[1:06:28] you I see your your bodies but who are
[1:06:32] you a
[1:06:37] spirit we take uh very little care of
[1:06:40] our true
[1:06:41] being that's why my brother my
[1:06:46] sister if this life is real as we are
[1:06:49] together here if it's
[1:06:52] real then life must be serious
[1:06:57] we have to approach it with a lot of
[1:07:01] seriousness and and knowing all
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:06] together that uh uh uh death and the
[1:07:09] tomb is not the purpose of our
[1:07:13] Liv because you are dust and you shall
[1:07:16] return to
[1:07:19] dust that was never a a a word that was
[1:07:22] preached to a true
[1:07:24] being it was not that word was not
[1:07:27] spoken to the soul but it was spoken to
[1:07:29] the flesh that's
[1:07:34] why this is the message of the seventh
[1:07:37] angel to you the elect the prophet
[1:07:43] says you are you are a spiritual you are
[1:07:47] a spiritual union with the Bri with a
[1:07:50] bride with a bridegroom by the
[1:07:53] word by the word
[1:07:58] the word has to take the most important
[1:08:00] place in our lives he
[1:08:04] says you that are dead to your old
[1:08:08] husband you are born
[1:08:13] again there's no way to try to bring him
[1:08:16] up is
[1:08:20] dead if you are a Christian born
[1:08:24] again
[1:08:27] this little germ that's predestinated in
[1:08:32] you it's word upon
[1:08:35] word a word upon
[1:08:41] word until it comes to the Statue of of
[1:08:44] of the of
[1:08:47] Christ it said don't worry about your
[1:08:51] weakness hold on to the
[1:08:54] word
[1:08:55] add word upon
[1:08:57] word word upon
[1:08:59] word because you are a seed you have to
[1:09:04] produce you have to come to
[1:09:07] maturity it's not your Affair your
[1:09:11] Affair it's to eat the
[1:09:14] word it's to drink and
[1:09:16] drink until the fruit comes
[1:09:20] forth that's
[1:09:24] true in a in a manner for him to come
[1:09:27] and take the
[1:09:32] bride I believe it's time for us to
[1:09:34] develop our true
[1:09:40] being it's a time where we have to
[1:09:43] develop our true
[1:09:48] being because there's a true Union
[1:09:51] that's being established between Christ
[1:09:53] and his
[1:09:54] bride
[1:09:56] because the time is at hand will soon
[1:10:00] go and I believe as men of God
[1:10:06] now we have to work a lot more to the
[1:10:09] progress of the uh the the the uh uh
[1:10:12] internal
[1:10:15] being and and to uh uh take away our
[1:10:20] Believers to move them away from all
[1:10:22] kinds of
[1:10:24] distractions
[1:10:27] they they have come into the churches
[1:10:29] for after them to distract
[1:10:31] people there's a lot of
[1:10:34] Destruction that that have come into the
[1:10:37] church to excite the
[1:10:41] flesh the church is a sanctuary of
[1:10:45] God the the the flesh cannot take the
[1:10:48] first
[1:10:50] place Holiness has to appear by the
[1:10:54] word
[1:10:55] the prophet shows us
[1:10:58] something it says the the same
[1:11:02] man the same
[1:11:05] man with the same uh
[1:11:10] brain and the same uh uh faculty that
[1:11:14] he's had for for 6,000
[1:11:17] years the same type of
[1:11:23] man using the same tools that has been
[1:11:26] on Earth for all this
[1:11:36] time this man this man is realizing or
[1:11:40] is building things uh uh that are
[1:11:44] amazing he's making a lot of
[1:11:48] progress he's making a lot of H
[1:11:51] scientific
[1:11:53] exploits that we can that we could could
[1:11:55] have never imagined a 100 years
[1:12:00] ago the the world has got as has known a
[1:12:04] lot of progress a lot of progress since
[1:12:06] a 100 years
[1:12:09] ago I'm not scientific I'm not in the
[1:12:12] Civilized
[1:12:13] world the new
[1:12:16] technology with artificial
[1:12:21] intelligence it's making things uh that
[1:12:24] men can never could have never done a
[1:12:26] 100 years ago I was in
[1:12:32] Turkey they they put something on my my
[1:12:36] body on my hand for 10
[1:12:38] minutes so they can clear the the uh the
[1:12:42] the arteries in my
[1:12:45] heart the uh blood
[1:12:49] vessels in my
[1:12:51] heart we couldn't have we could have
[1:12:53] never imagined that 100 years
[1:12:55] ago I saw two days
[1:13:00] ago the taxis in China without
[1:13:04] drivers a lot of cars you call them it
[1:13:10] comes if they take you you sit down you
[1:13:15] by yourself in the car it takes you to
[1:13:17] your
[1:13:19] destination and it's going to go to
[1:13:21] Europe
[1:13:23] soon it's those are things 100 years ago
[1:13:26] you can never imagine
[1:13:30] them the the the the scientific world is
[1:13:34] progressing at a high
[1:13:40] speed but in the spiritual World there
[1:13:43] are no progress with the Believers and
[1:13:45] the
[1:13:46] people listen to The
[1:13:49] Prophet God keep his word God keeps his
[1:13:53] word paragraph 30
[1:14:02] and then the pental came with the
[1:14:04] restoration of
[1:14:06] gifts and you spoke in
[1:14:09] tongue and you have made it a
[1:14:13] Doctrine what
[1:14:17] happened your light was was put
[1:14:20] out what's the
[1:14:24] problem
[1:14:26] because you didn't hold on to the
[1:14:30] word God does something for
[1:14:33] somebody he feels like he's in
[1:14:36] heaven that he's the
[1:14:38] best H others don't have
[1:14:41] anything and people have to have what he
[1:14:44] has and it stops right there God cannot
[1:14:48] go forward like that when God gives you
[1:14:53] say thank you you wait on the again he's
[1:14:56] going to give again he's going to give
[1:14:59] again that's how you
[1:15:03] progress that when there's a movement of
[1:15:05] God in the
[1:15:07] church all the others are
[1:15:09] false it's us that have the Revelation
[1:15:12] then let everybody look at us you cannot
[1:15:15] go forward like
[1:15:17] that we cannot limit God to just our
[1:15:21] church God is is unlimited
[1:15:26] and his power is
[1:15:28] unlimited if we can remain
[1:15:31] quiet he will do
[1:15:35] more
[1:15:38] says the word of God develop
[1:15:44] itself and we have to develop as the
[1:15:46] word of God is
[1:15:48] developing do you believe that it's a
[1:15:53] prophet as the time time is coming
[1:15:57] forth science is developing is that
[1:16:02] true if the natural
[1:16:08] world and man is the same man who who he
[1:16:12] was 6,000 years ago when God created
[1:16:17] him he has the same intellectual
[1:16:21] capacity he has the same
[1:16:23] intellect
[1:16:27] he the same man he was thousands of
[1:16:30] years
[1:16:31] ago with the same uh five
[1:16:37] senses but look at the progress that
[1:16:40] he's made towards the last 50
[1:16:43] years he doesn't stop at the phone at
[1:16:46] the
[1:16:47] telephone with with telephone that we
[1:16:50] had was our he continued to develop he
[1:16:53] continued to develop
[1:16:58] he he doesn't stop like us the
[1:17:00] religious when we have gift we stop at
[1:17:03] the gift when we have prophecy we have
[1:17:07] the
[1:17:08] prophecy everybody has to talk about it
[1:17:11] that's not it don't limit
[1:17:14] God those are gifts but it's not
[1:17:19] God but if we can have the
[1:17:22] giver he's going to give us more
[1:17:29] paragraph
[1:17:33] 31 look at this Fallen Son of God had
[1:17:37] done he invented uh uh
[1:17:42] automobiles he invented
[1:17:46] radio the the
[1:17:49] lights the atomic
[1:17:51] bombs and and and and and and react rea
[1:17:55] doors look at at what
[1:18:00] speed the the the the pages of science
[1:18:04] are moving
[1:18:08] rapidly oh if the Sons and Daughters of
[1:18:10] God will only give themselves to
[1:18:13] God if they will only wait upon
[1:18:17] God he will take care of developing
[1:18:22] Us in revealing himself more to
[1:18:31] us but we are holding on to a a an old
[1:18:36] dogma of the
[1:18:38] church and to stay
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:43] there when God wants to develop the
[1:18:47] word we are living in the end in the end
[1:18:52] days we are living in a Time where the
[1:18:55] Magnificent Church of
[1:18:57] God has to stand
[1:19:00] for
[1:19:02] shining as the Lady of the Valley but
[1:19:07] us we have stayed
[1:19:12] behind oh I belong to the
[1:19:14] Presbyterian I'm a
[1:19:17] Methodist
[1:19:19] P this I'm that
[1:19:22] says what shame
[1:19:27] name we have to be
[1:19:34] developed the spirit of God is is
[1:19:37] pouring
[1:19:40] itself we have to be we have to have
[1:19:43] been developed to where the spirit of
[1:19:45] God is
[1:19:48] Flowing not just an anointing for us to
[1:19:51] jump and
[1:19:52] Shout just not just
[1:19:56] baptism but from baptism to
[1:20:00] baptism and we become stable and mature
[1:20:04] and with
[1:20:05] weight not just a
[1:20:08] revelation oh the just shall live by
[1:20:10] faith all
[1:20:12] sanctification all the the the gift of
[1:20:15] holy
[1:20:16] ghost from Revelation to
[1:20:19] Revelation from power to power from
[1:20:22] glory to
[1:20:23] glory
[1:20:25] that we may be at the end of the
[1:20:28] road ready for the
[1:20:33] Rapture but we are holding ourselves
[1:20:35] back to the this old story and
[1:20:38] saying oh we are always going
[1:20:41] backwards let's go
[1:20:44] forth this Hebrews were
[1:20:47] saying and
[1:20:49] listen we are well
[1:20:53] fed even even if we are working
[1:20:57] hard we have what we
[1:21:05] have garlic we have
[1:21:11] garlic let's be happy with
[1:21:15] it we have the spirit we speak in tongue
[1:21:20] what else do you
[1:21:21] want we want the giver
[1:21:25] we want the
[1:21:27] giver is the perfect
[1:21:31] love it's the relations that are
[1:21:35] flowing my brother my
[1:21:38] sister
[1:21:41] says Moses had a
[1:21:45] revelation and today had a
[1:21:50] revelation Moses was in the presence of
[1:21:53] God
[1:21:55] he had something
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:04] else he came to show them he returned to
[1:22:08] show them that the same God who existed
[1:22:11] thousand years ago was the same was
[1:22:13] always the
[1:22:16] same that he he he brought forth signs
[1:22:20] and wonders before
[1:22:22] them to show them that he was always the
[1:22:25] same and he
[1:22:27] said that the message and the messenger
[1:22:32] they are
[1:22:34] one we cannot believe William
[1:22:38] Bram and not consider everything that
[1:22:41] God did with
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:44] him that's what holds Us in the the the
[1:22:49] unshakable
[1:22:51] faith today anyone can come within
[1:22:55] interpretation and they want they want
[1:22:56] people to follow
[1:22:58] them what does he have as an
[1:23:01] Evidence what does he have as a
[1:23:04] Vindication that God is
[1:23:06] work now even if he has signs and
[1:23:08] wonders following
[1:23:10] him that's not the evidence the
[1:23:14] evidence is the holding forth to the
[1:23:17] prophet of the
[1:23:20] hour oh blessed be the name of the
[1:23:23] Lord it's the same yesterday today and
[1:23:27] forever dispensation will change time
[1:23:30] will change people will change but God
[1:23:35] remains that's
[1:23:37] why stay with this
[1:23:40] message regardless of what
[1:23:43] happens that you may understand or not
[1:23:46] understand stay with the
[1:23:48] message he has to be the same every
[1:23:53] time his word word is the the Eternal
[1:23:59] truth he cannot move to the left to the
[1:24:02] right of
[1:24:03] it he has to remain the
[1:24:08] same my my my dear friend brothers and
[1:24:14] sisters we we we we we realize in this
[1:24:18] and time and
[1:24:21] days that
[1:24:23] denominations

[1:24:27] churches even uh uh uh message
[1:24:32] churches they have adopted a social
[1:24:38] gospel that is putting an emphasis on
[1:24:41] the
[1:24:43] flesh where the value is only 85 cents
[1:24:52] 84 when you have the body in in in in
[1:24:55] its powder form it's not even a
[1:24:58] spoonful and what does the prophet

[1:27:01] really has need
[1:27:05] of we accumulate a lot of material
[1:27:10] things a lot of money that we are taking
[1:27:13] care of uh with uh
[1:27:16] uh
[1:27:21] selfishly we are uh taking care of self
[1:27:24] selfishly when around
[1:27:27] us our brothers and
[1:27:30] sisters they see our old
[1:27:35] parents they they are they have to work

[1:28:10] children with that money what are you
[1:28:12] doing with
[1:28:14] it if you cannot help your own
[1:28:17] parents how are you going to help a
[1:28:19] brother or a
[1:28:20] sister that is not even from your origin
[1:28:25] we are
[1:28:28] Christians see the Christians of the
[1:28:30] other
[1:28:31] time that it doesn't
[1:28:34] change if Jesus is the
[1:28:37] same Christianity is the
[1:28:41] same if in the time that we're taking
[1:28:43] care of one another if Jesus is the same
[1:28:47] we'll do the same
[1:28:49] thing your your own
[1:28:51] parents you're not taking care of them
