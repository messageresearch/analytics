limited by Kovan 19 oh nothing can limit his grace nothing can limit his presence I say why don't we all just agree together and invite him into our midst man maybe I would ask the husbands and and the wives just to take charge of your home right now take control of the atmosphere apply the token believe that God is going to do something supernatural in my home in my life in my heart Lord I'm not playing Church tonight if there's ever a time that we're not playing churches now all we should be so sincere and sold out to him I'm not taking these times lightly but know that God is accomplishing something in each one of our lives amen praise the Lord let's just stand and go before him in prayer precious Heavenly Father how we love you Lord how we thank you we thank you that you're mindful of our needs Lord Lord and before we ever had the need you had already provided for us that's how great you are Lord and we just want to tell you that we love you now and as we would come to this portion of the service Lord we we need more grace than we've ever needed before in these very closing times of history Lord we've preached it we've said it we believe it Lord we believe it could be any day now that the change of our bodies would just break Lord may we not be slothful or may I not be the one that's holding the show up Lord may we just be so died out and surrender to your word nor that it would just manifest in its fullness and power that you've spoken it to do we love you Lord we commit ourselves to you we just ask that by your divine grace immersing your Holy Spirit you come break the bread of life as only you can we ask in your name now the Lord Jesus Christ the man praise Lord amen if you could turning their Bibles would be reading out of Matthew chapter 12 verse 32 Matthew chapter 12 verse 32 amen I'm thankful the word says where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be a man and and I know it can certainly be an extra challenge to focus maybe to stay in tune when you're you're in the comforts of your home and it seems like there's not as much restriction you're able to move about and and be able to get a coke if you're thirsty and you're able to lounge but I would want to have a seriousness and a sobriety as we approach the Word of God and to have the same reverence and respect for the time that we have gathered because this is a time that our pastor has continued to provide for his flock under the leadership of the Holy Ghost and so we don't want to take it lightly we want to take full advantage because it can it's it's in times like this that God is perfecting the bride amen we're reading out of Matthew chapter 12 verse 32 through 37 says and whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man they shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come either make the tree good and His fruit good or else make or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit old generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account therefore thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned Lord we just ask a special blessing upon the reading of your word and your name Jesus Christ we pray amen those of you that are gathered can be seated I want to read a quote out of the unveiling of God so the Bible is no private interpretation it must be word by word the way it's written we must believe that and not only believe it but live it and so as as I I move towards this thought of saying the right thing and and speaking the right words it's not just in the saying of it but it's in the saying of it that we might live it and bring it into manifestation so it's not only believe it but live it if we don't live it then we don't believe it we just say we do like basing back to what I said those disciples could not explain it but they believed it anyhow and they made their confession and lived it when all the rest of them walked away from it they stayed with it they believed it well if we were ever living in a time where so many are walking away but yet there's a there's a little bride maybe she's going to be hunted and persecuted but there's a little bride or are you in that number tonight that's going to stay with it nor there's many things I don't understand Lord but I believe it I confess it I might not understand it I might understand how all of its going to be manifested Lord but I believe it that's the way we do that's the way you got to do it no matter what anybody else does we believe it and then we act upon it if you don't do it then you don't believe it notice now as he came he had to come as son of man because the holy scripture said that he would God would raise up a prophet to them so he so he could not come calling himself the son of God because it wasn't that dispensation he was the son of man prophesy to fulfill and revealing to them all the things that had been done and tight what he was then he was on earth as son of man look at the Sarah Phoenician woman run to him and she said thou son of David have mercy on me he never has much raised his head she had no claims on him as son of David she was a Gentile no more than my daughter has claims on me as husband and my wife as daughter yet she is my daughter and my wife and she's my daughter in the gospel but earthly she has no right to call me father seat now notice this Gentile woman had no claims on him as son of David but blind Bartimaeus did see he was a Jew now he came as son of men you know you have you have to know these words and these things the Prophet is pointing out you have to know these were and these things now look what he says here he says look at Hattie right that time when the third pool you remember of all the everything the woman said the right thing you've got to say that right word the right thing to God and maybe as what would maybe appear to be maybe an odd subject or title I want to title this message that's nothing but the truth because when that portion there that brother branham is referring to when brother Branham is giving testimony of the third pool that came into action and he was there testifying and say oh no that not that he said you have need of squirrels and I spoke in there come that squirrel oh right into existence as I spoke it something in hat ear I just welled up and said that's nothing but the truth what was she giving you witness to what shoe she was confessing to all something inside of her I say that that was a predestinated seed that was identifying with the word being made flesh and all he might have been a uncontrollable utterance she might not even been know what she was saying but when she heard that go for season oh that's nothing but the truth and oh my watch what happened it brought Jesus on the scene and as we just approach this subject that's nothing but the truth I pray that that would be our hearts cry towards the word I pray that that would be our expectation that we would just we as the word would go forth and as we feed upon the message that something is welling up inside of you word upon word that's saying that's nothing but the truth Oh church if we could come to the services and and this time that we're living in if you can come on and strain and something in your heart would be longing and desiring and looking for something to come forth to say oh I'm looking for that word to strike my soul that I can say oh that's nothing but the truth or I believe we want to have a type of longing type of cry not not not looking to traditions of man not looking to things to appease the flesh I'm not saying that's nothing but the truth to man's ideas and and all the way that we would like they know but something deeper than that something that's a revelation that struck Peter on that day when he said who do you say I the Son of Man in oh my he he they asked the question he asked the question first year ago some say this some say that but he narrowed it down who do you say that I am and I believe that's what the word is doing us ain't going for it it's identifying that gene part of God that's inside of you that says oh don't alert the Christ that the Son of the Living God thou art the truth oh and you can't deny because you're part of it it's who you are it's your identification I was going to try to calm down try to slow down calm down oh but this is such an exciting word that we have as we just look into this and continue on this where this word is bringing forth the attribute of the word in your life as you Amen that word look when when the word goes forth I think that's something that's so hard for us as we're we're in these little Tabernacles of flesh here and we see all the faults and failures when the word comes and speaks and says you never did it in the first place that says you're without spot or wrinkle I wonder if we if we reason within ourselves but no I appeal to that seat on the inside that predestinate apart that'll say yeah I'm not looking at the symptoms I'm not looking at the flesh but I'm looking to what the Lord says and if the word says it I say that's nothing but the truth Oh what are you saying you're perfect I'm saying what the Lord said that's that's what I'm told to do I'm gonna say what the Lord said if he said I'm his predestinate is he I'm as predestinated see that's nothing about the truth if he said I was in the mind of God before the world was ever formed that's nothing but the truth and he says my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was ever for something aside he says that's nothing but the truth oh you don't have to take it up with me I'm not the one that said it if you got a problem when you take it up with my father you take it up with the creator of heavens of the earth I'm not the one that said it oh but that's what those religious spirits - oh they got a problem when the word is manifest they got a problem when the word takes on flesh why because it's threatening Satan's Kingdom oh my the only thing that has the power to overcome Satan's Kingdom is the Word made flesh and that's exactly what the Son of Man did when he came in that God was in tabernacle - spider-man oh he said I have power to lay my life down and I have power to take it up again Oh even in his truthful fiction when they were running that spirit to the side oh they might have taken some joy and satisfaction I don't know how to crucify our Savior but they were only fulfilling Scripture hallelujah even in his death he was talking and he rose on that third day victorious hallelujah oh praise the Lord he's the mighty Conqueror that's nothing but the truth and that's what the message is doing it's bringing forth a perfect word in your life bringing a manifestation the fruits of the spirit as we surrender and as we yield and as we say yay an amen - every word of God Matthew 15 22 and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried on him saying have mercy on me O Lord now son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil and when you look at some of the accounts of brother Branham referring to this he says that she was vexed with a devil he says she had epilepsy who was that talking he says she had epilepsy and if you've ever I've seen somebody that's a battled battled that condition I remember my first time ever coming and into contact with somebody that was battling that I was at a pizza shopping and I was ordering some pizza and and I'd placed my order and the gentleman was looking at me and all of a sudden it just seemed something come over him and they all said he just became real distant and and at first I didn't know what I was doing but all in my heart right there just serving the Lord I watched something come over him and I was a believer and I saw them go to the ground and and and I realized what was taking place and I said I just felt I felt that the enemy had come in you know right into my presence he'd he just he just got taken advantage of somebody in my heart I felt I felt I felt for him I felt God or that that spirit just come in and and all of a sudden in an instant everything was going fine but in an instant all of a sudden this seizure broke out on him and I said oh my that's nothing but a spirit I just saw it for what it was and here the Prophet is saying that this this woman that came she had a daughter that was vexed with the devil he said it was epilepsy and oh my now my heart does I look at the store you can imagine this woman was desperate we don't know how long she had traveled we don't know how far she had gone we don't know how many episodes and how many times she saw her daughter fall and hit her head over and over and over she said I must get to that man called Jesus well something was driving her I must get to the man and I can imagine she got closer and she got closer and very wise oh you're something in this for you just hang on now I'm here closer and closer and there he was and she thinks oh my I finally made it to him and he says here's the one that can fix everything just one word he can fix everything and oh maybe the whole journey she's been on this whole time and now she's finally come to what oh this is the answer this is the one I've heard of the miracles if the anyone could do it I know he can do it o Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word well how many times have you made your petition known and you feel like he doesn't answer you a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us oh my now the disciples don't want none to do with it oh yeah you know sitting this troublemaker away she's she's one of those fanatics she's one of this I'll just get her away but then he answered and said I am NOT sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel oh look at this persistence look at this desperation then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me oh my now she's coming now she's entering into that burden and she's there say O God O Lord have helped me and now in this mother's heart cry for her daughter but he answered and said it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs Oh how many of us would have given up right there you know what if that's the way you're gonna treat me okay you don't know everything that I've been through you don't know how long I've been praying and how many years I've been looking for this moment and that's how you're gonna treat me and you say here you have the love of God you're the son of God oh how many how many people would walk away right there you've been believing something for hours and days and weeks and months and months turn into years and years turn them into more years and all that Devils there to buffman at you and say well well isn't really a healer I want you to stay right there and something in your heart when you hear him say by his stripes I'm healed you say that's nothing but the truth no matter what the circumstance looks like no matter how bad the symptoms look no matter how many times you've prayed no matter how many times you've laid yourself at the altar you stay right there with the word oh but he said it's answer said it's not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs see she wasn't a Jew the revival wasn't to our people she wasn't a Jew and she gets to him and he says it's not me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs called her a dog this story is not going the right direction for this mothers whose daughter was vexed with an epileptic devil and now she's gotten to the feet of Jesus and now she's worshiping me and she's saying those words Oh for any human to hearing other humans say help me or something is just from a human heart would rise up say Lola what's wrong hope you're in your backyard in the grocery store hear that crying help me only you respond to it it's just human nature and hearing how she is before seasons help me oh my god is it is molding and bringing for us a character during this trial oh he knew what was inside of this woman I believe she was a predestinated Oh something inside of her identified in her heart is that I know that that's the word the prophet of God see how real faith so he calls her a dog and the next verse is and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from theirs master table I feel like that sometimes maybe when when the lot falls me to stand behind the sacred desk I say you know I don't God if just a few crumbs could come from the table if you can just to get a few crumbs tonight from the master's table I believe it's more than can sustain every need if you my faith in that word if you just look for a scripture just look for a quote oh I might not be the best orator I might be the pastor's son and I might just be our brother David McGary son and I might have the littlest of all that is all we do i do just read a scripture and read a quote and it can strike that seat on the inside and you'll see that's nothing but the truth I believe it'll bring Jesus Christ on the scene in your time of need oh if you could just have this same expectation right now towards the Lord truth Lord you have two dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table the Prophet says see how the real faith will witness the word to be truth color or a dog well something insider said if it's him speaking if he's the one that said it that it's true Lord if that's what you're saying to me tonight it's true Lord if this is the house of correction and you're coming by my way to correct me if I gotta clean up my act if I've been having the wrong expectation towards the services if I've been wondering what in the world is our church doing why are we still streaming why do that many people go or to the house of God and then set up all the streaming when maybe we shouldn't be gathering all oh let's get out of that type of thinking now start looking away to Jesus Christ let's look to the author and the finisher of our faith see how the real faith will witness the word to be true truth Lord what the dogs are willing to eat the scraps under the master's table he said for this saying this is the profit taking description I said for this sale your child is healed she said the right thing in that crucial moment when it looked to me all was lost she said the right thing proverbs says death and life are in the power of the tongue and I want to say you have to say the right thing - the right thing and you have to say the right thing - the wrong thing because that's exactly what happened to Eve he didn't say the right thing in the hour of temptation we were studying here the church age book and the Prophet says that Eve Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word now why don't we just start taking a little inventory in our lives we start thinking about the personal temptations that we are faced with on a daily basis maybe we're not you know not being faced with worldly things but we're faced being faced with how we spend our time how we treat our wife and our children we're facing the fine-tuning of being the Word made flesh to our family the Word made flesh to our neighbor the Word made flesh to our boss to turn our cheek we are the Word made flesh in this hour in this bride coming of God where where else is this world going to receive the word where else is this word or gonna see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever except in you personal temptation the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life my how many of us maybe don't realize that your personal temptation is education maybe you're seeking a career over the mind of God that's something we need to be sensitive to maybe money a career women popularity your job look all of these things can be personal temptation oh the snare that is out there here in Satan's Eden you know people gain fame and popularity on the internet maybe you realize your Instagram account I wonder how many people are following you and I wonder why because if you're following Jesus Christ I wonder if they would want to follow you anymore I wonder what you're testifying about I wonder if you're what's on your pictures and what's in your profile and what's your status they call it Oh does your status say that I've accepted the message of Malachi 4 does your status say that I believe that revelations 10 seven has been fulfilled is your status searching for lost souls what what do you want your personal temptation I don't know I've never had an Instagram account I've never had a snapchat but I've seen the things that it does I've seen the temptation it is to our youth I've seen what online in the internet and how this personal kids I tell you what it's more personal than it's ever been Saints you walk around we're not eating others devices and we pack that little black box around in our pocket all day long and I'd add a a swipe of a finger you can have all those Satan's even at your disposal as time we start getting a Bible in our hand time we start getting a message book in our hand god help us to be good examples to our family and to our sister to our kids we we show what why would we we spend their time doing we show value to it and we wonder why our kids want to play with their cell phones it's cuz you're on it all the time they see what mommy and daddy are giving priority to so they think it's important let's see we have personal temptations as the word is fine-tuning us here this last day that we got to give ourselves over to the Lord that the word is correcting you right now oh we're not hired ability to say brother Matthew that's nothing but the truth you're speaking to me right now and I believe if this is the closing times in history why am i playing around why am i friending people on Instagram why am i following people when you go onto their account and you can see endless results of lonely people and war only pictures and you're endorsing it and saying you identify with the revealed Christ of the hour and yet you're identifying with the world oh shake yourself now now let's get me on the ways of men let's let's come up higher oh we've been set up on a rock the strong rock the revelation in the hour that we're living in we got to fly above although all the ways of the world Church I believe that's why we're not Oh crying out for a body change because maybe we're just a little too complacent we're just a little too comfortable here and ladies here Mari we have all the nice things I mean why why do we need to go anywhere but you know that's the good that comes out of being a little sick that's the good that comes out of having a little trial each other it's just start to get a little hunger in your heart say Lord I don't want to be here anymore and I would pray that that the brothers or the prophet talks about a lien it's sad that it's human nature but we just become so slothful we get so swab when I say old God let us come into desperation tonight that is cut away from the things of the world let's get down to business with God whatever the personal temptation is in my life Lord I'm down at the altar now your Holy Spirit and fire come down and purge my life Lord fill every fiber of my being Lord maybe you and you alone that surging through these hands and through this mind and through these lips Lord and through my feet may it be you Lord and Taplin acting yourself and flesh again oh it's not not what he spoke of in the last days it's not not what he said oh the Prophet was the first one to maturity but there's a whole field of wheat seed right behind him coming into that full maturity of the word Oh God let that be me hard man I give over to the things of the world Lord may I lay Oliver down tonight Lord may I cut ties with with those personal temptations that keep buffeting at my flesh well we're moving on Saints let's keep going that's nothing but the truth Oh in any moment we're going to take our last step on this side Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also is the only way that you can know if you're overcoming because the word can't fail that's nothing but the truth man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and I want to say you have to receive the word you have to believe the word confession is made unto salvation we know that life comes by the word the word is light when it's manifesting like it was in the beginning he said let there be light and that's the what the word is doing in this hour it's quickening the seed that is inside of you it's quickening the seed to life by the Holy Ghost all right that's what the word is doing it is bringing you into a position as you say yeah amen to that word now that spirit comes upon that seed and upon that life and you are being quickened oh the Holy Ghost what is it quickening power we know that when it's the Holy Spirit inside of you it says amen to every word of God and that's maybe just another way of saying what's on our heart tonight is to say amen to every word of God forsaking our ideas forsaking our comforts getting into a desperation for a body change hunger in and thirsting for more of God searching for lost souls doing our part not just a head knowledge Church not just a head knowledge let's read out of John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life they shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life out of the rising of the Sun the prophet says the right word there in the Greek in the original it says he that understandeth my words now to prove that that's right I go down here and here's a drunk coming along the street with some other man's wife on his arms and cussing and taking God's name in vain and everything else like that say did you hear what the preacher said did you yeah I heard it that don't mean he got si ternal life see he that understandeth my word and the Prophet says he that understand is my word he that is an eagle Oh hallelujah not a chicken not a make believer not an unbeliever not a Pharisee not some religious a person with with well that's filled their head with a bunch of knowledge I might not have know at all not some person who thinks he's a walking Bible and just because he's memorized every scripture and every time you try to witness truth to him and tell your testimony all they have an answer for you they always have something to say oh but this is to the eagle it's to the predestinated jesus said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow just reading out of John 10 24 he says then came the Jews round about him and said unto Him how long does they'll make us to doubt if there'll be the Christ tell us plainly I am NOT something they're blaming Jesus for their unbelief how long will you make us doubt tell us plainly and I believe they were just looking for more evidence they just wanted him to indict himself they're like hey man and some of them would argue amongst themselves man this guy has a devil and like well man I don't know you opened the blind man's eyes I mean can a devil do that and so now they're learning around themselves and so the Jews you're coming tomorrow let's settle this once and for all I mean it is this guy who he says he is or or maybe you at least say something that'll self incriminate him and verse 24 he says then came the Jews round about him and said and how long does now make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly and jesus answered and said I told you and ye believed not the works that I do and my father's name they bear witness of me now I could never help whenever I read scripture to think of the testimony of what God has done in our generation every time I read it because according to scripture God has come once again an entire natural to himself inside of a vessel and prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever and the same works that he did back there he did here and something in my heart says that's nothing but the truth but all of the religious Pharisees and all of the religious systems and everything oh they they can't see it why but ye believe not because ye are not my sheep oh that just makes them even more bad in it funny how people can walk away from the message and they say that it's wrong but they can't live without attacking it oh it's just something that's almost just eats Adam in their conscience because something in a nose there's something about that that must be right oh my goodness and they walk away from it and they attack it and they take an antichrist spirit towards the word because ye are not my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand that might sound simple but that's talking about you he has given you eternal life you shall never perish no one could ever pluck you out of his hand my father which gave them to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I a my father are one then the Jews took up stones took up stones again this wasn't the first run-in well see they weren't his sheep my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will follow now what about today what does the scripture say as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the revealing of the son of man now we're bringing it down home what are you going to say about the word made flesh and our day my sheep know my voice in a stranger they won't follow Oh in the days of the revealing of the son of man out of the rise of the Son of Man he says who is this son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us the Son of Man was the word made flesh and dwelt among us the word had been spoken and now the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and now we're living in the hour of the revealing of the son of man and the Prophet says that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right among and is giving us life I say Amen I believe it oh you might be in a place where it's not all adding up but if you can just find somewhere in your heart by faith to say the old brother Matthew I can't explain everything about the revealing of the son of eret I don't understand everything about the seven seals but I do know something something in my heart knows that that was a man of God something in my heart believe he's a prophet according to what the scripture says and I'm putting my faith in that it's the truth and I'm saying that's nothing but the truth you keep believing you keep laying on that right there you keep praying about it you keep reading your Bible you keep listening to the message you allow that spirit to come quick in the word to you for this great scripture of revelations 10:1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and we need cried seven thunders uttered their voices when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and just for times sake skipping to verse seven he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets I just want to take a little time here this is rather random preaching the seventh seal he says now I want to make this real clear every time every time that these seals has come to this come to the place everything that I ever believed on them and have read of other people has been contrary to what come to me in the room and when I asked you what was coming to him in the room what was this angel of revelations 10 1 through 7 who was this mighty angel coming down with an open book in his hand that a prophet which stand there preaching the seventh seal and saying I want to let you know I want to make this very clear that what I have received now is completely different from everything that I've ever thought the whole Bible has become a brand-new book to me what is taking place here what a STIs sin that all the Lord has descended with an open book in hand he says you notice now for the endtime message this seal after all he's revealed all six but it don't say nothing about the seventh and the endtime seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible before knowing that remember revelations 10 1 through 7 at the end of the seventh angels message all the mysteries of God would be known we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal and he goes on to say we find that Christ the Lamb took the book in his hand and he opened that seventh seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about this seventh under mystery you see it's connected together you understand that's the third pole that had been prophesied all of those years before or what did he say it's not a public show I'll meet you in there on the third pole isn't to the world it's a personal revealing of Jesus Christ to his bride and invisible union of the heavenly bride with the bridegroom with an earthly bride Oh Oh the love can't see what's going on they can't see what's taking place but there's a union between the Bride of Christ that has been revealed to her she has received Terme she has received her hot ship in the sour yes baby to work through this just John 14:12 says verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father I can't I can't ever read this scripture the same anymore this wasn't the emphasis I was wanting to go on but the Prophet when he starts to preach I in Shalom there in 1964 he says I've interpreted this scripture more work a greater as more works because how could you do greater works than then turning water into wine but he says I I've interpreted many times like that he said oh but here in the last days it is greater works because oh if you look back when Jesus was on earth he took the wine and he took the water and he turned it into wine he took he took the bread and he multiplied it but he said in the last day greater once will you do where there was nothing he created squirrels proving that it was the same God back there they said let there be light have come in this hour and this generation and who was there speaking creation once again Oh revealing of the son of man who is this son of man it's none other than God veiled in flesh standing before you once again all performing the Masonic sign over and over and over and over the Word of God is sharper into any 200 sword oh whatever you're thinking whatever they need of it goes right down to the height of matter and will give you whatever you have neither oh and he's the same yesterday today and forever and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it now I'm praying as a burden upon the man of God in my heart that something is rising up in the believer tonight I don't care that here your your you're miles apart oh maybe you're you're out in Dallas maybe they're out in Fort Worth maybe you're out in Louisville maybe Ladin cranberry maybe you're in North personal Hills in Bedford but I want you to know that Jesus Christ knew that you would be listening to the word tonight and it's not a dead letter but if something inside of you can start rising up you know what would see maybe the most peculiar way I pray that the presence of the Lord would right now just sweep into your living room it was just coming here a household and all of a sudden something in your heart would say I've been hearing this all of these years over and over and over if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it all if that predestinated scene could just say that's nothing but the truth I want you to know that the Holy Spirit is there to quicken to you whatever you have needles if he love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him not but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while oh my yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because I live he live also I believe it's in Christ the mystery says because I live you live also made us Verizon a Sonny he says speaking to his wife because I live Elam also speaking to you at that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye and me and I am you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and he will manage to myself to him and then Judas saith unto Him not Iscariot Lord how is it that that will manifest myself unto us and out into the world I believe that is the same question that many people ask in the hour that were standing in when we were beholding the coming of the Lord what did the prophets show us in the rapture message in 1st Thessalonians 4:16 what was it what is the show he said the Lord descends with a shout he said this shout is the message the bread of life it is the coming of the Lord coming for the bride how is the Lord gonna come in the whole world I know because it's not it's not revelations 1:7 that every eye will be Holden but it's revelations 15 16 as a thief in the night he has come he has failed himself he is coming the midnight hour and he snuck in for his little bride to catch her away all at the rising of the song hallelujah do you realize what you're a part of in this hour oh praise the Lord how is it that that would manifest myself my noise I'm out into the world or it makes me think of the disciples they're walking on the road to Emmaus hear Jesus Christ have done everything that he said he would do and not only that in howdy he did everything that he said he would do he's revealed the seals he manifested Malachi 4 he's revealed revelations 10 wonders heaven only we're living in the time of the revealing of the Son of man he has these tender with a shout oh the bread of life is gathered together abroad this is where we're at but yet where are we at church Oh slow of heart to believe all of the scripture and now on this road in Emmaus here the Lord comes it comes up here in Luke 24 25 and he says then said unto him why because here they are they're discouraged they're no trodden because the prophets in Christ the mystery of God revealed he says because they thought all of the suffering and everything that Jesus Christ went through was in vain and little church little bride if you think everything that we're going through right now is in vain Oh fools is full of heart I want you to know everything is working out for your good a far great way of Gloria waited for you because just in a moment in a twinkling of an eye or you just keep holding on you just keep pressing you just keep believing and that word is going to manifest in your time of need Oh fools a slow heart to believe all the prophets have spoken I'm not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter no glory I'm beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded them to them and all the scriptures and the things concerning himself I want you to say that's exactly what he'd done in this day he came himself again and a pillar of fire he came and bailed himself in the prophet named William Branham and he didn't start at the proof and Isaiah he started before the world was ever formed he went back in the deep part to mind in the mind of God and said that's right where you are all along I'm not in fact this whole program the reason why creation ever came into existence because God I have thought about you and he wanted to spend eternity with you and this whole program is about a bride that's living in the radio CH and you are she oh oh oh oh oh I want to believe all that the Scriptures have prophesied you are that bride you are the Lord this is the hour that we're living in in Christ the mystery of God revealed jesus said I that day that's this day out the day when this revelation is made no you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you and me when the revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that I am in the father and the father are one I am in the father and the father in me then when the revelation comes forth then it's I you and you and me what revelation has come forth in this day Oh hallelujah what revelation is is it it's the revealing of Christ o saints rising to the Sun he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals I want to settle a question once three for you once and for all you try to wonder what they open the book a man you try to wonder and put it all together just know this that that mighty angel that descended with an open book and hang and loose the seven seals and said according to revelations 10 seven at the sounding of the seventh angel message when he begins to town what was he sounding that message that came to him in the room something that he knew nothing about it was a complete mystery because the seventh seal was a complete mute it was complete silent nobody knew anything about us coming it was a complete mystery but all of a sudden now at the rising of the Sun who took that picture up there and declared it was the supreme judge they took the picture testified that he first declares it in the heavens first o mine that he came there in March and Jeffersonville and revealed the seals he is the one who opened those seals he has those seals for the whole Word of God as Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he's Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end what identification cricketing power did that to us quickening power let us see his coming quickening power smashed us from death to life that's what the revealing of Christ is to this day it has smashed your little bride that didn't know who she was lost oh you had spiritual amnesia you didn't buy past your theophany you were just wandering around until you saw something familiar and then your eyes came up and you realize that's Christ my mate I came from God I'm going back to God what is it it's the word again being waved over the people that the dead traditions a man is dead the Son of God is alive again with a baptism of the Holy Spirit ride among us and giving us life oh the son of man is Christ Church he's the one that you're feeding on my all of the saints streaming we have an extra twenty thirty minutes because you don't have to drive home that all right we just focus here a little bit my we have just a handful here and there they're pulling so wonderfully on the Word of God as I just want to get to my sermon now oh my if we could just press through this for another ten minutes maybe he said the son of the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on look the headship has come to the body because I live yearly of also speaking to his wife and now in Revelations 10 eight and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me and said go and take the little book which is opened in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth not to take too much time but it was in revelations chapter five when John was standing there and nobody was worthy to take the book why because something now has taken place oh the lamb has come for redemption claims he's taken the book and he's opened the book and we have found out that our name is on that book and now that he's descended in the seals have been opened what is he saying now he's saying to you take the book and a voice that I heard spake to me get us it go and take the little bit which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto Him now I remember what we're talking about the things we say saying the right thing saying that's nothing but the church truth I'm wanting to come into something now said I went under angel now what is he doing he said unto him give me the little book well that sounds a little who do you think you are he's only doing what the word told him to do the angel told him grow and take the book now according to that word he calms and says give me the little book and said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I heated up my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings thou must prophesy again o our brother Matthew what should I say or why should I do what am I supposed to prophesy about oh let me just let you in on a little secret a spoken word is the original seed 1962 oh here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord Oh church you have received as the second Lord in this hour you have received Christ the opening of the Lord Paul says in Romans 10 verse 8 he says but what saith it maybe we'll read a quote real quick I hope we're feeling all right praise the Lord I hope we're hanging in there I'm on the stream I believe everybody's pooling real hard I know I know Kozma and Jackson said they were going to be be the third pole pooler's or something like that and I thought praise the Lord maybe I'll just title my sermon that but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children well he's identifying things that seem really necessary I say we pray God give me a revelation help me Lord Jesus help me to understand am I not manifesting Christ to my wife and to my husband am I am I not responding correctly am I not creating the right atmosphere you let your job you let your wife you look he's not speaking he's not speaking to chickens here he's not speaking to denominational Pharisees this is a love letter to you this is Jesus Christ speaking directly to your heart and I wonder if we're gonna say Lord that's nothing but the truth but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife now I want you to say this is a husband speaking to his wife wanting fellowship warning Communion wanting to manifest all the attributes in your life but we let so many things get it out of us we let so many things get it out of you your job your your life your wife you let your husband your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down your heart your thirsting you're hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you see the revelation the last day is here oh there ought to be a hunger in our heart to start saying Lord give me the book reveal it to me Lord this hidden mystery these seals this Christ is the mystery of God revealed I reveal it to me Lord I'm hungry I'm thirsty and I realize look too many things get out of me and Romans 10:8 he says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead that shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation I'll just ask the musicians to come but I just really want to focus this really right here is the whole inspiration let's applaud my heart right here even on the internet stream and those that are with us we just want to focus through this last moment here for what the mouth confession is made unto salvation I want to say that it was it was howdy rights response as as brother Branham was was speaking about the second time the third pull had come into manifestation was speaking those squirrels first it was little fishy I give you back your life we saw that first manifestation wanted to do it resurrected an animal that was the first manifestation then the second one was he was out there and oh that the Spirit came to him and he didn't know what to ask for he said he spoke and said you have need of squirrels and so he spoke squirrels into existence and now here he is he's testifying of it and here howdy right is listening to the Prophet give testimony of the second manifestation of the third pool and the Prophet talks about now it was her response to the word it was how do you each response to the word made flesh Luke that was the spoken word that created a squirrel and made flesh where there was no squirrel and now here this little old lady who nothing make $200 a year something like that she's sitting there as the Prophet is giving testimony and now her response to the word made manifest brings the third pull in the manifestation for the third time and Apophis said for the first time upon a human being and what did it bring what did it bring forth innate way for salvation and the Lord said why because he knew what she would ask for oh I believe it is a bride here that has thus saith the Lord and that the anointing at the third pole can come upon you and you're so in tune with the mind of God you have that said the Lord that when the anointing comes upon you you can speak the word and it coming the manifestation I almost prophesy again hallelujah oh if there ever was a people who can say the right thing and manifested it is the bride where is the third pole in manifestation where is the opening of the word well is the revealing of Christ in the bride the stand Oh hallelujah hallelujah first John 4:2 says hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God now remember we're not talking about just a hearing and going and live in some other life but an understanding now hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God frans what are we looking at we are living in the hour of the revealing of the son of man hereby know ye the spirit or not every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that spirit of Antichrist where he have heard that should come and even now is in the world brother Branham speaking of Hattie ride in my new ministry in 59 he says he is just as much Jehovah Jireh today as he was on that mountain with Abraham he can still produce an animal to his glory these squirrels was not a vision I shocked him blood came out of him I dressed them and I eat them they was a visions they were squirrels I said that saved you over Jireh trying to get his promise over to me in my thickness and dullness of mind well that's just a tear in our church and I thik missing dullness of mine he he could speak my need into existence the same as he just speak Abraham's need into existence I'd know no more than said that until sister Hattie sitting there crying now hadn't said a word and she said that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing Jesus had a good man out of the treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth with that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh she identified with the word I want to say there was a treasure in Hattie Wright's heart and out of the abundance of her heart some man think it's in her heart oh she spoke those words that's nothing but the truth and I believe that's where we are as the Bride of Christ right now well what happens when to omnipotence meet church when God and man come together went to omnipotence means something gots to shake that's what revelation does it shakes away the darkness it shakes away their doubt it takes away the sin it takes away the guilt it takes away the unbelief all of the doubts is a dissolver of doubts whatever your disappointments are whatever your needs are I say this in the name of the Lord I don't want you to miss it now just in your home saying the right thing the Prophet said hearing and I have heard but now I said in that crucial moment now maybe you're in a crucial moment think of the men and the people that I'm acquainted with God by passing all the celebrities and everything to give a poor little humble woman can't even hardly sign her own name and he knowed what she'd asked for she said that's nothing but the truth and when she said that the room felt like it was coming apart I wonder if right now with hands raised oh maybe we could just all agree together and then we will start feeling like the room is about to come apart oh because we're saying the right thing we're saying Amen Lord that's nothing but the truth well maybe your room will start coming apart by the presence of the Lord sweeping in there by bringing the anointing upon you all sickness will flee Devils cast out filled with the Holy Ghost why because the same girl home that provided a neighbor hammering on the mountain is the same God that was here tonight providing for his Brides every knee Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus he's still Jehovah Jireh he's still discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart that's nothing but the truth Oh with the fire me [Music] I am the God that healeth thee I am the God your I said my word and here your disease I just want to make an invitation maybe it might seem strange but I believe the holy ghost has spoken tonight maybe you have a need on your heart and something you're believing for I believe he's the same Jehovah Jireh that provided Abraham a ram upon that mountain he's there tonight to provide you whatever you have need of and how is the Holy Spirit is role and I unto you and you're just welcoming that Holy Spirit there and
