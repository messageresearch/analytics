[15:58] image we pray in jesus' name amen amen
[16:02] you may be
[16:07] seated you know in
[16:09] Exodus
[16:12] 33 um we read a story of
[16:15] how Moses was communing with the Lord
[16:18] one
[16:19] day as all the people were worshiping in
[16:22] their
[16:24] tents and we know the story that Moses
[16:28] was
[16:29] seeking after the Lord because the
[16:31] people had just
[16:34] sinned they created for themselves a
[16:37] beautiful kind of
[16:40] worship but without the
[16:43] word and it had caused the Lord to
[16:46] remove his presence from the camp that's
[16:48] right and to pitch the Tabernacle
[16:50] outside the
[16:53] camp even though the worship service
[16:57] itself was was so loud that it could be
[16:59] heard from the top of the
[17:02] mountain the Lord was nowhere near
[17:07] right so Moses was seeking the face of
[17:09] the
[17:10] Lord and in verse 15 he says Lord If thy
[17:13] presence go not with
[17:16] me carry us up not
[17:21] then if you aren't with us I don't want
[17:23] to go at
[17:27] all when the Lord is speaking to him and
[17:30] he says in verse 19 I will make all my
[17:33] goodness pass before
[17:35] thee and I will proclaim the name of the
[17:38] Lord before thee and will be gracious to
[17:41] whom I will be
[17:42] gracious and will show Mercy to whom I
[17:45] will show
[17:46] mercy and then he says this in verse
[17:50] 20 thou can not see my
[17:54] face for there shall no man see me and
[17:58] live
[18:01] for there shall no man see me and
[18:04] live that was on my mind as I was
[18:07] reading Psalm 41 this week want to go
[18:10] ahead and turn to that we'll be reading
[18:11] that this
[18:13] morning this is again one of those
[18:15] psalms where David is in prayer before
[18:18] the Lord you know a lot of things on his
[18:21] heart a lot of Trials he's going through
[18:25] and he's just communing with the Lord
[18:26] and you know as he gets to that place
[18:29] where the Lord begins to work with him
[18:32] he makes this statement in verse 11 by
[18:37] this I know that thou favor me because
[18:40] mine enemy does not triumph over me and
[18:44] as for me thou uphold us me in mine
[18:47] integrity and sest me before thy face
[18:54] forever so on the one hand we have the
[18:56] Lord telling one prophet
[18:59] that thou can not see my face and
[19:02] live and then here's another Prophet on
[19:06] the other hand declaring that thou sest
[19:09] me before thy face
[19:12] forever you know it turns out that David
[19:15] has a lot to say about the face of the
[19:17] Lord in the
[19:19] Psalms you know for example in Psalm 27
[19:22] he says when thou s seek ye my
[19:25] face my heart said unto me thy face Lord
[19:29] will I
[19:31] seek speaking of a call to seek his
[19:36] face yet thou can not see my face and
[19:41] live other verses speak of the face of
[19:44] the Lord Psalm 246 this is the
[19:46] generation of them that seek him that
[19:49] seek thy
[19:50] face he also speaks of hiding his face
[19:54] yeah you know many times David cries out
[19:56] to the Lord begging him not to hide his
[19:59] face Psalm 1437 hide not thy face from
[20:03] me lest thy be like them that go down
[20:05] into the
[20:06] pit
[20:08] so I can't thou can not see my face and
[20:12] live that's right but if you hide your
[20:14] face from me I go down to the
[20:17] pit Psalm 1022 hide not thy face from me
[20:20] in the day when I am in trouble incline
[20:23] thine ear unto
[20:25] me Psalm 279 hide not thy face far from
[20:29] me put not thy servant away in
[20:33] anger and yet in Psalm 519 his prayer is
[20:37] hide thy face from my
[20:40] sins and blot out all mine
[20:45] iniquities so no man can see my face and
[20:51] live that's right and yet there's a call
[20:54] to seek his
[20:56] face David Avid despairs when the Lord
[20:59] hides his face from
[21:01] him but asks him to hide his face from
[21:04] his
[21:07] sins in Psalm 31:16 he says this make
[21:10] thy face to shine upon thy
[21:13] servant oh save me for my Mercy's sake
[21:18] three times in Psalm 80 David says turn
[21:22] us again oh God and cause thy face to
[21:25] shine and we shall be saved
[21:29] Psalm 119 135 make thy face to shine
[21:33] upon thy servant and teach me thy
[21:37] statutes now the effect of the face of
[21:40] the Lord is
[21:42] salvation and
[21:45] instruction but thou can not see my face
[21:49] and
[21:51] live you know elsewhere in the Scripture
[21:53] it speaks of the Lord setting his face
[21:55] against a person or a people and
[21:59] them being plagued and
[22:02] destroyed yet now in Psalm 41 as we read
[22:06] this this morning David
[22:08] rejoices because the Lord has set him
[22:10] before his face
[22:14] forever the face of the
[22:17] lord it's
[22:19] salvation yet it's judgment and
[22:23] destruction it's
[22:25] death but something he desires we seek
[22:29] and can
[22:31] find it's something we don't want
[22:35] hidden but we do want hidden from our
[22:39] sins something that we desire to be set
[22:43] before but something we don't want set
[22:46] against
[22:47] us the face of the
[22:50] Lord as Nicodemus said how can these
[22:54] things
[22:56] be how can we we seek his face be set
[23:00] before his face but no man can see his
[23:02] face and
[23:04] live it says in John 1:18 John makes
[23:07] this statement no man hath seen God at
[23:10] any
[23:11] time the only begotten son which is in
[23:16] the bosom of the
[23:17] father he hath declared
[23:21] him the face of the Lord has been
[23:25] declared it has been made known
[23:28] it has been made manifest through a
[23:30] reflected image
[23:33] amen his son almost like a solar
[23:39] eclipse he says later in 1 John 1 that
[23:42] which was from the beginning which we
[23:44] have heard which we have seen with our
[23:48] eyes which we have looked
[23:52] upon so that
[23:55] unapproachable unseeable
[23:58] face has been declared into to us in a
[24:01] manner that can be
[24:04] seen and
[24:06] approached not only that but in 1 John
[24:10] 4:9 in this was manifested the love of
[24:13] God toward us because that God sent his
[24:17] only begotten son into the world that we
[24:20] might live through him that's
[24:23] right or as Paul says it this way in
[24:26] Colossians 3 if you're risen with Christ
[24:30] ye are dead and your life is
[24:33] hid with Christ in
[24:37] God so if we're already
[24:40] dead we can't
[24:44] die Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with
[24:47] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[24:52] Christ liveth in
[24:55] me and the life which I now live In the
[24:59] Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[25:02] God an entrance has been
[25:05] ministered whereby we may have
[25:08] boldness to enter into his
[25:11] holiest by a New and Living
[25:15] Way you know as David says in Psalm 41
[25:19] as for me thou uphold us my integrity
[25:22] and sest me before thy face forever
[25:30] a
[25:31] place I could not go without
[25:35] death he has set me a place by
[25:39] him you know as the Lord told Moses in
[25:42] Exodus
[25:44] 33 thou can not see my face for thou sh
[25:48] for there shall no man see me and live
[25:50] but you know
[25:52] behold there is a place by
[25:55] me and thou shalt stand upon upon a rock
[25:58] that's right and it shall come to pass
[26:01] while my Glory passeth by that I will
[26:05] put thee in a cleft of The Rock and will
[26:08] cover thee with my hand while I pass by
[26:12] there's a place prepared where you may
[26:15] see his face and oh by the way this was
[26:18] Moses right there in his
[26:20] tent let's go ahead and stand this
[26:25] morning I don't know about you but I'm
[26:27] grateful there's a
[26:28] place an entrance has been ministered
[26:32] where I can be set before his face and
[26:35] live where I can seek his face and where
[26:41] there can be instruction and
[26:44] salvation as he
[26:46] says Thou uphold us me in mine integrity
[26:49] and settest me before thy face
[26:52] forever let's just read that Psalm 41
[26:55] together it's 13 verses starting verse
[26:58] one blessed is he that consider the poor
[27:01] the Lord will deliver him in time of
[27:03] trouble the Lord will preserve him and
[27:06] keep him alive and he shall be blessed
[27:08] upon the Earth and thou will not deliver
[27:11] him unto the will of his enemies the
[27:13] Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of
[27:15] languishing thou will make all his bed
[27:17] in his sickness I said Lord be merciful
[27:21] unto me heal my soul for I have sinned
[27:23] against thee my enemies speak evil of me
[27:27] when shall die and his name perish and
[27:29] if he come to see me he speaketh vanity
[27:32] his heart gathereth iniquity to itself
[27:35] when he goeth abroad he tth it all that
[27:38] hate me whisper together against me
[27:40] against me do they devise my hurt an
[27:43] evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto
[27:46] him and now that he lith he shall rise
[27:48] up no more yay my own familiar friend in
[27:52] whom I trusted which did eat of my bread
[27:54] hath lifted up his heel against me but
[27:57] thou oh Lord be merciful unto me and
[28:00] raise me up that I may requite them by
[28:03] this I know that thou favor me because
[28:06] mine enemy does not triumph over me and
[28:09] as for me thou uphold me in mine

[54:36] this morning in Jesus precious name we
[54:41] pray amen God bless you may be seated
[54:44] thank you musicians this
[54:46] morning
[54:49] um you know I I I wanted to um just take
[54:54] a moment
[54:56] uh to fellowship and with you and and I
[55:00] uh I just want to if I could say uh this
[55:06] to uh in my
[55:10] relationship with
[55:12] you uh and I I just wrote a note here is
[55:17] I think it's important that you
[55:21] understand my position as a pastor and
[55:25] the things that I can do and I can't do
[55:30] because I'm governed by the word of God
[55:33] you know I don't really care what
[55:36] anybody
[55:37] thinks outside of our congregation but I
[55:41] do care what you think that that's
[55:44] important to me you know and and of
[55:47] course my greatest desire is that you
[55:51] know that uh I I try to bring
[55:55] bring uh you the word of God just the
[55:59] way that the prophet of God said it um I
[56:04] do I do my best not
[56:06] to uh
[56:09] incorporate is my Revelation but in one
[56:12] sense I can only preach my
[56:15] Revelation and so but I always uh want
[56:20] you to know that it's not my position to
[56:23] make you believe the way I
[56:26] believe okay I I'm not going to spend
[56:29] hours trying to get you to describe
[56:33] things in the same
[56:36] terminology that I describe things and
[56:40] and to make emphasis over and over again
[56:44] that you might see it the way that I see
[56:47] it uh because that's not really uh my
[56:51] position uh uh the number number one
[56:55] thing that I'm supposed to do is just
[56:57] preach the
[56:58] gospel okay that's what my position is
[57:02] and it it's and when it comes to
[57:06] counseling and
[57:07] things uh the only thing I can do is
[57:10] bring you in remembrance of what the
[57:13] word of God said or what the prophet of
[57:16] God said because if everybody would stay
[57:20] with the word the word would
[57:22] automatically correct the air
[57:26] you you understand if people would uh uh
[57:29] pray first so whenever you come to me
[57:33] you're way down on the bottom of the
[57:35] ladder there's lots of things in between
[57:39] first of all prayer reading the
[57:41] scripture studying to show show yourself
[57:45] approved uh finding out what the
[57:47] messenger said but if you ever have to
[57:50] come to me you have to understand my
[57:53] position my position I isn't a
[57:57] psychiatrist or a
[57:59] psychologist you know it's not to give
[58:02] you uh what I think you ought to do on
[58:07] it's to tell you what the word of God
[58:10] says and to bring you in
[58:13] remembrance of the things that he
[58:17] said uh and you know another thing is is
[58:22] it's uh my position isn't to take
[58:27] sides you know in fact even that's how
[58:30] the pastor describes what a pastor
[58:33] supposed to be he's supposed to be in
[58:35] the middle of the road when there's two
[58:38] different opinions and bring both of the
[58:41] opinions back to this middle of the road
[58:45] which is the word of God so you know
[58:48] it's not my job to to you know to side
[58:54] uh differences not to take sides it it's
[58:58] to stay with the
[59:02] word and uh so I think sometimes uh you
[59:08] know people
[59:10] uh want me to be more than I'm allowed
[59:13] to be you understand I'm not allowed to
[59:17] be the scripture tells me that I cannot
[59:20] Lord over God's
[59:23] Heritage you
[59:25] understand so it's that's important that
[59:29] you understand that you know what I mean
[59:32] so and and also uh you know it it's
[59:37] important that I'm not
[59:41] influenced by money by
[59:44] popularity by family or friends right
[59:49] you know what I mean you have to
[59:51] understand that go that goes that I have
[59:54] to to do my best not to be
[59:58] influenced by things I have to do my
[1:00:02] best to preach the gospel to everybody
[1:00:05] at every
[1:00:07] level you you understand you can't have
[1:00:10] a group of people that are more
[1:00:12] spiritual they're more into the
[1:00:14] Mysteries they're more into the deeper
[1:00:17] things I I I it's not my position just
[1:00:21] to take those people and single them out
[1:00:26] because they're easier to preach to or
[1:00:29] they might look at things the way that I
[1:00:33] look at things okay my position is to
[1:00:36] preach to the children to the young
[1:00:38] adults to everybody to
[1:00:42] go to Encompass it all and and uh and it
[1:00:50] it's not my position to
[1:00:53] govern your life
[1:00:55] lives and and I want you to know that
[1:00:58] that that I I'm not allowed I don't
[1:01:01] govern your lives you know what I mean
[1:01:04] whether you buy this or buy that or move
[1:01:07] here or move to that house I know
[1:01:10] there's a lot of Ministries a lot of
[1:01:12] cultures that a person won't move from
[1:01:15] one house to the other without talking
[1:01:17] to the pastor it's not my
[1:01:21] job you know what I mean you live where
[1:01:23] you want to live
[1:01:26] you know what I'm saying the the only
[1:01:28] thing I can preach to you is is pay your
[1:01:31] bills try to stay out of debt try to
[1:01:35] live where you can go to church you know
[1:01:38] what I mean put God first that that's
[1:01:40] what governs you not me it's not my job
[1:01:43] to make choices for you and sit down if
[1:01:47] if you did everybody be driving a Ford
[1:01:50] and and this and that and you know what
[1:01:52] I mean and everybody have their hair cut
[1:01:56] the way that I wanted it
[1:01:58] cut you know what I mean so uh you know
[1:02:02] that it's not my job to cover you know
[1:02:04] what I mean it's not my job to make you
[1:02:06] afraid of
[1:02:08] me you know what I'm saying like whoa I
[1:02:11] don't want the pastor to be mad at me
[1:02:15] you know if if you've ever sat under a
[1:02:17] Ministry where you're afraid of the
[1:02:18] pastor you've never had one that's
[1:02:22] exactly okay you you know it's just not
[1:02:26] what I'm about you know what I mean I I
[1:02:30] I'm just like you U you know I I I I I
[1:02:34] fight the same devil you fight you know
[1:02:37] I'm not granted with some great big
[1:02:40] spiritual uh ability above everybody
[1:02:44] else you know I pray just like you pray
[1:02:46] I get sick just the way that you get
[1:02:49] sick you you know what I mean there's
[1:02:52] there's absolutely
[1:02:54] nothing different from
[1:02:57] you a and myself as far as life
[1:03:01] concerned as far as a gift that's God
[1:03:04] operates that gift and you operate that
[1:03:07] gift if you're hungry for the word of
[1:03:09] God God will help me bring you the the
[1:03:12] word of God if you're not hungry for the
[1:03:14] word of God uh you know we'll uh not
[1:03:17] have evening service and you can all go
[1:03:20] home and watch the Super Bowl you know
[1:03:23] what I mean if you think think it's a
[1:03:24] Super Bowl you know I mean this country
[1:03:28] is going to buil bet
[1:03:31] 25 no $85 billion dollar will be beted
[1:03:36] gambling you know I mean it's it's a
[1:03:39] joke and then after it's over it's
[1:03:42] over how many knows who won the 1968
[1:03:46] Super Bowl I don't I didn't even know
[1:03:50] who won last year what difference does
[1:03:53] it make it's fake
[1:03:56] you know what I mean but it's not my job
[1:03:58] to to govern and and and
[1:04:02] uh you know and and there are things
[1:04:06] that it's not my place to make a
[1:04:08] decision to
[1:04:10] make you you know what I'm saying so
[1:04:12] it's not it it's not uh
[1:04:16] uh up to me to decide whether you can
[1:04:20] get
[1:04:21] together like you know if all the people
[1:04:24] people from uh uh from wherever you're
[1:04:28] from want to get together and have a
[1:04:31] picnic you want to get together and have
[1:04:34] a
[1:04:35] dinner that's not my
[1:04:38] choice you know it's not my decision you
[1:04:41] know who gets together and why you want
[1:04:44] to get together you can do that you know
[1:04:47] what I mean I it's not my choice you can
[1:04:49] do what you want to do you you know what
[1:04:52] I mean and I don't have to be
[1:04:55] invited you you understand I don't have
[1:04:58] to be there uh so uh you you've got to
[1:05:03] understand if you want to have people
[1:05:04] over Thanksgiving fine if you want to
[1:05:07] have a baby shower fine you know what I
[1:05:11] mean it's it's not a church
[1:05:14] function you know I mean your dinners
[1:05:16] are not a church function getting out
[1:05:18] there together is not a church friend
[1:05:20] you don't have to call me and say you
[1:05:23] know there a bunch of us would like to
[1:05:25] get together and have dinner
[1:05:27] great you know what I mean it I'd rather
[1:05:30] tell you all great instead of get 50
[1:05:33] phone calls can we have a dinner can we
[1:05:35] get together and have a dinner it's not
[1:05:38] my position it's not my place it's not
[1:05:42] that's what you're born again for that's
[1:05:44] what you have the Holy Spirit for yeah
[1:05:48] you know what I mean and and so you
[1:05:51] don't need my
[1:05:53] permission you don't need my permission
[1:05:57] now there are some things you have to
[1:06:00] understand now
[1:06:03] and so the scripture is very
[1:06:08] specific about
[1:06:11] the the positions of men and women in
[1:06:16] the scripture you all and you know so
[1:06:20] I'll just read this little scripture to
[1:06:22] you because I think it it's
[1:06:25] extremely uh um strong but it says
[1:06:32] um for God is not the author of
[1:06:36] confusion but of Peace as in all
[1:06:40] churches of the Saints let your woman
[1:06:43] keep silence in the
[1:06:45] church for it is not permitted unto them
[1:06:49] to
[1:06:50] speak but they are commanded to be be
[1:06:54] under obedience as also saith the
[1:06:58] law and if they will learn
[1:07:03] anything let them ask their husbands at
[1:07:07] home for it is a shame for a woman to
[1:07:11] speak in the
[1:07:13] church and and so you have to understand
[1:07:16] that there's a
[1:07:20] relationship
[1:07:22] between the husb usband and the wife now
[1:07:27] I know the brothers have got together
[1:07:30] and they
[1:07:31] have a men's breakfast they want to come
[1:07:35] together and say uh we we want to meet
[1:07:40] and fellowship and have a
[1:07:44] breakfast well I know the sisters then
[1:07:47] they feel like well we want to come
[1:07:49] together and have a sister's breakfast
[1:07:53] but but you understand I cannot insert
[1:07:57] myself between the authority of the
[1:08:00] husband over his
[1:08:03] wife do you understand what I'm saying I
[1:08:07] can't gather the sisters
[1:08:10] together and have a sister's
[1:08:13] meeting because I'm the
[1:08:15] pastor lesie can't have a sister's
[1:08:20] meeting cuz I won't let
[1:08:22] her
[1:08:25] you you you you understand what I'm
[1:08:27] saying so it's not Tit for Tat that's
[1:08:31] that's between if you have a question
[1:08:34] ask your
[1:08:35] husband you know what I mean but you see
[1:08:38] that's in the Book of Judges uh you know
[1:08:41] that uh uh Samson gave a
[1:08:46] riddle and they came back and answered
[1:08:49] the riddle and and Samson said if you
[1:08:52] had not plowed with my heer in other
[1:08:54] words if you hadn't talked with my
[1:08:57] wife you wouldn't have known these
[1:09:01] things you see and and I'm not allowed
[1:09:04] to do
[1:09:05] that I'm not allowed to to say I'm going
[1:09:10] to gather the sisters together and the
[1:09:13] sisters are going to do this or the
[1:09:16] sisters are going to do this or we want
[1:09:18] to do that if you do that under the
[1:09:21] leadership of your husband I can't say
[1:09:24] anything about
[1:09:26] it you understand that so I I'm I'm not
[1:09:30] free to to run off and and start this
[1:09:34] and start that or start this or do this
[1:09:37] or do that and and so you can't put me
[1:09:41] in a position that I'm not allowed to
[1:09:45] go and I didn't know maybe you didn't
[1:09:48] think I was
[1:09:50] governed you you know what I mean but I
[1:09:52] got a lot more restrict frictions on me
[1:09:54] than you have on
[1:09:56] you and so I want you to to know that so
[1:10:01] uh you know the if the sisters have a
[1:10:05] baby shower and they want to go to baby
[1:10:07] shower I presume that all of you have
[1:10:09] the your husband's
[1:10:11] permission you know what I mean and uh I
[1:10:15] can't get involved in that so we if you
[1:10:19] understand that I I just want you
[1:10:22] to understand that there's one thing
[1:10:26] that is above us all and that's the word
[1:10:30] of
[1:10:31] God that's the word of God so uh I I uh
[1:10:37] it it there's nothing personal either
[1:10:41] way if all the Zimbabwean people want to
[1:10:44] get together and have a you know have
[1:10:48] Zimbabwean food or all the congales or
[1:10:51] the Hispanic people or the Irish people
[1:10:55] or are you know and you want you can do
[1:10:58] all that that that just just not it has
[1:11:00] nothing to do with
[1:11:01] church it's not a church
[1:11:04] thing you know if your child wants to
[1:11:07] play
[1:11:08] sports it's fine that's your family
[1:11:11] that's a family decision it's a
[1:11:13] husband's decision I presume you're you
[1:11:16] would talk that over whether or not you
[1:11:19] would watch your children and go your
[1:11:21] children now there are things that I can
[1:11:24] preach against like having televisions
[1:11:26] in the home and and how you dress but
[1:11:28] you know the prophet of a young lady
[1:11:31] came to brother Brandon and he said told
[1:11:34] her he says well your parents are
[1:11:36] farther down the road that's why they
[1:11:38] feel the way they feel he said but you
[1:11:41] be a Christian wherever you are and if
[1:11:45] your child can't play sports and be a
[1:11:48] Christian then you talk with them have
[1:11:51] them get the Holy Ghost and and you know
[1:11:54] and uh um and and I'm I'm not against
[1:11:59] Sports it's not my job to make a
[1:12:01] decision in sports it's your
[1:12:05] job you understand that it's it's your
[1:12:08] job to decide what's best for your
[1:12:12] children it's not my job to make family
[1:12:15] decisions so do you want you understand
[1:12:19] where I'm coming from so if it has
[1:12:22] nothing to do
[1:12:24] you know uh it I can't give my
[1:12:28] blessings or my
[1:12:31] cursings I've got to stay out of it so
[1:12:35] if you want to do
[1:12:37] something you pray about it talk to your
[1:12:41] husbands about it and and he's the head
[1:12:45] I am not cannot insert my
[1:12:49] headship between the husband and wife
[1:12:52] between the husband
[1:12:54] and his
[1:12:55] family and the order in which I have to
[1:13:00] go is I have to go from word to husband
[1:13:05] husband to family and if you say what
[1:13:08] happens if you don't have a
[1:13:13] husband the order is from you to your
[1:13:17] father and then your father to me if you
[1:13:22] don't have a
[1:13:24] father and you don't have a
[1:13:26] husband then me and my wife will try to
[1:13:31] counsel you back according to the word
[1:13:35] of God because and so I just say these
[1:13:39] things because I think it's important
[1:13:43] that you understand that I don't have
[1:13:46] all the
[1:13:48] authority sometimes that you think I
[1:13:52] should have and I can't make all the
[1:13:55] decisions and calls that you think I
[1:13:59] should be making it's not my place and I
[1:14:03] can't leave my place I have hard enough
[1:14:05] time with myself let alone getting out
[1:14:08] of my place amen so I just hope you
[1:14:11] understand that and uh understand really
[1:14:15] the position of a pastor is to feed the
[1:14:19] Sheep amen is to to lead them in the
[1:14:23] path of God's word it's it's not to
[1:14:27] create a social structure or to to
[1:14:30] choose so if you will do that so uh
[1:14:33] we're going to uh just turn again if
[1:14:36] let's stand and turn to
[1:14:43] Romans I believe it's the 12th chapter
[1:14:46] of Romans that we've been reading if I
[1:14:49] got that right in my memory
[1:14:59] um and we want to read Romans again it
[1:15:02] says I beseech you therefore Brethren by
[1:15:06] the mercies of God that ye present your
[1:15:09] bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly
[1:15:12] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:15:15] reasonable
[1:15:18] service and be not conformed to this
[1:15:21] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:15:25] of your mind that ye may prove that what
[1:15:32] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:15:37] and perfect will of God father we ask
[1:15:40] you to bless your word to us in Jesus
[1:15:43] precious name we pray amen God bless you
[1:15:46] this morning we're going to have a a
[1:15:49] wonderful uh portion of uh a tape this
[1:15:54] morning uh uh and I I trust it will
[1:15:59] bless you so to understand what we've
[1:16:02] been talking about we we've been talking
[1:16:05] about the law of the seed the law of the
[1:16:10] seed that that when God chose to create
[1:16:15] the world he chose to do it by by seed
[1:16:21] so in other words it wasn't going to be
[1:16:24] uh uh speak in other words a banana tree
[1:16:29] you know and all of a sudden a banana
[1:16:32] tree appeared no he he spoke the word
[1:16:36] and instead of having a banana tree he
[1:16:39] planted a banana
[1:16:41] seed and then however long it took his
[1:16:46] Spirit brooded over that until that that
[1:16:50] came forth and so everything that God
[1:16:53] did he did it in seed form that was what
[1:16:59] that was the law of the seed and we
[1:17:01] understood that now how why that Eve
[1:17:05] could say that that she had received a a
[1:17:10] child of the Lord when uh she bore forth
[1:17:16] Cain which we knew came from The
[1:17:20] Serpent and we we've been talking about
[1:17:23] that the importance of understanding
[1:17:26] serpent seed and to understand the seed
[1:17:30] and the law of the sea how it could only
[1:17:34] bring forth of its kind and so in order
[1:17:38] for for uh Lucifer to to exalt himself
[1:17:44] over the sons of God and to build a
[1:17:47] better Kingdom and to build an Eden he
[1:17:51] had to have something that would produce
[1:17:54] after its kind so he had to have a way
[1:17:58] to reproduce
[1:18:00] himself to reproduce himself which is
[1:18:03] different than coming under the
[1:18:05] influence of something and Jesus
[1:18:08] referred to it and he finally looked at
[1:18:10] him he said you're of your father's the
[1:18:13] devil you know that you're unbelievers
[1:18:16] of the word of God and another place our
[1:18:19] Prophet said to us he says they don't
[1:18:22] have any thing within them to believe
[1:18:25] with and words there's not a seed in
[1:18:28] them there's not something in them and
[1:18:30] so we're we we we're trying to really
[1:18:33] get us to come to that place uh where we
[1:18:37] have that inner
[1:18:39] faith that that faith that comes from
[1:18:43] from not our sight not our senses not
[1:18:48] our emotions not our makeup of our
[1:18:51] outward senses and our inward senses but
[1:18:55] we come to that place where that six s
[1:18:59] that thing the prophet of God talks
[1:19:01] about that down on the inside of that is
[1:19:04] a
[1:19:05] soul and and and he said some people
[1:19:08] have a little serpent there and other
[1:19:12] people have the seed of God there and we
[1:19:15] we realize that we can't judge that by
[1:19:18] the flesh they were lines that would
[1:19:21] have been perfect lines Cain and and and
[1:19:25] Abel if their their lines would have
[1:19:28] just been straight down the line but
[1:19:31] what happens is that the sons of God saw
[1:19:34] the daughters of men were fair and then
[1:19:37] they begin to mix it and even the the
[1:19:40] human race is hybrid our fith our our
[1:19:44] flesh is
[1:19:46] hybrid and so you have to understand
[1:19:50] that when it comes to interracial
[1:19:53] marriage it doesn't have anything to do
[1:19:55] with the word of God it has to do with
[1:19:58] the the plan of God that everything
[1:20:01] bring forth of its kind and we know that
[1:20:04] different cultures and different races
[1:20:07] marry each other and and we have uh
[1:20:10] different uh skin types different facial
[1:20:15] features that's that's just the way that
[1:20:17] the hybriding
[1:20:19] wind you you you understand and and
[1:20:22] there's nothing that that we can do
[1:20:25] about it it has nothing to do with
[1:20:27] prejudice it doesn't have anything to do
[1:20:30] uh with um what's right and what's wrong
[1:20:34] it has to do with the word of God Amen
[1:20:37] the law of
[1:20:38] God and so to to try to to go back to
[1:20:43] the law of God we can't undo things
[1:20:46] that's right you you understand that in
[1:20:48] other words if if you come from a a a a
[1:20:52] a mix marriage or or or two different uh
[1:20:56] cultures married and all those things
[1:20:59] that you can't go back and undo anything
[1:21:02] the only thing you can do is if the seed
[1:21:05] of God's in you is bring yourself under
[1:21:08] subjection to God's
[1:21:11] word and so
[1:21:13] uh all those lines have been crossed the
[1:21:17] only line that hasn't meant crossed is
[1:21:20] the seed word of God
[1:21:24] that's still what's in us and so no
[1:21:28] matter what your carnal situation is or
[1:21:31] your fleshly situation is we don't want
[1:21:35] to find our faith in the flesh we want
[1:21:38] to find our faith in our
[1:21:41] heart we want to find our faith in our
[1:21:44] inner being CU he said that he would be
[1:21:48] like a Fountain of Living Water
[1:21:52] springing up within us and and so
[1:21:56] there's got to be some place that we can
[1:21:59] go to because if God is going to require
[1:22:03] of you
[1:22:05] faith and
[1:22:07] Revelation there there's go he's got to
[1:22:10] give you something to believe in you
[1:22:14] know what I mean something that he can
[1:22:16] show you he he's not going to try to
[1:22:19] tell lay a bunch of stuff out here and
[1:22:23] have you try to sort through it and
[1:22:25] determine what you believe and what you
[1:22:28] don't believe he he's going to place
[1:22:31] something inside of you that he can
[1:22:34] contact remember the great story about
[1:22:37] the magnet that he said that went down
[1:22:40] then it swept out over the floor he was
[1:22:43] at a manufacturing place a a great tool
[1:22:47] making place and and there there was
[1:22:50] some over there uh tooling on a aluminum
[1:22:53] and there was some over there uh tooling
[1:22:56] on steel and copper and and different
[1:22:59] things working and he said at the end of
[1:23:01] the day all of a sudden a great
[1:23:04] magnet went down and it swung all across
[1:23:08] that place and and the and certain
[1:23:10] metals were connected right away to that
[1:23:14] magnet but you know aluminum won't hook
[1:23:17] on a magnet
[1:23:19] yeah you know and if you ever noce
[1:23:21] people that want to know what something
[1:23:23] is before they drill it or something
[1:23:25] they'll take a magnet and they'll put it
[1:23:27] on and if it don't stick it's not steel
[1:23:32] I don't care how much it looks like
[1:23:33] steel it's aluminum you know what I mean
[1:23:36] aluminum is not as strongest steel lot
[1:23:39] of things we could go into but but but
[1:23:42] there was something that connected right
[1:23:45] and there's something in you amen that
[1:23:49] connects with the word of God right
[1:23:53] regardless of what your outward shell
[1:23:56] is you understand God didn't judge you
[1:24:01] or make you or plant his seed based on
[1:24:05] your
[1:24:06] genealogy he did it before there was a
[1:24:09] genealogy in the foundation of the
[1:24:12] beginning of the world before there was
[1:24:14] a moon before there was a star he placed
[1:24:17] it in you so you might have got here
[1:24:20] through all kinds of different circum
[1:24:22] ances through all kinds of different
[1:24:24] marriages through all kinds of things
[1:24:26] your parents May divorced and remarried
[1:24:29] and and this and that and all that that
[1:24:32] has nothing to do with you and God's
[1:24:37] word God's word is personal to
[1:24:41] you you know it doesn't matter if your
[1:24:45] if your parents don't get along or they
[1:24:47] do get along that has nothing to do with
[1:24:50] you personally
[1:24:53] and that's what I'm talking about when
[1:24:54] you come down and you've got to be able
[1:24:57] to separate the whole world and not look
[1:25:01] outside for your faith but look inside
[1:25:04] for your
[1:25:06] faith your faith is within you amen God
[1:25:10] placed the kingdom of God within you
[1:25:13] that's that's why you can't understand
[1:25:16] the beginning nor the end of it don't
[1:25:19] ask me how I got in this pulpit
[1:25:23] cuz I can't figure it out how I was a
[1:25:26] hippie boy how I was living in
[1:25:29] California how I the people I listened
[1:25:32] to the people that had influence on my
[1:25:35] life the path that I came I can only go
[1:25:38] to one thing is that somebody had to
[1:25:41] have their hand on me and if he took me
[1:25:44] from there he didn't take me from there
[1:25:46] to drop me off along the Wayside he that
[1:25:49] started a work in me's going to finish
[1:25:51] it all the way to the
[1:25:54] end and you might go through a lot of
[1:25:57] things the prophet of God said sometimes
[1:25:59] a man will stumble from church to church
[1:26:01] religion to religion everywhere going
[1:26:04] and searching but one day he hears that
[1:26:07] eagle stream one day he hears that voice
[1:26:11] you may have been through all kinds of
[1:26:13] emotions all kinds of trials in your
[1:26:15] lives all kinds of failures all kinds of
[1:26:19] problems all kinds of of of habits and
[1:26:22] everything but when that voice strikes
[1:26:25] that seed there's something in you that
[1:26:28] says
[1:26:29] amen that's
[1:26:32] right and then you don't care what the
[1:26:34] world thinks you don't care you're not
[1:26:37] you don't care about what they think of
[1:26:39] your position what what they think about
[1:26:42] your thing there's only one thing you
[1:26:43] know you've got if you've got a thirst
[1:26:47] for what struck your
[1:26:49] heart and you want more of that yes
[1:26:53] that's what you want more of I want more
[1:26:55] of God I want more of the word I want
[1:26:57] more of life I want to be more like him
[1:27:00] and you found something that can
[1:27:03] transform
[1:27:06] you and that's what's beautiful yes sir
[1:27:10] you say Brother David why do you love
[1:27:11] this message so much because I was in a
[1:27:14] dark
[1:27:16] spot amen if I could say that I was in
[1:27:20] prison I was one of them HS that was in
[1:27:24] prison there's no way I could have got
[1:27:26] out of what that I was
[1:27:28] in I couldn't think my way out of it I
[1:27:32] couldn't work my way out of it the My
[1:27:35] Flesh had control in me but one day I
[1:27:40] heard something that gave me
[1:27:44] life and it blessed
[1:27:47] me and oh I had a thirst for it amen
[1:27:53] I was hungry to hear it and you know the
[1:27:56] most beautiful thing about the word of
[1:27:58] God I love is I've haven't learned it
[1:28:01] all yet I will never learn it all I will
[1:28:04] always want more he always has more from
[1:28:08] me it'll always get better it'll always
[1:28:11] get richer my eyes can always see
[1:28:17] farther you are not stuck where you
[1:28:21] are
[1:28:23] and this is the last place I want to be
[1:28:25] stuck as in this
[1:28:27] world cuz it's going
[1:28:31] backwards it is it's going backwards so
[1:28:35] they they're going one way and we're
[1:28:37] going
[1:28:39] up and so this morning if you would bear
[1:28:42] with me because my desire for you is
[1:28:45] really to come to the
[1:28:49] place regardless of your weakness
[1:28:53] and I don't know any of you have ever
[1:28:56] had siblings you know that all your
[1:28:59] brothers and sisters are rotten but
[1:29:02] you well they feel the same
[1:29:05] way you know what I mean but we are a
[1:29:11] part of something that God is
[1:29:16] doing and we don't want you to find your
[1:29:20] faith from the outside
[1:29:23] we want you to find your faith from
[1:29:26] within the prophet of God made a
[1:29:28] statement that that I've heard it for
[1:29:31] years I've quoted it for years but I've
[1:29:35] never come to the
[1:29:38] realization of what he was saying and
[1:29:40] I'm still coming to the realization of
[1:29:42] it but he said pray to him with is in
[1:29:48] you now that's amazing statement
[1:29:53] pray him with was within you we're going
[1:29:56] to listen to 16 minutes this morning of
[1:30:04] the message called the spoken word is
[1:30:09] the Original
[1:30:11] Seed so remember a seed is in its
[1:30:16] beginning
[1:30:17] form right so a seed has within it
[1:30:22] the power to
[1:30:24] transform from what God pled to what his
[1:30:29] intention of that seed was is it is an
[1:30:34] apple tree an apple tree in seed
[1:30:37] form
[1:30:39] yes every fruit that's ever going to
[1:30:43] come from that apple tree is in that
[1:30:47] seed now we're trying to find our faith
[1:30:50] because where's Faith final resting
[1:30:53] place the word of God faith has got to
[1:30:57] rest on the word of
[1:31:00] God that's where your faith is you not
[1:31:03] not your faith isn't in your
[1:31:06] understanding of it your faith isn't in
[1:31:08] your ability to explain it your faith is
[1:31:11] in the ability to say God said so that
[1:31:14] settles
[1:31:16] it you know and I I feel you should feel
[1:31:20] the same way there there's a law the
[1:31:23] prophet of God said why don't they stop
[1:31:25] it they know their High breeding's kill
[1:31:27] killing them he says why why won't they
[1:31:30] stop it and he said they can't because
[1:31:33] God said so that's right and that's what
[1:31:37] solves every situation as God said so I
[1:31:40] want to just read a statement uh to you
[1:31:44] and then so we can start this and
[1:31:47] fellowship on it and have it be a a
[1:31:50] blessing to us
[1:31:52] uh but this is what he
[1:31:57] says he says now remember every spoken
[1:32:01] word of God is the
[1:32:05] Original
[1:32:07] Seed amen so that's right everything
[1:32:11] that's not spoken word is a what a high
[1:32:16] bread it's a
[1:32:19] mixture it's a mixture and
[1:32:22] and and if we need in our lives in our
[1:32:27] spiritual
[1:32:28] lives is
[1:32:30] to prune
[1:32:32] out the hybrid things that's right the
[1:32:36] things that are mixed and that's all
[1:32:39] that Satan has done to you since you've
[1:32:41] been a young child is mixed his ideas
[1:32:45] mixed his education mixed his
[1:32:48] civilization mixed everything you are
[1:32:51] you are a a product of the voices that
[1:32:54] have been talking to
[1:32:57] you you go to school and maybe you you
[1:33:00] do it and you have a friend and they
[1:33:02] like to play tennis and you like that
[1:33:04] friend and they get you out and now
[1:33:06] you're playing
[1:33:08] tennis you know what I mean and and the
[1:33:10] only reason you became a tennis player
[1:33:13] it is is not because you know uh I can't
[1:33:18] think of any tennis players but Arthur
[1:33:20] Ash and he's be so far over your guys's
[1:33:23] heads you but anyway uh uh you know it
[1:33:28] just may not even be a
[1:33:30] talent you know and you develop it or
[1:33:33] whatever somebody influenced you to go
[1:33:35] this way that way you didn't chose where
[1:33:37] you were born at you know okay I like
[1:33:41] what David said he says I you were my
[1:33:43] God I was cast upon you from my mother's
[1:33:46] Billy I didn't have no choice but God
[1:33:50] was
[1:33:52] he he got your great-grandfather and
[1:33:54] your great grandfather and he got them
[1:33:56] to marry and them to marry and them to
[1:33:58] mix and everything to bring you into the
[1:34:01] world so you might not understand why
[1:34:04] you were born where you were born when
[1:34:06] you but if you come back to the word of
[1:34:09] God God will make all that clear to
[1:34:12] you that's right because every spoken
[1:34:17] word every word of God is the Original
[1:34:21] Seed
[1:34:23] the word of God is the only seed that
[1:34:28] was originally
[1:34:31] planted anything else that's planted
[1:34:34] whether it's education
[1:34:37] civiliz knowledge science if it's not
[1:34:41] 100% pure word is hybrid and what do we
[1:34:45] know about things that are hybrid they
[1:34:50] die
[1:34:52] The Original Seed is the only thing that
[1:34:56] contained eternal
[1:35:00] life and this is why our Prophet told us
[1:35:04] if you have eternal life you always had
[1:35:09] eternal
[1:35:10] life you would have never received the
[1:35:14] pure unadulterated word of God if there
[1:35:17] wasn't a seed in you to receive it
[1:35:21] that's
[1:35:23] right if not you just ended up with some
[1:35:28] idea and I can say this all of you have
[1:35:32] an opportunity to
[1:35:35] listen to the original word that was
[1:35:40] spoken in Our
[1:35:43] Generation by the promised scriptures of
[1:35:48] Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 and Revelations
[1:35:52] 10:7 which told you that one had come to
[1:35:57] restore back the revelation of the word
[1:36:00] that our fathers had so every spoken
[1:36:04] word is the Original Seed if you have a
[1:36:08] a a some sort of uh device or phone or
[1:36:13] tablet
[1:36:14] or whatever that you would like to
[1:36:17] listen to we're going to start in
[1:36:19] paragraph 118
[1:36:23] and and and with this statement now
[1:36:26] remember
[1:36:28] correctly that's why each
[1:36:31] generation has its own Revival amen it
[1:36:36] gets a chance at the
[1:36:39] word then they hybrid it instead of T of
[1:36:45] taking on they go somewhere else that's
[1:36:49] the statement we're going to start with
[1:36:51] we're going to listen to 18 minutes this
[1:36:53] is a
[1:36:54] very strong 18 minutes and I I um my
[1:36:58] desire is that you find yourself in
[1:37:03] here okay you find yourself in these
[1:37:07] this little 18 minutes when we're done
[1:37:10] we'll go back and make a few comments on
[1:37:12] it and we'll try to be out as soon as
[1:37:17] that we can so let's enjoy this
[1:37:19] wonderful teaching
[1:37:21] of this this message is 6 hours and some
[1:37:25] minutes long so 16 minutes of it isn't a
[1:37:29] lot but uh let's just en let's just
[1:37:33] enjoy this this morning God bless you
[1:37:36] it's in the spoken word The Original
[1:37:39] Seed uh the message that came from uh
[1:37:43] spoken word uh the publishing company
[1:37:46] started on paragraph 118 thank you God
[1:37:49] bless you
[1:37:54] correctly that's why each generation has
[1:37:57] its own Revival it gets a chance at the
[1:38:00] word then they H read it instead of Tak
[1:38:02] it on they go somewhere else my
[1:38:07] mission and I believe that God has
[1:38:09] called me far I I have to say some
[1:38:12] personal things today because that's
[1:38:14] what I told you I do amen see to tell
[1:38:18] the
[1:38:19] world my Miss
[1:38:21] I believe to the Earth is what is to
[1:38:25] forerun the coming
[1:38:29] word see the coming word which is
[1:38:33] Christ and Christ in him has the
[1:38:35] Millennium and has everything right
[1:38:37] there because he is the
[1:38:39] word all right Jesus said in John
[1:38:45] 3:5 if you want to mark that down John
[1:38:48] 3:5 we all know it or either I turn
[1:38:51] maybe somebody on the tapes but might
[1:38:53] not be able to turn just at that time
[1:38:55] and I'll read here u in St John the
[1:38:59] third chapter and the fifth
[1:39:06] verse and we see what Jesus
[1:39:09] said we might start off just a little
[1:39:12] before that third Jesus answered and
[1:39:15] said unto him verily verely I say unto
[1:39:18] thee except the man be born
[1:39:21] again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:39:25] God Nicodemus said unto him how can a
[1:39:28] man be born when he is old can he enter
[1:39:31] the second time into his mother's womb
[1:39:33] and be born Jesus answered verily I say
[1:39:36] unto you and to thee except the man be
[1:39:40] born of water and of spirit he cannot
[1:39:44] enter into the kingdom of God is that a
[1:39:48] seed every spoken word of God is a seed
[1:39:51] seed that's right I'm going to prove
[1:39:53] that just in a minute where Jesus said
[1:39:55] so every spoken word of God is a seed
[1:39:58] then except a man be born again why must
[1:40:00] he be born again he's dead with the fion
[1:40:03] he in he's a
[1:40:06] h he's got to be born again why he was
[1:40:10] born in Sin from Eve sin shaped in
[1:40:13] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:40:15] he's a liar to begin with no matter how
[1:40:18] smart educated what more he is he's a
[1:40:20] liar
[1:40:21] the Bible says he is how holy his
[1:40:23] parents was or anything about he's a
[1:40:25] liar to begin with and the only way he
[1:40:28] can tell truth is say what truth is
[1:40:30] through his own lips that's the only way
[1:40:31] truth can come anything contrary to that
[1:40:34] word he's a liar
[1:40:37] yet that's pretty flat but that's what
[1:40:40] God
[1:40:41] Said let every man's word be a lie and
[1:40:44] mine be true amen anything that comes
[1:40:47] from his lips contrary to deny this word
[1:40:49] or put it in some other race or some
[1:40:51] other generation or whatever it is he's
[1:40:54] a
[1:40:55] liar it's exactly he's got to be born
[1:40:58] again then he sees every word the only
[1:41:00] way you can be born again is that life
[1:41:02] of God in him to produce that
[1:41:05] life a seed must have water to
[1:41:09] grow now you put a seed in the ground if
[1:41:12] there's no moisture in the ground it's
[1:41:13] dust and it won't grow in the dust can't
[1:41:16] it's got to have a certain percent of
[1:41:18] moisture or it won't grow is that right
[1:41:21] yes the letter kth the spirit giveth it
[1:41:25] life now it must have morer to grow his
[1:41:30] word is a seed now to prove that let's
[1:41:33] turn to Luke the 8th chapter the 11th
[1:41:36] verse and see if this is true or not if
[1:41:39] if the Bible says his word is the SE
[1:41:41] Luke the 11th chapter or the eth chapter
[1:41:44] rather and the 11th
[1:41:46] verse and we'll see what God said about
[1:41:49] it
[1:41:52] 8th chapter 11th
[1:41:55] verse now he goes ahead and begins to
[1:41:57] tell there much things to say by let's
[1:41:59] start the fourth this read and when much
[1:42:01] people were gathered together and there
[1:42:04] come unto him out of every city he spake
[1:42:07] by Parables a soar went out to seow his
[1:42:11] seed to seow his seow his seed and as he
[1:42:17] solded some fell by the wayside and it
[1:42:20] was trotten down and the fouls of the
[1:42:23] air divided it and some fell upon Rock
[1:42:27] and soon as it was sprung up it withered
[1:42:31] away because it lacked
[1:42:34] moisture
[1:42:36] moisture Baptists Presbyterians
[1:42:39] lutherans without the
[1:42:42] water and when he's first converted he
[1:42:45] looks right straight to Christ he
[1:42:46] believes and the first thing you know
[1:42:48] that denomination binds him up into a
[1:42:50] place and the marster of the spirit's
[1:42:52] gone from him he becomes denominational
[1:42:54] and he's dead not only Baptist but
[1:42:57] Pentecost don't believe that I know many
[1:42:59] of you don't but you just wait a little
[1:43:00] bit we see where the Bible
[1:43:04] States all right of like of moisture the
[1:43:07] last word in the sixth verse of the
[1:43:09] eighth chapter the like of moisture and
[1:43:13] some fell among thorns and sprang up
[1:43:16] with it and choked it see what was that
[1:43:19] he goes ahead and tells that's some as
[1:43:21] soon as they get to be I'm not going to
[1:43:23] pull one punch today on nothing amen
[1:43:26] amen just what I think the Christian
[1:43:28] businessman and the rest of them are
[1:43:29] these Pentecostal organizations and
[1:43:31] these people is building all these big
[1:43:32] millions of dollars of things the
[1:43:34] richest of the world has choked out the
[1:43:36] glory and spirit of
[1:43:38] God dying because it's choked the world
[1:43:42] care of the world has choked them out
[1:43:44] the women wants to be active and Bob off
[1:43:46] their hair and have Waterhead haircuts
[1:43:48] wear shorts and look like the rest of
[1:43:50] the world world the preacher standing in
[1:43:52] a pull pit with practice their all mans
[1:43:54] and Afraid of the word of God because of
[1:43:56] a meal
[1:43:57] ticket if they can't ride a Cadillac and
[1:44:00] they're not even considered spiritual
[1:44:02] anymore that's right if they can't
[1:44:04] breast the best of clothes and do
[1:44:06] everything else they're they're
[1:44:07] considered they're backslid they're not
[1:44:08] so and so an old man back there old
[1:44:10] brother kid told me this morning they
[1:44:11] don't want him no more because he's old
[1:44:14] he stays right with the word what's the
[1:44:15] matter they like
[1:44:18] marst all right and fell on and others
[1:44:21] fell on good ground and sprang up and
[1:44:24] bear
[1:44:25] fruit when he had said these things he
[1:44:29] cried he that has an ear to hear Let Him
[1:44:34] hear oh what a parable how I could like
[1:44:38] to preach a text on that now Ser
[1:44:41] Hallelujah when he had said these things
[1:44:43] the eth chapter 8th verse eth chapter
[1:44:46] others fell on good ground and sprang up
[1:44:49] and bear fruit on 100 fold and when he
[1:44:52] had said these things he
[1:44:54] cried screamed out something maybe like
[1:44:58] this when he said oh bring forth 100
[1:45:00] fold
[1:45:02] he that has an ear let him
[1:45:05] here other words if your ears in tune
[1:45:07] with God let him hear see his disciples
[1:45:11] asked him
[1:45:12] saying what might this Parable be and he
[1:45:15] said unto you it is given to know the
[1:45:19] mysteries of the kingdom the mystery see
[1:45:22] what he's talking about here now watch
[1:45:23] what is the mysteries of the Kingdom
[1:45:24] watch this Mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:45:26] God but to others in Parables that
[1:45:30] seeing they might see might not see and
[1:45:35] hearing they might not understand see
[1:45:38] but God's word comes right on down to
[1:45:40] the Judgment the judge them because they
[1:45:42] did
[1:45:43] see was
[1:45:45] there now the parable is this the seed
[1:45:51] is the word of
[1:45:54] God
[1:45:55] Hall what is the seed of life the word
[1:45:59] of
[1:46:00] God therefore for life you can't come to
[1:46:03] a Creed you can't come to a denomination
[1:46:05] you got to come back to the
[1:46:07] word now the seed of life all right his
[1:46:12] word is his seed and his spirit is the
[1:46:16] water now right back to John 3:14 there
[1:46:19] you get it again see
[1:46:21] see the
[1:46:24] spiritless is the water now
[1:46:28] look John 3:14 we understand what it
[1:46:31] means you want to read
[1:46:33] it as Moses lifted up the brast serpent
[1:46:36] in the
[1:46:37] wilderness so must the son of man be
[1:46:39] lifted up see now if Moses lifted up the
[1:46:44] brass serpent for the same cause Christ
[1:46:48] was lifted up amen now what is it Moses
[1:46:52] lifted up the brass serpent so that the
[1:46:55] people that was
[1:46:57] perishing might have water for Life am
[1:47:03] look
[1:47:05] Jesus oh God Jesus is the word of God
[1:47:12] Amen now we're going to hammer that down
[1:47:14] this afternoon see prove it Jesus is the
[1:47:18] word of God and he was bursted open that
[1:47:24] life the life is inside the
[1:47:29] seed that this life which is
[1:47:32] Spirit water flowing over the spirit
[1:47:36] over the seed of God will bring forth
[1:47:39] the life of the
[1:47:41] seed and if it brings forth something
[1:47:43] else they some other kind of seed there
[1:47:46] then
[1:47:49] amen
[1:47:50] do you
[1:47:52] understand if the spirit of God comes
[1:47:55] forth to water the
[1:47:58] seed if it's the seed it's watering
[1:48:01] it'll produce the life of the
[1:48:06] seed that
[1:48:08] clear produce the life of the seed well
[1:48:12] that's why it's SK for I believe the
[1:48:14] Bible is a is the word the whole truth
[1:48:18] and Jesus is the word made made manifest
[1:48:22] he and his word is one and the
[1:48:26] same what was he now look he was that
[1:48:34] seed I got to hold something back in
[1:48:36] order to get in here this evening you
[1:48:38] see it's hard amen he was that seed that
[1:48:42] Eve should have
[1:48:48] produced you you get it
[1:48:51] he was the seed that e was produce but
[1:48:54] she H it
[1:48:57] amen by disbelieving God's
[1:49:03] word so he was that seed and the only
[1:49:06] way that life could be uh in the
[1:49:08] reproduction of life life had to come
[1:49:11] through that seed and that seed had to
[1:49:13] die in order to spread out the
[1:49:16] life can't you see it that's why the
[1:49:19] water was given to water the
[1:49:23] seed
[1:49:25] am the holy spirit that was in the
[1:49:28] Garden of
[1:49:29] Eden was to water of the
[1:49:32] seed man wasn't made to die he's made to
[1:49:36] live but High breeding brought life of
[1:49:39] death rather she hbr now you deny the
[1:49:43] ccum
[1:49:46] seed then I'll ask you why what's these
[1:49:48] funeral services about
[1:49:53] she's
[1:49:56] hybrid every one of us
[1:49:58] are hybrid from the original that's
[1:50:02] where you're constantly
[1:50:03] dying but oh God there's a germ of life
[1:50:08] come from the real seed that God proved
[1:50:11] it was the seed he rose him up
[1:50:16] again that through that life that's
[1:50:19] going over the seed life was given to
[1:50:21] Eve over his real church is bringing
[1:50:23] forth life
[1:50:26] again through the birth through the womb
[1:50:28] of his
[1:50:30] bride oh it's rich and
[1:50:35] glorious hu I give a little time to
[1:50:37] study Hallelujah so it'll sink in he is
[1:50:40] that seed he is that seed that was
[1:50:44] produced by the word of God be it unto
[1:50:48] me Lord according to th word
[1:50:51] there's the
[1:50:52] seat taking the
[1:50:58] word see
[1:51:02] now Jesus is the
[1:51:05] word made
[1:51:07] manifest he
[1:51:09] and the word is one and the same and
[1:51:13] that's why it was
[1:51:17] so made manifest in him so perfectly
[1:51:22] that's the reason that God manifested
[1:51:24] himself so per perfectly in Jesus
[1:51:27] because he was the seed
[1:51:31] word The Germ word itself The Germ
[1:51:34] that's inside the seed that's the life
[1:51:36] in the
[1:51:38] seed you get
[1:51:40] it it was a he was The Germ word of God
[1:51:45] the germ is the spirit The Germ is the
[1:51:48] water and Jesus had to be broken open
[1:51:51] there in order for that seed to let
[1:51:54] forth its life to water other seed that
[1:51:57] was
[1:52:02] coming Hallelujah do you see even he
[1:52:06] said of sheep I it's not of even of this
[1:52:08] fold I have they're going to see that
[1:52:10] they're going to get that word and stay
[1:52:12] right with it and I'm sending forth the
[1:52:14] spirit to water it and it'll produce
[1:52:17] just
[1:52:18] exactly it'll produce Miracles it'll
[1:52:20] produce the power of God it'll produce
[1:52:22] and it will not deny anything because
[1:52:24] it's a kindered seed with the
[1:52:27] seed it can't say Mr cerer you come live
[1:52:30] with me no no sir no no it won't do it
[1:52:35] no indeed it just won't
[1:52:38] mix can't mix death and life you can't
[1:52:40] be dead and alive at the same
[1:52:43] time
[1:52:44] so you see what I mean it is the germ
[1:52:48] that come from the seed he is he's the
[1:52:52] word of God made perfectly manifest
[1:52:54] that's the reason that in him was what
[1:52:59] that was the thing that he is correctly
[1:53:02] the son from the first Adam was the son
[1:53:07] that was promised through Adam
[1:53:09] continuing on the human race and Eve
[1:53:11] hbrd to The Serpent and brought forth a
[1:53:14] generation of bastard children born to
[1:53:17] death without life and Jesus come and
[1:53:20] was that
[1:53:22] seed he proved it everything that Adam
[1:53:25] lost Jesus was
[1:53:28] amen see he is the C Eve would have
[1:53:33] finally brought that child forth but you
[1:53:36] high read it brought the serpent in
[1:53:40] listening for wisdom understanding
[1:53:43] knowledge I'll wait till we get into the
[1:53:45] bride with
[1:53:48] that that's what's that's the reason I
[1:53:50] believe what I believe it's got to come
[1:53:52] back to this word that's the reason I
[1:53:54] say if somebody wants to to discuss with
[1:53:56] me talk to me about this word come
[1:53:59] that's right I've offered that anytime
[1:54:02] if you think that the name of Jesus
[1:54:04] Christ isn't the right way to baptize
[1:54:05] come talk to me about
[1:54:07] it if you don't believe there is such a
[1:54:09] thing as serpent seed you come see me
[1:54:11] let's just take the
[1:54:13] word if you don't believe that women
[1:54:15] should have long hair and that's their
[1:54:16] covering come talk to me about it with a
[1:54:18] word
[1:54:20] if you don't believe that the end of the
[1:54:22] time is at hand and these things I'm
[1:54:23] talking about is come talk to me about
[1:54:25] it come with me brother seed just come
[1:54:29] on right you can't be a seed and
[1:54:32] disagree with the word because the word
[1:54:33] is a seed and if you are the word how
[1:54:36] can you disagree with you'd be disagree
[1:54:37] with
[1:54:38] yourself you'd be defeating your own
[1:54:42] purpose like somebody said what would
[1:54:44] you why do you ever go out with them
[1:54:46] people like that well if I didn't do it
[1:54:48] I'd be defeated you very purpose I a sa
[1:54:50] here
[1:54:52] for there's got to be a
[1:54:58] light how many believe there will be
[1:55:00] light in the evening time there's got to
[1:55:03] be a
[1:55:04] light amen there's got to be uh
[1:55:08] something that shines on we're not going
[1:55:10] to be long but you have to understand
[1:55:12] what what we're wanting uh each of you
[1:55:16] to understand is not to look at the
[1:55:18] outside
[1:55:20] but the look at the inside and and let's
[1:55:23] listen let's read that last statement
[1:55:24] we'll read a couple more statements
[1:55:26] we'll move right on he said you can't be
[1:55:30] a seed and disagree with the
[1:55:34] word
[1:55:36] now we always look to the
[1:55:39] disagreer but take that for
[1:55:42] yourself that's right it's
[1:55:45] impossible for you if you have the SE
[1:55:49] seed now you didn't choose to plant the
[1:55:51] seed God chose that for you so it
[1:55:55] doesn't matter where he planted it you
[1:55:58] know whatever ground he planted it in
[1:56:00] you were the ground and he planted the
[1:56:03] seed in you you're coming along in life
[1:56:05] no matter where you are and you hear the
[1:56:08] word of God and you you just can't
[1:56:12] disagree with it that's right now you
[1:56:15] can fight the
[1:56:18] results that the word is trying to
[1:56:23] produce right I mean you can you can
[1:56:25] withstand it you can fight it but that's
[1:56:29] what he told Paul oh it's hard to kick
[1:56:31] against the prick Paul Lord who art you
[1:56:35] Paul I've come to show you the many
[1:56:37] things you might suffer for my sake
[1:56:39] because I've chosen you to bring the
[1:56:42] gospel to the
[1:56:44] Gentiles okay so Paul's writing on look
[1:56:46] at Paul's condition man he's a Sadducees
[1:56:49] a Pharisees of this studied under Gia
[1:56:52] he's out riding his horse he's going to
[1:56:55] get turned over you may be the same way
[1:57:00] you may have been going about this you
[1:57:01] had your career you had this idea and
[1:57:04] all of a sudden the light The
[1:57:07] Germ of the
[1:57:09] seed spoke to your
[1:57:13] heart and you might have said whoa
[1:57:16] that's true and you might try to resist
[1:57:20] it you might trying to fight it you know
[1:57:22] you're battling with your flesh you're
[1:57:23] drawing off the lust of the flesh you
[1:57:26] got habits you got all these things
[1:57:28] pulling at you Satan's just trying to
[1:57:30] put every hook on you to to keep you but
[1:57:34] you've got what something inside of
[1:57:40] you something that's starting to be
[1:57:43] quickened and you can't deny
[1:57:46] it that's true that's true I know it's
[1:57:50] true I don't want to let nobody else
[1:57:52] know I know it's true you know what I
[1:57:55] mean but you know pretty soon you can't
[1:57:57] even keep that light under a bush your
[1:57:59] basket it'll just automatically start
[1:58:03] showing out of you you know pretty soon
[1:58:06] you know you might smoke and and and
[1:58:09] everybody might smoke and you've been
[1:58:11] buming cigarettes and people have been
[1:58:13] buming cigarettes all of a sudden you
[1:58:15] hear that
[1:58:18] word remember remember it's in seed
[1:58:21] form I like what Billy Paul used to say
[1:58:24] he said I never caught a fish that was
[1:58:26] already cleaned in
[1:58:29] cook you know and God goes to scale in
[1:58:33] you yeah amen you know that fish have
[1:58:36] scales right okay and and he goes to
[1:58:39] working on you and he goes to taking you
[1:58:41] from this trouble to that trouble and
[1:58:43] you get in in in in trouble I was kind
[1:58:47] of looking at Matt gritting cuz I know
[1:58:49] know some of his testimony and all that
[1:58:51] Heidi did did for him to get him out of
[1:58:54] trouble and stuff and and it it's it's a
[1:58:57] path it's a journey it's a
[1:59:00] growth but the first thing you know
[1:59:03] there's something inside of you that
[1:59:05] said
[1:59:08] amen now how quicker could you grow if
[1:59:12] you quit looking at the outside and look
[1:59:15] at the in the Amen in you if you if you
[1:59:20] if you could connect with that that that
[1:59:24] part of you that says Amen to every word
[1:59:27] of
[1:59:28] God it didn't ask you to say whether
[1:59:31] you're guilty or not guilty it just said
[1:59:35] you cannot deny the word of God the seed
[1:59:40] cannot deny the word of God if that seed
[1:59:44] is in you you cannot deny the word of
[1:59:47] God that is not given in a negative
[1:59:50] context that's given in a positive
[1:59:53] context to every believer so they will
[1:59:56] know they have something to believe in
[1:59:59] they can sit there and say despite
[2:00:02] myself there's something in me that says
[2:00:05] Amen to every word of God and that word
[2:00:08] is going to transform me from what I am
[2:00:12] to what God wants me to
[2:00:18] be it's been struck that's
[2:00:21] right Paul didn't even know what struck
[2:00:24] him he was a scholar so he went out on
[2:00:27] the backside of the desert poured
[2:00:29] through the scriptures year after year
[2:00:32] after year until he
[2:00:36] understood that Jesus was the word he
[2:00:39] was the Old Testament that that that
[2:00:43] they were one and then he could PR write
[2:00:46] the book of
[2:00:48] Hebrews to say Jesus Christ is the same
[2:00:51] yesterday today and forever amen so each
[2:00:54] one of
[2:00:56] you know that about
[2:00:59] yourself when I heard the word something
[2:01:02] inside of me said that's true I could
[2:01:05] not deny
[2:01:08] it that's what he wants us to start
[2:01:11] coming
[2:01:12] to that he said now listen he says with
[2:01:16] the word and if you are the word
[2:01:20] how can you disagree with
[2:01:24] it you'd
[2:01:27] be uh disagreeing with
[2:01:33] yourself you'd be defeating your own
[2:01:39] purpose oh my goodness think of that
[2:01:42] that's a wonderful
[2:01:44] statement I've been disagreeing with
[2:01:46] myself a
[2:01:48] lot
[2:01:51] yes the arguments with
[2:01:54] me I'm arguing with myself the word of
[2:01:57] God in Me saying this is the truth this
[2:02:00] is right well that's the truth and I'm
[2:02:03] sitting here I don't want to do that I
[2:02:06] you know surely I can work a way around
[2:02:09] this I'm arguing with myself I'm
[2:02:12] defeating my own
[2:02:14] purpose my own purpose is for that seed
[2:02:17] to grow in me amen and to become what he
[2:02:20] wants me to keep and therefore we have
[2:02:22] the great battle of the mind and the
[2:02:25] great battle of the
[2:02:27] flesh the battle's on the
[2:02:31] outside life is on the
[2:02:35] inside have confidence that you know
[2:02:38] it's
[2:02:39] true you know it's true let's just read
[2:02:42] back in and and look at some of the most
[2:02:45] beautiful
[2:02:46] statements that he says
[2:02:49] he
[2:02:50] said he
[2:02:53] says he says let every man's word be a
[2:02:56] lie and mine be
[2:02:59] truth if any thing that comes from his
[2:03:04] lips
[2:03:06] contrary to deny this word or put it in
[2:03:10] some other race or some
[2:03:14] other generation or whatever it is he's
[2:03:20] liar now listen he says that's exactly
[2:03:24] he's got to be born again then he then
[2:03:33] he sees every word and the only way he
[2:03:37] can be born again is that life of God in
[2:03:42] him to produce that life the only way
[2:03:46] you can be born again if that life life
[2:03:49] of God is in you to produce that life
[2:03:52] the people that are born again are the
[2:03:54] seed of God now the rain falls on the
[2:03:58] just and the unjust praise God what do
[2:04:00] we do when the rain comes we rejoice
[2:04:03] when the presence of the Lord sweeps
[2:04:06] through we Rejoice you ought to Rejoice
[2:04:09] you ought to be happy you ought to raise
[2:04:11] your hands you ought to praise
[2:04:15] God that's all that's
[2:04:17] wonderful
[2:04:20] and there's people that that that
[2:04:23] manifest the gifts of the Spirit in
[2:04:25] everything but the only thing that can
[2:04:27] be born again is the seed of
[2:04:30] God that's right you understand so we're
[2:04:34] not talking about a spiritual experience
[2:04:37] we're not talking about emotional
[2:04:39] experience we're talking about a seed
[2:04:44] that God planted coming to life we're
[2:04:48] talking about his kinship your kin to
[2:04:53] the seed your seed kin amen he was a
[2:04:57] what Redeemer a kinsman
[2:05:00] redeemer he didn't just come to redeem
[2:05:05] Israel he put them on
[2:05:10] pause
[2:05:11] right I I don't want to I maybe hate to
[2:05:14] use this terminology but he was dealing
[2:05:17] with Israel and all was sudden he
[2:05:19] pressed the
[2:05:20] clicker or he pressed the button and he
[2:05:23] put him on pause and he said now I got
[2:05:26] to go over and get my Gentile
[2:05:30] seed and he dropped in to start dealing
[2:05:33] with the Gentile seed to get them from
[2:05:35] every generation to get them from every
[2:05:37] Revival to pull them up to T start his
[2:05:40] life and then bring his life all the way
[2:05:43] up until he got to the back the final
[2:05:47] age where the seed would reproduce
[2:05:49] itself again and the bridegroom and the
[2:05:51] bride would become one Hallelujah and
[2:05:54] then when that's accomplished and he
[2:05:57] does the Harvest and he harvests that
[2:06:00] out there he presses the button again
[2:06:03] and picks up
[2:06:08] Israel I can't explain everything God's
[2:06:11] going to do with
[2:06:12] Israel but I know one thing for
[2:06:16] sure he's going to deal with all those
[2:06:19] that are his and now he's dealing with
[2:06:21] his and you're beautiful to live in this
[2:06:24] day he said a seed must have water to
[2:06:28] grow now you put a seed in the ground
[2:06:32] and there's no moisture in the ground
[2:06:34] it's dust it won't grow in the dust it
[2:06:38] can't it's got to have a certain percent
[2:06:42] of moisture to grow that's right the
[2:06:45] letter
[2:06:47] kth
[2:06:50] the letter
[2:06:51] kth and that's and if if the letter
[2:06:56] kills let me say this to you the letter
[2:06:59] of the message can kill
[2:07:04] also because the reason the letter kth
[2:07:09] because it's the they take the message
[2:07:12] they take the word they take the Bible
[2:07:14] or whatever and they work it according
[2:07:17] to their own
[2:07:20] thinking and that's why let me say this
[2:07:23] when the when when the gospel's
[2:07:27] preached and and and we come to the end
[2:07:30] of the
[2:07:31] service that's the time that you ask God
[2:07:35] to bring
[2:07:36] moisture to what you've
[2:07:39] heard to to bring the spirit of what you
[2:07:43] heard into your heart into your life to
[2:07:47] let it drop down down from your mind
[2:07:51] into your heart where it becomes the
[2:07:53] will of God let it drop down from your
[2:07:56] mind to your heart to your
[2:07:58] spirit to where you become one with it
[2:08:02] where he makes the life of what's been
[2:08:05] spoken come to you don't leave it in
[2:08:08] your mind let it come into your heart
[2:08:12] let it come into your life till you feel
[2:08:14] the if I could use the word the
[2:08:16] anointing of it the presence of it the
[2:08:19] revelation of it until you make contact
[2:08:23] with the person that spoke
[2:08:27] it there's no evidence of
[2:08:34] that you know him amen you know when
[2:08:39] he's near you that's right you know when
[2:08:42] he's
[2:08:43] here I love it when our messenger would
[2:08:46] say you feel something don't you a real
[2:08:48] warm spirit all over you that's
[2:08:55] him that's the mo the
[2:08:59] moisture that's the moisture you need
[2:09:02] for what you hear don't just leave it in
[2:09:05] the
[2:09:07] intellect just don't leave it say I
[2:09:09] agree with it and that's the truth and
[2:09:11] that's what I believe but there's a
[2:09:14] life attached with it there's a life
[2:09:18] attached with the word that life is the
[2:09:21] spirit that was the life of it that was
[2:09:24] The Germ of it and and that's what you
[2:09:27] that's what we want to make contact with
[2:09:29] is the reason that it was spoken the
[2:09:32] purpose that it was spoken and you sit
[2:09:34] in the presence of God and you let that
[2:09:37] purpose come to you you let him deal
[2:09:39] with your heart and you know what you'll
[2:09:41] find yourself you'll find tears rolling
[2:09:43] down your cheek you'll be sprays in your
[2:09:46] hand saying thank you God thank you Lord
[2:09:49] you'll find answers to problems you've
[2:09:52] had things will open up to you all of a
[2:09:55] sudden the weight you had just starts
[2:09:56] getting lifted and you know everything's
[2:10:01] okay because he came
[2:10:06] by but if you never sit in his
[2:10:09] presence you never take the moisture and
[2:10:14] you just take the letter of
[2:10:16] it I believe it
[2:10:19] go beyond what you believe go on for the
[2:10:24] purpose sit there a moment and argue
[2:10:26] with
[2:10:29] yourself until you're willing to say I'm
[2:10:31] going to accept this I'm going to
[2:10:33] believe it I'm going to change my
[2:10:36] attitude I'm going to change my heart
[2:10:38] Speak to My Heart Lord come let me feel
[2:10:40] your
[2:10:44] presence you know we think that it is so
[2:10:49] it's the word but
[2:10:51] remember it it's a beautiful thing what
[2:10:54] he says he says now the word is a
[2:10:59] seed now to prove that let's read in
[2:11:02] Luke so he goes out and he says the
[2:11:05] words of seed so God planted the
[2:11:09] seed so you understand that he's planted
[2:11:12] the
[2:11:13] seed it's in
[2:11:15] you that's why you may AE amen every
[2:11:19] word of
[2:11:21] God so it's not just me sitting up here
[2:11:23] and saying do you believe the word of
[2:11:25] God you believe what brother brandom
[2:11:27] said but that I want you to get the
[2:11:29] moisture of God's word the the the
[2:11:33] attitude of it the spirit of it the
[2:11:36] nature of it the love of
[2:11:39] it that's what we got to call that's
[2:11:42] what we got to ask for that Lord Let It
[2:11:45] Rain that's why the prophet of God said
[2:11:48] what they thought was the latter rain
[2:11:51] was
[2:11:52] not it was just an unrighteous partaking
[2:11:56] of spiritual gifts because the latter
[2:11:59] rain couldn't come until the teaching
[2:12:01] rain the prophetic rain came
[2:12:05] first because you've got to get the
[2:12:08] moisture of the
[2:12:11] word so the spirit and Truth he says I
[2:12:14] work I I seek those to worship me in
[2:12:18] spirit and in truth and in word and the
[2:12:22] spirit of the word that's what he's
[2:12:25] looking for he's looking for people not
[2:12:28] just to have an intellectual conception
[2:12:31] yes you have to get an intellectual
[2:12:33] conception yes has got to start in your
[2:12:35] mind but you sit there and let it drop
[2:12:37] from your mind into your heart
[2:12:41] Hallelujah and you let the life of the
[2:12:44] word change
[2:12:47] you
[2:12:48] and if you repent of things you repent
[2:12:51] he's just Sten faithful to forgive you
[2:12:55] am but Jesus was that seed right he was
[2:12:59] the seed and the
[2:13:01] spirit
[2:13:03] together he was the life of the word the
[2:13:06] seed of the word what did he call it the
[2:13:09] The Germ yes of the word that's why the
[2:13:14] first Adam was what a living soul but
[2:13:18] the second Adam was a what a quickening
[2:13:23] spirit that's right that what we got to
[2:13:26] have we got to have that word quickened
[2:13:28] to
[2:13:31] us we're not going to get by without
[2:13:36] moisture I'm not talking about a
[2:13:38] Pentecostal
[2:13:39] experience Paul said you know if we
[2:13:43] speak in tongues all these things we'll
[2:13:45] do if God permits but let us just move
[2:13:48] on to
[2:13:51] Perfection so how many believe there's a
[2:13:53] life in the word
[2:13:56] amen that's what we want we want the
[2:13:59] life that's in the word why did you
[2:14:04] speak this to us Lord Jesus through your
[2:14:07] messenger what was it that he's trying
[2:14:09] to get to me Lord give me
[2:14:12] Revelation I'm going to pray for
[2:14:14] Revelation what is revelation revelation
[2:14:18] is the moisture that strikes what you've
[2:14:21] heard to make it real to you amen that
[2:14:25] you can have
[2:14:26] faith yes else you're battling Theology
[2:14:30] and Doctrine and what this man says and
[2:14:33] what that man says in this teaching and
[2:14:35] that teaching and you're Forever
[2:14:37] Learning never coming to the realization
[2:14:40] of the truth but if you'll ever get into
[2:14:42] the spirit of the word the moisture of
[2:14:44] the word it settles it and then you can
[2:14:48] say I can't explain it but God said
[2:14:53] so and it becomes
[2:14:56] beautiful and he he makes this great
[2:14:59] beautiful
[2:15:00] statement what is the seed of
[2:15:04] lifeu it's the word of
[2:15:08] God so so
[2:15:12] life is a
[2:15:15] fruit that's right of the word
[2:15:20] so what is the
[2:15:22] seed that brings life what is an
[2:15:26] apple seed
[2:15:29] bring
[2:15:31] Apples right so the the life the seed of
[2:15:38] the
[2:15:39] apple is the apple seed the seed of the
[2:15:45] fruit was the apple seed so the the
[2:15:50] seed what is the seed of life what has
[2:15:55] to be planted in order for Life to
[2:16:01] Come what is the seed of life what is
[2:16:05] the seed of Glory what is the seed of
[2:16:09] the of the presence of
[2:16:11] God what is it that God has to plant in
[2:16:16] order to produce spirit ual life it's
[2:16:19] the word you can't bypass the word and
[2:16:22] get an experience that's
[2:16:26] hybrid but you can't have the word
[2:16:28] without the fruit of the
[2:16:32] spirit cuz it's
[2:16:37] lifeless we want
[2:16:40] life we want eternal life we want life
[2:16:44] we want to be fruitful we want to grow
[2:16:47] in his presence
[2:16:48] we want to make the rapture start with
[2:16:50] the
[2:16:52] word
[2:16:54] hallu the word is the seed of life it's
[2:16:59] what God planted to bring forth life
[2:17:02] when our messenger preached this message
[2:17:05] he wasn't preaching doctrines and Creeds
[2:17:08] he was revealing a Life of
[2:17:12] Christ it was the revelation of Christ
[2:17:14] it was a life he was talking about
[2:17:18] and there was only one thing that was
[2:17:20] going to produce that original life and
[2:17:23] that was the original
[2:17:26] word and that's the way of the true
[2:17:29] Prophet to speak the original
[2:17:32] word so if you've got other voices in
[2:17:35] your
[2:17:37] life they have a
[2:17:41] fruit they have a life they have an
[2:17:45] attitude they have a thinking
[2:17:48] and they'll have
[2:17:50] fruits that's why Satan's the author of
[2:17:53] confusion that's why he's got so many
[2:17:56] voices and so many fingers poin in so
[2:17:58] many
[2:18:00] directions but every person in her this
[2:18:04] morning ought to know by the pillar of
[2:18:07] Fire by the
[2:18:10] cloud two of the
[2:18:12] same
[2:18:14] signs that he gave Israel when they left
[2:18:18] and their Exodus are the same size he
[2:18:21] gives the Gentiles for their
[2:18:25] Exodus you have the voice that's
[2:18:31] right I'm sure most of you are educated
[2:18:34] somebody taught you to
[2:18:36] read somebody taught you your
[2:18:39] job you know the Holy Spirit teaches you
[2:18:43] and guides you into all righteousness
[2:18:47] Amen in other words he speaks a word
[2:18:51] that word has a life that life goes out
[2:18:54] onto you Mo gives you moisture that you
[2:18:58] might come into what that life and seed
[2:19:02] is supposed to produce they don't work
[2:19:06] separate am they work hand in hand
[2:19:10] that's right if he gives you word he
[2:19:12] gives you life and spirit to go with
[2:19:16] it so don't
[2:19:18] ignore the second
[2:19:22] part remember we said it has two parts
[2:19:26] it's got the word it's got the betting
[2:19:29] ground so it had to have someplace to go
[2:19:33] now when that word quickened to you it
[2:19:36] and it gives you Revelation I want you
[2:19:39] to know there's life
[2:19:41] there the word was the seed to the life
[2:19:46] right

[2:19:52] seed but find the life of
[2:19:56] it wait in his presence sit in church a
[2:19:59] moment pray come early Lord I'm here for

[2:26:20] God and he was BR burst open that
[2:26:25] life the life is inside the seed who was

[2:26:32] seed right the life was in it he was the
[2:26:35] word he was the seed of God it was burst
[2:26:38] open that this
[2:26:41] life which
[2:26:43] is
[2:26:45] Spirit the this life which is Spirit
[2:26:50] don't get your idea that there's a life
[2:26:53] of the word and then there's the spirit
[2:26:56] there's a life of the word and there's
[2:26:58] some sort of extra baptism of the
[2:27:04] spirit the spirit comes in goost like
[2:27:07] the wind it comes upon you it moves not
[2:27:10] you rejoice you're in the spirit but
[2:27:12] that Spirit has a word that it's
[2:27:15] attached to
[2:27:18] the spirit does nothing in itself in
[2:27:21] fact it didn't even come to speak of
[2:27:24] itself but to bring us into remembrance
[2:27:26] of all things he said he are you saying
[2:27:29] brother McGary you tell me there's not a
[2:27:32] baptism holy spirit let me tell you what
[2:27:34] most people have they have an
[2:27:36] intellectual understanding of Christ and
[2:27:39] when that leaves the
[2:27:42] intellectual and they really come in
[2:27:45] contact with the light
[2:27:47] life that life B burst them
[2:27:52] again you don't have to give an Evidence
[2:27:55] to it you know
[2:27:59] it you know you've been
[2:28:03] chained you may not be what you ought to
[2:28:06] be you may not be what you want to be
[2:28:08] but you know one thing you're not what
[2:28:10] you used to be some life some outside
[2:28:15] spirit the being of the word has made
[2:28:19] contact with your seed and it's going to
[2:28:22] produce
[2:28:27] life it's the life of the word is the
[2:28:31] spirit the spirit is the life that was
[2:28:34] in Christ returned to the
[2:28:40] church I will not leave you comfortless
[2:28:44] I will come again yeah and I'll be with
[2:28:48] you even in you till the
[2:28:51] end and I will send another
[2:28:57] comforter not a different person he was
[2:29:00] the comfort in the flesh now he was
[2:29:03] sending the comfort in the spirit
[2:29:06] amen and he'll lead you and guide you in
[2:29:11] all
[2:29:12] truth just a change of
[2:29:15] office the same
[2:29:17] person the same word the same Creator
[2:29:21] all Heaven and Earth was created by the
[2:29:23] word the word was the original seed the
[2:29:27] life that was in the word is now burst
[2:29:31] out
[2:29:32] open over the church that it might bring
[2:29:37] other seeds to life therefore he becomes
[2:29:41] a what a quickening spirit amen that's
[2:29:47] oh let's just finish up what he
[2:29:50] says he says the life which is
[2:29:54] Spirit
[2:29:56] water flowing
[2:29:58] over the spirit over the seed of God
[2:30:03] will bring
[2:30:04] forth the life of the
[2:30:10] seed it's the spirit that brings forth
[2:30:13] the life of the
[2:30:15] seed you can hear the word
[2:30:20] intellectually you understand that
[2:30:23] there's nothing wrong with
[2:30:26] that you've got to hear it
[2:30:29] first but he said hear he that have ear
[2:30:33] to hear Let Him hear what the
[2:30:38] spirit
[2:30:44] saith make contact
[2:30:47] with the moisture yes make contact with
[2:30:51] the spirit of the word make contact with
[2:30:55] the presence of the word make contact
[2:30:57] with the giver of the word make that
[2:31:02] personal you know it doesn't hurt to
[2:31:05] take a few hours out a day and get
[2:31:06] somewhere alone and pray it doesn't hurt
[2:31:11] you to sit in your car for a moment and
[2:31:13] be
[2:31:14] still the prophet of God described it he
[2:31:17] said i' get alone and I'd lean up
[2:31:19] against the tree and I just wait on the
[2:31:22] Lord and he said it would come w w w
[2:31:25] remember how he said it came like waves
[2:31:27] it would just come and all of a sudden
[2:31:29] he'd break
[2:31:31] through we call it praying through we
[2:31:34] call it breaking through we call it
[2:31:37] getting out of all the things of the
[2:31:39] flesh until you get into the
[2:31:42] presence the
[2:31:44] life of the word
[2:31:47] you're not going to have two
[2:31:49] experiences you're not going to have a
[2:31:51] word experience and a spirit experience
[2:31:54] because the word is the seed of
[2:32:00] life we want the life of the word the
[2:32:04] life of the word and that life of that
[2:32:08] word will
[2:32:10] cause all things to happen in your life
[2:32:15] all things are possible
[2:32:17] the life of the
[2:32:19] seed and if it brings forth something
[2:32:24] else there's something other kind of
[2:32:29] seed there
[2:32:33] then that's how the rain can fall on the
[2:32:36] just and the unjust if it brings
[2:32:39] something else other than the life and
[2:32:42] love of Christ there's some other seed
[2:32:45] there
[2:32:47] now I don't know who that
[2:32:52] is I'm not
[2:32:55] worried about
[2:32:58] that I'm worried about what seed is in
[2:33:02] me and when I hearing that word am I
[2:33:06] waiting on the
[2:33:08] moisture the life of what was spoken to
[2:33:12] make contact with me and cause a change
[2:33:16] in me and move me closer to what God had
[2:33:21] in mind for me to
[2:33:25] be I'm not worried about religion I'm
[2:33:28] not worried about church order I'm not
[2:33:31] worried about those things there's one
[2:33:34] thing that I I
[2:33:36] desire is that the word that's speaking
[2:33:39] in my heart the word that I'm hearing
[2:33:44] that the life of that word comes and Mo
[2:33:49] moistens and
[2:33:51] Waters my seed that it can bring forth
[2:33:56] the intended life of the seed that's
[2:34:02] planted that faith is already in you
[2:34:06] amen he that is in you is greater than
[2:34:12] he that is in the
[2:34:15] world
[2:34:18] it's got you this
[2:34:20] far and he said he'll not leave us nor
[2:34:23] forsake
[2:34:25] us and then he he goes he says amen do
[2:34:29] you understand if the spirit of God
[2:34:34] comes
[2:34:36] forth to water the
[2:34:39] seed if it's the seed it's watering
[2:34:44] it'll produce the life of the
[2:34:50] seed is that clear produce the life of
[2:34:54] the seed for that's what it's
[2:35:00] given
[2:35:05] for what's the Holy Spirit given for not
[2:35:10] a second person a
[2:35:14] office an administ
[2:35:16] ation what was it given for to bring
[2:35:21] forth the product of the
[2:35:24] seed that was
[2:35:29] planted now can you imagine the
[2:35:33] faith God is giving
[2:35:37] us something to believe
[2:35:40] in because faith has to have a final
[2:35:43] resting place it can't rest on on a
[2:35:47] promise that's sitting over
[2:35:53] here because the minute you try to rest
[2:35:57] on that somebody comes along and moves
[2:35:59] it over here and now it's got a
[2:36:02] different understanding now you're going
[2:36:04] to try to get it and boy somebody moves
[2:36:06] it over here and then it's over here and
[2:36:09] it's over
[2:36:13] here you're arguing with yourself
[2:36:18] it's in
[2:36:19] you the seeds in
[2:36:22] you he who's in
[2:36:25] you the very thing that's in you that
[2:36:28] heard the word that your heart
[2:36:30] recognized that's what he wants you to
[2:36:33] pray for that's what the spirit is for
[2:36:36] is to bring that word in you to
[2:36:39] life and and and I I'm just going to see
[2:36:44] if I can find this before
[2:36:49] I I close to see if I can find what he
[2:36:53] said
[2:36:56] here he he
[2:37:04] said exactly he says uh this is like in
[2:37:08] paragraph
[2:37:10] 145 then and and so uh and he he just
[2:37:16] says this Jesus
[2:37:19] had be broke open and for the water of
[2:37:22] the spirit and I think I just read the
[2:37:27] other he says Jesus had to be broken
[2:37:30] open there in order for the seed to let
[2:37:34] forth its life to water the other seeds
[2:37:38] that was to come and then he comes down
[2:37:40] here says you see it I mean it's the
[2:37:43] germ that comes from the the
[2:37:46] seed he is and the word of God made
[2:37:51] perfectly manifest for the
[2:37:54] reason that in
[2:37:57] him that was the thing he
[2:38:01] is correctly the son of the first Adam
[2:38:06] he was the promised Adam continued to
[2:38:10] continue on the human
[2:38:12] race and Eve hybrid it the serpent
[2:38:16] brought forth the generation of bastard
[2:38:19] children born to death and Jesus come
[2:38:23] was that seed he provided everything
[2:38:28] that Adam lost Jesus was he he was is
[2:38:33] correct Eve would have finally brought
[2:38:36] forth the CH the child forth but he
[2:38:39] hybrid it and brought forth the servant
[2:38:42] listen for wisdom and whatever and so if
[2:38:46] you go on it to read and I I I can't
[2:38:48] find it but the reason Jesus come was
[2:38:51] for the same
[2:38:54] purpose was that he would have
[2:38:57] Offspring that's
[2:39:01] right in other words Satan he he found
[2:39:05] his way into Eve defeated it now Jesus
[2:39:08] was the quickening spirit and that and
[2:39:11] we couldn't be brought back to our
[2:39:14] original condition to our original son
[2:39:17] and daughter ship we couldn't have been
[2:39:20] brought back to that by Creeds dogmas in
[2:39:24] or anything it had to be the Original
[2:39:27] Seed the original life striking the
[2:39:32] original seed to produce the original
[2:39:35] Sons and Daughters of God so if Eve
[2:39:38] would have brought forth that child
[2:39:43] anyway don't you think that you would
[2:39:46] have been brought forth
[2:39:51] anyway you would
[2:39:55] have but the program was
[2:39:59] interrupted so now he had to come and
[2:40:03] burst
[2:40:05] open and come germinate and bring life
[2:40:09] to the other seed oh my church we are so
[2:40:12] eternally
[2:40:14] secure
[2:40:17] amen we are so eternally secure the one
[2:40:21] thing God didn't leave in our hand was
[2:40:23] our our Eternal
[2:40:26] destination if you have eternal life you
[2:40:29] always had eternal
[2:40:32] life Lord revealed that to me let the
[2:40:36] life come manifest that in me and you
[2:40:39] can ask anything in my name he will give
[2:40:42] it lay down the past press for the
[2:40:46] higher calling take a moment to get into
[2:40:49] his
[2:40:50] presence and let the life of the Lord
[2:40:53] deal with you it life isn't what it
[2:41:00] seems It's
[2:41:03] hybrid it's a
[2:41:05] lie there's only one form of truth I am
[2:41:10] the way the truth the life no man
[2:41:16] comes unto the father but by me am I I
[2:41:20] hope that in my own humble way this
[2:41:24] morning that you can take
[2:41:29] courage and know that you're in the palm
[2:41:33] of his hand and nothing can pluck you
[2:41:36] out and if he started a work in you he
[2:41:39] will finish it and if Satan is trying to
[2:41:43] entice you with some some other life
[2:41:47] some other thinking some other way of
[2:41:50] living he's a liar am and there's no
[2:41:55] truth in
[2:41:56] them and the wages of
[2:41:59] unbelief is death but the gift of God is
[2:42:04] eternal life through Christ Jesus God
