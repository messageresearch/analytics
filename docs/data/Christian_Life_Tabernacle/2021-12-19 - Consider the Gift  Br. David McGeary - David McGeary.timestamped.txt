[41:26] recognize your
[41:28] coming into this world and
[41:31] father we know it's not really
[41:34] placed by man in its proper place
[41:38] we know it should be in the spring
[41:42] when the life is coming out of great
[41:46] wintry darkness and
[41:49] there's
[41:50] a springing forth
[41:52] and we just
[41:55] but man has taken this time and
[41:57] lord we want to hold your name in this
[42:00] season
[42:01] father that it's not totally blocked out
[42:04] and
[42:05] turned to
[42:08] total commercialism
[42:10] so father we stand here

[42:29] man god bless you may be seated
[42:31] this
[42:33] morning i was trying to see if i could
[42:36] this
[42:37] where's brother burly out is he with us
[42:39] tonight see where are you hiding brother
[42:41] you hiding somewhere
[42:44] you're not here
[42:46] brother where are you at
[42:48] oh well i was gonna have to say a few
[42:50] words so i guess i say a few words for
[42:53] him
[42:54] and
[42:56] anyway okay uh he must be resting uh
[42:59] just got back from africa and
[43:02] uh suffering with
[43:04] maybe some jet lag or some really
[43:07] wonderful uh
[43:08] romanian food
[43:10] so
[43:11] that could be a lot of reasons but we'll
[43:13] just go to the word of god then i was
[43:15] just
[43:16] looking forward to have a little uh the
[43:19] word of
[43:21] testimony or exhortation from them we
[43:24] we appreciate them so i thank you
[43:27] musicians didn't mean to
[43:29] keep you just a little a thought again
[43:32] tonight
[43:33] on this uh
[43:35] time
[43:36] of season and
[43:38] you know what kind of uh
[43:42] just
[43:43] stimulated my thought
[43:45] and it was uh
[43:47] you know this time being a year of gifts
[43:50] you know everybody wants to give
[43:53] a gift and
[43:57] we feel a lot of times obligated to give
[44:00] gifts because that
[44:02] we're
[44:03] going to receive a gift so you know our
[44:06] desire is that
[44:08] that
[44:09] we give a gift or we take this time
[44:12] to give a gift well
[44:14] i remember i decided one year that
[44:18] our car was
[44:20] pretty wore out and
[44:22] uh i wanted to get leslie uh
[44:25] a new car so
[44:27] i i got her a car it wasn't for
[44:29] christmas
[44:30] i believe it was for her birthday
[44:33] and so we we got a vehicle you know how
[44:35] it is like when you really need
[44:37] something you can use a date as a reason
[44:40] to kill two birds
[44:42] with one stone you know so we were gonna
[44:46] have to get a car anyway so we might as
[44:48] well get a car that acts as a gift you
[44:51] know
[44:52] and so we had the car for about two
[44:54] years i know i've told you this story
[44:56] before but well then i thought well what
[44:58] am i going to get leslie this year and i
[45:00] thought well what i'll do is i'll put
[45:03] remote start
[45:06] on her car
[45:07] you know and that'll be a blessing she
[45:09] could start it up in the parking lot
[45:12] before she goes out to it and she can
[45:15] start it up you know in the
[45:17] at home and get it all warmed up and i
[45:20] thought that'd just be a great gift so
[45:22] i i remember aaron was there and so i
[45:25] said aaron i said i want to
[45:27] put
[45:28] remote start on
[45:30] mom's
[45:31] car for for
[45:33] um
[45:35] this
[45:36] i don't know if it was christmas or
[45:37] something
[45:38] and he said well
[45:40] it's already got it
[45:42] it it
[45:43] came with the gift
[45:46] and a lot of times we don't realize
[45:49] everything that comes with the gift
[45:52] all that's included
[45:54] in a gift you know i i was
[45:57] listening to the radio and
[46:00] a commercial came on
[46:02] and it was for some sort of
[46:05] um
[46:08] bill
[46:11] app
[46:12] and it will it keeps
[46:15] track of all your bills and your
[46:18] prescriptions and subscriptions and you
[46:21] can cancel it at every time and i
[46:23] thought wow i'll get that app you know
[46:26] and then i thought well you know do i
[46:28] really want to buy an app that already
[46:31] knows what all my prescriptions and
[46:33] everything are
[46:34] and and they'll cancel them at any time
[46:36] and do all this stuff and then it kind
[46:38] of dawned on me
[46:40] it probably i have to probably load that
[46:42] stuff in there right
[46:43] and
[46:44] that ruins it
[46:46] you know it's like getting something you
[46:48] have to put together
[46:50] you know by the time you're done trying
[46:52] to put together you hope you never see
[46:54] it again
[46:55] you know so those those are the kind of
[46:58] things but you know we've got a gift
[47:00] that
[47:01] is pretty marvelous
[47:04] and uh so let's stand we just want to
[47:06] take not too many i didn't really have a
[47:09] lot of
[47:10] comments to make i was uh looking
[47:13] forward my brother to help me a little
[47:15] bit but
[47:17] it's okay so what we'll do is we'll just
[47:20] turn to uh
[47:22] matthew the second chapter
[47:26] and then over
[47:28] to matthew
[47:31] the fourth
[47:32] chapter and just uh read from the 14th
[47:36] verse there
[47:37] and just
[47:38] just have a little short time
[47:41] of fellowship
[47:44] and it says now when jesus was born
[47:48] in bethlehem matthew the second chapter
[47:52] now when jesus was born in bethlehem of
[47:56] judea
[47:57] in the days of herod
[48:00] the king
[48:01] behold there came wise men
[48:04] from the east to jerusalem
[48:07] saying
[48:08] where is he
[48:10] that is born king of the jews
[48:14] for we have seen his star in the east
[48:18] and are come to worship him
[48:22] amen uh what an acknowledgement of the
[48:25] true king amen
[48:28] and then over here again in the fourth
[48:30] chapter
[48:31] we'll
[48:33] read in the 14th verse
[48:36] and it says
[48:38] that it might be fulfilled which was
[48:40] spoken
[48:41] by elias the prophet saying
[48:45] in the land of zebelon
[48:49] and the land of nephilim
[48:52] by the way of the sea
[48:55] behold
[48:56] beyond jordan
[48:58] galilee the gentiles
[49:01] the people which sat in darkness
[49:04] saw great light
[49:06] and to them which sat in the regions and
[49:10] the shadows
[49:12] of death
[49:13] light is sprung up and from that time
[49:17] jesus began preaching
[49:20] and to say repent
[49:22] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand you
[49:26] may be seated
[49:31] you know what uh uh as as we uh talked
[49:34] this morning about the gift and as we've
[49:37] been reading out of the message that of
[49:40] god's provided
[49:42] place of worship
[49:44] we begin to see
[49:46] that
[49:48] how wonderful the gift of god
[49:51] truly is to us
[49:53] and what he gave us was it wasn't a
[49:56] history that he gave us but he gave us
[49:59] himself
[50:00] and he gave us his spirit now it's hard
[50:03] for us to believe that the same spirit
[50:06] that dwelt
[50:07] in the lord jesus can dwell in us
[50:10] because we have so what so much great
[50:13] conflict sometimes with ourselves as
[50:17] human beings
[50:18] because the flesh wars against the
[50:21] spirit and the spirit against the flesh
[50:24] and and we were born in sin and shaped
[50:28] in iniquity and come into the world
[50:31] speaking lies
[50:33] and
[50:34] our very existence is is that
[50:37] man's
[50:38] days are numbered and there there are a
[50:41] few days with many trials and man isn't
[50:46] born with a life in him
[50:48] that can last
[50:51] and uh you know that is uh
[50:54] quite a sad thing you might say that uh
[50:58] that you're born but yet
[51:00] you start your life and you've got an
[51:02] allotted number
[51:04] of days to live that life and
[51:07] and you you wonder what what kind of
[51:11] world
[51:13] that
[51:14] you're born into
[51:16] and as you grow and as you have years
[51:20] on you you know uh we used to hear
[51:23] people talk about the good old days and
[51:26] and uh
[51:27] you you know uh
[51:29] if you're 8 9 10 12 years old or 15 or
[51:33] 16 years old what are the good old days
[51:36] to you when you didn't go to school
[51:40] you know i used to think in the fourth
[51:42] and fifth grade i flunk third grade i'm
[51:44] sorry to say that but
[51:47] i was the biggest kid in my class for
[51:49] one year
[51:50] and
[51:51] so i just said
[51:54] wow the good old days was when i
[51:56] i stayed home
[51:59] you know that was the good old days i
[52:00] didn't have to go to school
[52:02] i could get in trouble the only problem
[52:05] with the good old days was i got spanked
[52:07] a lot
[52:08] but you know
[52:09] but so everything is the good old days
[52:12] but
[52:13] you know there's nothing good about old
[52:15] days
[52:17] you know what i'm saying
[52:18] because
[52:20] all the day means is that
[52:22] you've lost one more of the days
[52:25] you have
[52:26] now wouldn't that be a sad thing to look
[52:29] at life
[52:30] like that
[52:32] that
[52:33] you just live
[52:34] a a season of time
[52:37] and then when you come to think of it
[52:39] that you're born
[52:41] into a world and
[52:43] and we look at this gift we have because
[52:45] as we said this morning the gift of god
[52:49] what he was really giving man
[52:52] whose days are numbered
[52:55] do you understand who's who's all's that
[52:58] he can he can have good times he can
[53:01] have
[53:03] seasons
[53:05] of joy
[53:06] he can have
[53:08] times of prosperity
[53:11] or
[53:11] and maybe periods of contentment
[53:15] but
[53:16] all in all
[53:18] all that he has
[53:19] to look forward to
[53:21] is to know
[53:23] that
[53:24] in time
[53:25] that his body is going to stoop
[53:28] it's going to begin to ache
[53:31] it's going to be easier to sit down than
[53:34] it is to get up
[53:37] food becomes less agreeable with you
[53:41] it has
[53:44] worse effects than it does good effects
[53:48] when you were young you eat and you got
[53:50] strong and now when you're older and you
[53:53] eat you get fatter and heartburn and
[53:58] indigestion and and everything else and
[54:01] you you know you get tired and
[54:04] and you know what what's the good old
[54:07] days
[54:08] you know and and and you look at this
[54:11] and you kind of sit in and you look at
[54:14] life and the more that you
[54:16] really look at what the gift of god is
[54:19] to you
[54:20] the the more you understand really what
[54:24] a wonderful thing that he gave us he
[54:27] gave us eternal life
[54:30] and the promise of a kingdom
[54:33] that wouldn't have any
[54:36] of the negativity in it that this
[54:39] kingdom has
[54:42] oh that that's
[54:44] that's wonderful
[54:46] amen you actually can look beyond the
[54:50] grave you can look beyond the
[54:54] 80 or 90 years that god gives you or
[54:57] maybe less maybe more we don't know but
[55:00] you have a hope that lies
[55:03] in something beyond the veil beyond your
[55:07] vision beyond your experience uh that
[55:11] something that's not affected by
[55:15] where you came in to the world whatever
[55:18] status you came in whatever
[55:21] opportunities were afforded to you
[55:24] every uh
[55:26] that you can sit back and you can say
[55:28] you know i i'm here in the circumstances
[55:32] that i'm in but i have something that's
[55:35] going to take me out of all these
[55:37] circumstances i have something i have a
[55:40] gift of god and that gift is life and
[55:44] it's life more abundantly it's it it's a
[55:48] life more prosperous and
[55:51] it's so when we look at this gift
[55:54] and the the as the we read the
[55:57] scriptures the scripture said that light
[56:00] sprung up and i thought this is such a
[56:03] beautiful description
[56:05] of the world it says
[56:08] the people which sat in darkness saw
[56:12] great light
[56:15] and to them which sat
[56:17] in the regions and shadows of death
[56:22] light sprung up
[56:24] and what a a a description of where man
[56:29] sat
[56:30] in the regions of darkness
[56:34] and
[56:35] and you know when you sit in the dark
[56:38] uh you could
[56:40] certainly say that
[56:43] you're lost
[56:45] and you have no direction because that's
[56:48] what light is for
[56:50] light allows you to
[56:52] see where you are
[56:54] and so there's light is kind of used for
[56:58] a lot of things light is used to see in
[57:02] the darkness
[57:04] and we refer to that as the light we
[57:07] have light and the light shineth in
[57:10] darkness can the darkness comprehendeth
[57:13] it not
[57:14] they couldn't they couldn't see
[57:18] what the light was showing
[57:21] but the gift of god
[57:23] has allowed you to see with the light
[57:28] and so the light has given you eyesight
[57:31] it's giving you eyesab that you may see
[57:35] and that's what we understand in the age
[57:38] that we're living and look at the world
[57:40] that we were born in again in the
[57:43] description of the world that we're born
[57:46] in powers and principalities and
[57:49] spiritual weakness
[57:51] wickedness in high places
[57:56] this this is the world that we're born
[57:59] in that perilous times would come
[58:03] men's conscience would be snared with a
[58:06] hot iron
[58:08] and
[58:10] people would become
[58:12] lovers of pleasure
[58:14] uh
[58:15] more than lovers of god they would be
[58:18] self-indulgent
[58:20] and self uh preserving
[58:25] and and you know uh when you're with a
[58:28] people that are
[58:30] self-preserving another word it becomes
[58:33] a me first
[58:36] i i always marvel at this time of year
[58:39] you'll hear of people getting in fights
[58:43] over
[58:44] in the stores parents
[58:46] over
[58:48] a doll
[58:50] or something
[58:51] you know
[58:52] i don't know i i guess
[58:54] uh i don't want to date myself too bad
[58:57] but i remember there was a
[58:59] this doll they called a cabbage patch
[59:02] doll
[59:03] you know just a piece of junk
[59:06] um and uh
[59:08] and uh
[59:10] and
[59:10] people were
[59:12] would go crazy
[59:14] because they had to get
[59:16] their kid a
[59:18] a cabbage patch doll
[59:20] no matter what it meant if it meant you
[59:23] had to have a smackdown in the aisle of
[59:26] walmart whatever it took you know you've
[59:28] got to get then i'm not condemning if
[59:30] you got a cabbage patch doll i they may
[59:33] be worth something now
[59:35] i don't know you know but
[59:38] people fought over pet rocks you know
[59:41] and i mean i had a whole yard full of
[59:43] pets
[59:45] you know so
[59:46] uh it it it kind of shows you the
[59:49] mentality
[59:51] of the world of darkness
[59:54] and and darkness is not just always an
[59:57] artificial darkness but it's a darkness
[1:00:01] when reality is hid from you where you
[1:00:05] really don't see the truth of the matter
[1:00:08] so light is given that one might find
[1:00:11] its way
[1:00:14] you know you turn on your flashlight so
[1:00:16] you can find the trail you turn on your
[1:00:19] headlights so you can see the road
[1:00:21] because you want to have light to see
[1:00:24] where you're going and to see what lies
[1:00:27] ahead
[1:00:28] and so we look at light as being
[1:00:31] something that provides us eyesight
[1:00:34] it provides us something to see the
[1:00:36] surroundings around us and the scripture
[1:00:39] said that those that sat
[1:00:42] in darkness saw great light
[1:00:46] and so it made
[1:00:48] them aware of
[1:00:50] the
[1:00:51] circumstances in the situation
[1:00:54] and the conditions that you're sitting
[1:00:57] in
[1:00:58] and
[1:00:59] and i would say it like this can you
[1:01:01] imagine sitting in a dark room
[1:01:04] and you really
[1:01:05] don't know
[1:01:07] what's in that
[1:01:08] room
[1:01:10] you don't know what's in there you don't
[1:01:12] know if there's cockroaches in there you
[1:01:14] don't know if there's spiders in there
[1:01:17] you don't know if there's snakes in
[1:01:19] there
[1:01:20] you're just sitting in a room and you
[1:01:22] have no idea
[1:01:24] what is surrounding you
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:28] someone's going to
[1:01:30] all of a sudden
[1:01:32] turn on the light
[1:01:34] and let you see
[1:01:36] what it is that you're sitting in
[1:01:40] now if there were all those things
[1:01:43] in that room
[1:01:45] and all of a sudden you realized you
[1:01:47] were sitting in a place that had bugs
[1:01:50] and snakes and spiders and again all
[1:01:54] kinds of creepy and and and crawling
[1:01:58] things i i wonder if the light would
[1:02:02] cause you to make exit
[1:02:07] it would be because of the light that
[1:02:10] you would say i don't want to sit
[1:02:13] in a place that's dark
[1:02:16] i i want to come from this darkness that
[1:02:20] i'm in that when men saw light they saw
[1:02:24] hope they saw something that they'd
[1:02:25] never seen before their surroundings and
[1:02:28] their condition
[1:02:30] and and what they were
[1:02:32] what they never saw before
[1:02:35] now they were able to see
[1:02:38] it because this great light that sprung
[1:02:41] up
[1:02:42] to that
[1:02:43] that it said that that they they
[1:02:47] those that
[1:02:49] sat in the regions that sat in the
[1:02:52] regions and the shadows
[1:02:55] of death
[1:02:57] that's the condition that they were in
[1:02:59] and like i said the world we're born in
[1:03:02] is a world that is full of powers and
[1:03:06] principalities in spiritual wickedness
[1:03:10] in high places
[1:03:12] and it's perilous times
[1:03:15] with great deception
[1:03:17] okay and so you're born in it and and
[1:03:21] you don't know where it's taking you
[1:03:24] or where it's going or what they have up
[1:03:28] their sleeve
[1:03:29] or what they're trying to do a lot of
[1:03:32] this whole idea behind the resistance
[1:03:35] and different people that that
[1:03:39] uh
[1:03:40] uh
[1:03:40] don't want to
[1:03:42] uh
[1:03:43] they they don't trust
[1:03:44] uh the government if and what what are
[1:03:47] they up to with this vaccine
[1:03:50] you know why do they why does it
[1:03:53] mostly affect the elderly and people
[1:03:57] that have uh
[1:03:58] some sort of conditions that are going
[1:04:01] to cost a a continuous a lot of money uh
[1:04:06] what was there a suspicion that they
[1:04:08] were trying to take
[1:04:10] a certain segment
[1:04:12] eliminate a great portion of the segment
[1:04:16] of society and they did
[1:04:20] half a million people
[1:04:22] i believe
[1:04:24] and
[1:04:25] i don't know
[1:04:27] you know there's a lot of questions a
[1:04:30] young young women that would like to
[1:04:33] raise families does this have an effect
[1:04:36] and nobody can answer that question so
[1:04:40] suspicions arise
[1:04:42] and and you don't have an answer to what
[1:04:46] is there
[1:04:48] you know
[1:04:49] you you know that they take money out of
[1:04:52] your check
[1:04:53] every hour that you work they pluck a
[1:04:56] little bit of money that you earned and
[1:04:59] after you might go get a job and and
[1:05:02] they say you uh you made
[1:05:06] 10 15 dollars an hour but you really
[1:05:09] find out you're only going to take home
[1:05:12] ten of that
[1:05:14] and they've taken five dollars of every
[1:05:18] hour you work they've taken that from
[1:05:20] you
[1:05:21] i recall the time that i got a raise
[1:05:25] and i got a raise i was real happy about
[1:05:28] getting a raise until i found out my
[1:05:30] take-home pay was less
[1:05:32] than it was before
[1:05:36] i went in i said i don't want to raise
[1:05:42] because i know what it's like to live
[1:05:44] hand to mouth
[1:05:46] i know what it's like to sit down with
[1:05:48] the paycheck and save five dollars for
[1:05:51] this five dollars for that
[1:05:53] so much for rent we can buy so much food
[1:05:57] and oh my goodness we'll really splurge
[1:06:01] on next wednesday night we'll have
[1:06:04] grilled cheese and tomato soup for
[1:06:07] supper
[1:06:08] you know
[1:06:09] and and you
[1:06:11] you
[1:06:12] uh
[1:06:14] you you rejoice in what you have and i
[1:06:16] went and said i don't want this race
[1:06:18] because i'm taking home less
[1:06:22] and and so you answer what
[1:06:25] what are they doing with all that money
[1:06:28] and then you find out they're supporting
[1:06:30] things that you don't believe in
[1:06:34] you understand so we're living
[1:06:36] in a time
[1:06:38] and that's something else that light
[1:06:40] does it doesn't always let you know but
[1:06:43] light
[1:06:44] sometimes gives you to
[1:06:46] uh the ability to realize
[1:06:50] what's
[1:06:51] happening
[1:06:52] behind the scene
[1:06:54] or you could you know you might say well
[1:06:57] i got some light shed on this situation
[1:07:00] and then i finally understood what was
[1:07:03] really happening what was really going
[1:07:06] on i really saw what they were up to oh
[1:07:10] now i know it's like a light bulb comes
[1:07:12] on and says oh now i know what they're
[1:07:14] up to
[1:07:17] you know you begin to see what what it
[1:07:19] is so light
[1:07:21] the gift that god paid this was light
[1:07:24] and i wanted to bring
[1:07:28] this little thought in and then i'll
[1:07:29] close
[1:07:30] up this evening and
[1:07:34] like i said
[1:07:36] but
[1:07:38] you know
[1:07:39] the gift of god
[1:07:42] was
[1:07:44] the lord jesus
[1:07:45] we know that and he said in saint john
[1:07:48] 14 6 he said i am the way
[1:07:52] the truth
[1:07:54] the life and no man cometh to the father
[1:08:00] but by me
[1:08:02] so we know we lie in a great
[1:08:07] time of darkness
[1:08:09] and we know that jesus was the light
[1:08:13] of the world
[1:08:15] and it he's become to us
[1:08:19] in the time that we live in
[1:08:22] a great guide
[1:08:24] and so many times we only look at the
[1:08:28] baptism
[1:08:29] of the holy spirit as an experience
[1:08:34] or as something that fixes the past
[1:08:39] our lives are messed up we make bad
[1:08:42] decisions
[1:08:43] things that we can't un
[1:08:46] do and
[1:08:47] and the holy spirit comes
[1:08:49] and and
[1:08:51] and we feel the forgiveness now the holy
[1:08:54] spirit is none other than
[1:08:56] jesus christ returned back to the
[1:08:58] believer in spirit form
[1:09:02] it's the same spirit that he had where
[1:09:06] he had it in fullness
[1:09:08] and and and
[1:09:10] many uh the aspects of it were unlimited
[1:09:14] in him
[1:09:16] god gave each of us a measure of that
[1:09:20] same spirit
[1:09:21] but we know if i have one cup of ocean
[1:09:26] i have everything that's in the ocean in
[1:09:29] that one cup
[1:09:31] even though i don't have all of the
[1:09:34] ocean
[1:09:36] but i'm connected to that ocean i am a
[1:09:39] part of that ocean and that ocean can
[1:09:42] flow
[1:09:44] through me
[1:09:45] can in me and we look so many times as
[1:09:49] the the god the gift of the holy spirit
[1:09:52] as god coming down and showing us the
[1:09:55] darkness that we're in
[1:09:58] and we see the darkness around us and
[1:10:00] we're so grateful that we've got eyes
[1:10:04] that we might see
[1:10:05] and and we rejoice that we can come out
[1:10:09] of the darkness because the
[1:10:12] light's been shined on and we begin to
[1:10:14] see what the effect of that darkness is
[1:10:18] on our life and we see the mistakes
[1:10:21] we've made and we see the condition that
[1:10:24] we're in and so many times we just look
[1:10:26] at the holy spirit of something as
[1:10:29] something that fixes the past
[1:10:33] and and that's like
[1:10:38] having a gift that you don't really
[1:10:40] realize all that's in it
[1:10:44] you know and that's part of the gift
[1:10:49] part of the gift was to see
[1:10:52] that that our eyes were opened by the
[1:10:55] preaching of god's word and we
[1:10:58] we saw
[1:11:00] that the end of this world
[1:11:03] is
[1:11:05] destruction
[1:11:08] and we
[1:11:09] found ourselves
[1:11:11] as being self-destructive
[1:11:15] i'm killing myself
[1:11:18] you know what i mean i can't go on like
[1:11:20] this
[1:11:22] and and the spirit of god come by our
[1:11:24] way and
[1:11:26] and gave us life
[1:11:28] after eternal life
[1:11:30] but
[1:11:31] i i want to say this in in closing
[1:11:35] there's something else about the gift
[1:11:39] that god gave us
[1:11:41] and
[1:11:42] that gift is
[1:11:43] it's a leader
[1:11:47] and
[1:11:48] i think that's the part of the spirit of
[1:11:50] god
[1:11:52] that
[1:11:53] sometimes
[1:11:54] is used the least
[1:11:58] we use it
[1:11:59] to worship
[1:12:01] we use it for
[1:12:03] the
[1:12:05] atmosphere that it creates
[1:12:08] we use it for
[1:12:10] stimulation
[1:12:11] we use it for uplifting
[1:12:15] kind of like a spiritual energy drink
[1:12:18] you know we go to the spirit
[1:12:20] we get in the spirit and in the spirit
[1:12:24] the cares of our life goes away
[1:12:27] in the spirit we feel comfortable that
[1:12:31] i i'm i'm not in darkness because i'm in
[1:12:35] the spirit
[1:12:36] and
[1:12:37] everything that happens so much about
[1:12:40] this wonderful gift that god's given us
[1:12:43] is is that we use it for the moment
[1:12:48] we use it for
[1:12:50] the atmosphere that it creates
[1:12:54] we use it
[1:12:55] for the problems
[1:12:58] that we've that has arisen
[1:13:01] in our lives we use it many times to
[1:13:06] to navigate the the current
[1:13:09] uh situation
[1:13:12] but this
[1:13:13] gift
[1:13:14] that god has given us
[1:13:17] can
[1:13:18] direct us
[1:13:19] in the future
[1:13:25] a lot of times we don't realize we come
[1:13:27] to quick conclusions and quick decisions
[1:13:30] and we've never let really
[1:13:33] laid it out before the gift that god has
[1:13:37] given us to allow us to look down the
[1:13:41] road
[1:13:42] and to see the results of the path that
[1:13:46] we're on so that we can make
[1:13:50] the changes and adjustments and and be
[1:13:53] prepared
[1:13:56] you know we leave that whole
[1:13:58] wonderful part
[1:14:00] of
[1:14:01] the leadership okay
[1:14:04] in other words the holy spirit's more
[1:14:05] than a band-aid
[1:14:10] it's more than a joyful
[1:14:12] stimulus
[1:14:15] you know it's like having something in
[1:14:17] the gift that's never used
[1:14:22] and that's one of the things that he
[1:14:25] told us in this day says i'll give you i
[1:14:28] salve that thou mayest see
[1:14:31] and
[1:14:32] and a great uh
[1:14:35] the great spirit knows the beginning
[1:14:38] from the end
[1:14:39] it can look down the road
[1:14:43] okay it can
[1:14:45] you know it's like something that
[1:14:47] uh
[1:14:48] is there but you've never
[1:14:51] you've never used it
[1:14:54] how do i do it
[1:14:57] you know can we sit and aaron showed us
[1:14:59] how to press the button on the car
[1:15:02] can we go someplace and sit out in the
[1:15:04] parking lot trying to remember which
[1:15:07] buttons to pass you know and the car
[1:15:09] would be flashing and beeping and the
[1:15:11] horn would be going off and everything
[1:15:14] because it was you had to press this
[1:15:15] person
[1:15:17] and that first
[1:15:18] there there there was a way to do it
[1:15:22] but we knew it was there
[1:15:25] we knew it was part of the gift
[1:15:28] we come to the understanding
[1:15:31] that there was things that this vehicle
[1:15:33] could do that we never took the time
[1:15:40] to find out about
[1:15:42] and and
[1:15:46] and the reason i'm saying this because
[1:15:50] it
[1:15:52] you never appreciate
[1:15:54] something
[1:15:56] or or are thankful
[1:15:58] for it to the extent that it could
[1:16:02] really
[1:16:03] uh
[1:16:04] be honored for
[1:16:06] if you don't really know all the ability
[1:16:09] that it has
[1:16:13] you know it's like having an oven and
[1:16:15] you didn't know you can set the timer
[1:16:18] and have it come on
[1:16:20] all you knew is you turned it to 350 and
[1:16:22] you wait till the dinger went off and
[1:16:24] you stuck it in there
[1:16:26] how many times you rushed home to stick
[1:16:28] the meal in there
[1:16:30] on time so it would be done and then one
[1:16:33] day you come to find out hey i could put
[1:16:35] that in there before i leave i can set
[1:16:38] the clock i can stay and visit and when
[1:16:41] i come home it'll be done just when i
[1:16:42] want it to do
[1:16:44] all of a sudden you like that oven
[1:16:47] a whole lot more than you did before
[1:16:53] can boy you're just rejoicing over that
[1:16:55] and then you find out that crazy thing
[1:16:58] has an app
[1:16:59] it can tell your phone what the
[1:17:01] temperature is of the food that's inside
[1:17:04] of it
[1:17:06] and he's wow this is really great and
[1:17:08] you begin to find out that there's more
[1:17:10] to it and there's more to it and there's
[1:17:13] more to it can it unfolds to you and i
[1:17:17] think so many times we stop with the
[1:17:19] holy spirit can the spirit of god and we
[1:17:22] think well i'm saved i have eternal life
[1:17:27] my past has been fixed
[1:17:29] he comforts me
[1:17:30] because he said he wouldn't leave me
[1:17:32] comfortless
[1:17:33] and i stopped there i'm satisfied with
[1:17:37] that and yet there's so much more to the
[1:17:40] gift that god give us
[1:17:45] eternal life is just the beginning
[1:17:48] but to be able to discern
[1:17:50] uh good and evil to be able to
[1:17:54] know what someone has need of
[1:17:56] the move you and to lead you and to
[1:18:01] guide you into all truth and
[1:18:04] righteousness we feel like we've
[1:18:06] obtained righteousness we have the gift
[1:18:08] but we leave the leadership of this
[1:18:11] marvelous gift that can actually
[1:18:15] show us
[1:18:17] what lies ahead

[1:18:52] before
[1:18:53] you
[1:18:55] i'll walk through the shadow of the
[1:18:56] valley of death yet i will fear no evil
[1:19:00] because thy rod and thy staff it
[1:19:04] comforteth me it leadeth me beside the
[1:19:08] still waters
[1:19:11] the holy spirit's kind of become
[1:19:14] like i said it's more reviewed as an
[1:19:17] experience
