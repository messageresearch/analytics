That they would come to know the ways of the word. We ask you now to bless this dedication of this wonderful child. As we acknowledge, Father, that it comes from you and it'll return to you. We ask these blessings in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you. I mean, it's nice to be home. You didn't want to do those steps, huh? Oh my. Yeah. You know, none of us just came into this world growed up, you know. So every time I see a little kid, I just it just my mind tries to go back. It was, you know, certainly I wasn't like that, you know. But uh uh yeah, but anyway, I it's happy to be home and um uh I I think this morning if you have any spirituality at all, you'll kind of catch the how my trip went according to what that we uh share with you this morning. But um um we want to uh fellowship this morning, listen to a little less than uh 20 minutes of a message called the way of a true prophet. And uh after that uh we play this, we'll make a few comments to you. But uh and uh so we've been preaching uh quite a bit on what is our path forward. In other words, we've come this far. What do we need to do to go forward with the Lord? We just don't want to set up a camp and become content in um uh and complacent and where things just become common to us and our life becomes routine. And uh one of the things that we're counseledled to have in this generation is ISAV that we might see. And uh the age is a age where the eyesight becomes dim and the people become dull of hearing and uh and and so we're always fighting the spirit of our age. And there's only one way to fight anything and that's with the weapons that God gave you to fight with. Um your own devices will not work. Uh even though your motive is correct, your objective is good, what that you want to accomplish is the right thing. But if you don't use what God gave you to achieve that accomplishment, you'll find yourself failing. And then your failure comes back on you. And then you begin to feel less worthy. You begin to feel like you're a failure. Um and you begin to lose your confidence. But if we could place our confidence in the word, regardless of how it seems not to fit the circumstance, the way we perceive it, but yet the word of God never fails. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my word will not pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you have your Bibles, let's stand and open to the book of Amos. And we want to turn to in the book of Amos to the uh second chapter of the book of Amos. And we want to read the fourth verse. And I I I I truly recommend uh if you're a a type of person that likes to follow the ministry and and and follow the subject matter and and the direction that we're going here, um uh I I I strongly recommend that you take the time this week and listen to the sermon. Uh it's uh called the way of a true prophet. It was preached in 62 and 63. We're going to be listening to the portion out of 63 this morning, but we'll make some quotes out of 62. But anyway, I think that it's a very timely sermon. So, let us read in Amos. And it says in Amos, it says, "Thus saith the Lord, for three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof, because thou hast despised the law of the Lord, and have not kept his commandments." and their lies cause them to heir after the which their fathers have walked. Heavenly Father, bless your word to us. In your precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. We know the story of Amos. We know that he was a prophet. Some refer to him as a minor prophet, but yet he had a major message. and he's in the days of Jeroboam and uh and he comes forth out of the wilderness uh because the Lord spoke to him and he comes and prophesies to Israel and Judah. And so we're going to pick it up with the our messenger picking up the story and bringing it to our day. So, as we listen, we're just going to listen to a short portion, but as he begins to preach, he makes this comment. Let's take Amos and bring him into our day. How many believes the word's unchanging? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Satan is the same devil he was, but he just has tactics. And he knew he was going to get to mankind by using three major things: civilization, education, and science. He was going to use those three things to try to defeat the church of the living God. And every time that the church begins to get away from God, God raises up a voice. And we know that we've heard a voice in this last day. And that's the reason all of us are here today is not over the personality of a preacher, not over a um a style of preaching, but we're we're here because we've heard a voice. We've we've heard of something that struck our heart. And it didn't even matter if you were raised in the message and your parents were believers. Eventually, you hear that voice for yourself and you know it's true. You're thankful for your parents that they heard the voice. uh many of us I refer to as 11th hour workers that you're hearing the same message, the same reward uh that I heard 50ome years ago. Uh and I I understand and see more in the message today than I did when I started. But so it's such a blessing that the word of God is so rich. So if you just join with me for a few moments this morning and let us listen to uh just a few moments of this wonderful message uh um the way of a true prophet and think of that today because that's what we want to talk about is the way. So, it's the way forward and now we're talking about the way of a prophet. So, this morning we're talking about a way. So, God bless you as we listen for these next few minutes. Amen. Starting on paragraph 91, uh, and I believe the it's 119 63, the way of a true prophet. Pick up the story here. God bless you. I wonder today now that if Amos would come to us, would we receive him today? Would Phoenix receive Amos if somewhere up across the mountain here somewhere or down from some part of the country came a little rugged dressed fella like that could walk in here and call the ministers to order and say I have the word of the Lord. Do you think we would receive it? &gt;&gt; Certainly not. The first thing we ask him, "What group are you with?" &gt;&gt; And what if he'd turn around and say, "The heavenly group." That would kind of be foreign to us, some praise. &gt;&gt; But that's the way it was then. And it perhaps be the same way today if Amos come on the scene. Let's just for the sake of what I've said transport him here just a few moments and see what we think he would do. You know what he'd do? I believe he would disagree with our whole setup. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He would disagree with our denominational doctrines. &gt;&gt; He would condemn Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Catholic, and Pentecostals. You take the whole thing. certainly would. &gt;&gt; He would disagree with their denominational doctrines. &gt;&gt; He would go straight to the fundamental foundation of the word and start right on the word. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He would begin his campaign upon thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? You think Phoenix would receive it? You think Louisville would receive him? New York, Boston, Massachusetts, or wherever it might be, California? No, sir. That had the little fell in jail as quick as they could get him there. &gt;&gt; Certainly would. They would certainly do that. If he went back to the word, I'm sure they would &gt;&gt; because every group would disagree with him. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it wouldn't be a one agree with him &gt;&gt; because they have to hold to their traditions in order to disagree with the word. &gt;&gt; We'd have to remember that he is a true prophet. If he been if he was a prophet sent from God, he would be one mark to him, one definite mark that we know he is a prophet, he would stay with the word &gt;&gt; because that's where the word of God came was to the prophets. You know what he would do? He would blast and condemn &gt;&gt; this generation. &gt;&gt; He would condemn every Bob Dared woman in the country. &gt;&gt; He would condemn every denominational preacher. &gt;&gt; He certainly would. &gt;&gt; He would condemn every cigarette smoker. &gt;&gt; Every woman that wore shorts or slacks, he'd tear them apart. Why? It's against the word. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; You think we would receive him? By no means. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't receive it. He'd condemn the immorals of the church. &gt;&gt; He'd shake that little old wrinkled finger in that preacher's face and say, "You mean to tell me that you call yourself anointed servant of God and will stand in the pullpit and let your women dre sexy sexy among your men and things like that. Let your young women rise up like that. You'll permit your man to marry two or three times to be deacons in the churches. You mean to tell me that you'll hold on to that credential that you got in your hand and turn aside the word of God? Oh my [Applause] blast. Yes, sir. The immorality of the church and the immorality of the members. It blasted mine. every member he'd tear down. Every man-made seminary doctrine, he'd tear the thing to pieces. &gt;&gt; Now, could you receive a man like that? &gt;&gt; No, they wouldn't do it. They certainly wouldn't do it. They'd get that fell out of town as quick as they could. &gt;&gt; While the association be meeting together and say, "Say, we got to do something about this. Tell your congregation not to go there." &gt;&gt; They hear that, you know. &gt;&gt; Oh, we would not receive him. By no means they wouldn't receive him. Certainly they couldn't do it. Listen to him blast. Oh, I like it. You hear it. &gt;&gt; I'm looking right down on what he said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "The very God that you claim to serve will destroy you." &gt;&gt; You'd say that same thing today. &gt;&gt; We Americans has wrapped oursself in so much of fantastic things. so much big buildings and big uh numbers in our organizations. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And all this fine popularity and seminary ministers who's trained up to hold their peace and say nothing about because afraid they'd be exccommunicated from the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Certainly you'd blast that thing to pieces because it's against the word. &gt;&gt; Certainly would. And the very God that we claim to serve will will burn this thing off one of these days. He'll blast it to pieces. Amos wouldn't change his words if he's here today. &gt;&gt; Stay right back to the word. Oh, what you listening at him telling there, God loved you. He brought you. He made you a chosen people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear him in a Pentecostal church one time. You believe his aim was made get off my back then for a while. &gt;&gt; Yes, he would tell them. &gt;&gt; He'd pull punches. &gt;&gt; He'd blast it just as hard as he could. And tell them where they'd fallen short of the word, the God that brought you out of these homemade man-made margs &gt;&gt; years ago, 50 years ago. your fathers and mothers came out of these systems that bound up and got the world into them and your God sent his mercy down and called you out &gt;&gt; away from the sin and stuff that's that was in the church &gt;&gt; and now you've turned right back around like Samaria did that God brought them out from them countries and they turned right back around and he made an alliance with that country &gt;&gt; how we are today trying to compete with those big denominational churches. We're building bigger schools. Well, we don't need big schools. It's all right. I ain't got nothing to say against it. But every time that you take a founder or leader that goes forth in his day, well, he'll do good in his day, but as soon as he's gone, then they'll build an organization over the top of his work. Then they'll get a bunch of little Rickys in there and Elvis's and the first thing you know they twist the thing to make it suit themselves. And then this other comes up. He injects something else because he's a great intellectual student out of Harvard somewhere or something. And the first thing they begin to eject this and take this out and say this didn't mean that and that. You're right back in the same old rut again. Yes. If Amos is your he blast the thing right straight to the ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He never built his campaign upon how many churches he could get to cooperate with him. He never built his church upon some certain organization or some sectarian parts of the church. The thing he do build his campaign up on thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God would back him up as he always did. &gt;&gt; Prove that is right. &gt;&gt; He said there's trouble turmoils in your church. What would he say today? What would he say with that word of God hanging out here before us? Second Timothy 3 said they be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, &gt;&gt; truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, and despisers of those that are trying to live right. &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness, but would deny the power thereof. You think a prophet could rise on the scene and bypass that prophecy? You say it's fulfilled in your eyes this day. &gt;&gt; How that the church would get formal and how the things they would do, he'd he'd bring to your memory those words of God. &gt;&gt; He'd bring to your memory what God said he'd do in this day &gt;&gt; when Amos rolls on the scene. Not only that, but God would prove by Amos &gt;&gt; what he promised to do &gt;&gt; in this day. &gt;&gt; Certainly he would. He did it in that day. He's always done it. &gt;&gt; Certainly, we would not receive Amos if he rose on the scene. Now, how that form of God in the choirs and and around great long robed choirs and and sang like angels and danced the next night like devils. That's &gt;&gt; right. It's exactly the truth. Some come out with great long robes on flowerly looking like that and look like some kind of an angelic being and stand up there and deny the word like any evil spirit would. &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof. &gt;&gt; Go talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost said why he running out of the church. &gt;&gt; Why? He has to. But they'll stand in these churches and let their members in the basement do the twist and rock and roll. &gt;&gt; Now, our so-called YMCA, I wonder what that C stands for. Walk into them, you can't even hardly hear nothing but the Lord's name. You is that the young man's cursing society? I stayed not long ago in a hotel was across from the YW.CA CA. And it was a disgrace to see them little girls out there on the floor till about 9:00 trying to break their legs and doing the twist. &gt;&gt; That's right. And &gt;&gt; all of members of a church sang in choirs and taught Sunday school. &gt;&gt; Nothing but the devil takes them little children out there on the floor. A system that's been made up called religion. Certainly a true prophet would blast that thing right back into the smoke of hell where it originated at. &gt;&gt; Certainly is true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You think Amos could stand on the platform and preach the gospel and look out over a bunch of bobbed women and not condemn it? &gt;&gt; You think he wouldn't quote Isaiah 5 and 1 Corinthians 14 and all, wouldn't he? Wouldn't he pour that on? Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly you would &gt;&gt; walk down the streets and see women with these little clothes on. Look like man's so tight that the skins on the outside almost going down twisting, mincing, walking like that, drinking theirelves along. And you think a man of God wouldn't stand a pull pit and blast that thing &gt;&gt; when it's very sel ever spoke from from the pull pit. And that's in Pentecostal churches, too. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. would make no difference to Amos &gt;&gt; some he'd be one that would say he wouldn't be afraid because he was anointed of the Lord and if he had thus sayeth the Lord it would have to be the word of the Lord &gt;&gt; he'd come to Samaria not to look at their glamour to count how many organizations and how many numbers they had as I said the other night it seems to be today that the whole church is built upon the main thing amongst the brethren today uh the churches is numbers. Numbers. One trying to outdo the other one. &gt;&gt; Numbers. God don't count numbers. He counts character. &gt;&gt; Character is what God looking to find somebody he could get his hands. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody will stand still long enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We said decisions all year. We had so many decisions. That's stones, confessions. And what good is a stone without a stonemason with a sharp word of God to cut him into a son of God or a daughter of God and placed him in the church where he belongs. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Rolling up stones won't make the building. You got to cut them and shape them. &gt;&gt; We need man today, anointed man like Amos was that would cut the world away from that woman and make her a daughter of God. Cut that world away from the man regardless of how many trustees do not or any other stand on dust sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't receive Amos. I don't think like this. What do you think Amos to do when he walked into a Pentecostal church today? claims to be led by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and then see that same thing in the Pentecostal church &gt;&gt; that claims to be led by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I wonder we can talk about the Baptist and Methodist and the Lutheran, but when it comes to our own dirty door, then what about that? &gt;&gt; Gotten away from the word of God. Something went wrong somewhere. It's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They come and do all these different things and claim to be led in the spirit, dance in the spirit, sometimes even speak with tongues. I believe in speaking with tongues. I believe in dancing in the spirit. I believe in shouting. &gt;&gt; But there's a lot more goes with that. That's &gt;&gt; right. If you do all those things and deny the word, then there's something wrong somewhere. got the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; God doesn't lead his people to such things anyhow. &gt;&gt; No, he doesn't. &gt;&gt; I think it's a time. It's just about another coming out party. &gt;&gt; Another Boston Tea Party has to say the church needs one. &gt;&gt; It needs a real good cleaning up. &gt;&gt; When Jonah Bart the days gone by, the Catholic Church missed knowing that she was a saint. when she's living because she saw visions, could interpret dreams. A spiritfilled woman and God used the little lady and they thought she was a witch and they burn her to a stake as a witch. You know that the Catholic priests did that themselves. Hundreds of years passed and they found out she was a saint. Then when they go to canonize her, they had to do penance. So they dug up those priests body and filled them in the river to do penance. You see it passed right by and they failed to see it. They done it pretty. The same thing with St. Patrick and all the rest of them. No wonder Jesus said, "You garnish and make white the tombs of the prophets and you're the one that put them in there." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What we need today is Amos to bring back the word of the Lord to us. Certainly does. Now, our claims and things doesn't mean nothing unless the spirit of God is there to back up our claims. &gt;&gt; If our lives don't compare with our claims, then there's something wrong. Jon of Arc led France to a revolutionary. They needed a revolutionary. It's exactly what they did. They needed a revolutionary. She led it. But after the revolutionary where the mistake was made, they needed a counterrevolutionary to straight to straighten up what they was revoling about. I say the Pentecostal church is the closest thing I know to the Bible today. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't, I'd be in some other. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be standing here wasting my time speaking to the Pentecostal people if I didn't think there was a hoax. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Pentecost is right. But when we need Pentecost to get together and our traditions broke down, then we need a counter revolution. We need a counter coming. They got not a Pentecostal claim but a Pentecostal clean coming. &gt;&gt; God's holy. They that live by him must live holy. &gt;&gt; He is a holy God. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord." &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; His life is holy. And if his life is in you, it makes you holy. &gt;&gt; Without it, you don't see the Lord. And look where she's drifting to. &gt;&gt; We are something like Israel was in those days old. Israel thought because that they were prospering, everything was going good. They had an alliance in their days with the other cities and they had an alliance. The government had an alliance with the ministers, with the priests, with the prophets. They thought this was all right. They thought that was just pleasing to the Lord. But they had a little fellow that raised up and brought him back again. &gt;&gt; Right? Just because it prospered. That's where we make a mistake. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prosperity is no sign of spiritual blessing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not a bit, is it? Prosperity sometimes is a hindrance. &gt;&gt; You remember what the Lord said about Israel? When you were little, when you had nothing, &gt;&gt; when you laid in your own blood in a field, no one to clean you, I took you in. &gt;&gt; Then you served me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when you got old enough that you thought you was all right and self-secured, then you left me. &gt;&gt; They've always did that. Hezekiah, as I spoke of at the businessman's breakfast the other morning, he was a great man. He held on to the Lord. But one day after God strengthened him and he was a great example to Isaiah the prophet. But after he got strong and built up, the nations begin to fear him. He built his walls and began to get glamorous things. He got self-conceited. He got to look at how great he was. And then he tried to take the place of the preacher. &gt;&gt; God smoked him with leprosy and he died a leper. &gt;&gt; We don't never want to get lifted up in our hearts. &gt;&gt; And sometimes when we see our organizations prosper, we begin to say, "We're the big group. We're the biggest Pentecostal group there is. We have more than the rest of them." or you can't get to heaven unless you belong to our group or something. When you get that way, you've separated yourself from the word of the law. &gt;&gt; Right. Remember the blankets wide enough to stretch for your brethren. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. Take him in. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we need today a call back to the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Look, today in our nation needs a call back. I'd like to read another statement if you don't mind. Uh talking about Amos. He said, "But those God's anointed eyes of that prophet didn't narrow because of the glamour like some tourist, but on the moral corruption to a people who was called to be blessed of God." I like to drop down and read a little further down. He says he's seen the corruption, the decay, and that's what he was looking at, and then he's seen all of that. It didn't attract him. It sickened him to his soul. Why? He was a prophet. He knew what God had promised to bless and what a blessing was and how the people act with the blessing. When you read these sermons and you read quite a bit of what brother Brandon preached in ' 62 and 63, the indictment is your life worthy of the gospel. Spiritual amnesia. He addressed the failing condition of the church and he began to point out how things have started to be added to the church and the people started. He uses the word quite often drifting. drifting into modernism, drifting into things that weren't there. Even within the framework of our message today, people put a lot of emphasis that we have the spirit moving. We have the spirit moving. And yet the same ones that claim the great movement of the Holy Spirit have 52in TVs in their living room. And he's saying that we've lost the Isav to see. We become conceited in ourselves. You heard the word for yourself. I I I I didn't even see this. I didn't even come up with this. But it takes a prophet to give you eyes that you could see. He he the holiness began to slip away. We substituted church for uh our Wednesday evenings and our prayer meetings and our Sunday evening services are now substitutes with you know volleyball and picnics and gettogethers and watching sports events and everything. But we claim a a a righteousness. We we claim a con a a conceit, brother Brandan called it, that we're right, you know, we have the truth. Uh we're the ones uh we're the forerunner. Uh we're we're the reestablishment of the glory of God. And Amos said, "By their lies, they lead the people astray. And I I've been in my heart, you know that. And and I I have a lot of things that I need to overcome personally and and and I work on them daily. But you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, I don't think there's any way into the kingdom than God's provided word. And I don't believe there's another interpretation of the word other than the interpretation that the message or of the hour gave us. &gt;&gt; I believe that I I believe that whatever he speaks applies to all of us equally. There's no ministry, there's no man, there's nobody that has a right to stand in between the ears of the hearer and the voice of God. &gt;&gt; It is up to each of us &gt;&gt; individually never to assign yourself to a group but to assign a self to the word personally. I have chosen in my life and in my heart not to be a member &gt;&gt; but to be a follower of the word of God. And so I I I I've just came back from a trip and and was astounded not at the love of the people, not at the people of individuals, but of the overall condition and the drift in the message today. And so I've been talking about the way forward and I realized as I listen to this that sometimes the way forward is back, back to the original path, &gt;&gt; back back to the fundamentals. He said that prophet would stand up and he would preach the fundamentals of the word of God. And I thought of a way of a prophet because Paul said these words and I believe they could be spoken in our day. Be followers of me as I am of Christ. And so when you talk about the way of a true prophet, he said he's beginning to talk about what a true prophet would do. Because a prophet is the interpretation of the word. You can't separate the messenger from his message. In other words, if a way of a prophet was the word of God, then you should be able to make this conclusion. If I could say it this way, there was no part of his life that was not the word. It was it was his life was associated with the word. just looking back. So he he a messenger is the light to the age. &gt;&gt; There's a man here who can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; And I I want you to understand what I'm saying. The church is beginning to look at the church. &gt;&gt; The church is beginning to look at the ministry. The church is beginning to look at their worship. The church is beginning to look at their buildings. They're beginning to look at their membership. They're beginning to look at their fellowship. And and it's nice to have fellowship. It's nice to honor certain things. We do that. We have, you know, sister uh Fatu and Sister Aldi. They they they've lost their mothers and our heart goes out for them. We we grieve with them. We we we mourn with them. We we feel for them. You know, that that that's part of the what we do as a church. But we don't we don't, you know, start to say that our spirituality is built on our fellowship, &gt;&gt; how we get along, how we treat one another. and and you can actually create a a whole complete uh uh atmosphere that is not reflective, but you want to see a reflection of the word of God. So when God called a man, he made him a certain way. He made even the way his lips were formed to speak his words was orchestrated by God. So much so that the messenger used these words to instill in us &gt;&gt; the absoluteness of the ministry in our age that there was no difference between this ministry and the ministry of Jesus Christ except for the corporal body. And I'm I'm saying this with all my heart &gt;&gt; is that that position of that messenger has been declining in the church. &gt;&gt; And you know this is my pet be but they won't play his message. years and years and years and years churches go on and the people sit in the congregation with secondhand revelation. And when we know beyond a shadow of a doubt, he said that was the sickness in the church and that caused lives to be in the condition that they're in is secondhand revelation. If the you say, "Well, you can listen to tapes at home. If they're good enough for you at home, they're good enough for us as a body." and and and I'll go on record. &gt;&gt; The minister who will not play the word of God to his people as spoken of in this generation is denying his people a true blessing. &gt;&gt; But you can't separate. You can't create an atmosphere or a way of worship or say because the gifts are operating. He said there's a lot more goes with it than that. And then he actually said and God doesn't lead that way anyway. &gt;&gt; But we forgot what he said. &gt;&gt; We forgot that he was the source. &gt;&gt; We forgot that he was a light. that there was a man there that could turn on the light. &gt;&gt; We've slowly separated the messenger from the message. We've taken his message, as you just heard him say, and we put it the way that we want it. We we put it out the way that it suits us. The parts of it that we like. The parts of it that tickle our ear. The parts of it that make us feel that we're good. &gt;&gt; Holiness has gone out the window. &gt;&gt; You can hardly preach about it. I'm preaching overseas and I I I I make a comment and you heard the prophet of God say about twisting and rock and roll and dancing. He says one place he says that twisting and rock and roll and dancing came straight out of the jungles of Africa. &gt;&gt; Now since when do I have to shy away from anything that the prophet of God said? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether it condemns me or not, &gt;&gt; I would rather be found guilty by listening to it than be found guilty by ignorance. &gt;&gt; But we're we're we're drifting from what it was that called us. It &gt;&gt; it isn't about our past, &gt;&gt; our sins. Every bit of your sins is under the blood. If you fail, you cry, "Aba, Father. He's faithful and just to forgive you." &gt;&gt; But I'm saying that we want to go forward. &gt;&gt; We want more of God. I'm telling you, the way for us to go forward is to go back to the ABCs of this message and the word of God. back to our example. &gt;&gt; Back to the truth. What was his ways? Think of our messenger living his daily life. How he got up in the morning, how he started his day, how he treated people, how he went down. Leslie and I were sitting in the uh living room of her sister and and a man was sitting there in his 90s reading his Bible and we talked to him a moment. It was it was uh the grandfather of Leslie's uh sister's husband and he was the dry cleaner in Jeffersonville, Indiana that did all of Brother Brandham's suits. He said, "Yes." He said, "I did Brother Brandham's dry cleaning for years. I thought he'd come in and grab those anointed suits." No wonder he was sitting there at 90ome years old reading his Bible. That's right. &gt;&gt; I imagine that anointing was on him whether he knew it or not. I still believe in that kind of thing. &gt;&gt; And he began to tell us of what a gentleman he was, how kind he was, you know, simple things. He always paid. He always so grateful. He always complimented me on what a wonderful job we did. He he was appreciative. He was thankful. It was almost like, you know, like he he was so grateful. You know, here I'm charging him, but he makes me feel like I just did the greatest work known to civilization. &gt;&gt; That was his way. &gt;&gt; That was his manners. I remember talking to Billy Paul about the time that Brother Brandham was standing behind a curtain waiting for his time to preach and the brother stepped up to the microphone and said, "Oh, we're so sorry. Brother Brandham got called out on a sick call and he won't be able to be with us." And brother Bram was standing right right there behind the piano. And a brother turned to him and said, "Brother Bram, why don't you go out there?" You know what he said? "Brother, I would never do anything to hurt that brother." Now me, I'd expose that line devil, you know, but he was so tender. He knew that if you plucked up the wheat that you might hurt the wheat. &gt;&gt; He knew God sold the harvest. &gt;&gt; He knew that seed was going to come up. &gt;&gt; And he bore all the reproach and stood on the word of God. That was his his manners, his atmosphere that he created. &gt;&gt; His speech, the way he talked. He could talk as cutting as he did right there because it was the word of God, but but fill you with such love and feeling that you you felt like you were sinless when you were guilty. You know, his associations, everything about him was his way. It was his way. It was the way of a true prophet. It was it was the absolute in his life and his way was supposed to transfer to us. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, prove that by the word." There was a harvest. How many believe we're in harvest time? &gt;&gt; How many believe we're in the time of the rapture? &gt;&gt; How many believe we're at the end time? &gt;&gt; Or do we just think it's going to go on forever? Jesus said it this way. Thou fool, thy soul may be required of you this night, this day. Today could be your day. You you be you begin to see that that light and that life that was shining was the interpretation of the word of God. And you say, well, what why was that? He was a candlestick. &gt;&gt; He was a light in the hand. He was the seventh age messenger. The mysteries of God were be revealed. But when you take all of that and you bring it back, really, what did he say? He said it when the before the harvest comes to maturity, the first one, the first fruit that reached the maturity by setting in the sun. It became a sign to what all the rest of the fruit would come to. &gt;&gt; If you walked up, my mother had a orange tree in her backyard. That tree produced thousands of bushels of oranges. It was absolutely the most amazing tree. And you could wait to that tree and the little green things would come up and finally you'd go out there and you'd grab one and it was soft and and and you'd cut it up and it was juicy and it was sweet and it was just absolutely wonderful. You knew that that tree had the potential to produce every orange exactly like that. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if you would let it mature, &gt;&gt; each of those oranges would come. &gt;&gt; But if you got impatient and you picked one too soon, &gt;&gt; bitter. But if you'd let the sun &gt;&gt; do its work &gt;&gt; that the every tree so that fruit, that light, that messenger, the one that we used to model our lives after, maybe to the point of air, I'll admit. did. But we we wouldn't climb over a bobwire fence unless we did it the way the prophet of God did it. When we first came into the message, it it was such a shining light. We realized we were so far from God that we thought maybe it'd be better if we drove a Ford. Whatever he said, whatever he did, we were sure of it. If there was nothing else we weren't sure of, we were sure that the way he did things was the way of the word because that's the way of a true prophet. &gt;&gt; But now we have our own way. Our song services are like concerts. &gt;&gt; Drums are blaring, saxophones are ripping, choreograph moves on the platform. All the singers going one way and going back the other way and every guy that's singing has an album to sell. I'm for worship. We don't come here for worship. &gt;&gt; We do come here for worship, but it's also the house of correction. &gt;&gt; We worship the Lord. And we worship him by acknowledging the fact that we're going to follow his word, not to be entertained, not that the music generates the spirit. I'm all for dancing. I'm all for speaking in tongues, but how come it turn the music off? I'd love to see you get up right now under the anointing of the word of God, which is here, &gt;&gt; and run around this church praising God. But if you need a banjo to do it, &gt;&gt; you speak in tonesues is what he said when he said what was rejected was somebody speaking in tonesues and it being interpretating and say this and this is going to take place &gt;&gt; otherwise is they will think you're mad. &gt;&gt; We've drifted. &gt;&gt; We want to go forward. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to go forward? &gt;&gt; Don't you want to go forward into the rapture? &gt;&gt; I'm telling you this morning, the way forward is to go back to the principles and to the way of a true prophet. individually. &gt;&gt; You've got to decide. &gt;&gt; We have to enforce certain rules because we have to have some sort of order, some sort of decency, some sort of accommodation. So we talk to you about seating. We talk to you about parking. We talk to you about these things so we don't have chaos because the scripture tells us to let all things be done decently and in order. But it's up for you as an individual to take this word, this voice &gt;&gt; and listen to it. You decide whether you should be here 30 minutes or not. &gt;&gt; You decide whether you should take communion or not. &gt;&gt; You decide whether you should work on Sunday or not. You make those decisions. We've exited the law. You have to decide whether that way, the way that he preached is the way to maturity. &gt;&gt; If it's the way to the rapture, that's a decision you've got to make in your own heart. As the prophet said, "As for me, in my house, we'll serve the Lord." Judas says, "Thou hast not kept the commandments of our fathers. Thou hast despised the law. Thou has listened to a lie that has taken you an air." I'll tell you who the voice of God was to you in this day. And it wasn't any preacher, in any pulpit, in any place in this message. It was the voice of Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7. God gave him the name William Mary Brandham. &gt;&gt; Someone said to me, "Well, you just believe it because he's an American." No, I don't believe this message by culture. I don't believe this message by location. &gt;&gt; I believe this message by seed. &gt;&gt; I don't care if his name was Chopstick Charlie from China. If he would have preached &gt;&gt; what he preached &gt;&gt; and if he was vindicated the way that he was vindicated, the seed in me would have said amen to every word of God. &gt;&gt; The only reason he came from here was because of civilization &gt;&gt; and the last voice was to come at the end of civilization. And the last prophecy, &gt;&gt; oh Capernium, Capernium, city of angels, oh United States of America, because thou has exalted thyelves into the heavens, thou shalt be brought to the lowest hell. &gt;&gt; You want to go forward, go back. &gt;&gt; Go back to your messenger. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Go back to what you know is true. &gt;&gt; Go back to the life. &gt;&gt; Don't let people talk you out of it. &gt;&gt; Message churches today don't even have communion and footwashing. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Without it, you're not going to be there. How long are you going to sit &gt;&gt; because of your fellowship, because of your friendship? and rot and die. Who who who going to who you going to blame? The scripture said there'll be wailing and nashing of teeth. Don't squander what you've been blessed with. Especially America, you have the tapes. You have the books. I I thank God for Voice of God for printing the books. I thank God they trying to get tablets, whatever they can do. it I I agree with more probably than what I disagree with. You want to go forward. You really want to go forward. Maybe you don't. But the way forward is back back to the word, back to our example, back to the way of a true prophet. &gt;&gt; And and you'll find that your whole life will start to come in order. The it Satan has made it to where it just doesn't seem like the word of God will work, but it'll never fail. &gt;&gt; He's placed within your hand a pearl of great price, the lost coin, the treasure in the field. It's all yours. It's yours. It's It's sitting right on your phone. It's sitting right on your device. It's sitting right in your closets and on your bookshelves and on the shelves back there. It's yours. It's a feast of mana that you can eat. You can go a whole day without food a lot easier than you can go a whole day without the word of God. So let's as I I I try to do the job if I could use that terminology and the place or the office that I have. I want to do it according to the messenger of RH the best I can. Don't we all agree on that one point? Isn't that what we've all purposed in our heart? So let's put on the Isav that he counseledled us to buy. I counsel thee to buy of me. Isav that thou mayest see white reignment that your nakedness doesn't appear. blind, poor, miserable, wretched, and naked, and don't even know it. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you be happy if somebody came to you and told you you weren't dressed or you were going the wrong way? We don't need more spirit. We need more ABCs, which produces the spirit. It produces the real spirit, the real power, &gt;&gt; the real life. Not something short-lived, &gt;&gt; but something that you walk out of here with because it's life in your soul. It's life in your being. It's the way you live. It's the way you go. It's your way. Your way is the way of the word. Your way is the way of a true prophet. Your way is the way of the spirit of God. The spirit of God didn't even come to speak of itself. It came to bring us into remembrance of all things which I have taught you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I saw the condition of the church, I saw how far it moved away from our messenger. Thousands of people sitting there because nobody's telling them the truth. I said, "It's not my place to condemn, but it's my place to look in the mirror and ask myself." And I honestly have to say I came with the conclusion that I need to go back to the absolute Whether the church likes it or not, whether the songs we love are not appropriate, whatever it takes, Lord, help me &gt;&gt; stay with this message. &gt;&gt; There's no big eyes. There's no they'll use. There's no some guilty and not guilty. If you're guilty of the least, you're guilty of the whole. But let's let our attitude be in Christian life that we're going to do our very best to walk in the way of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Would we each do that in our own heart? God bless you this morning. really lead us in singing. [Applause] Now, don't applaud and then go live like a devil. &gt;&gt; All you are is a choir member. I told you a hundred times the prophet of God don't like it. Oh, I like it. But you know what it is? Applause is the show is over. I enjoyed it. Now I'm waiting for the next one. The last thing that the spirit of God does, the last and final thing that the spirit of God does before the church is caught up into the presence of the living God is a final separation. He'll finally separate the real from the false, the sincere from the uncincere. The lovers of God from the lovers of pleasure. He'll separate the religious from heartfelt. You know what our messenger said? I said, "I'd rather hear a guy squeak out a tune from his heart than have some trained opera voice." I like good singing. I like it when it comes from the heart. I like it when it comes from the soul. But don't you ever be afraid to sing because you don't got no talent. &gt;&gt; If you got the heart, it's music to my ears. Don't you ever be afraid to lift your hands and praise God. &gt;&gt; If you want to praise God, don't be afraid to shout. &gt;&gt; If you've got a shout in you, &gt;&gt; but what's motivating it? Don't ever be afraid to speak in tonesues if it's the God speaking in tonesues. Speaking in tongues is not a proof the spirit of God is with you. Neither is prosperity. Satan can imitate every single one of these. &gt;&gt; But go back into your heart and ask yourself this morning, have I heard the cry? Have I heard the voice? [Music] Have I seen the revelation of the mighty angel opening the mysteries to me? Do I know whom I'm following today? Christian Life Tabernacle will not get you there. David McGuri will not get you there. There's only one thing that transform you and that's the word of God. Thus sayaeth the Lord spoken from the word of God. You marry that. Let that become your husband. [Music] A man came to me and it broke my heart. He said I I perceive.
