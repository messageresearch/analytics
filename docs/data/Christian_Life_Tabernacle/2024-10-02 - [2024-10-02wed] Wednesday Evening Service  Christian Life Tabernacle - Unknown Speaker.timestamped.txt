[29:41] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[29:43] pray
[29:45] amen amen uh Brother David had a he had
[29:48] a procedure done uh in his mouth I
[29:50] believe it was a crowning in his uh uh
[29:53] mouth and uh uh he was numb and he's
[29:57] having difficulties is just speaking
[29:58] properly so he wanted us to just
[30:01] continue off the tape we listened uh
[30:03] last Wednesday so let's just open our
[30:05] Bibles and read the scripture before we
[30:09] uh we continue so it was
[30:16] Revelations chapter
[30:23] 3 let's read verse 21 a very familiar
[30:27] scripture read
[30:29] it says to him that
[30:32] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[30:34] in my throne even as I overcame and am
[30:38] sat down with my father in his throne he
[30:42] that heareth the he that hasn't hear Let
[30:45] Him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[30:48] churches amen so I believe last time we
[30:52] stopped around about paragraph 82 or 84
[30:55] I believe at the end of 82 so we're
[30:58] going to continue on 83 and we'll listen
[31:01] to just about 30 minutes of it uh which
[31:04] will lead us all the way to I believe
[31:07] it's uh paragraph 142
[31:12] amen amen so we'll do that uh again just
[31:16] remember Brother David I know he wanted
[31:18] to be here and um but he he understood
[31:22] that he was having difficulties just
[31:24] speaking correctly so he decided not to
[31:26] be hereen amen and so let's just go on
[31:29] and and and start from 183 and sorry I'm
[31:33] sorry 83 all the way to 142 amen God
[31:37] bless you may have your
[31:41] seats she started out as an overcomer
[31:44] but she never did overcome or she left
[31:47] the
[31:47] denomination she did she walked out of
[31:50] Sodom of L but she wanted to go back and
[31:54] have her haircut you know anyway she had
[31:58] go back she just couldn't stand the the
[32:01] test she had to look back again to see
[32:04] what the rest of them was doing oh you
[32:05] know I had some good friends down there
[32:07] after all and after all this might be
[32:10] just a little a little move I don't know
[32:12] whether it could be right or not I've
[32:13] only got this man's word for though he's
[32:17] my husband but yet uh your pastor is
[32:20] your husband spiritually speaking you
[32:21] see now whether it it could be a ride or
[32:24] not I don't know maybe his Revelation
[32:27] wasn't right
[32:30] then if you're not perfectly satisfied
[32:32] you're not perfectly know that it's the
[32:34] word of God then then you can't
[32:36] go you got to be really sold out that's
[32:39] right you got to know Hallelujah not
[32:42] just well I see others doing it I see a
[32:45] sign you know Israel started out I could
[32:47] say the same thing and bring it in here
[32:49] they started out two million strong and
[32:52] ended up with two
[32:54] man amen right they saw the works of God
[32:58] they saw the manifestation of the spirit
[33:00] they saw Great Mighty Miracles being
[33:02] done there in Egypt and everything it
[33:04] started out but it wasn't in their heart
[33:08] they didn't overcome they just come out
[33:09] and Jesus said and they perished in the
[33:12] wilderness and are eternally
[33:17] dead every one of them is dead that
[33:19] means Eternal
[33:22] separation every one of them rotted in
[33:24] the wilderness but there was two men
[33:27] Joshua and Caleb and when it come to The
[33:30] Showdown the obstacles was so great
[33:32] because they look like grasshoppers side
[33:34] of joshu screamed out with Caleb and
[33:37] said we are more than able to do it why
[33:40] God
[33:41] said and they were
[33:44] Overcomers they
[33:46] overcome they was the ones that was
[33:48] privileged out that whole great
[33:50] organization of people that take the
[33:52] real elected bride into the promised
[33:56] land Joshua C and the front lines out
[33:59] there as the two generals L them right
[34:01] down to the river and cross the river
[34:02] over into the promised land why they
[34:05] believe the word no matter what the
[34:08] Nathan ra naan brother raised up and so
[34:10] did Kora and they tried to say this
[34:12] man's trying to make himself above all
[34:14] the rest of us he's more holy than the
[34:15] rest of them after God had thoroughly
[34:17] ADV indicated the man they said we'll
[34:19] just start a group of people we'll make
[34:21] this that other we'll make our
[34:22] organizations we do and they died and
[34:25] perish
[34:28] but those men had that word of the Lord
[34:31] and they stayed with it and they went
[34:33] over not he that starts he that
[34:38] finishes many start the race but there's
[34:41] one finished there will be many churches
[34:44] start many groups of people there'll be
[34:46] one group finished amen that's the
[34:49] Overcomers Lots days yes she had to have
[34:53] that one great long look back oh I'm
[34:56] leaving so and so down there them fine
[34:59] times we used to have I'll never forget
[35:01] it she was clocked shut up like it was
[35:04] in the days of Noah she was shut out
[35:08] without mercy and she perished and the
[35:11] the lump still stands there today they
[35:15] claim I don't know you can break a piece
[35:17] off of it and it'll grow back a salt
[35:20] pillar if you ever see that uh picture
[35:24] of Sodom and Gomorrah you'll see the
[35:27] original a pillar of salt that stood
[35:29] there now there's a difference between a
[35:31] pillar of salt and a pillar of
[35:34] fire you have turn one notice in John
[35:39] the Baptist
[35:41] time in John the Baptist time there was
[35:45] found six that had overcome all ages
[35:48] they've had
[35:50] Overcomers in John's time they had six
[35:53] that was Joseph and Mary Zachariah and
[35:56] Elizabeth Simon and an a man and a woman
[36:00] a man and a woman a man and a woman see
[36:03] type of Christ the church Christ the
[36:04] church Christ the church amen notice it
[36:08] starts from the natural man no mo Joseph
[36:12] the natural man Joseph what was he a
[36:16] carpenter then the priest what was he
[36:20] see a
[36:21] minister in the house of the Lord
[36:23] Zachariah and from that the s a prophet
[36:27] amen and a prophet see thech
[36:30] justification sanctification baptism of
[36:32] the Holy Ghost don't you see perfectly
[36:36] six
[36:38] overcome all the rest of them they
[36:40] offered their sacrifices and everything
[36:42] but these were elected they
[36:47] overcome notice each Church
[36:50] age the same
[36:53] overcome when they each some out of each
[36:55] Church age overcome the temptation of
[36:59] that
[37:00] age I got the scriptures here I don't
[37:03] think we really have time to make it but
[37:05] you know each one of the churches same
[37:08] now it's just like someone who is see as
[37:13] I said at the beginning you're born
[37:16] defeated and that birth can never bring
[37:19] you to to uh life because you're born
[37:24] defeated and you're in a defeated world
[37:27] amongst defeated people among defeated
[37:30] Creeds uh defeated denominations you've
[37:33] got to come to Victory some way it's
[37:36] just like a
[37:38] lily where is a lily I think is one of
[37:41] the most pretty flowers that there is
[37:43] I'm very fond of those great cow lies
[37:46] and pond lies I think there's nothing
[37:49] hard as pretty as a great big a Pond
[37:51] Lily call it water
[37:53] lily how it's
[37:56] radiance and where does it come from
[37:58] it's a little seed down in the bottom of
[38:01] a muddy Mucky
[38:04] Pond and that little seed yet all the
[38:08] radiance that'll ever shine in it is in
[38:12] it right then when it's in that
[38:14] mud but it has to
[38:17] stri daily knowing that there's
[38:20] something it's black it's dirty it's
[38:24] mocky it's slimy and that's slime that
[38:28] it's living in yet it presses its way
[38:31] through the mud the
[38:33] MU and the waters in the stagnant places
[38:37] until it sticks its head above in the
[38:40] light and expresses what's been hid in
[38:43] it all the
[38:45] time I think that's an
[38:48] overcomer at once in
[38:50] sin once did things that was
[38:53] wrong don't worry about it
[38:56] now once did things that was
[38:59] wrong
[39:02] then uh
[39:04] now why look back into the pond
[39:09] again see look you have God by his
[39:14] predestination see has brought this seed
[39:18] to life and it's pressing
[39:21] itself see coming to life and now on top
[39:26] of all of that
[39:28] it has
[39:30] overcome see it doesn't Express itself
[39:33] down there it's getting up to express
[39:35] itself neither did you and your your sin
[39:38] and adultery and everything that you
[39:40] lived in you didn't Express that but
[39:43] there was a seed in there and it got a
[39:45] chance to press itself into life and now
[39:48] you're in the presence of Jesus Christ
[39:50] with the sunlight it brought out what
[39:52] you really was in the
[39:55] beginning you see what I mean you saw
[39:58] the light you blo down you laid your
[40:00] heart open and now you're a
[40:03] lily you remember my sermon on the
[40:06] Lily reverent Lily how he
[40:09] TS yet does he not spin and yet Solomon
[40:13] all his glory is not a ra like one he's
[40:16] he he he he look at him he's ready to
[40:18] get he takes nothing for
[40:21] himself the Lily don't care nothing
[40:23] about
[40:24] himself what does he do he he thrs his
[40:27] Beauty out his
[40:30] life that others might
[40:33] see his life is expressed out that
[40:36] others might see the glory what's in him
[40:39] that was in him in that mud now he's on
[40:41] top that's the Overcomer he overcome the
[40:45] mother he overcome the things of the
[40:47] world and now he freely gives himself
[40:51] out everybody can look at him his life
[40:53] you can't put a finger on
[40:55] him he's a real over coming you can't
[40:58] say nothing about him now would say come
[41:00] out of the mud but he's not in the mud
[41:01] now he's on top of it amen you can't
[41:04] find for back what he was what is he now
[41:07] amen he's on top then the bee comes by
[41:10] and said that wonderful perfume I
[41:12] believe I'll go and get my part he just
[41:14] opens up his heart come on I'm all right
[41:17] everything takes from him see he's he's
[41:21] a real Pastor he expresses the glory of
[41:24] God and look where he come from he had
[41:26] to overcome to do that one time he or
[41:29] she was young Fair
[41:32] beautiful they had a lot of Temptations
[41:34] to go through but they overcome that see
[41:37] they overcome now the express the real
[41:39] beauty of Christ in their life
[41:43] notice expressing through the mud Jesus
[41:46] gave us the example how to do it now we
[41:50] want to know how to overcome Jesus told
[41:53] us how to do it see humility
[41:58] sked himself duck a towel wash the
[42:00] disciples feet and wiped him the very
[42:03] God Of Heaven hum humiliating
[42:06] himself we don't want to be humiliated
[42:09] that's the reason women don't want their
[42:11] hair to go that's right the reason they
[42:14] don't want to dress like ladies should
[42:15] dress like man don't want to see it's
[42:17] the same thing they don't they they get
[42:20] humiliated but Jesus constantly look who
[42:23] he
[42:25] was greatness
[42:28] um go to say
[42:29] something greatness hum humiliates
[42:33] itself gra humbles itself
[42:37] great I've had the privilege of getting
[42:40] meeting some great
[42:42] man and if these guys has got a change
[42:45] of clothes and 50 cents in their pocket
[42:47] and rattle that's the guy that thinks
[42:50] he's something with he
[42:52] know but I stood a great
[42:55] man I me great man with ragged sleeves
[43:00] cuffs may make you think you're the
[43:02] great person see greatness is
[43:06] humility don't forget that church
[43:10] greatness is expressed in
[43:14] humility not how fine you can be I don't
[43:17] mean dirty now I mean humble in spirit
[43:21] amen I don't mean just get get out and
[43:24] over wash and clean up that you should
[43:26] do that you know that
[43:28] but I'm talking about humility genuine
[43:30] humility not something put on something
[43:33] it is that's real
[43:37] humility Jesus told us how to do it he
[43:41] overcome mean overcome means to stand
[43:44] the test that's right like uh all the
[43:49] old Saints did like Jesus did in midst
[43:52] of all of his enemies he stood the test
[43:57] everything he was tested against he
[43:59] stood it in the very face of sickness
[44:02] and him being Messiah he
[44:06] healed in the face of death he brought
[44:09] it back to
[44:11] life in the face of calvary's own death
[44:14] he defeated it by surrendering himself
[44:18] why by the word that you destroy this p
[44:21] and all raised up in three days the word
[44:24] said
[44:25] so and in the presence of death he
[44:29] defeated he overcome death in the
[44:32] presence of hell he defeated hell and
[44:34] overcome
[44:35] hell yes in the presence of the Grave he
[44:39] overcome the grave amen why all by the
[44:42] word in
[44:44] humility oh my there's the real man
[44:48] there's the one that make your example
[44:51] see he defeated everything overcome it
[44:54] look Temptation was for him
[44:58] you know that the Bible said he is
[44:59] tempted in all points like we are yet
[45:02] without
[45:03] sin he was tempted by by drinking he was
[45:06] tempted by women he was tempted by
[45:08] everything that could be tempted by he
[45:10] was tempted by everything that we are he
[45:12] was a
[45:13] man yet you couldn't put a mark on
[45:17] him yes
[45:20] Ser overcome needs to recognize the
[45:23] devil in every one of his tricks a lot
[45:25] of people says there is no devil just a
[45:27] thought don't you believe
[45:29] that there's a real devil amen just as
[45:33] real as you are anybody a real devil and
[45:37] you must recognize him real you must
[45:40] know he's a
[45:41] devil then the same time that you you
[45:44] recognize him and know it he's a devil
[45:46] and he's against you then to overcome
[45:49] you must recognize that the god in you
[45:51] is greater and mighter than he
[45:53] [Music]
[45:54] is that the one
[45:57] that's in you has already overcome him
[46:00] and by his grace you're more than a
[46:03] match for
[46:04] him there's real
[46:06] overcoming when you recognize you look
[46:09] back say I'm doing this and I'm doing
[46:11] that you're
[46:13] defeated but there's no condemnation to
[46:15] them which are in Christ Jesus that walk
[46:18] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[46:21] then you realize that you've overcome
[46:24] and you know that he's a devil you can't
[46:26] say I got a sick
[46:27] I don't believe it is a sickness oh yeah
[46:30] it is a sickness you got cancer you
[46:32] don't believe it is a cancer it is a
[46:34] cancer it is a cancer but remember
[46:37] greater is he that's in you than he
[46:39] that's in the world you must realize
[46:41] that the Holy Spirit that's in you has
[46:43] already overcome this
[46:45] thing and he is in you and you can
[46:48] overcome by him that's exactly sensible
[46:52] exactly the way the scripture is written
[46:55] overcome I got to that I got 45 minutes
[46:58] now I'm really running over time now
[47:00] notice overcome the god that's in you is
[47:04] greater than the one that's in him the
[47:06] god of the world is not as great as the
[47:09] god of Heaven which is in you no more
[47:12] than Darkness can stand in the presence
[47:15] of
[47:16] light now Darkness cannot stand in the
[47:20] presence of life I don't care how dark
[47:23] it is light will put it out amen
[47:27] it can't
[47:29] stand Glory but you take as much dark as
[47:32] you want to and try to stand against
[47:34] light one time see what happened that's
[47:37] the one that's in you is light amen and
[47:40] the one that's in the world is Darkness
[47:42] amen so the light has proved to overcome
[47:45] the darkness and a man that's in Christ
[47:48] and knows that he's overcome the things
[47:49] of the world Amen hey man has no more TI
[47:53] to you all you're free walk in the light
[47:57] amen as he is in the light and the blood
[47:59] of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin
[48:02] and we have Fellowship one with
[48:04] another there you are he that's in you
[48:07] is greater than he that's in the world
[48:09] now if you look right you're condemned
[48:11] then you're you're still in the world
[48:14] but if you're living above that then he
[48:16] that's in you has led you above the
[48:19] darkness like the Lily he's above the
[48:22] darkness of the mud he's above the
[48:24] darkness of the Muddy Waters he is in
[48:27] the light reflecting the beauty that was
[48:30] put in him before he left the
[48:34] mud Hallelujah now I feel like shouting
[48:39] praise God Christian what was in there
[48:42] by
[48:43] godall at the beginning it pressed its
[48:45] way through overcome it overcome the
[48:48] shell it overcome the mud had overcome
[48:52] the waters had overcome everything I was
[48:55] an overcomer and reflected the beauty
[48:58] and glory of God that's the way every
[48:59] believer does that's the way Noah did
[49:02] that's the way lot did that's the way
[49:05] look what a mess he was in that's the
[49:07] way Moses did that's the way Joshua did
[49:10] That's the Way Daniel did that's the way
[49:12] Shadrach mishak did that's the way John
[49:15] the Baptist did Zachariah
[49:17] Elizabeth that's the way that Simeon
[49:20] that's the way that
[49:21] Anna every one of them did they overcome
[49:25] the mud that was around them and packed
[49:27] into
[49:29] them stuck their head above the thing
[49:33] and shine forth the glory of God that's
[49:36] what a real Christian does remember
[49:39] Jesus showed her how it's
[49:41] done 40 days of Temptation he was
[49:44] tempted above any man that ever could be
[49:46] tempted in the temptation of Jesus
[49:49] Christ watch he showed us how it's done
[49:53] I I will close just in a few minutes
[49:55] look he showed us how it's done how did
[49:57] he do it by the
[49:59] word that's how he did for he was the
[50:02] word and the Jesus said if you abide me
[50:05] in my words than
[50:07] you you're back the word again am the
[50:11] Word of Promise what is the Word of
[50:12] Promise to every Christian greater is he
[50:14] that's in you than he that's in the
[50:16] world then how do I overcome not me but
[50:18] the word that's in you the word is God
[50:22] then I'll overcome the things of the
[50:23] world because it's a word in me if you
[50:25] abide me
[50:27] my words and you then just ask what you
[50:28] will just keep pressing up you're coming
[50:31] to the top as sure as anything see you
[50:34] got to come to top it's 40 days of
[50:36] Temptation by God's word he
[50:39] overcomes I want to express something
[50:42] here just for a few minutes Satan made
[50:44] three major assaults upon
[50:47] him and that Temptation watch this
[50:50] always in three don't forget me he made
[50:53] three major assaults from the highest to
[50:55] the lowest he tried his best to conquer
[50:58] him but he was a
[51:01] word what did he use himself the
[51:05] word Satan's three major attacks or
[51:09] assaults app point but he made it with
[51:12] the word every attack he can make it
[51:15] with the
[51:16] word watch this now from the highest to
[51:19] the the first he made his attacked upon
[51:21] to use his great power which he know he
[51:25] was the word he know his
[51:28] position you believe he did I the son of
[51:32] man he know his position and Satan come
[51:36] and want him to use his own
[51:39] power on
[51:41] himself the feed him want to feed
[51:44] himself he's hungry a man gets hungry he
[51:46] can do almost anything he'll steal Rob
[51:49] beg bar
[51:51] anything see that
[51:54] appetite and Satan used his first great
[51:57] major assault upon him to take his power
[52:01] that he had been given to overcome with
[52:03] and Ed it on himself he didn't use it on
[52:06] himself no he used it on others amen
[52:10] that's right he used it on others not
[52:12] himself it wasn't far
[52:13] here though he could have done it yeah
[52:16] he certainly could have done it but see
[52:18] how the devil gets the devil wants you
[52:20] to mind
[52:21] him he minded only what the father said
[52:24] to Hallelujah that's right he said by S
[52:27] say it's written you give the angel
[52:29] charge he said yes but it's also
[52:32] written there he are see he knew who he
[52:34] was Satan did the thought runs deeper
[52:36] than what it's wrote see it's
[52:39] inspiration the kernel is on the inside
[52:41] of it you see what it really is though
[52:43] he could have done he didn't do it but
[52:47] he he never paid heed to Satan's
[52:51] proposition now here's a good thing see
[52:54] sometime Satan can take you and when you
[52:59] think that you're doing the work will of
[53:01] God and can make you a proposition
[53:04] you'll fall
[53:06] apart yes sir you sure
[53:09] can now let's just take for instance
[53:12] like our sisters they're pretty and he
[53:16] can get you to a place that you let your
[53:18] hair grow out you didn't realize it
[53:20] looks so nice on you the first thing you
[53:21] know you get kind of feeling a little
[53:23] stuck
[53:24] up a little above something else some of
[53:26] you man you know what I
[53:29] mean see and he can take that same thing
[53:32] and proposition it with you right you
[53:35] got to overcome that you remember you're
[53:37] living for God you have one objective
[53:40] and that's Jesus Christ out side of that
[53:43] there's nothing else counts that's him
[53:45] and secondly for your family then
[53:47] thirdly for yourself but first for God
[53:52] next for your family next for you you're
[53:55] number three that's in the road you put
[53:57] yourself last he did look what he could
[53:59] have done but I could call my father
[54:02] speak to him me straight way send me 12
[54:03] Legions of Angel one could destroy the
[54:05] world that if my kingdom is this world
[54:08] and I subject to th but my kingdom is of
[54:10] above there he are see could have done
[54:12] that but he
[54:14] didn't though he could have done it he
[54:16] never listened to Satan's proposition
[54:19] now have you heard people
[54:21] say if if you believe there a Divine
[54:24] healer if you're a Divine healer Go Get
[54:25] Your Divine healer I got a man over here
[54:27] sick I'd like to see him healing is that
[54:29] same devil amen he's trying to
[54:31] proposition with you he's trying to make
[54:33] you listen to him instead of God but a
[54:35] real true servant of God will listen to
[54:37] see what father
[54:39] says like the little stats clip baby
[54:42] when they sent over here M said brother
[54:45] Brandon I called from Germany there was
[54:47] an American army with one of their Jet
[54:50] Plane sitting out here at the field

[55:35] like that lady we'll never let the baby
[55:37] leave the hospital let it lay right here
[55:39] you stay right here with it that's all
[55:40] right brother St went seen the Army and
[55:43] major they said sure we will find him
[55:46] over bring him back and there was a
[55:48] plane setting waiting to take me over
[55:50] that morning R me back at night to
[55:52] Germany hi highberg Germany for the
[55:55] resurrection of this baby I said sure
[55:56] God can do it but let's see what he
[55:59] willing then I went out prayed all night
[56:01] nothing happened come back the next
[56:02] morning nothing happened and I started
[56:05] into the room just then I looked there
[56:07] and there stood that light hanging there
[56:08] in the door said don't put your hand on
[56:11] that don't rebuke that that's a hand of
[56:13] God I got her on her phone I said sister
[56:16] St be your baby it's a hand of the lord
[56:19] it's God's will something Happ that baby
[56:22] down along the line you leave it go
[56:24] right where God knows where it's at you
[56:25] can go to it now that lives you won't
[56:28] you leave it right like that that great
[56:30] Lutheran preacher in Germany wrote a
[56:33] letter and said how I can appreciate
[56:35] what brother Brandon waiting for that
[56:36] clear-cut decision of God before he said
[56:38] anything that's it oh to God's decision
[56:44] no matter what others say whatever it is
[56:45] don't proposition Satan at all if Satan
[56:49] says now water baptism name father that
[56:51] he proposes you leave it alone God said
[56:54] otherwise he said you're a good man man
[56:56] you don't have to be your good woman you
[56:57] don't have to do don't you proposition
[56:59] if the word says something different you
[57:01] stay with the word what is that's the
[57:04] example Jesus give to you and there's
[57:06] that major assault see that he made on
[57:08] you then the second assault a hurry just
[57:11] look like your time just go so fast the
[57:14] next greatest assult was that he made
[57:16] upon him that he would be a
[57:19] show and how that does hit God's servant
[57:23] to be a show off to show what you can do
[57:26] glory to God hallelujah I'm a deliverer
[57:29] I'm
[57:31] so come up here on top of the temple and
[57:33] sit down here he tempted him to do it
[57:36] now remember he was tempted to do it
[57:38] yeah hard so now if you want to be
[57:42] something before the people stand up
[57:44] here on this Temple Jump
[57:46] Off see I'll give you the scripture
[57:50] for because it's written he give the
[57:53] Angels charge over thee that's any time
[57:54] that Dash your foot against the stone
[57:56] bear the up to make him aure to show his
[58:00] authority no true servant of God ever
[58:02] does that you see a man showing off his
[58:05] chest out and all like that just
[58:08] remember there's something wrong there
[58:09] amen no God don't want that Jesus set
[58:13] the example he could have done it he
[58:16] certainly could have done it but he
[58:17] didn't do it no servant of God is a show
[58:20] off of himself to try to take God's
[58:22] power and show himself above somebody
[58:24] else you remember Moses did that you
[58:27] remember God gave him power to do
[58:31] whatever he wanted to made him a prophet
[58:33] he walked down to that rock and he spoke
[58:35] the rock the second time that was
[58:38] against God's will God said speak to
[58:40] that rock don't Smite it again you break
[58:44] all the all the the type here the Rocks
[58:48] only go to be smitten once but he spoke
[58:50] of the weakness of the word when he did
[58:52] that it wasn't sufficient yeah the word
[58:55] was what was going on that rock was the
[58:57] word see he first time he smoked the
[58:59] Rock and the waters come forth and then
[59:02] they got thirsty again he said now go
[59:03] back and speak to the Rock he only
[59:05] smitten once see the insufficiency of
[59:08] the word Moses testified to it the word
[59:12] wasn't right he had to be smitten again
[59:14] so Moses went down there and smoked the
[59:16] rock like that said come forth didn't
[59:19] come forth so he spot it again and said
[59:22] come forth I command you to come forth
[59:25] the water come God said come up
[59:29] here come here you glorified yourself
[59:33] you took my power instead of sanctifying
[59:36] me you Sanctified
[59:39] yourself now you're not going over in
[59:41] look over see what it looked like but
[59:43] here you going to leave right here oh my
[59:46] there never has been one like Moses you
[59:48] know oh no when he come to that show off
[59:52] with Jesus he said get up on the temple
[59:55] here and jump off he said it's written
[59:59] amen don't temp the Lord thy
[1:00:02] God he met him with the word that every
[1:00:05] major assault old true servant ever
[1:00:09] tries to show himself off with God's
[1:00:12] power if he does he loses right then
[1:00:15] third great
[1:00:17] assault Satan offered to Forfeit this
[1:00:21] Kingdom to
[1:00:22] him he did Satan said see came into the
[1:00:26] world these are
[1:00:29] mine I'll do with them whatever I want
[1:00:31] to I'll forit them to you but you
[1:00:35] remember he was trying to get into
[1:00:37] forfeit it without the
[1:00:39] cross if he did we'd be
[1:00:42] lost he could have touch the
[1:00:45] kingdom but he must follow the he must
[1:00:48] come back he was tempted to do it
[1:00:50] now death's a hard thing he was tempted
[1:00:55] to take Liberty and be the king of the
[1:01:00] earth without the cross but if you did
[1:01:04] his subject would have die Satan would
[1:01:06] have gladly made that proposition with
[1:01:08] him but he said get behind
[1:01:11] mean he didn't good he come and suffered
[1:01:15] and took the hard rugged route he took
[1:01:18] the route of persecution he took the
[1:01:21] route of death are we this morning
[1:01:23] willing to do take that same route that
[1:01:26] he take are we willing to die are we
[1:01:29] willing to give ourselves up to God far
[1:01:33] all the world and things to serve for
[1:01:35] him now he failed to do it willingly to
[1:01:39] to Forfeit it Satan was to him but he
[1:01:41] didn't do it though Jesus was tempted he
[1:01:44] overcome for
[1:01:46] us
[1:01:49] he he endured all Temptations for me and
[1:01:53] for you see he could CH it right then
[1:01:58] but what did he take the other route for
[1:02:00] so that we could come be with him and if
[1:02:03] he paid such a price as that then how
[1:02:06] little would we
[1:02:08] be not to take
[1:02:11] it when you remember there's nothing
[1:02:13] here
[1:02:14] anyhow right if you live a 100 years why
[1:02:17] you go to come to mental in your mind
[1:02:19] gone all crippled up and old and shaky
[1:02:22] that's where you're going that's right
[1:02:24] and that's the end of it you come now
[1:02:27] overcome the things how do you do it by
[1:02:29] the word amen what the word says you do
[1:02:33] walk humble live before Jesus he
[1:02:45] endur all
[1:02:47] right that is so
[1:02:50] practical it is the word in its
[1:02:54] reality it's not some concept or some
[1:02:57] education that you go learn and no it's
[1:03:00] something that you put in
[1:03:02] practice I I just I wish we could
[1:03:06] continue
[1:03:07] but there just so much I just thought if
[1:03:11] you go back from where we
[1:03:13] started he's basically it starts with
[1:03:16] Lot's
[1:03:17] wife so really the understanding is it's
[1:03:21] not just because you started it means
[1:03:23] you're going to overcome
[1:03:26] overcoming is not just starting because
[1:03:28] many started you know many received the
[1:03:31] word I mean even this message of the
[1:03:34] hour you think about the crowds that bam
[1:03:36] was able to put together when he started
[1:03:39] and how many people came through the
[1:03:40] meetings and everything but when you
[1:03:42] follow it all the way towards the end he
[1:03:45] was not even invited out of
[1:03:47] places many came and they heard and they
[1:03:50] follow but it was not to just follow
[1:03:53] because he talks about years Lot's wife
[1:03:56] he says she started off as an overcomer
[1:03:58] but she turned into a pillow of
[1:04:00] salt why because she was not all in it
[1:04:03] she still had something that she wanted
[1:04:05] to look forward to and something that
[1:04:08] she had in her heart that wanted to look
[1:04:10] back amen that's why when we come to
[1:04:13] Christ we come everything we don't leave
[1:04:15] anything behind and when we become a
[1:04:17] Christian we don't try to walk the line
[1:04:20] between the Fellowship of the world and
[1:04:22] the fellowship of God no we break every
[1:04:25] line we break every connection
[1:04:27] everything we come all hard ourselves
[1:04:30] everything that we are we jump into it
[1:04:33] with everything that we have why because
[1:04:35] if you have something tying you back it
[1:04:37] will take you back the the the the thing
[1:04:41] about you know that's why you hear it
[1:04:43] says it's the word and nothing else it's
[1:04:45] because if you try to mix the word of
[1:04:48] God with anything any measure of of of
[1:04:51] uh of of yeast any measure of anything
[1:04:55] will cause it to overflow and to blow up
[1:04:59] that's what Eve started in the Garden of
[1:05:00] Eden the scripture says that she was
[1:05:02] given the pure word of God a pure word
[1:05:05] of God don't eat off the tree but what
[1:05:07] did she do she took the LIE of the devil
[1:05:10] as being God's truth and it caused the
[1:05:13] whole thing to fall
[1:05:15] apart and bham says that was the cause
[1:05:18] for every hospital every sickness
[1:05:21] everything that we see today it was
[1:05:22] because someone tried to take the word
[1:05:25] and mix it with leaven with something
[1:05:27] else someone took the pure word that was
[1:05:30] given and tried to mix it so it's by the
[1:05:32] pure word of God that we overcome it's
[1:05:35] not by try to mix it with anything else
[1:05:37] it's the pure word that we go with and
[1:05:39] then he talks about Israel paragraph 84
[1:05:41] it says you know Israel started out it
[1:05:44] says I could say the same thing uh it it
[1:05:47] bring them here it says they stand out
[1:05:50] two million strong and ended up two men
[1:05:56] it it always starts out with the crowd
[1:05:58] right it always starts out with the
[1:06:00] group of people rejoicing and jumping up
[1:06:02] and down and everything but at the end
[1:06:05] it's only the elected that would
[1:06:07] stand I I love it because here it is he
[1:06:11] talks about that and then right over he
[1:06:13] jumps over he says he talks about he
[1:06:16] jumps in and it says paragraph 85 it
[1:06:19] says but there was two men Joshua and
[1:06:22] Caleb he said uh when he came to The
[1:06:24] Showdown the it says the obstacles was
[1:06:28] not so great till they look like
[1:06:31] grasshoppers uh on the side of them
[1:06:34] Joshua screamed out with Caleb and said
[1:06:38] we are more than able to do it he asked
[1:06:42] why God said so so the difference is the
[1:06:46] Overcomer only stands upon the word of
[1:06:48] God it's the Word of Promise that would
[1:06:51] carry them it's not by their own
[1:06:53] strength it's not by their own education
[1:06:55] it's not because they've gathered up
[1:06:57] enough knowledge and now they feel they
[1:06:59] can do it no the Overcomer knows that
[1:07:02] I'm here because I have received a
[1:07:04] promise and within God's promise God has
[1:07:08] the ability for that promise to carry
[1:07:10] you through I I I'll just say it I was I
[1:07:13] was uh um I was just listening but when
[1:07:16] I'm speak some in the message uh El
[1:07:19] Sharia and he talks about Abraham and he
[1:07:22] says that here Abraham was and he said
[1:07:25] he went waited and he waited for the
[1:07:26] promise of God and and yeah he was
[1:07:29] getting old and we know how he speaks
[1:07:31] about El shadia said he was the breasted
[1:07:33] one so he came and andam speaks he said
[1:07:36] he come and he text Abraham and he said
[1:07:38] I want you I want you to to nurse the
[1:07:41] strength out of me and and receive
[1:07:43] strength so you can carry on and all of
[1:07:46] that and at one place but said the
[1:07:48] promise that was given to him continued
[1:07:52] to sustain him for the 25 years that he
[1:07:54] was waiting
[1:07:56] so it wasn't by Abraham's strength that
[1:07:58] he received the promise it was the
[1:08:01] promise that God gave him when he says I
[1:08:03] will give you a child that promise was
[1:08:06] good enough to take him through trial
[1:08:08] through Temptation through the ups and
[1:08:11] down everything that he went through
[1:08:13] that promise kept him because he was a
[1:08:15] recipient of the promise the child could
[1:08:18] not come by anybody else except
[1:08:22] Abraham and and so when we are gathered
[1:08:25] here
[1:08:25] when we receive the promise of the
[1:08:27] Rapture it doesn't matter what else the
[1:08:30] devil can throw on your way is it a job
[1:08:32] that you need is it the sickness that
[1:08:34] comes by your way is it this is it that
[1:08:36] you can know for sure that because I
[1:08:39] have received a promise I am able to
[1:08:42] overcome because I cannot God will not
[1:08:45] take me off of this Earth until that
[1:08:47] promise come to
[1:08:49] pass so it's the assurance that a True
[1:08:52] Believer has within thems to know that
[1:08:56] Joshua and Caleb as they stood there
[1:08:58] they know I have received God told us
[1:09:01] we're going to overcome this we didn't
[1:09:03] it's not us just coming up and say oh we
[1:09:05] want to overcome by our own Tre no we
[1:09:07] received this was the promise that God
[1:09:10] made us that this land belongs to us so
[1:09:12] it didn't matter if we look like
[1:09:14] grasshoppers it didn't matter they knew
[1:09:17] that the promise will produce the
[1:09:19] strength they needed in order for them
[1:09:21] to overcome the
[1:09:23] land so it's always by promise that's
[1:09:26] why when we go to pray you you it's very
[1:09:29] important you rem by what promise am I
[1:09:31] standing here by what promise am I
[1:09:33] praying I'm sick by what promise you
[1:09:36] said in your word it's by your Strife
[1:09:38] that I'm Healed so I claim the promise
[1:09:40] that you have given because remember the
[1:09:43] promise is not some future event the
[1:09:46] promise is the presence of God walking
[1:09:49] with you because the word of God is God
[1:09:51] himself so if he gives you his word he
[1:09:54] gives you of himself
[1:09:56] self sometimes we think well I have the
[1:09:59] word of God now I'm waiting for God no
[1:10:01] his word is
[1:10:03] himself you have the word of God you
[1:10:05] have God
[1:10:10] himself so he said God said
[1:10:14] so and they were
[1:10:17] Overcomers they overcame it says they
[1:10:20] overcame there was one there was one
[1:10:23] that was uh uh uh privileged out of the
[1:10:28] whole great organization of people to
[1:10:31] take to take the real elected bride into
[1:10:35] the promised land Joshua and Caleb in
[1:10:38] the front line out there as the two
[1:10:41] generals it said LED them right down to
[1:10:44] the river and cross cross the river into
[1:10:48] the promised land why they believe the
[1:10:51] word no matter what amen amen oh if we
[1:10:56] could just come tonight and say Do you
[1:10:58] have do you have trouble yeah I have
[1:11:00] trouble but I believe the word no matter
[1:11:02] what do you have difficulties yeah I'm
[1:11:05] going through difficulties I don't know
[1:11:07] how to solve this this is going on
[1:11:08] that's going on but I believe the word
[1:11:10] no matter what oh I'm sick I believe the
[1:11:13] word no matter what I don't have a job I
[1:11:15] believe the word I need the Holy Spirit
[1:11:17] I believe the word no matter what
[1:11:19] because within that God will produce it
[1:11:22] it's not for you to produce it it's for
[1:11:25] him to produce it through the promise
[1:11:27] you leave the promise you're not going
[1:11:29] to get it you stay with the promise it's
[1:11:31] bound to
[1:11:38] happen and it says here now in paragraph
[1:11:42] it says it says now he says but those
[1:11:46] men now speaking about those Overcomers
[1:11:48] those men had the word of the Lord and
[1:11:52] they stayed with it they went
[1:11:56] over because they stayed with the word
[1:11:59] it says not he that
[1:12:03] started he that finishe many started the
[1:12:07] race but there's one finishing it there
[1:12:11] will be many churches start many groups
[1:12:14] of people there will be one group
[1:12:17] finished that's the
[1:12:20] Overcomer it's him that finishes you
[1:12:24] know the script says many will say where
[1:12:26] is the sign of his coming you know since
[1:12:29] our father slept everything continues
[1:12:31] the same Wars this is not the first time
[1:12:34] they heard about wars it's Wars and wars
[1:12:36] and Wars but there will be those that
[1:12:39] will finish it why because regardless no
[1:12:42] matter of what was happening they
[1:12:44] believe and they held on to the word now
[1:12:47] and then after he says this he speaks a
[1:12:49] great deal about uh just how many uh the
[1:12:53] Overcomers you will find out as you
[1:12:55] continues on that they were always found
[1:12:57] in the minority it's not it was never uh
[1:13:00] all that started it was never a group of
[1:13:02] people or a majority that started the
[1:13:05] the Overcomers were always found in the
[1:13:08] minority so then he jumps on from there
[1:13:10] now he says but the Overcomers are only
[1:13:14] the elected now think about it so he
[1:13:17] speaks about Lot's wife he comes and he
[1:13:19] speaks about those that overcame and
[1:13:21] then he goes over the next thing for the
[1:13:23] characteristics of those that over come
[1:13:25] you will find out that are they are only
[1:13:28] those that are elected to overcome so if
[1:13:31] you're going to overcome is because you
[1:13:33] were elected to
[1:13:34] overcome it's not because you mastered
[1:13:37] up the strength enough to you to go and
[1:13:39] overcome no it's because God in the
[1:13:42] beginning before there was a sky before
[1:13:45] there was a heaven before there was
[1:13:46] anything he thought about you being here
[1:13:49] he thought about you being an overcomer
[1:13:52] and that only in itself will make you
[1:13:54] over come no matter what the challenge
[1:13:57] is so he says but these were elected
[1:14:01] they overcame so he speaks about in the
[1:14:04] paragraph 92 he says and I see I I said
[1:14:08] in the beginning you are born
[1:14:11] defeated and that
[1:14:13] birth can never bring you to life
[1:14:17] because you are born defeated and you
[1:14:19] are you are in a defeated World among
[1:14:22] defeated people among I just love this
[1:14:26] among defeated Creed defeated
[1:14:29] denomination you've got to come to
[1:14:31] Victory
[1:14:33] somehow I love it you say why you love
[1:14:35] it because there's no hope for this
[1:14:37] flesh if if if if we only going to go by
[1:14:40] this flesh if we only going to go by
[1:14:43] natural birth where we came from who
[1:14:45] were our parents every we are already
[1:14:47] defeated to begin with if we are only
[1:14:50] counting on our ability to study the
[1:14:52] Bible to know the scripture you you just
[1:14:55] you you're not going to make it the only
[1:14:57] reason was because there was a seed that
[1:15:00] was planted in the beginning the seed
[1:15:02] that was planted in the beginning is
[1:15:04] made to overcome so therefore it doesn't
[1:15:07] matter what this flesh came from whether
[1:15:10] the flesh came from Africa it came from

[1:17:11] it's markets everything I don't think
[1:17:13] God wanted me because if God wanted me
[1:17:15] to serve him I should have been looking
[1:17:17] at the sunshine no it's going to get to
[1:17:20] the sunshine in the process of pressing
[1:17:23] in the process of going forward in a
[1:17:25] process of pushing I do wrong I don't
[1:17:27] want to do wrong I'm gonna continue I
[1:17:30] say this I don't want to say this I'll
[1:17:32] continue it continue to push until it
[1:17:35] find itself in the presence of the
[1:17:43] sonallah that's what an overcomer is
[1:17:46] andam will say that it says paragraph
[1:17:50] 94 I think that's an overcomer that once
[1:17:54] in sin
[1:17:55] once did the things that was wrong don't
[1:17:58] worry about it now once it once did
[1:18:01] things that was wrong then now why look
[1:18:05] back into the pond again
[1:18:08] see look you have it says God I love
[1:18:12] this by pred by his predestination see
[1:18:16] has brought the seed to life and a
[1:18:20] pressing itself see coming to light and
[1:18:24] now now on top of all that it's it's it
[1:18:28] it's it's it has overcome see it it
[1:18:32] doesn't Express itself down there it's
[1:18:35] express it says it's it's getting up to
[1:18:38] express
[1:18:39] itself neither did you in your sin
[1:18:44] adultery every anything that you lived
[1:18:47] in you didn't Express
[1:18:53] nothing you said when you were drinking
[1:18:56] you had the seed in you oh yeah when
[1:18:59] when I was doing wrong I was lying and
[1:19:01] stealing and and doing wrong there was
[1:19:04] yeah there was a seed in there but it
[1:19:06] was not it couldn't Express himself in
[1:19:08] that environment it took the sunlight to
[1:19:11] shine upon that seed and to hit the seed
[1:19:14] for it to look at the drinking and say I
[1:19:16] don't want to drink anymore to look at
[1:19:18] the Li and say I don't want to lie
[1:19:19] anymore to look at all the things around
[1:19:21] you and say I don't want this anymore
[1:19:23] and he started pressing itself
[1:19:27] out that that's the very character
[1:19:30] characteristics of a Believer without
[1:19:32] that you're just a a church
[1:19:34] member without that you're just a church
[1:19:37] member it's when you look at your life
[1:19:39] and say I know what I used to be I know
[1:19:41] what I was capable of but if I can live
[1:19:44] this life today it's not by My Own
[1:19:46] Strength something happened to
[1:19:48] [Applause]
[1:19:51] me there has to be that within you that
[1:19:54] you can look and look at what you were
[1:19:56] and look at what you are today and see
[1:19:59] that something has been pressing
[1:20:01] on something was pressing on when when I
[1:20:05] was lying something was pressing on and
[1:20:07] when I was cheating something was
[1:20:09] pressing on when I was doing all those
[1:20:11] things something has been pressing on
[1:20:14] it's going to continue to press to press
[1:20:17] till the Rapture the pressing doesn't
[1:20:20] stop it's not because now you came and
[1:20:22] you recognize God the Press no the
[1:20:24] pressing will continue every day you do
[1:20:27] wrong de pressing come down and said
[1:20:29] stand up son you're not supposed to do
[1:20:31] that let's carry on we have a job to do
[1:20:34] we have a mission to
[1:20:36] finish God doesn't start a job that he
[1:20:39] hand up halfway no when he starts
[1:20:42] something he brings it to the
[1:20:50] end you didn't Express nothing
[1:20:55] need to be aware of
[1:21:00] time don't do
[1:21:04] that but there was a seed in
[1:21:08] there and it got a chance to press
[1:21:10] itself to the
[1:21:11] light oh God thank you for the seed
[1:21:15] thank you because the overcoming is the
[1:21:17] seed of God inside of me that's driving
[1:21:21] me every day that's leading me that's
[1:21:24] that's taking me out of the trouble that
[1:21:27] I get myself every day I get myself in
[1:21:29] trouble today the seeds get me out I do
[1:21:31] wrong tomorrow the seeds gets me out why
[1:21:34] it's taking me to a destination and if I
[1:21:37] keep my eyes on that promise I keep my
[1:21:39] eyes on that seed I will surely get to
[1:21:42] the destination if the musician could
[1:21:44] come that's just one page
[1:21:48] so there's no way if I go through every
[1:21:51] page it's just going to we're not going
[1:21:53] to ever finish it's just wonderful and I
[1:21:56] just want to say and I think this is how
[1:22:00] God wants us to view ourselves he he
[1:22:03] wants us to know to to to know to be
[1:22:06] aware that we are constantly a work in
[1:22:09] progress that when we we we need to keep
[1:22:13] our focus on the seed that is inside of
[1:22:15] us and upon the promise that's been
[1:22:18] given us he doesn't want us to be
[1:22:20] because remember says when he speaks
[1:22:22] about the devil he says one of the
[1:22:24] things he wants you to do he wants to
[1:22:26] take your focus away he wants you to
[1:22:28] worry about
[1:22:29] him so he he he he's he's like a a
[1:22:33] magician so he's putting the action here
[1:22:36] trying to get you to look upon him oh I
[1:22:38] want to do this I want to do this
[1:22:40] whereas he actually moving and and I
[1:22:42] thought about even the very text or that
[1:22:44] very um message that brother uh brother
[1:22:47] Matthew read about the the devil when it
[1:22:50] was asked when the chat CPT was asked
[1:22:52] about if I was the devil how how is it
[1:22:55] that I can influence you so it's never
[1:22:57] him coming bluntly and saying don't
[1:22:59] serve God it's by him causing you to
[1:23:02] look for something else look for a job
[1:23:05] that's going to pay more look for a
[1:23:08] success over here look to achieve this
[1:23:10] look to it and neglect the very seed
[1:23:13] that's inside of you to overcome with
[1:23:16] that's right cause you to neglect the
[1:23:19] very word of God that you need to
[1:23:20] continually feed on so you can become
[1:23:23] stronger always is causing you to keep
[1:23:26] you sidetracked so you can keep your
[1:23:28] focus on him causing you to try to use
[1:23:30] your power for yourself causing you to
[1:23:32] try to show off causing you what was it
[1:23:35] it was the same way that he came to
[1:23:37] Jesus say but when I'm said here so he's
[1:23:39] constantly trying to uh create a
[1:23:41] diversion something for you to look at
[1:23:44] uh look at this new uh uh uh uh news and
[1:23:47] there's always something new out there
[1:23:49] if you want to look at it there's always
[1:23:51] something new that the devil has to
[1:23:53] offer and new way of doing things a new
[1:23:55] way of thinking but at the end of it
[1:23:57] it's all death it's not taking you
[1:24:00] anywhere what is it doing it for because
[1:24:03] if you keep your eyes on those things
[1:24:06] then you lose the focus on your growth
[1:24:08] and your ability to overcome the things
[1:24:11] of the
[1:24:15] world you get to a place where why am I
[1:24:18] not overcoming I need to check am I
[1:24:21] actually relying on the sea that's
[1:24:23] inside of me am I actually recalling the
[1:24:26] promise that's been given to me because
[1:24:29] that's what I need in order for I me to
[1:24:30] live an overcoming life I'm not doing it
[1:24:33] by myself it's not by my strength but I
[1:24:36] know one thing that I'm here I'm hearing
[1:24:39] the word of God I'm eating of the word
[1:24:41] of God I'm relying on the seed that's
[1:24:43] inside of me to grow and I know that
[1:24:45] when that seed will grow it will give me
[1:24:48] power to overcome the challenges that
[1:24:51] I'm facing to overcome the things that
[1:24:53] surround me it will give me power to
[1:24:56] make the right decisions it will cause
[1:24:58] me to say things the right way it will
[1:25:00] cause me to live a life that's pleasing
[1:25:02] to him now remember he said this it will
[1:25:05] strive to obey the word even when people
[1:25:09] will try to come to you remember it was
[1:25:10] talking about that baby was sick oh you
[1:25:12] can pray for it you can do this they
[1:25:14] said no you have to wait on what he
[1:25:18] said you it's not going to try to cause
[1:25:20] you to show off what I'm a Christian I
[1:25:22] should be able to do this no
[1:25:25] what does God want me to do why because
[1:25:28] it's by the word and
[1:25:31] humility if Christ himself are humble he
[1:25:34] says he humiliated
[1:25:39] himself you know I just wonder how many
[1:25:42] how many of us wants to be humiliated
[1:25:44] somebody humiliate you oh my
[1:25:48] goodness you're just about to have let
[1:25:50] them have it but Christ humiliated
[1:25:55] himself deity came and became flesh
[1:25:59] became a man so what so that we could
[1:26:03] become
[1:26:05] God greatness he says is
[1:26:10] humility greatness can be spit upon
[1:26:13] those soldiers spitting upon him say
[1:26:16] binding is is his eyes and saying tell
[1:26:19] us who hatte you that that they doing
[1:26:21] that to Greatness
[1:26:24] but greatness didn't even open its
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:33] mouth that's the quality we should go
[1:26:36] after those are the qualities we need to
[1:26:39] seek to ask for every
[1:26:42] day not the ability to come and prove
[1:26:46] something even when you know no it's the
[1:26:48] ability to be humble even when you
[1:26:51] know and not to stay there as if if you
[1:26:54] didn't know somebody you know you
[1:26:56] remember they were talk about he says
[1:26:58] Oham was not able to come and everything
[1:27:00] and he's standing right there said oh I
[1:27:01] couldn't do
[1:27:04] that
[1:27:06] greatness humbling not humbling but
[1:27:09] humiliating itself let's all
[1:27:13] stand and if we can just ask tonight if
[1:27:16] our heart's desire could just be God I I
[1:27:19] want I want that kind of overcoming
[1:27:22] attitude that kind of greatness that
[1:27:25] could humble itself and not because I'm
[1:27:28] a Christian then I become something more
[1:27:30] than somebody else no but regardless of
[1:27:33] what person I meet whatever position
[1:27:35] they are in that I can reach out and
[1:27:37] help them that I can go and reach out
[1:27:41] and look at my fellow men and look at
[1:27:43] them with compassion and help them in
[1:27:45] the situation that they are going
[1:27:48] in understand that God placed me there
[1:27:50] for a reason for me to be a help and not
[1:27:53] to boast of myself and what I can what I
[1:27:56] can do and what I can show off but the
[1:27:58] ability for me to humble myself even
[1:28:01] even when I'm hurt even when people have
[1:28:04] done me wrong but I can humble myself
[1:28:06] and keep loving them because remember he
[1:28:08] he talks about love is not when you love
[1:28:11] people that love you real love is when
[1:28:13] people hate you and you know they're
[1:28:15] going to do you wrong when they get a
[1:28:17] chance to but you still love
[1:28:21] them that's the overcoming attitude
[1:28:25] and that's what we
[1:28:26] desire not just the Miracle part of it
[1:28:29] but the humility part of it and and and
[1:28:32] that other part that can humiliate
[1:28:35] itself so one could be saved so one
[1:28:37] could receive
[1:28:39] also is that your heart desire tonight
[1:28:42] amen let's just bow our heads our
[1:28:44] gracious

[1:29:07] and your ability Lord and that's why
[1:29:10] your Prophet will say that God is is
