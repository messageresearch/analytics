we thank you this morning as we get ready here today may you be with us oh god we thank you for your presence already in our midst as we come on the expectation to hear from you oh lord may prepare our hearts to receive you we thank you again our god may you be with you with us and see us through the end [Music] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen hey man god bless you this morning wanna welcome everyone in the house of god and then trust you're happy to be here together amen god in the presence of the lord you're gonna invite for the mic for our psalm reading amen good morning we're gonna read psalm 96 this morning you know it opens up with the verse oh sing unto the lord a new song you know that caught my attention obviously i started to think about singing what does it mean to sing unto the lord really does it mean that the lord enjoys listening to music that he's looking for some background music as he works you know there's something that the lord is looking for here something that when his prophets speak of singing unto the lord a song you know david said it many times isaiah said it several times scripture after scripture sing unto the lord here's a question just because music plays in church or on the radio or on your iphone and it plays a good old gospel song or a worship song and you sing along with it are you necessarily singing unto the lord or are you just singing along with music that you enjoy or that blesses you or that you think is a good message we know what a song is it's it's words arranged according to a specific melody a specific cadence that declares a message it's a specific word with a specific tone and a specific beat and singing is when your lips take up that message and your body takes up that melody and that beat and you become a vessel for delivering that message you know there are many reasons why you would have your body your lips to become an instrument for a song because your flesh likes the melody or the beat because your mind likes the words because your heart likes the feeling or the emotion that it generates you know generally those that take up a song are generally testifying to the fact that they identify with or are subject to that song but what does it mean to sing unto the lord you know as we read into psalm 96 it describes what singing unto the lord is it says in verse 2 sing unto the lord bless his name show forth his salvation from day to day verse 3 declare his glory among the heathen his wonders among the people you know singing unto the lord is when he is glorified in the singing when his wonders and his work are being made known it says sing unto the lord verse 3 declare his glory unto the heathen so singing unto the lord is someone taking up a song and declaring to the heathen the glory of the lord but how often do we take a song that's written by the heathen and try to glorify the lord with it you know as i've mentioned before i i always like to find the first time in the scripture that a phrase is mentioned because usually more often than not it sort of defines what it means when the scripture uses that phrase does anyone know the first time that singing occurs in the scripture it's in exodus 15. it's immediately after the lord prepares a way through the red sea for his people and defeats the enemy that troubled them you know he had we all know the story he had the children of israel that were trapped with the sea on one side and the enemy on the other and in exodus 14 13 it says and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever and then we all know what happens in the very last verse of psalm 4 of exodus 14 says this and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses and the very next verse exodus 15 1 starts this way then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and the rest of the chapter is what singing unto the lord looks like you know the children of israel sang not because they liked the tune not because they liked the beat or not even because they liked the words they were singing a song in response to the work that god had done for them in fact this song had never been sung before it was a new song in response to a work that god had done for them no one else could sing that song like them you know they were giving witness to what the lord had done for them personally you know that's singing unto the lord the rest is just singing somebody else's song you know in the book of revelation we have examples of different groups of people singing a song unto the lord you know they could sing because it specifically declared the work that god had done for them in revelation 5 9 it's the song of a people redeemed of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and in revelation 14 3 it's the song of 144 thousand who were the first fruits of god and neither people could truly sing the other person's song you know singing a song unto the lord doesn't necessarily involve music and it doesn't necessarily mean you can't sing another song but singing unto the lord is when that song is you declaring the work that god has done for you and no one else can sing your song you know make sure you're singing about the works that god has done for you and every time god does a new work for you you can sing a new song you know so as if nothing else it says in psalm 96 2 show forth his salvation from day to day so you know as we read psalm 96 this morning you know let's follow david's advice and sing a song unto the lord sing the song give witness to the work that he has done for you personally and don't take up someone else's song but make sure he gets the glory for the work that he has done so let's read psalm 96 together it says o sing unto the lord a new song sing unto the lord all the earth sing unto the lord bless his name show forth his salvation from day to day declare his glory among the heathen his wonders among all people for the lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the nations are idols but the lord made the heavens honor and majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his sanctuary give unto the lord o ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength give unto the lord the glory do unto his name bring an offering and come into his courts o worship the lord in the beauty of holiness fear before him all the earth say among the heathen that the lord reigneth the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved he shall judge the people righteously let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad let the sea roar in the fullness thereof let the field be joyful and all that is therein then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the lord for he cometh for he cometh to judge the earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth amen amen god bless you may have your seats [Music]

of what that you've done for each of us lord how you sought us and you found us lord and we were purchased with a price that none could ever pay to buy us back oh god be so wonderfully set in the palm of your hands we love you father and we ask that you help us overcome give us victory over this flesh that wars against your spirit lord we ask that you touch us and feed our hearts today by your word we ask these things this morning in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning i'd like just to read one little quick scripture i that i thought was a blessing before we have brother john come preach for us if i can find it here i don't know if i can find it but in reading and if it struck me i put my marker wrong but the scripture says let this mind be in you that was in christ i thought can you imagine if there ever a battle we're in today it's the battle to to get a hold of your mind the way you think the way you decide so much stuff coming into us trying to get it and then the scripture simply says let this mind be in you that was in christ you know and i thought oh god to think like you think amen that would solve a lot of problems well that's why we come to the house of the lord today is to hear the word of god and hear what god thinks and we have brother john baduca with us this morning he's from togo and uh he preaches in english so but he's got one of those texas accents that are hard to uh understand so listen close and and let the word of god bless you and as we have them come this morning and and greet you i really think that you'll enjoy the word of god but i always enjoy hearing people from other places is just simply because you see the gospels the same no matter what part of the world it is people have experienced the touch in the hand of the lord jesus brother joel it's good to see you this morning i hope you're doing better lord touch you thank you god bless you so brother john god bless you this morning i call him big john i don't know why and uh i really think you'll enjoy our brother he loves the lord and so we'll just turn the service to you this morning brother john thank you god bless you without fear of favor amen god bless you you can be seated for the meantime praise the lord amen i set this opportunity this morning to greet our pastor mr david god bless you i greet the officers of the church and i greet the entire church as the pastor has already said my name is john baduku i come from togo i pasteurized idea by the grace of god i come to visit america and i have been to meet a pastor in missouri and but he liked me and i also like him and i appreciate him so much and he wanted me to come and fellowship with you i thank him for bringing me i thank our precious sister the wife i have been blessed being around them and i've been blessed being among you i thank god for making it possible that i come to meet you nice brothers and sisters who love the lord i will love the message of the earth this morning i feel like i'm among my own people i believe the right time that we are going to share together will be a blessing let us burden us as we pray our precious and heavenly father with our heads and our hearts bow before you we thanking you sincerely for the great and the marvelous things that you are doing in our life lord we know with you there's nothing like coincidence all things are pre-planned you need this day before the foundation of the world and you know i'll be preaching here you know the number of people that will be present you know where they will be seated and the very dresses that they will be putting on thank you for making it possible lord as we are guided together we want to hear from you we want to hear from your throne of grace you are the author of your own word lord may you come and speak to our house this morning meters are the points of our needs transform us and draw us closer unto yourself even as we are approaching the word which doubted the meeting cannot be complete we pray and commit the scriptures we are going to read to your care without you who is interpreter of your own word come and interpret it unto us this morning in the name of our lord jesus christ bless our pastor bless the wife the family bless the officers of the church and bless the entire church father we thank you in jesus name we pray amen let us turn to our feet and respect the word of god we want to read a well-known scripture from first corinthians the 13th chapter i want to reach the 10th vest and then to match you the fifth character and the 48th verse by when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be gone away matthew 5 48 be there for a person perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect may the lord add his breathing of the word you may be seated yeah we thank the lord this morning for the scriptures read believe this is a well-known scripture unto you all maybe some might have even read it this morning before coming here but i want us to look at it for a few minutes we finally hear that speaking to us about that which is perfect but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be gone away and hear paul speaking to the corinthians talking about the preeminence of love the mass of love showing them that love is unfailing he talked about speaking in tongues prophecies and all those things knowledge mysteries that he end up saying we know in part and we profess her in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be gone away and the second scripture tells us say be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen now we find out here that paul trying to point the corinthians to the perfect thing and trying to explain to them that when that which is perfect is calm that which is in part shall be gone away trying to make them know that to let that which is impact be gone they need to make way for the perfect thing to come and when the perfect thing comes automatically all that is in part shall be gone away i tapped it to light this morning you know when light comes on or you go to our rooms and we fish on the light automatically darkness vanish and all that are hiding in darkness will also vanish i want this to ponder about it for a few minutes and i want to attach on my summon this morning i want to take it from this creature that we have read but when that which is perfect is calm when that which is perfect is come in the message the prophet was talking about this he says first corinthians that he says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be gone away with so all these things so all these little things of jumping up and down like kid like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word we divine vindication then that which is in part is gone away with when i was a child i speak like a child as a child i understood as a child when i became a man i put away childish things amen he went on to say in another verse he said now i think i just went through that didn't it didn't i and when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be gone away with paul said though i speak with tongues of men and of and angels and i do all these things here but when that which is perfect just come now is there anything perfect but god amen there's nothing perfect but god therefore if we are talking about a perfect thing coming in then we should understand that we are talking about god taking charge of us taking control of our life like paul said it is not me that lives but it is he that lives and when he comes in he takes control of everything said in the beginning was the word and the word what is god there were still god all right when the witch is perfect is come then that which is in part is gone away amen when that which is perfect is come then that which his impact shall be gone away and according to the quote that i've just read he talks about god being perfect the word of god being perfect and we found out that god is a perfectionist when we go to the beginning everything that god created it created it in its perfection the vegetables the vegetations the animals even we human beings the scripture said god created us in a perfect condition before the fall man was perfect man has dominion in the garden of eden but when sin came in that perfection was broken thank god that is bringing us back to that profession and he's coming one of these days for the bride and is coming for a perfect bride not an imperfed bride but a perfect ride a bride that is perfect from head to toe and this bride must be a wet bride and for us to be a wet bride we must allow the word of god to have dominion in our life like jesus christ was saying i in he i in them and them i in in in him or in them and they in me that oneness need to come and when that oneness comes it changes us it transforms us it makes us better and worthy christians we are living a time when we need to look for the perfect thing that is the only solution to our problems that is the only solution to our needs that is what will transform us that is what will make us be closer be drawn to the lord when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be gone away the prophet in the crosshairs he said the line that was in the hocks in the stock and in the tussle in the hawks all goddess in the siege and we are in the seeding time when the the real seed of god will be made manifest went one way to the other way justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again manifested itself amen and amen when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be gone away if we go to psalms the 19th at the 18th chapter verse 30 we found out that god's ways are perfect and it is god that give us strength it is god that makes our way perfect amen when that which is perfect is come into our life it changes our life it changes our worship it changes our prayer it changes our home changes our thinking it changes our way of doing things we know within in the world we've been in the denominations and we have gone with first interpretation of the word but thank god that he sent us a message and that message came with the true interpretation of the word like the prophet said when the seals were opened the bible became a new book we understood it in a different way even though the dimensions determinations had that same bible but there are many things they cannot see that we by the grace of god who has been called out of them who has the true interpretation of the word of god our worship is different our way of doing things is different our understanding is different brand is a lot what i want us to look at this morning is to allow that which is perfect to come in when that which is perfect comes we will no longer struggle in our worship we will no longer struggle to do the will of god we will no longer struggle to come to church we will no longer struggle to pray we will no longer struggle to fast we will no longer struggle to reach the word of god because that which is perfect has come and has come to take control therefore it's not going to be immense effort any longer but it is god himself doing it in us because the time has come that month idea has to come to an end man's effort has to come to an end man's worship has to come to an end man's effort has to come to an end and for this to come to an end we have to allow the perfect to come and that perfect is god himself and when god take control in our life we are changed completely christ is coming back again and he's coming for a perfect ride like the prophet said he's not coming for a bride that is spiritually crippled no it's coming for a bride that is perfect from head to toe spiritually speaking and that bride must be able to receive the fullness of the word into a womb and be well impregnated and that is what changes us when we are word impregnated it changes us automatically it's just like a woman that has married and has taken the seed of the man even though the woman was not want a change in her life once she is taking the seed of the man all her efforts to remain the way she was will be she can even go by birth to touch her belly but that see that is in air will start changing her we'll start changing her face will start changing her belly will start changing her her way of working and it will reach a place certain things that she enjoys so much she has to forget about i want to say this morning that if that which is perfect is come unto you all that you used to be will be changed that woman maybe he liked setting food so much when they marry newly if the husband goes to work and does not bring that food she is offended but when she took seat he doesn't want to smell that food at all amen when the food goes near her she'll pour that is how it is spiritually there are many people today they are struggling struggling to live the word of god they are struggling to pray they are struggling to please god but this morning my advice to you is allow that which is perfect to come in and when that which is perfect is come all the imperfections in your worship all the profession in your life all the imperfections in your home who have to flee because that which is perfect has come amen it will not be our own idea again it will not be family idea again when that which is perfect is come and god is expecting us in the time that we are living in that the bread must come to maturity the bride must be a word on two feet and for us to be able to reach that standard we need to allow that which is perfect to come in amen when that which is perfect is come all that is in part shall be gone away nowhere in is this according to scripture was a perfect man he lived a perfect life in his generation he could live a perfect life because he accepted the word of god in his totality and he lived it he was preaching the word and he was living the word even though there were challenges in those days noah was able to mount over those challenges he did it not by his own effort he did it not by his own wisdom he did it because he has accepted the fullness of the word and that is the perfect thing we can only live a perfect life when that which is perfect is come into us and if that which is perfect is come unto us all that we do will be perfect our marriages will be perfect event advice will be perfect whatever we want to do we'll do it perfectly we will not do it for doing sick we're not doing because we cannot control ourselves we will not do it because everybody likes it no we will do it because amen that which is perfect is in us it's influencing us it's moving us it's inspiring us is it it is taking us to the will of god is taking us to the plan of god what we need today is the perfect thing amen god because he wanted a perfect bride he sent a perfect message to prepare a perfect bride amen he sent us a perfect prophet a perfect message to prepare a perfect ride and he is coming for a perfect ride he is not coming for a church member he is not coming for a so-called christian no sir he is coming for a perfect ride and as you all know the bride will be taken from the church the church is not going to the rapture but the bride is going and the pride is the word bride the bride is the one that accepted the fullness of the world we are living a time when many are living the world they are backsliding the way from the word the way we came across the message the way we were burning like fire the way we were zealous the way we could fast the way we could separate ourselves isolate ourselves and be studying the message even in the week we are able to read two or three message books we can't find it again this time there is some sort of coolness there's also backsliding there's some sort of weakness people are taking things for granted they want to do it their way of thinking they want to do it the way it pleases them they want to do it the way it favors them but i want to say this morning that when that which is perfect is calm hallelujah you will not do it otherwise than the way god wanted this to be done when that which is perfect just come if we go to ezekiel the 28th chapter verse 15 he talks about satan satan was found perfect in his way to begin with satan was perfect but when sin was found in satan he fell from perfection i want to say this morning that many are failing are falling from perfection and they are not the way they used to be they are not burning the way they used to bend they are not sealers the way they used to be they don't love the message the way they love it initially all because they have backslided many a times it takes the grace of god in one's life to know he has backslided if god has not given you his grace you will not know you have backslided you may think you are the man you used to be meanwhile you have backslidden like like something you know samson was born for a purpose he was anointed for the purpose but he came to a time when he left the word of god when he forsaked the instruction that god gave him the spirit of god that was upon him left him the power of god left him he thought he used to be the man he is when they told him the philistines are around he's chewed as if he would be able to do something he couldn't do anything meanwhile he has grieved the holy spirit the holy spirit has left him he left the commandment of god he left the will of god and they arrested him they shave his head he became a useless person usually in the sense that he has failed god he has failed the purpose of which god brought him on earth he has come out from the will of god and we found out that the philistines were using him for a drama amen but thank god that he recognized himself and he prayed that lord remember me once more remember me once more and the scripture said god visited him again god gave him back his training again and the philistines the people he killed that day outnumbered the people he killed all his life something when people hear his name they run for their life they don't even want to mention where is he coming from which direction is coming from his name alone scared them but when he left the word of god he became powerless many christians are powerless today all because they have left the word of god i thank god that god served as grace for us he's rich in mercy he is calling us back to come back to our first love to come back to our position to come back to where we left him to allow that which is perfect to come in when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be gone away whether which is perfect is come hallelujah in our homes there will be peace in the home the confusions in the hope will be gone the misunderstanding in the hope will be gone when that which his spirit is come into a young man's life had a lawyer in the youth's life they will know how to approach their marriage they will not marry because i am growing they're not married because i cannot help it no they will look for the will of god amen i said they will look for the will of god they will bring it before their pastor they will not go to take the vow before letting the apostle know it no they will seek their choice of their pastor when that which is perfect is there we are living a time when god is not moving the way he's supposed to move in the bride thinking that we can speak in tongues we can jump all those things perfect if i do them and i do not have love i am nothing amen and that love that paul is talking about is god himself if you do all those things and you don't have the fullness of god you are nothing gifts satan can imitate them let us not base our hope on gifts gibbs can fail satan can imitate gifts satan can operate gifts but the word of god is the only thing that satan's here and you can only defeat satan by the word of god but that says a lot let us allow the perfecting to come in in everything we do let that which is perfect come all your struggles will be gone and it will lead you to profession like matthew the fifth chapter verse 40 says be therefore perfect even ask your father which is in heaven amen we cannot be perfect outside the word we cannot be perfect in our own wisdom we cannot be perfect by some creed or dogma we cannot be perfect by some mummy doctrine no say we can only be perfect by the word of god many men lived and god testified that they are perfect men a man like job job lead in the days when there was not even a bible he lived for inspiration but the scripture said god has to challenge the devil that there's no man on earth like job he was a perfect man he was a man of integrity he had evil amen and the prophet said god has confidence in jobs can we ask ourselves this morning that can god have confidence in us god has confidence in job can god have confidence in you that god has confidence in me god can only have confidence in us when we allow that which is perfect comes in when that which is perfect is come all that is not perfect shall be gone away jesus christ came as a perfect sacrifice and he gave us a perfect salvation because he was a perfect sacrifice if we can accept him wholeheartedly if we can give ourselves to him that sacrifice that he did once and for all will have an effect in our life a perfect sacrifice god is a god of perfection and everything god is doing he wants this to be done in a perfect way that's a scripture that i was talking about even when going to offer offer an offer an offering to god it has to be a perfect one but we found out that sometimes it is very difficult we make vows we make promises especially when we are graduated and we have not yet got a job we stopped praying if god gave me a job i'll do this i'll do that i'll do this but when god makes a way we get the job we forget about everything hallelujah but when that which is perfect is come all that is impact shall be gone away the scripture said let us leave the fundamental things let us leave the fundamental things many people today have stopped at justification others have stopped as sanctification but we need to advance we need to go further to the baptism of the holy spirit and when the baptism of the holy spirit takes place in somebody's life not the anointing of the holy spirit the real holy spirit the life of jesus christ coming back upon a believer he changes everything in his life he's changing his thinking he's changing his way of worshiping he changes his way of thinking he's changing his way of doing things and that man becomes a different person he becomes a an outboard to the world because god is operating in his life amen amen the scripture said those who have gone are waiting for us because they cannot be made perfect without us amen they cannot be made perfect without that we need to be ready the last ship has to come in for us to be completed for us to go and they will be completed the prophet preached a message and he entitled it the statue of the perfect man the statue of the perfect man we found out that he mentioned certain things certain virtues that need to be made manifest in our life we need to have faith wed upon words wed upon words wait upon words until we read that tattoos then we become perfect in christ jesus perfection is not in any church perfection is not in any man perfection is in christ jesus if we can come back to christ like we used to we will be made perfect when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be gone away and in everything will be found perfect amen as i will be perfect we will respect our pastor we respect the doctrine by which we are brought up i remember at home there were certain sisters that came to me they said pastor we want you to pray with us because we want to marry under your ministry we know what you are teaching us here and we don't want to go marry somebody who has been taught a different way who has a different understanding of the scriptures we will not have peace so we want to choose we want to accept a vow in this church because we know how we are taught breading is a lot we need revelation in our life we don't do things because of necessity we don't do things because we need to do it we do things because the word of god has provided a way for it we are living in a time when god's mind like the pastor said has been made manifest in this end time and we need to allow the mind of christ to reign in us and to allow the mind of christ to be in us we need to come under the handship of the world we need to come under the history of the message we need to come under the hellship of our pastor we need to come under the hershey of our husbands then we can say we have that mind amen and amen if i am to come under the hershey of god then it means my head needs to be taken away and his head put there then i can think the way he thinks i can see things the way he sees things hallelujah oh braziness he said the lord let us come back home let us come back to the message let us come back to our position let us come back into what god is doing in this end time let us come back to the reviver we shouldn't allow the revolver fire to die in us when he dies in you you have backslided you are able to do whatsoever you feel like doing but thank god that christ is coming it's coming for a bride it's coming for a wet bride a bride that knows no denominational doctrine a bride that not knows no man's doctrine a frightening bride virgin to the word very into their message verging to god now the church is coming true like the prophet said i read it now find out if if corinthians 2 corinthians 11 at 13th i believe it all well is that the first corinthians though i speak with tongues of men and angels both the kind that can be interpreted and that kind and that cannot be interpreted i am nothing so what the use of fooling within what is the use of fooling with it though i understand all the mysteries of god why do you go to seminaries try to lend so much about you better get right with god first certainly do i oh bless hallelujah we got so you got so you can't even have a congregation unless you have a healing campaign or some kind of miracle going on a week in industrial generation seekers after search why do you want with that paul said he could do all [Music] kinds of things even move mountains and still use nothing where the stones it will cease where there's knowledge it shall vanish where there's prophecies it shall fail but when that which is perfect is come it endures forever amen when that which is perfect is come it endures forever as i was saying many people have not got the real thing because the prophet said god cannot seal you and later regret for having sealed you and when he seal you he saves you until the day of your redemption so he makes sure who he is going to seal he make sure he sees a person and doesn't come back to regret god is god he knows our beginning from end he knows who we are he knows where we are going to be ended he has presented us he knows our end he knows who we are therefore let us look for that which is perfect when that which is perfect is calm it endures forever and love is perfection god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever shivers no say whosoever shakes no sir whosoever speaketh no say whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life believe that children amen many a times we take substitute substitutes we substitute the word of god for something else but all our substitute the things which we have substituted the word of god with cannot make us arrive at home the only way is to come back to the world the only way is to submit to god the only way is to accept the word of god the only way is to believe the word of god amen and amen we are living in a difficult time in togo now churches are closed you cannot worship we need to worship online this is a time that we know those who truly believe and those who truly did not believe those who have come yes to associate themselves with the church associate themselves with their message this is a time that they are fully will be made manifest i thank god that if that which is perfect is come in them in us like paul said what shall separate me from the love of god to be naked death poverty there's nothing that can separate me from the love of god once the perfect thing is there if there's something we need to point the people to today is that perfect thing because when that perfect thing is come we are deep rooted in the lord because there's going to be a move there's going to be wings there's going to be storms and once we are deep rooted in the wedge no storm can move us no wind can move us because that which is perfect is in us hallelujah when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be gone away let us examine ourselves this morning whether we have that which is perfect whether that perfect thing is in us amen amen that's what we need today and that is the manifestation of the word of god in our life that is where god is leading us to amen and that is where we can be united with him and that unity becomes an invisible union and when we are united with him we become one with him we think like he thinks we see things like he see things we have his mind amen the mind of god is in the bride and it takes the bride to recognize the voice of god because we are living in the days of many voices many voices you have to have the perfect thing to be able to identify the voice of god to be able to hear the voice of god amen you have to come out of every preconception to be able to hear the voice of god i remember in the days of naman when he was to go to the man of god for healing he went with preconception when he arrived the scripture said the man of god did not even come out to come see whether he's white whether he's called it whatsoever he is he only told him to go and wash himself in the river this man became anointed remember why there are better rivers in our home in our area why waste my time to come here and he wanted to even go back until his servant has to advise him and the scripture said where he came when he believed what was said he went into the water the first time the second time the third time before he finished with the number that he asked him to wash he became clean we need not to put our mind to the word of god god is suffering he doesn't need your contribution we are now called to reason with the word of god we are called to believe the word of god and stand by it and see god fulfilling it let that mind which is in christ jesus be in you amen brethren say a lord when that which is perfect is come many people today are struggling they are trying to make it but i believe this morning that we cannot make it ourselves why struggled when god has made a way for you why fight on your home where god is there for you he is there for you when he is to bring you perfection when he's ready to come in with that which is perfect whether which is perfect is come we get a perfect health because he is the god that heals our diseases and forgiveness is our iniquity whatever our problem is this morning i do not know but one thing i know one thing i'll point you to one thing i will advise you is allowed that which is perfect to come in when it comes in it will be automatic it will not be you doing it but it is he doing it it will not be you living but it is he that is living in you it is not you fighting but it is you it is he that is fighting the battle is not yours the battle is his let us come under the hershey of the lord the heroship of the message amen let us come under the hershey of the word the hershey of christ and all our struggles will be over when that which is perfect is come by which is impact shall be gone away let us accept god by his word let us allow other influences that are influencing us from the word of god and let us come under the influence of the word of god let us come under the influence of the message of the hour let us surrender everything to him surrender everything to jesus surrender your ways to jesus surrender your business to jesus surrender your family to jesus surrender whatsoever you are doing to jesus and he will take care of it because he is a master of all he has never failed and he would never fail the prophet said he said god didn't face something it was something that failed god god has never failed a man it is man who fails god when israel was coming from the promised land the scripture said they drunk from the rock and they left the rock but the rock followed them amen man has always been running from god been running from the will of god because ma want to contribute amen god provided everything for israel but they were never satisfied they wanted something else hallelujah brethren and scissors a lot that same spirit is working today is working among believers today is working in the christian dam today they are not certified with the plan of god they are not satisfied with the program of god they are not satisfied with what god is doing they want to contribute i want to say this morning that god doesn't need your contribution your contribution is failure to begin with because your contribution will be a carnal contribution will be a selfish contribution it will not help god so god doesn't need it amen we need god more than ever in the time that we are living is because this is a time of perfection this is a time the bride is coming to maturity this is the time that christ is coming back to take the bride home and this is the time we need god the more in everything this is a time we need god the more in whatsoever we are doing this is a time we have to let god lead us not we living god amen went david had a revelation to go bring the act of the covenant the scripture said instead of consulting nathan who was a prophet of those days he went and conducted consulted the generals the intellectuals and they allow him king must leave for long and he went to bring the ark of the covenant the scripture said they went the wrong way so when they were coming inside of life death king and fear grieve them all we need to carry the act of covenant the way god wanted us to carry it we need to allow the cat to be behind and the horse before it don't put the cat before the horse it will never work allow the horse to pull the cat allow the holy spirit to lead you allow the holy spirit to advise you allow the holy spirit to influence you brethren says a lot man has reached a place where he looks at how intelligent he is how strong he is how wise he is how rich he is how powerful he is and as a result they've taken god out of the program but when god is out of the program you are bound to fail the scripture said they have driven christ from the church he is no longer in the church and they are doing their own things but now he is at the door of an individual he is knocking the door of an individual he wants to come in and when he comes in he will die with you he wants to come in as that which is perfect and be an answer to your needs and problems my brother my sister we have left god many have left god just like mary and joseph when they went to the feast in jerusalem after the feast was over they left without jesus going without jesus and they never thought of it the first day ended they never come to themselves the second day ended they never come to themselves at the end of the third day then they came to themselves my brother my sister can you believe that this thing can happen it has happened so it is that many are going without god they left him somewhere they left him for three good days not even imagining not even thinking until the third day then they started looking where is jesus where is jesus where is the power of god where is the holy spirit where is the presence of god and the scripture said they started questioning one another joseph might have asked mary where is her son mary might have answered i thought he was with you they were all presuming time of presumption has come to an end because we have the revealed word we have just sailed the lord let us come from every presumption and the scripture said they needed to go back they need to travel three days again where you have left the lord that is where you can come to get him you can left him somewhere and be looking for him somewhere no where you have left him in your life where you have left him in your ways when you have left him by your way of doing things you need to go back there amen jesus said you can put a new wine in an old screen it will best no alteration new eye new bottle amen so they need to go back to where they love jesus and the scripture said when they arrived there jesus was busy having a ministerial meeting with the priests of those days when they saw him they were scared why have you made a suffering so much i and your father has been looking for you they look for him at the wrong time like it is today sometime when we come to church we allow our children to be playing when we play with other children and when we are ready to go the brother asked the sister was where's maybe james he said i thought james was with you and they will be argued over it brethren say lord jesus answered them he said don't you know that i have to be in my father's business my father is not joseph if my father would have been joseph i would have been in the cabinetry workshop but my father is god we need to be in our father's business and the only way we can be in our father's business is to allow that which is perfect to come in when that which is perfect is come all that is impact shall be gone away our problem today is not our pastor our problem today is not our brothers our problem today is not our sisters our problem today is not the church that we belong to no our problem today is we need the word back we need that which is perfect to come back and when it comes back everything will be okay hallelujah we have a peace we never had before we have the joy we never had before amen when that which is perfect is come it comes with everything it comes with a full puzzle full package it comes with all that we needed amen brandon said lord let us come out of man's influence when i said money influence what i want to say is our own influence and let us allow the power of the holy spirit to operate in our life it will lead us to the mind of god it's related to the purpose of god it deluded to the reason why god has called us we are not called to be here for being here sick no we are called with the purpose and the scripture said it is not he that is running it is not he that is willing it is god who gives rich if we can accept him if we can make way for him if we can allow the world to dominate us from head to toe we'll start seeing a change in our life and we'll stop complaining we'll stop pointing finger to one another and it's my husband and it's my wife i don't believe that our wife can prevent them from going to heaven from going to the rapture because an ex-wife did not prevent him from going am i right edna's wife will not prevent him from going all those who are complaining is because of my husband it's because of my wife it's because of this because of that i want to tell you the perfect thing has not come when the perfect thing comes no matter who your wife is who your husband is they can't stand on your way enoch the scripture said he walked with god several years and before he was translated the scripture said god was pleased with him hallelujah enoch was assembled and we are the type like i'm not going to the rapture we are also going to the rapture and if god was playing with enoch to be able to go to the rapture then we also need god to be pleased with us the prophet said arnold did not live by collective revelation he lived by an individual revelation revelation of the world people today are worshiping god by collective revelation i want to say you are failure to begin with i said you are failure to begin with a collective revelation will not make you make the heaven a revelation on the word of god revelation of what god wants you to be enoch i got the scripture for several years he pleased god which means that for all those years he did what was pleasing to god at the at the end of the day he went maybe he might have kissed the wife and select me just rolled a little and come and he walked to heaven the wife did not prevent him nobody can prevent you because you are a special person to god he knew you before the foundation of the world and at the right time he called you and he called you with your purpose and he is guiding his purpose in your life let us allow the perfect thing to dominate us for when that which is perfect is come don't forget it all that is in part shall be gone away let us examine our life this morning as i'll be bringing my sermons to an end what are the imperfections in your life imperfections in your life today you feel spiritual tomorrow you don't feel spiritual today you have the joy of your salvations tomorrow you lose the joy of your salvation today the holy spirit will speak to you tomorrow you start hearing another voice today you feel like a christian tomorrow you feel like you are not christian let that which is perfect come in and everything will be fitted every demon will be saturday those demons that are speaking into your ears that are having battle in your mind like the prophet said is that the greatest battle ever thought it's in the mind of god but that pattern can only be worn when that which is perfect is come greatness is the lord we are going to pray this morning but don't forget my topic when that which is perfect is come when it comes all that is imperfect shall be gone away and that which is perfect is not a gift it's not a sensation it's not speaking in tongues it's not a man but it's god himself the prophet said when god created a man he left a vacant place in his heart and he god want to come and build his throne there that by that throne he will lead you and a prophet call it a controller so that he can control you but today we've given those places to different things different things have taken that throne a place that is reserved for god and for god alone even scientists did not believe it initially but at the end of the day they found out that so it was that in a man's heart there's a vacant place there there's a place that is not occupied by a vein and god himself left that place there but he will come and tabernacle there so that he can lead you so that he can teach you so that i can influence you a controller this morning if we've given that place to whatsoever we've given it to it is time that we drive them away and allow that which is perfect which is god which is love to come and take that place that has come out from every substitution we've substituted god with many things you can never be satisfied if you have not got you the taste the taste that god has put in a man nothing can't take that place you may change it with other things but in duration time it will go and the taste will still be there it is god alone to feel that place if we can say this morning like paul said it is not me that lives but it is he that lives in me amen and if he leave lives in us what shall separate us from his love to be naked death to be single not to get the husband to marry not to get a woman to marry you wash your separators and nothing can separate us because we have the real thing and the real thing is god himself he is the only person that can feel us that can make us satisfied that does make us to be full we are going to pray this morning let us turn to our feet let us buy the heads we sing this song i surrender all to jesus i hope we know how to sing it [Music] so to jesus [Music] me it's present [Music] day [Music] is [Music] to savior [Music] [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] why we are singing this song if you want to be remembered in prayer why don't you lift up your hands [Music] when that which is perfect is come that which is impact imperfect shall be gone away maybe you want to be remembered in a way [Music] you know who you are you know your way better than i know it you know if that which is perfect is there [Music] or it's not there you want to be remembered in prayer [Music] our precious and mighty heavenly fathers we bother our heads in reverence your holy name we thank you sincerely from the death of our hearts lord we know divinity is not in heaven divinity is in man and we pray to the god that is in us precious heavenly father he's spoken to us this morning now when that which is perfect is come all the imperfections all that us that are in part shall be gone away lord your people have any hades they have lifted up their hands individually you are the designer of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you know what their hands represent as your servants i join my faith to their fate and i'm praying committing them to your care lord let that perfection break into their life that everything that is in part spiritually or physically be gone in the name of our lord jesus christ give them good health bless them spiritually and physically particularly meet them at the points of their needs father we thank you in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray and ask with thanksgiving thank you for having done it amen god bless i you believe that spoke to our hearts this morning amen you know it's you just got to address it individually and i i believe there's a desire in all of our hearts to be perfect and i think we all know where our imperfections are where we need more of the lord in our life you know when you try to fix something up maybe you buy a house that needs is in need of repair like sometimes our houses are in need of repair you just don't look at the whole thing and hope it all of a sudden gets fixed but you take one thing at a time one thing at a time i forget which general that brother branham was speaking about he said how did he take the victory he said he took at one city at a time one city at a time bring god into your life every day every situation one circumstance at a time when you come up to something and you don't know he's there you just know it right there's where you get you and god put it together when you're not thinking the way he's thinking right there is where you surrender every step you take when you encounter something in your life where he's not there right there get that right get that right and just keep marching getting everything right as you go and you'll find out what that is the prophet of god said when you when you have total deliverance it brings you a freedom like you've never known before amen if you've got those things in your life i know i have them in my life and i think well i'll just fix the whole thing no i need to fix them i need to invite him into my life every day every moment every decision bring it into the hands of the lord amen do you believe that this morning why don't you just take a moment and pick that one thing that you know is not right in your life and reach out to the hem of his garment and just say a prayer this morning lord i want to come back to you [Music] i've been a little backslid i know i've been backslid i know i haven't been living the way that i should live i know i haven't been reading my bible i'm not on fire like i used to be lord i'm just taking this moment to lift my hands once again and invite that perfection back into my life lord [Music] my [Music] you want to be free from something in your life [Music] is [Music] [Music] with [Music] trust in [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] oh just reach out touch the hem of this [Music] garment [Music] where my health comes [Music] trustees [Music] sickness [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sickness [Music] amen you know we certainly live in a an hour where there's so much trying to go on and where we hardly even know what the right way to think is but we know the way we heard this morning the way to think is by god's word and that's what satan wants to do he wants to cool us off he wants us to get just lukewarm where we don't think that there's any any repercussions or any results from our actions that everything just remains the same he wants to try to rob us away from all the power and victory we had and i thought his brother john preached he said if you start seeing that you've lost the power in your life maybe your backslid and that's all that satan wants to do is just get your backslid to make you ineffective i think we just need to take a step up this morning don't you and do that we're going to have a baptism this morning micah you can uh bohannon is going to be baptized this morning so andrew if you get your son and bring him and will baptism i know some of you may have to go but we are having communion and foot washing tonight we'd certainly like to invite you back one of the things that god certainly said that we would have to do to be there is water baptism communion and foot washing the three ordinances of god so in light of this sermon this morning ask yourself is there something that's keeping you from doing the things that god would have you to do and then just at that moment ask yourself you know am i putting him first or is something cooling me off and and i really think this is a timely message for us that we've got to press harder to the mark than we ever have before hey man so let's why don't we just sing a good song for her this will make it a dismissal song so and we'll sing it then if you need to slip out you can slip out and then those that want to stay for the baptism can certainly stay for the baptism so let's have a dismissal prayer father we ask that this word would set in our heart this morning and father that those that they have to go that they would keep this message ever burning in their heart father they really consider father the importance of what it means to serve you father i certainly don't want to be left i don't want the rapture to come and then my find myself here because i wasn't serious about your word and i just let myself become lukewarm and indifferent and i let the world rob for me all my victory father the very word of god said that the angels are going to and fro looking to those who are sighing and crying and even when john wrote the scriptures he finally summed up the whole book of revelations as he watched the the beasts go out and he watched the great harlot and he watched the spirits raging and he finally come to the end of it all and looked up and said even so come quickly lord jesus lord just to think that there's people praying for you to come quick lord i don't want to miss it because i didn't think it was worthy i don't want to miss it because i didn't i wasn't diligent towards the things that i was supposed to do i don't want to miss it because i thought my life was so eternally secure that i didn't have to lift a finger lord i want to prove to you i believe lord let me restore my faith let me restore my diligence let me restore my holiness let me restore my fire in my heart this morning lord bring us back to that passion for your word we ask that in jesus name we pray amen how about we say you're the only one [Music] amen let's sing it as your art dismissed if you need to amen oh you are not a god you are not a god [Music] anything we can [Music] is [Music] you're the only [Music] of god we can give to our god that's just [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now [Applause] you are on your throne [Music] that's just [Music] you are on your throne [Music] [Applause] you are god alone [Music] that's [Music] from before [Music] [Music] hallelujah i bless your name [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] the truth of the world [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] like me [Music] who was [Music] lord bless you we always appreciate when the lord moves on our young people and they decide to make a decision to do what's right and uh you know they asked the prophet of god when they should be baptized he said you baptize them and they want to be baptized and we certainly do that today and we believe it sticks with them and and it binds them with a group of people that have done the same thing and i believe it'll be there for them when they need it the scripture says in the book of acts it says therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this up towards generation i believe that's what we heard this morning was an exhortation to save ourselves from this generation then they that gladly received this word were baptized and the same day there were added un to them about 3 000 souls that was quite a baptismal service wasn't it we're happy to add one more this morning in the kingdom of the lord amen our gracious heavenly father as we know in your word that it was commissioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing in them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and with the keys to the kingdom peter knew assuredly that that name was the lord jesus christ and so father according to the word of god and the promise of this hour we baptite in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen let's all stand this morning sing this as our dismissal song this morning i feel like traveling on oh my heavenly home is [Music] yes i feel like traveling [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] shall be [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] when i feel like traveling [Music] [Music] the lord has been so good to me [Music] god [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] you
