this morning amen i want to welcome everyone in the house of god may god bless you all our visitors will welcome you as you invite buddy mike for our psalm reading this morning and may god bless you good morning you know once again let's go ahead and look at psalm 119 this morning we're just going to continue reading that together you know as we've been reading this you know i hope you see that this is all about a relationship with the word that this is you know uses different words it calls it says the precepts the commandments the law the testimonies it's all just the word you know you can replace any of those words with the word you know this is hopefully you see this is more than just reading and studying and understanding a book the scriptures and trying to order your life to discipline your life with the scriptures there's no life in that all right you know it's that's just religion but you know as we read psalm 119 hopefully you see it's a chapter of action there's action words in almost every single verse it describes a living active functional relationship with the word you know it has an effect it does something for you and you do something back that's an active relationship you know there's a clear example of this as we go through looking at verse 25 we're going to read kind of that next eight verses you know it's a beautiful summary of the transformation work that is done by the word the transformation the activity of transformation you know it begins in verse 25 my soul cleaveth unto the dust you know that word cleave means to cling to stick you know and that's our natural tendency isn't it our natural state is to be attracted to earthly things to cling to or to be stuck to this world you know that's where we all start isn't it then there's a cry of his heart says quicken me to bring me to life energize me according to thy word that's an action scriptures and books don't have actions you know that's just dead letter it takes a person to perform an action so as he sits in this natural state clinging to earthly things his cry has quickened me bring me to life energize me according to thy word the thy in thy word is who he's calling out to you it says in verse 26 i have declared my ways that's a confession and then in verse 26 thou herdest me as the song says this poor man cried and the lord heard me notice the progression of the relationship with the word you know he goes from his natural condition calling out for quickening confessing his ways and someone hears him goes on in verse 26 teach me thy statute make me understand the way of thy precepts so shall i talk of thy wondrous works a confession of his own ways and a cry to someone that he would be instructed in his ways that he would be instead of his own works instead of his own ways that i might be instructed in your ways that i might testify of your works verse 28 my soul melteth for heaviness repentance again look at the progression of the relationship with the word this is far more than studying a book a cry for quickening and instruction followed by repentance he says strengthen thou me according to thy word he needs supernatural strength something beyond the strength of man strengthen thou me to cause him to abandon his works and his ways and to perform works according to the word it's a book of action verse 29 remove me from the way of lying notice he didn't say deliver me from lying he said remove me from the way of lying you know in verse 26 he had said i have declared my ways and then in verse 29 he describes it as the way of lying his ways are the way of lying you know we know that all men are born into the world speaking lies and surely that's true but you know we've also been born into a way of lying a world of deception the great lie deliver thou me from the way of lying a lie is an untruth an absence of truth a perversion of truth you know outside of the intervention of the word we would find ourselves stuck in the way of lying it says in verse 29 grant me thy law graciously give me your word by your grace you know remove me from the way of no truth and give me thy truth you know this is a nature change trading a nature of untruth for the truth himself i am the way the truth and the life it says in verse 30 i have chosen the way of truth remove me from the way of untruth i have chosen the way of truth exchanging untruth for truth and nature change you see the progression of the action of the word do you recognize the pattern how many can say that they have been on that journey with the relationship with the word you know moving from a natural state of clinging to earthly things and then because of a quickening work there's a confession repentance instruction supernatural strengthening then a nature change a change from the way of untruth to the way of truth and look at the testimony that comes from this relationship with the word verse 30 31 i have stuck unto thy testimonies he went from verse 25 my soul cleaveth to the dust where i was stuck in earthly things so verse 31 i have stuck unto thy testimonies thy word the action of the word you know i uh i thought it was just a beautiful example of the action-oriented relationship of the word and you know to me it was just a reminder and a testimony that the word produces action the word has an effect it's not just something we study or believe or memorize but it's something that produces an action-oriented relationship and you can see it in the example of transformation both in the word and in our lives i just thought it was just beautiful i thought it was all laid out there i hope it was a blessing to you it was to me but let's just read that next little piece of psalm 119 together from 25 to 32 my soul cleaveth unto the dust quicken thou me according to thy word i have declared my ways and thou herdest me teach me thy statutes make me to understand the way of thy precepts so shall i talk of thy wondrous works my soul melteth for heaviness strengthen thou me according to thy word remove from me the way of lying and grant me thy law graciously i have chosen the way of truth thy judgments have i laid before me i have stuck unto thy testimonies o lord put me not to shame i will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart amen amen god bless you oh it's the old time the holy spirit and the devil wonder near it that's the recent people fearful oh it's good enough for me forgive me at all foreign oh is oh foreign [Applause] oh is is oh oh oh oh oh [Applause] amen

undeserving people lord and you made a way you made a way that we could stand before you you pay the price you came and found each one each one of us father in the far reaching place that we were in

see in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen i don't want to stop worshiping amen don't think that you don't even think grandma can be able to preach after that you know what i mean it'll be a letdown but uh we're not counting on us amen aren't you counting on the love of god if i if i really want a revelation a increase in revelation i'd like to have be increased in the revelation of how much god loves me how much he loves me when i was just became a christian i wasn't a christian very long at all and this elderly gentleman came up to me and and he said you know god really loves you and i thought oh yeah you know i believe that he says no wait a minute he says i'm trying to tell you something here god really loves you and and he was trying to say something and i believe it that god did have a special love to me because he had to go really deep to find me but he did it he didn't have to do it but he did it amen we're not going to forget that let's pray as we approach him again the word let's open our bibles and thank you musicians one day by the grace of god i'm going to sing in the choir it may not be here but there's a choir i'm going to sing and there's a special that's going to be on my heart and i trust it now this is scripture i i didn't quite understand why the lord brought me to this scripture this morning and and i was in my office it just i got in and and he said i listen in exodus this is what i want you to read and it all fell together but here let's let's read over in exodus the 14th chapter and this morning i uh i'm just going to put i don't have a lot of notes i'm going to have to go by inspiration um but i want to preach on the struggle the battle the burden the victory okay so let us let us read here in exodus the 11 of the 14th chapter and the 11th verse and and so you know the story right they're coming out of their egypt amen and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt thou hath taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt now i want you to hold that that dilemma why did you take me out you know what i mean now remember the coming out of egypt is a type isn't it of the bride it's a type of every christian journey amen so he said why did you do this if anybody ever asked why'd you save me i was happy back there all right and he said he said you see he said but is it not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning there's uh certainly a shout in the camp this morning amen amen and you know i like when there's a shout in the camp because when there's a shout in the camp there's always those that are wondering well what is everybody shouting about what's all the excitement about uh you know they're we know the story of blind bartimaeus and and black martinez he sat at his place and all of a sudden he heard the shout he heard there was a shout in the camp and and so as the crowd was moving down and he heard this he inquired of somebody what is it what is he saying oh haven't you heard it's the young prophet it's jesus of nazareth and and so the shout caused the inquiry and the inquiry when they heard it they began to hear well who is this man who is this jesus well he's the one this is the one that raised uh lazarus from the dead and the leopards and and the thing was and then he he took it within himself and he cried out so the the shout's a good thing but it's a good thing to have a shout in the camp it's a good thing to be worshipping the lord because those that that don't know what you're shouting about it gives them an opportunity to find out what the shout's all about you know you know what i mean i'll guarantee is when when you have good news you shout about it when the the woman found the coin she shouted about it she went and got her neighbors that which was lost is found and so it's a it's a great uh it's a great thing that i have to shout in the camp it's also an important thing not to let that die and uh and uh and that's why uh we're having testimony we're gonna continue our testimony to service many other people came to me uh and said i'd like to testify sunday night so if you have your testimony just write your name down give it to billy uh take a little bit of prayer in your testimony so you can keep it to the point because pretty soon you want to tell your life story you know i tried to tell my life story one time two and a half hours later you know i was still going so uh you know which i i wouldn't mind you know i'm kind of to that age now if i fell asleep in my seat nobody would say much about it for that i'm grateful for that but um i have a concern and it's not a negative concern it's a positive concern and and so i'd like to read this statement that um the prophet of god in preaching he says and this is out of the message proving his word that brother branham preached in los angeles and i believe this is right after that he had spoken of the earthquake going to shake california so but he says this he says and if you can find that you're welcome to put it on the board it's proving his word paragraph 22 and it's just right in here that brother branham um he talks this so it's paragraph 22 approving this word the one that was preached on a 4 26 of 1965. he says now tonight i want to read a place here in the scriptures just for a few moments we're going to pray for the sick billy said he give out a bunch of prayer cards and he gave me out some yesterday and i never got to any of them last night and i wonder when the holy spirit you he says you you can't make it work it's just like a little lever you pull yourself into gear you're the ones that does that operating of the holy spirit not me now that like that says teaching right there in itself but i don't believe that the prophet of god came to speak of himself he was way too humble for that i think everything he said he said for his the bride because the way of a true prophet is to speak the word so when he says you know it's like a little lever you pull yourself into that gear you don't we always can look well that's brother branham but but you too are the sons and daughters of god you are also the word that god had in his mind before the beginning of the of time and creation he also had thoughts of you and his thoughts to you were good and and he knew that that he had a wonderful thought of you and that thought had an expected end so you could sit here and realize that god's got an expected end for me so he's he's bringing me as we talked in the rising of the sun and in our journey he he's bringing us and he's drawing us to that expected end he's drawing us to the the finished creative product that he had in his mind but we understand that god's an evolutionist he's a god that unfolds he's a god that does things in process you know wouldn't it have been wonderful if he would have just said whom well we're all there in eden we'd have never known he was a healer we'd have never known he's a deliverer we would have never really recognized that he was even the great god that he was because it was all that we ever knew and so we knew that he had such a marvelous way of creating a contrast so that that we could have fellowship with him and know that where we were once lost and now we're found but he said this little lever he says you do that you pull that gift you you make that so you've got to realize that you've got something within you that has been created if i could call that a lever that can pull yourself into the presence of the holy spirit that can pull yourself into the the the word of god when you sit down and you and you approach there's two ways to approach the word of god you can read the word of god because it's a beautiful thing to read it's a wonderful thing to read the stories and things are wonderful or you can approach the word of god to hear from god you understand and when you do that that that you're pulling that lever because you're pulling yourself in there for an answer you're pulling yourself in there to receive something from god now a lot of us don't pull the lever you know you know what i'm we know it's there but we don't make that move but let's just go on and read what he continues to say he says you're the ones that do that you do that yourself you do that yourself so god's equipped you to enter into his spirit so so i last night i noticed even in the discernment it never picked up with the people just right they didn't seem to take to it i have found it here lately it seems like more or less just as i was speaking laying on of hands upon the sick they know we we should realize that in us has been given we who believe jesus christ and are born of his spirit and filled with that quickening power that power that in you by laying on of hands and on on the others like the disciples did down through the ages it's absolutely healed the sick raised the dead it showed visions and prophecies and the same spirit that lived amongst the early apostles is living in the church today working the very same thing and as quick as we can recognize that see no matter how much it's working you've got to recognize that and believe that it won't do one bit of good until you believe it but the moment you believe it your troubles are ended that's true so we we know that the scripture tells us i i believe it's in romans the eighth chapter that we fight not against principle flesh and blood but against principalities powers and spiritual wickedness in high places a lot of sometimes are in battle with ourselves when it's really not you at all it's the it's the enemy but he has a way of of uh of battling us so i'd like to talk about our journey because we've just had so many people in our in our body that have come back from camp and other people that have went to camp that have been at different places in their christian walk who who have who have received something from the lord but what transpires in every one of us first of all is the struggle there's a struggle that starts within ourselves in our our lives maybe it's the word of god comes by we hear something maybe we have the question in our life of uh why am i where i'm at and why do i have the parents and and okay where's my life going but i want you to realize that with every christian and though you might not notice it from the outside someone might look like everything's just rolling smooth you know what i mean and yet on the inside there was a great struggle going on there was a great turmoil going on many times the world is shocked because somebody will take their life and and they they stand back in in dismay because they they say well we thought everything was good we thought everything was fine we just and and that that's a uh just an easy way to to look at things is just think well if they're dressed good if everything's fine and everything's going on then must everything must be fine but i think if we understand and we recognize that people go through struggle there's a struggle inside the struggle's going on and we know that that struggle takes place in the mind because that's where the battleground is a lot of internal struggle a lot of thoughts how many testimonies did we hear wednesday night as i was struggling in my mind i was struggling with this i was struggling with that and god delivered me from my struggle amen oh well i've heard it when people have deliverance made from alcohol they they would testify i struggled with alcohol i fought with it i struggled with it i i it was a battle that was going on with inside of me and you don't have control over that it's a it it's a struggle i i think uh brother mike touched on it a little bit in his exportations but it takes two for a relationship right it takes two for a struggle you understand because you're struggling against something i remember the first time i i ever saw an advertisement for resistance training i thought that's stupid you know that's where they got those rubber bands and they just pull and they struggle but see there's something else pulling back you understand so there's something that struggle well the reason you're in a struggle is because there's two people struggling for you you kind of feel like the tug of war rope you know what i mean one's on one end and something's on the other end you know that i mean the pink panthers from penn state are pulling you this way and and god's pulling you this way you know what i mean and you find yourself in a struggle so i want you to understand the struggles there it's always the first step remember we're talking about struggle battle burden victory so the struggle's there you know because so many times we feel while i struggled and and you only have one struggle no every time he comes to pole you'll find yourself in a struggle every time that he decides to make a move on you you'll find yourself in a struggle now the the thing about it is we've had so many victories and and people somehow said i was struggling and praise god i overcame that struggle and that's always i mean if you can you can you to overcome right so it doesn't matter what you overcome the important thing is how you overcome it and we know that our victory is our faith right first john 5 and four even our faith look i thought as we people began to testify and and many people have sat with me even those that haven't gone to camp in the last few days and i i love the the things that i've heard i used to struggle with this and i used to struggle with that and so god delivers us out of the struggle but he doesn't deliver us out of the struggle into a flowery field of ease he do so the struggle is going on inward that's the struggle and then you come to that place where you make that decision of which which side of the of the rope you're going to go on you know what i mean so god's ear pulling and right isn't that what the scripture says satan's cast his vote against you god's casted his vote for you now there you are in the struggle which way am i going to go which path am i going to choose and and then the battles going on right eve was in that battle and satan's giving you all the benefits who else do we know was in that battle the lord was in that battle i'll give you all the kingdoms i'll give you this i'll give you that we'll read a statement here in a little bit about that but so the struggle goes on inwardly is the two forces pulling at you now remember in those forces of that struggle he uses your five senses he uses your emotions and your mind your consciousness your thinking he's using all those things in that struggle to try to pull you he's trying to pull you he's trying to build a kingdom he wants satan wants you to be a part of his kingdom he wants you to be a part of his world he wants you to be a part of his education his civilization his science and then over on this side and he's got all these universities and professors and hospitals and all these buildings and everything that are out there that are he's offering you all his kingdoms because he he has to have some weight have you ever seen a tug of war they never put me on the end of the rope because i was a little guy he was always the guy to get in the mud first they picked the biggest guy they could get and they put him on the rope and that's what satan does he's got all the weight on his side of the rope you say well what's on god's side of the rope the thing that's on god's side of the rope is his expected end of you amen but it don't do us no good if we can't recognize it it doesn't it doesn't do it any good till we come to the spot in this struggle you understand that god has got something for me you're not going to enter into this life this christian life you're not going to enter into this the baptism of the holy spirit you're not going to keep going if you don't believe that god's got something for you [Music] that he's got the spirit to give you that he's got victory to give you blessings to give you healing to give you deliverance to give you you won't you won't go if there's no benefit that's why in the resurrection that's what the prophet of god said he said when jesus rose from the dead the first thing he told his disciples were the benefits because i live you shall live also look the the struggle is there and the struggle's on and two sides are pulling at you and you're you're pressed in and you don't even know what's going on you've got this little teeny seed inside of you and it's struggling too did you know that satan comes and he pours a ton of concrete on you and now that little seed is struggling to get to that sunlight it's trying to find its place is trying to come out of the struggle now i don't want to sound discouraging by any means because you can see the struggle you know people struggle the most when they're trying to protect their own interests their own feelings their own emotions a selfish person really struggles a lot because they're so easily offended by everything that anybody says or does that they might that might uh in their life might make their life a little more inconvenient or or it's just not you're not making my life smooth and i want this and i want that that person's always going through a major struggle but the struggle's there the struggles there because the law of contrast is there the struggle's there because there's principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places the struggle is there because you have something inside of you that is the seed of god and it is struggling for life also no matter how far you run into the world or how hard you try to get away from it it follows you sometimes you like to turn around to the seed and say give me a break and he said i'm not gonna give you a break i'm after you i'm going to overcome you i'm coming for you because you're mine now that's a struggle when you don't know who you are well you don't know whether i want to serve the world or serve god because we're in an age of lady osea where lukewarm don't work lukewarms religion lukewarms brick buildings on corners amen uh uh uh uh there's this this is a physical building but it's not the church there's not a holy church there's only a holy god [Applause] so that the struggle's there and that struggles inward now the struggle ceases when you make the choice all right i'm done struggling i'm done with this i'm not going down that highway anymore i'm not going to do that i'm going to break up with this boy this all this boy wants to do is take advantage of me all this boy wants to do is show me out to the the world you know what i mean all this boy is interested in is my innocence because every other girl out there has been taken advantage of so many times now that's the truth try to say it as appropriately as i can and the same thing on the brother's side the same thing on all of our side it's always that struggle but let me tell you when you finally come to the place that you've made that decision like we sang that song i ain't going back the struggle's over i'm not going back satan i'm done with you you're a liar you're the father of life that can your your all your army has a sickness and death and confusion and depression that's what your army brings i'm not a part of that anymore i'm done struggling [Music] with that choice it's not bad to be in the struggle but i appreciated our sister's testimony so much i i'm going to go back and listen to it again just for myself but there came a time i'm done with this struggle i'm going to go be prayed for it doesn't come in a prayer line mine came on a rooftop mine come open in the bible and read in romans chapter 1 and saying i'm done with this i remember i when i prayed i said god i don't know what i am but i'm not this i'm not going to be a biker i'm not going to be a drug dealer i'm not going to hang around with this people i'm not going to rob and join organized crying and others he brought me to the edge of decision you know what i mean there was a struggle now either i could end the struggle by choosing satan or i can end the struggle by choosing god but the struggle only comes to an end with a decision [Applause] [Music] otherwise you're double-minded you're tossed to and from this way that way this way that way sometimes you got to drive down the stake [Music] this is what i'm going to live right i'm going to serve god amen so i'm going to set my tent up here and where he leads me i will follow [Music] so you may be struggling and that's fine it's it's okay to struggle but understand the struggle what's the struggle for it's a struggle between truth and false light and darkness the true word of god and the untrue there's no such thing as a true what do you call that other thing a lie that's the struggle and when you make your decision the struggle's over but now you move into the battle that's right the struggles within when the decisions made now you enter the battle because now satan's back after you now now you've got an adversary right because you made a decision and you said i'm not going to serve you i'm not going to follow you i'm not going to listen to you i'm not going to listen to your music i'm not going to listen to your lies i'm not going to listen i have chosen god's holy word [Applause] all right the fight is on no more it's a whole lot tougher than the struggle it's a battle now it's a battle yes sir when jesus went up there in that 40 days in the wilderness what was he doing he was struggling right he's out there being tempted he's out there going through the struggle if thou be a christian oh i'll give you this that's what he does he offers everything the struggles on but jesus made a decision amen get behind me satan and now the battle was on and and the battle so it's important for me as a pastor even to to say to those of you that are coming out of the struggle i don't want you to think because the struggle's over that's the inward part the battle now moves to the outside now the battle's on he'll try to embarrass you he'll try to make you the fool he'll try to you know he'll tr he'll try to talk you out of every decision this very decision you made he wants to talk you out of it it's the battle that's right you don't have the struggle you thought well what's happened well what's happened the struggle has left the inside and now turned into a battle on the outside because you've identified you're adversary as long as the struggle's going on you don't really know which voice is true there's feelings of things things are pulling at you and everything and what does god do he's always salting that seed with a little bit of word here a little bit of word there a sermon here something here that deep inner gut feeling uh this bible calls that holy unction that keeps haunting you it's wrong it's right you know you're not right you know you shouldn't do this and you keep crossing that word over you keep running from it you struggling with it you go do what you do you feel miserable and and that oh my it's so good to be free he who is free is free indeed but now we move into the battle the battle is the outward the battle is the adversary trying to do everything he can to do to discredit you he makes you look at yourself if you can do one thing for your salvation jesus christ died in vain well you were yet a sinner he died for you in other words now you're in the battle so you've left the struggle for the battle but you can't enter a battle without a weapon you say well what was the struggle the struggle satan had his weapon it was called the world it was all the pleasures of the the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life well the pride of life what is that my education my station my accomplishment my income level the house i live in something that represents some form of something that i've done wouldn't you rather live in a tent by a riverside and eat soda crackers and branch water and be filled with the spirit of god and know that god loves you there's no prestige who are you trying to impress that don't impress a christian amen that was satan's lie satan is trying to give people a false worth you hear me a false worth you're you're great i i i watch it in the few years that god's given me to live i've watched superstars come and go how many knows where kobe bryant is today i'm not his judge you know what i mean but he ain't the talk of the town it took that long all his dreams all his reputation everything is history it's in the history books and what's the final conclusion of his whole life is a wreck see satan tries to give us false worth so when in the struggle what was satan's weapon it was society it was civilization it was education it was offering you a way to fit into the world let me tell you what happens when the struggle's over you realize you don't fit that's what's wrong with you all right you're a bunch of oddballs you don't fit you'll never fit no matter how hard you try to fit you won't fit i'll say to this to my shame and i hope i don't embarrass my my daughter but you know we we worked all our lives pretty hard and uh and we didn't have a whole lot and i was able to get my daughter into a private school because i was building their gymnasium and building their field house and working and electrical and doing a bunch of things well you know and so uh so i i i i felt bad for her because we we didn't have the best clothes and we didn't have the best items to give so i i don't know school year finally came and i felt bad for her so i took her out and i forget what the fashion was back then but anyway it was a big top named fashion i bought her a whole gigantic wardrobe there was nobody on that campus that dressed as nice as she did you think that made her fit in it just pushed her to the other side and you know when i realize she'll never fit in she's a daughter of god he's got the seed of god we're not made to fit we're not made to fit they use intelligence to get work we use the grace of god to get work they use money to pay bills we use faith to pay bills [Applause] they use dr dobson and and all these tough love books and and all that to raise children we use the holy ghost let's face it we don't know what we're doing in this world we are the biggest bunch of clueless people that exist [Applause] you might think you're going to use your intelligence or your knowledge well let me tell you something god has built in you a handicap you've been disabled by the seed of god that's in your [Applause] [Music] you want to park here the word of god said sorry you're handicapped you can't park in the executive office you can't park at the ceo you can't park here on the all-star list you can't park here you can you're not parking why can't i park there cause you're handicapped [Applause] oh i'm waiting for his team aren't you i'm waiting for the team that judged the world oh you're handicapped so we move from the struggle satan's weapon being all the things of the world you come out of the struggle now you're in the battle that's right he's going to fight against you he's going to lie against you he's going to bear false witness against you he's going to try to trap you david says he sets the snares before me you know what i mean so you now you've left the struggle you've made up your mind you made your decision now you're in the battle oh my the battle a lot of people get struck stuck right there because they never understood that life is a constant warfare it's a battle but god didn't equip us for the battle he gave us the best thing to fight the battle and that's his word that's his word we had a lovely uh brother's breakfast uh um there and and i invite all the brothers to come if you if you you can't come for the word's sake come for the burritos but if you testify and and and we we we we had this wonderful brother breakfast brothers breakfast about a testimony of a true witness and and everything testimony you can have a testimony and you can have an experience you can say i got delivered i i got saved i got the spirit was taken off me i prayed for somebody but you've got to take that back back to the word of god you've got to take that experience now this is exactly what the prophet of god taught i didn't bring the quote but he said you've got to take that experience and line it up with the words you've got to find that experience in the scripture so now it doesn't have a an identity outside of what god's done it can't be coincidence it can't be a blessing oh god blessed me according to what according to romans 5 and 8. according to philippians 2 and 10. i'm just pulling those scriptures up i could probably say second corinthians 21 and 6 and somebody would go looking for it it's not there don't look but you've got to take it back to the word of god because once you've taken it back to the word of god now it's weaponized that's right you understand so you've got to weaponize your testimony because it's not the testimony of the end of the struggle that's the beginning of your testimony your testimony now is the word in the battle you've got to weaponize let me tell you too many christians never weaponized their testimony by bringing it back and anchoring it in the word where's faith's final resting place the word of god this happened to me because god said so [Music] amen he can't rob that he can't rob that from you he can take your experience he can take your feeling but as long as you've got that experience anchored in the word you know that it's not the feeling might have been temporary but the victory is eternal [Applause] because you've angered it in eternity let me take it a step further the reason you can anchor it in eternity because that was god's expected end of the struggle [Applause] you didn't get out of the struggle he got you out of the struggle and how did he get you out of the struggle we'll say by grace by mercy he got you out of the struggle by his word you were his word and he couldn't deny himself amen [Applause] i know that the first thing satan does we satan is the rear-view mirror it's all he is he's a real vermeer he can only criticize where you've been because he don't have one revelation of where you're going he's not a part of it didn't even believe jesus was jesus that's right he believed his own lies so when he rose from the dead what do you think he went and did he went told another lie oh they stole his body i've meant the stolen body you they might have stole it but i found it hey man [Applause] right praise god so we we enter we leave the struggle into the battle now we got to realize now i'm in a battle now i've got to be weaponized i got i've taken the victory of my struggle i found myself in the scriptures now this is going to be important as we go to the next step because i found myself in the scriptures i've seen that i've become prophecy fulfilled you say what happened when you got saved my sheep heard my voice and they won't follow another that's all that happened well what were you well i i could tell you what i was what i was was in a struggle of what path i was going to take in life but i came out of the struggle because there was a purchase price paid for me you hear what i'm saying especially those one of you wonderful young people that have come out you know i i i i don't want to just clap with you and rejoice in you when you could i was i know how to say this just right but the spirit's like wine it stimulates you you understand and so many people they they when the battle comes they think it's a hangover i probably shouldn't use those terminologies but you know i'm just trying to reach out and let you understand when when the battle comes it doesn't mean it's over it doesn't mean you lost that's right you know what i mean it doesn't mean you're back in the struggle satan satan tries to tell you it's the same old struggle he tries to tell you it's the same old thing the same old spirit the same old devil the same old call but you've got to sit there and say no liar because jesus didn't fight him even with miracles he didn't fight him with an experience he didn't fight him with one thing he fought him with one thing only when he was in the struggle and he was getting the victory and he finally went from the struggle to the battle he said it is written amen and he left the struggle he entered into the battle he weaponized his experience with the eternal word now he had something that when would win the battle any place any time anywhere doesn't matter what it is it's not what you're fighting it's how you're fighting it have you ever played charades i think that's a game right where you say something to this person he tells it and he tells it and he tells it and he tells it and when it gets down here it's like tenth hand experience you know and uh the first one was a rabbit run into the bush and then when it gets down to the other end it's the bushmen of australia were hunting rabbits it's nowhere near the same so if it's an experience from god it's got to be a word experience because the word's the only thing that's eternal heaven and earth will pass away but my word won't be eternal and then when you come to that place in the battle where you've weaponized your experience you've taken hold of the atomic bomb of god's word you you're operating this word by faith because now you're going to have the experience that's greater than the experience of deliverance you're going to have the experience of defeating satan oh that's fun i like that i like seeing people healed i like seeing devils coming out of you i like seeing people get filled with the holy ghost billy paul is telling the story you heard it he told it here that's why i'm telling it he said brother bosworth is always back there mumbling billy couldn't take it anymore he said he said he finally said brother bob what are you saying oh he's saying i'm saying poor devil poor devil where did we get this affinity and this love and this respect for the devil the fear of the devil is the beginning of wisdom you've never read that scripture it is first luther lucifer 3 and 14. the fear of the devil is the beginning of wisdom certainly who do you think created these skyscrapers look at how smart who do you think created those smartphones and those cell phones and all that stuff the only trouble is they're not eternal and god can't create something that's not eternal makes me glad my name's on the lamb's book of life i'm not what i want to be i'm not what i should be but i'm not what i used to be either so we we come into a battle now we're free from the struggle that's our testimony i'm free from the struggle but what happens when that's ten years ago you've got a living testimony or a historical testimony now you've got a new testimony it's not the testimony of the struggle it's the testimony of the battle satan came against me but i stayed with god's word many christians ask why they get sick or if i was a christian why did i get sick you know the prophet of god said he answered that question i think it's improving his word if you can go find it and read it he says don't we know that all things work together for the good who love the lord amen all right can only fight satan with one thing there's only one weapon that works for god's children and that's the word and we have a promise that no weapon that's devised against us will be successful so now we enter into the battle let's move on and i'll close because i want to get to the testimonies i want to hear so testimony so bad testimony service will begin at two o'clock five o'clock beautiful from battle to burden amen this is where a person that's maybe been in the fight longer many times stumbles but a burden is all of a sudden it's what it is it's like a burden it's a weight that comes on you it's it's sometimes maybe it's a heaviness of heart maybe sometimes it's a loss of direction maybe sometimes it's a burden to to move up higher you you feel like i'm a christian you know i i've tried to live my life and i look back and i see where he saved me and where i came out of my struggle and i've seen how many times he's fought for me and saved my children and healed the the sick and i've seen people delivered of this and i've seen delivered of that lord i've seen so many things and yet why am i here with such a hunger on my heart for more such a burden because it is a burden it's a burden he wants to bear with you that burden's there maybe a lot of times we find out that we've come to that that uh part in our life that that the the battle we we've we've established our fork in god's word we read our scriptures but that's still you you're battling for yourself your deliverance was for yourself you'll find out that the next part of christianity is that burden or it's no longer about you let this mind that was in christ be in you it's burden time all of a sudden you find yourself in that i'm carrying burdens i'm burdened i'm burdened for my loss the children i i'm burdened for i appreciated camp the testimonies that came back if people said oh i was at camp and i was just praying so much for uh for for somebody you know to uh just just got delivered like like uh gregory said oh christian was over there praying that great it up his game what happened a burden came amen a load came you know why a load comes because it's something that's got to be moved it's something that's got to be taken out of the way ephesians 2 and 10 says we are his workmanship in christ jesus foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them you ever ask yourself this is just our family here you ever ask yourself like how do i know that how how do i know what is the good work that i should do you know we all want to go back and and have some sort of motion picture vision where we're going into hospitals and we're taking people by the hands how many has ever emptied the whole hospital out in your dreams you're so spiritual you know that you're walking and people are just flying out of beds and and then you wake up and find out you're still a human it's a burden god moves his church by burden he puts it on your heart amen now you win the burden with the same thing you win the battle now the burden becomes part of the battle the first battle that i was talking about is the battle for yourself right satan is trying to recover what he thought was his what's that song we said satan a sinner that satan thought he had you know i guess is that praise god my sins are gone satan lost the sinner that he thought he had the the battle that you enter into from the struggle is the battle of preservation you're fighting satan off from trying to reclaim you and recover you he'll lie to you oh you never got saved look at that you looked at that picture and you felt that little lust spirit come on you fight don't give in that's what the scripture says take this take because sin is when a man's drawn off by his own lust but when it's conceived then it becomes unbelief but that's why you got your sword put on the whole armor of god but the burden now and the reason that i'm coming to this point is that i believe the church has moved to a place of a new testimony our testimony is always god did this for me god did that for me it always has to do with my flesh my flesh was in a struggle god brought me out of the struggle satan tried to bring me back in i fought it off satan offered me this satan did this satan did this i i fought it off i followed but that's always it's always i thought for myself you know what i mean i i wish good satan and how many knows that if you're with dan satan he will what he'll flee now you're a mighty army we've taken our plowshares and we beat them in to swords now we're going to be the church of the burden probably god said when a church loses its burden for lost souls it loses its spirituality that's right when they lose their burden for the sick who satan's got bound by diseases and sicknesses that's the devil so how do you move and a lot of these questions are on my heart and i ask your prayer but how do you move out of that battle of of where well how do i stand up against this or how do i fight against this i mean i i just should learn to accept this or i just should learn to accept that or it's all in god's hands but the burden that i'm talking about is god transferring what he wants to accomplish unto the hearts of his children amen there's this soul over here lord we know you can go save that soul lord we know you can take them out of their struggle we know you can do that but now he's finally got a people that's called out he's finally got a people that's been separated he's gone he got a people that got the weapon in their hand and he finally tells his church the works that i do shall you do also how do you think jesus got to the woman at the well he got burdened i have need to go by there you don't want to go down there lori no i've got neat i'm burdened he got down there and he waited i don't know who else come by but finally the one that came by that he was burdened for how great was his burden for her we're still telling the story it became the identification of the ministry of the son of man in our day how about the widow so the burden the church moves from the battle of self-preservation in to the burden i care about this person i want i don't want satan destroying this person's life you young people that come out at camp i know satan it makes you that oddball feeling you get when there's so much peer pressure and there's so much trending stuff that's going on but let me tell you the boys and the girls around you are in a mental struggle that they don't understand and you're the only one that can explain it to them and lay it out they're really what's happening because satan is wrestling for their soul he's fighting for their mind how bad is this struggle they want to teach kindergartners first second and third graders about gender identity we need to move into the burden stage we need to come out of the battle and accept the burden and start fighting for others [Music] without fear we do not have fear of failure you understand success and failure all launches from the same platform from the same spot when you stand to make a decision you're faced with two things fear of failure or victory you'll never move from that when you pray for the sick i hope i'm you're not missing it but let's say i'm going to pray for billy he's sick i'm not saying he's sick but and i'm going to lay my hands on prayer now right now he's either going to get well right or he's not and i know we got that co quote all loaded up in our minds if he drops dead i'll pray for the next one they'll probably drop dead too because there's something lacking there's a whole lot of difference when i sit down and witness the gospel not for the gospel's sake alone but because i have a burden on my heart for billy the battle's not about me the battles the lords you understand this egypt this is the egyptian army that you fear so much this army will you see no more forever the lord will fight and the only thing that's going to start moving this church into the real works they should do is when they have the burden of the lord jesus in their hearts it's beyond the struggle it's beyond the battle i hope i've been able to describe those steps if you're driven by burden i can't stand to see this person in this condition anymore you know what satan wants to do wants to put you back through the process back through the struggle back through the battle but when we start acting upon burden we'll see victory because the word never fails when you yield your weapon for others remember the little blind man in mexico he came up to our messenger and so he comes up to our messenger and the prophet of god looks at him and he doesn't have no shoes what is he doing he's entering into the burden he says this man could be my father and he looked over and he put his foot up against his and he said he walked barefoot he had a wide foot i had a narrow foot i looked at my coat and he said it would have swamped him he entered into that burden and when he entered into that burden he took the word of god and applied the word of god to the burden the burden is god's way of leading you we just don't pick random works out of the sky right here pull pull okay that's go witness let's give brother mcgeary an offering you just don't pull random works you you understand what i'm saying i'm talking about i'm looking for a church that starts is going to have a new testimony all right the testimony of we testified to this person and they got healed we testified this person and they got baptized you can you know why they're doing all this work downtown and we've seen these baptized because joseph gordon one day sitting in his house he said somebody just came in here and i never said nothing to him about the lord and he got burdened and the burden began to eat them up you know what he said he hadn't left my driveway yet what's happening to us the holy spirit places unction on our heart to stand for something well i don't i can understand this not knowing what to do but when you start nick he's starting to hand out burdens you hear me he's starting to hand out burdens he's starting to face as god wants to move because he's got to represent this bride he's got to prove because he said that she would be the last voice of this dying generation he said this bride would have the same heart the same mind the same spirit that he had he'd have the same word in fact this bride would be him reincarnated in flesh how is he going to get that message to us by burden burdens aren't the lack of something they're the cry of the needy they're blind burn mess they're the woman at the well they're the leopards they're the demon controlled person they're jairus's daughter every single one of them was a burden that was moved upon god's passing out burden i'm closing i had so much that uh i wanted to read but god's getting burdened because victory comes from burden victory is the visible witness of the word of god made flesh and to testify i laid my hands on this person they were so burdened and i don't think we have to give a litany to go back and and and i could tell you so many times in my life that i've seen the hand of the lord move and i just recognize this that every time i've seen god do something it's because my heart was so burdened in mexico when we went to pray for that we were down in this camp down way down in guess it was way down in oaxaca and the native villages there in this brush harbor medium they come and rousted me out of the camper i'd preach 22 services in 28 days and was sick i was weak and they needed us to come pray i was with jerry dalton and so we got out of the camper and started to walk i put on what i had some shoes slipped on and i'm telling you they were climbing the swiss alps it was steep it was a long one the full moon was shining dogs were coming up to the gate it almost felt biblical and we went up these trails and everything and finally we come into this place and this lady was there and she had given birth to a baby and its legs were crossed i'm not a medical doctor i don't know anything about it but i know one thing those people were burdened they were burdened it's a deep calling to the deep when you get a burden for somebody how many caught that in the tape the other day there's the evil spirit that's right going back and forth it was one gallbladder condition screaming out to another gallbladder condition he called them out and they were both healed when you get a burden there's somebody there that's burdened it's a deep calling to a deep if somebody's calling up how many men that lady come up and she said i see you dropping things remember i see you sitting at this chair and you're picking up and you're dropping things over and over again the doctor said this and in and he he just testified that she was healed and then he looked out and he says it's all over the building you you you you you you've all you all suffer from the same things your nerves you can't hold on to everything you're dropping you're all healed it's a burden the identification of burden and god is going to start moving on this body by burden [Music] burden for one another burden for the loss burden for the sick burden for jobs burden for financial thing it's no more you in your own battle it's freely been given freely give we prayed for that child because when i saw him my heart broke right i i can't sit and tell you that i was expecting anything to happen because i didn't pray from the placement of expectation i'd like to get to that place this was 20 years ago but i prayed from the aspect that i was so burdened that satan had did that to that child and did that to that mother that the heart that was in me the love of god shed abroad in my heart by the holy spirit i just couldn't see how god would let that kid go through life never running i didn't have a vision i didn't feel no power i was as sick as a dog but we prayed for that baby and it got well and that mother got up because of a burden god moves his church by burden and what follows burden victory the word being manifested in flesh that's victory the word being manifested in you because you were out of your struggle you have fought the battle against satan and now you've moved to the place where this is no longer about you but it's about others and you haven't lived till you live for others you say who can be burdened a six-year-old can be burdened in my car many a times the kids would say daddy that person's hungry could you give them some money and i thought that's just a bum i'm not going to give them a nickel no but i'd roll down the window and give them something because the kids were burdened if we keep throwing off our burdens all's we're gonna be as a bunch of talkers we'll have no new testimony but the old testimony it'll be another bunch of testimonies about the great struggle it'll be another bunch of testimonies about the great battle but i'm looking for victory testimonies of the great burden do you want to rise to the challenge do you want to apply the token to your lives to your houses to your heart do you want to take on philippians let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus let every man look on the needs of the others and not his own you want to see the works that have been assigned to us do you want to see the works that you've been for ordained to do god's going to deliver that to you by way of burden and after burden is victory by victory for your children victory for your neighbor victory for the sick victory to that person you met in the store victory for people are going to wonder what's happened what's going on there's a bunch of these people that have been led by the spirit of god they start carrying such a burden of the spirit they just can't help themselves they're going to go over they're going to talk to them about jesus they're going to talk to them about the healing power of god he said well what happens if they don't listen that you know an answer care what they listen that's right what is it to you if they tarry till i come you don't know god's timing you've got one thing to respond to and that's the burden that he's delivered to you now you may not be there yet so back in closing the va those of you who have just come out of the struggle arm your experience with god's word those that are in the battle take your weapon and start winning your battles by the word of god not by will not by might but by my spirit saith the lord and those of you who have grown and you're starting to get sensitive be ready because you're going to find yourself coming out of the bed in the middle of the night praying you're going to find yourself waking up walking the floor saying i haven't seen such and such in a long time is satan after them is he taking them away oh i'm longing for the burden you say remember here you actually are sitting here praying that your church gets burdened yes because it's struggle it's battle it's burden it's victory god bless you this morning i'd like to all stand this morning father i see the truth [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is [Music] [Music] [Music] my oh [Music] oh this is oh sing my second verse again [Music]
