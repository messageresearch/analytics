Description:
Tape "Why Cry Speak" 63-0714m
Wednesday Evening Service 
Christian Life Tabernacle
July 30th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

I my trust in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Am I just such a wonderful presence? Maybe we'll just use this moment to open the service in prayer and also just take up the tithes and the offerings. We serve a a living savior. &gt;&gt; Many religions and people out there, they might have a god, but their god's in a grave somewhere dead. But our tomb is empty. Our Lord Jesus is risen. and he's ascended on high and he looks out over our needs. So maybe why don't we just all go ahead and stand as they continue to softly play and I'll ask brother Paul just to come and open our service and prayer and we we do have some needs that have uh been made known and we just want to remember uh brother John Amati as he has a procedure I believe that's tomorrow right and uh let's all be in prayer just looking for wonderful testimonies to come forward and also uh sister Magna has uh get put out a prayer request for a family member. I don't know um where uh it was very urgent. Looked like uh his life could be taken at any moment. He was in a coma and I I know the doctors were saying it's very grave. I don't know what the situation is right now. Uh if he's still with us or where that condition is, but uh let's remember sister Magnum uh her family member. I believe he's in Mexico and uh just been in a coma and they've been trying to uh revitalize him, but maybe you have a need that you just want to lift your hand up. You know, prayer changes things. The scripture says the prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. And you it's not our righteousness, but it's it's his righteousness. So, I'm just in expectation for what God has for us. Brother Paul, if you'd come [Music] Shante captive. medit. Senior on tip souvenir [Music] complete. Certain son exchange. [Music] and prison. manifest. Deliverance Make a tooth vitamin C delivery. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. My just such a wonderful atmosphere. Um I'm in a great expectation for the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why should I worry when giants come calling my name? [Music] Oh, and my God is so much bigger than the troubles I face. And why would I hunger for power or riches or fame? Oh, cuz my God is so much better than all of these things. I won't be sh brother Billy comes for and I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountain. Oh, it's time to move. Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger, and greater than you. When my enemies scatter, cuz they know the battle is done. [Music] Oh, and my God is stronger. The victory [Music] rose upon the third day [Music] heaven. I want [Music] I [Music] God is faithful. [Music] His promises is true. Oh my to the mountain. Oh my. Oh, and my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. Oh, there's no mountain to high, no to. There's no [Applause] there's no problem to me. There's no weapon to there. That's impossible. Oh, there's no mountain to just there's no problem to me. There's no weapon to show. There is nothing for that's impossible. [Music] Oh, I will see you. Oh, I love you. Oh, my God is faithful. His promises is true. Oh, I speak to the mountain. [Music] It's time to move. Oh, my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. Hallelujah. I trust we can just have that kind of confidence tonight to know that our God is bigger, better, and stronger than anything that we can face. You know, often times is because we forget what who our God is and what he's able to do. I tell you, there's nothing that that can really move us in this world. Nothing that we can be. He's the creator of all things. I mean, he created the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, "I created the waster &gt;&gt; for the purpose of what he's doing." Whatever he is doing, God put the boundaries around what he can and cannot do. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a marvelous God we serve. Amen. Let's just bow our hearts and say a word of prayer. We want to remember Sister Lori. Uh she's not feeling well and want to just lift her up in prayer. But Thiago, I know they're moving and we certainly want to just add them to prayer. I know the the prayers for the other one. Our gracious Father, we just come before you once again, Lord, as your children. It's so good to be gathered in your presence, Father. This is the place where we come to get our cup refilled once again. And you said, "Forsake not the assembling of yourself, Lord. I believe each one is gathered here with the lick of fires, Lord. And perhaps not in the same measure, but I believe when we come together, Lord, we make the fullness of who you are." And I just pray tonight, Lord, as we gather here, Lord, may you just come and speak to us through your word. And Father, we want your word to be effective in our lives. And father, we live in a time where the true heart of a true believer, Lord, we just don't want to hear and and collect intellectual understanding, but Father, we want an effectual word and Lord, and something that can make us changes, Lord, and that we can walk out of here different people than the way we came in, Father, that can give us the strength, Lord, that when we walk and we meet against challenges, Father, that we may be not shaken and we may not be moved, but stand upon on the word and know that our God is real that he's going to come to fight for us. I just pray father as we be listening may you just come and open the ears of our understanding. Father may we gather even Lord that you may just speak us speak to us and give us revelation because that's what we need more above all things remember our pastor as it's been said and those that are not here we commit the remaining of the service into your hands and ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. We'll be listening to a tape, let's open our scripture for the uh Bible for scripture reading. And uh just before we can get into that, um we'll read just a section. Exodus chapter 14. We'll read verse 13 uh to 15. And uh this is what and and I just want to say I've I I I've been I believe for the last two weeks just um meditating on this tape and just listening over and over and it's just something it struck me very different when our pastor read it last Sunday. It just something just touched me a little differently when he read the scripture and I went and I was listening. It just created such a sense of urgency within my own heart. And I I I just hope that we can capture that tonight. So the scripture says, "And Moses said unto the people, fear ye not, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you today. For the Egyptian who ye have seen today, ye shall see you shall see them no more. Uh, ye shall see them again no more forever. It says, "The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. And the Lord said unto Moses, wherefore crith out unto me, speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward." You may have your seats. Um, maybe I'll save my comments for the end. Uh but just to say um it's such a an interesting I was telling brother Matthew fellowshipping in the back and and I just said the portion that that that that here there's a there's a whole section that that that that's not in here in what we're going to listen to. Um, brother Brham is basically just laying out uh the very understanding and if I was to give it a title I want to call it elected, called and commissioned. Elected, called and commissioned. The the nothing happens by chance. Our gathering here is not in chance. And as the people of God, we have to understand one thing that when God starts a work, he has to finish it. &gt;&gt; And and the election of God is not a happen chance where he just goes and picks and said, "Well, I will elect this ones and then I'll see what happens to them." We we can even understand through the message that even the very characteristics of a person are chosen by God. how they can speak, how they can everything about them is chosen by God. And it's chosen because God has a work for them. And if God has a work for them, the prophet told us that God has a work for all his children. And your work cannot be done by another person. So when God chooses you to finish a work, you're going to finish that work. Whether you think you're incapable, you're not called, you you whatever excuses you can come up with, it's never going to stop God from fulfilling the work that he wants to do through you. So all of our excuses, all of the things that we bring on the surface on the reason why we cannot do the work, all of them points to one thing and that's the human side of us. &gt;&gt; And that's okay. We we we we we as humans, it's important when we look, we understand that there's nothing good in the flesh. But it's also important we understand that God, it's by predestination that these things are done. It's not by understanding. It's not by education we go, we educate ourselves, then we come to it. And I just want to say this, especially at this end time, Bar makes a statement in here. It says that not in the section we're going to listen to but the previous section. It says Moses was born with the equipment in him. &gt;&gt; Now I I love the prophet because every time he says something I know it's applicable to everybody &gt;&gt; because if God does one thing one way he continue to do the same. So it's not a mystery. He said Moses was born with the equipment inside of him. So, he was born to be a deliverer. Whether he wanted it or not, God ordained that person to be a deliverer. &gt;&gt; God ordained you to be a member of a bride. &gt;&gt; That's just how it is. He You didn't choose religion. You didn't choose God. However you thought you came to the understanding of the message, it was the election of God that brought you in here. So it was important that for Moses, God was really trying to get to Moses to understand even though intellectually he understood that said that he had to come in contact with the pillar of fire that actually caused him to come into the reality of what he was really called. He tried to do it intellectually. He failed. He tried to do it because that's what the parents told him, the sibling told him and everything. He failed. But when he came in contact with the pillar of fire himself, he came into the realization of the great work that he was supposed to do. &gt;&gt; And it's no different from us. We don't want to come through this with intellectual understanding because intellectual understanding will not take us far. Intellectual understanding it's good for debate and discussion but intellectual understanding is not going to overcome for you. What we need is to come in contact with the one who made the promise. &gt;&gt; And the way he makes his promise true is for him himself to come in contact with you and convince you from the heart. Not from the intellectual understanding but from the heart. Your conversion is a change from the heart. Is the Holy Spirit confirming the scriptures that you read. You were in sin. You were in trespass. you were in the world and everything something knocked into your heart. Who was it? It was God calling you to the understanding of your election. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so it's important we when when we come to our calling, we have to understand that the calling is directly connected to the election that was made. And we need to know also and I'm trying to summarize this so I can play this. It's it's very important to understand you God cannot elect you and call you. So you can just sit around. &gt;&gt; So there's a work to do. There's a commission that's attached to that. And we can only come to the commission if we understand we are elected and we are commissioned. &gt;&gt; We are elected, we are called to be the bride of this age. As long as you're still struggling, am I really called? Am I really a believer? Or am I really saved? The devil is got you exactly where he wants you to be. He's got you exactly where he wants you to be. Because as long as you still trying to figure those things out, you will never move to a place where you will actually do the commission. You will always the moment you take a step, he reminds you of your past. He reminds you of everything. And let me say this, that's why I like the revelation in this end time. When brother Brham comes and he's talking about the elected in the end time, he has nothing to do with your flesh, your parents, where you were born, how you came into the world. You are directly connected to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand this is not the same revelation that the church began with. &gt;&gt; They thought we were sinners saved by grace. God gave his blood. Oh, I'm saved and and I need to move to justification and I need to move to sanctification. I'm a sinner. It was always looking towards man. But the days of man are over. &gt;&gt; They there had to be a change from a man to God because human leadership has an ending. But God's leadership is eternal. So that's why when you are born again, you are not says it's not the old person twisted up and God trying to fix them up. It's a whole brand new creation. &gt;&gt; A new creation from the beginning from the mind of God that he had planned since the beginning to bring into action. &gt;&gt; It's just the way you came. It was because of sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God still knew where he was going to bring that seed to come into manifestation within this flesh. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why in this same time we can look I said but says you are not your flesh. &gt;&gt; You are the seed that God placed in you since the beginning of the world. &gt;&gt; Now let me stop right there. &gt;&gt; So so so paragraph 193. So now God is really everything I just talked about is the summary of the first part. I I couldn't even do justice. Right. So so that's the first portion. Now this is the second portion and and I'll say this it breaks my own heart my heart because I'm beginning even to realize where we as a people of God are really failing &gt;&gt; is the lack of understanding that everything has been prepared for us &gt;&gt; that God just wants us to walk in it with confidence with assurance. He doesn't want us to just be spiritual babes. That was Pentecost. We are to be mature Christians. Those that know that they've been elected. That's how you become effective. &gt;&gt; It's not in just being a babe. Oh, something happened. Oh, I must have done wrong. God must have hated me. Oh, I must have done this. I'm paying for this. It's over. &gt;&gt; If it paid for it, he paid for it. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I'll pay for it and then you'll pay a part of it for it." Let me say this. If we were to pay even 1% of what we're done, then Christ died in vain. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; 193. Let's just start from there. Now we find Moses here after now we find Moses here after God had done so much for him and has showed him so many signs and wonders. Now for the next 15 minutes, let's lay this down here. Watch real close. Moses come to this spot where he God had said, "I'm with you. Your words is my words. I proved it to you, Moses. You there were no flies in the land is out of season. And you said, "Let there come flies." And there come flies. That's creation. &gt;&gt; Who can blame darkness over the earth but God? &gt;&gt; You said, "Let there be darkness." And there was darkness. &gt;&gt; You said, "Let there be frogs." And the frogs even got in Pharaoh's house in the beds and when they piled them up and great heaps. creator and I have spoke to you Moses and and made my word create through your lips. &gt;&gt; I made you actually a god before Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I've done all this and here they come to a place of little trial come up and Moses begin to cry, what shall I do? &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this is a great lesson here now. I I love this. See Moses if we read here right that mo when the children begin to get scared they seeen Pharaoh coming in the line of duty God have performed everything perfectly now he started them on the journey he's got the church together they've been called out they come from every denomination they all got together Moses went back there and said Lord what must I do he said well go do this all right go ahead now Moses you know I've called you to do this yes Lord all right you go speak this'll be here come the flies speak for this here it comes do this here it come everything was thus Sayith the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord. Thus sayeth the Lord. Now it gets into a trouble and God said now I've got them started on their journey. They're all done called out. The church is together. So I've got him on the journey. Now Moses, take them on over. I told you I'm going to sit down and rest a while. &gt;&gt; Moses said, "Oh Lord, look coming here. Here comes Pharaoh. The people are all What must I do? What must I do?" See there? Isn't that just human being? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Begin to cry. What must I do? Here we see Moses expressingly fully human nature. Always wants God to get behind you and push you into something. Now that's us today. &gt;&gt; You want God after we've seen all we've seen, yet you want God to push you to do something. See, Moses had just laxed around said, "God, I'll go ask you to see what you say." Yeah. Yeah. You say, "All right, I'll say it, too." See, but here God had ordained him for the job, proved that he was with him, and here he is. circumstance comes up and then he begins crying what can I do Lord what can I do now you remember he had already prophesied here for he said these Egyptians you see today you'll seen no more and then immediately began to cry out God what can we do he done done a pretty good job in prophesying there see done told him what would happen if the word of God was in him it was in him &gt;&gt; and when he was telling that it actually come to pass what he said was already going to come to pass and here he was crying out what are we going to do &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, if that isn't human beings, &gt;&gt; if that isn't me, &gt;&gt; if that isn't me, &gt;&gt; it already prove what you say will happen. &gt;&gt; I'm with you. And you're a circumstance rose in a moment. What must I do? What must I do, Lord? Hey, Lord, where are you at? Hey, do you hear me? What must I do? And they had already ordained him and had vindicated him and proved and worked everything through. And he hear God. Oh my. Fully expressive. Man wants to rest and let God do the pushing. And yet he knew that God had anointed him for this job to do this. And God had clearly vindicated his claims. It was time for the people to be delivered. God through his miracles and wonders had brought them all together in one group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brought them all together in one group. &gt;&gt; Amen. vindicate his claims. Scripture said so. Here was a sign. Here was the evidence. Here everything that he said. Then he come among as a prophet. Whatever he said, God honored it. &gt;&gt; Even to create and bring up flies and to put things in existence and everything that he had promised him here, he done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he wanted to wait on thus sayeth the Lord. See, he should have known that the very vindication of his call was thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; His job that he was ordained to was thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you get it? &gt;&gt; Why did he wait on thus sayeth the Lord? He wanted, Lord, what can I do here? I brought these children out this far. Here's the circumstance. Pharaoh's coming. They're all going to die. What must I do? What must I do? &gt;&gt; He had already predicted what he was going to do. He had already told just exactly what you were doing. He predicted the end of the very nation he was brought up in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. &gt;&gt; Moses already said, "You'll not see him anymore. &gt;&gt; God's going to destroy him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They made fun of you long enough. &gt;&gt; God will destroy him. It already predicted what would happen to him. Then Lord, what must I do? &gt;&gt; See the human nature there? &gt;&gt; What must I do? I'm going to wait for thus sayith the Lord. Yes sir. I'll see what the Lord says and I'll do it. Remember there was a Pharaoh had raised up and didn't know Joseph you know in that time right at that time see and Moses stood right up and predicted the end of that nation &gt;&gt; and here he was right to the place where it was to be happen then he cries out what must I do Lord what must it do &gt;&gt; see isn't that human beings &gt;&gt; isn't that human nation what shall I do he was already prophesied God had honored everything he said and he was called for the job so why did he have to say what must do there was in need. Is this up to him to speak for it? &gt;&gt; God wanted Moses to put that gift of faith that he had given him to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God had vindicated it. It was the truth. &gt;&gt; And God wanted Moses wanted the people to see that he was with Moses and he back there. He waited saying, "Now Lord, I'm just a baby. You tell me now." "Yeah, I'll go do this. I got thus sayith the Lord, brother. Is that thus sayith the Lord?" "Yes." Yes, brother Moses. That's thus sayith the Lord. Yeah. Okay, we got it now. Thus sayith the Lord and it happened. Never fail one time. &gt;&gt; Never did fail. &gt;&gt; And here it is in the circumstances. Comes up again. Now he's got him on the journey. The church is already called out. &gt;&gt; Got him on the journey and they're moving up. And Moses started crying out, Lord is thus sayith the Lord. What must I do? All right. God wanted Moses that faith that he had put in in that gift that he had clearly vindicated God had clearly proved to Moses and the people that it was him by the word and by the things that was said come to pass. &gt;&gt; It was clearly identified. There was no need of him worrying anymore about it. &gt;&gt; See, there's no more of him thinking anything about because it was already cleared up. He had already done these things. He had already proved by uh flies and fleas that he spoke things into creation &gt;&gt; that the word of God was in him. So here he is want to ask now what to do when the circumstances lays right before him. See, oh &gt;&gt; I hope this goes way down to us and we can see where we're at. See &gt;&gt; how it make you feel about that being &gt;&gt; thinking about Moses telling his false look at ours. &gt;&gt; Here he was standing there. See, know that the scripture said that that was the hour and day for that to happen. and know that God had met him in a pillar of fire and it went right down before the people and performed these miracles and everything he said had come to pass even bringing things into creation &gt;&gt; doing the things that only God could do showing that his voice was God's voice and here was a circumstance with that people that he was raising up bringing on to the promised land and then was standing crying what must I do &gt;&gt; that's a human being won't as brother Roy Slaughter I believe he's sitting outside the door there told me one time about somebody doing something to me and I said, "Well, I did this and now is that." He said, "Brother Brandham, let him lean on your shoulder today and tomorrow you pack them." And that's just the way human beings is. Lean on your shoulder today and tomorrow you pack them. That's that's what Moses is doing. God had to pack him long after he had ordained him and proved it to do it. &gt;&gt; And the people already said, "Moses, say the word." &gt;&gt; I seen you do it there. God honored you there. You're the same one today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He ought to have known it, but he didn't. All right. Just as it was then, so is it now. We find out that So he said, "Mo, God must just got enough of it." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God must got fed up on it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why are you crying to me about? Haven't I already proved my identification? Haven't I told you that I sent you for the job? Didn't I tell you to go do this? Didn't I promise that I'd do this? I'd be with your mouth and I'd speak through you and I'd do this and you'd show signs and wonders. Didn't I promise to do it? Have not I did just exactly destroy every enemy from around you? And here you are standing out here now at the Red Sea right in the line of duty what I told you to do and then still hollering and crying to me. &gt;&gt; Don't you believe me? Can't you see that I sent you to do this? Oh, that isn't human being. So he just must got pretty well fed up on it. And he said, um, you know, you have need of it. You know, if you go take these children over to that promised land, that's exactly you're pinned up here in the corner. There ain't nothing else you can do. So there's a need. What are you crying to me about? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What you looking at me for? What you calling on me about? Haven't I approved it to the people? Haven't I approved it to you? Haven't I called it? Isn't it scriptural? Didn't I promise to take this people to that land? &gt;&gt; Didn't I call you and tell you I would do it? Didn't I call and say I'd sent you to do it and it wasn't you, it was me and I go down and I be with your lips and whatever you said I I'd vindicate it and prove it to haven't I done it. &gt;&gt; Then when any little thing comes up way act like a baby or be a man, speak to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then move forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; There you are. Don't cry. Speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. &gt;&gt; What are you crying to me about? &gt;&gt; Just speak to the people and go forward to your objective. &gt;&gt; Whatever it, if it's sickness or whatever it is to raise the dead or whatever it is, speak. &gt;&gt; I proved it. Speak to the people. What a lesson. What a lesson. &gt;&gt; Oh my. At this stage of the journey where we're standing, &gt;&gt; look where we're at now. Yes, sir. At the third pull. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice we're right here at the door &gt;&gt; of the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was anointed for the job and still waiting for thus sayeth the Lord. God must just got enough of it. He said, "Don't cry anymore. Speak. I sent you." Oh, God. What? This church ought to be this morning. &gt;&gt; God's perfect of vindication. But the pillar of fire and the signs and the wonders, everything just like it was in the days of Sodom. He said it would return back. Here's the world in his condition. There's a nation in his condition. There's a women in the condition. There's a man in the condition. There's a church in the condition. There's everything the elements signs flying saucers and everything in the skies and all kind of mysterious things. And the sea of roar and tidal waves man's heart failing. Fear perplexed the time distress between nations. the church falling away and a man of sin rising up who oppose himself above all is called God. He that sth in the temple of God showing himself a whom oh my and it's come to this nation and the church is organized and all of them gathered together as harlots to the and everything exactly in the way whoredom. hoard them. What is it telling women they can cut their hair? Telling women they can wear a shorts. Tell men if they can do this and they can do that and preachers they do this in a social gospel and things. Don't you see it's committing adultery with the true word of God. And God has sent us his true word undenominational no strings tied to it. And give us a pillar of fire. The Holy Ghost has been with us now for 30 years. And everything that he's predicted and said come to pass exactly. &gt;&gt; That's right. Speak to the people and let's go forward. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got an objective. That's glory. Let's move to it. We're headed to the promised land. &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Speak to the people. Haven't I proved it? Haven't I even had my picture made among you and everything else and done everything that could be done to prove that I'm with you? Doesn't the magazine just a few weeks ago packed the article when you said here at the pull pit what would take place out here three months beforehands and there it went taking place and vindicated. Even the science knows about it. And everything that I've done and you're still waiting. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Speak to the people and go forward to your objective. Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Didn't Nathan tell David, Nathan the prophet one time said he seeing David the anointed king, he said, "Do all that's in your heart for God is with you." &gt;&gt; Told David, "Do all that's in your heart. God's with you." Joshua was anointed to take the land for God and for his people. The day was short. He needed more time for the job that he was anointed and commissioned to do. Joshua, a man, he was anointed. God told him, "As I was with Moses, I'll be with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. That land, I'm going to give it to him. I want you to go over there and clean out the Amalachites and and the he all all the others, the Philistines and and the Persites and all the different ones. Clean them out. I'm with you. I no man will stand before you all the days of your life. &gt;&gt; No man can bother you. Go on in there. And Joshua draw that sword and said, "Follow me." And he got over there and here was fighting. And what was it? He routed the enemy. There were little bunches here and little bunches there. When night time come, they'd all get together and garrison together and come with a big force against him. And the sun was going down. He needed more light. &gt;&gt; The sun was going down. He didn't fall on his knees and said, "Lord God, what shall I do? What shall I do?" He spoke. &gt;&gt; He had a need. He said, "Son, stand still." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't cry to nothing. He commanded. &gt;&gt; Son, stand still. I've got a need of this. I'm the servant of the Lord anointed for this job. I've got a need. Stand still and don't you shine and moon you hang where you're at. &gt;&gt; So he fought the battle through and whipped the whole thing on &gt;&gt; and the sun obeyed him. &gt;&gt; No crying out. He spoke to the son said, "You stand still. &gt;&gt; Son, hang there and moon. You stay where you're at." He didn't cry out, "Lord, now what can I do? Give me some more sunlight." He had needed sunlight, so he commanded it. And the sun obeyed him. Oh my. &gt;&gt; He commanded the sun to stand still. Samson, anointed, raised up, ordained of God, given a gift of power, was ordained to destroy the nation of the Philistines. ordained, born on the earth, anointed of God to destroy the Philistines. And one day they caught him out in the field without his sword, without a spear, and a thousand of those armored Philistines run upon him at one time. Did he get out and say, "Oh Lord, I'm wait for a vision. Oh Lord, what must I do? Direct me now what to do." He know he had a need. He found nothing but an old jawbone of a mule and he beat down a thousand Philistines. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He never cried to God. &gt;&gt; He used his anointed gift. &gt;&gt; He know that he was sent for the job. &gt;&gt; He know he was born for that. He know he was anointed with a gift. &gt;&gt; Then he beat down a thousand Philistines. He didn't cry to God. God ordained him and vindicated that he was by other things that he had done. And he was a vindicated, anointed servant of God to destroy the Philistines. And he did it. No matter what the circumstances was, he did it. &gt;&gt; He'd never asked nothing. That was his job. That God was dealing to pick up that mule bone and go to beating Philistines. &gt;&gt; How the while one lick with that thing across one of them inch and a half brass skulls like that would have shattered that bone into a million pieces. And he beat a thousand of them down and killed him and still stood with it in his hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask no questions. He didn't cry out. He spoke. &gt;&gt; He routed them. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Take the Philistine. Can I take the Philistines, Lord? I I know you sent me to do it, Lord. Yes, Lord. I know you sent me to destroy this nation of the Philistines. Now, here's thousands of them around me, and I ain't got nothing. What What am I going to do now, Lord? Oh my. Nothing's going to bother me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's anointed for the work. &gt;&gt; There's nothing can harm you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, not one thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He just took what he had and beat into him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. when the enemy fenced him in and said, "Now we get him in the walls. We got him now. We got him on the inside here with with this woman now. We got the good door shut all around everywhere and he can't get out. We got him." Samson cried, "Oh Lord, they got me all fenced in with this denomination. What am I going to do? I've joined up with it. What am I going to do?" He never did that. He just walked out and pulled down the gate on his shoulder and walked away with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was anointed for the job. is called of God. Didn't fence him in. &gt;&gt; No, indeed he tucked the gates with him. &gt;&gt; He didn't pray about it. He didn't ask God whether to do it or not. It was right in the line of duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Right in the line of duty. Why cry to me? Speak and go on. Amen. Don't cry. Speak. You're done. Quit whining and whimpering now or be old enough to speak. That's right. He knew his anointed gift of power could destroy any Philistine who stood before him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; But we don't know that. You see, &gt;&gt; we're still little babies and with a bottle in our mouth and he knew it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that God raised him up for that purpose. &gt;&gt; And there was nothing going to stand before him all the days of his life. Nothing could destroy him. He was raised for that purpose like Moses was. Nothing going to stop him. No Amalachites or nothing else can stop him. He's on the road to the promised land. &gt;&gt; Samson knew he was on the road. Joshua know he was taking the land. He was a vindicated. God's word promised it and the Holy Ghost was there vindicating it. He was on his road. So there nothing going to stand in his way. No sir. Right in the line of duty with God, there was nothing going to stand in his way. So he just picked up the gates and put them on his shoulder, weighed about four or five tons and walked up on top of the hill and sat down on them. nothing going to stand his way. He had an anointed gift from God. He didn't have cry, "Lord, what must I do now? He's already anointed to do it." That was thus sayaith the Lord. Get rid of him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get rid of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I raise you up for that purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What must I do, Lord? Okay. What am I going to do here at the Red Sea? Didn't I tell you that I give you a mountain for Sinai here? You're coming back to that mountain and you're going to take these children to the land. Didn't I call you for that purpose? Why are you worried about anything else standing awake? Speak and start moving. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; I called you for this purpose. &gt;&gt; David, he knew he was anointed and was a vindicated to be a good shot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He know. They know he was a good shot. David was anointed. He knew it. And when he stood before Goliath, he never cried, "Oh God, what must I do now? But but Messiah, I I know what you did in times past. You you you let me kill a bear and you let me kill a lion. But what about this Goliath out here? &gt;&gt; He never did that. He just spoke. What did he say? You will be like they were. &gt;&gt; He spoke and went forward. &gt;&gt; He never prayed a prayer. He never offered nothing. He know he was anointed. Amen. His anointed in that slingshot had proved the right kind of a thing. He had faith in his anointing. He had faith that God could direct that rock right straight in the middle of that helmet there with all the face could be hit. He stand there. He knowed he was a good shot. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knowed God made him that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He know he'd killed a lion. He know he killed a bear. But that was with his earthly father's possession. Here's his heavenly father's possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't get unless what was to do now, Lord? He spoke and said, "You will be like the lion and the bear." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He spoke and went forward to meet this Goliath. &gt;&gt; Oh, man. Regardless of his size, he's a little ruddy looking fellow. You know, he wasn't very big. He wasn't very handsome to look at. Little bitty draw up sort of a fella. The Bible said he was ruddy. Now, regardless of his size and his so-called ability to do so, you know, the the bishop told him said, "Now look here, son. That man's a theologian. See, he is a fighter. He was born a fighter. And he's a he's been a fighter from his youth. And you're no match for him. And his brother said, "Oh, you naughty thing. Come out here to do such a thing as that. Get on back home." That didn't bother him. &gt;&gt; Why? He knew he was anointed. &gt;&gt; The God that delivered me from that line. &gt;&gt; The God that delivered me from the paws of that bear. He'll more than that deliver me from that Philistine. Here I come. I meet you in the name of the Lord, God of Israel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't pray through. He's already prayed through. God prayed it through before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He was anointed for the job. He had to speak and go forward. &gt;&gt; That's all there was to do about it. &gt;&gt; Just speak and go forward. Oh, that's all there was to it. Oh, he didn't about his denominational brothers. Them scoffers stand there too, you know. Oh, yes. They were standing there saying scoffing and making fun and saying his brothers, you know, and said, "Oh, you can't you you're just naughty." That didn't move him a bit. &gt;&gt; You want to be different from somebody else. You just want to show off. If that been showing off, it had been so. But they only looked at the intellectual side. David know the anointing oil was on him. &gt;&gt; Make difference to him. He said that Philistine will be like the barren lion. So here I come. He predicted it before it happened. &gt;&gt; What did he do? He killed the bear. He killed the lion. He knocked the lion down with what? With with the uh with a slingshot and tuck a knife and then the bear lion. He killed the lion with a knife. That's the same thing he done Goliath. He knocked him down with a rock and pulled up his sword and cut his own head off right there before. What did he predict before it happens? And you will be as they are. &gt;&gt; Why? He spoke the word that it would be and then went forward to make it be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amenise the Lord. Oh brethren, he spake and tuck over the situation that day. If there ever was a time that man should speak, it's now. &gt;&gt; Closing just the next few minutes. If you can just bear a few minutes longer. I got some more things wrote down here. Some scriptures I want to get to. &gt;&gt; Peter never cried when he found a man that had faith enough to be healed laying at the gate called beautiful. He never got down and had an all night's prayer and or all days prayer, a big long prayer, and said, "Uh, Lord, I pray you now that you'll help this poor lane man. I see that he's got faith. I know he's a believer, and I've asked him." And he I I I He said he had faith. He'd believe what I told him. I've told him about this about what you did. And I I just think now, Lord, you can you give me a thus sayith the Lord for him? No. He knew that he was anointed apostle. He knowed that Jesus Christ commissioned him, "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils. As freely as you receive, freely give." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "Peter, go do that." He didn't have to pray through. He was commissioned. &gt;&gt; What did he say? He said, "In the name of Jesus Christ," he spoke the name of Jesus Christ. And the man just laid there, he picked him up by the hand and said, "Stand up on your feet." Amen. &gt;&gt; And he held him there until his ankle bones got strength and he started walking. Why? He never had an all night's prayer meeting. &gt;&gt; He never cried out to God. He knew positively from the lips of Jesus Christ. He was anointed for this work. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He spake and raised him up for he know he was anointed apostle for the purpose. The people that laid in his shadow never said, "Oh, come Apostle Peter and cry over us and pray the prayer of faith for us to God." No, no, they never said that. They knew he was anointed and a vindicated apostle of God. So they said, "Just let us lay in his shadow. &gt;&gt; You don't have to say a word. &gt;&gt; We know it. We believe it. Life within them the apostle couldn't get to them all. And they themselves, they're part of it. Moses said, "Is there something me going or we're all going?" &gt;&gt; And we all got something to do. We've all got to be anointed. &gt;&gt; And they seen that apostle stand there and seen him heal this sick man and do the things he did. They know he couldn't get to him. So they never said, "Peter, come and and offer prayer and wait now until he got thus sayith the Lord and come tell me." See what the Lord says. They said if we can only lay in his shadow because the very God that was in Jesus Christ is in him and we see the same thing doing. So they touched the border of Jesus garment and laid in his shadow and Jesus is in this man. If that shadow can reflect upon be healed and the Bible said every one of them is healed &gt;&gt; only. &gt;&gt; No all night's prayer me said Lord if I go lay in the shadows of this apostle. No they knew it. &gt;&gt; The light has struck them. Their hearts was full. Their faith was let loose. Amen. They believed it. They'd seen it. Paul's hankies the same way. And I'm closing. Jesus never cried when they brought the maniac boy to him that had epilepsy falling into the fire. He never said, "Father, I'm your son and now you sent me here to do so and so and so. Can I heal this boy?" He never said. He said, "Come out of him, Satan." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He spoke and the boy was made well. &gt;&gt; When he met Legion with 2,000 devils in him, it wasn't Jesus of crying. It was the devils are crying. &gt;&gt; If you're going to cast us out, oh my sufferers to go in that herd of swine, Jesus said, "Now, father, am I able to do this?" He said, "Come out of him." &gt;&gt; And the devils took their flight. Sure, he knowed he was Messiah. At the grave of Lazarus, he'd been dead four days. They said, "If you would have been here, Lord, he would have not have died." He said, "I am the resurrection life." &gt;&gt; Now, were, when, or how &gt;&gt; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. &gt;&gt; He know who he was. He know what he was. &gt;&gt; He know that he was Emmanuel. He know he was a resurrection. He know he was life. He know that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; We seen them little people there and he seen that what God had told him that to do and there he was. He went down there. He never said now wait I'll kneel down here all of you kneel down. Pray. He said you believe it I'm able to do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Boy. It wasn't him. It was them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lord I believe that you're the son of God that was to come into the world. Oh, mother is identified. Something's got to happen. &gt;&gt; Lazarus come forth. He spoke. And a dead man come forth. Not can I. He just spoke. And when the faith was met, the thing happened. He spake. He spoke and the blind saw. The lame walked. The deaf heard. Devil screamed and come out. The dead was raised up. &gt;&gt; Everything. Why? He didn't pray through. He was anointed the Messiah. He was that Messiah. He knew he was. He knew his position. He know what he was sent to do. He know that the father had identified him to be the Messiah to the believer. And when he met that believer with faith, he just spoke the word. &gt;&gt; Devil scattered. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Speak. Don't cry. Speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he knew his God-given rights, but we don't. He knew what he was. We don't. Moses had forgot. Samson understood. Others understood. Joshua understood. Moses forgot. God had to call his attention to it. He said, "Why you crying to me? I sent you to do the job. Speak. Go on to your objective. I told you you'd come to this mountain. Take them children. Lead them all. Just speak. I don't care what's in your way. Move it out of the way. I gave you authority to do it. I spoke. You spoke flies and fleas and creation and things like that. Now, what are you hollering to me about? Why are you coming to me hollering these things? Just speaking. Watch it move. That's all. Oh my. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love it. Here Jesus, everything that he said, he just spoke the word and it was so God properly had a vindicated him to be his son. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him. Watch him. I like this. How bravely, how majestically he stood before his critics. Amen. He said, "Destroy this temple and I'll pray the Father and see what he does about it." &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple and I'll raise it up again. &gt;&gt; Not I hope to. I'm going to try to. I will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While the scripture said so, &gt;&gt; the same scripture that said he'd raise up his body. Give us the authority, the power. Amen. In mine they shall cast out devils. They'll speak with new tongues. If they take up serpents or drink deadly things, they won't harm them. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why cry unto me? Speak and go forward. Oh, bravely I destroy this temple. I'll raise it up again. Oh, and remember now we're closing. It was that same he. It was he that said in John 14:12, "The he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; It was he that said so. It was Jesus in Mark 11:24 that said, "If you say to this mountain, now if you pray to this mountain, if you say to this mountain, be moved." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you've said will come to pass, you can have what you've said. Now, you if you say it is presumptional, it won't happen. But if something in you that's you're you're anointed for the job and will know that it's the will of God to do it and will say it, it's got to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If ye, it was he that said this, if ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will and it shall be done to you. Oh my. Oh my. &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; Pardon this. It's just coming up in me. I got to say it. &gt;&gt; It was he that said that day up there on side of that woods, you have no gain. And he created three squirrels stand there before us. &gt;&gt; What is it? Just speaking the word. Say they'll be there and there and there and there they was. It &gt;&gt; was he that did that. &gt;&gt; Charlie, Rodney, it was he down there in Kentucky and Nelly and Margie and the rest of you. It was he, that same God that was back there and spoke to Moses said, "Why do you cry to me? Speak the word." &gt;&gt; It was he that brought them into existence. &gt;&gt; It's he. It's him. Oh my. It was he that gave the vision about a year ago that said we would go over there and these seven seals and how there would be a a a great thunder that would started off and it' be in a shape of a pyramid in there. The look mag life magazines packed and hang on the wall in there. It was he that said that. It was he that night when I was going down that road and you see that big mumba snake about to get my brother and he said you've been given power to bind him or any of the rest of them. It was he that said that to my little gay-headed wife sitting back there. It was he that morning that woke me up there in a room to stand in the corner said, "Don't fear to do anything or go anywhere or say anything for the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was he up Svenia Canyon about three months ago when I was praying wondering what was going to happen standing there and a sword dropped in my hand and said, "This is the king's sword." &gt;&gt; It was he. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was he that said to me, "As I was with Moses, so I'll send you." It was he that said to me 30 years ago down on the river on earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As a little boy stand there as a little preacher on the river 30 years ago, standing there when I light the same pillar of fire come down from the heavens and stood there and said, "As I sent John the Baptist to forun the first coming of Christ, your message shall forrun the second coming to all the world. How could it be when my own pastor laughed and made fun of it, but it happened just exactly that way? It was he that said it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh. Ah. It was he that said in prophecy to the vision, it shall come to pass. It was he that said, "If one among you prophesies or sees a vision and tells him it comes to pass, then remember it's not him. It's me. I am with him." &gt;&gt; Oh my. What could I go on? say, "It's he, it's he, it's he, it's he that come down." When I told them that the pillar of fire was down there on the river, and they couldn't believe it. It was he down there amongst that Baptist preaching for 30,000 people that night in the San Houston Coliseum when that angel of the Lord had his picture taken standing there. It was he, the same yesterday, today, and forever. It was he that foretold where these things would be. It was he that said this. It was he that done these things. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's done everything just exactly like he said he would do it. Amen. Why should I wait? &gt;&gt; God's a vindicated the word. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Let's journey. Let's walk. Let's go on the walk of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Laying aside all doubts, all sins. Clean up the house. Scrub it up. As Junior Jackson's vision said, there was nothing left but lamps or his uh dream if he's sitting here. Nothing left but lamps. They had gold bands around them in the dream that he g me the other night. Oh my. Brother Collins, don't worry about that fish. It was white. You just didn't know how to handle it. Lay aside everything else contrary to it. Remember, this is truth regardless of how fanatically it seems and everything else sometimes. Move right on with it. It's the Holy Spirit, the same God that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead. The same one that can speak things into existence. The same one that lived in the days of Moses is the same today. &gt;&gt; Is called in this last day. He's a vindicated as it was in the days of Sodom. So shall it be in the coming of the son of man. He's done. There's Sodom down there. There's a Billy Graham and an Or Roberts out there. And the church is moving on by the same signs that he promised both places. And there they are. It's he that said it. Oh Lord, give me courage is my prayer. &gt;&gt; Help me, oh Lord God, I have to quit here. It's getting late. Why cry to me? Why are you crying to me when I've proved to be with you? Haven't I healed your sick? He'd say, "Haven't I told you things that happened just exactly?" Your pastor can't do that. Me, he can't. He's a man. It's me, the Lord. And he would say, "I'm the one that did this. I'm the one that tells him these things and say, "It's not him. It's my voice. I'm the one that raises up your dead when they drop down. I'm the one that heals the sick. I'm the one that foretells these things. I'm the one that does the saving. I'm the one that give the promise." God, give me courage to take that sword of the word that he put in my hands about 33 years ago and hold it and march forward to the third pull. &gt;&gt; Is my prayer. Let's bow our head. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, the hour is growing late, but the word is getting precious as we see it. Lord, time after time, never failing presence of Christ always meets with us. How I thank you for your goodness. How you spared us and been and blessed us. How we thank you for it. As I hold these handkerchiefs in my hand, Lord, it's people that has faith that believes this. May every devil, every sickness depart from them people. And I charge every spirit in here that's foul and not of God. Every spirit of sickness, all diseases and afflictions. Hallelujah. We're not laying in the shadow of man, which would be all right, but we're in the shadow of the gospel, vindicated gospel, as the great pillar of fire moves back and forth through this building. The same one that God looked down through and the Red Sea give up its course and Israel passed through. But now, as he looks, it's sprinkled with the blood of his own son. with mercy and grace. May we be obedient. May we today quit saying, crying out. May we realize that you've called us for this work. This is the hour. I speak it in the name of Jesus Christ. Let every sickness depart from this place. May every man and woman that calls on the name of Jesus Christ consecrate their life a new today. &gt;&gt; I consecrate mine, Lord, upon the altar of prayer. I lay myself down and shame my own self and turn my head towards the ground from where you took me. Lord God, I'm ashamed of my weakness and my unbelief. Forgive it, Lord. Give me courage. Give us all courage. I feel like Moses. We are all on a road out. We don't want to leave one. We want to take every one, Lord. They're yours. I claim them for you. Bless this people today, Lord. Grant it. Bless me with them, Father. and thy name shall be praised. Thy glory shall be thine. Give us this eternal faith. Lord, as we consecrate ourselves to thee now, me over this Bible, over this stand. I give you my life, Lord. I'm depending on every promise that you give. I know they will be confirmed. I know they are truth. Give me courage to speak these words. Give me courage, Lord. correct me in what I shall do and say. I give myself to you with this church along with it, Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. My faith &gt;&gt; I don't even know where to start. uh I feel like in instead of the ability to summarize, I have the ability to multiply. So I don't even want to get started. It's just such a a personal message &gt;&gt; to each individual to just know how to come in contact with this God and let him reveal himself for who he really is. that as the children of God, we are the ones that are go called to be at peace and not to be all worked up and and and and moved to and fro and and everything. You know, I I just thought to myself, how many believe this was a vindicated prophet? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, do you believe a vandicate prophet can speak a lie? If he's vindicated, you are vindicated. &gt;&gt; It's the same prophet. Jesus came by the words of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; You are coming by the word of this prophet, speaking &gt;&gt; you into existence, a people. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we could just grasp that we God has given us everything that we have need of as part of the journey. There's nothing that is left that we have to go figure out ourselves. He wants when we come against challenges do not run. Speak the word and move forward. &gt;&gt; Sickness come on the way we speak the word. Sickness will go away. &gt;&gt; Challenges come. Whatever it is, you speak the word, you go forward. It has nothing to do about God being mad at you and everything or whatever. No, you speak the word and you move forward. &gt;&gt; You he said some of them don't even have to pray. &gt;&gt; They just spoke the word and move. He said I I have a job to do. I need the sun. I need more lights. Sun stand still. &gt;&gt; You can't explain that until today. Did the sun stop or do was it was it the earth that stopped? go figure that out. &gt;&gt; It happened. &gt;&gt; God has never left his people to wonder. &gt;&gt; He's I I just thought when he said it's he it's the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. It's the He says the pillar of fire is move. How many believe the pillar of fire is moving in this room? &gt;&gt; It's the word of God coming to manifest. Let's all stand. I don't want to I just I just wanted to speak to your heart tonight and and if we could just from your own mouth I just ask that we just say a prayer and say Lord open my eyes and help me to see what is it that you're really talking about. Father, we are called to be a people, an overcoming people, not a people that would crumble through challenges that the devil can just come and create whatever mess he wants in our lives and families and and everywhere that Father, we can possess our lands. And we know that this land has been given to us. This the our families, everything that we come, you've given it to us. We have the right to speak the word and see it come to pass. You've called us in the same time, not to be babies and cry out. You've called us to cry out to you, to let the word, to speak the word. He said one place, he said, Moses had already spoken what was going to happen to the Egyptian. He said, "Fear, don't fear. Whatever you see here, you shall see them no more. The Lord will manifest himself." And then he turns around and starts crying. And I was telling brother Matthew I said that's what we do you know Peter standing imagine Peter prayer oh this man came and you know maybe he wants to be a believer we really don't know Lord if you can if you will that doesn't look effective to me &gt;&gt; God wants us to know what we are doing to have confidence in him and confidence in what he's made us to need when we when we go home, when we go in our daily lives, you you you we need and I I'm just speak to myself. I want to have the confidence to know that I'm a child of God. I'm operating as a believer and I have the right to conquer whatever is coming in front of me to bring in that subjection and not to be tossed by every wind of of of challenges that comes and and go go home all winded out and tired and can't do anything. No, I'm called to possess. I'm called to to to be a child of God. I'm called to manifest the characteristics of the bride in the end time. I was elected since the beginning, the foundation of the world. My name was in the lamb's book of life. And I'm here manifesting God for the generation and the people that I'm coming in contact with. I need to have that in certainty, not just a mind understanding, but the reality in my life. if each could just lift your hand and pray out to him. Just ask them from your own heart and say, "Lord, I don't want to be one crying out all the time. I want to be have the ability to speak. Oh Lord, help me wherever I'm failing. I I I want to just cry out to you so you could help me understand the position and the things that you are doing. You don't save someone today to lose him tomorrow or or go give me the Holy Spirit today, take it out tomorrow so I can look for it. No. What you do is certain, is perfect. It doesn't change. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. I'm standing on a foundation, a firm foundation, not a shaky foundation. You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, we just pray and and I lift my hands tonight. Lord, this message is sincerely to my own heart, Lord. And I just see my own life and the things that I'm going through and and often time I forget who I am and what you've called me to be, oh God. And we just pray, lift our hands and say, Lord, for whatever the situation is in our lives, Lord, you've called us to move forward. At the end of the day, Lord, you've called us to manifest you in this generation. And however manner you choose, Lord, I pray that you give us that uncction, that anointing, Lord, to know to walk by by the very seed that's inside of us to know that we are the possessor of eternal life. We are the possessor of the situation that you've given us the power and the authority father not to go and just speak out of term and out of everything but father to be in line with the revealed word of the hour and to know what is it that we are called to do. Lord help us I pray each one tonight Lord and I pray that you just go around this room and those that are listening father that you may just drop yourself into our hearts Lord. Father, your prophet said that you you sent Moses and they said and then you turn around and said it was God going into the form of a man. Lord, today it's no different. Lord, when I read that, I see that it's God going into the form of a believer to do to perform his own word in what he really wants it to be. Help us, Lord. Forgive our sins. Forgive our shortcomings. We commit what we are into your hands. I pray, Father, that if we've done anything that's not pleasing to you, let the blood of your son cleanse us of all unrighteousness. But once all of that is said and done, Lord, we want to possess our land and the portion that you've given us. We want to be an effective believer, one that can go and have an effect on others that we can speak and it will see it come to pass. that we will conduct ourselves in a manner that will show forth the very work that you've done in our lives for everything that you've done. We commit those that are sick and afflicted remembering our pastor Lord that you may give them a safe travel and a successful meeting Lord committing all that we are into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's just sing that as brother of Matthew comes. God gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer. There is no more for heaven now to give him. He is mine. My righteousness and freedom.
