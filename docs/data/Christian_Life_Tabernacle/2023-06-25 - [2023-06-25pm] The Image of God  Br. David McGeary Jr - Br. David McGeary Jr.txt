just go before him gracious Heavenly Father you are still taking the things which are wrong and making them right father we stand on the this side of the Fall where sin is entered in and or there's many things that we don't understand that don't make sense and father there's a day that we'll talk it all over when it's all clear and we have a perfect understanding and we no longer look through a glass Darkly but we clearly understand the way we went and why we went those ways and father we know now that it's all to your glory and maybe even why we don't understand it you're still working things to your good father the the things that were meant for wrong you will take and use them for the right Lord we thank you that we can stand here that we can Fellowship around the things of Eternal value Lord that lives can be changed and Lord you can draw near us and walk and talk with us along the way Commit This service to you father we ask that you would have the preeminence that it wouldn't be man that we could step aside father this is your bride that you could speak to her Lord we long to hear your voice Commit This service to you Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles may do a couple scripture readings but we'll just let the Lord have his way we're going to read out of the Book of Genesis the first chapter 26th verse and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him Mel and female created he them God bless you you may be seated there's two books of the Bible that the devil hates the most it's the Book of Genesis in the Book of Revelations because in the Book of Genesis we see the beginning of all things we see things as they're intended to be Jesus would even say because of the hardness of your heart you sought to put away your wives but from the beginning it wasn't so and he's he's speaking back to things that are spoken right in the Book of Genesis HID from the wise and prudent and even in that that scripture reading where Jesus says that he he confounds them you know they they brought to him a parable and they said hey this man he's been married seven times or this what woman's been married seven times one to each brother and just on down who's who's bride will he will she be in eternity not knowing they're speaking to the very author of The Plan of Salvation the one who's had a heart intent in how Man was created and he answers them the sons of God are neither married nor given into marriage but we see uh that here that's um that was free so we'll just hopefully proceed in the thought we want to Fellowship around the image of God and I believe there's a lot of Liberty that we can have a freedom we could have an understanding uh whose image we're made in there's a a turmoil as as you grow and you find that you have something that is uh made after a different nature and you can definitely say well I don't believe that to be the image of God God doesn't steal God doesn't cheat God doesn't bear fault with false witness but I find that when I was growing up I for some reason when I was at the Piggly Wiggly that pack of gum looked really good and I took that pack of gum now my mom knows I didn't have any money and now Davey Jr is chewing on some gum where did you where did you get the gum you know I don't even remember what I said but it didn't take her long to figure out that you know I'd taken it and in the I get taken back to apologize to the store manager but where did that nature come on come in what was that image what is that image declaring and that causes I think a lot of confusion for us as growing up because we don't understand sin nature we don't understand why that has to be a part of who we we are but we're set in a battle and the the word of God has given to us for us to overcome so we just want to Fellowship around what your true image is and it the desire to manifest that if you uh look over in the Book of Genesis just maybe across the margin in chapter two you'll find that there's a further creation and the brother Branham speaks to this beautifully and questions and answers on the Book of Genesis he walks us through the very creation of God I believe that was preached in 53. um might have the date in here somewhere but questions of books about questions and answers on the Book of Genesis these two creations of Adam are pondered at by theologians by men and I had a friend Brother Scott Walker he's going to Baylor having to do seminaries a minimal class and they look at these two scriptures and they think it must be two different authors and these books have just been combined together because in second chapter there's another creation and that you can read in the in the fifth verse it says God had not caused the rain it had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground so here's Adam created male and female created he them he's in the image of God we know God is a spirit the truth that this message has brought us in the it we take it for granted I mean we just we've been given the very thought intent heartbeat of God by a god-ordained prophet who can open and I I'm probably gonna do a bit of reading because this is one of my favorite uh Mysteries being revealed of the understanding of this scripture so now Adam has made and the Lord formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostril a breath of life and Man became a living soul so you have a spirit man you have to understand that your Spiritual Beings there was an image of God that was created that was a spirit man male and female created he them then he creates a body out of the Flesh of the Earth the dust of this Earth what is it of the Earth the dust of this Earth and then he breathes into it and gives it life that Spirit now Tabernacles into a body the beautiful thing is is this is God unfolding and he follows this pattern right onto where he takes Eve out of Adam so it's gonna hopefully uh try to read some of this God created man male and female created man male and female now that's think about the first point now in Genesis 2 7 it was he formed underscored but first he created Hallelujah he got then he got that underscored and he's talking about the question Man Out of the Dust and breathed into his nostrils and so forth now what is the difference or where is the connection to the above scriptures they're they're asking how can this atom be created and then this atom be created and and how can they be connected I find we ask ourselves the same question still to this day how can this thing right here how can this be David McGeary when there's something else inside of me that has another identity that's in the image of God but what's this amen so I'll be skipping around a bit I hope you could try to keep up with me but I I am going to be reading probably primarily from here amen 15th uh chapter there he says well now if you'll notice close Genesis 1 28 6 let's get the first part of this God said let us let us now let us us make man in our own image of course we realize he's talking to someone so he even steps back and follow the pattern there was something unfolding already at that point now that man's ran off and and made three persons of a trinity but this is a pro prophets view now we get to go with him into a mystery that was to be revealed at this last time if you notice in creation the first thing was created of course was light you come on down through creation the last thing was created what was man and woman was made after man all right first last thing that was created God creation is mankind but when God made his first man if you notice he made him in the likeness of himself he was made in the image of God and what was it God now we find out God a kind of man he was made he goes through he talks about how God's a spirit down in the 20th he says now the next verse is I want God is a spirit and they that was that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now if God created man on his in his own image in his own likeness what kind of man did he create as Spirit man amen he had made all creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now and the question that God give dominion of the cattle the fishes and everything to the man but his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the Beast of the field like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today so what was the pattern Dominion what are we to be led by the spirit what's it to have dominion and you you catch a vision when you start to think of a man who's going to go and have dominion over a field he's going to be wanting to express something in the way he would have dominion you know you know today the Sheep should go up on the hill I you know what I I want to I see this move this way do this and he's speaking to the very creation because he's orchestrating something that is pleasing to him what is our desire to be pleasing to the Lord we want the Holy Spirit to if something's out of order when Christ was here he comes upon a tree that's not bearing fruit it's not even in its season it's not supposed to bear fruit but if it's the Creator what was it given to be pleasing to him he's the only one who could sit there this isn't pleasing to me you're not manifesting what I would desire you to manifest and he curses it and and that's the Dominion we have we're very the nature itself is subject to us that's the image of God the and the Dominion we're to have amen now this is where he gets gets beautiful now if God created man his own image in his own likeness he created them God give dominion cattle 22. he was in other words Adam was the first man in the lower creation the first creation of God himself out of God came to logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word the beginning of the word the word was with was God the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us out of the logos came forth the man oh I got a beautiful picture in my mind now I can take a little trip with me take a look can you take a trip with me and go back a little while let our minds right now we're going to talk about and he takes us back a hundred million years before there ever was a star a moon or anything in the world to do that we understand now what the the speed of light is you know you you we look at it this way you know if you can see it you know 10 million light years out there and that light is just getting to you then that light took 10 million years to get to you he's saying let's just speed up now he steps past the speed of light he steps back into before there was a molecule or anything and he's going to tell us how this creation started to come about how God could say let us how can he say let us what what transpired at the before the very book of gen when he's saying let us make man in our in our image now he's going to reveal that mystery because we're not trinitarians but that's our scripture it's been manhandled it's been perverted but we need we can see the true word of God amen now looking at beyond the banister see what things happening now no man has seen the father at any time no man can see God in the body form because God is not a body God is a spirit no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father have to clear them but notice there's nothing just space No Light no Darkness there's nothing nothing you can't comprehend nothing if you think you're following me I still don't understand nothing all right but we by faith can say things we don't understand we believe it all right God supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all space of all things all time he was Everlasting from ever outlasting he's the beginning of the creation that's God amen by him all things are made amen can't see nothing can't hear nothing nothing not a move of an atom in the air not nothing no nothing but yet God was there Hallelujah now watch a few minutes Hallelujah that's the father it's nothing to express them has it even started to form anything yet you see a loneliness there I mean there's nothing but there's now a heart and tent is going to start to unfold down in 30. now no one has seen God now the next thing we begin to see by the eyes of Supernatural looking amen we got Supernatural eyesight by a supernatural message amen see a little light forming out there what was that that was called by the Bible readers logos the anointed or the anointing as it was going to say the part of God being developed into something so human beings could have some type of an idea of what it was a little light moving that was the word of God amen now God gave himself birth to the son which was before there was even an atom now we have sonship now we have father amen the heir to make an atom see Jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world see way back Yonder now I'm going to move on down I I could uh we could just play the tape I agree but this is this is life to me there's some that some things I just want to highlight and then we'll just let the Lord have the Liberty but just follow me now we're setting the platform on what we just want to Fellowship about the image that we're made in and to understand it you really do have to go back and see it in the in the beginning so we're just going to step through it 34th paragraph and when he did an atom bursted and the sun came into existence when he said let there be light just before he says I can hear him say let there be light and what did that come from we know that came from Christ and then he said Adam bursted into the sun came into existence she Whirled for a hundred of millions of years forming clinkers burning then down in 35 now watch now beautiful he made the Sun and then the first thing you know a big clinker fell off of it weighed about as much as the Earth went then the logos here now the Son of God is watching it amen is watching his creation unfold he says 100 Millionaires and he stops it the same God who hung the stars and told them where to shine is the same God who can say stop no further don't go anymore you could be at a point in your life and many will testify to it that there came a point where it was stopped that's the last time my brother Matthew tells a testimony of where he he was not in the place he was supposed to be doing things he wasn't supposed to be doing yet God could apprehend that falling star that clinker that's just shooting off and say stop no more we were all going straight we were just traveling through space we were a little light we didn't know where we didn't even know how we're to be hung our position the place we would be we're just going through space and time no understanding but God had a picture and he said stop right there he hung you right there the same creation pattern a principle he takes things that seem to make no sense have no order and he hangs him right where he wants him to be he's forming the very Stars you look out in the sky the same way and what are they doing now he's got something in his mind what is he doing he's writing this first Bible Hallelujah the first Bible was ever looked at in the Stars was the Zodiac and it's perfect it's just dovetailed with the Bible it starts out first through a virgin the second then he comes the line of the tribe of Judah draw it all out the cancer age and everything gone down now he put that all in the sky and placed it all all these meteors he goes in and he says science today will try to tell you those things and they'll go land on it you know they do it now they go land on a I guess a meteor an asteroid and they grab some of the dust from it and drill and get a Core sample and they take it back to Earth and they say this is a million billion years old there can't be no Creation in seven days they just didn't hear the message they didn't understand how God formed it he didn't their the them in their wisdom it's been hit from them amen paragraph 42 and now we get to Genesis 1 we get to the Bible out of the picture Genesis the world was formed and void water upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the Water Hallelujah he Broods how does he do it how does he start to cause something to to take form by his spirit he brewed he's a brooder I mean he reflects that all through nature our Prophet taught us you could take a puppy dog and tie it down on an egg and it'll create the right atmosphere to hatch an egg what do we believe in we believe in the Holy Spirit coming brooding over his word allowing it to come to pass you you have to have atmosphere you have to have the spirit he created the very Earth that way it's in a time it's in a season it's unfolding God has principles he has patterns amen amen 43 and he got all these things together made all these things all the animal life the birds the bees the monkeys and whatever it was put all of it in the earth and he asked the question let us who Father and Son make man in our own image 45 now the man led the cattle and everything just like the Holy Spirit leads a real True Believer today the voice of God out there the voice of man rather could speak and say call the cattle this way call the Sheep over to the pasture call the fishes to the water amen now he was laying there 47. you can have a picture Adam standing this way see him standing there like a tree God made him he was dead as he could be this is and to he's referring to the Genesis 2 now he was dead as he could be his toes like Roots sticking into the ground and God said let there be breathe the breath of life into him and he jumped came to himself he was breathed the Breath of Life in him he became a living soul amen he made the butter the we'll just read this out and then God taken from his side a piece of a rib and made a woman where did he get the spirit of a woman see in 126. let us make man in our own image after our own likeness created he them man and female he made the Burly Spirit of the man he made the tender little delicate feminist spirit for the woman I want to pause here because this is the pattern that we see repeated at Calvary when Christ was crucified they took a spear they pierced his side that was the bride being taken from the side of Christ and were to be bone of his bone were to be of his spirit and we're to reflect the very nature of Christ that's our image that's where we're from there we don't have a part in this without them if you if you want to know who you are you're hitting Christ your position is in Christ you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you don't have a place outside of Christ matter of fact everything that doesn't have an eternal representation anything that wasn't in him in the very beginning it has no it has no Eternal representation How can there be those who are Eternal that they were never part of them so what you want to know is who you are in him you don't want to know who you are in this you're being led by something else anytime you're letting this Define you and you think you're fine in a reality it's blind leading blind you think you're doing something that you be you you be dead you have no Eternal representation you you're you know you're not going to be there that this flesh is a fallen nature if it's not redeemed it perishes with the Earth there's a Redemptive Redemption plan so we've covered where we came from a Heavenly image an image of God and it's beautiful because we see ourselves there I'm going to skip down to 54. he you know when he made a covenant with that Adam with with Abraham he it was a Grace Covenant he it wasn't dependent on anything Abraham would do but he said I've intended this so he knew he was going to have some women so he just made their Spirit right there amen there's your representation right it's the it's talking of the Bride I'm seeing myself I'm a part I couldn't be separate I can't be separated from him I'm a part of them he can't be complete in the whole without me he didn't make Adam a man he said he made Adam male and female created he them yeah Adam wouldn't have been complete without what the prophet's now saying the Bible said he did First Genesis 1 26 he created him man in the prefigure male and female Amen in the pre-figure he made the woman and the man before their ever formed Out of the Dust of the Earth amen glorious when God made man not his own image the body's not the image of God this body is the image of Beast and that you can go and study that out he takes Ephesians 1 he says but he he talks about now I think it's good for us to understand is is sin nature and he says a man without the Holy Ghost is a beast so you have a flesh that is he says in many cases worse than nature it could be even worse than nature even though nature is already in a fallen State the the the the Infidel a man can be can be worse than nature itself but we've been chosen in Christ Ephesians 1. according to death he has chosen us before the foundation of the world now the first man 61 he made the first man in His image and we are returning back to that image that's right to the first created image hallelujah our hope is understanding a theophany body and and getting a new body it's it's something this message tells us about we Fellowship around it but it's not that we have to abide in this sin nature but we've been given the first fruits that testified that there's an image that God had of us before the foundation of the world that was perfect and blameless before him in love that we are the very image of God so the purpose of it the heartbeat of it was Fellowship it's the only way he can have communion it's you it's a perfect type of man and wife in Christ in the church it was so he could how think of Adam now being able to look upon a very expression a part of him and he's not looking at someone as if he didn't never know him he could actually understand Eve as a part of who he was he had a complete understanding of who he was now she was made a byproduct of a man for a purpose and this teaching as brother Branham would go through it he lets us understand now that that's where it started now we've come it now through the fall we're in in sin 72 now hear God just exactly between the Oneness the Trinity you've got this thing exactly right now between him he says it's neither of them when God dropped unfolded himself down till he come down to this man now man sinned not in his spirit but in his body that we know this I lust passion and when he sinned he separated him from himself from the maker and then God the logos the creator of him came down and made the image of the man man was made in the image of God and then was made the image of the Beast he fell Hallelujah God came down in the image of man in the man Christ Jesus to suffer pain God could not suffer pain in the spirit how would he suffer physical pain in the spirit he couldn't do it so God unfolded himself and was made in the image of man to redeem man that was lost and then God's suffering In the Flesh First Timothy 3 16 without controversy that argument great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh scene of angels preached on to the Gentiles and believed and received up and I he didn't say Gentiles he paused it the right hand of the Father God himself came down and lived in a human body and suffered temptation God in Christ reconciling the world to himself now it's important to recognize your position in Christ because Christ came in the flesh and was Victorious he conquered it all so your Victory is not you're not hanging your hat on this you're you're you are trusting in the righteousness of the Lamb the body that would that overcame it for you was Christ Jesus who came in the likeness of sinful flesh was tempted In the Flesh in every manner as we were and if you don't see yourself in him if you don't reconcile yourself crucified with Christ if you don't see your position in Christ you have no part of them the Revelation the the the new birth brother Brandon would say is a revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally as your savior no man can confess he is the Christ saved by the spirit you can't have a revelation of Jesus Christ as your savior but by the spirit of God so you have a lot of confession but they don't even know who he is they have no true understanding of Jesus Christ they don't have an understanding of the logos they don't have this message because if you were the word you you had as a Son of God Son and Daughter of God you had representation before the foundation of the world job where were you when the foundations were laid when the Sons and Daughters of God shouted for Joy where were you and he's now going to counsel job and tell him that you don't think you got the grasp on this that you think you got right right because we see from this vantage point we have five senses has anybody seen their theophany God is a spirit you couldn't see it when he made the first Adam it was a logos word representation was there but that's a spiritual still representation we weren't even comprehend it with these five senses so he's he's uh revealing himself to a bride that's going to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Hallelujah but let me yeah I'm gonna just skip through this it's Rich amen I love this view that we have into the beginning of the creation of God brother Branham would pick this up this is early in the ministry if you will but I don't see any difference he was a prophet then I think the trumpet was sounding the word was going forth the Mysteries were being revealed this is this is prophetic insight that is the mind of God being revealed to a predestinated people that would receive it and it recognized their position in Christ amen Hallelujah what I would think that we would all be able to do and identify with night it's because he's made us this way is in that type of taking Eve out of Adam and that is the very reflection of calvary as we look there if you're wondering why you desire on the inside and feel there's a call and a burn in a drawing it's because it's that relationship with Christ that has to satisfy that we've been given a way to understand and comprehend the invisible things of God are clearly made manifest in the visible things around us he gave us a way to comprehend his principles and the way he works he declares himself in nature and from the very beginning the very thing he desired most reflect himself in was the type of man and wife in Christ in the church he did that with Adam and Eve so if you don't you don't have to be very spiritual I would not think to understand that the why is that attacked most in this day you know love wins and you got these this idea of it's a perversion what is it attacking it's attacking the very heartbeat of God the thing he chose to reflect himself in and what he is love right everything else is a perversion he's love and in that we find our position because it's not a popular gospel but the woman is subject to the man there has to be a headship when we're a part of the body of Christ we don't have a nature we should not have a nature that is not uh a dove and lamb nature uh we should have the nature of Christ that he's pleased to be with and pleased to dwell with amen and one of the things that we find that the image is so tarnished now you'd you'd probably brother Branham says in one place he says it's hard to see a real lady anymore it says in back in paragraph 49 he says that when you see a woman acting like a man she's got out of her place you see in the beginning all right she's supposed to think it's a shame for a woman has it's a shame that woman has lost her dainty feminist place it's a disgrace I tell you it looks like you know I'm talking about you women here but of course it hurts it just does but look let me ask you something it used to be that a woman was so feminist tell a man would go foreign would go talking to them and they would blush you know I I'm not worried about women so much right there well one of the ways the Lord first showed himself to me was the way he seen my life before I was so impure and I wonder sometimes if we've lost our blush when he comes our way does his voice still mean everything to us church he loves us so much I hear the word come to us and speak and Minister life and only the way he can and it's Love Letters to us he's telling us constantly you're my bride You're My Chosen One You're Mine do we get desensitized to it does he still mean something to us do it oh that's him he's speaking to my heart does it cause a blush in us anymore say Lord I I want to have the right nature father I still want to be wooed by you father if when you I want to be sensitive I I want to know your will before you speak it I want to be moving I want to do the things that you want me to do before you even ask I want to do more for you father there's got to be a cry in the bride of Christ to be pleasing to him these things are it's a type it's just an unfolding if you can't you know I know that seems like sisters get a hard time but that's the men brother Brandon says that you know the the uh the wife's not gonna have to answer for her husband she's not going to have to you know this is the man you gave me but you know it and but the husband answers for the wife he doesn't you know the in our high our hiding place our resting places in Christ and if you've chosen headship outside of him if you really think you're your own person and you're going to go be your own thing you're just not going to be there and as the bride of Christ there's a nature that's supposed to be reflected it has to be bone of his bone it has to be Spirit of his spirit and you want to know who that is when Christ go look at who Jesus Christ was it was when the prostitute came go thy way sin no more thy sins be forgiven me there's a nature that we have to live out and declare as the bride of Christ because we're the same we're not different you're if you're the bride of Christ you're you're a part of them amen it's not a different uh a different this is a in the pergamian church age he says and when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is God they are all one one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God that is how it was with the prophets you can't separate the spirit and the word they are one you can't separate Eve from Adam when she was in them in the beginning it wouldn't have been Adam if Eve wasn't there it won't be Christ without the bride sorry because that's who the church was taken from his side we're built into it the contract we're we're secure in Christ Jesus what do I want to know I want to know the riches of the glory I have in Christ I want to know the fullness of his stature why that's who I am that's me I miss Jesus Christ I miss Grace you know the Capstone Grace Grace that's me the the love representation amen and this is all expressing out from the very beginning it was an image right God became expressing the very person of Jesus Christ Jesus was the was the expressed image of God again John 1 4 and now the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us amen Hallelujah I have no idea how long the time has been but we're just gonna hopefully get to a stopping place here the hope that we have is not that we're gonna uh keep this sinful body but that this corruptable will put on incorruption right that we have a tabernacle waiting for us that if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting for us that's Corinthians 5 1. if the body be dissolved the Earthly Tabernacle we have another one see we have bypass that comes straight from God that attribute to flesh to be tempted and tested by sin now now it's starting to make sense why if I had a perfect representation in Christ and I was completing him and I'm now dancing before the Lord with job I mean couldn't I just stay there that'd been great but there was something to be have dominion over what was it he saw the land there's no man to till the ground here's the Earth beautiful I perfect representation like the Earth was perfect but it was still lacking something it didn't have someone to have dominion over it so now you've been given a place to have dominion you're put back on the same place where it's you have dominion over this flesh you've been given the spirit and the power as a Son of God to have complete dominion over this flesh it's your enemy it's the Giant in your land it doesn't matter how big you want to know where it wakes up with you in the morning the first thing you need to have dominion over is this flesh it's sin nature we have the a perfect understanding that that is not Who We Are I don't have to accept this flesh and the uh that I somehow read over it but brother Branham talks about how the uh amen if I could find it it's just it's a beautiful yes it's in paragraph 92 he says all right now that's the connection when God makes up his mind to do anything it has to be Satan spoiled this picture by sexual desire by a woman to bringeth forth children he spoiled it so go ahead and make it that's right this habitation is to pick up these cause the only thing that you can do in this life is pick up your form and image what you are if you're redheaded now you'll be redheaded then if you're black-headed now you'll be blockheaded then now that catch this see what you was at your best and if Satan interrupted the picture [Music] he's interrupted the picture there's that you have to understand there's things because of sins fall that he's interrupted the picture you didn't even get and he stops what God intended you to be you'll be amen I'm so thankful for that oh glorious there's your man Saints it means so much to me there's things that you this this life I've been things in in Ukraine I've seen one of the I think it might be called elephantitis or something like that you've heard of the Hunchback of Notre Dame I've seen somebody was grossly disfigured you can't tell me that was as Heavenly the body his representation what happened Satan disrupted the picture what have we been given a foretaste of you know why there's healing you want you want to know why because it's testifying on Earth as it is in heaven Hallelujah and why do we want it to why do I want it to be declared why do I want to see healing why do I because I want the faith it's temporal temporal blessing but what is it declaring I've got an image I've got a body I've got a home what Am I Longing For am I a pilgrim and stranger or am I at home in this thing is anybody at home in this thing I mean it did you just find are you that you want to take so many pictures of it because it's perfect you just arrived I'm sorry I didn't mean to go there honestly I didn't hope that it offend nobody I didn't mean that but we don't want to glorify this flesh we want to make sure that we're pointing to something that's Builder and maker is God you know I'm I'm discouraged by this thing guys I get up in the morning I don't like it I don't like what it's capable of I don't like the thoughts that can be put in its head I really hope that someone's saying no that's not me it's not me it's that's that guy's dead he hung at Calvary I'm dead with Christ you you tell me every morning it's still alive and I'm telling you no I'm hid away in Christ that's not me that's not my representation I don't have to bear that guilt I don't have to bear that shame I don't even have it's sorry I don't know who you're talking about I mean you haven't you know what they say they got these guys they're really good at you know that you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law sometimes we should just shut up keep your mouth shut he'll fight your battle just keep your mouth shut I mean the devil's got to get scared when you're sitting there just going yeah just let the joy of the Lord be your strength the battle's the Lord's stand on his word you know let's let's face it we got an enemy he tries to make himself so great and he's conquered he doesn't even have arrows in his quiver he's a bluff death where's your sting you know the the thing that you would think it would be the ultimate climatic proof of your demise death I'll show you and what happened the Stinger of death's been taken out the confidence we have and that's what I'm trying to Fellowship on is is that if this Earthly body be dissolved we have a perfect image of us in Christ Jesus I'm like Lord dissolve it quickly it less of me more of you you know what there's more of him to display in this hour we will take on a body change so that the very likeness that he had of us in the very beginning Hallelujah the image he predestinated us to truly be in not this born in sin image that you put a name on and that's capable of getting sick and going bald right not I haven't lost the one amen I think was reading somewhere but that that's I love that all right how do we come into that image and if this early body Earthly body be dissolved this Tabernacle we have another one so we have bypassed that with straight from God that attribute to be fleshed to be tempted and tested in sin like Adam but when tested of his word is over then we are taken up this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world in pardon in the world there that we skipped to come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we'd have come through that we would had no temptation he's talking about the body we're going to have if we would have just come into that body there would have been no temptation we would have node all things that's the reason Jesus knowed all things because he was word before he was flesh then we become the word flesh becoming word he was the word made flesh and knowed all things how are we going to start to know all things you know what's given to us amen in this day it's given to us that's our inheritance that's who we are here we are formed the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word b-e-b being predestinated since the beginning you see the little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning then you started your journey many of you can remember it you join this church and join that church you try this and tried that nothing satisfied that's right but one day you recognized it right and he goes in and it doesn't hurt to tell the story but he talks about the eagle in the barnyard how it was tied down they hear it it had a birth you have to recognize in use a spiritual nature it's that of an eagle it's that of an overcomer it's that of the of someone who has dominion over sin that is a that's perfect blameless before Christ in love and that's in you now you have a liar and it's mainly you it's this flesh what's testifying to it otherwise and that's that's just because that's sin nature but we've been given dominion over it that's the way it was with the gospel or the word or the power of Jesus Christ when a man has been predestinated to eternal life he hears the true Ring The Scream Of God nothing can keep him from it amen now what's testifying to it there's something else saying the days of Miracles has passed you can't be an overcomer there's you you know that just runs in the family you know you're going to have a temper you know uh you're you're your great-grandfather was this way yeah whatever it is no I have an image a man was made in the image of God the the the things that man can do is amazing that you'll you'll see people are talented gifted artists and and they can just do something that there's an attribute in them to do it you know brother Brown talked about if I was D'Angelo I guess I'd be a D'Angelo I there's a guy some of you may know him in your time is J Earl Tolkien I read his books all right this guy wrote Middle Earth uh Wired Magazine did an article they said he was the first creator of of Middle Earth or or virtual reality that's what they said so this is before computers by the way they said this guy created virtual reality reality and it's pretty astounding here's this man he would sit down and he would write out complete lunar calendars he would create a solar system and then so he can construct time he sat down he wrote out plant species and gave him scientific names he would sit and he would give he would write out family trees and genealogies he would uh he created elves and dwarves trolls and he was a linguist he gave him languages that were truly constructed incredible you know why he could even have the capacity to do that because we know someone who did it was all in God's thinking before he ever started to create and what general Tolkien said he said he would step into the reality and right from there that's why he created it but God in his thinking he knew exactly the time that he would send Jesus Christ he created the the time and the season for it and he came in that in the and there's a fullness of time the uh No One's Gonna have to tell me the time all right but the thought that I maybe could finish on just looking for a place to stop amen this is maybe an encouragement to you because uh we have to have a faith in our calling and in our election and he says this is trying to find a place to start not every man that saith unto the Lord that say unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say unto me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity Jesus does not deny that they did Mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by the way of men but he did deny ever knowing them these weren't backsliders these weren't Wicked ungenerate reprobates these were the seed of Satan our resting place is the seed it's a it's the only this the only difference that's the only hope we've got is that the work he started in US he'll finish it's the seed he put in US and there it is you can't claim that manifestation of the evidence of being Spirit born Spirit-filled no sir I will admit the true manifestation is the evidence of the holy spirit is doing the mighty acts but it's not the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled so yes the Lord moves he moves sovereignly and he does mighty Miracles dead or raised blinded eyes are open that is a general outpouring of the rain it's not the sign of Salvation to the individual being Spirit-filled even though the individual has the abundance of those manifestations the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of Our Lord It's to receive the word of Truth for the day in which you live Jesus never did stress the importance of works he did the word amen he knew that if the people got the word The Works would follow amen Hallelujah praise the Lord that's our inheritance The Works is ours there they're ours to perform why are we not confused why is it important because when we see someone squatting on our land saying their seed and not producing the fruits that in the love affair we have with Christ we're like but that ain't pleasing to him how come they how can they get to call themselves by his name and get to live in the blessings are they really his bride they seem to call themselves Christians and they they get the results don't they are I mean they listen to that music and I I can't do that I can't live the way because you're he doesn't know them you're a part of them walk pleasing to them have the nature that you're supposed to have as the nature of the bride of Christ don't model yourself after the world it's not pleasing to them like our eyesight our spiritual understanding and our eyesight of what's pleasing to God is one that is known in in the intimacy and that should be personal and if it's not a liberty for you to do don't do it if you know it's not pleasing for the Lord in your walk don't do it it may not be the same for me I know some people who don't drink coffee I probably could do with less coffee but you know what I'm not going to tear down their standard and like come up with the doctoral every seed bearing plant you know I'm going to tear down their standard the Lord knows maybe there's a reason you know he they actually could be protecting them from something you know you the last thing you want to do is compare yourselves one to another walk with the the love of Christ shed abroad in your lives with the nature and the spirit of the Bride of Jesus Christ in a way that's pleasing to him that glorifies your heavenly father and let's not lose our blush when he comes it should mean everything to us when he the preeminence he should have you know that which we set aside the church building we it's you know it's a place where the unbelievers should be able to come into our midst right and recognize there's something different you know that one sign for an unbelievers it's it's reverence you know that's we we reverence this as a place that people meet God that's why we the message is different have you ever been to a Baptist Church hi Johnny good to see you that in the sanctuary there's just a different mode what are we trying to give the preeminence to Christ what are we saying if he comes that'll be the difference Lord just one touch from you if one word could be said if your spirit could come then all's well when Jesus comes and he he can pass by your way at any time amen we'd invite the musicians to come it's the Difference Maker Adam would have sat there just a dead body if it life wasn't breathed into his nostrils it's really amazing that's the same thing today you could be there living a life you think you're alive but you're really dead scripture you even would say a woman that lives in sin is dead while she liveth you could go through the scripture you could see it's a principle if you are not born again if you don't have eternal life if the Life of Christ is not in you you have no reality you you're you don't have true life but when he comes he could Quicken that seed that's in you and make all things new try to sing that song I said speak to the speak to the mountain I'm going to need the words to that let's go ahead and stand together [Music] that's not it [Music] it may not be in there [Music] all right do you need that we'll just be unorthodox I'll stand behind the piano and sing it that's my wife I could stand by her I've got a portable microphone too I've never sung this before but this song's just been on my heart it's been a blessing I think it has been sung but we don't believe that songs belong to individuals starting to still this why would I worry when Giants come calling my name foreign [Music] I won't be shaken and I won't be moved foreign [Music] [Music] better stronger greater than you [Music] my enemy scattered cause they know the battle is [Music] will my God stronger the victory [Music] on the third day [Music] well I Won't Be Shaken out [Music] his promises true so I'll speak to the mountain America it's time to do my God is bigger stronger greater than you I want to sing that bridge but I don't know how to jump into amen Saints Giant in our land is really just this False Image it's this thing that tells us every day that we can't attain a full inheritance in Christ and we could speak to that and say no I'm going to declare Christ in his righteousness I'm going to shine forth the glory of my Lord in this day it's been given to me to be an overcomer I'm the very dress wear of God if anybody's going to be pleasing to him it's going to be me Lord I I want to be your representation here on Earth I want to be your bride that that's showing forth a glory that only I can show you're the only one he could be pleasing to him you're the only one it's your voice he wants to hear you don't want to hear the oh you think someone could come to me and even come close when Julia tells me she loves me I'm sorry it's not going to mean anything close to say like no thank you Church you're the bride of Christ he wants to you to be what he intended you to be feed on his word find out what he wants it's the bride knows what he wants done with the word that's our day it's not an indictment you'd know what he wants done with the order you stay still let's know what he wants done with the word let's let's get into his presence let's feed upon his word let's let him have his will in his way brother Cosmo will turn the service over to you and I don't know if we ever got that song in the in there we could try to sing it maybe uh again as a congregational if it's looks like we got it let's try that verse again thank you I know why it's crashing but uh and fix it from here so we'll pass on that amen so sings pleasing pleasing let me be please [Music] Lord if we were unable to deliver it Lord May there be a heartbeat no bride father to be pleasing to understand the image that you want for us Lord to walk in it father [Music] Lord please [Music] [Music] everything that I knew me please [Music] let's sing that one more time tonight amen [Music] friends [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] cannot comprehend how beautiful the body of Jesus Christ is she's Eternal because she's part of him how those quotes and all those things that were right it just really blessed me because it shows how important she is to him it's a marriage it's a love relationship that you can have with him every day every day there's new food every day there's new life and the more you're in that life the more you're in that presence the more you become that presence and then our very word now becomes the word of God because I don't want this man to speak when this man speaks and makes up stuff and all of a sudden comes to this imaginary way of describing things and you're out there talking about stuff that don't even matter but the word of God should be on our lips at all the time because it's a spirit of Prophecy so the more I speak this word the more I become this word because now it's a revelation inside of me and you professing the very thing we believe but it's got to be spoken because it needs to be overcome you have to see the fruits of the very word you're speaking [Music] because he wants to be revealed inside of you it wants to show you that has an effect it could cast out fear okay cast out depression it could cast out outward thinking the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life all those things because nothing matters [Music] other than his life that's who we are we're bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of a spirit that means we have to live the very thing we profess we are Oh What a Beautiful gospel I don't know any other gospel that makes this bride look this beautiful as this message and that's because the the Bride of Jesus Christ came through that word that that spoken word that she's becoming now and she's an expression of it amen amen let's just
