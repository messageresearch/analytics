[15:02] worst weather amen certainly thankfully
[15:04] we could be gathering his presence he
[15:06] may like to invite brother mike this
[15:07] morning for our psalm reading
[15:09] amen god bless you
[15:27] morning you know um
[15:31] one thing that's so encouraging to me
[15:34] about the scriptures is no
[15:36] longer no matter how long ago they were
[15:38] written
[15:39] they're still as relevant today as they
[15:41] were the day they were written
[15:42] amen you know what's even more amazing
[15:46] is as you read the scriptures
[15:49] you know about the events or the
[15:50] circumstances or the people that
[15:52] happened
[15:54] is how nothing has changed
[15:58] you know when we read in psalm 73 which
[16:00] is what we're going to read this morning
[16:03] this is written perhaps 3 000 years ago
[16:08] this could easily be the cry of any
[16:10] believer in 2020.
[16:14] you know and for all of our learning and
[16:16] all of our
[16:17] advancements in technology how cultured
[16:21] we think we are
[16:23] how sophisticated we think we've become
[16:25] how civilized or fashionable
[16:27] we think we've become this is still the
[16:29] same old world
[16:31] with the same old human race that still
[16:34] acts the same way still pursues the same
[16:37] interests
[16:38] still pursues the same frivolous
[16:40] pursuits
[16:42] no matter how well they think they're
[16:44] covering it up
[16:46] nothing has changed in three thousand
[16:48] years it's the way of man
[16:50] in fact man cannot change unless there's
[16:53] a supernatural
[16:54] encounter you know they can try to
[16:58] modernize it they can try to educate
[17:00] their way they can try to cover it up
[17:02] with religion
[17:03] and politics and civilization but
[17:05] they're still
[17:07] the same old corrupt human beings
[17:10] that frankly we've all been since the
[17:12] beginning of time
[17:14] outside of a supernatural intervention
[17:18] you know and as david is you know crying
[17:21] out to the lord
[17:22] in psalm 73 and he looks at how all the
[17:26] world around him behaves and how they're
[17:28] acting
[17:29] you know how they're perc with all their
[17:31] pursuits all their interests all their
[17:33] behaviors
[17:34] all the way that they act how they seem
[17:36] to enjoy themselves the things that they
[17:38] focus on
[17:40] and he you know is expressing his
[17:42] frustration and how they seem to
[17:43] continue to just endure success and to
[17:46] prosper
[17:46] and to grow and to just continue to to
[17:49] carry on
[17:51] and meanwhile he finds himself
[17:53] struggling just to get
[17:55] just to make it through you know he
[17:57] describes how he's barely able to hold
[17:59] it together in verse 2 it says but as
[18:01] for me
[18:02] my feet were almost gone my steps had
[18:05] well nice slipped
[18:07] for i was envious at the foolish when i
[18:10] saw the prosperity
[18:12] of the wicked he says in verse 12 behold
[18:15] these are the ungodly
[18:16] who prosper in the world they increase
[18:19] in riches
[18:21] verily i have cleansed my heart in vain
[18:24] and washed my hands
[18:25] in innocency you know at this moment of
[18:28] weakness
[18:29] you know david is beginning to question
[18:31] am i uh am i a fool
[18:34] for not pursuing the same interests the
[18:36] same pursuits focusing on the same thing
[18:39] that
[18:39] everyone else around me is they seem to
[18:41] be achieving such success and such
[18:44] prosperity
[18:45] while i struggle this is david a man
[18:49] after god's own heart
[18:51] three thousand years ago and this could
[18:53] just as easily be a discouraged believer
[18:55] in 2020.
[18:57] nothing's really changed this book isn't
[18:58] so obsolete after all
[19:01] but then he says in verse 16 when i
[19:04] thought to know this it was too painful
[19:06] for me
[19:08] until i went into the sanctuary of god
[19:13] then understood i their end
[19:17] surely thou didst set them in slippery
[19:19] places thou
[19:20] cast them down into destruction
[19:23] this is also just as true today as it
[19:26] was 3 000 years ago
[19:30] there's there's your answer to get to
[19:33] the sanctuary
[19:34] of god
[19:38] you know david found his answer in the
[19:40] sanctuary not in a temple not in a
[19:42] tabernacle not in a building but being
[19:43] able to find that place
[19:45] where god is and he walked out
[19:49] with a new perspective nothing's changed
[19:52] in three thousand years man is still the
[19:55] same way they always were
[19:57] and that sanctuary is still there for
[19:59] entering into
[20:00] and finding an escape
[20:04] david finally says in verse 25 whom have
[20:06] i in heaven but thee
[20:09] and there is none upon earth that i
[20:11] desire beside thee
[20:14] my flesh and my heart faileth but god is
[20:17] the strength of my heart
[20:19] and my portion forever
[20:22] so i just want to encourage you today
[20:25] nothing has changed
[20:27] you know when you look around and you
[20:28] see those around us that seemingly are
[20:32] you know trying to tell you that you
[20:33] should be as a human being pursuing this
[20:36] this thing or that this should be your
[20:37] priority these should be in
[20:39] your interests these should be your
[20:40] pursuits whether it's to educate or to
[20:42] be successful or to
[20:44] make a name for yourself or put skins on
[20:46] the wall or whatever it is
[20:48] and at the end of the day there's a
[20:50] sanctuary
[20:51] where you can get perspective that
[20:55] that's just a slippery path to
[20:56] destruction
[20:58] so encourage you to spend time in that
[21:00] sanctuary
[21:01] that you can you know learn that these
[21:04] pursuits
[21:05] are are nothing compared to the pursuit
[21:08] of him
[21:10] so you know i'm reminded as we start to
[21:12] read psalm 73 of what it says in hebrews
[21:15] concerning moses
[21:16] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[21:18] riches
[21:19] than the treasures in egypt he had
[21:20] respect and to the recompense of the
[21:22] reward
[21:24] just as true today as it was three
[21:26] thousand years ago let's read psalm 73
[21:28] together
[21:30] it says this truly god is good to israel
[21:34] even to such as are of a clean heart but
[21:37] as for me
[21:38] my feet were almost gone my step said
[21:41] well i slipped
[21:42] for i was envious of the foolish when i
[21:45] saw the prosperity of the wicked
[21:47] for there are no bans in their death but
[21:50] their strength is firm
[21:51] they are not in trouble as other men
[21:54] neither are they plagued like other men
[21:56] therefore pride compasses them about as
[21:59] a chain
[22:00] violence covert them as a garment their
[22:02] eyes stand out with fatness
[22:04] they have more than heart could wish
[22:07] they are corrupt
[22:08] and speak wickedly concerning oppression
[22:11] they speak
[22:11] loftily they set their mouth against the
[22:14] heavens
[22:15] and their tongue walketh through the
[22:16] earth therefore his people return hither
[22:19] and waters of a full cup are rung out to
[22:22] them
[22:23] and they say how does god know and is
[22:26] there knowledge in the most high
[22:28] behold these are the ungodly who prosper
[22:31] in the world
[22:32] they increase in riches verily i have
[22:35] cleansed my heart in vain
[22:36] and washed my hands in innocency for all
[22:39] the day long have i been plagued and
[22:41] chastened
[22:42] every morning if i say i will speak thus
[22:45] behold i should offend against the
[22:47] generation of thy children
[22:49] when i thought to know this it was too
[22:51] painful for me
[22:53] until i went into the sanctuary of god
[22:56] then understood i therein surely thou
[22:59] didst set them in slippery places
[23:01] thou castest them down into destruction
[23:04] how are they brought into desolation
[23:06] as in a moment they are utterly consumed
[23:09] with terrors
[23:10] as a dream when one awakens so o lord
[23:13] when thou awakest
[23:14] thou shalt despise their image thus my
[23:17] heart was grieved
[23:18] and i was pricked in my reigns so
[23:21] foolish was i
[23:22] and ignorant i was as a beast before
[23:24] thee
[23:25] nevertheless i am continually with thee
[23:28] thou hast hold in me by my right hand
[23:30] thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and
[23:33] afterward receive me to glory whom have
[23:36] i
[23:36] in heaven but thee and there is none
[23:39] upon earth that i desire beside thee
[23:42] my flesh and my heart fail it but god is
[23:44] the strength of my heart
[23:46] and my portion forever for lo they that
[23:49] are far from
[23:50] thee shall perish thou has destroyed all
[23:52] them that go a whoring from thee
[23:55] but it is good for me to draw near to
[23:57] god i have put my trust in the lord god
[24:00] that i may declare all thy works
[24:07] amen god bless you and have your seats
[24:10] [Music]

[33:09] uh last sunday i guess pastor's a sermon
[33:13] kind of hit you know he hit a a call in
[33:15] me
[33:16] i have family members who you know
[33:19] questioned the message and at a point in
[33:21] time they walked out of it
[33:22] and i could sit down at that moment and
[33:24] also think okay
[33:26] i have questions too but there is
[33:28] something within me that said
[33:29] there's no way i could go and hear
[33:31] something like this you know i grew up
[33:33] in it but i have my questions
[33:35] and then when i did question it i
[33:36] couldn't go nowhere i was like
[33:39] if i didn't do everything right and if i
[33:41] found myself in hell it wasn't because
[33:43] the message was wrong
[33:44] it was because maybe i just didn't live
[33:46] up to the expectation
[33:48] and every day i prayed to god i said
[33:49] just i just want to leave up to the
[33:51] expectation that's

[51:26] has for us amen before we
[51:29] go to prayer this morning just i'd like
[51:32] to let you know that
[51:34] brother cosman and some of the musicians
[51:36] uh
[51:37] went into a recording studio and picked
[51:41] some of the songs that
[51:43] you've all enjoyed and some of our
[51:45] special singers
[51:47] and they put it on a little cd and it's
[51:50] in the back
[51:51] of the church for for you to take
[51:55] it's just a present to you all and i
[51:59] don't know if our calendars have got
[52:01] here yet but
[52:02] we'll have our calendars for you again
[52:05] this year so you love the lord this
[52:08] morning
[52:09] you know the best thing about it he
[52:11] loves you whether you love him or not
[52:14] and he died for you whether you accept
[52:16] it
[52:17] or not and he cares for you so
[52:20] let's approach him this morning trusting
[52:23] that he'll be our portion
[52:26] our heavenly father we come to you this
[52:28] morning
[52:30] or we're grateful this morning father
[52:33] that
[52:34] we're going to have a baptism on
[52:36] [Music]
[52:38] father that's so wonderful it's what
[52:40] life's about
[52:43] father i pray this morning that your
[52:46] word would
[52:48] come to our hearts this morning
[52:53] and that we would receive from it that
[52:56] which we
[52:57] have need of that from your word father
[53:01] that we would
[53:03] receive the spirit to create the
[53:07] atmosphere that you so desired
[53:10] your church to have we ask you to bless
[53:13] us this morning father may we
[53:16] all realize that we play an important
[53:19] part one with another
[53:22] there's no big eyes or little use
[53:25] there's not one part of the body that
[53:27] says they don't have need of the other
[53:29] part
[53:30] father but the unity of the word and
[53:34] the unity of you and your bride is
[53:38] what your heart so longs for we ask you
[53:41] to be
[53:42] with us this morning as we endeavor to
[53:45] just serve you we ask you to bless us
[53:48] now
[53:48] in jesus name we pray amen
[53:52] amen amen god bless you this morning
[53:56] let's open our bibles and
[54:02] and
[54:05] read a scripture
[54:09] found in hebrews
[54:15] in the first three verses of the first
[54:17] chapter of hebrews
[54:19] and um we want to play a small portion
[54:23] of
[54:24] the message this morning we want to talk
[54:26] a little bit before it
[54:28] and then play it and try to
[54:32] express to you
[54:35] what we're trying to achieve by
[54:40] doing this part and playing this part
[54:43] of the sermon so in hebrews the first
[54:46] chapter
[54:48] and the first three verses
[54:51] it says god
[54:55] who at sun dried times
[54:58] and in diverse manners
[55:02] spake in times past unto the fathers
[55:06] by the prophets cath in these last days
[55:10] spoken unto us
[55:13] by his son whom he hath
[55:17] appointed heir of all things
[55:20] by whom also he made
[55:24] the worlds and being
[55:27] the brightness of his glory
[55:31] and the expressed image of his person
[55:35] and upholding all things by
[55:39] the word of his power when he
[55:42] had by himself purged our sins
[55:46] set down on the right hand of the
[55:49] majesty
[55:50] on high father bless your word to us
[55:53] this morning
[55:54] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[55:58] amen god bless you may be seated
[56:05] you know i think it's very important as
[56:11] christians and i i it's kind of
[56:14] redundant to say this but
[56:17] we should never lose focus
[56:20] that really what everything
[56:24] is about is about the lord jesus
[56:29] and it and the reason that
[56:32] it's all about him
[56:35] is because that was the way that god
[56:38] chose
[56:39] to express himself so in the beginning
[56:43] was god in the beginning
[56:46] god everything started with our great
[56:50] father
[56:51] which is in heaven and it was by
[56:54] his will and his
[56:57] choosing that he chose
[57:01] for things to unfold the way that they
[57:04] unfold
[57:06] he's in control we don't think a lot of
[57:10] times he's in control
[57:12] we don't realize a lot of things that
[57:14] everything's right on time
[57:17] that everything's been planned that we
[57:20] know
[57:20] he has a permissive will that he will
[57:23] allow
[57:25] he'll allow man to go down his own road
[57:28] he'll allow man to make his own choices
[57:32] but all the time he has a plan to return
[57:35] you back to his perfect will
[57:39] and many times it's just because
[57:41] everything collapses around us
[57:43] other times he just gently makes
[57:47] little moves in our life and just kind
[57:49] of
[57:50] does this and does that and we don't
[57:52] even know it and
[57:54] we're back to where that he would have
[57:56] us to be
[57:57] because he's a good shepherd and the
[58:00] shepherd knows his sheep and he knows
[58:02] his sheep by name
[58:04] and it goes out before them and he
[58:06] leadeth them to
[58:08] still waters he leadeth them to green
[58:10] pastures
[58:11] it is so as difficult
[58:14] as things seem and and
[58:18] it seems in a way that it's hard for us
[58:21] to
[58:22] find our course a lot of times in these
[58:24] times
[58:25] but we always want to remember that it's
[58:28] always
[58:30] been based on what the intentions
[58:33] of the father was and god had
[58:37] intentions i'd like to read this uh
[58:41] statement from the church age book and
[58:44] kind of
[58:45] could just move towards what it is that
[58:48] i want us to become conscious of this
[58:51] morning
[58:52] and i think if we can become conscious
[58:54] of this
[58:55] it takes a lot of burden off of us
[58:58] and i think it's important for a
[59:00] christian to be burden-free
[59:03] because the world is is just
[59:06] uh they're so tall and
[59:09] and and just uh so
[59:12] unsure of themselves and there's one
[59:15] thing that we
[59:16] should be anchored in and secure
[59:20] about is that we have been purchased
[59:23] with a price
[59:25] we our names were written in the lamb's
[59:27] book of life
[59:28] before the foundation of the world that
[59:31] we are secure
[59:32] in him and and we are we're secure
[59:36] in him because of his ability to keep us
[59:41] his ability to transform us
[59:44] his ability to intervene in our lives
[59:49] and and like i've always had this
[59:52] definition
[59:53] of grace because we know that we live by
[59:56] grace
[59:57] and to me grace is a decision
[1:00:01] that was made from the throne of god
[1:00:04] a decision grace isn't just by
[1:00:07] happenstance
[1:00:08] grace isn't something that you stumble
[1:00:11] in on
[1:00:12] grace is a decision made by god
[1:00:16] to intervene in your life
[1:00:19] and change the inevitable
[1:00:22] result of your choice or actions so like
[1:00:28] you're on your way
[1:00:30] for destruction because of the choice
[1:00:32] you've made
[1:00:33] grace sits back on the throne and says
[1:00:37] this guy's gonna wreck but i'm gonna
[1:00:40] intervene and change the outcome
[1:00:44] and you know what happens you get a blow
[1:00:47] out
[1:00:48] it keeps you from an accident we get out
[1:00:50] of the car all upset about the blowout
[1:00:53] and we don't even realize it could have
[1:00:55] been the grace of god
[1:00:57] amen i think he goes so unrecognized
[1:01:01] in our lives and and his real
[1:01:04] presence that he has with his children
[1:01:08] and the real way he watches over him and
[1:01:11] the real way he cares for him
[1:01:14] he goes so unnoticed but that undying
[1:01:17] love
[1:01:18] he doesn't even need recognition because
[1:01:21] that's the
[1:01:22] essence of what he is is that love
[1:01:25] and i know that that's what our desire
[1:01:28] to enter into
[1:01:29] is that capstone the thing that caps off
[1:01:32] the church
[1:01:33] the the final crowning
[1:01:36] of his achievement on earth that's what
[1:01:39] a
[1:01:40] capstone is it's the final crowning it's
[1:01:42] the
[1:01:43] final achievement it's the final
[1:01:46] thing that marks and puts the mark
[1:01:49] on the work of the of the building and
[1:01:53] of the church is when he
[1:01:55] taps it off and and we know that the has
[1:01:58] to have the right cornerstone
[1:02:00] but the same that was the cornerstone
[1:02:02] becomes
[1:02:03] the capstone it was the love of god that
[1:02:07] sent his son to the earth to redeem his
[1:02:10] children back
[1:02:11] he could have made a whole brand new
[1:02:13] batch better than this batch
[1:02:18] but he chose to love us he chose to
[1:02:21] forgive
[1:02:21] us he chose to pray pay the price for us
[1:02:25] and he so loved the world he gave his
[1:02:27] only begotten son
[1:02:28] that's the foundation that we're built
[1:02:31] on
[1:02:32] is the love of god that god so loved the
[1:02:35] world
[1:02:36] and no other foundation can a man lay
[1:02:39] than that which is laid
[1:02:40] which is christ jesus that's what we're
[1:02:42] built on
[1:02:43] we're built on the lord we're built on
[1:02:46] what that he
[1:02:47] is that he as hebrews said that he was
[1:02:50] the brightness and the glory of god
[1:02:53] that's that he was the expressed image
[1:02:56] of god
[1:02:57] that's what we're built on we're built
[1:03:00] on the express
[1:03:01] image of god and his will
[1:03:05] for his church is that the church be
[1:03:08] capped off with that that finally that
[1:03:11] what was in the foundation is now
[1:03:15] expressed in the capstone
[1:03:18] so both expressions become one
[1:03:21] and it's back to husband and wife that
[1:03:24] same
[1:03:25] love joined together in unity
[1:03:28] it it becomes something that uh is
[1:03:32] is so beautifully uh
[1:03:35] uh orchestrated and and what he wanted
[1:03:38] to achieve and that's what he's trying
[1:03:40] to achieve
[1:03:42] is is to have a a church
[1:03:45] that's like him
[1:03:48] that's like him not a bunch of
[1:03:52] know-it-alls
[1:03:53] but the church that's like him that
[1:03:56] that he can express himself through for
[1:03:59] the last expression
[1:04:01] of god to the world
[1:04:04] is his word living in
[1:04:08] a redeemed people
[1:04:12] not just left in a book to be
[1:04:16] read and for a man to make his own
[1:04:19] choices
[1:04:21] because we know that this killeth but
[1:04:24] this with the spirit of god is life and
[1:04:27] truth
[1:04:28] and and and to see that union
[1:04:32] and that expression that that the world
[1:04:35] can look
[1:04:36] and see because there's so many voices
[1:04:38] now
[1:04:39] but you are a shining light
[1:04:42] you are the salt of the earth you are
[1:04:45] the living beings that are making
[1:04:48] contact with the world around you
[1:04:52] and there's nobody can take your place
[1:04:55] the prophet of god expressed it one time
[1:04:58] he said it's like looking out over a
[1:04:59] great
[1:05:00] vast dark plane if you could just
[1:05:03] picture a great blanket of darkness out
[1:05:06] there and then little specks of light
[1:05:09] sitting all on that like looking at us
[1:05:12] black
[1:05:13] sky at night and you see these little
[1:05:15] stars up there
[1:05:17] and that's the christian life that's the
[1:05:20] spirit-filled believer
[1:05:22] shining light in in the world that's
[1:05:26] around them
[1:05:26] you are more important out in your life
[1:05:30] if i express it this way in the world
[1:05:34] than you are in this building this
[1:05:36] morning
[1:05:38] i hope that's not misunderstood
[1:05:43] but the the value of your
[1:05:46] purpose the value of your creation
[1:05:50] the the plan of god was to transfer
[1:05:54] his life in you so you could transfer
[1:05:58] that life to others that was his plan
[1:06:01] from the beginning he transferred his
[1:06:04] life
[1:06:04] into christ that christ could transfer
[1:06:08] his life into us and so that's what
[1:06:12] that's what we've got to get become more
[1:06:15] conscious of that's that we've gotta
[1:06:18] kind of let the reality of that
[1:06:21] set in that that we have a mission
[1:06:26] if an another word for a mission is a
[1:06:29] commission
[1:06:30] we have a commission to go into all the
[1:06:34] world
[1:06:34] and preach the gospel that doesn't mean
[1:06:37] be a preacher
[1:06:39] you understand that means to to by your
[1:06:42] life
[1:06:42] to to bring bring present and make
[1:06:46] known the life of christ that that's
[1:06:49] what we're supposed to do the world is
[1:06:51] make
[1:06:51] known the life of christ not what we
[1:06:54] believe
[1:06:56] but what possesses us that we are
[1:07:00] purchased with a price we are possessed
[1:07:03] by a spirit i like what brother mike
[1:07:06] said
[1:07:06] in his exhortation this morning is all
[1:07:09] of us are the same
[1:07:12] without divine intervention there would
[1:07:15] be no
[1:07:15] change in us amen we're born in sin
[1:07:19] we're shaped in
[1:07:20] iniquity we come into the world speaking
[1:07:22] lies
[1:07:23] if there's not an outside intervention
[1:07:26] to change our nature well what
[1:07:29] changes our nature it takes another
[1:07:32] nature
[1:07:33] to change in nature so the only way for
[1:07:36] our nature to be changed is for another
[1:07:38] nature to come in now that can be us
[1:07:42] evil spirit but if it's the nature of
[1:07:46] christ that's changed and the nature of
[1:07:49] christ that's come in
[1:07:50] us then we'd be christ light and that's
[1:07:54] something that we've got to continue to
[1:07:56] achieve
[1:07:57] and bring our flesh under subjection and
[1:08:00] so
[1:08:01] as we read this it says
[1:08:04] this is in the church age book and it's
[1:08:07] in the
[1:08:09] i believe it's the uh uh
[1:08:14] uh the i think it's the
[1:08:18] thigh tyra church age and uh
[1:08:22] so uh let me just make sure that that's
[1:08:27] where it is so yeah okay yeah uh
[1:08:31] yeah i know maybe it's the summoning
[1:08:34] church age let me just check i can find
[1:08:36] it here i didn't
[1:08:38] mark the church age that it was in uh
[1:08:43] down well maybe that's not important
[1:08:44] yeah well
[1:08:46] this this statement yes i think it's
[1:08:49] that
[1:08:49] church age so it says now
[1:08:52] we can see his association with the word
[1:08:56] he is the word
[1:09:00] yeah it just get when you you understand
[1:09:04] what he said here in
[1:09:07] hebrews at when when we read it in
[1:09:10] hebrews
[1:09:11] he says he who being the brightness
[1:09:15] this is hebrews 1 and 3. i don't know if
[1:09:18] you can put it up or not
[1:09:20] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:09:24] and the expressed image of his
[1:09:27] person so jesus was the expressed
[1:09:33] image of his person or if we could say
[1:09:36] it this way
[1:09:37] jesus had the personality of god
[1:09:42] that's what jesus had he had the
[1:09:44] personality of god
[1:09:46] but he learned obedience by the things
[1:09:50] he suffered
[1:09:51] so in other words he was tempted in
[1:09:54] every manner
[1:09:55] wherein we are tempted but yet
[1:09:59] that there was no sin
[1:10:03] found in him so he overcame
[1:10:07] and that's what he said i will give you
[1:10:09] grace
[1:10:10] i will i will send my spirit
[1:10:13] that you can overcome as i have overcame
[1:10:17] so he wants to transform transfer
[1:10:21] to us the power
[1:10:25] by which he overcame and
[1:10:28] our vain selves that we are we keep
[1:10:31] trying to overcome ourselves
[1:10:35] we get all bowed up and we get all
[1:10:37] headstrong and we're gonna
[1:10:39] overcome this and we're gonna get this
[1:10:41] victory and i'm gonna win this time
[1:10:44] and you finally are going to come to the
[1:10:46] place where you're just going to have to
[1:10:48] fall down
[1:10:49] and say i can not do it without you
[1:10:54] help me i want to be better i want to
[1:10:58] have a better spirit i want to win the
[1:11:00] victory
[1:11:01] so we see that he's the expressed image
[1:11:04] of the person and upholds
[1:11:08] all things by his word
[1:11:12] of his power so everything's done
[1:11:15] by his word and we can see his
[1:11:18] association with the word
[1:11:21] the word that is who he is the word
[1:11:25] in his name john 1 1
[1:11:29] where it says in the beginning was the
[1:11:31] word
[1:11:34] the root form which we have
[1:11:37] our translation for word is logos
[1:11:42] which means the thought
[1:11:46] or concept that's on page 162
[1:11:50] of the regular church age book
[1:11:56] which means the thought or concept
[1:11:59] it has a double meaning of thought and
[1:12:02] speech
[1:12:03] now a thought expressed is a word or
[1:12:08] words isn't that
[1:12:11] wonderful and beautiful
[1:12:15] john says the concept of
[1:12:18] god was expressed
[1:12:21] in jesus think of that
[1:12:24] the concept of god was expressed
[1:12:29] in jesus in other words god had a
[1:12:32] concept
[1:12:33] i used to like to go to car shows until
[1:12:36] they got so expensive they
[1:12:37] we're not going to buy one but i like to
[1:12:40] look at the concept
[1:12:42] cars and that's what someone has in
[1:12:46] their mind
[1:12:46] what might be a car of the future
[1:12:50] or or what they what was expressed well
[1:12:53] what god had in his mind
[1:12:57] was expressed in the lord jesus
[1:13:00] so what and that was the word
[1:13:03] so that was what his
[1:13:06] what jesus was he was the concept of god
[1:13:10] expressed he was what god had in his
[1:13:13] mind
[1:13:13] what was expressed now remember all this
[1:13:17] time that god had
[1:13:18] a thought of what he wanted you to
[1:13:20] express
[1:13:23] the part that he wanted you to play
[1:13:26] in all that and so this is on page 108
[1:13:31] in the this church age book it says
[1:13:34] god's
[1:13:35] intention for his create
[1:13:38] for his creation man
[1:13:42] is to express his words
[1:13:47] so that was his intention for his
[1:13:50] creation
[1:13:52] was to express his words
[1:13:55] now that's why
[1:13:58] it's so beautiful when it was shared
[1:14:01] with us
[1:14:02] that he said to us god's will
[1:14:06] is his word we wonder what god want me
[1:14:09] to do what's his will
[1:14:11] for my life his will is his word
[1:14:14] and and what god's uh
[1:14:18] uh intention was his
[1:14:21] his intention for his creation
[1:14:24] man is to express his words
[1:14:28] or to express his thought or to be a
[1:14:31] continuation
[1:14:32] of himself because that's what he wanted
[1:14:35] he wanted to have fellowship he wanted
[1:14:37] to see himself
[1:14:39] duplicated he wanted to he wanted to see
[1:14:43] people that were expressing his words
[1:14:46] expressing his thoughts
[1:14:48] if it being an expression of himself
[1:14:52] that he could sit down and say my
[1:14:54] children they live
[1:14:56] after me not only do they live after me
[1:14:59] but they live by me
[1:15:01] they're my offspring they're they're my
[1:15:04] creation how can we say that we're his
[1:15:07] creation
[1:15:08] and then be something that's totally
[1:15:10] opposite
[1:15:11] of anything that he is
[1:15:16] you know i mean we're a result of the
[1:15:19] creation
[1:15:20] process that he placed in in
[1:15:24] in the carnal being of being able to
[1:15:27] create
[1:15:28] children and have living souls
[1:15:31] but his own are like him
[1:15:35] that's why he said you know that you are
[1:15:37] my disciples
[1:15:38] by your love one for another he never
[1:15:42] identified the church by their doctrinal
[1:15:45] argument
[1:15:49] but their identification was the same
[1:15:52] love that he had in him was in them
[1:15:56] and then that expression paul said what
[1:15:59] good does it do me if i
[1:16:00] have all these gifts and all these
[1:16:03] things and i
[1:16:04] and i can do all these things and i
[1:16:06] don't have love uh
[1:16:07] from within my heart it becomes
[1:16:10] profitless
[1:16:13] and we're not going to profit anything
[1:16:16] in this world
[1:16:17] we're not going to move forward we can
[1:16:19] grow in doctrine
[1:16:21] we can grow and intellect we can grow in
[1:16:24] understanding of the mysteries in those
[1:16:27] things
[1:16:27] but it's not going to profit anything
[1:16:31] until the love of god is shed abroad in
[1:16:34] our heart by the holy spirit
[1:16:37] it's got to come down to that
[1:16:40] he says god's intention for his
[1:16:43] creation man is to express
[1:16:46] his words in genesis
[1:16:50] adam was given the word
[1:16:54] to live by a
[1:16:58] life lived by the word
[1:17:02] would be the word expressed
[1:17:09] and that's the foundation this morning
[1:17:13] for the message that
[1:17:16] i would like to
[1:17:19] place before us this morning
[1:17:22] and that is
[1:17:25] the great need
[1:17:30] for discernment
[1:17:33] in the church
[1:17:36] and a real understanding
[1:17:40] of what discernment is
[1:17:44] if you don't have a a clear
[1:17:47] understanding
[1:17:49] of your purpose if you don't have a
[1:17:52] clear understanding of what
[1:17:54] god why god created you and why he
[1:17:57] called you
[1:17:59] and why he elected you if you if you
[1:18:02] can't settle that clear
[1:18:04] vision in your mind and in your heart
[1:18:07] that you understand what you're about
[1:18:10] when you wake up in the morning
[1:18:12] and what lies before you in your day
[1:18:16] and what it is that you're supposed to
[1:18:18] accomplish for that day
[1:18:20] at the end and if you don't have that
[1:18:22] vision
[1:18:23] that i'm going to walk out my door this
[1:18:26] morning
[1:18:27] and i'm going to show that christ jesus
[1:18:29] lives
[1:18:30] and he's not up there he's not
[1:18:35] hid in here but this
[1:18:38] is revealed in me a life
[1:18:41] lived by the word is an expression
[1:18:45] of the word and that was god's
[1:18:48] intention for man was to live by that
[1:18:52] word
[1:18:52] if we fail to see that you you might get
[1:18:56] up and think i've got to work today
[1:18:58] because
[1:18:59] i've got a bill to pay and i've got my
[1:19:02] house payment
[1:19:03] due and echo and i and i might get fired
[1:19:06] and you carry
[1:19:08] all that load out the door you know but
[1:19:11] if you could walk out that door
[1:19:13] and say you know i've never seen a
[1:19:15] righteous man big bread
[1:19:17] today i'm going out into the world to
[1:19:19] let my light shine
[1:19:21] and he's the one that'll take care of me
[1:19:23] he's the one that got me this job
[1:19:26] if i lose this job i got another job
[1:19:28] waiting for me
[1:19:30] he's the one that runs my life the
[1:19:32] footsteps of the righteous are led by
[1:19:34] the lord
[1:19:35] if i put him first he'll take care of
[1:19:38] the rest
[1:19:42] now that's what we can walk out the door
[1:19:45] with
[1:19:47] we don't forget that
[1:19:50] now we're going to be settled in our
[1:19:52] heart
[1:19:54] i'm not going to let anything that comes
[1:19:56] my way
[1:19:57] change my vision or
[1:20:01] change my mission
[1:20:04] and that's satan's job is to throw a
[1:20:07] snare
[1:20:07] before us to catch us off guard to make
[1:20:11] us react
[1:20:12] a certain way he's always battling us
[1:20:14] and working against
[1:20:16] us it's just because that's what he
[1:20:18] wants to do he wants to make the word of
[1:20:20] god
[1:20:21] which is you of none effect
[1:20:25] that's why a root of bitterness defiles
[1:20:28] many
[1:20:29] so we could keep that vision if we could
[1:20:32] keep that so
[1:20:33] straight in front of us if we could
[1:20:35] understand
[1:20:37] that we have a purpose we have something
[1:20:40] that god intended
[1:20:41] to live by to express jesus christ to
[1:20:44] express the love of god
[1:20:46] in the world and if we have that vision
[1:20:51] and we have that understanding of the
[1:20:54] purpose of our life
[1:20:56] now we have the foundation for
[1:21:00] discernment
[1:21:04] and discernment is a very important part
[1:21:08] of christianity not the kind of
[1:21:11] discernment
[1:21:12] that the prophet of god had
[1:21:16] that that that we mixed what regular
[1:21:20] discernment
[1:21:21] is the regular discernment is to tell
[1:21:25] the the motive and the objective and the
[1:21:28] purpose
[1:21:29] and and the result of something it takes
[1:21:32] discernment to understand you stick your
[1:21:35] finger in the fire
[1:21:36] you get burned you can learn
[1:21:40] discernment when you see the same things
[1:21:44] come up or
[1:21:45] someone comes up and and and it's like
[1:21:48] it's like my my good friend danny fair
[1:21:50] he was that he was out at the truck stop
[1:21:53] and the
[1:21:53] guy came up to him and said you know i'd
[1:21:56] like to
[1:21:57] go to such-and-such place and and you
[1:22:00] could if you could buy me a ticket and
[1:22:02] all this stuff and he gave
[1:22:03] his spiel to danny and all of a sudden
[1:22:06] it dawned on danny i heard this before
[1:22:11] and then he looked at the guy a little
[1:22:12] closer and the guy had grown a beer
[1:22:14] he said hey how did you get back from
[1:22:17] the last time i bought you
[1:22:20] a ticket and the guy walked away
[1:22:25] me and leslie got called up to come to
[1:22:27] church and help somebody so
[1:22:29] we got in the car and we came over here
[1:22:31] a lady in the parking lot and
[1:22:33] she was asking money and we walked up
[1:22:36] and toured me looked down at her and
[1:22:38] we'd already helped this lady
[1:22:42] unless he said we helped you last time
[1:22:44] she said oh
[1:22:45] i'm sorry wrong church
[1:22:51] after a while you understand you learn
[1:22:54] to discern
[1:22:56] and discernment i want you to understand
[1:22:58] discernment's a very important part
[1:23:00] of you being able to carry out your
[1:23:03] mission
[1:23:05] okay i hope that we can do this so
[1:23:08] in hebrews put up hebrews
[1:23:12] um i i believe it's hebrews 5
[1:23:16] and 14.
[1:23:29] let's just start with the 11th verse
[1:23:34] and i i make some of these statements
[1:23:36] because
[1:23:37] of the claims that we many times make
[1:23:41] about
[1:23:41] ourselves as being so
[1:23:45] us steeped in the mysteries of
[1:23:48] god and so learned in the things
[1:23:51] of the word of god and it says here it
[1:23:54] says
[1:23:55] of whom we have many things to say
[1:24:00] and hard to be uttered seeing
[1:24:03] ye are dull of hearing
[1:24:07] for when for the time ye
[1:24:10] ought to be teachers
[1:24:14] ye have need that one teacheth you
[1:24:17] again which be the first
[1:24:20] principles of the oracles of god
[1:24:27] which become the first principles
[1:24:31] of the oracles of god
[1:24:34] can you imagine when the church loses
[1:24:39] the very first principles
[1:24:42] of being one that speaks
[1:24:45] for god
[1:24:49] okay this is important because my
[1:24:52] heart's desire for
[1:24:53] us as the church is that we move forward
[1:24:56] in the things of god that the power of
[1:25:00] the lord can move
[1:25:01] in our midst that things are done
[1:25:04] decently in order
[1:25:06] that the love of god is shed abroad in
[1:25:09] our heart
[1:25:10] by the spirit and that god has the
[1:25:12] preeminence
[1:25:14] and he's pleased with us now i know he's
[1:25:17] not always
[1:25:19] pleased with me and i know that and i've
[1:25:21] got to work on that
[1:25:23] but he said being the first principles
[1:25:27] of the oracles of god
[1:25:29] and are become such as having need of
[1:25:32] milk
[1:25:34] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[1:25:37] uses
[1:25:38] milk is unskilled
[1:25:41] in the word of righteousness
[1:25:44] for he is obeyed but strong meat
[1:25:48] belongeth to them
[1:25:50] which are full of age even those
[1:25:53] who by reason of use
[1:25:56] have their senses exercised
[1:26:00] to discern both good
[1:26:03] and evil very important let's turn over
[1:26:08] to
[1:26:09] corinthians first corinthians the second
[1:26:13] chapter
[1:26:20] starting in the ninth verse
[1:26:25] and we'll read finish that chapter
[1:26:29] and then we'll move into our our lesson
[1:26:31] and be
[1:26:33] done here in in about 35 minutes
[1:26:40] hebrews this i mean excuse me first
[1:26:43] corinthians
[1:26:45] the second chapter and the ninth verse
[1:26:50] but as it is written i have not
[1:26:53] seen nor ear heard
[1:26:57] neither have it entered into the hearts
[1:27:01] of men
[1:27:02] the things which god hath prepared for
[1:27:05] them that love him
[1:27:07] oh my think of that
[1:27:11] the reward that's given just like
[1:27:14] our our our young candidate for
[1:27:18] baptism today she's making a choice
[1:27:22] for i'm going to serve god i know it's
[1:27:24] right
[1:27:26] again and she says the first step is
[1:27:28] repent
[1:27:29] and be baptized then i'm trusting that
[1:27:32] god will place his spirit in my life
[1:27:35] and help me lead and live a good life
[1:27:39] oh i wish i could express to her the
[1:27:42] reward
[1:27:43] that she's going to receive for that
[1:27:47] but we it hasn't been entered into our
[1:27:49] hearts what god's got
[1:27:51] it's so great it's so beyond any senses
[1:27:55] or reality that we have
[1:27:57] that for those that choose just think
[1:28:00] the first gift of god
[1:28:02] is eternal life
[1:28:07] then living that life for eternity in
[1:28:10] the most sublime
[1:28:12] thing that you could ever imagine you
[1:28:15] can't imagine
[1:28:16] you don't even have the ability to
[1:28:18] imagine what god's got prepared
[1:28:21] for you but god hath
[1:28:24] revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:28:28] for the spirit searcheth all things
[1:28:32] yea the deep things of god
[1:28:40] for what man knoweth the things of man
[1:28:44] save the spirit of man
[1:28:47] which is in him
[1:28:51] even so the things of god
[1:28:54] knoweth no man but the spirit
[1:28:58] of god now we have received
[1:29:02] not the spirit of the world
[1:29:06] but the spirit which is of god
[1:29:10] that we might know the things
[1:29:13] that are freely given to us of god
[1:29:17] so he gave us his spirit so we could
[1:29:20] know the things of god you can't know
[1:29:22] him in a carnal mind
[1:29:26] i believe the statement was made you
[1:29:28] can't even know god without the baptism
[1:29:30] of the holy spirit
[1:29:34] so that's why if you seek anything in
[1:29:36] your life
[1:29:39] ask god for his spirit lord
[1:29:42] i need more of your spirit
[1:29:46] ask him for spiritual discernment
[1:29:50] to discern and this is what we're
[1:29:52] talking about this morning
[1:29:54] the need for discernment
[1:29:59] so we might know the things that are
[1:30:01] freely given to us of god
[1:30:03] which things also we speak
[1:30:07] not in the words which man whisman
[1:30:11] teacheth not in the words
[1:30:14] which man's wisdom teacheth
[1:30:18] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[1:30:21] comparing spiritual things with
[1:30:24] spiritual
[1:30:27] it's a losing battle to try to mix
[1:30:30] spirit and carnality there are two
[1:30:33] different
[1:30:34] realms there are two different worlds
[1:30:36] they don't care you can't even
[1:30:38] know the things of god with the carnal
[1:30:40] mind the carnal mind of his enmity with
[1:30:43] god
[1:30:43] but the spiritual mind is life to
[1:30:47] think like god
[1:30:53] that's a challenge
[1:30:58] now as we
[1:31:02] but the natural man receiveth
[1:31:05] not the things of the spirit of god
[1:31:10] for they are foolish under him neither
[1:31:13] can he know them because they are
[1:31:16] spiritually discerned
[1:31:20] we're talking about the need for
[1:31:23] discernment
[1:31:26] but he that is spiritual judgeth
[1:31:30] all things yet he himself
[1:31:33] is judged of no man
[1:31:36] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[1:31:40] that he may instruct him but we
[1:31:43] have the mind of christ
[1:31:48] so if we have his spirit we have his
[1:31:51] mind
[1:31:52] now i want to play as we close and then
[1:31:55] right after this tape
[1:31:57] we will go into the baptism
[1:32:02] i want to play what time is it now
[1:32:07] anybody have a time it says one o'clock
[1:32:09] 11 25 good this
[1:32:11] we we should be be baptizing by noon
[1:32:15] by the grace of god i want to play
[1:32:18] 30 minutes of discernment
[1:32:21] discerning of spirits but
[1:32:24] in this i want you to
[1:32:28] feel what it is that
[1:32:32] brother abraham is saying true
[1:32:34] discernment is
[1:32:36] true discernment is when a man looks at
[1:32:39] the situations
[1:32:41] he looks at the things around them and
[1:32:44] he discerns them
[1:32:46] in relationship to what
[1:32:49] his vision is
[1:32:54] in other words if something is going to
[1:32:56] take me away
[1:32:58] from what it is that i'm called to do i
[1:33:01] need to discern that
[1:33:05] all things are profitable but all things
[1:33:08] aren't
[1:33:09] edifying so
[1:33:12] and as he expresses this
[1:33:16] he's an express an attitude
[1:33:19] and a life and the thought
[1:33:22] process that the mind of christ has
[1:33:26] and how that one with the mind of christ
[1:33:29] looks at the world discerns the world
[1:33:33] and treats those that are around him

[1:34:32] is about

[1:36:50] the words which he commanded to a
[1:36:52] thousand
[1:36:53] generations which
[1:36:56] covet he made with abraham and his oath
[1:37:00] unto isaac and confirmed the same unto
[1:37:04] jacob for our law
[1:37:06] and to israel for an everlasting
[1:37:09] covenant
[1:37:11] saying unto thee will i give the land of
[1:37:14] canaan
[1:37:15] the lot of your inheritance
[1:37:18] when they were but a few man
[1:37:21] in number yay very few
[1:37:24] and strangers in it
[1:37:30] when they went from one nation to
[1:37:32] another and from one
[1:37:34] kingdom to another people he suffered
[1:37:38] no man to do them wrong
[1:37:41] yea he reproved kings for their sake
[1:37:45] saying touch not my anointed
[1:37:48] and do my prophets no harm
[1:37:54] may the lord bless the reading of his
[1:37:56] words
[1:38:01] i have a few scriptures written out here
[1:38:03] somewhere that i was going to refer to
[1:38:06] perhaps along the road
[1:38:11] i wonder today who's going to be the
[1:38:14] next president the election is coming up
[1:38:17] you know
[1:38:18] who's going to be president
[1:38:22] this next term what if
[1:38:25] i knew there's only one that does know
[1:38:29] and that's god
[1:38:32] and what if god would reveal to me who's
[1:38:35] going to be the next
[1:38:36] president and i stood here in phoenix
[1:38:39] and made a prediction that
[1:38:41] such and such a man would be the next
[1:38:43] president of the united states
[1:38:47] and they would place that in papers and
[1:38:50] so forth and
[1:38:51] i would hit it right on the dot
[1:38:54] it would be perfect
[1:38:58] and it would be all that i had said
[1:39:01] would come to pass
[1:39:03] but what good would it do
[1:39:06] what good is it anyhow if i if i should
[1:39:10] do such a thing
[1:39:12] the papers would advertise it and it
[1:39:15] would go out maybe if such a person
[1:39:17] could make such a prediction
[1:39:19] and it would be true all the newspapers
[1:39:21] and magazines would
[1:39:23] would pass on it but you know that
[1:39:27] god doesn't do things like that
[1:39:31] god doesn't use his power and his gifts
[1:39:34] for
[1:39:35] foolishness it's going to be whatever is
[1:39:38] president it will be president
[1:39:40] and to know now which would be president
[1:39:43] wouldn't help us
[1:39:44] one penny
[1:39:47] it wouldn't do us one bit of good to
[1:39:50] know who's going to be president
[1:39:54] so therefore god doesn't do those things
[1:39:56] like that
[1:39:58] and then if i made such a prediction
[1:40:01] as that and it come to pass and the
[1:40:04] newspapers packed it
[1:40:06] and the magazines then
[1:40:09] it would be to my glory
[1:40:12] people would say look what a great
[1:40:13] prophet brother branham is
[1:40:16] he told us long before it happened
[1:40:19] just who would be president and that
[1:40:22] would be to my glory
[1:40:25] but god doesn't want he's not interested
[1:40:27] in working things to my glory
[1:40:31] or to to any other man's glory
[1:40:35] he's interested to work things to
[1:40:38] his glory something that will
[1:40:41] profit like paul said
[1:40:44] if we speak with tongues and do not have
[1:40:47] an interpreter
[1:40:48] what good does it do we only glorify
[1:40:50] ourselves
[1:40:52] and that's uh edify ourselves that's uh
[1:40:56] kind of out of the line for god
[1:41:00] god wants to be edified himself
[1:41:04] and we're to not seek self edification
[1:41:07] but
[1:41:07] to edify god with all we do
[1:41:12] so therefore i believe this morning if i
[1:41:15] knew who he would be
[1:41:17] and exactly when he would be elected and
[1:41:19] all how many
[1:41:20] votes he'd be over under or whatever it
[1:41:23] might be
[1:41:24] it wouldn't do one bit of good
[1:41:27] to tell it it'd be best for me just to
[1:41:30] keep it still if i did know it
[1:41:32] not try to publish it because there
[1:41:35] would be
[1:41:36] there would be no reason for me to do it
[1:41:39] because it's going to be anyhow and it
[1:41:41] doesn't
[1:41:42] make us that much difference uh who's
[1:41:45] going to be president
[1:41:46] but god when he uses his
[1:41:50] gifts he uses them
[1:41:53] for his own glory and for the glory
[1:41:57] of his people for the glory of his
[1:42:02] church for the edifying of the body of
[1:42:05] christ
[1:42:06] and for the glory of the kingdom of god
[1:42:10] that's why he gives these things in his
[1:42:13] church
[1:42:14] yes teachers prophets evangelists
[1:42:18] pastors they are for the edification
[1:42:22] of the church and for the glory of
[1:42:26] god the prophet is not to get out and
[1:42:29] mingle with the world and
[1:42:31] try to take a gift like balaam did and
[1:42:34] make
[1:42:35] havoc or our money out of it or
[1:42:38] something
[1:42:39] if he's a prophet he's supposed to
[1:42:41] reveal
[1:42:42] god to the church and stay out of the
[1:42:45] things of the world
[1:42:47] it's all for the glory of god
[1:42:50] now we do have and i think
[1:42:54] it's a good thing for us as ministers
[1:42:58] to follow our order when we see such
[1:43:01] things in the world as we see today and
[1:43:04] we have an
[1:43:05] order from god is for the discerning
[1:43:09] of spirits trying the spirit
[1:43:14] i believe that that is a very great
[1:43:17] lesson for the church
[1:43:19] today is to try the spirit
[1:43:22] of anything have discernment of the
[1:43:26] spirit
[1:43:28] i do not think that we should ever by
[1:43:31] any means
[1:43:32] ever try to judge a person
[1:43:35] by the denomination they belong to
[1:43:38] are by the group that they are assembled
[1:43:42] with
[1:43:42] whether they be methodist baptist
[1:43:45] presbyterian
[1:43:46] pentecostal or whatever they are
[1:43:49] we should never judge the man
[1:43:52] by the denomination that he belongs to
[1:43:57] we should always judge him by the spirit
[1:44:00] he has see the spirit
[1:44:04] whether he's a a latter rain or
[1:44:08] farmer rain or inner outer rain or no
[1:44:11] rain or
[1:44:12] whatever it might be we should never
[1:44:14] judge him by that but by his
[1:44:17] spirit we are to discern spirits
[1:44:22] watch what the man has in mind
[1:44:26] what he has what he's trying to achieve
[1:44:30] if the man by a gift no matter how great
[1:44:33] the gift is
[1:44:36] now i want to get this to the church
[1:44:39] this morning
[1:44:40] which into the different denominations
[1:44:42] you are still
[1:44:43] the church of the living god together
[1:44:48] and this is the thing i want to get to
[1:44:51] you
[1:44:52] see that we are really not divided
[1:44:56] we are the stones that's cut in
[1:44:58] different forms
[1:44:59] all to the glory of god
[1:45:02] now there is so much in the day that we
[1:45:05] live in
[1:45:06] pertaining to gifts so many
[1:45:10] people judge people by gifts that they
[1:45:13] have
[1:45:14] well i believe that these things are
[1:45:17] gifts
[1:45:18] i believe that what we see take place is
[1:45:21] gifts and they're god-given gifts
[1:45:26] but we if we do not use them in the
[1:45:29] right way
[1:45:31] that god intended them to be used then
[1:45:34] we can do more
[1:45:36] harm with the gifts than we could if we
[1:45:39] did not
[1:45:40] have the gifts
[1:45:44] other night i made a statement at the
[1:45:45] pulpit saying this
[1:45:47] that i would rather see brotherly love
[1:45:50] existing among the church if we didn't
[1:45:52] have
[1:45:52] one case of healing or anything else
[1:45:56] we must know what these things are for
[1:46:00] now if a man comes and he has a great
[1:46:03] gift
[1:46:04] no matter if he belongs to our
[1:46:06] denomination or another denomination
[1:46:09] don't judge him by what denomination he
[1:46:11] come from
[1:46:12] how he dresses but what you want to see
[1:46:15] is what he's trying to do with that gift
[1:46:19] what purpose he has if he's trying to
[1:46:22] take his influence and build himself a
[1:46:24] great name out of it
[1:46:26] i'd have discernment of spirit enough to
[1:46:29] know that's wrong
[1:46:31] no matter how great her teacher he is
[1:46:33] how powerful he is how intellectual he
[1:46:35] is
[1:46:36] or how his gift operates if he
[1:46:40] isn't trying to achieve something for
[1:46:42] the benefit
[1:46:43] of the body of christ your own spiritual
[1:46:47] discernment would tell you that that's
[1:46:49] wrong
[1:46:50] no matter how accurate how perfect how
[1:46:53] it
[1:46:54] is it's wrong if it isn't used for the
[1:46:56] body of jesus christ
[1:47:01] to achieve something maybe he's got a
[1:47:04] great gift that he could draw people
[1:47:06] together with a great
[1:47:08] intellectual or a spiritual power that
[1:47:10] he could draw people together and maybe
[1:47:12] he's trying to take that gift and make
[1:47:14] himself
[1:47:15] famous so he'll have a big name
[1:47:20] so that other brethren will look up to
[1:47:22] him as some big person
[1:47:24] then that's wrong amen maybe he's trying
[1:47:28] to
[1:47:29] to edify a certain thing here that he
[1:47:32] wants
[1:47:32] everybody else to get out of the picture
[1:47:34] and let him and his group
[1:47:36] be the picture that's still wrong
[1:47:40] but if he has a gift of god and he's
[1:47:43] trying to edify the body of christ
[1:47:46] then i don't care what he belongs to
[1:47:49] you're not discerning
[1:47:50] the man you're discerning the spirit the
[1:47:53] life that's
[1:47:54] in the man and that's what god told us
[1:47:57] to do
[1:47:59] not one time was we ever commissioned to
[1:48:01] discern
[1:48:02] that uh the man's group but we was
[1:48:07] uh constrained and commanded by
[1:48:10] god to discern the spirit in the man
[1:48:16] what he's trying to do what the spirit
[1:48:19] in his
[1:48:20] life is trying to lead him to
[1:48:23] and then if we can find out that he's
[1:48:26] trying to
[1:48:26] lead the people not to break them up
[1:48:31] but to bring them together and to bring
[1:48:34] the church of the living god
[1:48:36] not all to one denomination but to an
[1:48:39] understanding
[1:48:41] of fellowship a unity of spirit
[1:48:45] then if he is former rain or lateran or
[1:48:48] whatever it is
[1:48:50] his spirit and his purpose is right
[1:48:54] and the spirit that's in him no matter
[1:48:56] what move he belongs to
[1:48:58] the spirit that's in him is trying to
[1:49:01] part the people to
[1:49:02] calvary away from himself or away from
[1:49:06] anything else but his
[1:49:07] only achievement he has is to point them
[1:49:10] to
[1:49:10] calvary he doesn't care whether he's
[1:49:13] even
[1:49:14] knowed or not he doesn't care whether
[1:49:16] he's even his own movement which is
[1:49:18] fine see it's good
[1:49:21] if he is a methodist or a presbyterian
[1:49:24] or
[1:49:25] a roman catholic or whatever he wants to
[1:49:27] be by
[1:49:28] denomination but what is he trying to do
[1:49:31] the purpose of his heart that he's
[1:49:33] trying to get
[1:49:34] then you can see what's in the man's
[1:49:36] life
[1:49:37] whether his motives as far as his
[1:49:40] denomination
[1:49:41] whether it's for his self whether it's
[1:49:43] for
[1:49:44] worldly fame whether it's for big names
[1:49:47] to say i
[1:49:47] predicted that come just exactly to pass
[1:49:51] now i see that's wrong right there to
[1:49:53] begin with
[1:49:54] but if he's trying to use what god's
[1:49:57] given as a teacher
[1:49:58] as a prophet as a seer a new testament
[1:50:02] prophet is a preacher we all know that
[1:50:04] just any minister that's a preacher is a
[1:50:06] prophet
[1:50:06] a new testament prophet if he's
[1:50:08] prophesying
[1:50:10] preaching not to try to edify himself to
[1:50:13] make a big name
[1:50:14] or to edify his organization which he
[1:50:17] should be in an organization here i am
[1:50:20] without one but yet
[1:50:21] preaching you should be that's right
[1:50:23] every man ought to have a church home
[1:50:26] you ought to have a place not just to
[1:50:29] float about from pillar to post
[1:50:31] but have somewhere that you go to church
[1:50:33] and you call it your church somewhere
[1:50:35] you pay your tithes
[1:50:37] and somewhere that you help support the
[1:50:39] cause take your choice
[1:50:41] but then don't never disfellowship the
[1:50:43] other man because he don't belong with
[1:50:45] your group
[1:50:46] see discern his spirit and see if he's
[1:50:48] got the same purpose in heart
[1:50:50] then you've got fellowship one with
[1:50:52] another you're working for one great
[1:50:54] cause that's the cause of christ i think
[1:50:57] that is absolutely true now if we will
[1:51:00] notice
[1:51:01] the motives and objectives of the old
[1:51:04] testament prophets
[1:51:08] damn man had one objective that was
[1:51:11] jesus christ
[1:51:13] they had one thing that their whole
[1:51:15] theme of the old testament
[1:51:17] was built around the coming messiah
[1:51:21] they they did not go out and do things
[1:51:24] just
[1:51:25] for money or for fame they had
[1:51:28] one thing they were anointed with the
[1:51:31] spirit of god
[1:51:32] and they predicted the coming messiah
[1:51:37] and those men were so anointed with the
[1:51:40] spirit
[1:51:41] until they sometimes acted
[1:51:45] like the spirit that was within them
[1:51:48] they spoke
[1:51:49] seemingly of themselves
[1:51:52] watch how the spirit of god made that
[1:51:54] man act
[1:51:56] we'll take for instance moses the great
[1:51:59] prophet how that
[1:52:02] that man had no selfish objectives at
[1:52:05] all
[1:52:06] he could have been the king of egypt he
[1:52:09] could have had the world
[1:52:10] under his feet but because that he
[1:52:14] was a prophet at heart
[1:52:19] he refused to be called the son of
[1:52:22] pharaoh's daughter
[1:52:24] choosing rather to suffer the
[1:52:26] persecution
[1:52:28] and the trials of christ
[1:52:31] esteeming the treasures of heaven
[1:52:34] greater treasures than them of egypt he
[1:52:37] forsook and
[1:52:39] denied himself of the worldly
[1:52:42] thing of the luxury and the
[1:52:46] the things that life offers
[1:52:49] he had to look beyond that
[1:52:54] see he could have been that just take
[1:52:57] the minister
[1:52:58] today if he has the baptism of the holy
[1:53:00] spirit
[1:53:02] and he knows that if he preaches that
[1:53:04] word
[1:53:05] it's going to cut his fame down it's
[1:53:08] going to put him in a little bitty
[1:53:09] church somewhere
[1:53:11] or maybe out on the street
[1:53:14] but he knows that something in his heart
[1:53:17] is burning
[1:53:20] he sees the coming of the lord he
[1:53:22] doesn't care whether
[1:53:24] that he has a big church our little
[1:53:26] church he doesn't care whether he has uh
[1:53:29] today's food or not no food he doesn't
[1:53:32] care whether he has good clothes or
[1:53:33] doesn't have good clothes
[1:53:35] he's only mindful of one thing and
[1:53:38] that's
[1:53:39] the very life within him crying out
[1:53:44] he's trying to achieve something for
[1:53:47] the glory of god and that man in doing
[1:53:50] so will act the very
[1:53:52] life of the spirit that's in him
[1:53:56] do you follow me he'll act it out
[1:53:59] look at moses when he come to a time
[1:54:02] that
[1:54:02] he displayed all his life was the spirit
[1:54:05] of christ
[1:54:06] for christ was in him
[1:54:10] christ was in moses by measure
[1:54:13] now if we notice he was born
[1:54:17] in the time of persecution
[1:54:20] the children was killed to try to get
[1:54:22] him just
[1:54:23] exactly like they did uh jesus
[1:54:27] and we find out that when it come to a
[1:54:30] place that the
[1:54:31] children of israel had disobeyed in such
[1:54:34] a way
[1:54:36] until god was angry with them
[1:54:40] and he said to moses step aside
[1:54:45] and i'll destroy the whole group of them
[1:54:49] and i'll take of you and raise up
[1:54:50] another generation
[1:54:52] moses chew himself in the path of god's
[1:54:55] judgment
[1:54:57] and said take me before you take them in
[1:55:00] other words before you can get them
[1:55:01] you'll have to come over me
[1:55:04] that's exactly what jesus christ did
[1:55:08] when god would have wiped the whole face
[1:55:10] of the earth off with these sinners you
[1:55:12] and i
[1:55:13] but christ threw yourself in the path
[1:55:18] god could not do it he couldn't come
[1:55:19] over his own son
[1:55:22] and when god seen that spirit in moses
[1:55:25] hanging in the judgment
[1:55:26] like a cross there you can't come to him
[1:55:28] you'll have to take me first
[1:55:32] see the spirit of god in moses
[1:55:35] when he could have been king of egypt
[1:55:38] when he could have had
[1:55:39] every luxury in the world to be popular
[1:55:43] when he could have been the great king
[1:55:45] of the world at that time
[1:55:47] but he chose to suffer the persecutions
[1:55:51] and the affliction for he has steamed
[1:55:53] the reproach of christ
[1:55:55] greater treasures and that of egypt
[1:55:59] you see he threw his self in a way why
[1:56:02] it was
[1:56:02] god in moses did that
[1:56:05] the normal thinking intellectual man
[1:56:08] would never do that
[1:56:10] he would take the easy road so no matter
[1:56:13] how much a fanatic
[1:56:14] moses seemed to be he was trying you see
[1:56:16] he was a true prophet of god
[1:56:18] because he was trying to achieve
[1:56:20] something for the kingdom of god
[1:56:23] now with his great gift of prophecy he
[1:56:26] might have been a wise man could have
[1:56:27] stood up in egypt and said
[1:56:29] now wait i'll prophesy so and so i'll
[1:56:32] say so and so and
[1:56:33] as with his prophecy but in in all he
[1:56:36] had been world famous
[1:56:39] but that wasn't in his heart it couldn't
[1:56:42] be in his heart
[1:56:44] so if you see a person with a great gift
[1:56:47] trying to do something to glorify
[1:56:48] themselves
[1:56:50] your own discernment of the spirit tells
[1:56:52] you that's wrong
[1:56:56] moses was trying to achieve something
[1:56:58] for the glory of god
[1:56:59] no matter how bad it was how evil it
[1:57:02] looked how much it was talked about
[1:57:04] the spirit in moses directed him
[1:57:07] straight to the line of duty
[1:57:10] the spirit in him look at joseph
[1:57:13] joseph was when he was born he was
[1:57:16] loved of the father and hated by his
[1:57:20] brethren
[1:57:21] perfect type of christ and the only
[1:57:24] he was a blood brother to them the same
[1:57:26] father
[1:57:27] but the reason his brethren hated him
[1:57:30] was about a cause
[1:57:32] because god had made him a prophet
[1:57:35] spiritual a seer and they hated him for
[1:57:39] that
[1:57:39] very purpose but joseph could not help
[1:57:43] it because
[1:57:44] god had made him that way and what's the
[1:57:47] spirit of god
[1:57:49] in joseph
[1:57:52] watch what he did he even acted the part
[1:57:55] of christ
[1:57:58] he was hated of his brethren loved of
[1:58:01] his father because
[1:58:02] of the spirit made the difference
[1:58:05] he was a spiritual man
[1:58:08] he saw visions he interpreted dreams
[1:58:12] he did not do it for his own glory he
[1:58:15] did it because there was something in
[1:58:17] him
[1:58:18] the spirit of god he wouldn't have went
[1:58:21] out there by his own self
[1:58:23] and have been thrown into a ditch and
[1:58:25] have his poor old father to grieve all
[1:58:27] those years
[1:58:28] sold for nearly 30 pieces of silver
[1:58:31] taken up from the ditch
[1:58:32] and became the right-hand man of pharaoh
[1:58:36] the king of earth at that time and in
[1:58:39] his prison house
[1:58:40] there was a butler and a baker and one
[1:58:44] was lost
[1:58:44] and the other was saved by his
[1:58:47] prediction
[1:58:48] in the prison house and did you notice
[1:58:51] jesus
[1:58:52] when he came he was loved of the father
[1:58:56] and the father gave joseph a coat of
[1:58:59] many colors the rainbow a covenant
[1:59:03] and the father god gave his son jesus
[1:59:06] the covenant
[1:59:10] and then the jewish brother
[1:59:13] hated him without a cause
[1:59:18] he had no reason to hate him he was
[1:59:21] spiritual and he was god's
[1:59:23] word made manifest he
[1:59:26] come to do the will of the father he
[1:59:29] come to fulfill
[1:59:30] the scriptures he came to bring them
[1:59:32] peace
[1:59:33] but they misunderstood him and hated him
[1:59:35] without a cause
[1:59:37] they didn't stop to try to see what he
[1:59:39] was trying to achieve
[1:59:42] they just judged him because he didn't
[1:59:44] agree with them
[1:59:46] they may he makes himself so and so he
[1:59:49] makes himself god
[1:59:51] he was god god was in him
[1:59:54] the bible said god was in christ
[1:59:57] manifesting himself to the world he
[2:00:01] was the god of glory manifesting the
[2:00:05] glory of god
[2:00:06] amen look at moses he couldn't help
[2:00:10] throwing himself there
[2:00:12] he didn't do that hypocritically he did
[2:00:15] it because
[2:00:16] god was in him
[2:00:20] neither could joseph help being what he
[2:00:22] was
[2:00:23] because it was god in him working or
[2:00:26] displaying himself through the man
[2:00:30] never did he do it for self glory any
[2:00:32] man that if those
[2:00:34] priests would only have the discernment
[2:00:35] of spirit as i'm speaking to you this
[2:00:37] morning
[2:00:38] regardless of how much the world talked
[2:00:40] about him they still
[2:00:42] would have known amen if they'd
[2:00:45] look to the word if they were seeing his
[2:00:47] purpose
[2:00:49] he was always doing that to glorify the
[2:00:51] father
[2:00:52] he said they said oh this man's a great
[2:00:54] healer he does these things like that
[2:00:57] he said i can do nothing till the father
[2:00:59] shows me
[2:01:01] it is not me that doeth the works
[2:01:05] it's the father that dwelleth in me he
[2:01:07] doeth the words
[2:01:10] he never took the glory
[2:01:13] neither would any servant of god take
[2:01:15] glory neither would any servant or god
[2:01:17] take a gift of god and try to glorify
[2:01:20] himself
[2:01:20] or anything else but his right
[2:01:22] achievement is to do something to the
[2:01:24] glory of god
[2:01:27] that's ways see the same thing today
[2:01:30] we must have discernment of spirit to
[2:01:33] see
[2:01:34] a person what they're trying to do are
[2:01:36] they trying to glorify
[2:01:38] god are they trying to glorify
[2:01:40] themselves now the spirit
[2:01:42] of god working in man makes man
[2:01:45] act like god no wonder jesus said
[2:01:51] is not it written ye are gods
[2:01:56] and if they call them gods to whom the
[2:01:58] spirit of god came to
[2:02:00] how can you condemn me that when i am
[2:02:03] the son of god
[2:02:05] if you could see the spirit of god in
[2:02:07] moses which he was god
[2:02:10] moses was a god joseph was a god
[2:02:13] the prophets were gods the bible said
[2:02:16] they were
[2:02:16] yes they were gods because
[2:02:20] they had completely surrendered
[2:02:21] themselves to the spirit of god
[2:02:24] that they were working for the glory of
[2:02:26] god
[2:02:27] and when a man is so anointed with the
[2:02:30] spirit
[2:02:32] i let this go real deep
[2:02:36] under the fifth rib on the left side
[2:02:38] when a man
[2:02:39] is anointed of the spirit of god his
[2:02:42] habits his actions and everything is god
[2:02:45] moving in him
[2:02:48] sometimes he's misjudged look at david
[2:02:50] in the 23rd psalm
[2:02:52] he cried my god my god
[2:02:55] why has thou forsaken me
[2:02:59] as if he was if david was the man
[2:03:03] all they that passed me by shoot their
[2:03:06] lip out at me
[2:03:08] he was so anointed with god
[2:03:11] he was so perfectly surrendered to god
[2:03:15] and the anointing was on him in such a
[2:03:16] way and when he cried by the spirit of
[2:03:19] god
[2:03:19] if somebody been standing there saying
[2:03:21] well look he thinks somebody shoot their
[2:03:23] lip out at him
[2:03:25] why has god forsaken him it wasn't david
[2:03:28] it was a spirit crying out through david
[2:03:32] amen my god my god
[2:03:35] why has i forsaken me my bones all stare
[2:03:38] at me
[2:03:39] they have pierced my hands and my feet
[2:03:42] well somebody said listen that hypocrite
[2:03:44] up there whose hands is pierced whose
[2:03:46] feet is pierced
[2:03:48] that's the intellectual but one who had
[2:03:50] discernment of spirit
[2:03:52] knew that that was the spirit of god in
[2:03:54] him crying out
[2:03:57] when a man is anointed of the spirit of
[2:03:59] god he's got the action of god
[2:04:02] and the action of god is never to break
[2:04:05] us up
[2:04:06] the action of god is to draw us together
[2:04:08] for we are one in
[2:04:10] christ jesus and god's purpose is to
[2:04:13] bring us together
[2:04:15] love one another
[2:04:21] that'll make you want to go back and
[2:04:23] finish on it
[2:04:25] but don't miss the underlying
[2:04:29] thing that he was saying
[2:04:33] look at when you discern look at what
[2:04:35] it's achieving
[2:04:38] look at your own actions what is it
[2:04:39] achieving
[2:04:41] is it achieving for christ does it
[2:04:43] glorify god
[2:04:45] is it for the purpose that
[2:04:48] that and you notice he emphasized this
[2:04:52] how important it is to discern
[2:04:56] that's why he says if a man's trying to
[2:04:58] do something that's good for the kingdom
[2:05:00] of god
[2:05:01] and you discern he's got the spirit of
[2:05:03] christ
[2:05:04] praise god you have fellowship in that
[2:05:08] and so we'll just leave it there this
[2:05:11] morning but
[2:05:13] i think you could get a lot from that
[2:05:15] this morning a lot about the attitude
[2:05:18] a lot about how you approach things how
[2:05:21] you look at things
[2:05:22] how important it is to discern
[2:05:26] things a man so if
[2:05:29] kaley if you're ready and and i guess
[2:05:32] nikki you'll go help her
[2:05:34] and jonathan you'll come and and help me
[2:05:36] and we'll turn the service
[2:05:38] back over to brother ability to
[2:05:41] clean this stand together as we're gonna
[2:05:43] go pray
[2:05:44] to get ready for the baptism
[2:05:48] we'd also like to greet
[2:05:51] everybody who's out on
[2:05:56] line watching and and
[2:06:01] and uh just greet you and and hope that
[2:06:04] uh the dale comes soon
[2:06:07] that uh
[2:06:10] we can have you back in our midst i i
[2:06:13] trust that
[2:06:15] everybody will come back
[2:06:18] we won't know that i guess for another
[2:06:20] month or two
[2:06:22] i get a lot of questions about the
[2:06:24] vaccine
[2:06:26] whether or not i would take the vaccine
[2:06:29] i probably would take the vaccine i'm
[2:06:32] not afraid of it
[2:06:34] if it kills me praise god
[2:06:39] as one sister told me well i'm going to
[2:06:41] see how many people it kills before i
[2:06:44] take it you know we take up a deadly
[2:06:48] thing
[2:06:48] you know it will not harm us somebody
[2:06:52] said well they're going to inject a chip
[2:06:54] in you
[2:06:54] so they can keep track of you well if
[2:06:57] you're afraid of that
[2:06:58] throw your cell phone away because they
[2:07:00] know where you are
[2:07:03] i went mcdonald's the other day by the
[2:07:06] time i got back in my truck
[2:07:08] there's a little sign said how did you
[2:07:10] enjoy mcdonald's
[2:07:12] i said how did you know i was at
[2:07:13] mcdonald's
[2:07:17] so you know we've got to go on
[2:07:22] serving god we've got to go on shedding
[2:07:25] the love
[2:07:26] of god abroad in our heart we've got to
[2:07:28] go on
[2:07:29] letting the world know like prophet of
[2:07:32] god said they're pointing to calvary
[2:07:35] if their spirit's right well let us have
[2:07:37] the right spirit
[2:07:39] let us have the right motive and
[2:07:40] objective let us have the reflect
[2:07:43] if the spirit of god is in a man he'll
[2:07:45] act out the word of god
[2:07:48] a word lived by the life lived by the
[2:07:52] word

[2:19:42] attracted the people and they came out
[2:19:44] of the
[2:19:45] upper room and and the
[2:19:48] the people thought they were drunk and
[2:19:51] peter went to preaching
[2:19:53] and the disciples went to preaching and
[2:19:55] and
[2:19:56] everybody heard them in their own tongue
[2:19:59] and then after the conclusion their
[2:20:02] hearts are
[2:20:02] pricked and this is where we
[2:20:06] pick up the story and when they heard
[2:20:09] this
[2:20:10] they were pricked in their heart and
[2:20:13] said unto peter and the rest of the
[2:20:16] apostles
[2:20:17] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:20:20] then peter said unto them repent
[2:20:24] and be baptized every one of you
[2:20:28] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:20:31] remission of sins
[2:20:34] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:20:38] holy ghost
[2:20:39] for the promises unto you and to your
[2:20:43] children
[2:20:44] and to all that are far off even as
[2:20:47] many as our lord our god shall call
[2:20:51] and within many other words did he
[2:20:54] testify
[2:20:55] and exhort saying save yourselves from
[2:20:58] this
[2:20:58] up towards generation and they that
[2:21:01] gladly received his word
[2:21:04] were baptized and the same day
