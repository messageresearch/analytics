[11:39] amen we have a rugged soldier with us
[11:42] tonight i don't want to call him old
[11:44] but we're happy to have brother jeremy
[11:48] with us he's one of those
[11:51] ministers that i don't think it's fair
[11:53] that he can sing
[11:56] and preach both but
[11:59] you know i said i'd rather sing guy told
[12:02] me you can't do either one so
[12:04] so but i'm so happy to have him brother
[12:06] jeremy so i've asked him if he would
[12:09] sing
[12:10] so if he's got two gifts he might as
[12:11] well use them both right
[12:13] and so we're grateful for that so i went
[12:16] out you just may be seated i guess and
[12:18] we'll just ask
[12:20] here i just found out tonight that that
[12:23] they're related some way to the mackie
[12:26] so i thought that was pretty good i
[12:28] don't know
[12:29] how exactly it all works but it's great
[12:31] so jeremy
[12:32] happy to have you and there's the piano
[12:35] and
[12:36] whatever you want to do and sing for it
[12:39] he said whatever i want to do there's a
[12:41] difference there
[12:45] amen you're doing pretty good over there
[12:47] yourself but
[12:49] um actually there's a song that we've
[12:51] been singing as a congregational

[18:18] sing this song together

[18:24] the most important thing
[18:27] make sure everything is out of the way

[18:30] that you know that only god can meet
[18:33] that need
[18:34] there's nothing that i can do if your
[18:36] pastor was here there's nothing he could
[18:37] do
[18:38] if brother branham was here there's
[18:39] nothing that he could do except your
[18:41] faith accept that
[18:43] what we need is jesus and we want him to
[18:46] be
[18:46] complete take complete preeminence of
[18:49] the service

[21:00] your word lord and
[21:02] speak these things father that you've
[21:03] laid upon our heart
[21:05] lord we ask that you would just i give
[21:08] myself to you lord and i ask that you
[21:09] would speak through me now
[21:10] through these few moments and god that
[21:13] there would be a heart tonight
[21:14] maybe that would be open and i open my
[21:17] heart to you lord and i say father if
[21:19] there's anything that's out of the way
[21:20] would you make it correct
[21:21] father lord of nothing else that we want
[21:24] father we have not come here tonight
[21:25] none of us i believe as believers lord
[21:27] to be seen or to be heard
[21:30] but to sit at your feet and to hear your
[21:32] word
[21:33] lord so now we ask again that you would
[21:35] please speak to our hearts
[21:36] as we surrender ourselves to you we love
[21:39] you and we thank you for it in jesus
[21:41] name
[21:42] amen god bless you this evening let's
[21:45] open our bibles to the book of matthew
[21:47] chapter five i do want to say
[21:49] that uh i'm looking for troy i can't
[21:53] miss him there you are
[21:54] and troy there's kelly there and so high
[21:59] hallelujah i told brother uh brother
[22:02] mcgary i said i wanted to
[22:04] say thank you for uh
[22:08] taking good care of my our family and
[22:12] so we're so thankful i've seen
[22:15] someone else up here just a little bit
[22:16] ago christian too i believe was up here
[22:18] so
[22:18] good to see you all greetings from
[22:23] north of north texas
[22:26] it's weird that you have to travel five
[22:29] hours south
[22:30] east to get to north texas but
[22:33] greetings from amarillo texas we love
[22:35] you we appreciate you
[22:36] we're going to speak on something
[22:37] tonight that is very simple
[22:40] and i i am a worker myself so i'll do my
[22:42] very best to not hold you too long
[22:44] but i believe this is relevant it's been
[22:46] a series that we've spoke at home
[22:49] uh i my son asked me he said what are
[22:52] you speaking on i said well if the lord
[22:53] leads we're going to speak on
[22:55] a portion of the beatitudes he says that
[22:57] means we're going to be there a while
[23:00] i said no we're not going to go through
[23:02] the whole thing trust me just what the
[23:03] lord leads tonight
[23:05] verse 1 and seeing the multitudes he
[23:08] went up into
[23:09] a mountain and when he was set
[23:14] his disciples came unto him and he
[23:17] opened his mouth
[23:18] and taught them saying blessed
[23:22] are the poor in spirit don't we don't
[23:25] you think this is relevant today
[23:28] i don't want to get so caught up on what
[23:29] we think is revelation
[23:32] and what gets us to it you know there's
[23:33] so many people that claim to believe
[23:35] brother branham a god sent a prophet but
[23:37] yet they don't have the life that he had
[23:40] you know so i say this is relevant for
[23:43] us as believers
[23:44] this is not just a sunday school story
[23:47] hallelujah
[23:48] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[23:51] theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed
[23:53] are they that mourn
[23:54] for they shall be comforted blessed are
[23:57] the meek
[23:57] for they shall inherit the earth and
[24:00] blessed are they which do hunger and
[24:02] thirst
[24:03] after righteousness for they shall be
[24:07] filled amen you can be seated this
[24:09] evening
[24:13] i know that this is probably something
[24:14] that has been taught and so
[24:16] maybe if i could stir the gift that lies
[24:19] within you
[24:20] this evening and not try to bring
[24:21] anything new but
[24:23] encourage us as believers to know that
[24:27] though we claim a message and we claim
[24:29] that god sent a prophet and we
[24:32] we you know we claim to have these
[24:34] experiences that there's also
[24:37] a life that we as believers must live
[24:39] and
[24:40] i don't think that jesus just
[24:43] took this sermon lightly i think it was
[24:45] extremely important for us as believers
[24:48] and as we try to jump through this
[24:50] quickly we look first
[24:51] we're just going to try if we can to do
[24:53] the first four
[24:55] this simply blessed are the poor
[24:58] in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[25:01] heaven now
[25:02] defining blessed to be blessed means
[25:06] to be approved or to find approval
[25:09] in this case approved of god and the
[25:12] and there can be no higher blessing i
[25:15] want to be approved by you
[25:17] but there's no higher blessing than the
[25:18] approval of god how many can say amen
[25:21] so the fundamental question that we let
[25:23] everyone who reads the sermon on a mount
[25:25] is faced with
[25:26] is this whose approval will you seek
[25:30] will you seek man's approval or god's
[25:32] approval
[25:34] proverbs 16 18 and 19 says pride goeth
[25:36] before destruction in a haughty or
[25:38] arrogant spirit before a fall better
[25:42] it is to be of a humble spirit with the
[25:45] lowly than to divide the spoil with the
[25:47] proud
[25:48] so we simply know this being taught that
[25:50] being humble is the opposite of
[25:52] of pride pride says you do not need god
[25:57] take for instance the first fall in this
[25:59] thought process genesis 3 5
[26:02] for god doth know that in the day that
[26:03] you eat thereof
[26:05] then your eyes shall be opened and ye
[26:07] shall be as gods knowing good and evil
[26:10] now there was something that had to be
[26:12] appealing and i don't want to get
[26:13] doctrinal or
[26:14] dive too much but let's just look it
[26:16] into our humanity
[26:17] there was something that was appealing
[26:19] about that temptation
[26:21] and it was that they would no longer be
[26:23] dependent on god think about it
[26:25] what is the thing that every young
[26:26] person faces you remember if you're not
[26:29] too far from youth is that
[26:31] i can try to prove it i can try to prove
[26:33] that i'm not going to be that young
[26:34] person i can try to prove that i can be
[26:36] different
[26:37] and in that first start of the that
[26:39] process which might be starting on the
[26:41] right foot we try to do it on our own
[26:43] because we want to try to prove that
[26:45] we're not that person we're not this one
[26:47] and that we can do it on our own and
[26:48] then it turns into
[26:49] a self-righteous attitude and so that
[26:52] first temptation was that they're no
[26:54] longer to be dependent upon god
[26:56] so every day of their lives up to that
[26:58] point were examples of being totally
[27:01] dependent upon god
[27:03] back in the garden every day until this
[27:05] point they were totally dependent upon
[27:06] god
[27:07] one reason for that fall is that they no
[27:09] longer wanted to be dependent
[27:11] think about this now again just look at
[27:14] this
[27:14] this idea of it anyone but themselves
[27:17] and we've been living that way ever
[27:20] since
[27:21] they wanted to know she wanted to know
[27:23] what this was going to be like
[27:24] right she wanted to know uh uh you know
[27:27] all of
[27:28] all of the answers she wanted to have
[27:29] all the answers what is the what is the
[27:31] question of today
[27:32] the youth of today are the thought
[27:34] processes is we want to have an answer
[27:36] for everything we want
[27:37] we want to be able to have it explained
[27:39] in detail if you can't explain to me
[27:41] perfectly in a scientific way
[27:42] then you know i'm just not going to
[27:44] believe it and so it's always been
[27:46] something that has
[27:48] from from the beginning to where we are
[27:49] today is something that we see is
[27:51] is is very strong and rampant especially
[27:54] since we're at this final moment of
[27:55] history
[27:57] that poor in spirit means to be totally
[28:00] dependent on god
[28:03] psalms 51 16 i hope you don't mind if i
[28:06] read a portion from the amplified
[28:07] tonight
[28:08] for if you delight not in sacrifice uh
[28:11] for you deny delight not in sacrifice or
[28:14] else
[28:14] else would i give it you find no
[28:16] pleasure and burn offering
[28:18] verse 17 my sacrifice the sacrifice
[28:21] acceptable to god is a broken
[28:23] spirit a broken and contrite heart
[28:27] broken down with sorrow for sin and
[28:30] humbly and thoroughly pentanent such
[28:33] oh god you will not despise
[28:36] so as we are finding in these beatitudes
[28:38] there is something that has to happen to
[28:40] us
[28:41] as an individual that if the before you
[28:43] can carry on
[28:45] into a i would say further and deeper
[28:48] revelation
[28:49] we first must come to the understanding
[28:51] that we must be humble
[28:52] we must be poor in spirit we must have
[28:54] that broken and contrite heart
[28:56] it's not coming back to god it's like
[28:58] you find a lot of times today
[29:00] where people that that leave the church
[29:02] and they go out and they sow their seeds
[29:04] they do whatever they do
[29:05] and then they come back and there's some
[29:07] spirits that come back and when they do
[29:09] they come back with the attitude of well
[29:11] i want you to accept me i want you
[29:12] there's no opinion i want i want to res
[29:14] i want to go right back to a status
[29:16] first of all
[29:17] church worshiping god is not a status no
[29:20] you've got to come back and this
[29:21] is not even just for somebody that walks
[29:23] out this is for sometimes we
[29:26] as believers if we're not careful we
[29:27] backslide right in a pew
[29:29] and we've got to come right back to the
[29:31] very beginning we must be poor in spirit
[29:34] jesus said blessed are they happy are
[29:36] the poor
[29:37] happy are they that are of a broken
[29:39] heart happy are they that are humble
[29:42] this is not the american way
[29:44] this is not the worldly way to to come
[29:47] to a position where we have to
[29:48] understand that it's not about me
[29:50] it's we're dependent holy upon god
[29:53] what is he looking for he's looking for
[29:55] that humble heart
[29:56] it is not a man's confession listen to
[29:59] this
[30:00] that he is insignificant so it's not
[30:03] that you he wants you to come up here
[30:04] and say oh how horrible a person you are
[30:07] it's not that man's confession that he's
[30:09] insignificant or personally without
[30:11] value
[30:12] because that would not simply be true
[30:14] rather it is a confession that we
[30:17] by nature are sinful rebellious
[30:21] and in need of god's mercy and
[30:23] forgiveness
[30:24] we all have to come to that
[30:26] understanding that by nature
[30:28] we need a nature change because we are
[30:30] all
[30:31] by nature rebellious and sinners and we
[30:33] all have to come back
[30:35] to that ho to that that that position of
[30:38] being humble before god it is admitting
[30:41] that we are
[30:42] nothing without him now the practical if
[30:45] you would
[30:46] criteria for being poor in spirit is if
[30:49] i can just mention a few things and just
[30:50] trying to skip through here
[30:52] i apologize if i'm speaking too quickly
[30:54] i'll try to slow down if i can
[30:55] but a poor in spirit listen to this now
[30:59] is not thinking poorly of yourself it is
[31:02] thinking properly of yourself
[31:05] it is not that you think in a negative
[31:07] position to yourself it is not that you
[31:09] say oh i'm just a horrible
[31:11] and if that's what uh is being taught
[31:13] across
[31:14] america that is an incorrect teaching we
[31:16] are not to think poorly of ourself but
[31:19] properly that we need it is a proper
[31:22] thought process that i
[31:23] need god i cannot do anything without
[31:26] him
[31:27] i i can be a church member but i
[31:29] absolutely need
[31:30] god more than anything else i need him
[31:33] more than a friend i need him more than
[31:34] a spouse
[31:35] i need him more than education i need
[31:38] him more than a job
[31:39] i need him more than church membership i
[31:42] just need god
[31:44] now because if we if we're not careful
[31:46] satan likes to use this
[31:48] thinking improperly of ourselves and it
[31:50] turns into
[31:51] a false humility because false humility
[31:54] is just as
[31:55] bad as as the pride that breeds it
[31:58] because false humility is still pride
[32:01] because you're still
[32:02] focused on yourself let that sink in so
[32:05] i don't want to be focused on myself i
[32:07] don't want to be focused on
[32:08] all of the negative i want to be focused
[32:10] on what god can do
[32:12] when i come to the position of just
[32:14] being humble before the lord
[32:17] now poor in spirit is knowing yourself
[32:20] so you've got to know who you are you've
[32:21] got to know yourself
[32:22] accepting yourself and being yourself
[32:25] for the glory of god now it's not like
[32:27] it's not like uh in some aspects of
[32:30] religion to where
[32:32] you know you've got to accept me who i
[32:33] am and how i am and you've got to accept
[32:35] this attitude and you've got to accept
[32:37] these explosions
[32:38] and you've got to accept my you know my
[32:40] irish blood or my
[32:41] german blood i hope i'm not stepping on
[32:43] the media there but i don't know what
[32:44] blood i got but
[32:45] when it comes down to it i'm thinking
[32:47] for the blood of christ because it
[32:48] changes
[32:49] amen who i who i was but it's so it's
[32:52] it's it's coming to this realization
[32:54] that
[32:54] being in spirits knowing yourself
[32:56] accepting yourself and being yourself
[32:58] for the glory of god so i cannot be
[33:00] our brother here he cannot be me i
[33:02] cannot be you you cannot be me
[33:04] we we have to be accept what god has
[33:07] brought us to
[33:08] and accept that if we can be humble in
[33:10] spirit that there's so much god can do
[33:12] for us
[33:14] you are the vessel he chose
[33:17] and is desiring to use you if he brought
[33:20] you into this he's desiring to use you
[33:22] but before he can use you jesus says you
[33:24] gotta first be poor in spirit
[33:27] so so many are are either gaining pride
[33:30] in themselves
[33:31] so there's two sides of the spectrum
[33:33] here or overcome with self-doubt or
[33:36] false humility being poor in spirit does
[33:39] not mean you must be
[33:40] financially poor either or biblically
[33:43] illiterate
[33:46] didn't jesus tell the rich young ruler
[33:48] to go and sell everything and then come
[33:50] follow him right yes he did
[33:52] aren't riches among the thorns which
[33:53] choke the word of god keeping it from
[33:55] being fruitful in a person's life
[33:57] true again however money is not the
[33:59] problem
[34:01] the real issue is a heart condition you
[34:04] and i could be financially poor tonight
[34:07] and have nothing of value and still not
[34:11] be poor in spirit
[34:13] see as we'll see the heart of the popper
[34:16] may still be rich
[34:18] and full of self some may say that we
[34:21] need to be
[34:22] spiritually rich we need a wealth of
[34:24] biblical knowledge
[34:25] to make us mature in our faith
[34:29] i follow what i'm saying now but
[34:31] maturity is not dependent upon your
[34:33] biblical knowledge
[34:35] well there was a lot of people that had
[34:36] biblical knowledge that jesus walked
[34:38] before and they couldn't recognize who
[34:39] he was
[34:40] but again i'm not saying you to be
[34:42] illiterate
[34:44] study to show yourself approved right
[34:46] but again you cannot say oh bless god
[34:48] i've been in this message so long
[34:49] ain't nobody can outdo me well what kind
[34:51] of uh heart condition do you have
[34:55] so so we have to have an obedience to
[34:58] the word of god
[34:59] and when you have revelation now follow
[35:02] what i'm saying here
[35:03] it's all right to pray for revelation we
[35:05] need to you'll see brother branham said
[35:07] pray for revelation
[35:08] and then he also talked about time speed
[35:10] be careful praying for revelation
[35:12] why because satan might give you
[35:14] something
[35:16] and anything that's smarter than what
[35:17] you are if you get it it makes you feel
[35:19] like you
[35:20] revelated now
[35:24] all right moving on hurry up the poor
[35:27] and spirit have three common character
[35:29] traits
[35:30] because uh genuine spiritual poverty has
[35:33] these qualities brokenness
[35:36] humility and dependence
[35:39] so brokenness is that that one trait
[35:42] that we need
[35:43] brokenness is the beginning of change in
[35:45] our lives
[35:47] just because we're in church doesn't
[35:48] mean that we're broken
[35:50] and and i don't want to be broken
[35:52] because someone breaks me
[35:54] which i can't get ahead because it
[35:56] listen the beatitudes all tie together
[35:59] but these first three and four are so
[36:01] important they're all important so i'm
[36:02] not
[36:03] negating the rest we we believe we are
[36:06] strong
[36:06] but suddenly we understand how weak we
[36:09] really are
[36:10] our perceived strength also keeps us
[36:12] from seeing god for who he is
[36:14] the more we look into ourself the less
[36:16] we see of god
[36:18] until we are broken we see god in our
[36:20] image
[36:22] with the same limitations but once
[36:25] broken we can see god's omnipotent power
[36:28] until you think about that the lord is
[36:31] nigh unto them psalms 34 18 that are of
[36:33] a broken heart and save as such
[36:35] as be of a contrite spirit brother
[36:38] branham says in enticing spirit say god
[36:40] let me from this holy this day be holy
[36:43] thine
[36:44] lord i come with a broken heart i come
[36:47] with a contrite spirit
[36:49] i love you you know i love you
[36:52] oh i'm so glad he knows that we love him
[36:55] as the song says break me lord and bless
[36:58] the broken pieces the poor and spirit
[37:01] are humble what is humility
[37:03] the dictionary defines humility as a
[37:05] lack of vanity or self-importance but
[37:08] genuine humility is not
[37:09] self-abasement or degrading of itself
[37:12] when we put ourselves down as unworthy
[37:14] or incapable
[37:16] it's really still a type of pride
[37:19] why because pride because pride in any
[37:22] form focuses on self
[37:24] brothers and sisters let me just let me
[37:25] just stop here and give you a a clause
[37:27] tonight i'm not trying to be
[37:28] evangelistical i'm just going to teach
[37:30] if i can
[37:32] so let's just i say god help me all
[37:34] right
[37:36] so as we just passed down the the la one
[37:38] of the other things that we're saying is
[37:41] we must be dependent on god so as i go
[37:44] back real quick i've
[37:45] wanted to bring this out see now jesus
[37:47] did not
[37:48] put on a false humility saying i'm a
[37:51] nobody
[37:52] how many can say jesus was humble right
[37:55] well it says it uh philippians 2 6-8 who
[37:58] being in the form of god thought of not
[37:59] robbery to be equal with god
[38:02] but made himself of no reputation and
[38:05] took upon him the form of a servant
[38:08] and was made in the likeness of men and
[38:10] being found in fashion as a man
[38:12] he humbled himself and became obedient
[38:16] unto death even
[38:17] the death of the cross so jesus was
[38:20] humble but he didn't say
[38:21] i'm a nobody jesus knew his identity so
[38:24] you've got to know who you are
[38:26] and what god has for you without
[38:28] becoming arrogant this is the battle
[38:30] of the flesh right so
[38:34] we must be dependent upon god sometimes
[38:36] the most difficult words to say are i
[38:38] need help
[38:40] i can't make it alone we would rather
[38:43] say i can do it myself or
[38:44] i've earned it none of us like problems
[38:48] right
[38:49] or difficulties in our lives i would
[38:51] assume so
[38:52] we are much happier how many is happier
[38:54] tonight when everything just goes
[38:55] smoothly
[38:58] well just the traffic here is enough to
[39:00] say that's not happening
[39:04] i can tell you i'm not complaining about
[39:05] amarillo that's all i can say
[39:08] but we have to understand that we must
[39:11] come to a humility of spirit
[39:13] depend full dependence on god and we
[39:15] cannot have the spirit of laodicea in
[39:17] our life
[39:18] what was that spirit because thou sayest
[39:20] i am rich and increased with goods and
[39:22] have need of nothing and know us not
[39:23] that thou are wretched
[39:24] and miserable and poor and blind and
[39:26] naked we must be
[39:28] dependent upon him and him alone
[39:31] it's the first thing that jesus said
[39:34] blessed are the poor
[39:35] in spirit blessed are they that are
[39:38] humble that are broken
[39:39] they're a contrite spirit you know i'm
[39:42] not it's like a child sometimes a child
[39:44] when they get caught
[39:45] what do they do they cry because they
[39:47] were caught
[39:50] that didn't mean that they're actually
[39:52] broken just because you cry doesn't mean
[39:54] you're broken
[39:56] or that you are of a contrite spirit
[40:00] no we cry and i will get into this we i
[40:02] want to say god break my heart
[40:04] where i don't fall into this again
[40:06] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[40:08] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[40:10] blessed which steps right into the next
[40:13] one blessed are they
[40:14] that mourn for they shall be comforted
[40:17] that word mourn is to grieve
[40:19] as we see the progression of these
[40:21] thoughts we see how the first ties into
[40:23] the second because the first step
[40:25] of a blessed life is the recognition
[40:28] that we are poor in spirit
[40:30] that we have a deep need in our lives
[40:33] a need caused by our sin
[40:36] we learned that the first step is
[40:38] acknowledging that we are nothing
[40:39] without him and our desperate need for a
[40:41] savior brother branham says
[40:42] the holy ghost ought to be more
[40:44] important to you
[40:46] than everything else in this world
[40:49] your prestige your life your job your
[40:51] anything that there is
[40:52] you should not cease until you have it
[40:55] you
[40:55] must receive it it must be the mo and
[40:58] you say well i'm afraid they that
[41:00] i'm afraid that they at my work i'm
[41:02] afraid that my husband don't be afraid
[41:05] let that be the first place let
[41:06] everything else go let that be
[41:08] first well i expect to get it one of
[41:10] these days brother branham
[41:12] not one of these days now
[41:15] this is the time let it be first before
[41:18] i do anything else
[41:19] let me have it now he said desperate
[41:23] that would help answer our question when
[41:26] you get desperate for it really got to
[41:29] have it or
[41:30] die oh i say god tonight there we don't
[41:33] have to pray for years and years for the
[41:34] holy ghost
[41:35] if you want it with all of your heart
[41:37] it's a promise
[41:38] for everyone that's that desiring it
[41:41] it's promise it's just like healing
[41:42] healing you know there was not even even
[41:44] a there's not even
[41:46] a clause in healing the bible said by
[41:49] whose stripes that we are healed
[41:51] which we know that's talking of christ
[41:53] that there was no clause that you had
[41:54] clause that you have to be a believer to
[41:56] be healed
[41:59] and yet being healed sometimes in a
[42:00] message church if we're not careful
[42:02] becomes the hardest thing
[42:04] and a lot of times we only look at
[42:05] healing of the flesh like a
[42:07] you know don't get me wrong i'm thankful
[42:09] for these things but a lot of times what
[42:10] we need in in churches today
[42:13] is spiritual healing i mean healing of
[42:16] the mind healing of that soul
[42:18] breaking the chains oh but we've got to
[42:20] be desperate for it and recognize that
[42:22] it's in his word
[42:24] for you as a believer hallelujah
[42:29] so we then move to this next step and
[42:31] ble and i would like to read that verse
[42:33] four blessed are they that mourn for
[42:34] they shall be comforted and the
[42:35] amplified
[42:36] allow me to read it again blessed and
[42:38] enviably happy
[42:40] with the happiness produced by the
[42:42] experience of god's favor
[42:44] especially conditioned by the revelation
[42:46] of his matchless grace are they
[42:48] those who mourn for they shall be
[42:50] comforted
[42:52] happy are they that mourn you ever went
[42:55] to a party brother
[42:56] a birthday party and everyone was happy
[42:59] because they were mourning
[43:04] i don't really know how to say this but
[43:05] i thought it was pretty good when i was
[43:07] studying this before it says
[43:08] christostem i think is his name we made
[43:10] this statement says we may remark that
[43:12] this blessing is given
[43:14] not simply but with great force and
[43:17] emphasis
[43:18] it is not simply who have grief
[43:22] but who mourn and indeed this command is
[43:25] the sum of all philosophy for if they
[43:27] who mourn
[43:28] for the death of children or kinfolk
[43:32] throughout all that season of their
[43:34] sorrow are touched with no
[43:35] other desires let this sink in
[43:39] as of money or honor burn
[43:42] not with envy feel not wrongs
[43:45] nor are open to any other vicious
[43:48] passion
[43:48] but are solely given up to their grief
[43:52] much more ought they who mourn their own
[43:55] sins
[43:56] in such manner as they ought to mourn
[43:59] for them
[44:00] you take that person as he was uh
[44:03] explaining here
[44:04] when they are involved in that moment of
[44:06] grief because of that lost loved one
[44:08] that has just passed
[44:10] money is not in their mind this is not
[44:13] in their mind that's not in their mind
[44:14] but they are
[44:15] completely surrounded by that mourning
[44:18] or that grief moment how much more we as
[44:21] believers
[44:22] that that recognize what we have done
[44:25] is not against a church it's not against
[44:28] a pastor
[44:29] it's not against an evangelist but it's
[44:31] against a loving god
[44:34] happy are those that
[44:38] mourn they have mourned over their sin
[44:40] they've grieved over it
[44:43] think about it they have grieved over
[44:45] this moment brother brown says you see
[44:47] the trouble today we've got
[44:48] so much money and stuff on our mind that
[44:51] god can't have a place to get into our
[44:53] thinking
[44:55] and he said here in the beginning he
[44:57] said blessed are they
[44:59] that mourn i'm going to skip through a
[45:02] few things and i'm going to come to this
[45:04] position
[45:05] where it says there is the mourning
[45:07] caused by our own sin
[45:09] it is not only the sins now i do want to
[45:12] back up
[45:12] say this that we should mourn for the
[45:15] sins
[45:16] of our city we should never become so
[45:19] arrogant that it does not
[45:21] not just because we're better than they
[45:23] are
[45:25] that was also given to us in the
[45:26] scripture i'm glad i'm not like he is
[45:30] no there should be a mourning in our
[45:32] heart because
[45:34] of what is happening to our loving
[45:36] savior
[45:38] all right so as we move this we don't
[45:40] want it to just be that but it is not
[45:42] only the sins of others
[45:44] that should cause tears for we have our
[45:47] own sins to weep over as well
[45:49] our sins grieve god and therefore should
[45:52] grieve us
[45:52] as well none of us who are saved
[45:55] really want to sin none of us that are
[45:59] filled with the holy ghosts
[46:01] and have received a revelation of the
[46:02] hour really want to sin
[46:05] we really want to live pure lives before
[46:07] god can you say amen to that
[46:09] and before the world right we want to
[46:11] live a pure life
[46:12] not a holier than thou life but a life
[46:15] that is humble before
[46:17] before god and a humble before the world
[46:19] because we know
[46:20] of what the things the sins that god has
[46:22] pulled us from
[46:24] and the thing the grief that he has
[46:25] pulled us out of
[46:28] how much more we could say god do this
[46:29] for this individual and do this for them
[46:33] there's a song that a brother in my
[46:35] church thing and you'll probably know
[46:36] this and it's
[46:38] called feel the nails and an old song
[46:40] that
[46:41] been sung for years and it comes to the
[46:43] part i don't want to hurt you again
[46:46] what are you saying i never want to hurt
[46:48] you again
[46:50] you ever just love someone so much that
[46:52] you don't want to hurt them
[46:54] if you have a spouse you don't just
[46:58] lord help me here you don't just
[47:00] husbands you don't just go out there
[47:02] and and not do things that you shouldn't
[47:04] do just because you don't want to get
[47:05] caught
[47:07] but if you truly love them you don't do
[47:10] things out there the same with the
[47:11] spouse
[47:12] why because you don't want to hurt them
[47:14] you love them
[47:16] you see i don't come to church tonight
[47:17] just because i don't want the pastor to
[47:19] preach
[47:20] against me next sunday i don't get on my
[47:23] knees and pray because i don't want to
[47:24] hear about prayer life again
[47:28] i don't turn on a sermon just because
[47:30] you know i better do it because brother
[47:32] mcgarry said if i don't listen to a
[47:33] ceremony i'm going to go to hell i don't
[47:35] know if you said that or not but you
[47:36] just i'm just
[47:37] just let me be that way for a minute he
[47:38] can fix it
[47:40] let me just be jewish for a moment oh no
[47:44] we
[47:44] why why why do we do these things as
[47:47] believers
[47:49] because we love him
[47:52] you know when i was a kid i wanted to go
[47:54] to church and serve god because i didn't
[47:56] want to go to hell
[47:58] you know i heard do y'all steal every
[48:00] now and then hear a hellfire and
[48:01] brimstone sermon
[48:02] i'm sure you might every now and then it
[48:04] might be different but you we all hear
[48:06] them
[48:06] well that's all right that's okay
[48:09] we need to hear him every now and then
[48:12] but you see i don't wanna i don't wanna
[48:14] i don't wanna come to church just
[48:16] because i don't wanna go to hell
[48:18] you know i used to think how could it be
[48:20] said that if i end up in hell
[48:22] i would still love god how could it be
[48:24] said i used to think that
[48:26] until i met him
[48:30] oh then there was a revelation oh god i
[48:32] don't even deserve to be
[48:34] here i don't even deserve to lift my
[48:36] hands i don't deserve to sing i don't
[48:38] deserve to minister lord
[48:39] there's a humility he says god without
[48:41] you i'd be nothing
[48:42] and if i ended up there lord i would
[48:44] still sir i'd still love you with all of
[48:47] my heart
[48:48] but it takes revelation and not just a
[48:51] mental revelation there's got to be a
[48:53] heart change
[48:55] i don't want to hurt you lord but what
[48:57] do we do as humans we try and we fail
[49:00] now i know there's some of you that have
[49:01] reached perfection and i'm sorry so you
[49:02] can just skip through this for a moment
[49:07] what makes us behave the way we do we
[49:10] don't want to get irritable
[49:12] at least i hope you don't but we do
[49:16] no don't be looking at your spouses now
[49:19] we want to control our temper but
[49:21] sometimes we fail
[49:24] we don't want to speak unkind words but
[49:27] sometimes it just seemed to come out of
[49:28] us
[49:30] why does there seem to be such a war in
[49:32] us even paul was grieved with himself
[49:35] o wretched man that i am who shall
[49:38] deliver me from the body of this
[49:40] death romans 7 24 his desire to do good
[49:44] he found himself struggling
[49:46] with that opposite side again i
[49:49] understand
[49:50] you know that some of you all have
[49:51] reached and attained some things so
[49:53] just pray for me that i can reach your
[49:55] level
[49:57] the man or woman who can no longer
[50:00] grieve over
[50:00] sin is in a serious condition
[50:05] the person whose heart is broken because
[50:07] of sin
[50:08] is ready to be comforted but that
[50:12] one that cannot be broken
[50:15] the by what does he say blessed are they
[50:17] that mourn for they shall be comforted
[50:20] but if you're not broken over your sin
[50:22] he cannot comfort you
[50:24] this is not my words this is not the
[50:25] words of your pastor this is not even
[50:27] let me just say it's not even the words
[50:29] of of brother branham this is the words
[50:31] of jesus
[50:33] all right you follow what i'm saying
[50:37] second corinthians 7 10 for godly sorrow
[50:40] worketh repentance
[50:42] to salvation not to be repented of but
[50:45] the sorrow of the world
[50:46] worketh death i don't want to just be
[50:49] sorry because i'm caught
[50:52] i want to be sorry because i don't want
[50:53] to hurt him again so you see the
[50:55] progression here we
[50:56] we we come to this position where we are
[50:58] poor in spirit we're broken for it
[51:01] and then we move into this position and
[51:03] not not only are we broken for but now
[51:05] we're we're grievous of our sins we
[51:08] don't want to go back to that position
[51:10] and when we step into that realm
[51:12] then we can be comforted listen you if
[51:14] you're looking to be comforted from the
[51:16] from the pastor or comforted from your
[51:18] spouse or comforted from
[51:19] the church that's not always going to
[51:21] happen
[51:22] because we're looking for comfort in
[51:24] flesh and flesh will fail
[51:27] i don't care how much holy ghost we got
[51:29] in one another
[51:30] and god we we as a bouquet we are there
[51:33] to encourage one another don't get me
[51:34] wrong that's not what i'm saying
[51:36] but we've got what happened to faith
[51:38] what happened to knowing that god is
[51:40] there in that moment because you're
[51:42] broken in your contract
[51:44] this is true for the believer who sins
[51:46] he sins and is guilty
[51:49] he feels cast down and remorseful he
[51:51] mourns over his sin
[51:52] and this drives him back to jesus in
[51:55] repentance
[51:56] peace returns joy is restored how many
[51:59] is thankful
[52:00] how many remembers that time when you
[52:02] found yourself in that
[52:03] and then god began to deal with your
[52:05] heart and god began to break your heart
[52:07] and you begin to become remorseful oh i
[52:09] don't want to do this and what began to
[52:11] happen
[52:12] he began to give you that peace again
[52:14] that joy began to be restored
[52:16] because you were drove to repentance
[52:19] his spirit is revived and he is
[52:21] comforted david knew how to get back
[52:23] with god didn't he
[52:25] he was a repentant of man mourned over
[52:28] his sin
[52:29] psalm 69 29 says but i am poor and
[52:33] sorrowful
[52:34] let thy salvational god set me upon high
[52:37] i will praise the name of god with the
[52:39] song and will magnify him with
[52:40] thanksgiving
[52:42] this also shall please the lord better
[52:44] than an ox or bullock that hath horns
[52:46] and hooves
[52:47] the humble shall seek this and be glad
[52:51] and your heart shall live that seek god
[52:55] jesus said blessed are those that mourn
[52:57] for they shall be comforted
[52:59] the reason those who mourn are blessed
[53:01] is because
[53:02] of the comfort that's available our
[53:05] grief and our sorrow drives us to the
[53:07] source of all comfort
[53:08] our lord himself who gives us the
[53:10] comforting presence
[53:12] of the holy spirit you come to the
[53:13] position tonight where you say i'm sorry
[53:15] for my sin
[53:17] i'm sorry for what i've done i'm sorry
[53:20] lord
[53:20] i don't want to let you down when was
[53:23] the last time that we really said that
[53:24] god i don't want to let you down i know
[53:27] you don't want to let your spouse down
[53:28] you want to let the church down
[53:29] but god i don't want to let you down i
[53:31] don't want to fall into that position
[53:33] anymore
[53:33] i want to serve you with all of my heart
[53:35] i want to give everything to you
[53:37] i'm thankful for this message but listen
[53:40] you've got to have a life that is
[53:42] repentant
[53:44] and humble and broken blessed
[53:47] are the meek for they shall
[53:51] inherit the earth are we okay on time
[53:55] i've lost track of it so i'm already
[53:57] lost
[53:59] when y'all shut me down i'll shut trust
[54:00] me i'll hear it i'll feel it
[54:02] we know ministers know this don't we
[54:04] brother matthew
[54:06] this again is this my water
[54:10] it is now
[54:13] this again is is a full on continuous
[54:17] growth
[54:18] in relationship blessed are the meek
[54:22] this is a continual growth between god
[54:25] and man
[54:26] and it cannot be done without the first
[54:29] it's got to be a growth a process
[54:32] poor in spirit and mourn and that word
[54:36] meek
[54:36] to be mild or humble are you getting the
[54:38] drift that these all tie together
[54:41] they literally almost have the same
[54:42] meanings
[54:44] now this is something that we want to
[54:46] take in consideration can you truly be
[54:48] meek
[54:49] and happy at the same time can you
[54:52] picture a meek person who is a happy
[54:54] person the world can't
[54:57] you probably find it rather challenging
[54:58] because the world what the world thinks
[55:00] as meekness is weakness
[55:04] our misunderstanding of meekness creates
[55:06] this diffic
[55:07] difficulty in a world that thinks only
[55:09] an aggressive hard-working person can
[55:11] get ahead in life
[55:13] it is hard to believe that those who are
[55:15] meek will inherit anything
[55:18] much less the earth let that sink in
[55:22] he did not imply that being fearful or
[55:25] weak
[55:26] brings happiness instead jesus referred
[55:29] to attitude or
[55:31] outlook the meekness he described
[55:34] requires us to be strong
[55:36] people who are grounded in christ
[55:39] it demands us to have a personal
[55:41] relationship with god
[55:42] this kind of meekness inevitably brings
[55:45] happiness
[55:46] meekness is the way to happiness for
[55:49] several reasons
[55:50] now one of the definitions of that
[55:52] meekness the thayer's definition is
[55:54] mildness of character
[55:56] gentleness of spirit and also meekness
[55:59] meekness towards god is that disposition
[56:01] of spirit in which we accept his
[56:02] dealings with us as good
[56:05] and therefore without disputing or
[56:07] resisting
[56:08] well that's difficult in our humanity
[56:12] the meek know that god is in control
[56:17] and his word cannot fail thus they trust
[56:20] in him
[56:21] isaiah 41 17 when the poor and needy
[56:25] seek water and there is none and their
[56:27] tongue filleth for thirst i
[56:29] the lord will hear them i the god of
[56:31] israel will not forsake them
[56:35] but how hard is it to trust in that
[56:37] moment
[56:38] when you're in the moment see gentleness
[56:42] or meekness
[56:43] is the opposite to self-assertiveness
[56:47] and self-interest it stems from
[56:50] trust in god's goodness and control over
[56:53] the situation now this is so important
[56:56] meekness maintains an
[56:59] even temperament
[57:03] i'm just going to stop right there and
[57:06] say lord help me
[57:08] again i'm going to eventually attain
[57:10] your
[57:11] perfectness but i say lord i want to
[57:14] maintain that's why
[57:16] we die daily we crucify this fleck this
[57:18] flesh
[57:20] now you know i'm messing with you
[57:21] because i know you're all human out
[57:22] there y'all get the halos down for a few
[57:24] moments
[57:26] thank you i'm going to by the grace of
[57:28] god
[57:30] aristotle defined meekness as the mean
[57:33] between two extremes
[57:36] intense anger and excessive indifference
[57:40] it is the happy medium between too much
[57:43] anger
[57:43] and too little passion william barclay
[57:47] suggested that the beatitude
[57:49] be translated blessed it is a man who is
[57:51] always angry at the right time
[57:53] and never angry at the wrong time
[57:56] but how can we develop this even
[58:00] temperament let me just tell you one way
[58:01] it don't work
[58:03] you're not going to wake up tomorrow and
[58:04] say bless god today i'm going to be meek
[58:10] i'm sorry to burst your bubble but that
[58:12] just doesn't work that way
[58:14] it takes the holy spirit
[58:18] and it takes you coming to being poor in
[58:20] spirit
[58:23] right it's this process to get to
[58:25] meekness
[58:27] so and not none of this righteous
[58:30] indignation
[58:31] boy that's used a lot in this message
[58:35] maybe i should step off of that for a
[58:37] moment
[58:38] how can we avoid the extremes of severe
[58:42] anger or apathy
[58:44] we can't but god can do it for us
[58:48] what we cannot do for ourselves god can
[58:50] do for us we
[58:51] and now listen i'm not just going to sit
[58:53] back and say god you just do it for me
[58:55] no we step into his will we step into
[58:57] his plan we
[58:58] we say lord i'm open jesus be jesus and
[59:01] me
[59:02] no longer me but thee
[59:05] right so we do this through salvation
[59:07] and through the baptism of the holy
[59:09] ghost through being born again
[59:10] this is a work in our lives that god can
[59:13] begin to work and to deal with you
[59:16] and knowing with the right time to be
[59:18] balanced in situations where meekness
[59:21] must take
[59:22] must take root and it's important and it
[59:24] comes with the holy spirit but the fruit
[59:26] of the spirit is love joy peace
[59:28] long suffering gentleness goodness faith
[59:30] meekness
[59:31] temperance against such there is no law
[59:33] notice now
[59:34] look even look at the disciples the
[59:36] difference in the disciples
[59:38] before pentecost after they were not
[59:40] perfect but you could see a full change
[59:42] in attitude
[59:44] a full change in attitude from peter
[59:46] from one moment cutting the air off of a
[59:48] soldier to the next moment
[59:49] silver and gold have a number such as i
[59:51] have give i thee what was the change
[59:54] the holy ghost did he not have
[59:57] revelation of something before the holy
[59:59] ghost
[1:00:01] oh hello folks we had a revelation he
[1:00:04] had an understanding of who god was
[1:00:07] but even with the revelation of who god
[1:00:09] was he still denied him
[1:00:12] you got to be born again
[1:00:18] think about the character of meekness by
[1:00:20] explanation if we could
[1:00:22] it is not weakness as many suppose
[1:00:25] but it is a mild character it is a
[1:00:28] gentle
[1:00:29] spirit now we know we as church folks
[1:00:31] have a have
[1:00:32] have a really easy time of sitting in
[1:00:34] the church and all of a sudden we begin
[1:00:36] to think of people
[1:00:37] yeah he's really talking about that one
[1:00:42] i don't know if i was just feeling that
[1:00:43] as it was jumping across
[1:00:45] or just reminding you let's just focus
[1:00:47] on what god is dealing with ourselves
[1:00:50] all right mild character gentle spirit
[1:00:54] it is the opposite as we just said of
[1:00:56] self-assertiveness or self-interest
[1:00:59] now by illustration the positive side
[1:01:02] let's think about this
[1:01:03] it is a soothing medicine
[1:01:07] meekness it sues or i cannot say it is
[1:01:10] like a soothing medicine
[1:01:12] it's that medicine is there to to soothe
[1:01:15] uh if you would that that fever or
[1:01:18] uh to calm the you know the body during
[1:01:21] sickness
[1:01:23] the negative side of it is an overdose
[1:01:26] of that same medicine
[1:01:27] can kill you all right
[1:01:31] a gentle breeze it's refreshing on a hot
[1:01:34] day
[1:01:35] especially today refreshing but
[1:01:39] a raging wind what does it do damages
[1:01:44] the rain something that can clear the
[1:01:47] air and
[1:01:48] brings forth life right but too much
[1:01:51] rain destroys
[1:01:52] any roads and soil and washes away life
[1:01:57] so how does this apply meekness is
[1:01:59] essentially
[1:02:01] power under control
[1:02:04] it is power that god gives his people
[1:02:09] which is now under control because if
[1:02:11] you use medicine in the right
[1:02:13] you know you follow what i'm saying you
[1:02:15] use medicine in the right frame it is
[1:02:16] there to help and
[1:02:17] it soothes right how many thankful well
[1:02:20] y'all might not be
[1:02:21] i'm thankful in the panhandle for rain
[1:02:26] i i'm thankful for rain but too much of
[1:02:29] it is a bad thing
[1:02:31] so we need to find the balance it again
[1:02:34] is the character of spirit in which we
[1:02:36] accept god's dealings with us as
[1:02:38] good and therefore without disputing or
[1:02:41] resisting it is the inner voice that
[1:02:43] tells the self
[1:02:45] that god knows what he's doing so just
[1:02:47] calm down
[1:02:49] and do not get bent out of shape or get
[1:02:52] out of control
[1:02:53] or lose your temper okay keep your
[1:02:56] thoughts to yourself again
[1:03:01] another thing meekness does is it
[1:03:03] develops self-control
[1:03:05] often it was used to express the idea of
[1:03:08] self-control for instance an animal that
[1:03:09] otherwise would have been wild
[1:03:11] but had been made a house pet was then
[1:03:13] called meek
[1:03:15] the animal had learned to respond
[1:03:17] favorably to commands
[1:03:19] and behaved properly in other words the
[1:03:22] beatitude
[1:03:23] could be translated blessed are they who
[1:03:25] are entirely self-controlled
[1:03:30] now it only comes through god
[1:03:33] that's what i'm trying to say it comes
[1:03:34] through him weakness is giving
[1:03:37] in to the worst that is in you
[1:03:40] but meekness is the mastery over it
[1:03:44] to be meek does not mean that you are
[1:03:46] cowardly but it does mean that you're
[1:03:48] strong enough not to retaliate when
[1:03:50] wrongly treated
[1:03:52] though having their rights those who are
[1:03:54] meek do not insist on them
[1:03:58] possessing great ability those who are
[1:04:00] meek do not flaunt it
[1:04:02] they would rather forgive than accuse
[1:04:06] self-self such self-control results in
[1:04:09] peace
[1:04:10] with oneself now i'm not here to try to
[1:04:13] preach to you some yoga mentality
[1:04:16] that's not what this is about but you do
[1:04:19] have to have
[1:04:20] confidence and trust in god
[1:04:23] you have to be at peace with whatever
[1:04:26] god has placed for you in your life
[1:04:28] and there's going to be circumstances
[1:04:29] and situations that's going to come your
[1:04:31] way listen god does not wake up in the
[1:04:32] morning
[1:04:34] i did not expect that to happen to you
[1:04:36] no he knows
[1:04:38] everything he was not surprised the
[1:04:41] moment
[1:04:41] that you gave your life to him
[1:04:44] like some of us are surprised at other
[1:04:47] people
[1:04:47] god was never surprised
[1:04:54] so he knows everything before the
[1:04:56] foundation of the world your name was in
[1:04:58] his mind
[1:05:00] and we have to be at peace that whatever
[1:05:02] circumstance comes my way whatever storm
[1:05:05] comes my way
[1:05:06] god has a way through it
[1:05:10] so those who cannot control their anger
[1:05:13] greed lust tongue or ambition will
[1:05:16] never be at peace within they will
[1:05:19] constantly be at war with themselves
[1:05:23] constantly searching
[1:05:26] how many has ever been there before i'm
[1:05:29] going to be honest i've been there
[1:05:31] what i i wasn't i wasn't that at peace
[1:05:35] i wasn't at peace with what god had for
[1:05:37] me i wasn't at peace with the
[1:05:38] circumstances
[1:05:39] i wanted to be like this one i wanted it
[1:05:41] to go this way why can't i be this why
[1:05:42] can't i have this guy to church why
[1:05:44] can't
[1:05:44] and we just begin searching and looking
[1:05:47] and then we cannot control
[1:05:50] we've got to have meekness think about
[1:05:53] this
[1:05:54] once moses met the burning bush he did
[1:05:57] not try to deliver israel his own way
[1:05:59] from that point on
[1:06:00] he trusted in god before he was a
[1:06:03] murderer
[1:06:04] after he pleaded for life
[1:06:08] you know the story
[1:06:11] what is it what does the bible say about
[1:06:13] moses numbers 12 3 now the man moses was
[1:06:16] very meek
[1:06:17] above all the men which were upon the
[1:06:19] face of the earth
[1:06:21] i mean a guy that killed somebody
[1:06:24] that was before the burning bush
[1:06:29] brother branham says take a person walk
[1:06:31] up big what they can do
[1:06:33] and all this thing don't you ever pay
[1:06:35] attention to that
[1:06:37] god's spirit is a meek spirit humble
[1:06:40] spirit
[1:06:41] full of love and compassion looking to
[1:06:43] all people
[1:06:44] and bringing all people to a knowledge
[1:06:46] of christ let's not lose sight
[1:06:48] while we're still here we're still here
[1:06:50] for souls and that includes souls that
[1:06:52] are in the church
[1:06:54] hey let's not be so please understand
[1:06:56] what i'm trying to say in a balance here
[1:06:58] let's not be so as it were looking
[1:07:01] outside of the church and forget what we
[1:07:03] have here
[1:07:04] to pray for one another and encourage
[1:07:06] one another and have that meekness and
[1:07:08] humility
[1:07:09] and in this meekness the bible says we
[1:07:11] are assured of a victory what does it
[1:07:12] say you shall inherit
[1:07:14] the earth right psalms 37 9-11 for evil
[1:07:18] doers shall be cut off but those that
[1:07:20] wait upon the lord shall inherit the
[1:07:21] earth
[1:07:22] for yet a little while and the wicked
[1:07:23] shall not be yea thou shalt diligently
[1:07:26] consider his place and it shall not be
[1:07:28] but the meek
[1:07:29] shall inherit the earth and shall
[1:07:31] delight themselves in the abundance of
[1:07:33] peace
[1:07:34] psalms 22 26 says the meek shall eat and
[1:07:37] be satisfied
[1:07:39] they shall praise the lord that seek him
[1:07:42] and your heart shall live forever
[1:07:46] think about this now it is significant
[1:07:48] that jesus said the meek shall
[1:07:51] inherit and not capture
[1:07:55] the earth for an inheritor is a receiver
[1:07:59] not an aggressor god in his providence
[1:08:02] has
[1:08:03] structured the world so that the meek
[1:08:06] are
[1:08:06] certain to inherit it meekness is so
[1:08:09] hard to and
[1:08:10] listen you cannot just naturally develop
[1:08:14] a godly meekness i cannot tell myself to
[1:08:18] be meek
[1:08:18] because i guarantee you as soon as i
[1:08:20] tell myself to be meek satan heard it
[1:08:26] but god never intended on you to do it
[1:08:28] yourself
[1:08:30] he intended on you to have confidence in
[1:08:32] him that his holy spirit would help you
[1:08:34] through those times
[1:08:36] how many is thankful for that because by
[1:08:39] nature most people are aggressors
[1:08:42] we need a transformation meekness is
[1:08:44] knowing god knows this pain
[1:08:46] you are going through and is part of a
[1:08:47] greater plan trusting god
[1:08:49] through the trial as job though he slay
[1:08:52] me i will trust him
[1:08:54] that's having meekness in your life
[1:08:55] knowing that i don't know
[1:08:57] you know i'm not even asking to bring it
[1:08:59] on you don't even don't ask for trouble
[1:09:01] in trials
[1:09:03] because folks as long as you're
[1:09:04] breathing you're going to have them
[1:09:08] but a meek person has submitted to the
[1:09:10] lord's sovereignty
[1:09:12] and authority in his life and is full
[1:09:14] trusting him to take care of him in
[1:09:16] every situation that may come up
[1:09:18] and he is willing to give up his rights
[1:09:20] and privileges to stay
[1:09:22] under god's authority that's the
[1:09:24] attitude of a meek
[1:09:25] person i want to quickly get through
[1:09:27] this last one if you don't mind
[1:09:29] hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:09:32] bless because this
[1:09:33] i believe is very important
[1:09:36] of following we again understand the
[1:09:39] continuing growth of the believer
[1:09:41] blessed are they
[1:09:42] who hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:09:45] it is again
[1:09:46] quite odd to see jesus saying happy
[1:09:50] is the individual who's hungry and
[1:09:53] thirsty
[1:09:55] because we were made to be hungry and
[1:09:58] thirsty
[1:09:59] it is a natural desire some of you our
[1:10:01] stomachs are probably growling right now
[1:10:06] trying to see if you guys were like yeah
[1:10:07] you're right
[1:10:09] it's this it's a natural desire to be
[1:10:11] thirsty and hungry
[1:10:13] so jesus again uses this common pain
[1:10:16] to illustrate the desire for
[1:10:18] righteousness
[1:10:19] that word hunger comes through the
[1:10:21] meaning through the idea of a pinching
[1:10:24] toil
[1:10:24] a yearning to famish and to crave
[1:10:28] that thirst suffer thirst and
[1:10:30] dehydration and righteousness
[1:10:32] equity or fairness of character right
[1:10:34] standing with god
[1:10:36] look at this for a few moments the word
[1:10:38] hunger and thirst here
[1:10:40] now some of you i pray that you forgive
[1:10:43] me if i don't get this exact correct but
[1:10:44] just bear with me in my folly
[1:10:46] are in what is called the imperfect
[1:10:49] tense
[1:10:50] which means that it is continuous action
[1:10:53] in other words you must always be
[1:10:56] hungering
[1:10:57] and thirsting for righteousness to be in
[1:11:00] right relationship with god
[1:11:02] it is like saying you eat today and are
[1:11:04] satisfied
[1:11:05] but tomorrow you are hungry again even
[1:11:08] the expression of the word righteousness
[1:11:10] in the original language
[1:11:12] has great meaning in the greek grammar
[1:11:14] there is this thing called the genitive
[1:11:16] case
[1:11:16] and the accusative case the genitive
[1:11:19] case is expressed by the word
[1:11:21] of such as when we say i would like a
[1:11:24] slice
[1:11:25] of bread of bread
[1:11:28] is the genitive case which means we
[1:11:31] don't want the whole loaf
[1:11:33] we only want a part of the loaf a slice
[1:11:37] or if we ask for a glass of water you
[1:11:39] know that i don't want the whole picture
[1:11:42] or the whole well i just want a glass
[1:11:46] but in the accusative case it means just
[1:11:48] the opposite
[1:11:49] it means that the person wants the whole
[1:11:52] loaf
[1:11:53] and all of the water in the picture so
[1:11:56] when jesus said blessed are they
[1:11:58] who hunger and thirst after
[1:11:59] righteousness guess what the word
[1:12:01] righteousness was in
[1:12:03] in the accusative in other words jesus
[1:12:06] is saying blessed is the person who is
[1:12:08] always hungry
[1:12:09] and always thirsting to be in a right
[1:12:12] relationship with god
[1:12:13] in every area of our life i don't want
[1:12:16] just part of the loaf
[1:12:17] i want the whole loaf i don't want just
[1:12:19] a sip tonight
[1:12:20] god i want you to just just give me all
[1:12:22] that you have and this is a
[1:12:24] constant relationship a constant craving
[1:12:27] and yearning
[1:12:28] now you say i thought we were never to
[1:12:29] thirst again we're not to the thirst for
[1:12:31] the world again
[1:12:32] we're not to thirst for those things out
[1:12:34] there anymore but we're hungering and
[1:12:36] thirsting for righteousness and this is
[1:12:38] a continual relationship
[1:12:40] that jesus was saying when this occurs
[1:12:43] it does not mean that we're just like
[1:12:45] fatten like filling of an animal but we
[1:12:47] are continually
[1:12:49] satisfied oh i'm hey
[1:12:52] if you're just getting filled or
[1:12:53] something to eat at church
[1:12:55] you're in the wrong frame of mind but it
[1:12:58] is a daily relationship
[1:13:00] i don't want to just be hungering and
[1:13:02] thirsting just because it's sunday
[1:13:03] morning service
[1:13:05] no but this is a daily hungering and
[1:13:07] thirsting
[1:13:08] for righteousness for a closer walk with
[1:13:11] god for more of him
[1:13:13] why because again it starts being poor
[1:13:15] in spirit breaking that spirit breaking
[1:13:17] that flesh
[1:13:18] breaking those mentalities breaking
[1:13:20] those spirits and then coming and once
[1:13:22] all of that is clear and out of the way
[1:13:24] something begins to move and to churn in
[1:13:26] your life where you're saying
[1:13:28] god i don't know why i'm just craving
[1:13:30] more of you i can't wait to listen to
[1:13:32] another sermon
[1:13:33] i can't wait to put on another message i
[1:13:35] can't wait to hear the next sermon at
[1:13:37] church
[1:13:38] i can't wait to get through those doors
[1:13:40] i don't even care who's preaching lord
[1:13:42] i just want to hear your word it doesn't
[1:13:44] matter who's singing lord i just want to
[1:13:46] worship you lord
[1:13:47] why because you're a daily constantly
[1:13:50] asking for more of god continual
[1:13:53] satisfaction before brother branham says
[1:13:55] before there is a creation there has to
[1:13:56] be a creator
[1:13:58] blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:14:00] thirst after righteousness see
[1:14:01] there is something in us he he's talking
[1:14:05] to a people group of people
[1:14:06] as he asked them to raise their hands he
[1:14:08] said you raised your hand a while ago
[1:14:09] i want more of god see there is
[1:14:11] something there
[1:14:13] in you how many remembers deep calling
[1:14:15] to the deep
[1:14:16] there's something inside of you and what
[1:14:18] you know there's got to be something to
[1:14:19] respond to that
[1:14:20] listen i'm not just here for religion
[1:14:23] oh i'm not just here to have a moment of
[1:14:25] shout i say god let me live a life
[1:14:28] that is so close to you that when i walk
[1:14:30] around someone lord they'll feel that
[1:14:32] presence of humility
[1:14:34] and they'll say i want some more of that
[1:14:37] hallelujah
[1:14:40] i don't know how maybe you've ever been
[1:14:43] to like a theme park or
[1:14:45] or whatever you go to or somewhere i've
[1:14:47] even been to places to where
[1:14:48] did you ever heard where actual
[1:14:50] restaurants will
[1:14:52] send out the smell of food and they'll
[1:14:54] do that at theme parks they'll kind of
[1:14:56] it's like
[1:14:57] shoot it out and you're walking by and
[1:14:59] you're just like
[1:15:01] i wasn't hungry but i am now
[1:15:07] something caught your attention it
[1:15:08] caught that oh god let me have
[1:15:10] such an anointing in my life that i'll
[1:15:13] be walking at walmart and
[1:15:15] and some i walk right by somebody and it
[1:15:17] could be that one
[1:15:19] and just the presence that is you lord
[1:15:21] the humility as i walk by
[1:15:23] they might not have known what they were
[1:15:24] fixing to come in contact with
[1:15:26] i said lord let me have that spirit upon
[1:15:29] me
[1:15:30] amen because i want more of him think
[1:15:32] about the tree
[1:15:34] that is alive what does it do it takes
[1:15:36] in the water right
[1:15:37] the plants that are alive take in the
[1:15:40] water
[1:15:40] you know you don't have to tell it to do
[1:15:43] it
[1:15:44] you ever planted a a a tree or a flower
[1:15:48] how many has ever done that planted
[1:15:49] something all right so we're about 50 50
[1:15:52] here
[1:15:56] and trust me i'm not a green thumb
[1:15:57] either or whatever you call it
[1:15:59] oh i planted it there it is grow
[1:16:03] grow drink water
[1:16:07] do you ever do that no
[1:16:10] why because you know that there's a
[1:16:13] nature in there
[1:16:14] that if you plant it and if it's alive
[1:16:16] without being told it just begins to
[1:16:18] drink it up
[1:16:21] baby that is born when it first comes
[1:16:23] out and it's been whooped and
[1:16:26] whatever you don't have to force it
[1:16:29] it cries and what does it do it begins
[1:16:31] to cry for food right
[1:16:34] it's in the nature you don't have to be
[1:16:36] told you don't have to teach a baby to
[1:16:38] desire food it comes from the womb
[1:16:40] with life desiring to eat that plant
[1:16:43] with life that already desires to draw
[1:16:45] it up
[1:16:46] why are we trying to force people to
[1:16:49] drink in church
[1:16:51] listen it ain't going to happen i've
[1:16:54] done come to that position that i'm not
[1:16:56] going to do it i'm just going to let the
[1:16:57] lord
[1:16:59] let the rain fall in the church and if
[1:17:01] you're alive you'll drink it
[1:17:04] and if you're dead i'll pray that god
[1:17:05] revive you
[1:17:08] why fret let god do it
[1:17:11] why as the heart planted panteth after
[1:17:14] the water broke soul panteth my
[1:17:16] soul after thee oh god my soul thirsteth
[1:17:19] for god hey listen
[1:17:20] when you are when you come into this
[1:17:22] life every human in this
[1:17:24] in this world has one spot that can only
[1:17:26] be filled by god
[1:17:28] and they try to fill it with drugs they
[1:17:30] try to fill it with alcohol they try to
[1:17:31] fill it with pornography
[1:17:32] they try to fill it with religion
[1:17:35] you know we we kind of deal with a lot
[1:17:37] of those things out there but a lot of
[1:17:38] times we need to come back to our
[1:17:40] position and realize that we can't even
[1:17:41] fill it with religion
[1:17:43] hello folks we gotta we gotta understand
[1:17:45] we gotta come back to that position we
[1:17:46] can only fill it with the baptism of the
[1:17:48] holy spirit
[1:17:50] and say god i need more of you my soul
[1:17:52] thirsteth for god it's no longer
[1:17:54] thirsting for the world it's not
[1:17:55] thirsting for religion it's thirsting
[1:17:57] for god
[1:17:58] and guess what brother mcgarry didn't
[1:17:59] have to make me do it
[1:18:02] hallelujah when god began to deal with
[1:18:04] you the pastor didn't make you drink it
[1:18:06] something just started soaking it up
[1:18:09] hallelujah you could have been
[1:18:10] it could have been on a bar stool but as
[1:18:12] soon as something struck your heart
[1:18:14] you begin to soak it up and it brought
[1:18:16] you right to the word of god
[1:18:18] and it began to transform your life and
[1:18:20] change your life and guess what you're
[1:18:22] still soaking it up hallelujah
[1:18:27] man i gotta hurry my goodness is good
[1:18:29] preaching even on a wednesday night
[1:18:32] i'm hurrying i already told him i said
[1:18:34] i'm a worker i understand i'm on
[1:18:36] vacation i'm gonna try to treat this
[1:18:37] like i'm going to work just like you
[1:18:38] tomorrow okay
[1:18:40] we need to desire the sustainable word
[1:18:43] of this hour and not the religious junk
[1:18:46] food
[1:18:47] or worldly cravings everything outside
[1:18:49] of this word is nothing more than cotton
[1:18:52] candy
[1:18:54] i mean he's never had cotton candy
[1:18:55] before boy it's all out there and it's
[1:18:57] all poofy and everything looks good and
[1:18:58] as soon as you put your mouth it's like
[1:19:03] i paid 10 bucks for that
[1:19:07] and it gave you no sustenance there was
[1:19:08] no protein in it probably you're walking
[1:19:10] out with your eyes crossed because you
[1:19:12] had so much sugar
[1:19:14] and it did no good for you oh it might
[1:19:16] have tasted good the bible says
[1:19:17] enjoying sin for a season
[1:19:21] everything outside of this word is
[1:19:23] nothing more than just cotton candy what
[1:19:25] looks good
[1:19:26] and it might taste good for a moment but
[1:19:27] it has no substance in it
[1:19:29] i said god give me that protein of the
[1:19:31] word tonight let me sing my teeth in it
[1:19:36] the bride craves more than a pleasure
[1:19:38] for a season but sustainable power
[1:19:40] to be in right standing with god may
[1:19:43] mean you are not with man
[1:19:47] and jesus lays this challenge from
[1:19:49] humility
[1:19:50] to an ardent crave for right standing
[1:19:53] with god
[1:19:55] but we also must watch that
[1:19:57] self-righteous spirit
[1:19:59] lord i don't want to become
[1:20:01] self-righteous the pharisees were
[1:20:02] devoted to the quest
[1:20:04] for righteousness but they ended up in a
[1:20:06] distorted pursuit of self-righteousness
[1:20:10] it can be easy to dismiss the pursuit of
[1:20:12] righteousness as easy
[1:20:13] always ending up in an inflated
[1:20:16] self-righteous
[1:20:17] spirit brother branham says now watch
[1:20:19] righteousness we're coming to a close
[1:20:21] now we have self-righteousness we have
[1:20:23] make-believe righteousness we have
[1:20:24] perverted righteousness all kinds
[1:20:26] but there's one real righteousness and
[1:20:29] that righteousness comes from god
[1:20:30] and this man was the king of
[1:20:32] righteousness who could he be
[1:20:34] now he was the king of righteousness the
[1:20:36] king of jerusalem the king of
[1:20:38] righteousness the king of peace
[1:20:40] he uh so let let this sink in as we
[1:20:43] come down to the end of this he said he
[1:20:44] didn't say now this is not brother
[1:20:46] brandon i'm bringing this other portion
[1:20:48] out
[1:20:48] he didn't say blessed are those whose
[1:20:50] goal is righteousness
[1:20:52] for they shall attain their goal nor did
[1:20:54] he say blessed are those who have the
[1:20:56] desire
[1:20:57] for righteousness for they will get
[1:20:58] their hearts desire
[1:21:00] rather he spoke in everyday terms
[1:21:02] regarding intense hunger
[1:21:05] i must be hungry and thirsty
[1:21:08] for god have you ever heard the
[1:21:11] statement in the sports world
[1:21:12] they're hungry how many's ever heard
[1:21:14] that boy they're really hungry
[1:21:16] you take an athlete who is well paid
[1:21:20] right you know before they got that
[1:21:22] check if you would
[1:21:24] that big payday 180 million 250 million
[1:21:26] whatever it is now probably in the
[1:21:27] billions as far as i know
[1:21:29] boy they worked hard they they gave
[1:21:33] everything they were
[1:21:34] hungry and then as soon as they got that
[1:21:37] paycheck as soon as they got that
[1:21:38] contract 10 years
[1:21:40] and we're living it boy the next year
[1:21:42] let's just throw baseball in the next
[1:21:43] year
[1:21:44] their average went from 350 down to 210.
[1:21:49] same person but they finally got what
[1:21:52] they
[1:21:53] wanted and they lost their hunger
[1:21:58] i say let's not be that way in church
[1:22:01] see we're not here to just attain some
[1:22:03] revelations
[1:22:04] and then lose our hunger this is an
[1:22:07] everyday relationship
[1:22:09] an everyday pressing i press towards the
[1:22:12] mark
[1:22:13] of the prize of the high calling right
[1:22:15] so we don't want to have that attitude
[1:22:16] luke 12 19 and i will say to my soul
[1:22:18] soul
[1:22:19] soul thou hast much goods laid up for
[1:22:21] many years
[1:22:22] take thy ease eat drink and be merry but
[1:22:25] god said unto him now full this night
[1:22:27] thy soul shall be required of thee
[1:22:29] then whose shall those things be which
[1:22:31] thou has provided
[1:22:33] jesus was not saying blessed are those
[1:22:35] who are concerned in a pursuing way that
[1:22:36] they might perhaps grow
[1:22:38] in righteousness
[1:22:41] he pronounced blessing on ones who are
[1:22:44] hungry for it
[1:22:48] i know famous last words of a minister
[1:22:50] but i am coming to a close with this
[1:22:51] last part
[1:22:53] when to see what what happens when
[1:22:55] disease strikes
[1:22:57] a body what does it begin to do
[1:23:01] takes the hunger and the thirst
[1:23:05] i i don't know about you but if i when i
[1:23:07] when i remember especially when i was a
[1:23:08] kid and i had the flu
[1:23:10] the last thing i wanted to do was eat
[1:23:13] the last thing you know mom was like oh
[1:23:14] you need to have that chicken noodle
[1:23:15] soup i still don't get it but
[1:23:17] you need the last thing i wanted to do
[1:23:19] was eat the last thing i wanted to do is
[1:23:21] drink anything
[1:23:23] there was a disease there was something
[1:23:24] in my body and i did and i lost the
[1:23:27] hunger
[1:23:30] the disease of doubt and fear
[1:23:34] and question victimized by problems of
[1:23:38] life we
[1:23:38] build what is called the victim
[1:23:40] mentality
[1:23:42] it is a disease that causes us to lose
[1:23:46] any will to overcome and we become
[1:23:49] justified by our circumstances
[1:23:52] look at what i've been through you
[1:23:54] wouldn't understand
[1:23:56] there are many victims in a church and
[1:23:59] it's called a victim mentality disease
[1:24:02] and that what does it do when we when we
[1:24:04] let that disease come in our life
[1:24:06] or even the disease of doubt we begin to
[1:24:08] doubt what god has done
[1:24:09] we begin to lose our faith what is it is
[1:24:12] a disease that begins to work in our
[1:24:13] spiritual life
[1:24:14] and what do you know notice begins to
[1:24:16] happen you start losing your desire
[1:24:19] to read the scripture you lose that
[1:24:21] desire to pray
[1:24:23] the desire for the house of god becomes
[1:24:25] weak as you can say you don't backslide
[1:24:27] overnight
[1:24:29] it's a disease you stop eating here and
[1:24:32] you stop eating there why because
[1:24:33] there's a disease
[1:24:34] but guess what brother i know a healer
[1:24:36] tonight
[1:24:38] that heals all diseases you know the
[1:24:41] victim mentality is so strong in america

[1:24:45] churches my god is a healer
[1:24:47] you know i don't care what's happened in
[1:24:49] your life i don't care what mama did
