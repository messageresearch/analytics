[51:48] our Bible to first of all to Romans the
[51:52] 12th
[51:53] chapter and and uh read a very familiar
[51:58] verse in Romans
[52:01] 12 uh I think I have it right
[52:08] here maybe
[52:14] not I thought it was Romans 12 and 2 I I
[52:17] must have wrote it down wrong but I'll
[52:20] maybe I'll just have to let me see if I
[52:22] can I'll I'll I'll read it from my book
[52:26] here and then uh we'll do that and our
[52:29] second scripture is going to be in
[52:31] second Timothy the
[52:36] uh and
[52:39] uh and so it says this is the scripture
[52:42] we'd like to read it says I beseech ye
[52:45] therefore Brethren by the mercy of God
[52:49] that you present your bodies a Living
[52:54] Sacrifice holy and accept able to God
[52:58] which is your reasonable
[53:00] service and be not conformed to this
[53:04] world but be ye
[53:07] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[53:11] that ye may prove what is that good and
[53:16] perfect and good acceptable and perfect
[53:20] will of God that we might prove what the
[53:25] will of God is and let's turn over to
[53:31] Timothy second Timothy and
[53:36] uh and we want to read in the uh first
[53:42] chapter of the second Timothy starting
[53:46] with the fifth
[53:48] verse it
[53:50] says when I call to remembrance the
[53:53] unfringed faith
[53:56] that is in
[53:58] thee which dwelt first in thy
[54:01] grandmother Lois and thy mother units
[54:05] and I am persuaded that in thee also
[54:10] wherefore I put thee in
[54:13] remembrance that thou should stir up the
[54:16] gift of God which is in thee by the
[54:21] putting on of my hands for God hath not
[54:25] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[54:30] and love and of a sound mind amen
[54:35] gracious Heavenly Father we ask you to
[54:38] bless your word to us this morning in
[54:41] Jesus precious name we pray amen God
[54:45] bless you you may be seated this
[54:47] morning we certainly uh uh appreciate
[54:53] all your prayers uh uh uh for uh my
[54:58] family and uh my mother is uh uh you
[55:03] know my mother's kind of in the final uh
[55:07] stages of her time here on Earth and
[55:10] God's given her a great and wonderful
[55:13] Journey she's uh
[55:16] uh 102 years old and and I I I read the
[55:21] other day where there's a a lady in the
[55:23] United States that's 115 years
[55:27] old and uh
[55:30] um uh you know I I don't I I hope I I
[55:35] don't know what God has for me but I I
[55:38] want to go home is anybody feel like
[55:41] that amen I I've just about had all of
[55:45] this world I can take uh lesli's been so
[55:49] faithful her and Sharon out there taking
[55:52] care of my mother and and uh I just felt
[55:55] led to come home uh you know uh Timothy
[56:01] makes this statement Paul to Timothy
[56:04] makes this statement he says he says for
[56:08] God hath not given us the spirit of
[56:12] fear but uh uh but of power and of love
[56:17] and of a sound mind we want to talk a
[56:19] little bit about that this morning with
[56:22] you um it was kind of this
[56:26] thought was brought to me kind of of
[56:29] what uh I was
[56:32] experiencing uh with my mother and as
[56:36] she is struggling uh through the end of
[56:40] her journey uh you know uh for many
[56:44] years she could walk around the house
[56:47] and and cook her own meals and take care
[56:51] of herself but now she's come to that
[56:53] time where she's
[56:54] bedridden and
[56:56] uh my mother was um a Catholic I was
[57:01] raised a Catholic I'm sure um many of
[57:04] those of us that uh have Hispanic
[57:09] background uh are very much know about
[57:13] the Catholic church and uh and what I
[57:17] come to realize is uh just a bondage is
[57:21] really what it is and and so as my
[57:26] mother realizing that she's coming to
[57:29] this time I begin to see uh the thought
[57:34] proc that that was in her and how she
[57:39] was uh facing death and how she was
[57:42] facing what lied in front of her and and
[57:47] a lot of of how you approach things
[57:50] comes from what's in your
[57:52] heart and and so I realized that as my
[57:55] mother uh went there that I saw the
[57:58] separation that God had given me by his
[58:01] mercy and his grace from the Catholic
[58:04] church and from what it is that they
[58:06] believe and how it is that they approach
[58:10] God and and I think our approach to the
[58:13] Lord means so very much I mean approach
[58:16] is everything if you if you don't
[58:19] approach somebody a right way you might
[58:21] have a good intention but your very
[58:24] approach destroys everything that you
[58:27] intended to happen and and you know I've
[58:31] always had difficulty in my life making
[58:34] a a good first impression you know uh
[58:38] part of that is is because I like to
[58:40] kind of kid a little I'm Irish you know
[58:43] our background is we like to say a joke
[58:45] or two or just have a kind of a a
[58:48] friendly thing you know and and I like
[58:50] to give people nicknames you know what I
[58:53] mean if a guy's 10 feet tall I'll call
[58:55] him shorty
[58:56] you know what I mean if a guy's great
[58:58] big I'll call him tiny well you know
[59:01] sometimes you walk up and you say how
[59:03] you doing tiny and they didn't take it
[59:07] the way you meant it and now you you now
[59:11] you're back pad backpedaling and the
[59:15] more you try to fix it the worse it gets
[59:18] you know you finally realize you just
[59:20] want to walk away you lost this one and
[59:24] you hope you learn the lesson
[59:27] and so that's the way it is it's the
[59:30] approach you know maybe if it we take a
[59:33] little bit of time to think through our
[59:35] approach and and to think through our
[59:37] attitude to think through our atmosphere
[59:40] just to take control of our thoughts and
[59:43] ourselves and and gain composure of
[59:46] ourselves and and our approach uh it
[59:49] would go a long ways in our lives of of
[59:53] of how that uh we achieve what we're
[59:56] trying to accomplish and we're trying to
[59:59] accomplish something here this morning
[1:00:01] we're trying to accomplish the Kingdom
[1:00:03] of Heaven we're trying to accomplish if
[1:00:06] I could say this a position in the
[1:00:09] Rapture and and we don't take the
[1:00:12] approach that it's just uh it's going to
[1:00:15] happen uh because it's going to happen
[1:00:17] that's not our attitude amen our
[1:00:20] attitude is one of
[1:00:22] appreciation that we become subject to
[1:00:25] the word of God we don't take Grace and
[1:00:28] and make it a disgrace and we don't take
[1:00:31] predestination and and take our part of
[1:00:35] living right and so we don't do evil
[1:00:38] that Grace May abound God forbid but we
[1:00:42] recognize that we have a role to play
[1:00:44] and that we have a testimony and that
[1:00:47] we're to put our light on the hill and
[1:00:49] not cover it with a bushel basket and
[1:00:53] and that through good works that our
[1:00:55] father Father in Heaven might be
[1:00:57] glorified so we don't take oursel out of
[1:01:01] the out out of the equation we don't sit
[1:01:04] back and say it's all in God's hands and
[1:01:07] I don't have nothing to do if I'm saved
[1:01:09] I'm saved well that that's fine that
[1:01:12] that's a human attitude but if you
[1:01:14] really have received the gift of
[1:01:16] Salvation you want to do everything you
[1:01:19] can for him and for the men and women in
[1:01:22] the your world that you live in you want
[1:01:25] to spread spread the good news you want
[1:01:27] to tell them about the victory you want
[1:01:29] to tell them about the Deliverance you
[1:01:31] want to tell them what it meant to to to
[1:01:34] be free and to be saved and can and they
[1:01:37] can look at
[1:01:38] you they can tell a lot of times people
[1:01:41] know you and they see the difference
[1:01:43] they know there's something about you
[1:01:46] and you know it's not you you know it's
[1:01:48] him and it's just his grace and its
[1:01:51] Mercy but you want to let them know
[1:01:53] that's there for you too no matter how
[1:01:56] dark you are how uh deep in sin you are
[1:02:00] no matter how scarred your life is no
[1:02:03] matter what's been done wrong to you
[1:02:05] there's one that is greater than all
[1:02:07] those things and that's the love of God
[1:02:11] and and a lot of people have had a hard
[1:02:14] life a lot of people didn't get a fair
[1:02:16] shake a lot of children have been abused
[1:02:19] a lot of
[1:02:20] families there's a lot of abused uh uh
[1:02:24] women and and things in this world but
[1:02:27] let me tell you something God will make
[1:02:29] it all right on the other
[1:02:32] side amen he'll have a reward that the
[1:02:35] sufferings of this
[1:02:37] world is not worthy to be compared to
[1:02:41] amen you don't want to miss it you do
[1:02:44] not want to miss what God's got prepared
[1:02:47] for them that love them because of this
[1:02:50] little temporary world that's that's
[1:02:53] full of tiny little daily Pleasures that
[1:02:57] don't amount to anything the wages of
[1:02:59] sin is death but the gift of God is
[1:03:02] eternal life through Christ
[1:03:05] Jesus you don't want to sell yourself
[1:03:07] short you want to get involved you want
[1:03:10] to be a part of it you want to let that
[1:03:12] light shine amen you want to polish your
[1:03:16] life and clean it up and so back to what
[1:03:20] I begin to
[1:03:22] realize is that as my mom approached it
[1:03:25] that Catholic
[1:03:27] thinking begin to take hold of
[1:03:31] her and and she wanted to make sure that
[1:03:35] everything was
[1:03:36] right and
[1:03:39] so and and I this the
[1:03:43] distance between what that
[1:03:47] faith and and I'll just be honest with
[1:03:50] you I I think the Catholic church is a
[1:03:52] great
[1:03:54] Harlot you know I I'm not here to uh you
[1:03:57] say it's hate crime I'm not talking
[1:03:59] about the people I'm talking about the
[1:04:02] thought process the theology the B The
[1:04:06] Binding of the minds of the people with
[1:04:10] their teaching and what Grace it keeps
[1:04:13] them from being able to participate in
[1:04:17] from by what they've been
[1:04:20] taught and they're bound with fear
[1:04:26] and so my mom's coming to this time in
[1:04:29] her life and she want to make sure that
[1:04:33] all of her
[1:04:35] sins that she's paid for all of her
[1:04:40] sins because they believe there's a
[1:04:43] place you go called
[1:04:46] Purgatory now I know you being
[1:04:49] Christians you might not realize this
[1:04:51] but there's things they believe they
[1:04:53] believe that that that little wafer that
[1:04:56] they take that that's the literal body
[1:04:59] of
[1:05:01] Jesus not a remembrance not a symbol but
[1:05:04] it actually is his very
[1:05:08] flesh and that that wine is his
[1:05:11] very blood they believe in praying to
[1:05:15] Saints and to people yet the word of God
[1:05:18] says there's one mediator between God
[1:05:20] and man and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:23] but yet they've got a saint for this and
[1:05:25] a saint for that they got a saint for
[1:05:28] travel a saint for Carpenters a saint
[1:05:31] for this a somebody that'll make
[1:05:33] intercession and and they got all these
[1:05:36] people they're trying to pray through
[1:05:37] their whole life is spent on trying to
[1:05:40] get
[1:05:43] right and so they come to this great
[1:05:46] hour and and she and and they believe in
[1:05:50] this Purgatory so they believe that
[1:05:53] there's certain sins that take you to
[1:05:55] hell
[1:05:57] and those are real bad sins and there's
[1:06:00] other sins that you'll have to pay for
[1:06:03] in
[1:06:05] purgatory so she's she's she's realizing
[1:06:09] that she's on her way to
[1:06:14] purgatory and I thought Lord God there's
[1:06:17] a
[1:06:19] cross that paid the price for my sins
[1:06:23] there's a blood that standing there that
[1:06:26] says father I paid for his sins I took
[1:06:30] the chastisement of his peace upon me
[1:06:34] and by my stripes he's healed not only
[1:06:37] physically but
[1:06:40] spiritually Hallelujah and so now she's
[1:06:43] fixing to go to this great place of
[1:06:46] purgatory well so they and and to put
[1:06:50] them in
[1:06:52] bondage they believe if they do certain
[1:06:55] certain works here on
[1:06:58] Earth it
[1:07:00] attributes to so much credits out of
[1:07:06] purgatory so maybe you've done a few bad
[1:07:09] things in your life so they believe if
[1:07:11] you've done these things you've got so
[1:07:14] much time you have to spend in purgatory
[1:07:19] to pay for
[1:07:21] that I thought my goodness
[1:07:25] the
[1:07:28] bondage the
[1:07:31] bondage I mean what what happened you
[1:07:34] know to he who is free is free indeed
[1:07:38] what happened to the freedom that comes
[1:07:40] when a sinner confessed his sins and
[1:07:42] they've been thrown in the sea of God's
[1:07:44] forgetfulness to be remembered no no
[1:07:47] more she's sitting there thinking that
[1:07:49] those sins haven't been remitted they
[1:07:52] haven't been forgiven they haven't been
[1:07:54] thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:07:56] that she's got to go forward and pay for
[1:08:02] him and here she is
[1:08:06] suffering and if you move her her
[1:08:09] she's in agony and when we lift her out
[1:08:13] of the bed to carry her she she just
[1:08:17] trembles and moans with
[1:08:19] pain and and I
[1:08:22] think why take take take some medicine
[1:08:25] my
[1:08:28] you know just tyen
[1:08:30] all and she says no I'm offering up my
[1:08:36] pain for my
[1:08:40] sins and her caregiver was raised by
[1:08:42] nuns a Catholic friend of her and she
[1:08:45] says yes she says one hour of suffering
[1:08:50] is worth a hundred years out of
[1:08:53] purgatory
[1:08:59] and she's sitting there suffering to pay
[1:09:02] for sins that have already been paid
[1:09:07] for she's remembering every little thing
[1:09:12] that she can think of when it's all been
[1:09:18] forgotten and I looked at that terrible
[1:09:22] bondage and I looked at what motivates
[1:09:27] her and what what is driving her and
[1:09:29] what is holding her and and I I see this
[1:09:33] grip everywhere and it's
[1:09:39] fear
[1:09:42] fear is is what does it the a afraid of
[1:09:47] of what's forward and so I begin to
[1:09:49] think about those things and I begin to
[1:09:51] think about the Liberty that's been
[1:09:54] given us in Christ
[1:09:57] Jesus I just like to to stir up your
[1:10:02] your pure Minds this morning by way of
[1:10:09] remembrance and and
[1:10:12] because uh you know what the word says
[1:10:16] we are is what we're supposed to
[1:10:20] be you understand that what the word
[1:10:23] says we are is is what we're supposed to
[1:10:27] be and and and so that's that's just
[1:10:31] something that that is good he says
[1:10:34] that's the transforming power of God
[1:10:37] that can take something that's nothing
[1:10:40] and make something wonderful out of it
[1:10:43] God's
[1:10:45] transforming power now just think about
[1:10:48] that's the god that we serve that can
[1:10:51] take something that's nothing and make
[1:10:53] something out of it amen
[1:10:55] so that's what he can do so what he says
[1:10:59] you are is what you are to
[1:11:02] be and then he can transform
[1:11:06] that into what it was that he had in his
[1:11:10] mind he he speaks of it this way he
[1:11:15] says he says therefore he created by his
[1:11:19] word he sent his word so all the seeds
[1:11:25] that had had a place upon the Earth he
[1:11:29] formed those seeds by his own
[1:11:33] word for there
[1:11:36] was there was no nothing else to make
[1:11:40] the seed out of he had placed them and
[1:11:44] they were beneath the water and he just
[1:11:47] said let there be this and let there be
[1:11:51] that so understand that we're created
[1:11:54] beings by the word of God the very fact
[1:11:58] that that we have
[1:12:01] life shows us that there had to be a
[1:12:04] life to make a life that's right life
[1:12:07] didn't come from
[1:12:09] nothing it wasn't two Adams floating
[1:12:13] around the sky that happen to bang in to
[1:12:17] one another sometimes man is so smart he
[1:12:21] he's just plain
[1:12:23] ignorant like had to come from someplace
[1:12:27] your personality your being what that
[1:12:30] you are it had to come from some
[1:12:33] place and and that place was the word of
[1:12:36] God you might look and say well I have a
[1:12:38] mother and I have a father but but
[1:12:41] you're not them
[1:12:46] exactly you know my boys didn't get my
[1:12:49] good
[1:12:50] looks they didn't get my
[1:12:53] intelligence you know they're start
[1:12:55] starting to get my
[1:12:57] hair no they got their mother's looks
[1:13:00] and their mother's intelligence so
[1:13:02] you're not exactly what your parents are
[1:13:05] but you are exactly what he wanted you
[1:13:07] to be he's still in control I don't care
[1:13:12] what pictures drawn I don't care what
[1:13:14] this lying world says I don't care what
[1:13:17] this civilization says this education
[1:13:19] says this science says God's word still
[1:13:22] rules
[1:13:25] it's the way God said it it's the way he
[1:13:28] intended it to be every seed that he put
[1:13:31] there he had an intention of that seed
[1:13:34] to be what he said it would be and he
[1:13:37] put the power in that seed to transform
[1:13:41] itself you believe
[1:13:44] that he
[1:13:46] said he said because the great Creator
[1:13:50] had just sent forth his word and the
[1:13:53] word seed was there before the real seed
[1:13:57] ever was
[1:14:00] formed just think of
[1:14:04] that so in other words we are what the
[1:14:08] word says that we
[1:14:12] are that that doesn't change now we have
[1:14:16] not come to that yet because it's the
[1:14:20] what you are is within you and let's put
[1:14:23] it this way it's it's in the state of
[1:14:26] growth none of us became perfect
[1:14:29] Christians the first day we became
[1:14:34] Christians when I gave my heart to the
[1:14:37] Lord you know I thought well all my
[1:14:40] troubles are over and come to find out
[1:14:43] they just
[1:14:45] began right I thought I just thought
[1:14:48] everybody was going to embrace what I
[1:14:51] had it was so good I felt so free but
[1:14:54] you know I still had all my long curly
[1:14:56] hair and and I I still wore my hippie
[1:14:59] clothes and all my albums were still in
[1:15:02] my house and and everything was
[1:15:06] there my nature had changed but I had to
[1:15:09] be weaned off all those things they had
[1:15:12] they had to be cut away from me I had to
[1:15:15] make a sacrifice I had to come to the
[1:15:17] day that I said I'm not going to play
[1:15:19] this music no more I would come under
[1:15:23] conviction and and the the word of God
[1:15:26] would would put me into a place and and
[1:15:28] I realized I can't take this path and
[1:15:31] carry this with me amen this won't fit
[1:15:34] through the eye of the needle amen it
[1:15:37] won't make it the the Way's narrow if
[1:15:40] I'm going to go this way and it kept
[1:15:42] getting narrower and narrower and
[1:15:45] narrower till there's a time where
[1:15:46] there's only one thing that can go down
[1:15:49] that road and that's the unadulterated
[1:15:51] word of God
[1:15:55] but you went through that
[1:15:59] process and some of us we still in that
[1:16:02] process there's still things that God
[1:16:05] wants to change us change our heart
[1:16:08] change our attitude change our mind
[1:16:11] there's still things he wants to do for
[1:16:13] us and you it's it's not it's not just a
[1:16:17] one time experience and a a one time oh
[1:16:22] I've accepted him from Christ I'm saved
[1:16:24] no no you've been you've been
[1:16:26] impregnated you've been germinated now
[1:16:29] you've got to grow into the image of
[1:16:32] Christ
[1:16:35] Jesus praise God he don't give up on
[1:16:39] us he'll take the clay and he'll
[1:16:42] completely tear it down and remold it
[1:16:47] again he'll mold you over and over again
[1:16:52] and you think it's all over and you
[1:16:53] think you finally got everything right
[1:16:56] and pretty soon you're back in The Moldy
[1:16:58] hands of the
[1:17:01] master and he's trying to change your
[1:17:03] attitude he's trying to change your
[1:17:05] thought he's trying to build the faith
[1:17:07] up in you but what did he do you know
[1:17:11] what he do he he gave us exceedingly
[1:17:15] great and precious
[1:17:18] promises and that they've been given to
[1:17:21] us to help us achieve the position we
[1:17:25] are to rise
[1:17:27] to another you're making this journey
[1:17:31] and what does he do he gives you the
[1:17:33] promises in his
[1:17:35] word that by these exceedingly great and
[1:17:39] precious promises you can become
[1:17:42] partakers of divine
[1:17:45] nature because what he planted in you
[1:17:49] was divine
[1:17:52] nature it just happened to be planted in
[1:17:56] a sinful
[1:17:58] body that we must bring under
[1:18:02] subjection and it's a constant Warfare
[1:18:05] for the flesh Wars against the spirit
[1:18:08] and the spirit against the Flesh and
[1:18:11] these two are contrary one to another
[1:18:14] the battle's
[1:18:17] on it's on in you it's the real
[1:18:22] you really the intention that God had
[1:18:26] given you breaking through the Earth of
[1:18:28] this body so it can spring
[1:18:32] forth and bear the
[1:18:34] fruit of the seed that it was planted
[1:18:38] and intended to
[1:18:40] be so that's what he wants us to rise up
[1:18:45] to he's given us
[1:18:51] promises EX
[1:18:57] excuse
[1:19:02] me his
[1:19:06] promis
[1:19:08] promises we might obtain not by our own
[1:19:13] effort not by our own works not by our
[1:19:17] power and not by our might but by his
[1:19:20] Spirit saith the
[1:19:23] Lord and he gives you that Spirit by way
[1:19:26] of
[1:19:28] promise I promise you if you confess
[1:19:31] your sins I'll be faithful and righteous
[1:19:35] to forgive
[1:19:39] them I promise you that I promise you
[1:19:43] I'll not leave you nor forsake you I
[1:19:47] promise you if I start a work in you I
[1:19:50] will finish it till the end I promise
[1:19:53] you nothing can pluck you out of the
[1:19:56] palm of my hand I promise you I'll be
[1:19:59] with you even in you till the
[1:20:03] end I promise you that I'll come again
[1:20:07] and receive you that you may be where I
[1:20:10] am also I promise you these
[1:20:14] things and by these
[1:20:17] promises you can now rise
[1:20:19] up and Achieve if I could use that
[1:20:23] terminology or rise up to the position
[1:20:27] that he wants you
[1:20:31] in cuz he had an intention for your
[1:20:36] life and when you lose the
[1:20:40] understanding that you have a position
[1:20:43] and a place and a role to play something
[1:20:47] that God had intended for you to be to
[1:20:51] do and manifest that he had a nature and
[1:20:55] an attribute that he wanted to be
[1:20:57] manifested in you in the personality and
[1:21:01] the position and the body form that he
[1:21:04] gave you when you fail to see that you
[1:21:07] wrap yourself in
[1:21:12] religion and all you've got
[1:21:15] religion
[1:21:17] Doctrine
[1:21:22] Fellowship I believe this and I believe
[1:21:26] that but yet religion has no power to
[1:21:33] change to
[1:21:35] transform so he made us to be a people
[1:21:41] of
[1:21:42] Faith that's what God
[1:21:45] wants what are we we're a people that
[1:21:48] believe his word we're a people of
[1:21:52] Faith what's our greatest attribute it's
[1:21:57] Faith right that's what we are we're a
[1:22:00] people that believe
[1:22:02] God we believe that he
[1:22:06] is so that's the first thing he's not
[1:22:08] looking for religious
[1:22:12] ceremony he's not looking for
[1:22:15] theologians he wants you to believe
[1:22:19] him he wants you to believe what he said
[1:22:22] he would do for you he wants you to
[1:22:25] believe every
[1:22:26] promise every chapter every verse every
[1:22:31] line every
[1:22:33] word he wants you to know it's him and
[1:22:37] believe
[1:22:38] it that's what he's looking for well
[1:22:41] that's what we are you say why are we
[1:22:44] that because that's what he planted
[1:22:46] that's what he said we would be is
[1:22:49] Believers we call ourselves believers
[1:22:58] we believe that all things are possible
[1:23:01] through Christ
[1:23:04] Jesus we have got no limits we've got no
[1:23:07] barriers We've Got No Boundaries we've
[1:23:10] got no chains he's broken Every
[1:23:15] Chain we're
[1:23:19] free we're free to
[1:23:22] worship we're free to pray
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:29] we're free that we don't have to come in
[1:23:31] bondage to the
[1:23:34] flesh when Temptations rise up and try
[1:23:38] to draw us a aay we're not we we don't
[1:23:42] have to succumb to it because you feel
[1:23:46] it in your body because you feel it in
[1:23:48] your
[1:23:49] mind and it's got such a pull on you you
[1:23:52] can stand back and say wait a minute I'm
[1:23:58] free you're trying to tempt me you're
[1:24:02] trying to lie to me you're trying to
[1:24:04] draw me
[1:24:06] off I've been set free from
[1:24:09] that I'm free indeed who is free is free
[1:24:16] indeed he's my friend he called me
[1:24:19] friend he says because my friends know
[1:24:21] what I'm doing
[1:24:25] he's exposed the enemy the son of
[1:24:28] predition totally
[1:24:31] exposed what what
[1:24:35] magnitude of Christians ought to be on
[1:24:39] display in this body of Believers this
[1:24:42] morning who has heard the unadulterated
[1:24:45] word and recognize the visitation of the
[1:24:48] Lord Jesus Christ in the form of a
[1:24:50] pillar of fire veiled in a prophet
[1:24:56] think of
[1:24:59] it what is there that you can't
[1:25:02] do all things are
[1:25:07] possible that's the kind of
[1:25:10] people that we
[1:25:12] are we're a people that have word
[1:25:16] evidence
[1:25:19] yes think of it we have word
[1:25:23] evidence right is is isn't that what it
[1:25:26] is now Faith is the substance of things
[1:25:29] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:25:33] seen our evidence isn't what we see our
[1:25:36] evidence is what he
[1:25:41] said that's our
[1:25:43] evidence because we're we're
[1:25:46] ruled by
[1:25:50] faith we're ruled by faith we're a
[1:25:53] people that that that the word is our
[1:25:58] evidence we're a people that rely on the
[1:26:06] supernatural we're we're not a
[1:26:09] religion we're a
[1:26:14] people from all languages all cultures
[1:26:19] all backgrounds all shapes all forms all
[1:26:22] colors he's got a people they're his
[1:26:26] people we're not just a church we're not
[1:26:29] a religion we're not quote unquote a
[1:26:32] message it was a message to a people and
[1:26:36] the people that were his people received
[1:26:39] his message and another they will not
[1:26:45] follow they know who their daddy
[1:26:49] is they're not
[1:26:53] hybrid they they know it's God's word
[1:26:56] they hear God's word my sheep hear my
[1:26:58] voice and another they will not
[1:27:02] follow they know what they're anchored
[1:27:05] to they've heard the eagle
[1:27:08] scream that scream awoken something
[1:27:12] inside of them and they begin to hear
[1:27:15] the precious words of God and the words
[1:27:18] of life and they didn't say oh that's
[1:27:21] nice they said that's me amen they
[1:27:24] looked in the mirror of God's word and
[1:27:26] said Mommy that's
[1:27:30] me I'll tell you when I first come to
[1:27:32] this message I just didn't hear this
[1:27:34] message I saw this
[1:27:38] message when he would speak I would look
[1:27:42] and I would
[1:27:44] see I was listening
[1:27:47] to only had a very few messages and I
[1:27:50] remember he spoke and he said you watch
[1:27:53] drive down the road Road that's
[1:27:55] somewhere around work time and there'll
[1:27:56] be a woman out there mowing her lawn in
[1:28:01] shorts oh I heard it but I'm driving
[1:28:04] home at that exact time and there's
[1:28:07] somebody mowing their lawn in shorts I
[1:28:09] didn't just hear it I saw
[1:28:13] it and that's why he said in this lady
[1:28:16] of see and age I counsel thee to buy of
[1:28:19] me Isa that thou might see that you're
[1:28:22] not just hearing this V
[1:28:24] you're seeing
[1:28:27] it you're seeing it in the corruption of
[1:28:30] the government you're seeing it the
[1:28:32] moral Decay you're seeing it in lady oia
[1:28:35] you're just let I I didn't see it but
[1:28:38] I've heard so much about it about this
[1:28:40] mockery of the last
[1:28:44] supper I guess it got so
[1:28:47] bad that even the pope had to say
[1:28:50] something
[1:28:55] pretty bad when the devil talks out
[1:28:56] against the
[1:28:58] devil they're just gossiping about one
[1:29:01] another trying to give a cover
[1:29:04] up but how many young minds did that
[1:29:08] scar how many seeds to that plant about
[1:29:12] the acceptance of the lady
[1:29:15] oia uh blind miserable poor wretched and
[1:29:19] naked and don't know it
[1:29:25] but I praise God that you
[1:29:27] know you're a people that's been given
[1:29:30] to
[1:29:33] know you're a people that he opens your
[1:29:36] eyes that you can
[1:29:40] see you're not
[1:29:47] deceived if you
[1:29:50] hear Faith cometh by hearing hearing by
[1:29:53] the word of God
[1:29:56] so
[1:29:57] this this is what we
[1:30:00] are we're a people and I want to say
[1:30:02] that a people we're not a
[1:30:06] religion we're a
[1:30:09] people we're a
[1:30:11] predestinated tribe of
[1:30:14] Believers we are a culture and a society
[1:30:18] within
[1:30:19] ourselves we are
[1:30:22] shedding and separating
[1:30:24] from all the traditions of our parents
[1:30:27] and all the traditions of our upbringing
[1:30:29] and all the influences of our past and
[1:30:34] we're separating ourselves from all
[1:30:36] those things and we're bringing
[1:30:38] ourselves into total submission and a
[1:30:41] prisoner to God's
[1:30:46] word I hear a lot of people try to
[1:30:49] justify things that are and they're just
[1:30:53] traditions
[1:30:54] traditions of men and things and they
[1:30:57] say oh well it's in the scripture and
[1:30:59] and you
[1:31:01] know Jacob and and elaser and all that I
[1:31:04] said well how come you were doing that
[1:31:06] stuff a thousand years before you ever
[1:31:08] heard about
[1:31:12] elaser it's passed
[1:31:14] down and it gets in our
[1:31:18] thinking and our
[1:31:20] thinking has been marred
[1:31:25] because that's where the battle is it's
[1:31:28] in the mind and that's why the scripture
[1:31:31] says let this mind be in you that was in
[1:31:33] Christ Jesus and renew your mind by the
[1:31:36] washing of the water of the
[1:31:42] word so we're a supernatural
[1:31:46] people God made us that's what we are
[1:31:49] and he can he can transform us into that
[1:31:53] and I just want to read a statement if I
[1:31:55] could if you be with it then God said
[1:31:57] it's all good so I'll just rest and each
[1:32:03] one of those seeds that's
[1:32:06] you you're what he's
[1:32:09] planted you say well my mama and daddy
[1:32:11] it don't matter who your mommy and daddy
[1:32:14] are if God planted you you're going to
[1:32:16] come
[1:32:21] up that it settled
[1:32:24] listen to what he says he says each one
[1:32:27] of those seeds has the power in itself
[1:32:30] to transform itself into the species
[1:32:35] that I desire it to
[1:32:38] be you're a spey
[1:32:43] Believer you're not you're a a a
[1:32:49] unique Faith species
[1:32:54] of people that's separate and totally
[1:32:57] unique to this
[1:33:03] world I hope you think yourself like
[1:33:06] that we are in this world but we are not
[1:33:11] of this
[1:33:15] world you are all ilal
[1:33:22] aliens we're Ali aliens we're
[1:33:26] pilgrims we're
[1:33:28] strangers we're in a foreign land we
[1:33:32] don't speak their
[1:33:34] language we don't have their
[1:33:37] Customs we don't have their
[1:33:43] politics we don't have their Customs we
[1:33:46] don't have their culture we don't have
[1:33:48] their
[1:33:50] education now we might know what they
[1:33:53] know
[1:33:54] but what they know doesn't determine
[1:33:57] what we are or what we're going to do
[1:34:00] only the word determines what we are
[1:34:03] what we're going to do they might give
[1:34:05] us natural knowledge they might give us
[1:34:08] uh civilization skills but when it
[1:34:11] finally comes to that final
[1:34:13] determination of the believer his
[1:34:15] decision's going to be made on God's
[1:34:17] word not on the education he
[1:34:20] received he's going to do what's right
[1:34:23] he's gonna do what's just he's goingon
[1:34:26] to do what's fair he's going to do
[1:34:28] what's kind he's goingon to do what's
[1:34:31] merciful he's going to do what's patient
[1:34:33] and
[1:34:35] good that's what he's going to do
[1:34:38] because he has a king reigning in his
[1:34:42] heart and he has the same mind in him
[1:34:45] that Christ Jesus had that he looks upon
[1:34:48] the needs of others more than the needs
[1:34:50] of his
[1:34:52] own I'm moving to my
[1:34:55] clothes so desired it to be that's what
[1:34:59] it must be because I have given every
[1:35:02] seed transforming power to make out of
[1:35:07] itself in its potential now to make out
[1:35:11] of itself
[1:35:13] exactly what I want it to
[1:35:19] be right now listen and this is I just
[1:35:24] want to pick up this
[1:35:26] morning laying the foundation on my
[1:35:29] thought this
[1:35:31] morning and we are all still in the
[1:35:35] image of
[1:35:38] God but some are so
[1:35:41] deformed as sons of
[1:35:44] God that walk contrary to his
[1:35:47] word and do his
[1:35:49] ways that he had us and provided for us
[1:35:55] to
[1:35:58] walk we're not walking in the way that
[1:36:02] he provided us to
[1:36:05] walk which was
[1:36:08] Faith right without
[1:36:10] faith it's impossible to please
[1:36:16] God that's what that was attention he
[1:36:19] says to
[1:36:21] what he says say something the world
[1:36:25] Twisted us out of the way pulls Us close
[1:36:29] to it and away from the straight narrow
[1:36:32] stripe that he planted Us in to be Sons
[1:36:36] and Daughters of God sin has done this
[1:36:40] evil thing to the Sons and Daughters of
[1:36:43] God
[1:36:46] unbelief now this
[1:36:49] morning we realize that we're supposed
[1:36:51] to be a people of faith
[1:36:56] is that right Hebrews 11
[1:36:59] and6 without faith it's impossible to
[1:37:03] please God for We must believe that he
[1:37:06] is and a rewarder of them that
[1:37:10] diligently seek
[1:37:12] him without that
[1:37:15] Faith you can't please
[1:37:19] them we can have a religious form
[1:37:24] but that's not what he's looking for
[1:37:26] he's looking for men and women who's got
[1:37:29] the Seed Faith that's planted in there
[1:37:32] and he's giving you promises and the
[1:37:35] word of God that that faith that you're
[1:37:39] meant to
[1:37:41] have so much so that the very Ministry
[1:37:46] of Malachi 45 was to restore the faith
[1:37:50] of the children back to their fathers
[1:37:57] that's why that word is so important
[1:38:00] it's
[1:38:02] designed it's
[1:38:05] structured the sentences are
[1:38:08] assembled in such a way the voice
[1:38:12] emphasis on every noun every thing is is
[1:38:17] position so perfectly that it strikes
[1:38:23] the ear and the Heart of the
[1:38:28] believer there's something about
[1:38:33] it Satan starts to come around and he's
[1:38:37] he's saiding well sure you've been heing
[1:38:39] awful long time and and this is supposed
[1:38:41] to be the end time I said wait a
[1:38:45] minute this wasn't about
[1:38:48] history this is the revelation of Christ
[1:38:51] Jesus
[1:38:55] I don't measure things by Time by
[1:38:58] Distance by space I measure it by
[1:39:06] eternity so if we're if we're we're
[1:39:09] supposed to be this great Supernatural
[1:39:13] people and and and we're supposed to
[1:39:15] have this
[1:39:17] Faith to the place that the works that I
[1:39:21] do you should do also now that's
[1:39:25] beautiful to say
[1:39:26] Amen but when you get in the closet and
[1:39:30] you good in the mirror and you look
[1:39:33] there you've got to act yourself are the
[1:39:35] works that he's done absolutely alive in
[1:39:40] my
[1:39:42] life and I
[1:39:44] don't talking about comparing yourselves
[1:39:47] one to another that's
[1:39:51] foolish are you true to your
[1:39:54] heart are you true to that Holy
[1:39:58] unction that little still Small
[1:40:01] Voice that tells you to do something or
[1:40:05] go
[1:40:07] somewhere or when it tells you you need
[1:40:09] to make that
[1:40:11] right or you're convicted of something
[1:40:15] and you go lay it
[1:40:17] down you're being
[1:40:19] led you're not full of bitterness you're

[1:40:52] love of God and and and and you want to
[1:40:55] do something for your fellow

[1:45:23] this gospel Paul said I'm not ashamed of

[1:45:31] Salvation not just your salvation but
[1:45:35] everybody that comes in contact with
[1:45:37] your stand will be
[1:45:40] affected by the word of
[1:45:44] God because God stands by his
[1:45:47] word and if you stand for him he'll
[1:45:50] stand for you but if you're a ashamed of
[1:45:53] him and Afraid of the consequences
[1:45:56] afraid of the results then then you come
[1:45:59] under that terrible bondage and the
[1:46:02] chains of
[1:46:08] fear and
[1:46:10] fear
[1:46:16] paralyzes fear is is the greatest
[1:46:24] anesthesia there
[1:46:27] is it stopped you it knocked you out it
[1:46:31] puts you dead in your tracks and you
[1:46:34] don't do
[1:46:36] nothing you will not move you'll stand
[1:46:39] there in a shell and you'll believe
[1:46:43] you'll praise you'll do everything but
[1:46:46] there's absolutely not a Fountain of
[1:46:48] Life pouring out from you
[1:46:53] you're absolutely afraid of what's it
[1:46:56] going to do I'll tell you what it'll do
[1:46:59] it'll save Souls it'll heal the sick
[1:47:02] it'll deliver the demons that are bound
[1:47:05] that's what it'll
[1:47:10] do oh but you know what it is it's I
[1:47:14] wonder if it's
[1:47:17] me and your mind goes back to all the
[1:47:20] wrong you're doing all the sins in your
[1:47:22] life and everything and now you're
[1:47:25] afraid and all he said is cry ABA father
[1:47:29] confess your sins and he's faithful and
[1:47:32] just to forgive
[1:47:34] him but we're
[1:47:37] Paralyzed by
[1:47:39] fear Satan's raised up such a culture
[1:47:43] such a civilization our country is
[1:47:45] turning away from
[1:47:49] God that they want me to even be afraid
[1:47:52] afraid to stand in this pulpit and say
[1:47:55] homosexuality is a spirit of the devil
[1:47:58] it's a perversion that a person can be
[1:48:00] delivered
[1:48:04] from you can't say stuff like that you
[1:48:07] get
[1:48:09] cancelled they can't cancel
[1:48:11] me cuz I'm
[1:48:15] [Applause]
[1:48:17] Eternal I've been planted
[1:48:20] here to Bear the fruit fruit of this end
[1:48:24] time message the word of God for this
[1:48:28] age that's what I'm planted
[1:48:30] for but fear
[1:48:36] rules that great Catholic culture I was
[1:48:38] talking about and I I'm not going to
[1:48:41] mention any names and I I hope the
[1:48:44] person doesn't take offense but I I
[1:48:47] called one day I I dialed the wrong
[1:48:50] number and the sister answered the phone
[1:48:53] and I said hello oh sister I said I'm so
[1:48:57] sorry that I dialed the wrong number and
[1:49:03] she said oh she said I thought I was in
[1:49:09] trouble and I thought you know what
[1:49:11] that's that pastoral demon bondage
[1:49:15] that's been ruling in the Hispanic
[1:49:17] Church all over this country for years
[1:49:24] afraid that they'll put you out of the
[1:49:26] church afraid the deacons are going to
[1:49:29] show up and ask you where where you were
[1:49:31] Wednesday night afraid of the church
[1:49:34] afraid of the ministry afraid of being
[1:49:37] blackballed afraid that you might not
[1:49:39] make it to Heaven well let me give you
[1:49:41] some news if your name is put in the
[1:49:43] Lamb's Book of Life nothing can put it
[1:49:46] on there and nothing can take it
[1:49:51] off you don't have to be
[1:49:55] afraid fear not little flock fear not
[1:49:59] little
[1:50:02] flock isn't that what he always said
[1:50:06] this this is what he says in God's
[1:50:09] projecting his love love has no fear
[1:50:13] love cast out fear isn't that beautiful
[1:50:17] just think of
[1:50:18] that so this is what he always says he
[1:50:22] says
[1:50:23] so that's what it is and that's what he
[1:50:25] always said he always spoke he said fear
[1:50:28] not fear not fear not fear not fear not
[1:50:32] it's all through the
[1:50:35] scripture why he doesn't want us to fear
[1:50:38] there's no reason to be
[1:50:42] afraid there is a fear
[1:50:45] though it's called the fear of
[1:50:49] God that's not man's fear
[1:50:53] man's fear is the
[1:50:55] afraid the fear of God is the beginning
[1:50:58] of
[1:51:01] wisdom and what is the fear of God the
[1:51:05] fear of God it's it it's simply there's
[1:51:08] another fear is the fear of God and what
[1:51:11] is the fear of God God does what he
[1:51:17] says you know God's going to do what he
[1:51:20] says if there's anything it's you have
[1:51:22] the wisdom that God's going to do what
[1:51:25] he said that's it that's settled God
[1:51:28] said so that settles it that is what's
[1:51:31] going to
[1:51:32] happen if God said it that's what's
[1:51:35] going to
[1:51:38] happen I'm not afraid of that
[1:51:43] result CU his thoughts to me are
[1:51:48] good he cares about me
[1:51:52] I'm his
[1:51:54] child nothing's going to pluck me from
[1:51:56] the palm of his
[1:51:58] hand I want his will in my life I want
[1:52:02] his
[1:52:03] correction I don't want my will I want
[1:52:06] his will so the the fear of God is God
[1:52:10] does exactly what he says he's going to
[1:52:14] do that's a knowledge and a faith and a
[1:52:17] revelation you have how is it it is how
[1:52:22] God God said no matter what the picture
[1:52:25] is no matter how he spins it no matter
[1:52:29] what he makes it
[1:52:31] appear cuz Satan appears as an angel of
[1:52:34] Light it doesn't matter it is according
[1:52:39] to the word of
[1:52:41] God no
[1:52:45] changes it doesn't
[1:52:48] change nothing can change it
[1:52:53] nothing can stop
[1:52:57] it nothing can alter its
[1:53:00] course it'll be just what he
[1:53:07] said that's the fear of
[1:53:09] God and the fear of
[1:53:12] God
[1:53:14] removes the fear of
[1:53:18] man and I say
[1:53:21] this will'll have to remove
[1:53:25] fear and its companion doubt before
[1:53:29] faith and the word can
[1:53:33] rain do you understand we can't go
[1:53:37] forward with
[1:53:40] fear it paralyzes us we'll be stuck
[1:53:44] right where we are no work no
[1:53:47] Supernatural no power what we'll do is
[1:53:51] we'll substitute an
[1:53:55] emotion or a temporary
[1:53:58] experience for genuine life power in The
[1:54:03] Believer to speak and believe God's word
[1:54:06] and stand there till it comes to
[1:54:09] P not a fleeting
[1:54:13] moment not a temporary thing but it's a
[1:54:18] life it's a soldier it's the word made
[1:54:22] flesh
[1:54:23] little Messiahs walking out taking
[1:54:26] control of every circumstance and says I
[1:54:29] declare this circumstance to come into
[1:54:31] Conformity to God's word CU God word
[1:54:36] rule I take control of this in the name
[1:54:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ by the word of
[1:54:43] God Satan get behind
[1:54:49] me no big guys no little yous no special
[1:54:55] preachers and gifted guys and
[1:55:00] personalities but Victorious
[1:55:03] People Day by Day morning by morning
[1:55:07] afternoon by afternoon evening by
[1:55:09] evening Night by Night defeating Satan
[1:55:12] in their lives as he rises
[1:55:18] up push the fear out
[1:55:26] fear causes
[1:55:28] unbelief fear pises you fear is the
[1:55:32] result of not believing
[1:55:35] that it's what he
[1:55:38] said replace man's
[1:55:41] fear with the fear of
[1:55:43] God you know what happens is we only go
[1:55:46] as far as we're
[1:55:51] comfortable Faith always goes
[1:55:54] past Faith goes where nobody's ever gone
[1:55:57] before Faith takes you to where you've
[1:56:01] never been before because there's
[1:56:04] nothing worldly that can bring you
[1:56:09] there you can only get to that realm
[1:56:12] through the
[1:56:13] Supernatural and the key to that door is
[1:56:16] God's word he said so
[1:56:22] I can lay my hands on the sick and they
[1:56:25] will recover
[1:56:29] why because I have a title or a position
[1:56:33] of Pastor for some
[1:56:35] reason
[1:56:36] no you might have the gift of healing
[1:56:39] right in your
[1:56:43] life it just needs to be SP stirred up
[1:56:47] because God has not given us the spirit
[1:56:49] of
[1:56:50] fear but of power
[1:56:53] and of love and of a sound mind fear is
[1:56:58] not a sound
[1:57:00] mind fear is
[1:57:03] confusion you can feel
[1:57:08] fear you walk up it's a wall it's a
[1:57:12] prison it stops you I'm just
[1:57:15] afraid where are you going I thought
[1:57:19] Mom what are you afraid of
[1:57:23] and I thought
[1:57:24] Lord I don't ever want to come to that
[1:57:27] place where I doubt where I'm
[1:57:29] going you purchased me I'm yours nothing
[1:57:35] can pluck me out of the palm of your
[1:57:37] hand and if I'm an eror you'll correct
[1:57:40] me if I take the permissive will you'll
[1:57:43] work it out to the perfect will you are
[1:57:46] my Lord You Are My Savior you are my God
[1:57:51] and nothing can say separate us from the
[1:57:53] love of God that is in Christ Jesus no
[1:57:56] Peril nor sword nor danger or
[1:58:03] anything what do I have to be afraid
[1:58:06] of but
[1:58:09] fear fear is what's stopping
[1:58:13] us fear of what people think fear of
[1:58:16] what everybody else is doing fear of
[1:58:19] this fear of
[1:58:20] that forg for get
[1:58:24] fear you are his
[1:58:31] children we're joint
[1:58:34] HS with Christ Jesus everything he has
[1:58:38] is ours fear not little flock it's the
[1:58:42] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:58:47] kingdom why don't we start possessing
[1:58:50] the kingdom and the the benefits of the
[1:58:55] Kingdom each of us in order to be a
[1:59:00] functional part of this body with every
[1:59:04] member supplying the need to the other
[1:59:06] you've got to break down the fear
[1:59:09] because it won't flow you're afraid to
[1:59:12] fellowship with somebody you're afraid
[1:59:14] to talk to Christ because maybe they're
[1:59:16] not a Believer or maybe they'll reject
[1:59:19] you or maybe they're backslid
[1:59:23] all the more
[1:59:26] reason to lift them up the Lord don't
[1:59:30] want you to be afraid I want to close
[1:59:32] with some
[1:59:39] statements now there's only two elements
[1:59:41] in the world that controls the
[1:59:45] world tonight that's fear and faith
[1:59:54] fear stops
[1:59:56] faith faith eliminates
[2:00:01] fear so you understand that if there's
[2:00:04] any
[2:00:05] fear we've got to start moving that
[2:00:12] out he
[2:00:15] controls he'll take care of it don't be
[2:00:18] afraid don't be afraid of that sickness
[2:00:22] don't be afraid you're going to be
[2:00:24] paralyzed don't be afraid you're going
[2:00:25] to die don't be
[2:00:30] afraid love has no
[2:00:33] fear love cast out
[2:00:37] fear and I notice in my meetings so much
[2:00:42] that when I come into the people one of
[2:00:45] the greatest things I find amongst them
[2:00:49] is
[2:00:50] fear and what makes fear is lack of
[2:00:55] confidence if you lack confidence it'll
[2:00:58] make you fear but if you love it Cast
[2:01:02] Away fear do lack confidence in what he
[2:01:07] said you
[2:01:10] are that's why I love that story of the
[2:01:13] prodical son he's eating with
[2:01:16] pigs he's got the husk in his mouth the
[2:01:19] pigs on the other side he's f to eye
[2:01:22] with
[2:01:25] Pig and the scripture says he came to
[2:01:28] his
[2:01:30] sensus he said in my father's house
[2:01:34] servants are eating better than I
[2:01:40] am and when he went back what did he
[2:01:43] find he was willing to be a servant but
[2:01:46] he was an heir he was a son Hallelujah
[2:01:55] maybe you're in the pig pen fighting a
[2:01:56] lust devil fighting a video game devil
[2:02:00] fighting the music devil fighting the
[2:02:02] fashion
[2:02:06] devil I know you sisters like to wear
[2:02:08] those high
[2:02:09] heels and those tight
[2:02:13] dresses you know I I don't
[2:02:16] know you know the world cares about how
[2:02:19] you're built God don't he built you that
[2:02:26] way there's not going to be one skinny
[2:02:28] person in
[2:02:31] heaven they're going to be so
[2:02:33] spiritually fat and rich on eating the
[2:02:36] wedding
[2:02:38] supper oh they're going to be jolly old
[2:02:43] souls where do we get all these
[2:02:45] obsessions
[2:02:54] well I I saw the other day I I never
[2:02:57] seen so much stuff you know I was
[2:02:59] watching a little I like engineering
[2:03:01] programs I was watching a a program
[2:03:04] about how that they they dug this tunnel
[2:03:06] and how they had to overcome it and I'm
[2:03:08] telling you in the course of that
[2:03:10] program I was I I was offered uh uh
[2:03:15] super beats uh I I was offered uh fruits
[2:03:20] and veggies and and and this and and
[2:03:24] this pain pill and and this sleep pill
[2:03:27] and then they went into the creams you
[2:03:29] know you wipe the creams on your face
[2:03:31] and it draws your skin all up and
[2:03:33] everything you look so pretty I want to
[2:03:35] look like a
[2:03:36] veteran of Christian
[2:03:43] War I don't mind having the the battal
[2:03:46] scars on my life I've seen Devils cast
[2:03:50] out I've seen them go on the floor like
[2:03:53] snakes I've seen babies come alive in
[2:03:56] the womb I've seen people be delivered
[2:03:58] by
[2:04:01] Devils I don't talk about it because all
[2:04:03] the glory goes to
[2:04:06] him but why are you afraid of the
[2:04:11] Devil he's a
[2:04:13] liar there's no truth in him he's the
[2:04:17] father of lies and he cannot tell the
[2:04:20] truth
[2:04:26] the worst thing the devil can put upon
[2:04:28] you is
[2:04:30] fear if you ever had a Cancer and didn't
[2:04:34] fear and believe God would heal you you
[2:04:38] wouldn't be in too bad a
[2:04:45] shape think of it the life comes in
[2:04:49] there and you fear it
[2:04:52] you fear what it's going to do you fear
[2:04:55] what they say about it you fear all o
[2:04:58] cancer that's that's a dense and they
[2:05:00] fear I fear that oh my goodness my mind
[2:05:02] goes to battle and oh my is going to eat
[2:05:04] me up and I'm going to die and I have to
[2:05:05] take
[2:05:07] chemo if you would
[2:05:10] believe God you wouldn't be in so bad a
[2:05:13] shape in fact you know what happened
[2:05:16] you'd become so Godly that that life
[2:05:19] wouldn't want to hang around you very
[2:05:20] much longer
[2:05:22] it wouldn't find nothing in your life to
[2:05:24] feed on you got Jesus in every bone of
[2:05:27] your body and every blood cell in every
[2:05:31] thought every time he goes to take a
[2:05:33] bite he gets Jesus he gets the word of
[2:05:36] God he gets Faith let me tell you the
[2:05:38] best chemo in the world's
[2:05:41] faith God said so the fear of God is
[2:05:44] going to be just the way he said so
[2:05:48] Hallelujah you want to fight cancer
[2:05:51] bring it
[2:05:56] on
[2:05:58] oh biggest thing Satan could put on you
[2:06:00] is
[2:06:01] fear do you understand what I'm trying
[2:06:03] to say this morning we're not going to
[2:06:06] go farther down the road as a body of
[2:06:10] Believers till every single one of our
[2:06:13] members starts combating the fear when
[2:06:17] fear Rises up recognize for what it is
[2:06:20] call it out
[2:06:23] yes label
[2:06:28] it you wouldn't be in such bad shape God
[2:06:32] takes care of that if you're sick
[2:06:35] whatever it is if you didn't fear so
[2:06:39] fear is one of the worst things that
[2:06:42] Satan can place upon the
[2:06:45] person the greatest thing that I find
[2:06:48] against the church tonight is fear
[2:06:52] everybody is scared to death about
[2:06:55] something what are you scared about if a
[2:06:59] man's born again he should be
[2:07:02] happy and
[2:07:04] carefree isn't that
[2:07:07] beautiful it it it's just
[2:07:11] beautiful so much he says listen he says
[2:07:16] now we are a part of
[2:07:19] God do you believe that
[2:07:26] that if your heart condemns you God is
[2:07:30] greater than your
[2:07:33] heart if you're condemned by your
[2:07:36] actions you're condemned by what you're
[2:07:38] partaking in and you know it's wrong
[2:07:42] he's faithful and just to forgive you
[2:07:46] come back cleanse your life get rid of
[2:07:50] the fear
[2:07:52] don't give them something to hang on
[2:08:03] to you're a part of God you always
[2:08:08] was you don't remember it because you
[2:08:11] were only an attribute in
[2:08:14] God you were only in his thinking your
[2:08:18] very name if you ever was on the book of
[2:08:22] life it was put there before the
[2:08:24] foundation of the world he knew what you
[2:08:28] were I'm only saying this not to mix up
[2:08:32] Doctrine but to straighten it out that
[2:08:36] we might get away from this fear and
[2:08:43] scare why do you think you went through
[2:08:46] all that about the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:08:49] about how we were predestinated about
[2:08:51] how that we're ordained about how we
[2:08:54] were in this thinking what was the
[2:08:56] purpose of it to get us away from the
[2:08:59] fear the fear is Satan's
[2:09:06] bondage you have a right to do every
[2:09:11] work in the
[2:09:13] Scriptures it never was put in a nickol
[2:09:16] Adan system it was for Sons and
[2:09:19] Daughters of God
