[17:16] amen worship god for eternity that's our
[17:19] heart desire
[17:20] amen brother mike can come at this time
[17:22] for our psalm writing
[17:30] amen
[17:38] morning
[17:43] put a couple extra layers on this
[17:44] morning
[17:47] you know the uh the two shortest
[17:49] chapters
[17:50] in the book of the bible are in the
[17:53] psalms
[17:55] one of them is psalm 134
[17:58] it's only three verses long
[18:02] it's the second shortest chapter in the
[18:04] bible extra credit
[18:06] to those who know what the shortest is
[18:10] but you know in verse one even in this
[18:11] little this little chapter
[18:15] there's a there's a ton of good stuff in
[18:17] it
[18:18] you know i i couldn't even make it past
[18:21] verse one
[18:23] so in though psalm 134 1 it makes this
[18:27] statement it says behold bless ye the
[18:31] lord
[18:33] all ye servants of the lord
[18:36] that little statement bless the lord
[18:40] you know it's something we read it's
[18:43] something we say it's something that we
[18:45] sing but i'm just curious when we look
[18:49] at that statement
[18:51] what does that mean to bless the lord
[18:55] you know it we might say it's to praise
[18:58] him
[19:00] we might say it's to worship him we you
[19:02] know we know that
[19:03] song that we sing bless the lord o my
[19:05] soul
[19:07] and all that is within me bless his holy
[19:09] name
[19:11] what about the time in the scriptures
[19:12] when it says things like i will bless
[19:15] thee
[19:16] and i will bless them what about the
[19:20] time when jesus is preaching on the
[19:21] sermon on the mount it says blessed
[19:23] are they that do hunger and thirst after
[19:26] righteousness for they shall be filled
[19:29] how about the times that we pray that
[19:31] the lord would bless us
[19:34] or we give a testimony that we've been
[19:36] blessed
[19:38] or that such and such a thing as a
[19:39] blessing
[19:41] is it praise then is it worship
[19:46] what does it mean to bless the lord and
[19:48] if he blesses me
[19:51] how can i possibly bless him
[19:54] the same way you know there's a
[19:58] thing that i do you know it's
[20:00] interesting even that phrase bless the
[20:02] lord this is just free
[20:03] but david's the one who really made that
[20:05] he's the one that says it the most
[20:07] out of 22 times in the scriptures david
[20:09] says it 18
[20:10] times but there's this thing i do
[20:13] whenever there's a phrase or a word or
[20:15] whatever that
[20:15] just just trying to comprehend a little
[20:18] bit what the word might mean
[20:20] when it uses that i go back to the very
[20:23] first time that that
[20:24] word is used in the scripture and more
[20:27] often than not
[20:28] it sort of defines itself the first time
[20:31] it's used
[20:32] and it turns out the very first time
[20:34] that that word bless
[20:35] is used this is in genesis 12
[20:38] 2 when the lord is calling abraham and
[20:42] he makes this statement he says and i
[20:44] will make of thee a great
[20:47] and i will bless thee and
[20:50] make thy name great
[20:54] and thou shalt be a blessing
[20:57] the first time that the lord uses the
[21:00] phrase bless
[21:02] he identifies it as making someone's
[21:05] name
[21:06] great you know
[21:10] he basically describes giving abraham a
[21:13] name
[21:14] an identity a reputation a witness
[21:18] that is great you know and sometimes
[21:21] we'll look at all the blessings that he
[21:22] had in terms of flocks and herds and
[21:25] riches and whatnot and say that he was
[21:27] definitely blessed
[21:28] but the real blessing is the fact that
[21:30] when you look at his testimony in the
[21:32] scripture he's described as a
[21:34] man of faith as the father of our faith
[21:38] even as a friend of god not as the one
[21:42] who lied
[21:42] about who his wife was to protect his
[21:44] own skin
[21:46] not as the one who laughed when the lord
[21:49] first told him he was going to have a
[21:50] son in his old age
[21:52] none of that instead he had a name he
[21:55] had an identity of being
[21:56] the father of our faith and a friend of
[22:00] god
[22:01] he was given a great name he was blessed
[22:05] you know when jacob went into isaac
[22:09] snuck into isaac to get his blessing
[22:12] and if you read it what that was in
[22:14] genesis 27
[22:15] 28-29 when isaac blessed him he did so
[22:18] by making his name great
[22:20] he said let people serve thee and
[22:22] nations bow down to thee his blessing
[22:25] was to be given a name
[22:27] an identity a testimony a reputation if
[22:31] you will
[22:35] so how do we bless
[22:38] the lord we bless the lord in exactly
[22:41] the same way
[22:42] by making his name great
[22:46] you know we have been whenever you make
[22:50] someone's name
[22:51] great you're broadcasting his identity
[22:55] his name his attributes in everything
[22:59] that you do
[23:02] you know name is an identity it's a set
[23:05] of attributes that that describes a
[23:08] person
[23:09] a character and all their relationships
[23:12] so that when someone's name or someone's
[23:14] identity is made
[23:15] great it's broadcasting the collective
[23:18] character and attributes of that
[23:21] individual
[23:24] you know in exodus 33 when moses asked
[23:26] the lord to show him his glory
[23:28] you remember the story where he put him
[23:29] in a cleft of the rock
[23:31] caused him to see his back parts as he
[23:34] passed by
[23:36] he said i will make all my goodness pass
[23:38] before thee and i will proclaim the name
[23:40] of the lord
[23:41] before thee and in exodus 34 6 when he
[23:45] actually passed by
[23:46] it was a continuous proclamation going
[23:49] forth
[23:50] declaring the attributes of the lord
[23:53] blessing the lord so when you see in the
[23:57] scriptures statements like
[23:58] bless the lord bless the lord or bless
[24:01] ye the lord my servants
[24:03] like in psalm 134 you know what to do
[24:07] it's about proclaiming his attributes
[24:09] it's about making his name
[24:11] great it's about making his identity
[24:13] known
[24:14] in all that you do and in exchange he
[24:17] blesses us
[24:18] by giving us a name that is great
[24:21] his name his identity his attributes
[24:26] so i just you know that just kind of
[24:27] stuck out to me as i was reading that
[24:29] little scripture
[24:30] bless ye the lord all ye his servants
[24:32] what is that
[24:34] it's to make his name great in all that
[24:36] you do
[24:38] so let's just read that together and
[24:40] hopefully that blesses you like it did
[24:41] me it's just three little verses
[24:44] in psalm 134 says behold
[24:47] bless ye the lord all ye servants of the
[24:50] lord
[24:51] which by night stand in the house of the
[24:54] lord
[24:55] lift up your hands in the sanctuary and
[24:57] bless the lord
[24:59] the lord that made heaven and earth
[25:01] bless thee out of zion
[25:03] amen
[25:12] amen god bless you man of your seats man
[25:14] let's sing at calvary

[57:05] hey man
[57:09] you know every time i i look at a little
[57:12] baby or dedicate a baby i just can't
[57:14] believe they grow up
[57:16] you know and it doesn't seem like in no
[57:19] time flat
[57:20] you're you know they're walking around
[57:23] taller than you
[57:24] are and unlike people say i'm not
[57:27] shrinking
[57:29] p everybody else is getting bigger so
[57:32] uh we're blessed this morning to have
[57:35] brother nathan with us
[57:37] this morning nathan bryant from new
[57:40] albany
[57:41] as we said the church of the open door
[57:44] and his congregation
[57:46] watching via internet we know that a
[57:48] storm is blown in i've never seen a time
[57:51] where
[57:51] there's so many efforts to try to close
[57:54] the church doors
[57:55] but we appreciate you that have made the
[58:00] journey out this morning to be here in
[58:02] fellowship
[58:03] the day may progressively get worse if
[58:06] you
[58:06] are comfortable with coming back we
[58:09] certainly
[58:10] welcome you back this evening some of us
[58:13] live closer
[58:15] if your drive is a little more
[58:16] treacherous then
[58:19] please feel free to stream online but
[58:22] we'll try to stream our service this
[58:24] evening also
[58:26] and we're close enough brother nathan
[58:29] and i can walk to church if it gets too
[58:31] bad
[58:32] and you'd do that for me would you
[58:36] rather
[58:36] praise the lord and and uh so
[58:40] uh so but anyway
[58:43] it because it was snow it wasn't too bad
[58:45] but sometimes after it's driven on and
[58:48] it gets packed it might get a little
[58:49] slick anyway so
[58:51] anyway if you feel at all uncomfortable
[58:55] with coming to service we certainly
[58:57] understand and once again all of you
[58:59] that have joined us by way of live
[59:01] stream
[59:02] uh we certainly uh trust that you'll be
[59:05] blessed this morning
[59:07] and so let's just go forward with god's
[59:11] word this morning let's stand and let's
[59:16] turn our hearts to the lord and act as
[59:19] we you know as we
[59:23] sing amazing grace to
[59:27] invite brother nathan to the pulpit
[59:31] just turn your hearts to the lord this
[59:33] morning
[59:34] and and just ask god to speak to you
[59:38] you know i don't believe any of you have
[59:40] visited
[59:41] uh much with nathan uh
[59:46] this week and i certainly haven't
[59:49] talked of anything about anybody or any
[59:53] problems or anything like that or
[59:55] what anybody needs or what anybody's got
[59:59] on their heart
[1:00:00] for prayer and what their desire might
[1:00:03] be
[1:00:03] in their heart so there's only one that
[1:00:07] knows that
[1:00:09] and that's the lord he knows your heart
[1:00:12] he knows what you have need of even
[1:00:14] before you ask
[1:00:15] and and if if you could just
[1:00:19] have that confidence in him like
[1:00:22] the song said i look to jesus
[1:00:25] and you'd be surprised that god just
[1:00:28] used a vessel of flesh
[1:00:30] to really speak to you
[1:00:34] and i know some of you are at home and
[1:00:38] i know many of the people that stream
[1:00:41] that can't make it to service they get
[1:00:43] dressed up in their church
[1:00:45] clothes and they they don't
[1:00:48] have the coffee cup in their hand they
[1:00:49] get dressed up like they're going to
[1:00:51] church
[1:00:52] and they sit there and and they enter
[1:00:55] into the service and ask god
[1:00:58] to speak to him do you believe he can
[1:01:01] speak to you this morning that's what
[1:01:04] makes it personal
[1:01:06] that he can take a man that's willing to
[1:01:10] get out of the way and not say what he
[1:01:13] thinks you want to hear
[1:01:14] or not try to say i'm only going to
[1:01:18] preach something i'm not going to just
[1:01:20] but he's true and honest to what god
[1:01:22] puts on his heart to pray
[1:01:24] and when he preaches that you find out
[1:01:26] that
[1:01:27] you'll walk out of here saying that's
[1:01:28] what i prayed last night
[1:01:30] that's the scripture i read we were just
[1:01:33] talking about that the other day
[1:01:37] that just answered my question because
[1:01:39] jesus christ
[1:01:40] is truly the same yesterday today and
[1:01:44] forever
[1:01:45] and he's present here this morning to do
[1:01:48] for you
[1:01:49] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:01:52] you can ask or think
[1:01:53] so as we invite our brother to the
[1:01:55] pulpit this morning
[1:01:56] let's sing that song amazing grace
[1:02:07] sing grace
[1:02:23] [Music]

[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:40] let's sing it again this way oh praise

[1:06:15] praise god praise
[1:06:19] god amen god bless you richly and good
[1:06:24] to be with you again
[1:06:27] some people blame me for bringing this
[1:06:29] cold weather but i think it beat us here
[1:06:31] so
[1:06:32] try not to blame me too bad but good to
[1:06:34] be in church this morning
[1:06:37] brother branham in a message called the
[1:06:39] church in its condition
[1:06:41] in 1962 he talks about how that he would
[1:06:44] go up into the northern areas and
[1:06:46] british columbia and out in the alaskan
[1:06:49] highway
[1:06:50] and different places and how the people
[1:06:52] would actually have to come
[1:06:54] with dog sleds and things to the service
[1:06:56] and he said no doubt there'll be
[1:06:58] a great outpouring of the spirit because
[1:07:00] where there's little bl where there's
[1:07:01] little
[1:07:02] uh effort and little sacrifice put in
[1:07:04] there's little blessing but where
[1:07:06] there's big sacrifice put in
[1:07:08] there's a big blessing so uh you had to
[1:07:10] put out a little more sacrifice to come
[1:07:12] this morning so i pray that there'll be
[1:07:14] a great blessing this morning not
[1:07:16] because that i'm here
[1:07:17] not even because brother david's here
[1:07:19] but because jesus
[1:07:21] promised that he'd be here he said
[1:07:23] wherever two or three are gathered
[1:07:24] together he'd be in their midst so i
[1:07:26] i i'm excited this morning to know that
[1:07:29] he's here with us
[1:07:30] it puts me at ease to know that he said
[1:07:32] he'd never leave me nor forsake me and
[1:07:35] and want to greet the our church at home
[1:07:38] uh literally this morning there at home
[1:07:41] and um
[1:07:42] and we want to greet them and and
[1:07:44] appreciate those that are listening in
[1:07:45] that from the local area here
[1:07:47] and from back home where we're from and
[1:07:50] appreciate brother david giving us the
[1:07:52] opportunity to come and appreciate the
[1:07:53] work
[1:07:54] that the lord is doing through him here
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:57] my we're truly a blessed people to have
[1:07:59] truth in this age aren't we
[1:08:02] an age of darkness where there's so much
[1:08:04] that uh
[1:08:05] just seems like everywhere you turn it's
[1:08:07] turmoil and chaos
[1:08:09] and fear but yet the the
[1:08:12] the believer has a peace that they know
[1:08:16] in whom they've believed and
[1:08:17] we know he's got it all in control amen
[1:08:20] god bless you jeremiah chapter 17 this
[1:08:22] morning if you turn with
[1:08:24] me jeremiah chapter 17
[1:08:28] and just want to read there before we
[1:08:30] pray this morning
[1:08:41] brother david put the pressure to me he
[1:08:43] said i don't i don't want some canned
[1:08:45] sermon he said we want fresh manna this
[1:08:47] morning and
[1:08:48] and then we canceled our service i
[1:08:50] thought well if i preach something i've
[1:08:51] preached at home they've all heard that
[1:08:53] anyhow so
[1:08:54] something something new this morning
[1:08:56] that i've never preached before so you
[1:08:58] you pray for me
[1:09:00] jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 10 i the
[1:09:03] lord
[1:09:04] search the heart i tried the reins
[1:09:07] even to give every man according to his
[1:09:10] ways and according to the fruit of his
[1:09:12] doings
[1:09:13] amen may the lord add his blessings to
[1:09:15] the reading of his word and
[1:09:17] i want to speak on a thought this
[1:09:18] morning of god's great detective
[1:09:21] god's great detective let's bow our
[1:09:23] heads together
[1:09:24] dear heavenly father lord we thank you
[1:09:26] for another opportunity to be
[1:09:28] assembled together lord for those of us
[1:09:30] that are here
[1:09:31] and lord for those that couldn't be here
[1:09:34] due to distance or due to weather
[1:09:36] lord i i thank you that they have
[1:09:39] through the
[1:09:40] form of media a way that they can
[1:09:42] assemble themselves together even though
[1:09:43] they're not physically here
[1:09:45] yet lord we're assembled around your
[1:09:47] word this morning
[1:09:49] and lord we thank you for a body of
[1:09:51] believers here in texas that still
[1:09:53] believes in your word and still believes
[1:09:56] in assembling themselves together and
[1:09:58] lord we
[1:09:58] we thank you for an opportunity lord
[1:10:00] just to speak
[1:10:02] what you've placed on my heart this
[1:10:03] morning and i pray that you'd help me to
[1:10:06] get myself out of the way
[1:10:08] lord i don't know the needs of the
[1:10:09] people but lord you know every need
[1:10:12] and you know the circumstance lord you
[1:10:15] know
[1:10:15] what they're facing and you know lord
[1:10:17] exactly the type of encouragement that
[1:10:19] they have
[1:10:20] need of and lord i don't have the
[1:10:22] ability to
[1:10:23] look into their life as a prophet would
[1:10:26] to know
[1:10:26] exactly what is what they're facing but
[1:10:29] lord we do
[1:10:30] have the word and we know that the word
[1:10:32] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:10:33] intents of the heart
[1:10:35] and so i just pray this morning father
[1:10:36] that you would help me to get out of the
[1:10:38] way
[1:10:39] and anoint me to get into a channel that
[1:10:41] would speak something that would
[1:10:43] encourage them in lord whatever it is
[1:10:45] that they're facing
[1:10:47] may you just come by our way again this
[1:10:49] morning and lord speak to hearts we'll
[1:10:51] give you the glory and the praise for it
[1:10:53] in jesus christ's name and the church
[1:10:55] said
[1:10:57] amen god bless you and you can be seated
[1:10:58] this morning
[1:11:10] this word in in jeremiah chapter 17 that
[1:11:13] we read where it says i am the lord that
[1:11:15] searched the heart
[1:11:16] that word search is a greek word or a
[1:11:19] hebrew word excuse me that
[1:11:20] that means to search or to search for
[1:11:23] to search out to examine
[1:11:27] or to investigate and so we want to look
[1:11:30] at this
[1:11:30] this uh thought of god's great detective
[1:11:33] it's not something that i made up
[1:11:35] it's actually a quote that we'll read
[1:11:36] later in the service
[1:11:38] i heard a few months ago and and this
[1:11:41] phrase just stood out to me god's
[1:11:44] great detective and brother brandon when
[1:11:46] he refers to that he's referring to the
[1:11:47] holy spirit
[1:11:48] as being god's great detective and you
[1:11:51] know
[1:11:52] the god's detective is he's better than
[1:11:54] you you read of sherlock holmes or
[1:11:57] nancy drew and the hardy boys but god's
[1:11:59] detective is greater than anything they
[1:12:01] could do because
[1:12:02] they would have to which are obviously
[1:12:04] being fictional characters but any
[1:12:06] detective that you would look at
[1:12:08] whether it be real or fictional they
[1:12:10] would have to try to piece together
[1:12:12] a little bit at a time what they were
[1:12:15] trying to investigate or search for they
[1:12:17] didn't
[1:12:17] have the whole picture and so they would
[1:12:20] look for little clues and they would
[1:12:22] find
[1:12:22] evidence and try to piece it all
[1:12:24] together and and form a conclusion but
[1:12:26] god's great detective
[1:12:28] he had all the facts before there was
[1:12:30] ever a mystery
[1:12:31] he had all the facts and and you know
[1:12:34] many times
[1:12:34] many times an investigator they're
[1:12:36] actually trying to to reveal or expose
[1:12:39] certain things and
[1:12:40] and to try to prove certain facts but
[1:12:42] god actually did it the opposite way
[1:12:45] he had all the facts and then he veiled
[1:12:48] those in a mystery
[1:12:49] that he would reveal to his people down
[1:12:51] through time
[1:12:52] and so god when he looks at a problem he
[1:12:55] he knows
[1:12:56] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:12:58] heart he knew who would be here this
[1:13:00] morning
[1:13:00] he knew what your path would be we're
[1:13:02] going to get into a little bit of
[1:13:03] predestination this morning that god
[1:13:06] by for knowledge you go back to romans
[1:13:08] chapter 8 in romans chapter 9
[1:13:10] and god by foreknowledge could look down
[1:13:12] through time before there was ever time
[1:13:14] now that's you know we that's hard for
[1:13:16] us to wrap our mind around that god
[1:13:18] could look down through time before time
[1:13:21] existed god was in eternity
[1:13:23] but brother david he knew the time that
[1:13:25] we would be on the face of the earth
[1:13:27] before there was a concept of time
[1:13:29] and he could look and he knew your end
[1:13:31] he knew your beginning
[1:13:33] before adam was ever created on the
[1:13:35] earth before there was ever a molecule
[1:13:37] before there was ever anything that was
[1:13:38] created
[1:13:39] god the self-existing one brother
[1:13:41] branham said he couldn't even really be
[1:13:42] called god
[1:13:43] because god means an object of worship
[1:13:46] but that he was just the self-existing
[1:13:48] one out there in eternity
[1:13:50] but he looked down through time and he
[1:13:52] looked down through space
[1:13:54] and there was no space yet but he knew
[1:13:56] where you would be born
[1:13:58] and he knew who your parents would be
[1:14:00] and he knew who your grandparents would
[1:14:02] be
[1:14:02] and god could look down and see
[1:14:04] everything that would be from the very
[1:14:06] beginning to the very end
[1:14:07] he knows when he wrote his word he the
[1:14:10] back of the book is already written and
[1:14:12] satan is exposed and we know
[1:14:14] what his end is and you know it's
[1:14:16] interesting to see how that satan works
[1:14:18] because satan
[1:14:19] goes about it as though he doesn't know
[1:14:21] what his own end is but he knows he's
[1:14:23] already read the same
[1:14:24] book that we've read and he knows what
[1:14:26] his end will be but yet he's
[1:14:28] he keeps going out here and attempting
[1:14:29] different things but god
[1:14:31] has already exposed what the end of
[1:14:33] satan will be but i'm so thankful
[1:14:35] that he also exposed that for the
[1:14:37] predestinated we don't have an end
[1:14:40] oh my we didn't have the beginning
[1:14:42] because we were a part of god as an
[1:14:44] attribute of god now you had
[1:14:45] as far as your physical being you had a
[1:14:47] date we can all look back to and
[1:14:49] well my birthday was this this month and
[1:14:52] this day and this year
[1:14:53] but in god's eyes you were already
[1:14:56] existing back there with him
[1:14:57] he knew you would be and he knew what
[1:14:59] your progress would be
[1:15:01] he knew what your struggles would be he
[1:15:03] knew what your trials would be
[1:15:04] and so god could look down and search
[1:15:06] out the beginning through the end
[1:15:08] before there was ever any space time or
[1:15:10] anything like that and
[1:15:12] god knew all about it already you know
[1:15:14] that should give us a piece this morning
[1:15:17] that should give us a peace that no
[1:15:18] matter who's elected or who's impeached
[1:15:20] or who's not
[1:15:21] impeached or no matter what the disease
[1:15:24] comes out next or no matter what they
[1:15:26] say about coronavirus
[1:15:27] it hasn't shocked god
[1:15:31] god has never been shocked by anything
[1:15:33] that has happened when when
[1:15:34] when eve came and and and said all my
[1:15:37] the serpent
[1:15:38] beguiled me uh god didn't have to ring
[1:15:40] his hands together and go have a
[1:15:41] conference in the garden and say
[1:15:43] what are we gonna do we've got a problem
[1:15:45] here we need to come up with a plan of
[1:15:46] redemption
[1:15:47] to save these people gabriel uh uh
[1:15:50] michael
[1:15:50] a wormwood any of you all got any ideas
[1:15:52] of how we can have a plan of redemption
[1:15:54] there was already a plan of redemption
[1:15:56] in place
[1:15:57] before adam and eve were ever placed in
[1:15:59] the garden because it said that jesus
[1:16:01] was the lamb that was slain before the
[1:16:04] foundation of the world
[1:16:05] well we know you that doesn't make a lot
[1:16:07] of sense intellectually because we can
[1:16:09] look and say well
[1:16:10] he was slain around 80 33 he wasn't
[1:16:12] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:16:14] but in god's mind and in god's thinking
[1:16:17] it was already a finished work
[1:16:19] because he had already seen what would
[1:16:20] be he had predestined and pre-planned
[1:16:23] what would take place
[1:16:24] and he already had a plan of redemption
[1:16:26] before there was anybody that needed to
[1:16:28] be redeemed
[1:16:29] he already had a plan of salvation
[1:16:31] remember it's a dual atonement
[1:16:33] not only salvation but also healing he
[1:16:35] already had a plan for salvation before
[1:16:37] there was anybody that was sick
[1:16:39] and even before jesus died on the cross
[1:16:42] brother branham said that
[1:16:43] when they lifted up the brass serpent in
[1:16:45] the wilderness moses here
[1:16:46] he goes and he crafts this and god tells
[1:16:49] him lift it up before the people
[1:16:50] and those that will look will live oh
[1:16:52] it's time that we look and live again
[1:16:54] this morning
[1:16:55] amen you don't have to look to a man
[1:16:57] except the man christ
[1:16:58] jesus you don't need to look to nathan
[1:17:01] bryant but we do need to look to the
[1:17:02] word that god sent us
[1:17:04] look and live this morning there's life
[1:17:06] in it
[1:17:07] and so moses would lift up the brass
[1:17:10] serpent in the wilderness and all those
[1:17:11] that had been bitten by these snakes
[1:17:13] if they would look they would live
[1:17:14] brother branham said they were drawing
[1:17:16] dividends
[1:17:17] on a deposit that hadn't even been made
[1:17:19] yet
[1:17:20] oh if you can find me a plan like that
[1:17:22] brother matthew at a
[1:17:24] you find me a bank brother jackson that
[1:17:26] i can go down
[1:17:27] and draw dividends on an investment that
[1:17:29] i haven't even made yet
[1:17:31] oh you know i i'd like to collect my
[1:17:33] thousand dollar interest
[1:17:34] we don't show any deposits at all but
[1:17:36] i'm gonna make a deposit 40 years down
[1:17:38] the road they'll run you out of the
[1:17:39] building
[1:17:40] but god allowed his children in the
[1:17:42] wilderness journey back there
[1:17:44] to draw dividends on a deposit that
[1:17:47] hadn't even physically literally been
[1:17:49] made yet
[1:17:49] but in god's mind he already accepted
[1:17:52] that it was going to take place because
[1:17:54] he had already seen it
[1:17:56] amen now that's glorious isn't it but
[1:17:58] you know we we look at that oh thank you
[1:18:00] god for saying
[1:18:01] that you were going to come and be
[1:18:02] veiled in flesh and and that you were
[1:18:04] going to
[1:18:05] have a plan of salvation that you could
[1:18:06] do that and already heal people and
[1:18:08] let them draw dividends but you know god
[1:18:10] knows what your end will be
[1:18:12] as well and that's why the scripture
[1:18:14] says that now are we the sons of god
[1:18:16] amen now not not that we will future now
[1:18:20] we are seated in heavenly places with
[1:18:22] christ
[1:18:22] jesus but we want to put god off in the
[1:18:24] future somewhere but god
[1:18:26] looks at it as a finished work now maybe
[1:18:28] you're just getting started on your
[1:18:29] journey with god and maybe
[1:18:31] you've got a long way to go yet as far
[1:18:33] as the person in the pew besides you
[1:18:35] feels they look at you and all my
[1:18:36] they need to work on this and they need
[1:18:38] to learn more about that
[1:18:39] but god looks at the finished product
[1:18:42] and sees what you're going to be
[1:18:45] oh my psalm chapter 44 verse 20 if we
[1:18:48] have forgotten the name of our god or
[1:18:50] stretched
[1:18:51] our hands to a strange god shall not god
[1:18:53] search this out
[1:18:54] for he knoweth the secrets of the heart
[1:18:58] that shouldn't it shouldn't surprise
[1:19:00] people you know it's been it had been so
[1:19:02] long
[1:19:02] since we really had a vindicated prophet
[1:19:04] that it surprised people
[1:19:06] when a man like brother branham would
[1:19:07] come and he could stand in a prayer line
[1:19:09] and people would come up and he'd say
[1:19:11] now i don't know you
[1:19:12] i don't know who you are or anything
[1:19:13] about you and he said
[1:19:15] i'll be honest you can recognize i'm
[1:19:17] stalling because i'm just as helpless as
[1:19:19] helpless could be
[1:19:20] and then he'd turn right back around and
[1:19:22] say now this is your name and this is
[1:19:24] your address and this is your parent's
[1:19:25] name and this is what your doctor looks
[1:19:27] like
[1:19:27] and this is what he read on the chart
[1:19:29] that shouldn't surprise anybody
[1:19:31] when moses sat down and began to write
[1:19:32] the bible he looked back and he said
[1:19:34] esau was red and
[1:19:36] hairy and somebody said how did you know
[1:19:37] that moses you weren't there
[1:19:39] we didn't have any artifacts and and
[1:19:41] bibles
[1:19:42] and letters and things say post flood to
[1:19:44] know what it was like back there before
[1:19:46] noah
[1:19:47] how do you know what some of these
[1:19:48] things were that she wrote about about
[1:19:50] the first six days of creation you
[1:19:52] weren't there how do you know about noah
[1:19:54] and about his children and what their
[1:19:56] names were and
[1:19:57] how long it took him to build and how
[1:19:58] many days they went in before the door
[1:20:00] was shut
[1:20:01] he said i just saw it a moment ago
[1:20:04] amen because god allowed him to look
[1:20:06] back in time and write it oh
[1:20:07] brother banham said he went to a house
[1:20:09] one time and a man he was praying
[1:20:11] for a little baby and as they were
[1:20:13] headed there in the car
[1:20:14] brother bam said does your house look
[1:20:15] like this is the wallpaper like that and
[1:20:17] the chair like that he said brother
[1:20:18] branham was you ever there he said i was
[1:20:20] just there a minute ago
[1:20:22] amen the man didn't understand but he
[1:20:24] wasn't physically there
[1:20:25] but he was looking in a dimension that
[1:20:27] the world knows nothing about
[1:20:30] and the same god that could look back
[1:20:32] down through time and tell a prophet
[1:20:33] what your past was
[1:20:35] can look down through time in the future
[1:20:37] and know what your outcome will be
[1:20:41] oh my the same god that could tell moses
[1:20:43] write this about noah and write this
[1:20:45] about abraham and
[1:20:46] and how he sat in the tent door and
[1:20:48] elohim came down the same god could
[1:20:50] allow moses to sit there and write
[1:20:52] and moses went up to mount nebo and died
[1:20:54] there and moses hadn't even died yet but
[1:20:56] moses was writing it
[1:21:00] the same one that could look back and
[1:21:02] say sarah said this to abraham
[1:21:04] the same god could speak to him and say
[1:21:07] i'm going to raise up a prophet like
[1:21:08] unto you
[1:21:10] and so he could look forward in time and
[1:21:12] he could look backwards
[1:21:14] in time why because it wasn't the man it
[1:21:16] was the god that was using the man to
[1:21:18] anoint him to do that
[1:21:19] and that god knows the secrets of the
[1:21:21] hearts as we said earlier hebrews
[1:21:23] chapter 4 verse 12 for the word of god
[1:21:25] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:21:28] any two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:21:30] dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[1:21:32] and the joints and marrow and is a
[1:21:34] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:21:37] the heart i'm sure you've experienced
[1:21:38] that where maybe
[1:21:39] uh you know i had a a person tell me
[1:21:42] recently they
[1:21:43] they had a a friend there or a family
[1:21:46] member at church
[1:21:47] and and they were sitting there hearing
[1:21:49] me preach and a question
[1:21:51] popped into their mind and i don't even
[1:21:53] remember what the question was but they
[1:21:54] something just a question popped in
[1:21:56] their mind they were new to the message
[1:21:57] they didn't know
[1:21:58] really what we believed or what we
[1:22:00] taught they just happened to be in
[1:22:01] church that morning
[1:22:02] and i was preaching something and a
[1:22:04] question popped into their mind
[1:22:06] and they thought well what about this
[1:22:08] and i said now maybe you're thinking
[1:22:09] what about this and said whatever it was
[1:22:11] now
[1:22:12] i didn't know a bit more than anything
[1:22:13] what they were thinking but what was it
[1:22:15] the word
[1:22:16] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:22:17] intents of the heart i don't get to take
[1:22:19] credit for that because i didn't know
[1:22:20] what they were thinking
[1:22:22] but he knew what they were thinking
[1:22:23] because the word is still a discerner of
[1:22:25] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:22:27] maybe you're sitting here this morning
[1:22:28] and you have a need and you think oh my
[1:22:30] the title of this sermon and the
[1:22:32] direction brother nathan's gone he's
[1:22:34] probably not going to speak to that need
[1:22:35] well you just say god
[1:22:36] you get a hold of that man and you get
[1:22:38] him into a channel where he can speak
[1:22:40] and you'll be surprised what god can do
[1:22:42] and maybe i won't have a bit more idea
[1:22:44] about it than nothing unless you come up
[1:22:46] and tell me after service
[1:22:47] but that don't i don't have to know but
[1:22:49] he knows
[1:22:52] would see jesus 1959 give him your life
[1:22:55] if you want to give him glory
[1:22:57] i believe the brother read a scripture
[1:22:59] about that earlier in psalms about to
[1:23:01] give
[1:23:01] god glory give him your life if you want
[1:23:03] to give him glory come
[1:23:05] give yourself up to him surrender that
[1:23:07] the great holy spirit
[1:23:09] god's detective knows all about you
[1:23:14] oh my they sing it about santa claus but
[1:23:16] it wasn't true about santa but it is
[1:23:18] true about jesus
[1:23:19] he sees you when you're sleeping he
[1:23:21] knows when you're awake
[1:23:23] he knows if you've been bad or good so
[1:23:25] be good for goodness sake
[1:23:27] they tried to attribute that to santa
[1:23:29] santa don't know nothing about me
[1:23:31] but jesus does he knows when you're
[1:23:34] afraid and he knows when you're
[1:23:36] discouraged and he knows when you're
[1:23:38] depressed
[1:23:38] and he knows when you're sick and he
[1:23:40] knows when you're facing family problems
[1:23:42] and he knows when that loved one is
[1:23:43] backslid and he cares because you care
[1:23:47] he even cares about the little things i
[1:23:49] had a sister emailed me the other day
[1:23:51] and said she was trying to find
[1:23:52] something to she had
[1:23:54] some pipes that she was afraid to that
[1:23:56] were going to freeze up
[1:23:57] and she was trying to find some
[1:23:59] insulation and things to put around it
[1:24:00] and was sorting through things out in
[1:24:02] the garage and found a piece that was
[1:24:03] just the right size for that pipe and
[1:24:05] just the right length
[1:24:06] just a scrap piece seemed like in the
[1:24:08] shed but god knew her need now that
[1:24:09] might seem little to you but my you you
[1:24:11] get yourself in a time like that
[1:24:13] when you have a need and god gives you a
[1:24:15] custom piece fit
[1:24:16] just for what you need it might not be a
[1:24:18] pipe insulation
[1:24:19] might be a prayer cloth or might be a an
[1:24:22] answered prayer or might be something
[1:24:23] that you're facing and god just custom
[1:24:25] fits something specifically to you
[1:24:27] and you realize that he cares about the
[1:24:29] little things just as much as he cares
[1:24:31] about the big things he knows
[1:24:33] all about you we're looking
[1:24:36] at this thought of god's great detective
[1:24:38] now god is not just a private eye he's
[1:24:40] the all-seeing eye
[1:24:42] he sees into every detail of your life
[1:24:44] he sees your mistakes he sees your
[1:24:47] weaknesses you know the thing that
[1:24:48] that amazes me is that god could look
[1:24:51] down through time
[1:24:52] and as i start to get to it and we got
[1:24:54] way off on a channel here somewhere but
[1:24:56] romans chapter 8 in romans chapter 9 it
[1:24:58] begins to break into the thought of
[1:25:00] god's foreknowledge and how that
[1:25:01] he could predestinate by foreknowledge
[1:25:03] and paul takes them back to malachi
[1:25:06] chapter 1 there when it begins to talk
[1:25:08] about how that jacob
[1:25:09] have i loved and esau have i hated now
[1:25:12] jacob and esau had not even been formed
[1:25:14] when god
[1:25:15] begins to say this in his thinking that
[1:25:17] before they were even born before they
[1:25:19] were formed in the womb
[1:25:21] i decided i love jacob and i hate esau
[1:25:24] now god god
[1:25:26] did not we don't believe in random
[1:25:27] selection that god just went down he
[1:25:29] said any meanie mighty mo i'm going to
[1:25:31] pick this one to predestinate them i'm
[1:25:33] going to not
[1:25:33] save this one but god didn't just do
[1:25:35] random selection but
[1:25:37] god looked down through time and he knew
[1:25:39] the attribute he knew the predestinated
[1:25:41] seed in
[1:25:42] jacob and if you or i had been sitting
[1:25:44] there and seeing jacob and esau in
[1:25:46] church brother branham said
[1:25:47] you would have much preferred esau to
[1:25:49] have been a church member in your church
[1:25:51] my he took care of his daddy and he was
[1:25:54] a good man no doubt he paid tithes and
[1:25:56] he came and
[1:25:57] he worked hard and he was always trying
[1:25:59] to do something to help and
[1:26:00] and here's jacob a little scheister a
[1:26:03] little deceiver
[1:26:04] going about trying to get the birthright
[1:26:05] any way that he could but god looks down
[1:26:07] he says i loved this one
[1:26:09] and i hated that one it shows that god
[1:26:12] knew what their end was going to be
[1:26:13] and that he wasn't just looking at the
[1:26:15] moment you know satan
[1:26:16] will try to get you my i don't know
[1:26:18] maybe he doesn't you but he will me
[1:26:20] and i know he does he did paul and david
[1:26:22] and different ones down through history
[1:26:24] he will focus in on the very worst
[1:26:26] moment in your life
[1:26:28] the very worst mistake that you ever
[1:26:30] made and when you begin to talk to the
[1:26:32] devil he'll want to bring that up all
[1:26:34] the time and he'll want you to focus on
[1:26:35] that
[1:26:36] the very weakest moment no doubt paul
[1:26:38] would wake up in a cold sweat sometimes
[1:26:40] and
[1:26:41] and have nightmares of those men taking
[1:26:44] and stoning stephen
[1:26:45] and him saying here let me let me hold
[1:26:47] your coat for you so you can get a
[1:26:48] little bit bigger rock and no doubt
[1:26:50] david sometimes
[1:26:51] would sit up in bed in a cold sweat and
[1:26:53] think about sending uriah out there to
[1:26:55] the battlefield to hide his own sin
[1:26:57] and telling his men draw back from him
[1:27:00] and let those men come and kill him
[1:27:02] and no doubt those things would haunt
[1:27:03] those men and the devil would come and
[1:27:05] throw those things in their face
[1:27:07] but god was not focusing on their worst
[1:27:09] moment in fact
[1:27:10] god once it was under the blood god
[1:27:12] couldn't even remember their worst
[1:27:14] moment
[1:27:14] i find it so interesting that god knows
[1:27:17] my future but there's things in my past
[1:27:19] that he can't even remember
[1:27:22] amen that's a conundrum
[1:27:26] god remembers your future you don't
[1:27:29] remember your future but god does
[1:27:31] but he can't remember pieces of your
[1:27:33] past oh i don't know how many is here
[1:27:35] old enough to remember the
[1:27:36] the cassette recordings you know we've
[1:27:38] got some that are old enough to remember
[1:27:39] the reel-to-reel recordings but
[1:27:41] uh but you know before mp3s for some of
[1:27:44] you young people we had this thing
[1:27:45] called
[1:27:46] cassettes and you'd put them in the tape
[1:27:47] player and it was magnetic it would
[1:27:49] record and
[1:27:50] and you'd put the little cassette player
[1:27:52] in there and if you got the the tape
[1:27:53] from
[1:27:54] from voice of god there you'd come on
[1:27:56] and if they if they broke into the
[1:27:57] sermon a little late because the men
[1:27:59] hadn't put the tape on in time or
[1:28:00] because it had been a part one to part
[1:28:02] two and they'd lost part one somewhere
[1:28:04] along the way
[1:28:04] there was a man from jeffersonville by
[1:28:06] the name of tom cannell and brother tom
[1:28:08] would come on there and he'd say now the
[1:28:10] tape that you're about to hear is
[1:28:11] incomplete
[1:28:12] and every attempt has been made to find
[1:28:14] the missing portion of this tape
[1:28:16] and any assistance that you can give us
[1:28:18] would be appreciated i don't know about
[1:28:19] you
[1:28:20] but you know we won't be at the great
[1:28:21] white throne judgment because
[1:28:23] the bride's already judged but if
[1:28:24] there's anything that's played about me
[1:28:26] you know brother brandon said we'd have
[1:28:27] a screen that would come down and they'd
[1:28:29] play
[1:28:29] if there's anything played about my life
[1:28:31] brother david there'll have to be an
[1:28:32] angel or somebody that'll come on at the
[1:28:34] beginning of it see now the film that
[1:28:36] you're about to see
[1:28:38] is incomplete
[1:28:41] we searched all over we searched into
[1:28:45] the sea of forgetfulness and we've
[1:28:46] searched everywhere
[1:28:47] but there's portions of this tape that
[1:28:50] are missing
[1:28:51] it's an incomplete tape and god will say
[1:28:53] i don't even remember it satan the
[1:28:55] accuser will come up and he'll say now
[1:28:56] wait a minute brother so-and-so
[1:28:58] you know brother jay there was things
[1:29:00] that you did and he'll try to accuse you
[1:29:02] and he'll try to take it before the
[1:29:03] father and say father why don't you
[1:29:05] strike him dead don't you remember the
[1:29:07] things he did and god would say
[1:29:08] i don't know what you're talking about i
[1:29:11] can't remember what you're talking about
[1:29:14] and so many times satan beats us up
[1:29:17] about things that god can't even
[1:29:19] remember
[1:29:21] oh my i don't know about you i don't
[1:29:23] want to waste my time on something god
[1:29:24] can't remember
[1:29:31] god has a file on me he has a file on
[1:29:35] you
[1:29:36] but there are some things that have been
[1:29:37] redacted from that file
[1:29:40] he didn't just take a black marker and
[1:29:41] write over it where you could kind of
[1:29:43] squint and hold it up to light and try
[1:29:44] to see through it but he absolutely
[1:29:46] erased it brother bam said it's like
[1:29:47] clorox bleach
[1:29:48] that you take a bathtub full of clorox
[1:29:50] bleach and you take one little ink drop
[1:29:52] and drop it in there and he said you try
[1:29:54] to find where it's at
[1:29:55] it even goes back to the original
[1:29:57] chemicals to where it's not even ink
[1:29:58] anymore
[1:29:59] but it reverts it back to the original
[1:30:01] chemicals and brother branham said that
[1:30:03] satan
[1:30:03] when he comes and tries to get you to
[1:30:05] sin and then you go and you say father i
[1:30:07] didn't mean to do that and you place
[1:30:09] that in the blood of jesus he said then
[1:30:11] it goes back to the original chemicals
[1:30:13] and god takes your sin and places it
[1:30:15] back on the devil where it belongs
[1:30:19] oh praise the lord god's great detective
[1:30:23] knows all about it brother man said in
[1:30:24] questions and answers part 3 1964
[1:30:27] god takes a picture of you he's got a
[1:30:30] picture of me in his file brother
[1:30:32] jackson
[1:30:33] oh my i'm glad he didn't take it you
[1:30:35] know in my current stage
[1:30:39] i believe my predestinated image has a
[1:30:41] few less pounds on it than i have right
[1:30:43] now
[1:30:44] he said god takes a picture of you and
[1:30:45] he goes down about a paragraph later and
[1:30:47] he says now
[1:30:48] this picture was not taken when you was
[1:30:50] 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best
[1:30:53] when was it taken
[1:30:54] before there was a foundation of the
[1:30:56] world it was put in
[1:30:58] god's great file and then only thing it
[1:31:01] did was featured itself here
[1:31:04] for you to make your choice and god goes
[1:31:07] to his filing cabinet and gets out
[1:31:09] before there was ever a world created he
[1:31:11] goes into his family album
[1:31:12] and he gets out a folder and he opens it
[1:31:14] up and he looks and there's nathan
[1:31:16] bryant
[1:31:18] there's david mcgeary there's there's
[1:31:20] all these different brothers look here
[1:31:23] and the angel said i don't understand
[1:31:26] there's there's nobody that even looks
[1:31:27] like this there's not even a creature
[1:31:29] that looks like this he said i know but
[1:31:31] this is just a picture i
[1:31:32] took from my thinking it's one of my
[1:31:34] attributes
[1:31:35] and it's going to be in this age or it's
[1:31:37] going to be in that age i've got one of
[1:31:38] moses so i've got one of david and
[1:31:40] there wasn't even a david or a moses
[1:31:42] there i've got one my you know a
[1:31:44] polaroid picture you just have to take
[1:31:46] it you'd have to
[1:31:46] wait for it to develop and you just
[1:31:48] shake it and blow on it and everything
[1:31:49] like that and
[1:31:50] and you know it might take two or three
[1:31:51] minutes before it was fully developed
[1:31:53] but
[1:31:53] god out there millions of years ago in
[1:31:56] his thinking
[1:31:57] had a picture of you in his mind but it
[1:31:59] may have taken three million years from
[1:32:00] the time
[1:32:01] that he was thinking of you for you to
[1:32:03] develop here now we know it was longer
[1:32:05] than that because it was out in eternity
[1:32:07] just to give us some concept of time
[1:32:09] with it you know
[1:32:10] millions of years later then you come on
[1:32:12] the earth and you
[1:32:14] came not as a as a grown adult brother
[1:32:15] bam said men aren't born men they're
[1:32:17] born babies
[1:32:17] and so you came into this world as a
[1:32:19] little bitty baby but that wasn't the
[1:32:21] picture that god had of you
[1:32:22] and then you got to about your best
[1:32:24] physically at 21 23 somewhere in there
[1:32:26] 18 years old somewhere
[1:32:28] and and god saw you at your best but
[1:32:30] that still wasn't the picture that god
[1:32:32] took of you because you came through the
[1:32:33] fall
[1:32:34] and there were things in your life maybe
[1:32:36] physically maybe emotionally
[1:32:38] maybe spiritually there were scars and
[1:32:40] things that that was not exactly what he
[1:32:42] had
[1:32:42] but he was getting you into a condition
[1:32:45] to where he could bring you to that
[1:32:47] place that he already had in his
[1:32:48] thinking of you
[1:32:49] before the foundation of the world
[1:32:52] oh my he had a great filing cabinet this
[1:32:54] great detective did
[1:32:56] and he knew all about you he knew what
[1:32:58] your choices would be
[1:32:59] and i don't know about you but if we put
[1:33:01] all of my choices up here on the screen
[1:33:02] this morning
[1:33:03] there'd be some lousy ones that i'd be
[1:33:05] ashamed for you to look at
[1:33:06] that if we put all my decisions and all
[1:33:08] of my faults
[1:33:09] faults and every thought that i've had
[1:33:11] for the last 20 years up here there'd be
[1:33:12] some things that
[1:33:13] that would really make me ashamed and
[1:33:15] embarrassed but don't sit there and look
[1:33:16] at me like angels there'd be things that
[1:33:18] you wouldn't want up here either
[1:33:19] but the thing that that is surprising i
[1:33:21] guess as you know
[1:33:22] when we think of it intellectually the
[1:33:24] thing that's surprising to me
[1:33:25] is god knew all of those things and he
[1:33:28] still said
[1:33:29] jacob have i loved and esau have i hated
[1:33:33] jacob probably had a lot more things up
[1:33:34] there to show than esau did
[1:33:36] but he looked down through time and he
[1:33:37] saw a quality in
[1:33:39] jacob a predestinated seed that it
[1:33:41] didn't matter what he had to do
[1:33:43] he loved that birthright and he was
[1:33:45] going to get to that birthright why was
[1:33:46] it because believers just believe
[1:33:49] we've wasted a lot of time trying to
[1:33:51] convince beli
[1:33:52] trying to convince unbelievers to
[1:33:54] believe they'll never do it you can't
[1:33:56] make an unbeliever believe you might
[1:33:57] convince them to be a make-believer for
[1:33:59] a little while
[1:34:00] but you'll never make them a believer
[1:34:02] because there's nothing in there well
[1:34:03] how do you know who's who brother nathan
[1:34:05] well you don't you just keep
[1:34:06] sowing the words sowing the word but
[1:34:08] don't i don't i don't come and preach to
[1:34:10] unbelievers and i don't come and preach
[1:34:12] to make believers
[1:34:13] i come and preach to the bride and the
[1:34:14] bride will catch it and
[1:34:16] you know if the unbeliever wants to tag
[1:34:17] around the and the make-believer wants
[1:34:19] to tag around
[1:34:20] the word will eventually stake them off
[1:34:22] but the bride will catch the word and
[1:34:24] say
[1:34:24] this is what i've been looking for
[1:34:28] oh my
[1:34:32] chronicles chapter 17 and verse 16
[1:34:36] david had a plan that he looked around
[1:34:39] he saw that
[1:34:40] god had allowed him to build a house of
[1:34:41] cedar to live in and he
[1:34:43] he saw all the great things that god had
[1:34:44] blessed him with and he had a desire in
[1:34:46] his heart to build
[1:34:47] a tabernacle for god that the ark of the
[1:34:50] covenant could sit in that the people
[1:34:51] could come and worship and
[1:34:53] he wanted to build a temple and he goes
[1:34:55] to nathan the prophet and he tells him
[1:34:56] this plan and this desire
[1:34:58] and and it says that nathan said go
[1:35:02] and do all that is in thine heart but
[1:35:04] you see there was a difference
[1:35:05] between nathan speaking and god speaking
[1:35:07] well amen we could just stop and preach
[1:35:09] that this morning it's the same thing
[1:35:10] this morning there's a difference in me
[1:35:12] speaking
[1:35:13] and god speaking there's a difference in
[1:35:14] a man getting up and sharing his opinion
[1:35:16] and there's a difference in god giving
[1:35:18] the word and showing that it backs up
[1:35:21] with the word
[1:35:22] and that it dovetails with the word
[1:35:23] there's a great difference so nathan
[1:35:24] tells him
[1:35:25] go and do all that's in that heart but
[1:35:27] that night nathan goes back to his house
[1:35:28] and he begins to pray
[1:35:29] and he gets to thus saith the lord for
[1:35:31] david and he comes back and he tells
[1:35:34] david look
[1:35:35] god told me to tell you that he drew you
[1:35:38] from the sheep coat and he's made you
[1:35:40] gave you a name liken to great men and
[1:35:42] like unto great names and
[1:35:44] and but you're a man of war and that you
[1:35:46] can't build this temple
[1:35:48] but that there's gonna be a son that is
[1:35:50] coming and this son
[1:35:51] god is actually gonna call him his son
[1:35:54] and this son that is coming he's going
[1:35:56] to build the temple
[1:35:57] and not only that but god is never this
[1:35:59] man's going to make mistakes now
[1:36:00] god didn't get into all this with david
[1:36:02] but i'm just giving you a little bit of
[1:36:03] insight here
[1:36:04] this man is going to make mistakes this
[1:36:06] man on a backslide
[1:36:07] this man is going to let some of his
[1:36:09] wives uh sway him
[1:36:11] from the true worship of god and get him
[1:36:13] into a backslidden condition
[1:36:14] but god's also going to allow him to
[1:36:16] write a big portion of the bible
[1:36:18] and god is also going to say in his word
[1:36:20] to david
[1:36:21] that he would never let his mercies
[1:36:23] leave solomon
[1:36:25] now solomon had not been born yet but
[1:36:27] god was showing david some of these
[1:36:29] things that were to be
[1:36:30] modern events made clear by prophecy we
[1:36:32] would call it today or
[1:36:33] things that are to be and god's giving
[1:36:35] him a glimpse into the future here and
[1:36:36] david in verse 16 of first chronicles 17
[1:36:39] says
[1:36:39] david the king came and sat before the
[1:36:41] lord and said who am i
[1:36:43] o lord god and what is mine house that
[1:36:45] thou has brought me hither to
[1:36:47] and yet this was a small thing in thine
[1:36:50] eyes o god
[1:36:51] for thou has also spoken of thy
[1:36:53] servant's house
[1:36:54] for a great while to come in other words
[1:36:57] you're not just telling me
[1:36:58] what the morning newspaper says about
[1:37:00] yesterday's events
[1:37:02] but you're revealing what's going to
[1:37:03] happen for a great while to come
[1:37:06] that you're revealing what it's going to
[1:37:07] be for my family in the future and has
[1:37:09] regarded me according to this state
[1:37:11] of a man of high degree o lord what a
[1:37:14] what a thing it was for david to
[1:37:16] recognize that god
[1:37:17] did not just know about his past but god
[1:37:20] knew about his future
[1:37:22] you realize what an assurance that
[1:37:23] should give to us as believers
[1:37:26] we don't know what tomorrow holds but we
[1:37:28] certainly know who holds tomorrow
[1:37:32] and god when you know when they came out
[1:37:34] and said that coronavirus had hit our
[1:37:36] country
[1:37:36] god did not wring his hands he wasn't
[1:37:38] shocked he you know he wasn't shocked
[1:37:40] off the throne
[1:37:41] he wasn't devastated uh he he didn't
[1:37:44] have to come up with a new plan and a
[1:37:45] new atonement
[1:37:46] oh my well uh the blood of jesus isn't
[1:37:48] strong enough for coronavirus so we're
[1:37:50] going to have to come up with a
[1:37:51] with a new a vaccine or something to to
[1:37:53] try to be able to heal this you know
[1:37:55] what
[1:37:55] same god that can heal cancer can heal
[1:37:56] coronavirus
[1:38:00] oh man i know that's not popular but you
[1:38:02] know the blood of jesus
[1:38:03] cleanses men from all sins and if it
[1:38:05] cleans men from all sins
[1:38:06] he said also i'm the lord that healeth
[1:38:08] all thy diseases
[1:38:10] a double l they haven't come up with a
[1:38:13] new one ebola
[1:38:14] or aids or anything they haven't come up
[1:38:16] with any new virus
[1:38:17] that doesn't fit into the category of
[1:38:19] all
[1:38:21] i'm the lord that healeth all thy
[1:38:23] diseases
[1:38:24] oh my why should i be discouraged the
[1:38:27] song said
[1:38:28] his eye is on the sparrow and he watches
[1:38:30] over me
[1:38:32] he's watching over me brother david he
[1:38:34] knows what my end will be he knows what
[1:38:36] my outcome will be he knows his thoughts
[1:38:38] of me his thoughts are higher than my
[1:38:40] thoughts
[1:38:40] he can figure out things way in advance
[1:38:42] further than i can and all of our
[1:38:43] efforts
[1:38:44] and all of our good works and everything
[1:38:46] that we're doing if we don't just give
[1:38:47] it into the hands of god and say god you
[1:38:49] take control
[1:38:50] you'll be headed in the wrong direction
[1:38:52] because he looks and he sees
[1:38:54] he doesn't just see tomorrow he sees 10
[1:38:56] years from now
[1:38:57] and sometimes we go through things and
[1:38:58] in the present moment it seems like a
[1:39:00] trial
[1:39:01] and it seems like just a terrible
[1:39:03] situation and we think god
[1:39:04] how can romans 8 28 be true in the face
[1:39:06] of this i want to say this morning
[1:39:08] romans 8 28 is true in the face of any
[1:39:10] circumstance
[1:39:12] in the face of it you say oh brother
[1:39:13] nathan you just don't know what i'm
[1:39:14] going through no i do not but jesus did
[1:39:17] before he ever placed it in paul's heart
[1:39:19] to write those words
[1:39:20] all things work together for good i like
[1:39:23] that when when the scripture says that
[1:39:24] word all
[1:39:25] it just encompasses everything and
[1:39:27] everybody he didn't just say they work
[1:39:29] good
[1:39:30] all things work together for good for
[1:39:31] the prophet all things work together for
[1:39:33] good for the pastors but all things work
[1:39:35] together for good
[1:39:36] to them that love the lord and are
[1:39:39] called according to his purpose that
[1:39:40] means i get to
[1:39:41] write my name right in there and say it
[1:39:44] may not look good but it's working for
[1:39:46] my good
[1:39:47] because god sees way down to the end of
[1:39:50] the line and he knows what we have need
[1:39:52] of
[1:39:52] to get us into a condition for whatever
[1:39:54] lies ahead david
[1:39:55] when the lion and the bear came it
[1:39:57] didn't look good it didn't look good for
[1:39:59] david here i've got to go out and none
[1:40:01] of the other shepherds have
[1:40:02] troubles that i have here i never hear
[1:40:04] any any uh
[1:40:06] wolf killing or line killing or bear
[1:40:08] killing stories from them
[1:40:09] they never have any problems with their
[1:40:11] flocks but here every time i turn around
[1:40:13] there's a lion or a bear and i got to
[1:40:14] get out my old slingshot again
[1:40:16] seemed like a trial seemed like a
[1:40:18] problem but god was preparing him
[1:40:20] because he knew there was a giant
[1:40:22] coming down the road and he had to build
[1:40:24] this man's faith and train him on the
[1:40:26] back side of the desert to a fake
[1:40:28] a spot where when he faced saul he said
[1:40:29] don't let any man's
[1:40:31] heart fail him for fear a lion and a
[1:40:33] bear came in and tried to take my sheep
[1:40:35] and god
[1:40:36] rose me up and anointed me and i slew
[1:40:38] him and the same god that would do that
[1:40:40] can defeat some circumcised philistine
[1:40:43] amen maybe you've got giants in your
[1:40:46] life this morning that you're facing you
[1:40:48] don't see any way over it around it or
[1:40:49] under it
[1:40:50] it seems like an impossible situation
[1:40:51] but let's go back in our memory a little
[1:40:54] bit and remember last year
[1:40:55] that impossible situation that we
[1:40:57] couldn't figure out any way around or
[1:40:59] over under that god brought us through
[1:41:01] and remember five years ago when he was
[1:41:03] sick and the doctor gave you up
[1:41:04] and you didn't think there was any way
[1:41:05] around it and god brought you through
[1:41:07] and i remember ten years ago when he
[1:41:09] wasn't even serving the lord and your
[1:41:10] family had gave up on you and the church
[1:41:12] had gave up on you and
[1:41:13] everybody in the message that gave up on
[1:41:15] you and then god got a hold of that
[1:41:17] predestinated seed and began to work on
[1:41:19] you
[1:41:19] and it looked impossible to everybody
[1:41:21] else that you'd ever serve the lord
[1:41:23] but god did it well that same god that
[1:41:24] did all that back there
[1:41:26] if he could bring you through the lion
[1:41:28] and he could bring you through the bear
[1:41:29] he can bring you through whatever giant
[1:41:31] you're facing this morning
[1:41:33] same god amen just as mighty this
[1:41:37] morning as he ever was still hebrews 13
[1:41:39] 8 he hasn't got any weaker
[1:41:44] the blood of jesus christ doesn't have
[1:41:45] an expiration date it doesn't get weaker
[1:41:47] with age
[1:41:49] oh my same jesus this morning
[1:41:53] that brought you through the last time
[1:41:55] can bring you through this time
[1:41:57] david recognizes this and he says in
[1:41:59] psalms 139 verse 1
[1:42:02] oh lord thou hast searched me and known
[1:42:05] me this is again this hebrew word that
[1:42:06] means investigated
[1:42:08] lord thou hast searched me and known me
[1:42:11] thou knowest my down sitting and mine
[1:42:14] uprising now understand it's my thought
[1:42:16] of far off in other words before i even
[1:42:18] think it
[1:42:19] you know about it you understand what my
[1:42:22] thoughts are going to be before i even
[1:42:23] have them
[1:42:24] thou understand it's my thought afar off
[1:42:26] thou compasses
[1:42:27] my path and my lying down and art
[1:42:29] acquainted with all my ways oh my
[1:42:33] for there is no word in my tongue but lo
[1:42:36] o lord thou knowest it all together
[1:42:38] he knows when you're gossiping he knows
[1:42:40] when you're on social media running
[1:42:42] somebody down
[1:42:43] he knows when you're talking about the
[1:42:44] word he knows when you're talking about
[1:42:46] whatever it is that you're
[1:42:47] you're focusing your time on there's not
[1:42:49] a word that comes out of your mouth that
[1:42:50] he doesn't know about
[1:42:51] there's not a thought that goes through
[1:42:53] your mind that he doesn't know about
[1:42:54] and not only that he knew what it was
[1:42:56] going to be before there was ever an
[1:42:57] earth for you to be on
[1:43:00] thou has beset me behind and before
[1:43:04] and laid thine hand upon me now you
[1:43:06] remember when the hebrew children were
[1:43:08] coming out of egypt and they got
[1:43:10] up there against the red sea and they
[1:43:12] were being led by a pillar of fire
[1:43:14] at night and by a cloud by day and they
[1:43:16] come up against the red sea and now
[1:43:17] pharaoh's army is behind them and
[1:43:19] there's mountains on either side of them
[1:43:21] and there's no way of escape it looks
[1:43:22] like but moses
[1:43:24] stands there and he says stand still and
[1:43:27] see the salvation of the lord now we get
[1:43:29] worked up when we get in a situation
[1:43:30] like this
[1:43:31] and we wring our hands and we begin to
[1:43:32] worry and we begin to fret but moses
[1:43:34] told them just stand
[1:43:36] still and see the salvation of the lord
[1:43:38] if there's any advice i could give you
[1:43:39] this morning
[1:43:40] whatever battle that you're facing stand
[1:43:43] still
[1:43:43] and see the salvation of the lord he's
[1:43:45] great in battle he's mighty the bible
[1:43:47] said he's a man of war
[1:43:49] he's a mighty in battle and so they got
[1:43:51] up against the red sea
[1:43:52] and there's no way for them to go but
[1:43:54] then here comes around
[1:43:55] it becomes a cloud to the egyptians and
[1:43:58] a pillar of fire you know we said we had
[1:44:00] that in our age too there was a cloud
[1:44:02] and a pillar of fire that was following
[1:44:04] a vindicated message and i know that
[1:44:05] they make fun of it today but well
[1:44:07] i just happen to believe it i'm thankful
[1:44:11] for churches that aren't ashamed still
[1:44:12] to
[1:44:13] have pictures like that up in them i
[1:44:14] know there's a lot of churches taking
[1:44:16] them down but
[1:44:16] i don't preach at those churches anymore
[1:44:18] because god didn't call me to preach
[1:44:20] to unbelievers amen when they take them
[1:44:23] down i want to write them and say hey
[1:44:24] send them to me i'll put some more up
[1:44:27] i said that'll offend somebody well if
[1:44:29] it offends them they need to be offended
[1:44:30] somebody said you mean you'd have a
[1:44:32] picture
[1:44:32] of a man in your church oh you just
[1:44:35] didn't look high enough
[1:44:36] you just didn't look high enough that
[1:44:38] was the problem with the pentecostals
[1:44:39] they didn't look high enough they were
[1:44:41] looking at the man
[1:44:42] but we looked a little higher and saw
[1:44:43] what was hanging above the man
[1:44:46] amen somebody said you mean you follow a
[1:44:48] man yes i do if i'd been a noah's day i
[1:44:50] would have followed a man
[1:44:51] right up the plank into the boat
[1:44:54] if i was in moses's day i would have
[1:44:56] followed a man right out of egypt
[1:44:58] because it wasn't the flesh of the man
[1:45:01] that i was following
[1:45:02] it was what he was following is what i
[1:45:04] was following
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:07] and he was before them and behind them
[1:45:10] and it became the very word that god
[1:45:11] sent
[1:45:12] became darkness to the egyptian
[1:45:13] brotherhood said it always
[1:45:15] blinds the eyes of one and opens the
[1:45:17] eyes of the other
[1:45:19] and it becomes a it becomes a message of
[1:45:21] deliverance to one
[1:45:22] and it becomes a message of judgment to
[1:45:24] those that were rejected
[1:45:25] and here it blinded the egyptians behind
[1:45:28] them
[1:45:29] and shown a path for the israelites to
[1:45:31] see to cross over on dry land
[1:45:33] and we put that back as a little you
[1:45:34] know a little bible story that
[1:45:36] we tell in sunday school we read the
[1:45:38] kitties before bed but this same god
[1:45:40] david said
[1:45:40] was before him and behind him
[1:45:44] we're compassed about with a great army
[1:45:47] of witnesses this morning
[1:45:48] we're compassed about to where if we
[1:45:50] could look like god allowed gehaza
[1:45:52] elisha stood there one day and hazel
[1:45:54] wrote his head he said oh we're
[1:45:55] surrounded
[1:45:56] oh my there's riots on this side and
[1:45:58] there's coronavirus on this side and
[1:46:00] there's political trouble on that side
[1:46:02] and there's message politics on this
[1:46:04] side and we're surrounded
[1:46:05] elijah said oh god just open up that
[1:46:07] open up that spiritual image to a young
[1:46:09] man's eyes and
[1:46:10] let him look around and see and he
[1:46:12] recognized he was surrounded
[1:46:14] but it was a great host of god's army
[1:46:16] that had surrounded them
[1:46:18] and there was more with them than there
[1:46:19] was with him because god said the angels
[1:46:21] of god
[1:46:22] and camp around those that fear him i'm
[1:46:24] surrounded all right but in a good way
[1:46:27] in fact my enemies are surrounded by
[1:46:30] what's surrounding me
[1:46:33] oh my
[1:46:36] thou has beset behind me and before and
[1:46:39] laid thine hand upon me
[1:46:41] such knowledge is too wonderful me for
[1:46:43] me it is high i cannot attain
[1:46:45] unto it whither shall i go from thy
[1:46:47] spirit or whither
[1:46:49] shall i flee from thy presence if i
[1:46:51] ascend into heaven that are there
[1:46:53] if i make my bed in hell behold thou art
[1:46:55] there jonah found this out one time
[1:46:58] he was running from god and he ran to
[1:47:00] tarshish and god was there he ran from
[1:47:02] joppa and god was there
[1:47:04] he ran into the boat and god was there
[1:47:05] he went into the belly of the boat and
[1:47:07] god was there he went to the ocean and
[1:47:08] god was there and then the fish
[1:47:10] swallowed him and went to the bottom of
[1:47:11] the ocean
[1:47:12] and god was there he said if i hide
[1:47:13] underneath the rocks underneath the
[1:47:15] mountains
[1:47:16] where would i go where you're not at god
[1:47:18] maybe there's some jonas this morning
[1:47:20] but
[1:47:20] my god has got you right where he wants
[1:47:23] you
[1:47:25] jonah thought he was running from god
[1:47:26] but god had jonah right where he wanted
[1:47:29] him
[1:47:29] to where when he came up out of that
[1:47:31] fish and god would give him some time to
[1:47:33] sit down there
[1:47:33] oh some people say all this message that
[1:47:35] you follow it's unscientific
[1:47:37] they apparently have not read this book
[1:47:41] they say the message is unscientific you
[1:47:43] go back to the story of jonah and the
[1:47:45] story of the three hebrew children i
[1:47:46] don't know of anything more in
[1:47:47] scientific than those two stories
[1:47:49] but i believe it with everything that's
[1:47:50] within me
[1:47:52] amen explain to me by science how fish
[1:47:55] swallowed jonah he went to the bottom of
[1:47:56] the ocean
[1:47:57] for three days and three nights with no
[1:47:59] oxygen tent with nothing down there
[1:48:01] and god protected him some degree
[1:48:03] weathers down there you think texas is
[1:48:05] called this morning
[1:48:06] it was colder in the bottom of the
[1:48:07] whale's belly down there and
[1:48:09] god protected him and brought him up and
[1:48:11] he walks off the gangplank
[1:48:12] to a group of people that worship dagan
[1:48:14] the fish god
[1:48:15] and they said oh goodness this man must
[1:48:17] be a prophet
[1:48:19] god knows what he's doing somebody said
[1:48:22] i can't
[1:48:23] i can't believe this message i i don't
[1:48:25] have enough scientific evidence we have
[1:48:27] more scientific evidence in this age
[1:48:29] than any other age if they couldn't
[1:48:30] believe in this age there's no way they
[1:48:32] could believe in moses's age
[1:48:34] we have a picture of the pillar of fire
[1:48:36] but moses just came out and said
[1:48:37] i saw a bush burning and it didn't
[1:48:40] consume
[1:48:40] and god spoke to me out did you get a
[1:48:42] recording of his voice moses
[1:48:44] no did you get a picture of the of the
[1:48:46] of the pillar of fire did you
[1:48:48] get a sample of it no you're just going
[1:48:50] to have to take my word for it
[1:48:52] well if you want to deliver it enough
[1:48:53] you'd take a vindicated prophet of god's
[1:48:55] word for it if i take the wings of the
[1:49:01] morning and dwell in the uttermost parts
[1:49:02] of the sea
[1:49:03] even there shall thy hand lead me and
[1:49:05] thy right hand shall hold me
[1:49:06] if i say surely the darkness shall cover
[1:49:08] me even the night shall be light about
[1:49:10] me
[1:49:11] yea the darkness hideth not from thee
[1:49:13] but the night shineth is the day the
[1:49:15] darkness and the light
[1:49:16] are alike to thee and he goes down in
[1:49:18] verse 23 and he says search me o god
[1:49:20] and know my heart try me and know my
[1:49:22] thoughts and see
[1:49:24] if there be any wicked way in me and
[1:49:26] lead me
[1:49:27] in the way everlasting
[1:49:31] my let me break into this age for a
[1:49:33] little bit and read you a few quotes of
[1:49:35] what god did
[1:49:36] this great detective the holy spirit
[1:49:40] what he did in this age
[1:49:44] the unchangeable god working in an
[1:49:45] unexpectable way 1962.
[1:49:49] he says the holy spirit can go back down
[1:49:51] through your life and tell you what you
[1:49:52] was
[1:49:54] and you know whether that's true or not
[1:49:56] well if you know
[1:49:58] and know that's the truth then surely
[1:50:00] you could believe what he tells you
[1:50:02] will come to pass this is what was
[1:50:05] taking place god was getting a man and a
[1:50:07] channel
[1:50:07] where he could take him down one
[1:50:08] dimension and look back into the past
[1:50:11] and then he could take him and show him
[1:50:13] forward what was going to be he could
[1:50:14] take and look back and say now i see you
[1:50:16] in a little checkered dress as a little
[1:50:18] girl and you run up on a porch
[1:50:20] because you're being chased by a yellow
[1:50:21] dog and because of that you've been
[1:50:23] nervous
[1:50:24] your whole life
[1:50:27] and he said but i see i see it get light
[1:50:29] around you
[1:50:30] well if he could tell him what had
[1:50:31] happened way back there that maybe
[1:50:33] they'd even forgot about
[1:50:35] and said oh goodness i forgot all about
[1:50:37] that brother branham
[1:50:38] but he could look way back in their
[1:50:39] subconscious and see that down through
[1:50:41] time
[1:50:41] and then he could tell him what they
[1:50:42] were going to be well if this man can
[1:50:44] tell me remember the woman at the well
[1:50:45] she dropped her water pot and ran in the
[1:50:47] city and said behold a man who's told me
[1:50:49] all the things that i've done
[1:50:53] the true easter seal 1961 i never seen
[1:50:56] you in my life you're a stranger to me
[1:50:58] i know nothing about you god does know
[1:51:00] you and if he can reveal to me by his
[1:51:03] holy spirit the resurrected christ who
[1:51:05] come here
[1:51:06] and give me listen to this a temporarily
[1:51:08] resurrection by my
[1:51:10] spirit that my spirit goes away now
[1:51:13] and his spirit comes in then to let you
[1:51:16] know whether he's alive or not now i
[1:51:18] don't know you that's me and my spirit
[1:51:21] we don't know you but he knows you
[1:51:24] but he wants to borrow my body to prove
[1:51:27] that he's the resurrected christ
[1:51:29] he said i'm so happy to loan it to him
[1:51:31] give it to him
[1:51:32] anything he can get out of it he says in
[1:51:36] anointed ones at the end time he said i
[1:51:37] think the where where the people can't
[1:51:39] get it separated they still can't get it
[1:51:40] separated brother david
[1:51:42] he said they can't realize that the
[1:51:43] angel of the seventh angel
[1:51:45] is not the son of man he said i wasn't
[1:51:47] the one that spoke down there on the
[1:51:49] river
[1:51:49] i was only standing near when he spoke
[1:51:52] i'm not the one that says these things
[1:51:54] i'm only the one that's standing near
[1:51:56] they can't get it separated i sat with
[1:51:57] the brother at a picnic table a few
[1:51:58] years ago
[1:51:59] and he wanted to tell me that brother
[1:52:00] branham was the son of man i said well
[1:52:02] if he was physically the man the flesh
[1:52:04] of him was i said he said he was the
[1:52:05] same in every way
[1:52:06] except the physical body i said that's
[1:52:08] right except the physical body
[1:52:10] it was the ministry was the same not the
[1:52:13] man i said if the man was the same then
[1:52:15] we need to bow down like
[1:52:16] abraham didn't call him elohim but it
[1:52:18] wasn't the man
[1:52:19] but it was the ministry to where he
[1:52:21] could stand there as helpless as
[1:52:22] helpless could be said
[1:52:23] i don't know you i don't know anything
[1:52:25] about you and then turn around and say i
[1:52:27] take every spirit
[1:52:28] under my control i said now if he was
[1:52:31] if it was him if it was the man that was
[1:52:34] jesus
[1:52:34] then he would remember what he said
[1:52:36] because it was the same personality
[1:52:38] but a separate personality came in and
[1:52:40] took over to where he said now
[1:52:42] now is what he told you the truth well
[1:52:45] if he was the
[1:52:45] if he was the physical man was it then
[1:52:48] why didn't he remember
[1:52:50] but he said god allows me a temporary
[1:52:52] resurrection that my spirit goes
[1:52:54] somewhere else
[1:52:55] so that his spirit can step into this
[1:52:56] vessel
[1:52:58] and he can speak and say this is what
[1:53:00] your doctor said this is what was on
[1:53:02] your chart
[1:53:03] this was and then he would come back and
[1:53:04] say now i don't know what he said i'll
[1:53:06] have to go back and listen
[1:53:07] to the tape but was what he told you the
[1:53:10] truth and even his greatest
[1:53:12] critics it was never wrong one time why
[1:53:15] because it wasn't a man it was god in
[1:53:17] the man
[1:53:18] people want to worship brother branham i
[1:53:19] don't worship brother branham but i
[1:53:20] certainly worship the god that was in
[1:53:22] him
[1:53:23] amen don't get scared this morning that
[1:53:25] same god's on the inside of me
[1:53:27] brother bannon questions and answers who
[1:53:28] did jesus pray to
[1:53:30] in the garden of gethsemane the same one
[1:53:32] that we pray to
[1:53:33] the holy ghost on the inside of him
[1:53:37] amen we pray sometimes like like we're a
[1:53:40] lutheran or something oh
[1:53:41] we're going to pray to god a million
[1:53:42] miles away on a cloud somewhere you
[1:53:44] missed it somewhere
[1:53:46] he's not a million miles away on a cloud
[1:53:48] he's as close to you as your own right
[1:53:50] arm
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:53:53] that's what the day of pentecost was all
[1:53:54] about god coming back
[1:53:56] and veiling himself and human beings
[1:53:58] again so that he could speak through you
[1:54:00] and work through you
[1:54:01] and live through you amen we've got a
[1:54:04] lot of wonderful scriptures the atheist
[1:54:06] has the same king james bible
[1:54:08] king james bible that i have atheists
[1:54:10] around the world have it on their shelf
[1:54:11] and it's doing them no good
[1:54:13] we have a lot of wonderful quotes and
[1:54:15] there's people that have walked away and
[1:54:17] made fun of it that have the exact same
[1:54:18] books from 47 to 65 that i do
[1:54:20] on their shelves and on their cell
[1:54:22] phones and on their tablets and they
[1:54:24] search it and study it sometimes more
[1:54:25] than we do
[1:54:26] because they're trying to find fault and
[1:54:27] trying to criticize it but it won't do
[1:54:29] them any good it won't the word won't do
[1:54:31] the atheist any good
[1:54:32] but when we take the word for it's not
[1:54:34] for well i think it meant that and so
[1:54:36] and so said it meant this and i don't
[1:54:38] know i believe this part but i struggle
[1:54:39] with that part
[1:54:40] but when you take the word and allow it
[1:54:42] to live through you
[1:54:44] brother banham said oh how we need in
[1:54:46] jeffersonville
[1:54:47] thousands of lived voices he said that's
[1:54:49] the thunder that'll shake the devil
[1:54:51] amen satan doesn't care you can quote
[1:54:54] the devil and he won't care very much
[1:54:55] but when he sees a life that's lived
[1:54:57] that backs up the word
[1:54:58] that's when the devil trembles
[1:55:02] my
[1:55:05] sir as we would see jesus 1961
[1:55:09] just a gift sir he tells this man the
[1:55:12] prayer line
[1:55:14] just a gift sir trying to relax myself
[1:55:16] and catch your spirit
[1:55:18] as odd as it might seem i've seen them
[1:55:20] lay people laying dead
[1:55:21] finland three or four different places
[1:55:24] i've seen in my life
[1:55:25] and god would let my spirit so leave me
[1:55:28] till i'd go out into the land and catch
[1:55:30] that spirit and bring it right back
[1:55:33] again to that person
[1:55:34] it's true god in heaven knows it's true
[1:55:38] you want a scripture for that so that
[1:55:39] you don't think well brother bam just
[1:55:40] said that
[1:55:41] luke chapter 20 verse 37 now that the
[1:55:44] dead are raised even moses showed at the
[1:55:46] bush
[1:55:46] when he calleth the lord the god of
[1:55:48] abraham and the god of isaac
[1:55:51] and the god of jacob for he is not a god
[1:55:53] of the dead

[1:58:19] found out hey
[1:58:20] this thing didn't belong to the devil it
[1:58:22] belonged to jesus christ and we're heirs
[1:58:24] with him
[1:58:25] joint heirs with the king and he comes
[1:58:27] and he says devil you don't have no
[1:58:29] right to stay here any longer
[1:58:30] and kicked him out of his own house and
[1:58:32] took the keys to the devil's own house
[1:58:34] it's time to serve eviction notice on
[1:58:36] the devil but we baby him and pet him
[1:58:38] and all my well poor sister so and so
[1:58:40] you know she's got this spirit on her
[1:58:42] well that that you know

[1:58:48] devil his eviction notice
[1:58:50] and say you aren't welcome in my home
[1:58:51] anymore you're not welcome to take over
[1:58:54] my thoughts anymore and get me to dwell
[1:58:55] on things of doubt and unbelief and fear

[1:58:59] anymore i'm applying the token to him
[1:59:02] i'm serving this eviction notice on the
[1:59:04] devil now this word eviction notice if
[1:59:06] you look it up on google it says an
[1:59:07] eviction notice
[1:59:08] is how a landlord gives notice to a
[1:59:11] tenant to vacate
[1:59:12] a certain property the problem is we've
[1:59:15] let him we've let him come and
[1:59:16] and set up shop and just kind of uh you
[1:59:19] know squatters rights just come in and
[1:59:21] well he's been
[1:59:22] you know the tv and those those filthy
[1:59:24] videos have been here so long
[1:59:25] we'll just we'll just let it go and the
[1:59:27] you know the internet we don't have it
[1:59:29] filtered where our kids can go on and
[1:59:30] see any kind of filth they want and he's
[1:59:32] just been here so long you know
[1:59:34] possession is nine tenths of the law
[1:59:36] it's not his house
[1:59:38] kick him out of your house
[1:59:41] serve an eviction notice on him in time
[1:59:43] the landlord is here and gives notice
[1:59:45] that this is not your property
[1:59:47] but we've dedicated this property to him
[1:59:49] and we're here to tell you you have to
[1:59:51] leave satan
[1:59:53] the inside man 1953 and now satan
[1:59:55] brother branham says
[1:59:57] you who've bound her and trying to take
[1:59:59] her to the grave
[2:00:00] yet aged but our god doesn't look at age
[2:00:03] oh somebody said hallelujah
[2:00:07] god doesn't look at age and i come to a
[2:00:10] servant
[2:00:10] i come to serve a warrant on you as a
[2:00:12] representative of calvary
[2:00:14] as god's agent and you cannot stay in
[2:00:17] this house any longer
[2:00:18] you have to move out because as the holy
[2:00:21] spirit the detective of god who's here
[2:00:24] and your secret places are revealed and
[2:00:26] you can't hide any longer
[2:00:29] you know the devil hates to be exposed
[2:00:32] i've seen it in prayer lines you know we
[2:00:35] read it sometimes in quotes but as the
[2:00:36] scripture said i have heard but now i
[2:00:38] see
[2:00:38] i've seen it in prayer lines satan get
[2:00:41] exposed and he absolutely hates it
[2:00:43] sometimes he'll throw a screaming fit
[2:00:45] about it but you know what there's
[2:00:46] something about the devil when you
[2:00:48] expose him
[2:00:48] he is powerless a lot of
[2:00:52] the problem is satan has convinced us
[2:00:54] that all my you better not you better
[2:00:56] not ask for prayer for that or you
[2:00:57] better not confess that to your spouse
[2:00:59] or you better not do this or do that you
[2:01:00] better not tell your parents about that
[2:01:02] why because he likes that control that
[2:01:04] he has over you
[2:01:05] but you expose him one time brother bam
[2:01:07] said you he said
[2:01:08] samson went down there and he said that
[2:01:10] lion that had been trying to kill him he
[2:01:12] just grabbed it and ripped it apart
[2:01:14] and he said he went by a few days later
[2:01:15] and he said there was sweet honey in
[2:01:16] there
[2:01:17] and he said you overcome a temptation
[2:01:19] that you've been struggling with he said
[2:01:20] just overcome that a few times and see
[2:01:22] how much sweeter it gets and how much
[2:01:24] easier it gets
[2:01:25] but the devil says oh you could never
[2:01:27] you could never get victory over that
[2:01:28] well
[2:01:28] he doesn't want you to think that of
[2:01:30] course but he
[2:01:31] he's just uh he's just a tenant that has
[2:01:34] moved in but the landlord has come to
[2:01:35] serve
[2:01:36] him his eviction notice and said satan
[2:01:38] you're not welcome
[2:01:39] in my bride any longer you're not
[2:01:40] welcome to torment her any longer you
[2:01:42] know a lot of times we get sick and we
[2:01:43] just take it for granted well i guess
[2:01:45] this is just
[2:01:46] my this this is just uh my cross to bear
[2:01:49] well the scripture said that he wanted
[2:01:50] to see us prosper in health even as our
[2:01:52] soul prospers
[2:01:54] so i don't believe it's god's will for
[2:01:55] you to be sick
[2:01:57] but we feel sorry for the devil
[2:01:58] sometimes i think i don't feel sorry for
[2:02:00] him
[2:02:01] i like kicking him in the teeth
[2:02:05] oh my god's good isn't he he sent a
[2:02:09] great detective
[2:02:10] that went searching for you he searched
[2:02:12] down through your life he searched down
[2:02:14] through your family back in your great
[2:02:15] great grandfather's you think of all the
[2:02:17] wars and famines and pestilence and
[2:02:19] plagues that spin down through the years
[2:02:21] and god protected your lineage to bring
[2:02:23] you down maybe you had a great
[2:02:25] grandfather in world war one and a
[2:02:27] grandfather in world war
[2:02:28] ii and a father in vietnam and and god
[2:02:30] protected those men were maybe thousands
[2:02:32] of men falling to the left and the right
[2:02:34] but god knew you had to be here this
[2:02:36] morning
[2:02:37] and he knew there was a predestinated
[2:02:38] seed that he was going to bring forth on
[2:02:40] the earth
[2:02:40] and then we get here and the devil says
[2:02:42] oh you'll never make it
[2:02:44] god protected me before i was even here
[2:02:48] brother rahm said if he could do all
[2:02:50] that and bring you to where you're at if
[2:02:52] he could
[2:02:52] bring your parents together through all
[2:02:54] those different lines and bring you here
[2:02:56] without you having any choice in it
[2:02:57] what can he do for you now that you have
[2:03:00] a choice in it
[2:03:02] amen let's bow our heads together
[2:03:06] lord jesus we thank you
[2:03:09] that you searched down through time and
[2:03:11] space and eternity
[2:03:13] and you saw that there'd be a bride in
[2:03:15] this age
[2:03:16] lord we look around we see the challenge
[2:03:19] of the hour
[2:03:20] and it seems almost impossible sometimes
[2:03:23] that
[2:03:24] there would be a bride in this age
[2:03:25] without spot or wrinkle
[2:03:27] but we know that it will be because your
[2:03:29] word promised it
[2:03:30] and we have confidence because we've
[2:03:32] seen your word come to pass
[2:03:34] so many times lord
[2:03:37] and lord we're resting in you this
[2:03:38] morning we thank you that you searched
[2:03:40] down
[2:03:41] and you saw us you saw our weaknesses
[2:03:43] you saw our faults you saw our failures
[2:03:45] and yet you loved us enough to choose us
[2:03:47] anyhow
[2:03:49] god it's beyond anything i deserve it's
[2:03:51] beyond anything i could earn or
[2:03:53] or work my way into but as brother david
[2:03:56] saying this morning it was just
[2:03:57] amazing grace how sweet the sound
[2:04:01] lord maybe there's some sitting here
[2:04:02] this morning in the service or
[2:04:04] maybe they're listening lord at their
[2:04:06] homes here in texas or
[2:04:08] back in indiana at my own home church
[2:04:10] there lord
[2:04:12] they couldn't get out because of the
[2:04:13] weather today and and couldn't make it
[2:04:15] to church because of the icy parking lot
[2:04:17] and maybe some here that
[2:04:18] lived great distances and knowing that
[2:04:20] another storm is coming in
[2:04:22] and not knowing what the roads would be
[2:04:23] like and they're they're sitting there
[2:04:25] in their home lord but wherever they're
[2:04:26] at
[2:04:27] lord i pray that your holy spirit would
[2:04:30] would
[2:04:31] shake their conscience enough to make
[2:04:32] them recognize that god cares for him
[2:04:35] and that he chose them and elected and
[2:04:37] predestinated them before they had any
[2:04:39] choice in it
[2:04:40] and then the devil comes along and tries
[2:04:42] to get us to give up
[2:04:43] because we're not good enough or because
[2:04:45] we made a mistake or
[2:04:47] because we we were discouraged about
[2:04:49] something or somebody said something and
[2:04:51] hurt our feelings oh god
[2:04:53] help us this morning to recognize that
[2:04:55] your great detective is still on the
[2:04:57] case
[2:04:58] and that you know the thoughts of the
[2:04:59] heart that you discern the intents
[2:05:02] and lord that you would send a man by
[2:05:06] lord not just this weekend or myself
[2:05:08] being here but
[2:05:10] lord you place it on brother david's
[2:05:11] heart and the different local minister
[2:05:13] brothers you play
[2:05:14] certain things at certain times on their
[2:05:16] hearts and then you lead different guest
[2:05:18] ministers by their way and
[2:05:19] and say certain things at certain times
[2:05:21] for the need that the person would have
[2:05:23] at that moment or at that specific date
[2:05:25] and time and
[2:05:26] things that are laid in the word for
[2:05:28] years and years and even back in the
[2:05:30] scriptures
[2:05:30] thousands of years some of these things
[2:05:32] have have been written on pages
[2:05:34] and yet a man pick that up because it's
[2:05:37] the eternal word
[2:05:38] and get into a channel where you can
[2:05:40] make it so personal to somebody that's
[2:05:41] sitting here
[2:05:42] something that moses wrote maybe 4 000
[2:05:44] years ago
[2:05:45] god we know that it takes you to do that
[2:05:48] but lord may it bring encouragement to
[2:05:50] them this morning to recognize that you
[2:05:51] care about them
[2:05:52] and that you know their circumstances
[2:05:55] and lord even if they feel like they
[2:05:56] can't go on that lord that's the time
[2:05:58] when you pick us up and you do the
[2:06:00] caring
[2:06:00] lord that's the time when we depend on
[2:06:02] you and i pray that you bring
[2:06:04] encouragement
[2:06:05] and peace to every home lord take away
[2:06:07] any fear or doubt or anxiety
[2:06:10] take away any oppression or depression
[2:06:12] lord that would try to
[2:06:13] torment them in the spiritual realm
[2:06:15] father i pray that you just
[2:06:17] move on the scene and encourage hearts
[2:06:19] and build their faith father i pray and
[2:06:21] strengthen them for the journey that
[2:06:22] they're facing lord each one of us lord
[2:06:24] we're
[2:06:25] we're on slightly different paths lord
[2:06:27] different families and
[2:06:29] different characteristic traits and
[2:06:31] different jobs and
[2:06:32] different walks of life and maybe
[2:06:34] different personalities but lord
[2:06:36] you're guiding us all if we're a
[2:06:37] predestinated seed of god
[2:06:39] to one final destination i pray that
[2:06:41] you'd be with each one
[2:06:43] whatever level of their journey they're
[2:06:44] at maybe they're a new believer that's
[2:06:46] on fire for god or
[2:06:48] maybe they're they're a prodigal son
[2:06:50] that's trying to come back but has ran
[2:06:52] so far that the devil's telling him that
[2:06:54] there's no hope for him lord may you let
[2:06:55] him know this morning that there's still
[2:06:57] hope
[2:06:58] for him if they love jesus that there's
[2:07:00] still hope for him lord and
[2:07:01] father if there's any that maybe they've
[2:07:03] just been stagnant for so long that they
[2:07:05] long to see god moving in their life the
[2:07:07] way that he once did father
[2:07:09] may you just ignite something in them
[2:07:11] may you do a supernatural work that they
[2:07:13] begin to see you everywhere they look
[2:07:15] father like the man that brother branham
[2:07:16] talked about
[2:07:17] said all i've seen is god for the last
[2:07:19] 40 years

[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:34] [Applause]
[2:11:36] everyday
[2:11:37] [Applause]
[2:11:39] amen amen amen you know
[2:11:44] i'm a great believer in giving
[2:11:46] opportunity
[2:11:48] you know something the brother said this
[2:11:49] morning
[2:11:51] really touched my heart
[2:11:54] and it was about god knowing your future
[2:11:57] you know
[2:11:58] i like that because you know we always
[2:11:59] know about going back
[2:12:01] but know your future and
[2:12:04] and you know uh
[2:12:08] one of the greatest things i always want
[2:12:10] for people is for them to have a
[2:12:11] deliverance
[2:12:13] and we need deliverance amen you know
[2:12:17] we have salvation but
[2:12:21] through life's journey we
[2:12:24] have things that come our way
[2:12:27] we have an adversary that tries to cling
[2:12:29] onto our lives we
[2:12:31] we have circumstances that
[2:12:34] arise and and
[2:12:38] and we need deliverance
[2:12:42] and i've i've i pray for so many people
[2:12:45] as
[2:12:45] brother nathan has also and they come up
[2:12:49] and they say
[2:12:50] i want delivered from this i want
[2:12:52] delivered from this
[2:12:53] deliver me from this please pray for my
[2:12:57] deliverance but when that brother spoke
[2:13:01] what he spoke this morning my heart went
[2:13:03] to that place and i thought you know
[2:13:06] of all the people a lot of people come
[2:13:09] up and they pray for deliverance
[2:13:11] but they don't cast their problem into
[2:13:14] his hands
[2:13:18] and let him provide the deliverance
[2:13:21] in the future that he knows
[2:13:25] right you know it's like
[2:13:29] i want to take this problem brother
[2:13:31] mcgary and today i want to stick it in
[2:13:33] the microwave
[2:13:34] and i want to get an instant deliverance
[2:13:37] but they've never
[2:13:38] put the problem into his hands
[2:13:44] now i believe abraham put the problem
[2:13:48] of having a child into god's hands
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:54] it didn't matter it took a while but
[2:13:56] they knew in
[2:13:59] your heart who's got the problem
[2:14:03] so if you've given it to him then you
[2:14:05] know he's got it
[2:14:07] and he knows the future and he knows how
[2:14:10] to work it out
[2:14:12] and he knows how to bring it to pass and
[2:14:14] he knows what he wants to accomplish
[2:14:18] and you to learn from
[2:14:21] your deliverance
[2:14:24] but it's it's never placing it
[2:14:28] into his hands when you come up to get a
[2:14:32] deliverance or or something he already
[2:14:34] knows that
[2:14:35] he has knows what you have need of
[2:14:38] even before you ask but the scripture
[2:14:42] says cast your
[2:14:43] cares upon him
[2:14:46] now i i don't know this morning
[2:14:49] [Music]
[2:14:51] if there's a deliverance
[2:14:54] that you want and and i don't mean a
[2:14:58] need i mean
[2:14:59] that you want something that
[2:15:03] you know is holding you back
[2:15:08] and you want to put that in
[2:15:12] to his hands
[2:15:17] i'm not talking about i want to deliver
[2:15:19] in chess we know
[2:15:22] but would you be willing to cast
[2:15:25] that burden and
[2:15:28] cast that care and and give it to him
[2:15:33] lord i've got this i'm like this and
[2:15:37] i'm going to commit this into your hands
[2:15:41] and know in your heart he's got it now
[2:15:44] and he knows the future he knows what he
[2:15:48] wants you to be
[2:15:50] and you'll let him do that
[2:15:53] [Music]
[2:15:55] so it doesn't do you no good say i want
[2:15:57] deliverance deliver me
[2:16:00] if you don't turn it in his heart and i
[2:16:02] didn't want this
[2:16:05] moment to pass this morning after these
[2:16:08] great words of encouragement
[2:16:11] the words of discern are the thoughts
[2:16:13] and intents of the heart
[2:16:15] the holy spirit puts you under
[2:16:17] conviction and
[2:16:18] and you know that you're not right
[2:16:22] and you want to be right but what i'm
[2:16:25] talking about
[2:16:25] is saying lord you know i want to be
[2:16:28] right now i'm
[2:16:29] putting that into your hands to bring
[2:16:32] the path
[2:16:34] now is there something this morning if
[2:16:35] there's something that you would like
[2:16:38] to
[2:16:41] place in the lord's hands so you don't
[2:16:44] have to come up and say this is my sin
[2:16:46] brother nathan i've got this
[2:16:49] i've got this problem and i've got that
[2:16:51] problem and
[2:16:52] and it and i i need this know that
[2:16:55] you'll come up and say brothers
[2:16:57] i'm standing here today and i want you
[2:17:00] to pray with me because
[2:17:01] i'm putting this into his hands
[2:17:06] and he'll do it in its time
[2:17:10] and it's season but i'm i'm
[2:17:13] placing that care into his hands
[2:17:20] i i wish i had the vocabulary
[2:17:23] and the words to express to you
[2:17:27] what i'm trying to say the difference
[2:17:30] between the deliverance which is the
[2:17:33] result
[2:17:35] and the beginning which is putting it
[2:17:39] into his hands
[2:17:43] it's like taking a seed you cast that
[2:17:46] seed into the ground
[2:17:47] and you place it there and then you let
[2:17:50] god do his work
[2:17:52] and you reap the fruit but you can walk
[2:17:55] away
[2:17:56] the prophet of god said and you can look
[2:17:57] at that field
[2:17:59] and you can say i planted my corn look
[2:18:01] at my field of corn
[2:18:03] because you've cast it and you've sowed
[2:18:07] it
[2:18:09] and then you know what it's going to
[2:18:10] bring forward
[2:18:12] and we try to bypass many times
[2:18:18] the placing it into his hands
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:23] so there may be nobody here this morning
[2:18:26] that can come prepared if you're at home
[2:18:29] and
[2:18:30] and you're watching and
[2:18:33] there's just a heaviness in your heart
[2:18:35] for something and you just like to
[2:18:38] place it into his hands this morning
[2:18:43] i don't even know what how you're going
[2:18:44] to do it lord i don't care
[2:18:47] i know you know i know i know but i'm
[2:18:51] placing it into your hands this morning
[2:18:54] if you
[2:18:54] if you could if you feel that help you
[2:18:56] and you'd like to cast it
[2:18:58] into his hands this morning and you'd
[2:19:00] like to come up to prayer
[2:19:02] you can come up for prayer if you would
[2:19:06] anyone that feels that way maybe one of
[2:19:08] the deacons could come and help
[2:19:10] line the people up and
[2:19:13] we just want to pray
[2:19:24] [Music]
[2:19:35] [Music]
