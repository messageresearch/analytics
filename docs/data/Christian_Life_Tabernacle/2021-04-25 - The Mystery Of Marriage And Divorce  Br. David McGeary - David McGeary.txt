Description:
The Mysterty Of Marriage And Divorce
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Morning Service: April 25,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

with our worship and we thank you father for your fellowship and your love in jesus name amen amen good to be gathered in the presence of god amen son you want to welcome everyone amen i i certainly would like to say i you know like david said i was happy when they say unto me let's go to the house of god amen i trust you're happy in your heart and to be here amen let's invite brother mike for us so i'm reading god bless you good morning you know i think that uh we're all familiar with the story of lot we abraham's nephew who found himself dwelling in an ungodly and corrupt civilization you know and i suppose that you know we have a tendency to to highlight that as an example of a backslidden believer you know this man who made the choice to live among sin to accept a certain standard of living so that he could enjoy the luxuries and the comforts that life offered him you know and he lost his family over that and there's certainly a life lesson there he lost everything but i think we forget that lot was never supposed to be with abraham in the first place you know if abraham hadn't compromised an er lot would have never found himself in sodom and there's maybe another lesson there about how our response to the word can have an effect on those around us but we do know this from the scripture that lot was more than just a man who experienced backsliding he was a righteous man he was a just man it says that in second peter 2 and verse 7 and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversations of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds it might be easy to point to lot as an example of a backslidden believer but the question i would ask is how many believers are truly vexed by the condition of the world that they live in do they have the heart of a righteous man you know in spite of everything he found himself in he had another kind of heart and he had a heart that was actually pretty similar to david's in that regard we're going to look at psalm 55 this morning you know and what struck me as i was reading psalm 55 is this is you know very much the same thing david being vexed being troubled by the condition that he found himself surrounded by a man after god's own heart similar to lot his righteous soul was vexed daily but was also interesting about psalm 55 as you read this he could be speaking of the hour that we live in it could almost be ripped from off the headlines of the newspapers that we live in the condition that we find ourselves in in this last age in verse 2 it says this as he's kind of crying out to the lord he says attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint i make a noise because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked you know and notice it wasn't some specific act or some specific deed or things that he was witnessing but it was because of a voice there was this constant voice this narrative this message that was pummeling him trying to affect how he reacted to get him to carry on that narrative to get him to pick up that message and share it to have that become part of his conversation you know i was just thinking if that isn't just an example of the hour that we live in where we're surrounded by voices and by narratives and by social discourses and there's this constant pressure this constant expectation to pick it up and carry it to react to it to make it part of our message you know he says in verse 3 for they cast iniquity upon me that's what that is trying to cast onto us a reaction a message a voice to say something that is different than the message we've been called to bring you know we've been called to speak the word not to adopt any other message that would be iniquity but the thing that's important to understand is as you look at all the social narratives of the day the message is the the social discourse the things that you're constantly pressured to react to and carry forth everything is targeted as you as a believer because if you remember you are his messengers and if the enemy can get you to share something else what victory would that be for him if his if the lord's messengers are sharing the enemy's message so it's important to to to watch that but you know what's also interesting in verse 5 how the reaction of that is to try to get david to be afraid you know to try to cause fear to try to cause worry and doubt and make you react in a way different than what the word would have you react and i like verse six oh that i had the wings of a dove that i could fly away to some place in the wilderness and just rest i don't want you but that sounds awful familiar to me how nice would that sound just be able to just fly away on some some wings be carried forth and rest and it turns out we had a messenger in this day that preached that there is a dove in fact it was this very verse i think that he took his sermon on the wings of a snow white dough but you know it's we could go on and on and look at this but i like verse 22 after all the prayer after all laying this before the lord this is where david arrived cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain me he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved we do have a place we can go to for rest you know it's interesting i thought it was good that psalm 55 began with the enemy trying to cast something on david and he turned around and cast it right back on the lord that's our answer to the voice that the enemy would have us pick up in this day in this whatever that social narrative is and there's many of them remember the promise in verse 22 as we read this you know the same righteous soul that's vexed by the circumstances of the hour is the same righteous soul that shall never be moved so if we read psalm 22 together i would encourage you kind of put that put yourself in the scripture recognize the day you live in look at the reaction to the narrative the voice the pressure that the enemy would try to put on david and to me it was an encouragement there's a place we can put it and we'll never be moved let's read that together psalm 55 it says give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my supplication attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint and make a noise because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me and i said o that i had wings like a dub for then would i fly away and be at rest lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness selah i would hasten my escape from the windy storm in tempest destroy o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen violence and strife in the city day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not from her streets for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that didn't magnify himself against me then i would have hid myself from him but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and my acquaintance we took sweet counsel together and walked into the house of god in company let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old selah because they have no changes therefore they fear not god he hath put forth his hands against such that be at peace with him he hath broken his covenant the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved but thou o god shall bring down into the pit of destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days but i will trust in thee amen amen god bless you be happier i'm praising [Music] every day oh i [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh that foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] that

that you promised that you would come again and we're here to proclaim that this morning father [Music] we believe oh god that you've had a wonderful beautiful plan that you've unfolded down through time we just asked this morning that you help us with this great subject matter that lies before us this morning that in all that spoken father that you'd receive the glory the praise and the honor that our understanding might not be two carnal things but of spiritual things we ask for your grace and your help this morning in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning we're going to open our bibles to matthew the 19th chapter okay i'm uh matthew the 19th chapter um uh i yeah i should be able to pick big john out just like there he is big john his daughter rain is here i believe is that right amen it's okay you can't hide from me sis you're wonderful god bless you so nice to have you with us this morning i heard jeremy is here and his wife so god bless you and and each one a great subject matter this morning and we'll go into it and we'll skim it and then maybe if we decide to go and bring it forth in deeper sections so if we read here in the 19th chapter and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee into the coast of judea beyond jordan and a great multitude followed him and he healed them there and the pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that which he made them at the beginning male and female and for this cause shall the man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh therefore there are no more twain but one flesh and what therefore god hath joined together let no man put us under they said unto him why did moses then command to give a writ of divorcement to put her away and he said unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put your wives away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except be fornication and shall be married to another committeth adultery and whosoever mereth her which is put away doth commit adultery our gracious heavenly father we ask you to bless this to us this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated now we want to this morning cover and go into the next sermon that has been on the list of sermons that we're going through and this next sermon is the sermon of marriage and divorce now in the years that i've been in the message this is probably the most controversial misunderstood misinterpreted message that we've ever dealt with and it's just because it's such a question now we're not here this morning to discuss marriage and divorce cases okay that is not what we're about first of all i'm not a prophet i can't really discern the depth into all things that cause this or cause this what is adultery and what is in adultery and and all these great subjects that come up uh that people want to discuss i've known from experience if somebody wants to get married they're going to get married if they feel they can get married then they're going to pursue that route if they have if they look at their situation and they read their own tea leaves and they feel that because of this because of this because of that i feel i have a right or a man feels because of this because of this i have a right that will never be straightened up you understand i have all kinds of people that they're they're going to do whatever they have to do if they feel that they're going to have a right to get married they'll do whatever they have to do to bring that to pass and so this is not what i'm talking about this morning this is not what we're preaching about when we cover the subject of marriage and divorce we're not trying to give you answers for your life situation whether you've been married before or haven't been married before what whether uh you've been involved in a divorce or haven't been developed involved in a divorce that's not my place you understand to discuss what your particular situation is because i could sit there and say to you well i don't think you have a right to but if you think you have a right to you know i go way down on the scale you know what i'm saying so you're not going to change a person's heart so i want you to understand when we start talking about this subject of marriage and divorce we are not talking about the the natural circumstances that are in people's lives do i do you understand that so i i don't want you to walk out of here and say brother mcgary said i could or brother mcgary said i couldn't there is a a a message called marriage in divorce that you can read and discuss your own answers we're going to look at it from a different aspect okay so if you could understand from that kind of uh aspect that we're going on that that you will more or less kind of have the understanding of the approach that we're taking and and so you know anytime you have a great uh subject like this it's uh you know it's going to be given to all kinds of different ideas okay so i'm not trying to change your thought on marriage divorce or anything about your life but i want to understand the prophet of god said there was an answer to that question and to the question that raised he says this has been the biggest question in the church in all the church history it was even a question in the days of jesus man always wanting to understand this idea that happens when men and women can't get along and for some reason they've entered into a marriage and they no longer are compatible or whatever and all kinds of teachings and all kinds of doctrines and all kinds of ideas have come forth the prophet of god said there that at that time when he was bringing up this subject he said there was two major uh thoughts and ideas on the subject uh i'm sure there's that has multiplied and increased into many different thoughts we are entering into society now where uh interracial marriage is becoming a very common subject and so you take someone that sticks to traditional bible teaching without revelation you don't understand why god said for each to marry to their own kind and it has nothing to do with the personality of someone the looks of them the knowledge of them what their natural race is what their natural culture was it has to do with god's plan of creation so he created this you know uh and then he created this and he created this and and the the teaching really behind it is is that god knew what he was creating and he knew what that he wanted the outcome to be what the purpose of it was man's always came along and he's hybrided and mixed it and put this together and put that together and and that's what society has done now we don't go back and judge a person based on who their parents are we don't judge a person based on whether they're they come from a mixed marriage or any of those things so if you have the truth of the matter and now we have the circumstances that have happened because of life or basically if you want to know we'll get to that in a little bit because of sin okay and so again it goes back to a principle that god had established in the beginning of the plan that he made okay so god had a plan in the beginning that's what you have to understand that's why when jesus said and started this subject he said it wasn't so from the beginning okay so if you have if you're searching for an answer on a subject you there's got to be a truth somewhere and you can't adjust the truth to fix every circumstance you know so something gets watered down and watered down and watered down and everything times something changes then you try to change to fit things the words the word okay believe it or not according to the strictness of god's word none of us would ever be saved in fact god proved that by the law that there was a law that penalty was death and that no man could live that law and he showed by our nature and so that there's grace and there's mercy you understand grace and mercy is for him to apply it's not for me to take the word of god and reinterpret the word of god to make it become grace or mercy grace is the favor that god extends you in other words it's the it it what grace does is it it's a a a proclamation if i could say it that way or an intervention from the throne of god into your life to change the inevitable outcome of the path that you're on mercy is god taking the just judgments that you deserve and by his goodness and kindness having mercy in other words not applying to you the death you deserve and we're all nothing like we heard the songs today that sister lord son it's by that blood that we are free that we have a life so we have all sinned and we're all guilty of sin so we're not here trying to find something we're trying to come to an understanding of something that man has never been able to understand and the and what's so beautiful about it is he and he said this he says now we we also have two thoughts of this marriage and divorce now that our lord has opened the seven seal mysteries of his word to us in the last days now many of you this might be greek to you but my church understands he says that when you heard of the visions and what takes place and the questions is a bible question we are invited here to believe that there must be a true answer to the whole hidden secret that's been hid since the foundation of the world and and the bible prophesies and says that in this day these secrets would be made known revelations 10 active sounding of the seventh angel lady osean messenger the mysteries of god would be made known and this is the last age which is lady osea notice there must be an answer somewhere and being that the seven seal mysteries of god the seven seals how many understands that raise your hands let's see i think most of the books pretty soon the subject will be out he says the intent the our text invites us to go back to the beginning for the true scriptural answer and when he was confronted with this there was two things in view the priest said to him can he put awake his wife and marry another for any cause and jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning they said moses suffered us to write a writ of divorcement and to put her away for anything they wanted and he says moses did that because the hardness of your heart so we understand that what that we're saying here the reason that we can come to the answer you understand not not the rearranging of the circumstances but come to the answer why there was even such a thing of divorcement in the first place can you understand that because that was the question can a man do this can a man do that for this cause for that cause for any cause what's the causes okay because the question but jesus's answer was it wasn't so from the beginning so in other words you got yourselves into this fix or we got ourselves into this fix but it wasn't so for the from the beginning so the true answer to the question lies in the beginning okay that mystery of what was took place in the beginning had been hid behind seven seals so man couldn't really ever find the answer you understand so this is why he's saying now because of the seven seals being open because of the opening of the seals and the messenger the lady osea that has the answers to these mysteries i can now prophet of god speaking i can now address this subject and give you the word answer now you may not like the word answer i may not like the word answer the word answer may not fix your circumstance it wasn't intended to fix your circumstance it wasn't a ten he it was never intended to condemn or to justify the circumstance that you may be in your parents may be in your great uncle may be in and everything it had nothing and never had anything to do with trying to go back and rearrange and take it case by case and justify this and justify that and you were okay you weren't okay you should have you shouldn't have you had a right to you didn't forget it you'll never fix it it wasn't so from the beginning we weren't even this way in the beginning so so we we we that's what we're we we are emphasizing here that it it is uh based on the realization and the revelation of the the understanding of this great problem and great question so we got to know why the question arose in the first place and why that there could be forgiveness granted and and i'm going to jump ahead and just read one ques statement way in the back of the message it says now on the marriage and divorce see it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it but he promised in the last days in this age that every hidden mystery in the bible would be revealed how many knows that revelations 10th chapter jesus promised it and that all these hidden mysteries on marriage and divorce and these other hidden mysteries that has been revealed in the end time and then brother branham goes on how god told him to go to tucson how he went up into the mountain the lord spoke to him and he says go tell your people it's all forgiven it's all like clean don't go on as you are okay you understand i can't handle that you know what i mean i do not want to put myself on that seat if someone comes into my congregation in their circumstance i never even look back on their life i take every person that walks through that door on their face value of the time they cross that door and that's all i try to be a christian from my side okay i try not to let their life affect my choices and my life nor do i probe you know i mean i don't know anybody that's ever sat down with me unless they're taking a particular office in the church and then i bring that person first of all and vet them personally and ask them a few questions there are certain things that certain things don't cover so let's take this subject now just for the next few moments from the standpoint of the opening of the seals and not from the standpoint of trying to solve and fix circumstances can we all do that okay so you know what i mean you can all uncurl your toes because i'm not going to be trying stepping on any toes i'm not trying to ruin any relationships or point any fingers but this was a mystery that was revealed and so let's go back and these are some wonderful things that brother branham taught now we understand that he said it wasn't so from the beginning so if we go back to the beginning we understand that adam was in the garden of eden and that todd had created the garden of eden is that correct and he placed his son in the garden of eden now remember there was no sin in the original creation no sin whatsoever adam was both what male and female in the garden in the beginning god adam was both male and female and there was no sin in the garden whatsoever and and so the uh and that was the beginning so jesus pointed to the answer saying it wasn't so in the beginning so in the beginning there was no sin in the original creation so we understand and this is also a great uh uh revelation but because there was no sin in the original creation we we understand what the original sin was and so the original sin or in other words was the first sin okay that was the first sin now we're we're not going to go into a great depth on it but really if the original sin was the first introduction of divorce and of another husband okay so that's what we realized took place in the beginning now everything uh in the original creation was in perfect harmony and perfect order everything was just run in perfect harmony and perfect order nothing was out of order everything had a plan everything had a great purpose and so this was basically everything was run that way there it was it it was just a beautiful harmony and and everything was in order and everything was just uh in a in a wonderful place and then we understand that god looked on his creation and said it was what it was good but god being the great master builder that he was god dwelt alone is that right can we know these things we've been taught these things and so god's dwelling alone and the reason we know these things is because of the opening of the seventh seal and god wanted what fellowship so when god looked at adam he said man dwells alone it's not good that he dwelt alone so now this great plan of god is going to unfold okay you you understand that most of you should probably know where we're going and therefore there is no sin in the original creation adam was both male and female god said well he said it's not good that adam dwells alone so i'm going to take from adam his female part and i'm going to out of the dust of the earth adam wasn't created cr created out of something else he was created out of god's creation you understand but the second thing that comes from that is a byproduct of the original adam was the first original man created by god the second part eve was a byproduct god knew what he was doing so he was a byproduct and so we understand that when eve was put there god put her as co-equal to adam they were one he said bone of my bone flesh of my flesh i'll call her woman i never she's pardon me she had come from me we're one and and this is where that as we uh go down a little bit uh down this line you you'll understand that because of this great plan that god had in his mind he allowed eve to be created now evil was i'm just going to preach it i can't explain it you can go back and read the book eve was designed to be deceived do you understand god he knew he had something in his heart that he wanted to do he couldn't adam could not be deceived because there was no sin in the original creation he had both male and female so when he took the female part of adam out at he he made her he placed within that part of the creation the ability for her to be deceived now sister you may think that ain't fair but without that because something else couldn't have transpired okay so uh and when you really look at it all of us here this morning are eids okay he says now he says he says now listen now for about five minutes i want to call your attention to something what is god god is a great eternal at the beginning way back before there was a beginning he wasn't even god did you know that a god is an object of worship and there wasn't anything to worship him he lived alone with his attributes look and now we see this great plan of why eve was made what was coming to pla path and in him was attributes and it is an attribute a thought now you'll get to something that will um border on the lesson for tonight notice he he was his attributes that was in him now it was in him to be father it was in him to be god it was in him to be son it was in him to be savior and in him to be healer and all these things here are just displaying his attributes there was nothing out of order you think god didn't see the end from the beginning certainly he did there was nothing out of order it's just displaying his attributes now he could not just make a man fall he had to put him on an equal basis of free moral agency to make his own choice but he knew he would fall now he can't be savior unless something's lost he can't be healer unless something's sick these things had to be that way god made them thus so that great attribute of god could be displayed there wasn't none he'd never been savior but we know he was even before there was time he was savior he was savior so there had to be something lost now it's going to be if it takes takes a loss it just in order to save it then it isn't justified to judge his judgment he could couldn't send a man to hell and be just he's kind true honest he's a great judge he wouldn't work against him himself so he had to put a man out there and make him a free moral agency knowing would fall and the man in his own image how could he fall he couldn't fall so calm's made in his image and god can't work against himself so he come back here he couldn't work against him in his own image he couldn't fall now are you seeing daylight so he made a bi product something out of the original creation now you see it there you come see then that's what fell he made it knowing it would fall can he put it over into the hands of satan for a vessel of dishonor where honor bestowed today think of that so we we realize now that he he created her knowing she would fall didn't create her to fall or make her fall can you understand so he put her on he put him on a free moral agency knowing that she would but remember well you know we before we were sinners he died for us he already had a provision he already had an attribute you understand that was going to take care of it so he couldn't let you fall he couldn't let you sin then judge you for it so what happens he says i've got i've got these attributes i've got to display them right so adam won't fall because adam's an expression of me so there's no way there's no sin in god there's no one belief in god but god wanted to be what worshipped he wanted to be worshipped for being a savior he wanted to be worshiped for being a healer he wanted to be worshipped for being a deliverer he wanted a fellowship he wanted to show you his attributes he said well that ain't fair that's why he put your name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world he said can you see this name it's on the book nothing can take it off nothing can put it on now i can take this person i can send them through my redemption plan until i can allow them to go this whole route that i can display my attributes but i've already got their end written if you had eternal life you always had eternal life [Applause] this is the mystery of marriage and divorce it isn't we'll move to that it isn't i can do everything now because i'm that's a good evidence it's not there now so we understand he says he says oh don't you see it now in this view here the perversion of the church we'll just leave that there your brother brown just throws things in there you know and you just you know you're just trying to grasp eve and then he takes it all the way to the perverted church and uh you knew he carried a lot of vision and a lot of truth he said he said the perversion of church the original is god's word there's no sin in god you see what i mean here's a creature that come into existence by perversion god's going to have a church but look at this perverted thing they've got out here god has male and female but this woman see the very s symptoms of it shows back to what god had in mind it would take an hour or two to break it down to make this creature this creature for that way he made the creature and turned her so satan could get a hold of her and he did he still got her he's better flee to the cross now not to dwell on that side of it okay but to to to go to the understanding now of what the mystery really is of marriage and divorce and and to understand her position you've got to go back to the original creation and understand how that he made every other female in creation okay no other female in creation they they they mate with the mail for one purpose only and that's to replenish their species okay so another if we're going to look get a revelation of the beginning we've got to go back and understand how he created every other uh every other female and if we could look at every under female and understand he created that god he can't to break that pattern so in order to understand her purpose okay her purpose wasn't to produce species or the human species every other female was one male right multiple females but with one male that was the order of nature that's how he created them when it was time to to to produce offspring they they had an order that they produced offspring but in order to put a revelation and an understanding of what god was trying to come to he allowed eve to break that pattern so by breaking the pattern i don't know if i can express this but by breaking the pattern he revealed the pattern you understand if i had a if this was just nothing but a a great big black sheet up here you wouldn't know what it was but the minute i threw a white spot on it you it would all of a sudden become oh now i can see it so he allowed this eve when he took the byproduct he knew that she now was created for deception and he was going to give her over to satan to be her designer and he still is today he he designs her doesn't he i mean he designs her with uh with uh the the clothes that he makes for the uh the styles you you know what i mean uh you know you walk into a grocery store you walk someplace and they'll have a book there the new woman the modern woman you know today's woman what's he doing he's designing her he's designing her thinking he's designing the way she presents herself you know where does she get the idea that her clothes have got to be so tight where did she get the idea that somehow her figure is something that she can use to accomplish things the prophet of god said it's deadly it brings more people to hell than all the bootleg joint they're obsessed with it shape this health magazine that health magazine eat this do that you know your skin will be crystal clear it'll be tight as a prune no that's not what i meant tight is a plum no the truth of the matter is it is a prune the older you get the drier you get the more wrinkles you get and just because they have face putty that you can fill in all the cracks don't mean the wrinkles aren't there praise god for wrinkles i'm trying to let just lay something in here satan became her designer and god was allowing that because he was unfolding a great mystery and so when when let's go back to the original so here's adam and eve he makes eve he's co-equal now what happens is and we understand that that now in the original sin there is the introduction of another husband okay so eve divorces the covenant she had with adam now do not get caught up in looking at your own circumstances you will devour yourself why don't you have to look at your own circumstances [Music] he knew well you were yet a sinner he died for you he died for you in your unbelief now there's an introduction of another husband now this husband becomes her designer is that right he says so it wasn't so from the beginning so he says now after the original beginning is over jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning that's when time began when god make it first in the original creation all understand that so when when eve broke that covenant and took sin a new covenant was put into effect and that's where time began now that's just one of the mysteries that's thrown out here in marriage and divorce now we may be able to go into that but said if she would have stayed in the original condition she would have never been there would have never been no fall but because of the fall in the interruption that broke the whole continuity of god and throw death sorrow and everything else on earth she was made thus wow in the original continuity there wasn't even time time began at the fall right there that's where time began so just to jump out here why do you think in the breach that he says there will be time no more we won't go there we don't have enough time now notice after the beginning after the beginning after time began because but back in that was eternity what god originally had it was over notice after the fall was made by eve after the fall there was need for to be another covenant made now this is going to stumble you but i'm going to give you the scriptures to prove that this is the truth okay now we're not going to go through all those scriptures but i want to read this god now secondarily set a new nature again by sex okay we're just leading to something so there they were co-equal everything's perfect it's interrupted the minute upper they're interrupted time began where did the interruption come from it came from the introduction of another husband okay now because of that eve's covenant changed you're to serve you're to bear children there's a new covenant place there so now now she's under this covenant the god created the first without sex you believe that now there's another covenant with nature he said it in another order bisex second covenant one male many females one buck deer a whole harlem of does you see that's right but one bull heard of cattle cows one rooster a yard of hands right david after his own heart with 500 wives and one of a different woman after man god's own heart solomon and on he begins to he begins the covenant has changed okay we're not going to go into all that because there's some people that read that and my goodness they become polygamists you know i mean all of a sudden they all become david's and they all be kind of solomon's you know and they and they they they start justifying their actions just to find their actions god said so let me tell you that's all the further they read in the book they found something they like and and they latch onto it now we know there's many polygamy polygamist uh cultures and many polygamous things but that's uh and it it breeds all the problems that come with that but all those problems come from what the original sin that the original covenant was broke so command breaks the covenant comes into an imperfect covenant that's causing all kinds of problems now is trying to fix it the only way to fix it is what return back to the original now you're starting to get a picture for what this message is how many times did you hear the messenger say back to the original back to the beginning back to eden back to the word it ain't trying to fix the mess we're in it's trying to get us out of the mess we're in nobody you understand you may not be in a marriage in divorce situation but you're in some situation because we've all sinned and come short of the glory of god and so we we understood this how that it began and and how that uh this three and that's what he told her don't partake of that fruit right because the day that you eat of that fruit is the day that you die so let's just follow this down and again prophet of god emphasizes this he says but now that the seven seals are open the spirit of truth directs us to the word that explains why all the mistakes has been down through the ages because the seals was not open this was not revealed it's true he's saying this is why all the mistakes were made that's why men didn't marry the first one in the first place that's why she looked at him and said how did i marry this mom what was wrong with me you know what was wrong with us all we were living in sin amen we were out of the what original covenant you meet somebody and and and who are you affected by you think you're affected by her no you're affected by her designer he had not designed to make her a deceiver why do you think you pray through why do you pray tell you get an answer why when you go to pray do you have to fight against all the reasoning that goes on your mind why i'm going to marry her why i can go and get married well i'm gonna go find a guy you go through all the reasoning all the fighting all the thinking in your mind but she's so pretty she's so nice you know i mean everybody will think i really scored they'll realize i'm not so ugly because what he said it's the reason what what do we all go through we go through the whole reasoning process right back to what took place in the beginning we reason and we reason and we reason and we reason what was the thing that he used to deceive us in the first place reasoning reasoning what do you think every marriage and divorce problem is built on what is every sin bill time what is every problem we ever get ourselves into based on reasoning if we would take the word we'd be safe he said he said again let me say he says now that is the truth a true woman virgin that marries her husband and lives and she's a blessed thing to the man if god could give his son anything better than a wife he would have given that to him but she's designed to be a sextac and no other animal is designed like that no other creature on earth is designed like that that's the reason you see polygamy because of that that's what brought it in that's why it doesn't fit in this bright age and it doesn't fit into this message because this message is returning us back to something now look in the final analysis look there is one jesus christ is that right one man god emanuel do you believe that but the many but the numbers of his wife are many thousands times thousands is that right his wife the bride the church you understand now that's why he said to adam before sex was introduced or introduced multiply and replenish the earth now we've just got to the whole mystery of marriage and divorce it was the what before there was even any way he told replenish the earth right when he was yet in the beginning he was yet both male and female in himself i i just wanted to let you know i can trump too [Music] there it shows then that the bride's got to come from the world by spiritual multiplication you see the replenishing the earth the law was in adam when he was both male and female why it be he knew it was going to fall but he wanted to understand and get the revelation that it was a spiritual replenishing i know that's probably pretty hard to get your minds wrapped around but do you want to know it's got to be sowed it's got to be it's got to be out there the commandment was put in the beginning is that right adam replenish the earth he's got both male and female in him so it was going to be a spiritual replenishing but because we're so carnal we can't figure that out don't try it but that's what it was going to be so the commandment you understand that let's lay that real solid the commandment was given when in the beginning when he was still both male and female because it was going to be a what spiritual replenishing that's why when the second adam came adam was a living soul jesus was a quickening spirit [Applause] because it was going to be a spiritual replenishment [Applause] that's why you don't get this body back because if you've got this body back it would die again this body's not going to be raised up we have one waiting for it but the replenishing had to come by a spiritual union the one head and the many-membered body he was laying it out in the expression of his attributes that man was going to fall he was going to get involved in all these things he was going to come up with marriage and divorce because he didn't understand the true revelation it was failed they there was now a covenant of that man that was driven by by the the fact that she was made for this act and the very original sin and and the drive of that act and the pursuit of that act which was the sin original sin that entered into the garden has been the cause of murder death crime everything i hope i said that as gentlemanly as i could does not need to be gone into detail on both sides of the fence spiritual multiplication see replenish the earth now in the second set see the schools got those two things mixed up you see why they have all the problems they're trying to fix fix the the broken thing with broken answers first of all comes justification well i had a right i had a right i had a right the covenant changes right she was made for man when the other husband was introduced that's when marriage and divorce was introduced right there eve now had two what two husbands now you know why god said you can't be married you can't have two husbands he was he was laying that out there because what what happens he's pointing this out what so eve had two husbands each husband uh each each husband had a seed that produced fruit you know how brother brandon be preaching and all of a sudden he'll just shake his head and look and he says don't you see serpent seed can't you see serpent seed now amen they they they they produced so eve had two husbands right and they produced two different kinds of what fruit is that true a cane and an abel and they're not what they're not compatible they're not compatible they couldn't live together so one wants to what smoke the other the flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh is that right i mean if if you were to take galatians just turn with me galatians 5 and it says this 5 16 this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these two are contrary the one to the other so that they cannot do those things that they would now do you understand really what we're talking about when we talk about divorce the prophet of god it's not divorce there's only one way of divorce that's death that husband must die can you understand the mystery is in the type of christ it isn't trying to build a new carnal religious system trying to bring us back to the original so he said as long as that a woman she cannot marry as long as that husband lives why that husband produces seed and the seed produces fruit and we know you understand what we're talking about right he said okay and can't that they would do but if we be led of the spirit you are not under the law for the works of the flesh are manifested in these these are the fruits of the first husband that brought flesh into the world god knew it would happen but these are going to be the fruits this is what man has lived under until this husband dies adultery fornication uncleanliness lavishness idolatry one was adultery the other one's idolatry witchcraft hatred variances emulations wrath strife seductions heresies envies murderers drunkenness reveling and such like of which i tell you before and also have told you in the past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god why that husband is still alive he's still producing fruit and you're in a marriage of the second covenant amen well but what are the fruits of the other let's say in this case husband if she wouldn't have broke that covenant in the beginning none of the things that we read would have ever entered in to our lives people hate one another because of their skin color they hate one another because of their race they hate one another because of the languages they speak the foods they eat the cultures they come from you know what because that's the fruit of their husband that's what that marriage produces it produces sickness greatest battle ever fought it produces sickness his his marriage is war destruction all these things way back god showing that he had a husband that he wanted his bride to marry and the fruits of the but the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there are no rules in other words let me say it this way there's no harm because law is to govern your actions that cause harm law enforcement is spoke to be there to stop harm and that's why he said they're ministers of god sent to carry out the wrath of god that breaks the law let me tell you it's time we make sure we're married to our husband because god is fixing to divorce this whole thing as soon as he gets her married as soon as she breaks that vow to that other husband that she got from birth and lets him die and he resurrects in her in an invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and she gets remarried can he replenishes the earth with the bride that he's redeemed through the ages so when he goes back to that eden he goes back in there with eve replenished [Applause] hallelujah the spiritual replenishing took place in the second adam because he was a quickening spirit the law was when he was yet male and female how many times do you hear brother branham say you were a part of him when in the beginning when he went to calvary you were there with him you were with him when he was a living soul you were with him when he's a quickly spirit you understand the revelation of marriage and divorce is the is the replenishing of the earth by a spiritual union which would have been exactly what took place in adam and eve or in adam when he was yet male and female oh maybe i simplified maybe i had to figure out a way to make it sound more deep and more complicated you know maybe according to like ecclesiastics 102.5 it and you you see these things so now you understand that that's why he said that he can divorce but she can't now that is because he's the one that quickens you understand he's the one that replenishes so if she doesn't want to take his word seed he can divorce her but she can't live without him it never was a carnal thing that he can and she can't brother ben makes that statement i'll just read it to you so you can understand he said solomon can marry any woman that wasn't married he could marry any woman he wanted to the priest could marry only a woman that was a virgin solomon david they married what was her name abigail which was a man which was a man called a fool he had a nice wife and he died and abigail was married to david he was king not priest so he married but the a priest could not do that because he touched or got a woman to be his wife that had already been with some other than some other man's wife so that shows the vergency of the church of the lord jesus christ the bride will have to be unadulterated the word not one word missing nowhere certainly could you imagine a correct bride and i know this is straight but he's trying to get you to get it one breast off can the other something or other wrong you know that not going to be the bride of christ she's perfect she's everything the word not one word failing anywhere now i i'm sorry i got to address these things but we get so carnal that maybe some good sister who's had a mastectomy or something reads the scripture and comes to pieces let's clean this thing up it's not about the flesh it's all leaving you're not taking none of it with you this is a spiritual replenishing notice he can put her away but she cannot put him away he did it and proved it in the days of luther wesley in pentecost in other words when she wouldn't take the word seed he divorced her she wouldn't let the first husband die she tried to have two husbands him and their doctrines their creeds their interpretations their style the way they wanted to dress the way they wanted to eat this is a long subject but at least we're done with it in pentecost and when they refuse to become the further part of him by having spiritual sexual affair to become pregnant with the further part of the word you understand she refused the lutheran church refused for christ to have any more desire with her luther refused it and let me say this going to call me something anyhow so it's today with every one of them they failed to take that word they refused christ and any woman that refuses a man his child has no right to be wife with him amen now a lot of men have taken that quote and say i can put you away but you can't put me away let me tell you something there's a whole lot of other word and law in a christian life that governs that how you take care of your wife what your obligation to her the vow you took you don't take a quote and do away with every christian principle a husband has because you're having some sort of mental or physical desire problem you don't think i'm gonna have a juniper tree there's a whole epistles peter all these things that tell a person what governs you before you ever would say i can put you away but you can't put me away i heard that preached from somebody for a long time and it finally i got so tired i love the man but that's all he'd preach on he can put her away she can't put him away well guess what he thought he had enough people convinced that he could get rid of his wife but he left all the other word out that governs a relationship how you treat one another how you pray for one another how you kneel down how you read the scriptures together how you keep your marriage together how there's gifts in the church to help this was never spoken to be put in a carnal frame because never spoken to being a carnal frame the marriage and divorce jesus was talking about was not the one they were involved in that's because they had a hard heart and couldn't receive the word so he gave him a writ of divorcement what do you think that writ was for you think it was for them it was for him he's the one that had the writ of divorcement because he was the only one that could marry he was the only husband of the bride amen so take a divorce anyone that laid claim to him that didn't bear his fruit i'm not talking about if if you've borne a child at a wedlock i'm not talking about you if you've married a woman that's had a child i'm not talking about you married aka a woman that had been married for more you'll never get that right so the prophet in a perfect type of christ forgave everybody [Music] because it's all going to be forgiven anyway because your names are on the lamb's book of life in the beginning and so i say this in closing the plan was to have in the beginning a word spiritual reproduction god was not going to have it carnal okay he allowed eve to be created to be deceived so he could draw a law of contrast so his spirit could find his bride and then the real adam the second adam quickening spirit the one that was the word in the beginning that created the first adam could come and marry his bride that's marriage in divorce in a nutshell excuse that expression but we're not going to fix a carnal life that's going to be done away with anyway we're not taking any of those circumstances in situations amen if a person had a right to divorce that's between them and god if god chooses to marry them and that husband's tied that situation dies i don't know i can't say but i know one thing that he said that a woman couldn't have two husbands because god can't break his type and the natural types the spiritual and so we can't change what things are but what he said don't do it again don't go out there and create a new situation that you've got to somehow justify that's the best i can do if you plea your plead your case with me you're playing it with the human right i don't know the beginning from the end i only know my end by promise i trust my beginning of time is under the blood but my beginning in eternity was in this union with christ jesus from the beginning i've just got to have that other husband die god bless you this morning musicians could come [Applause] maybe a some interpreter could go help billy take his place billy's going to interpret for me

to hear well my dad is a believer he always speak to me about the bible and everything the reason why i wanted to be baptized today is because i was a christian but not a true christian i never really prayed or read the bible i was just in the middle i didn't know where i was you know so then when i was here last sunday passed the preaching the word really touched me and i decided that i would i wanted to accept god as my savior [Applause] so this scripture certainly applies to our sister hearing the gospel now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this up towards generation and certainly our sister has heard the cry and wants to do what god has for her to do amen amen our sister our sister according to god's word we were commissioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel to baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost peter with the keys to the kingdom to bind and lose having a divine revelation of what that name was he baptized in the name of jesus christ according to the word of god at this hour brought to us by the messenger of the age we carry out this commission by baptizing you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you just praise the lord and rejoice and welcome our sister into the kingdom and go out the highways and byways and bring all that you want into the kingdom of god because the door is going to close soon god bless you amen amen why don't we stand and sing he became sin jesus messiah as i dismissal this morning [Music] across so amazing
