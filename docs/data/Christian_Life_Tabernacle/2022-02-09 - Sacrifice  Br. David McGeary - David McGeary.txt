name we pray amen amen god bless you tonight if you have your bibles let's turn to the gospel of saint john the 15th chapter and we'd like to read starting in the let's start in the 10th verse uh let's start in the ninth verse okay let's go to genesis 1 1 and start there amen so saint john 15 let's start with verse 9 this evening you know i always like to read the verse ahead of it and make sure i'm in context and then that verse sounds so good i keep jumping up and and then pretty soon the whole bible sounds good amen amen john the 15th chapter the ninth verse as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love so isn't that amazing when you really think about it that god is love amen if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love what a secret how can you abide in his love keep his commandments and you will abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love it's not asking us to do something that he didn't do so i want you to keep that thought there because this is a place that you can live and abide is in the love of god i believe that's the safest place there is is the love of god amen love thinketh no evil it does no evil it's a tremendous thing these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full think of that now these are some good scriptures we're gonna uh just have a little bit of fellowship with but that's what the scripture says here these things have i spoken so i've told you these things for a reason right he's just not throwing out statements i'm giving you secrets i'm telling you these things for a reason and the thing is i told you this is the result of them the things i have spoken unto you that ye might remain that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you you know we all like to love somebody but to love somebody the way he loved you means to forgive him of everything you know what i mean to throw everything in the sea of god's forgetfulness as that's what he did to be what remembered no more you know you don't worry about you don't got no grudges you don't got no feelings like that okay and then he goes on to say greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you amen heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated i kind of have a purpose on my heart and uh and uh just to uh uh share something with you and uh for those that are watching uh by way of what do we call that thing stream and everything you know that's not really the stream we want to be on we want to be on the stream of life is to where we want we want to be in the stream of calvary but uh this is on my heart and i i i want to kind of play this evening uh if you could um enjoy it it's just 32 minutes out of the message that brother van creech called forsaking all and it really came on my heart that looking at the church and the church world and even sometimes us as message believers that sacrifice is something that's not really mentioned much and we often uh like to talk about the blessings and the revelations and uh and the great things that god is doing but a lot of times there's little thought ever taken to the sacrifice that men have laid down for so many years that we can enjoy the blessings and i thought the lord gave us a great key here okay it's it's hid within what he spoke he said that i uh i i want to tell you these things and i want to say these things to you and that i have loved you even as my father hath loved me now the very and he said i have kept his commandments well what was his commandment that i lay down my life you understand he's talking and then that's what he refers to he says no man loveth but lay down his life for his friend another scripture says scarcely will a man sacrifice or lay down his life you know for another and so he's saying here he says this is how much that i have loved you that and he's expressing this love and they don't even realize it at this time but he's saying he says if you will have a sacrifice if there's a sacrifice involved in this sacrifice you will find out that that there's joy and that your joy will be filled so this is my commandment if you keep my commandments he said there's going to be great joy and this joy will remain in you and this joy will be full and i think of how far that we begin to find ourselves living from the privileges that god has for us and we find out that that we we wonder why we don't have joy and why we don't have the power that we uh feel that we should have we read the scriptures and it talks about faith and how we should have faith if you have faith to move mountains if you have faith to do this and we look back and we want to grab a hold of that faith and we want to be possessors of that faith and we want to have the signs of that faith in our life and we want to look in the mirror and see somebody there that's powerful and someone that could do those things but you're never going to see that person if the person that you're looking at in the mirror has no sacrifice that's what jesus did he laid down his life so we just didn't become the sons of god we came the sons of god because he paid a price that released us from the thing that was keeping us from being sons and daughters of god and that was sin not only did he release us from sin but he provided for us another spirit other than our spirit because if if we couldn't remain in the love of god and remain in our spirit but that didn't come without a sacrifice a price paid and the very meaning of sacrifice is an act of giving up something one values for the sake of something that is more important and you know so it it's it can't be just something like you know the good will person shows up at your front door and you run get all your rags and you run get all the clothes that don't fit you and it becomes house cleaning you know what i mean so there's there i'm just getting rid of my junk so to speak there's no sacrifice on that because to really have a sacrifice if something that's valued okay and it's not just like i said given away but it's given away for something that you value more or something that's more important you can't lose that i mean you could sacrifice is is is not just something that's just done like i've said giving away stuff giving away stuff but it actually has something to that it's sacrificed for so there's a reason for the sacrifice it's something that is deemed that you're sacrificing for so a sacrifice is something that's given for the sake of something that's more important another if it's more important to us to have the spirit of god if it's more important for us to be about the father's business it's more important for us to to be able to praise somebody through or lead someone to the lord or when someone comes up sick in our midst to lay our hands on them that they recover you've got to understand in order to come to that place to do that it's going to involve some sacrifice somewhere because you deemed that to be more important to you than where you're at and i think that's kind of gone away from us as believers we don't talk about uh sacrificing we don't talk much about fasting but i i've talked to people in my life that didn't follow brother random as we do because they've never been given the revelation that we've been given revelation is a gift of god amen it ought to be deemed as a gift and and it ought to be sought after it's the pearl of great price it's the treasure that's hidden in the field it's the lost coin it's it's what makes you what you are that's right and i talked to many men they sat down and they in the years that i've grown up in the message many of these men of course are gone now but they would tell me they said oh we knew brother branham because i was in brother bram's meetings of course i'd always perk up and i never heard any negativity i heard their common excuse there was no man like him he had the power of god okay there's no man that could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart there is no man that could do these works and and not even realize they contradict the scriptures because no even the scripture says no man can do these things unless the father be with them and then they will say but he got off and you know i thought well if he's off and you're on why can't you do what he did because they're not willing to sacrifice that's right they're not willing the sermon that we're going to listen to a little bit out of it's called forsaking all and what forsake means means to leave completely to abandon and abandon means to leave permanently you don't abandon something and return back to it you understand that's not abandonment that doesn't mean that you've forsaken it you know it's like you say i you move out of a place to another place then that place becomes your vacation home in other words you occasionally visit it you occasionally go there you occasionally uh rent it out or do whatever you do that place isn't abandoned but if you go down and see some old boarded up shack that's just all there and the only thing that lives there is cockroaches and rats and bats that place is abandoned it's been given over to the dark side so it it it it's been abandoned and it's been abandoned permanently and then forsake means to give up completely so you can't forsake something without there being some form of sacrifice involved see you to forsake something means to walk away from something to leave something to to sacrifice so in order to forsake one thing for another there has to be the process in of giving it up i'm going to give this up because i deem this more important so you're sacrificing for something it's so important that we understand that because a lot of times the church feels and people feel that there that there's all these things that are given to them that are like endowments they're like freebies or what we would call entitlements i'm entitled to this i'm entitled to that i'm entitled to all these things and you think well who's sacrificed you know what i mean so all the blessings that we receive are not blessings that came without a sacrifice jesus laid down his life because he deemed that eternal life for you was more important and and it's so easy for us not to just let sacrifice move out of our life to move out of our thinking where we we don't sacrifice our time we don't give up our time for something when you go to help a friend or someone calls you and says could you come help me do this well you're sacrificing that time because you deemed what you're doing for him more important to than sitting on your couch no it it it happens and i think it's wonderful when we can come to the realization and the revelation and the understanding of what sacrifice means what it is and the part that it plays in christianity and the part that it plays in empowering you you take early pentecost they didn't get the holy ghost because they showed up and they had a good meeting and they shouted they fasted and prayed till they got the holy ghost amen they prayed through they separated themselves and you'll hear our prophets say these things but i want to lay down the emphasis of it before that we listen but they they they they walked away from something in order to obtain something that they felt was more important and that part of it leaves us sometimes when we feel that there's nothing more to obtain you understand nothing more to get no greater place to to grow to no higher heights to ascend to and we get to the thought that we think we've got all the revelation we've got all the truth we've got all the power we're we got everything everything's comfortable and and believe it or not you can have the spirit of lady osea on you and in your mind sitting in a message church listening to a message preacher because there's no sacrifice see lady osea had no place else to go they had everything what did they think need of nothing and because they didn't need anything there was going to be no sacrifice to give something up that they thought was more important and we get to the place that we're the top i ran across some good pentecostal people the other day and i figured they were upc and i appreciate it but they were they weren't the modern upc you know the upc had a split don't you the traditional upc and the more modern upc they they had a not a falling out but just a divide and i thought when i i thought i was going to visit with them and and i thought you know because i've heard this many times i thought you know what we would say to them well we're a lot like you but we're one step higher is that high enough do you want to be one step higher than this and one step higher than that i don't want to be i i don't want to have any comparison to any of am i having a vision i just thought i'm seeing one of my very best friends just arrive but anyway that that's uh uh you are saying it's a it's a way of thinking it's a disposition it's an attitude so there's not an attitude in our life or a thought process in our life or a realization in your in in our lives that if i sacrifice it might benefit me some way spiritually or we'll say i want to go to higher ground you want to go to higher ground sacrifice give up something for something you deem more important otherwise we find that we remain the same personally in our personalities in our natures in our accomplishment in our ability to pray we find that we we go in day in and day out and we haven't risen to higher heights and when we bring it back to it the reason that we aren't going to higher heights is because we're striving for him but we're not striving for him with a price we want it free lord send me your blessings give me power well power without character satanic and the first evidence of character is one who will sacrifice who will forsake and it's my desire heart's desire is that we move into th the realities that our prophet messenger spoke to us of that said that the church could obtain to but it's like trying to become a soldier without going through boot camp or no training and and so my desire is is i love talking about the great things of god i love showing and going to the scriptures where god reveals himself and speaking of the things but also i know that the difference that keeps it hear me the difference that keeps it from being in your mind and in your life is the sacrifice that you make for it because you've forsaken something you've sacrificed one way of thinking for another you've sacrificed a certain lifestyle for another so you can't forsake without walking away you can't forsake without leaving something behind and and it's bad when we think that we've achieved everything because we can hear the voice of god in our day that we think we can achieve everything because nobody can challenge us in our doctrine we think that we've achieved so much that we get to the place we don't sacrifice for anything because nobody has got anything that they can offer us or tell us heady highminded but to have that desire in your heart and the understanding and the revelation in your life that if you sacrifice and give up things that you can advance spiritually and you can move towards rapturing character and rapturing faith just think you'll have to be to the place that you're so willing to sacrifice that you'll sacrifice your life for the rapture everybody that's going to go in the rapture is going to be challenged with leaving their life behind you talked about lot leaving sodom well what happened to his wife she got out there she didn't know where she was going all lot knew is that god would take care of them and she got there where she wasn't sure if she wanted to pay the price she wasn't sure in other words she didn't forsake it all she didn't abandon it she looked back you know the days of ananias and sapphira are going on right now but they're not dying physically they're dying spiritually because they didn't want to pay all and their sin was was lying to the holy ghost saying that they were something that they weren't and and having so as we listen to this and and brother runs going to give examples he's going to talk about it so understand what we're trying to get across to us tonight and i feel this obligated to say this from the standpoint of my office not so much as me as brother david but i think as a pastor that that it's so important that you understand that there's always two sides to the story and as we listen i want to read to you the last statement that we're going to finish up on and when you hear this statement it'll be done it's statement 134 it says and you have to forsake everything that's right to follow him but he that will forsake all and follow him god pays off in the bountiful blessings of richness there's nothing to compare with it so the question is are you willing to give something up for what you forsake is more important another are the bountiful riches of god so important to you that you're willing to forsake abandon walk away and give up completely that you might obtain that spiritual blessing and i really feel it's so important that we challenge ourselves and our lives look in our lives and say what things can i give up for the kingdom is it a saturday morning with the homeless is it an afternoon making a meal what what where's a place for me to sacrifice i wonder if we even walk through our lives and looked at our lives to see if there's anything that i could give to the kingdom of god let me say something money is a cheap excuse for time money is a cheap excuse for personal effort so do you want to grow i do you say oh brother mcgregor you sacrifice all the i haven't laid my life down for anybody i've never went without a meal in fact i overlooked my life and i i don't really even know if i've ever seems that i've ever had a challenge or went through a hard time his grace and his mercy have been so rich and good but if i want more i'm going to have to give up more and i just hope that this speaks to you this evening because i really think it's important that we just don't sit around as a bunch of quote unquote message believers and don't do a thing you know what i mean show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my works lord bless you i hope you enjoy this if you hope if you we don't need to stand but if you'll turn in your bibles dr brother brown is going to make one quick reference to a small scripture found in mark the 10th chapter and the 28th verse and we're just going to listen to 31 minutes but if it and the purpose of it is is i want you to understand that the messenger is talking about everybody that's ever achieved anything for the kingdom had to walk away and forsake something so may god richly bless you i know you'll enjoy hearing the word of god scripture here tonight i want to read and take a text and i pray that god will bless it if you want to read it when you get home it's in mark the 10th chapter and the 28th verse then peter begin to say unto him lord we have left all and have followed thee now i would like to take a text to build a little context on there of forsaking all and then in a few moments we will pray for the sake and now you who are acquainted with mark the 10th chapter backgrounded they're just jesus had been talking previously on divorce and then he also had a very striking thing to happen there was a rich young man came running to him and said a good master what could i do to have eternal life and he told him to keep the commandments the young man said i did this from my youth or what commandments and he told him what they were he said i did this he said but one thing you like if you want to be have eternal life be perfect and sell all you've got give it to the poor take up your cross and follow me let's follow that young man just for a few moments before we enter the text to give a background now you see that young man was asked to forsake all but he refused to do it and sometimes if we apply prosperity and riches and so forth success but this young man was a successful young man and still didn't have eternal life so sometimes success doesn't always mean that god's a blessing but let's follow him we find him here now in his youth young perhaps a handsome young dress fellow the bible said that jesus loved him he must have a nice good uh tender conscience he must be a a very fine something or he would never win the admiration of the lord jesus because when jesus looked at him he loved him he must add a kind expression and nice look to him a clean gentleman straight cut boy and he walked up to jesus perhaps thinking in sincerity and said i would like to know what i could do to have eternal life and when the he had to depart with what he had to have eternal life then the question was at the gate where you can make it and that question lays before every one of us and jesus really asked him to forsake all he had take up his cross and follow him and we know the story he went away sorrowful because he had great riches then jesus turned and said how hard it would be for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven like a a camel to go through the eye of a needle but that would be impossible with man but he said with god it's not impossible let's follow this young ruler the next time we find him in the bible he never as soon as he rejected the opportunity to follow jesus when it was laid down to him pretty stiff you see we want to hold on to everything that we can and then follow jesus but sometimes jesus wants us to turn loose of everything so we get both hands on him sometimes we think that just because it if we've got a hope reminds me of a little thing i usually tell all my two little girls they're not so little now and uh they're pretty good-sized girls but when they were little one of them is rebecca she's the oldest and sarah she's the little one and becky has blue eyes and sarah has brown but they're both daddy's girls you know and so they wait up to see me come home and they're always uh loved to see me and so becky is kind of was kind of a tall skinny sort of a girl and sarah was a little kind of a short little bitty fella and so they were waiting up for me to come home one night i've been away on meetings and they knew i'd be home so they thought they'd just wait a little while and if i come home they wanted to see me well the sandman must have sprinkled sand in their eyes they got sleeping finally they went to bed out in their room and i got in late so i got him was real tired went to bed and after the meetings and so forth i get so tired i can't sleep after a few weeks of meeting and i slept about uh two or three hours got up went in the in the living room and just sat down in a a chair i was sitting there in the chair early in the morning and after a while uh becky turned over in her bedroom and she realized it was daylight and she looked out through the hall and she seen me sitting out there in a chair out of the bed she come just as hard as she could those little skinny long legs just they're reaching for well that um that alarm sarah and i don't know whether your children does that or not but my you get something for the oldest one and the second one takes the hand-me-down and sarah was wearing project rebecca's pajamas the feet way big you know too big far and she out of the bed she coming them big feet flying and she could hardly keep up with rebecca so rebecca beat her to me and she jumped up on my lap drove both arms around me just kind of she was on my right knee and her long legs reached down to the floor she's pretty well balanced it kind of reminds me of some of the greater first organizations you know that come along you know they've been here a long time kind of long-legged and so forth pretty well balanced and here comes sarah along the little young church you know it hasn't been out very long and she uh kind of seen it back here he had repeater beat her there so rebecca had her arms around me she looked around she said sarah my sister i want you to know one thing she said i was here first and she said i've got all of daddy and there's none left for you they try to tell us that you know all the time said i was here first and i've got all the daddy and there's none left for you poor little sarah dropped her head down her little lip fell down she started to go away in the tears and those big brown eyes becky had her head laying over on my shoulder kind of hugging me i took my finger and reached like that to stare and pushed the other leg out here she come and jumped up on the other leg and what she she couldn't balance herself her little legs wouldn't hit the floor but she was on the leg any housing so she was toddling around like that well keep her from falling i just got both arms and put them around her like at the holder i was holding her up close to me and she put her little lower head against me for a little bit she raised up and looked at becky and said now rebecca my sister so i want to tell you something too she said it may be so that you've got all a daddy but i want you to know that daddy's got all of me so that's about the way we want we don't want we want him to have all of us so therefore in all to do it we've just got to walk out there by faith and believe him that's all and just trust we can't explain it there's no way to explain it we just believe it and take it like that this rich young man he would not give himself to christ and so he went away and we find him later that he was he had prospered so much until his barns were so full until he said soul take thy rest oh he had prospered everything he had so much he had need for nothing but something taken place the next time we saw him he lifting up his eyes in hell had seen a beggar far off in the bosoms of abraham that was because he wasn't willing to forsake all to follow the lord jesus then when this taken place and the young ruler would not give up what he had to follow jesus it must have dawned on peter i believe it was him that made the remark or asked the question raised it and said now we have forsaken all to follow you we have forsaken all look what we have done we left our homes we left our families we left our lands we left everything that we had to follow you it began to dawn on him maybe he'd been so carried away in the work watching christ and so forth that he had never dawned on him that he had left his home he left his family he had left his father his mother he left all he had to follow jesus but that's exactly what god requires forsake all and follow him that's god's requirement we've got to do it too sometime we've got to forsake our very thoughts if our thoughts about anything is contrary to god's word we've got to forsake our own thinking and follow him and the only way we can follow him is follow his word obey it have a god's request and god's requirement is that we forsake all and follow him but in doing so we find out sometimes we have to forsake our friends many times that's a hard thing to do now many people when they first come into christ and be filled with the spirit maybe like women has been having a some kind of a party they've been going to every certain certain night where they've been playing bunco in the neighborhood uh acquainted with all the the neighbors and so forth and belonged to certain societies in the neighborhood and uh they go play bunco and these women you know is going to say something about it they're not going to understand it but yet you have to forsake that thing because it's not right to gamble play cards and you've got to forsake that if you follow christ sometimes the women in our churches that's used to wearing immoral clothes like shorts and these dungarees and the bible says an abomination to god for a woman to put on such she's no matter what she thinks she's got to forsake that sometimes we find women when they come into the way and get saved they've been used to cutting off their hair and they want to be popular like the rest of the world but they find out it's a hard thing because they'll call you old-fashioned whenever you go to dressing like a christian acting like a christian living like a christian they'll call you old-fashioned but you've got to forsake all the following jesus said of the scripture says he that loves the world are the things of the world the love of god is not even in him okay it takes forsaking off there when you were willing to forsake all and follow him then if ye abide me and my word in you you can ask what you will and it will be done for you but you cannot knowing that those things are wrong you know they're wrong the bible's against them card playing cigarette smoking drinking wearing immoral clothes and then claiming to be a christian if that spirit in you does not condemn that then there's something wrong with the spirit that's in you because the god who wrote the word is the word and the word is in you and it condemns you it's got to and if it doesn't you're being deceived how can the holy spirit write something and you turn around and do contrary to it and say the holy spirit is leading you you can't do it so smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey playing cards cutting hair wearing shorts all these other things are wrong sinful wrong and you'll never get anywhere until you quit it it's creeping into our pentecostal moves shame on you you ought to be ashamed no wonder we can't have a worldwide revival no way we can't have a pentecostal revival something's happened that's right we've let down the bars and things are taking place that should not take place therefore you must forsake all to follow christ you must forsake your your own ideas you must cope with his word and never will the holy ghost ever deny any word it ever spoke and the bible is wrote by the holy spirit the bible said so and if the bible words is god in the beginning was the word awards with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now the word is made spirit dwelling in us for i will be with you even in you to the end of the world the consummation now that same god that wrote the bible is in you you're not your own you're dead to the things of the world you're dead to your own thoughts and the mind that the mind that was in christ be in you there then you're forsaken all to follow him not your own thoughts what he says not my will dying lord then you'll begin to line up with god's word could stay there a long time but i'll just run on a little farther but you say what do i get then forsaken all forsaking on what do i get you can expect the world to make fun of you you can expect the world to call you all kinds of unhonorable names they'll call you anything that they can call you you'll be despised and rejected jesus because of him being emmanuel god dwelling in him it made him so odd to his own church to his own church excommunicated him as soon as he come in they was the one who hung him on the cross they was the one who condemned him he loved people his whole heart was far people but he had to forsake everything in order to follow god and so do we have to forsake everything in order to follow god now what do i get in return we don't expect we sometimes i think we ministers make it a little too uh much flowers for the the convert all come to christ everything is lovely but you see it isn't like that in the way that saying it everything's a flower bed of ease because no christians the bible said all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution so if if you're not suffering persecutions for christ's sake then there's something wrong if the devil ain't after you he's got you it's all because as long as he's after you that's the sign he hasn't got you yet but if he isn't at you it's a sign he has got you here so just remember as long as he's a blasting at you you're a few jumps ahead of him yet and just keep on going but all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted that the prophet switch was before you that's right don't go the hang down face and say well uh oh done it i guess i just can't stand for somebody to talk about me and say i'm old-fashioned on this side or the other oh you you should be exceedingly glad happy because of it because you can bear the reproach of his name and by keeping his commandments it caused you to do that but i want to say this to hurry up as quickly as we can god will not in no wise be in debt to any man god won't be dedicated to any man if you have did that for god forsaken all god will repay you a thousand-fold right god will pay it back you forsake the things of the world and the world and the things of the world and god will repay you so many times how many is a witness of that year tonight while we all know that god will repay now let's take just a few characters that did forsake all let's take first the father of faith abraham abraham for own land the property he owned and everything else he was called out of the chaldea the city of era and he for suck his land his home his people and all and followed god he had to forsake everything leave it behind he for suck is his land his property down in chaldea in uh he forsaken his property and god gave him the whole promised land god pays back with a lot of interest he gave him up there that day when he met him he said rise up abraham look east north west south i give it all to you it's all yours that's the matter with christians tonight god gives it to us but we're afraid to investigate it when you become a christian you're heir to ever promise in the bible right everything that god promised is yours it's just like a great big arcade and by one spirit we're all baptized into this arcade which is christ well if i if somebody give me something i'm gonna look around and find out what i own i think that's what christians ought to do tonight find out what you've got if something gets us a little high up and i can't reach it i'll get me a stepladder climb up to it you know something seems a little hard to reach in the bible or god's promise i'll stay on my knees and climb jacob's ladder until i reach it because it's mine god gave it to me if divine healing's promised in the bible i'm sick i'll stay there until god gives it to me because it's a promise god promised i'd forsake the world and give me the holy ghost i'll stay right there until he gives it to me because he promised it if god promised to give me the desire my heart and the desire my heart is the right thing i'll stay there for god gives it because it's a promise and uh forsaking all the world i want to walk after him and he will pay i know that to be true it's exactly right what did he do he for suck his land his country and god gave him the entire a province or all the whole um continent of the um of palestine he forsak his little bitty piece of land down there maybe an acre where his house set in his old house to receive everything there wasn't palestine good but the first thing he had to separate himself he separated himself from his people all of his loved ones the old associates that he used to to run around with his boyhood friends that come down from the babbling with him and all these brothers sisters and all these friends that he knew his associates when god called him he said separate yourself from your kindred get away from all of it now that was hard but he separated his self from all of his kinfolks why because they would not agree with him could you imagine them agreeing an old man here 75 years old with a 65 year old wife saying you know what i met god out here and he told me he's going to have a a baby now but sarah well then his doctor friend would have said the old man's off at his head but he'd already bought up the pins and burt eye and everything else getting ready for it because he knew he was going to have it that's right nothing to it why god promised him right now if that bunch of people want to laugh at him and think he'd gone off at his head they'd do every believer that way all of abraham's seat has the same thing it's right sometimes your church will even turn you out your clubs your your places you belong to your fellowships in the neighborhood your associates sometimes your boyfriend or your girlfriend or turn you down but god requires you to forsake all to follow him for sake everything is contrary to him abraham forsaken his people what did he get in back of it what come besides that he become the father of many nations god made him the father of many nations what little he gave up then look what he could become jesus said he will forsake me will have fathers mothers and so forth look what abraham got by forsaken all and following him yes sir father of many nations but first he had to separate himself from all unbelief and even from his cold lukewarm church member brother loft he had to forsake himself for that everything has got unbelief in it you have to separate yourself anything if it's a creed if you're in a church and all you're depending on is a creed and don't believe the word and the words contrary to the creeds contrary to the word you'll have to forsake that you'll have to forsake everything and god never did bless abraham until he totally obeyed him abraham won't take his daddy along the old man with the fly in the ointment all the time finally he died they unlocked his strife and everything and then as soon as abraham fully obeyed god and separated himself and let lot go on down there in the good lands wherever he wanted to go down in sodom then god appeared to abraham and said lift up your eyes i give the whole thing to you abraham was the one who separated he was the one who separated all to follow uh to follow god and he is the father of faith he is the one that we believe to be the faithful one the promise was made to abraham and his seed we being dead in christ our abraham seed heirs with him according to the promise israel forsake egypt they forsuck the old lands down there in egypt to receive what palestine they come from that horrible place down there in egypt past masters and there's many people today young women out here on the street smoking drinking like we've seen here on the radio the other day these police had to come rest that bunch of young women down there out in the street got wild that old devil spirit got on to do this new blue ugly wiggly air what they call a thing and out there on the street gone crazy in their mind see really if a young lady's got an ounce of decency about her her or a young man either one that thing is a taskmaster that drives them to do that you forsake that and god will give you a dance oh my you sure will he'll give you one if you'll just forsake that but you've got to forsake all those things to have it you just can't continue with both of them he got palestine abraham did other than israel did he got palestine far land they left the old land down there and got palestine a land flowing with milk and honey yes sir what did they leave they left the hot suns under the taskmaster down in egypt what did they get for leaving that warm sunshine down there they got to walk in the pillar of fire's light leaving that hot sun down there to walk in the light of god's pillar of fire what an exchange i'd like to take that exchange wouldn't you a pillar of fire walk in the natural sunlight where there's driving under task masters to come out there and walk in god's light under the power of the holy spirit a pillar of fire that was leading them to a promised land same thing today walk out of the light of this world the things that saw the world to walk in the light of god it leads you to the promised land they also left the old garlic pots of egypt flesh pots down in egypt what did they get when they first sucked them old flesh pots they got to eat angel's food manna come down out of heaven to take the place of garlic now if you have never eaten nothing but garlic let me tell you something god's got a heaven full of angels food defeated that's right angels food that's what they got instead of that instead of the old um garlic of egypt they left the muddy waters of egypt what did they get out there to drink from the rock that was smitten in the wilderness of the pure crystal waters of god they left the old muddy waters of egypt the old denominational upside down muddy waters that's what we have to do sometime today leave that old creed and denomination it says days and miracles just pass them guys are crazy they're just a bunch of holy rollers leave that thing behind and come over here and drink from a fountain filled with gone come emmanuel's veins were sinners plunged beneath the blood lose all their guilty stains yes sir leave that old water of mud all mixed up with doubt and flusterations and arguments and stews and everything else going down at night time and have a soup supper and boil up some old chicken and sell it for 50 cents a plate to pay the preacher whenever you get over here under god's laws and god's holy commandments and walk with god you'll pay your tithes and a preacher will get along fine if you'll just take god's way of doing it trying old muddy waters to drink from the rock they left them boasting physicians of egypt saying we are the smartest man in the world today they left the boasting physicians to be with the great physician amen i'd like to see some physician today carry on like that great physician did then people were in the wilderness for 40 years and they come out without a feeble man the one among them it was the feeble person among them 40 years there was over 2 million of the people that come out at that time how many babies is born every night how many sick i think did i like to go to dr moses look at his satchel and see what kind of prescription he give him wouldn't you like to see that i imagine there's a lot of doctors that like to look it up on that prescription well i can tell you i've read it let me tell you what it is i'm the lord and heals all our diseases that's only that's all he needed for they pro-suck the boasting physicians to be with the great physicians yes sir therefore suck down there the people it said the days of miracles are passed there's no such a thing as miracles of war they or suck that to do what what did they do then to be right in the presence of where miracles has happened day by day amen the people today that says that there's no such a thing as miracle there's something wrong with their mind trying a person told me one time that i wouldn't care what you've done i didn't care i can't you know how much proof you got said i just don't believe it i said certainly not you never see it you're too blind to see it that's why i said it's not for unbelievers it's for believers the believers see it that's right fellow said to me one time met me on the street said you're wrong in your doctrine i said it's the bible he said you're wrong he said then i'm against you said then smite me blind paul smaller man blind one time said smite me blind i said i i can't do it you're already blind you're how can i do what your father the devil's already done you're already blind a man to say a thing like that is is so blind he don't know daylight from dark you can't discern between the two life or death that's really being blind yes sir yes the great physician was with them and they seen miracles happen sure the disciples what did they forsake they had nets fishnets they forsake their fishnets to walk with him and see his signs and miracles and his power of being the messiah anybody wouldn't give up a day's fishing to follow that there's something wrong they left their nets full of fish they started pulling that as biggest cats they ever had they first soaked every bit of it to follow him because they believed in their heart that he was messiah and they wanted to follow him to see if the signs would follow him as messiah and they got to see it god forsake anything in the world i don't care what it is to see jesus christ manifest himself especially when it's manifested in my life that i know it i pass from nothing to life i know by taking him at his word that he has saved me from a life of sin and i know that the holy spirit dwells within me i see his signs everywhere pointing that i know that he's the same yesterday today and forever forsaken all i'm willing to forsake anything i belong to a fine organization a fine church one of the best in the country but they said billy you're going to lose your mind and become a holy roller right there i said you might as well take my fellowship card right now because i'm going to follow the holy spirit that's right true and you have to forsake everything that's right to follow him but he that will forsake all and follow him god pays off in the bountiful blessings of riches there's nothing to compare with it all right somebody's still listening amen now i know that you're not drinking and smoking and doing those things that that's not what we're looking at tonight we're looking at the principle do you understand if god ever does one thing he always does it the same so he said that in order to go from one place to another you have to leave something and he pointed out all these people left something and and but they left something to obtain something that they deemed greater and i like what brother madam said here he said i would forsake anything in the world i don't care what it is to see jesus manifesting himself especially when it's manifested in my life now that's a that's desiring something but if you follow the principle and you you begin to to see it you've got to you've got to leave something you've got to come out of something in order to do it god promised something so if there's a promise in the scripture the promise of the spirit of god the promise of being laying your hands on the sid whatever the promises of god are if you see those things you understand and you see those things and you want to obtain those things then you've got to realize if you don't have those things in the place you're at then there's got to be some spiritual movement in your life to get to the place where those things can be there so you've got to look it's not condemnation but it's the understanding of the principle that god pays his debts he will not be indebted to you so is it willing to fast for is it willing to pray for is it willing to spend time on your knees he said god promised it he said stay on your knees till you get it well that takes sacrifice it takes something and so i just don't know how to express it to you but sometimes it's a principle that we don't teach very much in the message we just think we're entitled to everything and we don't have to do anything for it we don't have to change our life we don't have to give up something we like to do and not everything it doesn't mean it's evil i know of an experience in my life and i could just testify for my experience and i i look back on it today you know i was a lover of the ocean i love to fish i got opportunity to fish i started fishing when i was eight years old a man took me fishing i love sport fishing i love sea fish i love catching tuna i love being on the ocean and and it came in my life i had just heard the message of brother branham you just had just got done listening to the third uh message that i heard and it was called choosing of the bride and i knew i had to leave california and i remember i made my decision in my heart i'm going to leave and that day my phone rang and on the other end was captain tom beach and tom beach was the captain of a boat called the el navigante a beautiful yacht and he took people fishing and on cruises like the president of mexico and senators and people from all over the world and and the jack cousteau's uh crew and things were gonna rent that boat and take it out and so he offered me a job to go on that book he knew i could cook a little and and do things and it was like my whole life's desire i mean if i could work on that boat i mean i pictured myself you know all curly long hair and and just like leather skin just out in the suns you know with my flip-flop marks on my feet and just i mean it was everything i ever dreamed of can i remember i had to i had to make a decision was i willing to give that up for this i didn't know this i was a hippie willing to leave california go to i didn't know where or what was ahead of me but i i it just dawned on me i i like peter said i didn't even realize i forsake all right it's just this message was deemed so important to me it meant so much to me it had contacted something inside of me that i didn't even know how to describe i didn't know about the seed of god i didn't know about the book of life i didn't know about being predestinated you know sometimes we do a lot better serving god without so much head knowledge the bible says that knowledge puffeth up just to see and understand what that he did for me now i understand i never forsook him without him blessing me a hundred times what that thing could have ever blessed me i'd have probably just got seasick and no telling all that he does but i want to leave you with this tonight this bill he's going to come and lead us in some worship you still forsake all your christian life you're always going to be leaving something behind for something you deem better all your christian life is based on sacrifice god's showing you something a higher way god's showing you a better attitude god's showing you a better spirit god's showing you some works that you can do and it always involves a sacrifice it always involves a forsaken it always involves moving to higher ground and the day we think we've arrived we know that we haven't you know probably talked about the minute you think you know everything you know nothing so i want to leave that because i want to see god manifested in us all i want to see people come through the door that are sick and they don't have no place else to go not just our people i mean i don't care if they ever come to church here and say we know a god let us pray for you that god will bless you and then walk away with the blessings of god but am i willing to sacrifice for that am i willing to give it up what what am i willing to do you know it's so easy to get so comfortable and so i i want to encourage you to to look for higher ground look for what can lie ahead of you in a greater christian life and a greater desire to be more like him and ask yourself what are you willing to pay for that you know in my own personal view i always thought that this is me personally and i got no scripture no nothing just the thought that run through my mind that if that ritual and ruler would have followed jesus he just might have been the messenger to the gentile church there's no telling what he could have been in christ because of what he ended up being in the world and how could you ask yourself where do you want to store your treasures you know are we willing to forsake and give up to move higher with god i think we're willing right so i think if we start doing that in our personal lives and i'm not trying to give a list of what you give out because i'm not talking about giving up sin i'm talking talking about giving up something that's good for something that's better and i hope you understand and i i wanted to play this for you so you could understand that all these men forsook to obtain and if you will forsake you'll obtain because it's a promise of god god bless you brother billy hey man i tossed in [Music] all the way i'm going all the way [Music] all the way [Music] oh [Music] to the land [Music] oh the way [Music] [Music] oh
