Description:
A Spooky Spirit 
Br. Matthew McGeary
July 7, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

cared for us like you have you've looked upon all of our needs you've already taken care of our future needs Lord there's nothing you didn't think about Lord we just want to rest in your more than capable hands tonight and just ask that you would come Lord you'd have your will and way in the service we're depending on you Lord we're not looking to the ways of man but Lord we're looking beyond the scene into the Unseen realm Lord that you would just come and do what Only You Can Do Lord and that's take your word and bring forth Revelation and life and Quicken seeds and deliver and bring forth new births into your kingdom because you are the same yesterday today and forever so where we place this word into your hands pray that you pick up this little thought you would break the bread of life and feed your sheep Lord we love you we pray these blessings in your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles um turn over into Nehemiah chapter 8 it's going to be after Chronicles uh before Esther I believe after Ezra help you find it sometimes it's nerve-wracking turning to a chapter to a book in the Bible because everybody thinks you don't know your Bible and you're you're like man I know nehemiah's in here somewhere and then you just you get stuck on job and you're like well no one else will know I'm just going to keep my right here you're all laughing because we've all done it but that's okay Nehemiah uh chapter 8 we have a maybe an odd thought and approach to this service but we'll see what the Lord would have for us Nehemiah um y'all pray for me I'm I'm weak in body I'm I'm weak in voice um the spirit is willing that the flesh is weak but but he wins every time Nehemiah 8 verse 8 says so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading and Nehemiah which is the church cherisheth and Ezra the priest Of The Scribe and the Levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is Holy unto the Lord your God mourn not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law you could imagine a people that would claim to uh uh believe the law and and live by it when when the the book was read to them they realized their transgressions and and what was the weight that was upon them but he said then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto the Lord neither be ye sorry for the joy Jo of the Lord is your strength amen you may be seated um like I said this this might be an an odd approach I I was prepared to maybe continue along a thought that we ministered on previously and then I had maybe thought it's it's communion so maybe we'll do a little just a little short teaching uh but then the Lord just dealt with my heart this morning and then after uh this message we heard this morning I figured let's just keep keep the devil running let's just drive that dude all the way out of here and um the joy of the Lord is your strength um and this might seem really odd but the title of my sermon is a spooky Spirit a spooky Spirit you know spooky means a strange or unsettling or frightening in a way that suggest the supernatural it's it's Eerie or uncan so you know just reading in the joy of the Lord is a strength we'll have a quote we'll get to where brother Brandon would say that um but you know if Satan can ever rob you of your joy you know David said restore unto me the joy of my salvation and certainly a lot of times we might get into places in our lives and we go through trials and tribulations and and we don't realize we get worn out and we get uh uh distracted and we get ground down and we we for get the joy of the Lord and what he's done for us and many times all we have to do is just encourage oursel and the Lord look back of at what he did for us and the and the great revelation of the hour and remember what he done and start to testify about it and you'll find that that Joy just coming back and it'll give you strength to go another day uh but in just this thought of a a spooky Spirit um you know brother Brandon would say um he would say now I I am happy I get tired I get physically wore out I have difficults things that an ordinary person doesn't have you can imagine how Satan fights me day and night all the time cast those demons out and they haunt at you you see uh but those things I have a battle that no one knows about and he said in another place in his commission he said many times demons has followed me in the room and and I felt their flesh rubbing against me and and bells and things would haunted me half uh the night nearly and I just want to say we we could see the prophet in that great office how uh the enemy would war against him but you know we're all in a battle and uh just the other day I was out out with my family and and my wife's she's just hearing this for the first time so now she's going to know why but we were in the restaurant and and um I I I just uh you know I just felt a a a spirit move up next to me and and wanted to uh to try to uh us talk to me and when you when you start to do battles in that unseen realm you know really the things around you become more distance and you're you're really honed in to to do a pressing you're doing a real battle spiritual warfare and as we were leaving the restaurant my wife looked at me and she just said honey what's wrong you don't seem yourself and I I didn't tell her at the time I said oh no everything's okay and there's been a few times in my Christian walk I I remember one time um I was preaching some meetings and um you know a lot of times when you fast and pray or you're really making yourself available for the for the Lord just to come you know you're you're also you got to be very careful because you're in a vulnerable state and and you're you're more um in tune to the things maybe in the spiritual realm and and a brother wanted to take me out to eat to a restaurant we went out there and I tell you I'll never forget I was looking at his face and he was talking but I wasn't heing one thing he said a spear had moved up right beside me he says what do you think you're even doing here you have no business here you're out of the will of the Lord coming here to preach the gospel and and all of these things and and and I'll tell you what happens when when the devil starts starts talking and you start to hear him if you if you're not careful he'll start to change the atmosphere and and there'll be a really spooky feeling and a really eerie something start to come over you and if you're not careful and you start to listen and you just allow that to creep in the devil could be do a great damage and the prophet when he would start to preach in demonology he would say you know the word demon or devil it comes from one word and that is Tormentor and so the devil wants to try to torment you and we know the lid of hell has been taken off and there's 200,000,000 demons that are fighting against the Bride of Jesus Christ a and certainly he would want to torment you and so I I just want to maybe uh tell you the inspiration of why I'm wanting to to um speak on this thought because something that struck me is that we we every single one of us you know we go through trials we go through battles but I want to say it's just not for your sake it's for the sake of others because as you overcome as Christ overcomes through you now that trial becomes a testimony and uh you know just this this morning you know I felt uh uh you know the devil just press up against me and and that that that spooky Spirit just just try to start talking to me I I had to you know I had to get up and go do battle I I had to remind That Old Devil who he's dealing with I I had to take the word and start to do battle and I tell you every time if you if that old spooky spirit moves up to you and the devil starts to talk to you or even your carnal mind or your memories you must be quick to take the word of God and do battle you don't want to give him any place you don't have to listen to his lies you don't have to listen to him right when he opened his mouth just smack that guy just give him a black eye just say hold up wait a minute I'm a Son of God and I am going to do battle and you know Paul would say in Ephesians 6:12 he says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places make no mistake about it we are in a war we are in a real battle and make no mistake about out at each one of you if you are claiming uh to be a Christian and believing this message and you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is a Target on your back and Satan would want to take you down he wants to keep you from recognizing who you really are he wants to keep you from catching a real revelation of the message and who you are in Christ and you know because we wrestle against these uh spiritual wickedness in high places know you you can you can feel it or you can you can see the effect of it in the flesh and and many times you know brother Brandon would uh uh preach demonology uh In the Flesh realm and demonology in the religious realm and he'd go on to preach different ones so we see the effects of of of that of the Supernatural and that wickedness in different Realms but we also uh will see those effects you know doctors will give it a name it might be some type of sickness or or or depression or a fear and and no matter what you what you might come down to say it we we know that sick comes from one place and it's of the devil I I don't care what you want to call it sometimes we might get confused about it and understand well how can somebody Holy Ghost filled have this or or be going through that you know brother Brandon would say in one place you know while you're in your right mind you know give your life to God because you might not have a right mind one day there's there's some people that have lost their mind there's some people that have even committed suicide and and some people think that's the unpardonable sin but no no to reject the grace of God would be that thing that where you would cross a line but if you if you have your right mind I tell you if you're sitting here tonight make a conscious decision to serve God with all your heart repent of your sins uh be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you might receive the Holy Spirit and you be born again but you know we wrestle against these spirits and a lot of times we see those effects and and you know they they call it oh they might call it a cancer they might call it a depression they might call it an addiction they might call it high high blood pressure they might call it diabetes Well make no mistake about it it's the devil we'll go ahead and call it what it is that that that's no Mark upon your character no way that's no Mark upon you being a Believer what it is is you're in a battle and we got a family of God that wants to join together with you in the battle and beat that devil remind that devil that by his stripes we are already healed he might want to point to the symptoms he want to might point to the trial and everything you're going well I I don't I don't have to point to the symptoms I don't have to point to the doctor's report I'm going to point to Calvary I'm going to point to the word of God I'm going to point to thus sayth the Lord because that is our Victory and you know that the devil what he'd want to do these principalities and these Powers you know he would really want to try to an anoint your mind and and take control of your thoughts and and your actions as we'll just read some quotes out of Christ The Mystery of God revealed he would say this in paragraph 221 he'd say some people under illusions of things go out and become insane well we know that's wrong that's the devil trying to impersonate the real thing before it gets here see always aacy but a real man is to lose his own thoughts and his own thinking not come up blindly like that no sir you come up with your right senses and Christ takes you over and expresses himself and now to the world you're an insane person now if you're insane you're actually insane that the devil can can take you in complete complet control he'll make you do everything contrary to this word now I say we are living in an age and in an atmosphere we where we are seeing the devil take over flesh and cause people to do everything that is contrary to the word even people who claim to be Christians they're doing everything that would seem contrary to the word we're seeing uh the effects all around us we're seeing Total Insanity in one place brother bam say why do the people do it because a monster has got them groundbed you you wonder why people are doing the things that they're doing and they're standing for certain causes and they're they're marching out in the streets and and they're proclaiming certain uh uh justices and things it's because they have come under an anointing look you have to start to see that this world that we are now living in they they actually are being anointed for the tribulation there is an antichrist spirit that has anointed the government it's it's anointed uh the newses and the sports and everything you can make no mistake about it there is a God of this evil age and Satan has a bride that he is Anointed he has sowed his seed and that his seed is coming into manifestation in all kinds of ways and wickedness and we're seeing on every hand make no mistake about it there is a real devil and people are becoming anointed people are coming demon possessed now I I know in this title this might not sound like a really uh you know preach us happy brother Matthew well we're going to get there like I said we just we just want to put our shoulder behind the word that we received uh uh this morning and I just want to keep uhhh the devil running because you know uh like I said this morning I felt that Spirit come in and try to press itself against me again I'm like wait hold on here uh and and I I something dropped down into my heart and I I realized that what the Lord was dealing with my heart is that we go through things uh um that we can testify and and give the Victory and I believe that somebody here is battling a spirit that's trying to talk to you and trying to discourage you and trying to oppress you and you feel like there is a dark cloud maybe hovering over your life it's trying to follow you and I want to tell you we're going to we're going to deal with that spooky Spirit tonight and we're going to get the victory if you want to be delivered Deliverance is here for you you say well how can I overcome well you got to recognize the devil real you got to recognize that that depression or that anxiety or that thing that you've been battling that is the devil God doesn't want you to feel that way there's not there's no no there's nothing wrong with you you might call it a medical condition you might be taking medicine for it that's okay but what we want to do is recognize that God doesn't want you to feel that way God doesn't want you to feel depressed he doesn't want you to feel Mal ol he doesn't want you to have anxiety he doesn't want you when when it comes time to take decisions you you get all locked up and you don't know what to do and you start to have a panic attack I'm telling you that's the devil we're going to call it out that old spooky Spirit we're going to recognize the devil is real and then but what do we got to do once you recognize the devil's real how do you overcome you recognize that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you're not just sitting there all on your own but you are a Believer you are a son of God you are a daughter of God and you were going through a trial and that is just the opportunity that God wanted you to go through just like the children of Israel when they're back got against the wall when they came down to the Red Sea it looked like there was no way out there was no way to turn left no way to turn right the Egypt was charging behind them and the Red Sea was in front of them there was nowhere to go but God LED them the prophet of God said God LED them into a trap because it was just an opportunity for him to express his love I want to tell you you might be going through a trial right now you might feel depressed you might feel uh despondent you might feel some spooky spirit is talking to you I want to tell you that God has led you into this trial because he's going to lead you out of the trial this is just an opportunity for my God to prove his love to you to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever you're going to get the victory I say you already got the victory you got the victory when he prayed you through before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life how you like that devil you can't stop me you can't make me miss the rapture you can't make me miss the love of God there's nothing you can do devil you've already been defeated when my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ spread for him his arms on Calvary and he said it is finished I want to say it is finished the race is already over I'm telling you we're running a race but it's already finished why because we have a forerunner what is a forerunner a forerunner is one that goes before you and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he's already ran the race and he's already won and greater is he that has won that is in you oh I feel pretty good watch out devil we're going to get the victory tonight evangelism won't hurt you to help you just get behind it a little bit I'm looking forward to God to do something look I went through a trial I had to do battle and I want to testify that God is Victorious every time in the world you'll have tribulation but be of good cheer oh the joy of the Lord is your strength I have overcome the world Prophet goes on to say but when Christ takes you over he'll Express that word right through you so we see what happens in the negative we see how a demon Spirit can take somebody over and express an evil spirit a a a demonic oppression where people will lose their mind and they will carry out murders and all kinds of adulteries and things and people will strip them elv down and and make them a strip teas and and run through the world and and it's all kind of insanity my if you would take this generation today back just 50 60 years ago they would lock them up in mental institutions make 100% the way the women dress the way people act this this was a nation that was once built on moral standards it was once a Christian Nation and the insan and the demon possessed people walking around our nation it would not have been tolerated but now our own government and our own police forces and I don't care call it what you want a Democrat a republic whatever you want look it's the God of this evil age has anointed the minds of men but if we see that in the negative if if we can see that gross Darkness pressing in upon the people if we can see people losing their their mind where where where where they're committing all acts of vience what about the bride of Christ but when Christ takes you over he'll Express that word right through you because it's him he is the word see and then you can see the expression of Christ not some illusion of some sort but a real genuine Christ expressing himself right through you how beautiful oh praise His wonderful name I say you must be born again not some illusion not some explanation not some religion not some our fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness here's the word made flesh fulfilling every scripture that was prophesied of the Messiah the anointed word for the hour and they're in a debate with them friends we don't need to debate the message we need to say Amen to the message I don't have to make this quote fit with that quote you can't make them all fit because if you're trying to make them fit it's the carnal mind which is enmity with God a lot of men have got their themselves in trouble explaining a quote and then when they explain that quote they run into a quote that's a little different than the way they explained it so they got to pick which quote they're going to explain away I'm not called to explain it I'm called to believe it I believe it it's thus sayith the Lord It's the anointed word of the hour and here they are debating with the anointed word of the hour which was their Messiah well you know our our our our our fathers uh did eat Mana in the wilderness he said yeah and every single one of them are dead they said oh I he gave us Mana to eat in the wilderness he said Moses didn't give you that Mana my father gave it to you and I am the bread that cometh down out of Heaven oh now they had a problem I kind of call me a fanatic but that's that's uh you know that's John 633 and I think it's kind of interesting that it was June 1933 that a voice came down and said you know as John the Baptist foran the a first coming of Christ so shall your ministry forun the second coming of Christ all I could see is the Bread of Heaven coming down Hallelujah I am the bread that cometh down out of Heaven I am Revelations 10 1-7 I am that Mighty Angel unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no life I don't I don't need an explanation I need a revelation unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man it hasn't changed unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you brother random said he Jesus had some parasites he had to shake off he said he said you know the first well there went the there went the congregation there there went you know there went the 5,000 there there went all those that left he still had some parasites that were hanging around he said okay if that offend you what about when you see the son of man Ascend up where he came from he said okay now the now now they're with the minister early Association they left and the prophet of God said he didn't explain it because he didn't have to Hallelujah I don't need an explanation I can't I can't tell you what's happening in my soul all I know is when I heard that voice all I know when there was a deep calling to a deep there was something in there that responded my sheep hear my voice and they follow me I'm coming Lord I'm following after you I ain't got nowhere else to go there ain't nothing in the world I want there ain't nothing no career nothing nowhere there's nothing that means anything more than me than the voice of the hour I'm coming I'm following but if we're not careful we we depend on an explanation we depend on some sensation we depend on some explanation and if we're not careful we start to debate and we try to start putting things together brother brandham said if you say he's been revealed to me and the life that Christ produced here in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong revelation well let it sink in a little bit maybe I'll read it one more time he that hath an ear let him hear Look everybody that heard wasn't just a uh all a white lily and and and no sin and and when they heard the word like oh that's me no a lot of people heard the word and said man I'm a rich I'm a sinner Lord forgive me I need your grace well you can be sitting on the Pew tonight with the wrong Revelation but if you got an ear to hear and if you say he's been revealed to me then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong Revelation people say they believe the message but where's the life well I could I could you know I I I could I could go to preaching a little bit here but I don't want to get on any hobby horses but our our our our conduct the way we conduct ourselves the way we talk to one another the way we think about them when you're alone yeah you cannot think about your brother and sister and be like well I just think they're this way or that way shame on you love thinketh no eil evil love doesn't it's not selfish and thinking on its own and well you know that's just the way it's always going to be no but but love wants to help love wants to cover a multitude of sin love says you know what I I believe my brother or sister they're struggling I want to pray for them that God would help them some of us got the wrong revelation we can listen to anything we want to listen to we can watch anything we want to watch we can go to church whatever we want to we can read pray whenever we want to as long as we go to work and have a job and we make a good income and we drop a car and we're just as selfish as all can be and but I and I believe the message if you're not careful you're going to find yourself in Isaiah 4 oh Lord Lord you know we want to eat our own bread we want to dress any kind of way we want to dress but let us just be called by your name to take away our reproach some of us say we believe the message and it's just enough to take away the reproach of being a nominal Christian but but you you you fellowship with everybody in in in in the uh the Unseen realm of social media we're not going to keep going we're just going to keep preaching the word and not try to keep you too long but some of us we might have the wrong Revelation I I I tell you you you have to to look at the one that was given the Revelation look at the life of Malachi 4:5 and look at the life that It produced if you want to see the right Revelation and the the effects of the revelation of the hour look at the one who took the book and ate it up and the life that It produced It produced a life of humility it put a produced a life of [Music] service it was a life of surrender it was a love slave I do nothing but what the father shows me to do if that is not the life that we're living we must be careful because we got the wrong Revelation if you sleep while the word is being preached maybe you got the roong maybe you're lacking brother don't tighten it down too much well why not I live for this man this is game seven the bases are loaded we're about to win the World Series and we're sleeping on the we're sleeping in the bleachers I I know I know we're going in a Rapture and a body change I I know we got communion tonight I I know I know I know we're living in the greatest greatest hour we've ever lived in and I know I know all the saints of all the ages are looking over the banister and and they're saying come on you can make it you're you're going to you're going to you're you're going to do it any any any moment you're going to take the final step and you're going to be amen oh no I I can't help it you I I can't hear the word enough and when I'm getting a little selfish and and I'm looking at the news or I'm I'm doing things to pass the time there's a still Small Voice that says I want the word I want to be in prayer come on you bag of bones we're going to serve God Amen look you you gotta you got to tell yourself your worst enemy that hey we're GNA serve God I'm GNA read my Bible I'm GNA pray because if you're not careful you're just listening to an old spooky Spirit but we want to get the right revelation we want to get the revelation of the hour brother brandom goes on to say now notice god making himself known not that you're supposed to make converts to Christianity by government but by the Revelation that Christ is in you as God was in Christ let's don't move over that too fast now notice god making himself known not we're supposed to make conerts to Christianity by government not that our pastor is supposed to stand in the pulpit and say sisters you must wear your skirts this low and you can't have a slip this high and you can't listen to this type of music we don't make converts and Christians by government we we don't have some legislators sitting on a board and we've elected official officials of the message who are going to tell us what we can listen to and tell us what where we can go and tell us how to dress there's only one person that does that and that is the person of the word that is the Lord Jesus Christ himself and when you actually get born again and the life of Jesus Christ comes into you he tells you how to talk he tells you how to dress he tells you how to act he tells you when to go to church he tells you when to go to work he tells tells you when to pray he tells you when to think about your brother he tells you all things because you are not a servant you are a friend you are not just a church you are the bride you are coming into a union where you are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh life of his life and power of his power you have come into a union where you're walking with him he has come and taken complete control of your mind let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus that's how we make converts by one Spirit are you baptized into this body how do I again be born again how do I know how to dress right be born again how do I know what music to listen to be born again how do I know what boy to marry be born again how do I know what girl to marry be born again be born again your Doctrine and your religion it's not going to save you there's only one thing that's going to save you and that's the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and as you walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all your sin this message is a message of Grace and until you get the person of the word the person of the message it'll start to rule your life it'll start to tell you what's pleasing to him it'll deal with you correct you love is corrective it's a revelation the Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you when what God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful isn't that beautiful now I don't want to stop short I want it all I want to speak to the mountain I want to speak squirrels I want to do it all now I I know it's not going to manifest that way in my life but in my heart I know I've seen an example I've seen a manifestation of one being restored into his position as a manifested Son of God so that tells me as a sheath way son you're coming just keep going just keep believing just keep listening you're coming into that stature of of a perfect man and when the time comes when I need you to speak the word don't worry you'll speak the word why because it's not you it's me in you and when you have the need just like Abraham it must have been he needed a ram how he Right Said the right thing oh I'm so thankful there's a bride of Christ that's saying the right thing what is she saying that's nothing but the truth that's nothing but the truth amen give it to me preacher bring the word at Thy word I'll let down my net amen be it unto me just say the right thing he goes on to say paragraph 455 and as the father has sent me so send I you Jesus said see now watch the father that sent sent him went in him to vindicate himself right for he was the word and and the same Jesus that sends you this don't get old to me cuz I need this I need to be reminded when a spooky Spirit comes around and starts whispering in your ear you need to take the word of God into a strong hand of Faith you say I'm weak no let me ask you something what faith do you got it's not your faith faith is a gift lest any man could boast and it's the faith of the Son of God then what little measure you feel you got take that word and the same Jesus that send you goes with you and in you to vindicate the same God as the father has sent me and I live by the father so I'll send you and you live by me what is he he's the word you live by the word the world totally insane possessed by an evil Spirit listening to all the lies of demons and and hell all around them totally insane but what about the Church of the Living God we have lost our carnal mind and we have taking on the mind of Christ we're speaking in unknown tongues in other languages we we we we speak about the the Seven Seals and and and and the son of man and things people don't even they probe at and they wonder and and some people think they know what you're talking about oh but if you got a revelation if you really have a revelation something that's been revealed to you and you've been changed nobody can take that away from you you're a Mystic you're you're totally insane to the world you try to people try to tell you they're Christians and you try to witness to them and tell them about what God has done in this age they're just like the Sadducees and Pharisees they're like well our father gave us man in the wilderness I like how brother Chris explained at one time he was witnessing to an individual and he just as he was talking to him he said I just saw the shades closing he gave me such such a visual I was like going back through my life uhuh Shades closing Shades closing Shades yep there there goes the shades you're witnessing to somebody like up here comes the drapes they they don't they don't want to hear it but you know what if he that has an ear to hear it's for the predestinated it's it's for the elected but some spooky Spirit wants to tell you that the days of Miracles are P some spooky Spirit wants to make you sick wants you to believe the symptoms he wants to tell you you'll never get the Holy Ghost you'll never get total Victory now I'm coming to the quote but we'll try to end along these lines by the help of God he says but what what do we do you pull up the greatest battle ever fought 422 what do we do so what do you do when this Devil Comes what what what are you going to do when you got to do spiritual warfare what are you going to do when when the devil's trying to trying to discourage you what do we do we take the sword which is the word of God pull it with what a hand

my strength Hallelujah goe it what is it I don't care what is that old spooky Spirit you take the word into your strong hand of faith and you start cutting down that old enemy the prophet of God said what we've seen in this day ought to put us into action what we've seen in our day ought to put you into action it ought to make you show up for communion it ought to make you dig into the message of the hour the prophet of God said when when the disciples received the promise go ye and ter in Jerusalem he said they were in action they were in the upper room he said what were they doing he said they were praising him for the promise they had received it yet but they received his word so they didn't have to wait for the manifestation because the promise was just as good as the manifestation so they were already praising him for it well what about you you might as well just go be put into action just start praising God until the promise is fulfilled you believe stay in action I'm going to have a body change H I'm going going to see the promised son I'm just going ahead and praising the Lord why are you praising the Lord I don't see no promised son yeah but I got the promise and if I

if you whack it the first time if it doesn't move whack it again and whack it again and whack it again and whack it until you chop a hole through it h some of us need to start whacking just start whacking take the word come on we heard a a powerful word this morning just keep whacking that devil at Thy word I'm going to let down the net I'm going to believe all things you're anointed to do it like a little Chen peeping itself out or an eagle what you are that's me peep yourself right on through that old Shell of sickness cut your way out and say hallelujah hallelujah where's the next one Glory I believe we had some victories this morning some people came up for prayer and they were delivered I say the bride of Christ should be looking around where's the next one hallu where is he at I think of the Mighty Men of Valor that were fighting with David they come in and they're fighting all them Philistines and they're just laying them down demon after demon and they're fighting and oh maybe one of them's getting tired and all they bump into one and they turn around and there's that Mighty anointed servant David looking over him says where's the next one I said that would inspire me

the Lord your God Deuteronomy 24 says for your lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemy enemies to save you Hallelujah Prophet goes on to say in the greatest battle he says I mean in uh I believe we're yeah greatest battle he says that's the battle that's the soldier that's the soldier of the Cross yes sir knock every enemy out why why why we a predestinated royal Seed of Abraham when Abraham denied everything that was against God's word oh what a place to be sitting you have the authority to deny everything that is against God's word he chopped his way right through every obstacle that come in front of him every obstacle whereever you got an obstacle tonight get to chopping let's get the victory I know we got communion I I got to deliver my burden I went through a battle today so somebody else can get a victory that old spooky Spirit tried to come up and press itself onto me and I had to do battle I had to know who I was I had to take the word of God and do battle not because it was me but greater is he that is in me it's the same formula what he did for me he'll do for you he's the same yesterday today and forever somebody just needs to start whacking you need to take the word into your hand and scream out Hallelujah just start chopping just start chopping that unbelief away and then you can be like Abraham you got family you want saved just chop away that unbelief say lot I'm coming for you where's the next one has Paul would testify in Romans 4:19 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God somebody in here mil as well just start giv glory to God the joy of the Lord is my strength I am predestinated my name was written on the last book of life before the foundation of the world there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin that's me that's me oh you talking about if you only knew what I was you want to know why I get happy you want to know why brother Orlando jumps up why because I know what I was but now I'm not that anymore because the grace of God got a hold of my life and he changed me now I can scream now I can shout now I can praise the Lord and there's therefore now no condemnation why because it's not me it's him and me it it it's not an explanation it's a revelation ha Thy word Lord look man's word will fail God's word will never fail that's right God's word will never fail coming towards the close I started my timer late it says I've only been 28 minutes brother randam says out of a Paradox maybe we can just we're on the last leg let's bring it home Christ is the word we all know the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live is that right that is the anointing now if you want to know why we're we're we're moving in this direction because the world's anointed so it's easy for us to see why do people go and shoot up parks and shoot up theaters and shoot up Schools they're anointed they're under a demonic spirit that has overtaken their mind and it's causing them to carry out actions of what they're Anointed with how well if you can see it in the negative you wonder how are you going to take a body change you wonder how you're going to do all things you wonder how you're going to speak to the mountain you're going to do it the same way the word world does all those things they give over to a reprobate mind you give over to the mind of Christ that has been unveiled through the revealing of the Seven Seals introducing you to the son of man that you can come in a union and that word can now be expressed through you you're being anointed you're being anointed we all know the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live now some of us aren't living the message you believe it but the anointing or the spirit hasn't come upon the word that you believe to make it live that's okay that's not condemnation that's letting you know that there's more for you to receive that comes on the word that makes the word live is that right that is the anointing I feel some days now everybody's scared of the anointing Everybody's scared of uh uh you know it's become taboo we we got to have it that's what it is Christ is the anointed who wants it the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart you believe in Divine Healing whatever more see and Christ the anointing coming to his body see the connection there just like husband and wife to become one now the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ become one he can anoint you listen this close he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the [Music] Bible all of it's yours everything is Promised at this age is yours just let down your net you have a need just let it down at Thy word every promise to this age is yours you want to know what's promised to this age Rapture it's yours Resurrection it's yours restoration it's yours healing it's yours salvation it's yours Deliverance it's yours every promise that's laying there it's yours it's time to take the strong word of faith and start cutting away demons and Devils said I'm taking every everything that belongs to me just receive it David didn't ask to be king he was chosen David didn't anoint himself the prophet came and anointed David what do you think the message is doing it's ano anointing you for a body change it's anointing you to believe all things it's anointing you to speak to the mountains it's anointing you to call those things that are not as though they are I'm anointed to say Satan give away in the name of Jesus Christ spooky Spirit you're defeated in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you're being anointed oh when you recognize really who you are watch out you are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also ain't greater than these speaking in creation how's it going to happen you're going to be anointed by what by the message of the hour the spirit of the message the spirit of the word coming upon you and making it live in its season not yesterday but I need a word today I don't have yesterday yesterday and I don't have tomorrow but I got tonight Lord may your anointing anoint this word and make it live now hallelujah oh glory to God you are of God little children and greater is he that is in you well you ought to act like it you ought to talk like it you ought to walk like it you ought to dress like it you ought to shout like it you ought to praise God like it why are you so happy I thought you going through the greatest battle you ever fought in your life I am why do you keep screaming Hallelujah because I know greater is he that is in me than who's in this trial I know greater is he that is in me that's taken me into a body change I know greater is he that is in me that's going to anoint me to believe all things oh Hallelujah we'll find a place to close friends we got to stay true to the message we need Revelation not explanation that's exactly what Saul tried to offer David that one time well you know why don't you try this it's worked for me D I prove this man you you're trying to tell me how to dress and how to act and I can't alls I know is one day I was tending to my father's sheep and I needed a miracle and there come a bear and God anointed me another time I was sick and God anointed me one day I needed help I needed salvation and God anointed me well how are you going to get through this trial the same way the same God who saved me the same God that Sanctified me the same one's going to deliver me the same one that called me he's going to be the one that finishes me how you going to have a body change the same way the same God the same promise the same anointing The Same Spirit the same message y'all don't give up on me yet yay try to we're still in along those lines there's some long lines I apologize David said in Psalms 23 yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil I tell you what that sounds like a spooky place what are you talking about David why you walking through valleys of Shadows of death though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies and Lady o and a wicked age where every Devil's trying to eat you up God has prepared a table a seven course meal seven Thunders uttering out revealing the son of man spiritual food and do just take a bite feed on me feed on the body work of the son of man Hallelujah you're feeding tonight thou preparest a table before me the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and Mer Mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever oh David went through some hard battles David was challenged David had not only his enemies after him but even those of the household of faith after him did David have to fear sure he was a man he could worry but the prophet of God said that didn't bother him why he knew he was anointed that's the god that delivered me from that lion the god that delivered me from the paws of that bear he'll more than that deliver me from that Philistine I'm calling that Philistine a spooky Spirit we come to defeat a spooky Spirit tonight it will deliver me from that spooky Spirit here I come I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel amen didn't pray through he was already pray through God prayed him through before the foundation of the world he was anointed for the job he had to speak and go forward that's all there was to do about it just speak and go forward that's all there was to do come on church you've been anointed for the job you might as well go ahead and just speak the word you've already been prayed through what do you got a fear take it on you got some spooky Spirit trying to tell you all these lies and all these things about you say devil I'm coming in the name of the Lord you spooky Spirit I'm going to take your head off oh if we could know that we're being anointed for the job David had a job to do but the problem is that it didn't bother him because he was anointed for it friends don't you see

aive oh and oh and our [Music] god oh and I oh [Music] I hallelujah what a word tonight you know you think about what the world is Anointed with and they do all that they do and as our brother said there will be just few years years back those people will be in a mental institution but will say that man will be Anointed with the devil and they would have a strength more than 10 people you know even 10 people can hold them down and they would do things and is describe this woman who was basically crawling through her back and just doing things impossible he said if it would have caught him by his hand it would have broke him now we know the devil ain't close to what our God is we know he doesn't even come near to what God is his creator if the creation can do such a thing how about our creator himself anointing You by his word tonight hallu you know it just breaks my heart and I'll be honest you think the Church of the Living God will be packed T ey you think people with the needs and everything that people struggle with you think they'll run used to be a time where someone is sick you would rather take him to church than to the [Music] hospitals what has happened to us the word is preached and God is here calling his people and wooing them to come and trying to show you that he's got everything that you have need of [Music] but people rather run to the left and run to the right than come to him is here tonight he's here everywhere his word is being preached he's there to make it reality to you he doesn't want you to get out of here with some explanation or some words that some men said no we read the quot is preach as by a Matthew just expending and preach and preach God is here to tell you that's my word that's my word I will make every bit of it a reality if you will stand on it if you're willing to believe it and walk out of here go with it I will come everywhere I will destroy the devil on your way it's him doing it in us he doesn't say go and fight figure out how no you just take the word you just pronounce the word you go by the word you obey the word you just follow what he's saying and he's doing the battle for you that's right here we are but we know it's a promise that the very bride will only be in the minority it's not going to be a popular gospel it's only the elected that will be attracted and we want to do our best we want to do all that we can so that the Fulfillment of the prophecy that the fullness of God that was promised to be p for into us I love that the same way that the father sent him he's sending you how did the father send him the father that send him went in him all that God was poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church and now we get scared we start measuring all what do you mean by all no his body will do everything that he did If he if he have salvation his body will give salvation if he rais the dead his body will raise salv will do Sal whatever he did his body is here to do the same thing otherwise it's not that's why he said the prde has to be a word prde not another bride the same God manifested in his people yet a little while the world will see me no more but ye shall see me because I'll be in you but even in you Hallelujah the only way to see Christ is to see his people today amen oh my I just feel like we're could just continue but we have communion let's open our Bibles for our communion scripture reading 1 Corinthians 13 First Corinthians 11 I'm sorry we read that man I just feel like God has been wanting more and more to show us how close we are to this Finish Line his word I I don't know about you every time it's preached it just comes with more intensity and more power and more revealing and and and and the more is showing us so we could be ready so we can know that we are running the he doesn't want us to live by ourselves he doesn't want us to depend on our own selves he want us to depend on him amen 1 Corinthian 11 and 23 it says for I have received of the Lord that which I have also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus Christ the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it he broke it and said take eat this is my body which was broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood do this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me it says for for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till I till he come it says wherefore whatsoever shall eat this bread and drink this his cup um of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood of the body and the blood of the Lord but let every man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation uh to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and and and sickly among you and many sleep for if you would judge if if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but uh we but when we are judge we are chasen of the Lord and we that and that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when we come together to eat Terry one for another and I think that's important and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye may ye that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will set in order when I come amen you may be seated I just want to we're going to do communion a little differently than we've done it before I'm sure you see these stables and you wonder what's going on and so we're going to do it a little differently so we want if you're sitting on this row and you're sitting on this other row we want you to come out in the middle so those that are sitting here you come this way e e e e e e e e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for oh [Music] h e for being ended the devil having put into the heart of Judah his carot Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God he raised it from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a tile and GED himself and after he had poured water into a basin and he began to wash his disciple feet and he wiped them with a towel wherewith he was skirted then comeing to uh Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord uh do thou wash my feet they said Jesus answered and said unto him and said what I do thou knoweth not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answer him if I wash thee not that has no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head and Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every width ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after he had washed his feet and has taken His Garment and and was sat down again and said unto them know ye what I have done to you ye call me master and Lord and ye say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet what an example all he was bringing it together to just show them how important it is that is done unto you you do to others bringing them all the circle full around for for bringing the understanding at this final to say that all of this is symbolism is will say that men will not kneel down to wash one another's feet but at the same time the understanding of the importance of what is what is imparted to us that we should also give it to others it said uh if if if then I your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another feet and I said for I have given you an example that you shall do as I have done unto you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither that neither he that is sent greater than him that send him if ye know these things happy are ye if he do them amen amen the sisters will go to the place and we'll meet together after fruit washing amen e e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
