all these years you ask you to bless us and help us less brother paul this evening as he brings the word in jesus wonderful name we pray amen i mean i thought i'd just take a moment to give you a little update on myself as you know i got in the car accident and everything was going really good for two or three days and then something started happening and so they diagnosed me with post concussion syndrome so i i go through spells of losing my thought and the doctor told me i shouldn't preach for at least four weeks because he said you're liable to say something just come out of your mouth because well i told i told him i've already done that so but and i told him that's not gonna happen so i'm gonna have to limit the amount of times that i preach maybe just sunday mornings and then it's four to six weeks and so i i just want to let you know it could have been worse you know i thought i i was so mad at myself for wrecking my truck i never did thank the lord for probably from what he really preserved me from because when your egg airbags go off you've been hit pretty hard so i just want to thank the lord so the lord will be my potion he'll be my grace and and so if i seem a little out of it it's only in my head my heart loves the lord my spirit feels him and i'm not supposed to read i'm not supposed to be in any type of social gathering i'm not supposed to listen to any loud noises i thought i'm not supposed to live and and he told me he says well you just got to sleep it off so anyway none of that fits my personality but i think i can do all those things with your prayer and your grace so i'm grateful to have brother paul with us tonight to help us in the labor i'm sure that you'll enjoy the things that he has to share with you and and so just keep me in your prayers and i know i'll get better a lot quicker that way so god bless you we love you so much we will try to be with you sunday morning please extend to me all the grace you can and if i slip up don't chuckle too loud but we will pick up in the message that we're reading from is this the rising of the sun it is the rising of the sun publishing amazing grace if you would as we invite our brother to break the word of the lord to us we appreciate his spirit his family so much amen [Music] foreign [Music] when we when we realized what we were gonna consider when we consider everything that you've done for us father we can surely understand that the the the meaning of this song and to tell you sincerely now that we are going to your word father no one was able to look at it and to open it only you that's where that was worthy i see priesthood and then we ask that you provide you give us your grace for the same plans to remarket you right father to be instruments that you can use to speak to us yourself because we all have need of this word when we pray to you oh no this is in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ and i thank for the david for the opportunity to speak to you tonight new zealand ponder bible don't release the norm let's open our bibles in numbers uh chapter 13. diversity eventually we're going to read from verse 25 to 30. and then we're going to and then we're going to go to numbers 14. and we'll read verse 24 if you're new zealand and then we'll go to genesis 21 numbers chapter 13 i'll let brother billy read directly in english duventhenka from verse 25 to 30 says and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of peren to kaddish and brought back words unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruits of the land and they told him and said we come we come unto the land where wherewith thou sendeth us and surely it flows with milk and honey and this and this is the fruits of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and all the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there the amalekite dwelled in the land of the south and hate sites in the and the jebusite and they uh hammerites dwelled in the land and the and uh in the land dwelled in the mountain and the canaanites dwelled in by the sea by the coast of jordan and caleb still the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well and able to overcome it normal catholic verse numbers chapter 14 and verse 24 it says but my servant caleb because he had he had another spirit within with him and that followed me fully him will i bring into the land wherein to i went and his seed shall possess it and let's go to genesis chapter 24 and verse 20 58 chapter 24 and verse 58. 58 and they called rebecca and said unto her will that go with this man and she said i will go. may the lord have blessing at the reading of his word you may have your seats come on david said uh when as a as a minister you i i hope you'll be praying for me uh [Music] from these few scriptures that we read tonight i'm going to title my sermon tonight la frieza de la decision [Music] two types of people that took very important and we know that making decisions is something that happens daily upon the decision every day we must make decisions in what we're doing the type of living that we live it's our decision everything that we're doing there's a decision that we must make shock thing and every time we make a decision there's something that's happening behind that decision like as humans obviously it's happened to all of us do to have made a decision within the time frame of our life and to regret the decision that was made the next day and come to the realization that we made the wrong decision but there is only one man who doesn't make that decision twice that first decision that he made is the best party because he knows the end before the beginning and he knows everything that person's the jew and that person is god it's a jeweler and that god vanessa wants to bring us upon no decision on his people to take our decisions in following him because every time we make a decision in following the word of god we are sure that we are not going wrong that and we have the impression that everything has gone dark after the decision as long as that decision was taken according to the cro the conduct of god as long as that decision was made by the word of god japan god will take care of everything we see our father abraham he was a i i i dollared her he was a a pagan god came to him you just saw the thumping he said come out of your country come out of your house come out of your people abraham was conscious that this was god but that knowledge because in the decision to know is it god who's behind us that's a jerky new country is it god who's leading us it could be that in some occasions that god doesn't speak to us by means of dreams god didn't speak to us by audible voices abraham when he heard the voice of god abraham simply obeyed abraham abraham came out but when abraham came out in our country exactly then god asked him to separate himself son god was asking him to come alone the people the decision the most important decisions so that this is not individual it's the decision that i made alone but it's the question of the individual with god gentle what we regardless of the age of that we can come to god and god can speak to us he went to this country god separated him from his father he took he took his dad god separated him from lord talk to him and god made him a promise that he would have a child by sarah it was something that was difficult to believe sometimes we find ourselves in situations was it really god then when before we testified that it was god but abraham waited 25 years when god fulfilled the promise exactly isaac came on the scene is that god gave him isaac who was the heart of abraham when isaac was growing up that the heart of abraham was attached to isaac he knew that he had a uh he had a descendant he had somebody posted he had a posterity as you saw junior power one day the same god came to him he said abraham give me your son dominic your only son if it was you or not abraham knew that god made him the problem it's god who gave him the son earth and if god gave him a son that he was able to resurrect him back abroad abraham made a decision [Music] to offer this child across the city because of that decision god told abraham god of this decision that posterity your prosperity your seed will possess the gates of the enemy you will have a great seed a great multitude of prosperity why of course you like decisions because of the decision that abraham made because abraham made the right decision because abraham trusted god a young man wants to make a decision to marry a young lady and make a reference in the word of god exactly it's the same same thing when isaac started growing up abraham realized that his son had to marry 18 that they had to be a bride for isaac there was there was really a attractive young lady in the country where they were living but they were all uh unbelievers they were not christians the the abraham's heart desire it was not the external beauty it was a he wanted a woman from the pure race it says the the uh abraham the april visitation to gabriel visitation to uh daniel he was telling to the young lady who were there it says i find you very attractive very pretty it says a beautiful woman a beautiful girl the selfie a young man who who desire or deserve to be married will have the same opinion that i do that's what i'm saying to say that abraham in that time he said that isaac had to have a good bride that's why them tells us that for for the young ones that are in i remember a story when i was younger we had a young sister [Music] she basically turned down all the young men that were uh uh coming to her basket don't stop she wanted somebody that would meet her picture yeah and then there was a a a brother from a denominational come to her it comes to domain and because that that the denominational brother met the physical criteria that she was looking for she said well he's also a christian they got married [Music] one week later she called the brother tells the sister yeah you know that too he says when he said under no circumstance that a believer should marry an unbeliever but in order for him to tell us in details he just said under no circumstances and she knew what she was going against and for abraham [Music] he wanted a good wife of isaac and and says abraham was a type of god exactly and isaac was a type of christ and abraham had to find a servant to whom he had to give the word king david a certified oh the message that was to be carried to the woman who was going to marry isaac to the uh uh isaac's bride he looked among his servants he found it to to found a servant who was faithful who was loyal he speaks about that servant god's looking for men today that will move when this that will move when the spirits move in portland what will prelate anywhere that they ever that he may send tessella and service that's the moral servant a nusselt muslim not only that mcconaughey as a destination but when he got to his place where his message now was a message devoted to deliverance why this message was to be given he never boasted of himself never eliza never spoke of himself he never spoke about how great he was oh how great is his meetings or how great anything about himself [Music] and of his master's wealth these documents are met at the emphasis and that that his master had a son that was going to fall air to everything that the master had killed but that blood and service what a beautiful picture of a real servant of god his all attention was on the master remember telling the people not about himself imagine but all about the master and about his son and he's going to fall heir to all things in the past let you met at the feast he had so much time talking about the master and the son until he had not until he had no time to boast of himself that denomination he's his denomination also oh his affiliations to to to that everything is centered on the master he had no time to talk about himself about telemundo it was always about the master that would speak his thoughts is centered on the master says paragraph 18. it says then again and he kept questioning what if a woman won't come is the person what if nobody believes this message what if nobody believes i'll practice your name when i tell her of these things what if she doesn't come consider what then allah departed then he had to make a decision allah when he had heard from his master's lips launch the era or devote it to us the angel of the lord shall go before you he said oh i love that god oh it says oh just it just just fits my my case right there that's what i'm speaking it says what god did with elisa it says that just fits my case lost jesus the angel of the lord shall go before you and he will persuade her you always all that you have to say it says go you bring my message and i myself will go before you i myself will persuade them that this woman to whom i will ask to give me of water the one who will give me to drink it and then after that we'll drink the will give the the bible says before he can even finish his prayer when he left up his eyes he saw a beautiful young lady coming he said young lady gave me to drink it the young lady says not just you i will give you the dreams and i will give of all your camels a perfect fulfillment of the prayer why but with abundance because he made the right decision because he made he put god before his decision and when he made that decision god was obligated to go with him god was obligated to hear that prayer because he made the right decision rebecca showed the virtue of of of of the virtuous woman the camels they drink a lot but rebecca brought water for all of them when elisa saw that he saw the fulfillment of his prayer he saw the fulfillment of the word he had no doubt that rebecca was the one who was who was sent for isaac begin to talk about the greatness of of abraham and of isaac he went he went even to the rebecca's family god didn't send him empty-handed eliza went with riches avec they don't he went with gifts affected with with gifts when god sends a servant johnny god himself will equip him god will give him everything that he has needed for the fulfillment of the word if you are unless you are a servant who is sent by god you cut it up under like a journalism that you let yourself be used by god before what i'm doing says it says when they took this man to the hotel only i donate i need some help here so this man came and he was given two gifts for him to take care of the the man who was beaten it and and this person and these two gifts don't act but says god gives his servants the word he saw he he was able to show rebecca just what the the the the what the gifts were and what those things that was given were god sent us a messenger in this end times god sent us william branham he shows us the wealth of the kingdom of god and those things didn't belong to william brown those things didn't belong to rebecca those things belong to abraham but william branham had to bring them and give them to the bride it was not things given to him for him to boast about himself it was only proof cannot be proof that our bridegroom his elbow god does not report that the one who sent our bridegroom that when we come to him we'll have everything that we have made that there was nothing impossible to him [Applause] oh what a precious message oh what a precious message oh glory to god for this message all glory to god for this message i can already imagine oh what a wonderful day will be rebecca was excited and the next day eliza said god has made my mission accomplished god has heard my prayer we have to go [Music] the brothers and the sisters and the parents of rebecca they said oh let us stay 10 days with us sometimes the things of this world sometimes our friend our friends and the people of this world sometimes the things of the flesh it can make the lay of decisions but rebecca was so excited rebecca knew there was nothing in this world that will give her the same satisfaction that the brothers rebecca's brothers they are also preachers they don't want us to get too excited so we can go meet isaac but rebecca was excited rebecca believed the message the parents came and told her oh rebecca you know we love you a lot you know if you believe this message you know you're so young do you know what you're gonna look like [Applause] i remember when i was i was still in high school i was about 17. it was a friend from school who came to see me he said paul [Music] because your way of acting it doesn't fit with the young if you're a god i said glory to god you know what you said you that are young when you have the desires of the youth come and when the family came to see her he said oh can you stay they asked her to stay with him he didn't know she said no eliza told me that my lord isaac he's impatient he wants to see me he said can you stay with us the family said okay we'll go ask rebecca when they ask rebecca the question rebecca said i don't know the road i've never seen ice again but he told me about isis the way he described isis the way he presented to me the gift of isaac when he when he showed me the power of isis i couldn't wait i have to go i'm going now and when rebecca made that decision just like by prophecy his brothers who were not with abraham when abraham when god told abraham we don't have to wait for god to make decisions on our behalf [Music] you'll see that all that were victorious they made a decision look at david that's your number this young man innocent innocent guinness combat who never shaking before god it's just like kids and when gay this little young man david shows up he looks at everybody just moving aside david looked at it oh they said david hide hide he said what's going on look goddammit when david looks he went he sees and uncircumcised everybody else they were looking at the giant but when david looks he sees an uncircumcised he says what's the problem who can uh come and curse the army of the living god who's this uncircumcised david didn't know what to do david was persuaded that if i go in the name of the lord jesus as regardless of what's going to happen to me i will be victorious it is your validity it says aggravate him his armor on him when he tried to walk he couldn't walk he said i'll take this off i'll go to fight him with what he looks around he looks around he a pocket with seven stones in the name of jesus five stones just to see that it says i have what i have need off in order for me to stand in front of this circumcision david made a decision and because of that decision i could have said god because of this great decision god was obligated to go with david with a simple stone god brought down goliath god only needs what we already have sometimes the decision the most important decision what all god is asking is because of the power the decision that he made we read the story the children of israel god brought him out of egypt in a miraculous way they have seen miracles like no other people have seen these villa they saw the power of god let them play on egypt let there ten plagues in egypt he comes and he stands between them and the phil and the egyptians but regardless of all those things yeah they are in caddesh barnia [Music] and when they came back when it came time to give the report these people that had seen all that god did from egypt it's a good country that flows with milk and honey we know that the message is good give us a message just to leave this message no now you know like in front of them we look just like grasshoppers and ashes were arguing about this and the people were shaking and people were asking themselves questions was it not that was is it because there were no tombs in nature so we can go back to egypt they didn't even think how are they going to do so they can cross back the right side because that god was no longer with them and has the world discouraging the people can't let caleb he says shut up take them keep quiet i made a decision that i'm going to meet those people just say i know if they are big measure celsius but i also know that you know that god has promised us this country that i promised the jew that the promise of god is over the heights of these people for me that if god has promised something that is able to give us what he promised my decision is to god the way god has asked me to go god told him and if god said and if he said he said he watches over his promise to fulfill them as christians when we take the word of god when we take the message of god regardless of the enemy or the devil that under no circumstances one time manufacturing that he can bring us to believe that our god is incapable of because he's always able he made a good decision a right decision in his life he was talking about a story about in a meeting a prophecy came out in french there was someone who prophesied when barbara was preaching and the prophecy was saying because you chose the harder way the more difficult road pasco don't propagate because you walk on your own will cut your pillow this is your correct that you made the right decision a and precisely and because it's my way i caught a certain part of this because of this important decision [Music] look a portion of heaven will be given unto you glorious decision beca what an important choice decision that the one that you have chosen in that decision there will come a tremendous victory and it will be fulfilling love the vine [Music] the same way that caleb made the right choice the right decision and god told caleb i caught the target because of your decision there is a morsel or a portion of the land that's waiting for you over there god also told william branham because of this decision there is a portion of heaven awaiting for you the power of decision when we make the right decision there and not let the little things of the world attract our attention but you know some defeated that we are sons and daughters of god that we are sons and daughters of god but god is calling us to make the right decision tells the story if there was a preacher when he was preaching there was a brother who came he said he said i gave my life to the lord yes and i will give my testimony i will tell how i gave my life to the lord the pastor said oh glory to god he did your affliction he said oh bro i am really happy to know that you finally made the right decision but i want to know tell he said what is it of the sermon that i preached oh what's what what what or what part of the scripture i read or what song what marvelous song we sang guitar that has brought you to come and make this decision did it possible he said because some pluton because i don't want to hurt your feelings is that because there's many times that you come to church but we knew that you were a a very uh uh you were angry person that you were you were mistreating your wife that you spend all your money in alcohol that you you you left you you lived the wrong kind of life what preaching what sermon caused you to make this decision what [Music] is that you preach wonderful sermons and we sing we sing wonderful songs but it wasn't dead that brought me to bring to come and make this decision where i work because i want to be like you i mean bring me where your god is suppose and that's how i came here to give my life to the lord that god can speak to us through preaching god can speak to us through songs god can speak to us through the lives of the christians that's why god wants to bring us for one another and that's a decision that we have to make because the bible tells us in second peter chapter one when they speak about the stature of the perfect man they are defeated for peter's saying that make do make all your efforts that we have to do all that we can allah that we can bring from the faith we had virtue patients we have to make our decisions to follow the lord the decision to receive this holy spirit not not just to be happy to come to church it's good to come to church it's good to be a member who's known by all but god doesn't need that god wants us to be on fire he says he said i'm guilty with you i've made up my mind by the help of god of god's grace see not rejoice forth the faith by help and grace of god and if our god will give me the strength to do it i'm determined to press towards the mark till death shall set me free god be my helper to do so help me in my prayer it's my prayer seeing my works seeing the things that i have seen and that you have seen and lagging behind because of a spiritual be because it is spiritual enemy and because and become a spiritual amnesia in paragraph 102 he says oh how we need to pray [Music] now we'll get it says now we'll get back to you again do you realize that we don't pray half as much as our father did do you know that we don't put much time on our knees as the pastors before us did women do you realize that you don't instruct your daughter and pray with her at night like your mother did i did you allah connected to her then what about it who is guilty we are guilty there is no way around it we i'm guilty of not doing the job of of god like i should do i'm confessing it yesterday that i'm wrong i'm asking god to be merciful to me i look out here and see all the opportunities that i've missed because of little things of all the insignificant things that didn't mean nothing i want to do more i'm ashamed of myself as a as a gospel minister i repent before god and i asked god to forgive me for the truth and the church to forgive me for being so dilatory about the work of god well i gutted you by the grace of god if i let the jews and by the help of god i'll not listen to what everything every everyone trying to tell me tell you something to do fairfax they've got a program they've got something for you to do no nelly program did you nonsense i know the program i know i know god's program it's written out here in the bible and i'm ashamed of myself as a minister of the gospel [Music] how many souls you you won since you've been a christian if you are not winning souls you are guilty christianity just goes from one to another how many souls have you won since you've become you've been a christian how many people you've got out here out you've got out for wednesday night per meeting if you are not doing it you ought to be ashamed of yourself before christ you are when we realize everything that is done for the lord and we re when we we look at what we ourselves what we are doing it's time that we make a decision to serve this lord says if the musician could come that when you come in contact with the lord in that time in other words the consequence of the spirit coming upon you you will be my witnesses god gives us his holy spirit god fills us with this holy spirit that we may become his witnesses that we may speak to somebody else about this message in if in some things we ask ourselves questions are we in the will of god or not the only thing that we are sure to be on when preach the good news to all the creatures if we cannot preach if we cannot exalt let's live a christian life it will attract somebody it will be a sermon to somebody it will be a true sermon to somebody who will try to be like you and who will give his life to the lord let's bow our heads father through this few words that are put together i believe that you've spoken to us and father even myself i feel guilty that i will make my biggest decision father to consecrate my life the time of my life to do something for you oh god i gave you my brother i gave him i give you my sister we are we give ourselves back into your hands come and be merciful to us give us your grace because we know when we make a decision that you will be behind that decision your power will follow that decision your blessing will follow that decision tonight you can do it with us also because you haven't changed the fact that you're the best and you may you you you have no respect of people we commit ourselves back to you bless once again the church bless and all the members of that god this father that you give us grace that we may look to you and to make a right decision to follow you regardless of everything because we know that you

responsibility with what you've given us lord some of us may be better with words as we might witness to someone out on the streets or to work some of us lord may be better with just a life not a lot spoken lord but we do have the responsibility to make sure that this message is shown to the world i pray lord that each time that we're given that opportunity that we meet that challenge sometimes we'll be the only one that someone will see and they'll recognize christ in us they may never open a bible they may never hear a sermon lord but we need to have a life that's on display even as brother paul spoke tonight a type of rebecca when we first heard this message we we were so in we were so enthused lord that we didn't maybe know what we would call rules or regulations or how to dress or what to do or how to act lord but you allowed the holy spirit to come over us and brood and speak to us and start to show us your mind and what your thoughts were lord and that's what's shaping us in this last hour lord i pray that each one was dealt with tonight accordingly may we go out of here lord living a life for you that is worthy of this gospel we love you and commit all things into your hands we ask in jesus name amen amen amen man joe is the flag from [Music] from the castle [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you
