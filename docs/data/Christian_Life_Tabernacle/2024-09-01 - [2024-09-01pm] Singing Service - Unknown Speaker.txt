I took some time because I was Finding looking for a way to say this in English but no but I want to glorify the name of the Lord Jesus just sharing a little bit how I met the Lord through the message I grew up in the the the church that was denomination and they taught us that John the Baptist was the last prophet and that there was no other one after him so it was a horrible fight in my family and I was on the side of the Apostolic Church the denomination in which we [Music] were one day I heard a little testimony he was in a church where they were preaching the message and I began to cry for no reason and in my heart I made a brief prayer and I said Lord if this message comes from you I want to be a part of it I don't know how much time passed after [Music] that but one day my father came to church he was one of those who accepted the message from the beginning he was so enthused to share what God had revealed to him about the serpent seed and we were watching the television and he was so enthus he wanted to share I said oh Dad okay Dad talk to me I sat with him on the table and he began to share to me through the scriptures what was the serp seat when he finished he pointed at me but I I could tell that was not my father he said Do you believe it and I said yes at that moment I began to cry [Music] I felt like I was transported to another place where there was no time there's no words it was like a place where you talked from heart to heart he knows I will stand before him someday and this is the truth I saw how an angel came from behind me by through the door of my house in Mexico and he stood right next to me and he told [Music] me that remembered the prayer you had made and he showed me the little corner where I would hide to pray he said this is your answer I hope it can help somebody that God still answers God's still the same and he's with us even tonight [Music] I think he put his right hand on my head and he raised his other hand to Heaven he said Don't Fear you'll be there so I have an appointment sometimes it looks difficult it looks impossible but my God is a god of the [Applause] [Music] impossibilities for [Music] ohel for [Music]
