[42:40] tonight may you help us Lord because we
[42:43] count on you in everything that we do we
[42:45] love you and ask these things in the
[42:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[42:49] amen amen God bless you welcome you back
[42:51] in the house of God Amen let's open our
[42:54] Bibles and amen let let's open to 1
[42:58] Corinthians uh chapter 13 a very
[43:02] familiar scripture
[43:03] [Music]
[43:05] reading man did you enjoy the word this
[43:07] morning amen I trust that the Lord spoke
[43:10] to you I was telling the brothers in the
[43:12] back I said uh you already have your
[43:15] lunch so this is just going to be a
[43:18] dessert tonight
[43:20] so lower your expectations
[43:28] 1 Corinthians 13 uh let's read verse one
[43:31] it says though I speak with
[43:34] tongues of men and Angel and have no
[43:37] charity I'm become as a sounding brass
[43:41] and a tinkling symbol and though I have
[43:45] the gift of Prophecy and understand all
[43:48] Mysteries and knowledge and all
[43:51] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[43:54] that I could move Mountain I have not I
[43:57] have not charity I have I'm nothing now
[44:01] I want you to realize this just struck
[44:03] me as I was looking at it so he's saying
[44:05] that even though I have faith so that I
[44:08] could move mountains so there could be a
[44:11] faith that I can actually move the
[44:13] mountains but if it's not connected to
[44:15] charity it's nothing and then it says
[44:18] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[44:21] poor and I have I have my body to be
[44:25] burned
[44:27] and I have not
[44:29] charity it profited no me nothing now
[44:33] now this one is even
[44:35] striking because now is even saying that
[44:38] you can feed the poor you can feed the
[44:41] hungry you can take your body as a
[44:44] sacrifice it's still not connected to
[44:50] charity charity suffers long and now
[44:53] it's giving you the definition of what
[44:56] charity is talking about so he gives you
[44:59] the definition of what man thinks
[45:01] charity is what men would think charity
[45:04] is what love is the according to mankind
[45:07] according to men's definition to be to
[45:10] give yourself to do all of this to feed
[45:12] the poor now he's giving you what the
[45:15] true charity definition is Charity
[45:17] suffers long suffer long and is kind
[45:21] charity Envy not charity vaed not itself
[45:25] and is not puffed up do not uh do not
[45:30] behave itself unseemingly seeketh not
[45:33] our own glory is not easily provoked
[45:35] thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in
[45:38] iniquity Rejoice but rejoiceth in truth
[45:42] beareth not beareth all things believe
[45:45] all things hoping on all things endureth
[45:48] all things charity never fail but where
[45:52] it says but whether there is there be
[45:55] prophecy they shall fail whether there
[45:58] be tongues they shall cease whether
[46:01] there be knowledge it shall it shall
[46:03] vanish away but now it says but we know
[46:08] in part and we prophesy in part but when
[46:11] that which is perfect is
[46:13] come then that which is in part shall be
[46:16] done away with when I see when I was a
[46:18] child I spake as a child I understood as
[46:21] a child I taught as a child then when I
[46:23] become a man I put away childish things
[46:26] it says for we for for now we see
[46:29] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[46:33] face now I knowing part but then shall
[46:37] know as I shall know even as I am known
[46:41] it says and now abideth faith hope
[46:44] charity these three it says but the
[46:48] greatest of these is Charity gracious
[46:52] father we ask you bless you to us in the
[46:54] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God
[46:56] bless you may have your seats amen we we
[46:59] certainly enjoy the word this morning
[47:01] and I like I said I'll try to be very
[47:04] short in fact I believe if I just stop
[47:07] here it'll be good
[47:10] right like brother Matthew said it's
[47:12] extremely tempting um but I I believe
[47:17] that you came for a little more than
[47:18] that amen and we'll just try to add to
[47:21] it we we believe as we heard this
[47:23] morning that we thank God for the
[47:25] revealing of the word
[47:27] um and I'll just try to just Pace myself
[47:31] so I don't take too much time we thank
[47:33] God for
[47:35] predestination we we thank God for the
[47:37] end time manifestation of Jesus Christ
[47:40] and and I want to say we can the the
[47:43] word the revealed word of God to the
[47:46] believer it gives us the boldness to
[47:48] come before the Throne of God and to
[47:51] know that the promise belonged to us as
[47:54] we heard it this morning we the the word
[47:57] and the revealing of the hour is for you
[48:00] you you don't have to be ashamed of it
[48:02] you don't have to come and wondering is
[48:05] God going to give me is he going to
[48:07] chase me is he going to love me what is
[48:09] he going to do no it's the promise for
[48:12] the hour we can come as we heard this
[48:15] this morning whatever we have need of
[48:18] the word of God has been made available
[48:20] so we can go in and take what belongs to
[48:23] us it's been given to us by
[48:25] predestination not because of our
[48:27] goodness not because of what we have
[48:30] done or what we could do no it's been
[48:33] given to us by
[48:35] predestination God elected and chose us
[48:38] so we could be partakers of his divine
[48:41] nature we didn't ask for it we didn't
[48:43] come and cry out for it no he chose us
[48:46] now remember there are people that are
[48:48] more sincere than we are there are
[48:50] people that are a lot better than we are
[48:53] they are good they are they can they
[48:55] have all of these things they people are
[48:58] that some people are born patient you
[49:00] see them and you can scream at them they
[49:02] just look at you and you know and you
[49:04] wonder oh my I wish I could have that
[49:06] you know so but it's not even given for
[49:09] that this is the patience that comes by
[49:11] the word of God so he he he elected us
[49:14] he made us what we are and and we can
[49:17] come with boldness and know that these
[49:19] things are mine we I love what our
[49:22] brother said it's like we we are not
[49:24] afraid to come but whatam says we have
[49:26] been given the seven Coast meal we can
[49:29] come at the table and not wonder if you
[49:31] ever gone to a uh you know I was
[49:34] thinking the best I could think of is uh
[49:36] like a a dinner for work you know you
[49:38] show up at the restaurant everything is
[49:40] paid off you know you don't have to pay
[49:42] for anything you know what you do you go
[49:44] to the menu you find what is the highest
[49:47] price you you try the frag that you
[49:50] never ate before you know you you take
[49:53] the tomahawk you know you're not going
[49:54] to finish it it's paid for and and the
[49:58] promises of God are paid for for you you
[50:01] don't have to pay for it just come and
[50:03] eat at the T at the table and yet we are
[50:06] you know we like oh is this mine am I
[50:09] really deliver am I really healed it's
[50:11] yours it's been paid for show up and
[50:16] eat than Lord you know if if if you're
[50:19] not healed you're not eating enough just
[50:22] go and eat and eat and eat brother Ram
[50:24] says it's like that seed what says when
[50:27] the seed is put in the ground the only
[50:29] thing the farmer has to do is just
[50:31] continue to pour water continue to pour
[50:34] water but it's the seed responsibility
[50:37] to continue to drink of that water it
[50:39] will drink it will sayam says one place
[50:41] that he has to drink more than its own
[50:44] portion and when he drinks one time
[50:46] what's going to happen is the seed is
[50:48] going to burst forth and produce what
[50:50] the promise was so my advice to you is
[50:54] continue to eat continue to ask ask for
[50:57] things that are impossible continue to
[50:59] ask for things that you couldn't pay for
[51:02] things that you couldn't afford why
[51:04] because he already paid for you you just
[51:06] come and enjoy
[51:08] it we can stop right there but we'll
[51:11] just take St so I'll be measuring every
[51:14] step and if I feel like that's it we'll
[51:16] just
[51:17] stop I yeah so I I was thinking about
[51:22] this and and as we read remember this is
[51:26] in the book of Corinthians and we we
[51:29] know uh my we could just go so long um
[51:34] but when I'm will will talk and and and
[51:37] and here he says he speaks about charity
[51:40] being the greatest of all of them but if
[51:42] you go just if we could take a step back
[51:45] you know that bam will talk about even
[51:48] uh the book of Corinthians we understand
[51:50] it's the book of Correction so he he
[51:53] would talk about the difference between
[51:55] the Church of Corinthians and the Church
[51:57] of Ephesian the difference in the things
[52:00] that he found out so I'll just go
[52:02] quickly I I try to just uh uh uh put
[52:05] everything together so I don't have to
[52:07] preach longer I I realize when I talk I
[52:10] talk longer than when I look in my notes
[52:12] so so I'm trying to be really close
[52:14] really really so he talk about if you
[52:17] read the book of Corinthians one of the
[52:19] things some of the things you'll find
[52:20] out is that Paul was addressing is that
[52:23] were there were more uh uh giv into the
[52:27] gifts and and there was more issues with
[52:29] the Corinthian Church than there was
[52:31] with the Ephesians so if you go look
[52:33] butam says what Paul had to deal with
[52:36] them was not he there was nothing like
[52:38] that find found in the uh in the the
[52:41] Ephesian Church age so you will go
[52:43] you'll find out that there were division
[52:45] in the church some will say they were
[52:47] for Paul and some Apollo some and sephus
[52:50] so they had those people were divided in
[52:53] who they were following it's 1
[52:54] Corinthians 1:10 to7
[52:57] there was uh uh there was in them found
[53:01] that some sexual IM immorality issues
[53:03] that Paul had to address and lawsuit
[53:06] among brothers and and and even in
[53:08] regarding to marriage and and and
[53:10] singleness they had issues in the
[53:12] understanding of all those things and
[53:14] abuse of the spiritual gift and even the
[53:18] the the disorder in the church that they
[53:21] you know they were come and they didn't
[53:22] know how to place the gift in order
[53:24] there was confusion if about the
[53:27] understanding of the doctrine of
[53:29] Resurrection I I could I could give you
[53:31] a reference to all of this but I'm
[53:32] trying to go really quick but to find
[53:35] out that Paul will describe the Ephesian
[53:37] Church to be a solid church that they
[53:40] were more a little more established that
[53:43] that that he would come to them the
[53:44] things that he will speak to the
[53:47] Ephesians those things he couldn't speak
[53:49] to the Corinthians because there were
[53:51] still babes they still needed milk and
[53:53] he still didn't need to correct them
[53:55] every time every once he came
[53:57] his job was to put back in line and
[53:59] everything but when he came to the
[54:00] Ephesians Oh my he could speak to them
[54:03] with spiritual things and he will talk
[54:05] to them about predestination and unity
[54:07] in the body and the mystery of Christ
[54:10] and he will talk to them about the
[54:12] election and the calling of the church
[54:14] and spiritual warfare and strength and
[54:17] and living out the Christian Life by the
[54:19] new man so you can go and read you will
[54:22] find all of those things that Paul he's
[54:24] addressing and is's taking those
[54:26] churches and and is bringing those
[54:28] things and trying to position them but
[54:31] the goal was now I want you now to
[54:33] realize it was not necessarily and we
[54:36] read it somewhere it's not necessarily
[54:38] that it was uh rebuking them so they can
[54:41] stay in that state Paul desire was so
[54:45] that if you were in the Corinthian
[54:46] Church that you receive the word of God
[54:49] and move through the Ephesian
[54:52] church so when the word of God is
[54:54] preached and you find yourself lacking
[54:56] it's not so God can continually call you
[54:59] Corinthian Corin Corin no it's so that
[55:02] somewhere somehow in the middle you will
[55:05] receive the word of God and move from
[55:07] the Corinthian into the Ephesian church
[55:09] because with the Ephesian church it was
[55:11] the positioning of the believer there
[55:14] were those that knew where they came
[55:16] from there were those that God will take
[55:18] and bring into adoption now we
[55:21] understand the prophet will say that the
[55:22] Ephesian church is the type of Joshua we
[55:25] have been given in inheritance and by
[55:28] Christ dying and we know that we have
[55:29] been made partakers of divine nature and
[55:32] Joshua is the type of the of the Holy
[55:35] Spirit we believe we are living in a
[55:36] time where the holy spirit is here to
[55:39] positionally place a Believer and if you
[55:42] find yourself with Corinthian
[55:44] characteristics do not be discouraged
[55:47] that same word that's preached to you
[55:49] you are not positioning yourself but
[55:51] it's the word that's positioning you God
[55:55] by his word to say this that this is so
[55:58] comforting for a Believer I I that's why
[56:00] I say this morning as a Believer there's
[56:03] nothing that we need to be ashamed of or
[56:06] there's nothing that we need to look and
[56:08] look down upon ourselves why because
[56:10] it's the very word that you are hearing
[56:13] that's the word that will produce what
[56:15] God is requiring because when God send
[56:17] his word the Holy Spirit has to come and
[56:20] testify of what you are hearing so it
[56:23] can take you from where you are into
[56:25] what God is calling
[56:27] for the the the the trouble we have as
[56:31] humans is we try to apply the word to
[56:34] our flesh and then we run into conflict
[56:37] we don't see it happen and we keep
[56:38] beating our heads no what we need is to
[56:41] apply the word to the soul and let the
[56:43] soul be strengthened so the soul will
[56:46] have the power to overcome the Flesh and
[56:49] take it for the Corinthian into the
[56:53] Ephesian so we find ourselves yeah and I
[56:57] say and and then I said and so we move
[57:01] he's wanting to move us and I want to
[57:03] say this God oh I thought God is so
[57:06] wonderful because even as he's giving
[57:09] his word what God is looking for is to
[57:12] take a Believer and move him from where
[57:15] you are into the place that he has for
[57:19] you I talk about it there a scripture
[57:21] says God is a husbandman he will come
[57:24] and you know people will look a tree and
[57:27] and look at it and said this tree is as
[57:29] good as that you got to cut it down and
[57:32] and they they will look at the tree and
[57:34] see all that's wrong with the tree
[57:37] they'll see everything it hasn't been
[57:39] producing fruits the leaves are dried
[57:41] and all of this they said and then all
[57:43] they looking for is for the tree to be
[57:45] cut down but it takes a husband man to
[57:48] come and say I know you want to cut it
[57:50] down but give me time let me work with
[57:53] this tree and show you the potential
[57:56] that's within the tree let me say you
[57:58] man is not given to see the potential
[58:01] within one another man is not given to
[58:03] see the potential of God but it takes
[58:06] the word of God to see the potential
[58:08] that's within
[58:10] you and and I tell you this the worse it
[58:12] is the more the husband man knows he can
[58:15] it can bring it to come to
[58:18] pass I I tell you God loves the worst
[58:22] like the the the outcast the no good
[58:26] good they rejected oh I tell you I I
[58:29] remember but when I'm speaking about the
[58:31] meeting in Mexico and everything he said
[58:33] they come the general said oh you know
[58:36] they came and they called the people
[58:38] when when the the first crowd came in it
[58:40] was a bunch of welld dressed up people
[58:42] educated and everything but when his
[58:44] turn came it was a bunch of wheelchairs
[58:47] and all of those cast out some coming
[58:49] from hospitals and everywhere that's the
[58:52] people of God why because they are a
[58:54] people with a need within their hearts
[58:57] and they are theread with a real need
[58:59] and know that God is going to answer to
[59:01] the
[59:03] need I said I wasn't going to
[59:06] preach so the brother speaks about these
[59:10] two churches and they said I don't
[59:11] remember what message it is you could
[59:13] find it there it says now it says notice
[59:16] now if you'll notice in the book of
[59:18] Corinthian and he says of what Paul had
[59:22] with this Corinthian it says they were
[59:24] all seeking out after different
[59:27] blessings all spiritual gifts and Paul
[59:31] had to speak to them as to
[59:37] children so the word of God can come and
[59:39] speak to you as a child wonderful he
[59:42] trying to help you it's not casting you
[59:45] out it's trying what the manner of
[59:48] speech is is what comes to you so you
[59:51] could receive it in the place that you
[59:53] are
[59:56] and he says but when he came to the
[59:59] Ephesian church he spake to them in a
[1:00:01] different way the Church of Ephesus they
[1:00:05] are a solid Gospel Church it says now
[1:00:08] he's speaking here of what God did
[1:00:11] before the foundation of the world who's
[1:00:14] that the Ephesian
[1:00:16] church now we just can't come and every
[1:00:19] day preach about the foundation of the
[1:00:21] world we got to find out and help the
[1:00:24] Corinthians and let me put and myself
[1:00:27] there's some Corinthian in each and
[1:00:29] every one of us that needs to be
[1:00:31] addressed and it's not that it's there
[1:00:33] to be addressed so you can say oh who is
[1:00:36] me no it's addressed so that part can
[1:00:39] receive the word and move over progress
[1:00:43] go a little bit further move up go up
[1:00:47] into what God is looking for in the
[1:00:49] church order uh pre uh preach uh
[1:00:52] preached in 63 December 26 it says now
[1:00:56] some time ago it says when the order was
[1:01:00] set the church I do it says I do believe
[1:01:03] in speaking in T and interpretation and
[1:01:05] all fine spiritual gift that were
[1:01:07] ordained of God in the church but we are
[1:01:09] living in the day like it was in the
[1:01:12] Bible where Church it says where the
[1:01:15] church
[1:01:16] is now you'll notice that he founded the
[1:01:20] Church of Ephesus and the ephes the
[1:01:23] Ephesian Church which was a
[1:01:26] wellestablished church did you notice it
[1:01:28] says we we believe that Paul uh did say
[1:01:33] so himself that he spake in many
[1:01:36] tongues Paul himself and we know that he
[1:01:40] had the gift of tongue not one that I
[1:01:42] had learned but those who were Spirit
[1:01:45] those who were spiritually given to him
[1:01:48] because of how because of how he's uh
[1:01:51] he's speaking in the Corinthians here to
[1:01:54] save time it says let me jump uh
[1:01:57] paragraph 18 it says now Paul never one
[1:02:00] time had to speak to the Ephesian church
[1:02:03] or the Roman church or any of those
[1:02:07] other churches about their spiritual
[1:02:09] gift about how they put them in order
[1:02:11] but he did but but he did have to speak
[1:02:15] to the Corinthian
[1:02:17] continually about it because they made
[1:02:20] it they they made it an issue all the
[1:02:24] time and Paul said when he come among
[1:02:26] them if they found out if one had a
[1:02:30] tongue and other had a PSAL and he thank
[1:02:33] the Lord uh for uh for all the fine
[1:02:36] gifts and things like that and if you'll
[1:02:39] notice in the first chapter or two Paul
[1:02:42] was telling them positionally
[1:02:45] positionally when they were in the uh
[1:02:48] what they were in Christ it says they
[1:02:50] were positionally in Christ then after
[1:02:53] he told them I like this then like a
[1:02:56] father he began to whip them down to
[1:03:00] whip them down and say I hear there's uh
[1:03:05] cont uh contentions among you and I hear
[1:03:09] that you get drunk on the Lord's Supper
[1:03:11] on the Lord's table he he didn't unch
[1:03:15] christianize them and don't you brother
[1:03:19] do that and christianize them but it's
[1:03:22] the way that they are they are behaving
[1:03:25] themselves in the house of God listen to
[1:03:27] this that's where they at it's
[1:03:33] at so just because you come and and and
[1:03:37] you see someone falling short it it it
[1:03:41] doesn't mean that I'm no longer a
[1:03:42] Christian what what what is important
[1:03:45] because I want to say this the
[1:03:46] importance of the love in the Christian
[1:03:49] Life can never beas overemphasized now I
[1:03:52] didn't give my title my my title is uh
[1:03:55] don't forget about
[1:03:58] love don't forget about love the love
[1:04:02] ingredient is the is one of the most
[1:04:05] important ingredient in Christian life
[1:04:08] don't forget about it so the importance
[1:04:10] of the love of God in the Christian Life
[1:04:12] can never be o
[1:04:14] overemphasized i I want to say this it
[1:04:16] starts with love it ends with love if
[1:04:19] you take love out of it it will never
[1:04:21] achieve the goal it starts if you can
[1:04:25] ever help anybody it has to be by love
[1:04:29] if you can ever do something for God it
[1:04:31] has to be by love I love my brother
[1:04:33] Matthew was getting there even this
[1:04:35] morning you heard him just go I told him
[1:04:37] I'll just pick up where you left off so
[1:04:39] it's it's it but whatam says one place
[1:04:41] he says the trouble with people with
[1:04:44] trouble with preachers is we have taken
[1:04:46] the word of God and made it a bunch of
[1:04:49] rules and regulations where we we come
[1:04:51] to church and all say you got to dress
[1:04:53] like this you got to talk like this you
[1:04:55] got do like this and if you fit the
[1:04:57] criteria that means you are a Christian
[1:04:59] no you are
[1:05:03] not it was never about that it was never
[1:05:06] about obeying rules let me say this you
[1:05:09] can obey all the rules you want if it's
[1:05:11] not by love he will not produce
[1:05:14] it the the Christian walk this Bible is
[1:05:19] a book of love story it's when you read
[1:05:22] it it's about a loving God who the
[1:05:24] loving saor who came and he gave his
[1:05:27] life for you let me say this what
[1:05:29] changes you is the understanding that
[1:05:32] there was one who died for you before
[1:05:34] you even know
[1:05:36] it love conquers all he says love never
[1:05:42] fail if you do it by anything else
[1:05:45] that's why he was talking to the
[1:05:47] Corinthians the problem was not to give
[1:05:49] the problem is if one came and he did
[1:05:52] something oh people regarded him as the
[1:05:55] greatest oh that one spoke in tongue God
[1:05:57] must be with him and this one did this
[1:06:00] oh that now they they will follow that
[1:06:03] one today follow this one today they
[1:06:05] didn't know what to do what they failed
[1:06:07] to realize it it had nothing to do with
[1:06:09] all the time it was the word that was
[1:06:11] given to
[1:06:15] them so the the the the we have to it
[1:06:19] will not profit much if it's not by love
[1:06:22] the body of Christ or the church but
[1:06:25] says is the sickest body I
[1:06:28] know and and but I want to say this it's
[1:06:31] the sickest body I know but God is given
[1:06:34] the remedy to to to heal the sickness
[1:06:37] he's not left us alone just sick he's
[1:06:39] given us the word and love so we can
[1:06:42] heal our
[1:06:44] sicknesses butam says in the message uh
[1:06:48] the perfect faith and and and
[1:06:53] and perfect faith he talks about it and
[1:06:57] and let me just say this this is the
[1:06:59] foundation of why you would call
[1:07:01] yourself a Christian perfect faith and
[1:07:03] it says in paragraph 132 it says where
[1:07:07] when you were a sinner alienated without
[1:07:09] God in the world in the mark and and it
[1:07:13] says in the mark and I talked about it
[1:07:15] this morning God came to us when you
[1:07:19] were sick in the mark let me say this
[1:07:22] sickness is a
[1:07:24] disease let me say this everything that
[1:07:27] you were it was a disease he says that
[1:07:29] when you were in sin you were a sinner
[1:07:32] aliened without god without God in the
[1:07:35] world in the m and in the mud it says I
[1:07:38] talked about it this morning God came to
[1:07:41] us God sought you you didn't come to God
[1:07:45] and say oh God I'm sick help me no God
[1:07:48] came to you that let me say this if God
[1:07:51] didn't come to you you would not love
[1:07:54] him the way you love you're supposed to
[1:07:56] love him let me say this I I wanted one
[1:07:58] of the titles I was going to give this
[1:08:00] morning uh tonight was the Forgotten
[1:08:04] testimony we we forget what our
[1:08:06] testimony is our testimony is it's the
[1:08:10] love of God that did all of this for us
[1:08:13] it was never because we merited it it's
[1:08:16] his love that did us let me say this at
[1:08:19] the end the celebration is going to be
[1:08:21] about
[1:08:23] love not about our efforts
[1:08:29] and the requirement is the same love
[1:08:33] that's been given to you you extend
[1:08:38] it we we don't God they
[1:08:41] heal the seek a heal it's not so God can
[1:08:45] vindicate you you understand and let me
[1:08:48] say this if it's done by anything
[1:08:51] outside of love it's not going to
[1:08:54] work it's only going to be a man
[1:08:56] boasting himself that's why you hear oh
[1:08:58] I heal the sick over there I raise the
[1:09:00] dead over here he only piling Glory but
[1:09:03] the prophet who brought the very message
[1:09:05] it will constantly tell you men cannot
[1:09:08] heal healing is not a man's ability
[1:09:11] healing is only God himself that can
[1:09:15] heal all glory goes back to him and I
[1:09:18] love even as our pastor was preaching
[1:09:20] all of that I found it in this message
[1:09:22] you're talking about he was said in
[1:09:24] Mexico he said this man came and he was
[1:09:26] there it talks about Pano and all the
[1:09:29] difficulties of life that they would go
[1:09:30] through and everything it says I looked
[1:09:32] at him he didn't even have the right
[1:09:34] kind of clothes I said can I give him my
[1:09:36] suit can I love is being projected and
[1:09:39] love when love was projected healing has
[1:09:42] to show
[1:09:46] up it's not by
[1:09:48] frustration it's not by I'm going to
[1:09:51] prove the devil I'm a Son of God it's
[1:09:53] not going to work
[1:09:55] you know sometimes we we we feel like oh
[1:09:58] we are the the manifested son we're
[1:10:00] going to go and raise people out from
[1:10:02] the grave and and
[1:10:05] no if there's no love projected all of
[1:10:09] that is is men trying to project and
[1:10:11] show what they can do so he says God
[1:10:14] came to us it says God sought you you
[1:10:17] never sought God man it says no man can
[1:10:21] come to me except the father draw him
[1:10:24] first God God came down in the mark that
[1:10:27] you were and he sought you and he bought
[1:10:30] you it says that ought to create a
[1:10:33] perfect love oh my brother my sister the
[1:10:37] love that we have as a that's why let me
[1:10:40] say this the love that I'm talking about
[1:10:42] you can never receive it until you are
[1:10:45] born
[1:10:46] again it it's not an intellectual love
[1:10:49] that that's why when when Paul is
[1:10:51] talking about this let me say this Elon
[1:10:53] Musk can feed the the the more better
[1:10:56] than I
[1:10:58] can what's the Microsoft
[1:11:01] guy Bill Gates he can feed the poor he
[1:11:05] does it that they do a bunch of donation
[1:11:07] and that's what Paul is talking you can
[1:11:09] take your body and be Let It Be burned
[1:11:13] that that's what it says but this love
[1:11:16] that I'm talking about can only come by
[1:11:19] the new
[1:11:22] birth love to the the love to be patient
[1:11:26] with one another the love when somebody
[1:11:28] gets on your nerves you just love
[1:11:34] them the love when you see something
[1:11:37] wrong you see something continually
[1:11:39] wrong you pray so God can
[1:11:46] move you know it's easier to love
[1:11:48] somebody when you are not with them
[1:11:50] every
[1:11:53] day right
[1:11:58] but when they contact they become more
[1:12:00] contact and and and and the things is
[1:12:02] just continually you look at them you're
[1:12:05] just about to lose your mind that's when
[1:12:07] you have to love
[1:12:10] them now that's the true Christian love
[1:12:12] it it's not it's not a love that oh if
[1:12:15] it's not done my way I don't want it no
[1:12:18] it's the love butam speaks one place it
[1:12:20] talks about the Tabernacle it said you
[1:12:22] know the brothers came together he
[1:12:25] didn't want something and they came
[1:12:27] together and they decided that they
[1:12:28] wanted to do it you know what he did he
[1:12:29] said if you guys voted and everybody
[1:12:31] wanted to do it I'm
[1:12:33] joining that's the love I'm talking
[1:12:35] about it's not oh it has to be everybody
[1:12:39] has an opinion I is supposed to work if
[1:12:41] it's not done my way I don't want to be
[1:12:43] part of it no it's the love that knows
[1:12:46] we have the same goal the same objective
[1:12:49] we going to the same place therefore no
[1:12:51] matter what decision is made I'm behind
[1:12:54] it
[1:13:03] we'll continue another
[1:13:05] time that's why the prophet could say if
[1:13:09] he sends me to
[1:13:11] hell now you do that's not mental love
[1:13:15] that's not human love that's not filo
[1:13:18] that's agap love that's when that's when
[1:13:21] you're talking when you get to that
[1:13:23] place then we can talk why because it's
[1:13:25] the love to know that I love him
[1:13:28] regardless I know whatever he will give
[1:13:30] me he'll give me the best whatever if he
[1:13:33] wants me in hell that's the place I want
[1:13:35] to
[1:13:36] be we we're not Christians because we
[1:13:39] are scared to go to hell that decision
[1:13:41] is already made am we are Christians
[1:13:44] because there's something beating within
[1:13:46] our hearts we want to serve God we want
[1:13:49] to see other saved we want to see other
[1:13:51] touched
[1:13:56] and only when we have that same
[1:13:59] heartbeat that's when it will produce
[1:14:01] the same
[1:14:02] result if we do it because I'm a
[1:14:06] preacher I want everybody to know I'm a
[1:14:08] preacher or I'm a deacon or I'm this
[1:14:12] and it's only going to produce a
[1:14:15] preacher result a deacon result whatever
[1:14:17] other result it is and it's only going
[1:14:20] to be
[1:14:22] temporary the scripture says God so
[1:14:24] loved the world
[1:14:26] andam says he's the very essence of Love
[1:14:30] he's the Fountain of many color so when
[1:14:33] he created you he didn't create you so
[1:14:36] he can see if he can create it was the
[1:14:38] love of God butam says one place he says
[1:14:41] when the love of God was projected It
[1:14:44] produced Jesus Christ right so if you
[1:14:47] Pro if you project the same love it will
[1:14:51] produce Jesus Christ and I love what our
[1:14:53] brother said this morning it's the same
[1:14:55] son of man it's not a different one
[1:14:59] that's why he could say that if the same
[1:15:01] word is received the same way is applied
[1:15:04] the same way it will produce the same
[1:15:06] son of man
[1:15:17] again we'll continue another if the
[1:15:20] musician could come I'm
[1:15:23] sorry I
[1:15:30] we'll continue another time I know I
[1:15:32] know what I'm I I I could just go on and
[1:15:34] go on but and it
[1:15:38] says it
[1:15:41] says Thou ought to create perfect
[1:15:46] love if you can put it back up
[1:15:50] there look what you
[1:15:52] was look what you are
[1:15:55] what did it somebody that loved
[1:15:59] you somebody that loved you not somebody
[1:16:04] that hated you not somebody that looked
[1:16:06] with you with Strife not somebody that
[1:16:08] looked at you said how long until you
[1:16:10] get it no it's somebody that loved you
[1:16:14] and let me say this one of the
[1:16:15] characteristics will'll get to it
[1:16:17] another time of Love is patience the
[1:16:20] ability to just pray continually until
[1:16:24] it happens love never gives
[1:16:26] up listen it says when it says Love
[1:16:29] Never Fails Love Never
[1:16:36] Fails if you ever feel yourself tired of
[1:16:39] either praying for somebody or for
[1:16:41] something watch what love did you go
[1:16:45] by it could be your emotions you got all
[1:16:49] emotional and you feel like oh I want to
[1:16:50] get this done but Let It Drop and I'm
[1:16:53] not saying there's anything wrong with
[1:16:54] that
[1:16:55] Let It Drop from filo into your G love
[1:16:58] you will see the result before it even
[1:17:00] happened because you know that when I
[1:17:03] ask you know that I will stay here
[1:17:05] you'll say like that man says you will
[1:17:08] find my bones here when you come back
[1:17:10] because it's in my heart so you can do
[1:17:12] it it's love that does
[1:17:15] it but when I'm praying for people they
[1:17:18] didn't even know you pray and and you
[1:17:20] will pray and you will go it's the love
[1:17:23] of God that went and heal those people
[1:17:25] people he didn't come and say I'm going
[1:17:27] to prove to you that I'm a prophet no it
[1:17:30] was by the love of God shed in his
[1:17:33] heart it says you can't have faith in in
[1:17:37] what he promised you you it says it says
[1:17:40] can't you have faith in what he promised
[1:17:42] you then it says real genuine love will
[1:17:45] create a confidence in his word that's
[1:17:49] what I'm looking for I want confidence
[1:17:51] in his word he says he caught me when
[1:17:54] when I was nothing I'm still nothing it
[1:17:57] says it says but but I'm in his hand see
[1:18:01] he caught me he loved me when I was
[1:18:05] unlovable let me say this love goes
[1:18:08] around he's looking for the worst you
[1:18:10] see somebody with purple hair with
[1:18:12] tattoos and they look like they're good
[1:18:14] for nothing I want you to think about
[1:18:17] the love of God the love of God is
[1:18:19] looking let me let me just talk about
[1:18:21] myself I didn't like
[1:18:23] preachers I wasn't a church person I I
[1:18:27] came to church and and all of this
[1:18:29] excitement I wasn't part of
[1:18:33] it I came and church was over and put my
[1:18:36] Bible and went home and do my did my
[1:18:39] business God came in he says you the
[1:18:43] hate preachers I'm going to come and
[1:18:45] make you one of
[1:18:48] them I said no it's not
[1:18:51] happening but look at me where I am
[1:18:53] today what did it it's the love of God I
[1:18:57] I I I didn't grow up say I'm going to be
[1:19:00] a preacher one day no it wasn't in my
[1:19:06] perview in fact I quit every time after
[1:19:14] preaching what did it the love of
[1:19:18] God it's the love of God he came and you
[1:19:22] look at it you're like my my my look at
[1:19:25] what the love of God could do and I want
[1:19:27] to say this it's just not me everyone
[1:19:29] sitting here this tonight it's the
[1:19:32] manifestation of the love of God you
[1:19:34] were what you were by his grace by his
[1:19:37] love let's all stand I'm sorry I'll just
[1:19:39] keep going and going
[1:19:44] amen we'll pick it up another time we we
[1:19:47] had a wonderful service this morning and
[1:19:49] I just don't want
[1:19:52] to I told the brothers I didn't want
[1:19:54] another heavy
[1:19:56] meal we had a heavy meal this morning
[1:19:58] and I'll just give dessert on top amen
[1:20:01] do you love God tonight is that your
[1:20:03] heart desire that It Be by love when
[1:20:06] when you see you don't let even in your
[1:20:08] own home I was talking about Matthew he
[1:20:10] just mentioned something that just touch
[1:20:12] my heart it's so true it's like having a
[1:20:14] child you know that that kid can shoot
[1:20:17] somebody and you're not going to cast
[1:20:18] them out it's your child whatever they
[1:20:21] do you're still going to love them
[1:20:25] what the there's no nothing Under the
[1:20:28] Sun they're going to do where you say
[1:20:30] you've crossed the line you're no longer
[1:20:31] my
[1:20:34] child whatever they can come and say Oh
[1:20:37] Daddy this happened guess what we're
[1:20:40] ready to go to battle whatever it is
[1:20:43] let's go figure out how we're going to
[1:20:44] fix
[1:20:45] it and brother and the scripture says
[1:20:47] that if you you that are Earthly your
[1:20:50] son will ask you for a bread you will
[1:20:52] not give him a stone or there will ask
[1:20:54] for a fish you will not give him a snake
[1:20:56] how much more your heavenly father it's
[1:20:59] a love affair if you can only sprinkle
[1:21:02] the ingredients of love in it you will
[1:21:05] it will help you understand what God is
[1:21:07] looking out of us a lot better the
[1:21:10] reason we don't understand is because we
[1:21:12] make it intellectual we make it let me
[1:21:14] say this love you can talk all about
[1:21:17] love that you want until you feel it
[1:21:20] until you experience it then you will
[1:21:23] know what love is
[1:21:29] and God wants us to experience what
[1:21:31] divine love is what his love towards us
[1:21:34] is our gracious father we're so thankful
[1:21:36] for your grace and your mercy father God
[1:21:40] it's just such
[1:21:42] a a desire
[1:21:45] Lord in our hearts to serve you and to
[1:21:48] serve you right and we ask father that
[1:21:51] you just help us in our modal being and
[1:21:55] father sometimes I feel like one day we
[1:21:58] are in the Corinthian Church ages and
[1:22:01] the next day we are the phion and then
[1:22:03] we drop back in the Corinthians and then
[1:22:05] we go back to the Ephesians Lord help
[1:22:07] our
[1:22:08] unbelief help our in consistency and
[1:22:12] help all the doubting and all the
[1:22:14] shcking and father Place us on the Solid
[1:22:17] Ground of Revelation that will never
[1:22:19] change and that will be never moved help
[1:22:22] us be solid Believers that will come and
