[44:03] we are so happy to be gathered in the
[44:05] house of God to hear the word of God
[44:10] without further Ado let's open our
[44:13] Bibles in Ephesians chapter 3.
[44:17] verse 14 to 19.
[44:27] I would like us to pay attention to the
[44:30] word of God
[44:33] [Music]
[44:35] because oftentimes people read the word
[44:37] of God as if they were reading a journal
[44:43] where the Holy Ghost has inspired these
[44:47] words for you
[44:49] it's for your victory that these things
[44:52] are written
[44:59] because sometimes we look to the left
[45:02] and right without knowing that we have
[45:04] the solution with us
[45:08] verse 14
[45:12] for this about my knees and to the
[45:16] father
[45:21] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[45:23] in Earth is named ah thank you
[45:29] foreign
[45:33] that he may Grant you according to the
[45:36] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[45:39] within to be strengthened with might by
[45:42] his spirit in the Inner Man
[45:47] the inner man has to be strengthened he
[45:50] said
[45:53] that Christ May dwell in Your Heart
[46:00] by faith
[46:03] being rooted and grounded in love
[46:07] that you may comprehend
[46:10] with all the saints
[46:16] what is the breath the length the depth
[46:19] and the height
[46:23] and to know the love of Christ
[46:27] which surpasses all on all knowledge
[46:34] that he may be filled with all the
[46:38] fullness of god let's pray our Grace is
[46:42] Father
[46:44] we say thank you for tonight
[46:47] for these few words that we read
[46:50] we ask that you bless your people
[46:53] that you may sanctify this word for them
[46:57] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[47:31] may God bless him
[47:35] and I thank him for the opportunity that
[47:38] he's given me
[47:52] the Bible says for this course about my
[47:55] knees and to the father
[48:00] For Whom the family
[48:05] the family of God is in heaven and here
[48:10] on Earth there is a family of God
[48:15] that he may Grant you according to the
[48:18] riches of his glory
[48:20] god is rich in mercies
[48:27] if he gives you something like what we
[48:30] read tonight it will be wonderful for
[48:32] you
[48:37] Paul is saying here that you may be
[48:40] strengthened uh strengthened with might
[48:42] that you may underline that to be
[48:45] strengthened that you may be
[48:48] strengthened
[48:50] that you may be strengthened by his
[48:53] Spirit
[48:55] and the spirit is written in capital
[49:01] there is a difference between when you
[49:04] write it in small letter and when you
[49:05] write it in capital
[49:08] because the man is in three dimensions
[49:15] a man has both Spirit soul and body as
[49:19] you can know it
[49:21] [Music]
[49:24] you can say is Body Spirit and soul
[49:28] whichever order you place it is all man
[49:36] so when we speak of the spirit of man
[49:39] that spirit that is a small as a small S
[49:43] I know
[49:50] and those that small spirit that we're
[49:53] talking about is what brought gave birth
[49:56] to Theology and all of the education and
[49:59] the things of man
[50:04] the small Spirit gave birth to science
[50:08] and all the things that you see
[50:10] when you read in Galatians 5 16
[50:17] probably speaking is saying walk in the
[50:20] spirit
[50:22] and that spirit is the capital S Spirit
[50:26] the the capital S is God
[50:32] every man that that works without God is
[50:36] like an animal in that blue
[50:41] he loses the senses he loses shame he
[50:45] loses everything
[50:48] and he does whatever he will
[50:50] [Music]
[50:53] also and today we live in the world
[50:55] where people do whatever they want
[50:58] normal and people think that it's normal
[51:02] that is not normal
[51:05] it's only in this time
[51:10] that God Paul is here saying that God
[51:13] May strengthen you with might
[51:16] less pretty diva by the the the Divine
[51:20] spirit
[51:22] in your inner man
[51:26] Chester I am a doctor
[51:29] I understand what I'm saying
[51:33] this man is not this body or this flesh
[51:36] that you see here the man is inside God
[51:40] said
[51:42] when this man who's inside become
[51:45] weakened this one fails
[51:50] that you may be strong Baba
[51:53] not by by by by
[51:55] medicines
[51:57] but by the word of God
[52:00] if you want to be strengthened 40
[52:05] God has to strengthen you in a man
[52:12] so how come some have patience and
[52:15] others are without patience
[52:19] because it's a virtue that God gives to
[52:22] someone
[52:23] when you ask of it
[52:26] he has to strengthen you
[52:32] I'm speaking of the inner man who has to
[52:35] be strong
[52:38] because now we'll present you science
[52:42] and God will present you faith
[52:48] the science will present to you a
[52:51] certain demonstration
[52:54] God is Not Looking for demonstration
[52:57] you believe
[52:59] things are changing
[53:04] mom the the science itself is lying
[53:09] because science says
[53:12] I will believe when I see
[53:16] I will show you something that science
[53:19] cannot prove
[53:22] the
[53:24] matter has three stages
[53:30] it's a kindergarten oh the prime
[53:33] Elementary sorry
[53:35] there is liquid there is a solid and
[53:40] then there is gas
[53:42] oxygen the oxygen
[53:45] is is the gas
[53:49] but material or matter is anything with
[53:53] touch okay if I catch season 4 if I see
[53:57] jebron I believe the name on oxygen give
[54:00] me the oxygen
[54:03] the name one looks give me the oxygen
[54:08] why is science calling oxygen matter
[54:18] stages of matter and it's a lie
[54:22] doctor I'm a doctor
[54:25] I'm a judge I'm I am I am
[54:30] by the speaking lies
[54:36] and he said oh show me that God exists
[54:42] it's like the oxygen
[54:45] you cannot see it you cannot touch it
[54:49] but you can feel it
[54:52] that's God
[54:56] so don't walk according to your theology
[55:02] don't walk according to opinions
[55:09] the the inner man has to be strengthened
[55:13] by the spirit God
[55:16] when he strengthened holy
[55:19] saying in verse 17.
[55:23] that Christ may may dwell in Your Heart
[55:26] by faith
[55:33] person that's not that doesn't have
[55:36] faith he's he's uh he's dwelling is a
[55:40] dwelling place for demons
[55:43] because
[55:47] the the
[55:48] for all the demons
[55:52] is called unbelief
[55:58] when Eve doubted the word of God
[56:02] there's three things that happen La
[56:05] premiere
[56:26] deity went out Sonoma
[56:30] her soul become became darkened
[56:34] and and the devil came to abide in her
[56:37] three
[56:39] do they
[56:41] do tell you doubt the word of God
[56:44] will bring to the the unbeliever those
[56:48] things
[56:56] what Paul wants the uh that that God May
[56:59] dwell in the Believers by faith
[57:03] in verse 18 it says
[57:06] that you may be able to comprehend with
[57:10] all the saints
[57:12] what is the breath
[57:17] what is the length
[57:21] and the death
[57:24] and the height
[57:27] is
[57:29] we are speaking of the height of the
[57:33] death
[57:34] of the length and the breath of the love
[57:37] of God
[57:38] my little subject tonight
[57:43] is the full measure of the love of God
[57:46] for you
[57:49] to know the love
[57:52] the Christian of Christ
[57:57] to know
[58:02] to know is not to be ignorant
[58:06] is
[58:08] there is doctors and that don't know
[58:11] math
[58:12] is
[58:15] they are drivers that don't know the the
[58:18] road signs
[58:21] but he's a driver
[58:27] and we have Christians that don't know
[58:30] the word
[58:33] you have to know the love
[58:38] what is love
[58:42] in the Statue of the perfect man
[58:46] love is not to give a suit to someone
[58:51] love is not just to give food to someone
[58:56] is to forgive
[58:59] the one who done wrong against you
[59:04] says in the Statue of the perfect man
[59:09] it says uh again
[59:12] that it's the piety
[59:16] it's I said to be like God brother
[59:21] to have the brotherly love
[59:26] you have to be like God first
[59:31] if you are not like God you will
[59:34] manufacture love never
[59:37] don't don't
[59:39] manufacture anything
[59:42] let God himself do the work in you
[59:48] to know love
[59:53] love is to forgive your enemy and let's
[59:56] yell and the heavens
[59:59] is for people that are like Jesus Christ
[1:00:04] I will show you two worshipers
[1:00:07] I'll show you Cain and Abel
[1:00:11] both of them were worshiping
[1:00:14] one brought the fruits and the other
[1:00:17] brought the blood
[1:00:20] and God in looking at the worship he
[1:00:23] rejected came
[1:00:26] why did he reject came
[1:00:30] so he brought the fruits and in the
[1:00:32] fruits there was no blood
[1:00:35] and Cain who was worshiping God he was
[1:00:39] mad
[1:00:43] what kind of worshiper is that who's mad
[1:01:01] and he preached to the unbeliever
[1:01:05] God he didn't preach to the believer
[1:01:08] it was a Believer is Born Into The
[1:01:12] Kingdom
[1:01:14] a Believer knows the will of the father
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:21] he says
[1:01:24] why is your face
[1:01:26] he says do like your brother
[1:01:29] if you if you act like your brother if
[1:01:33] you do like your brother if you do like
[1:01:36] your brother
[1:01:37] if you love your enemy if you love your
[1:01:41] enemy
[1:01:44] I will love the one who loves me in the
[1:01:46] flesh
[1:01:53] we are of the same country we are of
[1:01:55] this
[1:01:56] God said no you have to love your enemy
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:24] and when he killed
[1:02:28] mm-hmm
[1:02:29] what did he do he killed
[1:02:35] what is killing today
[1:02:39] it says that the the killing is not
[1:02:42] taking a knife and kill him is to kill
[1:02:45] the influence of your brother
[1:02:49] what is the characteristics of the
[1:02:51] children of the devil
[1:02:55] they are they rebel against the words
[1:03:00] they don't let the word of God get into
[1:03:03] them so criminal they are criminals
[1:03:07] they are disobedient
[1:03:11] they come with a repentance with tears
[1:03:16] the crocodile tears
[1:03:22] are you are you really crying no no no
[1:03:24] no no no no no no
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:28] it looks like he's not really repented
[1:03:33] God knows his children
[1:03:35] that's why when Jesus came
[1:03:38] he saw a man
[1:03:40] that were walking
[1:03:44] that he said you are you are of your
[1:03:47] your father the serpenter Joseph
[1:03:53] meeting his brothers
[1:03:59] it was the expression of the devil
[1:04:03] man
[1:04:06] Satan reproduced himself
[1:04:10] where God is the devil is also there
[1:04:15] they come to worship all together
[1:04:19] one wants to worship according to his
[1:04:22] own way
[1:04:24] and God wants you to worship according
[1:04:26] to his way
[1:04:28] there is no heaven without suffering
[1:04:33] you have to suffer before you get in
[1:04:35] heaven
[1:04:37] all the trouble comes when you become a
[1:04:40] Christian
[1:04:42] don't think when you become a Christian
[1:04:45] Things become easy
[1:04:49] tonight if you had a problem against
[1:04:52] someone and not against someone go back
[1:04:54] and repentance
[1:04:57] the nature of the children of God is
[1:05:00] forgiveness
[1:05:03] the devil can do everything but he
[1:05:05] cannot forgive
[1:05:07] the devil wants Vengeance
[1:05:11] look at Cain who killed
[1:05:16] when he lifts his hands to pray God
[1:05:20] God said you are forgiven I'm going to
[1:05:24] protect you
[1:05:35] who died in sin
[1:05:39] us
[1:05:40] because the the blood of bull and gold
[1:05:44] and gold see couldn't take away the sins
[1:05:50] it was they there was a need for higher
[1:05:54] blood a blood that was higher than the
[1:05:56] human blood
[1:05:57] foreign
[1:06:04] to Abel what the conduct of Abel was
[1:06:11] I'm sorry
[1:06:13] my friend he said it was his blood was
[1:06:16] crying out more my brother my friend my
[1:06:20] brother my friend Matthew my brother
[1:06:22] killed me
[1:06:23] he was crying out for justice
[1:06:27] a man always looks for justice
[1:06:31] and God says yes
[1:06:36] the blood of your brother is crying out
[1:06:38] from the Earth
[1:06:41] what was he asking for
[1:06:45] punishment
[1:06:48] is
[1:06:52] tonight I want to tell you that the
[1:06:54] blood speaks
[1:06:57] these people that think blood doesn't
[1:07:00] speak the blood speaks
[1:07:11] to the lab
[1:07:20] they
[1:07:24] look at they get to the lab they take
[1:07:28] the blood
[1:07:29] thank you and they say thank you they
[1:07:33] take they go they take from the girls
[1:07:35] goodbye
[1:07:39] and then they go
[1:07:43] you'll get the result in two days
[1:07:49] when they put it in the lab they start
[1:07:53] looking listen the blood
[1:07:55] it starts speaking to the machine oh
[1:08:06] they take the other one
[1:08:10] God
[1:08:16] and they put the results in the envelope
[1:08:22] they said you two cannot get married
[1:08:27] because the blood is spoken
[1:08:33] if he has the the uh a group s an S
[1:08:39] group and the other has the same group
[1:08:43] the problem they will have children
[1:08:45] that's going to have a lot of problems
[1:08:51] no I Have Faith
[1:08:53] Pastor you have to marry us
[1:08:56] remember the blood is already spoken
[1:09:02] they get in the marriage children begin
[1:09:05] to die
[1:09:09] that's why that
[1:09:15] president but tonight I want to speak of
[1:09:18] the real blood
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:21] let's read Hebrews chapter 12 verse 24.
[1:09:27] the blood and the Bible says Jesus
[1:09:30] Christ
[1:09:32] the mediator of the New Covenant
[1:09:35] I'm very sad and the blood of the blood
[1:09:40] and to the blood of sprinkling
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:44] that speaks better things than of the of
[1:09:48] of able Jessica
[1:09:51] Jesus when he was beaten up and killed
[1:09:56] his blood did me ask for vengeance
[1:10:00] when they beat him up
[1:10:03] his blood cried out and said father
[1:10:06] forgive them their sins
[1:10:10] because they don't know what they are
[1:10:12] doing
[1:10:13] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:17] he's speaking in favor of the sinner
[1:10:22] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] he's praying for his enemies
[1:10:28] when you have pity
[1:10:32] before you have the the brotherly loved
[1:10:36] the conscious you have to be like Jesus
[1:10:41] when you are like Jesus
[1:10:45] that's when they will say brother
[1:10:55] we are all we have all kinds of false
[1:10:59] Brothers
[1:11:00] Jesus Judas was also a brother Amazing
[1:11:04] Grace but Jesus Christ
[1:11:07] he was a real brother
[1:11:11] and he gave us the example
[1:11:16] that's why the Bible says Jesus is the
[1:11:19] way he's the truth and his life
[1:11:25] when we say Jesus is the way
[1:11:28] it's not uh it's not a road
[1:11:32] if Jesus is the model or the the thing
[1:11:36] the the model to follow
[1:11:39] fix you to get to Perfection
[1:11:44] probably speaking in Romans chapter 12
[1:11:47] verse 2.
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:50] and he says be not be not conformed to
[1:11:53] this uh a world
[1:11:59] by the renewing of your mind
[1:12:03] love foreign
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:32] foreign
[1:12:57] but in the presence of God there is a
[1:12:59] power of transformation
[1:13:01] now pay attention
[1:13:04] in the word conforms
[1:13:07] and the word transformed
[1:13:12] there is a word that's in both of them
[1:13:16] you look at to be conformed and
[1:13:20] to be transformed
[1:13:23] there is a form inside of both two of
[1:13:26] them
[1:13:27] you can look at it and see there is a
[1:13:31] form in both of them in physics look
[1:13:34] water
[1:13:36] formed recipient the water takes the
[1:13:40] shape of whatever container you put it
[1:13:42] in
[1:13:44] the the vase is square
[1:13:47] water will look Square
[1:13:51] if the the recipient is triangles
[1:13:56] if the recipient has the form of the
[1:13:59] church
[1:14:02] the water will take the form of the vase
[1:14:05] let us the the the the the uh the
[1:14:09] container and the water they work
[1:14:11] together
[1:14:12] but water is the word
[1:14:24] that you have to know the will of God
[1:14:27] what is good and what is perfect three
[1:14:32] things
[1:14:34] that you may pay attention to those
[1:14:36] three things I give an example
[1:14:39] you have an American
[1:14:42] I have maybe a European passport and you
[1:14:47] I can go everywhere that you can go
[1:14:49] but I have to pay attention
[1:14:54] and that they are countries under which
[1:14:57] those passport cannot go without a Visa
[1:15:01] I have to pay attention to that it's
[1:15:04] just the details
[1:15:12] the same
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:22] Holy Spirit
[1:15:25] who's there doing miracles
[1:15:29] is the same Holy Spirit here
[1:15:32] the difference
[1:15:34] is in the denomination
[1:15:38] they don't know what's perfect
[1:15:41] they don't they don't they don't know
[1:15:43] what these three things are then says
[1:15:48] in the Statue of the perfect man
[1:15:51] my message
[1:15:54] I didn't come to to build churches
[1:15:59] I didn't come to call people but I just
[1:16:03] to follow me but my mission
[1:16:06] is to bring every individual
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:15] where they get to the Statue of the
[1:16:17] perfect man
[1:16:20] that is what's perfect and acceptable
[1:16:23] today
[1:16:25] foreign
[1:16:57] mm-hmm maintenance now
[1:17:02] we're going to see something that is
[1:17:04] important
[1:17:06] we were you you were not created here on
[1:17:09] Earth
[1:17:11] the creation started in heaven
[1:17:16] We Came From Heaven
[1:17:19] no one was created here on Earth
[1:17:29] where were you
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:43] with all kinds of sicknesses and other
[1:17:46] stuff
[1:17:48] the job on Earth with all the boils and
[1:17:51] everything
[1:17:52] but when he's looking at the other side
[1:17:55] he's so job in in his jumping out he
[1:17:59] loves his job he saw a job but that job
[1:18:02] who was younger he says I know
[1:18:06] that my redeemer lives
[1:18:12] God didn't pay attention to the things
[1:18:14] of the earth
[1:18:16] don't pay attention to the things of the
[1:18:19] earth
[1:18:21] pay attention to things that comes from
[1:18:23] above
[1:18:27] because the testimony of God was he was
[1:18:29] a perfect man
[1:18:32] that was job one one
[1:18:36] and Satan said it's not perfect
[1:18:40] job represents the church
[1:18:43] he represents every believer
[1:18:47] at your job and your job accepted as a
[1:18:51] prayer if you believe the trials
[1:18:54] if you love the trials
[1:18:57] a Believer that's going to run away from
[1:19:00] trials
[1:19:01] let's take a a uh
[1:19:04] a quote to confirm what we're saying
[1:19:09] um in that day at Calvary
[1:19:12] uh
[1:19:15] paragraph
[1:19:21] 57 I believe
[1:19:25] yeah and French is in French it's
[1:19:28] paragraph 45 okay
[1:19:33] it's preaching September 25th 1906. it
[1:19:39] says
[1:19:48] Europe
[1:19:56] an
[1:19:59] foreign
[1:20:10] no wonder he says no wonder God in human
[1:20:13] flesh was dying yeah it was the hour
[1:20:17] that the world had looked for yet many
[1:20:20] of them did not know it like it is today
[1:20:24] many look for these things and yet they
[1:20:27] don't recognize them they don't realize
[1:20:30] the way out
[1:20:35] job had three friends
[1:20:38] God said it was perfect
[1:20:42] but when job found
[1:20:46] all the three friends said that he was a
[1:20:49] sinner in secret
[1:20:51] they condemned him
[1:20:54] without showing him a way out
[1:20:59] for job to come back to his position
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:19] we have need of Elijah the prophet
[1:21:35] took back what was foreign
[1:21:59] this when
[1:22:00] when ill who came
[1:22:03] you come you understand that that was
[1:22:06] the seventh day
[1:22:09] that's when we heard the Thunders
[1:22:13] then God said to Job
[1:22:16] it says uh God gird upload your lawyers
[1:22:23] I want to ask you a question
[1:22:26] and I want you to answer me
[1:22:28] I want you to underline
[1:22:32] that job was not a Pentecostal baby
[1:22:37] because babies don't wear a belt
[1:22:43] job
[1:22:44] was an adult
[1:22:48] the church is not the babies
[1:22:53] you can see a a grown up with beers
[1:23:01] but we're wearing diapers and you think
[1:23:04] it's an adult but it's a baby let's
[1:23:06] listen
[1:23:07] baby the the Corinthian Church was built
[1:23:11] was had babies in them
[1:23:15] speak I spoke in First Corinthians they
[1:23:19] didn't understand
[1:23:23] they didn't understand
[1:23:27] he went to the Ephesians
[1:23:30] listen they related
[1:23:34] to them you don't tell them what to do
[1:23:38] this when you are a king a child of the
[1:23:41] Kingdom
[1:23:44] you know the will of God
[1:23:47] you know what's good
[1:23:50] and you know what's perfect
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:55] where were you
[1:23:58] yeah
[1:23:59] there's a lot of people that says
[1:24:05] oh the will of God when I pray God hears
[1:24:09] me
[1:24:10] two seconds
[1:24:15] everything I ask God the house the the
[1:24:19] job everything and God gives it to me
[1:24:21] foreign
[1:24:37] God says amen
[1:24:42] God certain Satan came and said God
[1:24:46] I have a prayer give me job
[1:24:58] God said amen take him
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:06] because job was an adult
[1:25:23] he's speaking too much
[1:25:26] give it to me
[1:25:29] God said no
[1:25:34] because Peter had not received the Holy
[1:25:36] Spirit
[1:25:39] God cannot prove you above what you
[1:25:42] could do what you can handle
[1:25:45] God knows how to prove you
[1:25:49] and every child of God before the trials
[1:25:53] he will he will succeed
[1:26:01] you know
[1:26:05] and then another day the demons came and
[1:26:08] said God
[1:26:10] came and he was uh uh he was casting out
[1:26:15] the Devils off of uh uh uh uh uh a
[1:26:18] person who lost his mind
[1:26:22] is mine
[1:26:24] can you can you eat together with
[1:26:26] someone who lost the mind
[1:26:29] you cannot
[1:26:30] my friends
[1:26:33] someone came to him
[1:26:36] to hit to his place
[1:26:39] he asked him he says can I eat a
[1:26:42] sandwich
[1:26:47] he eats all of it
[1:26:56] and you say you are a Christian
[1:26:59] can you love someone
[1:27:01] who lost her mind
[1:27:06] we are talking about the four measures
[1:27:09] of the love of God
[1:27:12] the the fool that I'm talking about is
[1:27:18] for whom that Christ left Heaven
[1:27:24] he came so he can redeem you without
[1:27:27] giving without without you giving
[1:27:29] anything
[1:27:33] what did you give for you to inherit the
[1:27:36] kingdom of
[1:27:48] remember the The Throne we speaking of
[1:27:51] of Heaven
[1:27:53] to whom where Satan was cast down
[1:27:56] it's where you're gonna sit
[1:28:02] es
[1:28:05] if if the Earthly Throne that's around
[1:28:08] us you can't get it
[1:28:14] how can you be elevated and sit on the
[1:28:17] throne of God without suffering
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:21] you have to suffer
[1:28:24] you have to forgive
[1:28:27] France that's your suffering
[1:28:32] your suffering is when people are
[1:28:34] mocking you are making fun of you you
[1:28:36] praying for them
[1:28:42] your suffering is to forgive those that
[1:28:46] did wrong to you
[1:28:49] the people say they are brothers but
[1:28:52] they are Christians but they go out
[1:28:53] there they don't uh greet one another
[1:29:08] to become a a lawyer an economist or
[1:29:12] anything on Earth
[1:29:14] there are tests that you have to take
[1:29:18] God will also give you tests
[1:29:23] and you have to pass those tests
[1:29:26] shows
[1:29:28] if the Bible says if in the little
[1:29:31] things you are not just
[1:29:34] who's gonna confide you the bigger
[1:29:36] things
[1:29:43] from over there
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:47] it's not because I prayed God gave me
[1:29:50] because God gives to the unbeliever too
[1:29:55] because rain is a blessing that comes
[1:29:58] upon both uh the believer and the
[1:30:00] unbeliever
[1:30:03] otherwise God was going to give rain
[1:30:05] only to his shoulders that he says learn
[1:30:08] from the nature
[1:30:10] that's why Brothers nature
[1:30:29] the earth and the which we are walking
[1:30:32] today
[1:30:34] it was in the form of uh volcanic
[1:30:38] the volcanica it was it was fire yes
[1:30:45] before the Earth was uh solid
[1:30:50] he puts his Prince
[1:30:53] ownership
[1:31:04] everything is Sealed With Fire
[1:31:09] you can you get that's how you you can
[1:31:12] differentiate uh for instance a car
[1:31:14] that's a Mercedes and one that's a
[1:31:16] Toyota
[1:31:17] and Satan was there he was it was
[1:31:19] jumping
[1:31:23] but he had his Prince on on the earth
[1:31:27] a sin began in heaven
[1:31:33] if you were a devil in heaven
[1:31:38] yeah yeah you fought against the
[1:31:41] one-third
[1:31:43] here on
[1:31:46] Earthship even if you dress yourself
[1:31:49] like a sister with the long skirt
[1:31:53] and you are singing like an angel I pray
[1:31:57] for them all after your death
[1:32:01] you will go back to what you were in
[1:32:04] heaven a demon see
[1:32:15] and you become a criminal and you become
[1:32:19] a prostitute
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:21] you become a the most vile of all the
[1:32:25] Sinners
[1:32:26] before your death
[1:32:29] you will meet the world
[1:32:32] so you can go back to what you were
[1:32:35] before
[1:32:37] we are the expressions of Two Worlds of
[1:32:42] the devil and of God
[1:32:45] and that you examine your heart
[1:32:48] and your your face
[1:32:52] when the word of God is free
[1:32:55] that's when you will know is God in you
[1:33:00] oh is Satan that's in you
[1:33:04] even if you spend 50 years
[1:33:09] but if your life is contrary to the
[1:33:12] message
[1:33:13] your destination is hell
[1:33:21] the Satan Buddhist is French on Earth
[1:33:26] and he went back to Heaven
[1:33:29] he was the second after God
[1:33:32] blame me but he wanted to be first
[1:33:41] thank you
[1:33:43] please yeah God said he he convinced uh
[1:33:48] two-thirds
[1:33:49] and God he kicked him God kicked him all
[1:33:52] out of heaven
[1:33:54] when Satan was kicked out of heaven
[1:33:59] he didn't come down from heaven
[1:34:02] he he fall
[1:34:06] but Jesus came down from heaven
[1:34:09] and when Satan falls
[1:34:12] that's how he deformed the Earth
[1:34:17] something that Moses didn't see
[1:34:22] because Moses says the Earth was uh uh
[1:34:25] was uh with that form and void
[1:34:29] for me God didn't create something
[1:34:32] without forms perfect God creates
[1:34:35] something that's perfect
[1:34:37] everything that God does is perfect
[1:34:40] is Satan
[1:34:42] who came to destroy the Earth when he
[1:34:46] was
[1:34:47] kicked down from heaven then God put
[1:34:50] foreign
[1:35:00] so he can form man
[1:35:05] God took men who was created
[1:35:09] before men he put he placed him into the
[1:35:12] man who was formed
[1:35:14] the man who was formed
[1:35:17] is the 16 elements
[1:35:20] that's why you sin second
[1:35:24] that's the prince of Satan
[1:35:27] this is not you but yeah you see you are
[1:35:31] inside
[1:35:32] you are inside
[1:35:35] you know the words
[1:35:39] for Perfection the real you looks for
[1:35:43] the will of God the real you looks for
[1:35:46] what's good and acceptable
[1:35:50] yeah
[1:35:53] differences
[1:35:55] look at the difference between the the
[1:35:58] Samaritan woman and the rich man
[1:36:03] the Samaritan woman in her body see Mary
[1:36:07] six husband
[1:36:08] thank you
[1:36:12] Jesus was the seventh
[1:36:16] now in her body
[1:36:20] patient sinner
[1:36:27] when the manifested word
[1:36:32] was presented to her she accepted the
[1:36:36] word and she was saved the the Rich
[1:36:40] Young Ruler in his body it was perfect
[1:36:45] he kept all the Ten Commandments Jesus
[1:36:49] looks at him
[1:36:50] he says one thing that I like it
[1:36:53] how many how many how many things do we
[1:36:57] lack
[1:37:04] how many how many things do we like
[1:37:19] because he was a demon
[1:37:25] now I want to show you
[1:37:28] the four measures quickly here we're
[1:37:32] gonna finish in 15 minutes
[1:37:36] the four measures of the love of God
[1:37:39] let's take the the the the the length
[1:37:44] of the love of God
[1:37:49] the breath of the love of God is in John
[1:37:52] 3 16.
[1:37:55] but God so loved the world
[1:37:59] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:38:04] that you who that believes in him
[1:38:10] for believing him our faith can keep
[1:38:13] going that would so ever believe in him
[1:38:17] should not perish
[1:38:20] but heavy everlasting life
[1:38:24] the price of the love of God
[1:38:27] is for all remember Jack criminal even
[1:38:31] if you are criminal
[1:38:34] even if you did something that was bad
[1:38:38] tonight
[1:38:40] the right of the love of God
[1:38:44] God has open arms for him to receive you
[1:38:47] better than you you can come and he's
[1:38:51] going to receive you because the word of
[1:38:54] God says come as you were
[1:38:57] close for me the pastor cannot change
[1:39:01] but the Branham cannot change
[1:39:04] it's God who changes
[1:39:07] through his word
[1:39:10] and his word is love
[1:39:13] and the love is his measure
[1:39:16] for the first time in the history of
[1:39:19] mankind
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:30] that if the the oceans were incense and
[1:39:34] we had parchment made to write of the
[1:39:37] love of God that the oceans will dry why
[1:39:43] because his love is so great
[1:39:46] so that he can save you
[1:39:49] what a man can tell you he loves you
[1:39:52] tomorrow is gonna it's gonna call you
[1:39:55] all kinds of names are you who's gonna
[1:39:57] say um you are you have deceived me a
[1:40:00] parent can say I love you and then he's
[1:40:04] gonna say
[1:40:05] you you have deceived me but when God
[1:40:09] loves you
[1:40:10] he loves you as you are yes God
[1:40:14] sovereign
[1:40:29] who was abandoned by the whole city
[1:40:32] and he knew nowhere else to go back to
[1:40:35] the cemetery but the love of God
[1:40:38] in his breath it came down
[1:40:43] for a fool
[1:40:47] he said Lord what are you gaining this
[1:40:49] man is a fool what are you gaining this
[1:40:52] man is a fool is a fool
[1:40:54] what are you gonna gain with this fool
[1:40:57] with this man
[1:40:58] he's nothing is worth nothing
[1:41:03] indicator
[1:41:39] there was there had been many signposts
[1:41:42] that pointed to that day many great for
[1:41:45] sure it's been foreshawn by Lambs by
[1:41:49] Bullock by uh turtle doves and all these
[1:41:52] signs
[1:41:56] you see the the blood of the Bulls and
[1:41:59] the goats and all those things you
[1:42:01] couldn't say man
[1:42:03] it was a need for the blood of Jesus
[1:42:07] Jesus had to die for you
[1:42:10] who are you said
[1:42:15] God
[1:42:17] so loved the world
[1:42:19] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:42:22] whosoever
[1:42:25] say I am whosoever
[1:42:31] Mana
[1:42:33] now
[1:42:34] more
[1:42:45] pose
[1:42:50] is
[1:43:09] so but he could not break it it could
[1:43:14] not break it it could not break that
[1:43:16] death hold for Satan had the Earth the
[1:43:20] very rocks that he once walked upon down
[1:43:24] on the earth burning brimstones Lucifer
[1:43:28] was the son of the morning and he walked
[1:43:31] on the earth when it was burning
[1:43:33] volcanic
[1:43:35] he was it says those same rocks that had
[1:43:39] cooled off
[1:43:42] but when Jesus died now listen you can
[1:43:46] read on
[1:43:48] friend he placed his imprint
[1:43:52] where the devil had put his imprint
[1:43:55] it was so that he can clean up
[1:43:59] the power of the devil
[1:44:02] from your life
[1:44:06] and
[1:44:19] he saved a thief
[1:44:23] without being baptized the the thieves
[1:44:28] the length
[1:44:31] the length
[1:44:34] it's in Jeremiah 31 and 31 and 3.
[1:44:41] [Applause]
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:45] I loved you with an eternal love
[1:44:50] what was it
[1:44:52] wasn't
[1:44:56] with her love it says therefore with
[1:44:58] loving kindness I have drawn him
[1:45:10] but when I'm preaches God who's rich in
[1:45:13] Mercy
[1:45:16] and with this reaches that Paul is
[1:45:19] speaking in Ephesians chapter 3.
[1:45:23] that he may strengthen you mightily I
[1:45:26] don't think
[1:45:29] Christ May abide in your heart
[1:45:33] and when Christ abides in you
[1:45:35] you cannot do all kinds of stuff
[1:45:38] even if science says this you are in the
[1:45:42] word
[1:45:47] the
[1:45:49] breath of the love of God
[1:45:54] it's a it's a it's a very deep love
[1:46:01] that
[1:46:02] shows the problem it's a founding in in
[1:46:06] the Deep things it's a Philippines it's
[1:46:09] Philippians 3 5. and you don't go
[1:46:12] through to Heaven you

[1:46:31] to have the same love the same the mind
[1:46:35] that was in Christ
[1:46:38] say Philippians Philippians yeah
[1:46:42] two two five
[1:46:47] to having you remember something the
[1:46:51] same mind

[1:47:03] being God up there
[1:47:05] he came down
[1:47:08] in sin
[1:47:11] he became man
[1:47:14] Ila
[1:47:18] he became one who watches a food washing

[1:50:41] you're not gonna go up
[1:50:43] because the secret with God to go up you
[1:50:47] have to come down
[1:50:52] the depths of the love of God for Peter
[1:50:56] yeah
[1:50:58] he says oh wash my hands too
[1:51:01] not just the feet
[1:51:06] it says the Lord wherever you go I'll go
[1:51:09] he was very excited
[1:51:13] he says where I go you cannot come
[1:51:19] he sees and Jesus get apprehended
[1:51:23] start beating in
[1:51:27] [Music]
[1:51:42] he looks at him no he's God he cannot
[1:51:45] cry
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:51:48] his God he cannot cry
[1:51:51] ing
[1:51:54] Paul was thinking that Jesus is going to
[1:51:57] call angels to come down that you may
[1:52:00] burn all these people
[1:52:04] and and God took the cross this cross
[1:52:08] and it was started going see
[1:52:11] in this section it was a complete
[1:52:15] deception there were this there were it
[1:52:19] was a letdown yeah they were let down
[1:52:22] everybody was thinking
[1:52:25] but their thinking is not the word
[1:52:30] Mary was there crying and Jesus says
[1:52:35] your turn will come
[1:52:40] I'm not taking everything
[1:52:43] there's also a cross for you
[1:52:46] tonight I'm letting you know
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:50] every one of us has a cross to bear
[1:52:54] don't throw it away
[1:52:57] it's gonna help you up there
[1:53:01] you need a cross somewhere around it
[1:53:04] it's that that's what's gonna help you
[1:53:07] to get to heaven you're gonna walk on
[1:53:10] top of them so you can go to the other
[1:53:12] side
[1:53:14] don't walk without the cross
[1:53:17] don't walk without love
[1:53:21] you
[1:53:36] I don't I don't even know him
[1:53:39] tell me if your wife denies you
[1:53:45] if your son denies you you know what it
[1:53:48] does to the heart you know what he does
[1:53:50] to the heart
[1:53:52] your son says he doesn't know you
[1:53:55] and he's mocking you and it's laughing
[1:53:58] you are not my mom
[1:54:00] I don't know you
[1:54:10] the strength of Satan
[1:54:15] but the love of God
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:19] it doesn't look what what Peter did when
[1:54:23] he died
[1:54:24] God gave Peter the Holy Spirit
[1:54:29] and Peter came and he gave the formula
[1:54:32] on how we're going to get into the
[1:54:34] kingdom of God
[1:54:42] hello man
[1:54:53] I need 12 disciples
[1:54:56] uh bring me 11.
[1:55:00] Peter was going to go
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:03] he was going to bring 11 sinners like
[1:55:07] him
[1:55:08] because he is the place where he lived
[1:55:12] is Entourage that's where they were
[1:55:14] cutting catching fish
[1:55:17] look at Matthew
[1:55:20] Matthew was a collector
[1:55:24] he was on a different level
[1:55:27] if God told him the same thing
[1:55:30] Matthew was going to go and get people
[1:55:32] that were in his Entourage
[1:55:35] but look at the love of God
[1:55:38] the love of God when and God of bigger
[1:55:42] he went and took the lowest he put them
[1:55:45] all together
[1:55:46] and he says you are my children
[1:55:51] the the depths of the love of God the
[1:55:55] height
[1:55:56] the height
[1:55:59] there is nothing higher than the throne
[1:56:02] and to him that Overcomers I will I will
[1:56:06] give him a uh
[1:56:08] to to to to to to overcome is to keep
[1:56:11] life
[1:56:12] his love
[1:56:15] he took the throne
[1:56:19] that he refused to give to Satan
[1:56:23] he gave it to you
[1:56:29] if you call the White House tonight
[1:56:33] say I'm also American
[1:56:37] I also have to come and eat at the table
[1:56:41] I have to come eat
[1:56:43] I have to eat with Biden
[1:56:47] you will not get in
[1:56:58] Throne is very low but how much more the
[1:57:03] bigger Throne of God
[1:57:07] Satan enviously until this day that's
[1:57:12] why Paul says
[1:57:13] that all the saints that they may
[1:57:18] understand
[1:57:20] it requires an understanding
[1:57:24] to see that the man who told you he
[1:57:27] loves you doesn't love you
[1:57:33] the mother who told you he loves you she
[1:57:37] doesn't love you
[1:57:39] there is no love like the love of God
[1:57:42] the love of God is alive
[1:57:47] with full measures for his children
[1:57:56] he's always there waiting for you
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:24] is it good for me to go
[1:58:27] stay with us stay with us it's very
[1:58:31] important that I go
[1:58:32] I will not leave you alone
[1:58:37] I will send you a comforter
[1:58:42] let's visit the spirit of truth
[1:58:45] that's why we finish
[1:58:50] I'm going to prepare for you
[1:58:54] a house
[1:58:59] is a body
[1:59:25] the body will be created the soul will
[1:59:28] be created
[1:59:30] and will live eternally
[1:59:33] and they will not be sin
[1:59:37] the glory to come
[1:59:41] is much greater
[1:59:56] in giving excuses
[2:00:03] God is not going to ask you how much
[2:00:06] money you will how much work you did
[2:01:07] one second you have to have that form so
[2:01:11] you can go to the other side if you
[2:01:14] don't go there's another place that
[2:01:16] waits for you thank you it's The Fifth
[2:01:19] Dimension
[2:01:21] we're living between two Dimensions
[2:01:26] there's a family of God
[2:01:29] and when God went to the Earth
[2:01:32] they greeted him and they greeted him
[2:01:38] he says they were real jealous I saw
[2:01:41] them
[2:01:42] and there was a sister who was about 78.
[2:01:49] it's the truth
[2:01:52] there is children of God in heaven
[2:01:57] these angels
[2:01:59] is that those that are slipped in Christ
[2:02:02] and there is God himself and here on
[2:02:05] Earth
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:25] God bless you
[2:02:28] foreign
[2:02:28] [Applause]
[2:03:03] God's a great God
[2:03:07] and
[2:03:11] a promise remains a promise
[2:03:14] until it's manifested
[2:03:17] and then when it promises manifested
[2:03:21] then that's the word becoming flesh
[2:03:25] and I thought tonight it was a
[2:03:28] a wonderful
[2:03:31] reminder really what were to be made out
[2:03:34] of
[2:03:36] but also there's a great opportunity
[2:03:38] this evening
[2:03:40] and I want to ask you
[2:03:45] this evening if you feel that you have
[2:03:47] that love of God
[2:03:48] in your heart
[2:03:51] and
[2:03:52] and where would that love
[2:03:55] take you
[2:03:56] to what extent would you go
[2:04:00] the scripture says no greater love hath
[2:04:02] than man than to lay his life down for
[2:04:05] another
[2:04:06] and
[2:04:08] really
[2:04:10] that's the essence
[2:04:13] of what God is that God is love
[2:04:17] so we have a wonderful
[2:04:19] opportunity this evening
[2:04:22] to express that love
[2:04:27] we have a
[2:04:29] a young lady that's come here
[2:04:34] this evening
[2:04:36] she's a
[2:04:38] friend and customer
[2:04:40] of brother Jose
[2:04:45] and sicknesses
[2:04:47] struck her body
[2:04:49] he's not a member of our church but
[2:04:52] she's a member of our family
[2:04:57] because our love doesn't
[2:05:00] stop at these walls
[2:05:03] and she's come this evening because she
[2:05:06] heard that we pray for the sick
[2:05:11] and
[2:05:14] the doctors
[2:05:17] can't give her any other promise
[2:05:22] than the promise of the flesh
[2:05:25] the promise of science
[2:05:29] but we heard tonight about a God that's
[2:05:31] above science
[2:05:35] his love isn't Bound by the Four Corners
[2:05:38] of this Earth it's not bound by this
[2:05:40] dimension
[2:05:42] it's eternal
[2:05:47] and when you see someone
[2:05:51] to me that
[2:05:54] is willing to come to a church she's
[2:05:56] never been to before
[2:06:02] because she heard a word
[2:06:06] about a people that believe that God
[2:06:08] sent a messenger
[2:06:11] she heard the testimonies
[2:06:16] of the Miracles
[2:06:20] and the Deliverance
[2:06:22] that was Wrath by the spirit of God
[2:06:25] in our generation
[2:06:28] and she's come because she's cut
[2:06:31] no other place to go
[2:06:35] but to him
[2:06:40] now my question is is you have the love
[2:06:42] of God in your heart
[2:06:45] that your can take on that burden
[2:06:49] that your faith could rise up
[2:06:53] to where it's no longer of Faith talked
[2:06:56] about
[2:06:58] but it's a faith put into action
[2:07:04] it's not a faith about a God that lived
[2:07:07] 2 000 years ago
[2:07:11] or a God that manifested 50 60 years ago
[2:07:16] but a God that's here tonight
[2:07:20] the same yesterday
[2:07:22] today and forever
[2:07:27] does your love and faith join together
[2:07:30] that he said wherever two or three are
[2:07:32] gathered together in my name
[2:07:36] I'll be in the midst
[2:07:41] our sister didn't come tonight to join a
[2:07:44] church
[2:07:47] she didn't come tonight to be
[2:07:51] indoctrinated with
[2:07:54] our belief or our doctrines
[2:07:57] though we believe their sound
[2:08:01] though we believe they're scripturally
[2:08:03] based
[2:08:10] but you come to
[2:08:13] ask the Lord Jesus
[2:08:15] and ask us to join together
[2:08:19] with her
[2:08:21] to ask him
[2:08:23] if he would heal her
[2:08:29] so it's finally come to the age church
[2:08:31] it's no longer talk
[2:08:34] [Music]
[2:08:36] you know what I mean either that love of
[2:08:39] God is in your heart
[2:08:44] when I met her in the parking lot I
[2:08:47] I said sister your brother Jose said
[2:08:52] you would come
[2:08:53] she said yes I am I took her by the hand
[2:08:57] I said I see that you have a good heart
[2:09:00] she says I try
[2:09:06] now I believe
[2:09:09] with all my heart
[2:09:12] that she has the faith this evening
[2:09:18] but do you have the love
[2:09:20] to join
[2:09:22] your faith
[2:09:23] with her faith
[2:09:27] I mean to pour your heart into it
[2:09:30] and believe
[2:09:33] I'm not talking about standing back
[2:09:36] and say a prayer
[2:09:40] and say I'm now I'm going to watch to
[2:09:43] see what the results are
[2:09:46] foreign
[2:09:48] the Lord put those people out
[2:09:53] like if you're sitting here now and you
[2:09:55] say well I've got to go and
[2:09:57] I I need to I got things to do and I've
[2:10:01] got to get up early then it'd be
[2:10:03] probably better
[2:10:12] but if you're willing to join your faith
[2:10:15] with her faith
[2:10:18] you're willing to
[2:10:20] take her into your heart
[2:10:23] and say I believe Jesus Christ heals you
[2:10:26] sister
[2:10:28] because you've heard the word
[2:10:31] and the truth sets you free
[2:10:34] we heard tonight of a power that's
[2:10:36] greater than any power that Satan has
[2:10:39] the love of God
[2:10:43] and the promise to the church is that
[2:10:45] the love of God will be shed abroad in
[2:10:47] our hearts by the Holy Spirit
[2:10:54] I know she
[2:10:56] told me her name but you know how I am
[2:10:58] with names
[2:11:01] and their friend that's with her
[2:11:04] so sister I'd like to invite you
[2:11:07] if you would to come this evening
[2:11:12] here
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:22] [Music]
[2:11:37] it'd be an honor for you to come here
[2:11:42] I guess it's cancer right
[2:11:47] thank you
[2:11:49] we know what cancer is don't we
[2:11:52] it's a spirit Glory
[2:11:54] it's an outside Spirit living in her
[2:11:57] body
[2:12:00] and that's why Jesus went to the cross
[2:12:05] for the scripture tells us that the
[2:12:08] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[2:12:12] in other words the penalty for sin
[2:12:16] he bore that penalty
[2:12:18] and by his stripes
[2:12:21] we are healed
[2:12:24] and the scripture tells the sister that
[2:12:27] Jesus Christ is the same as yesterday
[2:12:30] today and forever yes and the bible
[2:12:33] promises Us in this last day
[2:12:37] that there would be a people
[2:12:40] upon the Earth not a denomination
[2:12:44] not a religious organization not a
[2:12:48] system
[2:12:50] but there would be an elected people
[2:12:55] that had the indwelling spirit of Jesus
[2:12:59] Christ
[2:13:03] and he would be standing in this
[2:13:05] generation in bright form yes
[2:13:13] I ask you one thing you feel for love
[2:13:16] and I have my heart for you
[2:13:19] [Music]
[2:13:22] watch him
[2:13:26] yes yes
[2:13:39] okay and Satan can't happen
[2:13:44] I don't believe the Lord
[2:13:50] money
[2:13:58] so if
[2:14:00] Jesus was standing here today
[2:14:04] not in this body but in the body he was
[2:14:07] in 2000 years ago
[2:14:09] and you came and took him by the hands
[2:14:13] you
[2:14:17] yes Glory Glory
[2:14:21] absolutely he's the same yes Glory

[2:15:05] on Calvary

[2:15:12] to surround her
[2:15:15] Satan we endure you in the name of the
[2:15:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:15:20] you have no part of her she is not her
[2:15:24] we rebuke you in the name of the Lord

[2:15:35] claim and pray and command you by the
[2:15:39] blood and the love of calvary
