[9:01] you right border Mike for songwriting
[9:12] agreed each one in the name of the Lord
[9:14] this morning I'm a bruise I kind of
[9:16] missed that microphone sort of feels
[9:19] weird to stand up here holding a
[9:21] microphone in there just a country boy
[9:25] it's good to be in the house of Lord
[9:28] this morning you know there's so much as
[9:32] Bruce alluded to craziness in the world
[9:35] and just when you think it can't get any
[9:38] crazier Satan shows us that he can make
[9:41] it crazy a while ago our company was
[9:50] trying to do a get to know the officer
[9:53] thing on the blog you know we were all
[9:57] sort of socially distanced and they were
[10:00] concerned people were sort of forgetting
[10:03] who the leaders the organization where I
[10:04] guess I don't know and so they reached
[10:07] out to us and all of us and had us fill
[10:10] a little question here you know where
[10:12] were you from what's your favorite color
[10:14] green bunch of stuff what's your
[10:18] favorite song
[10:19] well now that's weird you know I'm sorry
[10:22] but I'm not into all these rock groups
[10:25] or country groups and most of those
[10:28] songs I wouldn't know him if you played
[10:31] it for me the first time I wouldn't know
[10:32] him and after I thought for a minute I I
[10:36] responded Amazing Grace how sweet the
[10:40] sound because there's no better song
[10:43] that I can think of then a song of
[10:47] redemption a song that teaches us and
[10:50] reminds us that we are redeemed by that
[10:53] precious blood Fanny Crosby is a song
[10:57] writer that many of us know she wrote
[11:01] over 8,000 hymns she was uh she lived to
[11:06] be 95 years old in that 95 years she not
[11:11] only wrote 8,000 hymns but she wrote
[11:14] over a thousand and non-religious songs
[11:16] for books of poetry and two best-selling
[11:19] autobiographies she was an accomplished
[11:22] voice for the Lord
[11:24] and except for the six months first I
[11:29] rather that's it first six weeks of her
[11:30] life she was blind as you probably know
[11:33] a country doctor who wasn't very well
[11:37] trained and he applied a mustard plaster
[11:39] to her eyes for some reason and from
[11:42] that time on she was blinded and at nine
[11:47] years old when somebody asked her how
[11:51] she felt about that she said that I
[11:53] possess a great jewel contentment
[11:56] she wrote oh what a happy soul am i
[12:00] although I cannot see I am resolved that
[12:04] in this world
[12:05] contented I would be how many blessings
[12:08] I enjoy that other people don't to weep
[12:12] and sigh because I'm blind I cannot and
[12:15] I won't you know it's a this woman has
[12:20] always impressed me the marvelous
[12:23] testimony the amazing gift that God put
[12:26] in her life you know she was very well
[12:29] known in her day she actually played
[12:31] that ulysses s grant funeral very
[12:34] well-known met many dignitaries and in
[12:37] 1873 she was visiting a friend mrs.
[12:41] Joseph Knapp who was an accomplished
[12:44] musician the florists but she was also
[12:45] the wife of the president of the
[12:47] Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and
[12:51] mrs. Knapp had composed a tune and asked
[12:56] Fanny aunt Fanny as she was known to
[12:59] everyone back then what is this - and
[13:02] say to you
[13:03] Fanny said I'm just gonna give me a
[13:06] minute and she knelt and prayed and she
[13:09] got up and she said that tune says
[13:11] blessed assurance Jesus is mine and as
[13:17] she proceeded to dictate those words
[13:20] mrs. Knapp wrote them down to the music
[13:23] just the way we know it today blessed
[13:25] assurance Jesus is mine oh what a
[13:29] foretaste of glory divine air of
[13:33] salvation
[13:34] I'm born of his spirit washed in his
[13:35] blood Arab salvation
[13:38] purchase of God born of his spirit
[13:40] washed in his blood this is my story
[13:43] this is my song praising my Savior all
[13:47] the day long
[13:50] my precious now departed dear
[13:53] mother-in-law used to call Ellen almost
[13:57] every day and she always asked her what
[14:00] is your song today because her mother
[14:03] always had a song my wife inherited the
[14:07] gene and she wakes up with a song every
[14:10] day as well and she told me this morning
[14:13] she said well sometimes I wake up with a
[14:15] song it's not a good song she woke up
[14:17] the other day to the song America the
[14:20] Beautiful she said I had to get rid of
[14:22] that one and find a new song you know
[14:28] Fanny Crosby she wrote it seemed
[14:31] intended by the Blessed Providence of
[14:33] God
[14:33] that I should be blind all my life and I
[14:36] thank him for that dispensation if
[14:39] perfect earthly sight were offered to me
[14:41] tomorrow I would not accept it I might
[14:45] not have sung hymns to the praise of God
[14:47] if I had been distracted by the
[14:50] beautiful and interesting things around
[14:52] me so it begs the question what is our
[14:56] song are we distracted by the beautiful
[15:00] and interesting things around us are we
[15:05] distracted by the news and the pandemic
[15:07] and the rioting or whatever else is
[15:11] going on if it's not one thing it's
[15:12] another are we too busy listening to the
[15:16] ticker of the stock tape and the Wall
[15:18] Street Journal that we're missing the
[15:21] song of our life and we don't have to
[15:23] sing many of us can't
[15:25] but in our heart we should always have a
[15:28] song because all down through the Old
[15:31] Testament songs were used by the people
[15:34] of God to worship and praise Him they
[15:36] crossed the Red Sea had a song they
[15:40] arrived in the promised land it said
[15:41] Moses taught them a new song David has a
[15:44] whole book of Psalms we're gonna read
[15:46] one this morning Song of Solomon Isaiah
[15:49] Isaiah wrote
[15:52] great um that's a here sorry
[15:55] David's life was full of acid the Lord
[15:58] Jehovah is my strength and my song in
[16:01] the book of Revelation we know that they
[16:04] sing the song of Moses the servant of
[16:07] God and the song of the lamb saying
[16:09] great and marvellous either are they
[16:11] works Lord God Almighty just and true
[16:13] are thy ways thou king of saints so as I
[16:19] stumble through this this morning the
[16:22] point is what are what is the song that
[16:25] we're singing every day do we get up
[16:27] with thanks and praise rejoicing and
[16:29] what God has done for us we allow
[16:33] ourselves to get distracted by the
[16:34] things that tie our shoelaces together
[16:36] and get us off track how important is it
[16:40] that we give voice to the praise of the
[16:43] Lord that our lives sing honor and
[16:46] praise and glory and victory and
[16:48] Thanksgiving to the king of our
[16:50] salvation to the Lord of lords and we
[16:53] just we just want to remember this this
[16:55] morning that God loves to hear us sing
[16:58] let's turn to Psalms 47 this morning
[17:13] as we read it together songs 47 o clap
[17:18] your hands all ye people shout on to God
[17:21] with the voice of triumph for the Lord
[17:24] Most High is terrible he is a great king
[17:27] over all the earth he shall subdue the
[17:30] people under us and the nations under
[17:33] our feet he shall choose our inheritance
[17:36] for us the excellency of Jacob whom he
[17:39] loved Salah God has gone up with a shout
[17:42] the Lord with a sound of a trumpet sing
[17:46] praises to God sing praises sing praises
[17:49] unto our king sing praises for God is
[17:53] the king of all the earth
[17:54] singing praises with understanding God
[17:58] reigneth over the heathen God sitteth
[18:00] upon the throne of His Holiness the
[18:03] princes of the people are gathered
[18:05] together even the people of Abraham for
[18:09] the earth
[18:24] god bless you might have your seeds
[18:27] let's just say my lord I lift your name
[18:29] on high although I lift your name

[41:21] love for them because they come from you

[41:31] this time to break your word of life to
[41:34] us that your spirit would move upon this
[41:41] father and that we could just have a
[41:44] wonderful fellowship with you every need
[41:48] that we have Lord we committed into your
[41:51] hands the ones that's the author and
[41:55] finisher of our faith that knows the
[41:58] beginning from the end we just certainly
[42:02] Lord commit our hearts in our lives to
[42:06] you this morning once again we thank you
[42:09] for all that you've done for us in the
[42:12] precious name of your son our Lord and
[42:15] Savior Jesus Christ amen amen if you
[42:19] have your Bibles let's turn in our
[42:22] Bibles this morning over to Ephesians
[42:24] and read a couple of very familiar
[42:30] scriptures and we
[42:36] on a just fellowship this morning kind
[42:39] of just to go through some things and
[42:43] just have a good time in the Lord so
[42:45] let's read in Ephesians chapter 1 and
[42:49] we'll read the first few verses of that
[42:58] of Ephesians chapter 1 it says Paul an
[43:03] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[43:06] God to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[43:10] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus so
[43:15] we see that this epistle is written to
[43:19] the believer to those that are faithful
[43:23] in Christ Jesus because those who aren't
[43:27] faithful aren't going to get it okay so
[43:31] he says grace be to you and peace from
[43:36] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[43:41] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[43:46] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[43:51] us with all spiritual blessings in
[43:55] heavenly places in Christ according as
[44:00] he hath chosen us in him before the
[44:06] foundation of the world that we should
[44:10] be holy and without blame before him in
[44:14] love having predestinated us unto the
[44:20] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[44:24] himself according to the good pleasure
[44:28] of his will to the praise of the glory
[44:33] of His grace were and he hath made us
[44:37] accepted in the beloved in whom we have
[44:42] redemption through his blood forgiveness
[44:45] of sins according to the riches
[44:49] of His grace wherein he hath abounded
[44:52] toward us all wisdom and prudence having
[44:57] made known unto us the mystery of his
[45:01] will according to his good pleasure
[45:06] which he hath proposed in him self amen
[45:13] and then let's just read over in
[45:17] Ephesians 2 in 10 it says for we are his
[45:24] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[45:28] good works which God hath before
[45:32] ordained that we should walk in them
[45:36] father bless your word to us this
[45:39] morning in Jesus name we pray amen god
[45:43] bless you may be seated this morning
[45:49] we're going to if I could sake continue
[45:59] on from where we were last week and just
[46:06] keep building and you know last
[46:12] Wednesday I don't know if any of you had
[46:15] an opportunity to hear brother Randy's
[46:18] sermon but I certainly would recommend
[46:22] that if you didn't that you go back and
[46:25] listen to it and and you know as he was
[46:30] preaching he he you know was I had
[46:37] written notes as I was going down this
[46:40] road and he was just going on all those
[46:44] notes and not you know and and then I
[46:47] can't went to the men's breakfast
[46:51] yesterday morning and the brothers
[46:53] started talking about all the things
[46:55] that I had planned to minister on and I
[47:00] thought you know
[47:02] I thought well boy did they take the
[47:05] wind out of your sails and I thought no
[47:08] they put wind in my sails amen and
[47:13] someone said oh boy they they used to
[47:15] say if the preacher said something you
[47:17] were going to say they would say oh he
[47:19] stole my thunder no he gave me more
[47:22] thunder and I'll tell you out Lucinda
[47:25] Balaam's donkey if I can hear the word
[47:28] of God you know what I mean that's what
[47:31] I want to hear I want to hear the word
[47:33] of God so we're just going to continue
[47:35] on a lot of the things the brother said
[47:38] and we're talking about we'll talk about
[47:40] but they're worth talking about amen how
[47:44] many times you've heard a Bible story
[47:46] you can sit down right now and tell me
[47:49] the story of David and Goliath and I'll
[47:51] like it I've never got tired of hearing
[47:54] that story I never will get tired of
[47:56] hearing that story and it doesn't have
[47:59] nothing to do with my name being David I
[48:02] would like that story if my parents had
[48:05] named me Goliath but anyway because it's
[48:08] the truth it's the Bible and that's what
[48:11] we love and so what we we we want to
[48:15] just kind of approach this morning I
[48:18] told Billy I'm just going to try to
[48:20] teach a little bit this morning and not
[48:22] get excited
[48:23] of course he just grand and you know
[48:26] like okay whatever I'm going to do my
[48:29] best
[48:29] but anyway it's just that this web
[48:31] program says he says now preaching
[48:34] usually catches the sinner and brings
[48:39] him under condemnation by the word so
[48:44] there's a part of the word of God that
[48:47] brings us under condemnation or the word
[48:51] is not to mean it condemns you but it
[48:54] convicts you or it enlightens you that
[48:58] you're on a path of destruction and
[49:02] therefore the idea of convicting you is
[49:06] to change your ways to correct doesn't
[49:11] mean to punish it means to change your
[49:14] course
[49:15] for your betterment and God does that by
[49:18] grace and we know that grace is God
[49:23] intervening in your life from the throne
[49:27] of God making intervention in your life
[49:30] to change the inevitable outcome of your
[49:36] works and your decisions and the path
[49:39] you're on so if you're on a path going
[49:43] down the road a hundred miles an hour
[49:45] and there's a there's the bridges out
[49:48] and you're headed right over a cliff and
[49:51] and you there's no way you know that
[49:54] Cliff's there grace comes down and God
[49:58] decides I'm not going to let that man go
[50:01] over the cliff I'm going to intervene in
[50:03] his life I'm going to say to him you're
[50:05] going too fast you better slow down you
[50:09] better change directions you better and
[50:12] he convicts him and he brings it to his
[50:15] attention and he makes a change in his
[50:18] life so he doesn't end up with the
[50:22] result of his life and so that's what
[50:25] preaching of the gospel does to catch
[50:27] the sinner and to catch us when that our
[50:31] lives are not on the right path but we
[50:35] are talking this morning about teaching
[50:40] but teaching places a man positionally
[50:45] what he is now remember we begin to talk
[50:49] a while back about not who we are but
[50:52] what we are and so he says that's what
[50:56] teaching does teaching positionings
[51:00] a man what he is and we can never
[51:03] rightly be able to have faith until
[51:09] positionally we know what we are amen
[51:16] so that is that's what we're that's what
[51:19] we're working towards that's what we're
[51:21] talking about what that we are and so we
[51:27] we know that
[51:28] we have an inheritance and I certainly
[51:32] liked that song this morning because in
[51:36] that song he said he shall choose our
[51:40] inheritance for us so God has chosen our
[51:45] inheritance and we that's the kind of
[51:48] what direction that we would like to
[51:50] move in now
[51:52] when we talk about a believer and so we
[51:57] want to look at ourselves this morning
[52:01] and just so we're we're not preaching
[52:07] kind of a general gospel but we're
[52:10] giving a teaching this morning so that
[52:13] each of us can reflect upon ourselves
[52:17] because we're members in particular
[52:21] we're fitted enjoying together but each
[52:25] one of us is a part each one of us has a
[52:28] part we're a body and we've been given
[52:31] different places in that body so we
[52:36] talked about last week about our subject
[52:40] was going beyond a seed faith so that
[52:47] that's what was put on our heart
[52:52] going beyond seed faith and so we looked
[52:57] at Moses and we saw that Moses was a
[53:02] believer right he had faith he was born
[53:07] with a a tremendous faith and we'll
[53:12] reach some statements concerning that
[53:15] that Moses had a tremendous faith in his
[53:20] life but that faith came from the fact
[53:24] that he was chosen and he also believed
[53:29] God because his mother taught him he
[53:34] believed and that he was separated from
[53:38] his mother's womb by God so
[53:42] had seed faith and and that seed faith
[53:48] responded to the Word of God so he heard
[53:52] the Word of God and just look at us this
[53:55] morning you heard the Word of God you
[53:57] believed it someone else heard the Word
[54:00] of God and it went over their head it
[54:03] just didn't catch their attention you
[54:06] know but there was something in you like
[54:09] antenna or a receiver that you felt the
[54:14] pull of it and so that was there that
[54:18] that seed was in there and that seed
[54:21] responds and just like our prophet
[54:24] talked about botany life
[54:26] he said that seed responds to the Sun
[54:29] and that Sun pulls out of that seed and
[54:33] causes that seed to grow and so it is
[54:39] with us we have a seed and the S o n we
[54:43] hear that light that sunlight falls on
[54:47] us and we respond to that sunlight we
[54:50] respond to that word we respond to that
[54:54] conviction we respond to the instruction
[54:58] we respond to the the learning of the as
[55:04] we're taught the Godhead as we're taught
[55:07] grace as we were taught the Scriptures
[55:10] just like you go to school and they want
[55:13] to teach you of course I don't know what
[55:15] they teach anymore do they still teach
[55:18] kerfs at all is that even a subject I
[55:21] guess not it really I'm getting up there
[55:24] someone wrote me a letter saying brother
[55:26] McGarry you're getting old and you're
[55:27] not going to be with us very long can
[55:29] you please write down your wisdom and I
[55:33] thought I got that person fooled but you
[55:38] know you are wisdoms the Bible a man
[55:44] that's where the fear of God's the
[55:46] beginning of wisdom anyway you should
[55:49] every decision you make you should take
[55:52] back to the scriptures but we go to
[55:54] school and we learn
[55:56] and and and we're learning and we
[55:59] realized that in order to have
[56:02] productive citizens to have people that
[56:05] can take care of themselves and provide
[56:09] and be part of society that we would
[56:12] have to teach them and we used to teach
[56:16] manners manners was a way that you would
[56:20] conduct yourselves and everybody would
[56:22] conduct themselves according to these
[56:25] manners and we would get along with one
[56:28] another it would provide for us social
[56:31] order it would provide for us a common
[56:35] sense of decency you would give a lady a
[56:38] seat you would open the door for
[56:41] somebody you would help somebody with
[56:43] groceries you wouldn't interrupt in the
[56:46] middle of somebody's conversation you
[56:49] will hear parents tell their children
[56:51] now a susie a daddy's talking now you
[56:56] just know nowadays it's yes Suzy what do
[57:03] you want
[57:05] you know that's prophecy that the
[57:09] children shall rule but you used to
[57:12] teach manners so things life could go on
[57:15] and so that's what the Word of God does
[57:19] it it it teaches us it were growing were
[57:26] we're learning and the seed in us is
[57:31] responding to that what we hear that
[57:37] that seed faith and Moses had that seed
[57:42] faith in fact he had it not
[57:45] intellectually and in in in his heart
[57:50] and therefore he went and he tried to
[57:53] perform it by intellect but we found out
[57:57] that there was something beyond seed
[58:01] faith and and sowed after what we were
[58:06] we're going down that
[58:08] Road so that we can we can grow and and
[58:14] mature if and isn't that what we want to
[58:18] do we really want to grow and mature so
[58:22] let me say this here is I'm reading
[58:24] he says that's where the believer comes
[58:27] he first comes to the recognition that
[58:31] he's a sinner okay so that is what we
[58:35] call being called right so we have
[58:40] stages in our life and the first part of
[58:45] our stage was the call and what usually
[58:49] we refer to that as the germination of
[58:55] the seed by the word so God allows your
[59:00] life to get to a place because a seed
[59:04] has to be in a certain temperature in a
[59:07] certain condition in a certain place in
[59:10] order for it to germinate so in your
[59:14] life each of your lives that sitting
[59:16] here your you you be there you're either
[59:20] here being prepared to be called you're
[59:25] here having been called you you
[59:30] understand but it all starts with a
[59:32] calling and you didn't choose him he
[59:37] chose you
[59:38] so that's where it starts you didn't one
[59:41] day brightly decide that serving God was
[59:45] the right thing to do no yeah that's
[59:48] what Jesus looked at me said you didn't
[59:50] choose me I chose you okay so and we
[59:55] also placed that calling we placed the
[59:59] same word with that as election that he
[1:00:03] elected us so all that he foreknew he
[1:00:07] called he chose he knew who would have
[1:00:11] salvation
[1:00:12] so he made a provision for them through
[1:00:16] his blood and by calling them so we are
[1:00:19] all called
[1:00:21] he says so we're believer comes in he
[1:00:24] first comes to the recognition he's a
[1:00:26] sinner he's called then he is separated
[1:00:30] by the waters the washing of the waters
[1:00:35] of the word by the blood or the washing
[1:00:39] of the water by the word rather
[1:00:42] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] so we he's called and then he's washed
[1:00:50] or we would call that he's being
[1:00:53] justified okay and that's what's
[1:00:57] beautiful about justification in other
[1:01:00] words everything that's laid to your
[1:01:02] charge all the debt you owe for your sin
[1:01:06] the rightful of the rightful punishment
[1:01:11] the rightful reaping all those things he
[1:01:17] he justifies you he takes it from your
[1:01:21] charge and makes you as if you never
[1:01:24] done it in the first place now if you
[1:01:28] have a record like mine you really love
[1:01:31] justification in fact he goes so far in
[1:01:38] teaching of marriage and divorce that
[1:01:42] you're justified because it was caused
[1:01:46] by the previous husband or previous
[1:01:50] nature that you got from Eve out of the
[1:01:55] garden oh you never did it in the first
[1:02:02] fall thank you Lord and not only that I
[1:02:09] paid for any debt that you would have oh
[1:02:14] thank you lord hallelujah I'm not
[1:02:18] fighting that battle no more you
[1:02:23] understand we got it we're moving past
[1:02:27] that battle we're going beyond see faith
[1:02:30] so so we're just a
[1:02:35] and then we're washed by the walk by the
[1:02:40] water of the word then being justified
[1:02:43] be faith he becomes partakers at the
[1:02:47] peace with God through Christ Jesus
[1:02:49] baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:52] Christ so then we are invited and listen
[1:02:58] to this now we are through the blood of
[1:03:02] Jesus Christ we're at peace with God
[1:03:07] through Christ baptized in the name of
[1:03:10] Jesus Christ to omit him into the
[1:03:15] journey you get it into the journey then
[1:03:21] he becomes a sojourner and a pilgrim
[1:03:25] he's on his journey to what a promise
[1:03:30] that God made Oh amen so now we've been
[1:03:40] called we been justified we've been
[1:03:43] sanctified we've entered into the
[1:03:46] journey right
[1:03:48] we've been baptized with the Holy Spirit
[1:03:52] so this is who we're talking to this
[1:03:56] morning we're not preaching the baptism
[1:04:00] of the Holy Spirit we're not preaching
[1:04:03] against sin so to speak in other words
[1:04:09] we're not preaching against the
[1:04:12] attribute of sin that identifies that
[1:04:17] you are a unbeliever so if you're doing
[1:04:20] this if you're doing that if you're
[1:04:23] doing this you are this so we're not
[1:04:26] even going there we're moving on to
[1:04:30] perfection not laying again the
[1:04:33] foundation of repentance of sin of
[1:04:35] laying on of hands and those things
[1:04:38] which we will do if God so permits but
[1:04:42] we're moving on to a perfection hey man
[1:04:47] that's what I want to do
[1:04:49] so this is what we're talking about so
[1:04:54] this is who that who that we are this
[1:05:01] morning now he's talking and then we're
[1:05:05] talking this morning
[1:05:06] Duke spiritual Canaanites Israel the
[1:05:11] spiritual Israel who has possessed the
[1:05:16] land Oh aren't you glad you've come out
[1:05:20] of Egypt garlic and I thought this
[1:05:24] morning I am so glad I am not relying on
[1:05:28] this world or this government I mean we
[1:05:35] got anarchy in the land we've got a
[1:05:38] bunch of people who went down inside the
[1:05:41] city set up barricades have got guns and
[1:05:45] said we are in an autonomous zone we
[1:05:52] rule this 12 blocks of downtown Seattle
[1:06:01] good for you
[1:06:03] I'm going to pick the better city where
[1:06:08] it's not so dismal and rainy all the
[1:06:11] time and all that stuff but nobody
[1:06:14] against Seattle if you're listening from
[1:06:16] Seattle my advice is move but anyway so
[1:06:25] thank God I mean I think we would all be
[1:06:30] better off if we I think they call it
[1:06:33] going off the grid if we just turn off
[1:06:36] our radios quit listen to all those
[1:06:39] Talking Heads quit listening to all
[1:06:41] those politicians because they don't
[1:06:44] rule your life anyway Amen God rules
[1:06:48] your life he is the provider I have not
[1:06:51] seen the righteous beg bread saved the
[1:06:54] Lord

[1:06:58] take care of you
[1:06:59] Amen nobody is going to take you home
[1:07:02] until I decide I want you home you've
[1:07:07] lived out your purpose take me home this
[1:07:12] is not our home okay so we're talking so
[1:07:18] this is to us listen to the description
[1:07:21] of who that you are this morning and
[1:07:24] where that you're setting and understand
[1:07:27] that what we're talking about is moving
[1:07:31] forward from this position here it says
[1:07:36] that who has possessed land aren't you
[1:07:39] glad you come out of the out of Egypt
[1:07:42] garlic aren't you glad you're out of the
[1:07:47] wilderness and remember they had to eat
[1:07:51] manna angels food out of heaven until
[1:07:54] they crossed over into the land and when
[1:07:59] they crossed over into the land the
[1:08:02] manna cease to fall they were fully
[1:08:06] matured then all right how long have we
[1:08:10] been in this message 50 some years we've
[1:08:14] listened we're talking about fully
[1:08:17] matured so this is this where we want to
[1:08:23] go forward from the position of maturity
[1:08:32] okay so we're not been a labor trying to
[1:08:36] mature you you know what I mean I mean
[1:08:42] there comes a time when you know you got
[1:08:48] to open the door and say there's the
[1:08:52] world I've done everything with you that
[1:08:54] I can do you've got to choose the way
[1:08:58] that you're going to go you've grown up
[1:09:02] now so it says and now the roasts and
[1:09:07] remember they had eaten a manna food
[1:09:09] from heaven they crossed over now then
[1:09:12] they were fully matured then
[1:09:15] eat the old corn out of the land now
[1:09:20] that you're you're not babes anymore now
[1:09:26] that you're not desiring the sincere
[1:09:30] milk of the gospel that you don't have
[1:09:33] to be babes padded and persuaded to come
[1:09:38] to church now that you're really fully
[1:09:41] matured Christians you're ready to eat
[1:09:44] strong meat now okay we're done old
[1:09:49] please come to church we're done
[1:09:52] come take communion come take communion
[1:09:54] because if you don't know by now that if
[1:09:59] you don't take communion you will not be
[1:10:05] there and the story that's what he
[1:10:13] taught I can't change that I would love
[1:10:16] to change that I may be there pleading
[1:10:19] for you Lord they don't come back to
[1:10:23] church on communion they got other
[1:10:27] things to do they forgive them Lord they
[1:10:32] they got to work and they got to do this
[1:10:34] and they got to do that and the Lord
[1:10:37] said I only gave them three Commandments
[1:10:39] I only told them there's three things
[1:10:44] they must do
[1:10:46] they must be baptized in the name of the
[1:10:51] Lord Jesus right that automatically
[1:10:54] leaves you to the promise you do that he
[1:10:57] gives you the Holy Ghost okay take
[1:11:01] communion and foot washing because he
[1:11:06] said do this in remembrance of me so if
[1:11:11] you refuse to do it then your feet
[1:11:16] refusing to keeping him your memory so
[1:11:19] it that is the evidential proof that
[1:11:23] he's not on your mind
[1:11:25] and that's between you and him okay and
[1:11:32] then it's foot-washing I have given you
[1:11:36] an example do as I have done to you
[1:11:40] direct specific commandments of the Lord
[1:11:45] which most of you that are under my
[1:11:50] voice do not do so you are headed to
[1:11:58] divine judgment because he said I will
[1:12:03] not judge you but my word will judge you
[1:12:07] so I'm not preaching to you this morning
[1:12:11] that don't take communion and foot
[1:12:14] washing you're not in this conversation
[1:12:20] you're already out of the program you do
[1:12:27] all you want to try to get in you want
[1:12:29] back in repent be baptized in the Lord
[1:12:33] Jesus Christ and they that love me keep
[1:12:37] my Commandments so you can wrap yourself
[1:12:42] in phony man-made religion you can put
[1:12:46] the title on it the message of the hour
[1:12:48] you can say that you believe God sent a
[1:12:52] prophet Satan believes the same thing
[1:12:56] okay now if you said well I couldn't
[1:12:59] come to communion because of culvert bye
[1:13:01] I'm talking about your heart you knows a
[1:13:05] lot of difference in wanting to be there
[1:13:08] and not being able to be there or having
[1:13:11] something better to do I'd rather stand
[1:13:15] on the unemployment line and take
[1:13:16] communion and go to heaven but anyway
[1:13:19] we're not preaching to you
[1:13:21] so why stay there let's move on I just
[1:13:25] want to make that clear I wanted to make
[1:13:28] it clear who were preaching to because
[1:13:31] we're preaching to the minority now
[1:13:33] right and he says he said he says that
[1:13:38] desire
[1:13:39] that's a serious thought you're ready
[1:13:41] for strong meat now you're ready to come
[1:13:45] into something he said you're ready to
[1:13:50] understand something that's deep and
[1:13:53] rich Oh we'll get into that directly
[1:13:59] it's the hidden since the foundations of
[1:14:04] the world
[1:14:07] so this elect group of people this
[1:14:11] mature group of people is now going to
[1:14:17] partake in something that's been hid
[1:14:21] from the foundation of the world he said
[1:14:26] now that you've come into this I am
[1:14:30] addressing this to you not to those
[1:14:34] who've just left Egypt not to those who
[1:14:39] are still in the journey but to those
[1:14:42] who are in the promised land that has
[1:14:47] received the promise so now work we're
[1:14:54] moving to a gospel let's do a specific
[1:15:00] elected class of people from the
[1:15:05] foundation of the world so it doesn't
[1:15:10] mean that that you can't come to that
[1:15:14] but in order to come to what we're
[1:15:17] talking about you've got to come out of
[1:15:19] Egypt
[1:15:21] you've got to mature you've got to keep
[1:15:26] his Commandments and then you're ready
[1:15:31] see her mom always told us that we make
[1:15:35] God a big dodi grandpa and he's not a
[1:15:39] big Dodie grandpa and so he really wants
[1:15:46] something for us he says how many's
[1:15:50] received the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:53] oh are you glad that you're not in the
[1:15:56] land over here now aren't you glad
[1:16:01] you're in the land over here now aren't
[1:16:05] you glad you're in this Holy Spirit land
[1:16:07] aren't you glad you're in Christ Jesus
[1:16:10] aren't you glad well I'd hate to be here
[1:16:16] and not be happy then you're like Lot's
[1:16:21] wife he said and you're that you're
[1:16:27] eating the early corn eating the strong
[1:16:32] things of God and got a clear
[1:16:35] understanding your spiritual mind is
[1:16:41] unmodeled up you know exactly who he is
[1:16:48] you know exactly what he is you know
[1:16:53] exactly where you're going you know
[1:16:57] exactly all about it you know and whom
[1:17:01] you have believed and are persuaded he's
[1:17:05] able to keep that which you've committed
[1:17:08] to him against the day oh that's the
[1:17:13] ones that Paul's talking to now Oh maaan
[1:17:19] praise God that's the ones because he
[1:17:24] said I'm teaching the same message that
[1:17:26] Paul taught remember what is Lady osya
[1:17:31] luke warm and the call the lady osya is
[1:17:37] I would that you wouldn't be lukewarm I
[1:17:40] would that you'd either be hot or cold
[1:17:43] because if you're lukewarm I'm going to
[1:17:46] spill the out of my mouth you say well
[1:17:49] why would he rather have you cold
[1:17:50] because you're cold he can correct you
[1:17:53] it could be good he can convict you he
[1:17:57] can deal with you and talk to you but
[1:18:00] when you're lukewarm you're in the
[1:18:04] bondage
[1:18:05] reasoning how many just reasoned away
[1:18:09] everything I said about communion can't
[1:18:16] help you I'm sorry you've doomed
[1:18:21] yourself carry the picture of the pillar
[1:18:26] of fire around all you want claim
[1:18:29] Malachi 4:5 all you want claim
[1:18:32] revelations 10 7 all you want I'll tell
[1:18:35] you somebody else who believes it and
[1:18:37] knows it's true
[1:18:39] he's a fallen angel
[1:18:42] his name's Lucifer this is about Jesus
[1:18:48] Christ who is the word it is about the
[1:18:54] person of Jesus Christ and you and what
[1:19:01] he is to you and what you are to him
[1:19:08] this is about a supernatural
[1:19:14] relationship it's about a human being
[1:19:17] being in a supernatural relationship
[1:19:22] with a supernatural God living in a
[1:19:28] carnal state being in a supernatural
[1:19:33] relationship and talking to a
[1:19:35] supernatural being
[1:19:38] sokka Moses with the faith that he had
[1:19:43] couldn't accomplish anything till he
[1:19:46] came into the presence of that burning
[1:19:50] bush and he meant a God that could talk
[1:19:56] back to him now if you haven't got there
[1:20:04] you're on the journey there okay
[1:20:12] and the Holy Spirit is going to continue
[1:20:16] to lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:20:20] and righteousness I will not leave you
[1:20:24] comfortless but I will come again and I
[1:20:27] will guide you and teach you and reveal
[1:20:30] to you and bring to your remembrance at
[1:20:33] all the things that I have taught you so
[1:20:38] I will continue to work with you and
[1:20:41] teach you and grow you into maturity but
[1:20:46] somewhere now in the time that we're
[1:20:52] living there must be seeds that are
[1:20:56] coming to maturity so we're in the
[1:21:03] harvest time we're in the sunlight so we
[1:21:10] need to let the shade clouds of the
[1:21:12] world blow over and come back into that
[1:21:17] sunlight and begin to mature alright so
[1:21:24] we see that so so what we're talking
[1:21:29] right now is we're talking to you to the
[1:21:33] people now if there's things that are
[1:21:37] wrong with your life well well we
[1:21:40] understand that but so now this is what
[1:21:42] we're talking about we're just laying
[1:21:44] some foundations this morning and
[1:21:47] teaching and just laying it out there so
[1:21:50] that our understanding will be
[1:21:53] enlightened because I believe there's
[1:21:57] higher ground but the week that we just
[1:22:00] don't want to keep sitting around going
[1:22:02] higher ground higher ground higher
[1:22:04] ground I want higher ground Lord lift me
[1:22:06] up to higher ground well he's the kind
[1:22:09] of God that says this is higher ground
[1:22:14] bring them back to this mountain so he
[1:22:19] said he says now he has predestinated us
[1:22:24] unto
[1:22:25] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:22:31] himself according as his for his own
[1:22:37] good pleasure of his will according to
[1:22:41] the good pleasure of his will so if he
[1:22:46] has predestinated us to adoption of his
[1:22:53] will for his good pleasure now I'm
[1:22:59] moving toward something this is class
[1:23:01] this morning I'm doing pretty good
[1:23:04] staying calm but if I get going going
[1:23:12] good I hope I'm reading slow enough for
[1:23:14] the interpreters you can just paraphrase
[1:23:18] the best to get the idea
[1:23:20] Oh much pleasure whose pleasure was it
[1:23:27] whose goodness his own his own good
[1:23:33] pleasure his own will now what is
[1:23:38] adoption now let me get this now I don't
[1:23:45] know whether I have time to get through
[1:23:48] this but I'll hit it then if there's a
[1:23:52] question you can ask me a little later
[1:23:56] on something a message so this is where
[1:23:58] we're picking up now listen your
[1:24:00] adoption is not your birth okay being
[1:24:07] filled with the Holy Ghost is not your
[1:24:11] adoption could that's the tutor that
[1:24:16] leads you to your adoption this message
[1:24:20] was the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit
[1:24:27] comes and do these thing and any man to
[1:24:31] say it's Bailes about it will not be
[1:24:33] forgiven in this life or the life to
[1:24:36] come there's some very bold
[1:24:39] voices out there today that are going to
[1:24:41] come to the realization of that
[1:24:43] scripture and but on their defense
[1:24:52] you say you defense a critic
[1:24:56] yeah I'll defend the critic because
[1:25:00] they've got a point and their point is
[1:25:05] that we don't know our Bible now my
[1:25:14] point is is they know their Bible but
[1:25:18] they don't have a revelation of it if I
[1:25:26] want to lay this down pretty strong this
[1:25:28] morning in the teaching but you can't
[1:25:33] rely on brother Branham to get you there
[1:25:43] okay you don't even want to start the
[1:25:46] question how much I believe this message
[1:25:52] it was the tutor it was teaching us it
[1:26:01] wasn't the new birth
[1:26:02] it wasn't the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:05] there's many many good Christian people
[1:26:09] who have the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:14] and that he will be there because they
[1:26:21] have walked in all the light that they
[1:26:26] were given and they are my brothers
[1:26:37] you're not going to create some elitist
[1:26:40] message club and present some sort of
[1:26:45] membership card to st. Peter at the gate
[1:26:48] I hope that analogy doesn't offend you
[1:26:56] like Daniel Henry you know he thought he
[1:27:00] had it pretty sewed up till he got into
[1:27:03] the presence of the Lord so we we've
[1:27:12] started this great journey and so now we
[1:27:20] we understand that we understand that
[1:27:26] we've been adopted or predestinated so
[1:27:31] let's go he says he says your adoption
[1:27:35] your adoption is not your birth it is
[1:27:40] not the baptism of the Holy Spirit your
[1:27:43] adoption is your placing right when you
[1:27:51] were born again John 1:7 I believe when
[1:27:55] you were born of the Spirit of God we
[1:27:58] are sons of God but we were
[1:28:02] predestinated now here's what I'm trying
[1:28:06] to get to you for the the sons of the
[1:28:11] last day and that always means daughters
[1:28:19] use you see to see what I'm trying to
[1:28:25] get to you to see to see we are
[1:28:32] predestinated unto adoption so we are
[1:28:38] predestinated unto placing token back
[1:28:47] quote so we've been tutored in the
[1:28:49] message
[1:28:51] by the messenger right which is the
[1:28:59] former rain he said what people thought
[1:29:04] was the latter rain just became an
[1:29:08] unrighteous partaking of the gifts of
[1:29:11] the Holy Spirit right
[1:29:15] so what everybody did everybody saw in
[1:29:18] the Bible and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:29:20] move to this and this morning I hope I
[1:29:23] just say it in a good spirit but
[1:29:26] everybody started doing their own thing
[1:29:32] so they were doing good works but he
[1:29:36] said I never knew you
[1:29:42] that's like going on the job and and you
[1:29:46] go on the job and you have somebody
[1:29:48] working and you get there and and you
[1:29:51] said wait a minute I thought I I told
[1:29:58] you to move these bricks from here to
[1:30:01] there and they said oh but I look at
[1:30:04] this I built this fence and I dug a
[1:30:08] swimming pool you know and they've got a
[1:30:14] whole litany of works works works works
[1:30:21] works like a mule doesn't know his daddy
[1:30:28] doesn't know his mama
[1:30:31] it just works works works works has no
[1:30:36] idea that they've been predestinated to
[1:30:43] a place okay predestinate it to a place
[1:30:53] we're predestinated to placing that's
[1:30:59] what this ages in elected chosen people
[1:31:03] that were going to be placed according
[1:31:08] to his good pleasure and his good will
[1:31:12] wasn't a bunch of preachers preaching a
[1:31:17] clone model that everybody should
[1:31:20] conform to I think I'm just gonna get to
[1:31:33] my point in and I have a lot of such
[1:31:37] other wonderful quotes to read but this
[1:31:41] took - to show you how important this
[1:31:49] placing is and and the the if I could
[1:31:56] say this the the the the must of it okay
[1:32:07] see we've got everything now gays two
[1:32:11] options
[1:32:12] I like Aaron one time to preach a
[1:32:17] message about choices and one of the
[1:32:22] points he brought out there's like a
[1:32:24] hundred and fifty five choices of water
[1:32:31] water is h2o you understand it's
[1:32:38] packaged a hundred and fifty five
[1:32:42] different ways so that you have to have
[1:32:46] a choice therefore man becomes occupied
[1:32:51] with choice choice is a form of
[1:32:55] reasoning choice creates reasoning
[1:33:10] we don't have a choice we're trying to
[1:33:14] do away with choice this Bible study
[1:33:19] this morning
[1:33:20] are we ready we ready for strong meat
[1:33:21] right we want to go on so this is what
[1:33:24] I'm saying is we've got to the place
[1:33:27] where everything's an option I will if I
[1:33:33] can I don't have to I'm okay my name's
[1:33:38] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:33:41] okay nothing can put it in nothing can
[1:33:43] take it out but there's another part of
[1:33:47] that you know and that is you won't lose
[1:33:52] it but your works will be tried by fire
[1:33:59] and it might you eat I just don't want
[1:34:01] to even go into that subject but let's
[1:34:03] let's just listen and I want to read
[1:34:05] this because I want you to understand
[1:34:08] that what we're talking about is not an
[1:34:13] option unless you make this pursuit you
[1:34:21] will not obtain the maturity and the
[1:34:27] perfection that we need for the rapture
[1:34:33] we're trying to take off the false
[1:34:38] covering of religion and realize that
[1:34:44] God's Word is an absolute truth is not a
[1:34:54] process of human reasoning truth is not
[1:35:01] a forum of thinking we don't decide
[1:35:09] truth truth is eternal truth was there
[1:35:15] before we were there
[1:35:17] we want to come in to the truth because
[1:35:23] the truth is what sets is free it sets
[1:35:28] us free from hell death and the grave
[1:35:32] without truth you are going to have hell
[1:35:36] death and the grave that means you're
[1:35:45] going to be punished you're going to die
[1:35:49] and you're going to be eternally
[1:35:52] separated from God so listen to this
[1:35:56] statement because I want to lay this
[1:35:59] deep in our hearts that where we're
[1:36:01] going is not an option it's something
[1:36:07] that we must take heed of so we've asked
[1:36:11] the questions what are we building we
[1:36:16] need to get back to work
[1:36:19] brother Randy put it we need to walk in
[1:36:22] the vision he says now there's where the
[1:36:27] church is failing today is on that walk
[1:36:32] do you know that even your own behavior
[1:36:37] can knock somebody else out of getting
[1:36:41] healed your misbehavior of unconfessed
[1:36:49] sins of you believers can cause this
[1:36:56] church to bitterly fail and at the Day
[1:37:01] of Judgment you will be responsible for
[1:37:05] every bit of it oh you say now wait a
[1:37:11] minute brother branham well that's the
[1:37:14] truth think of it all right so we're
[1:37:23] talking about going beyond seed faith
[1:37:30] we've all rested on seed faith seed
[1:37:33] think we got the seed we got the seed we
[1:37:36] got the seed we got the seed oK you've
[1:37:38] got the seed now that seed is
[1:37:42] predestinated for a placing and if you
[1:37:46] don't make that placing you're out of
[1:37:48] place and in order therefore to be a
[1:37:51] rapture I should have found the quote
[1:37:55] every believer must be in their place so
[1:38:04] this is what we're moving to I'm going
[1:38:07] to read just a few more statements and
[1:38:10] then draw my closing argument I always
[1:38:15] wanted to say that because somebody the
[1:38:17] other day asked me if I was had my bar
[1:38:20] license if I was a lawyer really ripped
[1:38:24] me up and down over the coals but anyway
[1:38:30] I won't go into that but it's quite the
[1:38:32] story he said go we talking about art
[1:38:42] our conduct he says now he says now we
[1:38:49] find out now this is worth we're talking
[1:38:52] to now listen because Moses is a type
[1:38:56] right he was a type of Christ and then
[1:39:00] the believers come down and him in the
[1:39:02] Exodus that Moses was in so we're in an
[1:39:06] exodus so we understand he says now this
[1:39:11] is the kind of faith that we're talking
[1:39:13] about mature faith now we find out that
[1:39:16] Moses had faith Moses his faith led him
[1:39:21] to watch what would be not what was
[1:39:30] there's two faiths in this message those
[1:39:35] that keep looking back at what the
[1:39:39] messenger was what he did what
[1:39:43] indicated what he taught okay
[1:39:49] and they keep pointing back to it as
[1:39:53] being the source of salvation there's
[1:39:58] only one place that God meets the
[1:40:02] believer that's under the shed blood of
[1:40:04] Jesus Christ it's the word he is the
[1:40:12] word the word is a thought expressed God
[1:40:16] only meets the believer in his thoughts
[1:40:22] not our collective thought not our
[1:40:26] collective reasoning not our collective
[1:40:29] doctrine not our patting one another on
[1:40:32] the back god only meets us in him so not
[1:40:44] what was looking at tomorrow instead of
[1:40:48] today looking at the promise instead of
[1:40:52] the glamour looking at the people
[1:40:55] instead of the organization see God did
[1:40:59] that so he's talking about this believer
[1:41:02] this mature believer that's living in
[1:41:09] the promise under the presence of the
[1:41:12] Holy Spirit is looking to tomorrow it's
[1:41:19] looking to what's ahead it's looking
[1:41:24] remember this message was prophecy it
[1:41:32] was preaching what was it was pointing
[1:41:37] out the conditions surrounding the
[1:41:42] prophecy but the message in the prophecy
[1:41:47] was a prophecy about an elect lady and
[1:41:53] what she would be again
[1:41:56] bye-bye and what she would be and that
[1:42:02] there would be a people that would hear
[1:42:06] that message and be drawn by
[1:42:10] predestination to the adoption or
[1:42:15] placing so don't get caught up just
[1:42:21] living this life thinking that there's
[1:42:26] not a participation of prophecy in your
[1:42:31] life see God did that so he talks about
[1:42:38] lot lots can see the glamour and
[1:42:42] prosperity down in Sodom lot can see the
[1:42:48] possibilities of money lot to see the
[1:42:51] possibilities when he looked over Sodom
[1:42:56] so he saw those possibilities and he was
[1:42:59] drawn to Sodom he knew Lee was a nephew
[1:43:06] of Abraham he knew he knew business he
[1:43:09] knew he was intelligent he watched
[1:43:14] Abraham prosper he knew the secrets of
[1:43:18] success so he was drawn to the Sodom so
[1:43:24] he went down he said he said Lots
[1:43:28] intellect led him to see the blessings
[1:43:31] of glamour but his faith was so
[1:43:34] paralyzed he didn't see the fire that
[1:43:43] was going to destroy that sort of life
[1:43:49] and that's the way that people are today
[1:43:53] they see the possibilities of providing
[1:43:56] to a great organization they see the
[1:43:59] possibility to have this social standing
[1:44:01] with the people of the city but they
[1:44:03] don't see the possible as they don't see
[1:44:06] their faith is paralyzed
[1:44:10] praise God I want to unparallel
[1:44:23] and that's what happens the world
[1:44:29] paralyzes your faith if you love the
[1:44:33] world and the things of the world
[1:44:36] you understand John says the love of God
[1:44:39] is not in you it's not that you don't
[1:44:42] believe in God it's not that you don't
[1:44:44] love God but you don't love the purpose
[1:44:48] of the good pleasure of his will that's
[1:44:56] what you're not in love with that I'm
[1:45:01] predestinated to adoption for the good
[1:45:05] pleasure of his will you're not in love
[1:45:08] with placing you're not in love with
[1:45:12] adoption because that's individual and
[1:45:19] everybody wants to do be everybody else
[1:45:29] you know I want to be this I want to be
[1:45:33] that you only know half the story you
[1:45:39] see me here preaching but you might
[1:45:40] think I'm okay but you just don't see
[1:45:42] this big black bean I have to deal with
[1:45:47] oh yeah the flesh Ward's against the
[1:45:51] spirit and the spirit against God the
[1:45:53] carnal mind is enmity with God life is a
[1:45:58] constant warfare but we will he said the
[1:46:04] faith it is paralyzed he says now honest
[1:46:10] yet honest been like lot settle down and
[1:46:13] Sodom knowing that it's wrong see what
[1:46:18] do you do when they do that
[1:46:23] Oh Lord you know it's wrong to stay out
[1:46:29] of church you know it's wrong to work on
[1:46:32] Sunday you know it's wrong not to take
[1:46:35] communion you know it's wrong to listen
[1:46:37] you know it's wrong you know it's wrong
[1:46:38] you know what's wrong you see so you're
[1:46:44] not going to come in to adoption and
[1:46:50] placing until you come into obedience
[1:46:58] all them that are in Christ Jesus live
[1:47:01] godly and I'm not talking about a legal
[1:47:08] standpoint I'm talking about maturity
[1:47:13] I'm talking about love I'm talking about
[1:47:17] Union I'm talking about fellowship I'm
[1:47:23] so glad that I have a place I didn't lay
[1:47:27] my hat in an hour like this I love those
[1:47:35] words I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:47:38] you but I'll be with you even in you
[1:47:41] till the end I love that if I started to
[1:47:45] work than you I'll finish until the end
[1:47:47] hallelujah but what I want to know what
[1:47:51] is that work let me say this you
[1:48:01] couldn't be placed you couldn't be
[1:48:06] positioned until the seals were opened
[1:48:18] he said knowing is wrong seat what do
[1:48:23] they do when they do that they paralyze
[1:48:27] the little faith that they did have it
[1:48:31] can't work you understand the faith that
[1:48:39] God wanted Moses to have the faith he
[1:48:45] wanted to have when he went to that
[1:48:47] burning bush but they spoke back to him
[1:48:54] and told him all the power that he had
[1:48:58] didn't we just ask that question how
[1:49:00] many have the Holy Spirit if you have
[1:49:02] the Holy Spirit you've been in dude with
[1:49:05] power from on high
[1:49:07] in other words you have been provided
[1:49:10] with the power to bring every promise in
[1:49:17] the Bible to pass but Moses got in a
[1:49:27] situation and it paralyzed his faith
[1:49:33] so God wanted to tell them Moses you're
[1:49:40] called you're elected to do this I want
[1:49:44] to take it for me doing it to you doing
[1:49:50] it
[1:49:53] what I am I want you to be the works
[1:49:59] that I do shall you do also no don't go
[1:50:09] beatin yourselves down this morning it's
[1:50:13] a promise I loved the way Randy thought
[1:50:19] I thought that was so inspired
[1:50:21] he said if Satan condemns you you shout
[1:50:24] the victory praise God one more thing
[1:50:26] I'm going to overcome Thank You Satan
[1:50:29] for revealing that to me now Moses give
[1:50:40] way to that and it's set his faith
[1:50:45] paralyzed now listen to this now Moses
[1:50:53] gave way to that another word he didn't
[1:50:55] let the glamour of the world paralyze
[1:50:58] his faith he counted the reproach of
[1:51:02] Christ greater than the wealth of Egypt
[1:51:07] so as Moses gave away to that and he
[1:51:12] said his faith and he said his faith
[1:51:17] paralyzed the world either your faith
[1:51:23] will paralyze glamour or either glamour
[1:51:29] will paralyze your faith now you have to
[1:51:34] take on you've got to take it on
[1:51:43] something's paralyzing our faith so
[1:51:51] that's the first thing we got to do take
[1:51:55] on the world
[1:51:56] what do we call that applying the token
[1:52:04] once the token was applied and the death
[1:52:09] angel of sin had no more effect on them
[1:52:12] they could start the journey they can
[1:52:19] start to being tutored they can start to
[1:52:22] be taught but if you come to church and
[1:52:25] every summon condemns you the Lord Jesus
[1:52:35] Christ could appear in in an abolition
[1:52:40] some part of spiritual form and tell you
[1:52:43] you're going to heaven and that thing
[1:52:46] would still bother you does the Holy
[1:52:51] Spirit convict you of sin that's why
[1:52:57] it's given to the overcomer so let's
[1:53:03] move beyond condemning purpose in your
[1:53:07] heart I'm gonna work on this I'm gonna
[1:53:10] overcome this but as I am overcoming
[1:53:14] this I'm going to walk on in Christ I'm
[1:53:17] going to follow the Holy Spirit because
[1:53:19] if I don't follow the spirit it's going
[1:53:21] to go on and leave me behind and move on
[1:53:25] to somebody else that's the say of the
[1:53:27] Lord
[1:53:31] it'll be taken from one and given to
[1:53:35] another so we don't go by our senses you
[1:53:42] like to say it's because it's a
[1:53:44] denomination something big well we've
[1:53:47] got more members nearly than any Church
[1:53:51] in the world but there's only one real
[1:53:54] Church and you don't join it you're born
[1:54:00] into it you understand so I'm talking
[1:54:04] about a church that's not this church
[1:54:07] we're talking about a mystical body of
[1:54:10] Christ that is made up of members and
[1:54:16] ticular Paul said summon I summon ear
[1:54:24] some more cumberly than others
[1:54:29] everybody's got their part and they've
[1:54:34] got to be placed and positioned in that
[1:54:37] part and there's only one place you get
[1:54:40] that Commission and have the faith your
[1:54:49] see faith anointed in that in the
[1:54:53] presence of the pillar of fire in the
[1:54:58] presence of Almighty God in the Shekinah
[1:55:01] glory behind the veil I don't know how
[1:55:05] many other biblical descriptions to it
[1:55:07] but it's where God speaks back and you
[1:55:13] quit doing the talking and you hear him
[1:55:20] and what is he gonna say I've already
[1:55:24] told you I've already collected you
[1:55:26] please go do this let me place you in
[1:55:36] other words your per your predestinated
[1:55:39] to a spot he says you're born into it
[1:55:46] and you're born in it the living God
[1:55:50] works himself through you and makes
[1:55:56] himself known
[1:55:58] there's where God dwells in his church
[1:56:06] wait a minute
[1:56:08] you mean God is resident somewhere he's
[1:56:14] not just at heaven he's actually
[1:56:17] resident now if if you knew your Bibles
[1:56:23] automatically that's Scripture in a
[1:56:26] phone in your mind you are the temples
[1:56:28] of the Living God now I don't want to
[1:56:35] sound like I don't believe this message
[1:56:37] but it would be nice if we spent as much
[1:56:40] time reading our Bible as we did
[1:56:42] listening to tapes and you say why
[1:56:44] because the guy on the tape said pray
[1:56:47] and read your Bible and obedience is
[1:56:52] better than sacrifice and then what
[1:56:55] would happen is you would become
[1:56:58] knowledgeable in the common ground of
[1:57:02] the Bible then you could meet somebody
[1:57:08] on the common ground of the Bible and
[1:57:11] I'll meet any man on the common ground
[1:57:15] of the Bible and show the infallible
[1:57:19] truth of this message in the scriptures
[1:57:29] because it was a predestinated word of
[1:57:32] god and god interpreted his word by
[1:57:35] bringing it the past just like every
[1:57:38] prophecy in the Old Testament was
[1:57:41] manifested in Jesus Christ and He
[1:57:43] fulfilled every one in the flash but
[1:57:53] only those that were predestinated to
[1:57:56] adoption saw it do you think maybe we
[1:58:02] ought to shake ourselves and let's get
[1:58:04] back with the program a church that does
[1:58:07] not have the supernatural will bitterly
[1:58:10] fail I'm still being nice right that's
[1:58:25] where God dwells in his church God goes
[1:58:29] to church every day just lives in church
[1:58:34] he lives in you you're his church you
[1:58:39] are his church you're the tabernacle
[1:58:43] about God dwells in you are the Church
[1:58:47] of the Living God yourself and if the
[1:58:56] Living God lives in his living being
[1:59:01] then your actions is of God if you it
[1:59:07] isn't then God isn't there he wouldn't
[1:59:11] make you act like that he says in the
[1:59:14] word here his blueprint don't do it and
[1:59:18] you go do it see that's wrong when you
[1:59:23] deny it
[1:59:24] it shows the life isn't even in you see
[1:59:27] that's right so we're talking about a
[1:59:33] life so we're talking about that we have
[1:59:37] there's good work
[1:59:39] right so you are his workmanship is that
[1:59:43] right created in Christ Jesus which was
[1:59:49] you were created in the word right in
[1:59:53] the beginning was the word the Word was
[1:59:58] made flesh that was Christ Jesus Christ
[2:00:01] Jesus was the thoughts of God expressed
[2:00:04] all that God was he poured into Christ
[2:00:06] all that Christ is he poured in the
[2:00:08] church so when you were created in
[2:00:10] Christ he was the word nothing that is
[2:00:14] that is everything that is was created
[2:00:17] by him so you were created in there in
[2:00:20] the beginning is that right
[2:00:26] you were his workmanship created in
[2:00:32] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[2:00:37] before ordained that you should walk in
[2:00:41] them so clearly you've got to come into
[2:00:45] the contact with the works which you
[2:00:50] were four ordained to walk in now I'm
[2:00:59] getting to what we're teaching okay you
[2:01:06] individually and personally we're giving
[2:01:11] a work list that you were predestinated
[2:01:19] to be placed to do nothing to do with
[2:01:28] your religion nothing to do with your
[2:01:31] faith nothing to do with the seed
[2:01:34] nothing to do with your name being
[2:01:36] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:01:40] moving beyond seed faith
[2:01:45] to where he was and he said I do nothing
[2:01:53] unless the father reveals it to me so we
[2:02:01] know that we're for Dane so we've got to
[2:02:04] come in contact with that burning bush
[2:02:09] we've tried to come in contact with the
[2:02:14] works now not works and I'm going to
[2:02:19] explain the difference here in a moment
[2:02:23] and I'll probably fit some critics on
[2:02:27] this but I finally decided if you don't
[2:02:30] go through the hall of critics you're
[2:02:31] not going to go to the Hall of Fame so
[2:02:35] you've got to come in contact with the
[2:02:37] works that you're foreordained
[2:02:40] to okay of fire in your heart for that
[2:02:45] deeper relationship now here's where I
[2:02:51] think in my heart where we begin to miss
[2:02:58] it it's that oneness that comes a unity
[2:03:07] that he's walking with you okay that
[2:03:12] what God got upset with Moses about
[2:03:17] because Moses doubted the unity he had
[2:03:21] with God that what Satan wants to
[2:03:26] abolish but here's what's happened
[2:03:38] so as Christians it began to be taught
[2:03:52] to us that Jesus was the second person
[2:03:58] of the Trinity so that he was a
[2:04:03] pre-existing deity being okay that's not
[2:04:10] true
[2:04:11] Jesus was a man now don't go jumping in
[2:04:17] the lake and don't say that I don't
[2:04:19] believe in the deity of Jesus Christ I
[2:04:21] believe in the deity of Jesus Christ
[2:04:24] because the fullness of the Godhead
[2:04:26] bodily dwelt in him and that's what he
[2:04:32] prayed father may they be one as we are
[2:04:36] one
[2:04:39] so they taught that Jesus was the second
[2:04:45] person of the Trinity so he had a
[2:04:48] supernatural pre-existing power and he
[2:04:58] just came down out of heaven with the
[2:05:00] power but the Bible said he learned
[2:05:05] obedience by the things he suffered so
[2:05:08] we've learned obedience by the themes
[2:05:11] that we've suffered but this is what's
[2:05:16] happened they placed Jesus in some sort
[2:05:23] of on an unattainable place and what
[2:05:35] we've fallen into if we fallen in to try
[2:05:43] to reproduce or copy
[2:05:50] the Lord Jesus so we were copying him he
[2:06:04] we just we look we see what he did and
[2:06:08] we tried to copy it we try to we try to
[2:06:18] look and see that God gave the Lord
[2:06:23] Jesus a work to do
[2:06:26] and now we try to follow after that work
[2:06:31] I know this is going to be kind of just
[2:06:34] down a tight line but I hope that you
[2:06:37] couldn't see it so what we do is we sit
[2:06:40] there and we look back and we say he did
[2:06:46] this he did that he did this we wear
[2:06:52] little bracelets and says what would
[2:06:53] Jesus do so now we continue to look back
[2:07:00] and we're trying to copy copy copy and
[2:07:10] we think that we'll be judged by how
[2:07:16] good we copy and how good we follow and
[2:07:24] now that becomes the measure of
[2:07:28] Christianity but he said I'm going to
[2:07:34] talk to you about the mystery if we go
[2:07:39] back and read that in Ephesians and he
[2:07:47] says according to have the foundation in
[2:07:51] himself the pleasure and then that we
[2:07:58] might know the mystery of his will
[2:08:03] now this is what I hope that we can grow
[2:08:07] to this maturity we were in his mind in
[2:08:12] the beginning how many I believe that he
[2:08:17] knew you in the beginning you were
[2:08:20] predestinated - you were predestinated -
[2:08:27] good works that you should walk in them
[2:08:31] so he had in himself you so you yourself
[2:08:40] are a creation created in Christ Jesus
[2:08:53] you are a creation with a predestinated
[2:09:00] place for you to be so it's not that
[2:09:07] you're copying somebody else it's not
[2:09:10] that you're following the works that he
[2:09:13] performed but you've come into the Union
[2:09:19] and the relationship to manifest what he
[2:09:23] predestinated you to manifest it won't
[2:09:30] be a different manifestation than the
[2:09:32] word because all of that Christ was he
[2:09:37] poured into the body okay like the great
[2:09:43] conductor in his mind in the beginning
[2:09:48] he had a place for you
[2:09:51] he had an instrument that he wanted you
[2:09:56] to play he had a sheet music that he
[2:10:02] wanted you to read and all he wanted you
[2:10:06] to do is not copy the bass player not
[2:10:10] copy the drummer not one to play the
[2:10:14] clarinet
[2:10:15] instead of the trombone which some
[2:10:18] people believes the greatest instrument
[2:10:20] in the orchestra but if he wanted us to
[2:10:29] understand were predestinated to a place
[2:10:35] and he doesn't want us trying to copy
[2:10:39] and make a clone Christianity he wants
[2:10:43] us to find and take on the
[2:10:45] responsibility of the predestinated
[2:10:48] mystery that we are in other words you
[2:10:54] are thus saith the Lord
[2:10:57] [Music]
[2:11:01] you're the sayeth the Lord if he thought
[2:11:07] it and he spoke it it cannot fail to
[2:11:12] come to pass he has this place now the
[2:11:18] mature believer realizes his
[2:11:23] relationship is not looking back and
[2:11:26] copying or trying to reproduce or try to
[2:11:34] do the same thing his relationship is is
[2:11:39] that he had his place in Christ Jesus
[2:11:43] that it's personal and he's not ashamed
[2:11:50] to take it no matter what it is but his
[2:11:57] maturity brings him on the personal
[2:12:01] pursuit of what the predestinated will
[2:12:07] of God was for his life in the beginning
[2:12:14] it isn't this copycat
[2:12:24] lack of revelation lack of what you are
[2:12:29] religion and then you're going to be
[2:12:32] judged by your works you're going to be
[2:12:34] judged by your position you're going to
[2:12:41] be judged by whether it meant so much to
[2:12:43] you to be where he wanted you so nobody
[2:12:53] wanted that responsibility so they let
[2:12:56] nipple lady anism come in and provide a
[2:13:02] list of qualifications for heaven a list
[2:13:06] of actions a list of good works and many
[2:13:14] will come in that day and say Lord Lord
[2:13:17] we did all these things and he's going
[2:13:21] to look at the spot that you were
[2:13:26] supposed to be occupying and he said I
[2:13:30] never knew you in other words I knew
[2:13:35] what I predestinated I knew what I fore
[2:13:40] ordained because I predestinated them
[2:13:44] unto adoption I predestinated him unto
[2:13:48] placing and you never consider that I
[2:13:56] had a personal place for you you just
[2:14:00] listened to all the voices you just
[2:14:05] conformed to the world you just listened
[2:14:08] to everybody saying be like Jesus be
[2:14:10] like Jesus be like Jesus Jesus was the
[2:14:13] word Jesus was a man that kept every
[2:14:19] word of God and every place in position
[2:14:24] that God chose him to be until he
[2:14:28] actually became one with God
[2:14:30] because he was one with the thought of
[2:14:33] God
[2:14:36] he was no 2nd person he was all deity
[2:14:42] without sin yet all obedient man and
[2:14:49] that's what we're maturing into but we
[2:14:54] can't reach that place of maturity until
[2:14:58] we come in contact with the
[2:15:01] predestinated work that we were four
[2:15:05] ordained to do and there's only one
[2:15:10] place you can find that that's in a
[2:15:17] personal conference with him and if you
[2:15:25] don't believe you have that if you don't
[2:15:28] believe you have that place then you're
[2:15:32] not believing your foreordained and your
[2:15:34] names written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:15:35] and that's what brother Brin said how
[2:15:41] long will we slack when are we going to
[2:15:45] get to work not works when are we going
[2:15:51] to get to our assigned job that's what I
[2:15:58] want to do that's what you wanted it
[2:16:02] that's what we want to do in him we want
[2:16:06] to come to the realization that the
[2:16:10] seals have been opened we couldn't come
[2:16:14] to this place until they were because we
[2:16:20] couldn't know who we were we could knew
[2:16:23] what we were called to we couldn't
[2:16:25] understand the oneness we had with him
[2:16:27] we couldn't understand that we are
[2:16:31] predestinated and foreordained to
[2:16:34] placing I would love to place you but I
[2:16:42] could only place you carnally
[2:16:44] you'd be my chauffeur you'd be my
[2:16:48] gardener
[2:16:49] you'd be my bodyguard you'd be my
[2:16:53] musician I can only do carnal placing
[2:17:02] because I'm a carnal being but the only
[2:17:08] one that can do supernatural placing is
[2:17:10] him and anything that does it other than
[2:17:16] him is religion it allows you to put a
[2:17:21] covering and hide your personal adoption
[2:17:30] but I feel we're headed every believer
[2:17:36] in here is headed to that predestinated
[2:17:40] placing by the Spirit of God because the
[2:17:45] sun is shining the shuck is pulling away
[2:17:50] the world's pulling away and we're
[2:17:54] sitting in the presence of his glorious
[2:17:59] revealed word and I I just am so
[2:18:06] thrilled and I can hope that your
[2:18:09] Christianity can move into the present
[2:18:14] tense of His divine will for your life
[2:18:23] not a historical to-do list but a
[2:18:31] present tense commission to your life
[2:18:37] from the throne of God your part in the
[2:18:42] Great Commission go into all the world
[2:18:45] and preach the gospel to who all the
[2:18:49] world laying hands on the sick they
[2:18:54] shall recover
[2:18:55] taking up deadly things it
[2:18:57] shouldn't harm you each one of you has a
[2:19:00] place in that commission that we need to
[2:19:05] mature to that we can be about the
[2:19:11] Father's business and it's not an option
[2:19:19] it's not an option
[2:19:21] I would say it's a command but I want to
[2:19:28] say it more in general it's an invite to
[2:19:33] be partakers of divine nature and that
[2:19:39] was the spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[2:19:45] that he did the will the predestinated
[2:19:50] will of the Father for this cause I have
[2:19:54] come into the world you have a
[2:19:59] predestinated will for your life
[2:20:04] predestinated to an adoption and Anna
[2:20:07] placing in Christ Jesus you have works
[2:20:10] that have been for ordained that you
[2:20:14] should walk in we've got to make contact
[2:20:18] with that part of our election in order
[2:20:23] to meet the perfection of the rapture
