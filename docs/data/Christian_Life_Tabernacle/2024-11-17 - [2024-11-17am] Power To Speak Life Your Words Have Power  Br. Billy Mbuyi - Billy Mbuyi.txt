Power To Speak Life: Your Words Have Power

Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

service and we ask this things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen so good to be in the house of God this morning man we want to welcome all our visitors God bless you certainly happy to be gathered let's open our Bibles uh in in Mark chapter 11 a very familiar scripture reading uh let's start from verse 11 it says and Jesus entered into Jerusalem into the temple and where he had looked around about upon all things and now the evening tide was come and he went out unto Bethany with the 12 and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree a far of having leaves he came if happily he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of the Fig was not yet and Jesus said and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of the thereafter forever for his and and then he said and his disciple heard it and he came to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money money changers and the seeds of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man would carry any vessel through the temple and he thought saying unto them is it not written that my house shall be called of all the N of All Nation the House of Prayer but ye have made it a den of th thieves and the Scribe and the chief priest heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his Doctrine and when and when even when and even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the root and Peter calling to remembrance and say unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which th curseth is withered away now I I I I look at it and I astonish because I I wonder what they thought the effect would be you know what I mean here he is and he looked at it and he spoke and he walked away and now they coming in the morning they find the result of what was spoken and they're they astonished and says how could this be how look at it you know and and and so it's just amazing how and I want to just point that out that you'll find out through the Bible that that that has always been the human nature that that that we we we say or things would happen where the consequences of it are really not thought through when it's spoken and so so and and and and and Jesus answered and said unto him it says have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever ye shall whatsoever shall say unto this mountain be thou Mo removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye prayed believe ye receive them and ye shall have them and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have an heart against any that he said if he have an heart against any that the that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses Also let's turn our Bibles in Genesis chapter 1 we're just going to read the first three verses it says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moves upon the face of the water and God said let there be and there was light let there be light and there was light our gracious father we ask you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus we pray amen God bless you and have your seats I I want just for a moment this morning I I don't believe I'll be able to do this Justice or or just get through everything but we'll say what what is important and will stop when it's needful to stop I want to speak on uh the uh Power to Speak Life the power to speak life and as a theme uh I want this to be in the back of your mind when you say power to speak life I want you at the same time to think about your words have power your words have power and and before I could just go on I I I I just I was so uh inspired and moved by what brother benoa preached on Wednesday and I'll say if you are not here on Wednesday I really would admonish you to just go and listen to it and and and it's just it was such an encouragement to me um because often time if we are not careful we we make the church and coming to church just a habit you know we make it just oh I'm going to church it's Sunday it's Wednesday but we failed to recognize that within everything that we do that God has a plan God has a moment and a time that he wants to do things you know I I was even thinking about the pool of Bethesda you you think about it as the scripture will speak it that people will gather around it but it was only at the certain time that the angel will come and stir up the water it was those that jumped in when the water was still moving those are the ones that receive healing and when we come to church we we don't want to get caught up within anything else oh how did the song go and who did this who missed what and who did what and we want to come and be Solly focused on the word of God and not just to W with the mind to try to figure out to by theology to find out where is this person trying to go what are they trying to say no but trying to look at to look at it and listen with attentiveness with what God is about to say and to say God I want you to speak something for me I want to hear something that will be helpful for me I I didn't uh wake up in the morning take shower dress and do all of this just so I can come and see a man I have a need within my heart and I believe that as the word is being spoken that you can speak to my heart so we really want to take every moment say let me say this time is running out you you know the events and the things that are happening in the world if if we are if we really look at it closely it's showing us that time is running out and we know that the Gentiles don't have an allocated time to say that in such year everything will end that we know that all that we were waiting for is what's happening in Israel because baram will tell us that Israel is God's clock and and it's it's it's it's when God is done with the Gentile when the word will move over but it's in this time that the bride is supposed to get ready it's in this time that we are supposed to to be prepared and not get caught up in politics or the things that are happening but be focused on the word of God and my heart desire this morning is God I want your your word what you have been spoken what you have given us in this end time I want the word of God to have effect upon my life I I I don't want to be a believer that could just quot and you know we if we're not careful we become uh h h h uh very very eloquent in quoting everything that the prophet said someone will say we know exactly where they got it from and this one will say no I want the life that was in that word when it was spoken I want that life to come in me I want the things that I look at when I look in the mirror I want God to fix them I want the word of God to have such an effect upon my life that I will look at myself and see nothing else but Christ I want Christ to be manifested in my life I want my walk I want everything I I do I want the way I think the way I conduct myself I want it to be nothing but the word of God being manifested it's not time to get lazy it's not time to say we have more time there is no time we want to be focused on the word of God and and waiting and watching and waiting at at the 11th Hour knowing that at any moment it's going to come to pass now in this thought I was just want to say this I want to start by saying this to said we as Christians we are called to be the most to have the to have a positive outlook on life no matter what the circumstances are we we are called you know we we just went uh uh uh through a a a political season and and the election and all of those things and even as our pastor spoke about it not long ago uh uh people can look and say well we don't have a woman president I need to relax this is not time to relax this is not time to give in and and we and we can't be focused us on the world out there and look at all the negative things that are happening out there and constantly looking and and looking and seeing the demise that's out there we have been given the word of God and We Know by the word of God that those things were predicted to come and they will come to pass and and no president can change it no Constitution can change it not a country can change it the world is headed in the trajectory of Destruction and nothing is going to stop it why because men's thinking has gotten evil continually they have rejected the word of God and they are receiving what they have uh uh uh uh uh uh what you have left after you have rejected the word of God but we as Christians have to be and the prophet will say it over and over we have to be the most happiest person there is on the face of the Earth number one not only that we know what's happening out there not only everything that's happening out there has been revealed to us for us to know the mind of God not only that but also that God has promised to us has given us an opportunity in this end time to have an eyesight to be able to see the destraction out there and has also open up our eyes in the end time so that we may know who we really are God has called us and and and has given us the blessings are many blessings as Ephesians will say to come into this place our eyes are open to see the the deception that's happening out there to see everything and he's called us to be the member of the bride and his called us in the same time to be the elected bride and to be here to project his word and to be here to live the life of Christ in the end time I want to say this that is a blessing that is a blessing and it's not because of anything you've done it's the grace of God manifested in your life and we as Believers we are the one ones that are called to carry out the positive outlook under any circumstances we are not called to be in the mind like the world is we are not called to co to go out there and be uh uh uh uh in a situation of where where we feel like everything is falling apart the world is falling apart but we are not falling apart and I want to say this morning it doesn't matter whether you have a job or don't have a job it doesn't matter whether you are sick or not sick it doesn't matter what status you find yourself this morning you as a Believer has to be the most happiest person there is why because if God Gave You eternal life what can separate you from the love of God if you have eternal life what's more important than eternal life what's more is this this life that we live in is it the few years that we are allocated is it the the little money that we can make is it no those things are not important and they can never be put on the same scale as having eternal life to have eternal life is the most important thing for the believer to know that after this life is over after all the trials are over after all this world passes away that I will not pass away that should that alone should make you the most happiest person there is but one him will say it one place I'll just paraphrase it for the second time and and it will say if you were to to be uh to live a million years and be given all the money that there is but at the end of the million year you will die and go to hell but if you were to be given a choice that you can live for a million year a 100 or more whatever it is and live as poor as it could be but know that at the end of that 100 or million years you will go to heaven which one would you choose oh my brother my sister I will choose eternal life life every time why because I know this life is only temporary why because I know when this life is over I have another life waiting for me why because we don't live this life just so we can accumulate the goods we live this life for the life to come why because Christ the god the creator of Heaven and Earth has chosen for him to reveal himself to me and his PL and he sent his holy spirit to come and dwell within my own heart that has to be as the most happiest person we are and but one will say in the message respect it says in the message respect paragraph 29 and it will say this and said and I think and and it says and to think that the very one who created who wrote the Bible Paul is Isaiah Jeremiah and all the apostles and those precious Brethren wherever they are now whether they are wherever they are now very the very God that dealt with them to foresee things write it and write it and so forth and give them the gift of the Bible the prophecy and the speaking in tongue and the signs and wonders and so forth them same men wherever they are now we are going to be with them I I I want you to think about the sacrifices I want you to think about what those men went through I want you to think God has come in this end time and it's looked at us as 11 hours worker and it's given us the same wage as those that started before to think about Moses to think about Elijah to think about all this great men that we read on in the Bible the prophet is telling us that wherever they are tonight wherever they are this morning that we are going to be with them together and then it says the same God and then it says the same God with the same things it says it isn't a guess so anymore we know it now see it says because he's really present and we know it's so so we should not it says we shouldn't we not be the happiest people on Earth what more we long what more would we long so here is saying to just realize that these people have given up their lives and they've done so much for the gospel and they've done all their great and wonders and uh Moses opening up the right sea and and all the things that they've done it says that we as Believers of the end time we have not only received the same God but we have received the same reward but we'll all be at the same place Hallelujah and and and and and yeah we are sitting here we we think oh I I have a headache and I have this and I have need of that just think about how great of a blessing that we have received as a Believer to know that what that the same God not a different God the same spirit that was in John The Same Spirit that was in Paul that same spirit is in The Believer tonight that same spirit is in you this morning as you're sitting in the house of God that same God is here doing the same thing but bam says in the message we would see Jesus paragraph 15 it says and if the scripture says he is the same yesterday today and forever then we might it must be so or the scriptures is wrong and if the scripture is wrong where are we at it says what condition the whole world uh the whole world is tonight and remember remember Jesus said the scripture the scriptures cannot be broken so it says that comes from the mouth of the son of Christ the son of God the scripture cannot be broken and if the scripture says that is the same yesterday today and forever he has to be the same or the scriptures are wrong if the scripture says is the present help in times of need that same scripture has to be the same this morning if the scripture says I'll never leave you I'll be with you even in you until the end time he has to do that otherwise the scriptures are wrong so he's telling us is telling us here to know that as as Believers when we read the word of God we are called to come into the realization that we are not just reading the pages of the Bible or some written history about some God up in heaven but we are reading the word of the Living God and that same God is here with us this morning to bring his word a reality in your life so if he says I'll never leave you that God has not changed is here this morning if he says I'll be with you that same God has to be with you otherwise his word is not right and and and so he he that's the kind of God and that's the kind of attitude that he wants us to have it said let's just bring God to his word it says if God doesn't keep his word then it's not God and if it does keep his word we should be the happiest people on Earth how many believe God keeps his word this morning how many believe God is faithful this morning how many believe that we live by the word of God we are here because of the word of God we are here because God in the beginning he thought about as he spoke about us he promised that we will come to manifestation in the end time and he has nothing to do with anything that we have done we are here because he spoke the word and that word cannot return vo to him that word has to come into manifestation that's why we are sitting here this morning now we read in Genesis we read in Genesis who said in the beginning as the world was without form the spirit of God was moving upon the face of the Earth and it says that God said let there be light and there was light but when I will talk about this and and and and I won't read it I just want to illustrate so I don't I can save a little bit time and and it will speak about this in the power of transformation it will say yeah the the Earth was uh without form was void and and and it says and then the spirit of God was moving upon the face of the deep and and and and and the word and God will say leter be and and the word of God began to take what was out of form and forming into the Garden of Eden the word of God will take something that will was in chaos without form and void it will take and bring a shape out of it and the word of God when he spoke and let there be plant life they came plant life where it be uh uh Maron life and marine life came and let there be animals the animals came and all of that came by the spoken word of God and I want to say the principle I want to establish this morning is nothing can happen unless the word is spoken first and and I want you just to stay with me I said your word matters your word have power and I want to speak about the power of the word of the spoken word or the the power of the word and I want us to understand right from the get-go the prophet is trying to show us this so God in achieving the process of transformation the pattern of transformation of anything really lies within the spoken word and I want to say this if it outside of the spoken word it's only a temporary transformation I if you if you believe you think you can become a Christian outside of the spoken word of God you can become a Christian by your works and by everything you can do it will only be a temporary the only true transformation and the permanent transformation can only come by the word of God so it's only when God speaks and what say when God speaks he says there was nothing and because he spoke his word began to bring into creation what was not and that's why he will say at one place he said oh I wonder the sons of God it says isn't it strange that sons of God and that were made in the image of God and that were made to live by faith and that were made to live by the word of God and that were made to speak the things in existence that don't exist and and to look at things that exist and speak them out of existence I wonder I look at them and I see how they're conducting themselves and I wonder why we even take it to what a a pastor read when when the prophet came and and when we read in the scripture when we we read in that message the way of a true Prophet where he's looking and said these people were called to be a people of God they were called to live by the word of God they are blessed people how come they are trying to live up for the resources that have not given them instead of living by the resources that I've provided for them let me say this the believer's resource is the word of God your your resource is not your money it's not your house it's not your resource is the word of God if you ever want to bring a change about something speak the word of God St by the word of God if God Begin by the word we have to start by the word so he will speak the word so the word of God spoken to the Earth uh produced The Garden of Eden into existence the word of God spoken to the world began to bring the Sun and the Moon and and the plant life and the animal life and and all and everything else that there is and and and I want to say is the same voice of Resurrection we have heard it in the same time hallu the same voice remember the same voice of creation it's not a different the the the the the where we get caught up is well God said let there be what voice did you hear it was God speaking well and and the same God came in the same time and he's speaking and if he spoke in the creation in the beginning it came to pass the same God is speaking tonight is speaking in the end time so the same creation can come into existence but will say in the message who is God he says paragraph 17 it says now just like a child playing before the door and it was the Son of God the logos and I can see him there and he spake and said let her be it says and there was nothing but there was something but there was something happened and Adam turned there and began to W around this way this way the sun began to come into existence because he said said let her be there is the authority I I wonder if we really let that sink in that the word of God is the final Authority what what what the word speaks nothing can cross it nothing can come against it nothing can change it if God has spoken it's done if God has spoken you might as well go home and sleep if God has said has said something to you if God has spoken there's nothing in the world that can change that it says where did he make where did he make it from I don't know there was nothing to make it from but he believed his own word and there was light and I can see a piece fly off that it says it's a meteor and after a few million years or a 100 billion aund billions of years if you want to call it and it circled way out and I see standing there watching it and he fall down there and he stopped it after it f a few million years let it hang there in the Orit let it hang there in orbit and here goes another one fly off the Sun and he goes over there and hangs down and stops it there it says Jesus said that the so that the soer soed and if you will just St it in your heart and don't dip it and don't dig it out don't dig it up every time you see how it's getting along just it says just sink it in into your heart and settle it that's all walk right on God will take care of the rest of it it it's obligated I'm sorry I think I jump into another message yeah this is another message at that word I'm sorry it says do you know that everything that you see tonight is God's word materialized do you know that your body is God's word materialized do you you know them beings it says there there's God's word materialized do you know that the concrete is God spoken word materialized do you know that the whole earth is God's spoken word god spoken and said let be and he believed his own word and the Earth came into existence and if he didn't then there will come then it didn't come from it says well you Say it'll come off the sun well he says who spoke the son into existence everything is God's word the wordss were framed by the word of God the Bible says so God just spoke it and believed it his own word and that was it and that was it it says now God has spoken his word to us just believe him and watch it happen now now when he spoke something this is his word initially first he says and any other word that's contrary to to this is not God's word and has to come and he has to come from the Bible he says now this is his word to the nation now he sets it a he sets it uh after that he says in the church for some Apostle and and PE and and prophet and gift of healing and others maners and and if a prophet or a Seer would speak any word and it isn't according to the Bible here coming to the fashion or or contrary to the word of God it's not right it says but but this is God's word first now he pointing in the Bible what God uh what God spoke secondarily God it says that's secondarily his word to the individual so here we are and he's wanting us to get into the place as Believers where we we we come into an understanding that I I don't want to be built upon what the preacher is saying I don't want to be built upon what some thinking is and someone can come and and present A Way something in a way that you never heard it before that will not produce life but what he's wanting us to know is to understand that everything about us everything in the world everything is built upon the word of God and it's only what's built upon the word of God that will prosper now don't forget the process it couldn't happen unless God spoke it first So within our lives it it's important we get in the pattern or in the understanding that if I want my situation change I need to speak the word you know I was reading uh uh somewhere I forgot the the message you know but one says you know we'll be at home and and perhaps one of the little ones is sick and and said and when he seek what we do he said we come and my wife and I will lay hand on the baby and we begin to pray he said he said Heavenly Father you've given us this child and now they are sick and the condition here uh uh we don't know exactly what to do about it but you give us this child and you said if we ask it shall come to pass and then he says when we pray and finish that that's over and I'm like that's a principle we should be applying every day we we have family members we have children we have those that we need to see save and we have situations that we run in and and often time we run into a situation where we feel like somebody has to shake us all we have to raise our voices and scream before God can hear no it's given to you as a Son of God to speak the word so the word can go forward so God can utilize that that can change your situation he didn't say in screaming just speak it just be positive about it just know I'm speaking it's not a child is sick you start to go oh my goodness is going to die and he about to die and the last time I heard this happen to another child that died oh they're about to die oh God oh God no fear will not bring anything in other words fear will cause death to come in but what you need is a positive attitude what you is is the faith to cast out the devil you get fir from work oh God I don't know how I'm going to f the same God Who provided the first job the same God will provide another job you just walk out you say the lord giveth the Lord takes away blessed be his name he said the just shall live by faith he says I never seen a righteous B bread I'll go forward and watch the word come to pass oh we we get so filled with negativity we we let our flesh come in the enemy jumps in and every time there's a circumstance and the enemy works by the way of Flesh and causes us to speak so much negative and to speak so much confession of the devil we speak the devil's language and we wonder how that happened let me say this if something happen watch somewhere you must have spoken it you must by your mouth allow it to come you must have confess that somewh oh I'm not the good of a Christian you know every time I try I keep failing let me say this if you are a real believer you might might as well get used to failing I'm saying that you might as well get used to failing but your failure should not be the stopping point you must stand up and say it doesn't matter how many times I fail my God is able to make me a real [Applause] believer where is your word what are you speaking what are you speaking now I I was thinking about this and we'll get a little deeper into this and I'll get to my subject the the I was thinking about this the scripture will speak about that I was even fellowshipping with brother Paul about this I I think it was read throughout the meetings and I thought it was so wonderful about the spies yeah they are God sends them to Moses sends them to go in the Promised Land and to go and and and watch go and spy out the land and look at the land what the requirement was I want you to go look at it and tell me is it what God said it was going to be or not and then he says after you do that I want you to examine the inhabitant of the land and tell us what you think about them whether they be weak or strong or whatever just tell us so yeah they are they send them on the mission the mission was is the word of God true the mission was is my enemy stronger or weaker the mission was never speak it to it according to yourself the mission was you just report what you see in other words you go to a doctor they said you have this you have this you have this or you said God the doctor said this is happening this is happening that the doctor the mission was don't say well if I have cancer that means I'm going to die no that was their conclusion God didn't ask them to make a conclusion the word didn't say go out there here see what you're going to see and come back and give me your conclusion the message was you go out there and you just tell me what you saw and and I think that happen so much within our lives we go out and something happen and all of a sudden we fall apart you know we start to look well I don't know how I'm going to get that job I don't have the qualific well the scripture didn't say do you have the qualification let me say this the the the thing that's really upsetting about that story is these people were gotten out by the hand of Mighty God if you go back to see how they got out of the land that they came in it was a prophecy that they will go in bondage for 400 years so they weren't in Egypt for 400 years by a prophecy that was already given and the prophet said when the time of the promise came now I love this it says at one place when the time came now God began to change the event so it can match the prophecy God began to change the event why because it was time for deliverance when your time comes God will change your event amen we we we look at the event and we look at the circumstance and and and all of the sudden we make a conclusion they were not asked to make a conclusion they were only asked to go and spy the land so they were working and they came and they started making predictions well well based on what you ask us to do well now the first part is no no problem at all we went and in fact yes is the fruits of the land and you know this grapes no not one person could carry it yeah we all it took two people to carry the grapes and everything but as for the others we look like grasshoppers in their eyes there's no place in the scriptures where it says that the sons of anak looked at them and they thought that they look like grasshoppers not one they brought brought their own conclusion through the word of God how many times do we bring conclusion through the word of God the Bible says you are healed you walk in the doctor's office that said if they say you have a headache oh praise God I'm Healed you have cancer oh that one I don't know you just made your own conclusion the scripture says that I am the Lord God who Health all th diseases it didn't say I heal the headache I can't heal malaria he didn't say I heal the headache I I can't heal cancer he says all that diseases I I've said this before and I've say this if you read uh the the the the the Book of Joshua you will find at every Junction that it was never the strength of the Israel people that made them overcome to begin with the battle every battle that they fought they want it because of the obedience to the words of the Prophet obedience to the word of God when the word of God said only choose few people they did well they many well just choose few how are we going to go just choose few just follow the word when the word of God said I want you to just go around the building I just want you to go around and dance and just go around and do nothing around Jericho when they did that that produced the result in every instance God chose a way that seemed impossible to bring forth the result so they would know that the result didn't come from them but it came from God and God will do it every time in your life every time he will confin your wisdom he will confin you to show that you're not the one producing the result you're not the one producing healing you go you say well it's because of the pill I took no the pill didn't heal you it's your faith that healed you there's another one that took the same pill they die so you might as well stop talking about the pill and startop praising [Applause] God it it's amazing they talk about the placebo effect where you go they give you something and all of the sudden the person gets healed how is it possible what they gave you was not even medicine what is it it was your positive attitude it was your faith you believe that what you were doing something was going to happen and something happened to us oh my the word so when Joshua and Caleb came when he came the time to speak I love this they only spoke what the word had already spoken they didn't add anything new their revelation of the situation was only according to the promise that they already have they talked about the land being good land they talked about the sons of anak and the giant at the end they say that we are more than able to overcome them but what I'm says that they were looking at the promise and not under circumstances my brother my sister Victory comes when we look upon the promise and not on our circumstances and it's just not looking upon the promise but you look upon this promise and you speak it and I know you know way I'm going with this just want you to walk with me for a little bit so the pattern of transformation will only come when the go when the word is spoken first it's when the word Goes Forth because why the word is the only thing that has the power of transformation in it the word of God is what brings the result the word of God is our strength the word of God is what will change the circumstances you cannot continually let me say this speak negative ly and expect something positive to happen that's right and and I believe the reason is because often time we are we we lose the awareness that our words have power we lose the awareness that our word carries a power within it the scripture says the out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speakers the prophet will say in one place is that it's what we think it's what we spend time on it's all those things it's what we are and the scripture I was thinking about just before I get to this I thought about how many times and we can even be our own witness to this how many times s in our lives has something negatively been spoken that affected us for a long time how many times someone looked at you whether you were young or wherever whatever age you were in and looked at you and said looked at you he said oh you are no good oh look at you you will never amount to anything and you walked all your life life carrying not burden now these are just the words of a man these are just the words of a mortal but yet they're hurt yet they bring a result words spoken have a consequences words spoken will bring a result words spoken will bring something to come to pass the scripture will say in proverb 28 and 21 it says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it its fruits and they that love it it that love it shall eat the fruits thereof and I want to say to say this and I wonder just how many times in circumstances that we come across how many times have we let ourselves become just negative about it instead of being positive how many times we we have we have completely lost the awareness that our words carry consequences and we just spoke and in fact we run into a situation where we think oh this is just me speaking let me say this every time you speak you are either inspired by God or you are inspired by the devil that's right there is no such thing as free thinker so because we always think God is on this side the devil and is on this side and I'm here in the middle making my own decisions no you're not you're either being influenced by one or the other and what you speak either comes from One Tree or the other tree right oh I'm no good we love that oh look at me I'm dumb you know I I let me say this this is simple but this is very important I I I could have taken this and and talk about the son of men speaking the word and we would have been up and running and all of that but that is not relevant unless we can understand this because that son of man manifestation is today talk about oh you know the the time it's about even the time of squeeze it talks about when if your your brother's crop is drying it says you can speak and God will send the rain let me say this your brother's crop is drying every day we've taken it and send it to some future event instead of speaking now amen there are people in our midst that need God that are struggling every day and we look at them instead of speaking the word we are speaking negative oh look at them they can't dress right look at them they can't talk right look at them they missing church pray for them speak the word and we if you're going to help somebody you have to have love in your heart you have to put yourself in their shoes you have to remember that God has done the same for you while you are yet a sinner while you were lost in sin he came and he was paent with youall he walked with you you were stumbling and rolling in the dust and and just don't know what to do he was patient with you how come you can extend the same patience this is God in a human flesh let me say this the son of man he came to speak life if Jesus came to speak life if we are the manifestation of that same life or that same sound then we are to Speak Life to people the word of God is given to you for you to walk into circumstances oh you know perhaps at work perhaps some where oh you know I just went to a doctor and they told me I have cancer and I'm going to die and everything God has giving you the authority to walk in a situation where death has been spoken and Speak Life to it oh you know what I know a God and that God he he is manifested in the end time and and he sent us a prophet and that Prophet spoke a word and he said not even cancer will stand before you and and I can tell you testimonies of Believers that I know and I can give you books that you can go read about the testimonies of that same God he can speak to your life and it will change the circumstance we are not called to participate in the deaf conversation who's going to be the next president who's going to be the secretary of the state who's going to be this and what is Donald Trump going to do and what's going to happen to the country what if this happened or what it's none of our business I I I feel like we want to prolong these things as long as we want let me say this in fact it's not on your program it's God's program to begin with oh my so and and and and so he it says death and life and in fact it will the scripture will speak in James oh I love this I could just spend all time in the Book of James speaking about this James 3 5 and 6 it says even so the tongue is a little member and and boast of great things behold how great a man or a little fire kindleth and then it says and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that if the fire the whole body it says set forth a fire of uh the course of the nature and it is set on fire of hell so yes James now he not telling us so we can go and either Tire tongue so we don't speak anymore but he's wanting us to have the understanding that within this tongue we have the power to either speak life or death so we have to be careful every time we open our mouth so that we just don't speak some vain ideas that comes that we are very careful in making sure that I am speaking life I am speaking encouragement I am speaking life I'm speaking something that will produce God in the life of the individual we we we become expert and and I wonder how many times our tongue has gotten us in trouble and I'll confess this most of the time it's not even for the action we do something wrong but it really gets worse when we open our mouths why because we want to bring out all the justification why we were supposed to do the wrong that we did instead of just saying you know what I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that I am so sorry you know I get scared when somebody calls me and says let's get to the bottom of this I don't want to get to the bottom I want to get up to the bottom of since when I've ever people sat down and talked and talked and talk and come to a resolution never never you have your Viewpoint I have my viewpoint the only thing that can unite us is the word of God so if I say I'm sorry we forget about all we go forward do the bottom bottom of what God is not in the bottom he's up Hallelujah we should change it we should get to the up you know what brother I I I I did this because I wasn't really thinking I'm so sorry forgive me let's move forward and the and if you walk into somebody they talking bad about somebody say you know what brother we're not supposed to be doing this you know what sisters this is not okay we can't if you really need to help go see the person go help them let's pray how many believe Prayer Changes Things but how many times do we go on our knees to change the circumstance before we can talk about it amen I rather go to my knees I rather go to my knees and pray until God changes that circumstance without even the person knowing that I was praying for them than standing there and talking about it everybody wants to be a hero everybody wants to be to be the one with the wisdom to know that I'm the one who spoke I'm the one who prayed no you let me say you're not getting one credit what you get credit for is what happens in your [Applause] closet oh I lay hands on them that's why they're okay I did this who are you to begin with you are nothing you are nothing The Only Thing Worth is God but man wants to put himself into a place where let let me say this let's speak life and not death Matthew will say it this way oh I knew I wouldn't get there but I say unto you that every Idol word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment for by Thy word thou shall be justified and by Thy word th shall shall be condemned think about that every vain word do we even consider that you know it seems like if we're not careful and I'll just call myself on that it's like you you you were you were talking you were speaking your thought process like you haven't really even come to a conclusion yet but you're already speaking I think the Bible says that the person that talks too much commits sins what yeah so maybe we need to reduce condense our talking a little bit you know just condense it a little bit speak wisdom you know I I I grew up you know when I was young they used to tell us a story about The Lion and the and a and I believe a cow or or I don't know one of these animals with horns and so what happened is they say that one of this animal the lion always was afraid of them because every time he looked at the horns he wondered man what's in that mouth he said if he can stab me with the horns how much more with his mouth he could just bite me off and he was always scared of him until one day the lion is there just telling jokes and everybody's laughing he just started laughing and the lion looks in the mouth it's like oh this guy is stuffless and he became the Lion's meet since then and I think sometimes we do that we speak too much that we speak our wisdom away all the wisdom that could have been attributed to us gets lost in the multitude of words Romans will say that if thou shall confess in thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead and thou shalt be saved for it for with thy heart meant but for with the heart heart man believeth in unto righteousness and with a mouth man confess the with a mouth confession is made unto salvation whatam says if you say I'm not saved I'm not safe I'm not safe I'm not Sav you're walking out of it I'm not good I'm not good I'm not good you're walking out of it let me ask you a question if God saved you then how come you speaking it will change it isn't that amazing God wants you to repeat what he has done God wants our word to become his word let me jump to the end the bride has th say of the Lord or she skips still that's why where is the word at the end time the word is in the rde and she knows what to do with the what do we do with the word we speak it we change people's circumstances you know I was talking about Andrew earlier on if we're not careful our meetings become oh let's get together let's jump up and uh you know I touch you you heal my sicknesses and I come and you I touch you I heal your sicknesses and I deliver you and you deliver me and we do all of that we keep going in circle it's just us really that's the extent of the power of God that was given to us to just do it for one another it was given for you to go out there now I'm not saying we don't need healing we do God knows I need he doesn't need we need God knows we need in fact healing is the children's bread when we need it God will give it to us he's not going to let us go hungry he knows what we have need of but the purpose of a son is to speak life into a Dying World is to speak life where there's death is for him to go find the lost one is to go into a generation of dying and speak and let God come forth and bring this word to come to passen God didn't come into a perfect Eden that had everything in said let her be now imagine that he came into a void place a chaotic place a place that was without form that's where the word was needed I love this in Isaiah 50 and4 perhaps I'll just read this one and come to some place to close Isaiah 15 and4 says I love this it says if you could put it up there it says the Lord had given me the tongue of the learned that I should speak that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary in I I saying the Lord had given me the tongue of the learner of the learn in other words the Lord has given me wisdom I have been given the tongue of one that's wise the one who's learned the one who's been blessed the one who's been converted that I should know when to speak the word that I should speak the word in season to him that is weary not just to speak vainly but I know there's a need right here that I have a recognition of the situation that I'll know what the circumstance is that I may speak the word of God but when I'm speaking the message testimony in the message law we know this one very well the message law he preaches Chicago Illinois it says it says now Paul's speaking here in the valley of the Shadow rather the law being a shadow of good things to come he says could never uh could never make the worship perfect he says then so he goes on and show what the per what what the Perfection is now isn't a strange thing that this is not so through uh it says it's so much through the uh uh thoughts of the people they say well I'm weak my Fai it's not much it's not very much I'm not a very I'm not a very good Christian it says just just what the devil wants you to say it says you are talking his language right there he says You must never say that don't ever let your testimony be negative negative let it be positive all the time I'm saved I have God in my heart I believe in with I believe in him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts and everything never be permit it says never permit a negative thought to come into your mind if you can help it when it can start that it says when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thought to come in well that it says it says don't be like a farmer that says it couldn't it couldn't stop he couldn't stop the bird from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting don't entertain bad thoughts don't entertain evil thoughts don't entertain thoughts that are contrary to the word of God he says I couldn't stop them from HS thing he says that's a good thing see you can't help the thought when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no he says no no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God I'm it says I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you see he is the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrew three he says he says that he's the high priest of our confession and he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it thank you Lord that is the spoken word in action you say but I look in my flesh I can't help it yes you can just don't say it I don't care how many thoughts accumulate just don't let it out just don't let it out in fact when they accumulate just begin to speak the opposite you know good oh I'm just good right now oh you're not going to get this praise God he's already given it to me it's a fight it's a battle it's the Battle of making sure our minds are always on the right thing it's the Mind Battle of every day we woke up we put God first and we walk in his word and we confess his word we go forward we go forward knowing that what is spoken is going to come to pass it's the Conant Battle of knowing that my words amen have a weight my words what I speak butam says one place it says if God up there says by my stripes you are healed I will only repeat what he says it says if God set it up there and you confess it down here it will come to pass but if God set it up there you don't say it up here somewhere there's a breach in the electricity I was thinking about ba him if the musician could come y's called and they called him and they paid him so he can curse the children of Israel the ones that were with Moses they were just passing but balac hated them so bad that he wanted to see them go down he came and he paid a prophet and the prophet came and asked God God said no and then he came back and he tried to find a loophole for him to just figure out and and and then oh we're going to give you more money just do it he stand at the end and he says God is blessed I cannot curse it says behold I have not found iniquity in Jacob let me say this those that God has called and blessed and ordained we have no right to curse them that's right and it doesn't matter what stage they are in in the growth in the Emancipation Proclamation not everybody was at the same level but whatam says the younger one were able to run up there they could see the sun come up and oh I'm free oh they were able to scream and say I'm free why because they saw the sun rise but there were that were at the bottom of the mountain they were as free as those that were up in the mountain even though they couldn't see the sunrise with their eyes yet so just because a person cannot see the sunrise it doesn't mean they are not free they are free because the word says they are are free you are free because the word said you are free you are not free by Your Own Strength so I say tonight this morning let's speak the word but what him says speak to the Rock he says the rock is the Revelation The Rock was in the dry place he says here is the rock of God that was standing in the wilderness he says no matter what the situation was no matter what they had need of they were commanded to speak to the Rock so if they needed healing they spoke to the Rock if they needed Deliverance they spoke to the Rock whatever they now think about this in the wilderness how is water going to come out of the rock what says the most dest thing there is in the wilderness is the rock but yet God told them and says speak to it and let me ask you the next question since when does The Rock have years Hallelujah since when does the dry bone hear the word of God all ye dry bone he hear the word of the Lord am I the only one the word of God will penetrate everything everything if the rod of Aaron was taken a dry Rod placed into the presence of God it came alive I don't care how dead you are this morning just come in his presence you shall receive life so here we are we are giv life Let's Speak Life to everything Let's Speak Life in our circumstances Let's Speak Life life to everything we encounter something is not right don't dwell in the negative Speak Life to it get out of it to say I don't want to dwell in it I'm going to speak life if God could come and anoint the prophet to speak the scroll into existence in fact the prophet is there battling with it and saying well you know he said I've always looked at that scripture but I never understood it because every time I looked at it I thought well this can only happen after the atonement because the atonement is the pay of all the prices and the return of everything he says well then something told me well how come Joshua stopped the son that's before the atonment he says well I didn't know so I just left it alone but God wanted him to speak on it so God comes and he says yeah you are wanting to hunt don't you need squirrels don't you need something he said well I I do he says well why don't you speak it says well is that really you should I really speak he said yeah speak well before you speak how many do you want I love our god what color of our eyes do you want what do you really want God wants us to be expressive God don't want us to keep everything mental it's like someone saying I'm going to pray mentally speak God I'm here and I need this and this is happening and he want you to he wants to hear your voice he wants to hear you express yourself he wants to hear what's in the depths of your heart he wants to converse with you he want to hear like J like jobby says I want to go up to his door I want to open up and sit down I want to tell him what's in my heart don't you ever feel like well that's what he want he placed that desire in you so you can go after [Music] it but yet we are and we think oh maybe if I work over time then I'll get more money maybe no he wants you to speak the word the the situation is there to give you an opportunity so you can use your mouth and speak it's not given for for you to run away and go create another situation no it's given for you to say well I'm not going to run away I'm going to stand you and speak he said speak and go forward speak and go forward I'm not going to speak and forget I'm going to speak and wait until it happens why because the sons attribute is the same as the father's attribute if the father's attribute is to give life the only the son can only identify himself with that same attribute the only way we'll know that this is the son of such and such is by their life that they can produce did the prophet say that you have the power to impart eternal life and how many times do we use that how many times do we actually apply it but yet we are here believing that there's going to come a time where we can speak rain in somebody's crop where we're going to speak where the third pole will be manifested my question for you is when just tell me when if not now if not today if not this morning let's not live below our privileges I I was really touched and moved and my desire is not just to be a Christian and come here and preach a sermon after night I'm looking for life I'm not standing here with a desire to impress anybody I'm looking for life God I want your life to be manifested I I want to see you you yourself living in me I want to see your characteristics I want to see the attributes of the son living in me I say this it's time we go over churches it's time we go past the churches and the programs and everything and all of those things it's time to get real and say God I want to touch you for myself I want that life to be manifest I want the reality of that God to be manifested in here is that your heart desire this morning let's all stand let's just bow our heads our gracious [Music] father Lord Jesus it
