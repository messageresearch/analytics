[18:07] this morning
[18:08] amen but ezekiel if we could just come
[18:10] and open our service in prayer
[18:12] amen
[18:22] heavenly father we thank you this
[18:24] morning as we get ready here today
[18:27] may you be with us oh god we thank you
[18:30] for your presence already
[18:32] in our midst as we come on the
[18:35] expectation to hear from you oh lord
[18:37] may prepare our hearts to receive you
[18:40] we thank you again our god may you be
[18:42] with you with us and
[18:44] see us through the end
[18:46] [Music]
[18:47] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[18:54] hey man god bless you this morning wanna
[18:56] welcome everyone in the house of god
[18:58] and then trust you're happy to be here
[19:00] together amen god in the presence of the
[19:03] lord you're gonna invite for the mic for
[19:04] our psalm reading
[19:08] amen
[19:24] good morning we're gonna
[19:28] read psalm 96 this morning
[19:33] you know it opens up with the verse
[19:37] oh sing unto the lord a new song
[19:41] you know that caught my attention
[19:44] obviously i started to think about
[19:46] singing
[19:49] what does it mean to sing unto the lord
[19:52] really does it mean that the
[19:56] lord enjoys listening to music that he's
[19:59] looking for some background music as he
[20:01] works
[20:04] you know there's something that the lord
[20:06] is looking for here
[20:08] something that when his prophets speak
[20:11] of
[20:11] singing unto the lord a song you know
[20:13] david said it many times isaiah said it
[20:16] several times
[20:17] scripture after scripture sing unto the
[20:20] lord
[20:23] here's a question just because
[20:26] music plays in church or on the radio
[20:30] or on your iphone and it plays a good
[20:33] old gospel song or a worship song
[20:36] and you sing along with it
[20:39] are you necessarily singing unto the
[20:41] lord
[20:43] or are you just singing along with music
[20:46] that you enjoy
[20:48] or that blesses you or that you
[20:52] think is a good message
[20:55] we know what a song is it's it's words
[20:58] arranged according to a specific melody
[21:01] a specific cadence that declares a
[21:04] message
[21:05] it's a specific word with a specific
[21:07] tone and a specific beat
[21:11] and singing is when your lips take up
[21:13] that message
[21:15] and your body takes up that melody and
[21:17] that beat
[21:19] and you become a vessel for delivering
[21:21] that message
[21:24] you know there are many reasons why
[21:28] you would have your body your lips to
[21:31] become an instrument for a song
[21:34] because your flesh likes the melody or
[21:36] the beat
[21:38] because your mind likes the words
[21:42] because your heart likes the feeling
[21:45] or the emotion that it generates
[21:49] you know generally those that take up a
[21:51] song are generally testifying to the
[21:53] fact that they identify with
[21:56] or are subject to that song
[22:00] but what does it mean to sing unto the
[22:02] lord
[22:04] you know as we read into psalm 96 it
[22:07] describes
[22:08] what singing unto the lord is it says in
[22:12] verse 2
[22:12] sing unto the lord bless his name
[22:17] show forth his salvation
[22:20] from day to day verse 3 declare
[22:24] his glory among the heathen
[22:27] his wonders among the people
[22:32] you know singing unto the lord is when
[22:34] he is glorified
[22:36] in the singing when his wonders
[22:41] and his work are being made known
[22:46] it says sing unto the lord verse 3
[22:48] declare his glory unto the heathen
[22:51] so singing unto the lord is someone
[22:53] taking up a song and declaring to the
[22:55] heathen
[22:56] the glory of the lord but
[22:59] how often do we take a song that's
[23:01] written by the heathen and try to
[23:03] glorify the lord with it
[23:06] you know as i've mentioned before i i
[23:09] always like to find the first time in
[23:10] the scripture that a phrase is mentioned
[23:13] because usually more often than not it
[23:16] sort of defines what it means when the
[23:18] scripture
[23:18] uses that phrase does anyone know the
[23:21] first time that singing
[23:23] occurs in the scripture
[23:26] it's in exodus 15. it's immediately
[23:30] after the lord prepares a way through
[23:32] the red sea
[23:34] for his people and defeats the enemy
[23:35] that troubled them
[23:37] you know he had we all know the story he
[23:39] had the children of israel that were
[23:40] trapped with the sea
[23:41] on one side and the enemy on the other
[23:46] and in exodus 14 13 it says and moses
[23:48] said unto the people fear ye not
[23:51] stand still and see the salvation of the
[23:54] lord
[23:55] which he will show to you today for the
[23:59] egyptians whom ye have seen today
[24:02] ye shall see them again no more forever
[24:06] and then we all know what happens in the
[24:07] very last verse of psalm 4 of exodus 14
[24:10] says this and israel saw that great work
[24:15] which the lord did upon the egyptians
[24:18] and the people
[24:18] feared the lord and believed the lord
[24:20] and his servant moses
[24:23] and the very next verse exodus 15 1
[24:28] starts this way then sang moses
[24:32] and the children of israel this song
[24:35] unto the lord and the rest of the
[24:38] chapter
[24:38] is what singing unto the lord looks like
[24:43] you know the children of israel sang not
[24:45] because they liked the tune
[24:47] not because they liked the beat or not
[24:49] even because they liked the words
[24:53] they were singing a song in response to
[24:55] the work
[24:56] that god had done for them
[25:00] in fact this song had never been sung
[25:03] before
[25:05] it was a new song in response to a work
[25:09] that
[25:09] god had done for them
[25:13] no one else could sing that song like
[25:15] them
[25:17] you know they were giving witness to
[25:19] what the lord had done for them
[25:20] personally
[25:23] you know that's singing unto the lord
[25:25] the rest is just singing somebody else's
[25:27] song
[25:29] you know in the book of revelation we
[25:31] have examples of different groups of
[25:32] people
[25:34] singing a song unto the lord
[25:38] you know they could sing because it
[25:39] specifically declared the work that god
[25:41] had done for them
[25:43] in revelation 5 9 it's the song of a
[25:46] people redeemed of every kindred and
[25:48] tongue
[25:49] and people and nation and in revelation
[25:52] 14
[25:53] 3 it's the song of 144 thousand who were
[25:56] the first fruits of god
[25:58] and neither people could truly sing the
[26:00] other person's song
[26:04] you know singing a song unto the lord
[26:05] doesn't necessarily involve music
[26:08] and it doesn't necessarily mean you
[26:09] can't
[26:11] sing another song but singing unto the
[26:14] lord is when that
[26:15] song is you declaring
[26:18] the work that god has done for you
[26:22] and no one else can sing your song
[26:26] you know make sure you're singing about
[26:28] the works that god has done for you
[26:31] and every time god does a new work for
[26:33] you
[26:34] you can sing a new song you know so as
[26:38] if nothing else it says in psalm 96 2
[26:41] show forth his salvation from day to day
[26:45] so you know as we read psalm 96 this
[26:48] morning
[26:50] you know let's follow david's advice and
[26:52] sing a song unto the lord
[26:55] sing the song give witness to the work
[26:57] that he has done for you personally
[27:00] and don't take up someone else's song
[27:02] but make sure he gets the glory for the
[27:04] work that he has done so let's read
[27:06] psalm 96 together
[27:08] it says o sing unto the lord a new song
[27:12] sing unto the lord all the earth sing
[27:15] unto the lord
[27:16] bless his name show forth his salvation
[27:19] from day to day
[27:20] declare his glory among the heathen his
[27:23] wonders among all people
[27:25] for the lord is great and greatly to be
[27:27] praised
[27:28] he is to be feared above all gods for
[27:31] all the gods of the nations are idols
[27:34] but the lord made the heavens honor and
[27:36] majesty are before him
[27:38] strength and beauty are in his sanctuary
[27:41] give unto the lord o ye kindreds of the
[27:44] people
[27:45] give unto the lord glory and strength
[27:47] give unto the lord the glory do
[27:49] unto his name bring an offering and come
[27:52] into his courts
[27:54] o worship the lord in the beauty of
[27:56] holiness
[27:57] fear before him all the earth say among
[28:00] the heathen that the lord
[28:02] reigneth the world also shall be
[28:04] established that it shall not be moved
[28:06] he shall judge the people righteously
[28:09] let the heavens rejoice
[28:11] and let the earth be glad let the sea
[28:13] roar in the fullness thereof
[28:16] let the field be joyful and all that is
[28:18] therein
[28:19] then shall all the trees of the wood
[28:21] rejoice
[28:22] before the lord for he cometh for he
[28:25] cometh to judge the earth
[28:27] he shall judge the world with
[28:28] righteousness and the people with his
[28:31] truth amen
[28:37] amen god bless you may have your seats

[44:19] not anything more
[44:22] but it's a direct line
[44:26] to the throne room

[44:38] and if you need some proof

[58:05] of your hands
[58:06] we love you father and we ask that you

[58:21] by your word we ask these things this
[58:24] morning
[58:25] in jesus precious and wonderful
[58:28] name we pray amen
[58:32] amen god bless you this morning i'd like
[58:35] just to
[58:36] read one little quick scripture i that
[58:39] i thought was a blessing before we have
[58:43] brother john come preach for us
[58:47] if i can find it here
[58:55] i don't know if i can find it but
[59:01] in reading and if it struck me i put my
[59:04] marker wrong but
[59:05] the scripture says let this mind be in
[59:08] you
[59:10] that was in christ i thought can you
[59:13] imagine if there ever a battle we're in
[59:15] today it's the battle to
[59:17] to get a hold of your mind the way you
[59:20] think the way you decide
[59:21] so much stuff coming into us trying to
[59:24] get it
[59:25] and then the scripture simply says let
[59:27] this mind be in you
[59:30] that was in christ you know and i
[59:32] thought oh god
[59:33] to think like you think amen that would
[59:37] solve a lot of problems well that's why
[59:39] we come to the house of the lord
[59:41] today is to hear the word of god and
[59:44] hear what god thinks and
[59:46] we have brother john baduca with us this

[59:52] he preaches in english so but he's got
[59:56] one of those texas accents that are hard
[1:00:00] to

[1:00:04] and let the word of god bless you and

[1:05:44] from first corinthians the 13th chapter
[1:05:48] i want to reach the 10th vest
[1:05:52] and then to match you
[1:05:55] the fifth character and the 48th verse
[1:06:02] by when that which is perfect is come
[1:06:06] then that which is in part shall be gone
[1:06:09] away
[1:06:15] matthew 5 48
[1:06:20] be there for a person perfect
[1:06:23] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:06:27] is perfect may the lord add his
[1:06:30] breathing of the word
[1:06:32] you may be seated
[1:06:37] yeah we thank the lord this morning for
[1:06:40] the scriptures read
[1:06:46] believe this is a well-known scripture
[1:06:47] unto you all
[1:06:49] maybe some might have even read it this
[1:06:52] morning before coming here
[1:06:54] but i want us to look at it for a few
[1:06:58] minutes
[1:07:01] we finally hear that speaking to us
[1:07:07] about that which is perfect
[1:07:12] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:07:16] then that which is in part shall be gone
[1:07:20] away
[1:07:22] and hear paul
[1:07:26] speaking to the corinthians
[1:07:30] talking about the preeminence of love
[1:07:34] the mass of love
[1:07:38] showing them that love is unfailing
[1:07:43] he talked about speaking in tongues
[1:07:48] prophecies and all those things
[1:07:52] knowledge mysteries
[1:07:57] that he end up
[1:08:01] saying
[1:08:04] we know in part and we profess her in
[1:08:06] part
[1:08:09] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:08:13] then that which is in part shall be gone
[1:08:16] away
[1:08:19] and the second scripture
[1:08:23] tells us
[1:08:26] say be therefore perfect even as your
[1:08:29] father
[1:08:31] which is in heaven is perfect
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:38] now we find out here that paul trying to
[1:08:42] point
[1:08:42] the corinthians
[1:08:46] to the perfect thing
[1:08:50] and trying to explain to them
[1:08:54] that when that which is perfect is calm
[1:08:58] that which is in part shall be gone away
[1:09:02] trying to make them know that
[1:09:07] to let that which is impact be gone
[1:09:11] they need to make way for the perfect
[1:09:14] thing to come
[1:09:16] and when the perfect thing comes
[1:09:21] automatically all that is
[1:09:24] in part shall be gone away
[1:09:28] i tapped it to light this morning
[1:09:32] you know when
[1:09:36] light comes on or you
[1:09:40] go to our rooms and we fish on the light
[1:09:45] automatically darkness vanish
[1:09:50] and all that are hiding
[1:09:53] in darkness will also vanish
[1:09:58] i want this to ponder about it for a few
[1:10:01] minutes
[1:10:02] and i want to attach on my summon this
[1:10:04] morning
[1:10:06] i want to take it from this creature
[1:10:07] that we have read
[1:10:09] but when that which is
[1:10:12] perfect is calm
[1:10:16] when that which is perfect is come
[1:10:22] in the message the prophet was talking
[1:10:25] about this he says first corinthians
[1:10:27] that he says
[1:10:29] when that which is perfect is come
[1:10:33] that which is in part shall be gone
[1:10:36] away with so all these things
[1:10:42] so all these little things of jumping up
[1:10:45] and down like kid like a kid
[1:10:49] trying to talk in tongues
[1:10:53] and all these other things
[1:10:57] when that which is perfect
[1:11:01] and we do have today
[1:11:05] by god's help the perfect interpretation
[1:11:09] of the word we divine vindication
[1:11:14] then that which is in part is gone
[1:11:17] away with when i was a child i speak
[1:11:22] like a child as a child i understood
[1:11:25] as a child when i became
[1:11:29] a man i put away childish things
[1:11:34] amen he went on to say
[1:11:37] in another verse he said now i think
[1:11:41] i just went through that didn't it
[1:11:44] didn't i
[1:11:46] and when that which is perfect has come
[1:11:50] that which is in part shall be gone away
[1:11:54] with paul said
[1:11:57] though i speak with tongues of men and
[1:11:59] of and angels
[1:12:01] and i do all these things here
[1:12:04] but when that which is perfect just come
[1:12:08] now is there anything perfect
[1:12:12] but god amen there's nothing perfect
[1:12:17] but god therefore if we are talking
[1:12:19] about
[1:12:21] a perfect thing coming in
[1:12:25] then we should understand that we are
[1:12:28] talking about god
[1:12:30] taking charge of us taking control of
[1:12:33] our life
[1:12:36] like paul said it is not me that lives
[1:12:39] but it is he
[1:12:40] that lives and when he comes in
[1:12:44] he takes control of everything
[1:12:49] said in the beginning was the word and
[1:12:52] the word what is god
[1:12:54] there were still god
[1:12:57] all right when the witch
[1:13:01] is perfect is come then that which is in
[1:13:04] part
[1:13:06] is gone away
[1:13:10] amen when that which is
[1:13:13] perfect is come then that which his
[1:13:18] impact shall be gone away and according
[1:13:21] to
[1:13:22] the quote that i've just read
[1:13:26] he talks about god being perfect
[1:13:31] the word of god being perfect and we
[1:13:33] found out that
[1:13:34] god is a perfectionist
[1:13:38] when we go to the beginning everything
[1:13:40] that god created
[1:13:42] it created it in its perfection the
[1:13:45] vegetables
[1:13:46] the vegetations the animals
[1:13:50] even we human beings the scripture said
[1:13:55] god created us in a perfect condition
[1:13:59] before the fall man was perfect
[1:14:04] man has dominion
[1:14:07] in the garden of eden but when
[1:14:11] sin came in that perfection
[1:14:15] was broken
[1:14:21] thank god that
[1:14:25] is bringing us back to that profession
[1:14:28] and he's coming one of these days for
[1:14:30] the bride
[1:14:32] and is coming for a perfect bride
[1:14:37] not an imperfed bride
[1:14:42] but a perfect ride a bride that is
[1:14:46] perfect from head to toe
[1:14:50] and this bride must be a wet bride
[1:14:54] and for us to be a wet bride
[1:14:58] we must allow the word of god to have
[1:15:02] dominion in our life
[1:15:05] like jesus christ was saying i in he
[1:15:08] i in them and them i in
[1:15:11] in in him or in them and they in me
[1:15:16] that oneness need to come
[1:15:19] and when that oneness comes it changes
[1:15:23] us
[1:15:25] it transforms us it makes us better and
[1:15:28] worthy christians
[1:15:32] we are living a time when we need to
[1:15:34] look for
[1:15:35] the perfect thing that is the only
[1:15:39] solution to our problems
[1:15:41] that is the only solution to our needs
[1:15:44] that is what will transform us
[1:15:46] that is what will make us be closer
[1:15:50] be drawn to the lord
[1:15:54] when that which is perfect is come
[1:15:57] then that which is in part shall be gone
[1:16:00] away
[1:16:04] the prophet in the crosshairs he said
[1:16:09] the line that was in the hocks
[1:16:14] in the stock and in the tussle
[1:16:18] in the hawks all goddess in the siege
[1:16:23] and we are in the seeding time
[1:16:26] when the the real seed of god will be
[1:16:29] made manifest
[1:16:33] went one way to the other way
[1:16:37] justification made a way for
[1:16:39] sanctification
[1:16:41] sanctification made a way for the
[1:16:44] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:46] the baptism of the holy ghost made a way
[1:16:49] for the holy ghost itself
[1:16:51] to come right down in perfection
[1:16:56] back to the word again manifested itself
[1:17:03] amen and amen when that which is perfect
[1:17:07] is come
[1:17:09] that which is in part shall be gone away
[1:17:19] if we go to psalms
[1:17:23] the 19th at the 18th chapter
[1:17:26] verse 30 we found out that
[1:17:29] god's ways are perfect
[1:17:35] and it is god that give us strength
[1:17:38] it is god that makes our way perfect
[1:17:46] amen
[1:17:56] when that which is perfect is come into
[1:17:58] our life
[1:18:00] it changes our life it changes our
[1:18:04] worship
[1:18:06] it changes our prayer it changes our
[1:18:10] home
[1:18:12] changes our thinking it changes our way
[1:18:15] of doing things
[1:18:18] we know within in the world
[1:18:23] we've been in the denominations
[1:18:26] and we have gone with first
[1:18:30] interpretation of the word
[1:18:33] but thank god that
[1:18:37] he sent us a message and that message
[1:18:41] came with the true interpretation of the
[1:18:43] word
[1:18:45] like the prophet said when the seals
[1:18:48] were opened the bible became a new book
[1:18:51] we understood it in a different way
[1:18:55] even though the dimensions
[1:18:56] determinations had that same bible
[1:19:00] but there are many things they cannot
[1:19:01] see that we by the grace of god
[1:19:05] who has been called out of them who has
[1:19:08] the true interpretation of the word of
[1:19:10] god
[1:19:13] our worship is different our way of
[1:19:16] doing things is different
[1:19:18] our understanding is different
[1:19:22] brand is a lot what i want us to look
[1:19:26] at this morning is to allow
[1:19:29] that which is perfect to come in
[1:19:34] when that which is perfect comes
[1:19:37] we will no longer struggle in our
[1:19:39] worship
[1:19:41] we will no longer struggle to do the
[1:19:43] will of god
[1:19:44] we will no longer struggle to come to
[1:19:46] church
[1:19:47] we will no longer struggle to pray we
[1:19:50] will no longer struggle to fast
[1:19:52] we will no longer struggle to reach the
[1:19:54] word of god
[1:19:56] because that which is perfect has come
[1:20:00] and has come to take control therefore
[1:20:04] it's not going to be
[1:20:05] immense effort any longer but it is god
[1:20:08] himself doing it in us
[1:20:13] because the time has come
[1:20:16] that month idea has to come to an end
[1:20:21] man's effort has to come to an end
[1:20:24] man's worship has to come to an end
[1:20:27] man's effort has to come to an end
[1:20:30] and for this to come to an end we have
[1:20:32] to allow
[1:20:33] the perfect to come and that perfect
[1:20:37] is god himself and when god take control
[1:20:40] in our life we are changed completely
[1:20:45] christ is coming back again
[1:20:49] and he's coming for a perfect ride like
[1:20:52] the prophet said
[1:20:53] he's not coming for a bride
[1:20:56] that is spiritually crippled no
[1:21:01] it's coming for a bride that is perfect
[1:21:02] from head to toe spiritually speaking
[1:21:05] and that bride must be able to receive
[1:21:09] the fullness of the word
[1:21:10] into a womb and be well impregnated
[1:21:14] and that is what changes us when we are
[1:21:17] word impregnated
[1:21:19] it changes us automatically it's just
[1:21:22] like a woman that has married
[1:21:24] and has taken the seed of the man even
[1:21:28] though the woman was
[1:21:29] not want a change in her life once she
[1:21:32] is taking the seed of the man
[1:21:35] all her efforts to remain the way she
[1:21:38] was
[1:21:39] will be she can even go
[1:21:42] by birth to touch her belly but that see
[1:21:46] that is in air will start changing her
[1:21:50] we'll start changing her face will start
[1:21:52] changing her belly
[1:21:54] will start changing her her way of
[1:21:56] working
[1:21:57] and it will reach a place certain things
[1:22:00] that she
[1:22:00] enjoys so much she has to
[1:22:04] forget about i want to say this morning
[1:22:07] that if that which is perfect is come
[1:22:10] unto you
[1:22:11] all that you used to be will be changed
[1:22:17] that woman
[1:22:21] maybe he liked setting food so much
[1:22:25] when they marry newly if the husband
[1:22:29] goes to work and does not bring that
[1:22:31] food she is offended
[1:22:35] but when she took seat he doesn't want
[1:22:38] to smell that food at all
[1:22:41] amen when the food goes near her
[1:22:46] she'll pour
[1:22:50] that is how it is spiritually
[1:22:54] there are many people today they are
[1:22:56] struggling
[1:22:58] struggling to live the word of god
[1:23:02] they are struggling to pray they are
[1:23:05] struggling
[1:23:06] to please god but this morning my advice
[1:23:10] to you
[1:23:10] is allow that which is perfect to come
[1:23:13] in
[1:23:15] and when that which is perfect is come
[1:23:17] all
[1:23:18] the imperfections in your worship all
[1:23:21] the profession in your life
[1:23:23] all the imperfections in your home who
[1:23:26] have to flee
[1:23:28] because that which is perfect has come
[1:23:32] amen it will not be our own idea again
[1:23:37] it will not be family idea again
[1:23:40] when that which is perfect is come
[1:23:43] and god is expecting us in the time that
[1:23:47] we are living in
[1:23:50] that the bread must come to maturity
[1:23:53] the bride must be a word on two feet
[1:23:58] and for us to be able to reach that
[1:24:01] standard
[1:24:02] we need to allow that which is perfect
[1:24:06] to come in amen
[1:24:09] when that which is perfect is come all
[1:24:12] that is in part
[1:24:13] shall be gone away
[1:24:20] nowhere in is this
[1:24:23] according to scripture was a perfect man
[1:24:28] he lived a perfect life in his
[1:24:30] generation
[1:24:33] he could live a perfect life because
[1:24:36] he accepted the word of god in his
[1:24:39] totality
[1:24:41] and he lived it he was preaching the
[1:24:44] word
[1:24:45] and he was living the word even though
[1:24:48] there were
[1:24:49] challenges in those days
[1:24:52] noah was able to mount
[1:24:56] over those challenges he did it not
[1:25:00] by his own effort he did it not by his
[1:25:03] own wisdom
[1:25:05] he did it because he has accepted the
[1:25:08] fullness of the word
[1:25:10] and that is the perfect thing
[1:25:13] we can only live a perfect life when
[1:25:16] that which is perfect is come into us
[1:25:21] and if that which is perfect is come
[1:25:23] unto us
[1:25:25] all that we do will be
[1:25:28] perfect our marriages will be perfect
[1:25:32] event advice will be perfect
[1:25:37] whatever we want to do we'll do it
[1:25:39] perfectly
[1:25:41] we will not do it for doing sick we're
[1:25:44] not doing because
[1:25:45] we cannot control ourselves we will not
[1:25:48] do it because
[1:25:49] everybody likes it no we will do it
[1:25:52] because
[1:25:53] amen that which is perfect is in us
[1:25:57] it's influencing us
[1:26:00] it's moving us it's inspiring us is it
[1:26:04] it is taking us to the will of god
[1:26:07] is taking us to the plan of god
[1:26:10] what we need today is the perfect thing
[1:26:15] amen god because he wanted a perfect
[1:26:20] bride
[1:26:21] he sent a perfect message to prepare a
[1:26:24] perfect bride
[1:26:26] amen he sent us a perfect prophet
[1:26:31] a perfect message to prepare a perfect
[1:26:35] ride and he is coming for a perfect ride
[1:26:38] he is not coming for a church member he
[1:26:40] is not coming for
[1:26:42] a so-called christian no sir he is
[1:26:45] coming for a perfect ride
[1:26:47] and as you all know the bride will be
[1:26:50] taken from the church
[1:26:51] the church is not going to the rapture
[1:26:53] but the bride is going
[1:26:55] and the pride is the word bride the
[1:26:58] bride
[1:26:58] is the one that accepted the fullness of
[1:27:00] the world
[1:27:02] we are living a time when many
[1:27:06] are living the world they are
[1:27:08] backsliding the way
[1:27:10] from the word
[1:27:13] the way we came across the message
[1:27:17] the way we were burning like fire
[1:27:21] the way we were zealous
[1:27:25] the way we could fast the way we could
[1:27:28] separate ourselves
[1:27:30] isolate ourselves and be studying the
[1:27:33] message
[1:27:35] even in the week we are able to read two
[1:27:38] or three message books
[1:27:40] we can't find it again this time
[1:27:44] there is some sort of coolness
[1:27:47] there's also backsliding there's some
[1:27:50] sort of weakness
[1:27:55] people are taking things for granted
[1:27:59] they want to do it their way of thinking
[1:28:02] they want to do it the way it pleases
[1:28:04] them they want to do it the way
[1:28:07] it favors them but i want to say this
[1:28:10] morning
[1:28:11] that when that which is perfect is calm
[1:28:14] hallelujah you will not do it otherwise
[1:28:19] than the way god wanted this to be done
[1:28:23] when that which is perfect just come
[1:28:27] if we go to ezekiel
[1:28:31] the 28th chapter verse 15 he talks about
[1:28:35] satan
[1:28:38] satan was found perfect in his way to
[1:28:40] begin with
[1:28:44] satan was perfect but
[1:28:47] when sin was found in satan
[1:28:52] he fell from perfection i want to say
[1:28:56] this morning
[1:28:57] that many are
[1:29:01] failing are falling
[1:29:04] from perfection and they are not the way
[1:29:08] they used to be
[1:29:11] they are not burning the way they used
[1:29:12] to bend
[1:29:14] they are not sealers the way they used
[1:29:16] to be
[1:29:18] they don't love the message the way they
[1:29:21] love it initially
[1:29:23] all because they have backslided
[1:29:28] many a times it takes the grace of god
[1:29:31] in one's life to know he has backslided
[1:29:44] if god has not given you his grace
[1:29:47] you will not know you have backslided
[1:29:50] you may think you are the man you used
[1:29:51] to be
[1:29:53] meanwhile you have backslidden like
[1:29:56] like something you know samson was born
[1:29:59] for a purpose
[1:30:00] he was anointed for the purpose but he
[1:30:03] came to a time
[1:30:04] when he left the word of god
[1:30:08] when he forsaked the instruction that
[1:30:09] god gave him
[1:30:11] the spirit of god that was upon him
[1:30:14] left him the power of god left him
[1:30:18] he thought he used to be the man he is
[1:30:23] when they told him the philistines are
[1:30:26] around he's chewed as if
[1:30:29] he would be able to do something he
[1:30:31] couldn't do anything
[1:30:33] meanwhile he has grieved the holy spirit
[1:30:36] the holy spirit has
[1:30:36] left him
[1:30:40] he left the commandment of god he left
[1:30:44] the will of god
[1:30:46] and they arrested him they
[1:30:49] shave his head
[1:30:52] he became a useless person
[1:30:55] usually in the sense that he has failed
[1:30:59] god
[1:31:00] he has failed the purpose of which god
[1:31:02] brought him on earth
[1:31:05] he has come out from the will of god
[1:31:09] and we found out that the philistines
[1:31:14] were using him for a drama
[1:31:17] amen but thank god that he recognized
[1:31:19] himself
[1:31:21] and he prayed that lord
[1:31:24] remember me once more
[1:31:27] remember me once more and the scripture
[1:31:30] said
[1:31:31] god visited him again god gave him back
[1:31:34] his training again
[1:31:36] and the philistines the people he killed
[1:31:38] that day
[1:31:39] outnumbered the people he killed all his
[1:31:42] life
[1:31:44] something when people hear his name
[1:31:47] they run for their life they don't even
[1:31:50] want to
[1:31:52] mention where is he coming from which
[1:31:54] direction is coming from
[1:31:56] his name alone scared them
[1:32:01] but when he left the word of god
[1:32:06] he became powerless many christians are
[1:32:09] powerless today
[1:32:11] all because they have left the word of
[1:32:15] god
[1:32:16] i thank god that god
[1:32:21] served as grace for us he's rich in
[1:32:25] mercy
[1:32:26] he is calling us back to come back to
[1:32:30] our first love
[1:32:32] to come back to our position to come
[1:32:35] back to where we left him
[1:32:39] to allow that which is perfect to come
[1:32:42] in
[1:32:43] when that which is perfect is come that
[1:32:46] which is in part
[1:32:48] shall be gone away whether which is
[1:32:51] perfect is come
[1:32:52] hallelujah in our homes
[1:32:55] there will be peace in the home the
[1:32:58] confusions in the hope will be gone
[1:33:00] the misunderstanding in the hope will be
[1:33:03] gone
[1:33:04] when that which his spirit is come into
[1:33:07] a young man's
[1:33:08] life had a lawyer in the youth's life
[1:33:14] they will know how to approach their
[1:33:15] marriage
[1:33:18] they will not marry because
[1:33:22] i am growing they're not married because
[1:33:26] i cannot help it no they will look for
[1:33:30] the will of god
[1:33:34] amen i said they will look for the will
[1:33:36] of god
[1:33:38] they will bring it before their pastor
[1:33:41] they will not go to take the vow before
[1:33:44] letting the apostle know it
[1:33:48] no
[1:33:50] they will seek their choice of their
[1:33:51] pastor
[1:33:53] when that which is perfect is there
[1:33:59] we are living a time
[1:34:03] when
[1:34:06] god is not moving
[1:34:11] the way he's supposed to move in the
[1:34:14] bride
[1:34:16] thinking that we can speak in tongues
[1:34:20] we can jump
[1:34:23] all those things perfect if i do them
[1:34:28] and i do not have love i am nothing
[1:34:34] amen and that love that paul is talking
[1:34:36] about is god himself
[1:34:40] if you do all those things and you don't
[1:34:42] have
[1:34:43] the fullness of god you are nothing
[1:34:48] gifts satan can imitate them
[1:34:52] let us not base our hope on gifts
[1:34:56] gibbs can fail satan can imitate gifts
[1:35:01] satan can operate gifts but the word of
[1:35:05] god
[1:35:06] is the only thing that satan's here
[1:35:10] and you can only defeat satan by the
[1:35:13] word of god
[1:35:14] but that says a lot
[1:35:19] let us allow the perfecting to come in
[1:35:25] in everything we do
[1:35:28] let that which is perfect come
[1:35:33] all your struggles will be gone
[1:35:37] and it will lead you to profession
[1:35:40] like matthew the fifth chapter
[1:35:43] verse 40 says be therefore perfect
[1:35:48] even ask your father which is in heaven
[1:35:51] amen we cannot be perfect outside the
[1:35:54] word
[1:35:56] we cannot be perfect in our own wisdom
[1:35:58] we cannot be perfect by some creed or
[1:36:00] dogma
[1:36:02] we cannot be perfect by some mummy
[1:36:04] doctrine
[1:36:06] no say we can only be perfect by the
[1:36:08] word of god
[1:36:10] many men lived
[1:36:14] and god testified
[1:36:17] that they are perfect men a man like job
[1:36:21] job lead in the days when there was not
[1:36:24] even
[1:36:25] a bible
[1:36:29] he lived for inspiration
[1:36:32] but the scripture said god has to
[1:36:35] challenge the devil
[1:36:37] that there's no man on earth like job
[1:36:41] he was a perfect man he was a man of
[1:36:45] integrity he had evil
[1:36:49] amen and the prophet said
[1:36:52] god has confidence in jobs
[1:36:57] can we ask ourselves this morning that
[1:37:01] can god
[1:37:02] have confidence in us god has confidence
[1:37:06] in job can god have confidence in you
[1:37:10] that god has confidence in me god can
[1:37:13] only have confidence
[1:37:14] in us when we allow
[1:37:17] that which is perfect comes in
[1:37:21] when that which is perfect is come all
[1:37:24] that is not perfect
[1:37:26] shall be gone away jesus christ
[1:37:29] came as a perfect sacrifice
[1:37:33] and he gave us a perfect salvation
[1:37:37] because he was a perfect sacrifice
[1:37:40] if we can accept him wholeheartedly
[1:37:45] if we can give ourselves to him
[1:37:49] that sacrifice that he did once and for
[1:37:51] all
[1:37:52] will have an effect in our life
[1:37:57] a perfect sacrifice
[1:38:00] god is a god
[1:38:05] of perfection and everything god is
[1:38:09] doing
[1:38:10] he wants this to be done in a perfect
[1:38:12] way
[1:38:13] that's a scripture that i was talking
[1:38:15] about even when
[1:38:17] going to offer offer an offer an
[1:38:19] offering to god
[1:38:21] it has to be a perfect one
[1:38:24] but we found out that sometimes it is
[1:38:26] very difficult
[1:38:28] we make vows we make promises especially
[1:38:32] when we are graduated
[1:38:36] and we have not yet got a job
[1:38:39] we stopped praying if god gave me a job
[1:38:41] i'll do this i'll do that i'll do
[1:38:44] this but when god makes a way we get the
[1:38:48] job
[1:38:49] we forget about everything
[1:38:53] hallelujah but when that which is
[1:38:55] perfect is come
[1:38:57] all that is impact shall be gone away
[1:39:00] the scripture said
[1:39:02] let us leave the fundamental things
[1:39:07] let us leave the fundamental things
[1:39:11] many people today have stopped at
[1:39:14] justification others have stopped as
[1:39:18] sanctification
[1:39:21] but we need to advance
[1:39:24] we need to go further to the baptism of
[1:39:28] the holy spirit
[1:39:29] and when the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:39:31] takes place in somebody's life
[1:39:34] not the anointing of the holy spirit the
[1:39:36] real holy spirit
[1:39:38] the life of jesus christ coming back
[1:39:41] upon a believer
[1:39:43] he changes everything in his life he's
[1:39:45] changing his thinking
[1:39:47] he's changing his way of worshiping he
[1:39:49] changes his way of thinking
[1:39:50] he's changing his way of doing things
[1:39:52] and that man becomes
[1:39:54] a different person he becomes a
[1:39:58] an outboard to the world
[1:40:02] because god is operating in his life
[1:40:07] amen amen
[1:40:10] the scripture said
[1:40:14] those who have gone
[1:40:17] are waiting for us because they cannot
[1:40:20] be made perfect without us
[1:40:23] amen they cannot be made perfect without
[1:40:27] that
[1:40:28] we need to be ready
[1:40:31] the last ship has to come in
[1:40:36] for us to be completed for us to go
[1:40:41] and they will be completed the prophet
[1:40:44] preached a message and he entitled it
[1:40:46] the statue of the perfect man
[1:40:50] the statue of the perfect man we found
[1:40:53] out that
[1:40:54] he mentioned certain things certain
[1:40:56] virtues
[1:40:59] that need to be made manifest in our
[1:41:02] life
[1:41:04] we need to have faith
[1:41:08] wed upon words wed upon words
[1:41:11] wait upon words until we read that
[1:41:13] tattoos
[1:41:15] then we become perfect
[1:41:19] in christ jesus perfection
[1:41:22] is not in any church perfection is not
[1:41:25] in any man
[1:41:27] perfection is in christ jesus
[1:41:31] if we can come back to christ
[1:41:35] like we used to
[1:41:38] we will be made perfect
[1:41:41] when that which is perfect is come that
[1:41:44] which is
[1:41:45] in part shall be gone away
[1:41:48] and in everything will be found perfect
[1:41:52] amen as i will be perfect
[1:41:56] we will respect our pastor we respect
[1:41:59] the doctrine
[1:42:00] by which we are brought up
[1:42:05] i remember at home there were certain
[1:42:07] sisters that came to me
[1:42:11] they said pastor we want you to pray
[1:42:13] with us
[1:42:15] because we want to marry under your
[1:42:17] ministry
[1:42:20] we know what you are teaching us here
[1:42:23] and we don't want to go marry somebody
[1:42:26] who has been taught a different way
[1:42:29] who has a different understanding of the
[1:42:31] scriptures
[1:42:33] we will not have peace so we want to
[1:42:37] choose
[1:42:38] we want to accept a vow
[1:42:42] in this church
[1:42:45] because we know how we are taught
[1:42:50] breading is a lot
[1:42:54] we need revelation
[1:42:58] in our life
[1:43:01] we don't do things because of
[1:43:04] necessity we don't do things because
[1:43:07] we need to do it we do things because
[1:43:10] the word of god has provided a way for
[1:43:13] it
[1:43:14] we are living in a time when god's
[1:43:18] mind like the pastor said has been made
[1:43:21] manifest in this end time
[1:43:24] and we need to allow the mind of christ
[1:43:27] to reign in us and to allow the mind of
[1:43:30] christ to be in us
[1:43:33] we need to come under the handship of
[1:43:36] the world
[1:43:37] we need to come under the history of the
[1:43:39] message we need to come under the
[1:43:41] hellship of our pastor
[1:43:42] we need to come under the hershey of our
[1:43:45] husbands
[1:43:48] then we can say we have that mind
[1:43:54] amen and amen if
[1:43:58] i am to come under the hershey of god
[1:44:02] then it means my head needs to be taken
[1:44:06] away and his head put there
[1:44:10] then i can think the way he thinks i can
[1:44:14] see things
[1:44:15] the way he sees things hallelujah
[1:44:19] oh braziness he said the lord
[1:44:22] let us come back home let us come back
[1:44:26] to the message
[1:44:27] let us come back to our position let us
[1:44:31] come back into what god is doing in this
[1:44:33] end time
[1:44:34] let us come back to the reviver
[1:44:38] we shouldn't allow the revolver fire to
[1:44:41] die in us
[1:44:44] when he dies in you you have backslided
[1:44:48] you are able to do whatsoever you feel
[1:44:52] like doing
[1:44:53] but thank god that christ is coming
[1:44:57] it's coming for a bride it's coming for
[1:45:00] a wet bride a bride
[1:45:04] that knows no denominational doctrine
[1:45:08] a bride that not knows no man's doctrine
[1:45:12] a frightening bride virgin to the word
[1:45:16] very into their message verging to god
[1:45:22] now the church is coming true
[1:45:26] like the prophet said
[1:45:44] i read it
[1:45:49] now find out if
[1:45:54] if corinthians 2 corinthians 11 at 13th
[1:45:58] i believe it all well
[1:46:02] is that the first corinthians though i
[1:46:05] speak with tongues of men and angels
[1:46:07] both
[1:46:09] the kind that can be interpreted
[1:46:15] and that kind and that
[1:46:18] cannot be interpreted i am nothing
[1:46:24] so what the use of fooling within
[1:46:29] what is the use of fooling with it
[1:46:32] though
[1:46:32] i understand all the mysteries of god
[1:46:35] why do you go to seminaries try to lend
[1:46:39] so much
[1:46:41] about you better get right with god
[1:46:46] first certainly
[1:46:50] do i oh bless hallelujah
[1:46:54] we got so
[1:46:57] you got so you can't even have a
[1:47:00] congregation
[1:47:02] unless you have a healing campaign
[1:47:05] or some kind of miracle going on
[1:47:08] a week in industrial generation seekers
[1:47:12] after search
[1:47:13] why do you want with that
[1:47:18] paul said he could do all
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:23] kinds of things even move mountains
[1:47:28] and still use nothing
[1:47:33] where the stones it will cease where
[1:47:36] there's knowledge
[1:47:38] it shall vanish where there's prophecies
[1:47:42] it shall fail but when that which
[1:47:45] is perfect is come it endures
[1:47:49] forever
[1:47:52] amen when that which is perfect is come
[1:47:56] it endures forever as i was saying
[1:48:00] many people have not got the real thing
[1:48:04] because the prophet said god cannot seal
[1:48:06] you
[1:48:09] and later
[1:48:12] regret for having sealed you and when he
[1:48:16] seal you
[1:48:17] he saves you until the day of your
[1:48:19] redemption
[1:48:24] so he makes sure who he is going to seal
[1:48:29] he make sure he sees
[1:48:33] a person and doesn't come back to regret
[1:48:38] god is god he knows our beginning from
[1:48:42] end he knows who we are he knows where
[1:48:45] we are going to be ended
[1:48:48] he has presented us he knows our end
[1:48:53] he knows who we are therefore
[1:48:57] let us look for that which is perfect
[1:49:00] when that which is perfect is calm it
[1:49:03] endures forever
[1:49:05] and love is perfection god so loved the
[1:49:08] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:49:12] that whosoever shivers
[1:49:16] no say whosoever shakes
[1:49:19] no sir whosoever speaketh
[1:49:22] no say whosoever believeth in him should
[1:49:28] not perish
[1:49:29] but have everlasting life
[1:49:32] believe that children amen
[1:49:37] many a times we take substitute
[1:49:43] substitutes we substitute the word of
[1:49:46] god for something else
[1:49:51] but all our substitute the things which
[1:49:54] we have substituted the word of god with
[1:49:58] cannot make us arrive at home
[1:50:02] the only way is to come back to the
[1:50:04] world
[1:50:05] the only way is to submit to god
[1:50:08] the only way is to accept the word of
[1:50:11] god the only way
[1:50:12] is to believe the word of god amen and
[1:50:15] amen
[1:50:16] we are living in a difficult time
[1:50:22] in togo now churches are closed
[1:50:27] you cannot worship we need to worship
[1:50:30] online
[1:50:33] this is a time that we know those who
[1:50:37] truly believe and those who truly
[1:50:41] did not believe those who
[1:50:46] have come
[1:50:49] yes to associate themselves with the
[1:50:51] church
[1:50:52] associate themselves
[1:50:56] with their message this is a time
[1:51:01] that they are fully will be made
[1:51:02] manifest i thank god that
[1:51:06] if that which is perfect is come in them
[1:51:10] in us like paul said what shall separate
[1:51:13] me from the love of god
[1:51:14] to be naked death
[1:51:18] poverty there's nothing that can
[1:51:22] separate me from the love of god
[1:51:24] once the perfect thing is there
[1:51:28] if there's something we need to point
[1:51:30] the people to today
[1:51:32] is that perfect thing because when that
[1:51:35] perfect thing is come
[1:51:37] we are deep rooted in the lord
[1:51:41] because there's going to be a move
[1:51:45] there's going to be wings there's going
[1:51:48] to be storms
[1:51:51] and once we are deep rooted in the wedge
[1:51:55] no storm can move us no wind can move us
[1:51:59] because that which is perfect is in us
[1:52:04] hallelujah when that which is perfect is
[1:52:07] come
[1:52:08] then that which is in part shall be gone
[1:52:11] away
[1:52:13] let us examine ourselves this morning
[1:52:17] whether we have that which is perfect
[1:52:20] whether that perfect thing is in us
[1:52:24] amen amen that's what we need today
[1:52:28] and that is the manifestation
[1:52:32] of the word of god in our life
[1:52:35] that is where god is leading us to
[1:52:39] amen and that is where we can be united
[1:52:43] with him
[1:52:45] and that unity becomes an invisible
[1:52:48] union
[1:52:51] and when we are united with him we
[1:52:54] become one with him
[1:52:56] we think like he thinks we see things
[1:53:00] like he see things
[1:53:02] we have his mind amen
[1:53:05] the mind of god is in the bride
[1:53:09] and it takes the bride to recognize the
[1:53:12] voice of god
[1:53:14] because we are living in the days of
[1:53:17] many voices
[1:53:20] many voices
[1:53:24] you have to have the perfect thing to be
[1:53:27] able
[1:53:27] to identify the voice of god
[1:53:30] to be able to hear the voice of god amen
[1:53:35] you have to come out of every
[1:53:37] preconception
[1:53:39] to be able to hear the voice of god i
[1:53:42] remember in the days of naman
[1:53:45] when he was to go to
[1:53:49] the man of god for healing he went
[1:53:53] with preconception when he arrived
[1:53:57] the scripture said the man of god did
[1:54:00] not even come out to come see whether
[1:54:02] he's
[1:54:02] white whether he's called it whatsoever
[1:54:05] he is
[1:54:07] he only told him to go
[1:54:10] and wash himself in the river this man
[1:54:13] became anointed
[1:54:16] remember why there are better rivers in
[1:54:18] our home
[1:54:19] in our area why waste my time to come
[1:54:23] here
[1:54:27] and he wanted to even go back
[1:54:30] until his servant has to advise him
[1:54:34] and the scripture said where he came
[1:54:38] when he believed what was said he went
[1:54:41] into the water
[1:54:41] the first time the second time the third
[1:54:44] time
[1:54:45] before he finished with the number that
[1:54:48] he asked him to wash
[1:54:49] he became clean
[1:54:52] we need not to put our mind
[1:54:57] to the word of god god is suffering he
[1:55:00] doesn't need your contribution
[1:55:02] we are now called to reason with the
[1:55:04] word of god we are called to believe the
[1:55:06] word of god
[1:55:07] and stand by it and see god
[1:55:11] fulfilling it
[1:55:15] let that mind which is in christ jesus
[1:55:18] be in you amen
[1:55:22] brethren say a lord
[1:55:26] when that which is perfect is come
[1:55:31] many people today are struggling
[1:55:34] they are trying to make it
[1:55:38] but i believe this morning that
[1:55:42] we cannot make it ourselves
[1:55:46] why struggled when god has made a way
[1:55:49] for you
[1:55:50] why fight on your home where god is
[1:55:52] there for you
[1:55:55] he is there for you
[1:55:58] when he is to bring you perfection
[1:56:02] when he's ready to come in with that
[1:56:04] which is perfect
[1:56:06] whether which is perfect is come we get
[1:56:10] a perfect health
[1:56:12] because he is the god that heals our
[1:56:15] diseases
[1:56:16] and forgiveness is our iniquity
[1:56:20] whatever our problem is this morning
[1:56:23] i do not know but one thing i know
[1:56:28] one thing i'll point you to one thing i
[1:56:32] will advise you
[1:56:34] is allowed that which is perfect to come
[1:56:37] in when it comes in
[1:56:42] it will be automatic
[1:56:45] it will not be you doing it but it is he
[1:56:49] doing it it will not be you
[1:56:52] living but it is he that is living in
[1:56:54] you it is not you fighting but it is you
[1:56:58] it is he that is fighting the battle is
[1:57:00] not yours
[1:57:02] the battle is his let us come
[1:57:05] under the hershey of the lord the
[1:57:08] heroship of the message
[1:57:10] amen let us come under the hershey
[1:57:13] of the word the hershey of christ
[1:57:17] and all our struggles
[1:57:21] will be over when that which is perfect
[1:57:24] is come
[1:57:27] by which is impact shall be gone away
[1:57:31] let us accept god by his word
[1:57:38] let us allow
[1:57:42] other influences that are influencing us
[1:57:48] from the word of god and let us come
[1:57:51] under the influence of the word of god
[1:57:54] let us come under the influence of the
[1:57:56] message of the hour
[1:57:59] let us surrender everything to him
[1:58:03] surrender everything to jesus surrender
[1:58:06] your ways to jesus
[1:58:07] surrender your business to jesus
[1:58:09] surrender your family to jesus
[1:58:12] surrender whatsoever you are doing to
[1:58:14] jesus and he will take care of it
[1:58:17] because he is a master of all
[1:58:20] he has never failed and he would
[1:58:23] never fail the prophet said
[1:58:26] he said god didn't face something it was
[1:58:29] something that failed god
[1:58:32] god has never failed a man
[1:58:35] it is man who fails god
[1:58:39] when israel was coming from the promised
[1:58:41] land
[1:58:42] the scripture said they drunk from the
[1:58:44] rock
[1:58:46] and they left the rock but the rock
[1:58:48] followed them
[1:58:50] amen man has always
[1:58:54] been running from god been running from
[1:58:57] the will of god
[1:58:59] because ma want to contribute
[1:59:02] amen god provided everything for israel
[1:59:06] but they were never satisfied they
[1:59:08] wanted something else
[1:59:10] hallelujah brethren and scissors a lot
[1:59:14] that same spirit is working today
[1:59:17] is working among believers today is
[1:59:20] working in the christian dam today
[1:59:23] they are not certified with the plan of
[1:59:25] god they are not satisfied with the
[1:59:27] program of god
[1:59:28] they are not satisfied with what god is
[1:59:30] doing
[1:59:32] they want to contribute i want to say
[1:59:35] this morning
[1:59:36] that god doesn't need your contribution
[1:59:40] your contribution is failure to begin
[1:59:42] with
[1:59:45] because your contribution will be a
[1:59:47] carnal
[1:59:48] contribution will be a selfish
[1:59:51] contribution
[1:59:54] it will not help god so god doesn't need
[1:59:57] it
[1:59:58] amen we need god more
[2:00:02] than ever in the time that we are living
[2:00:04] is
[2:00:05] because this is a time of perfection
[2:00:08] this is a time the bride is coming to
[2:00:10] maturity
[2:00:11] this is the time that christ is coming
[2:00:14] back
[2:00:14] to take the bride home and this is the
[2:00:18] time we need
[2:00:19] god the more in everything
[2:00:24] this is a time we need god the more in
[2:00:27] whatsoever we are doing
[2:00:29] this is a time we have to let god lead
[2:00:32] us
[2:00:33] not we living god amen
[2:00:37] went david had a revelation
[2:00:41] to go bring the act of the covenant
[2:00:45] the scripture said instead of consulting
[2:00:49] nathan who was a prophet of those days
[2:00:52] he went and conducted consulted the
[2:00:54] generals
[2:00:56] the intellectuals
[2:01:01] and they allow him
[2:01:05] king must leave for long and he went
[2:01:09] to bring the ark of the covenant the
[2:01:12] scripture said
[2:01:14] they went the wrong way
[2:01:19] so when they were coming inside of
[2:01:22] life death king
[2:01:25] and fear grieve them all
[2:01:28] we need to carry the act of covenant
[2:01:32] the way god wanted us to carry it
[2:01:36] we need to allow
[2:01:40] the cat to be behind
[2:01:44] and the horse before it
[2:01:47] don't put the cat before the horse
[2:01:52] it will never work allow
[2:01:56] the horse to pull the cat
[2:01:59] allow the holy spirit to lead you allow
[2:02:03] the holy spirit to advise you
[2:02:05] allow the holy spirit to influence you
[2:02:11] brethren says a lot
[2:02:16] man has reached a place
[2:02:20] where he looks at how intelligent he is
[2:02:26] how strong he is how wise he is
[2:02:30] how rich he is how powerful he is
[2:02:34] and as a result they've taken god out of
[2:02:40] the program but when god is out of the
[2:02:43] program
[2:02:45] you are bound to fail
[2:02:48] the scripture said
[2:02:51] they have driven christ from the church
[2:02:55] he is no longer in the church and they
[2:02:57] are doing their own things
[2:02:59] but now he is at the door
[2:03:02] of an individual he is
[2:03:05] knocking the door of an individual he
[2:03:08] wants to come
[2:03:09] in and when he comes in he will die with
[2:03:12] you
[2:03:13] he wants to come in as that which is
[2:03:16] perfect
[2:03:18] and be an answer to your needs and
[2:03:20] problems
[2:03:23] my brother my sister
[2:03:27] we have left god many have left god
[2:03:32] just like mary
[2:03:35] and joseph when they went to the feast
[2:03:40] in jerusalem
[2:03:42] after the feast was over they left
[2:03:45] without jesus
[2:03:48] going without jesus and they never
[2:03:51] thought of it
[2:03:53] the first day ended they never
[2:03:56] come to themselves the second day ended
[2:04:00] they never come to themselves at the end
[2:04:03] of the
[2:04:03] third day then they came to themselves
[2:04:08] my brother my sister
[2:04:12] can you believe
[2:04:16] that this thing can happen it has
[2:04:19] happened
[2:04:22] so it is
[2:04:25] that many are going without god they
[2:04:28] left him somewhere
[2:04:30] they left him for three good days
[2:04:35] not even imagining not even thinking
[2:04:38] until the third day then they started
[2:04:40] looking
[2:04:42] where is jesus where is jesus
[2:04:47] where is the power of god where is the
[2:04:50] holy spirit where is the presence of god
[2:04:54] and the scripture said they started
[2:04:57] questioning one another
[2:05:00] joseph might have asked mary where is
[2:05:02] her son
[2:05:05] mary might have answered i thought he
[2:05:08] was with you they were all presuming
[2:05:12] time of presumption has come to an end
[2:05:16] because we have the revealed word we
[2:05:18] have just sailed the lord
[2:05:21] let us come from every
[2:05:24] presumption
[2:05:30] and the scripture said they needed to
[2:05:34] go back they need to travel three days
[2:05:37] again
[2:05:39] where you have left the lord that is
[2:05:42] where you can come
[2:05:43] to get him you can left him somewhere
[2:05:48] and be looking for him somewhere no
[2:05:50] where you have left him in your life
[2:05:53] where you have left him in your ways
[2:05:55] when you have left him
[2:05:58] by your way of doing things you need to
[2:06:00] go back there
[2:06:03] amen jesus said
[2:06:06] you can put a new wine in an old screen
[2:06:10] it will best no alteration
[2:06:14] new eye new bottle
[2:06:18] amen so they need to go back to where
[2:06:20] they love jesus
[2:06:23] and the scripture said when they arrived
[2:06:25] there
[2:06:27] jesus was busy having a ministerial
[2:06:29] meeting
[2:06:30] with the priests of those days
[2:06:34] when they saw him they were scared
[2:06:38] why have you made a suffering so much
[2:06:41] i and your father has been looking for
[2:06:45] you
[2:06:47] they look for him at the wrong time
[2:06:50] like it is today sometime when we come
[2:06:52] to church
[2:06:54] we allow our children to be playing when
[2:06:56] we play with other children
[2:06:59] and when we are ready to go
[2:07:02] the brother asked the sister was
[2:07:06] where's maybe james he said
[2:07:09] i thought james was with you and they
[2:07:12] will be argued over it
[2:07:16] brethren say lord
[2:07:19] jesus answered them he said don't you
[2:07:22] know that i have to be in my father's
[2:07:24] business
[2:07:26] my father is not joseph if my father
[2:07:29] would have been joseph
[2:07:31] i would have been in the cabinetry
[2:07:33] workshop
[2:07:35] but my father is god we need to be in
[2:07:38] our father's business
[2:07:41] and the only way we can be in our
[2:07:43] father's business is to allow that which
[2:07:46] is perfect
[2:07:47] to come in when that which is perfect
[2:07:52] is come all that is impact
[2:07:56] shall be gone away our problem today is
[2:07:59] not our pastor
[2:08:01] our problem today is not our brothers
[2:08:04] our problem today is not our sisters
[2:08:07] our problem today is not the church that
[2:08:08] we belong to no
[2:08:10] our problem today is
[2:08:13] we need the word back
[2:08:17] we need that which is perfect to come
[2:08:19] back
[2:08:20] and when it comes back everything will
[2:08:22] be okay
[2:08:24] hallelujah we have a peace we never had
[2:08:27] before
[2:08:28] we have the joy we never had before
[2:08:31] amen when that which is perfect is come
[2:08:35] it comes with everything it comes with a
[2:08:38] full puzzle
[2:08:39] full package it comes with all that we
[2:08:42] needed
[2:08:43] amen brandon said lord
[2:08:48] let us come out of
[2:08:51] man's influence
[2:08:55] when i said money influence what i want
[2:08:56] to say is our own
[2:08:58] influence
[2:09:02] and let us allow the power of the holy
[2:09:04] spirit
[2:09:06] to operate in our life it will lead us
[2:09:10] to the mind of god
[2:09:11] it's related to the purpose of god it
[2:09:13] deluded
[2:09:14] to the reason why god has called us
[2:09:18] we are not called to be here
[2:09:21] for being here sick no
[2:09:24] we are called with the purpose and the
[2:09:27] scripture said
[2:09:28] it is not he that is running it is not
[2:09:30] he that is willing
[2:09:32] it is god who gives rich if we can
[2:09:35] accept him
[2:09:37] if we can make way for him if we can
[2:09:40] allow the world
[2:09:42] to dominate us from head to toe we'll
[2:09:46] start seeing a change
[2:09:47] in our life and we'll stop complaining
[2:09:53] we'll stop pointing finger to one
[2:09:55] another
[2:09:59] and it's my husband and it's my wife
[2:10:04] i don't believe that our wife
[2:10:09] can prevent them from going to heaven
[2:10:11] from going to the rapture
[2:10:14] because an ex-wife did not prevent him
[2:10:17] from going
[2:10:19] am i right edna's wife will not prevent
[2:10:22] him from going
[2:10:25] all those who are complaining is because
[2:10:27] of my husband it's because of my wife
[2:10:29] it's because of this because of that i
[2:10:32] want to tell you
[2:10:34] the perfect thing has not come when the
[2:10:38] perfect thing comes
[2:10:40] no matter who your wife is who your
[2:10:42] husband is
[2:10:44] they can't stand on your way
[2:10:47] enoch the scripture said
[2:10:50] he walked with god several years
[2:10:54] and before he was translated the
[2:10:57] scripture said
[2:10:58] god was pleased
[2:11:02] with him hallelujah enoch
[2:11:08] was assembled and we are
[2:11:11] the type like i'm not going to the
[2:11:13] rapture
[2:11:16] we are also going to the rapture and if
[2:11:19] god was playing with enoch
[2:11:22] to be able to go to the rapture then we
[2:11:24] also need god to be pleased with us
[2:11:28] the prophet said arnold did not live by
[2:11:31] collective
[2:11:32] revelation he lived
[2:11:35] by an individual revelation
[2:11:38] revelation of the world
[2:11:42] people today are worshiping god by
[2:11:44] collective revelation
[2:11:46] i want to say you are failure to begin
[2:11:50] with i said you are failure to begin
[2:11:53] with
[2:11:54] a collective revelation
[2:11:57] will not make you make the heaven
[2:12:00] a revelation on the word of god
[2:12:06] revelation of what god wants you to be
[2:12:10] enoch i got the scripture
[2:12:14] for several years he pleased god
[2:12:17] which means that for all those years he
[2:12:20] did what was pleasing to god
[2:12:24] at the at the end of the day he went
[2:12:27] maybe he might have kissed the wife and
[2:12:30] select me
[2:12:30] just rolled a little and come and he
[2:12:33] walked to heaven
[2:12:35] the wife did not prevent him
[2:12:39] nobody can prevent you
[2:12:44] because you are a special person to god
[2:12:47] he knew you before the foundation of the
[2:12:49] world
[2:12:51] and at the right time he called you
[2:12:54] and he called you with your purpose
[2:12:59] and he is guiding his purpose in your
[2:13:00] life
[2:13:02] let us allow
[2:13:05] the perfect thing to dominate
[2:13:08] us for when that which is perfect is
[2:13:12] come
[2:13:14] don't forget it all
[2:13:17] that is in part shall be gone away
[2:13:21] let us examine our life this morning as
[2:13:23] i'll be bringing my sermons to an
[2:13:25] end what are the imperfections in your
[2:13:28] life
[2:13:32] imperfections in your life today you
[2:13:34] feel spiritual
[2:13:36] tomorrow you don't feel spiritual
[2:13:40] today you have the joy of your
[2:13:42] salvations
[2:13:44] tomorrow you lose the joy of your
[2:13:45] salvation
[2:13:48] today the holy spirit will speak to you
[2:13:50] tomorrow you start hearing another voice
[2:13:57] today you feel like a christian tomorrow
[2:14:00] you feel
[2:14:01] like you are not christian
[2:14:05] let that which is perfect come
[2:14:08] in and everything will be fitted
[2:14:12] every demon will be saturday those
[2:14:15] demons that are speaking into your ears
[2:14:19] that are having battle in your mind like
[2:14:22] the prophet said is that the greatest
[2:14:23] battle ever thought
[2:14:25] it's in the mind of god
[2:14:29] but that pattern can only be worn when
[2:14:32] that which is perfect
[2:14:34] is come greatness is the lord
[2:14:38] we are going to pray this morning but
[2:14:40] don't forget my topic
[2:14:43] when that which is perfect is come
[2:14:46] when it comes
[2:14:50] all that is imperfect
[2:14:54] shall be gone away and that which is
[2:14:57] perfect
[2:14:59] is not a gift it's not a sensation
[2:15:02] it's not speaking in tongues it's not a
[2:15:05] man
[2:15:06] but it's god himself the prophet said
[2:15:09] when god created a man
[2:15:12] he left a vacant place in his heart
[2:15:17] and he god want to come and build his
[2:15:20] throne there
[2:15:21] that by that throne
[2:15:24] he will lead you and a prophet call it
[2:15:28] a controller so that he can control you
[2:15:33] but today we've given those places
[2:15:36] to different things
[2:15:40] different things have taken that throne
[2:15:43] a place that is reserved for god
[2:15:46] and for god alone even scientists did
[2:15:49] not believe it initially
[2:15:51] but at the end of the day they found out
[2:15:53] that so
[2:15:56] it was that in a man's heart
[2:15:59] there's a vacant place there there's a
[2:16:02] place
[2:16:03] that is not occupied by a vein
[2:16:06] and god himself left that place there
[2:16:11] but he will come and tabernacle there
[2:16:16] so that he can lead you so that he can
[2:16:19] teach you
[2:16:22] so that i can influence you a controller
[2:16:28] this morning if we've given that place
[2:16:32] to whatsoever we've given it to
[2:16:36] it is time that we drive them away
[2:16:41] and allow that which is perfect which is
[2:16:43] god
[2:16:44] which is love to come and take that
[2:16:47] place
[2:16:50] that has come out from every
[2:16:51] substitution we've substituted god with
[2:16:54] many things you can never be
[2:16:58] satisfied
[2:17:02] if you have not got you
[2:17:05] the taste the taste that god has put in
[2:17:09] a man
[2:17:10] nothing can't take that place
[2:17:16] you may change it with other things
[2:17:20] but in duration time it will go
[2:17:24] and the taste will still be there it is
[2:17:27] god alone
[2:17:28] to feel that place if we can say this
[2:17:31] morning like paul said
[2:17:33] it is not me that lives but it is
[2:17:36] he that lives in me amen
[2:17:40] and if he leave lives in us what shall
[2:17:43] separate us
[2:17:44] from his love to be naked
[2:17:50] death
[2:17:54] to be single
[2:17:57] not to get the husband to marry
[2:18:00] not to get a woman to marry you
[2:18:03] wash your separators
[2:18:09] and nothing can separate us because we
[2:18:11] have the real thing
[2:18:14] and the real thing is god himself
[2:18:18] he is the only person that can
[2:18:21] feel us that
[2:18:24] can make us satisfied that does make us
[2:18:29] to be full we are going to pray this
[2:18:33] morning
[2:18:34] let us turn to our feet
[2:18:46] let us buy the heads

[2:24:30] this morning
[2:24:33] amen you know it's you just got to
[2:24:35] address it individually
[2:24:38] and i i believe there's a desire in all
[2:24:40] of our hearts
[2:24:43] to be perfect and i think we all know
[2:24:47] where our
[2:24:48] imperfections are where we need more of
[2:24:50] the lord in our life
[2:24:53] you know when you try to fix
[2:24:57] something up maybe you buy a house that
[2:25:02] needs is in need of repair
[2:25:06] like sometimes our houses are in need of
[2:25:08] repair
[2:25:10] you just don't look at the whole thing
[2:25:12] and hope it
[2:25:14] all of a sudden gets fixed
[2:25:17] but you take one thing at a time one
[2:25:20] thing at a time
[2:25:22] i forget which general that brother
[2:25:24] branham was speaking about
[2:25:26] he said how did he take the victory he
[2:25:29] said he took at one city
[2:25:31] at a time one city at a time
[2:25:34] bring god into your life every day every
[2:25:37] situation
[2:25:38] one circumstance at a time
[2:25:42] when you come up to something and you
[2:25:43] don't know he's there you just know it
[2:25:46] right there's where you get you and god
[2:25:48] put it together
[2:25:50] when you're not thinking the way he's
[2:25:52] thinking right there
[2:25:54] is where you surrender every step you
[2:25:57] take when you encounter
[2:25:59] something in your life where he's not
[2:26:01] there right there
[2:26:02] get that right get that right and just
[2:26:05] keep marching
[2:26:07] getting everything right as you go
[2:26:11] and you'll find out what that is the
[2:26:14] prophet of god said when you
[2:26:16] when you have total deliverance
[2:26:20] it brings you a freedom like you've
[2:26:23] never known before
[2:26:25] amen if you've got those things in your
[2:26:27] life i know i have them in my life
[2:26:30] and i think well i'll just fix the whole
[2:26:32] thing no i need to fix them

[2:31:05] [Music]
[2:31:12] sickness
[2:31:16] [Applause]
[2:31:18] [Music]
[2:31:26] [Music]
[2:31:29] [Applause]
[2:31:31] [Music]
[2:31:40] sickness
[2:31:43] [Music]
[2:31:52] amen you know we certainly live in a
[2:31:58] an hour where there's so much
[2:32:01] trying to go on and
[2:32:05] where we hardly even know what the right
[2:32:09] way to think is but we know the way we
[2:32:13] heard this morning
[2:32:15] the way to think is by god's word
[2:32:18] and that's what satan wants to do he
[2:32:20] wants to cool us off
[2:32:21] he wants us to get just lukewarm
[2:32:25] where we don't think that there's any
[2:32:30] any repercussions or
[2:32:33] any results from our actions that
[2:32:36] everything just
[2:32:37] remains the same he wants to try to rob
[2:32:40] us away from all the power and victory
[2:32:42] we had
[2:32:44] and i thought his brother john preached
[2:32:45] he said if you start
[2:32:47] seeing that you've lost the power in
[2:32:49] your life
[2:32:50] maybe your backslid and that's
[2:32:54] all that satan wants to do is just get
[2:32:56] your backslid
[2:32:57] to make you ineffective
[2:33:00] i think we just need to take a step up
[2:33:03] this morning don't you
[2:33:05] and do that we're going to have a
[2:33:07] baptism this morning
[2:33:10] micah you can uh
[2:33:14] bohannon is going to
[2:33:18] be baptized this morning so andrew if
[2:33:20] you get your son
[2:33:21] and bring him and will baptism
[2:33:24] i know some of you may have to go
[2:33:28] but we are having communion and foot
[2:33:30] washing tonight
[2:33:31] we'd certainly like to invite you back
[2:33:35] one of the things that god certainly
[2:33:38] said that we would have to do to be
[2:33:40] there
[2:33:41] is water baptism communion and foot
[2:33:44] washing
[2:33:45] the three ordinances of god so
[2:33:48] in light of this sermon this morning ask
[2:33:52] yourself is there something that's
[2:33:53] keeping you from doing the things that
[2:33:55] god
[2:33:56] would have you to do and then just at
[2:33:59] that moment
[2:34:00] ask yourself you know am i putting him
[2:34:04] first
[2:34:05] or is something cooling me off and
[2:34:08] and i really think this is a timely
[2:34:11] message for us
[2:34:12] that we've got to press harder to the
[2:34:15] mark
[2:34:16] than we ever have before hey
[2:34:20] man so let's why don't we just sing a
[2:34:23] good song for her
[2:34:25] this will make it a dismissal song so
[2:34:28] and we'll sing it then if you need to
[2:34:30] slip out you can slip out and then those
[2:34:32] that
[2:34:33] want to stay for the baptism can
[2:34:36] certainly
[2:34:37] stay for the baptism so let's have a
[2:34:39] dismissal prayer father we ask that this
[2:34:42] word
[2:34:42] would set in our heart this morning and
[2:34:45] father that those that they have to go
[2:34:47] that they would keep this
[2:34:49] message ever burning in their heart
[2:34:54] father they really consider father the
[2:34:56] importance
[2:34:58] of what it means to serve you father i
[2:35:02] certainly don't want to be left
[2:35:06] i don't want the rapture to come and
[2:35:07] then my
[2:35:09] find myself here because
[2:35:12] i wasn't serious about your word and
[2:35:16] i just let myself become lukewarm and
[2:35:20] indifferent and i let the world
[2:35:25] rob for me all my victory
[2:35:30] father the very word of god said that
[2:35:33] the angels are going to and fro
[2:35:37] looking to those who are sighing and
[2:35:39] crying
[2:35:42] and even when john wrote the scriptures
[2:35:44] he finally
[2:35:47] summed up the whole book of revelations
[2:35:50] as he watched the
[2:35:53] the beasts go out and he watched the
[2:35:56] great harlot and he watched the spirits
[2:36:00] raging and he finally come to the end of
[2:36:04] it all and
[2:36:05] looked up and said even so come quickly
[2:36:07] lord jesus
[2:36:10] lord just to think that there's people
[2:36:13] praying for you to come quick
[2:36:15] lord i don't want to miss it because i
[2:36:17] didn't think it was worthy
[2:36:20] i don't want to miss it because i didn't
[2:36:22] i wasn't
[2:36:23] diligent towards the things that i was
[2:36:25] supposed to do
[2:36:27] i don't want to miss it because i
[2:36:30] thought my life was so eternally secure
[2:36:32] that
[2:36:34] i didn't have to lift a finger
[2:36:37] lord i want to prove to you i believe
[2:36:40] lord let me restore my faith
[2:36:44] let me restore my diligence let me
[2:36:47] restore my holiness
[2:36:49] let me restore my fire in my heart this
[2:36:52] morning lord
[2:36:54] bring us back to that passion
[2:36:57] for your word we ask that
[2:37:00] in jesus name we pray amen
[2:37:07] how about we say you're the only one
[2:37:09] [Music]
[2:37:13] amen let's sing it as your art dismissed
[2:37:15] if you need to
[2:37:16] amen
[2:37:21] oh you are not a god
[2:37:29] you are not a god
[2:37:33] [Music]

[2:38:11] [Music]
[2:38:13] of god we can give
[2:38:16] to our god that's just
[2:38:29] [Applause]

[2:44:35] [Music]
[2:44:57] like me
[2:45:02] [Music]
[2:45:09] who was
[2:45:16] [Music]
[2:45:25] lord bless you we always appreciate when
[2:45:29] the lord
[2:45:30] moves on our young people and
[2:45:33] they decide to make a decision
[2:45:38] to do what's right and uh
[2:45:42] you know they asked the prophet of god
[2:45:44] when they should be baptized he said you
[2:45:46] baptize them and they want to be
[2:45:48] baptized
[2:45:49] and we certainly do that today and
[2:45:53] we believe it sticks with them
[2:45:56] and
[2:45:59] and it binds them with a group of people
[2:46:03] that have done the same thing
[2:46:05] and i believe it'll be there for them
[2:46:08] when they need it
[2:46:10] the scripture says in the book of acts
[2:46:12] it says
[2:46:14] therefore let all the house of israel
[2:46:17] know assuredly
[2:46:19] that god hath made the same jesus
[2:46:23] whom ye have crucified both lord and
[2:46:26] christ
[2:46:27] now when they heard this they were
[2:46:29] pricked in their heart
[2:46:30] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[2:46:34] apostles
[2:46:35] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:46:39] then peter said unto them repent
[2:46:43] and be baptized every one of you in the
[2:46:46] name of jesus christ
[2:46:48] for the remission of sins and you shall
[2:46:51] receive the gift of the holy spirit
[2:46:54] holy ghost for the promise is unto you
[2:46:58] and to your children and to all that are
[2:47:02] afar off even as many as the lord our
[2:47:05] god shall call
[2:47:07] and with many other words did he testify
[2:47:10] and exhort
[2:47:11] saying save yourselves from this up
[2:47:14] towards
[2:47:14] generation i believe that's what we
[2:47:17] heard this morning
[2:47:18] was an exhortation to save ourselves
[2:47:21] from this generation
[2:47:23] then they that gladly received this word
[2:47:27] were baptized and the same day
[2:47:32] there were added un to them
[2:47:35] about 3 000 souls that was quite a
[2:47:38] baptismal
[2:47:40] service wasn't it we're happy to add one
[2:47:43] more
[2:47:44] this morning in the kingdom of the lord
[2:47:46] amen
[2:47:49] our gracious heavenly father as we know
[2:47:51] in your word
[2:47:53] that it was commissioned to go into all
[2:47:55] the world and preach the gospel
[2:47:58] baptizing in them in the name of the
[2:48:00] father the son
[2:48:02] and the holy ghost and with the keys to
[2:48:05] the kingdom
[2:48:06] peter knew assuredly that that name was
[2:48:09] the lord jesus christ
[2:48:11] and so father according to the word of
[2:48:13] god
[2:48:14] and the promise of this hour we baptite
[2:48:17] in the name
[2:48:18] of the lord jesus christ amen
