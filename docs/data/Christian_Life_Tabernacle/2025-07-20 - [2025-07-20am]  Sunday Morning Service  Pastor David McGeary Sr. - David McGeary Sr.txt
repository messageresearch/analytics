And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season. His leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

God remains the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have any announcements or written requests here, but if you have one on your heart, you came in the service with something you'd like to make it known to the Lord about the uplifting of your hand, do so and trust that the request you came with, though spoken, is heard loud in heaven. We'll ask brother Daniel Boy to come and pray for these and the brothers take the tithes and offerings if they could please come up. Shall we pray? Almighty God, we thank you. We thank you to be in your presence as we just sang. Father that you are the same God. That's the good things. We have confidence in you knowing that no matter what we going through each one here we believe you are more than able to bring out from that. Father, you know the hand that was lift up. For you seize the heart of men and you are the only one who can recreate and bring things to come to pass for your will and for your glory. Father, we hear especially in this end time. We want more of you. And the only thing that can bring us that is your word. [Music] Father, come and anoint your servant today that he can bring us something that can nourish our hearts so we can be closer to you all the time. Father for the timing and the offering as we are about to give. We give it with joy and thanksgiving in our heart knowing that you the one who bless us with those are needed now. Father I pray that you may come and granted them the desire of their heart. bless this portion of the service you committed unto thy hand in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Marco to come with this special I claim the blood [Music] Jesus shed on Calary. [Music] Oh those precious blessings, oh were made there just for me and for all my sins. my sickness set my pain. Oh my dear, I clean those preious blood stain. Sing it again. Oh, I claimed the blood Jesus shed on Calary. [Music] Oh, and those precious blessings. for men. They're just for me and for my sins, my sickness, and my pain. [Music] When I need I claim those precious blessings. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking back my song, my dance, my joy, my peace, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil's stole from me. One day, old King David came to a city causing clack. And while he was gone, the enemy came in and stole everything he had. Oh, but David encouraged himself in the Lord. He made up in his mind. He said, "I'm on my way down to his cave and I'm taking what's rightfully mine." He said, "I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking back my song, my dance, my joy, and my peace. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. We all know Satan only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. And I must admit, there have been times when he's taken away my joy. Oh, but I'm serving notice on the devil today. His kingdom's under attack. He said, "I'm on my way down to his g. I'm taking what's rightfully mine. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. And I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. I'm taking back my song, my dance, my joy, and my peace. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking back my song, my dance, my joy, and my peace. I'm taking it back. everything that the devil stole from me. [Applause] Let's all stand as we pray to turn our hearts towards service. Let's sing. He looked beyond my faults and saw my need. Amazing grace shall always be of grace. For it was grace that might burn. [Music] Oh, I knew God know why he came to love me. So we let me th I need. Oh, I shall for [Music] my to calary.

[Music] I shall for [Music] my life together [Music] to you the cross when Jesus died for [Music] How [Music] the Gra my falling soul. Hallelujah. [Music] Our heavenly father, Lord, once again we ask you to look beyond our faults. And this morning, Lord Jesus, see our needs for Father, we are promised that you know what we have need of even before that we ask it. You're the great Jehovah Gyra, the supplier of all that we have need of. And Father, though we're encompassed about with such a great enemy, you are a present help in the time of trouble. Father, may each person in here this morning feel your divine love. Father, may they feel your presence. And may they know that it's your hand reaching out to their hearts and their lives. That you're the great shepherd and that you want to guide them from every place of distress and peril. into your sheepfold. Father, may we value that above all things. We ask you to bless those that are come out this morning, our visitors, Father, that you've brought amongst us, Father. May they feel at home. May the we all know that we're part of one great family, one great body, and you're our King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Bless us this morning in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless. You may be seated this morning. And I I I know that uh someone's going to ask me if I shaved and I didn't shave. My whiskers grew backwards and um I I just woke up and there was no whiskers. We have a baby dedication. So anyway, but anyway, so we've got that out of the way. Also, I feel that maybe it's better on my trip to Africa. Um, I just didn't want to have any obstacles, but you've been so gracious to me. I as soon as I get back, I'll probably grow it back. So, thank you. We have a baby dedication today. And uh, Brother Samuel and Sister Naomi and Matthew and Marco want to dedicate their baby brother Micah. The so Micah Bakoli is going to be dedicated and we'd like them to come and I think the grandparents are here. We'd like to invite the grandparents also to come and dedicate their grandson with us. So, uh you're all welcome just to come and be with us. Amen. Let's sing it as we pray. Bring them in. Hallelujah. Oh, bring them in. Bring them in. &gt;&gt; Bring the littlemen. [Music] God bless you. God bless you. Thank you so much. Lord bless you today. This is Micah Naomi boys. Now you got somebody that's more special than you. That's just how it goes. You know what I mean? But we're we're blessed that the Lord blessed them. And I I think he's at peace right now. So I won't disturb him. Uh this is the grace of God to us. You know, every little child is a lets us know that there's life and it's actually a sign of eternal life to us. That there's got to be a life that keeps perpetuating that keeps us going. We know one day that's going to come to an end, but life won't come to an end because the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus. And just think if you have eternal life this morning, think how blessed you are. And if you if you don't know that you have eternal life this morning, maybe God will open your eyes and your heart today. So, we're gonna ask you to dedicate your son, the grandparents. Nice to have each of them with us once again and uh then we'll all pray together. So Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. The benediction material. Benediction. Amen. Amen. Let us all pray. Our gracious Father, this young child that you have so brought into your world, Father, we know that before the foundation of the world, before there was ever a star hung in the sky, that you knew he'd be here this morning, and that we as a people would lift him back to you and dedicate him into your hands. That you would encamp your angels about them and keep them. Father, may he bring this family together in such a unity and love and and joy in their hearts that they are all part of something together, Father, that's been passed from generation to generation. Lord, we just simply ask your blessings upon his life, Father. May he grow and prosper. May he come to know you and know your his calling and will in his life. We ask that you bless this family. Father, may they continue to let the light of the gospel shine. Father, may the the boys raise their little brother and keep a eye on them and watch over them. We ask that you would do all these great things in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We dedicate Micah back to you, Lord. May you receive them now in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you so much. Hallelujah. God bless you. God bless you all. Hallelujah. Amen. The Lord's good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're going to turn this morning in our Bibles. Uh let us stand and we'll just read a scripture this morning. and um and found in Proverbs the third uh I guess chapter of Proverbs and of course Samuel uh uh uh this great writing of of Solomon uh he he's considered one of the wisest men that ever walked on the earth and his instructions has always been put God first. Put God first. And so let us read this uh uh this morning. It says, "My son, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments. for length of days and long life and peace shall be they added to thee. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee. &gt;&gt; Bind them about thy neck. Write them upon the tablets of thine heart. So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy own understanding. And in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path. Father, we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. This morning, we're going to just play a few moments of this message that our messenger preached. Lean not to your own understanding. And you know, that's a uh that's a great word of advice. He said, "Bind the truth and and and righteousness around your neck." In other words, keep it before you all the time. So, it's so important that we understand that we lean not to our own understanding or the way that we perceive things because I think we always got to remember this simple fact is that God knows what we don't know. He knows what we don't know. He knows the beginning from the end. He knows where things started and where things are going. and we don't you know and uh so it's important for us to uh realize that we we seem to have a security in our own understanding that we we feel that when we got a handle on something then things are okay. But you know that's not always the case because uh a lot of people uh are are deceived and and that's what deception is is when someone lies to you. But it's in our nature it says we feel better when we put things in a perspective that we can comprehend. So when we that's our tendency is is we feel comfortable with what we understand. We feel comfortable with what we comprehend. And when we don't understand it and we don't see it and we don't uh feel it in our uh in our our mind then we seem to have a tendency to uh draw back from it. And Solomon's trying to encourage us some. Don't lean to your understanding. Don't lean to those things. You know, write the word of God in your tablets on your heart. You know, follow after him. Put him first and he will direct your path. He will he will tell you which way to go, which way to travel. And we and so many times we don't want to take a step forward uh unless we understand what the result is, what we understand what the outcome is or or until we have some perception of what it is. We don't want to step out what we might perceive in ourself into darkness. You know what I mean? What am I going where what's going to happen? But we've got to remember one thing that everything with God's based on faith. And he tells them, he says, "Trust in the Lord. Trust in the Lord." He'll direct your path. You got to don't lean to your own understanding. Don't lean to how you think things should be or what it looks like because we have a great creator that can change things. And and you know, a lot of times we we'd say it like this. You know, I can see how this could happen. You know what I mean? Oh, I can see it now. I can see how that can happen. Or, you know, that makes sense. You know, or I get it. You know, we've got that that just that desire to be able to hold on to something and because we comprehend it in our mind. And uh and so that it's it's so important to know that that God knows what we don't, you know, just always think of that. And he knows where it come from and where it's going. And so if we could begin to do to do that and and and so we're going to play a little bit, but I'd like to read you just a a a few little statements this morning because, you know, our our understanding really can only go as far as our natural being and our natural senses. So we understand by what we see, what we hear, what we taste. You you know what I mean? And then we go by our feelings, our consciousness. You know, uh you hear that uh saying many time, I have a gut feeling. You know what I mean? Or I I just I just sense, you know, it it's amazing how you can get in a place and and you have a sense of fear. maybe you don't even know why or you become uneasy and and those are all things that are all uh in the natural realm. And I like this statement because it it brought to light something in in my own thinking. It says, I'm just getting to this. The thing is occurring again till man and women and people will learn lean to a certain church that they have joined and belong to. No matter what the word of God says about it, they go right on with that, leaning to their own understanding and ignoring the word of God. Now listen how they ignore the word of God. It It's kind of amazing. It says, "And ignoring the word of God as if it hasn't never even been written." In other words, they ignore it like it's not there to consult. It's not there to read. it's not there to uh look into. In other words, it it's not a source to their understanding. They lean to their own understanding. They lean to their own perceptions. They lean to their their their own uh acknowledgment or they lean to what that they have heard and what that they've been told and what that they've been taught and they just join something and they they they they grab a hold of the understanding and they join the crowd and the crowd just carries them along and they never have sat back man ever looked at what the word of God might have said about it. In fact, it's like the word of God wasn't even written. In other words, there's nothing written on this subject. There's nothing written. Any man that really would sit down and look into the word of God, they would find out there's no there's no there's just not three gods. They they they would look like they would find out that nobody in the scripture had ever been baptized any other way than in the name of the Lord Jesus. So they they but they don't they don't regard it as if it is written. In other words, it doesn't it's it that that's just their approach to it that they're just going to take everything secondhand. And and that's the hardest thing for a church and in our lives that we go through this great battle of of our own understanding. How I understand it, how I see it, how I perceive it. And and Solomon's telling us here, don't do that, son. But look to the word of God. Look to the commandments of God. Look to what God says about it. Put God's thinking. Let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus. And because I know you it's like your only your substance. You like to feel secure in yourself and we don't want to lose that security. We don't want to lose that confidence. We've got to we've almost got to gird ourselves up to go out into the world and hold our ground and hold our stand and and present our thoughts and ideas and and here's we have a great God that's on our side and he's speaking out to us. He said don't lean to your own understanding. Don't put your trust in that. You've got one greater looking after you. You have somebody that's that that is in charge of you. Somebody that has not only loved you, but has left his life for you. And as we heard Wednesday night, placed his blood out in front of you and upon you. And and and he's a good shepherd. And he said he says so he says he says they link to their own understanding ignoring the word of God as it hasn't even been written. It's ungeratized seed of human life. It's got the physical life but no spiritual life in it to be quickened. The veil is over their face. And so I think this morning that's what uh we want to make sure is that the veil is rent. &gt;&gt; You understand? We're wanting to go forward. That's what our whole our whole theme of our heart is is how do we move forward? How do we move from where that we are going forward? And so I'd like to read another statement and I thought this is thing that people that and I'll get to this here a little bit. I'd like to read this. It says now if we're on a gold standard and we are broke now what's going to happen? What is going to happen? Now how many knows that we're broke? So what's going to happen? And listen, I thought this was just so tremendous. He says, he says, "What's going to happen?" You know, the rich people of this nation, these big of factories and whiskey men and tobacco men and so forth like that. It's not going to stand. It's not going to stand to change the currency. It's the only thing we'll have to do is borrow it. And there's only one place you can borrow it. And when we do, we'll sell our birthrights to it. That's right. Now, what are you go what are you going to do? You you are o owned by it. That system, there's nothing else you can do. I thought, you know, they're the our currencyy's broke. So, they're they're they're trying to put in Bitcoin. They're trying to do everything. You know what I mean? They'll they'll do what they've got to do. But listen to this. He says, "Oh people, don't think I you might think I'm crazy, but when my voice is silent in death, these tapes will still be playing and you will recognize that what I've said has come to pass. Now, just think where we're where we're we're sitting this morning. Where where we're sitting this morning. You are the the people that God has chosen &gt;&gt; to see what is coming to pass. There was a people that were chosen to hear it. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And they came on the scene. They were called out of denomination. They sat in the meetings. They heard him preach things. They saw the vindication, the signs and wonders. But now he said, "There's a people that's going to come that are going to hear these tapes and see what I've said coming to pass." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't count yourself out of the picture. Just say, "Oh, I wasn't there." No, you were here. And you were here not to lean to your own understanding, but to watch the word of God come to pass, to to put on the Isab that you might see and to recognize the prophecies and the things that were spoken and the things that were pointed out. Even though they may have been in seed form, we're actually a generations that's sitting here and seeing things that were just talked about. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we could go on uh you know into as it was in the days of Sodom. So I mean just think of of the great uh place that you're sitting and and what it is that God's uh called us to be. He's called us to be the great amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So be it. So it is. This be the truth. And and you're actually have ISAB that you could see. What a blessing. Every believer all down through the ages would have longed to live in the day that you're living. And the challenge of this day, not to lean to your own understanding, not to lean to perceptions and things that are being presented to you as if they are when the truth of the matter is the word of God is what's true. And let's just finish before we play 25 minutes this morning. He says, "For by one spirit we are all baptized into one body." So that's the first thing we understand this morning is we're not divided. God doesn't divide men. Men divide men. And what divides them is their different understandings. One man reads the scripture and he comes up with a different understanding and now he makes a doctrine out of that or he makes a creed out of that. This is what's important. This is the thing. This is the major. This is all that we need to have and another man reads something else and then they can't do on this. You give you give men a math book and they'll all come together more united. You give them a Bible and they'll go more divided because they that man leans to their own understanding. And God's always built his church upon revelation. And God doesn't reveal he he doesn't reveal one truth to somebody else and a different truth to somebody else. He's an unchanging God. Now he'll give measures of revelation. One person may have greater revelation than another person. But that is not attributed to spirituality. It's not attributed to position is just strictly attributed to the grace of God. If I'm true to what God has showed me in little, then little will required of me. If if if God has showed me much, then much is going to be required of me. &gt;&gt; But God's reward is the same for all men because that reward was purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ. It was not earned. He says, "We're baptized into one body and become members of that body. I don't care what brand you've got on you, you know, Baptist Methodist, none of that matters, right? That don't have nothing to do with it. That the only way you can be not by joining, not by creed, not by ex exciting this or reciting this or any other thing, nor by education or theology. You're a Christian when you're born again. And you cannot be born again unless you've been elected to be born again. &gt;&gt; You know, people put tons of pressure on people. Oh, you got to be born again. You got to be If you're not elected to be born again, you can't be born again. But if you're elected to be born again, you will be born again. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? So you you can rest in that. I've heard the call. God's reached his hand down to me. He's telling me it's actually the proof of your election. You can't even look back to where you come from. &gt;&gt; And that's part of what we're going to talk about in a little moment. He said, he said, "Unless you're for no man can come to me except my father draws him." So that's what your question is today. Am I being drawn? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If I'm being drawn, well, good. That means I'm going. I'm moving. God's pulling me. Now, some of us, he's just got to drag. You know what I mean? He's got a You ever see a kid in the store and fights his mama and he's kicking and fussing and she's got her hand and she's just dragging him and going on. You know what I want to do? I want to take my belt off and I want to go over there and I'll straighten that kid out. Oh, delete that from the internet, right? You know, cuz they don't believe, right? Spare the rod and lose the child. You don't have to beat them. You know what I mean? But they they need to know there's a higher authority than their own understanding. Well, we need to know sometime there's a higher authority than our understanding. You know that command's trusting in his his canary brain, &gt;&gt; right? His perception of life, his perception of creation, his perception of the world. He's doing making all his decisions based on what he sees and thinks. And there's a higher power that knows really what's going on. And now we're invited by his grace and mercy to trust in him, put our lives into his hands, and lean not to our own understanding, but let him direct our path. &gt;&gt; How wonderful is that? Amen. He said, he said, "For no man come me except my father draw him." and and all the Father hath given me will come. Amen. And I'll raise him up at the last days. Amen. You know, the Bible said you can believe a lie and be damned by it. See, that's exactly the truth. They form no matter what the word of God says. They lean to their own understanding. They lean on it. They believe it and they think it's the truth. And you can keep believing a lie over and over till it's the truth to you. &gt;&gt; Now you talk about selfdeception. Eve believed Satan's lie as God's truth. It was, you know, the the seduction of Satan wasn't just a snake handing an apple, you know. I mean, I I mean, Eve was not that ignorant, you know? I mean, can you imagine people leaning to their own understanding? They think a snake come out of an apple tree and said, "Eat this apple." And they sit right back there and they've heard a lie so much they never they don't even look at it if if it was even written, you know, and and all of a sudden she realized it's naked. Well, we need to get apples and start passing them out. You know, you know, they just walk up to someone that's walking down the street. Some of these clothes they have on. I don't even know why they buy the clothes. They're all ripped and they got holes in them and everything's not covered, you know, and one shoulder's hanging out and there's no nothing on the back and all the fronts are ripped out and they're so short, you know, and you paid for that. I had painter rags that looked just like that. You go give them an apple. &gt;&gt; But people they hear a lie so much they get they get caught in hearing the same thing over and over and over again. I remember when I came up in this message, I'd hear people say, "Brother Bram said, Brother Bram said this. Brother Bram said that." I heard it so much I thought Brother Bram said it. And then all the message became available to us and we found out there was all kinds of stuff he never said. &gt;&gt; Now listen to what we're talking about. Lean not to your own understanding. Just don't buy something &gt;&gt; because somebody tells you. just don't accept it. You understand that there's there's a place to take everything back to and it's God's word. He said to he says, "But how do we know whether it's truth or not?" God proves it truth because it's his word and he vindicates it. He does his own interpretation of it. Don't lean to your understanding. The Lord will bring it to pass. The Lord will interpret it. The Lord will vindicate it. He will show who has the truth and who doesn't. &gt;&gt; They that wait upon the Lord, they shall renew their strength. You never have to be forced by fear. &gt;&gt; You never have to. You the minute you feel that someone's forcing you to make a a a decision by fear or to join something. The minute that someone ever tells you, "Oh, you don't have the revelation or you don't believe this. You don't have a revelation." That's man trying to give you their understanding as a revelation. and they if you accept that, don't lean to that. &gt;&gt; If you're his, he'll speak to you &gt;&gt; or that little part in your heart, you'll know it's not right. But don't lean to your own thinking. Now, &gt;&gt; the scripture says you can't add to it or take one word from it. Leave it alone. God will vindicate it. You can trust that like he said go. If you acknowledge God in all your ways, he will direct your path. If you acknowledge him in all your ways, acknowledge his existence. Acknowledge his power. Acknowledge his ability. Acknowledge whatever he is. Acknowledge the fact that you're in his hands and you want him to guide you and take you. He'll take you out of all that stuff. There's all kinds of lies out there that have been told about this message, about the prophet, about different doctrines, people selling all kinds of things. You know, he's coming back, he's going to have this, he's going to do that, and and he's God, and and and all this. And there's a whole ton of stuff that nobody's ever taken the time to take this message and study it out for themselves. You're not worried. If God's for you, who can be against you? &gt;&gt; Be still. &gt;&gt; And know that I'm God. &gt;&gt; You don't have to lean to your understanding. You don't have to rush into decisions. Acknowledge the Lord. He'll take care of you. He loves you. He died for you. He elected you. He puts your name on the lamb's book of life. He's not going to leave you nor forsake you. You can rest in his goodness. But what's he do? He vindicates his word and interprets it. How do you how do they do it get to this? They do it by their culture. their education of their understanding of the decree degree of doctor's degrees and so forth that they have come from some certain seminary and they learn these things. How do they get in that condition? How do they do it? culture, education, their understanding, degrees, and doctors and men that present themselves as being smarter and more spiritual. There's no man alive that's any more spiritual than any one of you. They all heard the same gospel you hear. They all were under the same blood that you're under. Don't sell yourself short. He says, and they come from certain seminary and learning these things. But look friends, listen. Nowhere in the Bible are we asked to understand. We are not asked to understand. We are asked to believe it. Believe it by what? by faith. If you understand it, then that makes faith anulled. You can't understand it, but you believe it anyhow. If you could understand God, I wouldn't have to believe God. I do not understand God. No man understands God. I cannot understand the word of God but I accept it. I believe it. I am not asked to under stand it. Now, I know I'm not good uh got a vocabulary to make this set in the way that I want to, but we know that that we're we are always trying to grasp an understanding that we can lean to. It's hard to go forward with faith. He said so that settles it. &gt;&gt; And then when you hear someone that I would think that understood God more than anybody say, "You can't understand God." He didn't ask you to understand it. He didn't ask you to comprehend it. He didn't ask you to know why. He just asked you to believe it. If he said it, you believe it. If he said it, he will bring it to pass. If he said it, it will happen. If it's a promise, God keeps his promise that you don't need to you don't need to compreh anything else. He said, "God will deliver me out of this trouble. He's a present help in the time of trouble. He's a God that supplieth all my needs." I don't understand that. I look in the mirror and I don't think God should give me a second of his time. &gt;&gt; But he chose to put the name on the lamb's book of life. He chose to die for me. He chose to pay the price for my sin. Not something I did. It's not something I earned. It's not something I understand. But until you believe he did it, &gt;&gt; you'll be locked in your own trying to understand the life that God doesn't even attribute to you. &gt;&gt; You're trying to understand a myth. My past is a myth. &gt;&gt; It's a vapor. I don't understand God. No man understands God. I can understand the word of God, but I accept it. I believe it. I'm not asked to understand it. I don't I don't went to no seminary and all these great understandings of man's knowledge on that. I just know that the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I look for him in the same category. I know he promised that he would do it in this day. I look for him to do it and he does it. Is that right? He promised grace. I look for it and receive it. He promised healing. I believe it and I accept it and I receive it. He made a promise in this day and we accept it. Now, we're just going to take, if you would right now, we're going to we're going to just listen as he just told us God vindicates his word. And we're just going to sit back and just for a a moment. We could go on a lot more for we just want to listen to just 25 minutes this morning of leaning not to your own understanding but watching what God does and then we'll come back and close up with just about 15 or or 20 minutes. But let the word of God bless you this morning as we listen and go ahead brothers. Paragraph 171. lean not to your own understanding and we'll just listen. And he starts out with here's a man that leaned to his own understanding. Judas leaned to his own understanding and sold the King of Kings for 30 pieces of silver. Amen. Let's listen this morning. &gt;&gt; There was one man who did lean to his own understanding and his name was Judas Isachare. Oh, he &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. I &gt;&gt; I don't see how he could have done it. &gt;&gt; He had walked face to face with Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Just like Eve did in the beginning. &gt;&gt; He had seen the vindication. He had looked at God in the face like Eve did in the cool of the evening. Eve looked at Christ in the cool of the evening in the garden. And Judas had sat in the cool of the evening in the garden of Gethsemane and many places and had looked at the same Christ had heard him teach prove himself by the word vindicated to be the prophet that Moses spoke of be raised up and told him in the scripture who he was and all about it. They'd seen it proved by God that he was and then he leaned to his own understanding. H &gt;&gt; how could he do it? &gt;&gt; It's because he never had it down here in the first place. &gt;&gt; He wasn't a Germanized seed. &gt;&gt; He was a son of predition. &gt;&gt; Born out of predition, returned back to predition. Now we noticed, but he went out and maybe he might have had an idea of his understanding. He might have thought that Jesus, he had so much respect for him. Now, you know, I might sell him for 30 pieces of silver and if I do, I'll have some money. Now I can do something with that. And he's able to deliver himself. See, he didn't know in the scripture that he had raised up to take that same place. And neither does the people today realize what condition they're in. It's ordained for this lady or see a church to be in this condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Putting Christ on the outside and you knocking trying to get back in. No cooperation, no world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Vindicating his word in the day now like he did in everyday. and they walk right away from it, leaning to their own understanding. That's that's all there is to it. Or maybe, let's say this, that that he thought maybe if he did sell Christ for 30 pieces of silver, well, he would have a a fellowship with some of the great uh denominations of that day, the Pharisees and Sadducees. Uh he'd say, "Now wait, he can take care of himself. I've seen him in great battles. I I know that that he can take care of himself. So, I might make uh some money. kind of a a little retirement as it was and then again I might have a great standing with these churches today if I would betray him to him. See, but he leaned to his own understanding instead of the understanding that that was the vindicated word of God. And he did to Jesus just what the scriptures said he would do. And today the church world has turned Christ out in this last days just exactly like the book of Revelation said they would do it. It's the spirit of Judas again and form of church having a form of godliness but denying the word. That's right now. Oh my. What did it result in? Death. Just like it did to Eve. And it does to all others who tries to uh pervert the word of God and lean to their own understanding. Even now they settle not for 30 pieces of silver but maybe become oh some great officer some seminary experience wouldn't even worth 30 pieces of silver but they sell it anyhow. Sell their understanding of God out for such a thing as that. How different from the great learned St. Paul who had all the knowledge he could brag about. But he said, "I've turned the whole thing of my reasons down. &gt;&gt; I met a pillar of fire one day on the road to the next." Bless the Lord. And he said, "I never come to you with excellency of speech. Because if I did, you'd trust in the wisdom of man. But I come to you in the power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost that you would lean upon the word of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "If an angel from heaven come preach any other thing, let him be cursed." &gt;&gt; Galatians 18. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, sir. He never the little woman at the well, she was immoral. But she knowed that the churches had excommunicated her and but she never leaned upon her own understanding. When she met this one at the well who told her all the sins that she had done, she run into the city. Now, it wasn't right for a woman to do that, to go in and say anything because she was a prostitute. But when she had met Jesus, she never leaned to the understanding of the people that day. She'd come said, "Come see a man who told me the things I've done. Isn't this the very Messiah?" &gt;&gt; She never leaned upon her understanding. No. &gt;&gt; The Virgin Mary, when the angel Gabriel met her and told her that she's going to have a baby without knowing a man, never been. She never leaned up on her own understanding that a woman could not have a baby without having uh a husband. She didn't lean upon that. But she said, "Behold the hands made of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to your word. &gt;&gt; She didn't say, "How am I going to do it? When I'm going to do it, and how's this all going to take place?" The angel said, "The Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee, and that holy thing will be born to thee. Shall be called the Son of God." She said, "Behold, the hands made of the Lord." She didn't take her reasoning said it couldn't be done. She just said, "Behold, the hands made of the Lord." That's right. Notice the the woman that had the blood issue, &gt;&gt; the doctor told her said, "There's no hope." She spent all of her living with the physicians and none of them could help her. And she didn't lean upon that. When Jesus, she walked through the crowd and she said, "I believe if I can touch that man's garments, I'll be made well." She goes over now. Wait. The doctor said you can't get well. She'd had this blood issue for years and years. She got weaker all time and worse. The doctors to give her up. That's all the understanding they had. But she said by faith. There's no scripture telling her to do that. But she said, "If I could touch the border of his garment, I'll be made well." &gt;&gt; And she slipped around and touched him. She walked back, sat down. Jesus turned around said, "Who touched me?" He looked around till he found her. He told her of her blood issue and she felt at that moment in her own body. She couldn't prove it then, but she felt in her own body that her blood issue stopped. She never reasoned. If the doctor had turned her down, how could anything else help her? She never went to reason, but she went to faith. Now, the Bible says that he's the high priest today that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Don't go to reason say oh that's he said today he said he is right now a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities the same yesterday today and forever what do you think when I was out there as a Baptist preacher and that angel of the Lord met me out there and commission me to go do this that I'm doing well my pastor said you've gone crazy what you had a nightmare you I said you better take my fellowship card right Um, now he said, "How can you with not even a grammar school education preach around the world? How can you ever pray for kings and pop takes and you you you can't even use your grammar, right?" I wasn't trusting in my grammar. &gt;&gt; I wasn't trusting in the ability I had. I was commissioned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I didn't go to reasons. If I had to listen to reasons that probably been thousands of people died years ago, but I carried a message exactly like he said around and around the world. And I'm going again by the grace of God. Not by reasons, but by commission. Hallelujah. I lean not. You say you're 55 years old. If I was 95, that don't mean a thing. &gt;&gt; He's still the same God that he was of Abraham. &gt;&gt; That's her. Lean not to your own understanding. And after the sign went forth and the voice followed the churches began to turn me down and close your doors upon doctrine that any of them is daring to stand before me to say it's right or wrong. &gt;&gt; I challenge any of them. &gt;&gt; Not to be smart, but I know where I'm at. &gt;&gt; Right. What did they do? What did they do to shut every door? Now what are you going to do? The other day up on the mountain, I was standing there. I said, "Lord, I got one open door in the whole nation." As far as I know, that's Phoenix, Arizona. He's the only one I got. And I start down off mountain just as plain as I ever heard anybody speak. He said, "What's that to thee? Follow thou me." Not upon my own understanding. I lean upon his promise. &gt;&gt; Oh friend. &gt;&gt; Don't lean upon reasons. Then you cry out with Eddie Puit of all. All hail the power of Jesus name. Let angels prostrate Paul. Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Found him. Lord of all. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't lean upon what you think, what somebody else think. By faith, accept the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Will you do it? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now, it isn't whether somebody else did it or they did do it. But what about you? &gt;&gt; What will you do with this Jesus called the Christ that makes itself known in this day as same as he did in that day? Do you believe him? Let us pray. Lord Jesus, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, God of God. Thank you. God of all potentates, the first, the last, the Alpha, Omega, the beginning and the ending, the bright morning star, the rose of Sharon, Lily, the valley, root and offspring of David. Come Lord God, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Bless this crowd of people, Lord. This is just getting ready to start tomorrow. We've had a little meeting here and you've blessed us in it. You've made yourself known to us. I pray God that you will continue to make yourself known to us. Bless us tonight. Help us now. We are needy people. Lord, thou know us. I don't like to scold people, but how can I hush that holy burning blessing? I don't like to do that. Lord, you know my life, my heart. I must do it. And I pray, God, that you'll help me to do it. Just give me grace and never let me lean to my own understanding, but let me lean upon thy promise in Jesus name. Amen. I want you everyone to be real reverent just for a few minutes. In this crowd of people, there's men and women sitting here, no doubt, who are sick. How many is sick and afflicted in here? Raise up your hands. Just say, "I am in need of God." Just raise up your hand. I'm in need of God. Now, I don't know very many people. I know these three boys sitting right here. I know Mr. Dao and his wife sitting there. I think I think this is Sister Moore. I'm not sure. Is that right, Sister Moore? Outside of that, I guess that doesn't brother Mikey and a platform. That's as far as I see that I know. But the heavenly father who promised and in this day he would vindicate himself in this age just exactly the way he did at Sodom. Did he promise it manifest himself? Do you believe that? Now if you will pray and by faith now don't try to reason how can I touch him as a high priest. Now the Bible said the New Testament he is a high priest right now. He continues a high priest at the order of Melazdc. He's a high priest forever. There's no other high priest but him. No other mediator between God and man but the man in Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. He is the only one and he is the same. yesterday, today, and forever. Now, if he remains that same high priest, and the Bible said we can touch him by the feeling of our infirmities like that little woman did that touched his garment, your faith can touch him tonight, and he'll act the same way in human flesh like he did when he was in human flesh there at at Abraham's oak. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He promised he would do it. I just prayed anybody has a need and I I it's like I said a gift is not something it's like you take a knife and if you want to cut this with it you can cut it or you cut this you can cut it or whatever you want to that's not a gift of God see no a gift of God is some way you have of getting yourself out of the way and gifts and callings are the predestination of God gifts and callings are even without repentance you're born with them a little gear that you pull yourself over in, but you cannot step on the pedal. God has to operate it. You have to get yourself out of the way. Your faith can operate it, not mine. Yours, mine just takes it out of the way. You believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ lives today. Don't lean to your own understanding. You say, "Well, look, I I'm in serious shape, brother. You don't know me. I've been this wheelchair. I've been I don't care what you've been." and see if God won't come down and do exactly like he did when he was here on earth in a physical body. He'll do it in your body and my body together as a unit believing in him. He'll do it because he promised he would do it. I don't lean to what somebody says, "Oh, that's that's uh mental telep are places we don't have to have that to come up and lay hands on people. We laid hands on them last night. But the only thing you have to have is faith and then recognize by faith you accept it. by faith. Not not anything is don't say, "Well, how can it be done?" If I could tell you how it was done, then it wouldn't be no more faith. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's done. I don't know, but I believe it. I I don't know how how uh God saves a sinner, but he does it. I don't know how God does any of these things, but I accept it. He He does it. That's way because I can't explain it now. Well, I never will be explained. No one can because if you do then there's no more faith. I don't see how God and Christ could be the same person. But they were. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Scripture said, "You can't explain it." But they were. &gt;&gt; My father is in me. It's not me doing the works as my father in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I do not his works, then that shows I'm not of him. But if I do his works, then he testifies himself that I'm of him. Well, &gt;&gt; it's the same thing now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Exactly the same thing. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. If you'll believe me. Now, there's a man sitting right here before me. He's got dark hair. He's got a watch on his arm, a dark suit. He's wearing glasses. You can look right here. You see me sitting there with his eyes closed praying. I don't know that man. That heavenly father knows I don't know him. But I'm just going to look to him this pre because he look like he's so sincere saying there ever since I made mention that man just closed his eyes and started praying. That man is a stranger to me. That's to my hands. I don't know him. God knows that man and he can reveal to me if that promise is true in the Bible. He can reveal to me what that man's got his eyes closed for and what he's praying about. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, sir? Uh, if you open your eyes, you're sitting right here. Look right here. You believe that? Now, you know, I don't know you. We're strangers to each other, but God knows you. I started crying. We because I can tell him now that God's going to answer his request. See, because that was what struck him to then that light from darkness changed to light. Now the man, he's praying for somebody else. And that's this little boy sitting over here by his son right now. That little boy is suffering with a a stomach disorder and also something wrong with his intestines. Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus, that's such a good &gt;&gt; They're not from here. You're not from Arizona. You're from California, right? And you're a minister and your fellowship is with the Assemblies of God. That's true. Reverend Mccay is your name. A Reverend K. That's right. Is that true? Wave your hands like this. Now, your little boy is going to get well. Your faith. Now what? Now there's the man with his hands up. He knows me. I don't know him. But what was it? He touched the high priest. &gt;&gt; Now see, he couldn't lean to his owner. Now what he's got to do, what does he do now? He's got to believe that what was told him the truth because he knows he knows not me. &gt;&gt; That's right. Here, here sets a woman sitting right down here in front of me. Also, she's got her head bowed. She's suffering with a cancer. She also comes from California. I hope she don't miss this. Miss Adams, that's her name. I never seen her in my life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. There's a lady sitting right back out here. I can't just put my point to her, but I see the light hanging over. She's deeply in trouble. She got trouble with her neck for one thing. And another thing, she's she's got uh a spiritual troubles where she's troubling about. And she's got a domestic trouble. Her daughter just run away. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true, isn't it? She's got her hand up, Miss Miller. That is right. You believe God will send her back, heal your body. I never seen her in my life. She's a completely a total stranger. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [Music] Here's a lady sitting here, the audience. She She's not from here. She also is from California. She's got cancer and the cancer is on her breast. She's been operated on one breast and it's went to the other. Right, Miss Ken? That is right. You believe it. God will make you well. &gt;&gt; You believe it. I'm a stranger to you, lady. I don't know you. &gt;&gt; That's true. She's camp. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might know that God is present. There's a lady sitting right next to her. Her name is Mrs. Harris. She's a total stranger to me. But when the spirit struck this woman, she also in sympathy with her. And she comes from California. That's right. And she's got trouble with her shoulder. That's right. You believe that God will heal you. If that's true, raise up your hand so the people can total stranger. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lean not to your own understanding. What can do that? You can't explain that. That's a paradox. &gt;&gt; It's beyond explaining. Ask those people. And I never seen them in my life. Never know nothing about them. It could just go on through the I mean, but now look, don't lean to your own understanding, but lean to what he promised that he would do that. If that isn't the same spirit that was dwelling in human flesh that know that Sarah laughed in the tent behind the man. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And he promised just before the world was destroyed with fire when the son of man would reveal himself again in like manner as it the son of man prophetic would reveal himself in human flesh like he is here with us tonight as he did then. &gt;&gt; Now what hour are we living in? just near the destruction. &gt;&gt; Friends, don't stand in here no longer a sinner. Accept Jesus Christ while you're in his presence. &gt;&gt; Now, I know usually it's customary for ministers to make please and tell stories about mother that's dead and gone on. That's all right. But we don't come upon the basis of our mother being dead. My mother's dead too. My father also. But we come up intelligently accepting upon the basis of God manifesting himself in Jesus Christ to take away the sins of the world. We come and believe upon the atonement. And while he has a vindicated his word, I don't care what church you've gone to, Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, Presbyterian, or no church at all. If you will admit that you have understood it different and know that you really never have been born again but you want to be and want to accept it now the promise now you might not be filled now but you will be filled when the as the meetings goes on you want to accept it upon those bases would you stand up to your feet let me just offer prayer for you right where you're standing everyone in here that knows don't lean on your own say I spoke in tongues that don't have nothing to do with it I believe in speaking in tongues too But I've seen witches, devils, and everything else speaking tongue interpretation. [Music] That's right. Ask the missionaries down here. We can find out. Brother Creature, you know that's right. I've seen him speak in tongues and drink blood out of a human skull. Call him the devil. Sure. I've seen them lay a pencil down and they get up and write in unknown tongues and a w the wizard stand there and interpret it. So speaking in tongues is no sign you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. that if you speak in tongues and deny this word, there's something wrong somewhere. &gt;&gt; Don't lean to your own understanding. Somebody might you say, "Well, I shouted." I do, too. &gt;&gt; But don't lean to that. I've seen all kinds of demon power shout and scream. I've seen Muhammads shout and scream till they work theirel in such a place they can run splinters through their hands in India. I've seen them scream and jump up and down and take balls of water with hooks in it and push it through their skin and walk on hot fire coals. Right? Denying Jesus Christ. See, don't lean to your own understanding, but upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; If your life doesn't cope with this Bible to believe every word that's in there, and you want to believe it and want God to work his will through you because you can be a part of God, will you stand and say, "I will accept it right now, brother." Thank you. Thank you. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. Wonderful. God bless you. May God grant you all these sincere. You say just just keep standing. just you see &gt;&gt; now it's it's based upon that that I'd just like to close up with just uh uh a thought about this message and our approach to it. And you know, so many times our approach to life is is our life. We we look back and we look at what's around us. That's our our nature. We're trying to perceive what's going on. We're trying to understand our lives. We're trying to understand the way out and and our our the whole uh the whole comprehension if I could say it uh uh uh that way of where that we are and and we want to go forward from where that we are. I I want to be more spiritual, right? I I I have my natural life, but he said that there was a spiritual life and and I want that man to grow. &gt;&gt; We We have the outer man and then we have the inner man and the flesh wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. And if I'm not careful, I get caught up in that battle and I'm trying to understand it. I'm trying to figure out a way out of it. I'm trying to uh I'm trying to struggle to to understand myself and understand why I'm that way. And I find that that in in doing so that I'm not looking forward. Do you understand? But I'm just I just am looking I'm looking back and I'm looking around. And I I I thought of this uh so much because I I noticed something in in life. And I noticed uh something that has become a a great um move in our our country and our and business and everything. And it's it's what they call a life coach. And executives and companies are hiring what they call life coaches. you know, someone that will sit down and and not a therapist like does distinguishes a a a mental condition, but it it's someone to help people navigate through life's situations and circumstances. So they want to someone that can sit down and talk it over with them and and and reason it out with them and and give them perspective and and it's become a multibillion dollar business. People are looking for a life coach, somebody to help them move forward. So we have the whole world out there who who now is in such a struggle. They they they they've got this uh artificial intelligence that uh uh you know people are afraid of. You know it's going to do away with jobs. You know now they have articles are out there everywhere. uh you know if if you if you choose this career it's going to be gone in five years if you if you do this you know these are certain jobs that AI won't take over you know they show a guy with the jackhammer and they show a guy with a you know don't don't man will try to do everything you know they got a machine and you can just do like this and it goes over and the arm comes something jackhammer or something and you sit back there and do it, they can fly a drone into your window in your house. People are being bound by fear. Life's become so uncertain to them. But but we just listen for a few moments this morning of something that was so sure and so proven. God made a promise in his word. Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7, Malachi 4:5. in this last day that God would do the same works that he did in the ministry of a son of man that he would prophetically come back in the office of the prophet and do the same things that Jesus did when he was here that the Gentiles would be able to see the same thing come to pass. &gt;&gt; And he did it right &gt;&gt; and we witnessed it. We heard it. Those people existed. I thought that somebody brought it up preaching the other day about, you know, all these names were written right there. But no, they wait till those people aren't there to ask anymore. You know, I believe brother uh Ronnie uh he heard the story. He just came to the message. He heard the story of Haddie, right? I believe it was. And he called her up, talked to her on the phone. And she said, "That's exactly right. I was sick. I was in this condition. Brother Bram Cra me and bore witness to it." But but people nowadays they actually lean to their own understanding and it causes them they're so to the place you understand that they've got to be able to use their mind and think about it and perceive about it. They don't want to let go into the arms of faith. They don't even want to believe that they're called, that they're elected, that they're chosen. Their their understanding has to come up with some way to measure that. There is no measuring it. &gt;&gt; He says, I've accepted it on one basis only that God said so. I can't explain it. I don't know why. He said, "A gift isn't something you can put the press your pedal on and make it happen. It's getting yourself out of the way and letting God do it." I've seen it many times in my life. People come for prayer. I just pray and in my prayer, I might say, "Lord, help this person. You know, they've got all the troubles they have at home, their children, whatever." I just say the prayer and it's exactly what they need. That ain't man. You don't know that. You can't figure that out. You don't understand it. But we not we don't go by that. But you got the whole world nowadays looking to grasp a way forward. &gt;&gt; True. And so they're seeking out people to advise them. And that's the blind leading the blind. &gt;&gt; They're paying billions and millions of dollars. Corporations are hiring what they call life coaches. So, the people can go in and sit in and have uh the life coach motivate them. Here's some of the things that they hire a life coach to do. If you're frequently irritable, they figure you need a life coach. If you have high levels of stress or anxiety, inability to break bad habits, lack of fulfillment in your social life, persistence, feelings of dissatisfaction at work, a sense of blocked creativity. It says, "In recent years, life coaches have gained more mainstream recognition. A growing number of creative executive entrepreneurs are now trying to life coaches turning to life coaches to help them attain success in their professions and their personal lives. They're looking for him to help them make decisions, deal with obstacles and relationships, work their way through uh different difficult situations. They they they need they need a life coach. And I I thought back and I sat there and I thought, you know, Lord, maybe that's what I need. I I I've got I need a life coach. I need someone to coach my life, to tell me how to work through this and tell me how to work through that and and and you know, talk it over with and and and all all those things. And I realized, he says, "Yeah, but why is that?" Because you you you you don't look forward. You don't look to what's coming. You don't look to what's ahead of you. You feel you need a life coach. And then it just struck me like like I can't sleep. I've got a life coach [Applause] &gt;&gt; that this message &gt;&gt; was sent to be my life coach, &gt;&gt; you know. But sometimes I don't look at it that way. I I don't look at it as somebody as a message that God's given me to coach my life. In sports, they have a coach. And the coach looks for little things that you can do and you can change. Quarterbacks, it's all about your footwork. You know, in other words, how that you come away from the the football. a guy that throws the ball. If he comes back a certain way, everybody knows it's a pass. So, the defensive m linemen are there and they're looking at his feet. And if he starts this mo motion right off of the thing, they know it's a pass. So, the coach teaches them how to come back in such a manner that they don't know whether it's a pass or not. So, they don't know if it's going to be play action. You didn't know to look at the feet, did you? You know what you needed? You needed a coach. See, all the things that get by in life and so they they they go back a different way so they can make a fake for a play action. So, can all a experience. So they have all these little things in basketball. You know, a team won a championship because the coach gave the guy one word of advice. He said, "Everybody knows that when you dribble the ball and you lean in with your shoulder that you're going to go step back and do a drop back pass." He said, 'Why don't you instead of leaning in with your shoulder and stepping back, just leaning your shoulder and go to the basket, you just might draw the foul. And he took that advice from that life coach. Brother Brandham used the example of sports, so I'm okay. But I want you to understand. And so he did that. He went he leaned in his shoulder and like he did 990 times before, he didn't. He went to the basket, drew the foul, won the championship cuz somebody gave him the little steps in life. how to deal with adversity, how to deal through situations. And I thought back, you know, I just sometimes I don't go to the message and listen to the message, not just for what I believe. And I I keep listening to the message as it's talking about the past and as it's talking about the present, the conditions that things are in, where it came from, what he dealt with. But I never understood that along with that in that message is a love letter. It's him whispering secrets in my ear. In other words, he's actually being a life coach to me. &gt;&gt; If I can begin to perceive it that way, &gt;&gt; if I be can begin to listen to it that way, if I can begin to say this isn't just something that was, &gt;&gt; this isn't something that's just a point out how things are. This is something that can lead me forward and make me achieve that which I desire to achieve. Give me satisfaction in my life. Give me satisfaction in my work. Help me get through every difficulty and everything. It is my life coach. &gt;&gt; And I thought I just started thinking of some of the titles of the message. perseverance. A life coach would sit there and tell me, you know, don't expect results. You got to stick with it. What are they trying to do? Encourage them, lift them up, support them. You know, I found out with God, everything from him is free. How about if that's that doesn't just become a thought about all the guys that pert but what happens when that becomes a life coach to me and man it's not telling me about perseverance and about those who persevered and about those who overcame you know but I start looking at it as wait this is my life coach telling me I need to stick with things that I start. &gt;&gt; I don't need to run from pillar to post. &gt;&gt; People get life coaches so they can find their calling. They have all kinds of questions so people say, "What am I called for? I I want fulfillment beyond my job. because they're hungry. And then I said, I thought, I've got a life coach. This message is not only the fulfillment of the word of God, but he promised me he'd be a counselor, &gt;&gt; the prince of my peace, &gt;&gt; that that he would lead and guide me into all truth and righteousness. That he'd give me peace that surpassed understanding and joy unspeakable. All these things that these people are looking for a life coach to give to him, we have. &gt;&gt; And he it wasn't a life coach from another age. It was a life coach in our age. And he gave us the word for our age. I thought of of of not just a a sermon, but looking at this sermon as a way of advice to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; A way of advice for me to go forward. A way of advice. In other words, this sermon is coaching me. &gt;&gt; It's telling me of things I can do, things I can change, a way I can have a different approach and a positive approach. In other words, it's not, oh, this is a good story or this is a good sermon. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. It becomes more to me. It becomes the coach of my life. &gt;&gt; Now it's active. &gt;&gt; It's active in my determinations. It's active in my approach. It's active in my thinking. I'm taking this word. I'm telling you that sometimes we don't even bring this message to the great quality and ability and power and recognition that it deserves. &gt;&gt; It's become something that's gone by &gt;&gt; instead of something that's calling us to go forward. &gt;&gt; This is the way to move forward. It's not what we ought to be. It's not what we should be. It's not what we were. But it's how do I go forward, Lord? How do I go forward? How about He just preaches a message called thinking men's filter. What is that? That's a coaching lesson. A life coach would sit down to you and say, "Now, the first thing you got to do is filter out all these other things. &gt;&gt; Get rid of the static. I got I can listen to one tape for free and get all that advice, &gt;&gt; but if I'm not looking at the tape or the word of God as a life coach, I heard on the radio the other day, they said, "Oh, our psychics, only 90% of the people that apply for Our thing can be a psychic. California psychic. I thought if you were psychic at all, you wouldn't live in California cuz you'd know that thing's gone. But for just $20, you can have 20 minutes of a life coach. You know who one of the first life coaches was? Dear Abby, astrology, all these things totally unvindicated. one man's understanding, sharing one man's understanding with another man. And so you accept my understanding and the way I look at it and the way I take it. Oh, okay. I'll try that. And yet we have someone that sat right there and said, "If you filter it through God's word, a thinking man will filter things through God's word." In other words, look to God's word first. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't lean to your own understanding. Here's the life coach telling us, you want to move forward. You want to be successful. You want to get to the rapture. I am going to coach your life. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave you. I'm not going to forsake you, but I'll be with you even in you the end. I'll send you another life coach. And he shall lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness. Another comforter. And I thought, "What are these life coaches? They're comforters. Oh, you can make it through. &gt;&gt; You can get through this. &gt;&gt; You've got the goods." &gt;&gt; And they walk out of that life coach pumped. I'm going to do this. They're going to go sell more. They're going to go do this. And I thought, here we are trying to go forward and we've never really comprehended, forgive me if I'm wrong, maybe it's me, but we've never comprehended God gave us a life coach. And he put his lessons down, you know, he talked he talked about perseverance. He talk about a think a man's filter. He says you want to be successful. Don't be ashamed of him. Don't be ashamed. He preaches ashamed of him. And he talks all about how this person wasn't ashamed. That person wasn't ashamed. What's he doing? That isn't just talking about people that assume. He's giving us a life lesson, &gt;&gt; a lesson to achieve what it is inside of us. Forgive this explanation and the way I'm going to say this, but the scripture said when they found a tree that was none, wasn't fruitful and the the guy wanted to cut it down, he said the husbandry, the gardener, the guy that wants to care for that tree, he wants to dig it up and dung it or fertilize it. And I thought, we've got the great husbandry &gt;&gt; if we're not fruitful. He wants to give us fertilizer. &gt;&gt; And I don't mean that in a negative or thing, but he's our life coach, &gt;&gt; to put life into our roots, &gt;&gt; to put life into our earth, to dig us up, &gt;&gt; to loosen the soil around us, and and and to put the nutrients. And the prophet of God called it spiritual vitamins. &gt;&gt; But see, we we haven't perceived him as a life coach. We haven't perceived him as the goto source in every circumstance. When these people get discouraged, they get defeated, they run to their their uh uh their their life coach, their analyst. What's the word I'm looking into? The they their counselors, their therapists. &gt;&gt; How you doing today? Oh, the lady at work, you know, she done this. Well, how does that make you feel? Well, it makes me feel like I'm replaceable. Oh my goodness. We had a life coach that said, "Nobody can take your place." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we don't look at him as a life coach. We don't look them at as somebody that's given them instruction. We look at the present and we look at the past. And we have somebody that's trying to take us forward and give us every secret of life, every little analysis, every little thing we can do. How to deal with our neighbor, how to deal with the guy at work, how to deal with that, how to deal with this, how to deal with the relationship, how to deal with what you see in the mirror. &gt;&gt; It's all there. I mean, he preached sermons like perfect strength and perfect weakness. &gt;&gt; What did he say? You don't have to be perfect. &gt;&gt; You don't have to trust in your ability. What a life coach lesson. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm a failure. I've got so many weaknesses. I can't walk out that door out here and preach to these people. You know, I've done this in my life and I'm that and all that. And my life coach sits there. He says, "My strength is made perfect in weakness. &gt;&gt; Walk out. Trust them. &gt;&gt; I'll be there for you. &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you nor forsake you. I'll stand in between you and the people breaking the word of life to their heart." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My strength is made perfect in weakness. Perfect strength, imperfect weakness. The lower you are, the greater he is. Thank you, Lord. That's not just a theory. That's a life coach lesson. People pay thousands of dollars to have somebody tell them that. And I can do it with a press of a button. &gt;&gt; I can do it by opening a pamphlet. &gt;&gt; I can sit there and say, "I don't understand." And my life code says, "You'll never understand God." &gt;&gt; I won't. No. He says, "I don't understand God. I just believe him." And I think, "Oh my goodness, &gt;&gt; I've been trying to wrap my head around God." &gt;&gt; And then the life coach tells me, "The kingdom of God is within you. That you can neither comprehend the beginning nor the end of it." &gt;&gt; And I thought, "What's he coaching me to do?" Trust me, &gt;&gt; I got your back. Everybody talks about I got your back, buddy. You run into the flames. I got your back. Well, why don't we just switch the role? You run in the flames and I'll get your back. Well, I don't trust you to get my back. He's got our back. Think of it. No, he's just not. He's just not giving you something to believe. He just didn't lay this out, preach all this, put it all on tape, right? Go to the Bible, do all the signs and wonders he did, and give it to you as a package to say, "Believe this. This message is not that weak. It's more than that. It's a road mapap. It's a stepbystep guidance of the Holy Spirit to coach your life to give you every little move, every little thing you can change &gt;&gt; to to from learning to say good morning &gt;&gt; to drop in on I love you every now and then. You know, little things. I heard a story one time. A couple was driving down the road and in their pickup truck and and and the lady over there saw a young couple sitting there and he was driving and she was sitting next to him and she said, "Oh, look, dear. We used to be like that." And he looked over and he says, "I'm sitting where I've always sat. You know, sometimes it's just buying ISAP. &gt;&gt; See, we're not at war with the people that don't believe this message. &gt;&gt; We're not condemning the people that don't believe this message. It doesn't do you any good. He said they they're they're they're ungerant tied seed. They got life. They lean to other things. But you don't lean to your understanding. When you judge and you criticize, that's your own understanding. You don't need to do that. It doesn't help you with your life. And so we got this beautiful life coach. He says he says you know recognizing the day and its message. Now if I would say to you recognize the day and its message everybody if I would say describe the message to me everybody would go back to the teachings of brother Brown. But in the message he's telling us it's not his message that's the flashing red lights. He says the world in its condition is a message to you. &gt;&gt; The very world is a message to you of where we are. What time it is that we should get ready. In other words, it's time for us to take on the life coach and start letting him make the changes in our approach, in our personality, in our nature, in our decision making. That's going to help us navigate. We want to go up the ladder. You can actually progress in your business by simply listening to the word of God and putting God first. I know a man that moved here just so he could take communion and he liked to starve to death, but he hung on to God's word and God gave him this job and this job and this job that you know now he don't do nothing. Got a good job. He does something but you know what I mean. I think most of the time he's in air condition. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's what God does. &gt;&gt; You've got a life coach right here. You know, he says, you know, recognizing the day in its message, re the flash, you recognizing, sit back. The life coach is telling us, look around, see where you're at, understand it, understand your position, your place. You were put here to see. You were put here to see it coming to pass. I don't wish for another day. I wish for the day that I'm in. And I have a coach, a life coach that's going to give me every little secret, every little way to change my approach, to change my attitude, to change my voice, to change my saying. It's all in there. It's in pages after pages. You can go through. It's in sometimes the first 10 minutes of a sermon or the last little bit. He lays all these great secrets of life out. You know, convinced and concerned, the greatest battle that's ever fought. All those things are more than sermons to the believer. They're our life coach. God's coaching our life, trying to take us from the condition that we're in in our present state to a higher state. It's one thing to realize you're in a hole, and it's another thing to understand that God's going to give you the steps to get out of it. &gt;&gt; Say you're sorry. &gt;&gt; Don't hold a grudge. If you got a against anybody, go make it right. If somebody draws a circle and puts you out, draw a bigger circle and put them in. You know, think it not strange, the fiery darts of the enemy. These are not just sermons. They're not something just to identify the present condition. They're things that are to give us and put in our mind because the right mental attitude towards emn promise of God will bring it to pass. The right approach is so important with God. The right atmosphere, all these things are are things that are there. And my my heart's desire this morning is that we don't lean to our own understanding. But we realize that we have a life coach. Can I give him another word? A comforter. One that'll lead us and guide us in all truth. We've got the Holy Spirit just like an anointing, like a sensation, like a feeling, like something. It's more than that. It's our guide. &gt;&gt; It's our leader. It's our life coach. It's we can come up to say, "How do I deal this? How do I get out of this rut I'm in or the funk that I'm in?" Or, "I just can't seem to overcome. I I I got a depression. I I can't get there." And and these people go there and they sit and they spend all this money and they get asked all these questions and that person doesn't want them to get better because the minute you get better, you're not come see me no more. So I'm going to give you just enough to keep you sick. I don't want that kind of life coach because it's given to me to overcome. And he preaches a message, the life coach does, how can I overcome? And I find out I actually have somebody something that was given to me that was more than just a message from a prophet. It was more than just an event that took place, the son of man. It was actually him coming and telling all his sheep and all his children, I will not leave you nor forsake you, but I'll be with you even in you till the end. And I will not leave you comfortless. I will come again and I will coach you in the ways of all righteousnesses. I will coach you and guide you so you can get through every adversity. Church, this message is more than I've ever dreamed it could be. &gt;&gt; It's everything &gt;&gt; to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; He loves you. He'll not leave you. He will not forsake you. But he promised he would coach you even till the end. God bless you. Let's stand this morning. [Applause] Oh, we need a coach, don't we? You know, I always admired professional athletes, tennis players, golfers, baseball players, and come to find out, every single one of them's got a personal coach. They got coaches. Some teams have 30 coaches to find every little thing. I've got one coach. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the person of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; guiding me in his word and he'll get us all the way through. Let's bow our heads this morning. Maybe you'd like just to turn your heart to him this morning and say, "Lord, I'm in places that I really don't want to be, and I need you to coach me further down the road. When a person has a life coach or a therapist, they set time aside and they make an appointment and they go in and they sit down and they talk all their troubles, all their fears, all their doubts, and they talk it over. [Music] And Lord, that's just one man to another man or one woman to another woman or vice versa, whatever it is. And they're getting one man's opinion. But Lord, I can come and sit on your couch and you'll tell me things that nobody else knows. You'll speak to my heart and tell me what I should do or what I should stop doing. And Lord, it's a free session and your door is always open anytime, any place, anywhere. And Lord, I've not entered into that relationship with you like I should of you being my coach and my counselor, my guide. And this morning, I'd like to lift my hand to you and say, Lord, I'd like to start a closer relationship with you, Father. One more of you leading me and guiding me in the steps of life, instructing me in all truth and righteousness. [Music] Father, casting my cares upon you because you care for me, Lord. This message is more than just the truth of all the doctrines. It's more than the fulfillment of every promise in every scripture. It's you personally guiding each one of your children. Like a father and mother raises her child. Father, you raise us up. And father, I feel maybe in my heart [Music] that I I have left that part out of my life. I left that part out of this message that it's more than law. It's more than what's right and wrong. It's full of secrets of my success. It's full of secrets of my peace. It gives me a heavenly understanding. It molds my nature that we can be like you. It guides my footsteps. And as you spoke, Father, and you said in in this great scripture reading that we read, you said, "Acknowledge the Lord in all thy ways. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy path. Father, I want to invite you today to be the director of my path. If you'd like and you feel that in your heart this morning, you'd like just to lift your hand to him. Say, "Lord, I'd like you to be more of a director of my path." Lord, I'm inviting in coming to your office this morning. asking that you would be my life coach, that you would speak to me from your word and bring to me the truths that would make me a a a a more loving person, a kinder and gentler person that the fruits of your spirit may show forth in my life. Lord, we place our hands up those that have have their hands raised. Father, most people are fine. They don't need you that much, but Father, I do.

Trust we all enjoy that. We'll invite brother Andrew at this time to close our service in a word of prayer. It was good to be in the house of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; I'm just rejoicing in the realities of what our pastor speaking. And it just what a privileged people we are to know that we have a guide. Just a great reminder of that great life that God has inside of us all that he wants to have that grand fellowship. And let us bow our heads together. Father, we thank you for the the promise of your presence, Lord, to Lord, renew our mind and to help us to understand that the way we perceive it is not reality. But your word, Lord, it gives us life. And so we're thankful, Lord, that not only did you reveal, Lord God, that there's life after death, but Lord, you're the God of life and the God of resurrection. So, oh God, we thank you that when we look back or look around, Lord, that's not where our vision is, Lord. But we look to the fulfillment, Lord, of your promise in our lives. And so, Father, Lord, we just want to surrender ourselves more and more, Lord, and to this great reality, Lord, and to go to the storehouse and let you lead us, Lord, to be that life coach, Lord. Father, we ask your mercy and grace upon this people as we go, Lord. Lord, it was good, Lord, to hear once again the the words of life and how it makes such a difference. We pray you bless our pastor and we pray you'd strengthen him and continue to pour out your grace and the abundant revelation, Lord, that we can grow in grace and we can grow with one another, Lord, and to see the way you see it, Father. So as we go about our different ways, Lord, we pray you'd bring us back together that we can, oh God, come with an expectation, Lord, that you have a double portion for us today. Lord, we ask your blessings upon your people as they go and we go rejoice and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are dismissed. Let's sing. I've never been sorry since I trusted his name. Ever since Jesus saved and pardoned, I've been singing every day. I've never been sorry that I trusted his name. And through the dark shadows, he is with me, guiding me on this earth way. I've never been sorry that I trust in his name. Oh, I've never been sorry that I trust in his name. Oh, every moment I find he's exactly the same. Oh, my soul has been saved since the Savior came. Oh, I've never been sorry that I trusted his name. Oh, all long I sore. Praising him for my Christmas. I've never been sorry. And I trusted his name. And surely I know my way in heaven. I've never been sorry. I trust in his name. Oh, I've never been sorry. that I trust in his name. Oh, every moment I find him, he's exactly the same. Oh, my soul has been singing since the Savior came. Oh, I've never been sorry that I trusted his name. I am probably the star of all the sun. Maybe my mind went brighter. I've never been sorry that I trusted his name. Oh, never thought of sacrifice. Jesus is with me. I've never been sorry that I trusted his name. I've never been sorry that I trust in his name. Oh, every moment I find him, he's exactly the same. Oh, my soul has been singing since the Savior came.
