is going to be my birthday birthday and uh I'm turning 64 and Clayton the Lord Clayton don't live that long so it's really a major accomplishment for the family um but a real quick testimony I just wanted to thank God for his goodness and and for his Mercy um um I was thinking today um how I ended up playing this instrument and in a real quick testimony I was in kindergarten and all the kids we were we were lined up around the wall and uh uh the teacher came out and she had all these instruments in a sack and she was passing them out and and so I could see a instrument that looked like this so I that's what I wanted so when she got to me I reached for it and she said no and she gave me a drum and I don't have any rhythm you know uh in the world when I was in the world call myself I dance like George Jefferson for some of you who might so I have no rhythm at all so anyway uh that's I guess that's why I became a message believer you know you can't dance so anyway um so that bothered me all of my life so when I turned 40 I look back over my life and I realized the things that I hadn't accomplished and I reached for that instrument and the lady wouldn't give it to me so at 40 uh I went down to the music store and I told the guy and behind the counter I wanted to buy this he said well do you play I said no he said you want to buy this I said yeah I want to buy that that's what I want to play and you know he wanted to make his commission so he sold it to me and uh so I took it home and uh with no Talent no ability and it sounded like somebody killing a cat um I wish I was like brother John I told him the first time I met him see when we were standing in line to meet God he got my voice and all of my talent uh but uh I sound like a seventh grade girl and I play like a seventh grade girl but uh I brought it home and I kept blowing it and blowing it and finally I got some sound to come out of it and and so but anyway to me this is a major accomplishment for me to finally reach out and get that instrument that the lady wouldn't give to me so uh but anyway I'm going to attempt by the mercy of God to play uh all of creation and it's by a group called Mercy Me It's TR [Music] to oh we need glasses can you see my way out they're working on [Music] it could you turn it up could you start it [Music] over track two and a little louder two cuz you started

you tonight and we just ask you to bless our time of Fellowship together may we be encouraged father may we come to the faith that you provided for us father the revelation of what great part we play and what our position is we just ask that you'd Lift us up tonight in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen let's read our scripture in Romans tonight we won't be long we had a little more of a lengthy service this morning but um we just we we felt there was a few things that we wanted to make sure we understood and and so in Romans the uh uh uh 12th chapter we've read this uh verse it says I beseech ye therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but ye be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God father bless your word in your name we pray amen you may be seated and we know that the the word means uh transformed meanss to be made different to be made different and so we see a great secret here is if we can uh renew our mind or if I could use a word change the way that we think we can come to find out what the perfect and acceptable will of God is and I think that's what we all want no matter what our difficulties are we want to be in God's will there's just a part of us that uh we want to do what's right uh we know that there's a heaven to shun and a heaven to gain and too many times our thinking is I just don't want to go to hell but God's got more of that than that for us and so we want to pick up uh where we left off this morning and and uh just follow along I hope in this next few minutes you can uh uh understand what it is that we're talking about if faith I believe there was kind of an old type of faith that we had to have in days gone by and it it was more of a hope so or of a hanging on to you know I believe God can I believe God can I believe God will and and if I could say that that was sort of the only Faith uh that we could have but when the time came of a restoration of faith and a Ministry to restore back the Faith of Our Fathers we begin to see that there was a a a a greater understanding of faith and that Faith was a revelation amen and it was not something that you were hoping for but it was actually a substance that you could lay hold of and have and our Prophet would would would give testimonies and and and make Faith so real to us that we could almost feel like we could reach out and grab it and take hold of it how many times when you would sit back and listen to a prayer line or listen to a discernment and it would just feel like he was actually Discerning you or he would mention the very uh problem that that you had and you could actually feel his presence right there with you like like he was standing in the room and I believe he was and and he would touch you and and and you would become well and and it was a a a wonderful uh uh just uplifting of his spirit and so there's and so our faith if I could say this is is in not so much in the promises haven't changed but it's our approach to those promises why there are promises not just because they're what that we have need of but actually those promises are what we are and and as we read this morning we begin to to to have uh uh we heard some very tremendous statements and one of the things that we heard was what what the seed of life was what the seed of life was was the word of God so the word of God's what produced life and then we went on and and we realized it said here that I believe the Bible is the word the whole truth and Jesus is the word made manifest and his word is one and the same so his word he and his word are one in the same another Jesus wasn't preaching something and living something else he preached what he was so the things that Jesus preached was what he was when he said turn the other cheek we saw him that's exactly what he did he had 10,000 angels He could have called down and delivered them from the cross but but he if I could say that he turned the other cheek for for our sake and and so we we we we looked at that and we said and he and his word is one and the same and what was he now look he was that seed and remember the the seed is what to bring forth of its own kind so he was the one that was going to bring forth of his own kind so that that's what that's what he comes for now he's the kinsman redeemer he's coming back to do one thing and and that is he's coming back so now he can reproduce the seed he is the what the Original Seed he was what God originally was going to plan right and remember we we read this great statement uh here that he was that seed that Eve should have produced do you get it so okay so so now he's he's here Eve would have produced it but now he find of Virgin Mary in a type to be a carrier and so and so Eve would have produced it so if Eve would have produced him she would have and that her offspring would have produced you right okay well you're trying to I I really believe the prophet of God's trying to bring us all to something that if Jesus was that seed that she would have produced and if that seed's in you then you would have been produced also so you can you can because we were in him at Calvary right we were in him to beginning the bride is part of him we are the word of God we've heard all those things but now I believe we're coming to a time where they're coming together to give us a faith that's greater than we've ever had before a rapturing faith cuz we're certainly going to need this he said he was the seed that he would have produ would have produced do you get it he was the seed that Eve was to produce but she hybrid it by disbelieving God's word and when she hybrid it she she died right because man wasn't meant to die die man was meant to live now this is the part that I just want to touch on a little bit this evening he was that seed and the only way that life could be in in reproduction of life the life had to come through the seed so in other words if I could say this God was interested in reproduction that was what he planned all from the beginning that everything would come forth of its kind so and he told Adam and Eve to to go and and and and plenish and and and reproduce and and fill the Earth that's what he told her to do so so that was God's plan in the beginning but once it got hybrid and it and the plan went and death came came in something had to come along right and and put the plan back on course and and so I I just want to read these statements so I can get to the point so life had to come through the seed so the reproduction life the life that Eve would have produced we had lost that so now he's coming to restore that life back and remember that's what he said right he said that he had to go to Calvary and die that that life might come back over and bring the seeds that were to come back to life and and and so he said and Jesus had to be broken open in order for that seed uh to let forth its life to water other seeds that was to come so that's that's been God's Great purpose is to uh uh germinate that seed now he could have he never could do it uh under the condition that everybody was in so another word um I don't I want to go fast but I don't want to go too fast he said he says he told Eve he said I'll give you a seed to The Serpent and the serpent had already defiled her he said but thy seed that I will give you shall bruise his head I'll take that thing back again amen I just wish everybody could see that see I've come to conquer and correct what evees done only way I can do it is through a woman that believed the seed where a a woman didn't believe the seed a woman believed the word where one didn't believe it so the only way he can reproduce is to have a woman right a bride something that he can reproduce the Sons and Daughters of of of of God again so that's what his his his goal is because remember he already had your names written on the Lamb's Book of Life you were already in his thinking before the foundation of the world if you were ever saved you were always saved if you had eternal life you always had eternal life but you didn't know it you know you didn't know it this is the age that he wants us to know who we are he want in other words we have this negative thinking if I could just as brother BR said I wish I could just get that across to people that he's come to conquer and to correct what Eve done so when we come down through Eve what were we we're Sinners we're lost we better get saved if we we don't get saved then then oh we're we're just doomed you know and and and everything's kind of from a a negative uh a standpoint you know and and uh but Satan provided churches for that a whole church world oh you just need to get saved you need to get saved you need to get saved you need to repent of your sin you need to do good you know what I mean you you better repent but he don't want any more Sons and Daughters of God he couldn't handle the last one you know what I mean but that's what the scripture said in John uh uh what is it 3:12 he said as many as believed on him he gave power to become the Sons and Daughters of God so he's got churches out there that'll that'll he he's got hundreds of them all over he gave man religion but he doesn't give them a religion that'll transform them to what that they really are to make them different and there that they don't they just continue to remain in sin and what is sin it's unbelief that's right they don't really believe what he's done they don't really believe what he said and so when a message came which was the pure word of God to bring us back to the revelation of who we were and what the plan of God was so when he opened the seals the whole mystery was made clear and the first part of that mystery was the kinsman redeemer he didn't come to P make pigs Lambs he came to let you know that you were a lamb to begin you know he come to take you out of the pig pen and put you in the pastors of his word so it it it wasn't a a transformation uh making you from one species to a different species he just wanted you to bring you to the realization of what you really are what a different way of thinking what a transformation So you you're not always saying oh I'm no good I'm a sinner you know I I just need repentance I hope I make it to Heaven uh you know one day I'm going to try to do as many good works as I can because so when I come into the Judgment uh he'll look at me and he'll say oh you're a Believer no he don't look at you that way now that's right he looks at you as his children you're his daughters you're his sons you always were his daughters and sons your name was always on his Lamb's Book of Life but what what you know he said so he wants us to come he says wants us to believe that we could say I'm the seed of God Satan has no right to put these things on me I'm going going to drive him out the the squatter I'm going to get him off my land that's the kind of attitude that he wants us to have not oh I'm a sinner and and you know and that's that's how the ministry holds fear over the people always a threat that boy you disobey or you miss church you're going to hell you can miss church every day of your life all you're going to do is be miserable you're not going to have any Fellowship you're going to be battled all in the world but if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life you'll be there now you might not have no reward you know what I mean but but all kinds of ways to make you feel that you better uh uh you better not miss it and and and you better obey and you better submit and and you better be there and where were you Tuesday night where were you this day what's wrong with you and all that fear as if your salvation's in the balance well that's no way to live you know that ain't Victorious living in fact we're we're told not to even have a negative thought but but to be positive to be to be to know that we're Sons and Daughters of God even to the point that we rejoice in chastisement thank you for correcting me Lord thank you for putting me on the right path thank you Father for dealing with me as a son and and not as an illegitimate born child uh you know we uh that's the appreciation that we we we want to have we don't want to we don't want to have such a a negative uh uh viewpoint but we want to understand that he he has come to reproduce to to to have his offspring to have his seed the seed that was there originally took a different route they entered into a marriage a hybrid marriage and they had another ruler over them the husband of sin and so now the the Sons and Daughters of God they found themselves in the world in the flesh with highbrid characteristics death all around us all of us came hybrid he said but now he's come back to take us back to correct what Eve had done and to take it back again amen what's he doing he's taking us back to Eden back to the beginning back to where we were as Sons and Daughters of God he can only do that he can only have done that when he finally got a bride somebody that heck that his seed was in oh yeah oh it's beautiful when we can when we can understand this that we're not here struggling Ling and trying to live right to get saved we're here claiming back our inheritance cuz we're join AES with him we're coming back to get restored back to us the Faith of Our Fathers restored back to us what our commission is what our inheritance is everything that he was I love that statement that he made everything that Adam lost Jesus was so he was what every Sons and Daughters would be what he possessed every son and daughter of God would possess so what he had is our what inheritance we're joint HS with him sitting in Heavenly places and as long as you keep looking at your flesh that's from the other Union that's what was borned in sin and shaped in iniquity now he has a spirit that's going to kill that man or break that marriage and that person's going to die the hybrid person's going to die why are they going is it going to die cuz the word of God is going to come to life cuz the germ seed he he paid the price for what Eve done now he's comes back with his Spirit to water that word to bring it to life the first Adam was what a living soul and if Eve had a f Fallen that living Soul would have continued to go on to produce Sons and Daughters of God but she hybrid it and when she hybrid it death came and now when we came into the world the seed that was in US came into the world it came into the world in a dying body right is that right something that was swn in corruption and in unbelief now the only thing that could transform that was the word yes sir and and so he came not just to preach at us but we're we were his Kinsmen so he came back paid the price so now he can continue the reproduction cycle that would have came through Eve in the beginning is to do what to bring Sons and Daughters of God back into existence to have them come out of the hbrd out of the bondage out of the obedience to the Flesh and to become Overcomers Hallelujah to him that is given to overcome amen I will suck with them I will share with them the evening Revelation so let let's just read these last uh uh a few great statements that the prophet of God said he said I've come to conquer and to and to uh he says I'll give you a seed and she'll bruise the head he'll take that thing back again so first of all he's come to take you back thank you Lord back to the word back to being sons and daughters of God back to having victory over this flesh that he's going to transform you from all this weakness that we are he's going to make us different and as many has Believe on him and received him he gave them power to become the Sons and Daughters of God he says and the only way I can do that is through a woman and that believes the seed where a woman didn't believe the seed a woman believe the word where one did not believe it what a beautiful uh uh expression of Mary and what she was a type of and as we go on and just read a little more he says he says all of God's Sons must be the same amen yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 see to be born of water and spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place of where you should would have been at the beginning oh my what a wonderful thing that's going on to so we're not sitting here believing that we make it and oh I'm hoping I make the Rapture I I'm hoping uh that when I get there he judges me uh worthy you know what I mean no he's going to take care of it for there he's going to give you the same spirit that raised him from the dead and it's going to Quicken your mortal body also Hallelujah going to give you that spirit that he had he's going to bring you back to what you were in the beginning so now you're an owner and a possessor of the eternal life you always had so what are you're going you always had it but he's going to Quicken it to you he's going to make it alive in you because it's in the seed but he's The Germ of the seed he's the germinator Satan's the Terminator Jesus is the germinator I like that I just come to me I couldn't resist it all those other preachers can pull those things off and I don't ever get one but but I like it he's the lifegiver Satan's the deathgivers the wages of unbelief is what death the wages of sin is death the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus in other words you're going to get it from him amen amen that's what he's going to give you amen so if Satan will he built all his churches to stop you short of that oh you believe that you're a sinner confess you're a sinner and and and confess the Lord and you shall be saved that's that's so future you you're you're clinging to a hope so St what he wanted to do he wanted to reproduce himself he wanted sons and daughters like himself that's what he wants and and he gave us something that will do that he gave us the pure unadulterated word of God that's what the word will do for us it will transform us change us into the image of his only begotten son look we're not if we can make that transformation Resurrection is automatic right death does not have any victory over you where's your sting where's your Victory I've ran the race I fought the fight I await the crown that awaits for me it doesn't matter you know some by the fire some by the you know uh one way there but it's all through the blood and so we we we we see that right now and this is what he's saying that we should have to to bring you back to the place where you were should have been at the beginning see that's the reason Christ's death brings us right back again where sons of God now we're now we're achieving something totally different now we're understanding wait a minute this this message wasn't just about correcting Doctrine this message doesn't wasn't about educating us to the Mysteries this message was about resurrection and reproduction and and now having a word that would produce and bring forth the seed but in order to make that transformation we have to renew our minds by the washing of the water of the word we have to get every other thinking out we have to get our own thinking out we have to get our own fear out we we've got to totally come back to this subjection of the word of God where we believe it's exactly what he said oh and it begins to make things it begins to make things so wonderful if Eve would have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not God tell her multiply and replenish the Earth that was her purpose now there's a second Eve right an elected bride he's went through all these ages to get you here because he predestinated you to receive that word because he knew when you receive that word it would turn you and transform form you into the sons and daughters that you were in the beginning Satan says you can't he don't want any more Sons and Daughters of God he wants to discredit the word he wants to discredit you all his life he's been trying to pile stuff on you pile sin on you try to have a record against you to try to build up his case why you can't be a son and daughter of God don't look at his evidence because God threw it in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more he can lay nothing to the charge of God's elect because the seed of God remains in them and that seed will produce what it's planted for let's just close here and because it it it's just so wonderful so you understand when the scripture says we're joint heirs with Christ we are now sitting in Heavenly places with him well Paul got caught up he understood it he understood I'm a Son of God I'm join HS I have a I have a crown of righteousness waiting for me he said we we'll be translated in a moment in the twinkling of an eye those that are dead in Christ they'll rise first those of us who remain will be caught up together with the Saints we're going to meet them in the air well he he he was seeing it yes sir of course we know that old seed was going to go into the ground old Satan wasn't going to leave it there he was on that horse rider right there in that first age what was a white White Horse it represented lies twisting the word putting in his Doctrine sowing that Trinity thinking that keeps a man from seeing the word of God they trying to come along all the ages and and and and then on another horse rider and another horse rider and God's fighting it off in every age with the Beast and finally we come into this age he's on a Pale Horse total confusion Doctrine all messed up but what comes swooping in amen an eagle amen a Seer a Divine interpreter of the word of God to restore us back to the original revelation of God's word oh my I like what brother Bram said this morning you just end up arguing with yourself and defeating your own purpose don't argue with God's word believe it amen he said you're a God believe what he said you were believe what he said you could become don't let this old man out here keep depriving you so he goes on he says this he says now now now this brings you right back to the spoken word then we are God's word made manifest see Jesus said the same thing he that believeth on me the things who I am what I come for and the purpose I do to bring a man back to believe the word of God and take nothing else with it the works that I do he'll do also so now look at what what he's really saying it's not to believe that he was Jesus was Jesus died but he he says this is what he wants us to believe he that believeth on me who I am who is he he's not a second person of the Trinity he was our Kinsman he was our brother he was of the same lineage that we were spoken word lineage from the Lamb's Book of Life The Original Seed he came into this world from the original seed that would have brought us in the world but we got the hybrid side of it cuz Eve uh got involved prophet of God said she took the route of a I just won't say what I should say what he said what's wrong with me I'll say exactly what he said he said I find it right here he said find it Well maybe I can't find it for reason but he said she took the path of a what he said you know what I mean and then and it threw us it threw us all all in in into death and that's what she did so now he's come to make it right now if we can believe so not only he says believe who I am and what I come for you understand so it's not it's not that's what I said Satan put all kinds of churches out there just giving you part of the formula you've got to believe who he was who was he he was a kinsman redeemer he was born and and and came into this world tempted the same way as we were tempted he suffered suffering just as we suffered it but he was without sin why was he without sin he doesn't he didn't come through the the hybrid system he came the original way oh I like it and so now he's here and he's got a purpose his purpose is to go redeem his own he's a quickening spirit he's now to go Quicken all the seed of God that's embedded in this Earth and bring them back to life to resurrect them in the the work of reproducing the word and bring them back to being the sons and daughters that they were in the beginning don't put it off in the future it's yours now to lay hold of it's yours now to gain the victory over it's it's yours now to tell Satan Satan you cannot have me I'm not going to be in your bondage no more you say well what what about sickness in your body God heals sickness in the body but don't you let a sickness rob you of your Victory you still keep your joy you still keep your hope you still keep your Victory it there no sign Gods against you when they asked Jesus about it he said that the glory of God might be revealed and so he he says so you you believe what I come for and the purpose I do to bring a man back to believe the word of God and take nothing else with it and then the works that I do heal do also oh my goodness as many as believe he gave them power to be the Sons and Daughters of God and then I'd like to read this last statement we notice then see the spoken word then we are God's word made manifest that's how God wants his church is to manifest himself he can how can he manifest himself unless his own seed is in that person can you imagine having that life in you all the time and it's laying dormant it's laying dormant all it's got to do you've heard the prophet say this over and over again when it gets in the right condition when it gets in the right channel when it gets in in the right atmosphere it'll bring forth what's the preaching of the word of God to do to bring us in the right Condition it's to put us in the right atmosphere it's to put the water on it the spirit on it that it can bring forth God's interested in reproducing Sons and Daughters of God that's why this is the bride age in type not the carnal way but the way it would have been in the beginning where he's got a bride a spiritual bride and that seed is in scattered out in all kinds of different people but it's still his seed and now that seed might be in one person a different person some person the outside doesn't matter it's the seed that makes the difference and that seed's there he sewed it he sewed it to this age and that seed hasn't changed it's pure seed but it needs to be germinated and it can only be germinated by one thing now a lot you might have tried to follow a lot of things and do a lot of things and try a lot of religions but sometime in your life it was planned that God would run the pure word of God across that seed and that seed would come to life and then that seed would begin to transform you bring this flesh under subjection that that word life can start to shine forth out of you Sons and Daughters of God so I I I don't want to battle a phantom enemy I don't want to try to become what Satan says a Christian is or what Satan says how I get there I don't want to spend my whole life trying to bring my my body into subjection so that I think by doing so I'm going to be saved I'm not bringing in my body into subjection of the purpose of gaining salvation I'm bringing this body in subjection because it was born in sin and shaped in iniquity and it becomes a hindrance to me all things are lawful for me but all things aren't expedient I'm not going to let this flesh ruin my position in Christ I'm going to take control of it I'm going to I'm going to bring it under subjection and I'm going to leave those things which are behind and I'm going to press for a higher calling because I am a son and a daughter of God that was sowed in me and that's the faith that's in you that's What Makes You Different that's why you can overcome not how you got here but what he put in you from the beginning we all got here different and we all find ourselves in different conditions with different failures but unbelief doesn't stop God oh no wonder he said when this church can realize who she is and the two spirits in the the framework of the church and withstand the the one she'll become an invincible Army you've got to withstand everything that's contrary to the word everything Satan tells you that's contrary to what God said you are you don't believe it no matter how good of a picture that he can paint and no matter what a failure you feel you might be he didn't see a failure he saw Sons and Daughters of God he saw his seed and he sent his Redeemer to bring that seed to life and that seed will produce what he said have faith in he that is in you that's your Victory you got to know that I I I I just he prophet of God said I only wish I could get everybody to see that your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he put the wedding band of predestination on you over there in other words he married you there he knew by for knowledge the seed would be in you he knew it was going to show up in you and when it showed up in you he planned your life that this message word would come across and strike it some of you he put in a family that believed the message so you could hear it some of you he put you you were out in the world he had to put you through a desperate situation to get you to hear it but like that great Eagle it went out searching cuz it knew it had a seed somewhere and we're never going to rise above the battle of the flesh until we can accept our position in Christ Jesus our sunship our daughter ship we're placed by the spirit we're adopted into the plan of God and then we have the full Authority of our father because we too are the sons and daughters of God and we too have dominion and authority over Satan and we can take our rightful place as inheritors and owners of every promise in the book and the power to defeat Satan at every turn oh church I wish we could see ourselves the way he sees us I wish we could understand the great price he paid but I think if we keep plowing we keep opening it up we keep laying it out there one day someone's going to stand up and say you know something I come from God and I go to God Satan get behind me amen God bless you Amen brother Billy come dismiss us in prayer let's Stand Together can you love the Lord amen God's good that's good my my request and I'll just let you know how I'm doing uh him being able to see a little better uh U I have what's called floaters in my eye and and what that is is I as you know a blood vessel broke in my eye it filled my eye full of blood and and now my body is absorbing that blood but there's still uh little floaters and so I'll be reading and all of a sudden one of them floaters ERS will come along and then I'm I'm trying to look around it you know what I mean or try you know think I can shake it out of my way amen well there ain't no floater going to keep me from God's word amen I thought well Satan I can't read it but I can listen to it and the scripture says blessed is he that heareth the Prophecies of this book so I thank God for the tapes I don't know where I'd be with without them I I just can't imagine how them early Saints kept such a standard without a Bible without a book or without a tape you know what they did they kept their world out of their life so so they could be Spirit-filled every day of their life they stayed moist in the water of God's word at and it made the victory so uh the doctor is going to to give me a couple more weeks to see if my body will absorb that blood and he said if after 3 weeks if he doesn't he'll go in there and remove it and and take it out I'll have to have surgery so I don't like to go that way and he says I'm doing all this so I can stick a needle in your eye uh with a camera on the end of it so you're going to stick a laser in my eye and go and kill all the old blood vessels and then he'll stick a camera in my eye to see what he's doing and those floaters are the things that's keeping him from seeing I thought well what a wonderful thing I have to look forward to I'm sure glad I got Calvary amen I'm sure glad I got a lot of promises of God in between here and there but if that's the way he chooses to do it he's still the Healer right he's Still the One that's going to restore me and and just like my hair I haven't lost a one of them so let's keep positive let's believe let's start acting like who we are Sons and Daughters of God no negativity no sadness but victorious in Christ Jesus
