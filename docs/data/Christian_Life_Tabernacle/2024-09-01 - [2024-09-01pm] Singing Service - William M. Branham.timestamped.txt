[1:43:48] of us
[1:43:55] before anything I want to take a minute
[1:43:56] to tell you I love

[1:44:12] English so just be patient with

[1:44:31] you I haven't had the opportunity to
[1:44:33] speak to each one of
[1:44:37] you with my little English that I
[1:44:42] know but I want you to know I love
[1:44:45] you and I've been very
[1:44:50] blessed and we are in this fight
[1:44:52] together
[1:45:03] I I I took some time because I was
[1:45:05] Finding looking for a way to say this in
[1:45:07] English but
[1:45:12] no but I want to glorify the name of the
[1:45:15] Lord
[1:45:21] Jesus just sharing a little bit how I
[1:45:23] met the Lord through the
[1:45:28] message I grew up in
[1:45:30] the the the church that was
[1:45:42] denomination and they taught us that
[1:45:43] John the Baptist was the last
[1:45:47] prophet and that there was no other one
[1:45:49] after him
[1:45:55] so it was a horrible fight in my
[1:46:01] family and I was on the side of the
[1:46:03] Apostolic
[1:46:05] Church the denomination in which we
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:12] were one day I heard a little testimony
[1:46:23] he was in a church where they were
[1:46:24] preaching the
[1:46:29] message and I began to cry for no
[1:46:35] reason and in my heart I made a brief
[1:46:41] prayer and I said
[1:46:45] Lord if this message comes from
[1:46:49] you I want to be a part of it
[1:46:55] I don't know how much time passed after
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:01] that but one day my father came to
[1:47:07] church he was one of those who accepted
[1:47:10] the message from the
[1:47:17] beginning he was so enthused to share
[1:47:19] what God had revealed to him about the
[1:47:21] serpent seed
[1:47:25] and we were watching the
[1:47:29] television and he was so enthus he
[1:47:31] wanted to
[1:47:35] share I said oh Dad okay Dad talk to
[1:47:40] me I sat with him on the
[1:47:46] table and he began to share to me
[1:47:49] through the
[1:47:51] scriptures what was the serp
[1:47:54] seat when he
[1:47:58] finished he pointed at
[1:48:02] me but I I could tell that was not my
[1:48:07] father he said Do you believe
[1:48:11] it and I said
[1:48:16] yes at that moment I began to cry
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:26] I felt like I was transported to another
[1:48:30] place where there was no
[1:48:33] time there's no
[1:48:37] words it was like a place where you
[1:48:39] talked from heart to
[1:48:49] heart he knows I will stand before him
[1:48:51] someday and this is the
[1:48:56] truth I saw how an angel came from
[1:48:58] behind
[1:49:01] me by through the door of my house in
[1:49:06] Mexico and he stood right next to
[1:49:10] me and he told
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:16] me that remembered the prayer you had
[1:49:18] made
[1:49:23] and he showed me the little corner where
[1:49:25] I would hide to
[1:49:27] pray he said this is your
[1:49:36] answer I hope it can help
[1:49:40] somebody that God still
[1:49:44] answers God's still the
[1:49:47] same and he's with us even tonight
[1:49:55] [Music]
[1:50:00] I think he put his right hand on my
[1:50:03] head and he raised his other hand to
[1:50:06] Heaven he said Don't
[1:50:10] Fear you'll be
[1:50:13] there so I have an
[1:50:17] appointment sometimes it looks difficult
[1:50:23] it looks
[1:50:25] impossible but my God is a god of the
[1:50:34] [Applause]
