this evening we i believe we have uh some of the stefan's relatives with us we certainly like to welcome them and bless them and each one if you have your bibles let's turn to exodus the 23rd chapter and read the 20th 21st and 22nd verse and then we've been studying this message called who is this melchizedek and we have 37 minutes left in the book so we're going to just listen to those 37 minutes and then we're going to do a little something at the end of service and so it'll it won't take us very long just 37 minutes so let's read here in 23 20. it says behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared amen isn't that our heart's desire we need something to keep us on the path and we need something to bring us to the prepared place amen isn't that what the lord said i go to prepare a place for you amen and then he sent the spirit there to lead us he said beware of him and that's in other words that's a way of saying respect him don't be afraid of him but to be aware of his presence in other words be be timid and and aware and and always be sensing his presence in other words that this angel is in your life and he's by you beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries amen how many love heaven god on your side amen just think if god be for you who can be against you amen and when he's on your side i don't care where your place is in your life or how far you might be away from things he's just got a marvelous way of making things work out he certainly can take the the person that's in the depth of sin and wash them and make him whole so he's a great god that can really do marvelous wonderful things we're just going to play this 36 minutes i know you might not be used to listening but if you could just tune your ear and enjoy the things that are spoken as we finish this a great study and i i do know also this weekend that some of the people are going to jason's jackson's young people service and i i know they have a couple more seats not this weekend but following weekend they might have a couple more seats in the van and then also this weekend we have uh brother john from togo will be ministering to us so lord richie bless you let's sit back and tune in 37 minutes can anybody concentrate 37 minutes you don't suffer like i do right with add attention deficit disorder amen so you got to fight that wandering mind enjoy the word of god this is really amazing stuff if you can catch the revelation so have your seat god bless you enjoy this 37 minutes one day i was told a story of peter and andrew's brother they were fishermen and their father jonas was a great old believer one day they said he sit down on the side of the boat he said sons you know how we prayed when we needed fish there's commercial fishermen he said we've trusted god jehovah for our living i'm getting old now i can't stay with you boys much longer and i've always as all true believers have looked for the time when that messiah will come we've got all kinds of falsehoods but there's coming a real one someday he said when this messiah comes i don't want you boys to be deceived this messiah will not be just a theologian he will be a prophet for our prophet moses of whom we follow he said now any jew will believe he's prophet he's taught to know that and if the prophet says anything it's so then that's true but god said if there be one among you spiritual or prophet how the lord will make myself known to him and what he says comes to pass and hear him and fear him but if it don't then don't hear him at all see so that was a the vindication of the prophet so moses was truly a vindicated prophet and he said the lord your god shall raise up among you out of your brethren a prophet like unto me and all that won't hear him will be cut off from the people he said now children remember that as hebrews we believe god's vindicated prophets now listen close don't miss it and he said when the messiah comes you will know him for he will be a prophet messiah i said it's been 400 years we haven't had a prophet since malachi but he'll be one day after his death a few years his son andrew was strolling along down the bank and he heard a wild man out of the wilderness saying that messiah is standing among you now that big eagle it raised up over the wilderness and flew over there said the messiah is among you right now we don't know him yet but he's standing among you i know him because i see a sign coming from heaven one day he said there behold is the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world away went when this man defined his brother said simon i want you to come over here we've done found the messiah all gone andrew you know better than that oh i know but that this man is different where is he where'd he come from jesus of nazareth that little wicked city well it couldn't come from a wicked dirty place like that you just come and see finally persuaded him to come down one day so when he come in the front of this messiah jesus standing there speaking to the people when he walked up in front of me said your name is simon and you are the son of jonas that did it he got the keys to the kingdom why he knowed that that man did not know him and how did he know him and that about the old fatherhood taught him how to believe the messiah there was a man standing there by the name of philip oh he got really excited he knows another man had been studying the bible with away he went around the hill and he found him out there in his uh olive grove he was kneeling down praying that had lots of bible lessons together so he come out there and he said after he got to praying he said um come see who we found jesus of nazareth the son of joseph he's the messiah we're looking for now i can hear nathaniel say now philip you ain't one off on the deep end are you oh no no now let me tell you you know we've been studying the bible together and what did the prophet say the messiah would be he'd be a prophet you remember that old fishman you bought the fish from it didn't have enough education to sign his name called simon yep he'd come up and you know what this jesus of nazareth told him and his name was simon changed his name to peter which is little stone and told him who his daddy was well he said he said i don't know could anything good come out of nazareth he said let's not talk about it just come on and see that's a good idea come and see so here come philip bringing up nathanael and when he got walking up jesus probably standing speaking probably praying for the sick and the prayer line and when he come up to where jesus was jesus looked around at him and said behold an israelite in whom there's no god now you say well his way is dressed oh no all easterners dressed the same you could have been a syrian or been anything else beard garment he said behold an israelite in whom there's no god and otherwise an honest sincere man well that kind of deflated nathanael and he said rabbi which means teacher rabbi when did you ever know me how did you know i was a jew how did you know i was honest no god he said before philip called you when you were under the tree i saw you amen 15 miles away the other side of the country the day before what did he say rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel but there's to those priests there self-styled self-starts that this man is beelzebub a fortune teller jesus said i'll forgive you for that remember they never said it out loud but they said it in their hearts and he perceived their thoughts that's right what the bible says call it telepathy if you want to but he he perceived their thoughts and he said i forgive you for that but someday the holy ghost is going to come and do the same thing after he's going speak a word against it will never be forgiven in this world the world to come is that right oh that were jews then one day he had need to go to samaria but just before we do that we found the woman or the the man as he went through the gate call beautiful that he was healed and jesus known his condition and told him to take up your bed and go on home and he did it he got well then we find out the jews some of them received him some believe it some didn't why did they believe it it was not ordained to lie they wasn't part of that attribute i remember them were priest and great man and jesus think of those theologians and priests man that you couldn't find a flaw in their life jesus said you are of your father the devil and his works you do said if you'd be of god you'd believe me if you can't believe me be believe the works that i do they testify who i am now the bible said that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever jesus said the works that i do shall he that believeth on me do also that right notice that was a real melchizedek now i notice again there was only three races of people you heard me say i was a segregationist i am all christians are segregationists not segregation of color but segregation of spirit a man's color of his skin has nothing to do with it he's a child of god by birth but a christian god said separate me come out from among him and so forth he is a segregationist a filth between right and wrong but notice they had a segregation and a racial segregation which was the samaritans and there's only three races of people on the earth if we believe the bible that is ham sham and japan's people that's the three sons of noah we all sprung from there right that makes us all back from adam which makes us all brothers the bible said of one blood god created all nations we're all brothers to the blood stream a colored man to give a white man a blood transfusion or vice versa the white man can give the the japanese yellow man or the indian the red man or what more or japanese or whatever he could give him a blood transfusion because we're all the same blood the color of our skin where we lived had nothing to do with it but when we're segregated it's when we come out of the world like he brought israel up out of egypt that's when we're segregated from the things of the world now there was a hand sham and james people and if we had time to run the genealogies back you could see the anglo-saxon where he come from now that was the jew the samaritan which was half jew and gentile that married in with the gentiles at balaam's doings and moab they were samaritans and there was jews and gentiles now we anger saxon had nothing to do with any of it we didn't believe any messiah or nothing else we wasn't looking for one we were brought in afterwards jesus came to his own and his own received him not and he said to his disciples don't go in the way of the gentiles but go rather to the lost sheep of israel and he went only to the lost sheep of israel and watch he manifested himself as son of man before the jews they turn it down now the samaritan being half jew and gentile they believed also and was looking for a messiah we wasn't we were heathens with clubs on our back worshiping idols the gentiles but now one day saint john 4 he had need to go by samaria on his road down to jericho but was went up around samaria and while he was going up there he sat down on the well outside of a city called psycho and the well if you've ever been there it's a little panoramic about like this year and there's a public spring there a water where they all come and women come up the morning get their pots of water and put it on their head and one on each ship walk with it just as straight as it can be never spill or drop talk to one another so they were the people come out there so this is about 11 o'clock today so he sent his disciples into the city to buy some fiddles food and while they were gone there was a woman which was ill-famed oh we'd call her today a red light woman or prostitute she had too many husbands so while jesus is sitting there this woman come out about 11 o'clock see she couldn't come with the virgins when they come in the morning to get their wash water she had to wait till they all they didn't mix like they do now she was marked so then she come out to get some water so she just tucked the old window and put the hooks over the jar and started to let it down she heard somebody say woman bring me a drink i remember this is melchizedek this is jesus yesterday the son of man and she looked around and she saw a jew so she said uh sir it's not proper for a jew to ask the samaritan for anything i'm the woman of samara so you have spoken out of your place you shouldn't have asked me such a thing is that we have no dealings with one another he said but if you knew who was talking to you you would ask me for a drink she said are you gonna draw it the whales deem you have nothing to roll with he said the water i give is water of life springing up in the eternal life he talked to her until he found what her condition was and that's what watch what he said to her now go get your husband and come here and she said i have no husband he said you've said the truth or you've had five and the one you now are living with is not yours so in this you said the truth what's the difference between that woman and that bunch of priests she know more about god and that whole bunch of priests did put together she said sir i perceive that you are a prophet she said we haven't had one for 400 years now we know that the messiah is coming and when the messiah comes that's what he's going to do that was the sign of the messiah for he was the son of man he said that's what he's going to do when he comes you must be his prophet he said i am he nobody else could say that she dropped that water pot and run into the city and said come see a man who told me what i've done isn't this the very messiah now remember he promised to do that same thing at the end of the gentile race the jews that had 4 000 years to look for that messiah four thousand years of teaching he was coming and what he would do when he got there and they failed a scene or fail to recognize it and when he made himself known in the very bible terms that he said he would when he'd been a theophany and then become flesh and dwelt among them they failed to sin and call these works the works of the devil now we've had 2 000 years of teaching coming down to the roman catholic church answer the apostles then we come down to the roman catholic the greek and so forth on down to luther's age and wesley what more 900 different organizations coming down they had all these ages teaching now he promised just before the end time would come that this picture of sodom and gomorrah would again as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the end times the son of man will reveal himself again yet a little while and the world won't see me no more yet you shall see me for i am a personal pronoun i will be with you even in you to the consummation the end of the world i'll be with you he's the same yesterday today and forever you see you see the samaritan was actually from my last night's sermon was anger see a perverted type the jew was sarah or was saranike but the gentile is of mary the royal seed abraham's royal sea now it's promised that in these last days that this same god the same christ would come back here and reveal himself as son of man why he's the same yesterday there forever and if he let those jews go by with and give them that messiah sign and then come to the end of the gentiles teaching and let them miss going on theology he would be unjust he's got to do the same thing because the bible said in 13 hebrews 13 8 he is the same and he's promised in malachi 4 and all the different scriptures that the last days the church would be setting just exactly like it is today and the world would be look at the world today look at the solemn condition look at the earthquakes and divers places and the things that's taking place look at the church in the mess it's in a babbler look at the messenger to it on oral roberts and a billy graham g-r-a-h-a-m first time we ever had a messenger to all the churches that his hand name ever end in h.a.m like abraham a-b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters g-r-a-h-a-m is six letters where's he at to the world six is man's number man was created on the sixth eighth but seven is god's number now look at them down there in solomon and there is our messengers down there speaking to him amen but then where's that seed of abraham amen amen where is their sign that is that as it was in the days of silence that god came down and was manifested in human flesh and told what sarah was thinking back in her heart in the tent behind him the last sign before the gentile world was destroyed by fire the church has got its last sign before the whole world is going to be destroyed this gentile kingdom be destroyed by the fire and wrath of god you believe that that male casualty was fleshy representing himself in a human body and then later he was made flesh and now tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever do you believe it who is this melchizedek man that's the same yesterday never had no father never had no mother he never had no beginning of days he never had any in the life and he met abraham and what kind of a sign did he perform then when he was made flesh he said it would repeat again just before the end time you believe that i believe it let's pray dear god i believe the scriptures that you have said you was the same yesterday and forever and as sincerely in my heart lord i know that something's fixing to take place i cannot strictly identify i'm afraid to say anything lord thou knowest the heart of your servants and how many times down to the age when you sent things people fail to get it man is constantly praising god for what he did and saying what great things he's going to do but ignoring what he's doing so has it been through the age why did the roman church fail to see st patrick as god's prophet why did they kill joan of arc when she was a a prophetess burner as a witch father it's always past you hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent no wonder you said to them priests you garnish the tombs of the prophets and you're the one that put them in there after they're gone they see their mistake they always persecute you lord in whatever form you come in i pray tonight god just one more time tomorrow we're scheduled to be to go to tucson other parts of the world other cities we must preach in but dear god there might be strangers here tonight that never has they've heard words preached but never seen it made manifest as i asked you at the beginning when those disciples theopis and his friend coming from emmaus was walking along the road and you stepped out of the bush and began to talk to him after the resurrection preached to them why said fool slow of heart don't you know that christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory but still they never recognized it all day long they walked with you and still didn't know you but one night night come they constrained you to come in when they went into the little end and closed the doors then you did something just the way you did it before your crucifixion and they recognized that it was the risen christ in a few moments he is behind the curtains and gone quickly they run and told the disciples the lord is risen indeed father god i believe that you're still alive i know you are and you've proved it to us so many times could you just do it once more for us lord if we found grace in your sight let it happen once more i am your servant these are your servants in here lord all that i've said wouldn't mount to just one word from you would be more and i've said in these five nights or five messages it would be more just one word from you won't you speak lord that the people might know that i've told them the truth granted god i asked it in jesus name this once more amen now i don't know you i know some people i know this boy is sitting here i know bill dallas sitting right there i wanna here's brother blair rodney cox it's hard to see out there on this side right at the present time i can't see nobody actually that i know now how many in here that knows that i am a stranger to you raise up your hands knows that i know nothing about you raise up your hands on both sides how many in here that has something wrong or something that you know that i know nothing about would you raise up your hands now it would be totally absolutely totally impossible for me to know anything about you otherwise then have to come from some revelation of spirit and being i've told you all these nights and tonight that he is not dead he's here and promised to do the same thing and promise that there would come a time in the last days according to malachi 4 and according to saint luke that he would appear again in human form among his people and do the same things and reveal the same thing the same the psych side how many knows that you bible readers knows that's a true say amen must all be bible readers now i know it's foreign to the people today but still it's the truth that's the reason they didn't know jesus of nazareth they know their church creeds but they didn't know him but he come just the way the bible said not a theologian not a priest he come as a prophet and his own received him not now if god will keep his word and if i happen to it happens to fall on someone that i know then i'll get someone else say i want somebody and i don't know and i want you to pray now look there's a little woman one time had an infirmity she spent her money for the doctors they could do her no good and she said within her heart if i can touch that man's garments i'll be made well you remember the story and so all of them tried to get her to stay back but she pressed through until she touched his garment went back and sat down now listen close and then when he did that when she did that jesus turned around and said who touched me why peter the apostle rebuked him he might have said something that lord don't say a thing like that the people believe there's something wrong with you because when you ask them to eat your flesh and drink your blood they already think there's something wrong and you say who touched me well the whole crowds are touching you he said yes but i perceived that virtue went out of me that was a different kind of touch and anybody knows that virtue is strength i got weak virtue left me and he looked around on the audience until he found the little woman and told her about her blood issue and she felt in her body that that bloody issue had stopped is that right and he said thy faith has saved me now the greek word there is sozo which absolutely means say physically or spiritual just the same you say he is your savior now if that was him yesterday and the way he acted to prove that he was among the people the messiah promised and that's the way he identified himself and promised with the bible he'd do the same thing now wouldn't he wouldn't you have to do the same thing you say did he say it about healing the sick yeah the hebrews the bible had just read from said that jesus christ now is our high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities how many knows that's true the bible said that he's a high priest now that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities then if he's the same high priest that he was then how would he act now he'd have to act the same way he did then if he's the same high priest now you might i'm not your high priest you might touch me and just be like touching your husband or your brother or what more a man but you let your faith touch him and watch what happens now if i be god's servant and have told you the truth god will vindicate that to be the truth and that would prove that jesus christ is the living tonight standing here is that right now you have faith this one side of time one side you have faith out there i better stay at the microphone here because you can't hear me somebody just look up to god and say god that man don't know me he knows nothing about me i'm a perfect stranger to him let my faith touch you lord and you know what's the matter with me lord you know all about me you know who i am the same as you know who peter was same as you know nathanael as you know what was wrong with the woman with the blood issue and this man tells me that you're the same yesterday and forever then lord let my faith touch you if he'll do that and then fallibly prove himself here how many of you will believe him with all your heart if you're doing at least one or two or three people for a witness god bless you now father god this is totally out of the hands of any man it'll have to be supernatural phenomenal so i pray that you'll help me now lord i'm in your hands do with me as you see fit in jesus name amen uh don't be nervous just humbly reverently say lord i'll serve you and that'll be a truth that if i can touch your garment then you speak back through that man that will prove to me that what he said is the truth that right how many ever seen a picture of that light it's all over the country everywhere science is talking examine it never work now he's right here now same one who said about marriage and divorce same ones on the mountain shut the hills back there same one as down here at the river in 33 the same yesterday today and forever he's the same now there's a woman she recognizes now that something's happening that light's hanging right over she's setting right ears green sweater on or something i don't know the woman i suppose we are strangers to one another that is right do you believe that god your your need of something and you believe that god can reveal to me what your trouble is and if he does then you know it'll have to be a supernatural power because i don't know you it'll have to come through supernatural depends on what you think it is you can take your side with the priest call it the devil or you take the side of the believer and call it god every which you believe that's where your reward will come from if god will reveal to me your trouble will you accept him as your your atonement for that trouble i don't know what the trouble is but i know and you know that something's going on all right now just let me tell you how you're feeling and then you'll know a real warm sweet comfortable feeling i'm looking right straight at it it's that light amber light hanging from the woman and the lady is suffering with a trouble in her stomach it's a kind of a gross like in her stomach she's not from here no you're from away from here aren't you that's right you're from wisconsin is that right now you are healed your faith has made you whole now tell me who the woman touched i'm 25 yards from it amen she touched jesus christ the high priest you believe that i'm looking at a woman that i talked to this woman i'm looking right at her because she's praying so hard for a man she told me she had a man she never

you believe god just let her get a little strength she'll be all right that's it amen hallelujah jesus christ now you know who melchizedek is amen it wasn't the flesh man it was the god the same god that dwells in you if you have his spirit because remember if it's the same spirit that was in jesus christ dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body what spirit was in him the word that word spirit was the spirit of god amen it's just quite a blessing but anyway we'll we'll go into some more of things later i won't be here i won't preach next sunday i'll try to grab the wednesday in between and then i have to go to missouri and help that church until they get a pastor i promised my friend before his death that i would do that for him and then we're going to cover some uh questions that we have about the son of man about melchizedek one of the great questions that's there it's a good question and is and the question is did the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell in brother brown and we're going to cover that and we could show you why it dwelt in jesus and then we'll lay it right down there right down the line the word of god there's got to be a word answer for every question there's no question that's not good you understand sometimes the question is just the key issue that kept keeping you from breaking in to a revelation and then as a pastor if people are talking about it in the parking lot and talking in my congregation then i know all uh a good answer for all the sheep both for the people that have the question uh people that that uh uh are wondering and then that's what brings us into unity in christ jesus because we all have one word and the word of god is based on revelation and so what we saw tonight is we saw that there was a promise in the scriptures for something to happen and the scripture promise was fulfilled but like in every age it's not doesn't always come according to man's teaching so it takes divine revelation and so you know if there's a question in your heart about the things that are said and you love the lord then ask god just pray ask him for a revelation and he he he loves you he he just didn't die for the people that are in this church or or the people that have the revelation that you have he died for the muslims he died for the hindus he died for the sheiks and the jains he died for the heathen you know his blood sacrifice is there for anybody and god will heal anybody that believes in him healing is not specific to one ministry there's many men that pray for the sick we should pray for the sick because jesus commanded us to go into all the world preach the gospel lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so also he wants more of him and understanding his spirit tonight i just wanted to take a moment this is brother adrian's uh uh last sunday with us uh he's going on a little journey before he returns back home and so we've been uh we're gonna do a little something for him and just a little way but right now i'd like him to come are you in here brother you've got to be here somewhere oh go get him he's not he's not escaping he's got his baby blanket that's good you don't need the baby banker brother just feel but anyway come on up and i just want you to tell the people uh to say what's on your heart tell the people about the vision you have and why the lord's doing with you in your life and and to just say a few words and then we want to uh we it's it's really hard for us to say goodbye um but um we believe that the lord is leading us in a different town and uh it's hard to leave family and to leave good friends and brothers and sisters behind but the word of the lord has been working on our heart and we believe that um you know the lord's leading us to a different city to minister to the people that um you know are in that place and um as brother david said you know we're not sure for how long and we're not sure what the lord has in store for us but we believe that that's the plan that the lord has for us and our family and uh like i said the word of the lord has been dealing with our hearts and uh you know made us feel guilty that we have such a good church and uh you know uh you know the lord spoke to my heart and you know in a way said what about the ones that are in the dark what about the ones that you know um they're hungering for the same thing that we have and uh we have such a great message that i believe sometimes we get a little bit too comfortable with this message but it's such a great message it's a message that needs to be shared and you know that sometimes means putting your family out there and we believe that the lord's gonna guide us and show us what to do but we wanna thank you everybody and uh the support and you know we're gonna stay in touch and uh you know we're not again sure what the lord has for us but we believe we just want to be a light in a little town this town that we're moving to is not a very big town but we believe that the lord can work in this little town and you know pretty soon we might call some brothers to help us out there if the lord finds a way to bring you know people to to him and and to the message so we want to thank you everybody for all the support please keep us in prayer we're going to need a lot of prayer we're going to need all the support we can't do it but ourselves that's one thing that i told brother david is we need your support we're going to be praying and fasting and and we just want the lord to guide us our hearts desires to be in his perfect will and that's what we are praying for and again thank you for everything may the lord be with you guys and uh we hope to maybe see you come and visit us you know we're gonna be an extension of this church up there so uh you know uh the fellowshipping shouldn't stop we're hoping to have at least one family every other weekend so uh you know we love you guys thank you again for all the prayer and the support and uh you know may the lord be with you guys god bless you amen well just as a pastor when he says he wants to go into the dark well the sun sets there about four o'clock in the afternoon and comes up about ten six months out of the year and the other times it don't go down till midnight so it's a but it's it's it's cold there so i remember uh him telling me one time that god wants to bring the people out of the cold so kels bell montana is certainly a nice cold spot to go to i lived in montana so i'm not talking off the top of my head you know what i mean so uh i lasted there three and a half years so the lord's got plenty of grace and mercy but anyway we just like this kind of say our little goodbye to you our way so i'd like dr cosman and his sisters to come that are going to sing and and we like just to say our little goodbye to you in a little different way so i'm going to ask them if they would come and the best i could do on the notice i've had but he said the most important thing pray for him pray for him that he finds the lord's perfect will amen do you need that michael your family [Music] the lord bless you and keep you make his face shine [Music] be upon to you the lord turns face toward you and give you peace [Music] um [Music] the lord bless you make its way shine upon you be gracious [Music] your [Music] i'm [Music] and your family and your children and their children and their children may his favor be upon you and a thousand generations and your family and your children and their children and their children may its presence go before you and behind you and beside you all around you and within you he is with you he is with you in the morning in [Music] he is for you he is for you he is for you he is for you he is for you he is for you he is for you [Music] um [Music] man [Music] let's let's stand together and and uh brother that's our blessing to you from our congregation and and may the lord guide your footsteps and we know that all things work together for the will of the lord is good and he even takes his permissive will and works it to his perfect will so aren't you glad you can't fail with him he loves you nothing can puck you out of the palm of his hand so we just pray that maybe that last one's right up there so if he gets finds them great then we can all go home right so let's all look amen let's pray our gracious heavenly father we sang this song from our heart lord we ask you to go with our brethren father may you give them clear vision and clear understanding father may him and his family find rest in peace lord it's a beautiful

the days there would be no flesh saved father we're watching murder rates go up everywhere we're seeing the things that they teach in our schools now that people won't even know what kind of human being they are it's not even the choice that you made for us but we can just turn you aside and make our own choices father you said the hour would come where man would no longer retain you in their conscious or their mind and you would turn them over to a reprobate mind father we're living in that darkness now but i thank you father that there was light in the light shined in the evening time father there was one that opened the seals father and revealed to us the unadulterated word of god the truth of the godhead and many great mysteries we're thankful for that now father our one of our family members is going on a journey lord we ask that you use him father and lord when you're done and finished with that work bring them back to us lord so we can send them someplace else maybe back
