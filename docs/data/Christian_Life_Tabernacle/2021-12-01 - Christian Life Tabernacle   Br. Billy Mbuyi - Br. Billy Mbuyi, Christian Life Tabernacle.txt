committed to you and asked us things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen good to be gathered in the house of god amen is certainly very happy to be home and and in the service of the lord i want to remember where the david and sister leslie pray that god will be with them and all those that are out pray for me i had this cold i started last week and i thought it was going to go off today but i'm feeling a little rough so i'll try not to preach harder or go stronger i don't know how that's going to work out but we'll see let's open our bibles in numbers chapter 13. we have a little thought in our hearts and like to share i was watching service on sunday i certainly enjoyed what brother matthew had to bring and it certainly just inspired my heart amen numbers chapter 13 let's start from verse 17. it's a very familiar scripture reading about the children of israel getting ready at the door of the promised land they've left egypt and now they are just getting ready to get in the promised land amen how many believe we are in the promised land we are here and there's a lot of promise that's been made there's a lot of things that the messenger spoke that we're going to do there's a lot of things that we desire to see and all of those is part of our inheritance and therefore we just need to know what they are and claim them so we can have it amen let's start from 17 it says and moses sent them up to spy out of the land of canaan and said unto them go up go up this way southward and go up into the mountain and see that land what it is what the people that dwell in therein whether they are strong or weak few or many now i want you to pay attention to the instructions is giving them of what they should when they go to the land what they should be watching for and he says what the land is and and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be a good or bad and what city they what city they be that they dwell in whether intense or stronghold and it says in 20 says and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether it be word therein or not oh well and and be a good courage and bring off the fruits of the land now it says the time was the time was at the time of the the first uh rip grape it says so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of zine unto rehab and the men came to hamad and they ascended up to the south by the south and came down unto hebron and came unto hebron and were in uh amen and and sheshai and taume and the children of anakwar and it says now hebron was built seven seven years before zeon in egypt and they came up they came unto the brook of iskoff and cut down from hence a branch with a cluster of grape and they're buried between two upon a staff now think about this think about the size of this grape never seen before and it and they brought it off the pomegranate and of the fig and they played and they were and the place was called the brook is called because the cluster of grape which the children of israel cut down went forth and then let's jump over to 30 and it says i took 29 it says i'm sorry let me not jump because i needed to read let's read 27 28 and 30 29 and 30 says and they told him and said he came upon the land where with us sending us and and survey it flowed with milk and honey and and this is the fruit of it now they actually testifying of what they saw in the land and it says nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the city is walled and what and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there and the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hate sites and the jebusites and the amorites that dwell in the mountain and the canaanites dwelling by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stealed the people and and before moses and said let us go up and once and possess it for we are able to overcome it and i bet the lord had the blessing to the reading of the word i just want to speak for a little bit you may have your seats on we are more than able to overcome it now if i continue on 31 and it says and the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are strong stronger than we and they brought up an evil report on the land which they were they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land it says through which we have gone to search it is the land that eated up people that eat it at the inhabitants thereof and and the people that we saw they're in there uh the man of great stature and there we saw the giants the son of anak which came of the giants and we were and he says and we were in our own site as grasshopper and we were as so we were in the site now it's amazing when you read the story and it seems like the more you read it to more insight it's one of those stories in the bible where you read and i'll say perhaps the entire bible every time you read it seems like the lord bring more insight and more insight to us as we walk in this world because we we see the children of israel and where they were we could certainly identify with our own selves being uh in the promised land and trying to conquer the promises that they've been given to us now you you you ask yourself a question how can somebody come in this state now just couple of years ago these people were in egypt and and they can tell you before they got out of egypt that god promised them and they stood them up before all the people and he told moses he said that i want you to remember this day what's about to happen why because god with his mighty hand was getting ready to bring them out of egypt and if you the scripture says and the lord brought them up forth this is in deuteronomy 26 and 8 and it says and the lord brought us brought us forth out of egypt with the mighty hand and with an outstretched arm with great terribleness and with signs and wonders now these are not a people that have never seen the supernatural this is not a people that were not acquainted with the supernatural where you said well they just came out and they were fresh you know from egypt they didn't know anything about god they lost everything that they knew about god and this is the first obstacle so obviously you can cut them some slack and see that they were really afraid of what they was looking at but these are a people that if the story was to be told it could never be contained at all that they had seen on the way to the promised land we see how that god opened up the red sea how he came he hardened the heart of pharaoh the scripture says that he did it so he may show his might god was intended for his people to know him god is always intended for his people to know him he's not intended for us to go in the book and read some books and come up with some knowledge or some past history of what he has done and come here and say oh you know the god of isaac and jacob and the god of israel and the god the same god the same thing he did if you go out in the history of the bible everyone that ever walked with god god made himself known to them personally because what he wanted them to do was to establish your personal relationship with him so that when they encounter in obstacles that there will not be a people that will run away or be a people that will be intimidated but they'll be remembered that there will be a people that will be reminded every time that the god who walked with my father the god who brought us out of the land of egypt the god who took my father out of egypt and he crossed the red sea and he done many signs and wonders that same god is our god israel were regarded because of those things because they knew that the god of israel was the greatest god that there was and and his testimony went all over the world because they knew what kind of god it was so you can think about the supernatural that happened i began to think about yeah there were brought up two millions come out of egypt and they were to come and and when they crossed the red scene none of them was running even as we read we find out that they didn't say although take off and whoever comes up before the water can fall then you made it no they walked one by one one by one coming up with the egypt tommy coming in the back god taking care of whatever the situation was god opening up the red sea and bringing up whatever there was so that they can cross and he can come and close it back out there was not one in the myth that was dead that god was going to leave behind in fact when moses was speaking to that man they said well why don't you take half and then just take the men you go out and pray in the world and ask why would you take the children and the women why don't you leave them behind well why don't you leave your cattle why don't you leave this all the proposition that pharaoh made him he came back and said we are not leaving one behind the promise was made to the nation of israel and there was not one that was going to be left behind my brother my sister we need to have that same mentality when you see someone fall by the wayside don't just say well he must not have been a believer or well that's there so my god it was not strong enough it was not weak enough it was not this it was not that you have to be have the same mentality that this god had which was there's not gonna be one left behind i don't care how far off it goes we're gonna follow him and unless god reveal his will we are in the business of saving we are in the business of redeeming we are in the business of bringing everybody together so here it is you think about the eating and the drinking oh you think we have supply chain issues today you think about well to feed two millions people i i laid out a cross and to distribute food and and to make sure that everyone had eaten and to take care of the sick and to take care of whatever if one hit against the stone the scripture says there was not one feeble person in the midst think about that logistics oh i tell you our god is the greatest logistician there is on the first of the earth yeah it's just a little thing and people are struggling oh we can't buy this we can't get this this can we can't find this we can't order this it can't come fast enough this is what maine's economy will always fall but god can do it without a car without a bus without an airplane without anything why he is a mighty god oh if we can be inspired by the story we read in the bible we can get to the place where we understand that that same god is the god today he hasn't lost that ability but he can do the same for us today you think about the scripture how he spent their clothes didn't get old two million people walking on the way to the promised land you think about the sandals you think about the dust that will come up and just walking and just walking not running just walking and walking god took care of all of that he he came and he provided manner whatever they needed to eat they never went hungry he provided everything and these are the people that are standing at the door of the promised land now i want you to think about this because you think about how they look at the promised land now they go in they quickly forget about egypt they quickly forget about all the things that happen they quickly forget about all the things that god had done and they go back and the report that they bring is the land is good so obviously the promise was good uh there's the grapes that it took two people to carry there is the land falling uh flowing with milk and honey this is the promise is true but nevertheless we cannot come overcome those people the question i have is since when it was about them overcoming the people they didn't have to do it in egypt they didn't have to do it on the way to the promised land they didn't have to do it anywhere since when the promise changed to where god said it's no longer me it's you and i want to say this that is the source of unbelief in our hearts in our midst every time is whenever we move our eyes off of him whenever we move our eyes off of the promise and we look to ourselves in comparison with the challenge that's when we lose now let me just read it again there is not a place i hate that out here is moses instruction it says and then it says moses said unto them 17 to winning and spy the land of canaan and said unto them get up that way this way it says softwood and go up in the mountain and see the land now let's walk in it it says see the land what it is that the people that dwell wherein whether they'll be strong or weak few or many nothing to do with them what the land is he continues on 19 and says and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad whether it is the city that they dwell in whether it be tense or stronghold and and at the land that to dwell in whether it be fat or lean whether it be wood on a wood therein or not or that it be good it says by eb of good courage and bring of the fruits of the land not a place where it says well when you look at that look at yourself and see if you can really attain to the promise and yes where i want to remind us once again if it was by own merit by our own strength we would have been sitting here tonight we have to understand it started with the lord jesus it started with him coming where in fact when the word came to us we we recognize ourselves unworthy i i this is not for me i can't accept this this is too great for me i can't be in a congregation of saints but that same god he came because of the promise that he has made now we we spoke last time about the the the that how that life was manifested by the word of god and what about him says the word is a seed and only the word can bring eternal life and i want to say this i want to add this tonight it's important you realize that even our victory only comes by the word of god our strengths come from the word of god our healing comes from the word of god how how why do you why do you believe that you can be healed because he said i'm here why do you believe you can be safe because he said i could be saved why do you believe you can't believe you can be delivered because god said so so our strength is when we come and we stand upon the promised word and the things that he has said about us so he comes in you you there they are and the scripture speaks in hosea 12 and 13 it says and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt he didn't say israel worked hard and they did so many things and then the lord brought them out israel did this and then god did this it says by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt and by a prophet by a prophet was it was he preserved so they were preserved they were kept by the power of god by the word of god by the prophet that he sent them the when they listened to him they were preserved when they listened to the instruction that he was given they were preserved but the moment they walked away the moment unbelief came that's when the things come to pass where they came and the unbelief was displayed so in other words the unbelief came only when they moved the eyes off of the promise and they put it upon themselves you think about how much of that we do on a daily basis something happened and we go out in pieces like i can't believe this happened to me i can't believe this is happening if god was with me this would never happening and if god was really with me i must have done something wrong i must have offended somebody i must have done this i must have done it it has nothing to do with you oh take everything that you are put it into the promise the prophet tells us we have the right to go into the scripture to find what the word says about us and to believe and stand on that scripture in fact it says joshua and caleb they stood on the promise they stood on the promise and god honored it jeremiah said jeremiah said and i want you to listen to this what happens when you put your trust in a man he says the scripture says here this is god taking them out first it says it says you perform signs this is jeremiah 32 and 20 and 21. he says you perform signs and wonders in the land of egypt you do so this day this you don't you do this you so you do so this very day brought it brought in israel and among all mankind and you are and you have made a name for yourself as in as in in the case of this day you brought your people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and wonders with a strong head and the outstretched arm with great terror think about it for a second with with great terror all of the people that were around it looking at him all the people that were there they were wondering what kind of people is this what kind of god is this in fact they went to war and win wars just because of the reputation now i want to bring this to you and ask you a question yet they are they went into the promised land they went into in order to spy the promised land in order for them to get of the evidence of the promise they receive of that evidence when they came back they came back with the evidence being true but yet they brought in an evil report because of who they were now i asked you a question what was that when they went to rahab house in that land when they went there what was the the the inhabitant of that nation saying about them i want you to think about this yeah they are they say we are like grasshoppers we are no good they that we can't do anything and everything but you go back to the people that they were talking about that were giant the people that seemed like they could crush them with a just with the touch and everything the scripture says that those people say that the inhabitants of this land they are shaken they are trembling because they have heard of what the god of israel has done to other nations they know his reputation they know his power oh my brother my sister we have to learn to get ourselves out of the picture all the time the more we get ourselves out of the picture the perfect will will or will walk in the will of god the more we take ourselves out of the picture the more the more god's plan will come to pass in our lives so yeah there are the unbeliever is manifested why because of the flesh and i want to say this we didn't we were not given to overcome by the flesh as the scripture will say we were given the power to overcome the flesh the scripture never says your flesh will overcome this or your flesh will do this the scripture says that the spirit of god within you not only will overcome the flesh but will give you the ability to manifest the word of god that is spoken about you now listen to what the scripture says about flesh it says put not your trust in princes no in the son of man in whom there's no help his breath goes forth he returns to his earth he says and this is psalm 146 3 and 3 to 5. it says and in that every in the very day he starts perishes i want you to think about that put not your trust in princes the people of this world the systems of this world what the world is doing today we have covert 19 tomorrow we have another uh uh uh what do you call it another uh uh another another uh version of it and tomorrow we'll have another version and another person it will it will get upgraded as we go we didn't get told that oh man i'm going to conquer this and that will be the end of it and then there'll be peace on earth no there's rumors of war there's going to be diseases there's going to be earthquakes those things are going to continue until the end those things are not going to end and therefore if you put one trust in it you will get the result of what the world is doing you will get version one version two version four you'll get to all of that but you put your stress on this unchanging god the god who's able to open the red sea the god who's able to raise up a people by his name and make all nations fear him because of that god if we walk with the same god we'll get the same result put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there's no help his breath goes forth he returneth to the earth to his earth in that very day his thoughts perish happy is the man that god of jacob happy is a man happy he's he that is the god of jacob for his help oh i'm telling you this is the god of isaac the god of abraham isaac and jacob and he wants to be remembered as that god why because of the things that he has done he wants to be remembered for his fame he wants to be remembered for the things that he had done when it comes to your situation he's bringing up a resume he's bringing up a reputation of the things that he's done in the past he's not a one-time god he's a god who's conquered every situation he's been in death he's conquered it he's been in sickness he's conquered it he's been in all kind of situation he's always walked out of it victorious he's never lost a fight now you tell me should i put my trust in that kind of god or put my trust in the world that's falling apart now we say we put our trust in that god but but but the things that we do shows us that we don't our actions sometimes fell short of what we claim that we trust this god something happened to us we lose our head oh woe it's me we try to go find the scripture of job and try to read so we can relate to what is it to be on the ice sheep something happened and we lose our mind we try to find a character that was so sad and job and and we try to find jonah in the belly walls belly and we scream it up it says woe is me oh but let me tell you this this kind of god honors his word it was not about the people in fact let me just jump ahead and say this even after they've done that god promised to destroy all of them but the scripture says that moses talked to god and said oh if you do this why when other nations will hear this what would they say they will say that surely that god was not strong enough to take them in the land that he said it would surely they'll say that oh look he took them out of egypt so he can kill all of him in the wilderness surely and the lord said i heard that he heard the words and he promised not to kill them and he promised that he will all that came out of the nation of egypt will die but they will have a new generation that will come up and that generation that never seen what happened at the red sea they never seen oh my brother my sister what a generation we live in the scripture says that he happy is he that believes that is not saved what is the difference within us today i wasn't here when the pillow fire showed up you were not here when god did those mighty and wonderful things oh but there's something placed within your heart you you the scripture spoke and you believe it [Applause] and now he said i'm the god who showed up the pillar of fire and i'm the god that's going to do the same for those who believe he says in first samuel 16 and 7. first samuel 16 and 70 says but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on his height and his stature because i have received refused him for the lord seeth not as a man saith oh i love this we measure people by what we see we look at them and you know if they seem to be all right and we we think oh that must be wonderful and everything and and the year is he comes and he looks at saul and he thinks oh this must be him and this must be this and this must be doubted and and we find out even when when the prophet went uh to select the the uh the the to the to the david's family to select the king when god sent him the first one came he looked at him and says oh surely by his countenance this must be him by his stature this must be him no doubt they had a good character no doubt they had they all looked like they were the ones but they came lord said no no no no until they were all passed and he asked he says don't you have one more don't you just have another one he says well i have one even now the dad i'm doubting i'm not sure if he's the one but he says you know what just go get him what is it going to hurt think about being a proposition what is it going to hurt you know every time you have to show up to be the one doing it is what's going to hurt you know what i mean basically nobody gives you a chance you are the bottom of the ladder you are basically everybody no one can do anything okay let's call him let's just see this has got to be done so let's just have him up here oh my part of my sister but let me tell you to god it's it's not the countenance that counted it's not the physical appearance that comes god doesn't look like what man looks god looks at the heart god looks at what he can achieve and i want to say this and in most times we forget this all the time is it's in our perfect weakness that is strong his strength is made perfect it's when we are at our bottom when we think we have lost it i have messed it up i don't got a chance or anything that's when god stands up and said now that's the time to get started i remember that i didn't write it down the testimony but random talks about she he went to a mental institution to pray for someone who was mentally ill and she was she was a woman and it gets there and this woman comes and it looks clean and everything he sends it he began to talk and all of the sudden brother branham realized that was the woman and so he couldn't believe it he says is it you he said yeah he said and he says okay you know and she began to tell a story and everything and but when i'm i'm paraphrasing it says you know why don't you give your heart back to him he says he wouldn't take me but random looks and says that's the material that god works with it's a broken heart a contrite heart it's when we've come we have nothing to prove we have nothing to show off when our desire is just to do the will of god when we've come we have nothing to offer god i don't have anything to offer all for myself i would whatever you need me to do i'll do it it's when we've come we we lay ourselves at the altar regardless of what his requirements are is when we come in that state that's when we are received it says i have received refuse him for the lord seeth not as a man saith for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart oh my brother my sister i say lord look at my heart when i come to services i don't want to be just to put on a show for people to know i'm here i want a heart to be right i want a gospel that could change the heart i want to come in contact with this living god the one who's made himself known to every people that he called out every people that he ever worked with that same god is here to make himself known to us in the level that he wants us to walk with him but whatever says in the message smearing a church age uh in the smear in the spirit of church age uh this is in the church so he says paragraph 148 it says there it says they are like the children of israel who came out of egypt and stopped short of the promised land so the issue was not coming out they did come out i don't and i want to say this it's easy having seen the level of supernatural that was around this prophet for somebody to say i'm coming out it's easy once you see a child not born with with no eyes just just a socket no eyeballs to see that restored to say i'm coming out it's easy to see a god garden who can take one that you could see was paralyzing and or one hit in a car accident dead raise him up from the dead for you to say i'm coming out it's easy for a baby who's been declared dead and a woman takes him and fights to the the people and comes and brings them to the prophet and that baby come back to life it's easy to look at that and say i'm coming out in fact many came out many wanted to follow many we hear it over and over and over and over and said oh you know he's he's not treating we don't know about his doctrine but what he does god is with him so there's some form of recognition to see that this looks different this means god is with this people this cannot be the works of a man but it's not enough to just recognize that oh my brother my sister if while we preach here if all we talked about is how great god was with the prophet then we are missing another portion coming out is wonderful coming out it's the beginning of it but that's not the end of it we have to go in and know that god for ourselves we have to go in and taste of the fruits of the land ourselves we have to go in and take off that grip and put it on our own shoulder we have to go in and eat off the fruits of the land coming up there's a good thing coming up see your parents live right see them go to church day in and day out you know i'll say this you know my my my my kids and they go to school and they they don't go anywhere but church so you know when they get to church when they get to school and people begin to sing songs they sing church songs they sing church songs they put their hands in the air and they shout and everything at first the teachers were confused they didn't understand what they were saying by both the pay attention to realize what they were doing so one day i come to pick them out they said do you guys go to church i said yeah i was like why he's like that's what they sing all day oh i realize that's wonderful but that's not the end of it you have to make that god your god you have to make that god a personal god you have to have the promise become yours you have to make that this god is my god why is he your god because he saved me because he healed me because he redeemed me because he brought me out of the world it says they came out of egypt but stopped but stopped short of the promised land it says now those children of israel left egypt about 2 million strong they all journeyed together and saw the same miracles of god all partuka of the same manner and water from the smitten rock all follow the same cloud think about it a cloud by day and a pill of fire by night the people where when they see the cloud stopped they stopped when the cloud went forth they stood up they packed up everything and began to walk they were so orderly uh i put together what tribe was to be on what sided what what they were to do what the instruction was when they heard the trumpet everything was totally done they couldn't deny the presence of that god in the midst why because it's not just what moses said it's because they saw what moses said come to pass but yet the two million strong are converted into two people my brother my sister it's not about what we do it's about what god has done and what the promise is for our age and what god has placed within your heart so you can follow this message no one will follow this unless god predestined him to follow it and the scripture barbara says that when they see the supernatural that's what quickens their heart because why when they see it they recognize that that's their calling that's god calling them now and patrick of the manor it says then the smitten rock and follow the cloud by day in the pillow fire by night only two reach the promised land only two were true real believers is that correct it says that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they couldn't enter hebrew hebrews 3 and 19. then since since that is so that is so and only two entered then the rest were not true believers what it says what made what made the difference to stayed with the word what and he says when the hearts of ten spies failed at kaddish barnea joshua and caleb did not stagger for they believe the word and says we are more than able to take their land it says they knew they could they could because god said because god had said i give you this land after those after all of those israelites saw the power and the goodness or deliverance of god they did not enter into rest which is the type of the holy ghost so you can you can see right now that very few that very few will believe all the way and receive the holy ghost this is this is the church book many came out but how many really believed how many really stayed with it how many really believed the word that was spoken and followed it how many really stuck with it and knew that this is the word of god you know that's why it's important because those that stay with it it's not because by their own strength that they stayed with it is because god made it in such a way that the word kept unfolding itself to them when they needed manner the word produced manna when they needed quail the word fought they caused the quail to come down every day when they needed water the word produced water why because they found themselves to be in the hiding place in him everything that they have need of to find it in him therefore they have no need to go outside therefore they have no needs to go and try to figure out what's happening outside all they are concerned with is what is the word says because they know when god has said it he's going to bring it to pass and he says here is what does it uh it says does god ever change his mind about his word he says now listen closely it says when the word test came when they came over and seen the up the opposition so great there it says the greatest opposition that they ever seen the amalekites was ten it says was ten times their size they said we look like grasshoppers the fences and the cities are so wall till they can run a chariot race around it two chariots as hard it says as hard as they can go around the wall see their cities why the spears are way out they are long they are giant why we look like grasshoppers we can't do it think about it think about it every time you read we're gonna have a body change we like grasshoppers we're gonna be translated we like grasshoppers we're gonna we're gonna be the sons of god manifested in the end time i can't overcome it too fake how am i gonna have that oh god he's going to have manifested sons and daughters that are going to have the word the bride has a message the bride has a place to play the body has a commission that she's been given that she has to play in the end time well i can't attain to that that's too high that's that's that's i don't even see how i'm gonna get there why are what are you looking at why are you keep looking at yourself why are you keep looking at your shortcomings your shortcomings no one has ever looked at themselves and perfect themselves and let me add this and say even if for some reason you come to where you can actually live a holy life that righteousness is filthy rag before god so what's the use of even trying oh but those that cry out day and night god i want to promise i desire the promise i have my family i have a need within my heart i have opposition wherever i go i have the devil buffeting me i need that overcoming power god said he's ready for the promise in other words the power to receive what we need it comes directly from the promise to you why because you believe the promise god is obligated to give it to you why because his word must come to pass what is this word is eternal life it's not has nothing to do with the human it's a heaven it's eternal life coming to be manifested in the mortal realm it says and two men stood on the word caleb and joshua wait a minute we are two million it says what a million wait wait a minute you two million people shut up a minute i thought that was wonderful oh this is two million people just roaring up and down oh we surely won't be able to do this in the evil report and the two people out of two million just caused them to all shut up for a second listen we are more than able to overtake the land we are more than able to do it why because they were basing the thought based on the testimony of whose god they were serving they have seen him in battle they have seen him come to fight they have seen him up in the red sea they have seen him do the herd is power the herd of his doing the herd all the nations were trembling remember they're the ones that heard that that ray of room and tell them when they came in they had they heard and they came and said okay what shall we do for you it says well i want you to save my family and everyone that comes in this house that says well you put the purple scarlet you put the i'm sorry the red uh uh uh you you tie a red scarlet uh uh clothes on there that will happen and it says but we have heard of the reputation of your god i tell you this when the seed of god hears the word it doesn't care what the opposition is because every time he hears the word he only hears good things he only hears blessings he only hears power he only hears improvement he only sees what else can i overcome what else can i take why because it's built in them think about this they saw the same thing they saw the same land they saw the same people they saw the same exact thing oh my brother my sister when we walk in this world we see the same thing we see the same thing or you know in fact sometimes people lament about the same thing both question and non-christian but we are told that our hope is not here we have this is not our continuing city this will be burned but we have a place that god has prepared for us that we're going to go to not only did they hear about how good the land was but they also heard about the reputation of their god what happened to the others when they were spoken how can how come they didn't hear it how come they only heard they only trusted what they saw but when the news came the people are trembling because of your god that part of the message was lost in translation to them the bride will be when she recognizes she is she will be an invincible army i need to examine under what circumstance will she be an invincible army what should really happen before she becomes you know you know sometimes we feel like before we can do anything we have to walk up and have a halo around our head and and lights just sun flashing in your face you know oh god is with me then i'm gonna go do something that's not how it works that's not how they did it that's not how gideon did it he took a plow he says i'm going to work i'm going to do why because god already said it it doesn't matter what i'm looking at you know we think god has to come and tap you on the shoulder says come on come on go go go it's time to go he's already said it he's already tapped you on the shoulder he calls you to hear these words he calls you to know this message he calls you to be saved he calls you to be where you are today and if he already done it what are you waiting for and he says what were they based on it says god said i've given you the land it's yours now if you go a little further when they came to conquering the land how much effort did they actually put into conquering the land we are our own greatest enemy our prophet tells us so if you were to come to them after jericho and ask can you tell me exactly what tactical battle that you guys put in place and what kind of weaponry you had to overcome the two chariot that was running on top of the building strong ones a wall cd that you couldn't penetrate oh if we can only put our trust in this god and the reason why we're talking about it today is not so we can refer to some history this is a reality of god and this is what he told moses and he told abraham he says i'm telling you i'm doing this because i know you're going to keep the story alive not just you're going to keep it alive because we serve a god who's done it in the past who's done it in the past and he's here to increase your faith to let you know i've done it i'm gonna do it in the future i'm here to do today i did it yesterday today and forever i'm here to take you to what i promise i will do you just trust my word you just walk in my word you believe what i've told you you continue to believe this message the body change will happen it's not a question whether is it gonna happen will happen when would it happen when god wants it to happen and when he wants it to happen trust me you will be ready to receive it he didn't say we're going to change our own bodies in fact let me say this the scripture says we call this translation the scripture says that he has translated us already from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light we already started our change long time ago this rapture is not something new it's just part of the process it's better to process the change that we've been experiencing all along it's part of getting word of the worldliness of the desires of the world and becoming more and more into his image he started it and you know what it is and he wants you to keep walking in it the moment you step you take a step back you know you're not going in the right direction you know something tells you you are going in the wrong direction why because it's taking you to a body change it doesn't want you to change if the musician could come it says like those fellows come up they come up there and they eat of the grapes isn't it amazing that even in the state that we were in god will let people experience this goodness even in the world think about that he would actually let them taste of his goodness but the ones that are not seed they don't come back but the true seed when they taste of his goodness they have nowhere else to go they say like peter where would we go it's you that has the words of eternal life we were looking for eternal life and we have found it we didn't know what eternal life was you made it known unto us we didn't know who god was without this message all we knew some told us there were three gods and thou told us there were one god but he was mad at us some told us there were steps so we could get to him they told us all kinds of things some told us we got it when we shouted some told us well you know when we speak in tongue then god was good with us oh they told us all kind of stories oh but when we came in contact with this living god the god of this bible the god of this message when he made himself known to you he began to pull out all the unbelief all the wrong teaching you know what is he doing he's walking you to perfection he's walking you through the body change and i say my brother my sister what is the body change is a perfect walk in this message it happens as you walk with it it happens as you eat of it it happens as you partake of him when you partake of him the worldliness fall off he comes to the place why because he cannot exist where cleanness is not there he cannot exist where all kinds of things are that's why we have to empty of ourselves and put him and when you put him you can desire only more of him let's all stand [Applause] [Music] but ranam says on god of this evil age it says notice the day of man he calls this the day of man it says if you want to put it down you put that down i'm going to read it but first corinthians 5 1-5 so i'm sorry first corinthians 4 1-2 first corinthians 4 1 and 5. paul was speaking paul was speaking of the being judged by men it says look what all the the brag on the comment is then some it says and then somebody trying to get somebody to go to the moon i'm sorry my my page is just all scrambled up i can't see anything let me just skip a little bit if you can put it up there is god of this evil age paragraph 84. approaching 65 it starts with notice the day of man the day of man is in quarters [Music] it says just keep going higher i want to pass the milky way on go on just keep going yes paragraph 86 it says it says all it says and the whole world today is dedicated themselves to the knowledge which comes by satan and men's day is glory it says and men's day is glorified it says not by the word of god but the knowledge that is that he has now think let that soak in and i thought this was really critical think about that and when you play this tape back on this day on this point here stop for a while and think oh my oh my my heart just melted when i heard that he says how works are exalted above god's word and manifested works the wisdom of satan which he gives to eve at the beginning now listen don't miss this the wisdom of satan is exalted to the throne of worship in men above the vindicated word of god for the hour our churches proves that they that they their doctor so and so teacher so and so professor so-and-so has exalted their own knowledge and so-called from satan truth above the vindicated promise made clear right before them and men fall for it his scientific achievement trying to prove god's word wrong think about how that's happening today i mean it's all about science don't even think about saying anything bad about science they think you're a madman [Music] don't even think about ever saying anything outside of science it's all science science says where is it leading us to the tree of knowledge [Music] but at the same time what god is wanting to impart to his people is the understanding that when this is happening at the time when this will be happening that god will be in the midst of them performing his word and bringing it to come to pass what is god wanting to do where he is set in seating and all the knowledge and all the things god is looking up for people that can live by his word by his promise it says would you take my word he says well science looked great it says yeah but would you take my word would you let would you let my word come into your heart would you listen to what i promise i'll do in this age and only those that will take that word regardless of everything that's out there those are those that will manifest the seed of god it says man's theolo theology explaining explains god's word to the people and make it of non-effect again like it did in the denomination age when jesus appeared on the earth jesus said you're hypocrite for by your tradition they that the interpretation it says that their interpretation has took the word of god and made it of non-effect you don't need somebody to interpret the word to you you want god to be his own interpreter i heard say that you are a healer i need healing tonight [Music] that's the only interpretation i can take i heard you are a savior i need saving tonight i heard you are a gift of all good gifts i need some gifts tonight and not only that he wants us to do that but he also wants us to reflect the same thing we can only reflect what we have received [Music] so it says the interpretation has took the word of god and made it of non-effect to the people and that's the same thing they have done today it doesn't have the effect [Music] church becomes just a tradition we go in and we go out people show up with no expectation of the supernatural people show up and nobody's coming and saying that i know god will speak to me today i know today is the day of my deliverance i know today what i've been asking and having on my mind god is going to make it happen my sister that's the kind of expectation we need to come we're not coming to hear a man we're not coming just to hear and read some squats and say we're going home we're here in the presence of the same god we just read about the same god is here to do the same thing and it will only end so based on our expectations oh if our expectation can exceed ourselves i'm coming to church and i'm all charged at why because i'm expecting to hear from god i'm expecting that change within me let's just bow our heads our gracious father we're so thankful for the things you do god father we commit what we are into your hands lord your promise is real your promise is true father i pray that you help us overcome our humanity and no doubt everyone here tonight has a battle that they're fighting and sitting profiting them and but father your scripture tells us that it's when the word is burned into our test when we stand that test and believe what you say that's when you come to manifest your word lord we pray tonight that for every need represented in this building and i know there is i pray father that you answer it according to your word father you never left one behind you will never do it today father you never left the need undone all you said come unto me ye that are heavy laden and i shall give you rest lord we come not just as one person but as a body father those that have been coming and those that we have not seen in years we bring them to you tonight you are the god of isaac the art of jacob the god of abraham father every time those names are mentioned another dimension of what you are is being expressed lord in those words we pray father even in what you're expressing yourself in this end time in the bride we pray father that you let your work continue lord that we may be those servants that will do the things which you desire for us to do god that we may never fall short of any but always be at the post of duty father to do service for one another because only when we do that that's when the body can function help us i pray lord be with us for the rest of the week we commit our pastor into your hands ask that you bring him safe strengthen him oh god and father we commit tonight to you lord i pray that you keep everyone safe until we meet again we love you and ask us things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] oh foreign [Music] oh [Music] oh is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] let's pray heavenly father lord you spoke to us tonight lord in a way that it was personal lord there's sometimes we read things in your word and we look back and maybe think we would want to live in the day of noah or want to live on the day lord when you were in the corporal body walking on the seas of galilee lord our different times and maybe our favorite stories but i heard your prophet say today that there's no other age that he'd want to live in and lord i've heard that over the years and it just struck me today different we have the we have the word that is unfolded to us there is nothing hidden from us lord your mind has been exposed you've told us your thoughts you told us how much grace and how much love and mercy you have for us there's not a question that we have that is not answered lord you leave room for faith father but you also come behind it and you give us revelation lord and we thank you for that lord it means so much to us men over the years have probed at it but even in our in our early walks there was questions we had but you always came by and you were so sweet to answer those questions and show us what we had in need of lord what you were really thinking about us there's not a guessing game we don't have to wonder lord you're revealing yourself to us day by day lord we know there's going to be a body change lord even as brother billy said there are sometimes in our flesh we may get caught up in the questions on how and why lord but we want to put those aside and just know that you spoke it it's in your word and we want to claim it we thank you for your goodness your grace and your mercy we commit all things into your hands and we ask these things in jesus name amen amen man let's just think that is our dismissal we'll think about it [Music] oh uh [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
